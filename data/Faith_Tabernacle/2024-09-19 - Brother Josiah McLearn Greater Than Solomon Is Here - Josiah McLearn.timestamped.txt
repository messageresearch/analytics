[29:15] plainness of speech and not a and not as
[29:18] Moses which put a veil over his face
[29:21] that the children of Israel would could
[29:22] not steadfastly look look to the end of
[29:25] that which is abolished but their minds
[29:27] were blinded for un until this day
[29:29] remaineth the same Veil untaken away in
[29:32] the reading of the Old Testament which
[29:34] Veil is done away in Christ but even
[29:36] unto this day when Moses is read the
[29:38] veil is upon their heart never
[29:41] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[29:43] Lord the veil shall be taken away now
[29:46] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[29:48] spirit of the Lord is there is is
[29:50] Liberty but we all with open face
[29:52] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[29:54] Lord are changed into the same image
[29:56] from glory to glory even as by the
[29:58] spirit of the Lord amen let's all bow

[30:38] few minutes tonight if the Lord willing
[30:40] on um on a greater than Solomon is here
[30:43] and uh uh but we but I also kind of
[30:46] wanted to speak a little bit about uh
[30:48] about um
[30:50] um
[30:52] um uh make this Valley full of ditches
[30:56] and uh but we notice that
[30:58] um that that Christ in in second in
[31:01] second Corinthians there it says it says
[31:04] that that um that when that that that
[31:08] that that there was a veil upon the
[31:09] hearts of the people and where where
[31:12] that where that they can they they can
[31:13] never they can never they can never look
[31:15] in into the into the into the into the
[31:19] holiest of of of holies where that once
[31:22] a year once a year only the high priest
[31:24] could could could could could could
[31:27] could could could enter in there and
[31:29] where the shikina glory of God had had
[31:32] had had had hovered had
[31:36] hovered and there and that's and that
[31:39] and that's where where where where it
[31:41] had abided and um and only once year
[31:44] that high priest could cross that Veil
[31:45] and and and and and enter in well now
[31:49] well well now we know that that that
[31:53] that when that that that that was that
[31:56] was Moses's message to his people in
[31:58] that day and and we notice that that
[32:01] that throughout time God has always come
[32:03] in a different Veil and a in a different
[32:04] mask where where where where he would
[32:06] come one day and he would come as Noah
[32:08] and one day where where Noah was was
[32:10] preaching was preaching to to repent and
[32:13] and and get on the ark Arc Ark because
[32:17] because the Reign is coming and and
[32:18] Moses came came with the Deliverance to
[32:20] his people and and shamgar came and
[32:22] preached a message to his people and and
[32:24] and Isaiah preached a message to his
[32:26] people but but but but yet those those
[32:29] different those different messages would
[32:30] not work in in the other person's day
[32:33] when when when when Jesus when when
[32:36] Jesus had had come he he couldn't have
[32:38] preached he could not have preached have
[32:40] preached Noah's message right because if
[32:43] if Jesus had showed up and and said to
[32:44] repent and board the ark it it wouldn't
[32:47] have worked it was not it was not it was
[32:48] not applicable applicable for that day
[32:50] and in that time but but but but but but
[32:54] but but but Noah but but we find that
[32:57] Noah had had a portion of God and he
[32:59] acted a a a particular way way way way
[33:05] in his in his message and his message
[33:06] was a particular way because it was in
[33:08] that time and in that season for that
[33:10] day it was the word for his day being
[33:13] being being made being made made
[33:15] manifested he could not have come with
[33:18] with with with with Moses's message it
[33:20] wouldn't have worked he he he he he
[33:23] couldn't have come and tried to split
[33:24] the red the the the the Red Sea or call
[33:27] Fire down down down from from heaven in
[33:29] Elijah's day because it wasn't it wasn't
[33:32] for that day and for that and for the
[33:33] and and for and for that hour but when
[33:36] he come he Express exactly what what
[33:39] what what God told him to to do he
[33:42] he and and all those people all those
[33:46] people who was redeemable right those
[33:48] eight Souls all those people who were
[33:51] redeemable redeemable believed it be
[33:54] because because as the prophet said they
[33:56] were the thoughts of God the attributes
[33:58] of him at the beginning was made flesh
[34:01] and redeemable and and was brought back
[34:03] to God as many as received him to them
[34:06] gave he the power to become sons of God
[34:09] because they were they was they were re
[34:13] re re re redeemable they were from the
[34:15] beginning in the expression of God so so
[34:19] so so so so so so so so now so now so
[34:23] now we can we can look throughout
[34:25] history and see that that that God that
[34:27] God with that veil with with that with
[34:29] that Veil over himself he he he showed
[34:32] up and manifested himself as Ezekiel he
[34:34] showed up and manifested himself through
[34:36] Isaiah through through David through all
[34:38] those prophets of of of the Old
[34:42] Testament why because because he came in
[34:44] in and and he came in different mask in
[34:46] a different times and different seasons
[34:48] in and and and and and in history but we
[34:52] notice God never changed God has never
[34:55] changed changed changed his nature who
[34:57] he was God was still God go he was still
[35:00] the same back then as he as he is as he
[35:03] is as he is as he is today but we just
[35:07] notice he changed his mask and in Joel
[35:10] chapter 2 and 28 he says he promised
[35:12] that in these last days there will be a
[35:13] Lou rain poured out upon the people and
[35:16] and and and brother Bram said said said
[35:19] said that the Greek word there is is
[35:20] kenos which means he emptied himself out
[35:23] not in the way that that that that that
[35:27] that that we would say like something
[35:28] was inside of something somebody that he
[35:30] emptied out but he poured himself out he
[35:33] he said he changed he changed his and
[35:36] morphe he changed from what he was to
[35:38] what he is and he never changes his
[35:40] nature but on the day of Pentecost he
[35:43] changed himself from being the son of
[35:45] man to the Son of God he came not not
[35:47] with the people he came in the people
[35:49] see the same God to carry his ministry
[35:51] on through in this in in this great Age
[35:56] and and and and and so he said another
[35:58] place he said he said Jesus is our Moses
[36:00] of of of of Jesus is our Moses of today
[36:05] Moses's veil was the Living Word Moses's
[36:07] veil was the Living Word to the people
[36:10] today Jesus Jesus veiled is the Living
[36:12] Word to is the Living Word to the people
[36:15] that Jesus is in the church the Holy
[36:17] Ghost the Son of God in the people
[36:19] revealing the word by the promise of
[36:21] this day makes it just exactly the the
[36:24] same now so now we look at we step back
[36:27] can we look at at Jonah and because it
[36:29] says it says that it says that it says
[36:32] that greater than Jonah was here in that
[36:35] scripture and but but yet but yet you
[36:36] can look at Jonah when he when he ran
[36:38] away from God's calling and he ended up
[36:40] and he ended up in the belly of the well
[36:42] and and and and brother brandham said
[36:45] said said that everywhere that that that
[36:48] Jonah looked was he looked left it was
[36:50] Wells belly and he looked right it was
[36:51] Well's belly and he looked up it was
[36:53] Well's belly and everywhere he could see
[36:55] was nothing but the belly of the whale
[36:56] but brother Bram said said that he
[36:59] looked at his circumstances as lying
[37:01] vanities right just just as as as
[37:03] brother Branson Branson had had had
[37:05] testified before um um during during the
[37:09] the the the the the song service he he
[37:11] came and Satan tried to tried tried to
[37:14] lay a sickness on him but but but but
[37:17] Branson Branson recognized it as a lying
[37:19] vanity right and and and and so and so
[37:22] we know that Jonah when when Solomon had
[37:24] dedicated had dedicated the temple that
[37:26] God had Vindicated his presence in that
[37:28] in that in that in that in that in that
[37:31] Temple by letting his glory fill that
[37:33] place up and and by coming in and by
[37:36] coming in in in as a as a pillar of of
[37:40] cloud and it went and and and sat behind
[37:42] the holy place and upon the mercy seat
[37:45] and over the ark and it settled down and
[37:46] it filled that place up and Solomon
[37:48] prayed Lord If thy people be in trouble
[37:50] anywhere and will look to this holy
[37:52] place and pray then you will hear from
[37:54] heaven now now now now now now if Jonah
[37:58] under all those circumstances where he
[38:00] where he was set with all the the
[38:01] rotting nasty um um fish and that
[38:04] seaweed and all that that filth and and
[38:08] and and if he could sit
[38:10] there sat there and think about that
[38:12] about that about that that that that
[38:15] that promise that that what God had had
[38:16] had had had had promised him that if you
[38:18] will look to this Holy Temple and and
[38:21] and a and pray God God will God will
[38:24] will will hear will hear will hear your
[38:27] your prayer amen so if if he
[38:30] can have faith in the prayer in the
[38:32] prayer in the in the in the prayer of a
[38:34] man a a human being that had later on
[38:36] had backslid and and and and over a
[38:39] temple that had been that had been built
[38:41] had been built by by the by the by the
[38:44] Hands by by the hands of man that God
[38:46] that God that God had had come into to
[38:49] to to how much more ought we tonight as
[38:51] the Bride As the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:53] when when all the circumstances that we
[38:54] have are stacking up against us when
[38:56] when all when all we see to the left and
[38:58] the right is we see might see have
[39:00] financial problems we might have
[39:02] sickness our children might be might be
[39:05] straying left or right or or or or or or
[39:08] or when it seems like all hell is coming
[39:10] against us where where where where where
[39:13] we can sit in the presence of the great
[39:15] God himself and and where where where
[39:19] where we can look at all those and call
[39:20] those as lying vanities where we can
[39:22] claim our God our God our God our God
[39:25] our God g g given rights and and where
[39:28] we can see people healed and saved and
[39:30] filled with the and filled with the Holy
[39:32] Ghost why why we don't look we don't
[39:34] look to towards a natur a natural Temple
[39:36] tonight but but but but but but but but
[39:40] we look at at a temple in in in heaven
[39:43] it's Christ Jesus where Christ sits on
[39:45] the right hand of the of the of the
[39:47] Throne of God and and and with the power
[39:49] of his own blood to make intercession
[39:51] Upon Our confession we why God has gone
[39:56] from the temple in the wilderness and
[39:57] the Temple of of of of of so of Solomon
[40:00] where that Shak glory of God was in the
[40:02] holiest of holies where where where it
[40:04] was such a a holy atmosphere where where
[40:07] the high priest he had to go through
[40:09] this whole this this ritual just to be
[40:11] able to walk in there where they had to
[40:13] they they they had to to to anoint him
[40:16] from from head to toe with oil where he
[40:18] had bells on the bottom of his of his
[40:19] robe where where where where where when
[40:21] he had to walk such a certain way where
[40:23] those bells would play Holy Holy Holy
[40:25] unto the Lord why because it was a the
[40:27] shakina of Glory the very power the
[40:29] existence of God was dwelling in in that
[40:33] that that that Temple but yet now but
[40:36] yet now he's no longer he's no he's no
[40:38] longer dwelling in the temple made of of
[40:41] of of of of of of stone and brick and
[40:44] gold now he's dwelling in human
[40:47] flesh where where the worshipper once
[40:49] purged once purged has no more desire
[40:52] has no more desire to to S and not even
[40:54] a consciousness of it we in the Old
[40:57] Testament that that that that worshipper
[40:59] would would come in and offer and offer
[41:01] his sacrifice year after year but but
[41:03] but the difference was he would come
[41:04] back and he would come back out with the
[41:06] same desire he he he every year he he he
[41:08] would roll back and say I'm going to be
[41:09] different this year sacrifice sacrifice
[41:12] and tomorrow he' turn around and fall
[41:14] again but yet as but but but yet but yet
[41:17] when Christ died when Christ died died
[41:19] died on on Calvary we can now we can now
[41:23] come forth and lay our sacrifice at the
[41:25] at the at the feet of Jesus the Shina
[41:28] glory of God and when we can get up and
[41:30] and and we have no more we have no more
[41:33] desire of sin it has been purged from
[41:34] our very existence but just as the Bible
[41:37] says we all with open face beholding as
[41:40] in a glass the glory of the Lord we are
[41:42] changed we we are we are we are we are
[41:44] not just we not up one day and down the
[41:47] other we're not we're not this way or
[41:49] we're that way we are changed from Glory
[41:51] unto
[41:52] Glory as the glory of the Lord is Fallen
[41:55] is Fallen upon the bride
[41:58] brother bam said said said said said
[42:00] then it was God it was God in them days
[42:02] it was God in a man his son Christ Jesus
[42:05] we believe that not just a prophet not
[42:07] just an ordinary man a an ordinary human
[42:10] it was God in Christ God in a man the
[42:13] fullness of the godhead bodily in a man
[42:16] God in a man now it's God in man the
[42:19] fullness of God in the godhead bodily
[42:21] his entire church manifesting himself
[42:24] fulfilling his his word and and
[42:27] and so so so so so so we find that that
[42:31] that that God has always had had a skin
[42:33] on him right he he said through
[42:36] throughout time he has always worked
[42:37] through worked worked he has always
[42:40] worked through man mankind you look he
[42:44] he had he he had he had he had Moses
[42:47] when Moses had had had had seen him he
[42:50] he he looked like a man and talk like a
[42:51] man but God had veiled him toward toward
[42:53] to where he only seen the backside of
[42:55] him what but but but why but but God but
[42:58] God but God had a skin on him but but
[43:02] but but but yet we also know that
[43:03] brother man taught us that Moses was
[43:05] literally God to those people he was God
[43:08] in in flesh to those to those people at
[43:10] that time it was it was a manifestation
[43:12] of of God of God of God of God for that
[43:16] for that time but but but but and and
[43:20] and brother brother brother brother
[43:22] brandom said now I think in that you
[43:24] find out the changing himself what he
[43:26] did he said if you'll notice he came in
[43:28] the name of Three Sons he he came in the
[43:30] name of the son of man the Son of God
[43:32] and the son of David he came as and he
[43:34] came as son of man now in Ezekiel 2:3 it
[43:38] says Jehovah himself called Ezekiel the
[43:40] prophet son of man son of man means a
[43:44] prophet and and he had to come that way
[43:47] that way to fulfill D Deuteronomy 1815
[43:51] which Moses said the Lord your God shall
[43:53] raise up among you a prophet likened on
[43:55] on likened on unto me he he never he
[43:59] never called he never called himself the
[44:00] son of man he referred he referred to
[44:02] himself he he he referred to himself the
[44:06] he he never called himself the son of
[44:07] man he referred to himself the the son
[44:10] of man because he had he had to come
[44:12] according to the scriptures see he had
[44:14] to make these two pieces of torn paper
[44:16] the Old Testament prophecy and his own
[44:18] character to be exactly the same so he
[44:20] come the son of man come in that form
[44:22] but then he and he says but then we find
[44:24] after his death burial and Resurrection
[44:26] he come on the day of Pentecost as Son
[44:29] of God God God the spirit in the form
[44:32] Holy Ghost what was he doing he was
[44:34] changing himself making himself known to
[44:36] his people in a different form like the
[44:38] Holy Spirit which is God he come to deal
[44:41] through he he come to deal with with he
[44:43] he come to deal Through the Ages as Son
[44:45] of God the the Holy Spirit he said but
[44:48] in the Millennium he comes as son of
[44:50] David to set on the throne of David King
[44:53] he he was he was to take the Throne of
[44:55] David he he is on the father's so now
[44:57] but but and then he said he he that
[44:59] overcometh cometh shall set with me on
[45:01] my Throne as I overcome and set on my
[45:03] father's Throne so he in the Millennium
[45:05] he'll be son of David what is it the
[45:07] same God all the time just changing his
[45:10] mask it's that of morphe and and and and
[45:14] and but but but and then and then a bit
[45:18] later later on down he says Jesus said
[45:20] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[45:22] it be at the coming of the son of man
[45:24] deity veiled again in human flesh now
[45:28] now now now remember Jesus didn't say
[45:30] when the Son of God is is being revealed
[45:33] and in in Luke in Luke in Luke the
[45:35] 17 chapter he he said when the son of
[45:39] man is being revealed the son of man
[45:41] back in the church again revealed
[45:43] revealed in human beings not Son of God
[45:46] but son of man again back in his church
[45:49] again in the last days we find that he
[45:51] promised that he that we find what he
[45:54] promised that in God it was in God
[45:56] promises
[45:58] so so so so so we find though that he he
[46:02] went from that he's changed back into
[46:04] the son of man in these last days why
[46:06] because it has to fulfill the the
[46:08] Malachi Malachi 45 and 6 and and and and
[46:13] the rest of the of of of of the of of
[46:17] the scriptures we had he he he was he
[46:20] was he was just like God the Father God
[46:22] the son and God the Holy Ghost it's the
[46:24] same God but three but three different
[46:26] attributes of the same God now this is
[46:28] son of now now now now now now now son
[46:32] of David is is is is to the Jews right
[46:35] but but now he has revealed himself in
[46:37] these last days as son of man again
[46:39] revealing himself revealing himself
[46:41] again in a prophet and a prophet in
[46:44] these last days why because he he he had
[46:46] he had to fulfill all
[46:49] scriptures but but
[46:52] um you guys you guys will have to help
[46:54] me out here cuz I'm trying to lay this
[46:56] this Foundation just to to to to to show
[46:59] something here but but he says he
[47:02] brother Lam said now in these last days
[47:03] he returned back as son of man because
[47:06] Malachi promises that there would be a
[47:07] prophet rise up in the last days that
[47:09] would return the hearts of of the people
[47:11] people back to the original word the
[47:13] faith of the fathers the original
[47:15] Pentecost and when he did it St John
[47:17] 14:12 says the works that he did w would
[47:21] be done would be done would be done
[47:22] would be done also in Revelations 10
[47:25] promises the whole mystery so God is is
[47:27] sending the son of man as the super
[47:30] again in these last days we notice that
[47:33] when that that when that when when when
[47:35] when when when when mzc appear appear

[51:33] it so so so so we don't we notice we we
[51:36] notice that uh that uh that that that
[51:39] that that the queen of of of Sheba with
[51:42] with with with that something had had
[51:44] had had got a hold of her with when when
[51:47] all the circumstances that she had when
[51:48] she had across that that that that
[51:50] Sahara Desert and her and her church had
[51:54] had kicked her out had excommunicated
[51:56] her and she traveled um um all those
[51:58] miles
[51:59] miles across across the desert she was
[52:03] thoroughly
[52:04] thoroughly convinced that God was was
[52:07] was was was was was was was was moving
[52:12] was moving in a people
[52:13] again when when when through all the the
[52:16] difficulties she had and all the
[52:17] struggles she had where when she
[52:19] went she was thoroughly convinced about
[52:22] it and there was nothing there was
[52:24] nothing there was nothing that that that
[52:26] that that was going to stop her and I
[52:28] can say tonight that that a greater than
[52:31] Solomon is is is is is here tonight
[52:36] but but yet we always know that that
[52:39] that as soon as as you make a
[52:40] determination a determined step or DET
[52:42] or determination to where to where to
[52:44] where to where you'll seek God and and
[52:46] and and you'll and you'll get your
[52:49] answer Satan is is always there to to
[52:51] block the way he he'll be there he'll
[52:53] fight you tooth and elf for for for for
[52:55] everything he he he he he'll he'll he'll
[52:57] make you have a flat tire on the way to
[52:59] church he'll he'll he'll he'll he'll
[53:00] come and and put you down with sickness
[53:02] or he'll come and and fight you every
[53:05] every every single every single answer
[53:08] the way answer the way that he can but
[53:10] we have to purpose in in our hearts that
[53:12] there is nothing that is going to to to
[53:14] to to to stop us but but but but but but
[53:18] but but remember now that that that
[53:20] woman had that that that that Queen of
[53:22] Sheba had a lot of hindrances but but
[53:24] her faith her but her faith her faith
[53:26] didn't H have any she was determined
[53:29] that she was that she was going to go
[53:30] all the way that that that didn't matter
[53:32] it didn't matter if if if if thieves
[53:34] came up and stole and stole everything
[53:36] that that she had it didn't matter if
[53:38] all her camels died she was going to
[53:40] walk the rest of the way it doesn't
[53:42] matter what had happened or or or or or
[53:45] or or or or or or or what she was going
[53:49] to go through she was going to go all
[53:50] the way all the way tonight but but but
[53:54] and and so and so and so and so and so
[53:57] we know we know now that that that when
[54:00] we determine anything with God we have
[54:02] to we have to grab a hold to God and and
[54:04] hang on tight for dear life and we're
[54:06] going we're going to be to be like Jacob
[54:08] when we wrestle all night long and say
[54:10] and say I will not let go until you
[54:12] bless me I I I don't care I don't care
[54:14] if the doctor say there's no hope I
[54:16] don't care if the doctor say there's
[54:17] nothing there's nothing that that that
[54:19] that that you can do do do I I don't
[54:23] care if the bank's calling to for cloes
[54:24] on you I don't care I I don't care I
[54:26] don't
[54:27] care what whatever happens whatever
[54:30] happens you take a hold of God's word
[54:32] and and you hold on to it because it is
[54:34] our life it is our everything it is who
[54:35] we are as the bride of Christ so I don't
[54:38] care I don't care if we have to stand
[54:40] there like like Elisha with with those
[54:43] with those with those with those with
[54:45] those
[54:47] 400 prophets and come against him
[54:51] and and and Elijah could could stand on
[54:54] the Vindicated on the indicated word of
[54:57] the hour and not let go why because be
[54:59] because because God had promised it we
[55:02] have to determine in our hearts there's
[55:03] nothing there's nothing that's that
[55:05] that's that that's going to stop
[55:07] us why why why why because God God God
[55:12] has changed his mask and is now he's now
[55:14] poured he's now gone from from from the
[55:16] prophets of the Old Testament through
[55:18] through through through through through
[55:19] through Christ when he died on the cross
[55:20] to to to filling those people with the
[55:22] Holy Ghost to to now he was back in a
[55:24] prophet and now he is manifest ested the
[55:27] fullness of Christ in the bride of
[55:29] Christ the the fullness of Christ is now
[55:31] in in the bride in these last days why
[55:35] why so we can stand there in all
[55:37] confidence and in all and in all
[55:39] Assurance knowing who who who who we are
[55:42] just Ju Just as that Queen she might
[55:44] have marched across that desert for for
[55:47] months and months and months and months
[55:48] and and and yet and yet and yet and
[55:52] yet and and yet and yet she was marching
[55:55] with all conf and in all Assurance
[55:57] knowing that that that that that
[55:59] whatsoever that's whatsoever she asked
[56:02] God would fulfill a and and
[56:07] so so so now so now we can see that that
[56:11] tonight through that that that through
[56:14] the bride of Christ there is a greater
[56:16] than than than Solomon is here he's
[56:18] standing here in in our midst midst
[56:20] tonight and we have all assurance and
[56:22] all authority knowing that whatsoever we
[56:24] have need of he is here to fulfill it
[56:27] but but and so we notice that um that uh
[56:31] um you look at this this this make this
[56:34] Valley full of full full of of of of
[56:37] ditches the the Israelites had had had
[56:40] had had come up had come up on a war
[56:43] against against um against the enemy I I
[56:45] don't I don't remember I I I don't
[56:46] remember who it was now but he he come
[56:48] up against the war and they got out in
[56:49] the middle of that desert and realized
[56:50] they didn't have any water and they were
[56:52] dying a thirst so they went and got the
[56:54] prophet and they asked him and he and he
[56:56] said bring me a Minal a
[56:58] ministrel and he and and as they began
[57:01] to play he began to pray about it and
[57:03] and God revealed to him said said said
[57:06] said you dig you dig these valleys this
[57:08] Valley full of ditches and and and so
[57:11] and and so and so and so and so and so I
[57:15] would imagine that that that that they
[57:17] all grabbed shovels and they started
[57:18] digging and and and then they dug some
[57:21] more and dug some more and dug some more
[57:23] and brother bam said said said
[57:27] brother bam said that they went to digg
[57:28] and and some of them said well I've got
[57:30] the Digger the deeper you go the more
[57:32] water you're you're you're the the more
[57:35] water you're going to have that's the
[57:37] thing tonight get to dig in some ditches
[57:39] so the Holy Ghost can travel through it
[57:41] that water come that water come from
[57:43] that rock that was in the desert out
[57:45] there that had that had been smitten in
[57:47] the days of Moses it was still there and
[57:49] it's still here tonight that same rock
[57:51] that the children of Israel of of Israel
[57:54] had drank from he was that Rock God so
[57:56] loved the world that he gave his only
[57:58] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[58:00] him shall not perish a perishing people
[58:03] from the smitten Rock lived and he is
[58:05] the smitten Rock tonight to a perishing
[58:07] people the only hope of Life Of Life Of
[58:09] Life of life that there is is a perfect
[58:11] type there there he was and and and so
[58:16] and so and
[58:18] so and and and and so we notice that the
[58:21] children of Israel you know and I don't
[58:22] know if if any of y'all have ever dug
[58:25] out there in the desert it is not not
[58:26] like it is not like it is not like like
[58:28] like like like they can here here we
[58:30] have Clay and it's somewhat easy easy to
[58:34] dig but out there it's it's it's the
[58:36] ground is like rock and you and you you
[58:38] dig and you dig and you dig and and and
[58:40] and and yet it seems like every shovel
[58:42] full you hit a boulder the size of a
[58:43] Volkswagen I've done it but but yet
[58:47] those people out in that desert they
[58:49] they were a desperate people they were a
[58:50] perishing people where where where where
[58:52] they said we have to dig or we will die
[58:54] and they dug all night long and and and
[58:56] and the next thing you know no no they
[58:58] got they got a foot deep and they kept
[59:00] digging and digging and next thing you
[59:01] know they got they got two feet deep and
[59:03] they kept digging and diging brother
[59:04] brandom said said as much as much as
[59:06] you're as you are willing are willing to
[59:08] dig that is as much as as as you're able
[59:11] to get out so if you dig down a shovel
[59:14] full you'll get a shovel full full of
[59:16] full of water if you dig down if if if
[59:20] if you're willing to um Dig Down uh um

[59:36] and and
[59:37] digging and and next thing you know they
[59:39] started to dig them doubts out they they

[1:03:31] and women men and women to believe to
[1:03:33] have faith in God to believe on God and

[1:03:37] said Do you believe it he said
[1:03:40] he and then he said he said we're
[1:03:42] thinking we're thinking of the Centurion
[1:03:44] now when he said I'm not worthy that you
[1:03:46] should come you should come that you

[1:04:13] Centurion where he he was a he was a man
[1:04:15] in the military he snapped his fingers
[1:04:17] and and and they and they brought up to
[1:04:19] him I seen a thing the other day where
[1:04:21] where where Biden was was was in the

[1:04:25] within two seconds and somebody brought
[1:04:26] him a chocolate ice cream cone and and
[1:04:28] and it may it made me think it made me
[1:04:30] think think of of of of that Centurion
[1:04:34] where where he snapped his fingers and
[1:04:35] they bought him a chocolate ice cream
[1:04:37] come on on or something I don't know but
[1:04:39] he he was a man with authority and with
[1:04:42] and whatsoever he said went but but yet
[1:04:44] but yet he recognized the authority and
[1:04:46] the power and the
[1:04:48] power that that that that that that was
[1:04:52] was in Jesus Christ where he may have
[1:04:54] commended man but but Jesus but Jesus
[1:04:56] was what Jesus with just a word with
[1:04:58] just a word could could could could
[1:05:00] could command the demons to
[1:05:02] leave and and to be cast

[1:05:11] bride of Christ we have all authority we
[1:05:14] have all power we can snap our fingers
[1:05:16] and and with the simple word the demons
