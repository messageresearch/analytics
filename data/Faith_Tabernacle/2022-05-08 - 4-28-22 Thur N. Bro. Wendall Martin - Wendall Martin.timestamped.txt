[35:24] with
[35:25] revelations 5 where they sung a new song
[35:29] because this is a day tonight is not the
[35:32] typical church service
[35:34] amen of the last seven ages

[35:40] the toning lamb
[35:42] yes they were anticipating the future

[35:52] singing a new song
[35:54] amen
[35:56] the lion has roared and the seven
[35:59] thunders have been heard
[36:02] amen and what was the mysterious dark
[36:05] amen symbols has now been unsealed
[36:09] and the people of god has yesterday
[36:13] behind us
[36:14] with all of the bondages
[36:16] denominationalism
[36:18] and there is an elect who has come out
[36:20] of those dark tombs of denominations
[36:24] and they are standing afresh and revived
[36:27] in the presence of the lord the way that
[36:30] god had it at pentecost can you say amen
[36:34] amen i say today our souls have heard
[36:37] the voice come out of her my people that
[36:40] you receive not of her plagues
[36:43] can you say amen
[36:45] i say tonight what a fellowship amen we
[36:48] sing the song what a fellowship what a
[36:50] joy divine leaning on those everlasting
[36:54] arms of god

[36:59] been good to us

[37:21] have heard a voice in the darkness
[37:24] you've heard a voice in this hour that
[37:26] says come up higher what can you say man
[37:30] amen psalms 92 and 1 it says it is a
[37:32] good thing to give thanks unto the lord

[37:47] an instrument of ten strings upon the
[37:49] salt triple on the harp a solemn sound
[37:51] for thou lord has made me glad
[37:56] so so it's not the music that's making
[37:58] you glad
[37:59] hallelujah it's not some kind of fancy
[38:02] singing that's making you glad that thou
[38:06] has made me glad

[39:16] hallelujah
[39:18] but when the wicked spring has the grass
[39:20] and when all the workers of iniquity do
[39:22] flourish
[39:23] it is that they shall be destroyed
[39:25] forever
[39:26] for thou lord art most high forever
[39:29] for lo thine enemies o lord lo thine
[39:33] enemies shall all perish
[39:37] and all the workers of iniquity shall be
[39:40] scattered but my strength shall thou
[39:44] exalt like the horn of a unicorn and i
[39:48] shall be anointed
[39:50] with fresh oil

[1:03:00] if you don't understand what john the
[1:03:02] revelator was crying about
[1:03:05] the church looked like it was going down
[1:03:08] it looked like the tree was going to be
[1:03:10] totally defeated
[1:03:12] it it looked as as though the deed amen
[1:03:17] even though it was redeemed
[1:03:19] even though the inheritance was paid for
[1:03:22] even though christ paid the money
[1:03:25] it it seemed
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] that satan wasn't ever going to give it
[1:03:29] up
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:31] it seemed that
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:34] satan had claimed this title deed
[1:03:36] whenever he took adam
[1:03:38] and eve out
[1:03:40] and he snatched the title deed
[1:03:43] and satan's been going around all this
[1:03:44] time
[1:03:45] saying yeah amen
[1:03:48] it's mine
[1:03:50] and every time you try to raise up
[1:03:52] every time you try to raise up and say
[1:03:54] i'm a son of god
[1:03:56] satan just goes back and starts pointing
[1:03:57] at your failures
[1:03:59] he starts pointing at your weaknesses
[1:04:02] and he says well you can't be that one
[1:04:04] you can't be that bright
[1:04:06] amen what was that thought you had
[1:04:08] yesterday
[1:04:09] what about what you said what what what
[1:04:11] about why ain't your mama healed

[1:04:15] amen with diabetes why are you still
[1:04:17] struggling even with cancer why are you
[1:04:19] still struggling you must not be yet
[1:04:24] come on church man
[1:04:27] and the enemy was right there
[1:04:29] amen accusing saying i'm not giving up
[1:04:30] the title deed
[1:04:32] adam
[1:04:33] forfeited it
[1:04:34] it's mine
[1:04:36] and i'm not giving it back
[1:04:40] i praise the lord
[1:04:41] my brother branham said satan's a squat
[1:04:45] and that he don't legally own it
[1:04:48] he's had two thousands of years of fuss
[1:04:50] whether he owns it or somebody else owns
[1:04:53] it but christ has come as the kinsmen
[1:04:55] redeemer
[1:04:56] and he's rebranding them back to us
[1:04:59] satan still possesses it
[1:05:02] but we need a judge to judge the case
[1:05:10] well praise the lord
[1:05:12] hallelujah there's a reason why we're
[1:05:13] rejoicing in here tonight

[1:05:28] found a way to eve and then he deceived
[1:05:31] eve and and then all the race has been
[1:05:34] in a fallen condition and then he

[1:24:52] that is when god comes down
[1:24:55] the judge settles the case
[1:25:00] once and for
[1:25:02] all
[1:25:02] [Applause]

[1:25:37] jurisdiction
[1:25:39] and is not subject to litigation again
[1:25:42] by the same parties
[1:25:44] it is final

[1:27:01] and it is a principle or doctrine that
[1:27:03] bars relitigation
[1:27:06] or reconsideration of the matter

[1:27:11] it's a judgment
[1:27:13] a decree
[1:27:14] a ward or other determination
[1:27:17] that is considered final
[1:27:19] and cannot be tried in court again
[1:27:23] once the verdict has been decreed
[1:27:27] nothing can change it
[1:27:31] and when it says the lion
[1:27:34] of the tribe of judah
[1:27:37] has prevailed to take the book
[1:27:46] and to open the book
[1:27:48] [Applause]

[1:28:06] there is nowhere there is nowhere
[1:28:09] where god comes and takes the book
[1:28:12] and hands it to the devil
[1:28:14] but god takes the book
[1:28:17] and he hands it to us adam's fallen race
[1:28:21] he hands it to adam's fallen race
[1:28:24] and says welcome home
