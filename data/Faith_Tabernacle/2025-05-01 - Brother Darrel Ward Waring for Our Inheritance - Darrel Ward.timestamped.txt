[30:39] [Music]
[30:48] Lately, I've been looking back along
[30:53] this winding
[30:56] road to the old
[30:58] familiar
[31:00] markers and the mercies I have
[31:05] known. I know it might sound
[31:09] simple, but it's more than a
[31:14] cliche. There's no better way to tell
[31:19] you than to
[31:22] say God's been
[31:27] good in my life.
[31:32] I feel so blessed beyond my wildest
[31:36] dreams when I go to sleep each
[31:41] night. And though I've had my share of
[31:44] hard times, I wouldn't change them if I
[31:49] could. Cuz through it
[31:53] all, my God's been good.
[32:00] Times replay and I can see that I've
[32:04] cried some bitter
[32:07] tears. But I felt his arms around me as
[32:12] I face my greatest
[32:15] fears. You see, I've had my gains and

[42:14] He is
[42:17] awome. He is
[42:20] awome. Well, do you believe it this
[42:23] evening?
[42:25] Amen. Bless the name of the
[42:31] Lord. He
[42:34] has done so much for us in this age and
[42:38] made
[42:39] himself known to us. We're not serving a
[42:43] god of history or what someone has said
[42:46] about him, but we have personally
[42:49] witnessed him in this
[42:51] age. And that demands a response from us
[42:55] um as the bride of Christ to worship
[42:58] him, to magnify him. And you know, it's
[43:02] just a feeble effort to be able to sing
[43:05] songs, say that he's awesome. He's so
[43:09] more than awesome.
[43:11] He's he's just so good to us and um
[43:16] we're just uh really honored to have you
[43:19] all this uh evening and uh looking
[43:22] forward to what God has is in store for
[43:25] us and believing he's going to do great
[43:29] things. And uh I you know where two or
[43:32] three are gathered in his name, he
[43:35] promised that he would be with us and um
[43:39] Amen. And there's definitely more than
[43:40] two or three. And so I I know that
[43:44] whatever you have need of uh uh God is
[43:47] going to meet them needs. How much's
[43:49] come expecting God to do something for
[43:51] you? Amen. And um uh uh we uh just want
[43:57] to welcome you uh here and and uh we've
[44:00] just really been looking forward to
[44:02] having you all. And there's a um I was
[44:06] just reading a a a prayer that Brother
[44:08] Brandham prayed uh one of his sermons
[44:12] and I think it describes us here this
[44:15] evening that he said, "Heavenly Father,
[44:18] as the day is growing dim now, the signs
[44:21] of his appearing is at hand. We see the
[44:25] church, that little handful of elected
[44:27] called out, predestinated before the
[44:30] beginning of the world. names are put on
[44:33] the lamb's book of life before there was
[44:36] a foundation of the world. The Holy
[44:38] Spirit has sought through the nations
[44:40] and around the world until it's called
[44:43] this little group. And all the father
[44:46] has given me will come to me. And all
[44:49] that comes to me I give him everlasting
[44:52] life and raise him up at the last day.
[44:55] We see that little group gathering
[44:57] itself together out of every
[44:59] denomination, out of every church, out
[45:01] of every village. God getting his little
[45:04] group ready, letting the morning stars
[45:07] shine upon them as they see the
[45:09] approaching of the Lord
[45:12] Jesus. How many can identify that you're
[45:14] one of
[45:15] them? Amen. I'm so glad that God has
[45:19] called us out of this world and we're in
[45:23] a world of gross darkness and and people
[45:27] blinded and yet the shining star is
[45:32] shining upon us and I'm so glad for
[45:34] that. How many's come ready to hear the
[45:36] word of the Lord? Amen. I'm I'm ready.
[45:40] and and uh we've got brother Daryl Ward
[45:42] that's going to minister to us and we
[45:44] certainly appreciate uh Brother Daryl
[45:46] and his ministry and uh laboring for the
[45:51] kingdom of God preaching the message uh
[45:54] everywhere he goes. Amen. And I know
[45:56] we're not going to be disappointed
[45:57] tonight. And you know, Brother Brandham
[46:00] tells us that we pull on the gift. And
[46:02] uh and so uh you know, if you have, I
[46:06] know you may be a little bit tired and
[46:08] all, but uh uh just press past that
[46:10] tiredness. I don't think there needs to
[46:12] be any ice breaking here tonight. Uh uh
[46:15] we're believers and and so uh we just
[46:19] want Brother Daryl to to take his time
[46:21] and whatever the Lord has laid upon his
[46:23] heart, just preach to us. We're
[46:25] hungering. We're going to pull and we'll
[46:28] see God manifest himself. Can you say
[46:30] amen? Amen. So, let's just sing. Our God
[46:34] is
[46:37] awome. Oh,
[46:41] awome. He is
[46:45] awome. Oh,
[46:47] [Music]
[46:48] awome. Our God is
[46:52] awesome.
[46:53] [Music]
[47:03] Awesome. My God is
[47:07] [Music]
[47:09] awesome.
[47:13] Awesome.
[47:15] Awesome, our
[47:17] [Music]
[47:20] Lord. Amen.
[47:24] Amen. You know, that word don't even
[47:27] seem really adequate enough to
[47:29] describe just how great he is.
[47:33] What a privilege it is in this hour when
[47:35] the world don't even know what to
[47:37] believe anymore. And with this
[47:38] artificial intelligence, you look at
[47:40] something, you don't even know if it's
[47:41] real or not real. But I'm so glad that
[47:43] in all this era of fake news that we've
[47:45] got the good news.
[47:47] Amen. Aren't you grateful for that?
[47:49] Tonight we bring you greetings from my
[47:52] pastor, brother Donnie Reagan in the
[47:53] Word of Life Church down
[47:55] home. I just want to just make sure I
[47:57] say greetings to you.
[47:59] And certainly good to be here this
[48:02] evening with the elect of
[48:05] God, the bride of Jesus
[48:08] Christ, gathered together in heavenly
[48:11] places in Christ Jesus. Oh, ain't no
[48:15] better place to be.
[48:17] You know, there just something about a
[48:18] tent meeting.
[48:21] It's just a special atmosphere. You know
[48:23] what I mean? I was telling the brothers,
[48:26] my first experience I ever had with the
[48:28] with God was in a tent when I was a
[48:30] little
[48:31] boy, about three-year-old. My
[48:34] daddy, he was a tent boy for a man named
[48:37] Bobby
[48:40] Puit. And I just remember a little bit
[48:42] of it cuz I was, like I said, I was
[48:43] three.
[48:44] [Applause]
[48:45] It had rained and it was real muddy and
[48:47] I come around the tent and slid and fell
[48:49] on a tent stop, big old tent stop that
[48:53] and I broke my collar
[48:54] bone and of course crying. They took me
[48:57] into the tent and up on the sawdust and
[49:00] wheelchair ramp and I was muddy. I just
[49:02] remember parts of it. But this man named
[49:05] Bobby Puit prayed for me. When he did,
[49:08] God instantly healed me of a broken
[49:11] collar bone.
[49:15] If he can do that in that tent, he can
[49:18] do it in this tent.
[49:22] Amen.
[49:25] Amen. It's an honor to stand with these
[49:28] brothers who's bringing the word this
[49:30] week. And I certainly feel the least of
[49:32] all of them. And I want to thank brother
[49:34] Shawn and Faith Tabernacle for their
[49:36] labor of love to provide this special
[49:38] time of gathering for us. And may God
[49:40] bless them abundantly.
[49:42] for their labor, all those that cooked
[49:44] and all that's done. Thank you so much
[49:47] from the bottom of our hearts. And we
[49:48] just count it a real honor to be here.
[49:51] Glad to have my wife with me. Always
[49:53] good to have her here. And most
[49:55] important, so glad that he's here. If
[49:58] you have your Bibles this evening, turn
[50:00] with us to the book of 2 Corinthians.
[50:01] Want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter
[50:03] 6 verse
[50:06] 10. Thank you, buddy.
[50:11] 2 Corinthians 6:10 and then we're going
[50:13] to read from uh Genesis 22 starting at
[50:16] verse
[50:17] 15. May the Lord richly bless you be my
[50:20] prayer.
[50:36] The Bible says
[50:38] this, "As
[50:40] sorrowful yet always
[50:43] rejoicing. As
[50:45] poor yet making many
[50:48] rich, as having nothing yet
[50:52] possessing all things." All right.
[50:55] Genesis 22:15.
[50:59] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[51:00] Abraham out of heaven the second time
[51:03] and said, "By myself have I sworn,
[51:04] sayith the Lord, for because thou hast
[51:06] done this thing, that thou hast not
[51:08] withheld thy son, thine only son, that
[51:10] in blessing I will bless thee, and in
[51:12] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[51:14] the stars of heaven, and as a sand which
[51:16] is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall
[51:20] possess the gate of his enemies. and in
[51:24] thy seed shall all the nations of the
[51:26] earth be blessed. Why? Because thou hast
[51:31] obeyed my voice.
[51:34] Let us pray. I want to speak to you for
[51:37] a few minutes this evening on waring for
[51:40] our inheritance. Right.
[51:45] Heavenly
[51:47] Father, we are so grateful in our hearts
[51:50] to call you
[51:52] Father and thank you Lord for all that
[51:55] you've done for us. Yes. That Lord, we
[51:58] pray this evening that we could just get
[52:01] oursel out of the way, Lord, that you
[52:02] could speak to the hearts of your
[52:04] children. Lord, our faith could rise up
[52:06] and receive those things which already
[52:08] belong to us. And Lord, in the meetings
[52:11] this coming week, Lord, may you come
[52:13] among us, dear God. May you reignite the
[52:16] fire burning in the souls of your
[52:17] people. Father, Lord, may our sick be
[52:20] healed and the weak be made strong. May
[52:22] those dear God, who need the token, may
[52:23] it be applied this week, Lord, we pray.
[52:26] And Father God, those who are held in
[52:28] bondage, Lord, of
[52:30] addictions, may they be delivered, dear
[52:32] God. For Lord, when you went down into
[52:35] Egypt, you destroyed Pharaoh's army. You
[52:38] broke the chains of oppression and set
[52:40] your people free. And Lord, when you
[52:42] come to our Egypt, hallelujah, you will
[52:44] do the same thing for the God of the
[52:46] first Exodus is the God of this Exodus.
[52:49] We commit it into your hands for your
[52:51] glory. Bless you people. Now we pray.
[52:54] And the saints said, "Amen." God bless
[52:56] you. May be
[52:58] seated. Now, we understand by the
[53:00] scriptures that Abraham is the father of
[53:02] the
[53:03] faithful. And the promise was made to
[53:06] Abraham. And we are heirs to the promise
[53:09] through Christ. Now Abraham was faithful
[53:12] to his call and the promise of the word
[53:16] that God gave him. And the prophet of
[53:18] God said that he was an example to what
[53:20] we should be. For we being dead in
[53:24] Christ were Abraham's seed and heirs
[53:25] according to the promise according to
[53:27] Galatians 3:29. Now you cannot be the
[53:30] seed of Abraham without having the faith
[53:32] of Abraham. Oh, that's good. You cannot
[53:35] be the seed of Abraham without having
[53:37] the faith of Abraham. Now Abraham was
[53:39] just an ordinary man. At one time
[53:41] Abraham was actually an idol worshipper.
[53:44] So what does that tell us about God?
[53:46] That we serve a God who has transforming
[53:50] power. Now transforming power is the
[53:52] ability to bring about a dramatic
[53:55] change. We serve a God who has the
[53:57] ability to bring about a dramatic
[53:59] change. He can transform a drunk to a
[54:02] preacher. Ask me how I know that.
[54:04] Hallelujah. He can transform a drunk to
[54:06] a preacher. He can transform a street
[54:08] harlot to a lady. He can transform
[54:10] bitter water, transform bitter water and
[54:12] make it sweet. He can transform a sinner
[54:14] to a saint. He can transform the world
[54:16] when it was dark and void and make it a
[54:18] garden of Eden by the transforming power
[54:21] of the almighty God. Brother said that's
[54:23] the transforming power of God that he
[54:25] could take something that's nothing and
[54:28] make something wonderful out of it.
[54:30] God's transforming power. He took five
[54:32] biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000, not
[54:35] counting women and children. And the
[54:37] prophet of God said he took cooked fish
[54:39] and broke it off and it was still cooked
[54:41] fish. He took baked bread and broke it
[54:43] off and it was still baked bread. He
[54:45] said, "What kind of Adams did he let
[54:47] loose?" He was God, the creator of Adams
[54:50] and of all things. And God by his
[54:52] transforming power is going to take
[54:54] these old frail bodies of ours one of
[54:56] these days and he's going to change
[54:57] them. Hallelujah. in a moment, in a
[55:00] twinkling of an eye. Amen. Are you
[55:02] thankful for that tonight? And you young
[55:05] people sitting here, don't think you're
[55:06] going to be robbed. You're going to be
[55:07] transformed from youth to eternal youth
[55:11] by the transforming power of the
[55:14] almighty God. Ability to bring about a
[55:17] dramatic change, then we serve that God
[55:19] tonight. He's a He's able to bring about
[55:21] a dramatic change in this tent meeting
[55:23] this week. Amen. Now, we understand that
[55:25] the Bible that Abraham wasn't even
[55:27] looking for God. Yeah. But God came
[55:30] looking for Abraham. And as Abraham's
[55:33] seed, we can say the same thing. When
[55:36] Adam, the first son was lost, who came
[55:38] looking for him? God did. Then who comes
[55:41] looking for every lost son and daughter
[55:44] of God? God does. Then I ask you
[55:46] tonight, who came looking for you? Not a
[55:49] creed, not an organization, not a
[55:51] denomination, not a phone, but God
[55:53] himself. Amen. Has come looking for us?
[55:56] Amen.
[55:58] I never saw God. You never saw God. But
[56:00] it was always him seeking me. When I was
[56:03] lost in the darkness, he came and found
[56:06] me. Amen. And brought me into the light.
[56:08] Because God by his fornowledge knew that
[56:11] Abraham would believe him when he spoke.
[56:14] So God sought out Abraham because he
[56:16] knew Abraham would believe him. And God
[56:19] sought you out
[56:21] cuz you was predestinated to receive
[56:24] this message.
[56:27] You was born for such a time as this.
[56:30] This is our day, our hour, our season,
[56:32] our moment, the manifestation of the
[56:34] sons of God. That the same God that that
[56:37] was manifested in the bridegroom is now
[56:39] manifesting in the bride.
[56:41] Amen. Then let us be like Abraham and
[56:44] never doubt God when he speaks to us.
[56:48] Our emotions a lie to us. Sensations a
[56:50] lie to us. Feelings a lie to us.
[56:53] Governments a lie to us. Politicians
[56:57] They'll lie to us, but the word of God
[57:00] will never lie to us.
[57:02] Amen. God said to Abraham, "Because you
[57:06] have obeyed my voice,
[57:10] I have swore by myself, because there's
[57:12] nothing greater to swear by that thy
[57:15] seed shall possess the gate of his
[57:18] enemies."
[57:19] Not maybe, not hope so, not could be,
[57:22] but shall.
[57:23] Shall. And shall in the Bible is used to
[57:26] indicate a command or an obligation.
[57:30] All right. Hallelujah.
[57:32] Hallelujah. To indicate a command. You
[57:36] shall possess a command, an obligation.
[57:39] The same God that said, "Let there be
[57:40] light as a command and light come
[57:42] forth." That same God said, "You shall
[57:45] possess the gates of your enemies."
[57:49] Amen. Now, Abraham was heir to all by
[57:52] the promise so he could lay claim to
[57:55] everything that was in the land
[57:58] and the land itself. All right. Come on.
[58:02] Now, Abraham had been given a promise.
[58:05] Not an emotion, not a sensation, but a
[58:08] promise.
[58:10] Amen. Sorry about the buzz in there. I
[58:13] guess it's Amen. Amen. Now we understand
[58:16] Abraham. Think about this. He was the
[58:18] poorest man in all the country because
[58:21] he lived out there in the desert. And
[58:23] the prophet said he lived in peace with
[58:24] God. And Lot was rich and lived in the
[58:27] city and become a governor of the city.
[58:29] And he sat in the gate. He was a judge
[58:31] and judged the city and had all the
[58:33] riches of Leona if we could say it that
[58:35] way. But Abraham was in the desert. But
[58:38] it's in the desert place that God does
[58:40] his greatest miracles.
[58:43] Amen. The perhaps the prophet said the
[58:46] poorest man in all the land and yet a
[58:50] claim to possess it all.
[58:54] Yeah. This man probably didn't have $20
[58:57] to his name and yet he said, "You see
[58:59] all this? It's mine."
[59:03] Come on.
[59:06] Poor fellas lost his mind. He did. He
[59:08] did lose his mind. He got the mind of
[59:10] God.
[59:12] [Music]
[59:14] Hallelujah.
[59:16] Hallelujah. How could he believe that?
[59:19] How could a man that was living out in
[59:21] the desert, poorest man in the How could
[59:23] he possibly be believed that he owned it
[59:25] all? How could he claim that? How could
[59:28] he say this is all mine? I'll tell you
[59:30] why. Because God said so.
[59:32] [Applause]
[59:34] Oh, tonight we may not be rich in this
[59:36] world's goods, but we possess all things
[59:39] according to the Bible. The church
[59:41] itself possesses all things.
[59:46] Say it with me. The church The church
[59:48] possesses
[59:50] all things. All things.
[59:54] Oh my.
[59:56] Devil's nervous. He's dialing 911 on my
[59:58] watch.
[1:00:02] The prophet said, "I I say this, my
[1:00:05] friend, to every one of you, in the name
[1:00:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ, that every
[1:00:09] person in here was healed when Jesus
[1:00:12] died at Calvary. It's your possession."
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:19] Amen. Every Christian in here, you have
[1:00:22] a legal right to everything that Jesus
[1:00:25] died for. He died his death there at the
[1:00:29] cross. and gave that life that you and I
[1:00:32] might have a legal right to every
[1:00:34] redemptive blessing he died for. The
[1:00:38] prophet said it's yours. You're just
[1:00:40] afraid to possess it. You're just afraid
[1:00:43] to claim it. But let this be the week
[1:00:45] that fear is cast out. Amen. That you
[1:00:48] claim Hallelujah. You claim what you
[1:00:50] possess. Your legal rights to every
[1:00:52] redemptive blessing he died for.
[1:00:55] Hallelujah. Whatever you need, whatever
[1:00:58] you're facing, whatever situation you're
[1:01:01] in, whatever it would be, may it be met
[1:01:03] this week
[1:01:05] in the Jesus name.
[1:01:09] And one day the gentile kings declared
[1:01:13] war and they come into Solomon and
[1:01:15] declared Sodom declared war and took
[1:01:18] Lot, Abraham's nephew. Took him and
[1:01:20] Lot's wife and the children and all the
[1:01:21] rest of them and left the country. In
[1:01:24] Genesis 14:14, when Abram heard that his
[1:01:26] brother was taken captive and the
[1:01:29] prophet said, "Brother, I like that his
[1:01:30] brother," he he said, "look what Lot had
[1:01:33] done to him."
[1:01:36] But yet, there was some kind of a tie
[1:01:38] that binds. And Abraham went with the
[1:01:42] attitude, he's my brother. You know,
[1:01:45] during World War II, the Americans was
[1:01:47] being overran by the Germans, and they
[1:01:49] got the order to retreat. Now, I was in
[1:01:51] the military. Some of you brothers in
[1:01:53] the military, you know there's a code of
[1:01:54] conduct among soldiers. We leave no one
[1:01:57] behind. Many of good soldiers died on
[1:01:59] the battlefield trying to get a person
[1:02:01] off the field because it's a code of
[1:02:02] honor among brothers. We do not leave
[1:02:05] our wounded or our dead on the
[1:02:06] battlefield. No one's left behind. And
[1:02:09] so they had orders to retreat and there
[1:02:11] was a man wounded. And this young boy
[1:02:13] jumped up and went running out there and
[1:02:14] grabbed the man up and was trying to
[1:02:16] carry him. The man was bigger than him,
[1:02:18] heavier than him. He'd been shot through
[1:02:19] the hips and blood was pouring out of
[1:02:20] him. And it wasn't long till both of
[1:02:22] them was covered in blood. You couldn't
[1:02:23] even tell which one was shot. And the
[1:02:26] sergeant saw the young man. He said,
[1:02:27] "Soldier, drop that man. Drop that man.
[1:02:30] We We got to retreat to the rear. We'll
[1:02:32] get him later. If we stay here, we're
[1:02:33] all going to die." And he turned around
[1:02:36] and the boy was like a fireman's ladder.
[1:02:37] Had him up on his shoulder still trying
[1:02:39] to carry him. Waited the side. He turned
[1:02:41] around. He said, "Son, he drop that man.
[1:02:44] We'll get him later. We've got to go to
[1:02:46] the rear. We're all going to die. We're
[1:02:48] being overrun.
[1:02:51] And he turned around the third time. He
[1:02:52] said, "Son, as your non-commission
[1:02:54] officer, I command you, drop that man.
[1:02:57] He's too heavy for you to carry." And
[1:02:59] the boy yelled back and said, "Sarge, he
[1:03:02] ain't
[1:03:03] heavy. He's my
[1:03:05] brother." He was trying to get his
[1:03:07] brother off the battlefield. Perhaps he
[1:03:10] told Mama, before they left, she said,
[1:03:12] "Take care of Johnny. He ain't too
[1:03:13] smart." Yeah, mama. I'll make sure I
[1:03:15] bring him home. He was trying to keep a
[1:03:17] promise.
[1:03:18] And no matter what Lot had done, he was
[1:03:20] still Abraham's brother. And I say to
[1:03:23] you tonight, you're not heavy. You are
[1:03:25] my brother. I need you. You need me. We
[1:03:28] need one another.
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:33] When Abraham heard that he was in
[1:03:35] trouble, he went and got him. Now,
[1:03:37] Abraham's men were farmers, not
[1:03:40] warriors.
[1:03:42] 318 farmers
[1:03:44] went down after these kings who held Lot
[1:03:47] and his family.
[1:03:50] Now, why why in anyone's right mind
[1:03:54] would 300 farmers with rakes and
[1:03:57] pitchforks and axes and whatever more
[1:04:00] would go down against the army of king's
[1:04:03] armies?
[1:04:06] I'm not talking about boy scouts. I'm
[1:04:08] talking about these are the kings. You
[1:04:10] think the kings are going to have boy
[1:04:11] scouts around them guarding them?
[1:04:12] They're going to have the elite of the
[1:04:14] elite of the elite. The best of the best
[1:04:16] of the
[1:04:20] best and 318 farmers being led by
[1:04:24] Abraham went up against a bunch of kings
[1:04:27] and their armies.
[1:04:29] What made Abraham so sure, oh God, that
[1:04:33] he could win this battle?
[1:04:36] Because Abraham, come on, sir. Had a
[1:04:39] revelation that God had given him the
[1:04:42] land and all that was in it. And he
[1:04:44] acted on his belief that what God said
[1:04:47] was true. He acted on the word of God.
[1:04:52] And let us be that kind of a people.
[1:04:55] Amen.
[1:04:57] Not be a people who says wish to believe
[1:05:00] the word and never act on it.
[1:05:06] But let's be a people like Abraham who
[1:05:08] acted on the word that God gave him.
[1:05:11] Amen.
[1:05:12] Look at Noah. How do we know Noah
[1:05:14] believed God? How do we know he believed
[1:05:17] God? He built the boat before the rain
[1:05:19] ever fell.
[1:05:21] Hallelujah. Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] in the seed of Abraham. You can walk out
[1:05:28] of here testify and you're healed while
[1:05:30] you're still in pain because pain has
[1:05:33] nothing to do with it.
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:38] Look at Joshua before one rock ever come
[1:05:41] out of that building of the walls of
[1:05:42] Jericho. Joshua walked around the walls
[1:05:45] shouting the victory.
[1:05:47] Oh, there ought to be a shout in the
[1:05:49] camp tonight. We are not defeated. Come
[1:05:52] on, friends. We are not defeated. We are
[1:05:54] the overcomers.
[1:05:55] [Applause]
[1:05:57] How do we overcome? By the blood of the
[1:05:59] lamb and by our testimony. I am a son of
[1:06:03] God. I am a daughter of God.
[1:06:09] By faith, he saw the victory. He knew
[1:06:12] the walls was coming down because he was
[1:06:14] looking at the unseen. You see, you have
[1:06:17] two sets of eyes. The eyes of your head.
[1:06:19] That's what the devil uses to make sure
[1:06:21] you see the MRI and the X-ray and That's
[1:06:24] right. But God gave us another set of
[1:06:29] eyes. That's right. And we look at the
[1:06:31] unseen things.
[1:06:35] He He knew the walls was coming down
[1:06:37] because he's looking at the unseen. It
[1:06:38] was a promise that God made. Walking
[1:06:41] around shouting the victory. And the
[1:06:42] prophet said, "How much can you walk
[1:06:44] around that wheelchair? How much can you
[1:06:46] walk around that cancer? How much can
[1:06:47] you walk around that sin?" shouting the
[1:06:49] victory. God's give the promise when you
[1:06:51] can see him who is invisible. Amen.
[1:06:55] Hallelujah. How much can you walk around
[1:06:56] that diabetes? How much can you walk
[1:06:58] around that marital trouble? How much
[1:07:00] can Come on, somebody. How much can you
[1:07:01] walk around that fear and that bondage?
[1:07:03] Shouting the victory because God has
[1:07:05] already gave us the victory. Amen.
[1:07:11] When that pulsating comes into your
[1:07:13] heart and begins to pulsate,
[1:07:17] hallelujah.
[1:07:18] I am the Lord who health all thy
[1:07:20] diseases.
[1:07:22] Well, the doctor says it's incurable.
[1:07:24] That's what the doctor says. That's not
[1:07:26] what God said.
[1:07:28] I worked with doctors for years.
[1:07:32] They can be right and they can be wrong.
[1:07:35] That's what's called practicing
[1:07:37] medicine.
[1:07:40] Don't get me wrong, I still go to
[1:07:41] doctors. But when they say they can't
[1:07:43] help me, I know somebody who can. When
[1:07:46] they told me they couldn't help my
[1:07:47] daughter, I knew somebody who could. Oh,
[1:07:49] hallelujah.
[1:07:53] When you see that, I am the Lord thy
[1:07:55] God. He'll all die. When you see that,
[1:07:57] everything else just weakens away.
[1:08:01] God could tell Abraham that he was an
[1:08:03] heir to all the land because he knew
[1:08:05] Abraham would believe him. He was a
[1:08:08] possessor of the gate of his enemies.
[1:08:10] Why? Because God said so.
[1:08:13] He wasn't relying on 318 farmers with
[1:08:15] pitchforks. That wasn't what he was
[1:08:17] relying on to win this battle. He was
[1:08:19] trusting the God who made the promise.
[1:08:21] And listen, I'm not trusting here
[1:08:22] tonight. I'm not trusting in my ability.
[1:08:24] I ain't got no ability, but I'm trusting
[1:08:26] in a God who made the promise. Amen.
[1:08:29] I'll never leave you, nor will I forsake
[1:08:31] you. You may have trouble, but you'll
[1:08:33] not have it alone. I am with you.
[1:08:36] Yes.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:40] Glory. Glory. Abraham went after his
[1:08:42] nephew. He went after what belonged to
[1:08:45] him. Because he was a possessor of all
[1:08:48] that was in the
[1:08:50] land. Abraham had a right to the
[1:08:53] promise. And the promise was his. Yet he
[1:08:55] had to fight to possess. Amen. There you
[1:08:59] are. There you are. That's when it kind
[1:09:02] of gets quiet when you realize you've
[1:09:04] got to fight. Amen.
[1:09:07] That's right. Yet he had to fight to
[1:09:10] possess it. The prophet said, "There you
[1:09:11] are the believer today." Yet we're heir
[1:09:13] to all things.
[1:09:15] We're heir to every spiritual blessing,
[1:09:17] every physical blessing, every blessing
[1:09:20] the Bible promises.
[1:09:22] Yet you have to fight for every inch of
[1:09:26] it. That's the way God has got it set
[1:09:29] up. It's always been that way. You have
[1:09:32] to fight to possess what you know is
[1:09:35] your own.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah.
[1:09:41] Oh God, tonight give us strength, Lord,
[1:09:44] to fight to possess what we already own.
[1:09:48] Then if we have to fight, let our fight
[1:09:50] start tonight by our confession of what
[1:09:52] the word says is ours. That's where the
[1:09:55] fight will begin. That's where the
[1:09:56] battle begins is when you tell the
[1:09:58] devil, "This is my land. This is my
[1:10:00] property. That's my boy. That's my
[1:10:03] daughter. That's when the fight begins.
[1:10:05] But you've got to make that confession.
[1:10:07] Out of your own mouth, you'll be
[1:10:08] justified. Out of your own mouth, you'll
[1:10:10] be condemned. I say tonight, let's say
[1:10:12] what the word says. My word will fail.
[1:10:14] Your word will fail. God's word will
[1:10:16] never fail.
[1:10:24] Waring for our
[1:10:26] inheritance. When Abraham returned from
[1:10:29] the slaughter of the kings, the king of
[1:10:32] Sodom told him, he said, "Take the
[1:10:34] spoils." And Abraham said to the king of
[1:10:36] Sodom, "I'll not take a thread to a shoe
[1:10:39] latch. I don't want none of
[1:10:41] it." He didn't fight the war to make a
[1:10:44] lot of money.
[1:10:46] And real true battles are not made with
[1:10:49] selfish motives.
[1:10:54] Wars are not fought for money, but wars
[1:10:56] are fought for motives and for
[1:10:58] principles. Men fight war for
[1:11:01] principles. And when Abraham went out to
[1:11:03] get Lot, he didn't go because he knew he
[1:11:05] could whip the kings and take all their
[1:11:07] possessions. He went out for the
[1:11:09] principle of saving his
[1:11:13] brother. And any minister that's sent
[1:11:15] out under the inspiration of the king of
[1:11:17] heaven will not go for money.
[1:11:20] Neither will he go to make big churches.
[1:11:22] Neither will he go to inspire
[1:11:23] denominations. He'll go for one
[1:11:25] principle, and that's to bring back his
[1:11:27] fallen brother. Listen, I come to this
[1:11:29] service tonight with this principle to
[1:11:31] war against the devil. Not to get a
[1:11:33] name, not for popularity. I ain't
[1:11:34] interested in that. But to get my fallen
[1:11:37] brother, amen, the one that Satan has
[1:11:39] tied down and says there's no hope to
[1:11:41] loose him and let him go by the power of
[1:11:44] the name of
[1:11:45] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] Solomon said there's a time for peace
[1:11:52] and there's a time for war. Let these
[1:11:55] meetings this week be a time of war to
[1:11:58] war against Satan and his army.
[1:12:01] There's nothing wrong with fighting if
[1:12:04] you're fighting for the right
[1:12:07] principle. Abraham said, "I was reading
[1:12:09] at tombstone the other day in the
[1:12:10] museum. Saw the picture of Donabo. Many
[1:12:14] of you think Dono was a renegade. But to
[1:12:16] me, he was a genuine American. He was
[1:12:20] only fighting for that which God had
[1:12:22] gave him. Fighting for that which was
[1:12:24] right. That God had given him a land and
[1:12:26] a nation and a place to live. Not
[1:12:29] fighting for popularity. Not fighting
[1:12:31] for a name, but fighting for a land and
[1:12:33] a nation that God gave him.
[1:12:36] Said I don't blame him. And when those
[1:12:38] white soldiers come in there by force,
[1:12:39] took over the land, killing him out like
[1:12:41] a bunch of flies. And that was the
[1:12:42] original picture of Donimo's medical
[1:12:44] headquarters or his hospital. It was two
[1:12:46] or three pieces of blanket over a piece
[1:12:48] of mosquite and then wounded real
[1:12:50] genuine American Indians fighting for
[1:12:52] their god-given rights. And there Gerono
[1:12:54] with a baby of his own on his hip
[1:12:56] standing there looking up on his own
[1:12:57] warriors bleeding and dying with no
[1:12:59] penicellin or nothing to help them. No
[1:13:01] way to help them. A genuine God-given
[1:13:03] American. Then you call him a renegade.
[1:13:05] I call him a gentleman. We're not waring
[1:13:08] for selfish motives tonight. But Satan's
[1:13:10] took some of our possession. It's time
[1:13:12] for the seed of Abraham to rise up and
[1:13:14] get it back to declare war on hell and
[1:13:17] all its demons. This means war. Amen.
[1:13:21] You need to let the devil know tonight,
[1:13:23] you can't have my increase. You can't
[1:13:25] have my family. You can't have my
[1:13:26] health. You can't have my joy. You can't
[1:13:28] have my anointing. You can't have my
[1:13:30] ministry. You can't have my family. This
[1:13:32] means war.
[1:13:39] Brother Bram said the American Indian
[1:13:40] lost this land because they were divided
[1:13:43] among themselves. And Satan's tactic is
[1:13:46] always to divide and
[1:13:51] conquer. You one of my favorite
[1:13:53] characters in history, Dono. I guess you
[1:13:55] could tell
[1:13:57] that Gono invaded the United States Army
[1:14:00] and the Mexicans for 25 years. And when
[1:14:04] he surrendered, there's just a handful
[1:14:06] of them left. And they said it took an
[1:14:08] Apache to catch an Apache. So they went
[1:14:09] and got the what they call the White
[1:14:11] Mountain Apache. And they made them
[1:14:13] sergeants and corporals and privates and
[1:14:14] gave them guns and uniforms and sent
[1:14:16] them after Geronimo. And Dono, they
[1:14:18] never captured him. He finally
[1:14:20] surrendered, just tired. And they
[1:14:22] brought him in to the fort there. And
[1:14:24] the men who had brought him in, the army
[1:14:27] lined him up, stripped him of the rank,
[1:14:29] took the weapons away from him, and put
[1:14:31] them on the same train that Geronimo and
[1:14:33] his warriors was on and sent him to
[1:14:35] Florida. And on that train, one of the
[1:14:38] White Mountain Apaches spoke up to one
[1:14:40] of Derono's
[1:14:41] warriors. Said, "You was right not to
[1:14:43] trust the white eye." Everything he told
[1:14:46] us was a lie. That's right. And Don Mo's
[1:14:51] warrior spoke up and said, "I hate you.
[1:14:53] As long as there's breath in my body, I
[1:14:56] will hate you." So why didn't you leave
[1:14:58] us alone? We was living the way the
[1:14:59] great spirit made us live. This was our
[1:15:01] land, our way of life. We was just
[1:15:03] trying to survive in our way of life.
[1:15:05] Why did you not leave us
[1:15:07] alone? I'll hate you. As long as there's
[1:15:10] breath in my body, I will hate you. And
[1:15:13] they say, Donos spoke up and said, "Do
[1:15:15] not hate him. There's too few of us left
[1:15:18] to hate one another."
[1:15:21] Listen to me. Do not let Satan divide
[1:15:24] us. There are too few of us left. We are
[1:15:27] one in the spirit. We are one in the
[1:15:29] word. Oh God, let us unite. I say,
[1:15:32] Abraham, see, let's unite ourselves
[1:15:34] tonight in the promises of God's word.
[1:15:37] It's Christ in me helping you. It's
[1:15:39] Christ in you helping me.
[1:15:41] And let us fight for our brother. Let us
[1:15:43] fight for our sister. We are the seed of
[1:15:45] Abraham. And through the promise God
[1:15:47] swore to Abraham that thy seed shall
[1:15:50] possess the gate of his enemies.
[1:15:53] Say, "Brother Brandham, I need healing."
[1:15:55] The promise is yours, but if you ever
[1:15:56] get it, you ain't going to get it easy.
[1:15:58] I'm going to tell you that. You're going
[1:15:59] to have to take it away from Satan.
[1:16:01] Satan captures your health, you've got a
[1:16:03] right to go to Satan and say, "Give it
[1:16:06] back. Hand it over. I come in the name
[1:16:09] of the Lord.
[1:16:13] Possessor of heavens and earth, and I am
[1:16:15] his heir."
[1:16:19] Oh, ain't it good to know who your daddy
[1:16:20] is? Amen.
[1:16:24] Give it back, Satan. You took my child,
[1:16:26] got him mixed up with the wrong boy.
[1:16:28] Took my boy, got him mixed up with the
[1:16:30] wrong girl. I claim them. That's right.
[1:16:32] I claim my children. I claim my brother.
[1:16:35] I claim my sister. You've took them from
[1:16:37] God's house. Ced them out there, but I'm
[1:16:40] coming after them. I claim them.
[1:16:44] How do you know you can do that? How do
[1:16:48] you possibly know that you can stand up
[1:16:50] against Satan and say, "Get off my
[1:16:52] property. Give me back what belongs to
[1:16:55] me."
[1:16:58] Well, that's a good question. Let me
[1:17:00] share a little story with
[1:17:04] you. A few year ago over here in Wise
[1:17:07] Virginia, they was having a Melundian
[1:17:10] reunion. You know what a Melundian is?
[1:17:12] He's a tri-racial
[1:17:15] person. They having a Melian reunion up
[1:17:17] at Wise and a man by the name of Brent
[1:17:20] Kennedy who claimed to be a Melundian.
[1:17:22] He wrote a book called The Melundian,
[1:17:24] the resurrected of a proud people. They
[1:17:26] were tri-racial people. And so he was
[1:17:29] going to be up there at Wise for this
[1:17:30] reunion signing the book that he wrote.
[1:17:33] So me and my brother went up to the
[1:17:35] reunion cuz uh well we just
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:41] went. Hey, I go anywhere on earth and be
[1:17:44] at
[1:17:45] home. I'm certainly a Hind
[1:17:48] 57. But we went up to the reunion and oh
[1:17:52] some of you here remember brother Alfred
[1:17:53] Hall. You remember brother Alfred Hall?
[1:17:56] He's probably the darkest white man I've
[1:17:57] ever seen in my life. And me and my
[1:17:59] brother, we was walking up there wise
[1:18:01] and coming around there and I and I told
[1:18:02] my brother, I said, "I tell you right
[1:18:04] now, if anybody is at this reunion, it's
[1:18:07] Alfred
[1:18:10] Hall." And we come around the
[1:18:14] corner and here come Alfred Hall with a
[1:18:19] book in his hand. He done had it
[1:18:21] autographed. And I said, "I knew you'd
[1:18:23] be here." And he was laughing. He said,
[1:18:26] he said, "The man that wrote the book
[1:18:28] told me I was one of them."
[1:18:33] The man that wrote the
[1:18:35] You didn't get it.
[1:18:38] Let me Let me try that again. He came
[1:18:41] down through there laughing, holding the
[1:18:42] book in his hand. I said, "I knew you'd
[1:18:44] be here." He said, "The man that wrote
[1:18:46] the book said, I'm one of them."
[1:18:50] Oh, you say, "How can you stand so
[1:18:52] bold?" Because the man that wrote the
[1:18:54] book has told me, "I'm one of them."
[1:18:56] Amen. I'm one of them. I'm so glad that
[1:18:59] I can say, "I'm one of
[1:19:02] them. I'm an heir of all things. It's
[1:19:04] been given to me. I'm an heir." And not
[1:19:06] only am I an air, I am a joint air with
[1:19:09] Jesus Christ. That means whatever the
[1:19:11] father gave Jesus, that's what the
[1:19:13] father gave me. Hallelujah. I am a joint
[1:19:16] air with Jesus Christ. I am not a church
[1:19:20] member. I am not a cult. I am not an
[1:19:22] organization. I am a son of God.
[1:19:28] I can claim everything that God promised
[1:19:30] me. I can claim everything.
[1:19:34] I can claim my health. I can claim my
[1:19:36] revival. I can claim my victory. I can
[1:19:38] claim my family. I can claim
[1:19:40] deliverance.
[1:19:43] I can lay hands on the sick and they
[1:19:44] will recover.
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:19:48] How? Because the man that wrote the book
[1:19:50] said I can't.
[1:19:54] You need to serve notice on the devil
[1:19:56] tonight. You ain't getting my children.
[1:20:00] You ain't getting my children.
[1:20:03] You need to fight him tooth and nail.
[1:20:06] Well, brother D, what if he knocks my
[1:20:07] teeth out? Then gum him to death.
[1:20:11] But never give up. Never turn back.
[1:20:16] We're not in this thing to backslide.
[1:20:18] We're not in this thing to give up.
[1:20:19] We're not in this thing to get cold. We
[1:20:21] are on fire. Let the world come and
[1:20:23] watch us burn.
[1:20:26] Amen. Why? For we are warriors. We are
[1:20:30] warriors in the army of the Lord, chosen
[1:20:33] by God.
[1:20:36] This is not a volunteer army. This is an
[1:20:38] army chosen by election for such a time
[1:20:41] as this.
[1:20:44] Look, when I was in the army, I was in a
[1:20:47] combat
[1:20:50] unit. I was with the 18th Airborne Corp
[1:20:53] up at Fort Bragg, North
[1:20:54] Carolina. I was in a combat unit. Our
[1:20:56] life expectancy was something just a
[1:20:58] couple of minutes. We direct fire
[1:21:00] support for the 82nd. I was on a 155
[1:21:02] Hzer. That's why I can't hear good now.
[1:21:04] But when I was in the army, they gave me
[1:21:06] a steel pot. They gave me a rifle, an
[1:21:08] M16 with an 18 round banana cliff.
[1:21:13] They gave me combat boots. They gave me
[1:21:16] a pack on my
[1:21:18] back. But they gave me all this to serve
[1:21:21] my country, to fight for my country. But
[1:21:23] there's one thing they never gave me.
[1:21:26] You know what it was? A promise of
[1:21:28] victory. They said, "Take this stuff.
[1:21:31] Fight the best you can fight."
[1:21:34] But when I got into God's army, he gave
[1:21:36] me the helmet of salvation. He saw my
[1:21:38] feet with the preparation of the gospel.
[1:21:40] He gave me the sword. Hallelujah. And
[1:21:42] God gave me something the United States
[1:21:43] Army never gave me. You know what it
[1:21:45] was? A promise of victory. Look in the
[1:21:48] back of the book. No matter how bad it
[1:21:50] looks, we win. We
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:53] win. We are warriors in the army of
[1:21:58] God, chosen by God for such a time as
[1:22:02] this.
[1:22:04] And we know that through Isaac, the seed
[1:22:05] did possess the gates of his enemy. The
[1:22:07] natural seed of Abraham was Isaac. And
[1:22:09] through the seed Isaac, we find out they
[1:22:11] did possess the gates of their enemies.
[1:22:14] Why? Cuz God said they would.
[1:22:17] And the spiritual types, the natural
[1:22:20] types, the spiritual.
[1:22:23] Joshua, brother Abraham, talking about
[1:22:24] Joshua said, "God's given every sick
[1:22:26] person in here divine healing. Every one
[1:22:27] of you. Jesus is wounded for our
[1:22:29] transgressions. With his stripes, we're
[1:22:30] healed. It's yours, but you'll have to
[1:22:32] fight for every inch you possess.
[1:22:33] Everywhere the souls of your feet
[1:22:35] travel." God told Joshua, "I have given
[1:22:37] you." Footprints means possession.
[1:22:40] We need to be walking around.
[1:22:43] Ain't no time to sit down.
[1:22:45] Footprints means possession. Let's move
[1:22:47] in tonight. Let's go in. Footprints is
[1:22:50] possession. Let's take every inch of
[1:22:53] ground that God's gi us.
[1:22:56] If you haven't got the Holy
[1:22:58] Ghost, Peter said, "The promise is unto
[1:23:00] you and to your children, even as far
[1:23:02] off as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:23:03] call footprints his possession. Let's go
[1:23:06] get it. It's ours. Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:08] yesterday, today, and forever. Let's
[1:23:10] possess it. The works I do, shall you do
[1:23:12] also. Let's possess it. You shall
[1:23:14] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:16] Let's possess it. You will be changed in
[1:23:18] a moment, in a twinkle of an eye. Let's
[1:23:20] possess it. You shall lay your hands
[1:23:22] upon the sick and they shall recover.
[1:23:24] Let's possess it. These are our
[1:23:25] God-given rights as believers.
[1:23:30] Don't look at the circumstances. Don't
[1:23:32] look at how hard it is. Faith masters
[1:23:35] every circumstance.
[1:23:38] Don't look at the storm.
[1:23:41] Look at the sun.
[1:23:44] Not long ago when I was flying to a
[1:23:46] meeting. We had to land in Charlotte
[1:23:48] because the weather was so
[1:23:49] bad. These people screaming, crying,
[1:23:52] everything else on this plane. We landed
[1:23:54] and sat there for a while. Finally, it
[1:23:55] cleared up a little bit. We could take
[1:23:56] off again. We come up out of that. That
[1:23:59] plane was a reeling and a rocking and a
[1:24:00] dropping and people was a yelling. But
[1:24:03] all at once, we broke through the
[1:24:04] clouds. And guess what? I saw the sun.
[1:24:10] It was always there.
[1:24:13] But the devil wants you to see the bad
[1:24:14] report. He just wants you to see the
[1:24:16] storm clouds. He just wants you to see
[1:24:17] the darkness and the gloom and the doom.
[1:24:19] But don't look at that. Look at the sun.
[1:24:20] Amen. The sun is up. Amen.
[1:24:24] Let's possess the land.
[1:24:28] The man that wrote the book, he says
[1:24:29] that we're called, we're chosen, we're
[1:24:31] elected, predestinated, an invincible
[1:24:34] army.
[1:24:37] Can we possess what the words is ours?
[1:24:39] That the word says is ours. The man that
[1:24:42] wrote the book said we can.
[1:24:46] Well, I don't feel it. He never said,
[1:24:47] "Did you feel it?" He said, "Did you
[1:24:49] believe it?" And if you believed it, you
[1:24:51] might actually start feeling it.
[1:24:54] Your emotions a lie to The sensation is
[1:24:56] a lie to you.
[1:24:58] But not God's word. Joshua fought for
[1:25:00] every rich ground from one end of the
[1:25:02] country to the other one. But he had a
[1:25:03] promise. God said, "I give it to you."
[1:25:06] Whether there's giants, whether there's
[1:25:07] atheists, whether there's infidels,
[1:25:08] whether there's cold formal churches,
[1:25:10] what difference does it make? God, give
[1:25:13] the promise. Let's take it. It's ours.
[1:25:15] It belongs to us. It's our possession.
[1:25:19] Let's go get it. Don't be afraid. Don't
[1:25:21] stay back and say, "Well, I I don't
[1:25:22] know. I don't know if it'll work." Don't
[1:25:24] do that. That's a hybrid faith. Jesus
[1:25:26] never died to give us a hybrid faith,
[1:25:28] but he died and resurrected that we
[1:25:30] might have faith in what the word says.
[1:25:32] Amen.
[1:25:34] Let's take the land. Let the fire fall.
[1:25:37] Let revival break out. Let the sick be
[1:25:39] healed. Let the lost be. Declare war
[1:25:42] this week. Declare war on Satan. And go
[1:25:46] get back what he stole from you.
[1:25:49] Yeah. Hallelujah.
[1:25:52] The Hebrew children, they possessed the
[1:25:55] gates of the fiery furnace that it
[1:25:58] couldn't even burn them. Daniel
[1:26:00] possessed the enemy's gates that the
[1:26:02] lion's mouth could not even be opened.
[1:26:05] The same God that was with them is with
[1:26:07] us
[1:26:11] tonight. They thought they had Samson
[1:26:13] surrounded one time. Probably said he
[1:26:15] was just a shrimp, a mama's boy. thought
[1:26:17] they had him surrounded, but he lifted
[1:26:18] up the gates, put him on his shoulders,
[1:26:21] marched up the hill. I forget how many
[1:26:22] miles it was. Five, seven something
[1:26:24] miles. I forget. Marched up the hill,
[1:26:26] threw the gates down. Said, "You boys
[1:26:28] want your gates? Come up here and get
[1:26:34] them." Amen. He had a promise that he
[1:26:38] was a seed of Abraham and the seed of
[1:26:40] Abraham shall possess the gates of his
[1:26:42] enemy.
[1:26:45] Amen. What warriors of faith? What
[1:26:48] warriors of faith? Sometimes we get in
[1:26:49] our mind go Daniel and we get a David
[1:26:51] and we we put them way up here and oh
[1:26:53] there such and they did do great things
[1:26:55] for God. I'm not be little on that. But
[1:26:56] what you've got to realize is David was
[1:26:58] just a man like me and you. He's only a
[1:26:59] teenager when he slew a giant.
[1:27:02] They was just men like we are who
[1:27:04] believed God for their day. And when
[1:27:06] they took God at his word, God performed
[1:27:09] miracles in their life.
[1:27:12] You know, I was talking about Don a
[1:27:13] while ago. You mentioned Dono and people
[1:27:14] get in their mind of a man on a horse, a
[1:27:16] warrior, you know, with feathers and all
[1:27:18] that. But how many knows Dono drove a
[1:27:20] car? Didn't know that, huh? How many
[1:27:22] knows Dono was in the World's Fair? How
[1:27:25] many knows Dono was in Teddy Roosevelt's
[1:27:27] inauguration
[1:27:29] parade? He wore a top hat and drove a T-
[1:27:32] Model
[1:27:33] Ford. Geronimo, the warrior Gonimo, he
[1:27:37] was just a man fighting for his Godgiven
[1:27:41] rights.
[1:27:43] Amen. Amen. You said, "Brother, I'm just
[1:27:47] a housewife. I'm just a farmer. I'm just
[1:27:48] a painter. I'm just a I'm just an
[1:27:50] evangelist." That's what you see. But
[1:27:53] what does God see? He sees a
[1:27:57] warrior. Amen. All these great men of
[1:28:00] God, they died in faith. Fine warriors
[1:28:02] of faith. They all died. But I'm
[1:28:04] thinking of another seed just for a few
[1:28:06] minutes. The seed of Jesus Christ, the
[1:28:08] royal seed. What did he do? probably
[1:28:10] said he took all the gates of the enemy.
[1:28:12] He took the gate of sickness. Sickness
[1:28:14] could not exist in his presence. No sir.
[1:28:15] Neither could anything else exist in his
[1:28:17] presence. A funeral possession could not
[1:28:19] stand in his presence. No. What did he
[1:28:20] do? Joshua died. Moses died. All the
[1:28:22] rest of them died. But not this royal
[1:28:25] seed. His precious soul descended into
[1:28:27] hell where our altar went. But on that
[1:28:29] day, Samson took the gates of the city
[1:28:31] on his back. Had nothing to do with
[1:28:32] this. He took the gates of hell, the
[1:28:34] gates of the grave, and everything else.
[1:28:35] He didn't pack it up on a mountain, but
[1:28:37] he destroyed it. Hallelujah. He
[1:28:39] possessed the gate of the enemy. The
[1:28:41] atmosphere was filled with devil power
[1:28:43] above that angels or nothing could come
[1:28:44] down. There could be no intercession
[1:28:45] because the blood of goats would not
[1:28:47] take away sin. But his own blood took
[1:28:49] away sin. And he ascended up on high
[1:28:51] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:28:54] men. Now everyone of Abraham's seed
[1:28:56] that's willing to pay the price to come
[1:28:58] down, repent of their sins, be baptized
[1:29:00] in the name of Jesus Christ, receive the
[1:29:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and stand the
[1:29:04] test.
[1:29:06] And when he become, he possessed every
[1:29:08] gate. The gate of sickness, the gate of
[1:29:10] death, the gate of hell, the gate of
[1:29:12] temptation, the gate of the grave. He
[1:29:13] possessed every gate and freely gives it
[1:29:17] to us.
[1:29:20] Then who owns the gates tonight? We do.
[1:29:23] We do. And I say it's time we open up
[1:29:26] the gates.
[1:29:28] Hallelujah. He's made us more than
[1:29:30] conquerors to him that loves us. The man
[1:29:33] that wrote the book said, "Satan cannot
[1:29:35] deceive us whose names have been written
[1:29:38] in the book of life from the foundation
[1:29:40] of the world." The same God that spoke
[1:29:43] Christ was crucified before the
[1:29:44] foundation of the world. That same one
[1:29:46] called you at that time and wrote your
[1:29:49] name in that book. The prophet said he
[1:29:52] wrote your name with his before the
[1:29:55] foundation of the world. How can we
[1:29:59] lose?
[1:30:01] How can we be timid? Oh God, give us a
[1:30:03] backbone of faith to meet the challenge
[1:30:06] of this hour to say to Satan, "No more.
[1:30:08] You'll not come against my marriage no
[1:30:10] more. You'll not come against my family
[1:30:12] no more." Come on, somebody. We're the
[1:30:14] seed of Abraham. It's time we act like
[1:30:16] it.
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:19] How can we lose no matter how bad it
[1:30:21] look in the back of the book? It's win.
[1:30:22] We win. We win.
[1:30:26] This means war. We need to tell Satan,
[1:30:29] "You are under my feet."
[1:30:35] Several years ago, when my little girl
[1:30:37] Allison was just a little old thing,
[1:30:39] about six-year-old, I was preaching up
[1:30:41] at Phelps,
[1:30:42] Kentucky. After service, we standing
[1:30:44] outside talking to brother Eddie and
[1:30:45] brother Tom and him. Ally was standing
[1:30:47] beside me, a little old thing about like
[1:30:48] this right here. And we was just talking
[1:30:50] and Ally
[1:30:52] goes, I go, "A Allison, don't do that."
[1:30:56] I said something else. She
[1:30:57] goes, I said, "Allison, don't do that."
[1:31:01] And I said, "Some else." She goes, I
[1:31:04] said, "Allison, you're ruining my
[1:31:05] ministry. What are you
[1:31:07] doing?" She goes, "It's a bug, Daddy.
[1:31:09] It's a bug." And I looked down this bug.
[1:31:11] She's trying to stomp that bug. And
[1:31:13] that's what you need to realize tonight.
[1:31:14] Satan ain't nothing but a bug. And
[1:31:16] somebody needs to stomp him down.
[1:31:17] Somebody needs to put him under his
[1:31:18] feet. I don't care if you're just the
[1:31:20] souls of the feet of the body of Christ.
[1:31:22] Every devil, every demon, every power is
[1:31:24] under our feet. Amen. We are the
[1:31:26] victorious bride of Jesus Christ. This
[1:31:29] means war.
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:33] Shamgard. When 600 Philistines come
[1:31:35] against you, he said, I am the seed of
[1:31:37] Abraham.
[1:31:38] And he slew 600 Philistines that tried
[1:31:41] to take his lead. And if Shamgard could
[1:31:44] do that, being the natural seed of
[1:31:46] Abraham, what about you and I tonight
[1:31:48] who are the royal seed of Abraham?
[1:31:54] If the natural seed can take that much
[1:31:56] courage, what ought the royal seed do
[1:31:59] with the presence of the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:01] his anointing around us showing himself
[1:32:07] alive. We not be rich in world's goods,
[1:32:10] but we possess all
[1:32:14] things. Father said, I like that they
[1:32:17] possess it. I like possessors of the
[1:32:18] earth. What is it? The believer. The
[1:32:20] believer has a title. Abstract dream.
[1:32:22] That's right. By Jesus Christ that he
[1:32:23] shall be possessor of the entire
[1:32:27] universe.
[1:32:33] Even the speakers amen
[1:32:35] that of the
[1:32:38] entire universe.
[1:32:44] How can you say that? The man who wrote
[1:32:46] the book said
[1:32:47] so. That's right. Not because you joined
[1:32:50] the
[1:32:51] church, but because God by his
[1:32:53] fornowledge elected you and called you
[1:32:55] to Jesus and you accepted it. Can I have
[1:32:59] just five more minutes? I'll close.
[1:33:01] Here. Not long ago, me and Cheryl, the
[1:33:03] girls was in a
[1:33:05] restaurant and the waitress come up and
[1:33:07] she said, "Will there be anything else?"
[1:33:08] And I said, "No, ma'am. Just just the
[1:33:11] ticket."
[1:33:13] She said, "Well, somebody saw you in
[1:33:15] here and they paid for your
[1:33:18] meal. So, if there's nothing else,
[1:33:21] you're free to
[1:33:23] go." And I said, "Well, let let me take
[1:33:26] care of the tip." No, no tip. Everything
[1:33:29] Everything's already been took care of.
[1:33:31] It's already been paid for. So, if
[1:33:33] there's nothing else, you can walk right
[1:33:35] out that door and
[1:33:38] leave. Now, I could have argued. I could
[1:33:41] have said, "Ma'am, I don't see nobody in
[1:33:43] this restaurant that I know. Are you
[1:33:45] sure you're talking about me? Are you
[1:33:46] sure this is my table?
[1:33:49] You want me to walk out that door and
[1:33:50] that bell go ding ding ding?" Say, "He
[1:33:52] stole a
[1:33:54] steak. I could have argued. I could have
[1:33:56] debated. I could have even tried to pay
[1:33:58] for it myself." Yeah. Or I could accept
[1:34:02] the fact that someone paid the price for
[1:34:04] my meal
[1:34:08] and accept it and believe it and confess
[1:34:10] it and walk right out that door with a
[1:34:13] belly full of steak. So what do you
[1:34:15] think I did?
[1:34:18] I walked right out that door with a
[1:34:19] belly of steak. And if you can believe
[1:34:21] it tonight, friends, the same principle
[1:34:23] applies that Jesus Christ paid the price
[1:34:25] for everything we have need of. It's
[1:34:27] already been paid for. Life is mine. He
[1:34:30] paid for it. Life is yours. He paid for
[1:34:32] it. Healing is mine. He paid for it.
[1:34:34] Healing is yours. He paid for it.
[1:34:36] Freedom is mine. He paid for it. Freedom
[1:34:37] is yours. He paid for it. It's already
[1:34:40] been paid for. Every person in here can
[1:34:42] be well. Every person here can be
[1:34:44] healed. Every person here can be
[1:34:45] delivered. Every person here can be
[1:34:47] saved. He paid the price. And all he
[1:34:49] ever asked us to do was to believe it
[1:34:51] and accept it and confess it. The ABCs
[1:34:54] of your deliverance. Accept it. Believe
[1:34:57] it.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] Do you love him tonight? Oh, seed of
[1:35:09] Abraham, rise up this week and take back
[1:35:12] what belongs to you. Declare war on
[1:35:14] Satan and his army. This means war. If
[1:35:17] you believe it
[1:35:19] tonight, then confess it, accept it, and
[1:35:22] confess it in Jesus name.
[1:35:26] It's already been paid for.
[1:35:31] You can walk right out that door. I know
[1:35:33] you've heard this before, but it comes
[1:35:35] on every time I mention it, it comes on
[1:35:37] my mind. I was in Chievac, Alaska. And
[1:35:39] I'll close with
[1:35:41] this. There's a young girl about 21 year
[1:35:43] old. She came
[1:35:46] up and I said, "Sis, you need something
[1:35:48] from the
[1:35:50] Lord?" She said, "I'm an alcoholic."
[1:35:54] said, "I cannot quit
[1:35:57] drinking. I've been through the 12step
[1:35:59] program nine different times and I stay
[1:36:03] sober for a while and I go right back to
[1:36:05] drinking again. I've tried everything. I
[1:36:08] cannot quit drinking." And she began to
[1:36:12] tear up. She said, "I've got a little
[1:36:14] boy. I don't even know who the daddy is
[1:36:17] cuz he conceived when I was drunk."
[1:36:20] said, "I woke up in places I shouldn't
[1:36:22] be
[1:36:23] in cuz I was drunk." Said, "I cannot
[1:36:27] quit drinking. I've tried everything." I
[1:36:31] said,
[1:36:33] "Sis, have you tried
[1:36:35] Jesus?" I said, "You take the alcohol,
[1:36:38] you lay it right here at this at this
[1:36:40] altar, and you take your
[1:36:43] freedom." And I began to pray for that
[1:36:46] girl. I'll never forget this as long as
[1:36:47] I live.
[1:36:49] She began to scream to the top of her
[1:36:52] lungs, "I'm
[1:36:53] free. I'm free.
[1:36:57] I'm
[1:36:59] free." I was over about two years later.
[1:37:02] She came up to me. She said, "But I've
[1:37:04] been there. It's two years and I'm still
[1:37:11] sober."
[1:37:13] Those the sun makes
[1:37:16] free is free indeed. Let's stand to our
[1:37:20] feet tonight. Let's stand to our feet
[1:37:22] tonight. Amen. Do you believe that?
[1:37:26] How many believe what I preached
[1:37:27] tonight? This is not my word. This is
[1:37:30] our father's word. I just come and
[1:37:32] rehearsed in your ears what daddy has
[1:37:34] already told us tonight. And the Bible
[1:37:36] said, "These signs shall follow them
[1:37:38] that believe. They shall lay their hands
[1:37:41] upon the sick and they shall recover.
[1:37:45] And let's just start this meeting off
[1:37:47] right this week. Let's just start it off
[1:37:49] with some good healings. Amen. Some good
[1:37:52] revival, some good fire. We don't have
[1:37:55] to wait till the last day. You can get
[1:37:57] it right now. For whom the son has made
[1:38:00] free is free indeed. It's already been
[1:38:04] paid for. There's nothing else. Brother
[1:38:05] Bam, how many times did he tell us if he
[1:38:07] stood here in this suit that he gave me,
[1:38:09] he could not heal you? You're already
[1:38:12] healed.
[1:38:18] But now, you think he can heal me? Well,
[1:38:21] you just believe
[1:38:23] him. Accept it, believe it, and confess
[1:38:27] it. The
[1:38:29] ABCs of our healing. Do you love him
[1:38:32] tonight? Let's just bow our
[1:38:37] heads. Heavenly
[1:38:41] Father, Lord, I thank you for such an
[1:38:44] attentive audience,
[1:38:47] Lord. For truly, Father, I
[1:38:51] realize that I'm the least of the
[1:38:55] brethren. But Lord, these words I spoke
[1:38:57] tonight are not my
[1:38:59] words. They're your words that I just
[1:39:01] rehearsed in their ears.
[1:39:05] But Lord, I believe this is our time and
[1:39:07] our
[1:39:08] season. This is when the sons of God are
[1:39:10] to manifest upon the earth. The same
[1:39:13] anointing that was upon the
[1:39:15] bridegroom is now upon the bride, making
[1:39:18] you the same yesterday, today, and
[1:39:21] forever. And Lord, you said,
[1:39:24] "These works I do shall you do also, and
[1:39:26] greater works than these shall you do."
[1:39:30] And Lord, it couldn't be nothing greater
[1:39:32] than to raise the dead and open blinded
[1:39:34] eyes and make the lame walk. But your
[1:39:37] prophet taught us that greater meant
[1:39:39] more. Because when you was here, those
[1:39:41] things was done in a body called Jesus.
[1:39:44] But now more works are being done in a
[1:39:46] body called the bride. A universal bride
[1:39:49] where the dead are being raised and
[1:39:50] cancers are disappearing. Blinded eyes
[1:39:53] are coming open and the lame are getting
[1:39:54] out of wheelchairs. Drunks are coming
[1:39:57] home. Drug addicts are being set free.
[1:39:59] cutters no longer cut yourself because
[1:40:02] that anointing that was upon the
[1:40:03] bridegroom thus rest upon the bride and
[1:40:05] Lord we are your people. We are your
[1:40:06] children and we believe that tonight,
[1:40:09] Lord. But I pray in the name of Jesus,
[1:40:11] let the fire fall this week, God, that
[1:40:14] it set every soul on fire. I pray, oh
[1:40:16] God, hear my cry tonight, Lord
[1:40:20] Jesus. Oh Lord, set us on fire with the
[1:40:23] Holy Ghost once again. Lord, don't let
[1:40:25] us cool
[1:40:26] off. Oh God, it's too late. Let us hear
[1:40:30] that cloud of witnesses as they cry,
[1:40:31] "You can make it. You can overcome. This
[1:40:33] is your hour. This is your day. Let us
[1:40:36] run, dear God, with everything that's
[1:40:38] within us and finish the course that's
[1:40:40] set before us. Grant it, Father God,
[1:40:43] tonight I pray in Jesus name. If you're
[1:40:47] here, friend, if you have a
[1:40:49] need, I just wonder if you just slip
[1:40:51] your hand up, said, "Father, I have a
[1:40:53] need tonight. I've got this affliction.
[1:40:55] I've got this. I don't have to know what
[1:40:57] it is, friend. He knows what it is
[1:41:01] tonight. You just lift your hand up.
[1:41:03] Say, would you remember me in prayer?
[1:41:05] Maybe you've got cold on the Lord. Maybe
[1:41:06] you've let something come between you
[1:41:08] and your God. You've let it
[1:41:11] slip, but let this be the week. Let this
[1:41:14] be the night that this meeting start off
[1:41:15] right. Let you reconsecrate yourself to
[1:41:17] the Lord. I just want you to slip me in
[1:41:19] your head. Say, Lord, set me on fire
[1:41:20] again, God. Revive me. Renew me again,
[1:41:24] Lord. Just lift up your hand. God bless
[1:41:26] those hands. If you're here, you need
[1:41:29] the Holy Ghost. I wonder if you just
[1:41:30] raise your hand tonight.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:39] Hallelujah. Now, here's what I want us
[1:41:41] to do. Won't you reach over and take a
[1:41:44] hosting hand beside you there, brother
[1:41:46] to brother, sister, sister, family,
[1:41:47] however it would be, and let's just pray
[1:41:49] for one another. We Let's exercise our
[1:41:52] God-given rights tonight.
[1:41:54] Let's go to the heart of the enemy.
[1:41:56] You're a soldier. You're a
[1:41:58] soldier. Take the word of God tonight.
[1:42:02] Slay that thing that holds your friend
[1:42:04] down. Slay that thing that holds your
[1:42:06] husband down, your wife down, whatever
[1:42:07] it would be tonight in the name of
[1:42:10] Jesus. Will you do it? Let's just pray
[1:42:12] together. Can we? Almighty
[1:42:15] God, creator of heavens and earth, giver
[1:42:18] of every good gift, the author and
[1:42:20] finisher of our faith. Oh Lord God, I
[1:42:22] believe tonight, Lord, you are the
[1:42:24] author of this word, Lord Jesus. And you
[1:42:26] have told us these things through the
[1:42:28] lips of your prophet. And we stand here
[1:42:29] tonight. I believe, dear God, that we
[1:42:31] are the bride of Jesus Christ. I believe
[1:42:34] we're chosen, predestinated, elected for
[1:42:36] such a time as this. Not to quit, not to
[1:42:39] backslide, not to give up, but to
[1:42:41] overcome. And Father, we have come and
[1:42:42] are appointed post of duty tonight. And
[1:42:44] we lay hands upon our brother and upon
[1:42:46] our sister tonight. And Father, by that
[1:42:48] same anointing that raised my Lord from
[1:42:50] the grave by that same anointing, dear
[1:42:52] God, that raised my daughter up and gave
[1:42:54] her back to me. May that same anointing
[1:42:56] tonight move upon every heart, upon
[1:42:58] every home, upon every life. Oh God, may
[1:43:01] the chains be broke. May oppression be
[1:43:03] broke. May high blood pressure, low
[1:43:05] blood pressure, danger to diabetes,
[1:43:07] glaucoma, whatever, arthritis, whatever
[1:43:10] it would be tonight, a besetting sin,
[1:43:12] may leave them in the name of Jesus
[1:43:15] Christ. Satan, you've lost the battle. I
[1:43:17] rebuke you in the name of Jesus. Come
[1:43:20] out of the people tonight. You have no
[1:43:22] hold on us. We are believers. We are
[1:43:25] sons and daughters of God. And we stand
[1:43:27] at a post of duty tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:43:30] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord God
[1:43:32] Almighty. Blessed be the name who raises
[1:43:35] the dead and opens the eyes of the
[1:43:36] blind. You are my God. You're the
[1:43:39] captain of this army, Lord. Oh, we
[1:43:42] believe it tonight. Satan, I truly God,
[1:43:45] lead the people tonight. that a revival
[1:43:47] break out that'll shake Christian
[1:43:49] Blackburg once more and the power of God
[1:43:53] that they may know there is a God there
[1:43:56] is a God among his people who still does
[1:43:59] wonders in the name of Jesus in the name
[1:44:03] of Jesus.
[1:44:05] Amen.
[1:44:08] Prosper oh when darkness falls it won't
[1:44:13] prevail.
[1:44:16] Cuz the God I serve knows only how to
[1:44:23] triumph. Oh, and my God will never
[1:44:29] fail.
[1:44:31] Oh my God will never

[1:44:45] victory for the battle belongs to you,
[1:44:51] Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a
[1:44:55] victory. I'm going to see a victory
[1:45:00] tonight for the battle. My brother
[1:45:05] God, I ask you in the name of Jesus, may
[1:45:08] you touch our brother tonight, Lord God.
[1:45:09] There's power in Lord tonight. Let me
[1:45:13] get a report that all will cuz that's
[1:45:15] the kind of God that you are Lord. And
[1:45:17] every war tonight he
[1:45:20] wages Lord there in the hospital. I pray
[1:45:23] in Jesus name. I'm not backing down. Oh,
[1:45:27] can we worship him tonight? Can we
[1:45:29] worship him tonight? Amen. Cuz I know
[1:45:33] how this story
[1:45:36] ends. Yeah. Yes, I know how this story
[1:45:43] ends. Oh, I'm going to see a

[1:46:07] victory for the battle belongs to you,
[1:46:15] Lord. There's power in the mighty name
[1:46:20] of

[1:48:04] prevail.
[1:48:07] Hallelujah. Cuz the God I serve knows
[1:48:10] only how to
[1:48:14] triump. And my God will never fail.

[1:48:29] to see a
[1:48:31] victory. I'm going to see a
[1:48:36] victory. For the battle belongs to you,
[1:48:42] Lord. Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[1:48:47] Yes, I'm going to see a
[1:48:51] victory for the
[1:48:53] battle belongs to the
[1:48:59] Lord.
[1:49:01] Hallelujah.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful
[1:49:06] tonight? Hallelujah. Our God, when the
[1:49:10] doctor says there's no
[1:49:12] hope, our God causes him to say it's a
[1:49:16] miracle. That right, brother Rod, when
[1:49:19] the doctor says your daughter will never
[1:49:21] see again, our God has them doctors to
[1:49:24] say it's a
[1:49:27] miracle. You are a
[1:49:30] miracle. Amen. Aren't you glad today?
[1:49:33] You said, "Bro, darling, if he loves us
[1:49:34] so much, why do we have all these
[1:49:36] problems? Why do we have all this
[1:49:37] trouble? Because you see, can I just
[1:49:39] share this and I turn over to brother
[1:49:41] Sean? Cuz you see, God could say, "I'm
[1:49:43] your healer. I'm your deliverer." And we
[1:49:45] would say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord." But
[1:49:46] that's an intellectual conception. But
[1:49:48] God doesn't want us to know it by
[1:49:50] knowledge. You'll never know God by
[1:49:52] knowledge. You know God by faith. Is
[1:49:54] that right? So God wants us to
[1:49:56] experience that so that we can say by
[1:49:58] experience, "Our God is a healer." Let
[1:50:00] me show you what I mean. When Jessica's
[1:50:02] eyes come open, I kept telling her,
[1:50:03] "You'll see me one day." And one day her
[1:50:05] eyes came open and somebody heard the
[1:50:06] story because I told everybody, you
[1:50:08] know, that that that I said, "Jessica,
[1:50:10] you'll see me again cuz God provided a
[1:50:11] lamb for your eyes." And so Jessica's
[1:50:13] eyes come open and these people heard
[1:50:15] the story and they brought this little
[1:50:16] lamb to our house and gave it to Jessica
[1:50:18] because of the story of she believing
[1:50:20] that God provided a lamb for her eyes.
[1:50:22] Well, the lamb was free, but the
[1:50:24] electric fence cost about 200 bucks, but
[1:50:26] that's another story. And so I told her,
[1:50:28] I said, "Now Kai," she said, "Joy
[1:50:30] thing." I said, "Nai, if you want to pet
[1:50:31] that lamb, honey," I said, "Tell me and
[1:50:33] I'll turn off that." I said, "You see
[1:50:34] that light on that box? That's on. Now,
[1:50:36] if you touch that wire, it'll burn you."
[1:50:38] Said, "You understand? If you want to
[1:50:39] pet the lamb, tell Daddy, I'll pull the
[1:50:41] I'll unplug it. You can pet the lamb.
[1:50:42] But if you touch that wire, it'll burn
[1:50:44] you. You understand?" Yes, Daddy.
[1:50:46] Intellectual
[1:50:47] conception. So, I was over working on a
[1:50:50] tractor that backslid and I looked there
[1:50:52] and I saw her going down towards that
[1:50:53] where the lamp was and I thought, "Oh
[1:50:55] boy, I couldn't get there fast enough."
[1:50:57] She got a hold of that wire.
[1:51:00] Wow. So I climbed through the fence and
[1:51:02] got over where she was. I'll never
[1:51:04] forget it, brother. She had her head
[1:51:06] just like this right here. Big old blue
[1:51:08] eyes looked at me tears. She said,
[1:51:10] "Don't touch that wire, Daddy. It's
[1:51:13] haunted." You see, before it was me
[1:51:15] telling her, but after she experienced
[1:51:17] it, it was her telling me. Amen. You
[1:51:21] said, "We want miracles. We want signs
[1:51:22] and wonders." But every miracle starts
[1:51:24] with a problem. You say, "But D, I've
[1:51:26] got a real problem." You're a real
[1:51:27] candidate for a miracle. Do you love him
[1:51:30] tonight? Seed of Abraham, let's declare
[1:51:32] war on Satan this week. Amen. There's
[1:51:34] enough of us here to put every demon to
[1:51:36] flight. Amen. Oh, we are victorious. God
[1:51:38] bless you since Brother. Amen. Thank
[1:51:41] you. Thank you for listening to us
[1:51:43] tonight.
[1:51:44] I'm going to see a
[1:51:48] victory for the
[1:51:50] battle belongs to Lord
[1:51:56] for victory.
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:04] [Applause]
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:19] is possessing. Amen. Amen. We're called
[1:52:22] to possess. Amen. Our
[1:52:25] inheritance. Amen. And uh you know I as
[1:52:28] brother Daryl was was ministering there
[1:52:31] I I thought you know what this uh within
[1:52:34] this tent is some real warriors that
[1:52:38] have been possessing their inheritance.
[1:52:41] And you know, I'm just thinking of just
[1:52:44] a few stories, but uh uh brother Schmai
[1:52:47] and sister Bethany uh my uh
[1:52:50] interpreting, but uh they they've gone
[1:52:53] for 20 years and not been able to have a
[1:52:56] child. And I've known him for about 13
[1:53:00] years and but uh uh brother Shamaya,
[1:53:04] he's just always upbeat, always claiming
[1:53:08] that promise. I'm we're going to have a
[1:53:10] child. We're going to have a child. And
[1:53:14] uh it's not, you know, uh uh if we're
[1:53:17] going to have it, we're going to have
[1:53:18] it. And he said, I'm just looking
[1:53:19] forward to it. Will I be able to hold
[1:53:22] hold my child? And and Sister Bethany,
[1:53:25] uh both of them just claiming the
[1:53:27] miracle. Well, they've got a child. Uh
[1:53:30] the Lord blessed them with a a son uh
[1:53:33] last June and uh uh just a just a real
[1:53:37] miracle. And I uh thinking of that and
[1:53:41] and of course they've uh the baby's had
[1:53:45] some challenges and and uh uh just just
[1:53:50] Satan just trying to fight and uh but
[1:53:53] God has always just seen that baby
[1:53:55] through uh every obstacle. And you know
[1:53:59] uh last uh Wednesday, brother Shmaya
[1:54:03] come in the office there and um songs
[1:54:06] were going on and he's saying you know I
[1:54:10] if you y'all wouldn't mind just praying
[1:54:13] and said you know uh shoe bal's not
[1:54:16] gaining weight and uh just uh concerned
[1:54:20] you know and and of course I I thought
[1:54:24] well you know I I said well the brush
[1:54:26] said we're you know the meeting's coming
[1:54:28] up and and uh we're um you know probably
[1:54:33] have a prayer line and and so I I think
[1:54:36] it would be really good for you uh you
[1:54:38] and Sister Bethany take the baby in the
[1:54:41] prayer line and and um I just believe
[1:54:44] that he'll get well, you know, and and
[1:54:47] um I just felt a little bit like the
[1:54:50] Lord kind of just like, well, why not
[1:54:53] pray now? And uh I said,
[1:54:57] "Well," I said, "Now brush my eyes." I
[1:55:01] said, "We're we're ain't got much people
[1:55:03] tonight, but I said, you know, if we
[1:55:07] could just take the word, you know, and
[1:55:09] and um and if if you'll just believe,
[1:55:13] you know, they shall lay hands on the
[1:55:15] sick and they shall recover." I said, "I
[1:55:17] believe that promise." And I said, 'We
[1:55:20] could just gather, you know, to have the
[1:55:22] church to pray tonight and just believe
[1:55:24] that if if you you believe that. And he
[1:55:26] said, "Well, I do." And so after the
[1:55:30] after we had preached, you know, I had
[1:55:31] brother Schmai and Sister Bethany come.
[1:55:33] We anointed him for oil. And you know,
[1:55:36] uh uh he told me tonight says, "Shub's
[1:55:39] gained a pound." Uh that was last
[1:55:45] week. But
[1:55:48] challenges thinking of my
[1:55:50] mother that had diagnosed with cancer
[1:55:54] and and uh you know uh make the long
[1:55:58] story short, she wasn't doing good at
[1:56:01] all. And uh but the doctor told her she
[1:56:04] had cancer in the lining of her stomach
[1:56:06] and that she was going to have to have
[1:56:08] surgery. And uh we were all there uh at
[1:56:12] the doctor and office and she said,
[1:56:14] "Well, I'm not having surgery." And she
[1:56:17] says, "I believe God will heal me." And
[1:56:20] uh he said he said, "Well, Miss Martin,
[1:56:22] you you've got to have surgery." And she
[1:56:25] said, "Well, I ain't having surgery."
[1:56:27] And uh so he was really trying to
[1:56:30] explain this the seriousness of it. And
[1:56:33] of course, you know, mom was real weak
[1:56:35] and blood coming out of her nose. I
[1:56:38] think her ears and uh just a lot of
[1:56:41] complications and we hadn't seen mom
[1:56:43] like that and uh you know dad just said
[1:56:47] well Jerene you just just schedule the
[1:56:50] surgery. She well I'll schedule the
[1:56:51] surgery but I'm not having surgery and
[1:56:54] uh so schedule the surgery and she just
[1:56:56] kept claiming I'm healed. I'm healed.
[1:56:59] I'm healed. You know and Satan fighting
[1:57:02] her. She's getting weaker and weaker but
[1:57:04] I am healed by his stripes. I am healed.
[1:57:08] and uh they came for the surgery and she
[1:57:10] says now you know Darren we we go in
[1:57:13] there now before they do that surgery
[1:57:15] you tell them to come and and and look
[1:57:18] at me uh x-rays and and uh cuz I believe
[1:57:23] I'm healed and so dad says you know um
[1:57:26] you know could you do some x-rays before
[1:57:28] you touch her and uh uh we we want to
[1:57:32] look at that and they left him in the
[1:57:34] the doctor's office for hours uh couple
[1:57:38] hours or so and finally come back he
[1:57:40] said I'm I'm I'm sorry I've taken so
[1:57:43] long but says I've looked at these
[1:57:44] x-rays said I've had to call other
[1:57:46] physicians to come in and look at this
[1:57:49] we've never seen this before but says
[1:57:51] Miss Martin you do not have cancer amen
[1:57:55] but
[1:57:56] God talking about possessing the gates
[1:57:59] of your enemy brother Ron's a miracle
[1:58:02] amen for four or five years now the
[1:58:05] doctor has given given up on him that
[1:58:07] the other day he's been declared
[1:58:09] cancer-free in his brain. No more tumors
[1:58:13] in in the brain. Amen. A miracle. And
[1:58:17] the doctor says, "We've never seen this
[1:58:19] before." Amen. But I tell you what, God
[1:58:22] proves them wrong, doesn't he? Amen.
[1:58:24] We're possessing the gates of our enemy.
[1:58:27] It's based upon the word of God. Can you

[2:04:19] kitchen area and uh there there will be
[2:04:23] uh should be plenty of room. Also, we
[2:04:25] have reserved uh that small tent that we
[2:04:29] have uh uh in front of the tabernacle
[2:04:32] for all the ministers and their wives.
[2:04:35] And uh so if you uh ministers, brothers
[2:04:38] want to fellowship in there and they
