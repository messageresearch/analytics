we're so glad for that amen amen good to be here amen the house of the Lord trust you had a good afternoon amen and the musicians can be dismissed and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 34th chapter praise the Lord we read it this morning and I want to just go back to that Psalms 34 and before we read maybe we can just bow our heads to the Lord father we're truly honored and to have your presence Among Us Lord and to know Lord what it does to us father no man can truly come into the presence of the Lord without being changed and Lord we need you more now than ever before we're asking that you would come among us this evening and have your way Lord anoint these lips of clay and anoint your people father and the hearts the ears Lord hear and understand and I pray that you would just have your way Among Us Lord any spirit that would try to hinder the service we pray that you would just uh bind it father and may it leave this place Lord father we're we're in a day Lord that your your people are rising to Victory that we're rising to overcoming Lord because we we have the full word of God and father our faith is rising to a level that that hasn't been through the ages Lord It's the greater Faith than Lord that that you have given us and we thank you for it Lord we just love you we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen Psalms 34 and we want to just start again at the fourth verse but it says I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles the angel of the Lord in campus around about them that fear Him and delivereth them old taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord you Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing gummy children hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord amen you can have your seats this evening and I want to continue on on this speaking of fear and as I stated this morning there's two kinds of fear that is mentioned in this passage of scripture and we talked about one of them today and and the Bible identifies it as being the spirit of fear and uh brother Branham calls it the devil's fear and and of course this kind of fear has torment showing that it's a demonic power at work and and um we we see that fear is controlling the world today the majority of people um are under this fear and and it's because of the wrath of God that is coming uh upon the Earth and Jesus already prophesied that men's Hearts would fail them for fear looking after those things which are coming on the Earth so it's the wrath of God that is being poured out on them and uh they're fixing to be if you want to set that way which this brings on the the Great Tribulation but the wrath of God abides on them and and but we we find that there is a people that God delivers from this fear and that's his elect they he delivers them and um Proverbs 3 25 it says Be not Afraid of sudden fear uh neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh and we know that we're in this day but he's telling the people don't be afraid um and of of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh for the Lord shall be thy confidence that's that's why the fear that is gripping the world does not come up on the elect is because the Lord is their confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken so we find out how do we not have fear and and that is through love because Jesus said or John says that perfect love casteth out all fear and it's not a human love it's it's nothing no other love but the greatest of love and that is divine love and and so there's no fear in love but then we find that there's another fear that David speaks of in our opening scripture and and that is the fear of the Lord and this is something that only the elect will have is is the fear of the Lord so the world has one fear and the elect has another fear and according to uh Ecclesiastes 12 and 13. it says the whole duty of man is the fear God and to keep his Commandments and and so then we we read other passages uh Psalms 2 8 serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling so you can rejoice and have fear in in the fear of the Lord uh Psalms 147 11 it says the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him in those that hope in his mercy and in our opening scripture there it says that the the angel of the Lord accompanies them that fear him so so there is always an abiding presence of God and the angels of God that are around those that fear Him He abides with them and and the prophet said see the Angels the angels are with you always and and they they know every thought you think they know every motive of your heart they know they know everything because they're they're with you and he says this is why we're careful careful to do anything uh that would displease him entertain things that would be wrong is is simply because we are conscience of his presence and so then he abides with him that fear them and and of course this is talking of the fear of the Lord uh Proverbs 14 26 it says end the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and we were talking about confidence this morning of how that when there isn't confidence then there's fear uh afraid scared uh um and and but but here in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of Refuge the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death so the having the fear of the Lord is a great thing that that that we all need it's it's it's life it's a Fountain of Life and so we we we see how that that this scripture there and other scriptures are uh show us the contrast between the fear that the devil brings that we talked about this morning versus the fear of the Lord the devil's fear comes by not having confidence and the fear of the Lord is our confidence it brings our confidence and and so we we find that the the fear of the Lord is a precious thing that that we need Proverbs 15 16 says better is little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure and trouble therewith so it the the emphasis in of life is not to have great things it's not to have a great name it's not to be you know uh to have wealth and and these things the the greatest thing that that but what is the fear of the Lord and and we know uh what it is it's it's respect it's towards God and and of course he is the word it's it's reverence in in Divine worship and and toward God and so uh and and again brother Branham has uh laid the foundation so plain that God is the word you cannot love God without the word you cannot love the word without God you you cannot you cannot reverence god without reverencing his word you you cannot respect the word without reverencing God because they're the same uh the same this is God in letter form and then when he comes Among Us it's God in In Living form and er the word in living form and and so uh when when a man respects the word of God then he has the fear of God and brother Brown said you cannot have respects until you have fear amen you so so fear uh and and and so having the fear of the Lord does not mean that you're you're afraid of God God never wants us to serve him when it says serve the Lord with fear that don't mean that you're afraid that don't mean that that you're you're you know you're ready uh thinking that he's going to strike out at you at any time or anything that that's the wrong kind of fear but it means that you have respects and you have reverence for him brother REM said when you fear God you respect God ain't that rhyme and so to fear God is the fear that you might displease him in some way you you fear that you would do something wrong um that that would grieve him and not not again not that he would cast you off people tried to they serve God for different reasons but some serve God because they're afraid to go to hell and that's not the fear that God wants us to serve him with but but but yet that fear of the Lord it causes us to to watch everything that we do because it brings respect now brother Branham said I fear my mother I I fear my wife I I fear my church I fear all God's servants lest I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of the city lest I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian so this is the fear of the Lord it's it's it's a Godly fear and and the Bible tells us to serve God acceptably I believe that's how you'd say it acceptably in other words you to serve God in a way that's agreeable to him a man not not agreeable to us but we would serve God uh in a way that's agreeable to him we want him to be happy we want him to be uh uh uh pleased with our life and so we serve God acceptably and then it says uh serve him with reverence and godly fear ain't that rhyme and so brother Brown says if a man's ever born of of the spirit of God he becomes a new creature and can't produce nothing else but Godly fear Godly love and the fruits of the spirit for it is life ain't that right it is life and so uh uh when the Life of Christ comes in us then this is what it produces it doesn't produce uh the fear that of the devil uh uh for God has not given us the spirit of fear but yet the life of God living in US produces the fear of the Lord I respect and and so uh you look in Hebrews 5 and 7 in Paul in speaking of Christ said who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared ain't that right in that he feared so again it was because that he had respect unto on unto the father it was because he he had reverence that his prayers were answered ain't that right and and so of of course uh you know someone said well why did Jesus have to pray well the Bible says All Flesh cries out and so so that human part had to pray and yet he he prayed to the God that was within him but but the whole life of Jesus was was that of fearing the Lord it it was a reverence it was a respect unto unto God and His word ain't that right so so again here in in Psalms 145 19 it says he will fulfill the desire can you say that with me he will fulfill the desire of them that fear Him He also will hear their cry and will save them ain't that right so so now you know uh uh today we speak of how that God has given us the spirit of of wisdom and understanding in this day and and how true it it is that that God has done this and it was important that God would would give it uh to us because by this uh according to the scripture by this comes the the fear of the Lord and and we we find in Psalms 1 um 1 11 and 10. uh it says fear the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom ain't that right so so to just to have the fear of the Lord you're beginning to have wisdom and and and that's the positive sign that a man has uh wisdom uh is is he has the fear of the Lord and and then you look at Job 28 and 28 and he says unto man he said behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom amen so so the beginning of wisdom when when God gave us the spirit of wisdom that is the first thing that he began to impart to the church was the fear of the Lord a a reverence a a Godly and and how we needed that it because look at the world today look look at what has been through all the ages it's it's just been a rise of one denomination to the next and and in in a tradition and and as I said this morning they've made uh the tables of the Lord just they're full of vomit and and and chaos and Corruption and and all of that but it would be in this day that God would would uh pour out and give unto us the spirit of wisdom which would began with giving us the fear of the Lord amen when when they're they're living all kinds of of of ways and act in any way but but here it says uh 28 and 28 and job behold the fear of the Lord that is wisdom and to depart from Evil is understanding and there's a lot there that we could go into just in that verse alone but but we find uh here that that Psalms 1 and 7 it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge ain't that right and and this knowledge is is the knowledge of God it's a Godly knowledge which Peter talks about but in other places uh is the knowledge of God but fools despise notice what they despise wisdom and understanding they the fools that despise wisdom and instruction and and and so then you look at at Proverbs 9 and 10 it says the knowledge of the Holy is understanding so we see that it's a higher knowledge than than just the the knowledge of of of humanity but it's the knowledge of God ain't that right and so we can understand why why the world is in the condition that it's in we can understand why people are so Brazen in their their actions and and and these things is because they have not the fear of the Lord which shows that they have not the wisdom and and the knowledge of the Lord ain't that right so so that leads to no respect that leads to no reverence it it leads to all these things now what is the knowledge of God for for again the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge amen and so what is the knowledge of God we look at it as the Mysteries revealed amen it's the it's not an it's not the knowledge of a of a closed book it's it's the knowledge of of an open book ain't that right the things that God has has uh uh been it's been hidden before the foundation of the world has now been revealed to us in this day amen and we look at that Revelations 10 and 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished or as the prophet would tell us should be revealed ain't that right so God would not just give us the spirit of wisdom but he would open up the knowledge of God and and and therefore the fear of the Lord would come to us and ain't that right amen so so the mystery of God should be finished or revealed unveiled as he has declared to his servants the prophets so before he could reveal the Mysteries then we find the lamb had to come and to loose the seals uh thereof and in this day the prophet said he took the book The Lamb took the book opened them seals and he opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people can you say man so so this all of these things has a meaning to us this message of the hour has great meaning to us as the elect of God because it's God imparting something to us then just uh uh uh knowledge of of humanity just intellectual but God is imparting to us the fear of the Lord amen you ought to just go take your uh concordance and look up the fear of the Lord and and and the fear of God the uh these things and just look up all them scriptures of the benefits of those who have the fear of the Lord Angels again accompanying those that fear Him Now now uh uh Psalms 25 and 14 it says the secret of the Lord and and of course we know what the secret is it's a mystery the secret of the Lord is what with them that fear Him and He will show them his Covenant so so this is is applicable to our day today is that the secret of the Lord that which has been hidden before the foundation of the world is with them where is it at not with God not kept in the mind of God but now it's with the people those that fear Him and notice and he will show them reveal to them his Covenant to who those that fear Him ain't that right so how do you know who really has the mystery of God revealed to them is is it because they know the Bible is it because they they can quote quotes and and and things like that no they have the fear of the Lord they have the fear of the Lord which is a sign that the mystery that they have the knowledge of God that that the secrets of God has been now given to them that fear Him ain't that rhyme amen and what has really been made known in this day have you ever just thought of that what is really made known to us brother Samaya it's the Covenant God made known his Covenant to those that fear Him a covenant that was made before we were ever here a covenant that was established and that's what has been made known to us that we weren't a saved just on any given day we was always saved it was a covenant that God would make for us can you say amen and it's in this day that the Mysteries being made known the secrets of God now it being imparted to us and what is imparted is the Covenant that God made with us and it's to those that fear Him so we we find how does he make the Covenant known to them by coming in person and confirming it to them amen not just intellectually but but confirming it by his presence now the fear of the Lord as we we read is the beginning of knowledge and I'd like for you to to look at Proverbs 1 28. it says then they shall call upon me but I will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices for the Turning Away of the simple shall slave them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but whosoever hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil and you say Amen so so those that hearken and and again the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and so he that has his this knowledge in other words he that hearkens unto him shall dwell safely and no fear of evil shall come upon him but why because he has chose the fear of the Lord now there are people that are so into fear and gripped with the fear a man that is coming upon the Earth but why did it happen is they refused the knowledge and they chose not the fear of the Lord now there's going to be a fear that grips people out of the way either you'll have the fear that the devil is going to bring that's going to torment you and and is going to plague you and gonna afflict you or you're going to have the fear of the Lord that is going to bring a reverence but with that fear of the Lord you are promised to abide safely and you say man and so uh uh this fear shall not come upon him uh uh in other words it shall not attach itself oh it tries to come upon us all fear tries to come upon us all but one thing it cannot do it cannot attach itself because we have the fear of the Lord we that there is a reverence there is a respect unto God's word can you say Amen so therefore we're not going to cast aside our confidence and throw that away when we see the trouble amen and we're facing things that we can't we we we cannot take care of we're not going to throw the confidence away we have the fear of the Lord the Lord is our confidence you say man now if you notice uh um Proverbs 19 23 the fear of the Lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied and he shall not be visited with evil now now church if you can only understand that that God by his Mercy would impart knowledge to us in this day God by his Mercy would impart wisdom unto us in this day which is the beginning of the fear of the Lord ain't that right but he that haths the fear of the Lord shall abide satisfied he that half the fear of the Lord shall not be visited with evil destruction is coming it's in the land the plagues are here people are losing their faith people are losing their confidence people are just being so tormented and vets by the devil whether it be spiritually physically mentally it's it's happening everywhere but he that hath the fear of the Lord shall not be visited by evil ain't that right see why you're going to abide safely because the fear of the Lord tendeth to life why because God has already promised nobody can take your place nobody can can you say Amen so by the message of the hour by God revealing the mystery unto us and imparting the spirit of wisdom he's preserving life unto you he's preserving you for a rapture Noah is a great example of this scripture you shall not be visited with evil the fear of the Lord tendeth to life now listen there in Hebrews 11 and 8. by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as of yet now God warned him but notice he moved with fear everybody say move of fear and being moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his household ain't that right now now notice I want to go back and and I got a lot but but I'm not going to take long but I'm gonna just take my time for a minute the fear of the Lord tendeth to life ain't that right that fear of the Lord tendeth for to life now and then here the Bible is telling us now death was coming destruction was coming God already to warn Noah I'm going to destroy this world I'm getting rid of the sin I'm getting rid of the filth I'm getting rid of everything but it was the grace of God that came to Noah to give him that knowledge no one could have done whatever he wanted to he could have been just like the people of that day and said I don't believe it but he moved with fear the fear of the Lord took him a man and by that fear he prepared an ark and when the destruction was coming he was writing when people were drowning and the world was being destroyed him and his family were safe didn't you say man see he built the ark because he had the fear of the Lord he respected God's warning he respected he didn't say well I don't see the rain no he knew that God could make the rain he knew he had a reverence to God he didn't treat him just like some president out here that is just a flat liar making all these promises and a lot of these promises he tries to make but he's unable to fulfill them but God is not that type of God when God said something he means that he's going to do it I don't care if he has to create the rain he's going to do it I don't care if he has to create whatever you need he's going to do it and those that fear the lord and that's the way it is today we've been warned we know we know and we have the material to make ourselves ready can you say man I thought of the generation that sat there and listen to that prophet and they laughed at him they made fun of him they judged him by his education they judged him whether he could say pulpit or what is that other word pulpit amen and and they couldn't get past the the language they couldn't get past the the the the the the the the barrier of Education they they couldn't get past that little simple man they couldn't get past the fact a man that he didn't really you know I mean they've got a lot of things about brother random one of them he didn't know how to run money he didn't know how to deal with money well you know why he didn't know how to deal with money he gave his money away and they they write in their books and laugh at him and all of these things but what was going on it was a warning to the people of God and and they rejected it they called it the devil but look at their Generations today look at the world look at what they've done because they turned it down look at the world but there's a people today that are moved with fear that is preparing an ark that's preparing for the coming of the Lord why because they have respect under the word of God so he built the The Ark in reverence not carelessly carelessly he didn't say Okay God the warning's coming you okay that's fine I know how to do this thing no but God God God showed him the pattern and by reverence and and by fear unto the Lord he built it exactly the way God wanted it he builted exactly the way God showed him why he honored God's way of doing things he honored God's instructions for he had the fear of the Lord can you say amen and I say to you today there is a people on earth that is preparing in reverence they are preparing in respect to God Amen because they know the way God wants it done can you say Amen they know what kind of a people that we ought to be we they know what kind of a church God is after they know a man beyond a shadow of a doubt amen that God doesn't want his people in The Honky Tonks God doesn't want his people listen to the rock and roll in the country and and all this Christian rock as well amen God doesn't want all of this nonsense in the church in the home and so they're preparing getting rid of their televisions getting rid of their movies getting rid of the the hogwash that is round wow they're preparing you see God demands respect he demands reverence and it takes before you can do that in order to do that it takes having the fear of the Lord now we read where the Bible says they hated knowledge and chose not the fear of the Lord and and so the knowledge came the knowledge of God but it's not that they don't want knowledge uh uh because the Bible tells us that the people in this day would would be ever learning and never come to the knowledge of Truth so they're constantly learning and and Luke 7 16 8 Jesus said the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light so they they've got a knowledge it's it's definitely a knowledge and and and they are fulfilling what Paul says in Romans 1 20 professing themselves to be wise they became fools ain't that right so they are wiser than the children of light but they've never come to the knowledge of Truth learning they're wiser in science they're wiser in technology they're they're wiser in education they're wiser in in their schools their their wiser in in all of these things and and and even brother Brown talks about even theologians that that could tie a man up with with the Bible he says you don't want to mess with a lot of them fundamentalists just simply because they know the Bible they're wiser amen but they don't come to the knowledge of the truth and because they've rejected the knowledge of truth that knowledge of God they have rejected uh of the fear of the Lord so we know that they haven't come to the knowledge of truth because there's no fear of the Lord Solomon of old tells us that there's only one way to understand the fear of the Lord and that's in Proverbs two and one it says my son if thou receive my words and notice again what he writes if thou receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding yea if thou Christ after knowledge and if thou Lift us up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches her for uh for her as for his treasures then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God ain't that right so a person must receive the word of the Lord and hide it within them now Church you know uh the psalmist says Thy word have I hid in my heart that I'd sin not against thee so there there is a a something that we all have to do here is not just hear the word but hide the word not not just taking the word and say yes I believe it but watch what the devil will do out them doors is try his best if he can't do it from here in the church then he'll do it out there in your trials and in in everything else around he's after the word in your heart and you have to hide it you have to guard that word with everything that's within you you've got to guard it in other words quit listening to Tommy Rock quit listening to the things of the world quit listening to the grumbling quick listening to the the backbiting quit listening to the division quit listening to all unbelief and guard that word in your heart and then you'll know you'll know you'll begin to understand the fear of the Lord so he says you see if if if if they'll incline their ear to wisdom and apply their their their heart to understanding see it takes a person hungering for the knowledge of God and and crying out for for understanding can you say man but it's in that crying it's in that hunger it's in that desire and it's in that receiving of the word and guarding that word you begin to understand the fear of the Lord God the fear of the Lord puts a person in all and in this word all according to Webster is is at admiration reverence reverential fear and emotion variously combining dread veneration and wonder that is inspired by Authority or by the sacred or Sublime and I thought that that's that's incredible the it puts a person in all and and and that that all is inspired by one of authority by an authority and I I thought if our if our lawmakers had the fear of the Lord that they would be careful as to what laws they passed if the world had the fear of the Lord they'd be careful as to what they supported if if churches had the fear of the Lord they'd be careful not to condone the sin that they're condoning around the world see the fear of the Lord is an awareness of how great God is he's faithful he's true He reigns forever there there is no words to describe God and his kingdom his Reign his just his character his person but once it becomes a reality of who he is it brings an all for he is one of authority he is one of that's in control it it brings an awareness as to how holy and righteous God is and as we read in the scriptures and and any experience with God that one would have it shows that we know that God is high and exalted ain't that right so when people don't have the fear of the Lord then they they it shows that they don't see him as the high and exalted God and this generation this generation turning down the message that God has sent to us is a sign that they chose not the fear of the Lord they they couldn't get past they couldn't see past that that you know the Flesh of that hillbilly Kentuckian that only had the seventh grade education and of course brother Branham preached them the sermon the presence of God unrecognized they didn't recognize that it was God so they didn't fear Him they didn't they didn't fear God they they they they saw it that it was just you know I wished I had the quotes before me but brother Branham said what what makes God great is he's so humble he can get his low he can go low he said greatness is humility and so if you're going to see the greatness of God you look got to look through the at the humility of things and not at the greatness of things because what man considers great is is is it stinks before God right and and so they they tried to look at for God through what they consider great right but you can't see the greatness of God until you see the humility of God that's why God would choose us humble flesh mortal right so God was supernaturally in that Prophet proving his word and yet they couldn't see it and the prophet tried his best to teach teach them the fear of the Lord teach them uh uh there and he tried his best to show them who really was in their midst who who the presence of God it was different and yet they they couldn't see it and they chose not the fear of the Lord ain't that right and and and so it reminds me of what the Prophet Jeremiah said in Jeremiah 5 21. where it says here now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not and have ears and hear not fear ye not me saith the Lord will you not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the Sea by Perpetual decree that it cannot pass and though the ways thereof toss themselves yet they cannot can they not Prevail though they Roar yet can they not pass over it but this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone neither say in their heart now let us fear our the Lord Our God see that that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the Harvest see your iniquities have have turned your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good things from you and and so we we find that that it's because they did not have the fear of the Lord you see when a man recognizes the presence of God then then it brings a the fear of the Lord to him and you say man see you you cannot know who he is and know that you're standing in his presence and not have a reverence and a respect for him and and and and that was the that was the problem with the church the very God I mean the scripture was fulfilled where Jesus said behold I stand at the door and knock where was he he's outside the church and what the world didn't know by rejecting that hillbilly Kentucky and they were rejecting and rejecting his message they were fulfilling the very scripture and Jesus was standing on the outside of the door trying to get back into the church because they didn't recognize the presence of God they didn't recognize a man who really it was yes brother Branham is a man we all know that that don't take a uh only a perverted mind would would think that brother Brandon was God but TLX knows that brother Branham wasn't God but it was God in that prophet God revealing it showing it supernaturally amen to where they had to choose not to have the fear of the Lord they had to choose just like everyone today has to choose you choose how you'll be you'll choose what you're you just choose it's your choice you'll choose how your day is going to be you're you can't help but uh with the the circumstances that come here to you in the day but you choose on how you're going to act react to them you choose and and how you know when the Trials Come how you're going to react you choose them things and you'll either choose the fear of the Lord or you'll choose not to you'll choose the knowledge of the Lord you'll choose to meditate on them we've got so much knowledge today of God that has been given to us to to where we know amen every aspect of our life every part I don't care where the Devil comes in at we know how to how to react to these things we know that he that hates the knowledge of God chooses not to fear of the Lord Isaiah 6 and 1 in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up in his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and between he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke notice Isaiah now was in the presence of God and he recognized it remember as the prophet talked an influence several sermons of influence he he idolized King Uzziah and when uziah died he was like okay you know what what's to become of me now I mean his everything was attached to Uzziah but then the Lord came and revealed himself that was so greater than Uzziah Uzziah back slid and he was showing the greatness of himself to Isaiah and notice the the impact that Isaiah had then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts he realized that he was in the presence of the Lord and and the prophet said in the presence of God a man recognizes himself to be a sinner because his presence is Holy his he is Holy he's pure he's righteous he's he's the great God Almighty ain't that right and and so you could imagine being in the greatness of a person in the presence of some great person whether it be the the king of England or queen or or you know some president or or or or something there's something about them that that puts you at just a weird feeling it it just it brings a respect you're in in the presence of greatness but here here when you come into the presence of God you you can't come into the presence of God without realizing you're in the presence of of an authority a man that could just speak the word and and everything but just stop time would stop and you say Amen talked of how he was hunting with that his friend Bert call got saved and they're out in the mountains in the adirondikes and he said they they climbed a mountain and they were overlooking everything he's so so breathtaking and he says you know that Bert said Gee Bill Aces this is this is just a wonder he says it makes a man feel small he said just makes a man feel small and brother Brown said just just being there he said that was the only connection that he would have with the presence of God just seeing creation and he realized that God made all of this and it was just so beautiful it it brought an awareness of the greatness of God just being out in the out in the mountains and in nature that it just caused him to feel so little in his presence it changes a man and and so we we find you know Brother Brad I'm talking he said you know that's a man that wrote How Great Thou Art he said I could just imagine he penned them words one night as he's looking at the stars and he's he's just thinking of how all these stars are billions of miles apart and and and yet you know and there's millions of them and and yet the Bible says they call it God calls them all by name and and yet they as as it may be looking at them and how close they seem to be but yet they're miles apart and billions of miles and things but something inspired just by seeing that he saw how great God is he sold the greatness and it brought a fear of God that he began to just pin the words How Great Thou Art then sings my soul ain't that right see somehow or another it's always throws a great effect upon people to come into the presence of God brother Brown said I've seen the time in my Ministry when you would see the presence of God come into such a place that would bring a person up and just reveal the life to them and call out their sins and all of all kinds of immoral acts and bring it such a holy hush among the people till they drop out of the prayer line before they could ever come up to be prayed for and run to the Altar and get right with God before they come into His presence see it the power and the presence of God brings such a holy fear until you're just paralyzed in in his presence I I thought of Adam you know when he first sinned he tried to cover himself up and and thought he was going to meet God that way but then the time to meet God and here comes God coming down in that Garden in the presence of God starts coming closer and closer and Adam began to feel just like an awful sinner he just felt so awful that he ran and hid from the presence of God it it see it and the prophet said see sin was upon his soul sin and and he could not he could not come into the presence of God he couldn't approach god with sin upon his soul right and and he says he realized that when the presence of God came he could not hide he knew he couldn't hide because his soul was still tender he hadn't sinned a whole lot he hadn't drug himself through all the corruption that people have today to where people are so hard that they literally think they could approach God and stand there amen and and defy him that Adam couldn't Adam couldn't come into the presence of God and and and in that way was so sin upon his soul because his soul was still tender and he ran right he hid in the bushes the prophet said and wouldn't come out until God provided an atonement but we find many many people throughout the Bible that was changed coming into the presence of God Moses born to be a prophet and he's learned in all the ways of the Egyptians he was smart educated trained in Psychology and he understood that he was to deliver his people uh the Israelites and he knowed all the ins and outs about all these things he the prophet said he knowed the scripture from A to Z he knowed all the promises that God made he knew that he was the one he was taught by his mom but he knew it only by theological standpoint and yet he was going to try and all of his power to deliver the the children of Israel he thought I can do this people fear me because he was educated he taught he taught the Egyptians so he tried in his way of psychology to deliver the people LeBron said psychology won't deliver the people can you say man but when he stood in the presence of God at that burning bush he forgot everything he forgot his abilities he forgot his talents he forgot it all because he come into the presence of God and it brought a respect to him brought a fear of God and he fell upon his face like Abraham did because he could not stand in the presence of God can you say Amen prophets say when a man stands in the presence of God he realizes there's something lacking within himself no matter how talented a person may be no matter how educated a person is no matter how smart Rich whatever whatever we would think that would get us by when you come into the presence of God you really find out that there's lacking and it brings or it should be it should bring the fear of the Lord because you realize that his presence is far greater than yours his talents his word everything that he is is far greater look at Paul in all the education his education seemed as nothing when he come into the presence of God Philippians 3 8 and he says I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine on righteous see he he he learned the fear of the Lord the 13th verse Paul said Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus ain't that right so on and on and on holy men uh um recognize themselves as Sinners and if holy men of God that was anointed of God that was used of God recognize themselves as sinners in the presence of God then where will the ungodly where would the sinner appear in the presence of God right brother Brown says what will people do who has sent in the meetings what will people do that seen the power of God that's heard the countdown on the word that seen God manifest himself and beyond a shadow of a doubt every scripture fulfilled and will strive to try still try to make heaven without being born again and receive the Holy Ghost what's going to happen to them what kind of a place are we going to stand in if we see God unfold himself right before us and see the glory of God just the same as them men did and that kind of men Cried Out prophets and sages upon whom the word is based upon if they cried and fell to their feet and screamed I'm a man of Unholy lips uncleanness what will it be then for that man who won't even confess his sins what will it be for that teenager that won't confess his or her sins what will it be for that hard-hearted man that thinks he knows more about God's creation than God himself what will it be to that man that spent all of his life trying to disprove the Bible and where will that guy appear see there are those who could walk in the presence of God and pay no attention to it it shows he wasn't ordained alive but if he's a predestinated of God as soon as that first move hits he knows it and that fire catches can you say man now church as I close we have seen the glory of God like Abraham saw it we have seen the pillar of Fire like Moses saw it we have seen the mighty works as the prophets of old have seen it we've seen the same power of God we have seen the same manifestation of Christ revealing himself showing himself keeping his word in these last days we have seen the work of Melchizedek the way Abraham saw it we have seen the sign of the Messiah the way the Samaritan woman saw it and you say Amen it should bring the fear of the Lord not trying to uh serve him by our own talents not trying to that that would be like a Moses before he come into the presence of the Lord that would be like a Paul or a soul that that tried his own wisdom before he come into the presence of the Lord but we have seen the presence of the Lord we have been in the presence of the Lord you should bring a fear of the Lord upon us can you say Amen programs says how can people walk by and treat it so lightly after seeing what we have seen how can we walk around and hold to our Creeds and denominations and have respect to the word of God you can't do it what will happen to this generation who has seen the glory of God and yet have turned it down you know the old proverb says what fools will walk with hob-nailed shoes Where Angels feared to trot this world has has taken their soul people have drugged their souls and sinned so much to where they're so numb to the presence of God they have gotten used to so much sin they've got so much used to so much things that you become numb you're in what the prophet said about that little boy you know when he first time he he takes a cookie out of the cookie jar and Mama tells them says son did you you you take that cookie no ma'am I didn't take that cookie he said in his conscience is telling him yes you did tell the truth you did he says no no I didn't take that cookie and he gets away with it he's then he'll tell another lie and another lie and another lie he said in every light takes that conscience is becoming more numb and more numb it becomes easier to lie then it becomes easier to do things it becomes easier right before you know it he grows up lies to the law he becomes a law breaker thinks nothing of it because his conscience is becoming more seared and more seared the more you keep looking at that pornography the more of your conscience is being seared the more you keep looking at things that should not be the more your conscience is being seared to where it becomes easier to do it it becomes easier to to gossip it becomes easier to listen to the garbage it just becomes easier to to revote against the word of God it just becomes easier Amen to despise good and to to to accept uh sin and it just becomes easier can you say man but there is a people that that is is looking and as not dragging their soul through all this filth and all the smut and all these things we want the fear of the Lord we we have accepted the knowledge of God can you say Amen yes sir it's it's amazing these days that now you've got people that claiming to be in the messes that that that will not hear a preacher anymore and and they've given every excuse and and not to come to the house of God sitting at home listening on the internet and all of these things and you'll ask them I've asked them well what does it say about the Bible where it says for sake not the assembling of themselves and together and they'll totally ignore that scripture amen it's something that's happening and there's nothing there to grasp it now it does take the mercy of God and I still believe in the mercy of God but I'm just telling you where we're at today we need to fear we need to choose the knowledge of God and the wisdom of God which is the beginning the fear of the Lord can you say Amen Isaiah 14 or Psalms 14 1 says the fool hath said in his heart there is no God how did it get to that point because he has no fear of the Lord God can manifest himself as he has seven times around the world that God manifest himself and to think of it a generation today hardly even knows what God done right it should have been broadcast it should have been spread out throughout the world if the world would have caught it like they have spread and propaganda of Billy Graham and oral Robertson and all of these others if they would have caught the message of the hour you would have less people saying there is no God because it was that message that proved there was a gut can you say man if the musicians will come Psalms 119 63 he says I am a companion of all them that fear they and of them that keep thy precepts that's where our fellowship is that's the ones I want to be identified with can you say man a companion of all them that feareth thee and of them that keep thy precepts the Lord is good isn't he got so much more to go but I look at psalm 16 8 it says I have set the lord always before me [Music] he did this so he wouldn't be confused about it he wanted to be conscious of the presence of the Lord because once you lose sight of the presence of the Lord you lose sight of the knowledge of God it becomes an intellectual thing to us and then ultimately we lose the fear of the Lord [Music] that the prophet said see by David saying I have set the lord always before me he's saying that David put God first and then brother Branham says put him first then you won't sin when you are realizing that constantly you're in the presence of God when you realize that God is around you'll watch what you say when a man thinks that God is gone he has no knowledge of God the presence of God he'll cuss how many how many people claim to be Christians because think nothing of it swear ain't nothing of it brother Brown said he'll lust after women you'll cheat lie steal because he has no consciousness of the presence of God therefore there's no fear of God [Music] brother Bram said you bring him into the presence of God one time he'll quit it why because it brings the fear of the Lord if there's any Consciousness about him if there's any conscience within him at all when he comes into the presence of the Lord he'll stop it immediately because there's a fear it brings reverence can you say man you love the Lord amen God bless you pray that it helped you today let's just sing this while we're singing I'm no longer Slave To Fear oh I am a child of God I'm no longer a Slave To Fear
