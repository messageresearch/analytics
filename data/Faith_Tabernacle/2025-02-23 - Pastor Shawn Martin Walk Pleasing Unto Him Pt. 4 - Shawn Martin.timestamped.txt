[47:02] Lord
[47:04] father so glad that we could call you
[47:07] father Lord we're not estranged from
[47:12] you Lord we're not just approaching you
[47:15] as a beggar a stranger but we're your
[47:20] children and father we know that
[47:24] anything that you have belongs to to us
[47:28] we don't have to cringe when we ask you
[47:31] of anything but as you have invited us
[47:34] to come boldly before the throne of
[47:37] grace to find help in time of need and
[47:40] Lord that's just the way you are and
[47:43] Lord we accept it whether we feel worthy
[47:46] of it Lord or not it it's it's by your
[47:50] grace and Lord we just believe in your
[47:52] pardoning grace and we would ask Lord
[47:56] upon this basis that you would come and
[48:00] minister to us this morning Father you
[48:03] know every need that is present and Lord
[48:06] I am helpless to meet them needs but
[48:09] father you know how to meet them and you
[48:12] can meet it in a moment's time and we
[48:15] ask that you would do so father as your
[48:18] word Goes Forth it is creative word and
[48:21] may your people rest upon that father
[48:24] and Believe on it and may when we leave
[48:27] this place Lord we would be drawn closer
[48:29] to you is our prayer and may you have
[48:32] the Liberty now Lord to minister Among
[48:35] Us I pray your anointing be upon me
[48:38] father and help me to yield myself to
[48:40] you and may your anointing be upon the
[48:43] people may your spirit go forth as the
[48:45] word as the word is delivered we ask it
[48:49] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[48:52] says amen amen uh we want to look at 1
[48:58] Thessalonians the 4th
[49:01] chapter
[49:03] and
[49:06] I find that this is very
[49:10] um appropriate for the our time that
[49:13] we're living in but it says furthermore
[49:16] then we beseech you Brethren and exhort
[49:19] you by the Lord Jesus that as you have
[49:21] received of us how you ought to walk and
[49:23] to please God so you would abound more
[49:27] and more for you know what Commandments
[49:29] we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this
[49:33] is the will of God even your
[49:34] sanctification that you should abstain
[49:36] from
[49:37] fornication and that every one of you
[49:39] should know how to possess his vessel in
[49:44] sanctification and honor then if you'll
[49:47] turn with me to uh the book of
[49:51] Ephesians
[49:54] um the fifth
[49:58] chapter the book of Ephesians chapter
[50:03] 5 and I want to just read the first two
[50:11] verses Ephesians chapter 5 and one be ye
[50:15] therefore followers of God as dear
[50:20] children and walk in love everybody say
[50:22] walk in
[50:24] love as Christ also hath loved us and ha
[50:28] given himself for us an offering and a
[50:32] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[50:37] Savor amen you can have your seats this
[50:41] morning and I again want to use the
[50:47] title uh walk pleasing unto
[50:50] him you know there is an
[50:54] expectation that God has for us in this
[50:56] this day and uh as we've quoted the
[51:00] scripture there in Jeremiah
[51:03] 29:11 God spoke through the prophet and
[51:06] saying I know the thoughts that I think
[51:08] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[51:11] Peace not of evil to give you an
[51:14] expected in so then that means as as uh
[51:19] belonging to God we're we're not just
[51:21] floating around in life and we should
[51:23] never have that attitude we should never
[51:26] have that just happy gol Lucky in in the
[51:30] sense I mean we should always be joyful
[51:32] and happy but not without purpose and we
[51:37] we should never treat our lives uh on a
[51:40] daily basis we should never just treat
[51:42] it like you know we just live life and
[51:46] and we're not accountable to anything or
[51:48] we have no goal but God has a goal every
[51:52] morning that you wake up amen God looks
[51:55] at you with purpose
[51:57] and uh and and this day that he put us
[52:00] in is for a purpose we all have a
[52:02] purpose and so God has allotted his word
[52:06] to each age as we know and so uh God
[52:10] expects that word to be fulfilled by a a
[52:15] a predestinated group of people to that
[52:17] age so we have been predestinated to the
[52:20] age that we're living in to fulfill the
[52:22] word that he has allotted amen uh to
[52:25] this age so we are to become the word
[52:29] now we would not know these things if it
[52:31] was not for a prophet but we understand
[52:34] now what God is is after is that we
[52:37] become the word for we are the word
[52:40] bride amen we do not become bride
[52:44] manifestation of bride by joining a
[52:46] church or uh conforming to some Doctrine
[52:50] or a Baptist Doctrine Pentecostal or
[52:53] whatever we we are word bride uh because
[52:57] we're manifesting the very word that God
[53:00] has promised or alloted for the day that
[53:03] we're living in and so brother brandom
[53:05] said what is that word bride it's the
[53:08] manifestation of this hour the bride see
[53:12] not a Creed or a denomination but a
[53:15] living Oracle of God everybody say
[53:18] living Oracle of God see a living
[53:22] attribute of God displaying to the world
[53:25] the attributes of God in the formation
[53:29] of the Bride so all the attributes of
[53:32] God are being displayed in the formation
[53:35] of the Bride that's to be expressed in
[53:38] this hour that we're living in amen see
[53:43] so I looked up this word Oracle it it is
[53:45] it means a person through whom a deity
[53:49] is believed to speak uh an utterance of
[53:53] God Amen so so here the prophet said
[53:57] we're living Oracles of God so which
[54:00] means that we are a vessel which God
[54:03] speaks through his word is spoken
[54:06] through ain't that right just like we
[54:09] believe that the prophet brother brandom
[54:11] was a Oracle of God Amen and what he
[54:15] spoke was thus sayth the Lord we we
[54:18] believe that as as he would say you know
[54:21] I am God's voice to you and he he said I
[54:24] you know I I I I felt like I might have
[54:27] offended you or something you know and
[54:29] and and you all know that I guess the
[54:31] quote but and and but then he says uh
[54:34] but I am God's voice to you he said that
[54:37] time it repeated it you know and and so
[54:41] um uh so brother Brandon was a a a a
[54:44] living Oracle of God uh uh God's voice
[54:48] but we I believe are Oracles of God the
[54:52] voice of God did not stop when brother
[54:54] Brandon was taken off the Earth but
[54:56] notice we are lived voices everybody say
[55:00] lived voices we're we're lived voices
[55:04] see so we're living Oracles of God and
[55:08] and the Thunder of God thundering out
[55:10] that that brother brandham spoke of
[55:12] remember he says Oh how we need in
[55:16] Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices
[55:19] we need that here we need that around
[55:21] the world thousands of lived voices the
[55:25] Thunder of God thundering out notice in
[55:29] sweetness and Holiness and Purity
[55:33] undefiled lives walking around in the
[55:36] Earth today without a blemish yes sir
[55:40] real Christians everybody say real
[55:43] Christians amen he says and that's the
[55:46] Thunder against the enemy see the devil
[55:49] don't care how loud you can holler the
[55:51] devil don't care how how much you can
[55:53] jump or how much you can do this or
[55:55] Shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see
[55:58] that Sanctified holy life consecrated to
[56:02] God say anything to him call him
[56:04] anything and yet he's just as sweet as
[56:07] can be and move right on now he says oh
[56:10] my that throws him away that's the
[56:13] Thunder that shakes the devil ain't that
[56:16] right but see we're we're not just
[56:18] average person we're not just the
[56:21] average uh uh uh guy here on this Earth
[56:25] we are Sons and Daughters of God can you
[56:29] say Amen so we don't look at the message
[56:31] as impossible and how can I do that and
[56:34] and oh my no we're Sons and Daughters of
[56:37] God Amen see there's something in us and
[56:40] as we talked uh uh the other day you
[56:43] know uh uh we are made after his kind
[56:48] amen God made us after his own kind
[56:52] ain't that right so in in the natural we
[56:55] are in the genes of our father were in
[56:57] the genes of our father see even when he
[57:00] was a young boy uh uh uh brother Matthew
[57:03] you were you were in your father then
[57:06] see just waiting to be expressed Prophet
[57:09] said your father couldn't have
[57:11] fellowship with you because he didn't
[57:12] know you you wasn't expressed yet amen
[57:15] but yet you were there see and he says
[57:18] but then through the bedding grounds of
[57:20] a mother you were brought forth into the
[57:23] Earth and become in the image of your
[57:25] father
[57:26] then he could fellowship with you ain't
[57:29] that right then he could fellowship with
[57:32] you he said and so were you Sons and
[57:35] Daughters of God before there were even
[57:38] a moon a star a molecule you were Sons
[57:42] and Daughters of God for you are only
[57:45] the physical manifestation of the
[57:48] attributes that was in God at the
[57:51] beginning see he says there's only one
[57:54] form of eternal life and that was you
[57:57] before see and he says you don't know
[57:59] nothing about it neither did you know
[58:01] when you was in your Earthly father but
[58:04] you are manifested too In His Image so
[58:07] in the image of God you are made you
[58:10] were manifested for the glory and
[58:13] fellowship of God ain't that right see
[58:16] so we are a people that have been
[58:18] delivered as the Bible says we've been
[58:21] delivered out of Darkness amen into his
[58:25] uh uh or from the power of darkness and
[58:28] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[58:31] son amen Peter says we've escaped the
[58:33] corruption that is in the world through
[58:35] lust amen and have been made partakers
[58:39] of his divine nature amen see amen so so
[58:44] that what a blessing that is so if we
[58:47] are made partaker of his divine nature
[58:50] then it shows that we were a gene seed
[58:53] of God before the foundation of the
[58:56] world so there is a special relationship
[58:59] that we have with God we don't look at
[59:02] him as just God setting up in the heaven
[59:04] waiting to Amen to to blow fire down and
[59:08] and consume us you'll never know the
[59:10] wrath of God never never God May correct
[59:13] you but you'll never know the wrath of
[59:16] God Amen like the world is under because
[59:19] you are part of your father amen God is
[59:23] just not a god he's your father amen and
[59:26] You're Made In His Image you're made
[59:28] just like him so as brother brand would
[59:31] call him papa papa God ain't that right
[59:34] and and so then we are now the prophet
[59:37] said an expression of the attributes of
[59:40] his thoughts before the foundation of
[59:42] the world so we know we started as a
[59:45] thought of God in God was his thoughts
[59:48] and that's us amen he thought of you
[59:51] today he thought of uh uh what you would
[59:53] be he never thought of you as a sinner
[59:55] never never thought of you as a low life
[59:58] he never that's something that the devil
[1:00:00] thought of you and and made you to be
[1:00:02] that in God's mind he saw you as a son
[1:00:06] he saw you perfect he saw you holy he
[1:00:09] saw you righteous he saw you capable he
[1:00:12] saw you as a conqueror he saw you as
[1:00:15] Victorious now we are becoming that
[1:00:18] expression of a thought amen our life
[1:00:21] has been changed from low life to a Son
[1:00:23] of God Amen we live defeated but now
[1:00:26] we're Victorious we we were slaves to
[1:00:29] the devil but now we're free amen and
[1:00:31] we're now coming to the expression of
[1:00:34] what God thought us to be before the
[1:00:37] foundation of the world ain't that right
[1:00:40] amen see so brother brandom said his
[1:00:43] thoughts is the Christian of today God's
[1:00:46] thoughts if you want to know God's
[1:00:47] thoughts today look at the Christian I'm
[1:00:49] talking about real Christian of today
[1:00:52] that's God's thoughts because a
[1:00:54] Christian is an expression of the
[1:00:56] thoughts that God thought before the
[1:00:58] foundation of the world Amen so what a
[1:01:02] what a day that we're living in to be
[1:01:05] able to see the scriptures fulfilled
[1:01:08] ain't that right amen just like this uh
[1:01:11] Psalms
[1:01:12] 10216 when the Lord shall build up Zion
[1:01:16] he shall appear in his glory when the
[1:01:20] Lord shall build up Zion amen now that
[1:01:23] was written in the Old Testament
[1:01:25] thousands of years ago but it was a
[1:01:27] prophetic of today that the Lord would
[1:01:30] build his church and when he gets her
[1:01:32] built he would appear in his glory amen
[1:01:37] see it's not a different Christ that
[1:01:39] will appear amen or that has appeared we
[1:01:42] could say it that way for Jesus said at
[1:01:45] that day you shall know that I am in my
[1:01:47] father and I am in you can you say man
[1:01:51] you in me and I in you so what what is
[1:01:54] this it's time for the manifestation of
[1:01:58] the sons of God you manifested the world
[1:02:01] long enough you manifested the
[1:02:03] attributes of your first birth long
[1:02:05] enough but now it's time for the
[1:02:08] manifestation of the thoughts of God
[1:02:11] which are the sons and daughters of God
[1:02:14] that's where we're living at this is the
[1:02:15] day that we're living in no other time
[1:02:18] outside this time has it been the time
[1:02:21] to manifest sons of God that's what a
[1:02:23] prophet said amen even what what they
[1:02:26] done in the book of Acts was great but
[1:02:28] no greater time is it in this age Amen
[1:02:32] to be manifested as sons of God Amen
[1:02:35] this is the time so the manifestation of
[1:02:38] the sons of God what is it son of man
[1:02:41] revealed do you believe that son of man
[1:02:44] revealed we saw the son of man revealed
[1:02:46] in a prophet amen a redeemed son amen
[1:02:49] which was the first fruits amen of the
[1:02:52] of the other fruit coming up and now I
[1:02:55] am looking look at a the son of man
[1:02:57] being revealed in a a the whole body of
[1:03:01] Christ not just one member amen but the
[1:03:04] entire body the manifestation of sons of
[1:03:09] God Amen so what is it it's showing
[1:03:12] forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:03:16] today and forever we're the one that's
[1:03:18] declaring through the manifestation that
[1:03:21] he's not a different Jesus Christ but
[1:03:23] what he was back then he still here
[1:03:26] today doing the same things the same
[1:03:29] Works he's the same in power he's the
[1:03:31] same in in attitude he's the same in
[1:03:34] Holiness he's the same in every aspect
[1:03:37] amen outside of the Corporal body
[1:03:40] because now he doesn't need his Corporal
[1:03:42] body to come and and be upon the Earth
[1:03:44] and dwell among men he's got his
[1:03:47] mystical body his bride body and she is
[1:03:51] him can you say amen amen that's exactly
[1:03:54] what was in God's mind uh uh from the
[1:03:58] beginning of the world so Hebrews 138
[1:04:02] which was the theme of brother bram's uh
[1:04:05] uh uh uh uh Ministry was Jesus Christ
[1:04:08] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:04:13] when Jesus of yesterday if we could say
[1:04:16] it that way 2,000 years ago what was he
[1:04:19] then amen when he walked the Earth he
[1:04:22] manifested God Amen he didn't manifest
[1:04:26] the church he didn't manifest the
[1:04:28] doctrine he didn't glorify himself he
[1:04:30] manifested God Amen what was it see the
[1:04:34] prophet said what the father was he
[1:04:37] manifested himself in the son what the
[1:04:40] father's was everything the father was
[1:04:43] was manifested in the son amen the
[1:04:46] father dwelt in The Son which the son
[1:04:49] was the Tabernacle of God how many
[1:04:51] believes that amen he he he was the
[1:04:54] Tabernacle of God this is why Jesus said
[1:04:56] when you see me you see the father amen
[1:04:59] but I'm looking at Tabernacles of God in
[1:05:02] this age amen see so Jesus proved that
[1:05:06] he had all the qualities of God in him
[1:05:09] see he was what God is he was what God
[1:05:14] is he lived like God he acted like God
[1:05:17] he spoke like God he did the works of
[1:05:20] God he loved like God he cared like God
[1:05:24] he expressed the power of God the very
[1:05:27] same power amen that created the world
[1:05:30] was the same power that was expressed in
[1:05:33] Jesus Christ not a different God not a
[1:05:36] different power but the same power can
[1:05:39] you say amen that's right amen the Bible
[1:05:42] called him the expressed image of God
[1:05:45] Amen the prophet said see he was God
[1:05:48] expressing himself in man to man amen
[1:05:53] Jesus Christ see was God
[1:05:56] expressing himself in man to man amen
[1:06:00] another place and I got a lot of quotes
[1:06:01] but he says there was no other character
[1:06:04] anywhere that could that could have
[1:06:06] produced such a person as Jesus Christ
[1:06:10] but God himself how many believes that
[1:06:13] amen and I say it today there's no other
[1:06:15] person that could express the character
[1:06:18] of Jesus Christ in this age but God
[1:06:21] himself do you believe that amen that's
[1:06:24] why it has to be God in you the same God
[1:06:27] that was in Christ now must be in you
[1:06:30] Amen to produce the very same character
[1:06:33] that was produced amen 2,000 years ago
[1:06:37] now the prophet speaking of Christ says
[1:06:40] he was God's
[1:06:41] manifestation of love power and deity
[1:06:46] and everything was in him ain't that
[1:06:50] right now did you know that Jesus just
[1:06:52] didn't happen to appear on the Earth but
[1:06:57] he was
[1:06:58] sent amen amen that's what he said the
[1:07:01] father had sent him amen that's right he
[1:07:04] was sent to Earth the father sent him
[1:07:07] now why was he sent John
[1:07:10] 3:16 it says for God so loved the world
[1:07:14] how many's glad for that God so loved
[1:07:17] the world that he gave or we could say
[1:07:20] he sent his only begotten son that who
[1:07:25] whoever believeth in him should not
[1:07:28] perish but have everlasting life for God
[1:07:30] sent not his son into the world to
[1:07:32] condemn the world but that the world
[1:07:35] through him might be saved can you say
[1:07:37] Amen so God so loved amen the world that
[1:07:41] he wanted the world to be saved
[1:07:44] therefore he sent Christ amen into the
[1:07:48] world so the Bible also says that God
[1:07:51] anointed uh Jesus of Nazareth with the
[1:07:54] Holy Ghost
[1:07:56] and with power who went about doing good
[1:08:00] and healing all that were oppressed of
[1:08:02] the devil for God was with him God not
[1:08:06] only sent him God was with him and how
[1:08:10] did God send him how was God with him
[1:08:14] God was in him can you say amen God was
[1:08:18] in him and Jesus said as the father sent
[1:08:21] me so send I you amen he ain't sending
[1:08:25] you in This World by yourself amen but
[1:08:28] the prophet would declare deity is not
[1:08:30] in heaven deity is in you which shows as
[1:08:34] the father had sent him so has he sent
[1:08:36] us amen by being in us now God so loved
[1:08:42] well then who was it that God really
[1:08:44] loved amen the prophet said he loved the
[1:08:48] unlovely he loved the
[1:08:50] ungodly can you say amen and he didn't
[1:08:54] just love a certain color of people or a
[1:08:57] certain nationality of people amen see
[1:09:01] but the Bible would say here in
[1:09:03] Revelations 5:9 thou H has redeemed us
[1:09:06] to God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[1:09:10] and tongue and people and Nation God so
[1:09:15] loved the world Amen it doesn't matter
[1:09:18] if they speak English or not God loves
[1:09:20] them amen and there's going to be people
[1:09:22] from all over this world whether it's
[1:09:25] black or whether it's brown whether it's
[1:09:27] uh yellow white whatever there is going
[1:09:30] to be a bride that come out from the
[1:09:32] world that God so
[1:09:36] loved can you
[1:09:38] sayen God so loved that It produced The
[1:09:42] Savior to the world he so loved that It
[1:09:47] produced that love produced a remedy for
[1:09:50] sin God so loved that he sought to save
[1:09:53] us amen and to heal us and to deliver us
[1:09:58] ain't that right see God's love is how
[1:10:01] we got Jesus Christ and we must not
[1:10:04] forget that now amen God so loved amen
[1:10:09] that It produced Jesus Christ a savior A
[1:10:12] Healer a deliverer a a way maker amen a
[1:10:16] redeemer ain't that right see and
[1:10:19] there's nothing else that could produce
[1:10:21] him amen not man's love could produce
[1:10:24] Jesus Christ amen not an a a mortal love
[1:10:29] or an Earthly love or lust love or
[1:10:31] filthy love or what there's only one
[1:10:34] kind of love that could produce such a
[1:10:36] person as Jesus Christ and that's Divine
[1:10:40] love
[1:10:43] amen and if you notice he was sent the
[1:10:46] Bible says he was manifested to destroy
[1:10:49] the works of the devil he was sent to
[1:10:52] destroy the works of the devil the
[1:10:55] prophets had spoken of him there had
[1:10:57] been songs written about him amen uh
[1:11:01] sung about him uh poets had written
[1:11:04] about him and all the Old Testament
[1:11:07] types and shatters had had testified of
[1:11:10] of him but he had to be manifested amen
[1:11:15] uh it it it it wasn't good enough that
[1:11:18] they they wrote about him it wasn't good
[1:11:21] enough amen that they sung about him it
[1:11:23] wasn't good enough that they preached
[1:11:25] and prophesied of him he had to be
[1:11:28] manifested can you say amen and to
[1:11:30] fulfill what love was looking
[1:11:34] for amen God so Lov that It produced a
[1:11:38] manifestation of Jesus
[1:11:42] Christ brother Brandon would tell us
[1:11:45] then Jesus came to break the clouds back
[1:11:48] so that attribute could display itself
[1:11:51] that attribute is you that attribute
[1:11:54] could not come and and and you could not
[1:11:58] be expressed as an attribute of God
[1:12:01] without Jesus Christ coming first and
[1:12:04] and breaking them clouds and of darkness
[1:12:07] and condemnation and sin away amen he
[1:12:11] said that's it he is God's expressed
[1:12:14] word now nothing else could be
[1:12:17] manifesting other characters had all
[1:12:19] Fallen then you see what Jesus what did
[1:12:22] Jesus come to bring back those
[1:12:25] characters he come to bring back those
[1:12:28] Fallen characters ain't that right see
[1:12:32] he says then you see what Jesus did to
[1:12:34] bring back those characters no they they
[1:12:37] were born in sin shaped in iniquity he
[1:12:40] came as a redeemer everybody say he came
[1:12:44] as a redeemer and to redeem anything is
[1:12:47] to bring it back bring it back it was
[1:12:50] God's thought
[1:12:52] you bring back God's Fallen
[1:12:56] thought ain't that right so he says see
[1:13:00] it was God's thought you think little
[1:13:03] you little me no one in the world could
[1:13:06] take my place nobody can take yours you
[1:13:09] being a Christian and filled with the
[1:13:11] spirit God and before the foundation of
[1:13:14] the world seen you knowed every feature
[1:13:17] that you got see and Jesus come to bring
[1:13:20] you back that's what Jesus was here for
[1:13:23] the Redeemer the human body to bring you
[1:13:26] back and that had to come to be a human
[1:13:30] see a as a redeemer to display his
[1:13:33] attributes as Savior come to redeem you
[1:13:36] and bring you back from where you come
[1:13:39] from oh I'm so glad to know I came from
[1:13:42] him that's what Jesus said I came from
[1:13:45] God and I go back to God but you come
[1:13:48] from God and you're going back that's
[1:13:51] where we're headed to can you say Amen
[1:13:54] this world ain't our home amen but we're
[1:13:57] not returning to him as Sinners cuz
[1:14:00] that's not where we was we're not
[1:14:02] returning to him as some fallen down
[1:14:05] degenerated person that's not what we
[1:14:08] came
[1:14:13] from another place brother brandham said
[1:14:16] what was Jesus manifested for to show
[1:14:19] God now keep that in mind is to show God
[1:14:24] the purpose of Christ see was because
[1:14:27] God so loved and it manifested him now
[1:14:32] so so I hope I hope it's you're
[1:14:35] understanding it's to show God he was
[1:14:37] manifested for that purpose and through
[1:14:40] that purpose he achieved a
[1:14:44] church that he the fullness of
[1:14:48] God the fullness of God might bring back
[1:14:52] or bring to pass every promised word of
[1:14:55] of God in these last
[1:14:58] days can you say
[1:15:00] Amen so he says when he gets the
[1:15:04] pinenes the preeminence in the church
[1:15:07] the position his place in the church he
[1:15:11] was able to get his place in Christ in
[1:15:15] that human body upon the Earth 2,000
[1:15:18] years ago and look what he done and now
[1:15:22] he's getting his place in another body
[1:15:26] a bride body a many membered body of
[1:15:29] which we
[1:15:32] are you believe
[1:15:34] it another place he said see God was
[1:15:38] with us in the sun cleansing his way
[1:15:42] condescending coming down making a way
[1:15:45] for me to get back and bring his people
[1:15:49] back to manifest manifested sons of God
[1:15:53] like they had them in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:56] the whole world's are groaning and
[1:15:58] waiting for that hour for the
[1:16:01] manifestation of the sons of
[1:16:04] God oh my see so do you see what love
[1:16:08] was looking for love was not looking for
[1:16:11] Christ per se he was looking to redeem
[1:16:15] us love was looking to bring us back and
[1:16:20] love produced the Messiah love produced
[1:16:24] The Savior and through that savior
[1:16:26] there's a remedy for us to come
[1:16:30] back can you sayen love was looking for
[1:16:34] you and I see to come back to being sons
[1:16:38] of God God wasn't just satisfied with
[1:16:41] just a a natural animal atonement a
[1:16:43] natural blood atonement Amen to where we
[1:16:46] would come and but but he wanted that
[1:16:48] that didn't have the power to bring us
[1:16:50] back uh to Eden Eden condition it didn't
[1:16:54] have the power to bring us back to sons
[1:16:57] of God again can you say Amen see so we
[1:17:01] find that love love was looking for you
[1:17:04] and I to be brought back to where we
[1:17:07] came from where we were fallen from love
[1:17:11] look for a remedy and found it Christ is
[1:17:16] the
[1:17:17] remedy Christ is the remedy to all your
[1:17:22] troubles Christ is the remedy to the
[1:17:24] world
[1:17:25] problems Christ is the remedy to church
[1:17:29] problems Christ is the remedy to marital
[1:17:32] problems Christ is the remedy to mental
[1:17:35] problems physical problems spiritual
[1:17:38] problems Christ is the
[1:17:43] remedy ain't that
[1:17:45] right and love found it God so
[1:17:53] loved now the prophet said the word was
[1:17:55] invisible until it was made flesh and
[1:17:58] then the word become visible and through
[1:18:01] his sacrificial death at Calvary and his
[1:18:04] resurrection positionally placed his
[1:18:07] church in that Rim that the same
[1:18:11] invisible God could come into the
[1:18:14] individual and make the word
[1:18:18] visible an't that
[1:18:20] amazing prise the Lord same invisible
[1:18:24] God could now out now through the
[1:18:25] sacrifice of Christ take you as that
[1:18:29] individual and make the word that is
[1:18:32] invisible make it
[1:18:36] visible another place he said you are
[1:18:38] brought to Christ by the Holy Spirit who
[1:18:40] woed you through the blood of Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ and presented him as a
[1:18:46] gift oh my prise God Christ you are
[1:18:52] God's gift to Christ
[1:18:55] Christ is now pres or God presenting you
[1:18:57] to Christ as a
[1:19:03] gift showing that his labor was not in
[1:19:07] vain the sacrifice wasn't in vain
[1:19:10] Calvary wasn't in vain his rejection
[1:19:13] wasn't in vain love produced something
[1:19:17] love not only produced The Savior It
[1:19:19] produced the results of it it produced
[1:19:23] the results of Redeemer it produced the
[1:19:25] results of Calvary Divine love did it
[1:19:28] can you say Amen if love produced The
[1:19:31] Savior Love produced a
[1:19:39] redeemed so you're his love gift to
[1:19:42] Christ Christ is God's love gift to
[1:19:45] you ain't that right so we read
[1:19:50] Ephesians now
[1:19:51] again
[1:19:53] five and and it says be ye therefore
[1:19:56] followers of
[1:19:58] God now notice now be ye therefore
[1:20:01] followers of God Paul is not asking
[1:20:04] something that's
[1:20:07] impossible if it was impossible then
[1:20:09] there's no point in in in writing it in
[1:20:12] the scriptures right but it is
[1:20:17] possible you've
[1:20:19] redeemed you're Blood
[1:20:21] Bought that's it amen sister Bonnie it's
[1:20:25] really good to see you I didn't see you
[1:20:27] earlier God bless you
[1:20:30] amen and you're Blood Bought you're
[1:20:33] redeemed you're
[1:20:36] loosed and it was perfect blood that
[1:20:38] loosed you so it brought forth a perfect
[1:20:42] loosening now be followers of
[1:20:45] God if you were to look this up in the
[1:20:48] Greek it would say be ye therefore
[1:20:51] imitators everybody say imitators
[1:20:54] imitators ERS of God as dear children
[1:20:58] see so is it possible for us to imitate
[1:21:00] Christ sure Romans 8:11 it says but if
[1:21:05] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:21:07] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:21:09] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:21:11] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:21:14] spirit that dwelleth in
[1:21:17] you and you amen if his spirit's not in
[1:21:21] yet then don't don't don't worry about
[1:21:22] being imitator of Christ you can't do it
[1:21:26] but if his spirit is in you that's who
[1:21:29] he's talking to is a people who have the
[1:21:32] spirit of God it's the same spirit that
[1:21:35] was in Christ and it quickened his
[1:21:38] mortal body now it's quickening your
[1:21:41] mortal
[1:21:44] body now how many believes that
[1:21:46] quickening power has come to us in this
[1:21:48] day that ain't just to say in that
[1:21:50] scripture it has come to us look uh uh
[1:21:55] Luke 21:25 and there shall be signs in
[1:21:57] the Sun and now speaking of our day and
[1:22:00] in the moons and in the stars and upon
[1:22:02] the Earth distress of nations with
[1:22:04] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[1:22:07] brother brand said that's our TI of
[1:22:08] waves and things amen that are happening
[1:22:11] men's Hearts failing them for fear Amen
[1:22:15] brother Brandon applied that to this day
[1:22:16] never an age has men's heart been filled
[1:22:19] with fear as it in this age for looking
[1:22:22] after those things which are coming upon
[1:22:24] the Earth for the powers of Heaven shall
[1:22:26] be shaken and then shall they see the
[1:22:29] son of man coming in a cloud with
[1:22:34] power can you say Amen remember now
[1:22:37] brother Bram tells us you know jumping
[1:22:39] shouting and running all over the
[1:22:41] building that's not power that's
[1:22:43] blessings now we're talking about power
[1:22:46] the son of man came with
[1:22:48] power you believe that amen power and
[1:22:52] great glory in a cloud
[1:22:56] amen amen see and brother Brandon says
[1:22:59] what it's quickening power that's the
[1:23:04] token that must be displayed can you say
[1:23:08] Amen so John 14:18 I will not leave you
[1:23:11] comfortless I will come to
[1:23:14] you yet a little while and the world
[1:23:17] seeth me no more but you see me because
[1:23:19] I live you shall live also what happened
[1:23:22] quickening power come am quick and your
[1:23:26] mortal body amen and at that day you
[1:23:29] shall know that I'm in the father and
[1:23:31] you in me and I in you brother brand
[1:23:34] says at that day what day this day can
[1:23:37] you say Amen so the son of man in this
[1:23:40] day has come in power in a cloud with
[1:23:44] power and great
[1:23:46] glory amen and there's a group of people
[1:23:49] that has now seen it and understanding
[1:23:51] what it is he's come to us in his quick
[1:23:54] quickening power he's quickened us and
[1:23:56] we know that he is in the father we are
[1:23:59] in him and he is in
[1:24:05] us we know brother brandham said that
[1:24:08] same Spirit identified in the same
[1:24:11] manner of ministry has come upon a man
[1:24:14] at the end of the Gentile
[1:24:17] age ain't that right amen and we know
[1:24:21] that that that was brother brandham amen
[1:24:24] see but now he says the called out
[1:24:28] church is to be acting in his stead upon
[1:24:31] on the earth taking his
[1:24:37] place isn't that awesome that God would
[1:24:40] choose lowly
[1:24:42] you someone that the world would
[1:24:44] consider
[1:24:46] insignificant and yet God would choose
[1:24:48] you to take his
[1:24:52] place taking Christ's place
[1:24:55] how can you do it because his blood was
[1:24:57] so powerful that it could loose you from
[1:24:59] sin it could sanctify you it could
[1:25:02] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and then
[1:25:05] come and live himself and express
[1:25:08] himself have the prance in you to where
[1:25:12] you could take his
[1:25:14] place
[1:25:15] amen right so the called out church is
[1:25:20] to be acting in his stead upon the Earth
[1:25:22] taking his place today
[1:25:24] so he says now because that same spirit
[1:25:27] that was in him would be in them you the
[1:25:32] same spirit that was in Christ would be
[1:25:34] in you they would do the very same
[1:25:40] works now listen
[1:25:43] church I know we we're coming in we've
[1:25:47] come into an invasion of of demonic
[1:25:49] spirits in the world you're seeing the
[1:25:53] lid of hell has been taken
[1:25:56] off demons have poured in in this nation
[1:26:00] in the
[1:26:01] world and and it's becoming more than
[1:26:04] just people
[1:26:06] thoughts of evil it's an expression of
[1:26:09] evil we're literally seeing demons
[1:26:12] expressing itself in human
[1:26:16] beings ain't that
[1:26:19] right but it's not to destroy you it's
[1:26:22] to give you an opportunity
[1:26:25] to show God's power in this
[1:26:29] world are you with me you young people
[1:26:31] are not to be a statist another
[1:26:34] statistic in the world our marriages is
[1:26:37] not to be another statistic in the
[1:26:41] world to where we just end up in divorce
[1:26:44] and we're separated and our homes are
[1:26:46] broken and and all of these things
[1:26:48] that's not to
[1:26:51] be and and if if you've experienced that
[1:26:54] in life you know the blood of Christ is
[1:26:56] here for you but I'm talking to these
[1:26:58] young
[1:27:00] people
[1:27:02] hello amen that's not what God intended
[1:27:05] for you God never intended for this this
[1:27:08] body Amen to be victim of the
[1:27:12] devil it's our opportunity to express
[1:27:15] the power of Jesus Christ in this
[1:27:20] age yes sir so he says see
[1:27:24] any people that is truly the body of
[1:27:27] Jesus Christ the true church WIll
[1:27:28] manifest the same works that Jesus and
[1:27:31] the Pentecostal Church as did Jesus and
[1:27:34] the Pentecostal church because the same
[1:27:36] spirit will be in them any other church
[1:27:40] that does not have the spirit and the
[1:27:43] manifestations is going to have an
[1:27:45] account H have to account to God can you
[1:27:48] say Amen now notice the church is to
[1:27:52] have because Jesus manifested the father
[1:27:55] in love power and
[1:27:59] deity
[1:28:01] amen I I mean even even they came to him
[1:28:04] and says we know that you you're come
[1:28:05] from God a man come from God because no
[1:28:07] man can do the works that he's doing
[1:28:09] except God be with
[1:28:11] him right see so he wasn't manifesting a
[1:28:15] church he was manifesting
[1:28:20] God now this word imitate be imit ators
[1:28:24] followers of God means to follow as a
[1:28:28] pattern model or example to produce a
[1:28:31] copy to make something so that it
[1:28:34] resembles an existing
[1:28:38] thing you cannot imitate God except God
[1:28:42] himself comes in you amen and lives his
[1:28:46] life amen right so we're not a church
[1:28:50] that's a fraud a
[1:28:52] fake it's the Real
[1:28:56] Deal his Ro blood is flowing in you his
[1:29:01] spirit is flowing in you you are
[1:29:03] literally partakers of his divine
[1:29:07] nature
[1:29:09] right right amen so notice be be
[1:29:13] imitators or followers of God as dear
[1:29:17] children so so it is impossible to be an
[1:29:20] imitator of God without being a gene
[1:29:22] seed of God because he's talking to the
[1:29:25] children of of God see so remember what
[1:29:29] 1 John 3:2 says beloved now everybody
[1:29:32] say now now we are the sons of God now
[1:29:36] we are it's that's been settled if
[1:29:39] you've been saved Sanctified filled with
[1:29:41] the Holy Ghost you shouldn't wonder if
[1:29:43] you're a Son of God or not I know the
[1:29:45] devil tries to convince you that you're
[1:29:46] not but you should look at that devil
[1:29:48] and say that's a lie I am no longer a
[1:29:50] sinner I'm no longer bound by you I'm a
[1:29:53] son of and daughter of God I got a
[1:29:56] different purpose now that's why I don't
[1:29:58] want to be Crows with the world I'm a
[1:30:01] I've got a different purpose I'm
[1:30:03] different from
[1:30:06] that that's right children should be
[1:30:10] imitators of their
[1:30:12] father is this not what causes a child
[1:30:15] to come into
[1:30:20] adoption in the Old Testament you know
[1:30:22] brother Bram talked about you know the
[1:30:24] child being born of of of a certain
[1:30:27] family his father has got a domain a
[1:30:30] kingdom a farm and or business or
[1:30:34] whatever you know and and you know the
[1:30:39] the father goal is for that son to take
[1:30:41] over that business take over
[1:30:44] everything but he knows that that boy's
[1:30:47] just a little boy he can't give it to
[1:30:49] him now he he he'll squander everything
[1:30:52] he don't know nothing there you go but
[1:30:54] the father is so busy uh uh uh with the
[1:30:58] kingdom and making sure all the Affairs
[1:30:59] are taken care of the Prophet said that
[1:31:02] he would hire a he he would bring in a
[1:31:05] teacher a tutor someone that is very
[1:31:09] well trusted someone that really knows
[1:31:11] the father someone that's personal
[1:31:14] connection with the father amen and and
[1:31:16] he's going to teach that boy the way of
[1:31:18] the Father the the duties that the
[1:31:21] father has the kingdom he's going to
[1:31:23] teach way the the father thinks about it

[1:31:28] way the father deals with things he's
[1:31:30] going to teach that to the
[1:31:33] son and and he talks about that if the
[1:31:36] son was an obedient child then the
[1:31:39] teacher could say to the father oh that
[1:31:41] little fella he's one of the smartest
[1:31:44] little chaps I've ever seen oh even
[1:31:47] though he's youthful uh he's a chip off

[1:40:20] evil ungodly thing and and he could set

[1:40:28] that you're free Stand Fast in
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:33] that I understand we have memory and we
[1:40:36] have all of these things conscience and
[1:40:38] all that and and it seems like in
[1:40:40] different seasons of our life Satan
[1:40:42] comes back and tries to tempt us with
[1:40:44] certain things but that's where you've
[1:40:46] got to keep your guard up you you know
[1:40:48] where your faults are you know where
[1:40:49] your weaknesses are you know where Satan
[1:40:51] is good at amen trying to tempt you then
[1:40:53] you stay away from them
[1:40:59] things why because there's it's demonic
[1:41:02] spirits that are trying to bring us back
[1:41:05] into bondage again can you say amen I
[1:41:09] hope this all right look look what
[1:41:11] happened in the days of Noah Genesis 61
[1:41:14] and it came to pass when men began to
[1:41:16] multiply on the face of the Earth and
[1:41:18] daughters were born unto them that the
[1:41:19] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[1:41:22] that were Fair that that they were Fair
[1:41:26] beautiful
[1:41:28] right and they took uh uh took to them
[1:41:32] wives of all which they
[1:41:34] chose now if you study it brother
[1:41:37] brandom talks about this age and
[1:41:39] remember Jesus said as it was in the
[1:41:41] days of Noah so shall it be in the in
[1:41:43] the revealing of the son of man we know
[1:41:45] the son of man is here it's been
[1:41:47] revealed so now we that understands the
[1:41:50] character of things brother brandham
[1:41:52] open opens that up to us women were so
[1:41:55] beautiful back then they were women of
[1:41:58] Cain from Cain's
[1:42:02] descendants and the sons of God Sons of
[1:42:06] Adam saw these women and lusted after
[1:42:10] them it wasn't true heartfelt
[1:42:13] love it was lust
[1:42:21] love and they became the Propet said
[1:42:23] women
[1:42:26] Chasers brother Braham said it become a
[1:42:28] sexual thing is that what it's become
[1:42:31] today a sexual
[1:42:35] thing that's why women feel like they've
[1:42:37] got to you know maybe our girls feel
[1:42:40] like they've got to dress sexy get get
[1:42:43] the get bring the skirts up a little bit
[1:42:45] more and more and Tighter and the blouse
[1:42:47] Tighter and get everything just to get a
[1:42:49] God to if you have to do that to get a
[1:42:51] God to look at you he's he's junk
[1:42:54] amen I don't know how else to say it
[1:42:57] he's lower than a dog in my
[1:43:01] opinion a like brother Bram said your
[1:43:04] beauty comes from
[1:43:07] within that's what God sees as beautiful
[1:43:10] God God sees the character it's it's
[1:43:13] just like even brother Brown said about
[1:43:15] the character of a church he said God
[1:43:17] doesn't look at the building the beauty
[1:43:19] of the building we look at the beauty of
[1:43:20] the building that's not what God counts
[1:43:22] he counts character that's the beauty of
[1:43:25] the church is
[1:43:30] character we may not be much to the
[1:43:32] world but we're beautiful before God we
[1:43:35] are a beautiful bride because his
[1:43:37] character is being formed within
[1:43:41] us may not be much talented we may not
[1:43:44] much not may may not be much of anything
[1:43:46] but to God we're
[1:43:49] beautiful that's right so brother Braham
[1:43:52] said it was a perversion it was a sex
[1:43:55] mixup it was the very thing that drove
[1:43:58] the children of God from the Garden of
[1:43:59] Eden now is is what caused God to take
[1:44:03] peace off the Earth and to destroy the
[1:44:07] Earth when men lusting after
[1:44:11] women and brother Braham said after they
[1:44:13] lusted after they lusted after this
[1:44:16] marriage then came the marrying and
[1:44:18] giving in marriage because it wasn't
[1:44:19] true
[1:44:21] love right
[1:44:23] it's like oil and water so it become
[1:44:26] marriage and
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:28] divorce that's right see and it he said
[1:44:31] see marriage and divorce it's it's
[1:44:33] because the sons of God looked at the
[1:44:35] attractiveness of
[1:44:37] women ain't that right history says that
[1:44:40] women became so pretty and attractive
[1:44:43] that men became slaves to
[1:44:47] them now we we have to say it and you
[1:44:50] know it very well that the the spirit of
[1:44:53] lust sex adultery has taken preeminence
[1:44:57] in this
[1:44:58] nation and around the
[1:45:01] world it's taken up by storm brother
[1:45:04] brandham says the extremity or the
[1:45:06] extreme beauty of women has so increased
[1:45:08] in the past 50 years to pick up a
[1:45:11] picture of 50 years ago what an
[1:45:13] attractive women look like he said I was
[1:45:15] looking the other day in the history of
[1:45:17] the wars and how that pearl white about
[1:45:19] a hundred years ago when she was stabbed
[1:45:21] by Scott Jackson her lover and the looks
[1:45:23] of the woman now also of Mary Bon
[1:45:27] Bonville boneville Bonville and some of
[1:45:30] the so-called attractive women of 50 to
[1:45:33] 100 years ago compare them with the
[1:45:35] women of today they wouldn't stand in a
[1:45:37] shadow certainly not Burley see women
[1:45:41] has become dainty feminist and so forth
[1:45:44] more attractive what is it they dress
[1:45:48] themselves more
[1:45:50] attractive where the women you used to
[1:45:53] wear big great big dresses and sleeves
[1:45:55] and long skirts and hid their body
[1:45:58] because they didn't want men lusting for
[1:46:00] them amen can you sayen they only live
[1:46:05] for one man that chose them for wife
[1:46:08] today the women pour themselves into the
[1:46:11] little clothes and immorality is on such
[1:46:13] a move and a rampage till it's beyond
[1:46:16] even thinking can you say
[1:46:19] Amen see so you see where it's come from
[1:46:21] it's a devil that that's anointing them
[1:46:24] but we're Sons and Daughters of
[1:46:27] [Music]
[1:46:31] God you love him we find that many have
[1:46:35] conformed to the themselves to the
[1:46:37] spirit of hate murder
[1:46:42] divisiveness amen you say well I got a
[1:46:44] right to defend myself you better watch
[1:46:46] that Spirit
[1:46:48] now and you better keep that balance to
[1:46:51] that
[1:46:55] amen
[1:46:59] hello we find that Millions have
[1:47:01] conformed themselves to a religious
[1:47:03] spirit having a form of godliness and
[1:47:05] denying the power
[1:47:06] thereof see it's demonic spirits that
[1:47:09] are unseen but now they're manifesting
[1:47:13] themselves in the people because these
[1:47:16] Spirits have now taking
[1:47:18] control don't let the devil take control
[1:47:21] of you don't let him take control of
[1:47:23] your
[1:47:25] mind come on
[1:47:27] Church can't let him take control of the
[1:47:30] church can't let him take control of our
[1:47:34] home amen see and we're finding now that
[1:47:38] many people cannot lay aside every
[1:47:40] weight and sin that so easily has beset
[1:47:42] them they they're they're entrenched
[1:47:45] they're entangled they they become
[1:47:47] slaves to this thing sure hello the
[1:47:51] Bible says if a man loves the world or
[1:47:53] the even the things of the world the
[1:47:55] love of God is not in
[1:47:59] them you understand that you can't love
[1:48:02] the things of the world and have the
[1:48:04] love of God in you amen true the love of
[1:48:07] the world will not produce
[1:48:10] Christ and we're called as a body of
[1:48:13] Christ to produce
[1:48:14] Christ amen can you say Amen brother
[1:48:18] Bram said all that is in the world the
[1:48:20] lust of the flesh the pride of life the
[1:48:22] lust of the eyes is not of God but of
[1:48:24] the world I mean that's what Paul would
[1:48:26] tell us right so brother brandom says
[1:48:29] this it's too bad that the things of the
[1:48:30] world has so captured the church in
[1:48:32] these days and Satan had a rude way of
[1:48:34] doing it to bring in the televisions
[1:48:36] right into the homes and things and
[1:48:38] corrupting the minds of the people till
[1:48:40] today that a great present uh of the
[1:48:44] church that called themselves Christians
[1:48:46] will stay home from prayer meeting on a
[1:48:48] Wednesday night uh to get to see some
[1:48:50] favorite program of somebody from h
[1:48:52] hwood or somewhere that oughtn't even to
[1:48:55] be put out on the screen maybe living
[1:48:57] with three or four husbands or wives and
[1:49:00] carrying on and living all kinds of
[1:49:02] lives go out drunk on drunk parties
[1:49:05] smoking lying and everything that can be
[1:49:07] done that's wrong and then it's put up
[1:49:10] on the screens right and our church are
[1:49:12] fashioning theirselves even our dress in
[1:49:14] this day becomes after Hollywood what a
[1:49:17] Pity it's got to be see uh that our
[1:49:20] minds uh uh can't stay pure pure and
[1:49:23] holy with Christ it's done something to
[1:49:26] the church it's crippled it it's done a
[1:49:28] horrible thing all our papers and
[1:49:31] everything just seems to be corrupted
[1:49:33] but listen friends it's in that hour of
[1:49:35] corruption and that time of corruption
[1:49:37] that God draws himself a bride that
[1:49:41] comes out of that corruption that's what
[1:49:43] he's looking for to get a church that's
[1:49:45] called by his name somebody that looks
[1:49:48] for a life that has no end are you with
[1:49:51] me we we ain't just looking at
[1:49:54] everything and being affected by all
[1:49:56] these things we're looking up lift your
[1:49:59] head up your Redemption drath nah don't
[1:50:02] get your eyes up here you'll be
[1:50:04] contaminated with
[1:50:08] it see so notice God truly expects us to
[1:50:12] be imitators of
[1:50:14] him because in that second verse he says
[1:50:17] Walk In Love walk everybody say walk in
[1:50:21] love walk walk in love as Christ hath
[1:50:26] loved
[1:50:28] us and gave himself for us an offering
[1:50:32] and a sacrifice to God for a sweet
[1:50:35] smelling
[1:50:37] Savor so the love that we are to walk in
[1:50:40] is the same love that Christ had for
[1:50:47] us we've talked about it I believe last
[1:50:50] Sunday but the love with which he had
[1:50:51] for us
[1:50:53] is agapo love agapo love is the highest
[1:50:56] form of love which is an exotic love
[1:51:01] remember we talked about the Exotic it
[1:51:03] means something that is foreign
[1:51:04] something introduced from a strange
[1:51:06] country it it it's it's it's an exotic
[1:51:10] love it ain't something that we just
[1:51:12] have by birth it's something that comes
[1:51:15] to us from something that we know
[1:51:17] nothing about ain't that right it's
[1:51:20] foreign to mankind see and foreign means
[1:51:22] something that is in introduced from
[1:51:24] another country mysteriously different
[1:51:27] unusual so so this this kind of love
[1:51:30] does not come to us through teaching it
[1:51:32] it does not come by way of learning
[1:51:34] about it we we we can talk about the
[1:51:37] importance importance of having this
[1:51:39] kind of love and we should John wrote
[1:51:42] about it and tells us that it is a must
[1:51:45] that we need it brother brandom talked
[1:51:46] about it and and and and and all of
[1:51:49] these things but no man no matter how
[1:51:51] much he teaches about it no matter how
[1:51:53] much he writes about it no matter how
[1:51:55] much he sings and all these things about
[1:51:57] the love nobody can give us love like
[1:52:00] this God
[1:52:03] himself it takes
[1:52:06] God can you say amen and no man can
[1:52:10] possess This Love Without possessing God
[1:52:13] for the Bible says God is
[1:52:16] love amen you with
[1:52:19] me no wonder this is how Christ could
[1:52:22] could portray such
[1:52:25] love because God was in him
[1:52:30] amen John said he that loveth not
[1:52:33] knoweth not God for God is love remember
[1:52:37] in 1 Corinthians the 13th chapter it
[1:52:39] tells us a man can speak with tongues of
[1:52:41] men and of and of angels a man can have
[1:52:43] the gift of Prophecy a man can have
[1:52:47] understanding of all Mysteries and to
[1:52:49] have all knowledge he can have all Faith
[1:52:52] so that he can move
[1:52:53] mountains a man can bestow all all of
[1:52:57] his Goods to feed the poor can give his
[1:53:00] body to be
[1:53:01] burned and yet not have God true you say
[1:53:06] well that that's charity but God is
[1:53:10] Charity God is
[1:53:12] love but all these things can be
[1:53:15] done and a man not have God at all he
[1:53:19] can feed the poor he can raise up John
[1:53:20] 3:16 missions he can do all these things
[1:53:23] and still not have God is't that
[1:53:27] amazing see so here's the thing though
[1:53:30] without this kind of love it's all to no
[1:53:35] avail hello it took this kind of love to
[1:53:39] redeem
[1:53:41] us it took this quality of love to set
[1:53:44] us free yes amen it wasn't human love
[1:53:47] that done this it was God's love ago
[1:53:51] love that's why would take God
[1:53:57] himself what if Jesus preached the
[1:53:59] gospel and yet did it without
[1:54:04] love what if he healed the sick and yet
[1:54:06] did it without love what if he turned
[1:54:08] the water and to Wine raise the dead
[1:54:10] without having love it would be to no
[1:54:12] avail that's
[1:54:13] right he would have had selfish motives
[1:54:17] he would have done it all to build a
[1:54:18] name for himself brother bradam says
[1:54:21] unless each one of these gifts is put
[1:54:24] right in the center of Love it'll become
[1:54:26] selfish and indifferent and pull itself
[1:54:29] off and isolate itself have you notice
[1:54:33] Mo a lot of these Ministries today
[1:54:35] isolate themselves it that's nothing new
[1:54:37] brother Terry we've been seeing this
[1:54:40] through a through through
[1:54:42] time men rise up in the message and they
[1:54:45] get this
[1:54:47] certain
[1:54:49] whatever and and they get get a drawing
[1:54:52] and before you know it they start
[1:54:54] isolating themselves and keeping the
[1:54:55] people to
[1:54:57] them because they've got a Ministry
[1:54:59] without
[1:55:03] love so he says unless each one of these
[1:55:07] Min gifts is put right in the center of
[1:55:10] Love it'll become selfish and
[1:55:12] indifferent and pull itself off and
[1:55:14] isolate itself cross over and fuss and
[1:55:18] stoop but when it's anchored right into
[1:55:20] the middle of Love it'll Fellowship
[1:55:23] everywhere see so if Jesus didn't have
[1:55:26] love he would have compromised the first
[1:55:28] opportunity he
[1:55:31] had right and he was given some amen he
[1:55:35] would have quit the first hard trial
[1:55:37] that came if he didn't have
[1:55:39] love he he he he would have catered to
[1:55:43] The Temptations that Satan offered him
[1:55:47] if he didn't have love true amen that's
[1:55:50] why you know you you it's hard to it's
[1:55:53] hard to trust a Ministry when they're
[1:55:56] looking for something else greater
[1:55:58] something great and can't be satisfied
[1:56:00] where God's placed them see they've not
[1:56:03] come to
[1:56:04] love they they might come up with a good
[1:56:07] sermon they might come up with good
[1:56:08] things they might have good gifts they
[1:56:10] might have great things but but if
[1:56:12] they're looking around for something to
[1:56:14] better
[1:56:16] themselves then they ain't got that
[1:56:18] quality that of love that Jesus had
[1:56:23] am can you say
[1:56:26] Amen see cause cuse the Bible says he
[1:56:30] endured the
[1:56:33] cross and despising the
[1:56:36] shame he could not have done that
[1:56:39] without
[1:56:41] love he had the power to call 10,000
[1:56:45] angels down but love kept
[1:56:47] him from doing it
[1:56:53] amen notice now for it says in 1
[1:56:57] Corinthians 13:7 that love beareth all
[1:57:00] things everybody say beareth all
[1:57:02] thingsare love beareth all things love
[1:57:06] believeth all
[1:57:08] things hopeth all things endureth all
[1:57:12] things now love in in this when he says
[1:57:16] believeth all things it does not mean
[1:57:17] that it's just gullible to believe
[1:57:19] everything but Christ so loved us that
[1:57:22] he believed in us he believed in that
[1:57:25] word about us can you say Amen church he
[1:57:28] believed in it he believed in it and
[1:57:31] sometime we can't believe in one another
[1:57:33] because we ain't got that type of
[1:57:37] love
[1:57:39] amen he cried out while hanging on the
[1:57:42] cross saying father forgive them for
[1:57:44] they know not what they do well he
[1:57:45] couldn't have done that without love for
[1:57:48] the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 13:5
[1:57:50] that love does not behave itself
[1:57:52] unseemingly seeketh not her own is not
[1:57:56] easily provoked thanketh no evil can you
[1:58:00] sayen amen and here acts 8:32 says he
[1:58:03] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:58:06] like a d lamb dumb before his sheer Soul
[1:58:09] opened he not his mouth which tells us
[1:58:13] that love does not seek revenge love
[1:58:16] does not seek
[1:58:19] retaliation Church
[1:58:22] if it had not been
[1:58:24] love we wouldn't be here
[1:58:30] today because we certainly don't we we
[1:58:33] don't we're not worthy of Mercy we're
[1:58:35] not worthy of Heaven we're not worthy of
[1:58:37] anything by All rights God should have
[1:58:40] retaliated for our our blunders and our
[1:58:43] mistakes and our
[1:58:45] unbelief and our doubt and our
[1:58:47] questioning
[1:58:49] him but love sought for a
[1:58:54] remedy how we need
[1:58:57] love amen love seeks for a
[1:59:01] remedy so behold what manner of love is
[1:59:04] this as John would say it's a love that
[1:59:06] could only come from God and and we know
[1:59:09] Paul would tell us that God was in
[1:59:11] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:59:13] himself ain't that right I ain't going
[1:59:16] to keep you much longer but but I want
[1:59:18] to get finish my thought Jesus expressed
[1:59:23] God to the People by expressing the love
[1:59:28] of God prise the
[1:59:30] Lord right amen so a gift of Prophecy
[1:59:36] does not express God to the
[1:59:39] people a gift of healing does not
[1:59:42] express God to the people working
[1:59:44] miracles doesn't Express God to the
[1:59:46] people preaching the gospel doesn't
[1:59:48] Express God to the people can you say
[1:59:50] Amen knowing all the Mysteries and
[1:59:52] having all knowledge doesn't Express him
[1:59:55] brother bradam says the only way that
[1:59:57] God can be expressed to the people is
[2:00:00] through
[2:00:05] love can you say
[2:00:07] Amen so he says in another place Jesus
[2:00:10] expressed God's love when he was here on
[2:00:12] Earth in so many different ways till it
[2:00:15] is undisputable that he was the most
[2:00:17] loving creature that ever
[2:00:19] lived not that he was the most gied not
[2:00:23] that he was the most spiritual not that
[2:00:25] he was whatever he was the most loving
[2:00:28] creature that ever
[2:00:30] lived in every aspect he displayed God's
[2:00:33] love in so many
[2:00:34] ways can you say
[2:00:36] Amen see love love motivated him to show
[2:00:42] the Messiah sign how many believes that
[2:00:45] love it was love that motivated him to
[2:00:48] show the Messiah sign amen
[2:00:52] even though he knew that it would cause
[2:00:55] jealousy among religious people they
[2:00:59] would become jealous of him but yet his
[2:01:03] love caused him to do it anyways so that
[2:01:07] the people could know God was among them
[2:01:12] yes amen look at the same
[2:01:15] thing the Messiah sign of today done the
[2:01:19] same thing it caused men to become come
[2:01:22] jealous it caused men to become
[2:01:24] impersonators it caused men to to to
[2:01:28] whatever but yet love
[2:01:31] caused that gift to
[2:01:34] work so that we could know God and know
[2:01:38] that he was present Among
[2:01:41] Us many you say amen
[2:01:44] amen so love caused him to do it see
[2:01:47] love caused Jesus to stand we could say
[2:01:51] it this way in in in in the prayer line
[2:01:53] night after night so was it with this
[2:01:57] way in this age every night night after
[2:02:00] night brother Brandon said Jesus had
[2:02:02] prayer
[2:02:03] lines and he was tired and he was
[2:02:07] weary but yet love caused him to do this
[2:02:12] so that the people would know that the
[2:02:15] promised
[2:02:16] Redeemer was here was on Earth can you
[2:02:20] say Amen love callus him to speak the
[2:02:23] mystery of who he was to the people even
[2:02:25] though he knew that people were going to
[2:02:27] walk away from him and even though it
[2:02:29] would it would cause him to be
[2:02:31] crucified yet he wanted the people that
[2:02:34] he El to
[2:02:36] know that God was there among in in in
[2:02:39] flesh hello amen that's why he would say
[2:02:43] I came from my father I go to my father
[2:02:47] that's why he said except you eat this
[2:02:48] flesh My Flesh and drink this Blood you
[2:02:50] have no life in you what was he
[2:02:52] declaring he was declaring he was not
[2:02:54] just man he was
[2:02:56] God and he had to let the people
[2:02:59] know are you with
[2:03:01] me amen and so is it in this age the
[2:03:05] opening of the word that third pool was
[2:03:07] the opening of the word amen and it had
[2:03:09] to be opened for this
[2:03:12] elect and yet it caused our Prophet to
[2:03:15] be rejected that's
[2:03:18] righten but he still would preach
[2:03:20] marriage and divorce he would still
[2:03:21] preach you know Christ is the mystery of
[2:03:24] God revealed he would still preach these
[2:03:26] things unto the
[2:03:29] people love caused it to
[2:03:31] happen are you with
[2:03:34] me love caused Christ to sanctify
[2:03:39] himself for the sake of those who were
[2:03:41] following him brother Braham said he was
[2:03:44] a lamb what did he do he had a right to
[2:03:46] a home he was a he was a man he had a
[2:03:48] right to be married he was a man he he
[2:03:50] had a right to good clothes he was a man
[2:03:52] but he Sanctified himself he forfeited
[2:03:55] he he could have come down the corridors
[2:03:57] of Glory a full statured man with an
[2:04:00] Angelic band but he Sanctified himself
[2:04:02] he could have at least been born in a
[2:04:04] nice clean bed somewhere but he was born
[2:04:06] in a manger over a manure Pile in a
[2:04:09] borrowed manger but he Sanctified
[2:04:11] himself why he was the lamb see friends
[2:04:14] we got to get back Amen to assembly line
[2:04:18] religions and so forth and all these
[2:04:20] things were getting away from from the
[2:04:22] real things humble yourself everybody
[2:04:25] say humble yourself keep humble Lord
[2:04:29] sanctify me now why was he though
[2:04:32] sanctifying himself he said Jesus was
[2:04:35] training some men that was going to take
[2:04:38] the gospel to all the world 12 men so we
[2:04:41] lived a Sanctified life and forfeited
[2:04:44] every worldly pleasure for their
[2:04:48] sake Divine love divine love caused him
[2:04:52] to do
[2:04:55] this say he was setting an example
[2:04:58] brother brandom in another place said he
[2:05:00] was training 12 men that was going to
[2:05:01] take the gospel to all the world so he
[2:05:03] Sanctified himself for their sake I
[2:05:05] sanctify myself for their sake a gift of
[2:05:08] God keeping himself Sanctified oh gifts
[2:05:12] of God you people who claim that you've
[2:05:14] received the spirit keep yourself
[2:05:16] Sanctified keep away from the things of
[2:05:19] the world be sanctified
[2:05:22] I think that's what we need is
[2:05:24] love that keeps us Sanctified love that
[2:05:28] keeps us apart from the
[2:05:32] world that keeps the pulpits
[2:05:35] clean that keeps the offices
[2:05:39] clean can you say Amen not Dilly ding in
[2:05:43] sin in the world and then and then
[2:05:45] getting behind the pulpit and you know
[2:05:47] just because we can preach that that's
[2:05:49] not the point Love Takes it it takes
[2:05:51] takes
[2:05:54] Love Takes love brother Braham said we
[2:05:57] ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing
[2:05:59] our worldly pleasures and things like
[2:06:01] that for the sake of the people we're
[2:06:03] trying to lead God lead to God ain't
[2:06:06] that right we're trying to lead the
[2:06:08] outside world to God we need
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:15] love love that causes us to be
[2:06:18] Sanctified Lord love that causes us
[2:06:21] Daddy to live a right life before our
[2:06:23] families love that causes us to keep
[2:06:27] this the uh to live a right life upon
[2:06:29] the jobs or wherever we're at at schools
[2:06:31] or wherever
[2:06:33] love we've got this you know people get
[2:06:37] this attitude I don't care what people
[2:06:38] think let them think what they want you
[2:06:41] ain't got love
[2:06:42] yet and I understand you know you can
[2:06:46] live a Christian life and you're going
[2:06:47] to be persecuted by that Christian Life
[2:06:50] I get that brother Brown Paul would tell
[2:06:53] us now that's where the blessing comes
[2:06:55] when you're persecuted for Christ's sake
[2:06:57] but when you're persecuted for your
[2:06:59] foolishness when you're persecuted for
[2:07:02] hypocrite
[2:07:06] life can you say Amen then that should
[2:07:09] cause us to look at our lives see we
[2:07:11] need love I hope you understand I know
[2:07:15] we're on our own people I get that but
[2:07:18] love causes us to think sure
[2:07:22] if I do this I know it may not even be a
[2:07:24] sin to me but if I do this what does
[2:07:27] other people
[2:07:30] think I'll just be honest if if that's
[2:07:33] okay you know
[2:07:37] uh sometime you know uh there's you know
[2:07:42] okay whether you agree with it or not
[2:07:44] but there you know uh sometimes my wife
[2:07:48] uses uh uh cooking wine or wine for
[2:07:51] cooking or
[2:07:52] whatever you know
[2:07:56] and uh a while you know a couple years
[2:07:59] back you know she said well should I
[2:08:01] just go into the you know store and get
[2:08:04] it I said absolutely
[2:08:07] not yeah but I'm just getting it for
[2:08:09] cooking it's not and I said no we're not
[2:08:12] going to do that I said what if somebody
[2:08:14] sees
[2:08:16] this what what if they see you walking
[2:08:18] in that that store then what are you
[2:08:20] going to do
[2:08:22] and you're over there getting wine now
[2:08:24] you may be doing it for
[2:08:25] cooking but what is the other people
[2:08:27] going to say about it you understand
[2:08:29] what I'm saying brother Ram even said
[2:08:30] about going into a hotel room with a
[2:08:32] woman he said now to counsel with her or
[2:08:35] being in a room with a woman he said
[2:08:38] that now that may that ain't going to
[2:08:40] hurt me he said that may not even hurt
[2:08:41] me at all I'm just going into counsel
[2:08:44] with her but what if somebody sees me
[2:08:47] going in that room with a woman
[2:08:52] you understand what I'm saying and and
[2:08:55] so so but what what kept Him from doing
[2:08:58] these things
[2:08:59] love love because he knew that if he was
[2:09:02] preaching the gospel he wanted the
[2:09:05] people not to have questions about his
[2:09:08] life amen that's why we must walk true
[2:09:11] to all men that's why we must walk
[2:09:14] honestly we don't want people thinking
[2:09:16] we're a hypocrite and church if you
[2:09:19] think I'm a hypocrite please come and
[2:09:20] tell me
[2:09:22] because I I want to be right right I
[2:09:24] don't want my children thinking I'm a
[2:09:26] hypocrite I don't want my wife thinking
[2:09:28] I'm a
[2:09:29] hypocrite I'd rather repent to them if
[2:09:32] I've done something wrong I Repent to
[2:09:33] them I I want to be
[2:09:37] right you understand what I'm
[2:09:39] saying why because
[2:09:42] love that's
[2:09:45] true we're trying to bring the most
[2:09:47] important message to the
[2:09:49] people amen yes
[2:09:52] sir
[2:09:54] hello even brother Brown told a joke and
[2:09:57] he tells it on on tape the joke that he
[2:10:00] told told a joke to a woman or to a man
[2:10:04] he went home and told her
[2:10:05] husband take that I'm getting this wrong
[2:10:08] here he told a
[2:10:10] man and the man went home and told his
[2:10:14] wife they thought it was funny but the
[2:10:17] wife was offended by it brother Brown
[2:10:20] said I went to to her and apologize for
[2:10:23] it or telling the
[2:10:26] joke because it offended
[2:10:29] her you understand what I'm saying so if
[2:10:32] we're not careful we live such lives so
[2:10:36] loosely not thinking about what our
[2:10:39] children are doing what they're thinking
[2:10:41] about what the world what our employees
[2:10:43] what our boss what whatever is thinking
[2:10:46] we need the love of
[2:10:49] God we need the love of God that would
[2:10:52] drive us to seek a remedy for
[2:10:56] division it's easy to
[2:10:58] retaliate it's easy to look at the
[2:11:01] situation say that's their
[2:11:04] fault but Jesus didn't do that and it
[2:11:07] was our fault no question about
[2:11:11] it he was hated without a
[2:11:15] cause and yet there is innocent hanging
[2:11:18] on a cross saying father forgive them
[2:11:21] for they know not what they
[2:11:26] do can you say
[2:11:29] Amen see walk in love and I I'm not
[2:11:32] going to keep you much longer I know
[2:11:35] we're at the end but I had a lot more
[2:11:37] but I will say it this
[2:11:39] way we're at The Headstone that's
[2:11:43] right we're at the capping of the
[2:11:46] church where the headstone is coming and
[2:11:49] remember the church cannot not be
[2:11:52] complete without
[2:11:55] it and remember we've come through
[2:11:57] justification sanctification the baptism
[2:11:59] of the Holy Ghost now some want to stop
[2:12:02] there and say that's it but brother
[2:12:04] Brown said no sanctification made way
[2:12:06] for or justification made way for
[2:12:09] sanctification Luther made way for
[2:12:12] Wesley's message Wesley's message made
[2:12:14] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:16] Pentecost and Pentecost made way for the
[2:12:19] Holy Ghost himself the person to come
[2:12:23] into
[2:12:24] that and brother brand said that's the
[2:12:27] Capstone see the church can't be
[2:12:30] complete so where are we at are we are
[2:12:35] we are we at the the bottom of the
[2:12:37] pyramid where it's just so
[2:12:39] wide no we've been going up up up up up
[2:12:43] we' passed justification sanctification
[2:12:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost now we're in
[2:12:48] the Capstone age
[2:12:52] which is
[2:12:53] him coming into
[2:12:56] that which is
[2:13:01] Charity no wonder Satan is fight fight
[2:13:05] so hard on this these
[2:13:07] things but a Ministry cannot be
[2:13:09] effective without
[2:13:12] love you may be despised you may be
[2:13:14] rejected you may be spat upon hated
[2:13:18] whatever but let it be because of Christ
[2:13:23] Christ and yet even though they don't
[2:13:26] repent and even though they don't say
[2:13:29] sorry and even though they don't see
[2:13:31] that they're wrong and even though they
[2:13:33] despise you and reject you and be them
[2:13:36] put on holy
[2:13:39] eror love them
[2:13:41] anyhow love seeks a
[2:13:44] remedy can you say man you love
[2:13:48] him Lord if the musicians will
[2:13:56] come the ministry of
[2:13:58] love we all know brother Brown said
[2:14:01] we've come to a time where only love
[2:14:03] will be found in the elect that's right
[2:14:06] love is being taken away from the
[2:14:09] world and we're seeing it more and more
[2:14:12] and more hate
[2:14:14] murder rejection division fighting
[2:14:18] fussing just read where the other day
[2:14:21] just a bunch of people got in a fight in
[2:14:24] a brawl allout brawl in an
[2:14:26] airport just an allout brawl they
[2:14:29] getting fights in PLS they're getting
[2:14:31] fights in the courts now they're getting
[2:14:33] fights everywhere cuz hate has hate has
[2:14:36] taken over love is gone but the only
[2:14:39] thing will be found is love in the elect
[2:14:41] because there's a Capstone Christ
[2:14:44] himself
[2:14:47] charity God has found a body
[2:14:52] that he could come and reflect that same
[2:14:55] Divine
[2:14:57] love that he did through
[2:15:00] Christ can you say
