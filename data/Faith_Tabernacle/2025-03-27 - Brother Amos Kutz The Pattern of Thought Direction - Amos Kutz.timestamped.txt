[26:41] to me tonight. May you grant it in the
[26:44] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

[28:43] place I can
[28:46] [Music]
[28:48] go. He's a shield from every
[28:55] tempest. He's an
[28:57] anor that is sure.
[29:01] In times like
[29:03] these, it's good to
[29:11] know
[29:14] God
[29:16] is my refuge.
[29:22] He's a strong and mighty
[29:27] tower that I
[29:29] can run
[29:32] into.
[29:35] God
[29:37] is my refuge.
[29:44] Without
[29:46] him, what would I
[29:50] [Music]
[30:03] do? I was
[30:05] wondering from his
[30:09] shelter up ahead. I could not see those
[30:15] storm
[30:16] clouds so
[30:19] heavy did
[30:24] roll. Then the storms beat hard against
[30:29] me. He called out and I ran to him.
[30:36] And I'll
[30:38] never
[30:40] wonder
[30:45] again.
[30:48] God
[30:50] is my refuge.
[30:55] He's a strong and mighty
[31:00] tower that I have run
[31:06] into.
[31:08] God
[31:10] is my
[31:14] [Music]
[31:16] refuge. Without
[31:19] him, what would I do?
[31:25] [Music]
[31:35] Man, are you glad we've got a strong and
[31:37] mighty tower? Amen. Oh, you are my
[31:44] refuge. You are my
[31:49] sanctuary. I'll never be afraid. Cuz
[31:54] you're my hiding place. And you are my
[32:00] refuge. And when the storm is
[32:05] raing underneath your
[32:08] wings, oh I rejoice and sing. You are my
[32:14] refuge. As brother Tim comes. Oh you are
[32:17] my refuge.
[32:20] You are my
[32:24] sanctuary. I'll never be
[32:27] afraid cuz you're my hiding place. Oh,
[32:32] you are my
[32:35] refuge. And when the storm is
[32:39] raing underneath your
[32:43] wings, oh, I rejoice and sing. You are
[32:48] my refuge.
[32:50] [Music]
[32:56] I'm so glad that he still is. Ain't you?
[32:59] We'll try this tonight, brother. I think
[33:01] it's
[33:05] G. I don't need
[33:10] to understand.
[33:13] I just
[33:15] need to hold his
[33:20] hand. I don't
[33:23] never need to ask the
[33:29] reasons why.
[33:33] [Music]
[33:35] Oh, I
[33:37] know he'll make a
[33:42] way through the night and through my
[33:48] days. I don't need
[33:53] to
[33:55] understand. I just need to hold his
[34:01] hand.
[34:06] Life is like a
[34:10] mighty sea, so tossed and driven.
[34:20] And
[34:20] below
[34:22] rise with thin the hearts of
[34:28] every
[34:32] man. And storms so many times will leave
[34:40] your heart with questions.
[34:47] But you don't need
[34:51] to
[34:53] understand. Just hold his
[34:59] hand. No, I don't need to un
[35:06] understand. I just need to hold his
[35:13] hand.
[35:14] I don't
[35:17] never need to ask the
[35:22] reasons
[35:27] why. For I know he'll make a
[35:35] way through the night and all my days.
[35:42] I don't
[35:44] need
[35:46] to
[35:48] understand. I just need to hold his
[35:58] hand. Very soon. This whole life I live,
[36:05] it'll soon be over.
[36:12] And I shall be with him
[36:18] upon that
[36:20] golden
[36:25] strand. And we'll look back
[36:30] upon this life that's now behind me.
[36:39] And then I'll know I don't need to under
[36:46] standing
[36:51] anymore. No, I don't need to
[36:58] understand. I just need to hold his
[37:04] hand.
[37:06] I don't
[37:08] never need to ask the
[37:13] reasons
[37:18] why. For I know he'll make a
[37:25] way through all my night and all my
[37:30] days.
[37:32] I don't need
[37:35] to
[37:37] understand. I just need to hold his
[37:47] hand. No, you don't need
[37:51] to
[37:53] understand. Just hold his hand.
[38:01] [Music]
[38:09] Amen. Amen. Are you holding his hand
[38:12] tonight? Amen. Most importantly, he's
[38:15] holding our hand. Amen. Can we just
[38:18] dance to our feet as we ask brother Amos
[38:21] to come?
[38:24] Amen. Oh, David. Oh, so
[38:28] small. And the giant stood so tall. The
[38:34] arms were just too high for little
[38:40] David. Oh, so he shook off all his
[38:45] foes. With the power of God, he was
[38:49] clothed. Oh, the battle's not mine. I
[38:52] give it to you, Lord. It's
[38:57] thine. Oh, the battle's none mine. Saith
[39:01] little David, Lord, it's thine. I'm in
[39:05] your
[39:07] favor. I give it all to
[39:11] you. Cuz I knew not what to do. And I'm
[39:16] so glad you let me see. Oh, that you're
[39:21] really all that I need. Oh, the battle's
[39:25] not mine. I give it to you, Lord. It's
[39:31] thine. Now, little David,
[39:36] unafraid, before the giant, he stood
[39:39] that
[39:40] day. It seemed to be the end for little
[39:46] David.
[39:49] Oh, but like the lion and the bear he
[39:52] slew, he knew that giant would come
[39:56] down, too. Oh, the battle's not mine. I
[39:59] give it to you, Lord. It's
[40:04] thine. Oh, the battle's not mine. Heat.
[40:08] Heat.
[40:09] [Music]
[40:31] [Music]
[40:35] Lord, it's
[40:37] fine. Oh, the battle
[40:40] stop said little David, Lord, it's
[40:44] thine. I'm in your favor.
[40:48] Give it all to
[40:50] you. People do not want to do. I'm so
[40:56] glad you made me
[41:00] see. You're really all that I need. The
[41:04] battle stop mine. I give it to you.
[41:08] Lord, it's
[41:12] mine. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Don't
[41:16] Aren't you glad you can sing songs like
[41:18] that and other songs like it and you
[41:20] just read between the
[41:22] lines? You know why that is? Cuz you got
[41:25] the Holy Ghost. And you know the prophet
[41:28] said the Bible has become a new book.
[41:30] This message is not just a message. It
[41:34] is the message.
[41:37] Amen. The message for me. How many can
[41:40] say it's for you. Amen. You got to be
[41:42] able to say it's for me. Amen. And so
[41:45] welcome each and every one of you
[41:46] tonight. Good to see the farmers and
[41:49] brother Matthew, brother Tim, and sister
[41:51] Farmer. And we appreciate you and coming
[41:53] up. And of course, we continue to pray
[41:55] for y'all and Lord will comfort your
[41:58] heart with uh passing of brother Virgil.
[42:01] But you know one thing, Brother Virgil's
[42:03] having a hallelujah time.
[42:06] Oh my
[42:08] goodness. He wouldn't want to come back
[42:10] to this world.
[42:13] He's in such a place.
[42:16] You imagine that? It's real. And it's
[42:20] not just but a few feet from us here
[42:22] tonight. Think about that. Wow. Praise
[42:26] the Lord. So God is good as the
[42:29] songwriter said, "But until then, my
[42:31] heart will go on singing until the day
[42:34] God calls me home." So let's let's turn
[42:38] in the word of God. Thank you musicians
[42:40] tonight. and we really appreciate the
[42:42] word that's been coming forth lately.
[42:45] Our pastor and over the weekend it was
[42:48] just so so much of a blessing to see
[42:51] little Shubble dedicated. I don't know
[42:53] about you, but I was really rejoicing
[42:57] uh great mission accomplished. Amen. It
[43:00] was a great triumph. Amen. over the
[43:04] power of darkness that tried to take the
[43:07] little fella's life. But mom and dad
[43:09] stood in there and grandparents too and
[43:11] everybody stood in with their prayers
[43:13] and God's bringing them through. Amen.
[43:15] You say, "Well, he's not out of the
[43:16] water." Well, he's sure come a mighty
[43:19] long way. Amen. The same God that
[43:22] brought them a mighty long way will take
[43:24] them to the omega. Amen. He is the alpha
[43:27] and the omega, the beginning and the
[43:29] end. And God will take them all the way
[43:30] through to the finish line. How many
[43:33] believes that? Amen. Just like the rest
[43:35] of us, God will take you all the way to
[43:38] the finish line. I'm not worried about
[43:39] it. He said, "So, see, how can you be so
[43:43] certain of that?" I got a personal
[43:45] revelation of that.
[43:48] God don't just give out a personal re
[43:50] revelation and then reneg on it. He
[43:54] stands true to what he said. And if he
[43:56] reveals to you that you're a son or
[43:58] daughter of him, you ought to be
[44:00] swinging from the ceiling fan. Amen. You
[44:03] ought to be so happy tonight. Amen. And
[44:06] then know I you say, you know, and you
[44:09] know, we all think this way. And this is
[44:11] not what I'm going to be speaking on
[44:13] tonight. But how many's ever thought you
[44:15] was a basket
[44:17] case? All right, I'll raise both of my
[44:20] hands to cover you, too. Well, I've
[44:23] often thought of myself as that. I I've
[44:25] got so
[44:27] many issues and issues. Oh Lord,
[44:34] and and so much this that that that
[44:38] that. But I'm in the hands of one
[44:42] who seen me locked up in a stone block.
[44:46] He said, "I see Moses in there. I see
[44:48] Amos down there locked up in that all
[44:53] that stuff that he's was born into. But
[44:58] he's a son of God.
[45:00] And thank God, you know, God has a way
[45:03] of bringing us
[45:04] out. Amen. and shaping. You know,
[45:08] Michael, what fascinates me the most is
[45:11] that Michelangel had the
[45:15] uh image in his mind of
[45:18] Moses and he
[45:20] captured, you know, if you look at some
[45:22] of the
[45:23] other other artist drawings, you know,
[45:26] brother Rams talked about Adam and Eve,
[45:28] how, you know, the artists, they had
[45:30] them looking like freaks almost. I mean
[45:33] that's but you know when Michael his
[45:35] divine inspiration hit him. It wasn't
[45:38] devil inspiration. It was divine
[45:41] inspiration hit him and how he and got
[45:45] everything
[45:46] proportionate. That's what fascinates me
[45:49] you know that he the human body they
[45:52] didn't get you know an arm looking like
[45:54] a great big old arm and a small head or
[45:57] something like that. You know,
[45:59] everything was proportionate, but more
[46:01] than that, it conveyed a
[46:03] message. And uh I think God is every one
[46:07] of us tonight is a masterpiece. You say,
[46:10] "I feel like a master mess. Been there,
[46:13] done that." But that's not my confession
[46:15] tonight because I'm confessing a
[46:19] masterpiece message. A
[46:22] masterpiece that will correct any life.
[46:27] a
[46:28] masterpiece that will bring about a
[46:31] totally matured son and daughter of God.
[46:35] Yes, sir. Period. Yes, sir. I don't have
[46:37] that power within myself. I don't have
[46:40] all the the self-help books to read, but
[46:43] I've got a book that's open and the
[46:46] mysteries have been open. The mystery of
[46:49] my life, the mystery of my calling, it's
[46:51] all in there. It's all in this revealed
[46:53] word.
[46:55] Therefore, I want to focus in on that.
[46:59] Let's bow our
[47:01] heads. Heavenly
[47:03] Father, we gathered here on a Wednesday
[47:06] evening,
[47:07] Lord, and know we've come off the job.
[47:10] We've come off of middle of the week,
[47:14] Lord. And we ask you, oh God, that you
[47:17] will just help us tonight, Lord. May you
[47:20] break the bread of life. May you take
[47:23] the bread in your hands and may you
[47:26] break it, Father. And help us to receive
[47:29] it, Lord. We pray. Keep us, Lord, from
[47:32] saying anything that would be
[47:34] detrimental or contrary to the word or
[47:37] detrimental to people's
[47:39] uh spiritual walk, dear God. And Lord,
[47:43] but may we liberally speak as as a
[47:48] tongue, Father God, not an unknown
[47:50] tongues, but Lord, in a known tongue,
[47:54] revealing the word from our lips. We
[47:57] pray, help us, oh God, with a simple
[48:00] thought tonight. I pray and I ask it now
[48:03] as we read your word. May you bless it
[48:05] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. So
[48:09] tonight, I want you to turn with me to
[48:11] the book of
[48:12] Philippians, chapter
[48:16] 2. And I want to read this as our text
[48:24] tonight. Philippians 2 and beginning at
[48:27] verse 5. Everybody have
[48:30] it? All right. He says, "Let this mind
[48:33] be in you which is also in Christ Jesus,
[48:38] who being in the form of God, thought it
[48:42] not
[48:43] robbery to be equal with
[48:46] God." Let's go back and read verse one
[48:49] again. When this really soaks in and
[48:52] you're saying, "Oh boy, let this mind be
[48:55] in
[48:57] you, which was also in Christ Jesus."
[49:01] And you got a a semicolon there. Verse
[49:05] six, who who's you? Who's he talking
[49:08] about? He's talking about Christ Jesus.
[49:10] Who being in the form of God thought it
[49:14] not
[49:15] robbery to be equal with God. Amen.
[49:20] made of himself no reputation, took upon
[49:23] him the form of a servant servant, and
[49:26] was made in the likeness of men. Being
[49:28] found in fashion as a man, he humbled
[49:31] himself, became obedient unto death,
[49:33] even the death of the cross. Wherefore
[49:36] God also has highly exalted him, given
[49:38] him a name which is above every name,
[49:41] the name of
[49:42] Jesus. Every knee should bow of things
[49:45] in heaven, things on earth, things under
[49:49] the earth, and that every tongue should
[49:52] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[49:56] glory of God the Father. Verse 13. For
[49:59] it is God which workketh in
[50:02] you both to will and to
[50:05] do his good pleasure. Let's read read
[50:09] the last verse again together. For it is
[50:12] God which workketh in you both to will
[50:16] and to do of his good pleasure. How many
[50:20] wants that tonight? How many wants it
[50:22] more and more in your life? Amen. Praise
[50:25] God. You can be seated.
[50:30] Tonight I want to speak a little bit on
[50:32] a thought here of the pattern of thought
[50:36] direction. The pattern of thought
[50:38] direction. We all remember how brother
[50:41] Brandham said there was a young boy
[50:43] growing up in a house and he had a
[50:45] picture of a ship or an airplane or
[50:48] something on the wall and the prophet
[50:51] said that that picture begin to
[50:53] influence his life and no doubt he begin
[50:57] to desire created something within him a
[51:00] desire to be more of a either a sailor
[51:03] or a airplane pilot or what have you
[51:06] because of the influence and you know no
[51:08] doubt he asked for he's seen a toy a toy
[51:12] boat and he got a boat and after a while
[51:14] he gets older and he wants a model boat.
[51:17] The kind that you know you build and you
[51:19] put together piece by piece and no doubt
[51:22] as he gets older and he learns how to
[51:24] read then he's starting to read more
[51:26] books about sailing and he wants to get
[51:30] a boat. He wants to get a boat and go
[51:32] out on the water and all the while his
[51:35] focus is on going to sea. Is he a
[51:38] sailor? Not just yet, but he's on his
[51:42] road.
[51:44] And so that's the same way with a pilot.
[51:47] He studies he he the boy starts out, you
[51:50] know, flying kites, flying this, making
[51:53] paper airplanes and in study hall in
[51:56] school like we used to do. Big old
[51:58] newspaper one time. Took that thing and
[52:00] great big old thing look like a giant
[52:03] bat or an eagle. And uh picked that
[52:06] thing up. Nobody was looking. Someone
[52:08] was looking. And I was on one side of
[52:10] the lunch hall, which was a high
[52:12] ceiling. I took that thing
[52:15] and I thought it had crashed. That thing
[52:18] glided all the way across the room and
[52:20] and everybody was there.
[52:25] Wow. Well, that's just that just shows.
[52:28] Now if a person stays in that they study
[52:31] begin to read about flying and and all
[52:35] of this and about birds and lift and how
[52:38] birds will set their wings. You know
[52:40] I've seen crows birds when they come in
[52:43] for a landing and they put their feet
[52:45] down and it's like their wings kind of
[52:47] go up. It's just a natural thing. It's
[52:51] part the way God made them. when they
[52:53] want to land their wing the legs go will
[52:57] they're laid back they're like landing
[52:59] gear on an airplane they'll suddenly
[53:01] come down when they come down and their
[53:04] wings go up and they just kind of settle
[53:06] down onto their
[53:07] feet so
[53:10] anyways a person stays in this in this
[53:14] mind
[53:15] channel and after you stay in that long
[53:17] enough you'll become whatever he is
[53:21] projecting into your life, what's
[53:24] projecting in your mind. You're under
[53:26] the
[53:27] influence. You know, our brother here, I
[53:31] know he likes horses and probably a lot
[53:32] of other stuff I don't know about, but
[53:35] he he felt a call to law enforcement.
[53:38] And my hats off to you, brother Matthew.
[53:41] Amen. Good to have a a good law man, a
[53:43] Christian, Holy Ghostfilled law man out
[53:46] there on the streets.
[53:47] Amen. And you know, he he has to think
[53:51] that. No doubt. I don't know what you
[53:53] all do. He's going through a lot of
[53:55] serious training. First, he was a uh a
[53:58] medical uh first responder and he stayed
[54:02] he had to go through training out there
[54:04] in the middle of the New River and uh
[54:06] February or March or something like
[54:08] that. Oh my goodness. Sitting on a
[54:10] rock. Oh, wet, cold,
[54:14] damp. That's part of the rescue. Cuz if
[54:17] your boat overturns in cold water,
[54:20] Brother Matthew or somebody like them's
[54:21] going to be out there to get you cuz
[54:23] they've been trained to fight those uh
[54:27] horrible currents that go through them
[54:28] rocks and they're like a a snake of the
[54:32] current going through the rocks. And you
[54:33] got to be able to know how to fight that
[54:35] stuff to rescue and to fight a current.
[54:39] Not only that, but to keep a person
[54:41] under control that's drowning. I mean,
[54:45] you have to almost use sometime lethal
[54:47] force, I guess, or something to get them
[54:49] under control so you can save their life
[54:51] or they'll pull us both down in the
[54:53] water. And that's happened already. But
[54:56] a person stays in that channel. And so G
[55:01] Paul says here, "Let this mind be in you
[55:04] which was also in Christ
[55:07] Jesus." Who being in the form of God,
[55:09] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[55:11] God. how we're not to be equal with God.
[55:14] We are sons. We are his offspring.
[55:17] He is our father. Amen. Amen. And he is
[55:22] Jesus Christ, our elder brother. Amen.
[55:25] Who was made flesh, who was God in
[55:28] flesh. And so we realize
[55:31] that God has a position. And this is
[55:35] where a lot of people I I I think of
[55:38] this. You're under the influence of
[55:40] something. Right. You know, you I've
[55:42] been years ago and I'll say this. I may
[55:45] may have said it
[55:47] before. We was into trail biking and all
[55:50] of that motorized trail biking and joy
[55:53] that still do it if I never get the
[55:55] chance bike on the road. But anyway,
[55:59] going into these motorcycle
[56:02] shops, I wasn't even a
[56:04] Christian. And I can remember going into
[56:06] a I believe it was a Honda motorcycle
[56:09] shop. You know, they're selling bikes.
[56:12] Oh my goodness. I never heard such in
[56:14] all my
[56:16] life. The what kind of a place you call
[56:19] this? They had the hard rock
[56:23] going really
[56:25] loud. There was all kind of scandaly
[56:28] clad women up on the, you know, selling
[56:32] the bike, you know, sitting on the bike.
[56:35] though. Oh my, I this this is
[56:38] uh I don't know. I just feel
[56:41] uncomfortable in here. I wasn't a
[56:43] Christian. I was used to gospel music,
[56:47] no television in my home. I was used to
[56:50] going to church. And that was foreign to
[56:54] me. Didn't sound right.
[56:58] And so, you know, now they're trying to
[57:01] sell, they're appealing to the sinner's
[57:04] senses. That's still going on today.
[57:08] And they try trying to appeal. So, but
[57:11] what you have on your walls, what you
[57:14] put before you, that's what you'll
[57:15] become.
[57:19] So, you you got to realize people, you
[57:22] get yourself in a pattern of thinking.
[57:39] The world lives by fatalistic dread. I
[57:41] want I meant to look the quote
[57:43] up in a church age book. What is
[57:47] fatalism? Fatalism is a very negative.
[57:50] And it says say says we're on a railroad
[57:53] tracks and we're bound to a destination
[57:55] whether we like it or not and you're
[57:58] going to go there whether you like it or
[58:00] not and you can't change it. That's
[58:04] fatalism. And little do people realize
[58:07] how fatalism will dictate if they're not
[58:10] careful. And you don't stay with the
[58:14] word. You get into a path say, "Well, my
[58:18] generation several generations back,
[58:21] they were all like that. And I'm bound
[58:25] to repeat exactly what previous
[58:28] generations had their battles and
[58:30] struggles with. And I'm not going to
[58:32] make it. I've got I've just got to go
[58:34] that way."
[58:36] Now, if you keep thinking like that, you
[58:39] will go that way.
[58:41] And the prophet said, "The way a tree
[58:43] leans, that's the way it's going to
[58:45] fall." The predictability on that is
[58:48] very clear. It's going to
[58:53] fall. We don't live by
[58:55] fatalism. We live by faith.
[58:59] We believe against all odds.
[59:04] I could pass this microphone around
[59:07] tonight starting in the front all the
[59:09] way back up to the
[59:11] front and I could ask you what are the
[59:14] odds against you? Now, not to be carnal,
[59:17] not to be a negative
[59:19] confessor, but I'd say we could come up
[59:22] with a pretty good
[59:23] list of of bad
[59:26] odds. But I want you to know God has
[59:29] already overcome all of the odds.
[59:33] So if you get him on the inside of you,
[59:35] it's no longer you overcoming, but it's
[59:38] him overcoming through you.
[59:43] Now, I believe in living a sanctified
[59:46] life, and I believe people should live a
[59:48] sanctified life, and I continue to live
[59:51] a sanctified life with the Holy Ghost.
[59:54] Amen.
[59:57] Now, years ago, we used to believe, and
[59:59] I know I ain't I ain't going to preach
[1:00:01] that
[1:00:02] tonight, but you know, I was around the
[1:00:05] pilgrim holiness. I was around the
[1:00:07] Wesley and Holiness people, and they
[1:00:09] believe it in an initial initial work of
[1:00:13] sanctification at the altar. You
[1:00:15] screamed, hollered, you got the victory,
[1:00:18] and then you were sanctified until you
[1:00:20] backslid. Then you had to go back and
[1:00:22] repeat it all over again.
[1:00:24] You see that was a life trying to live
[1:00:27] in the flesh a walk a way of legalism.
[1:00:32] Now do I say is that wrong to be
[1:00:34] sanctified? Absolutely not.
[1:00:37] I believe this that when when when God
[1:00:40] man sincerely desires to be
[1:00:45] saved and he gives his heart to God, he
[1:00:49] or she, all the worldly things will
[1:00:52] suddenly lose their appetite. That's
[1:00:54] right. And a trash can will be full of
[1:00:57] stuff
[1:00:59] that was detrimental to you. whatever it
[1:01:01] was, a six-pack
[1:01:03] or cigarettes or pornography or whatever
[1:01:06] or whatever this or whatever that, your
[1:01:10] trash can will fill up.
[1:01:13] You'll be hauling stuff to the dump.
[1:01:15] You'll be putting a shotgun blast in the
[1:01:17] television.
[1:01:19] Amen. Why? You no longer Yes, there's
[1:01:24] still something in you, but you feel a
[1:01:27] higher pull.
[1:01:29] You want more aware the feeling of
[1:01:33] salvation for your sin, for your life.
[1:01:37] You want more where that come from. So
[1:01:40] you're going to turn the valve off.
[1:01:42] You're going to shut the door. The
[1:01:44] mosquitoes are coming in. You're going
[1:01:46] to shut the door.
[1:01:48] You're going to make mosquito's life
[1:01:50] miserable by making smoke
[1:01:54] or putting out these tiki torches,
[1:01:58] right?
[1:02:00] You see, you don't want to entertain
[1:02:02] those things anymore. And that's
[1:02:04] sanctification.
[1:02:06] Yes. I believe every single one of us,
[1:02:08] even without the Holy Ghost, needs a
[1:02:10] work of sanctification.
[1:02:14] Amen.
[1:02:16] never ceases to amaze me how
[1:02:18] people that leave this
[1:02:21] message and I just got word a
[1:02:26] confirmation. I would have
[1:02:28] hoped that I would have been
[1:02:31] wrong on the two witnesses that I
[1:02:34] received that it was not
[1:02:36] true. but that a minister and his wife
[1:02:40] had left the message, had left the
[1:02:45] word. And it really amazes
[1:02:49] me how that people could take the word
[1:02:53] of God so quickly deny it.
[1:02:58] And a woman that's never wore
[1:03:01] pants can suddenly feel comfortable
[1:03:04] putting pants
[1:03:05] on. After all that word, after all that
[1:03:10] preaching and how that a woman's
[1:03:12] physique is not meant to be showed
[1:03:14] openly, but it's a private matter
[1:03:17] between her and her husband. Yes, sir.
[1:03:21] It never ceases to amaze
[1:03:24] me how that is one of the first things.
[1:03:27] Or cut their hair, men start wearing
[1:03:30] shorts,
[1:03:33] earrings. once believers of this
[1:03:36] message.
[1:03:38] You know what? As I said here not long
[1:03:41] ago, some of you might have seen what I
[1:03:44] said, but that's a slap in the
[1:03:48] face to all the bygone people who laid
[1:03:52] in an altar
[1:03:54] and cried out to God to be saved and
[1:03:57] sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost under the light of that
[1:04:02] yesterday. who who lived brother
[1:04:05] Brandham said drink water out of a
[1:04:07] bridge lived those soda crackers
[1:04:11] went to sh even financial income I mean
[1:04:15] not that they they proud themselves but
[1:04:18] they turned on
[1:04:20] careers to stay with the word of God for
[1:04:24] their hour what a slap in the
[1:04:29] face grandmas grandpas
[1:04:32] was about all gone now. Sister
[1:04:36] Brenda, I used to see him when I first
[1:04:38] came to Christiansburg going in the
[1:04:40] roses, going in the hills department
[1:04:44] store. See a godly woman come in there
[1:04:47] with uncut hair, long
[1:04:49] dress, Pentecostal lady of some
[1:04:52] sort. Oh, there's still maybe one here,
[1:04:55] one there anymore. But you don't see
[1:04:57] them old-timers no more. that little
[1:04:59] group that was down there that one day,
[1:05:01] Brother Farmer, when I was preaching for
[1:05:04] brother Mike, was it Mike Newman? I
[1:05:06] always get the name mixed
[1:05:07] up down at Jill Coffee
[1:05:10] or Junior Newman, I'm sorry. When I was
[1:05:14] preaching down there and we had that
[1:05:15] Sunday evening service and went over to
[1:05:18] a McDonald's
[1:05:20] afterward and a group of people come
[1:05:22] walking in there, I told Brother Junior,
[1:05:25] I said, "Who are those people?"
[1:05:28] godly, holy looking people. He said,
[1:05:30] "They go over that Pentecostal holiness
[1:05:32] church down the road."
[1:05:35] I said, "Wow, what a testimony." It
[1:05:38] looked like the most godly bunch you
[1:05:40] ever seen.
[1:05:42] Now look where they're at. That's been
[1:05:44] almost 30ome years ago. What a slap in
[1:05:47] the face
[1:05:49] to people who understood the light. The
[1:05:52] only the the cloudy daylight, if you
[1:05:55] will, and lived under that as far as
[1:05:59] they could go with it. What a slap in
[1:06:02] the face.
[1:06:06] I don't know about you, but boy, it it
[1:06:08] really my righteous
[1:06:11] indignation at the day of judgment,
[1:06:13] there'll be no excuse.
[1:06:15] Amen.
[1:06:18] I heard
[1:06:20] how brother Porter or who was it said
[1:06:24] their
[1:06:26] daddy or grandpa or
[1:06:28] whoever laid it in there and lung for
[1:06:31] 30ome
[1:06:32] years and had the Bible hanging on piano
[1:06:36] strings above
[1:06:38] them. And they had to stay in that iron
[1:06:41] alone all those
[1:06:42] years. And then they took him out to
[1:06:45] bathe him, do whatever he needed to do.
[1:06:47] Put him on a rocking table so he keep on
[1:06:51] breathing. There'll be no excuse for
[1:06:54] dusty
[1:06:55] Bibles. I don't care what you are.
[1:06:57] Pentecost, Pentecostal, Baptist, I don't
[1:07:00] care what you are. Dust on the Bible, no
[1:07:02] excuse. A man in an iron lung for 30ome
[1:07:06] years reading a Bible helmet and have to
[1:07:09] have somebody change the pages for him.
[1:07:12] Amen. My God, help us.
[1:07:18] I'm not preaching to anybody here. I'm
[1:07:20] not I'm not pointing people
[1:07:24] out. Anyway, we got to move
[1:07:28] along. Let this mind be in you which was
[1:07:31] also in Christ Jesus, who being in the
[1:07:34] form of God, God has a position for
[1:07:37] every one of us. a beloved bride. A
[1:07:40] beloved masterpiece of a
[1:07:42] bride. Praise God. Another scripture I
[1:07:45] want to read. I've got a lot to cover
[1:07:47] tonight if time will allow as much as we
[1:07:49] can. We'll go as far as we can. And I've
[1:07:52] spoke on this before. I'm just kind of
[1:07:54] title it different. He says in
[1:07:56] Colossians 2 and 9, "For in him dwelleth
[1:08:00] all the fullness of the Godhead bowly,
[1:08:01] and ye are
[1:08:03] complete." How many knows what the word
[1:08:06] complete is?
[1:08:08] You know, do you know what the word
[1:08:10] complete
[1:08:11] means? It's finished. It's done. Like
[1:08:14] brother Shawn was preaching, it is
[1:08:17] finished.
[1:08:19] which is the head of all principality
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:23] power. In whom also you are circumcised
[1:08:27] with the circumcision made with hands in
[1:08:29] putting off the body of sins of the
[1:08:31] flesh by the circumcision of
[1:08:33] Christ, buried with him in
[1:08:36] baptism, wherein also ye are risen with
[1:08:39] him through the faith of the operation
[1:08:42] of God, who hath raised him from the
[1:08:45] dead.
[1:08:47] And you being dead dead in sin and
[1:08:49] trespasses, sins and uncircumcision of
[1:08:51] your
[1:08:53] flesh, hath he quickened together with
[1:08:56] him, having forgiven you all
[1:08:59] trespasses, blotting out the handwriting
[1:09:02] of ordinances that was against us, which
[1:09:05] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[1:09:09] the
[1:09:10] way. In other words, he took it out of
[1:09:13] your way and nail it on his cross. put
[1:09:16] the blame on
[1:09:18] me. If anything's old, it's on my
[1:09:21] account. Aren't you glad the old account
[1:09:24] was settled long ago and the records
[1:09:27] clear today for he washed my sins away.
[1:09:31] The old account was settled long ago.
[1:09:35] And so he says, and this is what I want
[1:09:37] to just uh say a little bit about in
[1:09:41] verse
[1:09:42] 15, having spoiled principalities and
[1:09:47] powers, he made a show of them, openly
[1:09:50] triumphing over them in it.
[1:09:53] Now, I like to I'd like to take a look
[1:09:56] at these words spoiled.
[1:10:00] It says that Jesus
[1:10:03] spoiled principalities and power. So I
[1:10:06] want to, you know, sometimes you think
[1:10:08] you know the meaning of a word, the
[1:10:11] meaning of a phrase, brother
[1:10:13] Matthew. You think you know and then you
[1:10:17] find out there's a little bit more to
[1:10:19] that than what you thought. And that's
[1:10:21] why it's good to study and to read. And
[1:10:24] that's why we should have lexicons and
[1:10:26] and Bible study dictionary and help you
[1:10:30] and whatever you know and the message of
[1:10:32] the hour. So he spoiled means this it
[1:10:36] means to
[1:10:38] diminish or to destroy the value or to
[1:10:42] impair.
[1:10:45] In other words, these it's like the
[1:10:49] nerve
[1:10:50] center. He spoiled principalities and
[1:10:55] powers. He impaired them.
[1:10:58] He crippled them. He took away their
[1:11:02] authority.
[1:11:04] He took away the iron grip that they
[1:11:06] held over people.
[1:11:09] He spoiled them. They thought they had
[1:11:12] the perfect
[1:11:14] trap for sons and daughters of God to
[1:11:17] forever hold them in their
[1:11:20] grip. But he brought that hand
[1:11:23] open. Now they are powerless and
[1:11:28] muscleless to keep you trapped in a
[1:11:34] trap. So he spoiled him.
[1:11:38] The next thing it says there in that
[1:11:41] verse, he
[1:11:44] made a
[1:11:46] show of them openly.
[1:11:52] You're laughing, brother M. Brother Tim.
[1:11:55] You You uh I think you know you know
[1:11:58] what that means. How many can read
[1:12:00] between the lines here? How many knows
[1:12:02] what that's talking about?
[1:12:04] Let's say somebody come in this church
[1:12:06] or somebody come into your home. You had
[1:12:09] your whole family
[1:12:11] there and uh you know let's say somehow
[1:12:16] I'm I'm trying to think of something an
[1:12:19] example of something. Somebody come in
[1:12:21] there and tried to harass or do
[1:12:25] something bad to one of your children.
[1:12:29] Well, you being the family
[1:12:33] defender, you you you do whatever it
[1:12:36] would
[1:12:38] take to expose that
[1:12:41] person who is being very
[1:12:44] deviant and
[1:12:47] deceitful in trying to harm one of your
[1:12:52] household. So, you would broadcast that.
[1:12:55] you would call the
[1:12:57] police, you know, somebody snuck in
[1:13:00] somewhere even into this
[1:13:01] church and let's say really really had a
[1:13:05] bad
[1:13:06] bad
[1:13:09] idea to do somebody harm or do something
[1:13:13] evil or do something
[1:13:16] wrong. So that person, let's say the
[1:13:20] camera caught him.
[1:13:24] In other words, Jesus made a
[1:13:27] show of these powers being defeated.
[1:13:31] Now, I'll just want to read a little bit
[1:13:33] what somebody else has said here about
[1:13:36] made a show of them openly. Jesus made a
[1:13:39] public spectacle.
[1:13:42] In other words, it wasn't a closed
[1:13:43] courtroom.
[1:13:46] All the nasty details was going to be
[1:13:48] brought out and the accused was brought
[1:13:50] in and he was proven to be guilty and
[1:13:54] his scheme has been uncovered. Doesn't
[1:13:56] that sound like something in the message
[1:13:58] we've read? His schemes
[1:14:02] that dirty devil. Yes. His schemes are
[1:14:05] uncovered
[1:14:07] now made a public spect spectacle of all
[1:14:11] the powers and principalities of
[1:14:13] darkness, stripping away from
[1:14:16] them their every weapon and all their
[1:14:20] spiritual authority and power to accuse
[1:14:22] us. And by the power of the cross, Jesus
[1:14:26] led them around as prisoners
[1:14:30] in a procession of triumph. Amen. You
[1:14:34] remember brother Madam said that when
[1:14:36] David killed Goliath, he took Goliath's
[1:14:39] own sword and he cut the Goliath's head
[1:14:43] off with his own sword.
[1:14:46] What did he do with that head? He made a
[1:14:49] show of him openly. Amen. Wave them
[1:14:53] heads. You're a so-called giant right
[1:14:57] here. He is
[1:14:59] held his head up by the hair. You see
[1:15:02] this
[1:15:03] Philistines? You're a leader. Your head
[1:15:05] is dead. This is a dead head.
[1:15:13] Now I feel like preaching.
[1:15:19] made a show of them
[1:15:23] openly. Goes on to
[1:15:27] say he led them around as prisoners. Now
[1:15:30] in verse 15 it
[1:15:32] says triumphing. He made a show openly
[1:15:37] of
[1:15:38] them triumphing over them in it. So I
[1:15:42] looked up the word triumphing. And it
[1:15:44] says a
[1:15:46] notable
[1:15:48] success, not just a success, but a
[1:15:51] notable accomplishment. Brother
[1:15:54] Carter, a notable
[1:15:57] achievement, a job that you do, brother
[1:16:00] or brother Jaz builds a three 3500
[1:16:04] square foot
[1:16:05] house and it's a success.
[1:16:09] A lot of hard work, a lot of lot of
[1:16:11] looking at the, you know, the builder
[1:16:14] blueprints and permits and everything in
[1:16:17] their cons. They want this and they want
[1:16:19] that, they want this and they want that.
[1:16:21] A notable
[1:16:24] success. And so the joy or exaltation of
[1:16:27] victory or success.
[1:16:30] Examples, a person that overcomes a
[1:16:33] serious
[1:16:34] illness. A team winning a championship
[1:16:37] after overcoming significant
[1:16:41] obstacles. Demonstrating a feeling or
[1:16:44] great
[1:16:46] satisfaction and
[1:16:48] pride resulting from a
[1:16:51] success or a victory.
[1:16:57] Now, I've read a lot of
[1:17:00] history
[1:17:02] and I've seen a lot of the old artist
[1:17:06] drawings, you know, and recently I've
[1:17:09] seen that drawing of the great Roman
[1:17:13] conquest of
[1:17:15] Gaul and it was a it was a
[1:17:19] really difficult fight.
[1:17:23] It was a difficult battle. Now, I'm not
[1:17:25] into the the blood and gore and and all
[1:17:27] of that. Those things are
[1:17:30] horrific. But after which whichever
[1:17:33] side, it don't matter because it went on
[1:17:34] both
[1:17:35] sides. Especially when the Roman army
[1:17:38] was defeated by the uh the Germans. I
[1:17:42] believe they weren't known as Germans,
[1:17:43] but the Saxons or whoever. And they they
[1:17:46] took the colors and the the uh thing the
[1:17:50] banners and the they had these metal
[1:17:52] signs or whatever their I forget what
[1:17:54] the word they call it, but they led them
[1:17:57] down those streets and they had those
[1:17:59] Roman generals and soldiers in chains
[1:18:01] and shackles. They were making a show of
[1:18:05] them
[1:18:05] openly. These are the ones that
[1:18:08] tormented us. These are the ones that
[1:18:10] came and took our children for slaves
[1:18:14] and took up money from us in
[1:18:16] taxes. And I remember seeing the
[1:18:18] pictures of the Roman emperors, the
[1:18:20] Roman generals on a return to Rome from
[1:18:23] a all over Europe. I forget now who the
[1:18:27] commander was, but he was in charge of
[1:18:30] the armies of Rome. And he was bringing
[1:18:33] back the captives and the booty that was
[1:18:36] taken from the places that he conquered.
[1:18:39] And it was a great
[1:18:41] show. And there's the
[1:18:44] enemies down in chains and
[1:18:47] shackles and shame and
[1:18:50] disgrace. They marched down and the
[1:18:52] crowds were
[1:18:53] cheering as a general.
[1:18:57] I'm reminded of a greater general than
[1:18:59] that. The Lord Jesus Christ who made a
[1:19:03] show of them openly
[1:19:06] defeating every devil of
[1:19:08] darkness and even going and suffering as
[1:19:11] a lost soul paid the price, the
[1:19:15] ransom for you and
[1:19:17] I. And what a time of rejoicing. He's
[1:19:22] alive. He's alive. All power is given to
[1:19:26] me in heaven and in
[1:19:27] earth. The great
[1:19:30] general, he made a show of them
[1:19:33] openly. And I am not even getting my
[1:19:36] subject
[1:19:38] yet. Jesus said in John
[1:19:41] 14:12, and I want you to look at the the
[1:19:44] thought direction of
[1:19:46] the pattern of thought
[1:19:49] direction. Verily, verily I say you, he
[1:19:52] that believeth on me, the works that I
[1:19:53] do shall he do also, and
[1:19:55] greater
[1:19:57] works than these shall he do. Greater
[1:20:01] works. First John 4:4, "Ye of God,
[1:20:03] little children, have overcome them
[1:20:06] because greater is he."
[1:20:10] Do you believe it or do you do you not
[1:20:12] believe it?
[1:20:14] Sometimes our actions really, we send
[1:20:17] signals to God. We send signals to
[1:20:20] others. I don't know where they're
[1:20:23] at. Do you really believe it or have you
[1:20:27] have you heard it so many times? Well, I
[1:20:29] don't think it works for me.
[1:20:33] Hallelujah. Amen. It's me, too. I think
[1:20:38] some of us we just I don't know, maybe
[1:20:40] we ate too big of a supper tonight,
[1:20:43] worked too hard during the day.
[1:20:45] Greater is he that is in you.
[1:20:50] Greater greater not just great but
[1:20:54] greater
[1:20:56] is he that's in you than he that's in
[1:21:00] this world. Glory to God. That's a
[1:21:03] pretty big God. That'd be bigger than
[1:21:06] the God of this world. You better
[1:21:08] believe it. He's big. The same same
[1:21:11] minerals, the same thing that's in that
[1:21:13] drop of pillar of fire that's in you is
[1:21:16] out there. What's in that ocean? That's
[1:21:18] in that pillar of fire right there. The
[1:21:21] same power, the same thing is in you.
[1:21:26] Think about that. Greater is the lick
[1:21:29] that's from that pit of fire that's in
[1:21:31] you than he that's in the world.
[1:21:41] My my my what happened to us
[1:21:44] Sunday? Oh my. I'm
[1:21:47] sorry. I know you love
[1:21:52] me. 1st Samuel
[1:21:55] 16 and six.
[1:21:58] But and it came to pass when they were
[1:22:01] come that he looked on Eliab, said,
[1:22:03] "Surely the Lord's anointed before him."
[1:22:06] But the Lord said unto Samuel, "Look not
[1:22:09] on his countenance or on the height of
[1:22:11] his stature, because I refuse him. For
[1:22:14] the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man
[1:22:17] lookth on the outward appearance, but
[1:22:19] the Lord lookth on the heart."
[1:22:23] Was there anything about David
[1:22:26] that would would have caused anyone, you
[1:22:30] know, it says that he he had an innocent
[1:22:32] look about himself. He was ruddy, which
[1:22:35] mean he red had red hair. He was a
[1:22:38] little
[1:22:40] fella. But God wasn't even looking at
[1:22:42] that either. Hallelujah. He wasn't
[1:22:45] looking at that. There's plenty of There
[1:22:47] was plenty of people walking around that
[1:22:49] looked like David.
[1:22:50] There was other shepherd herders out
[1:22:52] there in the land of Israel.
[1:22:55] Yeah.
[1:22:57] So God wasn't looking at looking at
[1:22:59] David's outward man say, "Well, you
[1:23:02] know, God looks on the heart. God seen
[1:23:06] his
[1:23:08] seed. He seen he's seen Moses in the
[1:23:12] block of stone.
[1:23:14] Really?" Amen. And he and he heard
[1:23:17] Moses. He heard David calling from the
[1:23:19] block of stone. The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:23:24] I shall not want. He makes me to lie
[1:23:27] down by green
[1:23:29] pastures. The Lord is my light and my
[1:23:32] rock. Of whom should I be
[1:23:36] afraid? I hear David calling from that
[1:23:39] block of stone he's locked up in. I'm
[1:23:42] going to unlock
[1:23:43] him. At least partly. They'll say partly
[1:23:46] because he hadn't received the Holy
[1:23:47] Ghost new birth. But he sure got
[1:23:51] unlocked. He sure got unlocked, didn't
[1:23:54] he? He got unlocked from that stone he
[1:23:57] was in. You say, "What are you talking
[1:23:58] about?" See, David had a potential. He
[1:24:01] was not yet
[1:24:03] king. So God had to unlock the doors.
[1:24:08] The anointing oil had to come upon David
[1:24:11] or he couldn't be king.
[1:24:14] The prophet had to go to David and
[1:24:16] anoint
[1:24:18] him. Samuel, he's just like you and I, a
[1:24:21] prophet of God, right? He thought the
[1:24:24] same way as we think when Eli live and
[1:24:28] all these fine looking young men. No
[1:24:31] doubt nothing wrong with him either.
[1:24:36] There's probably many fine young men in
[1:24:38] the land of Israel then. Good quality
[1:24:41] men. Young men. Sure.
[1:24:44] But God chose one.
[1:24:47] Sometimes his seed is hid away and
[1:24:49] locked up in a stone that my goodness,
[1:24:51] can anything good come out of Nazareth?
[1:24:54] Anything good come out of that block of
[1:24:55] stone? Boy, he's he's certainly a block
[1:24:57] of stone. All right, he's a blockhead.
[1:25:02] That's what people used to say about
[1:25:03] some of us because we were a bunch of
[1:25:05] blockheads. That's right. Come on, admit
[1:25:08] it. Amen.
[1:25:10] Don't want to admit it. You think we're
[1:25:12] a bunch of angels? We was always sweet
[1:25:14] and kind and lovely. Oh boy. You'd have
[1:25:17] knowed me. You said, "Tell that Yankee
[1:25:19] go
[1:25:20] home." Boy, I'm going to get run out of
[1:25:22] here soon
[1:25:25] enough. When we were country people,
[1:25:27] boy, we really told people what we
[1:25:31] thought. Now, you know, it's like never
[1:25:35] meet a stranger. Now, what causes that?
[1:25:38] The Christ that's on the inside. God
[1:25:40] loves people. You'll love people. Even
[1:25:43] the ones you disagree with. Yes, sir.
[1:25:46] When I say disagree with, you know, I
[1:25:48] Well, better not go that way. I've had
[1:25:50] her forgive 70 times. Seven times. 70
[1:25:53] times seven. Keep on forgiving. I told a
[1:25:56] man telling brother Josiah the other
[1:25:58] day, I won't go into names or details,
[1:26:00] but oh my, forgive, forgive, forgive,
[1:26:03] forgive, took advantage of, took
[1:26:06] advantage of. felt like many times
[1:26:08] become a you know a kick around. He can
[1:26:13] take anything. Get mad, take it out on
[1:26:15] him. Even if he's not, he ain't a fault
[1:26:17] for anything. Just take it out on him.
[1:26:19] Punching
[1:26:23] bag. You know what? I'm still serving
[1:26:26] the Lord.
[1:26:28] I'm still moving on with God. I'm going
[1:26:30] on with Jesus just the same. You may
[1:26:32] false accuse me, scandalize my name. I'm
[1:26:35] going on with Jesus just to say, "Amen."
[1:26:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] David, God l the Lord lookth on the
[1:26:44] heart. Amen. Now, this is where we're
[1:26:48] going to kind of back up a little bit
[1:26:49] with whatever time we have left. And I
[1:26:52] know our time is getting away on
[1:26:55] us, but brother Brandham said, "We know
[1:26:58] in in God's power to transform September
[1:27:01] 11th." Brother Brandham says, "But since
[1:27:04] the opening of those seven seals of them
[1:27:06] angels just behind the mountain yonder,
[1:27:09] this has become a new book. It's things
[1:27:13] that have been hid is being revealed as
[1:27:16] God promised in Revelation 10, he would
[1:27:19] do it. And we are the privileged people
[1:27:22] that God has chosen on the earth that we
[1:27:25] might see and understand these things
[1:27:27] which is not some mythical fleshly mind
[1:27:30] of a person trying to make it up. It's
[1:27:32] the word of God made manifest proven
[1:27:36] that it's right.
[1:27:38] Proven not by science but by God that
[1:27:40] it's right.
[1:27:46] Amen. It's a new book.
[1:27:49] But how many of these
[1:27:51] things, you know, we we think
[1:27:53] predestination, no eternal hell, you
[1:27:56] know, the the city that's shaped of a
[1:27:58] pyramid, a hill rising up out of the
[1:28:00] earth, the city coming down and setting
[1:28:02] on that and and we think of that and
[1:28:04] then we think of the serpent seed and
[1:28:07] godhead. But what about the mystery of
[1:28:09] your life?
[1:28:14] The opening of the seals, the opening of
[1:28:16] the word has opened up the full
[1:28:18] redemption claim for you and
[1:28:27] me. That had to be the lamb had to open
[1:28:32] the book.
[1:28:36] The title
[1:28:38] deed is no longer held by the father
[1:28:40] anymore.
[1:28:42] It was taken back. It went back to the
[1:28:44] father when Adam and Eve fell. But now
[1:28:48] the title
[1:28:49] deed is no longer in the
[1:28:52] heads. The one that siteth upon the
[1:28:56] throne. The Bible says that Revelation
[1:28:59] 10:1, a mighty angel came down and as
[1:29:02] he's descending, he he's got an open
[1:29:05] book in his head and a rainbow over his
[1:29:06] head. Who was it? Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:29:10] the
[1:29:11] lamb. Now he's coming down with a book
[1:29:14] that's no longer closed. It is open.
[1:29:18] Revelation five, the lamb has prevailed
[1:29:21] to open the seals
[1:29:26] thereof.
[1:29:30] Now he the seventh angel begins to
[1:29:33] sound. The Bible says the mystery of
[1:29:37] God. That seventh angel we know was the
[1:29:39] earthly messenger William Brandom for
[1:29:42] our
[1:29:45] age. The mystery of God should be
[1:29:49] finished. But that's not the end of it
[1:29:51] right there. Then he says, "Come take
[1:29:55] the book.
[1:29:57] Take the
[1:30:01] book." He says that to John. He's not
[1:30:03] telling the seventh angel. Seventh Angel
[1:30:06] has been preaching reading out of it.
[1:30:10] But now he says, "Take that book and eat
[1:30:13] it up."
[1:30:15] And then you must
[1:30:17] prophesy with your life.
[1:30:21] That is what you and I want. The mystery
[1:30:27] yourself revealed in the
[1:30:31] scriptures. I seen my name.
[1:30:35] Brother Ram said, "When when John must
[1:30:38] have seen his name,
[1:30:40] have you seen yours yet? Have you seen
[1:30:43] your name in this message?" Are you
[1:30:46] identified by that message? Why have we
[1:30:49] come all this way? And we're hearing
[1:30:52] what we're hearing is becoming more and
[1:30:55] more clear. As a hand, as the object
[1:30:58] approaches the wall, the hand is no
[1:31:01] longer fuzzy, but it's becoming more and
[1:31:04] more clear as that day approaches. Why?
[1:31:08] You are seeing yourself. He we are his
[1:31:12] image on
[1:31:17] earth. We're not trying to be God, but
[1:31:21] now are we the sons of God.
[1:31:26] You're not thinking like
[1:31:28] denominationals, you
[1:31:30] know, worked around a lot of people that
[1:31:33] says, "Oh, I'm a Christian. I go to
[1:31:35] church. I
[1:31:40] preach." You know, I won't say where
[1:31:42] that was,
[1:31:45] but some of them were doing the best
[1:31:47] they could. I'll give them that.
[1:31:50] This one
[1:31:52] guy, you he'd be sitting there at
[1:31:55] lunchtime and you wouldn't believe the
[1:31:57] awful stuff coming out of his mouth.
[1:31:59] Questionable. It wasn't what I would
[1:32:02] call bad
[1:32:03] bad. But says that don't sound like a
[1:32:06] Christian ought to be saying those
[1:32:08] things. You know, I've noticed you you
[1:32:11] all have met people like that in your
[1:32:12] life.
[1:32:14] All of a sudden
[1:32:15] you say you start talking about the
[1:32:20] Lord and it's
[1:32:23] like well why you looking like that for?
[1:32:27] You feel uncomfortable don't you? Why?
[1:32:30] Your life is testifying something
[1:32:31] different than what you've been
[1:32:33] professing and the presence of the Lord
[1:32:35] is not welcome in their in their
[1:32:37] presence. They say he is but not the God
[1:32:41] I God I serve.
[1:32:43] You bow your heads in prayer in the name
[1:32:45] of Jesus Christ. It's almost like people
[1:32:47] will swallow their tongue. You start
[1:32:50] talking about the Lord. I've seen it.
[1:32:51] People almost start looking for a place
[1:32:53] to hide. They're coming under conviction
[1:32:56] is what it is. That's right. Doing
[1:32:59] ungodly things and evil things. And no
[1:33:01] wonder they don't feel
[1:33:03] comfortable. Want to get away from
[1:33:05] you. Probably don't hate you. I mean, as
[1:33:08] a person, they just don't like the
[1:33:10] presence of the Lord. It exposes their
[1:33:14] evil deeds of darkness, just your
[1:33:16] presence. Now, if it ain't, then what's
[1:33:20] happened to
[1:33:21] us. People lose their respect for
[1:33:26] you. That's what the devil wants. We
[1:33:29] probably a lot of us has been there.
[1:33:30] I've been there at one point in my life.
[1:33:33] Why? I wasn't committed to God. I let
[1:33:36] people just I didn't I didn't speak up.
[1:33:39] When you begin to speak, when the word
[1:33:42] of faith begins to speak, the devil will
[1:33:45] stop in his
[1:33:46] tracks. And he might still try to push
[1:33:49] at you. But you say, "No, devil. I ain't
[1:33:52] backing up. I'm not giving you one
[1:33:56] inch." And then you show your authority.
[1:33:58] See, he'll test you out to see whether
[1:34:01] or not you really mean it. That's why I
[1:34:04] wonder sometimes in some of the
[1:34:06] situations that we get into in our lives
[1:34:08] if we don't paralyze the peril of God.
[1:34:11] You do exactly what Jesus said not to
[1:34:14] do. You want your tradition over the
[1:34:17] word of God. You make the word of God to
[1:34:20] no effect by your tradition. But guess
[1:34:23] what? That was spoke one day as truth.
[1:34:26] And now that statement is history
[1:34:29] because we find in the message of the
[1:34:32] hour that brother Adam said in the
[1:34:34] evening light when the messenger comes.
[1:34:37] I'll read it to
[1:34:40] you. I don't have it in quote form up
[1:34:44] here in the feast of the
[1:34:46] trumpets. Now notice here's a great
[1:34:49] thing. Look. Oh my. The Holy Spirit has
[1:34:53] been
[1:34:53] bound. Listen. Listen,
[1:34:56] please. The Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:34:59] by
[1:35:00] denominations all these 2,000 years.
[1:35:03] Amen.
[1:35:08] We find out it has. Now notice the
[1:35:11] Sabbaths 7. They couldn't get it all out
[1:35:14] of the way out. Bible said there would
[1:35:16] be a day that would be neither day,
[1:35:18] night, or day. And all scripture Jesus
[1:35:21] said must be fulfilled. Is that right?
[1:35:24] The prophet said, "There'll be a day
[1:35:25] that can't be called night or day or
[1:35:28] night, but in the evening time it shall
[1:35:30] be light." What was
[1:35:33] it? The same sun that shines in the
[1:35:37] east is the same sun that shines in the
[1:35:40] west.
[1:35:42] Let me see if I can
[1:35:50] find the Holy Ghost was bound by 2,000
[1:35:53] years but is loosed by the evening time
[1:35:58] message. You say
[1:36:00] why? The same thing had the Jews not
[1:36:04] bound the power of the scripture bound
[1:36:07] the Holy Ghost through their creeds. The
[1:36:11] Jesus said in Mark chapter 7 that they
[1:36:13] love their their traditions more than
[1:36:16] the commandments of God. And what did
[1:36:18] Jesus said? I can't bless over top of
[1:36:21] your sin. Simply put, that's what Jesus
[1:36:24] was telling them. What was their sin?
[1:36:27] Disbelieving the commandment of God by
[1:36:30] holding on to their tradition.
[1:36:32] You know why? Why did they do that?
[1:36:35] There's a lot of reasons. Some of it was
[1:36:37] financial gain,
[1:36:40] popularity.
[1:36:43] We really
[1:36:45] understood the conditions of that day
[1:36:47] and how those priests and scribes, they
[1:36:49] were powerful
[1:36:51] people. With the
[1:36:53] Romans, they were they were popular in
[1:36:56] business. His money dominated a whole
[1:36:58] lot of things back then. You realize
[1:37:00] that many of those priests and scribes
[1:37:03] were vast land
[1:37:05] owners that didn't even belong to
[1:37:08] them. They were
[1:37:10] wealthy. They had agricultural farming
[1:37:14] regions that they had bought and by
[1:37:17] tribal order a lot of that didn't even
[1:37:19] belong to them.
[1:37:22] You made the word of God to none effect
[1:37:26] for because of your traditions
[1:37:29] and gee boy that went over boy that that
[1:37:31] score st their hides.
[1:37:34] But what do people do today? You say
[1:37:36] well you know yeah that was them and
[1:37:39] this and
[1:37:40] that in our lives. Let's bring it down
[1:37:44] home. What is it you're holding on to?
[1:37:47] If there was a Pentecostal that loved to
[1:37:49] shout and jump and scream and holler and
[1:37:51] sing and praise God, preach under the
[1:37:52] anointing, it was me. I know brother
[1:37:55] Sean and everybody else has said it too.
[1:37:57] But I know I know all about that. I was
[1:38:00] in the Jesus name church. I was in a
[1:38:03] trinitarian church at the age of 15 or
[1:38:06] 16 years old. Found myself out in the
[1:38:08] middle of the aisle. I don't even know
[1:38:09] how I got there. Dancing and screaming
[1:38:12] and jumping and shouting and praising
[1:38:13] God.
[1:38:16] Something just come over me.
[1:38:19] It's real.
[1:38:28] Yeah, I've been
[1:38:30] there. But you know what? That is
[1:38:32] nothing compared to what we have right
[1:38:36] now. And anybody that thinks, "Oh, I
[1:38:39] felt so good. I felt so good. I'd love
[1:38:41] to go back to that." What is it? What is
[1:38:44] it? You the euphoria. You get your
[1:38:46] people worked up in the music and I know
[1:38:48] the Holy Spirit blessings come down. But
[1:38:51] what about our meetings
[1:38:52] today? What do we see in the last few
[1:38:55] meetings we've had at the church here
[1:38:57] one night? We was here and I I think
[1:38:59] some of you stayed over 20 minutes.
[1:39:01] Brother Virgil was here that time that
[1:39:02] one of that last service he was in and
[1:39:05] the spirit of the Lord was moving and
[1:39:07] moving and moving. Yes, sir. Amen. Now,
[1:39:10] back then, we didn't even know know
[1:39:13] hardly which end was up. Now, we know
[1:39:16] which end is
[1:39:18] up.
[1:39:20] Amen. I'll just go a little bit
[1:39:24] further. Bible becomes a new
[1:39:29] book.
[1:39:32] Amen. Brother Brandon said this in his
[1:39:34] message, Great Warrior, 1955, January
[1:39:38] 18th.
[1:39:40] Jesus Christ robbed Satan of everything
[1:39:41] he had. He spoiled principalities,
[1:39:43] powers, and dominions. His domain reigns
[1:39:46] over the heavens and earth. And we're
[1:39:48] the subject of his domain. Now listen to
[1:39:50] what he says here. Hallelujah. He says,
[1:39:54] "My that puts him where he
[1:40:00] belongs." Puts him where he belongs. Let
[1:40:04] brother Brown say a little bit more
[1:40:05] here. The
[1:40:09] devil up there. That big old giant. He's
[1:40:12] after
[1:40:12] me.
[1:40:15] Cancer. Where's my nerve medicine?
[1:40:18] Better call the pastor. Pray. Better
[1:40:20] call this brother. This sister.
[1:40:25] Cancer. That Christian believer
[1:40:27] shouldn't even talk like that. Conduct
[1:40:30] themselves like that. Where does brother
[1:40:32] Ram say the devil is?
[1:40:36] the devil down there.
[1:40:42] What does the scripture say? I believe
[1:40:43] it was in Isaiah or one of the Old
[1:40:45] Testament prophets. And they shall look
[1:40:47] on you as an abominable branch. You're
[1:40:50] cast out of your grave. I won't even
[1:40:52] allow you to be buried with the slain.
[1:40:55] You'll be an abominable branch
[1:40:58] and they shall look upon you
[1:41:01] the devil down there.
[1:41:05] When will we get
[1:41:07] it in our
[1:41:09] hearts? I believe it probably already
[1:41:12] for there for most of us. But when are
[1:41:14] we going to get this thing up here lined
[1:41:16] up with what's in our
[1:41:18] heart? The devil up there. Big bad
[1:41:21] boogeyman is going to get
[1:41:23] me. We may not say that. I know that's
[1:41:26] being juvenile.
[1:41:28] Many times our actions and our words
[1:41:30] make the devil look so big and so
[1:41:35] tall. Would you please pick up the sword
[1:41:38] or the word of God with such a sharp pin
[1:41:42] and bust his bubble, please?
[1:41:46] Would you please bust his balloon in
[1:41:48] that bag of hot air? Amen. Deflate him
[1:41:52] like where he belongs. Cuz that's all he
[1:41:54] is hot air.
[1:41:59] How do you do it? Pick up the sword
[1:42:01] which is sharper than any two-edged
[1:42:03] sword. The word of
[1:42:05] God. Brother Ram said he he come flying
[1:42:08] in furiously on you but he went out of
[1:42:10] there faster and when he come in he got
[1:42:14] his feathers singed
[1:42:17] because he ran into 40,000 volt 60 amp
[1:42:20] service.
[1:42:22] You better believe the
[1:42:24] fireflies, a Holy Ghost fil believer.
[1:42:27] You say, "Well, what about these people
[1:42:29] out here passing away of cancer?" I can
[1:42:31] tell you one thing, Brother Virgil stood
[1:42:33] true to God. the last time that we was
[1:42:36] able to communicate with him, even the
[1:42:38] very last time when we were up there and
[1:42:41] it was just he was only a day or two or
[1:42:43] several days
[1:42:45] away. He tried to speak when I spoke to
[1:42:48] him and he went in into that bedroom and
[1:42:50] he he his hand went up. He was trying to
[1:42:54] communicate. He heard us and then he
[1:42:57] kind of went into a slumber. That devil
[1:43:00] didn't win that battle. That devil's
[1:43:02] already lost the battle.
[1:43:04] God allowed him to afflict that body and
[1:43:07] what did he get? A soul that went off
[1:43:09] into the bosom of Jesus. Amen.
[1:43:17] Amen. The devil down there in Christ the
[1:43:20] victor. He said, "You're David's. You're
[1:43:22] called, elected, known, and
[1:43:24] positionally, and put in the body of
[1:43:25] Christ by the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:27] Ghost."
[1:43:28] I I I I'm not going to be able to get
[1:43:31] back into the meat of things cuz my time
[1:43:34] is running
[1:43:35] out. But let's
[1:43:38] just start or end this where we were
[1:43:42] trying to get to
[1:43:45] start. It's just so
[1:43:48] hard. Brother Josiah got to discipline
[1:43:52] myself. So many good things pop up along
[1:43:55] the way.
[1:43:57] He says in the Pergamian church age, the
[1:43:59] reason that this part of the eulogy of
[1:44:01] the spirit is because these brave
[1:44:03] soldiers of the cross were overcoming
[1:44:06] Satan out at the North Pole or the South
[1:44:09] Pole or uh some island out there. What
[1:44:12] do they call it? Diego Garcia out there
[1:44:14] in the Indian Ocean, you know that
[1:44:16] secret military base US Army in Britain
[1:44:19] have control of, you know. No, no. He
[1:44:22] says they were overcoming Satan right in
[1:44:25] the midst of his own throne room.
[1:44:29] In his own throne room,
[1:44:33] not in the fringes, not in the suburbs,
[1:44:36] right in Satan's own throne room.
[1:44:39] They were winning the battle through the
[1:44:41] name and faith of Jesus. Right in the
[1:44:43] camp of the leaders of darkness.
[1:44:47] Right in the camp of the leaders of
[1:44:50] darkness. What a tremendous
[1:44:52] commenation like the mighty man of David
[1:44:54] who invaded the camp of the enemy to
[1:44:56] bring David thirst quenching water. So
[1:44:59] these
[1:45:01] giants of
[1:45:02] faith invaded the realm of Satan's
[1:45:05] earthly stronghold and by preaching and
[1:45:08] exhorting brought the water of salvation
[1:45:10] to those who lived under the shadow of
[1:45:17] death. Let me tell you something.
[1:45:20] I want my pattern of thought, direction
[1:45:22] to be on this beast in this word. I'm
[1:45:25] not going to be dictated to me by
[1:45:27] tradition. I'm not going to be dictated
[1:45:29] by a family member. I'm not going to be
[1:45:31] dictated by the statements and negative
[1:45:34] statements around me. And whether they
[1:45:35] come from family members in another
[1:45:38] state or or come from this one or come
[1:45:40] from that one, I'm not going to be
[1:45:41] dictated. My life is not going to repeat
[1:45:44] the past.
[1:45:49] My life is his life. His life is my
[1:45:51] life. I've become invisible. I want to
[1:45:54] become so invisible that Jesus Christ
[1:45:57] can only be seen in me. And when
[1:46:00] somebody meets me for the first time may
[1:46:02] never see me again. They'll know that
[1:46:05] they have met someone
[1:46:09] else. I think of let's stand the story
[1:46:13] of Lady Mcabe.
[1:46:20] She was really an ungodly, wicked
[1:46:23] woman. Brother Bram
[1:46:26] said, he was telling those people over
[1:46:28] there in India, all these different
[1:46:31] religions, what could you do for that
[1:46:34] lady? A lady like
[1:46:37] that. Let me tell you something. In the
[1:46:39] power of Jesus Christ, the power not
[1:46:43] just in symbol of the blood of the
[1:46:45] believing on the blood but be coming
[1:46:47] under the
[1:46:48] blood can change a life to where Lady
[1:46:52] Mcabe would be
[1:46:58] unrecognizable as Lady
[1:47:01] Mcabe. He looks so
[1:47:04] godly. I believe that the presence of
[1:47:07] God can come into a person's
[1:47:09] life. It will change you. You may feel
[1:47:12] like I feel like I got scars. I feel
[1:47:14] like I got I got this. I got bad
[1:47:17] memories. I I did some really really
[1:47:19] rotten dirty things in my past. But when
[1:47:23] that blood really comes home and washes
[1:47:26] you and cleanses you, people can never
[1:47:30] imagine you being in such a condition.
[1:47:37] That's the power of the
[1:47:40] Christ
[1:47:43] transformation. God's power to
[1:47:46] transform. That's what this message is
[1:47:49] all about. To take us from fallen. We
[1:47:53] should have come by spoken word. We're
[1:47:56] trapped into sin. We had smut and sin in
[1:47:58] our heart. Yes, we had a seed, but it
[1:48:01] was contaminated. Lived in a
[1:48:03] contaminated
[1:48:05] world. God has the ability to take us
[1:48:09] back. He don't start on the outside. He
[1:48:13] starts by giving us a new birth in our
[1:48:16] soul. And then the
[1:48:18] body comes
[1:48:21] last. Oh
[1:48:24] my, it's beautiful. I can't lay it out
[1:48:26] like some of these minister brothers
[1:48:28] can. that God in the
[1:48:31] reconciliation the reconciliation
[1:48:35] project and I like what brother Brandham
[1:48:37] said about it. I wish I had the
[1:48:41] quote, but brother Brandham
[1:48:44] said the latter
[1:48:46] state of the prodigal
[1:48:49] son was actually
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] greater than the first
[1:48:57] time before he went out into
[1:48:59] sin. When he come
[1:49:02] back, that was even greater.
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] The
[1:49:10] restoration was was so
[1:49:14] great. You restore a car, you restore a
[1:49:18] motorcycle down to the fine
[1:49:21] detail, but they find out the
[1:49:24] manufacturer they did something wrong in
[1:49:25] the engine of the
[1:49:28] transmission and it was flawed.
[1:49:33] Now, there's two types of
[1:49:35] restoration. Restoration absolutely down
[1:49:38] to the detail, including the
[1:49:40] flaw. Or
[1:49:43] restoration, take it to where it can't
[1:49:46] break
[1:49:48] anymore. Oh
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:52] my, you would not be able to
[1:49:55] [Music]
[1:49:58] fall. The flaws taken away.
[1:50:05] It's taken
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:09] away. This second knee, she'll not
[1:50:13] fall. She's been
[1:50:16] washed. And
[1:50:18] God doesn't even
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:23] remember. How far back? How how deep do
[1:50:26] you want to take that thought?
[1:50:28] How far
[1:50:30] back when he pushed
[1:50:33] delete on your old life, how deep does
[1:50:37] that really
[1:50:40] go? I got enough for revelation tonight.
[1:50:43] If th this message is
[1:50:46] true, God does not even remember Adam
[1:50:50] and
[1:50:51] Eve falling.
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:57] None of that in the past. These all died
[1:51:00] in the
[1:51:01] faith. Not even remember that Rahab was
[1:51:04] a harlot. He has it in
[1:51:06] writing. That's
[1:51:08] all. It's not even in God's mind
[1:51:11] anymore. Not in not in the mind of every
[1:51:17] believer. The mistakes they
[1:51:19] [Music]
[1:51:21] made, he don't remember it. and he don't
[1:51:25] remember your
[1:51:30] past. I've known I've known godly men
[1:51:33] and godly
[1:51:34] sisters, godly brothers and godly
[1:51:37] sisters. If you'd hear their
[1:51:41] testimony, they're
[1:51:43] like like a lot of the rest of us. They
[1:51:46] were bad boys and they were bad girls.
[1:51:52] You know what? They're
[1:51:55] transformed. They're bloodwashed. You're
[1:51:58] sanctified. They're bloodwashed. They're
[1:52:01] clean. Call not what God has cleansed.
[1:52:04] Why do you accuse
[1:52:05] yourself? What did What did he say to
[1:52:08] him in the
[1:52:09] vision? What God has cleansed, call not
[1:52:12] unclean. I say to you, you may look at
[1:52:15] yourself as being a snake. You may look
[1:52:17] at yourself as being a lizard. You may
[1:52:19] look at yourself as being this or
[1:52:22] that, but if the blood is there, the
[1:52:25] snake's gone. That snake nature's gone.
[1:52:28] The scorpion nature's
[1:52:32] gone. The bad boy, the bad girl, it's
[1:52:37] gone. Take it
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:42] away. Amen. Amen. What are y'all
[1:52:45] playing? Brother Daniel, come on. I want
[1:52:48] to
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:51] live. God help
[1:52:53] me and thank God for being able to work
[1:52:56] for a Christian brother in our
[1:52:59] church. Had to work years in public. God
[1:53:03] really worked on me and I'm thankful,
[1:53:06] privileged to be able to work for a
[1:53:08] brother in our church. Different
[1:53:11] atmosphere. Very thankful.
[1:53:14] [Music]
[1:53:15] A lot of things I could be doing and may
[1:53:19] do, but I'll tell you one thing. There's
[1:53:21] nothing better than to be working for a
[1:53:23] believer. My hats off to you, brother
[1:53:25] Josiah. And I'm not trying to I know you
[1:53:27] didn't ask for that. Not looking for
[1:53:29] that. He's a man of character. I'll tell
[1:53:32] you that. Don't have to work with a man
[1:53:34] very long. You know, somebody's a man of
[1:53:37] woman or man of character.
[1:53:40] Amen. Go ahead, brother Daniel. No more
[1:53:43] to
[1:53:44] give. I want to

[1:54:16] live. I want to
[1:54:19] give until there's just no more to
[1:54:26] give. I want to
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:31] laugh till there's just no
[1:54:38] I could
[1:54:40] never
[1:54:46] ever Oh, I want to
[1:54:50] live the way.
[1:54:54] He wants
[1:54:56] me to feel love. I want to
[1:55:01] give until there's just no more to
[1:55:08] give. I want to
[1:55:12] love love till there's just
[1:55:17] no love.
[1:55:19] for I could
[1:55:22] never ever
[1:55:24] ask the
[1:55:28] Lord. Oh, I want to
[1:55:32] live the
[1:55:35] way he wants me to live.
[1:55:40] I want to
[1:55:42] give until there's just no more to
[1:55:49] give. I want to
[1:55:53] love love till there's just no more love
[1:56:01] for I could
[1:56:03] never ever out love the Lord. Can we
[1:56:08] sing it one more
[1:56:09] time? Oh, I want to
[1:56:13] live the ways that your desire tonight
[1:56:17] wants me to
[1:56:20] live. I want to

[1:56:32] I want to
[1:56:34] love love till there's just no more
[1:56:41] love. I could
[1:56:44] never ever out
[1:56:47] love the
[1:56:51] Lord. Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[1:56:55] [Music]
[1:56:57] Amen. We uh want to keep brother Amos in
[1:57:00] our prayers. Amen. that the Lord would
[1:57:02] just continue to bless him. Amen. And
[1:57:04] Sister Lisa, the Lord would just be with
[1:57:07] him. Amen. Maybe we could sing that
[1:57:10] song. Greater is he that is in me.
[1:57:12] Before we go, oh, greater is he that is
[1:57:16] in me. Oh, greater is he that is in
[1:57:22] me. Oh, greater is he that is in me than
[1:57:28] he that is in the world. Oh yes, now
[1:57:32] greater is he that is in me. Oh, greater
[1:57:37] is he that is in
[1:57:40] me. Oh, greater is he that is in me than
[1:57:45] he that is in the
[1:57:48] world. Oh, Satan's like a roaring lion.
[1:57:53] He's roaming to and fro.
[1:57:58] He's seeking whom he may devour. Oh, the
[1:58:03] Bible tells us
[1:58:05] so. Now many souls have been his prey to
[1:58:11] fall in some
[1:58:14] we. But God has promised us today. His

[1:58:25] that is in
[1:58:27] me. Oh, greater is he that is in me. Oh,

[1:58:37] is in the
[1:58:40] world. Now on that day of
[1:58:44] Pentecost for a rushing mighty
[1:58:48] wind, oh blew into the upper room and

[2:00:53] an honor and a privilege, Lord, to have
