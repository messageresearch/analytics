[51:24] right along with my sermon I bring
[51:26] greetings to you from Brother Brad
[51:28] Burgess the church back home and uh we
[51:30] were in Louisville and then we Lord
[51:32] blessed us we moved to Indiana here
[51:34] about a year ago so we're so glad to be
[51:37] out of the big city there was a lot of
[51:38] crime and when uh how was it when uh
[51:41] covid came that antifa people came and
[51:44] there was there was a problem in the
[51:47] with some racial things and they said
[51:48] we're going to give you 30 days and
[51:50] we're going to burn the city down and so
[51:52] our church was there they came within
[51:54] just a few blocks of the church and but
[51:56] the Lord allows us to go to Indiana so
[51:58] we're thankful for our new church we
[52:00] have to get brother Shawn over there to
[52:01] minister for us but it's um just good to
[52:05] be with you all today good to see sister
[52:07] Heather and amen it just seems like
[52:09] yesterday sister Mindy we were out in
[52:11] Arizona and we're just kids running
[52:13] around and now see them pillars in the
[52:15] church I think brother R brother Sean
[52:17] said it's been 13 years I think you've
[52:18] been married and here 12 years so my
[52:21] time goes by fast doesn't it now go
[52:24] ahead and add 12 years on to your life
[52:25] right now oh my that'll make people
[52:29] smile won't
[52:30] it but it's good to see uh brother sea
[52:33] going on with the Lord he's always had a
[52:35] big impact in our lives it's you think
[52:38] back uh I'm Just a Nobody trying to tell
[52:41] everybody about somebody came out our
[52:43] church and sang that my it's just the
[52:45] little things how God has woven our
[52:47] lives together you know and he weaves
[52:49] them and we can't you know tear them
[52:52] apart because God's woven our hearts
[52:54] together and so many I remember a few
[52:55] years ago at Easter time he preached at
[52:58] our church at Easter and talked about
[52:59] the prodal son wanting to change from a
[53:02] son to be a servant and it's just
[53:04] amazing how God takes stories and
[53:07] whoever tells you that story they're
[53:08] forever connected to that so brother
[53:10] Sean's connected in my life in so many
[53:13] ways and we certain certainly appreciate
[53:15] my brother and the the Martin family
[53:17] have have meant a lot to us and their
[53:19] fathers really uh has a close place in
[53:22] our heart amen good to see brother
[53:24] Josiah where's he at he just brought me
[53:26] this water right it's good to see him
[53:28] growing up taking apart that's what
[53:30] adoption is Right finding your place and
[53:32] placing of sons brother random forgive
[53:35] me I was went to the brandom Tabernacle
[53:37] brother ROM's church for the time I was
[53:39] two till I was 19 years old so I kind of
[53:42] know those people in there that's what
[53:43] makes the message so precious but
[53:46] brother random in 1959 preached the Holy
[53:48] Ghost series that was in December of
[53:51] 1959 and then in in uh believe it was
[53:54] April of 1960 he preaches a adoption and
[53:57] preaches placing of sons so there was
[53:59] several there that receive the Holy
[54:01] Spirit and then he shows you receive the
[54:03] Holy Spirit and then God places you into
[54:05] the body of Christ then you become a
[54:07] pillar the Bible says he that overcometh
[54:09] will I make a pillar in the Church of
[54:11] God so I want to be a pillar in God's
[54:13] house amen keep pillars that's what the
[54:15] church is standing on it's good to see
[54:17] these young Brothers amen being deacons
[54:20] I was a deacon for 13 years we were
[54:22] talking the other day it's really simple
[54:23] as a deacon you keep the good people in
[54:26] and you keep the bad people
[54:28] out that comes from being in the bad
[54:30] area but I saw brother Josiah directing
[54:32] the people in and watching the amen
[54:34] that's what the deacons are they
[54:35] policemen that protect the people
[54:38] thankful for good deacons that and we
[54:40] had the place we told them we said we
[54:41] got to have discernment people don't
[54:42] talk about the gifts in the body I said
[54:44] man we live in an area bad guy comes in
[54:47] we got to have discernment every service
[54:49] like no you're not going in there with
[54:50] that backpack I discern something's not
[54:53] right in that backpack and so I believe
[54:55] we got to have the gifts of the holy
[54:57] spirit I believe as we go on in time
[54:59] we're going to need the Holy Spirit I
[55:01] believe even this morning I didn't know
[55:03] I would be here I they were having a
[55:05] men's meeting and some of the brothers
[55:07] were down there they had Friday Saturday
[55:08] and
[55:10] Sunday and I come down took off the time
[55:13] a Sunday school teacher William my son's
[55:14] teaching Sunday school so I said I'm
[55:16] just going to go down and draw closer to
[55:18] the lord well yesterday brother Sean
[55:19] just kept coming on my heart coming on
[55:21] my heart I said well I'll just go into
[55:23] service and be blessed he can preach and
[55:25] help me and notify me and we just text
[55:28] this morning and here I am so I don't
[55:31] have a lot
[55:33] of you know I don't know I've got some
[55:36] notes the Lord put on my heart here and
[55:37] so maybe it'll maybe it's for a reason I
[55:40] believe God has everything working in
[55:42] control and maybe the Holy Spirit would
[55:44] speak to you today something in your
[55:46] heart and I'm just going to yield to the
[55:47] Holy Spirit and you yield to the Holy
[55:49] Spirit and then we'll let God speak to
[55:51] us man the bride makes herself ready but
[55:54] we don't know how to get ready but he
[55:55] knows how to make us ready so if we just
[55:57] surrender to him and say Lord I don't
[55:59] know when you're coming but you're
[56:00] coming and so if it's tomorrow morning
[56:01] Lord speak to me today amen that little
[56:04] song because I want to speak about um
[56:07] God's strength showing in our weakness
[56:09] and that first verse there I don't know
[56:11] if you can pull that verse of You Are My
[56:13] Strength when I am weak amen Paul said
[56:17] when I'm weak then I'm strong so let's
[56:19] sing This Together You Are My Strength
[56:22] when I am weak you are the TR measure
[56:27] that I See You Are My All In
[56:34] [Applause]

[56:46] now you are my all oh let's just lift
[56:50] our hands to the Lord Jesus this
[56:53] morning oh Jes
[56:58] Jesus the Lamb of
[57:03] God
[57:05] Worthy
[57:07] is your
[57:12] name
[57:16] Jesus Lamb of

[57:31] Father we just bow our heads to you Lord
[57:34] just asking that you would strengthen us
[57:36] today
[57:37] Lord pray Lord as we read your word that
[57:39] you would help us Lord we know this
[57:42] Bible is God in letter form and I pray
[57:45] as we would read it today Lord that you
[57:46] would speak to each one of our hearts
[57:49] Lord every brother every sister every
[57:52] mother every father every grandmother
[57:55] every grandfather Lord every young
[57:57] person Lord I pray that you would help
[57:59] us today Father we have one goal and
[58:01] that's to make Heaven our home pray that
[58:03] you would strengthen us today Lord bless
[58:05] these words and these thoughts and may
[58:07] they strengthen us bless brother Shawn
[58:09] Lord and sister Heather I pray bless
[58:11] this church Lord and the elders and the
[58:13] deacons may you strengthen us today we
[58:15] pray in Jesus name and the church said
[58:19] amen God bless you if you have your
[58:21] Bibles thank you musicians appreciate
[58:23] you all appreciate so much talent you
[58:25] know you never appreciate Talent till
[58:27] you don't have it and I don't have it so
[58:30] I appreciate you all what do they say no
[58:32] one someone that has a talent how how do
[58:35] they say everyone re recognizes
[58:37] someone's Talent except for the person
[58:39] that has it so if you ask brother uh
[58:42] Sean said that he's a drummer he likes
[58:45] to drum so he doesn't recognize that
[58:46] he's has a talent to play until he sees
[58:48] me go over there and sit down and get
[58:51] off Rhythm then you're like wow I do
[58:52] have a
[58:53] talent probably say the same thing about
[58:56] preaching you know he's like that guy
[58:57] doesn't have a talent brother Sean has a
[59:00] talent but we want to use our talents
[59:01] for the Lord Matthew 25 it was was one
[59:05] was given five one two and one one and
[59:08] it's interesting the one that come and
[59:10] said why didn't you do anything with
[59:11] your talent it's amazing the Bible says
[59:13] the person said I was afraid and it came
[59:16] from a fear a complex I was afraid we
[59:18] need to step past our fear and say Lord
[59:20] I am going to use my talent for you it
[59:23] didn't end that well for that person if
[59:25] you go on down that they went into
[59:27] weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth
[59:29] so we don't want to be that way we say
[59:30] Lord if all I can do is write I'm going
[59:32] to write somebody a card I'm going to S
[59:35] send a I got a phone I can send an
[59:37] encouraging text or let's do something
[59:39] for the Lord we only got a little bit of
[59:41] time left amen for 2 Corinthians chapter
[59:45] 12 I'm just going to read a couple
[59:47] verses and then we'll come back and go
[59:49] through this text if it's okay I got I
[59:52] you know I'm kind of an unorthodox
[59:55] person I picked up a plaque off brother
[59:57] Sean's wall there that was so good I'm
[59:59] going to read some of that got a church
[1:00:01] age book you're going might get a poper
[1:00:03] or good country cooking is that all
[1:00:04] right good country preaching is that all
[1:00:06] right amen 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:00:09] let's just read two verses and then
[1:00:11] we'll come back to this verse number
[1:00:13] nine he said unto me my grace is
[1:00:16] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:00:20] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[1:00:22] therefore would I rather glory in my
[1:00:24] infirmities that the power of God rest
[1:00:26] upon me therefore I take pleasure in in
[1:00:29] infirmities and reproaches and
[1:00:31] necessities and persecutions and
[1:00:33] distresses for Christ's sake for when I
[1:00:36] am weak then am I strong for when I am
[1:00:40] weak then am I strong and I want to
[1:00:42] speak a little thought this morning
[1:00:44] God's strength showing because of our
[1:00:47] weakness God's strength showing because
[1:00:50] of our weakness may God add his Blessing
[1:00:52] to the word you may be seated if you can
[1:00:54] pull that down in that mind monitor just
[1:00:56] a little bit brother Judah um I want to
[1:01:00] go back to verse number one here and
[1:01:03] just talk about this because this
[1:01:05] chapter is very interesting as I was
[1:01:06] studying through it and just listening
[1:01:09] it this morning on the um the the Bible
[1:01:11] app but I was driving and Paul comes to
[1:01:14] here and he's talking he said it is not
[1:01:16] expedient for me doubtless to Glory I I
[1:01:19] will come to visions and Revelations of
[1:01:21] the Lord so he begins to talk it's very
[1:01:23] interesting he begins to compare himself
[1:01:26] with other people does anybody ever do
[1:01:28] that I guess we all do right singers do
[1:01:31] that musicians do that preachers do that
[1:01:34] and and um you know that's what they
[1:01:36] were talking the other day about uh
[1:01:38] social media how people they get on it
[1:01:40] and as soon as somebody would go on
[1:01:43] maybe a young girl go on and see
[1:01:44] somebody in social media and before you
[1:01:47] know in their mind they immediately say
[1:01:49] well I'm not that beautiful I'm not that
[1:01:52] talented before they go back and realize
[1:01:54] the statistics how many people are
[1:01:57] photoshopped and how many uh you know
[1:02:00] how how that those things are not real
[1:02:02] most of it is not real it's fake it's a
[1:02:05] and so there's another sermon I preach
[1:02:07] on images breaking down images and great
[1:02:09] godly men came and began to break down
[1:02:12] images and the devil has made these
[1:02:13] images of what a woman ought to be or
[1:02:15] what a man ought to be and people fall
[1:02:18] down and they start worshiping those
[1:02:20] images so much so that because when they
[1:02:23] can't attain to that image they maybe go
[1:02:26] and they they create Eating Disorders or
[1:02:28] maybe even commit suicide because the
[1:02:30] devil are you listening to me the devil
[1:02:33] created an image and people are
[1:02:34] worshiping that image but I think it's
[1:02:37] the second commandment Thou shalt not
[1:02:39] make unto thee any Graven image so
[1:02:41] people are making these images and
[1:02:43] they're engraving them in their mind and
[1:02:45] then they're serving that image and the
[1:02:47] image may not even be real it may be
[1:02:50] created by the devil where they're
[1:02:52] taking and photoshopping these things
[1:02:54] and changing it and people are trying to
[1:02:56] serve this image and God has told us
[1:02:58] look don't create that image and don't
[1:02:59] become a slave to that image just be in
[1:03:02] the image of christen the Bible says he
[1:03:04] is the IM image of the invisible God so
[1:03:07] we've got an image here Jesus Christ
[1:03:10] amen he was a perfect man and that's who
[1:03:11] we're striving to be like you say well
[1:03:13] why do you have that other picture up
[1:03:15] there well this St John's chapter 1:1
[1:03:18] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:03:20] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:03:22] God the logos of God and then verse 14
[1:03:24] said the word became flesh in Jesus
[1:03:26] Christ Jesus said I come from go is it
[1:03:28] right a little preach a little Doctrine
[1:03:30] he said I come from God I go back to God
[1:03:33] and in the book of Acts Paul wrote down
[1:03:36] on the road to Damascus he said who are
[1:03:39] you Lord he said I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:03:40] persecutest so the same light that we
[1:03:42] see in this picture was Jesus ascending
[1:03:45] back to that light and so then we find
[1:03:47] that well why do you have the man in
[1:03:49] there well he identified with a Ministry
[1:03:51] in our day so I wouldn't know who to
[1:03:53] follow brother Sean I didn't know who to
[1:03:55] follow and for the first time God came
[1:03:57] down and allowed science to prove that a
[1:04:00] Ministry was right for many many years
[1:04:02] the prophet of God said the angel of the
[1:04:04] Lord is here people would come in the
[1:04:05] prayer line he say do you feel them but
[1:04:07] all of a sudden God said I'm going to
[1:04:08] allow science to prove that this
[1:04:11] ministry is the correct one so that we
[1:04:13] know what to follow in this day and I'm
[1:04:15] so glad to be identified with that
[1:04:17] Ministry so here's a man Paul he's
[1:04:19] beginning to compare himself with other
[1:04:21] Ministries verse number two I knew a man
[1:04:23] in Christ above 14 years ago whether in
[1:04:25] the body I cannot tell or whether
[1:04:27] they're out of the body I cannot tell
[1:04:29] God knowth so now he's comparing himself
[1:04:31] with other someone else who has a
[1:04:32] Ministry or someone else that has a
[1:04:34] talent someone else who makes cookies
[1:04:36] and has a recipe and and we're sharing
[1:04:39] we're constant but the Bible says they
[1:04:41] that compare themselves among themselves
[1:04:43] they're not wise they're not wise so it
[1:04:46] it does US good to be who God made us
[1:04:49] not try to be somebody else people
[1:04:50] exhaust themselves trying to be some
[1:04:52] like somebody else rather than just say
[1:04:54] hey this is how God made me he made me
[1:04:56] in the image of God and this is who I am
[1:05:00] so he goes on to say
[1:05:02] here um he he says such a one caught up
[1:05:07] in the third heaven verse number three
[1:05:09] and I knew such a man whether in the
[1:05:11] body or out of the body I cannot tell
[1:05:13] God knoweth so there was questions that
[1:05:15] Paul had listen to me about Ministries
[1:05:18] that he could not explain is that okay
[1:05:19] from the Bible there was things about
[1:05:21] Jesus ministry I cannot explain I maybe
[1:05:24] said it before remember he healed the
[1:05:26] blind man he said now don't tell anybody
[1:05:28] now that doesn't make sense to me I
[1:05:29] would think you're the Savior you want
[1:05:31] you do a miracle and let everybody in
[1:05:33] the in the in the come and see the mirac
[1:05:35] going be drawn to Christ right that's
[1:05:37] our natural thinking when I get to
[1:05:38] heaven I'll ask Jesus why he did that
[1:05:40] and William brandom had some things in
[1:05:42] his ministry that I don't understand
[1:05:44] just like Paul had people around him and
[1:05:45] he didn't understand their Ministry and
[1:05:47] when I get to heaven I'll ask brother
[1:05:49] brandom say why did you say that I don't
[1:05:51] understand that but I tell you the part
[1:05:53] of Jesus ministry that I do understand
[1:05:55] is so wonderful it saved me from sin the
[1:05:58] part of William brandom's Ministry that
[1:05:59] I understand is so amazing it's more
[1:06:01] amazing than any other Ministry that
[1:06:03] I've seen on the face of the Earth so I
[1:06:06] I'm thankful for it Moses I don't
[1:06:08] understand you know how God could choose
[1:06:10] him in the same chapter he hadn't done
[1:06:12] the first thing to circumcise his his
[1:06:15] son to identify him as a a Jew do you
[1:06:17] know the do you know the Bible and his
[1:06:19] wife has to go C circumcise his own son
[1:06:22] and so when I get to heaven like Moses
[1:06:24] why didn't you do this a very why why is
[1:06:26] your you know and so there's things as
[1:06:28] Paul had questions about we have
[1:06:30] questions but that's okay just put them
[1:06:32] up on the Shelf sometimes I think Paul
[1:06:34] was it in Peter he said they wrestle to
[1:06:36] their own destruction Paul didn't
[1:06:38] wrestle he said I don't know I say
[1:06:40] there's no shame in saying I don't
[1:06:42] know I don't know sometimes mom's like
[1:06:45] your little kid's like why does daddy do
[1:06:46] this I don't know why he does it but
[1:06:48] he's still your daddy and he's the best
[1:06:50] daddy you ever
[1:06:51] had amen so verse number four how that
[1:06:54] he was caught up in into paradise and
[1:06:56] heard unspeakable Words which are not
[1:06:58] lawful for a man to utter of such a one
[1:07:00] would I Glory yet of myself I would not
[1:07:03] Glory but in my infirmities now I want
[1:07:06] you to see this because Paul has a a
[1:07:08] gift he has a Ministry each one of us
[1:07:10] have a gift that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] came for he said you'll be my Witnesses
[1:07:14] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:07:15] you you'll have a Ministry that's what
[1:07:17] we're on Earth for this if you listen to
[1:07:19] me today he'll save you from suicide you
[1:07:21] know because that you have a purpose in
[1:07:23] life a lot of people have no purpose no
[1:07:25] reason to live and they pull the sheet
[1:07:27] up over their head and and they have no
[1:07:29] purpose but we as Christians Jesus said
[1:07:31] I'm going to fill you with power and
[1:07:33] you'll be my Witnesses so we have a
[1:07:35] purpose to be a witness for Jesus Christ
[1:07:38] verse number six for though I would
[1:07:40] desire to Glory I shall not be a fool
[1:07:42] for I would say the truth but now I
[1:07:45] forbear lest any man should think of me
[1:07:47] above that which he seeth me to be or
[1:07:51] that he heareth of me so he he didn't
[1:07:53] want to be exalted he didn't want people
[1:07:54] to exalt him and lest I should be
[1:07:57] exalted above measure through the
[1:07:58] abundance of the revelations there was
[1:08:01] given unto him a thorn in the flesh the
[1:08:03] messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I
[1:08:06] should be exalted above measure so Paul
[1:08:08] is saying he's got these great
[1:08:10] Revelations he's got this um great uh
[1:08:13] ministry as we know in the book of Acts
[1:08:15] how he was smitten Down By The Light and
[1:08:17] God spoke and said you will be a light
[1:08:19] to the Gentiles so now God Mo uh Paul
[1:08:21] has a Heavenly visitation that
[1:08:24] vindicates his ministry but God gave him
[1:08:26] a thorn in the flesh to keep him humble
[1:08:30] now we're going somewhere with this here
[1:08:31] so Paul's saying I I've got a thorn in
[1:08:33] my flesh brother random comes along and
[1:08:35] I think it's known by history that Paul
[1:08:36] had a problem with his eyesight and
[1:08:38] somehow he couldn't read and so later
[1:08:41] you know he was praying like Lord if you
[1:08:42] would take away my infirmity I could
[1:08:44] write uh better letters so he's in a
[1:08:47] dungeon maybe he didn't have a lot of
[1:08:49] pulpits and microphones and uh mp3s and
[1:08:52] and and ways to stream his ministry he
[1:08:54] was just writing letters but we equate
[1:08:56] it to preaching are you with me today so
[1:08:59] Paul says I I have I can be exalted in
[1:09:01] Revelation I got a Vindication of by an
[1:09:03] Angelic visit um but I've got this
[1:09:05] infirmity in my flesh but listen to me
[1:09:08] his infirmity drove him closer to God
[1:09:12] now all of us have talents we have
[1:09:13] ability here's a young man sitting here
[1:09:15] in his strength the Bible says the glory
[1:09:17] of a young man is his strength so that a
[1:09:19] young man has his strength you may have
[1:09:21] a talent maybe you're beautiful maybe
[1:09:23] you have financial means or maybe you
[1:09:24] have a a memory that's just amazing and
[1:09:27] you could just go do great things in the
[1:09:29] world and and but God gives every one of
[1:09:32] his children a little bit of an
[1:09:33] infirmity can you say Amen to that that
[1:09:36] keeps them close to Jesus Christ now
[1:09:39] Paul is saying Lord if you'll re remove
[1:09:41] this infirmity if you'll fix my eyesight
[1:09:44] I can write better letters I can be a
[1:09:46] better Minister as we find here but the
[1:09:48] Bible says that it was it was something
[1:09:50] that that the um a messenger from Satan
[1:09:53] lest I should be exalted above measure
[1:09:55] this infirmity was given to him to keep
[1:09:57] him
[1:09:59] humble and this wasn't just something
[1:10:02] that went through his mind once in his
[1:10:04] life but the Bible says in the next
[1:10:05] verse for this thing besought I the Lord
[1:10:08] Thrice that it might depart from me so
[1:10:10] Paul is saying that he wanted this to
[1:10:13] depart from me and it was something that
[1:10:14] he dealt with continually in his life
[1:10:17] right and sometimes we pray Lord if
[1:10:19] you'll take this away maybe you'll take
[1:10:21] this little complex away or you'll take
[1:10:23] this away I could be a better but God
[1:10:25] says look my grace is sufficient for you
[1:10:29] my strength is made perfect in your
[1:10:32] weakness and it's something he he dealt
[1:10:35] with continually Paul is going to God
[1:10:37] again are you with me today again and
[1:10:39] again and again he's going to God saying
[1:10:42] God I'm dealing with this thing in my
[1:10:44] life verse number nine and he saith unto
[1:10:47] thee my grace is sufficient for thee for
[1:10:49] my strength is made perfect in
[1:10:52] weakness God's strength is made perfect
[1:10:55] in weakness that's our thought this
[1:10:57] morning is God's strength showing
[1:11:00] because of your
[1:11:01] weakness God showing his strength is
[1:11:05] showing because we have a weakness in
[1:11:07] ourselves now each one of us have a
[1:11:09] weakness God put allows that to be in
[1:11:11] our life it might be an ailment in our
[1:11:14] body it might be a a um some type of
[1:11:18] infirmity Even in our spirit we were
[1:11:20] talking the other day at church you know
[1:11:22] we're a complex
[1:11:24] person brother goes through this and
[1:11:26] greatest battle ever fought and then
[1:11:27] knoweth that not he said you're a you
[1:11:29] have three Realms that you live in see
[1:11:32] taste feel smell and hear and we live in
[1:11:34] that realm but brother man makes this
[1:11:35] amazing statement he said see taste feel
[1:11:38] smell and here was never given to you to
[1:11:40] contact God and that just shocks us when
[1:11:42] we come into the church and then a
[1:11:44] prophet cames because other Ministries
[1:11:46] and the charismatics are like hey did
[1:11:47] you feel God today I'm looking for a
[1:11:50] sensation I'm looking like and propably
[1:11:51] God said those weren't given to you to
[1:11:53] contact God you have another s called
[1:11:56] faith and he that cometh to God Must
[1:11:58] Believe God is a spirit so if I'm going
[1:12:00] to experience God I'm going to
[1:12:02] experience him in a spirit realm so then
[1:12:04] we have a body and we have a a spirit
[1:12:06] realm which is conscience memory
[1:12:08] affection and reasoning and and so and
[1:12:11] then we down inside we know we have a
[1:12:12] soul it's born in sin and that Soul has
[1:12:15] to be born again but the other day we
[1:12:17] asked for prayer and brother Sean
[1:12:18] everybody seemed to be doing well in our
[1:12:19] body and we're so thankful for that so
[1:12:21] thankful to be well in our body but then
[1:12:23] we enter into that Spirit Realm and now
[1:12:25] you have a conscience maybe you have
[1:12:27] affections that aren't doing well today
[1:12:29] maybe you have reasoning and the
[1:12:31] reasoning the Devils come in there are
[1:12:33] you with me today and he's giving you
[1:12:34] some infirmity against maybe Jesus
[1:12:37] Christ or against the message of the
[1:12:38] hour you have some reasoning that's sick
[1:12:41] this morning maybe you have an affection
[1:12:43] that isn't right to where how's the
[1:12:45] Bible say marriage is undei uh marriage
[1:12:48] is Honorable and the bed undefiled and
[1:12:49] the Devil comes in and has created an
[1:12:51] affection that's not well and God is the
[1:12:54] Healer of all of our sickness what's it
[1:12:56] mean to be sick it means you're not well
[1:12:58] so we might be well in our body but now
[1:13:00] we have a conscience and a memory and
[1:13:02] affection and reasoning that can also
[1:13:05] become not well which is sick which is
[1:13:07] an infirmity but God is our healer this
[1:13:10] morning can you say Amen to that God is
[1:13:12] our healer amen he can fix our memory
[1:13:14] you say brother Daniel I got this memory
[1:13:16] way back and it keeps haunting me and
[1:13:18] it's It's haunting me but God can heal
[1:13:20] that today amen God can heal your
[1:13:23] affections with this world is created
[1:13:25] these images and people become
[1:13:26] affectionate towards things and they may
[1:13:28] not be the right kind of affections but
[1:13:31] God is the Healer to set our minds right
[1:13:33] the Bible says let the mind that was in
[1:13:34] Christ let it be inside of us and we are
[1:13:37] all tainted by this images and you go
[1:13:40] you can't go to Walmart and you can't go
[1:13:42] I don't do you have Walmart out here is
[1:13:44] it Costco I don't know they have all
[1:13:45] kinds of denominations and some people
[1:13:48] drive chivies and fors and now they get
[1:13:49] Teslas and Dodges and they did away with
[1:13:51] our Chryslers
[1:13:56] oh well praise the Lord and used to have
[1:14:00] the old Pinos anybody remember the pinto
[1:14:02] cars I loved I had
[1:14:05] one station wagon Volkswagen Beetle bugs
[1:14:09] you know all those ones and so we have
[1:14:11] memories we have good memories and then
[1:14:13] you have bad memories and the devil will
[1:14:15] come in this maybe you have a weakness
[1:14:17] in our our minds let me go through this
[1:14:19] I don't want to get ahead of myself in
[1:14:20] verse number nine most gladly therefore
[1:14:23] will I rather glory in my infirmities
[1:14:25] the power of God May rest upon me so
[1:14:27] he's gloring that he has an infirmity
[1:14:30] amen that keeps him humble before the
[1:14:33] Lord some people think well Lord boy if
[1:14:35] the Lord would bless me financially I
[1:14:37] could just serve the Lord so many but
[1:14:39] you know I see some people that God
[1:14:41] blesses them financially and they come
[1:14:42] to church less and less and less and
[1:14:45] maybe they get investment properties in
[1:14:47] Florida and Canada and overseas and be
[1:14:50] they are the very ones that now have the
[1:14:52] resources that could go to church but
[1:14:54] they are the very ones that go to church
[1:14:56] less and they have the resources to set
[1:14:58] aside so they could go to church so
[1:15:01] sometimes the blessings of the that we
[1:15:03] think come from God or we strive for
[1:15:05] isn't always a blessing it actually
[1:15:06] becomes a curse I've seen young people
[1:15:09] like oh I'm just not as beautiful as
[1:15:11] this person well that person sometimes
[1:15:13] maybe they're blessed with beauty but
[1:15:14] that's the thing that they have to
[1:15:16] constantly are battling with Lord let me
[1:15:18] keep this at the foot of the cross Lord
[1:15:20] let me let me keep it Sanctified or
[1:15:22] something else somebody is battling and
[1:15:23] they want and they're trying to cover it
[1:15:25] after this person says I wish I didn't
[1:15:26] have this this is actually a thorn in my
[1:15:29] flesh so God has given every one of us
[1:15:32] amen a weakness and that weakness should
[1:15:34] drive us to Jesus Christ now if you
[1:15:36] don't know what your weakness is you
[1:15:38] should by now if you're a Christian if
[1:15:39] you're a young Christian I understand
[1:15:41] but as you go on some people like oh I'm
[1:15:43] I'm a Christian Hallelujah I'm going to
[1:15:44] get baptized I'm going to Hallelujah and
[1:15:46] then God will allow you to fall on your
[1:15:48] face to realize you need me Jesus said
[1:15:52] without me you can't do anything and God
[1:15:55] has brings us when we're young and you
[1:15:57] know uh you know you you um I'm not old
[1:15:59] but I've been around a little while you
[1:16:02] know you're um how could I say Spirits
[1:16:04] don't age they don't age so you ask
[1:16:07] somebody like hey I'm going running I'm
[1:16:10] going to run five miles and then your
[1:16:11] body says no you're not going to run
[1:16:13] five miles how they say you know you're
[1:16:16] getting old when your mind makes
[1:16:17] contracts that your body can't carry out
[1:16:19] like we're not climbing that
[1:16:21] Hill you know so our bodies age but our
[1:16:25] spirit Stone Age we're still young so
[1:16:26] you have some of you gray hair but
[1:16:28] you're just as young and my I remember
[1:16:30] when my body would let me make a
[1:16:32] contract and my body would carry it out
[1:16:34] and we'd just go and and do and you're
[1:16:36] young and the glory of young men is your
[1:16:38] strength but after a few our bodies amen
[1:16:41] but we have a new body it's waiting for
[1:16:43] us we have a hope the world has no hope
[1:16:46] but we have a hope in Jesus Christ
[1:16:48] aren't you thankful for that you'll be
[1:16:50] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:16:52] eye the Bible says Comfort one another
[1:16:54] with these words amen that's just not a
[1:16:56] story it's not a fable in a book but
[1:16:58] Jesus Christ he he said I was a I was
[1:17:01] dead and I'm alive forever more so he
[1:17:03] said because because I live you can live
[1:17:06] also amen it's Romans chapter 8 we have
[1:17:08] a hope in this world don't let the devil
[1:17:10] steal your hope we we got too many
[1:17:13] sunsets behind us brother Sean as the
[1:17:15] song says too many sunsets behind us too
[1:17:17] many prayer meetings too many Lonely
[1:17:19] Nights in prayer too many healings of
[1:17:21] our bodies too many healings in our
[1:17:23] spirit and our memory when you go
[1:17:25] through things of life and you say Lord
[1:17:27] I can't go on anymore because of this
[1:17:30] feeling this hurt that I have in my life
[1:17:32] but somehow the great physician comes by
[1:17:35] amen and he heals our
[1:17:37] body you know we go through things I've
[1:17:39] got a my finger right here you can't see
[1:17:41] it it looks like a normal finger but I
[1:17:43] cut my finger have I told that story
[1:17:46] here probably not I maybe I'll just
[1:17:48] share this so one day I went to Walmart
[1:17:51] and we needed a knife and uh there was a
[1:17:54] little knife I forget it was like $2.98
[1:17:57] like it was a long knife brother sea had
[1:17:59] a sheath and I was like this is really
[1:18:01] easy and like this is really neat and so
[1:18:03] I tried it but the problem is they had a
[1:18:05] little nub if you have the handle and
[1:18:07] they have the nub they could put it up
[1:18:08] and they zip tied the the you probably
[1:18:12] seen it put one of those I don't those
[1:18:13] wire things you pulled the zip and it
[1:18:15] was on there and they're just a little
[1:18:17] thing and I like I could pull that off
[1:18:20] and I want to look at this blade and
[1:18:21] look at it so I pulled it wouldn't come
[1:18:22] off brother Sean have I not told this
[1:18:24] here
[1:18:25] uh so I took this thing like this and it
[1:18:28] has a sheath and I um I thought that's
[1:18:31] just little I could just break that
[1:18:33] thing so I pulled real hard well when it
[1:18:35] broke my hand was there and when it came
[1:18:37] out it it went um yeah it was bad so I
[1:18:42] went and and then I looked down on it
[1:18:44] and right away it was just blood
[1:18:46] everywhere I got your attention now
[1:18:48] don't I and so I just looked and it was
[1:18:51] bleed and then it was all over the floor
[1:18:52] and then I was like yikes I pushed
[1:18:55] together and I held it down and there
[1:18:56] was blood on the knife I don't remember
[1:18:58] how I got the blood off the knife I
[1:18:59] might have wiped it on my pants I put it
[1:19:01] back okay okay I'm I'm not g to steal
[1:19:03] this thing there all right I'm okay with
[1:19:05] that and then I'm like okay now how I
[1:19:07] could just go get a rag in the in the
[1:19:09] thing and I could try to um wipe it off
[1:19:12] but then I would have to wait in the
[1:19:14] line this went all the way to the bone
[1:19:15] of my finger and I'm holding it together
[1:19:18] and so I'm just walking I'm like okay
[1:19:20] what do I do I could go get a towel from
[1:19:21] the laundry thing and I can but then I
[1:19:23] got to stand in line and pay for for
[1:19:24] this thing so like I can't do that so
[1:19:27] I'm just kind of walking along like ah
[1:19:29] go to the bathroom so I go to the
[1:19:30] bathroom there was somebody at the sink
[1:19:31] I like uh cuz you know you look like an
[1:19:34] Axe Murderer and so I went over there
[1:19:36] they went out I went and just stuck my
[1:19:38] hand in cuz my whole hand was full of
[1:19:39] blood I just went down washed it off
[1:19:41] like that and as soon as open up it it
[1:19:42] was all the way to the Bone I was just
[1:19:44] all the way and I held it up and I
[1:19:45] rinsed it all out I rinsed the whole
[1:19:47] sink out and I held it together and I
[1:19:48] put it back together and I went got in
[1:19:50] my car and I'm driving in the car and
[1:19:52] anybody like have something like where
[1:19:55] you start getting that fainy feeling
[1:19:57] anybody passed out I've done that a
[1:19:58] couple times and you learn you know I
[1:20:00] passed out brother Sean I went to pray
[1:20:02] is this okay this is right where
[1:20:03] preacher I went to pray for somebody
[1:20:05] with my dad they had a um they had a a
[1:20:08] man that got hit by a had a terrible
[1:20:10] accident he was in traction so they went
[1:20:12] in he had his arms and legs and had pens
[1:20:15] through it and I went in to pray and you
[1:20:17] know and they had you look up and here's
[1:20:19] these pens are hanging from a big rack
[1:20:21] and all of a sudden I go down on the
[1:20:22] floor and they're like ah but I started
[1:20:25] getting fainy you know and you learn
[1:20:27] like through life it's just life you
[1:20:29] learn like okay I start passing out I
[1:20:32] start getting faint I got to get away
[1:20:33] from that before that so I'm driving in
[1:20:35] my car and I start get that and I'm like
[1:20:37] I got to control myself you know because
[1:20:40] we go through things in life and so my
[1:20:42] finger is numb it went all the way to
[1:20:44] the Bone so my I have no feeling in my
[1:20:46] now you all don't know you just see me
[1:20:47] functioning but if I ever see a knife
[1:20:50] and it's un torqued like that that I
[1:20:51] have a trigger and it goes back and I've
[1:20:54] been through through something in my
[1:20:55] life and I've got a weakness but it
[1:20:56] causes me to walk very cautiously
[1:20:59] through life now all of us have been
[1:21:02] through things in our life and the thing
[1:21:04] that makes you you and me me is I've
[1:21:06] have different experiences and he has
[1:21:08] different experience he's lived older
[1:21:10] than myself so he has different
[1:21:12] experiences how do they say every person
[1:21:14] is superior to you in the fact that they
[1:21:16] know something that you don't know so
[1:21:20] whether it's a scientist or whether it's
[1:21:22] a a man on the back of a garbage truck
[1:21:24] he knows how much pressure it takes to
[1:21:26] scoop that thing back in and compress
[1:21:28] I've always wanted to know how much
[1:21:29] pressure is in that and if I could
[1:21:30] survive if somebody threw me in a
[1:21:32] dumpster and I like how do I Ser how
[1:21:34] much so if I meet a garbage man I'm
[1:21:36] going to ask him that you know so I say
[1:21:38] that to say each one of you are
[1:21:39] different than someone else because you
[1:21:41] have experiences that nobody else has
[1:21:43] and God is molding and shaping things
[1:21:46] around you to make you the best tool
[1:21:49] that you can be for the job that you're
[1:21:50] called to do God has a a job for every
[1:21:54] one of you all to
[1:21:55] do and he's molding and shaping you to
[1:21:59] be that
[1:22:00] tool I'm I'm way ahead of myself and I
[1:22:02] just want to get to something here let
[1:22:04] me let me finish this verse and we'll
[1:22:06] we'll we'll come verse number 10
[1:22:07] therefore I take pleasure in my
[1:22:11] infirmities I I take pleasure in the
[1:22:13] things that I'm going through and the
[1:22:15] reproaches and necessities and
[1:22:16] persecutions and distress for Christ
[1:22:18] sake for when I am weak then I am strong
[1:22:21] so Paul is saying when I am weak then
[1:22:24] I'm strong but I'm strong in the Lord so
[1:22:27] we go through things in our life and
[1:22:28] they have what they call triggers I have
[1:22:30] a trigger when I see a knife that's
[1:22:32] under someone's twerking a knife blade
[1:22:34] like no no no no don't do that let me
[1:22:36] come here I'll tell you the story about
[1:22:38] cutting my finger and and and so we see
[1:22:41] that that that um we go through things
[1:22:43] and Paul's saying I take pleasure that
[1:22:46] God's power is showing through my
[1:22:47] weakness now Lucifer he didn't mind
[1:22:50] taking the glory we don't have time this
[1:22:52] morning but go Isaiah chap 4 14 and
[1:22:55] Ezekiel 28 he said I will be exalted I
[1:22:57] will be like the most high I the Bible
[1:22:59] says he was the anointed cherub maybe I
[1:23:02] think that's Ezekiel 28 that just comes
[1:23:04] to my mind Ezekiel the 28th chapter and
[1:23:07] now Lucifer as brother Ram tells us that
[1:23:09] there was only one difference between
[1:23:11] God and Lucifer was God could create and
[1:23:14] Lucifer couldn't he still has that
[1:23:16] handicap today he cannot create he only
[1:23:18] perverts so you watch in the music God
[1:23:21] we Man was created in God's image so you
[1:23:23] see a lot of the the people that have
[1:23:25] fallen out into the world the musicians
[1:23:26] and movie stars a lot of them came from
[1:23:28] church and they get their Inspirations
[1:23:30] brother Ram said I think uh was it Elvis
[1:23:32] Presley said he learned his moves in the
[1:23:34] house of God and he would he would move
[1:23:36] in in a moral immoral way but they got
[1:23:38] their inspiration for God from God
[1:23:40] because Jesus said I am the way I am the
[1:23:42] truth I am life I am inspiration so you
[1:23:44] watch how the Devil comes and he takes
[1:23:46] their inspiration he takes their talent
[1:23:48] and pulls it out and uses it for a devil
[1:23:50] and he just throws their life away after
[1:23:52] a while they have mental breakdowns they
[1:23:54] they they uh take their life many of
[1:23:56] them overdose because God has given them
[1:23:58] inspiration and the devil the how's the
[1:24:00] Bible say John 10:10 the thief cometh
[1:24:01] but to steal kill and to destroy true so
[1:24:05] the god creates inspiration you see
[1:24:07] Christians are smiling they don't have
[1:24:09] tattoos all over face they can talk in
[1:24:11] complete sentence we were talking about
[1:24:12] it in Proverbs Chapter 5 6 and 7 uh
[1:24:16] about the evil woman the Bible says the
[1:24:17] adulterous woman s looks for the
[1:24:20] searches for the precious life she's not
[1:24:23] looking for that guy laying in to get
[1:24:24] her out there can't talk he's she's
[1:24:26] looking for a man that can walk upright
[1:24:28] talk intelligently show up every day for
[1:24:30] a job and come home every night that's
[1:24:32] what the adulterous woman is look that's
[1:24:34] what the world wants and the women they
[1:24:37] in the world they think they want some
[1:24:38] man that can walk all over and but now
[1:24:40] there's we see this great movement
[1:24:42] reversing a woman is actually wanting to
[1:24:44] stay home and take care of children and
[1:24:46] have a man that will go out into the
[1:24:47] world and protect them and provide for
[1:24:49] them it you can't get away from God's
[1:24:52] original way amen so Lucifer he was
[1:24:55] exalted let's go to Ezekiel chapter
[1:25:00] 28 I didn't tell the brothers back there
[1:25:02] and there uh verse 23 2813 says Thou was
[1:25:07] an Eden in the garden of God verse 14
[1:25:10] Thou Art the anointed cherub that
[1:25:12] coverthe so thou was upon the holy Mount
[1:25:16] of God thou H has
[1:25:18] walked up and down in the midst of the
[1:25:20] stones thou was perfect in all thy ways
[1:25:22] from the day that that thou was created
[1:25:25] till iniquity was found in thee so we
[1:25:28] find that Satan he was exalted he he
[1:25:30] desired to be like God he desired to be
[1:25:32] lifted up he was anointed he was so
[1:25:34] don't go by
[1:25:35] anointing you can't go by anointing
[1:25:37] brother Rand it's so amazing this
[1:25:39] message Comey preach the anointed ones
[1:25:41] at the end time we don't go by the
[1:25:42] anointing as they said in the old days
[1:25:44] in Pentecost man it was the man a
[1:25:46] preacher that had the most beautiful
[1:25:47] wife that was beautiful and could sing
[1:25:49] and the man that could sweat the most
[1:25:51] and man that was the guy that we
[1:25:52] followed but then all of a sudden God
[1:25:54] sends a prophet along maybe couldn't
[1:25:56] sing the best and his wife you never saw
[1:25:58] her out in the Forefront and carry a
[1:26:00] tune and maybe his delivery was a little
[1:26:02] Octor but God was sending a message and
[1:26:05] he was I'm going to get ahead of myself
[1:26:06] here but he says I think it's in the
[1:26:08] Deep C of the deep he said you know I'm
[1:26:10] waiting for something I'm helpless as a
[1:26:12] baby and now a prophet knows that he is
[1:26:15] weak brother Sean he has no ability
[1:26:18] there's maybe 8,000 people are standing
[1:26:20] came that night to see the angel of the
[1:26:22] Lord manifest himself and hears a vessel
[1:26:24] saying I am as helpless as a baby I have
[1:26:27] a seventh grade education I have nothing
[1:26:30] but God's strength was made perfect in
[1:26:33] his weakness so when a prophet realizes
[1:26:36] I there's he said he said he the angel
[1:26:38] of the Lord told him when he came to um
[1:26:41] to the little cabin so I live in
[1:26:43] Charlestown that's right a few miles
[1:26:45] from where the angel of the Lord visited
[1:26:47] brother brandham and so the angel of the
[1:26:48] Lord met him in the cabin remember he
[1:26:50] was on the way to the cave some people
[1:26:51] say he was in the cave but he wasn't he
[1:26:52] was in the cabin remember he said the
[1:26:54] angel of the Lord walk through the door
[1:26:55] we need to listen to the tapes and not
[1:26:57] there's a lot of stuff going around but
[1:26:59] if you'll listen to God's Prophet God
[1:27:01] sent a messenger we're going to read
[1:27:02] some things and God has allowed at the
[1:27:04] only age is this okay the only age God
[1:27:07] has allowed The Messengers that age his
[1:27:09] voice to be uh sustained and stored so
[1:27:13] so the people of that age amen could
[1:27:15] continue to hear it and I believe that
[1:27:17] the the Rapture is three-fold shout
[1:27:19] voice and trumpet your pastors taught
[1:27:21] you that from the message the Rapture
[1:27:23] and it's a shout it's it's a message
[1:27:25] that's going out it's a message that's
[1:27:27] going out I'm so glad that we don't have
[1:27:29] to rely on people that just hey somebody
[1:27:31] told me this and somebody told me this I
[1:27:33] live in Jeffersonville I know all these
[1:27:35] people and everybody's got a story and I
[1:27:37] appreciate their stories but the B of
[1:27:39] God said you say what I said on those
[1:27:41] saves and God has allowed all of us the
[1:27:43] ability to listen to God's Prophet that
[1:27:45] your faith might be turned back to the
[1:27:47] Faith of Our Fathers oh I believe it
[1:27:49] with all of my heart we don't have to
[1:27:51] believe and listen to hear say we can
[1:27:53] listen to God's prophet and I've always
[1:27:55] appreciated that about brother Shawn and
[1:27:57] the Martin family how that they they
[1:27:59] give this message the the the the
[1:28:01] Credence that it
[1:28:03] should amen you you think about um even
[1:28:06] St Paul he said if I or an angel from
[1:28:09] heaven come and preach any other gospel
[1:28:11] than that which I've preached unto you
[1:28:12] let him be a cursed so Paul is not in
[1:28:15] just saying hey if I die and somebody
[1:28:17] else comes you don't listen to him he
[1:28:18] said if I come back with some type of an
[1:28:20] ailment In My
[1:28:22] Memory if I get mention and I come back
[1:28:25] and say what I preach back there isn't
[1:28:27] right he said let me be a cursed how do
[1:28:30] he say it if any man think himself to be
[1:28:32] spiritual let him consider that the
[1:28:34] things that I've have written unto you
[1:28:35] are the Commandments of almighty God
[1:28:37] Amen so that was the Commandments of God
[1:28:39] he said don't let somebody come in and
[1:28:41] your reasoning don't let them
[1:28:43] come in and your imagination
[1:28:45] your your affections amen be
[1:28:46] affectionate towards the word of God and
[1:28:48] maybe you're not today the other day
[1:28:51] somebody they sang brother Sean's song
[1:28:52] We were singing at church Jesus you're
[1:28:54] the center of my joy brother John was
[1:28:56] branded with that in my life as well but
[1:28:58] I realized Lord You're Not the center of
[1:29:00] my joy there's just something about
[1:29:03] being honest with God and I sat there
[1:29:06] and I said Lord I'm singing this song
[1:29:07] but you are not the center of my joy and
[1:29:10] I need you to become the center of my
[1:29:13] joy because as a prophet of God said
[1:29:15] there's many disappointments in life and
[1:29:18] he said if you don't have your mind set
[1:29:20] completely on Jesus Christ he said there
[1:29:22] are many hurts that cancers come into
[1:29:25] people's memory cancers come into
[1:29:27] people's reasoning and they start oh if
[1:29:29] I had done it different back there but
[1:29:31] brother bam said God allows those
[1:29:33] disappointments to come to cause you to
[1:29:35] slow down and stop and think about your
[1:29:39] life oh my let's just get past Lucifer
[1:29:43] because there's some more things that I
[1:29:44] want to say because he was exalted he
[1:29:46] was lifted up but there's something
[1:29:48] about weakness now we in America we
[1:29:50] don't like weakness we like strength
[1:29:52] that's what I'm saying I I we we had
[1:29:54] some politicians before I'm from Indiana
[1:29:57] we had a man called Mike Pence he was a
[1:29:59] he was a righteous man in the capacity
[1:30:01] that he was SE January I'm talk politics
[1:30:05] January uh 6 when they were having that
[1:30:07] Insurrection if you go back and watch he
[1:30:09] he was in the basement quoting
[1:30:11] scriptures to his colleagues they were
[1:30:12] going to try to kill him they were
[1:30:13] saying and they were coming to hang him
[1:30:15] on he's down in the basement of the
[1:30:17] White House or wherever they was that
[1:30:19] they were they were down in this
[1:30:20] basement quoting scriptures back and
[1:30:22] forth and later that night it's amazing
[1:30:24] watch him and his colleagues were
[1:30:25] quoting scriptures it's it's real so we
[1:30:27] had some righteous in but our nation
[1:30:28] doesn't want righteous men they want
[1:30:30] radical they want radical it's those
[1:30:32] cage fighters we want somebody that's in
[1:30:34] your face and that's what America wants
[1:30:36] and that's what they're going to get
[1:30:37] they want something that's radical and
[1:30:39] extreme they don't want a conservative
[1:30:41] godly man that says hey we're going to
[1:30:42] pray about this we're about to go into
[1:30:44] World War II we need to pray everybody
[1:30:46] pray and seek God and let's seek
[1:30:48] Direction people don't want that they
[1:30:49] want something radical amen but there's
[1:30:52] something about a Christian they
[1:30:54] realized from the scripture as Paul had
[1:30:55] a weakness and that weakness is what
[1:30:58] allowed God's strength to be
[1:31:00] shown brother Bram surrendered himself
[1:31:03] to God and that weakness that he had
[1:31:05] allowed Christ that actually the son of
[1:31:07] man Ministry to be shown so greatly that
[1:31:10] we had what we called the deity spirit
[1:31:12] there were people that actually believed
[1:31:14] he was Jesus Christ I live in this area
[1:31:18] I the random Tabernacle it maybe was was
[1:31:21] prevalent there and people brother man
[1:31:23] he in the Bruce serpent he came and he
[1:31:24] leaves the ministry he said I I went
[1:31:26] there and they were baptizing in my name
[1:31:27] they were praying in my name I know
[1:31:29] these people and that's what I like to
[1:31:31] say to the critics sometimes brother
[1:31:33] Sean like hey was your ministry so much
[1:31:36] like Christ that people thought that you
[1:31:38] were literally Jesus Christ came back to
[1:31:42] the earth I know brother Charlie Cox
[1:31:45] some of you all know him said we never
[1:31:46] had a worry because brother branam was
[1:31:48] one phone call away my father-in-law he
[1:31:50] went hunting and he run a stick through
[1:31:52] his ear and and he bled a whole pillow
[1:31:55] of blood out of out out of his ear into
[1:31:56] the he they just called brother brandom
[1:31:58] brother Bram says it on tape he said he
[1:32:00] he he he talks about on tape brother
[1:32:02] brandom just prays for him he goes back
[1:32:03] he burst his eardrum he goes back to the
[1:32:05] doctor and his his ear is completely
[1:32:06] healed God healed his ear he said
[1:32:08] brother brandom was just one phone call
[1:32:10] away oh Jesus Christ is still the same
[1:32:13] yesterday today and forever we just need
[1:32:15] to have faith and God removed so we
[1:32:17] wouldn't think this was our savior God
[1:32:19] removed him so that we started looking
[1:32:21] to the right place I'm the Lord heals
[1:32:24] all your sicknesses and all of your
[1:32:25] diseases amen we need to get our
[1:32:27] theology right we're not praying to
[1:32:29] brother random he said if you get the
[1:32:31] people to believe that this is a gift
[1:32:33] here's God here's Fallen man I'm just a
[1:32:35] channel if you get the people to believe
[1:32:37] amen that I'm a channel nothing will
[1:32:39] stand before your prayer not even
[1:32:41] cancer I was talking to somebody the
[1:32:43] other day and they're aging they're up
[1:32:45] and they said well hey I disagree with
[1:32:46] Brother bandam on on on on several
[1:32:48] points and but they had a sickness in
[1:32:50] their body I said you know what I would
[1:32:51] do if I Was 80 years old and had a
[1:32:53] sickness in my body I wouldn't worry
[1:32:55] about where I disagreed with him I would
[1:32:57] worry about the prayer lines he said if
[1:32:59] you get the people to believe me nothing
[1:33:00] will stand before your prayer and when I
[1:33:03] get to heaven I'd say hey here's the
[1:33:04] things I don't understand well you talk
[1:33:05] to me about but I know that your
[1:33:07] ministry is a gift from God to help me
[1:33:10] now that's the same with your pastor
[1:33:12] that's the same with your musician I do
[1:33:13] not understand how those people do play
[1:33:15] those keys the other day a brother got
[1:33:17] up and sang a special and he sang in
[1:33:19] English and then he just switched to
[1:33:20] Spanish and was singing in Spanish and
[1:33:21] they didn't they just went on and play
[1:33:23] like oh music transverses languages oh
[1:33:25] that's interesting I learn every day I
[1:33:27] don't understand that but it's yeah so
[1:33:29] like okay I'm learning same with brother
[1:33:31] sea or whatever like I don't understand
[1:33:33] that Ministry but as we go along like oh
[1:33:35] okay I understand that I understand why
[1:33:38] brother Ram said Minister should sleep
[1:33:39] in a Monday because they give everything
[1:33:41] out and they just like
[1:33:43] ah you know and maybe you don't they
[1:33:45] didn't understand brother Brandon why he
[1:33:46] was so weak and like they had that
[1:33:48] little thing remember if you watch on
[1:33:50] deep C the Deep brother Billy comes
[1:33:52] behind brother brandom he takes his
[1:33:53] Bible
[1:33:54] and then the other thing he had this
[1:33:55] thing where they worked on both sides he
[1:33:57] would touch him on the sides and brother
[1:33:59] brandom if he pushed in on his side he
[1:34:00] was he was conscious because remember
[1:34:03] Jesus the woman touched His Garment he
[1:34:06] said I feel like virtue has gone out so
[1:34:07] when the people were pulling it would
[1:34:09] pull virtue out of brother rand's I
[1:34:11] don't understand it's just the way it
[1:34:12] was so they worked out this little
[1:34:13] system and so remember when brother
[1:34:16] Billy would leave him in too long he
[1:34:17] would just get real faint and he'd tell
[1:34:19] him like brother Billy we can't have a
[1:34:21] prayer line tomorrow because I'm too
[1:34:23] weak you left me in too long and so they
[1:34:25] worked out the system we wouldn't have
[1:34:27] the discernments if it wasn't for
[1:34:28] brother Billy Paul but he and his father
[1:34:30] they had a Ministry and they work
[1:34:32] together and so brother Billy you watch
[1:34:34] it brother brandom comes right beside
[1:34:35] him and he feels him on the side and
[1:34:36] then they and brother Billy when brother
[1:34:38] br's praying he comes brother Billy
[1:34:39] comes and puts his hands on both Sid of
[1:34:41] they worked out a system that he would
[1:34:42] take him out when he was no longer
[1:34:44] conscious and so we all have weaknesses
[1:34:46] and we learn to work with those
[1:34:51] weaknesses each one of us have a
[1:34:53] weakness maybe it was something happened
[1:34:55] way back in our childhood I think
[1:34:56] brother brandom's in derer he said he
[1:34:58] stand there he says sister I see I see a
[1:35:00] nervousness it was caused by a dog a dog
[1:35:02] chased you when you were young and now
[1:35:04] it's creating something way back in her
[1:35:07] life but she came to Jesus Christ who
[1:35:09] can fix those things and maybe every
[1:35:12] time she heard a dog bark she went back
[1:35:13] to that and it created such a fear
[1:35:16] because there's things in our life that
[1:35:17] will paralyze us and me we can't let the
[1:35:20] devil paralyze Our Lives we're
[1:35:22] Christians we're so soldiers of the
[1:35:25] Cross but things that we go through in
[1:35:27] our life can paralyze us I I don't want
[1:35:30] to get ahead of myself here let's just
[1:35:31] let's just stay together Moses when he
[1:35:34] came and he had abilities he he God said
[1:35:36] look I need you to do this he said Lord
[1:35:38] I can't speak we were kidding the other
[1:35:40] day some of the brothers together you
[1:35:41] know he was the the Bible says he he
[1:35:44] taught the masters of Israel right of of
[1:35:46] Egypt so he was to be the night he was a
[1:35:48] great learned man he was a proper child
[1:35:51] so then later God talks to him said I
[1:35:52] want you to go down there going be the
[1:35:53] delivery he said I can't talk and I said
[1:35:56] what happened and we got
[1:36:00] married brother Rim said he had a temper
[1:36:02] and his wife had a temper and after a
[1:36:04] while he got to the place I can't even
[1:36:05] say anything without him her shooting me
[1:36:07] down and just I can't even talk God and
[1:36:10] God said look we're you know I'm not
[1:36:12] here to talk to you about your
[1:36:14] inabilities because God has ways to mold
[1:36:16] us and shape uses and sometimes uh um my
[1:36:21] wife sent me something like that today
[1:36:22] like basically that she was the one
[1:36:25] there to help me through life and she is
[1:36:26] my friend brother Minister was and he
[1:36:28] showed me an ironing board and he was
[1:36:30] trying to iron this morning and you know
[1:36:32] God does those things to help us through
[1:36:34] life it's called a
[1:36:35] helpmate young people trying to they get
[1:36:37] up and they get all Google out like like
[1:36:39] forget that stuff you're trying to get a
[1:36:41] helpmate it's like right foot left foot
[1:36:43] you ever played soccer on one foot you
[1:36:45] can do it but it's so nice when you have
[1:36:48] the other foot it looks more normal and
[1:36:51] natural right and God
[1:36:54] go back to Genesis and God created man
[1:36:56] male and female created it was one and
[1:36:58] then God created a help man he took the
[1:36:59] feminine Spirit out and put it it's such
[1:37:01] a beautiful thing but marriage is
[1:37:03] Honorable so some times people go
[1:37:05] through things I'll say it like this
[1:37:07] maybe somebody else makes a decision and
[1:37:10] exits a marriage and it begins to affect
[1:37:11] that person and sometimes you see
[1:37:14] sometimes people a lot of times the the
[1:37:16] the the lesbian and that thing it comes
[1:37:18] from a complex or an injury maybe
[1:37:21] there's an abuse or maybe there's a
[1:37:22] father that didn't um take care of his
[1:37:24] family or Abus his family so that
[1:37:26] daughter says look there's no good men
[1:37:28] are you with me and like well just a
[1:37:30] marriage is just a terrible thing no the
[1:37:33] devil caused that God didn't cause that
[1:37:36] we were made in the image of God and the
[1:37:38] Bible says marriage is Honorable the
[1:37:40] devil is the one that corrupted that God
[1:37:42] didn't cause that problem the devil did
[1:37:45] and so now the world has created this
[1:37:46] image of what a marriage should be and I
[1:37:49] you know if God created it we ought to
[1:37:50] go back to the Bible and see what a
[1:37:52] marriage should be so sometimes the
[1:37:54] Devil comes in and there's Injustice you
[1:37:56] know I was thinking of that brother Ram
[1:37:58] said life wasn't meant to be easy life
[1:38:01] wasn't we got some people back brother
[1:38:03] brother Sean they they work like six
[1:38:05] hours a day make great money they and
[1:38:08] it's like I think of that prophet and
[1:38:10] then people get this entitlement thing
[1:38:12] like hey I don't have to work I just I
[1:38:13] should be getting a paycheck and and so
[1:38:15] I think what the prophet of God said
[1:38:17] that uh you know how is it character is
[1:38:19] not a gift it's a victory it's something
[1:38:23] you struggled with and if if you got a
[1:38:25] home today you fought and struggled to
[1:38:27] have that home if you have a marriage is
[1:38:28] because you struggled and worked through
[1:38:30] the thing and uh you know if you have a
[1:38:32] sound mind today you struggled to have a
[1:38:34] sound mind because the devil is there to
[1:38:37] destroy us and and and take our minds
[1:38:39] and get it and and that's what this
[1:38:41] social media has done it's caused people
[1:38:42] to get hooked on um dopamine and I'm
[1:38:46] that's a whole another sermon we are not
[1:38:48] ignorant of his devices and how that the
[1:38:49] devil a man left Facebook and they said
[1:38:51] he got into a room and said how can we
[1:38:53] addict these people to get them to stay
[1:38:55] on our Facebook and they said we went to
[1:38:57] the gambling industry when you pull down
[1:38:58] the slot machine and it does a ding and
[1:39:01] then and we we took that and put it into
[1:39:03] social media when a person does tries to
[1:39:05] pull it down to get uh more content to
[1:39:08] come and because when you he see
[1:39:09] something you like it releases dopamine
[1:39:11] in your brain which is many uh uh many
[1:39:14] times more addictive than cocaine who
[1:39:15] said we've addicted a society and they
[1:39:17] said what have we done to humanity we've
[1:39:19] addicted them to something and that's
[1:39:21] why see people sometimes you take a see
[1:39:23] kids you take their phone and they throw
[1:39:24] a f don't blame them blame you you've
[1:39:28] gave them something that's very
[1:39:29] addictive and now it's like taking a
[1:39:31] cocaine addict and taking his cocaine
[1:39:32] away he's just like ah so God help us we
[1:39:35] come to church and say Lord how do we
[1:39:37] deal with this stuff like how do we
[1:39:39] that's what was it James the first
[1:39:40] chapter If any man like wisdom let him
[1:39:42] ask God and that's what we're doing God
[1:39:43] help me God I do not know how to
[1:39:46] navigate through this life you have to
[1:39:48] help me Lord I I don't as one the
[1:39:50] brother was a nurse he said they they
[1:39:52] release our um schedules on Facebook you
[1:39:55] if you don't have Facebook you're not so
[1:39:57] I say Lord help me to navigate through
[1:39:59] this I need the Lord Jesus I got to have
[1:40:02] him or should we say we have a weakness
[1:40:05] they were talking about they've
[1:40:06] capitalized on the weaknesses of
[1:40:08] humanity whether it's gambling or
[1:40:10] addiction or whatever it is and some of
[1:40:12] those things they paralyze a person
[1:40:15] don't let me get ahead of it so Moses he
[1:40:17] comes and and God begins to shape Moses
[1:40:19] and make him to what he ought to be and
[1:40:21] he goes down and delivers the people
[1:40:23] people but think about this when he
[1:40:25] comes out people begin to affect
[1:40:28] him and he's standing at a Red Sea and
[1:40:31] the people begin to trigger things in
[1:40:33] his mind so he's standing there he's
[1:40:35] like Lord I could just get a boat and go
[1:40:36] across but now I got two million people
[1:40:38] that are depending upon me to get them
[1:40:41] across this Red Sea and it triggers
[1:40:42] something he starts crying and now he's
[1:40:45] crying but what does that weakness when
[1:40:47] he realiz listen to me when he realized
[1:40:49] I can't do this I have a weakness I got
[1:40:53] two million people I got to feed these
[1:40:56] people I got to deliver them from and he
[1:40:58] realized I'm not capable amen so now in
[1:41:03] his weakness oh if he had been a great
[1:41:05] military like hey when we come out of
[1:41:06] here we're going to train all these
[1:41:07] soldiers you all will be in the back it
[1:41:09] but he didn't have any of that in fact
[1:41:11] there was a pillar of fire that went
[1:41:13] before him that was leading him oh but
[1:41:15] then that Pillar of Fire went and was
[1:41:17] behind them and it became their
[1:41:19] protection that stood between them and
[1:41:21] between the enemy oh blessed be the name
[1:41:24] of the Lord we have a Ministry that was
[1:41:25] identified by a pillar of fire it's
[1:41:27] leading Us by a message of the hour but
[1:41:30] it sometimes it goes behind you and it
[1:41:32] begins to protect you in your
[1:41:34] weakness aren't you thankful
[1:41:36] today amen this just comes to mind the
[1:41:39] other day uh president Trump I'm not
[1:41:41] prophesying his you call past
[1:41:43] president's President right so president
[1:41:44] Trump when he was given his speech and a
[1:41:46] sniper was was a way he didn't even see
[1:41:49] what was happening but in another realm
[1:41:51] are you with me another Realm elev ated
[1:41:53] realm a sniper is trying to take his
[1:41:55] life and he maybe got some shots out and
[1:41:58] maybe Hur hit him and and and president
[1:42:01] Trump just gets down behind the the
[1:42:02] podium but there was another sniper that
[1:42:05] took out the other
[1:42:07] sniper so there there there's snipers
[1:42:10] there's spiritual demons in high places
[1:42:12] that are trying to destroy your life
[1:42:14] they're not coming to play patty cake
[1:42:15] they're coming to destroy your home your
[1:42:17] marriage your mind to put you in a
[1:42:19] premature grave to take your own life
[1:42:21] that's what the but there's another Holy
[1:42:22] Spirit
[1:42:23] amen that sees way out he sees the
[1:42:25] tactics of the enemy and greater is he
[1:42:28] that's on your side than he that's on
[1:42:29] the other side remember the servant come
[1:42:32] to G to Elisha said look they're all
[1:42:34] around us and God says look open his
[1:42:37] eyes that he can see what I'm seeing and
[1:42:40] God opened his eyes and he had a
[1:42:42] revelation nothing changed but his
[1:42:44] revelation of what he was seeing may God
[1:42:46] open our eyes today and say if God's
[1:42:49] called me he that has called me he's
[1:42:50] faithful to complete everything that
[1:42:52] he's started inside of me do you believe
[1:42:54] that today you believe God would start
[1:42:57] to build a house and he's like ah man
[1:42:59] Rapture came didn't get down sorry we're
[1:43:01] out of here no if he's called you that's
[1:43:04] why Peter says make your calling an
[1:43:06] election sure you realize I didn't just
[1:43:07] ask to get into this God came and found
[1:43:10] me one day he picked me up have you
[1:43:13] worked that out with God have you that
[1:43:15] only comes through prayer maybe stopping
[1:43:17] the laundry and just sitting down and
[1:43:18] say Lord am I was I trapped into this by
[1:43:21] marriage or am I in this really because
[1:43:22] I believe this this is my life I believe
[1:43:26] this brother Sean I'm giving my life I'm
[1:43:28] I'm 56 years old the same age that
[1:43:30] brother brandom was when he passed away
[1:43:32] I you know I'm I'm too old to think and
[1:43:36] so I'm like hey is there a better way
[1:43:37] and I'm hey if the if Benny hen had it
[1:43:40] I'd be there if the Amish had it I'd be
[1:43:42] there and I probably said that before
[1:43:43] because but there's nothing else out
[1:43:45] there that I want to go to and I see
[1:43:47] some people that are leaving brother
[1:43:48] Sean I'm like I never want to go where
[1:43:50] you're going and I don't even want any
[1:43:52] of my friends to go where you're going
[1:43:54] because I have a great God that is the
[1:43:56] Healer amen of my body but not only my
[1:44:00] body of my conscience my memory my
[1:44:02] affection my reasoning he's our healer
[1:44:05] today he can make all things wrong
[1:44:07] that's wrong he can make them right if
[1:44:09] you're here today and you got sin in
[1:44:10] your soul he that's what he really died
[1:44:12] for was for your so Soul problem our
[1:44:14] bodies are going to die and go to De go
[1:44:16] to go to the Grave our spirit realm you
[1:44:19] know and so we want our soul to be
[1:44:21] redeemed in Jesus Christ amen amen so
[1:44:24] the
[1:44:25] weakness that Moses had was what drove
[1:44:28] him to
[1:44:29] God
[1:44:31] now I don't know if you're allowed to do
[1:44:33] this when you're a preacher but that's
[1:44:35] just who I am so a lot of time is quotes
[1:44:38] and things but I have a weakness and
[1:44:41] they say when you share weaknesses
[1:44:43] You're vulnerable right because then
[1:44:44] somebody knows you're weak that's all
[1:44:46] right
[1:44:47] so you're not going to you're you're
[1:44:50] with okay I'm going to hold you to it
[1:44:52] okay sorry so we we all have weaknesses
[1:44:56] and I'm going to share one that I
[1:44:58] have and it's it's a a demon that
[1:45:01] follows me around it's the same demon
[1:45:04] that followed Christ when he took him up
[1:45:05] on the thing and said cast yourself off
[1:45:08] so this follows me whenever I go to a
[1:45:11] place that's high this whatever it is I
[1:45:14] don't I can't explain it it comes and
[1:45:15] says jump he says jump off this might be
[1:45:18] really personal but it's it's just me
[1:45:20] okay it's a it's it's something that's
[1:45:22] there
[1:45:24] every time I get close to something this
[1:45:25] something will say JUMP just jump off
[1:45:29] and I say that because if I yield to
[1:45:32] that it will destroy me now each one of
[1:45:35] you may have and maybe we have many
[1:45:37] weaknesses because we're humanity and
[1:45:39] the more listen to me the more
[1:45:41] weaknesses you have the closer you walk
[1:45:43] to
[1:45:45] Christ amen the more weaknesses you have
[1:45:48] the closer you walk to Jesus Christ
[1:45:51] that's a great revelation and when you
[1:45:53] realize I am weak but he is strong and I
[1:45:56] cannot make it without him am but
[1:46:00] there's people in your life that'll set
[1:46:01] these triggers off and one of them in my
[1:46:04] life is my wife so we went to Colorado
[1:46:07] and I think it's the longest suspension
[1:46:09] bridge in the US and she's like we got
[1:46:11] to go walk this bridge I'm like yeah you
[1:46:14] know and I'm like yeah yeah let's go do
[1:46:15] that let's go do it and I it's not till
[1:46:17] I get there I realize oh that's that
[1:46:19] thing and it's here and so we walk and I
[1:46:23] walk it's probably the bridge is
[1:46:25] probably from that Pew this wide and but
[1:46:28] it's like a th000 ft down it's just I
[1:46:30] mean it's beautiful to stand back but
[1:46:32] when I get close to the edge it so I I
[1:46:34] walk in the middle she's with me I walk
[1:46:35] in the middle and we make the other side
[1:46:37] it was beautiful time we spent together
[1:46:39] and then coming back she's like going to
[1:46:41] the edge looking over it's beautiful
[1:46:42] taking pictures and and this thing comes
[1:46:45] and it says jump jump and it's a power
[1:46:48] and it's just and I start just walking
[1:46:50] fast and she's way back there and and
[1:46:53] and at the end I was practically running
[1:46:55] off the bridge to get off the bridge
[1:46:57] because this thing was there I don't
[1:46:58] maybe that makes me a bad person I don't
[1:47:00] know it's the same when that was chasing
[1:47:01] Jesus if I'm bad then Jesus was bad
[1:47:03] because that's what it told him to do
[1:47:05] Chum but I have a weakness whatever that
[1:47:07] is I don't understand it I don't try
[1:47:09] sometimes we try to analyze our weakness
[1:47:11] just rather than just saying that's a
[1:47:12] weakness I got to get away from that
[1:47:15] because I know the other day my wife
[1:47:16] wanted to go walking they put built a
[1:47:18] new bridge across the river is this okay
[1:47:20] like now you know brother Daniel's
[1:47:22] weakness and you see me on a bridge
[1:47:23] please stop and Pull Me Away From The
[1:47:26] Edge all right be brother I told you you
[1:47:29] got to stop you got to stop and help me
[1:47:31] off the bridge so my wife she's like
[1:47:32] let's go walk and so we walk and we get
[1:47:34] to the to the thing and and it's a long
[1:47:37] way I didn't want to walk it's like five
[1:47:39] miles all the way down back I'm like I'm
[1:47:40] not going we made it to the bridge I'm
[1:47:42] like let's go back and she's like no
[1:47:43] let's just go halfway so I just go maybe
[1:47:47] 500 ft out and I look down there's a
[1:47:50] boat down there now I'm at the edge and
[1:47:51] there's a stick thicking up and my mind
[1:47:53] is like I start reasoning I don't
[1:47:55] whatever that is it's like hey if you
[1:47:56] jump there's a stick I wonder if you
[1:47:58] tipped your feet if you would and you
[1:48:00] wouldn't and you how deep does it have
[1:48:02] to be before you and you start reasoning
[1:48:05] whatever that is it start we can't
[1:48:06] reasoning the Bible says cast down
[1:48:08] reasoning now I can tell you if I had
[1:48:11] reasoned with the devil I wouldn't be
[1:48:12] here today if I had reasoned with
[1:48:15] whatever that we now you whatever your
[1:48:16] weaknesses you you should know you know
[1:48:19] men women you have a weakness and
[1:48:21] brother said when I get tired get that
[1:48:23] Moody down depressed or whatever it is
[1:48:25] that blues or whatever and you play and
[1:48:27] you try to reason with that rather than
[1:48:28] just get away from he say be happy and
[1:48:30] sing songs and talk about the Lord and
[1:48:33] and that's just the way of life and we
[1:48:34] go through that we're going through it
[1:48:36] we're not going to sit and reason to
[1:48:38] become a vegetable and let it paralyze
[1:48:40] us can you say Amen to that I don't know
[1:48:42] why the Lord has me here today but maybe
[1:48:44] the Lord's speaking to some of us today
[1:48:47] don't let your weakness be the thing
[1:48:48] that that that that that stops you let
[1:48:50] it be the weakness that drives you to
[1:48:52] Jesus Christ Lord I can't speak that's
[1:48:55] okay Moses I'm going to give you Aaron a
[1:48:57] crutch that'll help you go and still be
[1:48:59] the
[1:49:00] deliverer but I can't be a wife because
[1:49:02] I this triggers and I've seen bad
[1:49:04] marriages and that that's okay but God's
[1:49:07] going to give you a little something to
[1:49:08] help you through
[1:49:09] life amen how's it say first John 1 we
[1:49:12] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[1:49:14] Christ somebody called it's a paraclet
[1:49:17] you go back and look somebody called
[1:49:19] alongside to help and he's there to help
[1:49:21] me saying Daniel don't go by that Edge
[1:49:23] don't reason with that thing just get
[1:49:24] away from
[1:49:26] it just get away from it stay in Christ
[1:49:29] there's life in
[1:49:31] Christ there's so many things that can
[1:49:33] paralyze you maybe fear maybe doubt well
[1:49:37] I don't know do you think and then it
[1:49:38] just pretty soon it paralyzes your faith
[1:49:41] paralyzes your marit maybe a little
[1:49:43] seated discrepancy I wonder if that
[1:49:45] could be and all of a sudden your life
[1:49:47] becomes paralyzed addictions people
[1:49:50] start D dabbling with the I hope that is
[1:49:53] okay I thank God for this message and
[1:49:55] the denominations brother bam said they
[1:49:57] would teach you to drink
[1:49:58] moderately okay so when kid you had a
[1:50:01] kid he's going off to college you like
[1:50:02] it's body mass index um BMI okay it
[1:50:06] takes five beers to get somebody that's
[1:50:09] large and if you're really thin then
[1:50:11] only one beer so they teach them before
[1:50:13] you go to college you need to consume
[1:50:14] beer so you know hey it's two and a half
[1:50:16] beers will make you drunk you need to
[1:50:18] only drink two beers this is religious
[1:50:21] people brother Bram is tell they they're
[1:50:23] teaching them and they're using he
[1:50:25] turned the water into wine and you see
[1:50:26] how the devil take that thing and twist
[1:50:28] it right
[1:50:29] around but there's a people that are
[1:50:31] nazarites to God they have a purpose
[1:50:34] like Samson I'm I'm under a covenant
[1:50:36] with God and man shun the very
[1:50:38] appearance of being a part of the world
[1:50:40] and shun the very appearance of being on
[1:50:42] that evil side whatever they do I do the
[1:50:43] opposite get away from it and so the
[1:50:45] prophet of God comes and said no you're
[1:50:47] teaching those kids to be
[1:50:49] alcoholics because you know what listen
[1:50:51] to me right here the devil has to tell
[1:50:53] you it's moderation but the devil knows
[1:50:55] nothing about
[1:50:57] moderation I am really sharing some I
[1:51:01] have an UPS we have a little business to
[1:51:03] try to pay the bills there's a UPS
[1:51:04] driver that comes anybody have UPS
[1:51:06] driver comes to your house well that's
[1:51:08] is this man coming he's a habitual
[1:51:10] Gambler and he comes in and he tries to
[1:51:13] get me he said man we won this weekend
[1:51:15] and we won so big and we won this and we
[1:51:17] won this and he's constantly getting and
[1:51:19] I just tell him like I can't do what you
[1:51:21] do I I can't because I'm weak I can't do
[1:51:25] there there's something about being
[1:51:26] honest I can't do what you do because I
[1:51:29] am weak because the Bible says
[1:51:31] whatsoever you find to do do it with all
[1:51:33] your might if you're going to sing sing
[1:51:35] your best if you're going to preach
[1:51:36] preach your best if you're going to
[1:51:38] sleep sleep your
[1:51:39] best whatsoever you find to do do it
[1:51:41] with all your might so if I'm going to
[1:51:43] gamble I'm going to gamble and I tell my
[1:51:45] employees if you ever see me hang out
[1:51:47] with a guy you know this place is in
[1:51:51] trouble because the doesn't know
[1:51:53] moderation now he knows moderation as
[1:51:54] long as everything's good and the
[1:51:56] economy is good your marriage is good
[1:51:58] the kids don't but when they come back
[1:51:59] and say your child has cancer or hey you
[1:52:02] have this sickness you only got six
[1:52:03] months to live the devil takes what you
[1:52:05] thought was moderation and he takes it
[1:52:07] to the extreme can you say amen and the
[1:52:10] devil has a way of getting those little
[1:52:11] hooks in people then he pulls the the
[1:52:13] rug out from underneath them drops the
[1:52:15] floor out and then they hang their life
[1:52:17] is the old news and then they hang their
[1:52:19] life and and may God help us today to
[1:52:21] get us away from those things say I'm
[1:52:22] not going on the devil's territory sure
[1:52:25] I have a weakness but I'm coming to the
[1:52:26] house of the Lord when I'm weak then
[1:52:28] he's strong when I realize it's not me
[1:52:31] holding myself it's him that's holding
[1:52:33] me it's him that's helping me Amen in
[1:52:36] him we move and we live and we have our
[1:52:38] being in Jesus
[1:52:40] Christ oh if nothing else may we come
[1:52:42] today to realize our dependence on Jesus
[1:52:45] Christ Jesus said without me you can be
[1:52:47] do nothing and weiz oh I'm strong like
[1:52:49] I've got some talents and I'm an
[1:52:51] organized person I can do this and this
[1:52:52] but you don't realize that your whole
[1:52:54] makeup is made of a chemical balance
[1:52:56] they're saying one drop added to your
[1:52:59] thyroid gland makes you an idiot and
[1:53:02] then I realize Lord like I'm just a
[1:53:04] chemical balance and I'm held in your
[1:53:06] hand and that could all change tomorrow
[1:53:09] and we realize how weak we are how frail
[1:53:12] we
[1:53:13] are Lord I'm Nothing Without You Lord
[1:53:16] amen and Lord I know my weaknesses
[1:53:18] whatever it might be it might be
[1:53:19] condemnation and maybe something that's
[1:53:21] Way Way Back and you did back there
[1:53:23] maybe it even made it to the internet
[1:53:25] like they say I know something greater
[1:53:27] than the internet and it's the blood of
[1:53:29] Jesus Christ people do things on the
[1:53:31] internet they can't get it off they
[1:53:33] spend thousands and thousands of dollars
[1:53:34] try to scrub their personality and
[1:53:36] they've did things and people go back
[1:53:38] it's kind of like
[1:53:40] tattoos that right if I share some
[1:53:42] things with you I was on an airplane
[1:53:44] here not long back and I was sitting
[1:53:47] next to this it was it looked like a
[1:53:49] 14-year-old girl where you know how it
[1:53:50] is you're just like like this and you're
[1:53:52] all crammed in there and this looked
[1:53:54] like a 14-year-old girl sat down she's
[1:53:55] sitting there and and I noticed she had
[1:53:57] shorts and she had tattoos on her leg
[1:54:00] said brother Daniel where are you
[1:54:01] looking at this girl's leg hold on a
[1:54:03] minute let me get yourself right you
[1:54:05] know you got a prophet that rode on a
[1:54:07] bus one day and they told a joke he was
[1:54:08] sitting next to a person and thought it
[1:54:11] was a man and he slapped this woman on
[1:54:13] the
[1:54:14] leg prophet of God was dealing with
[1:54:16] transgenderism way back there and he got
[1:54:19] wrapped all up in it your Prophet sat on
[1:54:21] a bus slapped the woman on leg and said
[1:54:23] hey that's a good joke you told a good
[1:54:25] one and then later said hey Martha like
[1:54:28] oh my goodness I the prophet just
[1:54:29] slapped a woman on the leg so when
[1:54:32] people get their self-righteous stuff
[1:54:33] and all that just like hey wait a minute
[1:54:35] we're dealing with a crooked and
[1:54:37] perverse generation that we live in May
[1:54:40] the Lord help us today to man sometimes
[1:54:42] the devil he'll go out there and allow
[1:54:43] people to do things that'll get on
[1:54:45] social media whatever and like how can I
[1:54:46] get that off and the devil will hold
[1:54:47] that per listen to me he will paralyze
[1:54:50] them in condemnation and hold them and
[1:54:53] people have fake identities and things
[1:54:55] like that and they do things but there's
[1:54:56] something greater than the internet
[1:54:58] that's the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:55:00] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[1:55:02] all sin aren't you glad you know
[1:55:05] something more powerful than the
[1:55:06] internet amen it's it is powerful I can
[1:55:09] send a text now my friends in China can
[1:55:11] get the text in India or China it's an
[1:55:12] amazing tool but the blood of Jesus
[1:55:15] Christ amen will cleanse you from all
[1:55:17] sin and God can't even remember that you
[1:55:20] ever did it oh blessed be the the name
[1:55:22] of the Lord we need to stop letting the
[1:55:23] devil paralyze us amen we need to stop
[1:55:26] letting it using excuse say Lord I'm
[1:55:28] going to let the Holy Ghost fill me I'll
[1:55:30] be endued with power after that the Holy
[1:55:32] Ghost has come upon me this morning may
[1:55:34] the Holy Ghost come upon us and move
[1:55:36] from where we are closer to Jesus
[1:55:39] Christ it might be condemnation it might
[1:55:42] be lust it might be lying it might be
[1:55:45] your cell phone that paralyzes you all
[1:55:47] of a sudden for 3 hours you just sit
[1:55:50] there swiping
[1:55:52] up may the Lord help
[1:55:55] us the Lord help us brother R said this
[1:55:58] I think it's why Christ speak he said
[1:56:00] your faith will paralyze the glamour of
[1:56:02] the world or the glamour of the world
[1:56:05] will paralyze your faith right now just
[1:56:08] think about that this is why Christ
[1:56:09] speak you know I'm not here to take the
[1:56:11] glory of this thought I came from a
[1:56:12] message why Christ speak go back and
[1:56:14] listen to it brother Ram said your
[1:56:17] faith will paralyze the glamour of the
[1:56:20] world because so he does deny that
[1:56:22] there's glamor of the world remember the
[1:56:24] Bible says um people say well there's no
[1:56:25] pleasure in sin but that's not what the
[1:56:27] Bible says said Moses forsook the
[1:56:30] pleasure the the of because it was for a
[1:56:33] season refused to be called the the
[1:56:36] daughter of pharaoh and have a great
[1:56:37] position because he realized it was just
[1:56:39] for a season so there is a glamour of
[1:56:41] the world and the prophet of God said or
[1:56:42] the glamour of the world will paralyze
[1:56:44] your faith what is your faith it's a
[1:56:47] revelation what is Faith it's a divine
[1:56:49] revelation of the will of God for your
[1:56:51] life
[1:56:52] so you're sitting here today because of
[1:56:54] a revelation the Bible says faith a
[1:56:56] revelation is the victory that overcomes
[1:56:59] the world so whether you realize it or
[1:57:00] not God's revealed to you that this is
[1:57:02] God's word and the Bible says forsake
[1:57:04] not the assembling of yourselves
[1:57:06] together that much more as you see the
[1:57:07] day approaching so that's been to
[1:57:08] revealed to you so you got out of bed
[1:57:10] and came to church this morning so by
[1:57:13] your Revelation you're overcoming Cosmos
[1:57:15] the world order
[1:57:18] right sometimes we don't realize we're
[1:57:20] fulfilling scripture and there we are
[1:57:22] but the devil will come and try to
[1:57:23] paralyze your faith by the glamour of
[1:57:25] the world it's called is it fumo f m o
[1:57:30] fear of missing out fear of missing out
[1:57:33] and all of us see that somebody's like
[1:57:35] oh wow they're in involved in that I
[1:57:36] don't know how many social media there's
[1:57:38] all kinds of programs or whatever and
[1:57:39] they'll be like if I don't get on every
[1:57:41] one of them then I will not I'm just
[1:57:43] going to be this stuck in a hole
[1:57:45] somewhere I I have a little business and
[1:57:47] they came out about 10 years ago and
[1:57:49] said if you don't run blogs you're
[1:57:51] you'll just go into Extinction so I'm
[1:57:54] like okay okay well then I realized all
[1:57:57] and like as we navigate forward like no
[1:58:00] I don't need to have that as brother B
[1:58:02] said don't judge things by what they
[1:58:04] appear judge them by what they
[1:58:07] manifest judge them by what they
[1:58:09] manifest so they tell me on the social
[1:58:11] media said look you can't get on there
[1:58:13] and be preachy you can't be and then it
[1:58:15] goes back to what brother random said he
[1:58:16] went to the garage he's preaching to the
[1:58:18] men around there and the guy come like
[1:58:21] hey you're welcome here Bill Brandon but
[1:58:23] we don't want your Jesus and he makes
[1:58:25] this amazing
[1:58:27] Revelation he said where my Jesus is not
[1:58:30] welcome I am not welcome amen and if
[1:58:34] God's empowered me to be a witness for
[1:58:36] God wherever I can't be a witness for
[1:58:38] God I probably don't need to be there oh
[1:58:42] come on into the bar and just sit down
[1:58:43] and can we talk about Jesus no you can't
[1:58:45] sit at a bar and talk about Jesus you
[1:58:48] got no get out then I probably it's kind
[1:58:50] of like music you know you go into the
[1:58:52] store and they're singing what is this
[1:58:53] some of this Lauren Deo stuff they can
[1:58:55] play it in the store and they uh you
[1:58:57] know it's um I am or whatever that song
[1:58:59] it stayed at the top of the charts
[1:59:00] forever and I went back and listened to
[1:59:02] like people like well they're singing
[1:59:03] about God well I don't know about that
[1:59:04] you go it sounds more like a girl that
[1:59:06] went to college and she failed her math
[1:59:08] test and they're going to kick her out
[1:59:09] of school and she's calling her mom and
[1:59:10] saying you say I am great you say I
[1:59:12] should stay in college and you see how
[1:59:13] the devil likes to play Both Sides likes
[1:59:16] to play both sides but you think you
[1:59:17] could sing uh uh um at the cross at the
[1:59:22] cross in in and in Walmart or the bar no
[1:59:24] because there's something about there's
[1:59:26] something about black and white there's
[1:59:28] something about black and white I say
[1:59:29] it's time that we get more over on the
[1:59:31] white side and I'm not talking racial
[1:59:34] I'm talking about Good and Evil the word
[1:59:36] of God and and sin let's just you know
[1:59:37] you how the prophet of God said if
[1:59:39] there's a question just get away from it
[1:59:41] there's a question just get away from it
[1:59:43] so we see people trying to play Both
[1:59:44] Sides like Judas hey I'm with the church
[1:59:46] and I'm out with the world we see so
[1:59:48] many of those musicians even around the
[1:59:50] message we see it trying to Kip into the
[1:59:51] message is coming under the guys brother
[1:59:53] said I like soul I like those colored
[1:59:56] people they can really sing you know
[1:59:57] what he was talking about he was talking
[1:59:58] about those people out in the in in in
[2:00:00] the patches singing Acappella and Aunt
[2:00:03] jamama is singing a song He said nobody
[2:00:05] could even compare he wasn't talking
[2:00:06] about the rock and roll and all the Jazz
[2:00:08] and the dancing and moving around that
[2:00:10] trying to creep into our message using
[2:00:11] the word the message to justify it it's
[2:00:14] not he talked about the rock and roll
[2:00:16] and the boogly
[2:00:17] woly in fact you watch this he saw the
[2:00:20] Church of of of America dancing to what
[2:00:24] kind of music rock rock and roll music
[2:00:26] you go back and look we my wife and I we
[2:00:28] went to the country the other day and
[2:00:29] all the little churches that are closed
[2:00:31] down and then you see the mega churches
[2:00:33] and they just can't get enough I was
[2:00:34] just like it just like and then you
[2:00:36] realize what do they have they have rock
[2:00:38] and roll music and rock and roll music
[2:00:40] so if you're the Methodist or that it's
[2:00:42] not going to work because the prophet of
[2:00:44] God it's a prophecy being fulfilled and
[2:00:47] say Lord they can take that whatever we
[2:00:48] don't want that rock and roll but boy we
[2:00:50] want the Holy Ghost and we want the
[2:00:51] inspir ation of the Holy Ghost now I
[2:00:53] believe in amen genres of music you know
[2:00:55] they they sang uh you know the the the
[2:00:57] the the hymns and I appreciate the hymns
[2:00:59] and brother Brandon was a Baptist is
[2:01:00] this okay you can get up behind me and
[2:01:02] correct if I'm wrong on Tuesday all
[2:01:04] right but brother B said they were
[2:01:05] teaching me that new song one of them if
[2:01:08] you're a Baptist you can't sing that
[2:01:10] because you believe if you raise your
[2:01:12] hand say accept Christ as my savior you
[2:01:13] believe you got the Holy Ghost that's
[2:01:14] what Baptists believe now they're
[2:01:16] singing I'm one of them they were
[2:01:17] gathered in the upper room the Holy
[2:01:19] Ghost fell upon them that's a
[2:01:20] Pentecostal song and the prophet of God
[2:01:22] is moving from a Baptist to a
[2:01:24] Pentecostal receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] there is power power wonderful working
[2:01:28] Power in the Blood of the lamb and the
[2:01:29] Holy Ghost now he is moving from one air
[2:01:32] to another
[2:01:34] air oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:01:36] we move from Pentecost to the word of
[2:01:37] God there should be a whole another
[2:01:39] genre of music coming I've been putting
[2:01:42] a lot of pressure on my son said hey son
[2:01:44] we don't need to deal with all this
[2:01:45] world stuff let's get back to amen
[2:01:47] there's power amen there's power in the
[2:01:50] name of Jesus Amen
[2:01:52] I heard from my theophany amen it wasn't
[2:01:54] that sister Lily's mother-in-law that
[2:01:57] wrote that song I my my my theophany I
[2:02:00] hear it hear it calling me sister Lily I
[2:02:01] think it was her mother-in-law sitting
[2:02:02] in a I think she was sitting on an
[2:02:04] assembly line she reached up and got a
[2:02:05] piece of paper and wrote it down I hear
[2:02:07] my the offy calling me and she got
[2:02:09] cancer and 5 years later God took her
[2:02:10] home but that inspiration was coming
[2:02:12] it's coming to a bride something keeps
[2:02:15] holding me and it's not me it's a
[2:02:17] predestinated seed I believe my name was
[2:02:19] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[2:02:21] foundation the world does that mean
[2:02:23] those people are perfect no but they
[2:02:25] realize their weaknesses and they go to
[2:02:27] Jesus Christ just like Moses
[2:02:29] did amen I just just quickly yall don't
[2:02:32] have clocks in
[2:02:33] here Lord help us we don't have time to
[2:02:37] go through it exactly but remember lot
[2:02:39] remember lot and Abraham they came to
[2:02:41] together there and it's an amazing
[2:02:43] scripture we don't have time for it this
[2:02:44] morning the Bible says that lot pitched
[2:02:46] his tent towards Sodom when he got up in
[2:02:49] the morning he opened it up and there
[2:02:50] was Sodom and that's what he saw may God
[2:02:53] help us today to not Pitch our tent
[2:02:55] towards Sodom and the things of the
[2:02:57] world and the movie stars and the music
[2:02:58] and what they call is is great the Bible
[2:03:01] says was the Corinthians there what man
[2:03:02] calls great God calls foolish what God
[2:03:05] calls great man calls foolish they take
[2:03:08] a woman a mother that's trying to raise
[2:03:10] her children try to stay keep a marriage
[2:03:12] together the Bible says marriage is
[2:03:14] Honorable the Bible says a a meek and
[2:03:15] quiet spirit is of great price in the
[2:03:17] sight of God and the world looks at it
[2:03:19] and say that's nothing that's just that
[2:03:22] worthless it has no value we need to
[2:03:24] come to the house of the Lord say Lord
[2:03:25] cleanse my mind let me be Washed by the
[2:03:28] Water of the word wash my mind of what
[2:03:31] this this world is saying that a woman
[2:03:33] should be or what a man should be should
[2:03:35] just be a puppet walking there talking
[2:03:36] about all the movies and people get
[2:03:37] involved in the movies and realize how
[2:03:39] they've demeaned the man to just be a
[2:03:40] little puppet that follows the lady
[2:03:42] around along the he goes out and works
[2:03:44] and brings home the paycheck so she can
[2:03:45] do whatever she wants to do to where a
[2:03:47] man rises up and becomes the head of the
[2:03:49] house creates a vision not a format but
[2:03:52] he creates a vision I was made in the
[2:03:54] image of God and that we got married
[2:03:56] because you loved my character maybe
[2:03:58] nobody sat down and talked to you about
[2:04:00] that we got married because you thought
[2:04:01] I was a Son of God and you married me
[2:04:03] and then you saw that character was so
[2:04:05] great that you said I want to produce
[2:04:07] more of that character on the earth and
[2:04:08] we had
[2:04:10] children you see if we get back and put
[2:04:12] marriage back the way it ought to be
[2:04:15] more couples realize that's the man of
[2:04:17] God we get married he'll be the head of
[2:04:18] the house and you'll be his helper and
[2:04:20] we'll love honor and cherish as long as
[2:04:22] we live and this is such a great thing
[2:04:23] we're going to produce more children to
[2:04:25] repopulate the Earth may God help us
[2:04:28] somebody broke marriage but it wasn't
[2:04:30] God wasn't a Christian it was the devil
[2:04:33] it was the devil say oh I'm so hurt it
[2:04:35] was the devil that caus that hurt we
[2:04:36] need to put the blame back where it was
[2:04:38] it was the devil somebody got away from
[2:04:40] Jesus Christ somebody got away from
[2:04:42] church are you with me somebody got away
[2:04:45] from the Holy Ghost and that's what's
[2:04:46] caused all those things it wasn't Christ
[2:04:49] God didn't cause the pain God didn't
[2:04:51] caus of suffering it was sin we need to
[2:04:54] call it for what it is God is the one
[2:04:55] always trying to draw us back Adam Adam
[2:04:58] where are the prodal the father running
[2:05:00] to the son I'm here to redeem you to
[2:05:02] bring you back to bring you back to
[2:05:04] fellowship with the father oh there's
[2:05:07] hurts there's pain that prodal had spent
[2:05:09] his reputation he had spent his so there
[2:05:12] was ramifications but he was back in
[2:05:14] fellowship with the father oh amen lot
[2:05:18] pitched his tent towards Sodom he went
[2:05:19] down there and the glamour of Sodom
[2:05:22] paralyzed his faith but there was a man
[2:05:24] called Abraham and he realized what was
[2:05:26] going to go happen down there and he
[2:05:28] didn't let it paralyze his Revelation he
[2:05:30] just he was kind of sequestered he was
[2:05:32] not in the mainstream of life he was
[2:05:33] kind of off somewhere amen but Sodom
[2:05:36] burn and sodom's going to
[2:05:37] burn amen I was thinking about Moses how
[2:05:40] the Bible says he saw him who was
[2:05:42] invisible so brother Ram takes that and
[2:05:44] why Christ speak and he Compares lot and
[2:05:47] he takes Abraham and he Compares Abraham
[2:05:49] who had all the glamour of the world but
[2:05:51] by Revel the Bible says he saw is can we
[2:05:54] let me just jump over there Hebrews chap
[2:05:55] 11 this is so powerful Hebrews chap 11
[2:05:58] it says by Faith by Revelation
[2:06:01] Moses when he was come to years refused
[2:06:04] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[2:06:05] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[2:06:07] Affliction so don't think you're not
[2:06:09] going to suffer you're going to suffer
[2:06:11] we're all suffering man we could all be
[2:06:13] doing great things today and out in the
[2:06:15] world and doing things and have more
[2:06:17] money because hey six days shall all
[2:06:18] labor but what if you work seven days
[2:06:20] you can make a lot more money
[2:06:22] right oh but that's how what the devil
[2:06:24] says but that's not the way there's a
[2:06:26] day of rest that God sets it in there
[2:06:28] there's something more than money coming
[2:06:30] together and talking about our spiritual
[2:06:31] well-being so you had to see something
[2:06:33] right here he refused to be called the
[2:06:35] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing to
[2:06:37] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[2:06:39] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[2:06:41] season there it is the pleasures of sin
[2:06:43] but it's only for a
[2:06:45] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[2:06:47] greater riches than the treasures of
[2:06:49] Egypt for he had respect into the
[2:06:51] recompense of the reward by Faith by
[2:06:53] Revelation he forsook Egypt that's what
[2:06:56] that's what the prophet of God saying
[2:06:57] your revelation will paralyze the world
[2:07:00] or the world will paralyze you and
[2:07:02] you'll live in the pleasures of the
[2:07:04] world but you your faith will just
[2:07:06] diminish and die but I don't I want to
[2:07:07] be wise today I want to be a wise man he
[2:07:11] goes on to how Jesus say he that Hearth
[2:07:12] these things of mine and does them he's
[2:07:14] a wise man he that hears these things of
[2:07:16] mine and does him not he's a foolish
[2:07:19] man he goes on he forsook Egypt not
[2:07:21] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[2:07:23] endured seeing him who was invisible
[2:07:26] amen he was seeing something the Bible
[2:07:27] says young men will have a vision we
[2:07:29] young men we need to have a vision like
[2:07:31] hey I want a vision of a 100 years from
[2:07:33] now not 20 years from a 100 years from
[2:07:36] now we're all going to be somewhere and
[2:07:38] your Revelation today will decide what
[2:07:41] you do in your life like I'm going to
[2:07:43] keep going to church I'm going to keep
[2:07:45] loving the Lord I'm going to stay in
[2:07:46] this marriage I'm going to keep my heart
[2:07:48] in tune and refreshed and renewed and in
[2:07:50] the Holy Ghost and I'm going to come and
[2:07:51] when I do wrong I'm going to ask God to
[2:07:53] repent I'm going to repent ask God to
[2:07:54] forgive me I'm going to go on with God
[2:07:56] I'm not going to let this situation
[2:07:57] paralyze me I'm not going to sit along
[2:08:00] the the road of how many people we see
[2:08:03] maybe even around here you knew people
[2:08:04] years ago serve the Lord but they're
[2:08:05] just sitting along the road somewhere
[2:08:07] that flat tire anybody ever have a flat
[2:08:10] tire has all of us had a flat tire you
[2:08:12] had a and you sit along the road I'm not
[2:08:14] going to let the flat tire paralyzed me
[2:08:17] for my whole life I'm not going to
[2:08:19] paralyze uh you know I got a spare in
[2:08:22] the back and I'm big about spares I I
[2:08:24] don't go any there I got to have a spare
[2:08:26] I just brother Daniel it's just part of
[2:08:28] it but my one our audio guys text today

[2:08:34] or my tire is fight I'm changing the
[2:08:35] tire I text him right back you need us
[2:08:37] to come help you I'm a long ways away
[2:08:39] but I'm going to find the resources that
[2:08:41] I need to go get that brother and get
[2:08:43] him to church and if I would do that as
[2:08:45] a brother what would our heavenly father
[2:08:47] do when you say hey I I've got a flat
[2:08:50] tire I'm paralyzed along the road if I
[2:08:52] would do that as a brother what would
[2:08:54] our heavenly father do you need some
[2:08:56] resources I'll send a brother over there
[2:08:58] in prayer I'll send a sister over there
[2:08:59] you'll get a text in just a couple of
[2:09:01] minutes as our brother was going through
[2:09:03] something in his life and he God dealing
[2:09:05] on both God deals on both ends and
[2:09:07] something happened brother R Sean said
[2:09:09] I'm feeling this way and in the same day
[2:09:11] he gets a text and God begins to move
[2:09:13] something in a dick in in a certain
[2:09:16] direction this is bigger than you and me
[2:09:19] God knows what he's doing
[2:09:21] as brother bam said the wheels are
[2:09:23] turning right just right just get in the
[2:09:24] turn maybe you're paralyzed today and
[2:09:27] God says look you need to amen you need
[2:09:29] to get this change right here but I'm
[2:09:30] sending the Holy Ghost I'm sending a
[2:09:32] minister that doesn't even know and God
[2:09:34] is orchestrating all of this and he's
[2:09:36] going to change the situation he's going
[2:09:38] to heal your memory he's going to heal
[2:09:39] your reasoning well I thought it should
[2:09:41] have gone this way by golly I'm just
[2:09:44] like and we act like five-year-olds like
[2:09:47] hey Lord not this is your problem this
[2:09:50] is your problem a sister called me the
[2:09:52] other day it was a situation going back
[2:09:53] home and and we're back and forth she's
[2:09:55] like what do I do what I I said sister
[2:09:57] this is a man problem you just need to
[2:10:00] turn your phone off and let men handle
[2:10:02] this and I got on the phone and we
[2:10:04] started doing the man thing right the
[2:10:06] man is the protector and somewhere you
[2:10:08] sisters say hey this is a man thing this
[2:10:10] is a deacon thing this is let the pastor
[2:10:13] handle that this I'm going to stay in my
[2:10:15] Lane let the pastor be the pastor we get
[2:10:17] computers in the and the and we want to
[2:10:18] start sending quotes back and forth but
[2:10:20] the pastor he's got all those quotes too
[2:10:23] he can do that and he's praying and
[2:10:25] seeking God like you need to whip Johnny
[2:10:27] yeah I know I need to whip Johnny and
[2:10:28] I'll Whip Johnny at the right time when
[2:10:29] the Holy Spirit when it's all
[2:10:32] right when you need to go tell your wife
[2:10:34] man we're down in the Weeds now remember
[2:10:36] brother brother Ram's wife she slams the
[2:10:38] door he goes out washes the
[2:10:41] car Angel lord said you go tell her to
[2:10:43] read about maram he goes back in knocks
[2:10:46] on the door I've got and he said he just
[2:10:49] went back out and he had learned even
[2:10:51] though he had the word of the Lord there
[2:10:52] was a time and a place that the word of
[2:10:55] the Lord was spoken in the right way may
[2:10:58] the Lord help us today to pray to pray
[2:11:02] let's talk about a couple things 1
[2:11:05] Corinthians chapter 10 let me just when
[2:11:07] the Deacon stands up in the back does
[2:11:09] that mean I'm supposed to
[2:11:11] close is it is that what that means all
[2:11:13] right let me just read a couple more
[2:11:15] verses I don't know he stood up back
[2:11:17] there so I don't let me read this ver
[2:11:21] all
[2:11:22] right 1 Corinthians 10:13 but there is
[2:11:26] no temptation taken you but such is
[2:11:28] common to man that's where the Devil
[2:11:30] comes and says you're the exception you
[2:11:32] have a chemical imbalance so therefore
[2:11:33] you can justify doing this you are not
[2:11:35] normal this is and the devil will but
[2:11:38] the Bible says that there's no
[2:11:39] temptation but it's common to man people
[2:11:42] have went through this before Satan
[2:11:44] studied human nature for 6,000 years or
[2:11:47] 7 billion people I hate to tell you that
[2:11:49] but you're not unique
[2:11:52] in that way Temptation the devil's
[2:11:53] studying now we are unique in the way
[2:11:55] God's working us and molding us stay
[2:11:57] with me right here so he says there but
[2:11:59] he's common to man but God is faithful
[2:12:01] who will not suffer you to be attempted
[2:12:03] above that you're able aren't you
[2:12:05] thankful for that verse like really God
[2:12:08] really really
[2:12:10] really and then that verse says he's
[2:12:12] never going to sink you your trouble
[2:12:15] test didn't come to destroy you they
[2:12:17] came to make you
[2:12:18] stronger I'll say it again your trials
[2:12:21] didn't come to destroy you they came to
[2:12:22] make you
[2:12:24] stronger some of your boys they lift
[2:12:26] weights here they have what they call
[2:12:28] you um lift to failure and so you do
[2:12:30] your reps and you can just do a bunch of
[2:12:32] reps you're just wearing your muscles
[2:12:33] down but really you're building your
[2:12:35] muscle is when you're just are straining
[2:12:37] and that's what God is trying to do us
[2:12:39] to find that place and he said I'm never
[2:12:41] going to put more on you than you're
[2:12:42] able to bear I'm so thankful for that
[2:12:44] verse said Lord you must have a lot of
[2:12:47] confidence in me because I do not know
[2:12:49] how I can you ever get to that place
[2:12:50] like Lord I don't know how I'm going to
[2:12:53] get through this and God loves to create
[2:12:55] situations that are bigger than you that
[2:12:57] you can't figure out so that he can
[2:12:59] prove that he's God that he's the
[2:13:01] Creator you say the doctors say this and
[2:13:03] this is a but he's the creator that
[2:13:05] created your body and he wants to show
[2:13:08] that he's God and I'm the Healer of all
[2:13:10] of your sick well the doctor healed me
[2:13:11] and God wants to do away with that when
[2:13:12] the doctor says there's no more hope
[2:13:14] than God said I'm the god that heals
[2:13:15] your sicknesses I'm the god that does
[2:13:17] your and it might be your memory
[2:13:18] infection brother Daniel I've got this
[2:13:20] memory and it just totally paralyzes me
[2:13:22] I've got this reasoning and this should
[2:13:24] have happened in the church and that
[2:13:25] should have happened years ago and I am
[2:13:26] right and then God wants to heal that
[2:13:28] and say yeah but I'll fix that but maybe
[2:13:31] not just right
[2:13:32] now we had a situation in our church I
[2:13:34] don't know why I'm saying this it just
[2:13:35] came up there was a problem in the
[2:13:37] church and there's a brother there and I
[2:13:38] think I was a deacon or I was a minister
[2:13:40] and he come to me and and and he left
[2:13:42] the church and then two weeks the whole
[2:13:44] problem was fixed I'm like brother if
[2:13:46] you just stuck around first you were
[2:13:48] right and I was wrong or the church was
[2:13:50] wrong you could have helped us you could
[2:13:53] have helped us if you if you got if you
[2:13:55] got something that'll help me maybe
[2:13:56] maybe you know something that'll help me
[2:13:58] not get to close those Edge you're like
[2:13:59] Hey Brother Daniel if you'll just uh put
[2:14:01] wear a parachute all the time like hey
[2:14:02] that's a good idea if I jump off there I
[2:14:04] can pull the parachute and go to maybe
[2:14:06] you got something but if you don't come
[2:14:07] help me how are we going to you know
[2:14:09] there's strength being together amen the
[2:14:11] devil wants to separate us but we stay
[2:14:13] together and you help me and you pray
[2:14:15] for me and as the one brother said I got
[2:14:17] I think it was brother um Homer longor
[2:14:19] he said he got a kidney stone like are
[2:14:20] you believing for God he said I'm not
[2:14:22] believing for anything I need something
[2:14:23] to take away this
[2:14:24] pain
[2:14:27] yeah oh that's carnal man thing well you
[2:14:30] what about having a baby like my wife
[2:14:33] said she having a baby and some the
[2:14:34] brother like pray with her like I'm
[2:14:36] watch that monitor right there I don't
[2:14:37] know if you all pray between those
[2:14:40] things you're going through something
[2:14:42] you need somebody else to pray amen
[2:14:45] that's why the Bible says lay hands on
[2:14:46] the sick because maybe you get to the
[2:14:47] place I don't have any more faith I'm
[2:14:49] paralyzed I'm paralyzed but I think
[2:14:51] brother BR went through that in his
[2:14:52] ministry he said he just sat on the
[2:14:53] porch and then was it FF Bosworth send
[2:14:55] him that little thing of faith and it
[2:14:57] and it shook him out of that thing and
[2:14:59] maybe the holy spirit will shake us out
[2:15:01] of wherever that is with our flat tire
[2:15:02] you feel like you know what my life my
[2:15:04] spiritual life isn't doing anything I'm
[2:15:05] just sitting along the road and
[2:15:06] everybody's shouting and going on
[2:15:08] serving God but that's okay the holy
[2:15:09] spirit is coming by this morning to heal
[2:15:12] us of all of our diseases of all of our
[2:15:15] sicknesses whether it's in your flesh or
[2:15:17] it's in your conscience in that Spirit
[2:15:18] realm say Lord fix me today Lord Heal me
[2:15:21] today Lord You're My Healer you promis
[2:15:24] to be my healer heal me today Lord let
[2:15:26] my faith paralyze this world Lord
[2:15:29] blessed be the name of the Lord so we
[2:15:31] know that no nothing that we can't I
[2:15:33] like this part but but will with the
[2:15:35] Temptation make a way to escape that you
[2:15:38] may be able to Bear if you look at go
[2:15:40] back in that study that word make a way
[2:15:42] of Escape it's actually create God will
[2:15:44] create a away Moses had no precedent
[2:15:47] brother Sean when he got to the Red Sea
[2:15:49] and two mountains amen Red Sea they they
[2:15:51] just camp out like hey this is really
[2:15:52] we'll just fit but now we got an army
[2:15:55] Pharaoh's the greatest army of the world

[2:15:59] crying to God like I can't do this I say
[2:16:01] there's no there's no um there's no uh
[2:16:06] problem is saying I I can't do this
[2:16:09] there's actually as a minister we it's
[2:16:11] funny as ministers sometimes like hey

[2:17:06] can help you when they can lay hands on
[2:17:08] you and cast out
[2:17:10] Devils I believe in casting out devils
[2:17:13] and man we come you know we maybe we've
[2:17:15] been raised in the message I have all my
[2:17:17] life so I don't know I went to a camp
[2:17:18] one time brother Sean they said we don't
[2:17:19] want you to preach doc we just want you
[2:17:20] to preach about Jesus I'm like okay I'm
[2:17:22] sorry I was raised in the message I
[2:17:24] don't know what Doctrine is and what
[2:17:26] just Jesus is it's all the same it
[2:17:27] revealed Christ to me right so if you're
[2:17:30] going to ask me preaching on
[2:17:31] predestination or there's no eternal
[2:17:32] hell or infilling of the holy spirit is
[2:17:34] not just an emotion it's the Life of
[2:17:36] Christ and where is that Doctrine and
[2:17:38] where it's all one and the same it's
[2:17:39] Jesus it's the word of God made flesh
[2:17:42] today blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:17:45] let me get back on track here so God
[2:17:46] Will Make A Way the Red Sea he made a
[2:17:49] way no scripture for it brother Sean no
[2:17:51] scripture and God Made A Way amen that
[2:17:55] little woman there when she didn't have
[2:17:57] any more meal and this and there was she
[2:17:59] said I'm going to die and God was asking
[2:18:02] for something out of his life and she
[2:18:04] said I can't do this I can't give the
[2:18:06] message of the hour that he said that's
[2:18:09] okay put God first you'll never go
[2:18:11] hungry amen amen God Will Supply your
[2:18:14] needs through the famine God will take
[2:18:16] care of you David said I was once young
[2:18:19] now I'm old I've never seen the
[2:18:20] righteous is forsaking bread amen just
[2:18:23] think about this give me a minute let's
[2:18:25] go through a couple people Noah he was a
[2:18:27] farmer but God needed a tool yeah to be
[2:18:30] a boat Manu manufacturer to make a boat
[2:18:33] and God made a
[2:18:35] tool listen to me because we're living
[2:18:37] in lady sea and God needs somebody to be
[2:18:39] a witness and there's nobody there so
[2:18:41] he's making a
[2:18:43] witness he needed something done in
[2:18:45] Noah's day he got a man who was not
[2:18:48] qualified and made him the tool to
[2:18:50] fulfill God's will will Gideon the guy
[2:18:54] was hiding the angel comes to empower
[2:18:55] him he's hiding behind the wine press
[2:18:56] like hey Gideon you're a mighty man of
[2:18:58] all and he's like somebody else here
[2:19:00] what me me like I'm hiding I'm hiding no
[2:19:04] you're a mighty man of Val God's looking
[2:19:06] at his potential and then God takes this
[2:19:08] man with 300 men and destroys all of the
[2:19:11] uh the midianites that are out there
[2:19:13] with a little uh picture and they they
[2:19:14] just went and they f are you with me
[2:19:16] today God made the tool sure he did
[2:19:20] Elijah here's a man he's out there and
[2:19:22] you know he's fearless and he's bold and
[2:19:24] calling fire out of heaven and such a
[2:19:25] man and then a woman com and said hey
[2:19:27] I'm going to destroy you by this time
[2:19:28] tomorrow you're going to be like the 400
[2:19:30] priest and he runs and he hides and he's
[2:19:31] in a cave and he's hiding down there and
[2:19:33] hiding in the cave for was it 40 days
[2:19:35] and he got some Mana that sustain him
[2:19:36] and you see how God is making that tool
[2:19:39] making that man the way he ought to
[2:19:42] be now the devil give you misconceptions
[2:19:45] like hey you're always going to be
[2:19:47] perfect or you'll never have a suicide
[2:19:49] thought well that wasn't job I think job
[2:19:52] said he cursed the day he was
[2:19:54] born and Elijah the same way went
[2:19:58] through that dark time depression you
[2:20:00] see what the devil does he tries to go
[2:20:02] to the doctor and get this and and give
[2:20:04] it give it a little but actually it was
[2:20:07] something he was going listen to me he
[2:20:08] was going through something in his life
[2:20:10] that God wanted to have a deeper
[2:20:12] relationship with him in the depression
[2:20:15] that he was in amen I don't doubt the
[2:20:17] depression is real the prophet of God
[2:20:19] lost his wife and lost baby and went
[2:20:21] through a very dark time but out of that
[2:20:23] dark time it birthed a great inspiration
[2:20:25] to the world in fact when his baby's
[2:20:27] eyes crossed brother Ram says that that
[2:20:28] not one baby that came across the
[2:20:30] platform ever went across with crossed
[2:20:33] eyes because there was such a compassion
[2:20:35] listen to me it was such a compassion
[2:20:37] welded in that man by the pits of his
[2:20:40] weakness God made something great to
[2:20:42] show the strength of God to the world
[2:20:45] and you might have a weakness but it
[2:20:46] might be that weakness that causes you
[2:20:48] to be humble and say Lord I can't do
[2:20:49] this without you
[2:20:51] Lord I cannot stay in this marriage and
[2:20:52] be the right kind of a wife if you don't
[2:20:54] help me and then God comes and empowers
[2:20:57] you and then it becomes a beautiful
[2:20:59] thing that you fulfilled that scripture
[2:21:00] marriage is Honorable you realize I
[2:21:03] couldn't make marriage honorable it was
[2:21:05] God in Me that made marriage honorable
[2:21:08] blessed be the name of the Lord is this
[2:21:11] okay I was thinking about my father
[2:21:14] brother brandham came and was the voice
[2:21:17] you believe that Revelation 10:7 but in
[2:21:19] the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:21:20] angel that's why we don't have a lot of
[2:21:22] videos the Bible say it was the days of
[2:21:24] the voice they had the cameras and I
[2:21:26] don't know if you know the history
[2:21:26] brother Perry green went to Australia
[2:21:28] and found the video deep call The Depot
[2:21:30] and and those um films uh and he said
[2:21:34] hey can I take those America came back
[2:21:36] and duplicated made a copy of them
[2:21:38] basically stole them and gave them back
[2:21:39] theirs and now we have the film but it
[2:21:41] was a scripture in the days of the voice
[2:21:44] because brother Sean if we had had that
[2:21:45] there's something about video that you
[2:21:47] would like hold your finger like this
[2:21:49] tip your hat carry your Bible a certain
[2:21:51] way and we'd all become mimics but now
[2:21:53] we don't have people that are mimics
[2:21:54] ministers that are mimic of William
[2:21:56] bram's actions but we have a voice a
[2:21:59] message and a people are mimics of the
[2:22:01] revelation of the word of God isn't that
[2:22:04] good in the days of the voice it's
[2:22:06] fanatic there's a voice in the days of
[2:22:08] the voice when he shall begin to sound
[2:22:09] so brother brandom he brought the
[2:22:11] message and my father had a Ministry of
[2:22:13] transcribing it from the voice to text
[2:22:16] so he spent 35 years at the voice of God
[2:22:18] the spoken word together with brother
[2:22:20] Roy borders and and making the the the
[2:22:23] text and then after people stopped using
[2:22:26] the books they took that text scanned it
[2:22:28] and put it into the table app if you use
[2:22:30] the table app it was my father for 35
[2:22:32] years amen was meticulously going
[2:22:35] through that and and and making the text
[2:22:37] that now so many people all around the
[2:22:39] world are are using it's a blessing to
[2:22:41] me I it's a blessing you know brother
[2:22:44] Joseph brandham if he came through that
[2:22:45] door and brother brandham dedicated him
[2:22:47] in the message I think it's enticing
[2:22:48] Spirits he uses the word blessing five
[2:22:50] times let him be a blessing and if he
[2:22:52] walked through the door I'd say God
[2:22:53] bless you Brother Joseph your life has
[2:22:55] been a blessing to the bride of Christ
[2:22:57] all around the world so my father had a
[2:23:00] when he was 16 years old have I told
[2:23:02] this will you give me just a few more
[2:23:03] minutes I'm showing you how God made a
[2:23:06] tool he was SE 16 years old he was at a
[2:23:09] in rais Pentecostal he was going into
[2:23:10] the bathroom one day at a
[2:23:12] convention I know I'm talking real fast
[2:23:14] but I'm trying
[2:23:15] to so a man comes out and he prophesies
[2:23:19] and says you'll have a Ministry they go
[2:23:20] to Every Hamlet and Village of the world
[2:23:23] and it's kind of like David being
[2:23:25] anointing like okay I don't know what
[2:23:26] that means I'll go back so my father
[2:23:28] just went back about his life and it
[2:23:29] wasn't until almost he retired brother
[2:23:31] Shawn that he realized that that was
[2:23:33] brother random was the voice and he was
[2:23:35] the text to Brother Rands transcribing
[2:23:37] it from the voice to text and his
[2:23:39] message was going to every Hamlet and
[2:23:41] Village of the world and God used him
[2:23:44] but God created it a tool so if you ever
[2:23:47] met my father he's very like
[2:23:51] everything's by the book right it has to
[2:23:53] be right and so a little bit when you're
[2:23:56] with him in his personality that's just
[2:23:58] the way he was and it was a little bit
[2:24:00] hard because we're human and not
[2:24:01] everything's perfect but he had to be
[2:24:03] like everything your tees are crossed
[2:24:06] your eyes are dotted because let me just
[2:24:08] say this I was thinking about this
[2:24:09] example if you
[2:24:11] said uh let's eat
[2:24:14] John okay if you put a comma let's eat
[2:24:16] comma John but if you say let's eat John
[2:24:19] you're going to consume John so
[2:24:22] punctuation does become very important
[2:24:24] right let's eat John yeah hey there's a
[2:24:26] guy named John we're all going to eat
[2:24:27] but you take the com out let's eat John
[2:24:30] let's eat him yeah and then you put an
[2:24:31] exclamation at the end let's eat John
[2:24:35] and so you find out that that
[2:24:36] punctuation changes y'all are laughing I
[2:24:38] got you right there so then my father
[2:24:40] was so meticulous because you change one
[2:24:43] little thing and the I think there's one
[2:24:44] of the message unveiling of God brother
[2:24:46] Ram said that Prophet comes down and
[2:24:47] Right Moves right into the and brother
[2:24:50] Ram says phase and people brother R says
[2:24:53] phrase and it was phase and these
[2:24:55] brothers are debating back and forth if
[2:24:57] because if he moved into a phrase or if
[2:25:00] he's the phase that the prophet is the
[2:25:02] phase he is actually then we'd worship
[2:25:04] the prophet so every one of those
[2:25:06] punctuations and words became very
[2:25:08] important that we study on our table app
[2:25:10] people changing their lives and brother
[2:25:12] B's talking about the length of the
[2:25:13] skirt or can I dye my hair and those
[2:25:15] things only become important when they
[2:25:17] become important so every word became
[2:25:20] and so God created a tool amen for that
[2:25:24] specific job now God's created you for a
[2:25:27] job he's created you for a job there's
[2:25:30] some of these men that are so
[2:25:32] broken that it takes a lifetime to fix
[2:25:35] them say we've been married 20 years and
[2:25:37] he's still not right well hang with hang
[2:25:39] with him hang with him keep working on
[2:25:41] him maybe 30 years you'll get some of
[2:25:43] those things worked out Moses like I
[2:25:45] can't he got to the place he wasn't and
[2:25:46] know it all oh it's so hilarious to
[2:25:48] watch God he'll take extreme a woman
[2:25:50] that's over here and a man over here
[2:25:51] he'll just tie them right together and
[2:25:53] it's just like no it's until death do we
[2:25:55] part so yeah somewhere we got to figure
[2:25:57] this out and by the way we got kids so
[2:25:59] we really got to figure this out
[2:26:01] somebody came the other day we're
[2:26:02] sitting in the office I hope this is
[2:26:03] okay they're sitting like hey there's
[2:26:05] nobody that can love your kids like you
[2:26:07] all I can't love them like you all I can
[2:26:09] try to provide for them but I can't love
[2:26:10] them like you and tuck them in bed and
[2:26:12] feel their head if they're so there's no
[2:26:13] better tool to be a parent than
[2:26:16] you than you and so we see a society
[2:26:20] where marriage is falling down and God
[2:26:21] in Sunday school now it's all falling
[2:26:22] down so they have a whole foster care uh
[2:26:25] thing to pick up the pieces of something
[2:26:27] that that the devil not God the devil
[2:26:29] came in and just can you see that I I I
[2:26:32] believe in the foster care of friends
[2:26:33] that that work on that and I'm all for
[2:26:35] that but when you see hey you're dealing
[2:26:36] with the symptom the cause is somewhere
[2:26:38] we let Christ go out of our society we
[2:26:41] let God go out of and sometimes we as
[2:26:43] parent grandparents say like hey I made
[2:26:45] mistakes with my children but I'm going
[2:26:46] to pick it back up in my grandchildren
[2:26:48] and be the best grandparent I can be
[2:26:51] there there's something about I think I
[2:26:53] said this when I was here last time
[2:26:54] there's something about being a grandp
[2:26:56] there's an age I don't know where it is
[2:26:57] it's like 60 70 80 where you can say
[2:27:00] anything and people just got to deal
[2:27:02] with it I told this when I think was
[2:27:05] here and I got on that airplane that
[2:27:06] lady said Merry Christmas to everybody
[2:27:09] and I'm too old to care if I offend
[2:27:11] anybody on this
[2:27:13] airplane so there's just something about
[2:27:15] when you're an older grandfather
[2:27:16] grandmother praise God Jesus Christ is
[2:27:18] the Son of God that came into the world
[2:27:20] to die for our sins and this home is a
[2:27:22] Christian home and if you don't like it
[2:27:24] you don't have to eat turkey dinner with
[2:27:25] us but we're going to pray and thank God
[2:27:27] for his
[2:27:28] blessings there's just something in
[2:27:30] there like okay that's just Grandma yeah
[2:27:32] that's just Grandma but she's preaching
[2:27:33] the Gospel of Jesus Christ God has made
[2:27:36] you as the best grandma to your family
[2:27:38] that anybody else could ever be I say
[2:27:39] God Empower me well I made mistakes
[2:27:41] we've all made mistakes but Lord let my
[2:27:43] weakness not let it not paralyze me Let
[2:27:46] It energize me Lord let the Holy Ghost
[2:27:48] come today and energize me in my
[2:27:50] weakness Lord may your strength and your
[2:27:52] gospel be propelled in the world blessed
[2:27:55] be the name of the Lord I didn't have
[2:27:56] all the time to get all the quotes
[2:27:58] together but brother Ram said that every
[2:28:00] person is like a bell yeah and he said
[2:28:02] it has a certain Ting you probably I'm
[2:28:04] sure your pastors read the quote I'm
[2:28:05] trying to find a little pen here so if I
[2:28:08] have a little this glass if I Ting this
[2:28:15] listen so that has a Ting that has a
[2:28:18] Ting this has a ting
[2:28:22] and it has a different ring to it
[2:28:24] doesn't it if I hit it on here it's a
[2:28:25] different
[2:28:26] ring but brother brandom said that God
[2:28:28] bred this one to this one and this one
[2:28:31] to this one and this one to this one to
[2:28:34] get you so that you would be the right
[2:28:37] kind of a witness to your
[2:28:39] generation and God would take this
[2:28:41] person and this person and come together
[2:28:44] and have a union these two people and
[2:28:46] come down so it had this certain ring
[2:28:48] like ring ring go to
[2:28:51] church love your
[2:28:53] husband train up a child in the way you
[2:28:56] should go and it has this ring as the
[2:28:57] Bride of Jesus Christ say but brother
[2:29:00] Daniel I'm flawed that doesn't worry
[2:29:01] about the flaw ring ring for the Lord be
[2:29:04] the say I got a weakness that's okay let
[2:29:06] God let your weakness say Lord I need
[2:29:08] you to be the right kind of a ring to my
[2:29:10] generation blessed be the name of the
[2:29:12] Lord I've got so many things I'm just
[2:29:13] going to skip over I had something out
[2:29:15] of the church age book but we're running
[2:29:17] a little short on time I was thinking
[2:29:20] how that the Bible says in him we live
[2:29:22] move and have our being Psalms 119 let
[2:29:25] me read this verse Psalms
[2:29:30] 119 just reading this 119 verse 81 the
[2:29:35] Bible said my soul fth for thy salvation
[2:29:37] but I hoped in thy word verse 87 said
[2:29:41] they had almost consumed me upon the
[2:29:44] Earth this is Psalms 119: 87 they had
[2:29:46] almost consumed me you ever feel like
[2:29:48] that in your life man they have almost
[2:29:51] consumed me oh that's weak brother no I
[2:29:54] had a prophet that he got audited
[2:29:56] anybody's been through a tax audit
[2:29:58] brother Brandon went through a tax audit
[2:30:00] and they got him on the phone and again
[2:30:01] and again he said I can't do this
[2:30:03] anymore and he you remember his wife and
[2:30:06] said tell him I'm not in here he's
[2:30:07] almost consumed I cannot mental what was
[2:30:09] the problem in his body no his body was
[2:30:11] fine but his memory was like I can't do
[2:30:14] this anymore somewhere in his Spirit
[2:30:16] realm he is imagine I imagine they're
[2:30:18] just going to he said that he said I
[2:30:20] can't imagine another afternoon and so
[2:30:22] he causes him to go and not be the man
[2:30:25] that he should and that's where David
[2:30:26] was thy they have almost consume me but
[2:30:28] I forsook not thy precepts so the
[2:30:31] prophet made a mistake Under Pressure he
[2:30:33] tells his wife say hey tell tell him I'm
[2:30:35] not in here and she comes back said but
[2:30:37] you were in here when he called so he
[2:30:39] went back and he made it right the angel
[2:30:40] of the Lord wouldn't let him do that is
[2:30:44] it right if I stop right here and talk
[2:30:45] about the cloud have we talked about
[2:30:46] that at all so when brother Brandon was
[2:30:48] there and he tells him like okay they're
[2:30:50] in here somebody calls he goes out says
[2:30:52] tell them I'm not in here I'm not in
[2:30:53] here and he comes back in say like well
[2:30:55] I'm going to there's a sick baby so he
[2:30:57] goes down to pray for the baby and the
[2:30:58] angel of the Lord says you can't pray
[2:31:00] for that baby because you told something
[2:31:01] that wasn't
[2:31:03] true he goes back and makes it right he
[2:31:05] comes back and praise for the baby and
[2:31:06] God heals the baby baby's completely
[2:31:08] healed it's a miracle right because God
[2:31:11] has to have the vessel the channel clear
[2:31:14] and the message standing in the Gap
[2:31:17] brother Ram talks about the cloud I
[2:31:18] think I saw the picture down brother
[2:31:20] Sean I know your pastor believe talks
[2:31:21] about the cloud that was in Arizona
[2:31:23] brother R said I was caught up in that
[2:31:24] consolation Angels come said go back to
[2:31:26] Jeffersonville and preach the Seven
[2:31:28] Seals people criticize brother Bram so
[2:31:30] in the message standing in the Gap
[2:31:31] brother brandham talks about the cloud
[2:31:32] picture at the end of the message not a
[2:31:34] sick baby but brother wayy Falls dead on
[2:31:36] this side of the church my father-in-law
[2:31:39] s was sitting right behind him when he
[2:31:40] fell fall he falls dead right behind him
[2:31:43] his wife was a registered nurse what do
[2:31:45] registered nurse nurses do when
[2:31:47] something happens they begin CPR she
[2:31:49] didn't CPR she reaches to brother random
[2:31:51] said brother random he's passed away you
[2:31:53] can listen to the tape staying in the
[2:31:54] Gap brother random goes down and pray he
[2:31:57] just walks down and and begins and when
[2:31:59] he started to pray for the baby the
[2:32:00] angel of the Lord didn't say you can't
[2:32:02] pray for that man because you said
[2:32:03] something that wasn't right about the
[2:32:05] cloud are you with me God doesn't change
[2:32:07] his nature right so before he said
[2:32:09] something that was a little and the
[2:32:10] angel of the Lord wouldn't let him let
[2:32:12] him pray for that baby now this man is
[2:32:14] not sick he's dead so it takes God
[2:32:17] almighty God to give this man back life
[2:32:19] and the angel Lord said you pray for
[2:32:20] that man because what you said about the
[2:32:22] cloud is true and what you said about
[2:32:24] the cloud is right and I'm going to
[2:32:25] raise this man for the dead vindicating
[2:32:27] your ministry and he raised him from the
[2:32:28] dead and I'm here to say I'm not going
[2:32:30] to let that paralyze me what the world
[2:32:32] says I say if it's good enough for God
[2:32:34] what he said it's good enough for me if
[2:32:37] it's good enough for God he would hear
[2:32:38] his prayer to answer to raise the man
[2:32:40] from the dead then it's good enough for
[2:32:41] me in my life oh don't let the devil
[2:32:43] paralyze your faith amen just let the
[2:32:45] Holy Spirit Come and heal your reasoning
[2:32:47] this morning he's a dissolver of all
[2:32:49] doubts that's what happened when Daniel
[2:32:51] came in the Bible the Bible says there's
[2:32:52] a man and he's a dissolver of doubts and
[2:32:55] that man is the prophet the holy ghost
[2:32:57] that can discern and dissolve all the
[2:32:59] doubts that we have faith comes by
[2:33:01] hearing and hearing the word of God and
[2:33:03] that's what he said in this verse I was
[2:33:05] almost consumed verse 88 he said Quicken
[2:33:07] me after thy loving kindness for so
[2:33:10] shall I keep thy testimonies amen I was
[2:33:13] thinking about that as we close that how
[2:33:16] the devil would love to consume you he'd
[2:33:19] love to destroy destroy you and there
[2:33:21] comes the Lord's been dealing with me a
[2:33:23] couple things about the grace of God we
[2:33:27] come to the place you all are listening
[2:33:28] so intently I'm trying to close
[2:33:30] seriously in but do you know how hard it
[2:33:31] is to get people to listen to The
[2:33:34] Gospel brother brandom talks about we've
[2:33:36] studied church history I've got the
[2:33:38] church age book in the beginning of this
[2:33:39] book is this okay brother Sean this
[2:33:41] isn't in any of my notes see this church
[2:33:43] age brother random draws us on the wall
[2:33:45] of the back of his church and so we come
[2:33:48] into this missionary age where there's
[2:33:50] so many believers they cancel up in in
[2:33:52] in New England they cancel the the
[2:33:55] police force they just dismiss them
[2:33:56] because everybody were Christians they
[2:33:58] didn't they didn't need to pleas for Law
[2:33:59] and Order because the Holy Ghost was
[2:34:00] bringing Law and Order and some of them
[2:34:02] finny and Knox and those people they
[2:34:04] would just get up and preach on the
[2:34:05] street people just fall down and give
[2:34:06] their hearts to the Lord that was a day
[2:34:08] that they lived it was amazing brother R
[2:34:09] said it was the tossel age the
[2:34:11] missionary age listen to me so when in
[2:34:13] our church I'm all over the place this
[2:34:15] morning but you all are listening so
[2:34:17] closely we live in a day we had security
[2:34:20] bad part of Louisville and we stuck a
[2:34:21] speaker out on the street so that when
[2:34:24] cuz I was a deacon we rotated the
[2:34:25] deacons you had to watch the cars and
[2:34:27] make sure they didn't break in and steal
[2:34:29] stuff they did so many times so we put
[2:34:30] the Deacon out there like I'm not
[2:34:31] sitting out here and backsliding so I
[2:34:33] run a wire out the thing and put a
[2:34:35] speaker out there so for two years we
[2:34:37] had the speaker blaring out on the
[2:34:38] streets of Louisville listen to me not
[2:34:40] one person not one person came off the
[2:34:43] street and heard the gospel and came
[2:34:46] inside and give their heart to the Lord
[2:34:48] why do I believe this message because
[2:34:49] it's the truth it's the revelation of
[2:34:52] the word of God back in this day they
[2:34:54] just heard and they came and just fell
[2:34:56] zeusa Street study zeusa Street they
[2:34:57] come to isusa Street and they say hey
[2:34:59] look I don't know the Holy Spirit fail
[2:35:00] there's people a block away and they're
[2:35:02] falling out in the spirit they don't
[2:35:03] even know what it is they get off the
[2:35:04] train and just fall out the Holy Spirit
[2:35:05] was being poured out God was doing
[2:35:07] something Sovereign and was at the fifth
[2:35:10] seal brother Ram said the church can do
[2:35:12] nothing but respond to the anointing
[2:35:13] that comes in that day so in in in the
[2:35:16] tossel age they just responded and the
[2:35:18] missionary age and then
[2:35:20] and then but now I tried to reproduce
[2:35:22] the missionary age and it didn't happen
[2:35:23] it's like Lord how what how do I live I
[2:35:25] go back to the revelation of the message
[2:35:27] and I see oh this is what it is and
[2:35:29] right in the last day it's just very
[2:35:30] very dark brother M said I think it was
[2:35:32] uh recognizing your day in the message
[2:35:34] he said it went into total darkness he
[2:35:35] said I put a little bit of light there
[2:35:37] to represent those people down in that
[2:35:39] one city at brother Sea's Church there a
[2:35:41] little bit of a light of people and then
[2:35:42] when God's got God's going to take him
[2:35:44] out in a Rapture and it'll go into total
[2:35:46] chaos so when you sit here and listen I
[2:35:48] say Lord that is not natural that is
[2:35:51] Supernatural the Bible says no man can
[2:35:53] come except the father draws him there's
[2:35:55] something in your heart that gave you a
[2:35:56] desire to go to the house of the Lord
[2:35:58] when churches are closing and they they
[2:36:00] just are like ah it was be over in 20
[2:36:02] minutes preach 20 minutes or the deacons
[2:36:03] go no there's something in your heart is
[2:36:05] saying Lord I want to be like you Lord I
[2:36:08] don't want to be paralyzed I don't want
[2:36:09] my testimony paralyzed Lord I want you
[2:36:11] to make even in my weakness Lord I want
[2:36:14] you to be
[2:36:15] glorified I want to be a better
[2:36:17] grandmother we got Thanksgiving coming
[2:36:19] up and maybe haven't done it last
[2:36:20] Thanksgiving but I'm going to stop this
[2:36:22] whole show and say look before we pray
[2:36:24] I'm going to say and give thanks to
[2:36:25] Jesus Christ who is the provider every
[2:36:27] good gift comes from above I'm going
[2:36:30] acknowledge this Thanksgiving meal came
[2:36:31] from Jesus Christ didn't come from our
[2:36:34] wallets it came from Jesus Christ is
[2:36:36] that good this church came from Jesus
[2:36:38] Christ every good gift brother Shawn is
[2:36:40] Straight from
[2:36:42] Heaven how can you say that our sister
[2:36:45] play every good gift comes from above
[2:36:49] from the Father of Lights in whom
[2:36:51] there's no VAR remember brother bisco
[2:36:53] and his testimony and they're sitting
[2:36:54] along L I don't know if you've heard the
[2:36:56] testimony they're sitting there brother
[2:36:57] Bisal is sitting with brother R they're
[2:36:59] sitting along the angel of the Lord
[2:37:00] comes down and they're just paralyzed
[2:37:02] they're just paralyzed I think another
[2:37:04] time in the car and they're just
[2:37:05] paralyzed and then after a few minutes
[2:37:06] it goes away brother Brandon looks at
[2:37:08] brother bisco and says every time he
[2:37:10] comes something good happens praise God
[2:37:14] every time we go to church amen line
[2:37:16] upon line word upon word amen here a
[2:37:18] little there God's adding Amen to the
[2:37:21] body to the image of Jesus Christ oh but
[2:37:23] brother Daniel I don't know I just
[2:37:25] really rub but no but God's perfecting
[2:37:27] something in you well I don't know I go
[2:37:29] to church as soon as I drive in I think
[2:37:31] of that situation where she stole the
[2:37:32] recipe from me and she's making those
[2:37:34] cookies and taking the glory or she gave
[2:37:36] me that recipe and she left two of those
[2:37:38] ingredients out intentionally she knows
[2:37:40] she rocked my whole world I ruined our
[2:37:41] family thing it's called
[2:37:44] sabotage I didn't realize sisters were
[2:37:46] so like that's my recipe like it's just
[2:37:49] letters on her no that's me I make
[2:37:51] macaroni this

[2:38:12] to drive in I'm going to park my car and
[2:38:13] I'm going to get up and I'm going to go

[2:38:16] songs and raise my hands and worship
[2:38:17] Jesus Christ I'm going to let the word
[2:38:19] of God speak to me and I'm going to go
[2:38:20] home a better Christian and I'm not
[2:38:22] going to let the devil and the mind

[2:39:17] do that anymore
[2:39:19] I'm not going to do that anymore and
[2:39:21] sometimes in our weakness we get too far
[2:39:23] from the shepherd and we do something's
[2:39:25] wrong and we get a scar and I'm not
[2:39:27] taking that radiator cap off anymore I'm
[2:39:29] not going over there anymore I'm not
[2:39:31] staying home from church I'm not taking
[2:39:33] a 5-year detour from the house of
[2:39:37] God sometimes we get relationship like
[2:39:39] fine and you realize I'm not going to do
[2:39:42] fine to God cuz I need him I need him
[2:39:45] he's my provider I cannot do without him
[2:39:48] and I am what I am by the grace of God
[2:39:50] and if God takes his hand off me I'm
[2:39:52] done I'm just done or maybe there's
[2:39:55] something that's powerless that you're
[2:39:57] powerless
[2:39:59] before I don't know we wrestle not
[2:40:02] against flesh and blood I don't more and
[2:40:04] more it's not the guy with the AK-47 or
[2:40:06] the person with the axe it's demon
[2:40:09] powers the other day I went into my barn
[2:40:11] and this demon power came in there and I
[2:40:14] I was just like God I'm not going to
[2:40:16] tell you what it is because you'll think
[2:40:17] less of me just like you think you L
[2:40:18] somebody jumping on not tell you hey no
[2:40:20] brother brandom and Jesus was tempted to
[2:40:23] jump and like okay brother yeah Jesus
[2:40:26] like so this demon power you you the
[2:40:28] Bible says in the one place they are
[2:40:30] taken captive at his will you see these
[2:40:33] school shootings little 14-year-old boy
[2:40:35] they're just a vessel we're all vessels
[2:40:36] and the devil says I'll take him captive
[2:40:38] good boy take out and kill these people
[2:40:40] and they're like hey Johnny don't do
[2:40:41] that what did I just do that's why a lot
[2:40:43] of times they commit suicide themselves
[2:40:45] The Devils take them captive and then
[2:40:46] they come out like what have I done and
[2:40:48] they take their own life but what about
[2:40:50] people being full of the Holy Spirit and
[2:40:52] Mama sitting down with Johnny and
[2:40:54] talking to him greater love hath no man
[2:40:56] than a man lay down his life for his
[2:40:58] friend and you have a pastor there's no
[2:41:00] greater love than he would study and
[2:41:02] come out and lay his life down and say
[2:41:04] I'm giving my life for the Sheep Lord we
[2:41:07] think oh hanging on a cross that's one
[2:41:09] Christ did that we don't need a pastor
[2:41:10] to hang on a cross right but to give a
[2:41:12] heartbeat you only have so many
[2:41:14] heartbeats in this life and when a man
[2:41:16] go sits in an office and gets down on
[2:41:18] his knees and he prays said Lord what
[2:41:20] would you have me to speak to those
[2:41:22] people he's giving his life yes he is
[2:41:25] and the Bible says there's no greater
[2:41:28] love than a man lay down his life and
[2:41:30] give his life give his heartbeats for
[2:41:32] the Sheep that's love well I thought if
[2:41:35] he called me every day and every Monday
[2:41:36] I got a text at at 8:30 I got that word
[2:41:39] of encouragement from our pastor and he
[2:41:40] was just a real socializer but that's
[2:41:42] not he's laying down his life for the
[2:41:44] Sheep aren't you glad for the Bible like
[2:41:47] oh that's a real Pastor that that's a
[2:41:49] real evidence of
[2:41:51] love the Lord remember brother brandom
[2:41:53] said he said I was powerless till the he
[2:41:56] realized his weakness remember the other
[2:41:58] time greatest battle ever fought brother
[2:42:00] random Nelly Sanders comes up knocks in
[2:42:03] his door running in Oh Brother random i'
[2:42:05] sin and sin and he brings him in maybe
[2:42:07] he's got the drunk man in there he
[2:42:08] helped the drunk person like what have
[2:42:10] you done he said I was coming down the
[2:42:11] street and there was that bar and I just
[2:42:13] stop for a minute that's what happens
[2:42:15] sometimes we stop for a minute and said
[2:42:17] I was in the dance room and I oh I've
[2:42:20] send away my she comes running in
[2:42:21] brother said I I was just young CH I
[2:42:23] didn't know about devils and
[2:42:24] surrendering to them then he said well
[2:42:26] let's just pray and so he said he
[2:42:29] started praying all of a sudden this bat
[2:42:30] come up comes up with hairs and started
[2:42:33] going around and what' brother random do
[2:42:34] he say I'm Malachi 4 are you get no no
[2:42:37] he said blood of Jesus Christ protect me
[2:42:39] from that thing and the prophet of God
[2:42:41] realized he's no match for this demon
[2:42:44] that has just come out of this girl but
[2:42:46] in his weakness amen he told a story how
[2:42:48] he appealed to Jesus Christ I'm telling
[2:42:51] the story 60 years later of how a man
[2:42:53] surrendered himself to Jesus Christ and
[2:42:56] the strength of Jesus Christ is being
[2:42:57] manifested here this morning because he
[2:42:59] showed me his weakness I'm weak but he's
[2:43:04] strong and he him telling that story I'm
[2:43:06] telling it today that Christ is Manifest
[2:43:08] greater is he that is in us than he that
[2:43:11] is in the world amen amen I'm skip over
[2:43:15] what I had in this I'm going to read
[2:43:16] this little plaque here if it's okay and
[2:43:18] then I'm going to close
[2:43:19] God wants eaglets he wants Messiahs he
[2:43:23] wants men and women who have signs and
[2:43:25] wonders anointed ones I think it's page
[2:43:28] 16 in the church age book if my memory
[2:43:30] serves me correct brother Ram said Mark
[2:43:32] 16 is the only true church I think he
[2:43:35] said Mark 16 in action in action is the
[2:43:38] only true church so we can have a Church
[2:43:40] website we can have paty pews we can
[2:43:42] have all the bells and whistles but if
[2:43:44] we don't have in my name they shall cast
[2:43:46] out how's it these signs will follow
[2:43:48] them that believe in my name they'll
[2:43:50] cast out Devils they'll speak with new
[2:43:51] tongues they'll lay hands on the sick
[2:43:53] they shall recover amen if they take up
[2:43:56] any deadly thing that's Mark 16 in
[2:43:58] action that's the true church the only
[2:44:00] true church and brother B said he wants
[2:44:02] a church that's filled with the Holy
[2:44:04] Ghost a church reflecting him the same
[2:44:05] yesterday to day and forever God don't
[2:44:08] die he just borned a kingdom got his
[2:44:11] Messiahs in it amen every words he says
[2:44:13] they say Amen to it can you say Amen to
[2:44:15] the word of God amen amen to the word of
[2:44:18] God he said that's right they look at
[2:44:20] like him they act like him they believe
[2:44:22] it they got the conductor moving right
[2:44:24] on with signs and wonders following
[2:44:25] that's the messiah messiah living
[2:44:27] tonight he isn't dead he's alive forever
[2:44:30] more he's alive inside you and me
[2:44:33] brother Daniel but I'm flawed yeah but
[2:44:35] it's your weakness that shows his
[2:44:37] strength because if you had great
[2:44:39] talents well look at that brother pre
[2:44:41] like no no he he can't he does he has
[2:44:43] all these and I can tell you I got a
[2:44:44] list don't worry about finding my
[2:44:46] mistakes I got the list made I'll just
[2:44:48] give it to you say save you the time and
[2:44:49] the
[2:44:50] trouble the other day we were talking I
[2:44:53] had preached somebody said look you
[2:44:56] there's three things in your sermon glad
[2:44:58] you got something out of the service you
[2:45:02] know how's the Bible say henceforth we
[2:45:04] know no man after the flesh so when
[2:45:07] brother brandham says that Moses built
[2:45:08] the ark I don't argue with brother
[2:45:10] brandham because I don't know him by the
[2:45:12] flesh I know him by Revelation I know
[2:45:14] that Noah built the ark and Moses
[2:45:16] brought the people out amen did I tell
[2:45:19] about the text I got from my pastor I'm
[2:45:21] going to try to close Okay I read the
[2:45:23] plaque I got a text here a couple months
[2:45:26] ago my pastor was on vacation I was in
[2:45:29] charge of the church trying to help and
[2:45:30] I got a text from him like um can you
[2:45:33] help me like okay my pastor doesn't text
[2:45:36] much he just calls I'm like that's
[2:45:38] really odd and then there like
[2:45:41] somebody's in the hospital with cancer
[2:45:43] I'm like okay he probably wants me but
[2:45:45] he would have called me and then I got a
[2:45:47] thing I need you to go get some um Apple
[2:45:51] um what's the Apple the iTunes I need
[2:45:53] you to go get some iTunes gift cards so
[2:45:56] that we can take it up to her and give
[2:45:57] her in the hospital I'm like that's not
[2:46:00] my pastor that's but it had it had my
[2:46:03] name Daniel I need you to help and I'm
[2:46:05] like how in the world so um I was you
[2:46:08] know I didn't text back or or no he when
[2:46:10] they first text I text him right back
[2:46:12] okay hey account help how can I help you
[2:46:14] I need you to get get some iTunes gift
[2:46:16] card I'm like my pastor doesn't even
[2:46:17] know what iTunes is he would not he
[2:46:20] would call me and and he would tell me
[2:46:21] to go up there and pray for the person
[2:46:23] not get them iTune gift cards and that's
[2:46:25] where I realize sometimes you don't know
[2:46:26] listen to me what technology what the
[2:46:28] devil can throw in front of you and
[2:46:30] maybe even fake to be like someone else
[2:46:32] that's where the Bible says henceforth
[2:46:34] know we know man after the flesh but we
[2:46:36] know them by
[2:46:37] revelation we know them by Spirit listen
[2:46:40] we're at Sunday school the holy spirit's
[2:46:41] teaching us they say on the phones when
[2:46:43] somebody calls you in the scammer in
[2:46:45] three seconds they can build a database
[2:46:47] of your voice yeah and with that data
[2:46:49] boys they can fake to be your grandchild
[2:46:51] they did it with my son my grandson they
[2:46:53] called my grandfather and said hey this
[2:46:54] is William and and I need some money my
[2:46:57] father-in-law hung up the phone like
[2:46:58] what a great-grandfather you are you
[2:46:59] didn't even insert didn't even call us
[2:47:01] to say hey is it true that we like no
[2:47:03] that's a scammer like you didn't even
[2:47:04] check on your family but they can build
[2:47:06] this say hey you're they just had a car
[2:47:08] wreck and they need your credit card to
[2:47:09] do and so we say look henceforth know we
[2:47:11] no man after the flesh but we know them
[2:47:13] by
[2:47:14] Revelation amen I don't care if you take
[2:47:16] brother Sean's voice and build a thing
[2:47:17] and and come out with this private thing
[2:47:19] of him saying this and this I know his
[2:47:21] Revelation I know he G he's given his
[2:47:23] life for the message of the hour are you
[2:47:25] with me and the church you can take and
[2:47:27] and fake like his voice said this this
[2:47:29] this but I know him I know his
[2:47:30] Revelation he's given his life for this
[2:47:33] message he's given what about you if
[2:47:36] they if they were to come in there and
[2:47:38] and get people and persecute them for
[2:47:40] being a Christian would they have enough
[2:47:42] evidence to prosecute you about it like
[2:47:46] I go to church I send a check over there
[2:47:48] that's my ti but
[2:47:49] do you is there enough evidence that
[2:47:51] yeah they went to church sometimes you
[2:47:53] get in your car and your thing says
[2:47:55] here's the directions to so and so and
[2:47:57] I'm like wow even technology that's
[2:48:00] tracking me realizes every Sunday I go
[2:48:02] to
[2:48:03] church I have a life I have a how's the
[2:48:06] Bible says be a pattern of Good
[2:48:08] Works amen God's strength is made
[2:48:10] perfect in our weakness I'm just going
[2:48:12] to close is that all right shared a lot
[2:48:14] of weaknesses I've got a whole bunch
[2:48:15] more weaknesses we're like family now
[2:48:17] right all right you can't share my
[2:48:20] weaknesses but God knows what but flesh
[2:48:22] that's what the Bible says he knows that
[2:48:24] we're flesh they talk about this Ai and
[2:48:27] writing reports that kids like hey I can
[2:48:28] write a and it's perfect they come back
[2:48:30] like no this isn't a human because it's
[2:48:32] perfect so how do you smart it you do a
[2:48:34] couple verb tenses and misspell some
[2:48:36] words and you trick AI right but I think
[2:48:38] if God wanted perfect Christians he
[2:48:40] could have created
[2:48:42] robots he didn't want a robot that okay
[2:48:45] just feed this in and I'll come out and
[2:48:47] be the person that you tell me to be he
[2:48:49] didn't want a robot he
[2:48:51] wanted he wanted somebody that would
[2:48:53] love
[2:48:54] him somebody that had a relationship
[2:48:57] with it
[2:48:58] amen he comes into the garden said look
[2:49:00] at this beautiful paradise and hey don't
[2:49:02] touch this tree and he didn't stand
[2:49:04] there with the stick he just turned and
[2:49:06] walked away and left them because he
[2:49:09] wanted to build a relationship with his
[2:49:11] children and when they made a mistake he
[2:49:14] didn't kill them he come back and
[2:49:16] redeemed them sure they died to the day
[2:49:19] with the Lord is as a thousand years so
[2:49:20] he did the day that you eat thereof that
[2:49:22] day you die so every man in the Bible
[2:49:24] died within a thousand years right so
[2:49:26] the scripture was fulfilled but by their
[2:49:28] soul God made a way back that he could
[2:49:30] have fellowship with the son and that's
[2:49:32] what he's wanting he's not wanting
[2:49:33] robots this morning he's not wanting
[2:49:35] people that are perfect he's wanting a
[2:49:36] people that love him they ask him what
[2:49:39] is the great commandment just love the
[2:49:40] Lord with all your heart with all your
[2:49:42] soul with all your
[2:49:44] mind and when you come to that place you
[2:49:47] realize lord I can't do what you're
[2:49:49] asking me to
[2:49:50] do I say that's not failure that's
[2:49:54] success the Lord if phoh if Moses has
[2:49:57] just stood there and they Pharaoh's Army
[2:49:59] had come and killed them all we the
[2:50:01] Bible would be written different but
[2:50:02] when he cried and said Lord I I can't do
[2:50:04] this I can't deliver this God's strength
[2:50:08] was made perfect in moses' weakness and
[2:50:10] we come to the place say Lord I can't be
[2:50:13] a Christian I can't make it and I don't
[2:50:17] know if you've ever come to that place
[2:50:18] in your life life to maybe your
[2:50:20] weaknesses and maybe maybe you're a
[2:50:22] super Christian but some of us aren't
[2:50:25] all right and I'm not a superch
[2:50:27] Christian I'm one that needs Christ and
[2:50:29] maybe it's just because I have so many
[2:50:31] weaknesses that I have to walk close to
[2:50:33] the Lord and say Lord I need you and I
[2:50:36] can't make it without you and I didn't
[2:50:39] get this far just because I was raised
[2:50:41] at the brandom Tabernacle and and the
[2:50:43] Lord made me a preacher that that's
[2:50:45] nothing it's Christ and if he leaves us
[2:50:48] we're nothing amen and when God brings
[2:50:51] you to that I say that's not failure
[2:50:53] that's a great Revelation to say Lord I
[2:50:56] need you and I can't make it without you
[2:50:58] amen and I am only here today because of
[2:51:01] you I would not be here today can you
[2:51:03] say that even I wouldn't be a Christian
[2:51:05] today the the back along the way there's
[2:51:08] too much sickness brother Sean too many
[2:51:10] disappointments of life if it hadn't
[2:51:12] been for Christ I wouldn't be here today
[2:51:14] and so I hold his hand I say Lord I am
[2:51:16] what I am by your grace and Lord don't
[2:51:18] take
[2:51:19] don't take your Holy Spirit from me Lord
[2:51:22] amen let's just bow our heads together
[2:51:24] as the musicians come Heavenly Father
[2:51:28] Lord I've delivered my heart today and
[2:51:31] Lord I didn't have all these weaknesses
[2:51:34] that I would share but Lord I we're
[2:51:39] human you said that you know that we are
[2:51:41] but
[2:51:42] flesh and Lord we need you today I need
[2:51:45] you Lord ministers need you Lord as your
[2:51:49] Prophet said we not only have to live it

[2:51:58] other brothers Lord and the deacons and

[2:52:06] day of encouragement Lord when we come
[2:52:08] to a place that we can't make it anymore
[2:52:12] that little song Mercy rewrote my life
[2:52:14] Lord when we can't make it anymore and
[2:52:16] you say I can't do this Lord then you're
[2:52:18] strength is made perfect in our weakness
[2:52:21] father I wonder with our heads bowed if
[2:52:24] there be somebody here say brother
[2:52:26] Daniel you're somehow the Holy Spirit
[2:52:28] speaking my language today and I just

[2:52:34] weak God bless you I'm weak God bless
[2:52:37] you God bless you God bless you amen
[2:52:41] maybe you're hey you can be weak for a
[2:52:43] long time but Moses had two mountains
[2:52:46] beside him had a red sea and had an army
[2:52:48] that's coming and said Lord I'm really
[2:52:49] weak he been begin to cry to God say God
[2:52:52] help me God save me and we have a story
[2:52:55] today of a great Victory because a man
[2:52:57] admitted that he was weak and he began
[2:52:59] to cry to God I say there's great
[2:53:02] strength and turning from our own human
[2:53:03] abilities and turning to God and say
[2:53:06] Lord you need to help me father I can't
[2:53:08] stay in this marriage anymore Lord
[2:53:10] unless you help me and in my weakness
[2:53:12] and my admission amen that God can come
[2:53:15] and strengthen me and the glory of my
[2:53:17] marriage amen can go on maybe you got
[2:53:19] teenagers you say Lord I can't raise
[2:53:21] these children anymore Lord I need you
[2:53:24] father to give me strength and I if
[2:53:26] there's any glory in our family it'll
[2:53:28] become be because of the strength of the
[2:53:30] Holy Spirit moving through our
[2:53:32] family yes Lord Jesus maybe there's
[2:53:34] somebody sick in your spirit today say

[2:54:02] have been raised and I pray father the
[2:54:04] word of God has been spoken and Lord to

[3:05:14] one of us here
[3:05:18] would declare that if it had not been
[3:05:20] for the Lord on our side and we'd been
[3:05:23] swallowed up by the

[3:06:10] comes to church amen and rejoicing and
[3:06:14] well what what would cause that ain't
[3:06:18] her it's just something within her

[3:06:23] with all of us we've gone through a lot
[3:06:26] of
[3:06:26] things we go through things we'll
