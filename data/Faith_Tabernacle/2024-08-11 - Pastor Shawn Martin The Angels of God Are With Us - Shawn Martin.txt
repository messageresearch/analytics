all those that may have been affected by this co uh down there at the meeting pray that you would encourage them and strengthen them and heal them Father is our prayer yes Lord we just commit this into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen uh so we're going to start at the um see 34 and 7 and it says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them aren't you glad for that amen then if you'll turn to the Book of Psalms 104 Book of Psalms 104 and we're going to start at the first verse blessed be the Lord oh my soul oh Lord my my God Thou Art very great thou art clothed with honor and Majesty who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretcheth out the heavens like a curtain who layeth the beams of his Chambers in the water who maketh the clouds his Chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind who maketh his angels Spirits his ministers a fles flaming fire one more if you'll turn to first Thessalonians the 2 chapter amen first Thessalonians the 2 chapter and we'll just um read the 13th verse it says for this call also we thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which you heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of God which effectively worketh also in you that belief amen you can have your seats this morning I'm going to use the title angels of God are encamped around us and as we read there that um the angels are ministering spirits and um there's a lot that has been said about angels we've talked about it many times and um and I I I don't think you could really exhaust the subject of of angel of course Angels live in the Unseen Rim uh so they are not seen by most people um of course uh few of the Saints in the Bible have been visited by angels and have seen them uh but not all and there are some uh still today uh some that have seen angels have had visitations of of course our the prophet talked about it uh having uh visitation of angels uh it it seemed like on a daily basis uh there but um we we know that that uh uh even though we can't see them but they are real and of course there's a lot of discussion about angels whether they are real or whether they're not but uh even you know there they're UN in this Unseen World and and we know that there is an unseen uh we you know the prophet talked about television and how that uh television has been able to prove a man by television has proven that there is an Unseen World and that it is a reality and he talked about that there are you know people passing through this room even now and that voices of of men and women that have uh lived ages past that they're still in the room and um and so our our natural senses can't pick these things up because it's in another dimension and the prophet talked on dimensions and and uh and and so we know this there but but he he would tell us that television it's it is is n manufacturing the pictures it's it's only a channel uh that picks up the Unseen and makes it visible to to us and and so uh you know brother brandom in taking that he said you can't move your you can't move or bad an eye uh but what it is uh being recorded forever it's um every move that you make and and even down to your thoughts and your voice and and all of these things and uh it's it's forever uh recorded it's it's there and so you know he said you know take a man in Australia or Switzerland Africa or wherever it may be around the world and and you know uh and what he does what he says and and every movement and and what He even wears can be projected by television it it is something there and so uh it's somehow that television can channel uh uh through this uh and and and make the Unseen a reality to you and I of course we've moved on from from television to internet and and these things like that but uh you know when when Adam was here television was here when when you know Noah and all the way down it it it the television was was was there all all along and and so so it will never die what what we what we do say and and all these things it'll never die and brother Brown said it's in the other waves of the air and it's still alive and so you know a lot of people think that they will escape judgment that there's no such thing as judgment or that they can hide things but yet it will all be played out be be of of what we've done in this life everything will be played out and and and so uh but but he made the point that that as it is with Humanity uh uh so is God and His angels here in this building as well and uh uh they're here but we cannot see him we cannot hear him or you know uh uh but yet they're here and they are supernatural beings uh uh that are are unseen To Us by our natural sight and so you know uh uh it would take a certain tube or Crystal of of something to pick up that voice and I I believe that if we had the right voice and the right channel the right instrument we could pick up all the way back in the Garden of Eden and and hear a conversation that went on and and know what was happening in that time uh but but it takes the channel and of course we know that God had a prophet to pick that up and and tell us exactly what happened and and these things and he could see that he in one place said I'm looking through a window we're looking through this window you know and he tells us that he could see the the the the skin flapping on the back of their legs as they were running through the garden of bloody skins and and all of these things but but it would take a it takes something Amen to pick up uh uh these these this Unseen World and brother brandham he says but someday it'll be reality just as television is now and just as common amen just as common and so uh uh you know as I realize that there are people who don't believe in angels and they a lot of don't even believe in God anymore but um but they are in in important to us and and I I think that uh uh uh we should consider this and and uh because they are still in my belief and what I see what a prophet taught that they're still being used to minister to the church today amen and so you know but people seem uh uh to have this notion that God God isn't doing what he used to do and they want to change God they want to change his ways and and and uh so what he used to do in the Old Testament they say he doesn't do now in the New Testament and a lot of them use the argument that prophets were used in the Old Testament but but not in the New Testament and Angels were used in the Old Testament but they're not needed in the in the New Testament and uh one man's explanation for not believing in angels was that God doesn't use angels to direct his church anymore it's it's the holy spirit that that that directs uh the church now and he he of course he could he could agree with that that Daniel had an angel uh and and and Noah had an angel and and Moses and Abraham and Joshua and all them you know the Angels appeared to them but uh uh but but as far as he was concerned that only applied to the the Old Testament and so he he he says that when we're when we're talking of angels today then we're mixing uh uh the Old Testament and the New Testament together and and we're out of place and all that but you know the the Bible says that the Old Testament is only a shadow of the new amen and and so brother bradam says both the Old and the new together confirms God's attitude towards the people aren't you glad for that that God's attitude Remains the Same all the way through the old and the New Testament and we can see a a picture of what God is is after and wanting for for his people and so of course you know there are people that don't believe in such a thing as Miracles or or prophets and you know talking to a a gentleman a couple years ago and tell me that the the apostolic age has ceased and uh there's no more healing no more miracles no more you know uh uh the nine spiritual gifts are no longer in operation and and all these things but you know I've I've thought of of times they they they arrive to this conclusion is is perhaps they have seen too much or so much impersonation of of people trying to do it trying to manufacture something that that and and it just it just makes it look like the gospel's got a flaw in it and and all of these things and and so there there's been so much inaccuracy and misinformation in the real of gifts till people don't believe in gifts anymore there there's been uh many claiming to be a prophet and have have made a a a a a shame of it or whatever you'd want to call it when the true God Vindicated Prophet comes on the scene the people refuse to believe it and just say well it's just another another one of them you know and and so uh uh men men and women have claimed to have visitation of angels and you know and and yet it it it's so farfetched that that people just don't believe them anymore and it's it's brought a real mockery to the real thing and so but you know the prophet would tell us and and it lines up with the Bible that if an angel does come and he would come according to the scriptures and and if he does not work with the scriptures then it's it's of the devil ain't that right amen and so that but that goes for anything if a prophet arises on the scene or a dream is given or a prophecy is given a preacher tongues interpretation of tongu if if it doesn't work according to the scriptures then it it it's it's inspired of the devil it's it's it comes from uh the flesh amen and and so this is where Paul would tell us in in 2 Corinthians 11 and13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their Works ain't that right so so we already know that these things are going to be but if there's if there's a a fake then then there's always got to be a true real real thing or there would be no fake if there's a false then there's there's the real and so brother Brams is a a real true angel will come and vindicate this scripture to the dot if if any any visitation that a man would have of angels it will always vindicate the Scripture it takes you back to scripture and and and and this is exactly what the angel did to Joseph in in there when he was troubled about Mary and her testimony and all these things the angel that appeared to him in the dream took him to scriptures and compared it that when when Joseph woke up he knew he had a Divine answer to to what Mary was saying it it confirmed her testimony ain't that right and and so a a a real true Prophet will stay with the word and will not compromise and of course I I believe that brother brandham I think all of us here believe that brother brandham was a true Vindicated prophet of the Lord and and was supernaturally Vindicated by God and and so this is why we must stay within the the bounds of what he has taught and he never taught us to do away with the fivefold ministry and and just press play uh he he never he never taught against the moving of the Spirit uh uh in in amongst the people he never did away with the gifts of the Spirit amen that Paul had put in the church and he never taught that it was okay to stay a home and and and and uh uh listen to tapes or uh uh live stream and and all that and stay away from church and these things he he never taught that we understand that the you know we we do uh uh uh encourage and uh I know in my home we play tapes uh at the home but but we go to the house of God and and we believe in a fightful Ministry we you know uh uh we we understand that we do have life dream uh there's some that get sick and they're not able to come to church or uh or things that that happen and and so we have that but but it's not the excuse for people to stay home uh because God sent us a message and and the message is is in Vindicated of God so brother Brandon he would tell us just for the uh just for I just read it he said you got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God and how we ought got to come together sit together in Heavenly places aren't you glad for that sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home ain't that right so so brother Brandon clearly puts a distinction between home and church ain't that right some people that you know they say well I I've got my church right here it's home you know yeah right you know brother Brandon says don't stay home go to church ain't that right and so he said if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors open and that's not your living room door or your bedroom door that's the church doors amen you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder out yonder see to get here in fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray in ain't that right so then anything that is sent of God and from God will not stray from the word and and and I I think that is so important it it you know Pentecostal should have understood that ain't that right that they lean to the sensations and they lean to the emotions and they lean all of these things and and then we find that they're uh uh calling things Angels they're calling things of God that really really isn't of God and and these things and I'm talking about an angel of the Lord amen and so uh uh uh any man uh that is of god he's going to believe in angels uh that's just a given uh because the Bible promised that they would be with us ain't that right I've got a lot of quotes and things and I hope it'll be helpful but brother randam says Angelic beings associate together they associate together so he said if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World now think of that you are a candidate for the association with the Unseen World and the supernatural amen aren't you glad for the Holy Ghost amen that would come and live inside of you that that would tune you in to an Unseen World and let you know there is an unseen and there is a reality too it how else would we know that there's a heaven and how do how else would we really know if if there's an eternal City how else would we really know if there's a theophany waiting for us how would we know these things and expect them things looking for to them things if there isn't something speaking of it in our hearts ain't that right so later on he says in this in that same sermon he says when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly that man becomes a two-fold being one of the earth to die one of Heaven to live Amen in his body he's still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from Death un life in his body he has Earthly contact with his five senses in his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them speaks with them and they are messengers sent from God to reveal and to bring messages from God to the individual now I I you know I I I when you know looking at these things I think we're blessed Amen to be able to have an acquaintance with angels I I I really do and and and maybe hopefully we can uh uh uh bring that make that clear but see if if if um you know brother brandham he said if if if a person does not believe that angels are ministering Spirit sent from the presence of God then he just doesn't know his Bible so I want to look at a scripture uh there in Genesis 28:10 uh where it speaks of uh Jacob's lad and and uh here it says and Jacob went out from beerseba and went toward Heron and he lighted upon a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillars and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set on up on the earth and the top of it reached the heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it see so so the the the the latter was on Earth the one end and the other was in heaven and in between there's angels of of God that is ascending and descending now what does this represent it was it represented that God was providing God showing us that he would provide a way of Escape aren't you glad for that amen God I I mean any everything that God does in in the scriptures do you realize it's for us it's it's for his people you know brother Bram said it's a love letter to to the bride of Christ and and and maybe we didn't understand the Parables we didn't understand the things that that were written that God would send a prophet in this day to reveal the heart of God to us and that we could have a better understanding of what this bible really means and how that we can take it as a personal consolation amen that if we're part of the church God's Got Us taken care of amen and this is what it was this this lad it was showing that God would provide a way of Escape you see the lad is symbolic of the church amen rising from Earth to glory amen God taking us amen we born as Sinners born as as as nobodies we were losers we brother Bram even talked you know and faith is Victory I think he said we were born defeated and and all these things but but that's not our end that that's that's not our hope Paul would say if I had hope in this life only I'd be of all men most miserable we would all be that way amen but in this dark hour in this in this time of trouble in this time of tribulation coming upon the the world we've got a hope and God would show it in the scriptures that he would take us from Earth to glory amen our journey that's a journey it's not from church to church from to Doctrine it's from Earth to Glory it's as the as we were the Sands of the sea amen and now we're becoming the stars of the heavens amen coming from Earthly to Heavenly ain't that right see we're climbing upwards and and brother Bram said one thing about it is this ladder is not a two-way there's only one way and that's that's up ain't that right amen you can't be saved today and lost tomorrow amen you can't go up five rings and and fall off amen it's one way and that's where you're at ain't that right we're moving up and so we we find that we don't have to stay in the muck and the Meer for God has provided a way for us to leave this Earthbound rim and come into the heavenlies amen the atmospheres and aren't you glad for that amen things the prophet said that has has kept us out of fellowship with God God would provided a way that we could come up higher and come into that Rim when we didn't know what God was and we didn't know who God was we didn't have an experience with God Amen maybe some of us went through just the religious act and yet without having a real experience with God then we found that ladder and and and we started climbing the ladder and God becomes more real to us and the things of God become more of reality to us than than he was back in the day can you say Amen but you see that the Church of God is predestinated it's a predestinated church now notice we're predestinated to be without spot wrinkle or blemish amen we're predestinated to be conformed to the image of his dear son we're predestinated Amen to the adoption of sons do you believe that this church is predestinated men to live in that Eternal City and only that predestinated people will live in that City Amen predestinated to rule and to reign with him amen see we were predestinated to go from sinner Amen to a saint Amen to go from a a vagabond to a Son of God Amen to go from manifest uh manifesting this worldly things to manifesting the things of God Amen we were predestinated for that amen God didn't save us just to remain church members and dry and dead and and struggling and no hope no faith no joy you you understand what I'm saying sure we have our battles and sure that he also predestinated us Amen to overcome amen there's just something about God and so it he he predestinated it and and and so if he predestinated it he had to provide that way for us to be transformed amen so he provided this ladder if you could say it in Jacob's Dream It's a ladder Amen to where we could start climbing and and day by day we're CH being changed and word by word and everything we're believing of the of the Gospel it is CH transforming us amen and that word transform is to change from one thing to another can you say amen amen you see when God called us out of Babylon he didn't call us from one Church to another church from one Doctrine to another Doctrine from one denomination to another denomination he didn't call us just to reform us can you say Amen to where we just switch a church titles and and and go from Baptist to Pentecostal or Pentecostal to Catholic or whatever amen but he called us that we might be transformed called us out of babbling called us out of the sin called us out of the confusion called us from the powers of Darkness that we could be liberated and experience the Heavenly things can you say Amen things that the carnal man will never know nothing of the average man will never know nothing of that God called you to experience the Unseen yes sir amen so all these things are Earthbound but God has called us from Earth to Glory so God need us to needed to establish his ladder on the Earth he already had it hooked on in heaven on the throne of God but he needed it to be hooked to assure foundation on Earth amen so brother Bram would tell us he tried to hook it up uh hook it on the upon the Jewish Nation but it didn't work he couldn't hook it up on Jacob amen the sub planter he couldn't hook it up on on on Abraham he was he lied and treated the wife his wife the way he treated her and and all these things he couldn't hook it up on David the ad Al and and all of these things but but then in the Old Testament I believe it was that a prophet would rise up and he saw a stone and and he said a stone would come it would be a precious stone a a Cornerstone and and these things a tried Stone ain't that right well we know that stone to be it was the Cornerstone which was Jesus Christ and as God predestinated a church he predestinated that stone Amen to be that sure Foundation aren't you glad for that amen you're predestinated brother Bill Jesus Christ was predestinated and Jesus Christ cannot fail do you believe that cannot fail now see and so now notice that Cornerstone that stone that he God would set that ladder upon for his church amen would be Jesus Christ amen see you you ain't going you ain't going to heaven on on any denomination you you ain't going to he he couldn't set that letter on anybody else amen it wouldn't get us to glory amen but he could set it Upon Jesus Christ amen and and and that power of Jesus Christ would raise us up amen into everything that God has predestinated us to be amen so now notice what Jesus said in John 1:51 verily verily I say unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and the angels of God us ascending and descending where upon the Baptist Church Upon a Pentecostal Church Upon Shawn Martin upon upon Faith Tabernacle no upon the son of man can you say amen that's where the rock was amen that Angels would be Ascend and descend amen upon the son of man so see the prophet said see that latter it's hooked to the throne of God and to the Heart of Jesus Christ and we're in between it see what we're doing we're climbing up we're moving up ain't that right he said see God doesn't want his ladder slipping around he tried to hook it with the Covenant with Adam he broke it he hooked it to a covenant and with uh and it says and he broke it any time that God made a covenant with man man always broke it but then God would make an unconditional Covenant with himself ain't that right see and and he says he hooked it in Jesus Christ amen and what was Jesus Christ he was God made flesh so God become the stone Amen to hook this lad too he said there it's anchored there's no slipping and sliding there's no way of getting away what is it it's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath and what is it it's a pathway everybody say it's a pathway it's a traveler's way from Earth to glory and you cannot fail can you say Amen how did you get on the ladder God ordained you to that ladder amen he he knows what he's doing with your life and you cannot fail he's already made a weight you ain't going to fall well aren't you glad for that amen we we cannot worry about well am I going to make it or am I not I like what brother Andrew said one time in well there in Arkansas he said you know I don't study much about hell because I know I'm not going to hell amen I want to study about where I'm going a ain't that right I'm not going to study about the negative I don't want to dwell on the negative I I I I that's fine about politics and all that but that's not where my mind is that's not where my heart is I'm not interested in what they're doing I'm interested in what God is doing in my life and where I'm going well amen I trust you're that way too see you can't fail politics Will Fail and you'll fail with it if you're hooked to that you're going to fall if you're hooked up to yourself you're going to fall if you're hooked up to a minister you're going to fall if you're hooked up to a church you're going to fall if you're even hooked up to your Doctrine you're going to fall but if you're ever hooked up to Jesus Christ you cannot fail that you cannot fail can you say amen and to think of it that God didn't choose a perfect church but he chose a blood that would perfect that church to where they can never fall can never fall he said see we're caught between it see with the great host of angels bringing forth ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road aren't you glad for that God gives us angels all around us vindicating that we're on our road amen that's why we don't believe in a dead dry religion amen that's why you cannot get to the place that you don't believe in the Supernatural can you say amen God sends ministering Spirits angels a great host of angels Supernatural gifts and things vindicating we're on our road we're marching up another place he said look there's great companies of angels up and down here ascending and descending notice what they're doing picking up the weary how many's ever been weary in the journey amen oh man you're just seem like you're just hanging on by by your pinky and yet there's angels that are picking you up they're holding you why God predestinated you to this journey aren't you glad for that picking up the weary and sick healing their bodies showing visions and mighty signs and wonders notice you can't fail it can't slip it can't slide you're safe God said so that settles it every time I read that you're safe it reminds me of the baseball you know game and and they're running around and and every the the other team's trying to get that ball you know and and and they're throwing it you know and then that that guy that runs home safe and he slides in there and that guy says [Applause] safe amen safe well that's what God has done to you you're safe the Lord the enemy was doing everything he can to keep you from home base that's right but in God's you've already made it it's secure and God wouldn't send a preacher God wouldn't send Mom and Dad or some Bishop Amen to to to to hold you up he would send his angels to hold you up and to secure you amen another place he said this latter is hooked around the heart of God of Heaven hooked around the Son of God down here and we're brought into it through the Son of God we Ascend to him see oh my then what are you scared about see this message is a message of Grace this message is to take every fear away from us if we could just believe it what are you scared about our promise our promise everybody say my promise see our promise is hooked between God and Christ every promise that God made you as the bride Christ it's hooked between God and Christ it's it's secure ain't that right he says and we're in between them with angels He said he will give his angels charge over thee and the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him and all up and down when we're making this Foundation climbing each day higher and higher each day brings me one round higher and higher as I move up up up up up Can can you say Amen can I say this don't dread the Future Days Ahead amen don't don't don't dread them you're moving higher it's only taking you a step higher and you say amen that's right move up up up see and anything happens if I fall along the road or something happens to me there's a great host of Angels standing there to pick me up saying come on we're marching up towards Zion onto that beautiful City above aren't you glad that there's somebody there to encourage you amen hallelujah it's an encouragement so he said see you can't fail there's no failing in it no fail say it with me there's no failing in it there's no failing in it see it don't rest upon what I do it rest upon what he did it's already a finished see the believer wants Anor in Christ coming through the door back there put on this highway you can't get any way but straight up to God with it angels to take care of you it was God that made a way for this God made a way for it that's right the Lord your enemies wouldn't have not done this other people may have not done this they wouldn't even given you a chance right they probably said I'll give him a couple days and he'll be back out that's right give give him just a little bit of time and he's going to he's going to go wacko she's going to go crazy just give it a little bit we'll see but see when God started you you can't fail he put you on the right path what's the right path upward with angels ascending and descending L thank you Jesus see we're not alone in this world Amen if you need healing Deliverance salvation the angels of the Lord are here they can you say amen Amen brother Braham said his angels are with you to Bear you up to comfort you Amen to give you Faith to move you along prise the Lord have you ever experienced that sir you just going and give up but something just keeps pricking your heart yeah that's right you just get you just don't know what to do and you just at your ropes in but then something just keeps nudging you that ain't make belief that ain't a willpower them are angels that are nudging you alone keeping you moving keeping that Faith alive you say Amen am baby Moses you know when he was floating there in the Nile he wasn't alone I mean there he was floating in that crocodile infested waters and yet the prophet said there was angels all around that basket keeping that basket afloat Sho them crocodiles them crocodiles wanting that baby so bad but every time they move start to get moving up there was an angel there blocking it turning it around why because that baby was predestinated to be a ruler to be a deliverer ain't that right see so the Angels were all around to keep him safe do you realize the Christian Life is a miracle you are a miracle the fact that you can believe in this unbelieving world you it's a miracle the fact that you can get up and go to church amen when the church doors are open that's a miracle the fact that you can believe in miracles when everybody's saying there ain't no Miracle that's a miracle the fact that you can still lift up your hands in the darkest of hours of your life that's a miracle can you say Amen people that don't believe in miracles they ought to look at us amen and if they' look at us and not criticize our you know the the hinder parts and look at the the miracle of God yes sir Moses you know Israel had their hinder Parts just as much and that's all balam could see but the miracle of it he failed to see the miracle was there was a mercy seat there there was the pillar of fire in their midst there were Angels around them that's a miracle it's a miracle that we can still have faith in all of our faults and failures it's a miracle that we can lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubting it's a miracle you believe that now the New Testament Church they they saw more Angels than did the Old Testament Church and scriptures give an account of angels appearing nuber times to the early church if you just look in the New Testament and you'll see that uh you know Luke the first chapter the angel of the Lord appeared to Zacharias telling him that the Lord had heard his prayer and and that he and his wife Elizabeth was going to have have a baby 6 months later amen the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary and told her that she was highly favored of God and told her that the Holy Ghost would overshadow her and that she would conceive of a child and and and these things in Matthew 2 and 13 the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph the second time and told him to flee to Egypt and uh uh with with the young child and his mother of course we talked about Joseph you know having that dream the angel of the Lord appearing to Joseph in the dream and confirming what you know what what Mary was saying was right along with the scriptures and things like that Luke the 2 chapter talks about the Angels appearing to the the three Shepherds I I think it was three Shepherds or two the Shepherds anyways and and announcing to them the the birth of Christ and and and there you know uh uh an angel of the Lord and the Bible says that with him a appeared a host of angels a multitude and they were singing hosana a glory to God in the highest and uh on Earth peace Good Will toward men ain't that right see it was in Luke 22:43 tells us uh that an angel appeared to Jesus when he was in The Garden of Gethsemane and and there he was uh uh facing death and the worst death that a man could ever uh uh uh face and and yet the angel of the Lord come down and appear to him giving him strength for for this time and Jesus in his flesh he was weary and he was saying oh if it's possible let let this cup pass from me and and and you talk about a burden there amen and and the angel of the Lord come to give him strength yes sir see amen it was the angel of the Lord that opened the prison doors amen for the apostles uh the angel of the Lord appeared to Phillip and the Evangelist and told him where to go and what to do and and and uh the angel of the Lord appeared to Cornelius I believe and told him where to find Peter and and and and then Peter being he he didn't think the Gentiles uh you know uh he wasn't he wasn't ready to to preach the gospel to Gentiles you know uh uh and and it was the angel of the Lord that appeared to Peter there he was in a dream and and he and he saw all this you know vile uh animals and all of that and the angel says eat and he said I ain't there touching that stuff he you know it's unclean he said well how you know don't call what I've called clean unclean you know and and anyway but it was the angel of the Lord that told him to go with the Gentile men that corn Cornelius sent and and and to preach the gospel see so it it wasn't the Holy Ghost as some people would say leading the church Church aen uh leading them or appearing to the Saints it was the angel of the Lord Peter Paul Phillip and and and and many of them had the they had the Holy Ghost and yet the angel of the Lord would appear to them giving them Direction on what to do what to say and where to go and and all of these things well see that was part of the apostolic age do you believe that see so now if we're no longer a part of that Apostolic age then we have no right to expect angels to appear among us we we have no right to expect amen angels to deal with us and to encourage us and then you can say well it was just your emotions it's just your feelings it was just whatever you just thought that and you just you know all that you know the prophet said you're bumping into angels did he not say that you bump into Angels when there's something that quickens you there's something there that moves on you there's an angel you just bumped into him the Lord see so so now if we're not a part of the apostolic age then we have no right to expect God or to believe God to F us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost then it's all a makeup we're just here working our elves up we're we're just a another cult we're just another you know it's just another fling it's just whatever can you say amen and and if they're if we're not in the apostolic age then we have no right to Expect Miracles can you say Amen then you have then then all you've got is to take what a doctor says about you if he says you're going to die believe it and just go dig your grave can you say Amen if if they say you ain't going to make it then just believe it if you feel like you ain't going to make it you're you're just going to succumb to the trials and the and and the things and just believe it lay down and die on because if we're not in that Apostolic age we ain't got no right to expect God to work will come on the scene but if we are in that Apostolic age which I believe we are then we have every right to believe in angels we have every right to believe in the Holy Ghost not only for us but for our children and we have every right to believe that God is going to come on the scene and work miracle I don't know what you are facing this morning but God is a god of Miracles yes he is amen God is a god of Miracles you believe that amen if there was no Apostolic age no such thing as angels and no such thing as Miracles and and and and and the Holy Ghost and all of these things then then the supernatural real would be dead to us as it is so many other people dead people who believe that the apostolic ages ceased then then the supernatural that Unseen World Is Dead to them they just sat in church and rot they just go through the religious duties can you say amen that's right see we see the caral church today and you just forgive me but you know Pentecostal Baptist Lutheran Jehovah's Witness Mormons apostolics whatever is just like Israel in Jesus's day brother R said they're taking the church the Commandments the teaching of the Bible and explained it all away and therefore you make the Commandments of God without any effect think of that preaching the promises of God and yet they have no effect upon the people because by some way you doubted that you changed it well he is the god of Miracles but that was yesterday oh no and you say Amen oh yes there is adoption of sons but that's tomorrow brother R say we're praising God for what he done and we're praising God for what he's going to do and we failed to figure out what he's doing today amen can you say Amen see you make the Commandments of God without any effect the promises of God without any effect you take the word of God and explain it all the way into some sort of a Creed and then you cry where is the god of the Bible that's what the world is looking for is the god of the Bible where are they at where is he well they've explained it away can you say amen he said you've explained them away you took it all away from the people when you tell them the days of Miracles is passed there's no such thing as the Holy Ghost there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as visits of angels see there's no such thing is Miracles and when you do that you explain all the supernatural away from the Bible and you take God right out of the church when you do it by your Traditions amen oh aren't you glad that God would send a prophet to get us away from the Traditions you that's right see you can't know God without experiencing the supernatural because God is Supernatural ain't that right the new birth you can't have the new birth without experiencing the supernatural because it is Supernatural you believe that our experience with God is is Supernatural we walk with the supernatural that's what that means we're climbing up Glory walking with the supernatural in touch with the supernatural healing comes from the supernatural Deliverance comes from that Supernatural Rim do you believe that yes sir our help comes from the supernatural now do you realize that this message that was sent to us by God is of the supernatural amen right that's right it's of the supernatural now think of it if if if there's no Supernatural then how did them people in the Old Testament get healed when they were dying by snake bites right you know what a prophet told us there was a healing Angel a healing angel on that brass Serpent and all the people had to do was look and live amen because it was more than just a natural pole with a natural little figure of a snake there was a super natural element to it a healing Angel was on that on that on that pole that's right see and so they all they had to do was look and live amen see so now you know there are angels of healing the prophet said that have been commissioned by God to us amen angels of healing sure absolutely oh my if we could really understand that God help us then we won't have to look to medication we won't have to look to science and we're not against medication and we're not against whatever I'm just telling you amen and brother Brown if you go look look it up study it up it's because of scientific research and the Improvement of science that man's faith has become slow in the Supernatural yeah right can you say Amen brother but see there is an angel of healing that when the medicine don't work there is a supernatural [Music] Rim you believe it amen how did the people get healed at the pool of Bethesda y brother Brown said there was an angel of healing in it praise the Lord yes sir see so it wasn't the natural that done it it was the supernatural that had come upon the natural you believe that now brother brandom said what what it was it was the angel of Mercy Hallelujah the angel of healing that moved upon that water they could not see it they couldn't see the angel but they knew something was stirring that Ang or that water that's right something was troubling that water ain't that right see and so therefore the people in order to receive the benefits of this they had to run to that water while the healing Angel was there that angel of Mercy they had to run not run away from it it ain't the time to run away it's time to run in what the waters are troubled ain't that right so so now brother Bram says today even now the Holy Spirit I want you to listen now the supernatural power of God is in the Earth how many believes that moving showing things and people run from it instead of getting into it what was this message all about it was the supernatural power of God that was moving upon the Earth and people ran from it instead of getting in it he said see instead of getting into it the word made flesh and Vindicated the very things that he did and promised that he would do does the same things see so it was the man that sit up at the front waiting for the supernatural to move upon the waters that got something from God am ain't that right waiting for the moving of the water the Lord come on now he wasn't lexed about it he had a need that's right and as soon as he realized that that angel was moving upon them water he jumped in not setting back so well I don't know if that is that angel or not that might have just been me thinking about that see so so the prophet said see the moment he saw it moving he pressed to get in in press press can you say amen that's right see now what was it what was it that was on the prophet of God in this day right notice brother Bram said if you look not at the man your brother don't look at the natural just your brother but if you'll look to what I'm speaking about the Lord Jesus and his healing Angel is at the platform amen hallah it was no longer God moving upon natural Waters it was now the angel of Mercy the Angel Healing a angel was now moving Upon A man then you say amen he said I'm not God's Gift the angel is God's gift it came out of Heaven I came from the earth and he came from Heaven down to in Shroud or enclothe an Earthly vessel to speak to Earthly people see that if you would believe on him not on me but on him of what I'm talking of and by doing that God will heal you that healing Angel is in the message right that if you can just believe it not even cancer can you say Amen to think of it if they were there at that pool of water and they saw that angel upon that water troubling the water they saw the supernatural what if they just said well I've got tuberculosis I that that's just too much doctor says I'm going to die there ain't no hope no no no he would have never got it and that's the thing way same way with a lot of people today if they look at the message and they limit God in this message they ain't going to get what they need that's right amen that's right you believe that so another place he said God's gift is the spirit of God that came down in the form of an Angel amen God's gift is the spirit of God that come down in the form of an angel now this isn't a worship of man and it isn't a worship of angels hello amen see but what we are looking at and believing we're looking at and believing what the angel of the Lord has come upon in this last day praise the Lord amen and we're commanded to do that by God look Isaiah 45:22 look unto me look un me and you know brother brandom used that scripture for his opening scripture in in looking under Jesus look ain't that right look unto me and be you saved all the ends of the Earth when now no other time have we been at the ends plural of the earth everything has come to its end politics come to its end religions come to its end denominations come to its end hello the cycle of man the cycle of mortality has come to its end everything is coming to its end that's right and at the end of the Earth ends look unto me why and be ye saved amen amen ain't that right praise the Lord now God has brother Brown said his angel from glory to manifest to his people he sent his angel from glory to manifest to his people the prophetic gift of God which can only bring Faith up into a level to where you can be healed or accept your healing from Jesus Christ is that right another place said if you don't believe me that I've told you the truth you'll never benefit by it that's why you must not doubt this message that's why you must believe this message whether you understand it or not yes sir you can't convince me that a man can understand this Bible more than a prophet can come on now amen can you say amen I know they'll say well well you know brother Bram didn't say this or or the Bible doesn't say this about makeup and they didn't say this about this and this and this so so brother brand must have been wrong so I'm just going to take what the Bible says about it when the prophet says that a prophet is a Divine interpretator of the Divine of the written word right true I will take his interpretation more than my own more than yours more than anyone's I'll take it more than scoffield or more than you know whatever why because I recognize that the healing Angel was on that man hello amen that's right maybe someone's pushing back cuz you don't believe that but it's true can you say Amen now the message everybody say the message the message is where the angel of the Lord is moving you believe it that's right how do you know that because the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always you want you you want to die in your ministry go start preaching Spurgeon hello start start start preaching you know Clarence lens start preaching some other thing outside the message you want you you want your ministry to die start mixing theirs with this message start mixing your own ideas with this message and you'll die and and dry up and and and all this why the angel of the Lord doesn't accompany our ministry it accompanies the message and there's a lot of people that have ministers that have gotten caught up and and lifted up thinking they're the one that's keeping themselves and they've walked away from this message and ain't nobody's can you say Amen but what makes our home the way it is is we follow the message what makes our life the way it is is we follow the message what makes our church Church the way it is we follow the message of the hour because the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always I believe it amen brother Bram talked of a young man who was standing in a meeting where his dad felt that he should go send him in brother bram's meetings and the young man was standing there and the prophet said he saw the supernatural hand of God and quickly he become a Christian he was ready to accept it for he seen the moving of the water and he know there was something Supernatural see it's not a join Church shake hands and a million more in 44 it's not a new church a new building or a new something it was new life that come by a supernatural move that they were looking for it to happen see so they know now he's talking about in the old test or the the the pool of they know every season see then that angel would come down see so they waited they knew that at that season the angel would come and they waited they wouldn't take an impersonation they wouldn't take what someone else says about it they waited for the Supernatural come on church right that's that's that's where we set separated from the the Pentecostals is because the Pentecostals are so gullible they'll take anything and everything and and just gobble it down where a message believer they understand that there is a season there is a timing that God moves he'll move in a church he'll move in a home he moves in our personal lives and we wait for the moving of the water hallu amen so he said see he said see they knew it was going to they know every certain season then it come down and they waited today he said if it isn't going on all the time and we're on the top of the house jumping around see then we say well we'll leave this church see it's cooled off what nonsense how can't see how we can't wait Abraham see he didn't think God had cooled off he waited 20 years CU he knew he needed the supernatural power of God to do it can you say Amen so he waited 25 years and in all of that time he didn't think God cool off he didn't think God denied his word the Bible says he grew stronger in faith the weaker his body got the stronger he got cuz he was waiting he was looking for a supernatural [Music] do you believe that he says and then he says and they waited at a sheep gate from month to month for whatever it was for that one Supernatural moving but they looked for it oh my they were looking for it and today we've lost that Vision Pentecost we've lost something let's look to Christ Our denominations has spread itself till it's went way out and now we're fighting and trying to get more and bigger churches higher classes educ better educated preachers and things and what have we got we've got away from the very thing that God told us to look at what are you looking at he says look and live right that's what we must do if we expect to live right others might might have laughed at them and said oh that bunch of Holy Rollers down there around that pool why they say you know he says it's it's nothing but wind that's moving that well the wind comes down and blows the water back that ain't that always the Skeptics that's right the the angel of the Lord will come down and move up on that water and there's always got to be somebody well I think it's the wind yeah it's the wind you know I saw that little hair move and and you know they're getting excited and worked up about for nothing they're going to get laughed at and and all of that see what brother Brown said but it wasn't to them that was waiting on the supernatural it was the angel of Mercy it was the angel of healing can you say Amen now they may call Fanatics for jumping and shouting and hollering and spitting and slobbering and they might say you're working everybody up but it ain't to those that are part of it amen it's the angel of Mercy it's the angel of healing that has come by our way that's right yes sir they try to get us quiet they try to get us former and you know I mean they' got people in the message that don't even believe coming to the Altar and slobbering and spitting anymore crying it out driede confessions and all that and it might be just a work up mental thing to them but to us that have found the angel of Mercy it's something else is troubling our hearts this message might be nothing to anybody to everybody else but to us it's the angel of Mercy the angel of Mercy calling us out of BBL it's the angel of Mercy that's working upon our soul and changing us from doubt to Faith from impurity to Perfection from Mortal to immortality it's the angel of Mercy that's good yes sir amen you see God always sends an angel of Mercy before he sends an angel of Destruction that's right you understand that church yeah see if you can recognize if we can recognize what God done in this age it was not that he just sent a prophet he sent an angel of Mercy with that Prophet to anoint that Prophet amen it's true that we could receive the benefits of what that Prophet said if we could believe only believe right so he sent a angel of Mercy in Noah's day just before he sent that angel of Destruction he sent an angel of Mercy in Moses day just before he sent that destruction into Egypt amen he sent the angel of Mercy the angel of Mercy think of it in the days of lot the angel of Mercy the prophet said come appeared to that elect in the form of a man the angel of Mercy Lord come walking down the the the the dusty road and Abraham looked at him and recognized him to be God and that angel of Mercy Mercy was given to him here was Abraham dried and Barren amen uh uh uh Sarah amen she she had you know she she actually had a little unbelief ain't that right and and and God said he should have killed her brother Brown said he should have killed her right then for that unbelief but she was connected to a promise amen and there stood an angel of Mercy that would remember his promise that would not remember what she just said amen and and and made fun of him and laughed at what is at the promise he was an angel of Mercy that remembered his Covenant to Abraham and so has the angel of Mercy come in our day when we didn't deserve it amen where vagabonds were nothing we're no good amen we might have laughed at it and we scuffed at it and said oh God how in the world are you going to fix me amen but there's an angel of Mercy that forgets all of our backsliding for gets of all of our unbelief forgets about everything and he stands there remembering his covenant thank God for an angel of Mercy this message is a message of Grace it's a message of Grace To Us amen you ain't going back you're going forward you've always were a Son of God you always was a daughter of God you wasn't saved on any given day you always was saved and there is an angel of Mercy amen you're going to make it you're going to make it Church aren't you glad for that can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord hallelujah bless your Holy Name bless your Holy Name we love you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord for your mercy angel of Mercy oh all you have to do is look and live look and live oh the angels of God are encamped all around us amen because there's a covenant and God remembers his Covenant God not looking at your sin God not looking at your filth not God not looking at your backsliding God looking at the blood of his own son God through his blood cannot see you amen he hears your voice but he sees the blood of Christ can you say amen amen God Made A Way so there it was the angel of Mercy appeared before Abraham and Sarah in the form of a man then he was made flesh in the body of Jesus Christ can you say amen amen and here's them Pharisees live by that law brought up that old prostitute or that adulterous woman they had them stones in his hand their hands going to Stone her to death like the law said and they just happened to pass by Jesus and I just have to know there was Angels guiding that woman guiding them over there Amen to the angel of Mercy guiding her over there amen then they said well what do you say about him this is what the law says now what do you say Jesus just stood there and he looked at them and said ye without sin cast the first stone and he began to write now I don't know what he wrote amen he could have been rotting their their sins amen I don't know but all I know there was something and one by one them Stones begin to drop because they come to an angel of Mercy amen and there when they all left he says where's joh and accusers and she looked around she says I have none he says neither do I condemn thee go thy way and sin no more amen and we've heard the same thing in this age Where Art Thou accuser I have none amen the greatest can the accuser is Satan he's the accuser of the Brethren amen and when the seals was loosed that Bloody lamb that perfect Bloody lamb came walking and take that title deed and shut the mouth of the accuser amen you are free you are a son of God you're going to make it you're The sinless Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ because he didn't send this Angel this Prophet to condemn thee he didn't send a prophet to condemn us it was an angel of Mercy amen that come and begin to anoint that prophet and tell them tell them their sins are forgiven them the Lord tell them they never did it in the first place you think a prophet could make that up looking at a carnal born people people of all kinds of faults and all that how could a prophet look at that that group of people that have been messed up in their marriages been messed up in their lives been drunks prostitutes and all that and he looks at them people and he says but you're The sinless Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ it had to be something greater than a man bring forth a message like that amen can you say amen amen he's appeared just before judgment sits in now notice the same people that believed in God was and wasas of God killed Jesus but Jesus said as you believed in God believe also in me is that right see they were God believers they believed in his father see but they believe but they must believe that he was the son sent from the father and not the father but he was the son sent from the father notice what he continues on to say I am neither father son nor Holy Ghost I am a man your brother with a Ministry Vindicated by a supernatural being not me it's the Angel of the Lord that has come from God to minister these blessings to you Amen Hallelujah Lord you see why we stay so dedicated to the message loyal to the message to preach this message amen I don't care what everybody else does and what they are I'm here for the bride I'm part of the Bride because I know God sent a angel of Mercy for me to call me out by the m message of the hour that's right and what it's doing it's ministering blessings see we're going to need a body change how you going to get it without Mercy can you say Amen we're going to need to escape this wrath that is coming on how we going to do that we're just common born Sinners but there's an angel of Mercy that has begin to talk he began to move upon the Earth he began to move upon a human being amen and ens shroud himself and we've looked and we've lived because we see it's of Goden let them say that we're worshiping a man I don't care I still ain't going to be ashamed of that [Music] picture brother Ram says another place when this anointing comes on me well that's the angel the gift of God which is a messenger an angel sent from God and now it's part of God an attribute of God and then their spirit now and we break from the natural into the Supernatural and then in between here your spirit is speaking to me see and I'm speaking back to you through mortal lips but both to anointing see now if the spirit here that's on me is to bless you not that I can bless you but it can Bless you that's right amen it ain't the man that can bless you it's the angel can you say Amen this is why we're still believing the way we believe it even though brother bram's gone that's right and we're not getting dead and formal and going to relics the angel is still here you're traveling the King's Highway upward and there's a supernatural Rim that is holding you protecting you keeping you inspiring you am praise the Lord amen bless the name of the Lord so what this is is like the moving of the waters to those who believe it's the same Supernatural angel of God moving now notice brother Braham said Angelic beings are ordained ministers of God to come to the Earth to Bear record of God they work through mortal beings just as they did Daniel and back through the ages there ain't that right now so the reason why people can't really truly believe the message of the hour is because they really don't believe in the Supernatural but now as I wind it down now what makes us believe this message Lord I I got a lot more but I I I just realize the time sorry but what makes us believe it because as the angel and we've got the Titan now Elie are going after a bride for Isaac he didn't know who she was didn't know where she would be didn't know what kind of girl she just he didn't know so what a challenge that was to try to pick a girl out of all the other girls for Isaac and he knew he had to have the right one amen so he goes and and and starts looking and the prophet says that the angel of the Lord beat elaser to the well beat beat him about a half hour 30 minutes before elaser got there and he started the angel of the Lord started speaking to Rebecca praise the Lord go to the wh something just nudged her amen you ever just had them kind of thoughts something just pray listen to a tape go here and do this something just whm up in you oh I believe this message it's the angel of the Lord amen that's right and the angel of the Lord moved her see and and he says Rebecca came to the water at evening time he said you get the picture it's the church in this last days the evening time we're not talking about the the denomination and all this stuff we're not talking about other ages we're talking about evening time Rebecca typed you he typed Us in this evening time and there she was the angel of the Lord preparing her heart and he said see uh uh it's the church in the last days evening time the evening lights are here it's the time that the angel of the Lord in a Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac and somehow or another she's move to go to the Waters of life oh my heart is turning over with joy I can hardly preach when I think of that the evening time has come the angel of the Lord's in the message Goes Forth and Woos the Rebecca to come to the Waters of Life what is it it's the moving of the supernatural it's not Frolic I know there there's a lot of Frolic in churches and I know there's a lot of Frolic around the world today but this ain't Frolic when you see these young people dancing and shouting that's not frolic prise the Lord praise the Lord I believe there's genuine in that brother B brandom leaned more to the side of fanaticism than he did the formal side he said I would rather have too much Wildfire than no no fire at all that's right right what he ain't that right so this isn't just another group setting here this morning that's went from one Church to another church or from one Doctrine to another right or that's just changed their mind from one belief to another this is the moving of the waters the moving of the angel of God that has prepared our hearts to believe this message yeah do you believe it amen do you love him amen if the musicians Will Come Bless the name of the Lord you see elaser come and the angel of Mercy come in this age looking for a bride there's so many types of the bride and and to be honest the ones that God uses for to depict the bride aren't good reputation [Music] they really weren't much look at Ruth she coming from a heathen Nation Moab that was was born out of sin didn't know God but yet God would pick her to type us about it and she would say thy God would be my God thy people will be my people thy land will be my land I will I will go with you amen why because God ordained her to type out you and I the real bride look look look at Rahab the Harlot she's another one that would type out the bride that's no not a good reputation just the scum of the Earth but God would pick her and bring her from there into the palace hallu because he would show that there would be a bride just like that he would pick up people that would not be perfect that would not be without blemishes and with all that the only way we could ever be perfect without blemish was to be a blood that he would provide it would be a perfect blood that would wash us and cover us completely perfectly that when God looks at us he can no longer see you at all that's why he'll never see you brother Bill as a sinner you'll never be before God as a sinner again because he come and he bought you he cleansed you then he poured his life into you and then he set you on the path this ladder up to Glory you can never you can never be an enemy in God's sight again you can never be a vagabond in God's sight again you are a son of God and God has made every way for you to make it and you will make it it's a sure thing amen can you believe it can you accept your [Music] pardon you know there's times where I just don't feel worthy I I just feel so beat down my past and I thank God I'm a failure I don't know if you've ever go through all that but Satan just fights my mind I was praying just yesterday I said God help me to accept that pardon help me just so believe it and so anchor that you know and then I just begin to speak to the devil devil you're a liar that's right God's blood has washed me clean you see you can't let the devil fight you in your mind without saying something you got to speak back I'm on my way to the King's Highway I'm on my way to glory and I ain't turning back for no one and if I fail there's angels to pick me [Applause] up if I fall down I ain't going so far that God can't reach down he's already got the Angels because I'm a predestinated seed and sometimes you have to talk to the devil just like that don't you let the devil fight you in your mind without saying something back that's where we get guilty we we let the devil fight us and we just stay silent and we start entertaining this thing and not realizing it's the devil just ripping you from King Kingdom to come you understand what I'm saying see and it's time that we put a notice to the devil and say you know devil I'm not going to entertain them thoughts anymore I'm going to entertain what Jesus said I'm going to entertain what the God said God wouldn't have called me to this message right if I cannot receive the benefits of it but I believe this message and I'm going to receive every benefit of this [Music] message I believe it how many believes it can you just worshiped God this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord we love you father we love you we love you so glad for the angel of Mercy think of it we never know the angel of Destruction but we do know the angel of Mercy even in your darkest hours when it seemed like you ain't going to make it that ain't the of Destruction that's with you it's the angel of Mercy that's holding you blessed be the name of the Lord what song then conquerors Overcomers in this life we've been made more than [Music] Victorious sing it again oh we've been [Music] made oh blessed be the name [Music] of we've been made GL oh we've been made Victorious [Music] Lord can you sing it with faith with confidence we've been made more than coners Overcomers yes we have yes we have we've been made Victor oh yes through the blood of Jesus Christ now notice what prophet said you see brother Brandon was aware of the existence of angels and their presence and he said remember friends I'm not the gift of healing the angel of God is God's gift to send that's the gift of healing I'm just a man that he's the angel of the Lord and he's here standing right here now at the day of judgment you'll find out that angel is standing right here close to my side and that's not a fictitious belief and I want to say to you church it's not a fictitious belief to say that angels are here with us right now that God is in his room that the angel of Mercy is here the angels of God are encamped around that's not fictitious he said you mark my words if you class me and which by Honor you say it and by love you class me to be God's sear remember this on the books of Heaven he's present he said wouldn't you like to live where your conscience that the Unseen worlds right with you all the time to realize when you walk out here and get in your car Angels take their positions to the side of you when you walk up yonder that man so unlovely to you that they holy spirit standing right above you and angels all around you you say is that right brother Brown the Bible said so the angels of God are in compassed camped about those he said they don't go back to Heaven they they just Camp here see he said they sent on missions to watch you through life's journey hallall aren't you glad that God cares amen hallelujah God cares even through our flubs God cares for our mistakes and our shames and our things God cares amen Tru last week I think it [Music] was I took my wife on a little date but we were here in town and we was driving close to where brother Amos lives and sister Lisa lives and car pulls out right in front of us and stops his car died I guess but he didn't he didn't he was going downhill and he didn't stop at the stop signing he come down and we had a slam on our brakes we go down just a little ways by the
