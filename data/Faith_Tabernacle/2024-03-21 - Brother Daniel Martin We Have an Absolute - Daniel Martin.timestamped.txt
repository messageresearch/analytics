[44:22] verse
[44:24] 25 says for David speaketh concerning
[44:28] him I foresaw the lord always before my
[44:31] face for he is on my right hand that I
[44:34] should not be moved therefore did my
[44:37] heart rejoice and my tongue was glad
[44:39] moreover also my flesh shall Rest In
[44:42] Hope because thou Willl not leave my
[44:44] soul in Hell neither will thou suffer
[44:47] thy Holy One to see corruption thou Hast
[44:50] made known to me the ways of life thou
[44:52] has make me full of joy with thy
[44:55] countenance men and brethren let me
[44:57] freely speak unto you of the patriarch
[45:00] David that he is both dead and buried
[45:02] and his uh Seiler is with us unto this
[45:06] day therefore being a prophet and
[45:09] knowing that God has sworn with an oath
[45:11] to him that of the fruit of his loins
[45:14] according to the flesh he would raise up
[45:16] Christ to sit on his throne he seeing
[45:19] this before spake of the resurrection of
[45:21] Christ that his soul was not left in
[45:24] Hell neither his flesh did see
[45:27] corruption amen can can we s can we read
[45:30] that 25 and 26 again for David speaketh
[45:33] concerning him I foresaw the lord always
[45:36] before my face for he is on my right
[45:38] hand that I should not be moved
[45:40] therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[45:42] tongue was glad moreover also my flesh
[45:45] shall Rest In Hope because thou will not
[45:48] leave my soul in Hell neither W thou see
[45:51] thy Holy One to see corruption amen you
[45:54] can be
[45:55] seated amen I just have a really simple
[45:59] thought on on my heart um I I know you
[46:03] all know this but I pray that it can be
[46:06] a blessing and encouragement to you in
[46:08] some way but if I were to maybe have a a
[46:11] title tonight I would like to U maybe
[46:14] titled it we have an absolute and um I'm
[46:18] thankful that we have an absolute
[46:20] tonight amen and U and the absolute
[46:24] according to the Webster dictionary is
[46:27] says it's perfect in itself it's
[46:29] Unlimited in power uh primarily and
[46:33] ultimate and absolute it's the last word
[46:36] it's the amen it's unlimited there's
[46:39] nothing else in its way it's the Supreme
[46:42] it's an it's it's an ultimate amen and
[46:45] if we're ever going to accomplish
[46:46] anything we must first have an absolute
[46:50] now anything tied to uh any great
[46:53] achievement in the world today has been
[46:55] an absolute and uh to every person
[46:58] everything that's been done there has to
[47:00] been an absolute connected with it and
[47:03] man cannot by no means achieve anything
[47:05] until there comes somewhere where they
[47:07] recognize that there is an absolute and
[47:10] there's got to something for It's the
[47:12] final tying post as brother brandham
[47:14] says that absolute it's that Ty that
[47:16] final tying post we can take uh
[47:20] construction for an example when when
[47:22] you are to build a house uh you know you
[47:25] must you must have a blueprint to be
[47:28] your tying post it's got to be your
[47:30] absolute it's got to be something that
[47:31] you depend on and uh that blueprint is
[47:34] the very that you depend on to get your
[47:36] house to be what it was meant to be in
[47:38] the first place and without that
[47:40] blueprint you would just have a lot of
[47:42] guess work you know you you would just
[47:45] say well I I don't know what we're going
[47:47] to do we can put this over here we can
[47:49] put that over there I don't know the
[47:51] original plan to it and then the next
[47:53] thing you know you've got a lot of Chaos
[47:55] in your houses is just an Ever So in
[47:59] ever which way and and uh you know we'll
[48:02] put it over here we'll put the bathroom
[48:04] over here to see what happens you know
[48:06] and and you know even though the
[48:07] plumbing is over here let's put it over
[48:09] here and and it just causes chaos so we
[48:12] must stick to that to that blueprint and
[48:15] um you know and if I were to have
[48:17] someone here uh you know help me build a
[48:19] house you know maybe brother Bill and
[48:21] maybe I asked brother bill that I wanted
[48:23] uh to build a house and and I wanted to
[48:26] put a bathroom they say we want to put a
[48:28] bathroom over here and uh and you know
[48:31] and I begin to start working on it well
[48:33] brother bills has a you know maybe a
[48:35] little question so he walks over there
[48:37] to the blueprint and uh he looks at it
[48:40] and he maybe comes to me and he says
[48:42] well why why are you putting it over
[48:44] here well because I want to I want to
[48:45] put over here well that's not what the
[48:47] blueprint is saying and I can fuss with
[48:49] him I can argue with him I can complain
[48:52] I can do everything I can to to say that
[48:55] it goes here but the solute says that
[48:57] the bathroom goes over there and that's
[49:00] the same thing today and and you know I
[49:03] can I can fuss we gives you the right
[49:05] you know and and and then he walks over
[49:08] there and and he tells me and that the
[49:11] blueprint is our absolute amen and God
[49:14] has given us a set of blueprints today
[49:17] amen he's given us a set of blueprints
[49:19] to follow and there are many people in
[49:21] the world who is reading this blueprint
[49:23] there's many people in the world reading
[49:26] it and not understanding this blueprint
[49:28] so uh uh uh so uh when they begin to put
[49:31] their own ideas they begin to put their
[49:33] own interpretation and and in the end
[49:35] all they've built is fine churches all
[49:37] they've built is fine denominations all
[49:39] they built uh on an absolute a
[49:42] foundation of man's Creeds and ideas
[49:45] amen and what happens when someone
[49:46] doesn't understand a set of blueprints
[49:49] so what we get the architect in there if
[49:51] we start reading this blueprint and we
[49:53] don't understand it we get the architect
[49:55] in there and you said hey you Design
[49:57] This you you tell me what why this goes
[49:59] here you tell me why this goes over here
[50:01] and then and if you can explain it to me
[50:03] then I'll do it I'll be able to I'll
[50:05] begin to catch that Revelation and I'll
[50:07] begin to build according to the
[50:09] blueprint amen and the man who designs
[50:11] the blueprint needs to explain what we
[50:14] don't understand amen and it's the same
[50:16] thing today with the Bible we've got a
[50:18] lot of people giving their own ideas
[50:20] we've got a we've got a lot of people
[50:21] giving their own interpretation and and
[50:23] it's put us all in confusion is what has
[50:26] happened what it's done and and so we
[50:28] needed a a guide we needed we needed a
[50:31] blueprint we needed uh we we what we
[50:33] didn't understand and what we needed was
[50:35] we needed someone who uh wrote the word
[50:38] we needed someone we needed an architect
[50:40] who wrote the blueprints in the first
[50:41] place to come in and explain it amen so
[50:45] so uh so as we begin to
[50:50] uh and so what we needed was that
[50:52] architect the man who designed the plan
[50:54] so what happened what what happened
[50:56] happen we we couldn't understand this
[50:58] Bible we had we had the Baptist saying
[51:00] that that they were the right ones and
[51:01] we had the Pentecostal saying that they
[51:04] were the ones and it was putting
[51:05] everybody in confusion and so what we
[51:08] needed was we needed we needed a prophet
[51:11] to come in this day to explain to us the
[51:14] blueprints amen amen and we needed
[51:19] someone uh to to uh to to dissolve all
[51:23] the doubts amen and and and and God
[51:26] brought us a message that we can anchor
[51:28] Our Lives upon and we can watch it line
[51:31] up with the original word right amen
[51:34] because of this message we now have an
[51:37] absolute amen it's become our tying post
[51:40] and I can tie my family to it I I can
[51:43] tie my time to it I can tie my faith to
[51:45] it Jesus says Heaven and Earth shall
[51:47] pass away but my words will never fail
[51:51] amen that's my absolute amen now uh Paul
[51:54] had a Christ centered life and um uh if
[51:57] it's okay I'm going to take Paul as an
[51:59] example here for for a few minutes and
[52:02] uh Christ was Paul's absolute and but
[52:05] before Paul had a great teacher he was
[52:07] taught under G uh gel um he had a great
[52:12] teacher he was under uh the denomination
[52:14] of his Pharisee background he was taught
[52:17] he was schooled and he was uh uh brother
[52:19] brandham said he had a great background
[52:21] right brother Bram says he was a scholar
[52:23] beforehand he was a mighty man in the
[52:25] scriptures but he didn't have any TI
[52:28] poost but the Sanhedrin that was his
[52:30] only tist was the Sanhedrin that would
[52:33] that would back him up and and a diploma
[52:36] from a great teacher he was a great man
[52:38] in his field but he was waving only
[52:41] thing that he had his absolute would
[52:43] only be as strong as his or organization
[52:46] was that's all the stronger he could be
[52:49] and he was working faithful to that and
[52:51] was taking Christians and binding them
[52:53] and making uh making Havoc of them and
[52:56] even Stone Steven so so we take Paul you
[52:59] know H he was well-learned he was uh he
[53:02] was a great scholar uh he was under that
[53:05] uh uh he was under the teacher that uh
[53:09] that was well known this teacher if you
[53:11] look up his name uh Galeo if I can say
[53:14] it right uh if you look him up he the
[53:16] history tells you all about him and and
[53:18] Paul was under that leadership but it
[53:21] was the wrong absolute Paul had the
[53:23] wrong absolute he become unstable he was
[53:25] persecuted the Christians he even stoned
[53:28] stepen my and and now he was on the road
[53:31] brother Bram says to Damascus with all
[53:33] of his education set under a great
[53:35] teacher and how that he had been taught
[53:38] in all the Jewish religion and yet with
[53:40] all that he was flimsy and did not have
[53:43] the ability to do certain things see his
[53:45] absolute was his teaching his uh
[53:48] whatever gal said that's the way it went
[53:51] he and he become unsteady amen until one
[53:54] day on his way to Damascus to persecute
[53:56] the Christians all of a sudden there was
[53:58] a light and a thunder and he was spitten
[54:01] and he fell to the ground and he looked
[54:03] up and there was a light shining and
[54:05] that same light that led the children of
[54:07] Israel through the through the
[54:08] Wilderness amen that same light that
[54:11] that that that appeared to to Mary it
[54:15] had now appeared to uh uh to to to Paul
[54:20] amen and it come and blinded his eyes
[54:23] amen and it was so promised so real to
[54:25] him until it blinded eyes he couldn't
[54:27] see totally blind with a pillar of fire
[54:30] blazing him right in the face and he
[54:31] heard a voice saying saw saw why why
[54:34] persecutest thou me and he said Lord who
[54:37] are you and he said I am Jesus that was
[54:40] all Paul needed to know once he
[54:41] recognized who he was and he received it
[54:45] and he then had an absolute that would
[54:47] never fail amen he was never the same
[54:50] after that he went straight uh uh from
[54:52] church to church from place to place
[54:54] trying to build up that which he had
[54:56] tried to tear down why his teachings
[54:59] didn't do it for him his knowledge of
[55:01] the Scrolls didn't do it for him amen it
[55:03] was an absolute he had to come face to
[55:06] face with the pillar of fire he had to
[55:08] come face to face with uh Jesus Christ
[55:11] amen but that one time in his presence
[55:14] that one time that light has changed his
[55:16] life amen he started walking different
[55:19] he started talking different and every
[55:21] one of us here tonight needs to come
[55:24] before that uh Pillar of Fire we we need
[55:26] to have a face to face you begin to walk
[55:28] different you'll begin to start talking
[55:30] different amen and when we can surrender
[55:33] our ownselves when we can surrender our
[55:35] own ideas and come face to face with
[55:38] that light right amen we'll start
[55:40] walking different we'll start talking
[55:42] different amen those things that we once
[55:45] depended on will no longer have an
[55:47] effect on our Lives why because we've
[55:49] let the word of God have prance in our
[55:52] lives amen prise the Lord amen no matter
[55:55] how many people would try to come to to
[55:58] Paul and tell him that he was a fanatic
[56:00] and they maybe called him a Holy Roller
[56:02] and told him that he was crazy and and
[56:05] called him this or they called him that
[56:07] he could stand there and take them to
[56:09] back to the place where he had met the
[56:12] master amen he could take them to the
[56:14] place uh he could take them to that
[56:16] absolute that he had depended on to
[56:19] bring them through a shipwreck amen
[56:21] delivered him from being stoned he was
[56:23] uh delivered from a poisonous snake he
[56:26] just
[56:26] shook that snake Into the Fire amen he
[56:29] knew where his faith was amen he was
[56:32] tied down to the word of God Amen and
[56:35] without an absolute our lives would be a
[56:39] wreck amen without an absolute our lives
[56:43] would be a wreck and man it's just like
[56:45] a ship a ship has an absolute yes sir
[56:49] and that ship's absolute is the
[56:53] anchor excuse me now when the ship is
[56:55] tossed ing Waters where easily it could
[56:58] be thrown against a rock or or busted up
[57:01] or it hit the ground where the water is
[57:03] not deep enough and the great swells
[57:04] coming up H will The Flash the ship will
[57:09] turn over it's got to have deep Waters
[57:11] to float in in order for that ship to
[57:13] stay alive it's it's got to be in the it
[57:16] can't it can't go into shallow Waters it
[57:19] can't go it's got to have something that
[57:21] to keep them in that deep amen and if he
[57:26] begins to and and if he goes into the
[57:29] shallow Waters maybe the waves had come
[57:31] and it would knock and beat against that
[57:32] ship and that ship would sank and a ship
[57:35] with the anchor uh brother Bram says a
[57:38] ship with the anchor that Great Mighty T
[57:40] of metal that it drops down a Ste and it
[57:43] goes down and it goes down until it hits
[57:45] the top of the bed of the ocean
[57:47] somewhere in the top of a mountain and
[57:49] that great anchor pulls and the waves
[57:52] Rock the ships till it strikes its great
[57:54] big Spears into a rock and there the
[57:56] ship has an absolute it's anchored where
[58:00] uh might where the waves might toss it
[58:03] about but still that ship can stand just
[58:05] perfectly still where it's anchored
[58:08] because it has an absolute to it amen
[58:11] that ship can be tossed about and the
[58:14] storms can rage on and the waves can
[58:16] just just flood over the ship but as
[58:19] long as there is an anchor there that
[58:21] ship will not be
[58:22] moved oh amen we can put put our
[58:26] absolute in our jobs we can put our
[58:28] absolute in our family when a man and a

[1:00:48] your darkest times amen amen I'm talking
[1:00:51] about an absolute tonight amen amen we
[1:00:54] must always use the word of God because
[1:00:57] there's no other TI poost that's great
[1:00:59] as that because both heavens and earth
[1:01:02] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:01:04] fail what a TI poost oh
[1:01:08] myall if you're if Christ is your
[1:01:11] absolute then let the storms rage on Let
[1:01:14] the Fire Fall let the waves rise if you
[1:01:17] are tied to him in that manner no matter
[1:01:19] what anybody says how hard the per
[1:01:22] persecution gets how bad the storm seems
[1:01:24] to be how it looks and possible for it
[1:01:26] to happen if something has happened in
[1:01:29] you that Christ becomes your absolute or
[1:01:32] any promise in the Bible becomes your
[1:01:34] absolute if you are sick and you are
[1:01:35] praying for healing and something
[1:01:37] Becomes of that strikes that promise in
[1:01:39] the Bible I've got it there's nothing
[1:01:41] that's going to wave you from it amen
[1:01:43] I've anchored my soul in the Haven of
[1:01:46] Rest when all else fails when when when
[1:01:49] everything when I feel all alone I have
[1:01:52] something that I can cleave
[1:01:54] to oh oh my have anchored my
[1:01:59] soul
[1:02:01] amen Amen brother Bram says what the
[1:02:04] Christian needs today in this atomic age
[1:02:07] in this time of uncertainty you need
[1:02:10] something besides just an experience of
[1:02:11] joining Church you need an anchor an
[1:02:14] absolute that you know because he's the
[1:02:17] absolute oh because churches will fail
[1:02:20] and people will fail but Christ cannot
[1:02:22] fail he's the absolute to the believer
[1:02:25] and if Christ is your absolute you are
[1:02:27] tied to him and if he is your absolute
[1:02:30] you are tied to him then you're tied to
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:33] word oh my Christ and the word is the
[1:02:36] same amen now God is going to put us to
[1:02:39] the test to see if we really believe him
[1:02:41] to be our absolute he's going to put our
[1:02:43] faith to the test amen we must know who
[1:02:46] we really have our anchor tied to amen
[1:02:49] he's going to send us tests he's going
[1:02:50] to send us trials he he may send some
[1:02:53] friends or family some someone off the
[1:02:55] street street but but he's going to put
[1:02:57] our faith to the test Amen brother Bram
[1:03:00] says some of them today it's going to
[1:03:02] get more than ever as the days go by
[1:03:04] that we're going to see people with this
[1:03:06] as Jesus said form of godliness and just
[1:03:08] a form it's coming into we've had it in
[1:03:11] the Methodist the Baptist and so forth
[1:03:13] for years and now it's creeped over into
[1:03:15] the Pentecostals and may I say this it's
[1:03:17] creeping into the message amen it's it's
[1:03:19] somewhat creeped into the message ranks
[1:03:21] that we we have people saying oh I
[1:03:23] believe the message but it's time to
[1:03:25] take uh but it's time to take God at his
[1:03:28] word and well I believe the message but
[1:03:31] if you can't find it in what brother
[1:03:33] Brenham says in the word then you don't
[1:03:35] have to believe it oh come on now well
[1:03:38] that's just brother Brandon's opinions
[1:03:39] and well I don't know if he really meant
[1:03:42] that well brother Brandon was using
[1:03:44] psychology brother Brandon continues to
[1:03:46] say now little Roots Will Rise Up from
[1:03:48] off the highway come in and wrap around
[1:03:51] and around that tree and you think it's
[1:03:53] very Innocent but the wrong uh but the
[1:03:56] first thing you know it's got such a
[1:03:57] hold on on you until it pulls you the
[1:04:00] wrong way makes you lean the the wrong
[1:04:02] way and so uh Phil uh uh philosophies
[1:04:06] and things entered among us until it's
[1:04:08] be begin to pull us towards the world
[1:04:11] you take a sharp twoed sword of God and
[1:04:13] cut free from everything and stay right
[1:04:16] on that word cuz that is the ultimate
[1:04:18] that's the absolute to every
[1:04:21] believer amen amen the Bible says There
[1:04:24] Will arise fall false Christ and false
[1:04:27] prophets and we'll try to deceive the
[1:04:29] very elect if it were possible amen I'm
[1:04:32] so thankful it's not possible oh man
[1:04:37] this word is why we press through every
[1:04:40] battle amen as long as we're anchored in
[1:04:42] the word of God nothing can move you
[1:04:45] stay with the word stay with the
[1:04:48] message amen this word is why preachers
[1:04:51] preach day and night and they they're
[1:04:53] tired and their bodies are run down down
[1:04:56] but they keep pressing on because it's
[1:04:58] life to the believer this message is
[1:05:01] life to every
[1:05:02] believer amen this message has put
[1:05:05] families back together this message has
[1:05:08] put set the captives free I've seen it
[1:05:10] I'm a witness of it oh my this message
[1:05:13] can take a ranked Sinner and turn his
[1:05:15] life around no theology can do it
[1:05:20] no uh no uh man's ideas can do it right
[1:05:26] but it's the unadulterated word of God
[1:05:28] that does it amen and that's where I
[1:05:31] place my absolute because it can't fail
[1:05:35] amen amen that's why Paul he was taken
[1:05:38] to Rome to be beheaded he could have
[1:05:40] possibly gathered an army to fight back
[1:05:42] he could have possibly escaped made
[1:05:44] somehow he could have possibly escaped
[1:05:47] his captives but he could look death in
[1:05:49] the in the face and and say oh death
[1:05:52] where is your sting oh grave where is
[1:05:54] your victory
[1:05:56] oh history says that as the guards were
[1:05:58] leading Paul to The Chopping Block as
[1:06:01] soon as he as soon as Paul seen it he
[1:06:03] broke free from the guards and he and he
[1:06:05] ran to the block and placed his head
[1:06:07] there waiting for them to take his life
[1:06:09] why because he had an absolute that
[1:06:11] death wasn't the end it was just the
[1:06:14] beginning oh my many Believers were fed
[1:06:17] to the Lions many were f h burned at the
[1:06:20] steak many were ripped apart many were
[1:06:23] flayed alive why because uh many of the
[1:06:27] women many of the women had their their
[1:06:29] babies just ripped out of them oh my and
[1:06:33] age after age they gladly suffer for the
[1:06:36] gospel's sake why because they knew
[1:06:39] there had to come a final day there had
[1:06:41] to come a final age there one day there
[1:06:43] there had to come to an end of all the
[1:06:45] trials there had to come an end to it so
[1:06:47] they pressed on and they kept pressing
[1:06:49] on they kept passing that Paton until
[1:06:51] now it's finally reached your hands now
[1:06:54] it's up to you to finish the
[1:06:56] race oh
[1:06:59] my and let me say this don't let your
[1:07:01] trials bring you
[1:07:03] down don't let bitterness bring you down
[1:07:06] don't let disappointments in yourself
[1:07:09] bring you down disappointments in others
[1:07:11] bring you
[1:07:12] down Paul says in
[1:07:16] Romans
[1:07:18] 8:35 who shall separate us from the love
[1:07:20] of Christ so tribulation or distress or
[1:07:23] persecution or famine or nakedness
[1:07:26] or Pearl or sword for I am persuaded
[1:07:29] that neither death nor life nor angels
[1:07:32] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:07:35] present nor things to come 39th verse
[1:07:37] nor height nor depth nor any other
[1:07:40] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:07:42] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:07:45] Jesus our lord amen we've got one goal
[1:07:48] in mind and that's Heaven we've got one
[1:07:51] goal in mind and that's to reach the end
[1:07:53] that's that's to see those Pearly Gates
[1:07:56] amen oh my we whether we go by the grave
[1:08:00] or whether we go by the Rapture our goal
[1:08:03] is to reach heaven hallelujah amen we
[1:08:06] must stay true we must never waver to
[1:08:08] the left or to the right we must keep
[1:08:10] our Compass focused on the word keep it
[1:08:13] focused amen the death isn't death isn't
[1:08:17] H the end for our believer amen that's
[1:08:21] why when we lose the loved one we don't
[1:08:23] have to take to the bottle when lose a
[1:08:25] loved one we don't have to take the
[1:08:27] pills we don't have to take the drugs
[1:08:29] amen we don't have to live a depressed
[1:08:31] life we have a word that says we're
[1:08:33] going to see them again and I've
[1:08:35] anchored my soul into that word amen
[1:08:38] that's what's kept us pressing through
[1:08:40] after Mom pass that's what's kept us our
[1:08:42] alive that's what kept us our heads up
[1:08:44] that's why this message has has kept us
[1:08:46] going we've never looked
[1:08:48] back cuz death is not the end hallelujah
[1:08:51] amen it's the beginning hallelujah amen
[1:08:54] as believers we must have an absolute
[1:08:57] yes sir we must have something we can
[1:08:59] anchor our faith
[1:09:00] upon Lord brother brandham says and if a
[1:09:03] man or a woman is filled with the Holy
[1:09:06] Spirit your heart within you will
[1:09:07] punctuate every promise of God with an
[1:09:09] amen that's right now see you must get
[1:09:12] that absolute that's something that's
[1:09:14] real that identifies you with Christ and
[1:09:16] his word yes the word is Christ and you
[1:09:19] must be sure that you can say Amen to
[1:09:21] that word or your absolute is wrong
[1:09:24] you've got it build on some Creed you
[1:09:25] say oh I believe Christ but I don't
[1:09:27] believe that stuff I believe Christ but
[1:09:29] I don't believe this then your absolute
[1:09:32] is wrong your absolute is in some Creed
[1:09:34] and not in Christ because Christ is the
[1:09:37] word
[1:09:39] amen we can take we can be like the
[1:09:42] foolish man who built his house upon the
[1:09:44] sand oh
[1:09:46] no or we can be like the wise man who
[1:09:49] built his house upon a rock and that
[1:09:52] rock being Christ amen that foolish man
[1:09:56] you see he might have built a beautiful
[1:09:57] home he he could have had the finest of
[1:10:00] everything in the world he had the world
[1:10:01] had to offer yeah no matter how
[1:10:04] beautiful that house was oh it was great
[1:10:06] it was big oh he invited his friends to
[1:10:09] come look at it and it was oh it was a
[1:10:11] beautiful mansion you know maybe he
[1:10:13] maybe maybe it was big enough and to to
[1:10:15] have the prayer meetings maybe it was
[1:10:17] big enough to to to to have the young
[1:10:20] people over for a Bible study or or for
[1:10:23] some fellowship you know he may may
[1:10:25] maybe he built that you know as a
[1:10:26] religious man maybe this man was
[1:10:28] religious you know and he he he was
[1:10:31] trying to do God of service and maybe he
[1:10:34] built this big mansion for the glory of
[1:10:37] the Lord you know and yet the foundation
[1:10:40] that he built his house upon was
[1:10:43] weak amen oh uh it was beautiful yet it
[1:10:49] was built on man's tradition it was
[1:10:51] built on man's Creeds and ideas yet it
[1:10:54] was not it was n strong enough to handle
[1:10:57] the
[1:10:58] trials oh it wasn't strong enough to
[1:11:00] handle the
[1:11:02] Temptations amen it wasn't strong enough
[1:11:05] to accept Jesus Christ as the same
[1:11:07] yesterday today and forever oh that's
[1:11:10] what he built his house upon amen it
[1:11:12] wasn't strong enough to accept brother
[1:11:14] brandham as fulfilling Malachi 4 oh it
[1:11:17] wasn't
[1:11:18] accepting it was built for for uh taking
[1:11:22] what brother brandham says is the
[1:11:24] absolute
[1:11:26] oh it wasn't strong enough and yet it
[1:11:28] fell to the ground because it was built
[1:11:30] on the wrong
[1:11:32] absolute amen but that wise man you see
[1:11:35] maybe it wasn't so fancy maybe his house
[1:11:38] wasn't so big
[1:11:40] and you know may may maybe it wasn't
[1:11:44] much to look at maybe it wasn't maybe it
[1:11:46] wasn't big to hold the parties and and
[1:11:49] carrying on and things like that but yet
[1:11:51] him and his family could sleep
[1:11:53] peacefully every night no knowing he had
[1:11:55] built his house on the right
[1:11:58] foundation oh my and how the storms came
[1:12:02] how the trials would come and and The
[1:12:04] Temptations would come and and
[1:12:08] knowing and they beat on that house over
[1:12:11] and over and over
[1:12:14] again yet he could go to bed every night
[1:12:17] and get some rest every night knowing he
[1:12:20] had built on the right
[1:12:22] foundation amen it would be built to
[1:12:24] withstand everything the devil would
[1:12:26] throw at it am amen why because it was
[1:12:28] built on a firm foundation on Christ the
[1:12:32] solid rock I stand all other grounds is
[1:12:35] sink in sand Amen Let Them Thorns rage
[1:12:39] on Let The Tempest blow amen as for me
[1:12:44] in my house we're going to serve the
[1:12:46] Lord amen Let The Trials come let the
[1:12:49] sickness come let the winds
[1:12:52] blow my house is built on a firm
[1:12:55] Foundation right my life is built on a
[1:12:57] firm
[1:12:58] foundation amen we have a right to every
[1:13:01] word of God Amen that's right Hitler was
[1:13:06] Germany's
[1:13:07] absolute whatever Hitler said had to go
[1:13:10] because he had the final say so Pharaoh
[1:13:12] was EG Egypt's absolute they had to do
[1:13:15] everything Pharaoh said because he was
[1:13:17] their
[1:13:18] absolute and brother BR says if we were
[1:13:20] to go down to Egypt today and and and
[1:13:23] look where Pharaoh once ruled in Egypt
[1:13:25] it would be empty and they they've had
[1:13:28] to dig 20 ft down uh just to find where
[1:13:32] he once ruled and they've made some
[1:13:36] historic out of the place and everyone
[1:13:38] that had placed that had placed Pharaoh
[1:13:40] that have placed Hitler as their
[1:13:42] absolute perished with them my what a
[1:13:46] terrible absolute to place your absolute
[1:13:49] into into something that's going to
[1:13:51] perish into something that can't help
[1:13:53] you into something that will perish
[1:13:55] maybe before you will amen they they put
[1:13:59] their absolute in in Hitler and put
[1:14:01] their absolute in pharaoh and so many
[1:14:03] other people today they're putting their
[1:14:05] absolute in Trump today you know they're
[1:14:07] looking for Trump to come back to be
[1:14:08] their Savior and and you know Trump May
[1:14:11] passed and and Hitler they passed and
[1:14:14] yet those people were standing there
[1:14:15] like now they were left without an
[1:14:18] absolute and then they ended up
[1:14:19] perishing with her absolute oh my now we
[1:14:23] have an absolute in our ball game games
[1:14:26] amen football uh for those who know a
[1:14:29] little bit about football referee is the
[1:14:31] absolute for baseball it's the Umpire
[1:14:35] amen is the absolute now sometimes you
[1:14:37] know we don't like his decisions but but
[1:14:40] it's the absolute we don't like what the
[1:14:43] Empire calls out we don't like what the
[1:14:44] referee calls out oh we've seen it with
[1:14:47] our own eyes and we know it was this and
[1:14:49] we know it was that but once the referee
[1:14:51] has made the call once the the the
[1:14:54] empire the Empire the Umpire has made
[1:14:56] that final call that's that's final
[1:14:59] that's the final word once he says it's
[1:15:02] out it's out it don't matter what you
[1:15:04] say oh you can argue with it oh my but
[1:15:09] it's the final say he has the final say
[1:15:12] amen he might say it's a strike or
[1:15:15] whatever he might or whatever it is we
[1:15:16] can argue with him but the absolute in
[1:15:19] that ball game you can fuss you can
[1:15:20] throw your hat out there and protest but
[1:15:23] it's a strike anyhow
[1:15:26] now if we think a minute what if what if
[1:15:27] there was no ire to the game what if
[1:15:30] there was no referee to the
[1:15:32] game amen what if there was no absolute
[1:15:35] in the game the game would be in chaos
[1:15:39] you would have this side coming over and
[1:15:41] and saying they did it and then
[1:15:43] sometimes sometimes when we play
[1:15:45] volleyball you know we some of us say it
[1:15:47] was out and the other on say it was in
[1:15:49] and and so when we're going back and
[1:15:51] forth we we take an elder we take
[1:15:53] someone and we say well you are the
[1:15:55] final you are the final decision
[1:15:57] whatever you say goes so he becomes our
[1:16:00] absolute right and without that absolute
[1:16:03] we have a bunch of chaos amen and you
[1:16:07] know red light is an absolute brother
[1:16:10] Rand says that the red light is the
[1:16:11] absolute to the traffic H what what if
[1:16:15] that red light doesn't work amen what
[1:16:18] what what if the red light went out when
[1:16:19] you get there well one says well I got
[1:16:22] here first and the other one says well
[1:16:23] I'm in a hurry to work well it doesn't
[1:16:25] matter I was here first and next thing
[1:16:27] you know you got someone else coming you
[1:16:29] got a four-way stop and and and it's
[1:16:31] kind of comical when when you get on
[1:16:34] there uh when you get online and and you
[1:16:37] look at other countries uh how they have
[1:16:40] their traffic and their signals it is
[1:16:42] absolute chaos I mean I'm thankful for
[1:16:45] the red lights and the green lights and

[1:17:12] well you have to stop and this one has
[1:17:14] to go there's no absolute to to make the
[1:17:17] decisions amen and it's the same in the
[1:17:20] church world today it's gotten to such a
[1:17:22] jam the the red light must be out
[1:17:25] somewhere and if the Catholic is right
[1:17:28] then the Protestant is wrong if the
[1:17:29] Methodist is right then the Baptist is
[1:17:31] wrong if the Pentecost is right then the
[1:17:34] rest of them is wrong and it's created a
[1:17:36] bunch of chaos amen the next thing you
[1:17:39] know the pope has become their absolute
[1:17:42] the bishop has become their absolute

[1:18:06] this in the church and and it's causing
[1:18:08] a confusion among the people because

[1:18:15] is the way now well well well we was
[1:18:17] taught before that it wasn't well it is

[1:22:09] trials after trial testings after
[1:22:12] testing and yet each one could stand

[1:22:40] just become great and I thought that I
[1:22:43] couldn't bear it anymore many times I've
[1:22:46] wanted to end it all growing up as a
[1:22:48] teenager the teenager life it can be
[1:22:50] hard sometimes and sometimes you people
[1:22:53] just don't understand you it feels like
[1:22:55] as a teenager and and just the pressure
[1:22:57] of life just just just just trying to
[1:23:00] weigh you down a many of times many of
[1:23:03] times sad to say many of times I wanted
[1:23:05] to end it all but there was something
[1:23:08] that kept holding me when I wanted to
[1:23:11] let go there was something holding me I
[1:23:14] wasn't doing
[1:23:16] it it was helping me Faithfully to
[1:23:19] overcome my trials to overcome The
[1:23:23] Temptations that's what the word does
[1:23:26] Amen overcoming fear and
[1:23:30] anxiety that's what the absolute
[1:23:33] does Amen just like a tree that's been
[1:23:35] planted by the water there has to there
[1:23:39] has to come a wind there has to come a
[1:23:41] little shaking so its roots can dig
[1:23:43] itself deeper and deeper into the ground
[1:23:46] can you imagine that if there was
[1:23:48] nothing to move that tree if there was
[1:23:50] no trial if there wasn't anything to
[1:23:53] move that tree back and forth its roots
[1:23:54] would stay on the ground there wouldn't
[1:23:56] be nothing that would shake it that
[1:23:58] would loosen the dirt for him to grab
[1:24:00] deeper in there and if there was no wind
[1:24:03] if there was nothing there it would end
[1:24:05] up shriving up and
[1:24:07] dying oh my but when that wind comes and
[1:24:11] when the pressure of life seems to wear
[1:24:13] down on that tree and and as that tree
[1:24:15] is swaying back and forth that Tree
[1:24:17] finds that that this shaking this this
[1:24:20] trial allows it to move so it's deeper
[1:24:23] so it's Bru can just dig deeper and
[1:24:26] deeper into its absolute it can dig
[1:24:28] deeper and deeper into the ground where
[1:24:31] where one day when the wind comes it
[1:24:33] won't move at all when the when the
[1:24:35] trials seem to come it oh yeah it'll be
[1:24:38] a little tosy and it'll be a little tury
[1:24:40] but but the the but it's strong it's
[1:24:43] build it's absolute I mean you you can
[1:24:45] you can you can take a strong oak tree
[1:24:47] or or whatever out there and and you can
[1:24:50] you can get hundreds of feet away and
[1:24:52] you begin to dig in the ground and as
[1:24:54] you further you go you end up hitting a
[1:24:56] rot you may be in a field and you're
[1:24:58] like where in the world I'm I'm far away
[1:25:00] from that tree and yet I've hit a route
[1:25:03] it's because because over the years over
[1:25:06] the time the testing and the trials as
[1:25:08] it come it was able to it was able to
[1:25:10] build its Firm Foundation it was it
[1:25:12] would begin to to be to build itself on
[1:25:15] a steady
[1:25:16] ground oh
[1:25:18] my and it's the same with every believer
[1:25:21] tonight yes when the Winds of Life seem
[1:25:24] to BU us down and we don't know which
[1:25:26] way is up and we're just swaying back
[1:25:29] and forth in our trials and and it seems
[1:25:32] that God has forsaken us remember there
[1:25:35] is H there the trials are there ah to
[1:25:39] help us dig our faith further in our
[1:25:42] absolute and them trials that
[1:25:45] come begins to shake us not only that
[1:25:48] not not so we could give up hope not
[1:25:50] because not because oh yeah we may feel
[1:25:53] weak at the moment but as you would find
[1:25:55] out as you would be shaken by this and
[1:25:57] as that you would find that if you would
[1:25:59] just take your faith and you would just
[1:26:01] wrap it around the word of God you will
[1:26:03] find that you would become steady that

[1:26:27] patience why because the trials create a
[1:26:30] character in US brother BR says and
[1:26:32] that's why the holy spir and that's what
[1:26:34] the holy spirit is trying to find today
[1:26:37] is character you can't have character
[1:26:39] until you've got faith and Faith
[1:26:40] produces a character and the only thing
[1:26:43] that's going to help us build our faith

[1:31:18] destroyed and God gave no one an
[1:31:20] absolute that was his word and no matter
[1:31:23] matter that absolute was of the saving
[1:31:26] of the people the absolute was of the
[1:31:29] saving of the people Noah knew that the
[1:31:31] world was going to die and God gave him
[1:31:35] the absolute and that was his word now
