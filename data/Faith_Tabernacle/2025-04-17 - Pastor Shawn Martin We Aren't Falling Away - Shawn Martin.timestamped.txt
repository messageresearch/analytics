[29:36] So

[29:43] has been so good to
[29:48] me. And when I
[29:51] think of all he's done and
[29:56] where he's brought me from, I've got so
[30:00] much to
[30:03] thank him
[30:06] for. Now when I
[30:09] look around and see the good
[30:14] things he has done for me, I
[30:18] know I'm unworthy of them
[30:24] all. But his
[30:27] blessings he freely gives. I
[30:31] owe my life to him. I've got so much to
[30:38] thank him for his faith. Ruth and Levi
[30:42] comes and I've got so much to thank him
[30:47] for. So
[30:49] much to praise him for. You
[30:54] see, he's been so good to me.
[31:00] And when I
[31:03] think of all he's done and
[31:07] where he's brought me from, I've got so
[31:12] much to
[31:14] thank him
[31:18] for. Amen. We can't thank him enough.
[31:22] Amen.
[31:28] [Music]
[31:39] There's a grace when the heart is under
[31:45] fire. Another way when the walls are
[31:48] closing
[31:52] in. And when I look at the space between
[31:57] where I used to be and this
[32:00] reckoning, I know I will never be
[32:05] alone. There was another in the
[32:09] fire standing next to
[32:12] me. There was another in the
[32:17] waters holding back the seas. And should
[32:21] I ever need
[32:23] reminding of how I've been set
[32:27] free, there's a cross that bears the
[32:31] burdens. Were the one who died for
[32:34] me. There's another in the fire.
[32:39] [Music]
[32:47] All my debt left for dead beneath the
[32:53] waters. I'm no longer a slave to my sin
[32:57] [Music]
[33:00] anymore. I should have found the space
[33:04] between me and this
[33:07] reckoning. Either way, I will bow to the
[33:10] things of this
[33:14] world. And I know I will never be
[33:18] alone. There is another in the
[33:23] fire standing next to me. There is
[33:27] another in the
[33:30] waters holding back the seas. And should
[33:34] I ever need a
[33:36] finding, what power sets me
[33:40] free, there's a grave that holds
[33:43] nobody. Yeah, that power lives in
[33:48] me. I can see the light in the darkness
[33:53] as the darkness bows to him. I can hear
[33:57] the roar in the heavens as the space
[34:01] between wears. I can feel the ground
[34:05] shake beneath us as the prison walls
[34:09] cave in. Nothing stands between
[34:13] us. Nothing stands between
[34:19] us. There's no other name but the name
[34:23] that is
[34:26] Jesus. He who was and still is and will
[34:30] be through it all.
[34:32] [Music]
[34:34] So come away in the stress between all
[34:37] the things unseen and this
[34:40] reckoning. I know I will never be
[34:44] alone. There'll be another in the
[34:49] fire standing next to me. There'll be
[34:53] another in the
[34:55] waters holding back the seas. And should
[35:00] I ever need
[35:02] reminding how good you've been to me,
[35:06] I'll count the joy from every battle.
[35:10] Cuz I know that's where you'll be. There
[35:13] was another in the
[35:16] fire standing next to me. There was
[35:20] another in the
[35:23] waters holding back the seas. And should
[35:27] I ever need
[35:29] reminding of how I've been set
[35:33] free, there's a cross that bears the
[35:36] burdens. Where the one who died for
[35:40] me, there's another in the fire. There's
[35:44] another in the fire. There's another in
[35:49] the fire. There's another in the fire.
[35:55] [Music]
[35:59] [Applause]
[36:06] Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight? Amen.
[36:09] Can we just stand to our feet as we
[36:11] invite our pastor to
[36:13] come? He was
[36:16] there
[36:19] all the time.

[37:00] all the time.
[37:05] Jesus was
[37:08] there
[37:10] all the
[37:14] time, waiting
[37:17] [Music]
[37:20] patiently in line.
[37:26] He was
[37:28] there
[37:30] all the time with all your hearts now.
[37:35] Oh, he was
[37:38] there
[37:40] all the
[37:42] [Music]
[37:45] time. Jesus was there.
[37:49] [Music]
[37:56] [Applause]
[37:59] shall
[38:01] be in
[38:05] love. He was
[38:09] there
[38:10] all the time. Can we sing that again?
[38:15] He was
[38:19] there all the
[38:22] time. Aren't you glad for that? God was
[38:29] there
[38:31] all the
[38:35] time,
[38:36] waiting
[38:37] [Music]
[38:41] patiently in love.
[38:46] He was
[38:49] there
[38:51] all the
[38:53] time. Sing the last lines. He was
[38:59] there
[39:01] all the
[39:06] [Music]
[39:07] time. Amen.
[39:09] So glad that we have a God that doesn't
[39:13] give
[39:14] up. Amen.
[39:17] And that he patience and waiting,
[39:22] working, pulling. Amen. And here we are
[39:26] today. And uh we can truly say he's been
[39:29] merciful to us all.
[39:32] and um not just when we were sinners,
[39:34] but as we've gone through life
[39:38] and and God's just been good and I'm so
[39:41] glad for that. It's good to be here in
[39:44] the house of the Lord and trust everyone
[39:46] is doing well and beautiful day today
[39:52] and um uh it's good
[39:55] to have mom here. Amen. and uh dad uh um
[40:02] at home. It's been just good to have
[40:04] them here with us. Good to have everyone
[40:06] that was gone over the weekend and uh uh
[40:11] back at home. Praise the Lord. And the
[40:15] uh the musicians can be dismissed. And
[40:19] um if you have your Bibles, we're going
[40:22] to turn
[40:23] to 2 Thessalonians the 2 chapter.
[40:29] Amen. Um it's hard to believe that we're
[40:33] two weeks away from the meeting and um
[40:37] looking forward to a great time in the
[40:40] Lord and
[40:42] um appreciate all the help uh there and
[40:47] putting the tent up and um real blessing
[40:51] and went up really easy this time. So,
[40:54] we really thank the Lord for that and
[40:57] appreciate uh brother Mark. He's uh um I
[41:01] guess we could say he invented
[41:04] uh something for us to make things go so
[41:08] much easier. And uh so we really
[41:11] appreciate brother Mark doing that for
[41:13] us and and u um and appreciate u brother
[41:18] Tim and being patient with us all and
[41:22] enduring and getting us all keeping us
[41:25] straight and uh and just working uh you
[41:30] know he's put his heart into that uh for
[41:33] the past few days and and uh working
[41:37] there and making sure the tent don't
[41:39] blow away. And we certainly appreciate
[41:42] that very much. And um all the the work
[41:46] that is being started. Um uh the um uh
[41:51] the boys uh helping there at the tent
[41:54] starting to hang lights up and the
[41:57] different ones that helped uh putting
[41:59] the flaps up and Sister Kim getting the
[42:03] food ready and uh just uh starting to uh
[42:08] uh come together and the work is uh is
[42:12] full speed ahead. Amen. But we're
[42:15] looking forward to a wonderful time in
[42:18] the Lord. Amen. Uh before we go into the
[42:21] word, may we just bow our heads and talk
[42:25] to our
[42:26] Lord, precious
[42:28] father, as we just humbly bow our heads
[42:31] before you. Our hearts, Lord, to you,
[42:35] God,
[42:36] and realizing that we wouldn't be here
[42:40] if it hadn't been for your mercy.
[42:44] If you had given up a long time ago on
[42:46] us, Father, we we wouldn't even have a
[42:49] chance. But you have proved that you're
[42:53] long-suffering, you're merciful, you're
[42:56] patient. And Father, we're so thankful
[42:59] for that.
[43:01] And Lord, we're just asking that you
[43:03] would just speak to us all, Father, as
[43:06] our hearts are yearning to hear from you
[43:09] and to be more like you, Father. And we
[43:15] know that you desire for us to to come
[43:19] up higher. And Lord, may these simple
[43:22] words that we would have, may it uh be
[43:25] an encouragement to your people tonight.
[43:28] We ask these things in your lovely name,
[43:31] Jesus
[43:32] Christ. Amen. And
[43:36] amen. Second Thessalonians chapter 2,
[43:39] we're going to start at the first
[43:42] verse. But it says, "Now we beseech you,
[43:45] brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[43:48] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[43:50] together unto
[43:51] him, that you be not soon shaken in
[43:57] mind, or be
[44:00] troubled, neither by spirit, nor by
[44:03] word, nor by letter, as from us, as that
[44:08] the day of Christ is at hand.
[44:11] Let no man deceive you by any means, for
[44:14] that day shall not come except there
[44:18] come a falling away first and the man of
[44:20] sin be revealed the son of
[44:25] predition. Amen. Then if you'll turn
[44:27] with me the book of Daniel the 11th
[44:30] chapter a these two scriptures are
[44:34] familiar with
[44:36] us. Amen.
[44:42] Daniel 11 and
[44:45] um
[44:50] 32. But it says, "And such as do
[44:54] wickedly against the covenant shall he
[44:56] corrupt by
[44:57] flatteries. But the people," everybody
[45:00] say, "the people that do know their God
[45:04] shall be strong and do exploits."
[45:08] Amen. You can have your seats this
[45:12] evening. And
[45:14] um if I would have a title, it would be
[45:17] we are not falling
[45:19] away. And um so we read these two
[45:23] scriptures and and we see that there is
[45:27] a people that is going to be part of
[45:31] this falling
[45:32] away. Um the prophet would call it the
[45:35] great falling away.
[45:38] And yet at the same time there are
[45:40] people
[45:42] that are doing great exploits
[45:46] uh because they know their God. Amen. So
[45:51] one group is falling away. They're part
[45:54] of that great falling away. They're
[45:56] fulfilling that scripture. And there's
[45:59] the other group that are doing great
[46:01] exploits because they know they're God
[46:03] and they're fulfilling this scripture.
[46:06] And the Bible says that they shall be
[46:08] strong. They shall be strong. And this
[46:11] word strong means it it's solid, firm,
[46:16] wellestablished. So the people that will
[46:19] be strong, they're they're solid.
[46:21] They're firm, well established. The
[46:23] Amplified Bible says the people who know
[46:26] their God shall prove themselves. And
[46:29] that's that's a a a thing to think
[46:32] about. The people who know their God
[46:35] shall prove themselves
[46:38] strong. Not just say they're strong, but
[46:41] prove themselves strong and shall stand
[46:45] firm and shall do exploits for God. And
[46:49] so again, they shall prove themselves
[46:52] strong and shall stand firm. Now, the
[46:56] scripture, this scripture uh uh speaks
[46:59] of this day and age that we're living
[47:01] in. And so, what a contrast to what is
[47:07] going on all around us. Uh because at
[47:12] the same time that these people are
[47:14] proving themselves strong and are
[47:18] standing u firm, there is a great
[47:23] falling away.
[47:25] and and the and and to be honest, the
[47:29] the great falling away is more
[47:32] noticeable than those that are standing
[47:35] strong because those that are standing
[47:39] strong are part of the bride, which is a
[47:41] very minority as the prophet said.
[47:44] And and so we we find that uh uh this
[47:49] this great great falling away. It it it
[47:53] really it it's speaking of the masses of
[47:56] people who are losing their position,
[47:59] their place. They're they're falling
[48:02] from what they claim to be or where
[48:05] they've uh uh came from and and these
[48:08] things. Now when we think of the the
[48:11] falling away the that's that happened at
[48:14] the well before time even began uh of on
[48:19] the earth um you know uh uh in in the
[48:23] beginning you know before there was such
[48:26] a thing as oxygen and uh before the
[48:29] first molecule was was created and and
[48:32] all these things we find that that Satan
[48:36] Satan Lucifer uh was with God. He was a
[48:39] created angel and um God God gave him a
[48:44] position uh that this position would be
[48:48] next to God. He was above all the other
[48:51] angels. He was more beautiful and more
[48:53] smarter and intelligent maybe than all
[48:55] the other angels. And and uh but we find
[49:00] that he got lifted up in pride somewhere
[49:02] along the line. He he got lifted up in
[49:06] pride became jealous of his creator
[49:08] which was God. And so what he done is he
[49:12] caused division a division. Now he
[49:15] purposed in his heart as I believe it's
[49:18] the book of Isaiah uh that would talk
[49:20] about it that he purposed in his heart
[49:22] that he would be above God. He would be
[49:26] as God and and he would set up his own
[49:29] kingdom and and these things and and you
[49:33] know when
[49:35] when someone you know was set this way
[49:40] when someone gets um a little uh uh
[49:43] disgruntled in their heart or um um
[49:48] little upset or uh you you know uh
[49:52] whatever it it seemed like They they
[49:55] don't do it alone, but they they go and
[49:58] seek help. They they seek strength. They
[50:01] seek people to take sides. And and so
[50:05] this is exactly what Satan done. And we
[50:08] know that the Bible says that he took
[50:11] twothirds of the angels with him. Amen.
[50:15] So he caused the split in heaven. I
[50:17] mean, think of that. I mean, uh uh he
[50:20] caused a a split in the kingdom of God.
[50:24] and and so uh a division and therefore
[50:28] God cast him and and his followers uh uh
[50:33] out of heaven. And in Luke
[50:36] 18:10, Jesus says, "I beheld Satan as
[50:40] lightning fall." Everybody say fall from
[50:44] heaven. So, so this is the uh if we
[50:48] could say it the first um time that we
[50:51] would uh this word fall um would
[50:56] actually happen or uh the the fall it
[50:59] would be Satan himself
[51:01] uh that he would fall from his position.
[51:05] He fell from his position of power. He
[51:08] fell from his position of rank and and
[51:11] and and and and these things and and all
[51:14] the angels that uh that came with him uh
[51:18] uh sided with him, they fell from their
[51:20] their place. And and and so uh uh um we
[51:25] we find that uh um uh that these fallen
[51:29] angels uh are evil spirits. That that's
[51:33] what brother Brandham called them was
[51:35] they're they're evil spirits. and they
[51:37] they are very religious and he says they
[51:40] work amongst the people. Ain't that
[51:42] right? They they have no place in
[51:45] heaven. They have no power. They have no
[51:47] authority in in in the heavenly uh uh in
[51:51] heaven. They've been cast out and and
[51:54] and and and they've turned they're
[51:56] they're evil spirits, but they they they
[51:59] they take um their abode uh uh in in
[52:04] people. And and so then the next fault
[52:06] we we hear of uh is is that when right
[52:11] after or well I say right after some
[52:13] time after God made man in in his own
[52:17] image that uh uh um Satan came along and
[52:22] caused another fall. Ain't that right?
[52:25] and and that fall was mankind. Uh um and
[52:29] and see man man fail uh uh from his
[52:34] god-given position. And and so it it's
[52:38] interesting to see that throughout time
[52:41] uh there have been those who have fallen
[52:44] from from what they from their position
[52:48] or uh from what they were. Uh Peter
[52:51] talked of the angels that had sinned and
[52:54] God didn't spare them uh but cast them
[52:58] down to heaven. They or to hell. They
[53:00] they fell. Amen. And and were cast to
[53:04] hell and God delivered them into chains
[53:07] of darkness to be reserved unto
[53:11] judgment. Ain't that right? Now, these
[53:13] ain't natural chains and all that, but
[53:15] it does tell us that they will never go
[53:18] back to what they were. Amen. Uh in that
[53:21] position that they fell from and and so
[53:24] now they're they're uh they're they're
[53:28] just waiting for their time of judgment.
[53:30] But uh um but but that was an a fall
[53:33] that that Peter talks about the fall of
[53:36] the angels in in speaking to the church.
[53:40] uh Jude uh said in in Jude 5, he says,
[53:43] "I will therefore put you in remembrance
[53:47] uh though you once knew this, how that
[53:49] the Lord having saved the people out of
[53:53] the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed
[53:56] them that believe not." See, so so God
[54:00] saved them and brought them out. But
[54:04] notice he had to destroy them. The
[54:07] prophet said because they didn't
[54:09] continue on with the message. So So what
[54:12] they were they had fallen away from.
[54:16] Amen. They they had fallen away. Amen.
[54:19] Only to be destroyed. Amen. And and uh
[54:23] uh eternally separated. Ain't that
[54:25] right? Amen. See? And so then then we
[54:29] find that Jude right after that uh he
[54:33] talks about uh uh uh that then he talks
[54:36] about the angels who kept not their
[54:39] first estate. And he says, "And the
[54:41] angels which kept not their first
[54:43] estate, but left their own
[54:46] inhabitation." In other words, they fell
[54:49] from their own inhabit uh their own
[54:51] habitation. He hath reserved in
[54:54] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[54:58] the judgment of the great day. Ain't
[55:01] that right? So all through the Bible, it
[55:04] it shows us that from starting with
[55:07] Satan that there was a fall, amen, that
[55:10] took place and Satan fell, the angels
[55:14] fell, uh Israel fell and and we could go
[55:18] on and on uh uh with this, but uh uh now
[55:22] this scripture speaking here, Jude,
[55:24] speaking of the angels which kept not
[55:26] their first estate, uh uh uh has a
[55:29] two-fold meaning. I I I would take it.
[55:32] Brother Brandham said this way in in in
[55:34] and and uh he says see them angels which
[55:38] once stayed in heaven and kept not their
[55:41] estate. See, um, and the way that they
[55:45] were in fell away and now is in eternal
[55:50] chains of darkness, everlasting chains
[55:53] of darkness, kept in this condition
[55:55] until the judgment of the great day when
[55:58] they'll be judged with all the rest of
[56:01] the unbelievers. Ain't that right? See?
[56:04] And and so uh uh uh and and the prophet
[56:08] said these fallen angels, they they
[56:11] listened. Notice how they fell away. And
[56:14] what caused them to fall away is they
[56:17] listened to Lucifer and therefore they
[56:20] fell away from their estate. And in
[56:24] another place, brother Brandham in
[56:26] speaking of these fallen angels said
[56:29] these are fallen angels, Luther, Wesley,
[56:33] Catholic, Pentecostal. See who who who
[56:37] uh um uh who uh not their first state
[56:42] who, in other words, who who uh uh fell
[56:46] did not keep their first estate like the
[56:48] angels did. See, and and has fallen into
[56:53] organization. So, so think of that uh
[56:56] fallen angels in heaven that that fell
[56:59] with Lucifer and now he's saying the
[57:02] fallen angels are are Luther, Wesley,
[57:05] and Pentecostal and all that. And and he
[57:08] says they listen to Lucifer instead of
[57:11] listening to Christ. Amen. And and you
[57:14] you you you know all the way through
[57:16] Revelations uh he says he he that
[57:19] heareth uh uh hath an ear to hear what
[57:22] the spirit saith. Amen. Let him hear.
[57:26] Can you say amen? He that hath an ear,
[57:28] let him hear what the spirit saith. But
[57:31] we're finding that that not everybody
[57:33] heard the what the spirit was saying.
[57:35] that they actually listened, amen, to to
[57:39] uh uh Lucifer instead of listening to
[57:42] Christ to whom they belonged. Amen. See,
[57:45] and so now, Brother Brandham taught us
[57:48] that men are influenced by these fallen
[57:51] angels which are are evil spirits. And
[57:55] he says in one place, twothirds of the
[57:57] earth is in sin. and and more than that
[58:01] which twothirds of the angels was kicked
[58:03] out and those demon spirits come into
[58:07] people and habitate their body. A ain't
[58:10] that right? See, and so uh uh the Bible
[58:14] talks about uh the days of Noah and how
[58:17] that there were men that that did not
[58:20] repent. They repented not. And brother
[58:22] Bradom says about it. He says they they
[58:25] allowed their beings to be possessed of
[58:28] them. see of these evil spirits uh uh
[58:32] they they allowed their beings to be
[58:34] possessed of them and they're waiting
[58:36] for judgment. Ain't that right? So, so
[58:40] uh uh uh brother Brandham uh in speaking
[58:43] of what happened after the Lutheran
[58:46] Wesley and Pentecostal cuz it sounds
[58:49] like sometimes that he's speaking of
[58:50] Luther himself as being a fallen angel
[58:53] and and that's not that's not what he's
[58:55] he's saying but he's speaking after they
[58:58] came after their revivals after the
[59:01] Lutheran revival Wesleyan revival the
[59:04] Pentecostal revival he says what did
[59:06] they do see they sold out to reasonings
[59:09] of wisdom and education like Eve did.
[59:12] See, fallen angels did. See, Wesley was
[59:16] a man of God. But what followed him?
[59:18] Fallen angels got into it. See, what was
[59:22] the angels first? Creative beings of
[59:24] God, but fail for Lucifer's wisdom. Fail
[59:28] for Lucifer's wisdom. See, and you see
[59:31] what they become? fallen angels and
[59:34] organizations from men of God who has
[59:37] went forth to establish truths in the
[59:40] earth. Before that truth could go on and
[59:43] proclamate and get onto the real
[59:45] revelation of Christ, fallen angels come
[59:48] in and took it over and made
[59:51] denominations out of it. Can you say
[59:53] amen? So, so you you can see all the way
[59:56] through the Bible that that this this
[59:58] this falling away is it it's a trait of
[1:00:01] of Satan, amen, that that started in
[1:00:04] heaven and and he's got he gets into the
[1:00:07] unbeliever. He gets into the
[1:00:09] makeeliever. He gets into men and and
[1:00:11] they twist the when God sends a revival,
[1:00:14] when God sends a truth, well, the these
[1:00:17] men possessed of these fallen angels,
[1:00:20] Amen. Well, they begin they get
[1:00:22] perverted in their mind. They they get
[1:00:24] twisted up and before you know it, this
[1:00:26] denomination and this creed and and this
[1:00:28] dogma and and this and and and and and
[1:00:32] before you know it, they they they get
[1:00:34] the people to looking to them and
[1:00:36] believing in in in what they've got to
[1:00:39] say instead of listening to Christ. Can
[1:00:42] you say amen? Now we we find so he says
[1:00:46] see they made denominations out of it.
[1:00:48] They made denom denomination out of the
[1:00:50] Lutheran revival and the Wesleyan
[1:00:52] revival and the Pentecostal revival. Now
[1:00:55] church, I'm going to tell you this.
[1:00:56] They're trying to make denomination out
[1:00:58] of this message, too. But the prophet
[1:01:00] said it will not denominate. It cannot
[1:01:03] denominate because it goes to seed.
[1:01:06] Ain't that right? Amen. And I'm so glad
[1:01:08] that we've already got Amen. the promise
[1:01:11] that this will not denominate. Amen. So
[1:01:15] that that tells us that there's a people
[1:01:17] that will not listen to what Lucifer
[1:01:20] says and will not become subject to
[1:01:22] these fallen angels and and their their
[1:01:26] fallen doctrine and their fallen ways
[1:01:28] and and their their perverse teachings
[1:01:31] and and these things. Ain't that right?
[1:01:34] So they made they took over. He says
[1:01:36] fallen angels come in took over uh took
[1:01:39] it over and made denominations out of
[1:01:41] it. He said now Luther is exactly doing
[1:01:45] the same thing today that he did at the
[1:01:47] beginning. Lucifer at the beginning
[1:01:50] wanted to build himself a kingdom which
[1:01:53] was greater and more beautiful than
[1:01:56] Michael's kingdom. Christ see he that
[1:02:00] was his ambition. That was was his goal
[1:02:03] was to achieve something like that.
[1:02:05] That's what Satan wanted to do. see a
[1:02:08] bigger beautiful more more bigger more
[1:02:11] beautiful more splendid kingdom than of
[1:02:14] Christ. See, and so that was his
[1:02:16] ambitions to achieve something like
[1:02:18] that. And how what did he do it by? See,
[1:02:21] or what did he get to do it by? He took
[1:02:24] fallen angels who who lost their first
[1:02:28] estate. He took that to do it with. Can
[1:02:32] you say amen? Amen. These demonic
[1:02:34] spirits today are working, amen, for
[1:02:38] Satan. Ain't that right? Amen. And and
[1:02:40] they're possessing people. They're
[1:02:42] getting into people. People are yielding
[1:02:45] themselves and just as religious or even
[1:02:48] more religious today than ever before,
[1:02:51] but they're working for the wrong
[1:02:54] kingdom. Ain't that right? So, so he
[1:02:57] says now today Lucifer has got into the
[1:03:00] church and taken away the word and
[1:03:03] injected denomination and he's building
[1:03:06] a church. The ecumenical move that's
[1:03:09] going on now to unite all the
[1:03:11] Protestants together and all together
[1:03:14] come into Catholic and another place
[1:03:16] he's doing it with fallen angels. How is
[1:03:20] he doing it? We we know that this nation
[1:03:22] is the the the uh uh image of the beast
[1:03:25] and Protestantism and and uh uh it it's
[1:03:29] already been prophesied. It's it's not a
[1:03:32] work of God. It's a work of the devil.
[1:03:34] Well, how is Satan uh bringing this
[1:03:37] about? See, he's come into the church
[1:03:39] and and now he's working his agenda. But
[1:03:42] how is he doing it with fallen angels,
[1:03:45] fallen Lutheran, fallen Methodists,
[1:03:48] fallen Pentecostals? See, and lost their
[1:03:52] original estate from the word of God.
[1:03:54] Can you say amen? What Luther taught,
[1:03:57] the L the Lutheran don't even believe
[1:03:59] anymore. And what Wesley taught and and
[1:04:01] was the the Wesians don't even believe
[1:04:04] that or resemble that. The Pentecostals
[1:04:06] don't even resemble. Amen. Even what
[1:04:09] what fell on Isus Street. They're dead
[1:04:12] as dead can be. Fallen angels. They're
[1:04:14] they're fallen from their estate. Can
[1:04:17] you say amen? And and Satan is taking
[1:04:20] this amen uh to to build his kingdom his
[1:04:24] kingdom with he said see uh uh so so
[1:04:28] fallen Lutheran fallen Methodist fallen
[1:04:30] Pentecostals we could say fallen uh uh
[1:04:33] uh it it doesn't matter if they're
[1:04:35] denomination or
[1:04:36] interdenomination they're fallen. See
[1:04:39] anything that is not with the word of
[1:04:41] God. Amen. And is stuck with that word
[1:04:44] of God. Amen. The original word of God
[1:04:46] is fallen.
[1:04:49] Ain't that right? See, but but he's
[1:04:51] taking this, Amen. and going right back
[1:04:54] in to make a great big ecomunical move.
[1:04:58] See, fallen messengers, messengers who
[1:05:00] once stayed with the word but sold out
[1:05:03] their birthrights and joined in with the
[1:05:05] world. The same thing, it's at the last
[1:05:08] days. See, and Lucifer is achieving
[1:05:11] today by man with those spirits in them.
[1:05:15] man anointed having these fallen
[1:05:18] spirits, evil spirits, religious, but
[1:05:22] yet within them working against the move
[1:05:25] of God. Amen. And they don't even know
[1:05:27] what they're doing. See, and so Lucifer
[1:05:30] is achieving today by men with those
[1:05:33] spirits in them that he did with angels
[1:05:36] at the beginning, fallen angels who kept
[1:05:38] not their first estate to obey God. And
[1:05:42] he's doing the same thing today. Can you
[1:05:46] say amen? See, he can't work with a
[1:05:49] person. Amen. That stays with the word.
[1:05:52] But he can work through a person who
[1:05:54] falls away from the word. Amen.
[1:05:58] So this this great falling away, Amen.
[1:06:01] as you can see, uh uh is is a is the
[1:06:04] result of of the working of Satan. Amen.
[1:06:08] And Satan is uniting all of his subjects
[1:06:11] under one headship. And that's his
[1:06:14] headship. A ain't that right? Now notice
[1:06:18] Peter, second Peter 3:17 gives the
[1:06:21] warning. He says, "Yefore, beloved,
[1:06:23] seeing you know these things before,
[1:06:26] beware lest also being a led being led
[1:06:30] away with the air of the wicked fall
[1:06:32] from your own
[1:06:34] steadfastness." Can you say amen? So, so
[1:06:37] this is not something that we take
[1:06:39] lightly. Amen. This falling away is a
[1:06:41] powerful thing. It's a it's a great
[1:06:44] force. And you all know that. And we
[1:06:46] we've all experienced people that once
[1:06:48] was was strong in this message. People
[1:06:51] that once proclaimed the message and
[1:06:54] look where they are today denying the
[1:06:56] very thing that they've uh that they
[1:06:58] claim to believe but fallen away. See?
[1:07:01] And and and so we we see this. So now we
[1:07:04] have a warning. Amen. We've been given
[1:07:07] this warning is is uh see that you know
[1:07:10] seeing that you know these things beware
[1:07:12] lest you also being led away with the
[1:07:16] heir of the wicked fall from your own
[1:07:19] steadfastness. Now in
[1:07:21] 1952, brother Brandham uh um he he said
[1:07:25] this. He said the hour has come for the
[1:07:28] falling away of the church. Notice a
[1:07:31] time where religion would spread the
[1:07:34] around the world without salvation.
[1:07:38] I've never read that before, brother
[1:07:40] Terry. But but that shows us what the
[1:07:42] fallen away is. Is religion spreading
[1:07:46] around the world without salvation? And
[1:07:50] and and we see that happening in this
[1:07:52] age. Never has it happened like in this
[1:07:55] age uh that we're living in. So what it
[1:07:58] tells us is a religion that is spreading
[1:08:01] around the world, but it's a powerless
[1:08:03] religion. And brother Brandham says any
[1:08:06] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[1:08:09] it is powerless.
[1:08:11] Ain't that right? And he says God hates
[1:08:14] a powerless
[1:08:16] religion. Now when God first made man,
[1:08:20] he gave him uh
[1:08:22] dominion. Uh Genesis
[1:08:25] 1:26-28 says, "And God said, let us make
[1:08:28] man in our image after our likeness, and
[1:08:30] let them have dominion over the fish of
[1:08:33] the sea, over the fowl of the air, and
[1:08:35] over the cattle, and over all the earth,
[1:08:37] and over every creeping thing that
[1:08:40] creepeth upon the earth." So God created
[1:08:43] man in his own image, and in the image
[1:08:45] of God created he him, male and female
[1:08:47] created the he them. God blessed them
[1:08:50] and said unto them, "Be fruitful and
[1:08:52] multiply and replenish the earth. Subdue
[1:08:54] it and have dominion." Have dominion.
[1:08:57] Everybody say, "Have dominion." Over the
[1:08:59] fish of the sea, over the fowl of the
[1:09:01] air, over every living thing that moveth
[1:09:04] upon the earth. So they were even to
[1:09:07] have power over that serpent.
[1:09:11] They were to have dominion over that
[1:09:13] serpent. They were they were able to
[1:09:15] have dominion o over uh Lucifer and the
[1:09:19] fallen angels.
[1:09:21] Amen. Over everything.
[1:09:24] Ain't that right? And so so for a time
[1:09:28] man walked uh on the earth uh with with
[1:09:32] uh uh authority. See, he was an amateur
[1:09:35] god. But what caused him to fall from
[1:09:38] that position? You see uh uh the prophet
[1:09:41] said he left the word. Everybody say he
[1:09:44] left the word. See he left the word. The
[1:09:47] word was his
[1:09:49] protection. The word was his defense.
[1:09:53] See the word is what upheld him just as
[1:09:56] it does the sun, the moon, the stars,
[1:09:59] this earth, the universe. Amen. The
[1:10:01] Bible says he upholdeth all things by
[1:10:04] the power of his word. See that? That
[1:10:08] word upheld Adam. Yeah. Uphelheld man.
[1:10:12] Ain't that right? Now, Adam didn't know
[1:10:15] what sin was. He didn't know what
[1:10:18] temptations was. He didn't know what
[1:10:20] sickness was and what mind battles was.
[1:10:23] He had never sinned. He had never had a
[1:10:26] carnal fallen sinful nature. He didn't
[1:10:29] know what it was to have a headache. He
[1:10:31] didn't know what it was to, you know, uh
[1:10:34] uh to go through things. And uh uh he he
[1:10:37] didn't have to battle Satan on a daily
[1:10:39] basis like we do today. See? Amen. And
[1:10:42] and he he he walked in authority because
[1:10:46] the word was his defense. The word was
[1:10:48] his his his protection. And and so
[1:10:52] therefore, there was nothing that Satan
[1:10:54] could do about it. Satan couldn't
[1:10:56] exercise his power. Amen. He didn't have
[1:10:59] Adam didn't have to worry about germs
[1:11:01] and and and lust and he didn't have to
[1:11:04] worry about all these things that that
[1:11:06] we do today. He was fortified. Can you
[1:11:09] say amen? Now, now thinking of that
[1:11:11] word, uh, brother Brandham in speaking
[1:11:14] of the f conflict that started in the
[1:11:17] garden, uh, uh, he said this, God knew
[1:11:20] God knew this great warfare was coming
[1:11:24] on. He knew it between right and wrong.
[1:11:28] He knew what the enemy was going to do
[1:11:31] because he needed someone to build the
[1:11:33] kingdom. Whatever Satan desired to have,
[1:11:36] he needed a people, a man, to work
[1:11:39] through something to do it. And so he
[1:11:42] knew, amen, what the enemy was going to
[1:11:44] do. And he knew just exactly how to
[1:11:48] equip his people. God knew just how to
[1:11:54] equip his people. Can you say amen? He
[1:11:57] said God knew what it took defeat to
[1:12:00] defeat Satan any time, any place,
[1:12:05] anywhere, on any condition. God knew
[1:12:08] that. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:12:10] So, so God knew that. So he gives gives
[1:12:13] Adam the the thing that that Adam needed
[1:12:17] that no matter where Satan came and how
[1:12:20] he came and and in what form he came
[1:12:24] Adam could defeat that devil in any
[1:12:27] place any time under any condition. Can
[1:12:31] you say amen? See, and so he God God
[1:12:35] didn't give man something and uh in the
[1:12:39] beginning say well here why don't you
[1:12:40] take this for now and and and you use
[1:12:43] that and then I will come when I come up
[1:12:46] with something better I'll give it to
[1:12:47] you make you a better man make you more
[1:12:49] fortified no now that that's the way we
[1:12:52] are right we've we've grown in our
[1:12:55] military we've grown in our our weaponry
[1:12:57] we've we've went from you know the uh
[1:13:00] the stone age and and uh the you know
[1:13:03] the sledge type thing and sticks and all
[1:13:06] that stuff to where we got the bows and
[1:13:08] arrows and then from there the musket
[1:13:09] and then the Springfield rifle and now
[1:13:12] we've got you know nuclear and and
[1:13:14] atomic and drones and and we we've got
[1:13:17] so much things. We've improved as time
[1:13:20] has has gone. Ain't that right? But but
[1:13:23] God Amen has never improved. Amen. He
[1:13:27] gave his children the best there ever
[1:13:31] could be right at the start. And brother
[1:13:34] Brown said that was an atomic weapon.
[1:13:36] The word of God. The word of God is is
[1:13:39] an atomic weapon. Ain't that right? So
[1:13:42] So he doesn't leave you defeated. He
[1:13:45] doesn't leave you with something. I know
[1:13:47] this is the greatest battle that that
[1:13:49] we're fighting is in this age. I know
[1:13:52] it's the most deceptive hour, the most
[1:13:54] evil age ever. that none of us are left
[1:13:57] defenseless because we've got the best
[1:14:00] there is. God knew his enemy. God knew
[1:14:03] what his enemy would do. He knew what he
[1:14:05] would be in this age. He knew his attack
[1:14:07] and he says, "I'll give him the best."
[1:14:10] Amen. That's right. So now, now he can
[1:14:14] give us the best to begin with because
[1:14:17] he's infinite and he knows all things.
[1:14:20] Ain't that right? So now he knew he knew
[1:14:24] that not that there might be a conflict.
[1:14:27] He knew that there was going to come an
[1:14:30] a conflict. God knew that there would be
[1:14:33] a warfare. Amen.
[1:14:35] Now, so brother Bram says God equipped
[1:14:39] his children with the right kind of
[1:14:41] ammunition, right kind of an attack, the
[1:14:44] right kind of everything that they had
[1:14:47] need of that would sweep them all the
[1:14:50] way from Eden to the rapture.
[1:14:54] Think of that. God gave them the best
[1:14:58] the best weapon that would would sweep
[1:15:00] them from Eden all the way to the
[1:15:02] rapture. And I'm telling you, we're
[1:15:04] living in a rapture age. We're not
[1:15:07] living living in Eden age. We're not
[1:15:09] living in the middle of the book. We're
[1:15:11] living in the end of the book. That's a
[1:15:15] rapture age. And God gave it. What God
[1:15:18] gave Adam, he gave us.
[1:15:22] Amen. Can you say amen? And brother Bram
[1:15:25] said, "What was it?" The word. Everybody
[1:15:27] say, "The word." That's what defeats
[1:15:29] Satan is the word. It'll defeat him
[1:15:33] anywhere, any place. See, in another
[1:15:36] place, he says, "See the word of God.
[1:15:38] There's no way around it. There's no way
[1:15:40] around the word of God." See, fortified.
[1:15:44] God fortifies you in behind that word to
[1:15:48] where there's literally no place that
[1:15:50] Satan can get to you.
[1:15:54] Amen. See, fortified all the way around
[1:15:57] everywhere. Thus said the Lord. Thus
[1:16:00] said the Lord. Thus sayth the Lord. Thus
[1:16:02] sayth the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord.
[1:16:04] Thus sayith the Lord. No matter where
[1:16:06] Satan comes, you're fortified by thus
[1:16:09] sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord.
[1:16:11] Can you say amen? See, he said, see,
[1:16:14] you're walking, you're talking, your
[1:16:16] business, your associating. See, and
[1:16:19] everything. Put the word of God first.
[1:16:24] Don't minimize the word. Put the word of
[1:16:27] God first. Every believer should read
[1:16:30] this Bible.
[1:16:33] Brother Brown said, "If you want to be a
[1:16:34] healthy Christian, read the Bible."
[1:16:40] God made sure that every every person or
[1:16:42] most most every person, he made sure
[1:16:45] that Americans got it for sure.
[1:16:49] The Bible, this is the most sold book
[1:16:52] ever is the Bible. Ain't that right? God
[1:16:56] made sure that the Bible got into the
[1:16:58] man man's hands.
[1:17:02] Amen. Now, Brother Brham said, "See, so
[1:17:05] put the word of God first." Say, "I
[1:17:09] believe I'll go tonight and this little
[1:17:11] dance just won't hurt
[1:17:13] anybody." Well, could you take Thus Seth
[1:17:15] the Lord with you?
[1:17:18] Can you take Thus Seth the Lord with you
[1:17:20] when you're looking at that phone
[1:17:23] on the internet? Can you take thus
[1:17:25] sayith the Lord with you when you go to
[1:17:27] different places out in the world?
[1:17:30] See See, you got to stay fortified.
[1:17:34] It it it it's a great falling away out
[1:17:36] there. Satan is working double time, but
[1:17:38] he's working through deception.
[1:17:43] You believe that?
[1:17:45] So he says, "See, I believe if I could
[1:17:48] pull this little deal, well, it's just a
[1:17:50] little shade little bit shady, but could
[1:17:52] you say thus sayth the Lord with it?"
[1:17:55] See, always take him first. Keep
[1:17:58] fortified, for he is our fortress. It's
[1:18:01] it's strange. See, so he says, "But do
[1:18:04] you know you have to ignore in order to
[1:18:08] believe the devil's lie? You have to
[1:18:10] ignore and deny God's truth first before
[1:18:14] you can believe the devil's lie.
[1:18:18] Think of that. He He didn't allow the
[1:18:21] serpent to come to Eve before he
[1:18:23] fortified her. He didn't say, "Oh my
[1:18:26] goodness, Satan is working on poor Eve.
[1:18:29] I better fortify her." No, she was
[1:18:31] already fortified.
[1:18:34] She had the ability to defeat that
[1:18:36] devil. That's right.
[1:18:39] So he says in order to believe the
[1:18:41] devil's lie, you have to ignore and deny
[1:18:44] God's truth first before you can believe
[1:18:46] the devil's lie. You have to deny the
[1:18:48] truth first before you can believe a
[1:18:51] lie. See? Right? Have to deny it. See,
[1:18:55] the people that walk away from this
[1:18:57] message, you know what? They have to
[1:18:59] deny first this vindicated word of God
[1:19:03] before they can uh accept the devil's
[1:19:05] lie.
[1:19:07] You understand what I'm saying? Now,
[1:19:09] God's already told us that by his
[1:19:10] stripes, we were healed. Amen. But you
[1:19:13] have to deny that promise in order to
[1:19:16] accept the devil's lie.
[1:19:20] It's true.
[1:19:22] Now, so they they you know, people have
[1:19:26] to do the same thing as Eve did in the
[1:19:30] beginning. Amen. See, now Eve was the
[1:19:33] weak link in the garden. She was a a
[1:19:36] byproduct of Adam. She wasn't in the
[1:19:39] original creation, but she was a
[1:19:41] byproduct. And Satan was able to lure
[1:19:45] her away from the protection of the word
[1:19:48] of God. And the prophet said right then,
[1:19:51] she lost the battle. Anytime Satan is
[1:19:55] able to lure you or I away from the
[1:19:58] promise of God, that's when we lose the
[1:20:00] battle. Amen. True. True. You'll lose
[1:20:04] the battle on your on your on your
[1:20:05] healing. You'll lose the battle on your
[1:20:07] salvation. You'll lose the battle on
[1:20:09] your deliverance. Whatever it is, you'll
[1:20:11] lose that battle.
[1:20:14] When you get lured from the word of God,
[1:20:18] ain't that right? So now, the prophet
[1:20:21] said Satan was standing out there
[1:20:23] shooting his targets, but she said, "But
[1:20:26] the Lord
[1:20:28] said." So notice how that is. So he shot
[1:20:31] his target. shot at his target, shot his
[1:20:33] whatever poison breath the prophet said
[1:20:36] in one
[1:20:38] place and she withtood it and said, "But
[1:20:41] the Lord said,
[1:20:45] but did Satan walk away?" Let me ask
[1:20:48] you, does he walk away from
[1:20:51] you? The prophet said he shot again?
[1:20:55] Yes. Ain't that right? He shot again in
[1:20:59] another way. But the Lord said, but
[1:21:03] Satan raised up back there and said,
[1:21:06] "But just wait a minute. If the Lord did
[1:21:09] say that, just let me tell you
[1:21:12] something." Now he's See, he he's doing
[1:21:14] it again. He's shooting again. He said,
[1:21:17] "See, let just let me tell you
[1:21:19] something." See, you're not wise like
[1:21:21] God. You don't know right from wrong.
[1:21:24] But see, listen. Wouldn't you love to be
[1:21:26] wise like God?
[1:21:29] Why? Eve said, "Yes, I believe I
[1:21:32] would." Uhoh. She should have said, "But
[1:21:36] the Lord said,"
[1:21:38] she should have said, "But it's thus
[1:21:40] sayith the Lord."
[1:21:43] Ain't that right? See why Eve said,
[1:21:46] "Yes, I believe I would." Maybe
[1:21:48] something like that. I believe I would
[1:21:50] would like to know all the wisdom of
[1:21:52] God. I'd like to know what's right and
[1:21:54] wrong. I don't know it. Well, I'll tell
[1:21:57] you. Now he's going to be the
[1:22:00] interpreter. See, now you see. Well,
[1:22:03] I'll tell you. But she said, "But the
[1:22:05] Lord said, but surely you know he's a
[1:22:08] good God. He won't do that." And right
[1:22:12] there, she broke through uh broke the
[1:22:15] hole through so he could shoot.
[1:22:19] And right there, she made the wrong
[1:22:21] step. Right there, she stopped a little
[1:22:24] bit. Amen.
[1:22:27] Come on, church.
[1:22:29] And I know we get weary sometimes of the
[1:22:32] battles, but don't you stop for nothing.
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:37] Yes, sir. See, so the warfare came to
[1:22:40] Eve, came to her to see whether or not
[1:22:44] she would stand on what God had said.
[1:22:48] The prophet said, see, she turned aside
[1:22:50] just a moment to hear what Satan had to
[1:22:55] say. And he painted a picture so pretty
[1:22:58] to her till she actually thought it was
[1:23:01] the truth and she listened to him.
[1:23:06] See, so that's how the first sin got
[1:23:09] started.
[1:23:11] Right.
[1:23:13] And she lost the battle now. God didn't
[1:23:18] or uh intend for us to lose the battle.
[1:23:21] Right. That's right. Are you with me? So
[1:23:24] he said, "See, that's the only thing
[1:23:27] that the devil the devil wants you to do
[1:23:30] is just turn aside for just a few
[1:23:33] minutes."
[1:23:35] Oh my. He works on your reasoning.
[1:23:39] That is true. He paints the picture for
[1:23:41] you. And it could be anything. They
[1:23:43] don't love me. I'm just not accepted. I
[1:23:46] I'm just not wanted in the church. And
[1:23:48] God don't love me. Look where I'm at.
[1:23:50] I'm not even a Christian because I have
[1:23:53] fallen here. and I've done this and and
[1:23:55] he paints the picture. I'm going to die.
[1:23:58] The doctor says I'm going to die. My I
[1:24:00] feel like I'm going to die.
[1:24:04] See, he paints the picture. See, and he
[1:24:07] can make it so real. Now, he says, now
[1:24:11] he he can paint the picture and say,
[1:24:12] "Now look at here. You know, brother,
[1:24:14] you know, sister, if they were the right
[1:24:16] kind of people, they wouldn't do this.
[1:24:18] See, if they just did this right here,
[1:24:21] you know, well, see, he can make it so
[1:24:23] real to you until it becomes a real
[1:24:26] truth.
[1:24:29] Are you with me? He can make it like
[1:24:31] you're lost and until it becomes the
[1:24:33] truth to you. He can make it look like
[1:24:36] you're a victim instead of the victor
[1:24:39] until it becomes the truth. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:44] He can make it look like you'll always
[1:24:46] be sick. You'll always be in this
[1:24:48] condition and he can paint it so real
[1:24:51] till it becomes the real truth to you.
[1:24:57] See, he he he can make it so real to you
[1:25:00] uh until it becomes a real truth. That's
[1:25:03] right. But remember, it's the devil.
[1:25:06] That's right. Everybody say it's the
[1:25:08] devil. See, you you can't overcome until
[1:25:11] we recognize the devil in every one of
[1:25:13] his tricks. That's what a prophet said.
[1:25:19] He said, "I don't care how low down they
[1:25:21] are and how far they've stooped in sin.
[1:25:23] It's your business to put an arm around
[1:25:25] them and lift them up by the love of
[1:25:27] God. Where was you when the dove of God
[1:25:30] lifted you out of the miry clay?" Can
[1:25:34] you say amen? So don't ever stop for a
[1:25:37] second to listen to the devil.
[1:25:41] Amen. Amen. Brother Ram says, "Don't
[1:25:43] don't start to reason it out. Don't
[1:25:47] don't start to reason this word out.
[1:25:50] Well, I've been prayed for. I've I've
[1:25:52] I've said I'm going to be healed, and
[1:25:53] yet look at me. It's getting worse."
[1:25:55] Don't stop to reason it out.
[1:26:00] That's right.
[1:26:02] Don't stop
[1:26:04] cuz it's the devil coming to you.
[1:26:07] There's nothing negative in
[1:26:08] Christianity. Amen. Go ahead. Brother
[1:26:11] Bram says, "The moment you say that
[1:26:12] you're not a Christian," is the moment
[1:26:13] you're not a Christian. See, you've lost
[1:26:16] the battle. The moment you say, "Well,
[1:26:17] I'm not healed. I just don't know."
[1:26:19] That's the moment you've lost the
[1:26:21] battle.
[1:26:26] See, he says, "Don't start to reason it
[1:26:28] out." Because when you do that, the
[1:26:29] devil comes right in. Now, now I I I
[1:26:32] know that you give the devil an inch,
[1:26:35] he's going to take everything that you
[1:26:37] give him. And he comes in by force.
[1:26:41] Don't Don't play with your
[1:26:43] discouragement. Don't play with roots of
[1:26:45] bitterness. Don't play around with the
[1:26:47] gossip. Don't don't don't be part of
[1:26:50] things that the devil can entertain that
[1:26:53] gives him leeway to come into your your
[1:26:56] being.
[1:26:58] Amen. Amen. Can you say amen? You cannot
[1:27:02] reason God. You cannot explain God. You
[1:27:05] cannot understand God. Isaiah 55:9 says,
[1:27:08] "For as the heavens are higher than the
[1:27:10] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[1:27:13] ways and my thoughts than your
[1:27:14] thoughts." We may not understand why we
[1:27:16] go through trials. But it is not to up
[1:27:18] to us to reason why. Amen. All of these
[1:27:21] things out. It's up to us to trust God.
[1:27:24] I don't understand everything that I go
[1:27:26] through. Amen. But the moment that I
[1:27:28] start trying to reason it out,
[1:27:32] you understand what I'm saying? Is the
[1:27:34] moment the devil will try to tell me
[1:27:35] you're not doing any good, you're you're
[1:27:37] a failure, you're this, you're that,
[1:27:39] you're this, you're that. And how easy
[1:27:41] it is to listen to them things instead
[1:27:43] of just standing on God's word and said,
[1:27:46] "But thus sayeth the Lord." Amen.
[1:27:50] Because you start listening to these
[1:27:51] things.
[1:27:53] Are you with me? Yeah. So God says, "As
[1:27:56] as as as the heavens are higher than the
[1:27:58] earth, so are my ways higher than your
[1:28:00] ways. My thoughts are higher than your
[1:28:02] thoughts." So don't think you can figure
[1:28:03] God out. Don't think you can explain
[1:28:05] God.
[1:28:07] You may not understand everything that
[1:28:08] you go through. Amen. Quit trying to
[1:28:10] understand it. Just believe.
[1:28:16] Amen.
[1:28:18] I know that's hard for us all. It's hard
[1:28:19] for me, but we got to believe. Amen.
[1:28:23] Quit trying to explain it. Quit trying
[1:28:24] not to trying to understand it with the
[1:28:26] carnal mind. That ain't the way it
[1:28:28] works.
[1:28:30] Are you with me? Brother Brandon said,
[1:28:32] "I can't explain God." Nobody can. I
[1:28:35] can't explain many things. But the only
[1:28:37] thing I just believe it because he said
[1:28:40] so.
[1:28:44] You will not be able to defeat the devil
[1:28:47] because you understand something based
[1:28:50] on your own knowledge. You figure it all
[1:28:52] out. you'll still not be able to defeat
[1:28:54] the devil. That makes it more easier for
[1:28:56] him to come in. But when you stand there
[1:28:59] and say, "I don't care what I I I can't
[1:29:02] explain it. I don't understand
[1:29:03] everything, but I believe God." God's
[1:29:06] word said this, "By his stripes, I'm
[1:29:08] healed. I don't understand why it's
[1:29:10] taken this long, but all I know, I'm
[1:29:12] healed."
[1:29:13] And stand there.
[1:29:17] Yes, sir. That's true.
[1:29:20] Don't try to. He said, "There's nothing.
[1:29:22] None of us can explain it." Don't try to
[1:29:25] explain it. Everybody say that with me.
[1:29:27] Don't try to explain it. Don't try to
[1:29:30] explain these things. See, don't get
[1:29:33] with these unbelievers who say, "Well,
[1:29:35] now look, your pastor out there, Junior,
[1:29:38] I hear him pray for the sick. Now you're
[1:29:41] all crazy down there. There's no such
[1:29:43] thing as divine healing." Say, "All
[1:29:45] right, there isn't for you then. You're
[1:29:48] an unbeliever." and just rock walk right
[1:29:51] on and know it's just for believers.
[1:29:55] I'm not going to sit there and try to
[1:29:56] explain. Well, now the reason why see
[1:29:59] God does these things in in certain ways
[1:30:01] and and I don't have to explain that.
[1:30:03] I'm just going to stay with God's word
[1:30:04] and said by his stripes I am healed. I
[1:30:07] don't care what you say. It must not be
[1:30:09] for you, but it is for me.
[1:30:12] I believe.
[1:30:14] All right. See, he said, "Well, you all
[1:30:17] say you've got the Holy Ghost. There's
[1:30:19] no such thing as the Holy Ghost." Well,
[1:30:21] just say back, "It isn't for you then,
[1:30:23] but it is for me." And just go on. See,
[1:30:26] we want to just tally around. We want to
[1:30:28] just sit around these unbelievers. Amen.
[1:30:31] And try to make them comfortable. Try to
[1:30:32] make them un understand. You can't make
[1:30:35] people understand. Amen. We couldn't
[1:30:37] even understand a lot of things, but we
[1:30:39] believe it. Amen. We believe it.
[1:30:44] Amen.
[1:30:46] You love the Lord. He said, "See, don't
[1:30:48] reason. Don't try to reason it. It
[1:30:51] hasn't got no reasoning. You just
[1:30:53] believe it. Don't reason a thing."
[1:30:55] Because remember, the only way that you
[1:30:57] can accept God is by faith. It's the
[1:31:00] only way you can accept your salvation,
[1:31:02] your victory, your deliverance, your
[1:31:04] healing, anything. The only way you can
[1:31:07] accept God is by faith. Amen.
[1:31:12] Not by reasons, not by understanding,
[1:31:15] not able to explain. You don't explain
[1:31:17] nothing. You believe something.
[1:31:21] Amen. We're not a bunch of explainers.
[1:31:24] We're a bunch of believers.
[1:31:29] You don't explain nothing. You believe
[1:31:31] something, not what you feel.
[1:31:34] We ain't a bunch of feelers.
[1:31:37] That was Pentecostals. Come on. Had to
[1:31:40] feel.
[1:31:45] Jesus never said, "Did you feel it?" He
[1:31:47] said, "Did you believe it?" That's
[1:31:49] right. You just believe what God said.
[1:31:53] It's your only defense.
[1:31:58] You believe that? Amen. Well, you've
[1:32:00] been praying for your loved ones,
[1:32:01] getting worse. You've been praying for
[1:32:03] all these
[1:32:05] years. How's it ever going to happen? I
[1:32:08] don't have to explain to you devil how
[1:32:10] it's going to happen. I'm just staying
[1:32:12] with the word.
[1:32:14] When you stay with the word, you don't
[1:32:16] have to get weary about things. You
[1:32:19] don't have to worry about things. You
[1:32:21] don't have to be tossed through and fro.
[1:32:24] You just give it over to God. God said
[1:32:26] it. I believe it. That settles it.
[1:32:31] Can you say amen?
[1:32:33] So now how does a man become fortified
[1:32:36] with the
[1:32:37] word? When something changes within him.
[1:32:41] See the carnal man cannot be fortified
[1:32:44] with the word. The carnal mind doesn't
[1:32:46] can't be fortified with the word of God.
[1:32:48] But a man can only be fortified with the
[1:32:51] word of God when something changes
[1:32:53] within him. See, that's right. and and
[1:32:56] and and and so you know brother brother
[1:32:58] Brown said you know he likens it to a
[1:33:00] pig being changed over into a lamb. He
[1:33:04] said you take that he says now that's s
[1:33:06] that's impossible that just hard to
[1:33:08] believe but that's what's happened to us
[1:33:11] believers as Christians.
[1:33:15] There's literally been a change of
[1:33:17] nature, a change of of of habit, a
[1:33:21] change of thought, a change of desire.
[1:33:25] He says, "Our opinions have changed. Our
[1:33:26] desires, our nature, our will has
[1:33:29] changed. Everything about us that we
[1:33:32] used to be has changed. We used to be
[1:33:35] like that pig, but now we've been
[1:33:37] changed into a lamb."
[1:33:42] Can you say amen? See, he says, "Another
[1:33:45] life has come inside of us. Another
[1:33:47] spirit is now in us, and it bears forth
[1:33:51] another record." Yeah. He said, "Your
[1:33:54] old life has to die and the new one has
[1:33:57] to be born again. And then you're no
[1:33:59] more the creature you was at all."
[1:34:02] That's when you become behind the blood,
[1:34:04] fortified with the word. Don't try to
[1:34:06] explain nothing. Just believe it and go
[1:34:08] on. See, God had to change your way,
[1:34:10] change your nature, change your desire
[1:34:13] so you could just simply believe.
[1:34:15] Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] Hope you understand. That's right.
[1:34:20] Believe it. Believe it and go on. Lord,
[1:34:23] I believe. Savior, raise my faith in
[1:34:26] thee till it can move a mountain. Lord,
[1:34:28] I believe. For all my doubts are buried
[1:34:31] in the
[1:34:32] fountain. See, the sinner can't be
[1:34:34] fortified with the word. Amen. See,
[1:34:37] because his nature is is a carnal
[1:34:40] nature. The carnal mind, the Bible says,
[1:34:42] is immity against God. It is not subject
[1:34:46] to the word of God, the law of God, and
[1:34:48] neither indeed can be. But a man that's
[1:34:51] been changed
[1:34:54] can take that word and fortify. He don't
[1:34:57] need new
[1:34:58] explanations. He doesn't need new ideas.
[1:35:02] He doesn't need anything else. He's
[1:35:04] satisfied with the word that has been
[1:35:07] given.
[1:35:09] Praise God.
[1:35:11] Amen.
[1:35:12] Can you say amen?
[1:35:14] A man can be a church member. That don't
[1:35:16] matter. He can be the most educated in
[1:35:19] in the Bible and know the Bible backward
[1:35:22] and forward by knowledge, but that
[1:35:24] doesn't matter. Can you say amen? If he
[1:35:27] hasn't received a new birth, he will
[1:35:29] always side with the enemy when he
[1:35:30] comes. That's right. That's what you
[1:35:33] That's what you're seeing now with
[1:35:35] people falling away from this message.
[1:35:37] They never had a new birth to begin
[1:35:39] with. They never had it to begin with.
[1:35:42] And Satan began to work on them and work
[1:35:45] on them and work on them. And instead of
[1:35:47] sin, but Satan, it's written. Amen. It's
[1:35:49] written. Amen. That vindicated uh uh uh
[1:35:51] that picture right there is vindication
[1:35:53] enough for me, but everything else that
[1:35:55] has God has vindicated this message over
[1:35:58] and over and over and over and over
[1:36:01] again. I'm not going to listen to your
[1:36:03] negative.
[1:36:05] It's written.
[1:36:07] But the carnal mind can never go that
[1:36:09] way.
[1:36:11] It wants to reason.
[1:36:14] Amen. And thus the great falling away
[1:36:18] takes place.
[1:36:23] We are, as I've said, we are in the
[1:36:25] greatest conflict ever known to
[1:36:27] mankind. Now listen, this conflict isn't
[1:36:31] to destroy
[1:36:32] you. This conflict is to see what you
[1:36:35] are.
[1:36:37] Remember, they will prove who they are.
[1:36:41] They shall be strong.
[1:36:44] Right?
[1:36:45] proving themselves of who they are. See,
[1:36:51] un unmovable, established, well
[1:36:54] established.
[1:36:56] So this conflict is to see what you
[1:36:59] really are. It's to see whether or not
[1:37:01] you will stay with the word or listen to
[1:37:03] the devil's lie. Now, God ain't worried
[1:37:06] about his own. God ain't worried about
[1:37:08] losing his own. Jesus already said, "All
[1:37:11] that the father give me, I've not lost a
[1:37:13] one. I will not lose a one. That's
[1:37:15] right. Amen. Another place that the
[1:37:17] Bible says, "And the foundation of the
[1:37:19] Lord standeth sure. The Lord knoweth
[1:37:22] them that are his." All that the father
[1:37:25] hath given me will come to me. So it's
[1:37:28] it's not it's not about, oh, God just
[1:37:31] wondering who you really are. It's
[1:37:33] proven to the devil who you are.
[1:37:37] He might have made them angels fall out
[1:37:39] there. He may have made Adam fall. He
[1:37:41] may have made Israel fall. He had made
[1:37:44] He might have made uh uh the the the the
[1:37:46] the first church fall. Amen. Down
[1:37:49] through the ages. But there is a bride
[1:37:51] in this age that will not fail.
[1:37:56] Ain't going to fall. Ain't going to
[1:37:57] fall. Can you say that with me? I ain't
[1:37:59] going to fall. I'm not part of that
[1:38:01] falling away. We're not falling away.
[1:38:04] Can you say amen? We may be getting few
[1:38:06] in number, but we are not falling away.
[1:38:09] We're just as strong as strong can get.
[1:38:11] We are as that Caleb that says, "I am 80
[1:38:14] years old, but I'm just as strong as I
[1:38:16] was." Amen. When God Moses gave me the
[1:38:18] promise, give me my mountain.
[1:38:23] You believe it? Now, listen. I I I read
[1:38:27] this. I was listening to to Brother
[1:38:29] Brandham today and and and this really
[1:38:31] struck home. But brother Brandham says,
[1:38:33] "Many times, God lets us when we get all
[1:38:37] bound up with the world bound up."
[1:38:40] Notice that many times God lets us when
[1:38:43] we get all bound up with the world bound
[1:38:46] up, he lets the fiery test come upon us
[1:38:49] where we have to make a decision. Have
[1:38:52] you ever been in there sometimes? Not
[1:38:54] not not not
[1:38:57] uh
[1:38:58] um meaning to Amen. We we get caught up
[1:39:02] in things and before you know it, we'll
[1:39:04] slack off on this and we'll slack off on
[1:39:06] this and we start getting carnal. We
[1:39:09] start this. But notice God's love to us.
[1:39:12] He sends the fire our way to make us
[1:39:17] make a decision. H Have you ever been
[1:39:19] there, buddy? I sure have,
[1:39:23] where the fire gets so hot and finally
[1:39:25] you just say, "Oh, God, I want you more
[1:39:29] than anything else. I I I ain't got
[1:39:32] anything to go back to."
[1:39:35] Come on, church. Amen. where we have to
[1:39:38] make a decision. And when we do that,
[1:39:40] the only thing the test can do when a
[1:39:44] real seed of Abraham is standing at the
[1:39:47] crossroads of decision, he makes his
[1:39:50] decision to serve God. It can only cut
[1:39:54] the bands loose and make us free.
[1:39:58] Lordise,
[1:40:02] have you experienced them things?
[1:40:05] Or maybe I'm just speaking Greek.
[1:40:11] He makes us have to make decisions
[1:40:15] just like them angels had to make a
[1:40:17] decision, just like Eve had to make her
[1:40:19] decision, just like Israel had to make
[1:40:21] and just like the people in this day are
[1:40:23] making
[1:40:24] decisions. And yet, when it looks like
[1:40:27] the world has got us, when it looks like
[1:40:29] Satan has able to finally convince us to
[1:40:32] go and walk away, God puts us to a
[1:40:35] decision. But there's something down
[1:40:37] inside that says, "God, I choose you.
[1:40:40] God, I want you. I want life. I want the
[1:40:43] promises. Oh, God, consume me. And only
[1:40:46] the conflict." Amen. The things that
[1:40:48] you're going through can only make you
[1:40:51] loose. Praise the Lord. Make you free.
[1:40:56] Think of that.
[1:40:58] A people that should be world bound,
[1:41:00] should be hellbound, and yet we're
[1:41:02] stronger than ever.
[1:41:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:12] Brother Bram said, "Satan might give you
[1:41:14] a disease. He might give you one thing
[1:41:15] or
[1:41:16] another. How you know it's not God got
[1:41:20] you on the crossroads to see what kind
[1:41:21] of decision you're going to make?
[1:41:26] I know God could heal in a heartbeat,
[1:41:30] but but what what if it's God there
[1:41:32] putting that fire upon you? Amen. To see
[1:41:35] what kind of decision you're going to
[1:41:36] make. See if you're going to cower down
[1:41:38] to his word. See if you're going to stop
[1:41:39] testifying when the symptoms are there
[1:41:42] and the doctor is telling you one thing
[1:41:44] and you're praying and God ain't
[1:41:45] answering. Are you going to stop your
[1:41:47] testifying? Are you going to stop your
[1:41:48] worship? Are you going to stop your
[1:41:50] believing? Are you going to accept the
[1:41:52] devil's lie or what are you going to do?
[1:41:55] It's a conflict.
[1:42:01] I look at believers who have gone
[1:42:02] through things and I see them going
[1:42:05] through things because it's a sometimes
[1:42:06] it's in the physical or sometimes you
[1:42:09] see the fire and the and the things that
[1:42:11] they're going through. It's hot. Yes,
[1:42:13] sir. They magnify more to me as a
[1:42:16] believer because of their stand and
[1:42:18] their faithfulness and their their their
[1:42:21] perseverance than the one believer that
[1:42:23] says, "Oh, I, you know, that claims he's
[1:42:25] believing. He's all that and
[1:42:26] everything's a bed of roses."
[1:42:30] Can you say amen? When the fire gets
[1:42:33] upon us and the and the testing gets hot
[1:42:36] and God allows Satan to put us through
[1:42:38] the meal, Amen. and work upon us in the
[1:42:41] physical and in our spirit realm. Now,
[1:42:43] he can't work upon your soul. That's
[1:42:45] right. That soul belongs to God. That
[1:42:49] soul is sealed up.
[1:42:52] He can work on your emotions. He can
[1:42:54] work on your your memory. He can work on
[1:42:56] your conscience. He can work on these
[1:42:58] five senses. He can work on everything.
[1:43:00] But down in that soul is a germ seat of
[1:43:03] God that just refuses, Amen. to listen
[1:43:07] to the devil's lie. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:13] That's right. I hope this all right.
[1:43:17] The Bible tells us that the bride of
[1:43:20] this last day will
[1:43:21] overcome. The infinite God with an
[1:43:24] infinite mind has already declared. He
[1:43:26] knows the end from the beginning. And
[1:43:28] he's already told us that there will be
[1:43:30] a bride in this last day overcome. She
[1:43:33] will be found without spot, wrinkle, or
[1:43:34] blemish. Which means she will be under
[1:43:36] the blood. Can you say amen? Not because
[1:43:39] she's a sinless bride in the in the
[1:43:41] sense that she doesn't make mistakes and
[1:43:43] she doesn't have blunders and all that,
[1:43:45] but it just simply means she never left
[1:43:47] the blood. She never forsook the blood.
[1:43:49] She never fell away. Amen. To walk away
[1:43:51] from the atonement and walk away from
[1:43:53] the blood. Amen. And counted the blood
[1:43:55] of Christ as though it's nothing.
[1:44:00] She's found her protection under the
[1:44:02] blood. She will be found without spot,
[1:44:05] wrinkle, or blemish. Can you say amen?
[1:44:07] and she will be fortified by the word of
[1:44:10] God.
[1:44:14] Revelations 22:17 says, "The spirit and
[1:44:17] the bride say come." The prophet said
[1:44:20] this, "Listen to God's authenticating
[1:44:22] prophet." Ain't that right? For what he
[1:44:24] says will come from God. and and and and
[1:44:27] I'm just uh uh uh uh just quoting uh uh
[1:44:31] paraphrasing it, you know, and and and
[1:44:33] but he says this, "The spirit and the
[1:44:35] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[1:44:37] same thing." Shows that she never fell
[1:44:40] from her first estate, showing that
[1:44:42] she's never, Amen. given in Satan's lie,
[1:44:45] but she's staying with God's word.
[1:44:47] Whatever God says, Amen. what God said
[1:44:49] through that prophet, she believes and
[1:44:51] she says it. Amen. I know they try to
[1:44:54] get us to quit quoting the prophet and
[1:44:57] you're quoting quotes too much and
[1:44:58] you're this and you're this that. I
[1:45:00] don't care.
[1:45:02] I'll say what a prophet says anytime.
[1:45:05] Can you say amen? I believe what a
[1:45:07] prophet says. Do you believe that? Amen.
[1:45:10] The only reason why that Abraham could
[1:45:12] look for a city whose builder and maker
[1:45:14] was God is because he believed what God
[1:45:17] said.
[1:45:19] If you don't believe what God said, you
[1:45:20] you won't look for such things.
[1:45:26] But she'll stay with the word.
[1:45:30] So this tells us that the bride is
[1:45:33] resisting the devil's
[1:45:35] lie and will continue to resist the
[1:45:38] devil's lie. Can you say amen? In other
[1:45:41] words, see, she's she the only way you
[1:45:43] can accept the devil's lie is disbelieve
[1:45:45] God's word. She's believing God's word.
[1:45:48] She does it by choice.
[1:45:52] She's not considering what other people
[1:45:54] are saying. She's not considering, Amen.
[1:45:56] the fact that people are walking away.
[1:45:59] She's convinced
[1:46:01] in thus sayaith the Lord for this age.
[1:46:04] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:46:08] Say this last day Eve, the bride of
[1:46:11] Christ will not do as the first Eve did.
[1:46:13] Remember the first Eve hybrid the word
[1:46:16] to something else and she fell. It's
[1:46:18] what a prophet said. But brother Ram
[1:46:20] said, "But the unadulterated word of God
[1:46:22] will be born into that church and she'll
[1:46:24] stand like Jesus Christ did with his
[1:46:27] spirit anointing in his word." She will
[1:46:31] stand in this day like Jesus Christ did.
[1:46:36] With his spirit anointing in his word.
[1:46:39] Well then, how did Jesus Christ stand?
[1:46:42] Remember when Satan came to him and
[1:46:44] tempted him? Tempted
[1:46:47] him. Jesus said what it is written.
[1:46:52] Thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:46:55] You say, "Well, brother Ram said he
[1:46:56] didn't have say thus sayith the Lord."
[1:46:58] He just spoke it. Well, you know, you
[1:46:59] get what I'm saying. He spoke the word.
[1:47:02] Amen. It is written. Whatever the
[1:47:05] prophet says, Jesus so believed it, he
[1:47:07] just quoted a prophet.
[1:47:10] If Jesus could quote prophets, we can
[1:47:12] quote prophet.
[1:47:15] Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:47:17] See, so Satan was questioning who Jesus
[1:47:20] was. If thou be, if thou be, if thou be.
[1:47:24] Trying to get him to doubt who he was
[1:47:26] and was trying to get him to prove who
[1:47:29] he was. You see, Satan was treating
[1:47:32] Jesus like a little child.
[1:47:35] Now you all know you get little
[1:47:37] children. You may say, "Oh, you can't
[1:47:42] run fast." Yes, I can. No, you can't.
[1:47:46] And the first thing you know, he's out
[1:47:48] trying to He's running as fast as he can
[1:47:51] to prove to you he can run,
[1:47:55] right?
[1:47:58] You get these teenage boys sometimes,
[1:48:01] oh, you're not
[1:48:03] strong. Oh, yeah. Oh my. And they'll go
[1:48:07] pick the heaviest thing up. Jesus. They
[1:48:11] don't care about it breaking their back.
[1:48:12] They're just out to prove they're
[1:48:14] strong. Yeah. Right. There. There's some
[1:48:19] guys that still that way in their 30s
[1:48:21] and 40s and 50s.
[1:48:24] Still prove it after they're the man of
[1:48:26] the hour.
[1:48:28] I ain't got to prove nothing. I just
[1:48:31] give them the sledgehammer and let them
[1:48:33] do it. Right.
[1:48:35] Yeah. I just give them the gloves and
[1:48:37] let them pick it up and just say, "Don't
[1:48:39] hurt your back." "Hurt my back? What do
[1:48:41] you mean? That hurts the ego."
[1:48:45] But they're out to prove they're
[1:48:49] tough. See, and and Satan was thinking
[1:48:52] Jesus was just like that little child.
[1:48:55] If thou be, prove it. I don't think you
[1:48:57] are. So, prove it to me. But Jesus
[1:49:01] didn't have to prove nothing.
[1:49:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:49:07] Can you say amen?
[1:49:10] See, so he tried to that with Christ,
[1:49:13] but he soon realized, notice, he soon
[1:49:16] realized that Jesus knew who he
[1:49:19] was. Jesus didn't have to heal the sick
[1:49:22] to prove that he was the Messiah.
[1:49:27] That's not why he healed the sick.
[1:49:31] He didn't make the bread or turn the
[1:49:33] water into wine to prove that he was it.
[1:49:36] He knew he was it.
[1:49:40] Praise the Lord. Can you say amen? So he
[1:49:43] knew that he didn't have to prove
[1:49:45] nothing to the devil. Notice the prophet
[1:49:47] said he relied upon what he was.
[1:49:51] Are you with me now?
[1:49:53] Why? He was the word. Amen. He relied
[1:49:57] upon what he was. He relied in knowing
[1:50:01] that he was the word and he had faith in
[1:50:05] God who made him the word.
[1:50:09] He was God the word and they was in him
[1:50:13] and that gave him faith because he
[1:50:16] understood his position.
[1:50:19] Not understood by carnal mind,
[1:50:22] understood by revelation.
[1:50:24] Amen.
[1:50:26] He knowed what he was because the
[1:50:29] scripture said,
[1:50:34] "Ain't that right? He was this." And
[1:50:38] here, every scripture tied in to prove
[1:50:41] that he was exactly what the scripture
[1:50:44] said he would be. And he knew what he
[1:50:47] was. Therefore, he relied upon what God
[1:50:50] made him. He didn't have to prove
[1:50:52] nothing. He was confident in who he was.
[1:50:56] He relied upon the word of what the word
[1:50:58] the prophet said he what he was.
[1:51:02] Are you with me? Fortified, right?
[1:51:06] So he a he overcome the devil with the
[1:51:10] word that had been revealed to him.
[1:51:14] He had an understanding
[1:51:17] of what the word said about him.
[1:51:20] Sure did. Can you say amen? Now, if he
[1:51:22] was one that was wondering who he was,
[1:51:24] if he was wondering, you know, you know,
[1:51:26] if he was the one that was tossed to and
[1:51:29] fro and upsy turvy and and and you know,
[1:51:32] and oh, oh, God, I I don't know if I'm
[1:51:35] really that Messiah, would you would you
[1:51:36] just would you would you show me? Would
[1:51:39] you give let me feel it? Would you let
[1:51:41] me do this? Well, then it would have
[1:51:42] been a different story. Come on.
[1:51:48] But he relied upon what he was.
[1:51:51] He didn't need need a new revelation. He
[1:51:53] didn't need somebody to lay hands on him
[1:51:55] and and and prophesy over him and have a
[1:51:58] dream of him and a vision of him. The
[1:52:00] word said what he was
[1:52:03] and he believed it.
[1:52:06] That's it. Are you with me?
[1:52:10] See, now Satan has proved that he has
[1:52:13] knowledge of the word. For he quoted
[1:52:15] what he God said to Eve, did he not? He
[1:52:18] quoted verbatim what God said to Eve.
[1:52:21] And now there at at Jesus when he
[1:52:24] tempted Jesus, he quoted the scripture
[1:52:27] to
[1:52:28] Jesus. He wasn't the word, but he was
[1:52:32] quoting the word to the one that was the
[1:52:35] word.
[1:52:37] He He had knowledge. He had knowledge of
[1:52:39] what that Bible says. He still does.
[1:52:44] Ain't that right? So he knows the word
[1:52:46] of God. But Jesus knew the word
[1:52:50] differently than the way Satan knew the
[1:52:53] word. Satan knew the word by knowledge.
[1:52:58] Right? Now notice, Brother Brandham
[1:53:00] said, "Satan knew the word." Oh, now he
[1:53:03] could quote that scripture, boy, just
[1:53:04] like a walking
[1:53:06] Bible. He could just quote it like that.
[1:53:09] But Jesus stood still for he knew where
[1:53:12] he was standing. Amen. He knowed that he
[1:53:16] was
[1:53:16] predestinated. He knowed he was the lamb
[1:53:19] slain before the foundation of the
[1:53:21] world. He knowed he was that person. Oh,
[1:53:24] oh, brother. He says, "He that has an
[1:53:26] ear, let him hear." He know that he was
[1:53:30] predestinated for that. And that's the
[1:53:32] way he knew the word.
[1:53:37] just not by knowledge, but he knew the
[1:53:40] word in a way that he could see himself
[1:53:43] in the
[1:53:44] book. Yes, sir.
[1:53:48] He knew his position. Satan knew it by
[1:53:51] wisdom and it failed. He quoted the same
[1:53:54] word Jesus quoted the same Bible. He
[1:53:57] quoted from Psalms. See, he will give.
[1:54:00] It's written. Satan said he will give
[1:54:01] his angels charge concerning you, lest
[1:54:03] at any time you dash your foot against a
[1:54:05] stone and they bear thee up. But Jesus
[1:54:08] said, "And it's also written." See,
[1:54:11] Satan knowed it by knowledge. But Jesus
[1:54:13] knowed it by experience. He know it by
[1:54:15] revelation. He knowed that he was that
[1:54:18] son of God that was to come into the
[1:54:20] world. He knowed his standing. He knowed
[1:54:22] he was born in this world for that
[1:54:24] purpose. And that's the reason the word
[1:54:26] of God could work through him because he
[1:54:29] knowed what he was.
[1:54:31] Another place he said he had faith in
[1:54:33] what he was. And if you are a believer,
[1:54:35] you have faith in what you are. How do I
[1:54:38] know what I am? The word says what I am.
[1:54:42] And I rely upon that as a believer.
[1:54:45] Oh, do you love him?
[1:54:48] Oh, I hope you understand. I'm I'm going
[1:54:49] to quote or quit. But brother Brandham
[1:54:53] said, "Now see the Bible, well, Paul
[1:54:56] tells us in Ephesians that God chose us
[1:54:59] before the foundation of the world." Do
[1:55:00] you believe that? He he he chose us in
[1:55:04] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:55:05] world. Brother Brandon picks up on that
[1:55:07] and says, "Now there was some part of
[1:55:09] me, Orman Neville, and the rest of you
[1:55:11] all here that's in Christ Jesus before
[1:55:13] the world began." And here's to my
[1:55:15] analysis of that. I think that the
[1:55:18] people today that are possessed with
[1:55:19] this spirit or the spirit, a part of
[1:55:21] these angelic beings, spirits which
[1:55:24] rotated off God that never fell in the
[1:55:27] beginning and resist resisted the
[1:55:29] devil's lie in heaven.
[1:55:33] So you've got representation.
[1:55:38] Can you say amen? In God's mind, you
[1:55:40] never fail.
[1:55:43] You resisted the devil's lie. Amen.
[1:55:47] Amen. Can you say amen? Now, here we are
[1:55:50] in this body of sinful flesh. The
[1:55:53] battles and the temptations and all that
[1:55:55] proven to the devil that we aren't like
[1:55:58] Eve.
[1:56:00] We aren't like the fallen angels.
[1:56:03] We aren't like all those that have
[1:56:04] fallen away. And we aren't like those
[1:56:06] that are falling away in this great
[1:56:08] falling away. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:56:12] See, listening to the lies of the devil,
[1:56:15] we and and and but we are the bride of
[1:56:18] Christ, standing strong. Hallelujah.
[1:56:22] Standing like Jesus did. Amen. Can you
[1:56:25] say amen? Lord. Now, we're not facing
[1:56:28] the devil like Eve
[1:56:34] did. She faced him without having a
[1:56:37] sinful nature.
[1:56:40] She faced him without know having known
[1:56:42] sin. She wasn't dealing with symptoms
[1:56:45] and pain and anguish. She wasn't dealing
[1:56:48] with loneliness and a broken heart. She
[1:56:50] wasn't dealing dealing with nervousness
[1:56:52] and heart condition and Parkinson's and
[1:56:55] arthritis and and and bone disease and
[1:56:59] cancer and mental ill all these things.
[1:57:02] See, she but all the same all the same
[1:57:05] she listened to the lie of the devil by
[1:57:07] reasoning. Think about that. Amen. Ain't
[1:57:11] that right?
[1:57:13] That is true. Now, I'll tell you, the
[1:57:15] devil will use the doctor's report
[1:57:17] against you. Sure, he can. He will use
[1:57:21] your feelings against you. He will use
[1:57:24] the symptoms that you have against you.
[1:57:27] He will use what the neighbor said
[1:57:28] against you. He will use the events of
[1:57:31] the day against you of what happened. He
[1:57:34] will use things against you. Can you say
[1:57:36] amen? He will even use facts against
[1:57:39] you. And as if the musicians will come,
[1:57:42] I'll give you a hope that I am
[1:57:48] closing. He will use facts against you.
[1:57:52] Now, I was listening to wisdom versus
[1:57:54] faith. I've been listening to that this
[1:57:56] week.
[1:58:00] But brother Brandman talking that in
[1:58:03] that message and he's talked about it
[1:58:04] several times, but he talked about the
[1:58:08] vision that God gave him of killing the
[1:58:11] caribou and that uh silver tip grizzly
[1:58:17] bear
[1:58:21] and he was supposed to went overseas and
[1:58:24] it didn't work out. God gave him the
[1:58:26] vision or dream already showed him that
[1:58:29] it wouldn't work out. Da da
[1:58:31] da. And God sent him. He said, "God sent
[1:58:34] me to British
[1:58:36] Columbia." And he went on a hunt. And he
[1:58:39] knew he knew that this was the trip.
[1:58:41] Somehow he knew that he this was the
[1:58:44] trip that that vision of him killing the
[1:58:47] caribou and grizzly would happen.
[1:58:56] When he got up there, he told his guide,
[1:58:58] which was Bud U, I can't remember his
[1:59:01] last
[1:59:02] name, Southwick. Bud Bud Southwick. He
[1:59:06] was a young Christian
[1:59:07] man, but he told him of this
[1:59:10] vision. Of course,
[1:59:15] uh, the guy noticed the guy told him, "I
[1:59:19] have never seen a silver tip in all my
[1:59:22] life. I've been raised here. I've been
[1:59:24] here all my life. I've never seen
[1:59:31] one." And he says, "And besides, we're
[1:59:33] going up into sheep country on horses.
[1:59:36] There's no silver tips.
[1:59:42] He says, "You ain't going to get it up
[1:59:44] there." See, Brother Brandon says,
[1:59:47] "Trying to move away to reason."
[1:59:51] Now, Satan, but brother, brother Bud
[1:59:54] didn't know what was happening, but
[1:59:56] Satan was working through brother using
[1:59:58] the words of that brother Bud was
[2:00:01] saying. Now, Brother Bud Southwick, he
[2:00:03] was he was stating facts, right? There
[2:00:07] ain't no grizzly bears up here. It's
[2:00:09] it's it's and and and Bud is it's
[2:00:13] impossible. And Satan through them words
[2:00:16] was trying to get brother Brandham to
[2:00:17] reason. Yeah. Right. Right.
[2:00:21] Trying to get move away. And Satan said
[2:00:24] to
[2:00:25] me, "Well, maybe you just misunderstood
[2:00:29] the
[2:00:31] vision, but I didn't.
[2:00:34] It's going to
[2:00:36] be thus saith the
[2:00:38] Lord. And when the caribou came up and
[2:00:41] we got that which was in the vision as
[2:00:43] you all know then the guide said to me
[2:00:46] fine brother Brandham to be with him now
[2:00:49] in a few weeks a fine fine brother uh
[2:00:53] young Christian. He said, "Brother
[2:00:54] Brandham, my brother had epilepsy, and
[2:00:57] you rolled up there on that horse that
[2:00:59] day and told me a certain thing to do,
[2:01:01] and my brother's epsily would cease."
[2:01:03] And he said, "And when I did exactly
[2:01:05] what the Holy Spirit told you to tell
[2:01:06] me, he's never had a spell from that
[2:01:08] day." He says, "Now we're here on top of
[2:01:11] this mountain, and for three miles right
[2:01:14] down, there's not even a bush 4 in high,
[2:01:18] nothing but caribou moss and a few
[2:01:21] blueberries, and they only get two or
[2:01:23] three in high." And he says, "Caribu
[2:01:26] moss and blueberries pro plumbed to the
[2:01:29] timber line, and our horses were hitched
[2:01:31] in the timber line. And now according to
[2:01:34] what you told me before we come here
[2:01:37] that somewhere between here and that boy
[2:01:40] stand is standing. See for where that
[2:01:43] boy is standing they could see him miles
[2:01:45] away. See and with that chicken shirt on
[2:01:48] you're going to kill a 9- foot silver
[2:01:50] tipped grizzly bear. I said that's thus
[2:01:53] sayeth the Lord. See what was it? Satan
[2:01:57] was trying to get me to disbelieve that.
[2:02:01] Amen. Sure. We started down the
[2:02:04] mountain. The closer we got, he kept
[2:02:06] saying, "Brother Brandon, we're only
[2:02:07] about a mile away from it now." I said,
[2:02:09] "Are you doubting, bud?" Oh, not at all.
[2:02:11] See, we got within a half a mile. And he
[2:02:14] said, "We're only a half a mile now." I
[2:02:16] said, "That's right. Just" and he says,
[2:02:18] "Just thinking a half a mile. See,
[2:02:20] casting down
[2:02:22] reasonings." And he said, "Look, we can
[2:02:24] see everything right before us. There's
[2:02:26] nothing out here." But I said the God
[2:02:28] who gave me the word can create one out
[2:02:31] there. He refused to reason with
[2:02:37] it. Don't reason. Just believe it. Don't
[2:02:42] pay any attention to reasons. That has
[2:02:44] nothing to do with it. Just believe what
[2:02:46] he said. That's all. He said, "I was
[2:02:49] standing there and looked up on the
[2:02:50] hills everywhere. Just yellow caribou
[2:02:53] moss, the sun going down, heels,
[2:02:55] beautiful. You could see any little spot
[2:02:57] anywhere for three miles up the
[2:02:59] mountains right above me. And when I
[2:03:01] turned to look about 2 miles ahead of me
[2:03:03] or a mile and a half, two mile stood a 9
[2:03:06] foot silver tip grizzly. How? Notice
[2:03:10] what brother Brandon said. How did he
[2:03:12] got there? I don't know. But he was
[2:03:17] there.
[2:03:18] Hallelujah. He never let reasoning get
[2:03:21] to him. Never let the devil convince
[2:03:24] him. Well, maybe I am wrong after all.
[2:03:27] No, he stayed with thus sayith the Lord.
[2:03:30] He taught us stay with thus sayith the
[2:03:33] Lord. If the vision about that is right,
[2:03:36] then you know the revelation that God
[2:03:38] gave him is right. Stay with that
[2:03:41] revelation. Do you love
[2:03:44] him? Oh my my
[2:03:47] my giving
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:49] up. Oh, sing it now. Well, I'm not
[2:03:54] giving
[2:03:57] up. I'll not turn
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:05] around the starry
[2:04:09] crown someday. And I'll keep holding
[2:04:14] on to that nail scarred
[2:04:19] hand. And I'm not giving up. No, I'll
[2:04:24] keep going
[2:04:27] on. Sing that verse now. I've been
[2:04:31] walking through the
[2:04:33] valley, through this spell of
[2:04:38] tears. Times I even question if my Lord
[2:04:44] was even near. And then at times that
[2:04:49] old
[2:04:50] tempter says, "Why not turn
[2:04:55] around? You can't get any further
[2:04:59] because you're just you're losing
[2:05:02] ground." And it may seem like it, but
[2:05:04] I'm not giving up. It may seem like I'm
[2:05:07] not going to make it. It may seem like
[2:05:10] I'm just going backwards. Oh, by the
[2:05:13] grace of God, I'll wear a shining
[2:05:18] crown
[2:05:20] someday. And I'll keep holding
[2:05:24] on to that NAS guard
[2:05:29] hand. And I'm not giving up. No, I'll
[2:05:34] keep going on.
[2:05:39] Oh, now would you mind to tell me? See,
[2:05:44] there's been something bothering
[2:05:47] me. Why is it that old devil just won't
[2:05:52] let God's children be? You see, he has
[2:05:57] purpose and he's
[2:06:00] determined to get right in our
[2:06:04] way to turn us from the way of life and
[2:06:09] lead our souls astray. But I say I'm not
[2:06:14] giving
[2:06:15] up. Oh, and I'm not turning
[2:06:20] around. By the grace of God, I'm going
[2:06:24] to wear a shining crown. I'm going to
[2:06:28] have a theophony body. And oh, I'll keep
[2:06:31] holding
[2:06:32] on. Oh, to that nail scarred
[2:06:37] hand. I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[2:06:43] hold. Oh, let the redeemed say it again.
[2:06:46] Yes, I'm not giving up.
[2:06:51] Oh, I'm not turning
[2:06:55] round. By the grace of God, I'm going to
[2:06:59] wear that shining
[2:07:01] crown
[2:07:03] someday. And I'll keep holding
[2:07:07] on to his nail scarred
[2:07:11] hand. And I'm not giving up no. Can we
[2:07:17] sing that second verse?
[2:07:21] Oh, now would you mind to tell me? See,
[2:07:26] there's been something bother
[2:07:30] me. Why is it that old devil just won't
[2:07:35] let God's children be? You see, he has
[2:07:39] purpose and he's
[2:07:42] determined, oh, to get right in our
[2:07:46] way and turn us from the way of life and
[2:07:52] lead our soul. But we're fortified by
[2:07:54] that word and we're not giving up. No
[2:07:58] sir, I'm not turning round.
[2:08:04] By the grace of God, I'll wear the
[2:08:08] shining crown
[2:08:11] someday. And I'll keep holding
[2:08:15] on to that nail scarred
[2:08:19] hand. And I'm not giving up. No, I'll
[2:08:24] keep holding on. Sing the last plans.
[2:08:29] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep holding
[2:08:34] on. Sing that again. Oh, I'm not giving
[2:08:39] up. No, I'll keep holding
[2:08:44] on. Can you just worship the Lord?
[2:08:47] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad you're one
[2:08:49] of them that's resisted the devil's lie
[2:08:52] in the beginning? You're one of those in
[2:08:54] God's mind. Hallelujah. The word is
[2:08:58] written about you. Hallelujah. You
[2:09:01] understand your position in God's word.
[2:09:05] Bless the name of the Lord. Well, I love
[2:09:07] him. Do you love him? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:12] Well, I don't know what song to sing.
[2:09:15] I'm one of
[2:09:16] them. I'm one of
[2:09:19] them. I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:09:23] of
[2:09:25] them. I'm one of them.
[2:09:28] I'm one of
[2:09:30] them. Well, I'm so glad that I can say
[2:09:34] I'm one of them. We can sing that with
[2:09:36] joy. Well, there are people almost
[2:09:39] everywhere whose hearts are all a flame.
[2:09:42] With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
[2:09:45] which cleansed and made them clean, it
[2:09:48] is burning now within my heart. A glory
[2:09:52] to his name. I'm so glad that I can say
[2:09:56] I'm one of them. I'm not the one that
[2:09:57] fell away. I'm one of
[2:10:00] them. I'm one of
[2:10:02] them. And I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[2:10:06] one of
[2:10:08] them. I'm one of
[2:10:11] them. I'm one of
[2:10:13] them. Well, I'm so glad that I can say
[2:10:17] I'm one of them.
[2:10:19] Well, though these people may not learn
[2:10:22] to be nor boast of worldly fame, they
[2:10:26] have all received their Pentecost
[2:10:28] baptized in Jesus' name and are telling
[2:10:32] now both far and wide. His powers yet
[2:10:35] the same. And I'm so glad that I can say
[2:10:38] I'm one of them. Well, I'm one of
[2:10:43] them. I'm one of them.
[2:10:46] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one
[2:10:50] of
[2:10:51] them. I'm one of
[2:10:54] them. I'm one of
[2:10:56] them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[2:11:00] one of
[2:11:01] them. Well, they were gathered in the
[2:11:05] upper room praying in his name. They
[2:11:08] were baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[2:11:12] power for service came. Now, what he did
[2:11:15] for them that day, he'll do for you the
[2:11:18] same. And I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[2:11:22] one of
[2:11:23] them. Oh, I'm one of
[2:11:26] them. I'm one of
[2:11:28] them. I'm so glad that I could say I'm
[2:11:32] one of
[2:11:33] them. I'm one of
[2:11:36] them. I'm one of them.
[2:11:40] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[2:11:45] thee. Can you give him a hand clap of
[2:11:49] praise? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:11:55] Hallelujah. Bless the name of the
[2:11:57] Lord. I love
[2:12:00] him for
[2:12:02] he is mine.
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:08] I love
[2:12:10] him for he
[2:12:13] is
[2:12:17] divine. Oh, I love
[2:12:21] him
[2:12:22] forever. He's
[2:12:27] true. He is
[2:12:30] Jesus who
[2:12:33] died for me. Sing it once again now. Oh,
[2:12:38] I love
[2:12:40] him for
[2:12:43] he is
[2:12:48] mine. I love
[2:12:51] him for he
[2:12:53] is
[2:12:57] divine. Oh, I love
[2:13:00] him forever.
[2:13:03] It's
[2:13:07] true. He is
[2:13:10] Jesus who
[2:13:12] died for me. As they just play softly,
[2:13:16] God bless
[2:13:17] you is our
[2:13:23] prayer. Remember, the only way you'll
[2:13:25] defeat the devil in your life when he
[2:13:28] comes to you is by the word of God. Stay
[2:13:31] with the word. Don't get bored with it.
[2:13:34] Don't let this message become nonchalant
[2:13:36] to you. Amen. Brother Bram said that's
[2:13:40] the tactic of the devil is to get us to
[2:13:41] doubt our weapon. He'll get us to reason
[2:13:44] with it. He'll get us to undermine it.
[2:13:46] He'll just get it get us to where we
[2:13:48] just cast it aside and think it's
[2:13:50] worthless. But you remember this, it's
[2:13:52] worth everything to us because that's
[2:13:55] the only way that's the only way we'll
[2:13:57] defeat the
[2:13:58] enemy. And God gave it to us that we may
[2:14:03] not be part of this falling away. God
[2:14:07] bless you. Love you. Remember service uh
[2:14:11] Sunday. I guess Sunday will be Easter
[2:14:14] Sunday. And uh we look for God to be
[2:14:17] with us and may God be with you as you
[2:14:21] go home. Amen. remember those that are
[2:14:25] sick.
[2:14:26] And I just ask that you would pray for
[2:14:29] each one that are
[2:14:31] working continuously these next two
[2:14:35] three weeks
[2:14:37] uh in the meeting. And uh if if
[2:14:40] anything, prayer, we just prayer works
[2:14:44] and we just need prayer. We need it. Can
[2:14:47] you say amen? So God bless you. Amen.
[2:14:50] Amen. Brother Amos, do you want to
[2:14:52] dismiss us in prayer? Our precious
[2:14:54] heavenly father God.
