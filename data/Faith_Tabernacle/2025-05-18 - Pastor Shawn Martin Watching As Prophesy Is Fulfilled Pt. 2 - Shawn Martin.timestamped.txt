[23:42] Sometimes I try to tell what Jesus means
[23:48] to
[23:51] me. And I find
[23:54] myself searching for words to say just
[23:59] what I mean.

[24:14] me. But I know whatever I need, that's

[28:18] till my face turns blue. But it ain't
[28:22] nothing. It ain't nothing for
[28:25] you. And Joshua took a walk around
[28:30] Jericho.
[28:32] And you told him, you told him that the
[28:36] wall would go. Oh, it crumbled at the
[28:41] shout when the trumpets blew. And it

[29:32] for
[29:33] you. Oh, I was lonely. Sin had broken my
[29:38] heart into. Oh, all the pieces I
[29:42] couldn't mend with the strongest glue.
[29:45] But Lord Jesus, you took the pieces and
[29:49] made me new. Oh, it ain't nothing. It
[29:54] ain't nothing for
[29:55] you now. This body is slowly dying
[30:01] without. But I ain't worried. Oh, the

[31:14] I'm thankful we got a change coming
[31:15] around the corner very soon. Let's try
[31:19] this key of
[31:21] F. If the Lord could speak this world
[31:24] into
[31:26] existence and could hang the moon and
[31:28] stars up in the
[31:30] sky, then I'll know that he can change
[31:34] this mortal body.
[31:36] I'll be changed in the twinkling of an
[31:40] eye. I shall be
[31:42] changed. Oh,
[31:45] hallelujah. I shall be changed. Sweet by
[31:49] and
[31:50] by the dead in Christ shall rise to meet
[31:54] Jesus in the skies. I'll be changed in
[31:57] the twinkling of an eye.
[32:01] When the trump shall sound on that great
[32:05] morning and the Savior shall descend
[32:08] from heaven's
[32:10] fair. When we see the sleeping saints in
[32:13] that
[32:14] dimension. Oh, I'll be changed. Shall
[32:17] meet them in the air. I shall be
[32:21] changed. Oh,
[32:24] hallelujah. I shall be
[32:26] changed sweet by and by.
[32:30] When the dead in Christ shall rise to
[32:33] meet Jesus in the skies. I'll be changed
[32:36] in the twinkling of an
[32:39] eye. I shall be
[32:41] changed. Oh
[32:43] hallelujah. I shall be changed. Sweet by
[32:48] and
[32:49] by. When the dead in Christ shall rise
[32:52] to be Jesus in the sky. I'll be changed
[32:56] in the twinkling of an eye.
[33:01] [Music]
[33:04] [Applause]
[33:07] And do you believe that this morning?
[33:12] We shall be
[33:16] changed. Oh, we shall be
[33:21] changed. Oh, changed from this
[33:24] mortal immortality.
[33:27] Oh, in the twinkling of an eye. Oh, yes,
[33:33] we shall be
[33:36] changed. Oh, we shall be
[33:41] changed. Oh, changed from this mortal to
[33:47] immortality. Oh, in the twinkling of an
[33:51] eye. Oh yes, we shall be
[33:57] changed. Yes, we shall be
[34:02] changed. Oh, changed from this morning
[34:06] to
[34:08] immortality in the twinkling of an
[34:14] eye. Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand
[34:16] clap of
[34:18] praise? Amen. It won't be too much
[34:20] longer. Amen. Are we going to be

[34:25] feet as we invite our pastor to come?
[34:29] Amen. How many is ready for the word?
[34:31] Amen. Amen. Can we sing that song? Can
[34:33] you turn the floor down, Judah? Amen.
[34:36] The signs of the time are everywhere.
[34:44] Some signs of the time are
[34:54] everywhere. Oh, there's a
[34:57] brand
[34:59] new
[35:01] feeling in the air.
[35:07] Just keep your
[35:11] eyes
[35:13] upon the eastern
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:18] sky. Lift up your
[35:23] head. Your
[35:28] redemption. Sing it again.
[35:33] Oh,
[35:34] signs of the times are
[35:39] [Music]
[35:43] everywhere. For there's a brand

[37:01] that? All years of time have come and
[37:06] gone.
[37:09] since I first heard it
[37:13] told. How that Jesus would come again
[37:20] someday.
[37:21] [Laughter]
[37:25] If back then it seems so
[37:29] real that I can't just help but
[37:34] feel how much closer he is coming is.
[37:42] Oh, do you believe that church?
[37:46] Oh,
[37:48] signs of the time are
[37:56] everywhere. There's a brand
[38:00] new feeling in the
[38:05] air.
[38:07] there. Keep your
[38:11] eyes upon the eastern
[38:18] sky. Lift up your
[38:21] head. Your
[38:25] redemption. Is there a second verse to
[38:28] it? Now wars and strife are on every
[38:33] hand.
[38:35] Oh, and
[38:37] violence it fills the
[38:40] land. Still some people doubt that he'll
[38:44] ever come
[38:46] again. My my
[38:48] [Music]
[38:49] my. Oh, but the word of God is
[38:55] true. He's going to
[38:58] redeem his chosen few. So don't lose
[39:03] hope for soon Christ Jesus will
[39:10] descend. Sing it now. Oh
[39:14] signs of the time are
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:22] everywhere. There's a brand new feeling
[39:28] in the air.
[39:33] Keep your eyes, keep your eyes, church,
[39:38] upon
[39:39] him.
[39:42] Hallelujah. Lift up your
[39:45] head. Your redemption
[39:49] draws
[39:53] now. What a time that we're living
[39:57] in. Amen. And I'm so glad to be living
[40:00] in this
[40:01] age. Amen. We may be having the battles
[40:05] and the things that we go through, but
[40:07] brothers and
[40:08] sisters, just any moment now, we're
[40:11] going to see our Lord face to face. And
[40:16] as that song says, it will be worth it
[40:18] all then. Amen. And I love the Lord.
[40:23] Amen. And a beautiful day today. Um and
[40:28] you know I I could say well we needed
[40:31] the rain and uh but I am so glad that
[40:34] the sun is shining today and uh we take
[40:38] every day that the Lord gives us and and
[40:41] rejoice in it. But um uh makes me a
[40:45] little bit more excited to see the sun.
[40:48] Amen. And uh we love the Lord.
[40:53] Um, we've got a dedication. You can be
[40:56] seated. We got a dedication this
[40:58] morning. Uh, little
[41:01] uh Felicity Grace mast. Amen. Going to
[41:06] be dedicated today. And
[41:09] um uh the Lord has blessed brother
[41:12] Junior and and uh Sister Brooke uh with
[41:17] the gift of life and added to their
[41:21] family and we're rejoicing with them and
[41:26] um you know they realize the Lord has
[41:30] blessed them with this baby girl and
[41:33] they want
[41:35] to give her back to the Lord. And I
[41:38] think that is the best thing that we
[41:41] could ever
[41:42] do living in a world of trouble, an evil
[41:46] world.
[41:48] And I guess all of us that have been
[41:51] parents, our parents still you sometimes
[41:56] it just you know situations just leave
[41:58] you perplexed and you as a parent you
[42:03] wish that you know parenting came with a
[42:07] manual and um and everything was just so
[42:11] easy. But there's sometimes that we face
[42:14] challenges that we just ain't got
[42:16] answers for. We don't know what to do.
[42:19] We understand that the Lord is our help,
[42:22] of course, but it's in them times that
[42:25] we just have to wholly rely upon him and
[42:29] let him guide us. And I think it's the
[42:32] greatest honor that we could do for our
[42:36] children. Not only just raising them in
[42:38] the fear of the Lord, but giving them to
[42:41] God. It's not just a ritual that we do.
[42:44] It's it's something that we truly truly
[42:48] ask God to do is bless our children.
[42:51] Keep them when it's beyond me. Just help
[42:54] them. when they're out of my control and
[42:57] when they're somewhere's a way away and
[42:59] Satan is fighting them and it seems like
[43:02] he's got them in his grip, God just just
[43:06] deliver them, help them. And as Job
[43:09] would pray for his children, just in
[43:14] case they had sinned, God had honored
[43:17] him for that. And what a parent. And
[43:20] that's what we do today. Amen. So, um,
[43:24] we're going to sing that song, uh, Bring
[43:26] Them In as, um, Brother Junior and
[43:30] Sister Brooke would make their way.
[43:33] Bring them
[43:36] in. Bring them
[43:39] in. Bring them in from the fields of
[43:47] sin. Bring them
[43:50] in. will bring them
[43:54] in. Bring the little ones to Jesus.
[44:02] Aren't you glad that we can do that
[44:05] today? Not just bringing them to church,
[44:08] but bringing them to the shepherd of our
[44:11] lives, our souls. and he has protected
[44:15] us in so many ways
[44:17] that we have confidence that he'll take
[44:20] care of our
[44:21] children. And um this little baby is
[44:25] just a cutie.

[47:29] ones to Jesus.

[49:43] Um also a praise report uh last Sunday
[49:48] we had mentioned you know that um
[49:50] brother Schma the family wasn't doing
[49:52] good feeling well and he was just
[49:55] telling me uh this morning that the um
[49:59] uh he was feeling really bad and u he
[50:03] said but the Lord intervened and as we
[50:07] prayed for him Sunday that the Lord uh
[50:10] just took all that away from him And uh
[50:13] so he uh uh wanted to give the praise to
[50:16] God and um he said he'd come back on him
[50:21] Wednesday and uh Wednesday night and um
[50:26] and you know he he can't afford to be
[50:28] off you know he's got to work and and
[50:31] things he can't afford to be sick and so
[50:35] uh uh you know we had been just praying
[50:38] and he said by the end of the service
[50:41] God just totally touched him and he's
[50:43] been feeling well ever
[50:47] since. And so we thank the Lord for
[50:51] that. And uh Sister Bethany and Sister
[50:54] Tony are still recovering from the
[50:57] sickness and shoe. And so uh we want to
[51:01] keep them in our prayer. And uh I don't
[51:04] know something about the this sickness
[51:06] that's going around it just leaves you
[51:08] pretty weak. and and uh uh but um uh we
[51:12] just know that God uh will touch them.
[51:15] Good to um have brother Jerry here with
[51:19] us. Amen. And uh you're feeling better.
[51:22] Praise the Lord. Amen. And um so we we
[51:27] do thank the Lord for that. And the Lord
[51:29] is certainly good to us. Amen. And um we
[51:33] want to keep uh remembering brother Amos
[51:36] in our prayer and that he have a speedy
[51:39] recovery on his fingers there and let
[51:42] the Lord will just um help him uh there
[51:46] and um and then it says here um see I
[51:51] want to thank you brother Sean and uh
[51:54] for having a vision and for bringing
[51:59] true word of God's calling ing to me in
[52:02] your tent meeting three years ago.
[52:05] Praise God for that, Sister
[52:08] Rebecca. And
[52:10] um say, I stand on this verse, Isaiah
[52:14] 43:1. But now, thus sayith the Lord that
[52:17] created thee, oh Jacob, and he that
[52:20] formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I
[52:23] have redeemed thee. I have called thee
[52:25] by thy name, thou art mine. Amen. I I
[52:30] think we all stand on that one, don't
[52:32] we? Amen. We thank the Lord and we
[52:35] certainly appreciate what God is
[52:38] continuing to do in Sister Rebecca's
[52:40] life and the zeal that she has for the
[52:43] message of the hour and for God's people
[52:47] to help. Amen. In any way that she can
[52:50] and uh we certainly appreciate that.
[52:54] Amen. and just pray God just continues
[52:57] uh to bless her and grant her heart's
[53:00] desire. Amen. And if you would stand
[53:03] with me, I
[53:06] uh going to the word uh Revelations the
[53:11] 13th
[53:13] chapter, a familiar scripture to
[53:20] us. Before we go into the word, may we
[53:24] just talk to the author of the
[53:27] word? Uh for we certainly need
[53:30] him. Lord
[53:32] Jesus, with our heads bowed, our hearts
[53:36] humbled before your
[53:39] presence. Father, we realize every day
[53:42] that we live that we need you and we
[53:45] need your leadership, your guidance.
[53:49] Father, and just
[53:51] asking that you would now take
[53:55] uh the what words that we would have to
[53:58] say and that it would be anointed and
[54:01] that would come from you that you would
[54:05] plant the word into our
[54:07] hearts that we would be better
[54:10] Christians and more prepared for the
[54:13] soon
[54:14] event that is coming.
[54:17] I pray that you would bless the reading
[54:19] of your word, Father, and anoint both
[54:21] speaker and hearer. And may you have the
[54:25] preeminence in this part of the service
[54:27] and any spirit that would try to hinder
[54:30] us, Lord, and maybe get our minds to
[54:34] wander or whatever, Lord. I pray that
[54:37] you would just drive that away. And may
[54:40] we focus upon your word today. We ask it
[54:45] father in Jesus name.
[54:49] Amen. So going to read the the whole
[54:52] chapter
[54:55] um Revelations 13:1. And I stood upon
[54:59] the sand of the
[55:01] sea. And I saw a beast rise up out of
[55:04] the sea having seven heads and 10 horns
[55:06] and having and upon his horns 10 crowns.
[55:10] and upon his heads the name of
[55:14] blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was
[55:16] like unto a
[55:18] leopard and his feet uh were as the feet
[55:22] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[55:24] a lion and the dragon gave him his power
[55:29] and his seat and great
[55:32] authority. We know that's Rome. That's
[55:35] Babylon. It's mystery Babylon.
[55:38] Uh, and I saw one of his heads as it
[55:42] were wounded to death. Um, and and his
[55:48] deadly wound was healed and all the
[55:51] world wandered after the beast. We know
[55:54] brother Brandham taught that that was
[55:56] pagan Rome becoming papo
[55:59] Rome. And they worshiped the dragon
[56:02] which gave power unto the beast. And
[56:04] they worshiped the beast saying, "Who is
[56:06] like unto the beast? who is able to make
[56:08] war with him. And there was given unto
[56:12] him a mouth speaking great things and
[56:14] blasphemies and power was given unto him
[56:18] to continue 40 and two months. And he
[56:21] opened his mouth in blasphemy against
[56:24] God to blasphem his name and his
[56:27] tabernacle and them that dwell in
[56:29] heaven. And it was given unto him to
[56:32] make war with the saints and to overcome
[56:35] them. And power was given him over all
[56:39] kindreds, tongues, and
[56:41] nations. And all that dwell upon the
[56:43] earth shall worship him whose names are
[56:46] not written in the book of life of the
[56:49] Lamb slain from the foundation of the
[56:52] world. And if any man have an ear, let
[56:55] him hear. He that leadth into captivity
[56:58] shall go into captivity. And he that
[57:00] kleth with the sword must be killed with
[57:03] the sword. Here is the patience and the
[57:06] faith of the
[57:07] saints. And I beheld another beast
[57:10] coming out up out of the earth. And he
[57:12] had two horns like a lamb. And he spake
[57:15] as a dragon. And he exercisth all the
[57:19] power of the first beast before him, and
[57:22] causeth the earth, and them which dwell
[57:25] therein to worship the first beast,
[57:28] whose deadly wound was
[57:30] healed. And he doeth great wonders. So
[57:33] that he maketh the uh fire come down
[57:36] from heaven on the earth in the sight of
[57:39] men, and deceiveth them that dwell on
[57:43] the earth by the means of those miracles
[57:46] which he had power to do in the sight of
[57:49] the beast, saying to them that dwell on
[57:51] the earth, that they should make an
[57:53] image to the beast, which had the wound
[57:56] by a sword, and did live. And he had
[57:59] power to give life unto the image of the
[58:02] beast that the image of the beast should
[58:04] both speak and cause uh that as many as
[58:09] would not worship the image of the beast
[58:12] should be killed. He uh and he causes
[58:16] all both small and great, rich and poor,
[58:19] free and bond uh to receive a mark in
[58:22] their right hand uh or in their
[58:25] forehead.
[58:27] uh and that no man might buy or sell
[58:31] save he that had the mark or the name of
[58:33] the beast or the number of his name.
[58:37] Here is wisdom. Let him that hath
[58:40] understanding count the number of the
[58:42] beast for it is the number of a of a uh
[58:45] a man and his number is 66 score and
[58:50] six. Amen. You can have your seats this
[58:54] morning.
[58:58] I am uh not going to get to the main
[59:01] part of this scripture
[59:03] um today, but the Lord willing I plan to
[59:07] do that um in in the near future. But um
[59:13] I guess I want to continue with the
[59:17] subject that we spoke on uh last Sunday.
[59:21] watching as prophecy is fulfilled would
[59:25] be the title. And uh what what we just
[59:29] read is a
[59:31] prophecy. And um uh prophecy
[59:35] uh the word is uh means a foretelling, a
[59:40] forecasting of future
[59:42] events. Webster says
[59:45] uh prophecy is a prediction of something
[59:48] to come. It is an inspired utterance of
[59:52] a prophet. And so, uh, prophecy, it
[59:56] foretells of future events. Uh, in the
[1:00:00] book of Revelations, John wrote about
[1:00:03] what he saw and and so this is u uh
[1:00:08] something that was revealed to John. And
[1:00:11] he saw things in symbol forms.
[1:00:15] uh as as we read, he sees this beast
[1:00:18] rise up and and he's he's talking. He
[1:00:21] talks about how he saw this uh woman uh
[1:00:25] sitting on a beast, a scarlet colored
[1:00:28] beast and and so so any of you that um
[1:00:33] uh have read Revelations, uh it's a it's
[1:00:36] a book of symbols. Uh but it was God
[1:00:39] foretelling of things to come. So this
[1:00:43] wasn't just John
[1:00:45] um uh describing something, but it was
[1:00:49] God. He was he was he was only writing
[1:00:52] down uh what God uh had revealed to him.
[1:00:57] And we now see it. It was foretelling a
[1:01:00] prophecy of something to come. You see,
[1:01:04] God can foretell of things to come
[1:01:07] because he has an infinite
[1:01:09] mind. He knows what will be. How many
[1:01:12] believes that he knows what will be in
[1:01:14] your life, your future? He knows what
[1:01:16] will be in the church. He knows what
[1:01:19] will be in the world. Um and and so
[1:01:23] therefore, God knows all things. He
[1:01:25] knows all things. He knows the past, the
[1:01:28] present, and and the future. And so, we
[1:01:31] wouldn't know what the past was if God
[1:01:34] hadn't showed us. uh um and and um you
[1:01:40] know I know we have historians uh that
[1:01:43] that you know that they're there to tell
[1:01:45] us about the past and what what happened
[1:01:48] in life and things like that but
[1:01:50] historians don't have an infinite mind
[1:01:53] and therefore it is impossible for them
[1:01:56] to give an accurate account especially
[1:01:59] if if they weren't there uh and even if
[1:02:03] they were there they still couldn't give
[1:02:05] an accurate account with God's help. Uh
[1:02:07] it took God to tell us uh what Adam and
[1:02:11] Eve look like um uh that that uh uh Eve
[1:02:16] had blonde hair and and described what
[1:02:19] how uh their their what they were and uh
[1:02:23] it took God to tell us what really
[1:02:26] happened in the Garden of Eden in the
[1:02:29] beginning. It took God to tell us even
[1:02:32] what caused uh the World War I to uh
[1:02:37] stop abruptly. Uh um and so no historian
[1:02:42] could tell us these things but but God
[1:02:44] knew. And so it it also uh takes God to
[1:02:50] reveal what the present is. uh uh no no
[1:02:54] genius mind can uh tell us exactly what
[1:02:59] is going on in the present world.
[1:03:01] Looking at the wars and looking at the
[1:03:03] nations and looking at nature itself in
[1:03:06] an upheaval and and all of the things
[1:03:09] that are going on around the world all
[1:03:12] these events and yet not one knows it
[1:03:15] would take God to reveal it as to what
[1:03:18] is happening. It took God to reveal what
[1:03:22] the future is. See, so he's the only one
[1:03:25] that has the the the an infinite mind.
[1:03:28] And the Bible would would say, you know,
[1:03:31] uh known unto God are all of his works
[1:03:34] from the beginning. And so the prophet
[1:03:37] said, God by his fornowledge foresaw it,
[1:03:40] and therefore from the beginning he
[1:03:42] could tell the end. So So this is uh uh
[1:03:46] prophecy. there's uh uh God foretelling
[1:03:50] of things that that are to come and and
[1:03:54] so according to scripture God forneew
[1:03:58] what would be and not only forneew it
[1:04:01] but he for ordained it uh what would be
[1:04:05] uh just like Ephesians 1 and5 having
[1:04:09] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:04:12] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:04:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:04:16] will. So, so God from the beginning uh
[1:04:21] before time had already predestinated us
[1:04:24] to the adoption of of children by Jesus
[1:04:27] Christ. Romans 8:29, for whom he did
[1:04:31] forno, he also did predestinate to be
[1:04:34] conformed to the image of his son, that
[1:04:36] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:04:38] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[1:04:40] predestinate them he also called. Whom
[1:04:42] he called, he also justified. whom he
[1:04:45] justified them he also glorified. So, so
[1:04:48] there's a future for the saints of God.
[1:04:52] And and and we can read our future
[1:04:54] already. And and that's because it came
[1:04:58] from the mind of God. See, it was God
[1:05:01] calling those things or we could say
[1:05:03] prophesying of those things that are not
[1:05:06] as though they already were. He was
[1:05:09] foretelling of things that were to come.
[1:05:12] He called them just as Abraham called
[1:05:15] those things that are not as though they
[1:05:17] were. How could Abraham do that? Because
[1:05:19] it was a prophecy concerning him and
[1:05:23] Sarah that they would have a son. And
[1:05:25] and so he caught the mind of God. And
[1:05:28] therefore he acted upon it because it
[1:05:31] was just as sure to him as it was to
[1:05:33] God. God says, "You'll have a son." And
[1:05:36] he says, "I will have a son." And so
[1:05:39] therefore, he began to call those things
[1:05:42] as though, uh, they already were. Ain't
[1:05:44] that right? And so, uh, uh, prophecy is
[1:05:48] the predestinated plan of God. The, it's
[1:05:51] the will of God for the future. Amen.
[1:05:54] So, uh, now think of that. Prophecy is
[1:05:57] the predestinated plan of God. It's the
[1:06:00] will of God for the future. Amen. So
[1:06:04] therefore, all prophecy that is of God
[1:06:07] must come to pass. For prophecy is the
[1:06:11] word of God. Do you believe that? Uh uh
[1:06:14] when God declares what will be, it will
[1:06:17] be uh because it's from his word and
[1:06:21] it's his will that it be. And and and to
[1:06:24] to understand, Amen. Uh these things, we
[1:06:28] have to just say that God is all wise
[1:06:32] and he knows. He knows how to place it.
[1:06:34] He knows what to do. He knows what he's
[1:06:36] doing. And and and the Bible says, "Who
[1:06:39] hath known the mind of Christ?" Well, no
[1:06:42] one can figure God's mind out. But once
[1:06:44] he reveals his mind to us, Amen. As Paul
[1:06:47] said, we have the mind of God. We have
[1:06:50] the mind of Christ. Amen. It's it's a
[1:06:52] mind that has been revealed. Ain't that
[1:06:54] right? So Jesus says, "Heaven and earth
[1:06:57] shall pass away, but my words shall not
[1:06:59] pass away." So when when looking at
[1:07:02] prophecy then we know that there there
[1:07:06] is nothing out of cater everything has
[1:07:09] to line up according to prophecy. Amen.
[1:07:11] The world events have to line up
[1:07:13] according to prophecy. Uh uh nature has
[1:07:17] to line up according to prophecy. Amen.
[1:07:20] Nations have to line up. Kings and
[1:07:22] princes and presidents and and and uh
[1:07:26] all the way down to the puper. Amen. uh
[1:07:29] everything has to line up according to
[1:07:32] the prophecy because it is the word of
[1:07:35] God. And we know that the prophet says
[1:07:38] that God set his word his we we'll say
[1:07:42] set prophecy his prophecy his word to be
[1:07:46] fulfilled in time segments or church
[1:07:50] ages. uh to Israel. They had 70 70 weeks
[1:07:54] I believe uh uh there uh seven 70 weeks
[1:07:58] and God would allow them and within that
[1:08:01] 70 weeks things would transpire uh uh
[1:08:04] and we know that that Christ was to be
[1:08:07] cut off in the middle of that 70th week
[1:08:10] and he was he was crucified and grace
[1:08:13] God turned the turned toward the
[1:08:16] Gentiles and so the Jews have been
[1:08:18] blinded all this time. uh uh nothing
[1:08:21] really happening until this last day.
[1:08:23] But we know that they've got 3 and 1/2
[1:08:26] weeks left uh that God is going to deal
[1:08:29] with them and and in that time he's
[1:08:31] going to seal 144,000 Jews. Ain't that
[1:08:35] right? But God has allotted a time for
[1:08:38] us and that is seven church ages uh uh
[1:08:42] for the Gentiles. Uh but but but it it's
[1:08:45] a word. See uh uh his prophecy to be uh
[1:08:50] fulfilled in segments of time. In other
[1:08:53] words, it didn't happen all at once.
[1:08:55] Amen. Just like God would give a
[1:08:57] prophecy to Noah. It's going to
[1:09:00] rain. 120 years later, that prophecy was
[1:09:04] fulfilled. Amen. So, we understand that.
[1:09:07] Yet, yes, prophecy is going to be
[1:09:10] fulfilled. But then we understand that
[1:09:12] there's a timing for it to be fulfilled.
[1:09:14] Ain't that right? Amen. Last week we
[1:09:17] read where Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes
[1:09:20] 3 and1 uh to everything there is a
[1:09:24] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:09:27] heaven. Ain't that right? So we as
[1:09:30] believers don't get discouraged. Amen.
[1:09:32] when when uh uh things uh uh go go uh
[1:09:37] maybe seem upheaval and things are going
[1:09:39] wrong and you know the saying when it
[1:09:42] rains it pours and and how many believes
[1:09:44] that to be true. Amen. I I mean anything
[1:09:48] you know the dog can bite somebody and
[1:09:50] at the same time your car breaks down
[1:09:52] and at that same time something else
[1:09:54] happens and then something else. Well,
[1:09:56] it happened to Job. I I read or I heard
[1:09:59] that that in Job, everything that
[1:10:02] happened to Job happened in a year's
[1:10:04] time. So, it really rained. It poured on
[1:10:07] him. And and so in a year's time, uh uh
[1:10:11] but but we find that there is a timing,
[1:10:13] a time to plant, a time to pluck up that
[1:10:16] which is planted, as Solomon would say,
[1:10:19] a time to kill, a time to heal. Ain't
[1:10:22] that right? Amen. Aren't you glad for
[1:10:23] them times? He ain't want to kill
[1:10:25] everybody at one time, you know, always,
[1:10:27] you know, uh a time to kill, a time to
[1:10:30] heal, a time to break down, a time to
[1:10:32] build up. So, so we understand that
[1:10:35] there there's not just it happens in the
[1:10:37] world. It happens in our lives. It
[1:10:40] happens that we go through drought
[1:10:42] seasons. It happens that we we go
[1:10:44] through times where we feel like God has
[1:10:46] left us and and we're wondering what
[1:10:49] what what where are we at? What's
[1:10:51] happening? And where are you, God? And
[1:10:53] where am I at? and and how am I fitting
[1:10:55] in all this plan of yours and and all
[1:10:58] these things we go through them times. I
[1:11:00] I I think everyone from from the most
[1:11:03] seasoned Christian to the very uh uh
[1:11:06] immature Christian, we go through time,
[1:11:09] but we understand by prophecy that these
[1:11:12] things happen. These are seasons in our
[1:11:14] life. Time to plant, time to pluck up
[1:11:18] that which was planted, right? Amen. and
[1:11:21] and and the time to build a time to
[1:11:24] break down and so so God but but
[1:11:27] remember when God builds it, it's
[1:11:29] everlasting. What God truly plants, it's
[1:11:33] it's an eternal planting. Ain't that
[1:11:35] right? Amen. See, but there's things in
[1:11:37] our life. There's always changes that
[1:11:39] that that that go in our life. God puts
[1:11:42] people in our lives and God takes people
[1:11:44] out of our lives and and and and and it
[1:11:47] it it's just a constant a constant
[1:11:50] thing. So therefore, but we look at at
[1:11:53] prophecy and we rest in prophecy. Amen.
[1:11:57] Ain't that right? Amen. See, and so so
[1:12:00] we we find that I if if if there's a
[1:12:04] time, then it pays to know what season
[1:12:07] we are in. Amen. It pays to know what
[1:12:11] season we are in. If if it is planting
[1:12:13] season, then don't look for fruit. Amen.
[1:12:16] Because that's not the season for it.
[1:12:19] But remember, there is a time for the
[1:12:21] fruit to come. It's just in another
[1:12:24] season. But according to the prophecy,
[1:12:26] we just wait. If you're in the time of
[1:12:29] uh where there ain't no fruit and
[1:12:31] everything's barren and and and you you
[1:12:34] planted and and yet uh uh you're not
[1:12:36] seeing anything right now, Amen. Just
[1:12:39] remember according to prophecy, the
[1:12:41] fruit has to come. Amen. See? Amen. And
[1:12:45] so springtime is the season to plant
[1:12:47] corn. Fall is the season to harvest it.
[1:12:51] Amen. But there's seasons in in
[1:12:53] everything. So So what if there was no
[1:12:57] such thing as prophecy? Well, we
[1:13:00] wouldn't be able to understand modern
[1:13:03] events uh without prophecy. We wouldn't
[1:13:06] know what to expect. Amen. If we didn't
[1:13:09] have prophecy to forewarn us or foretell
[1:13:13] us of of what to happen now, now as a
[1:13:16] Christian, you know, in your trials is
[1:13:19] that's when the devil really beats you
[1:13:20] up. And and he tries to he'll tell you
[1:13:23] he'll he'll almost convince you that
[1:13:25] you're lost. You're not going in a
[1:13:26] rapture. You're too you're too bad.
[1:13:28] You're too far gone. You just, you know,
[1:13:30] you ain't going to make it. look at this
[1:13:32] fault and that fault and this fault and
[1:13:34] this fault and duh. Well, if we didn't
[1:13:36] have prophecy to rest our soul upon.
[1:13:40] Well, then what would we do? But we rest
[1:13:44] in prophecy. We rest in the fact that
[1:13:46] there is coming a time. Amen. Where
[1:13:50] Satan is going to be defeated. He'll be
[1:13:52] thrown in hell. Amen. And there's
[1:13:55] nothing that he can do about it. Amen.
[1:13:57] There's a prophecy that was is being
[1:13:59] laying there all this time. No weapon
[1:14:01] formed against you is going to prosper.
[1:14:04] See, so so we have prophecy to to rest
[1:14:07] our life upon. Amen. See, uh uh if we
[1:14:10] didn't have prophecy, we we would just
[1:14:12] live our life without any hope of a
[1:14:15] future because we wouldn't know that
[1:14:17] there was a future. Ain't that right?
[1:14:20] See, so so uh again, without prophecy,
[1:14:23] well, you know, we wouldn't have any
[1:14:25] hope when when we're going through our
[1:14:27] night seasoning in our life. H how does
[1:14:30] a man have hope if he doesn't know the
[1:14:32] future? Cuz Satan will get us to
[1:14:34] thinking that this is all there is for
[1:14:36] us. We're we're going down, you know.
[1:14:39] But then there there there's a prophecy
[1:14:41] like like uh uh uh Psalms 30 and5. Amen.
[1:14:45] It says, "Weeping may endure for a
[1:14:47] night, but joy cometh in the morning."
[1:14:50] Well, see, that's a prophecy for us. God
[1:14:53] knows, amen, that yes, he under He knows
[1:14:56] you're going to go through night
[1:14:57] seasons, but he also knows that the
[1:14:59] sun's coming up. He also knows the sun's
[1:15:02] going to shine. And he also knows that
[1:15:04] you may be weeping now, but there's a
[1:15:07] time of joy that is coming. These are
[1:15:09] prophecies for us in our times, amen,
[1:15:13] that we can look to and it's God
[1:15:15] fortelling of our life that Satan ain't
[1:15:18] writing the end of your story. Satan
[1:15:19] ain't he ain't writing your story. It's
[1:15:22] God and prophecy is what's holding you.
[1:15:25] Amen. Seasons of your life. Amen. And so
[1:15:29] we thank God for prophecy. Ain't that
[1:15:31] right? See, it's foretelling of what
[1:15:33] it's going to be. If we didn't have that
[1:15:36] prophecy, well, we wouldn't expect for
[1:15:38] our situation to
[1:15:40] change, right?
[1:15:43] Sure. So, we we would think that the
[1:15:45] nighttime was forever and that our
[1:15:47] weeping would continue for a lifetime.
[1:15:50] So, so believers as believers we and we
[1:15:54] draw comfort by prophecy. Amen. 1 Peter
[1:15:58] 1 and3 uh uh is another prophecy here uh
[1:16:03] uh blessed be the God and father of our
[1:16:06] Lord Jesus Christ which according to his
[1:16:08] abundant mercy abundant mercy hath
[1:16:11] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:16:14] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:16:16] the dead. Notice to an
[1:16:20] inheritance incorruptible and undefiled
[1:16:24] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[1:16:26] for you. That's a prophecy.
[1:16:30] God didn't just save you to sit on a
[1:16:32] pew. He didn't save you so you just go
[1:16:36] to hell. He saved you because there's an
[1:16:39] eternal
[1:16:40] inheritance that cannot fade away. It's
[1:16:44] incorruptible and it's waiting in heaven
[1:16:46] for you. See, that's a prophecy. see uh
[1:16:50] uh who are kept by the power of God
[1:16:52] through faith under salvation ready to
[1:16:54] be revealed in the last time wherein you
[1:16:57] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[1:17:00] if need be you are in heaviness through
[1:17:03] manifold temptations that the trial of
[1:17:06] your faith being much more precious than
[1:17:08] of gold that perisheth though it be
[1:17:10] tried with fire might be found unto the
[1:17:13] praise and honor and glory at the
[1:17:15] appearing of Jesus Christ. Another
[1:17:17] prophecy. Can you say amen? See, it's
[1:17:20] foretelling of what's going to happen
[1:17:23] after the trying of our faith. Yes, your
[1:17:26] faith is going to be tried. That's true.
[1:17:28] But notice the prophecy behind that.
[1:17:31] See, that you might be found under
[1:17:34] praise and honor and glory at the
[1:17:36] appearing of Jesus Christ. So what Satan
[1:17:39] means for bad and means to destroy you,
[1:17:43] there's a prophecy saying it can't
[1:17:46] destroy you. You're going to be found
[1:17:49] unto the praise and honor and glory at
[1:17:52] the appearing of Jesus Christ. Ain't
[1:17:54] that right? See, if we didn't have such
[1:17:57] prophecy, well, we wouldn't know that
[1:18:00] the trying of our faith, see uh uh what
[1:18:04] had any value in it. We would just think
[1:18:07] that the trials was there. But then we
[1:18:10] understand according to prophecy that
[1:18:12] hold it. This is the trying of my faith.
[1:18:16] Come on. Can you say amen? So, we take
[1:18:20] comfort in prophecy that comes from God,
[1:18:22] knowing that it has to come to pass.
[1:18:25] It's the word of God.
[1:18:28] I believe the woman at the well was
[1:18:30] comforted by the prophecy that foretold
[1:18:32] of the coming Messiah.
[1:18:35] Although she was a prostitute, she was
[1:18:37] an outcast. She was just a no good
[1:18:40] individual.
[1:18:42] uh running around with men and totally
[1:18:45] contradicting you know Moses' law that's
[1:18:48] for
[1:18:49] sure and you know she's just a harlot
[1:18:53] but she held to the prophecy
[1:18:56] in in what she was going through there
[1:18:59] she knew that there had been a prophecy
[1:19:03] and she watched for it to be fulfilled
[1:19:06] the Lord think about it she believed in
[1:19:09] it regardless of her condition you see
[1:19:11] where we're at. No matter what your
[1:19:14] condition is this morning, you still
[1:19:16] look for the rapture. You still look for
[1:19:18] the changing of your body. You still
[1:19:20] look. We're looking because prophecy,
[1:19:24] right?
[1:19:27] And and and so she recognized the
[1:19:29] Messiah when he came to her and done the
[1:19:31] works of
[1:19:32] Messiah. And the reason she did this and
[1:19:35] recognized it is because she knew what
[1:19:38] the prophecy said he would do. Amen. and
[1:19:41] she looked for it. Remember she said,
[1:19:43] "We know that when the Messiah cometh,
[1:19:46] he will do these things." And all he had
[1:19:49] to say is, "I am he."
[1:19:53] And quickly she was redeemed.
[1:19:57] Amen. Quickly her sins were forgiven
[1:19:59] her. Ain't that right? So, thank God for
[1:20:03] prophecy. How could we believe in a
[1:20:05] millennium if it were not told
[1:20:08] beforehand? Amen. How how how could we
[1:20:10] preach about a rapture if there wasn't a
[1:20:12] prophecy spoken or written of it? How
[1:20:15] could we look forward to the changing of
[1:20:17] our body uh uh if it wasn't foretold of
[1:20:20] us uh foretold us of of such an event?
[1:20:24] How could we be excited in a time when
[1:20:26] when the great tribulation is setting in
[1:20:29] all around us and and and and and the
[1:20:32] people are uh in the spirit of the last
[1:20:34] days. they they they're preparing or
[1:20:37] they're already prepared for such an
[1:20:39] event and all these things. But but how
[1:20:42] could we be excited when when it's all
[1:20:45] around us if there hadn't been a
[1:20:47] prophecy, a man, that was saying that we
[1:20:50] would not go through that?
[1:20:53] Praise the Lord. How could we talk about
[1:20:55] meeting our loved ones who have gone to
[1:20:57] the grave if there wasn't a prophecy
[1:20:58] telling us beforehand that this is
[1:21:00] what's going to happen? Amen. Amen. See,
[1:21:03] so prophecy gives us a hope. Praise the
[1:21:06] Lord.
[1:21:08] All believers believe in prophecy. Do
[1:21:10] you believe in prophecy? Amen. All
[1:21:12] believers believe in it. And because we
[1:21:15] are, we believe in it, we're not caught
[1:21:17] off guard,
[1:21:19] when it happens. Amen. When it is
[1:21:22] fulfilled.
[1:21:23] Now, the world gets caught off guard.
[1:21:26] The church gets caught off guard.
[1:21:29] Everybody was caught off guard about
[1:21:31] this pope. Yeah. American pope. But a
[1:21:35] believer wasn't.
[1:21:37] We've been watching for this
[1:21:41] way before it come. I mean, you know,
[1:21:43] when I first heard about it and come
[1:21:45] into the message and read that, I've
[1:21:47] been looking for American Pope coming.
[1:21:49] That's right. I just been looking for
[1:21:51] it. But even the Catholic church, even
[1:21:54] the Catholics were surprised. But not
[1:21:56] not not not the believers
[1:21:59] because there's been a prophecy laying.
[1:22:01] Can you say amen? So So because we
[1:22:04] believe in prophecy, we expect it to
[1:22:07] happen. How many expects it to happen?
[1:22:10] Now, now I I know there's going to be a
[1:22:12] rapture. I'm expecting it. Prophecy says
[1:22:15] so. I'm expecting for this old body to
[1:22:18] change and and my hair, what have I have
[1:22:22] fallen out, it's coming back. and all
[1:22:24] this grave that's trying to set in is
[1:22:26] going to be reversed. And and the aches
[1:22:28] and the pains that I've been feeling, it
[1:22:30] it ain't going to be there no more
[1:22:32] because there's a prophecy. And I can
[1:22:34] tell you ahead of time before it
[1:22:36] happens, it's coming. It's going to
[1:22:38] happen because there's a prophecy that
[1:22:41] is laying there. Ain't that right? Well,
[1:22:43] that is the same way when we go through
[1:22:44] our trials and we go through things and
[1:22:46] we're looking and we don't you let the
[1:22:48] devil just beat you up. Sure. If we ever
[1:22:52] let the devil get us to a place, we
[1:22:54] would all quit. We would sat down. I
[1:22:56] would just quit. I'd quit preaching. I'd
[1:22:59] quit singing. I'd quit I' I'd quit it
[1:23:01] all. But there's a prophecy.
[1:23:04] I don't go by my feelings. I'm going by
[1:23:06] a prophecy that there's a joy coming in
[1:23:09] the morning. Something's going to
[1:23:12] happen. This the situation's changing,
[1:23:14] brother Tim. It's got to change.
[1:23:18] Lord was a prophecy. Amen. That's right.
[1:23:22] Can you say amen? See, so we expect it
[1:23:25] to happen. And and David says in Psalms
[1:23:28] uh 62 and5, he said, "My expectation is
[1:23:32] from the Lord." Can you say that? My
[1:23:35] expectation is from him. From the Lord.
[1:23:38] Ain't that right? So our our expectation
[1:23:40] doesn't come from a politician or uh uh
[1:23:43] that that uh that the promises that he
[1:23:46] makes. It it doesn't come from a
[1:23:48] doctor's report. Well, you're getting
[1:23:49] better. one of these days you're you you
[1:23:52] know uh uh all these things. Our
[1:23:53] expectation doesn't come from the word
[1:23:55] of some man. Our expectation comes from
[1:23:58] the Lord because what he says comes from
[1:24:01] an infinite mind. He knows what will
[1:24:03] happen. He is sure that it's going to
[1:24:05] happen. There ain't no devil going to
[1:24:07] stop what's happening. Amen. He has
[1:24:09] tried and he has tried and he's tried to
[1:24:12] keep this bride from coming forth. Amen.
[1:24:15] But a prophecy said there's going to be
[1:24:16] a bride without spot, wrinkle, or
[1:24:18] blemish. And I don't care what he puts
[1:24:20] on her. I don't care what he does to
[1:24:22] her. She's going to be there because God
[1:24:25] said it. He saw her from the foundation
[1:24:28] of the world. And there ain't nothing
[1:24:31] Satan can do. See, so we're our hopes
[1:24:33] are built upon prophecy.
[1:24:36] You see, believers throughout time have
[1:24:39] have gone to their grave looking for
[1:24:41] certain things to happen and not only
[1:24:44] look but believing that they will
[1:24:46] happen. Amen. See, God foretold of the
[1:24:48] Messiah uh uh coming 4,000 years before
[1:24:52] he actually came. He actually foretold
[1:24:54] of it years before then. Amen. For a
[1:24:56] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:24:58] the world. But when when when God told
[1:25:01] Eve, Amen. Uh uh uh Satan's going to
[1:25:04] bruise uh uh the or the serpent shall
[1:25:06] bruise thy seed the the the heel, but
[1:25:09] but thy seed's going to bruise his head.
[1:25:12] He was promising a Messiah.
[1:25:15] Ain't that right? See, so from the time
[1:25:18] of that prophecy to the time that it was
[1:25:20] fulfilled, the people through all of
[1:25:23] that segment of time lived their entire
[1:25:26] life. Now, no, not not everybody, but
[1:25:29] that elect. Amen. When they heard the
[1:25:32] promise of Messiah, they were passing it
[1:25:34] down to their children and their
[1:25:35] children's children and their they kept
[1:25:37] that prophecy alive. And the people
[1:25:40] lived for that day. They were looking
[1:25:42] for that day. The elect. Ain't that
[1:25:44] right? Amen. See, they were looking,
[1:25:47] believing. They they they lived their
[1:25:49] entire life looking for this Messiah,
[1:25:52] this prophecy to be fulfilled. Hebrews
[1:25:54] 11:13, these all died in
[1:25:57] faith, not having received the promises,
[1:26:00] but having seen them aar off, and were
[1:26:03] persuaded of them, embraced them, and
[1:26:06] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:26:08] pilgrims on this earth. Can you say
[1:26:10] amen? See, God had let them see what he
[1:26:14] was talking about and they saw Messiah.
[1:26:17] They saw the revelation of him. Amen. As
[1:26:20] I've said before, Amen. They might have
[1:26:22] looked at that natural lamb, but they
[1:26:24] can look up and see a true lamb coming.
[1:26:27] Amen. And they never looked at that
[1:26:29] natural lamb anymore. They kept their
[1:26:31] eyes upon that lamb. Yes, I'd kill this
[1:26:33] lamb. And yes, it's an atonement, but
[1:26:36] I'm really redeemed by that lamb. Amen.
[1:26:38] and they died in faith based upon the
[1:26:42] prophecy.
[1:26:46] So it's not just believing in
[1:26:48] prophecy, but it's understanding
[1:26:51] prophecy
[1:26:53] when it is being fulfilled.
[1:26:56] Ain't that right?
[1:26:59] Now we look in as a whole, as a nation,
[1:27:03] the Jews expected prophecy.
[1:27:06] They knew the prophecy spoken of Messiah
[1:27:09] and they believed in it. They expected
[1:27:12] Messiah to come, but they didn't
[1:27:13] understand the
[1:27:14] prophecy. Is that right? So like when
[1:27:17] Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey.
[1:27:21] Amen. There there were those that were
[1:27:23] throwing pomegranates and they were
[1:27:24] crying hosana, hosana. Amen. And and
[1:27:27] then but then there was that religious
[1:27:29] sect that was saying who is this? What's
[1:27:32] happening?
[1:27:34] Guy riding on a donkey and everybody's
[1:27:36] throwing palm, you know, palm branches
[1:27:37] and all this. Something wrong. See, they
[1:27:40] knew prophecy. They knew the Messiah was
[1:27:43] coming, but they didn't understand
[1:27:45] prophecy being fulfilled,
[1:27:48] right? See, and so Paul would say, "Had
[1:27:51] they known, they wouldn't have crucified
[1:27:53] the Lord of glory."
[1:27:55] See, so brother Bram said it's so easy
[1:27:58] for people to misunderstand what God is
[1:28:01] doing. See, the Bible is a book of
[1:28:04] prophecy, but it's also a book of
[1:28:06] mystery. Amen. Uh, Brother Brown would
[1:28:09] say, "Yet to the world, it is a
[1:28:11] mysterious book." Ain't that right?
[1:28:14] Because the human mind is not capable of
[1:28:18] interpreting the mind of God. As the
[1:28:20] prophet said, we can't even cannot even
[1:28:23] interpret each other's mind, let alone
[1:28:25] God's mind. Ain't that right? So, so
[1:28:28] people believe that the Bible is just a
[1:28:31] mysterious book, a book of mystery. See,
[1:28:34] but it is a book of mystery until God
[1:28:38] reveals it. That's why Brother Brandham
[1:28:41] says, "Pray for revelation above all
[1:28:43] things." Pray for revelation because
[1:28:45] this book is is a book of prophecy, but
[1:28:48] it's a mysterious book to those that
[1:28:50] don't understand God's mind. That's
[1:28:53] right. Amen.
[1:28:57] The Jews proved it to
[1:29:00] us that if a man doesn't understand
[1:29:03] prophecy, he'll miss the prophecy when
[1:29:05] it is fulfilled.
[1:29:07] Brother Brandham said the way Jesus came
[1:29:09] the first time was different from their
[1:29:12] understanding of that prophecy.
[1:29:15] Yeah. They read the prophecy, the virgin
[1:29:17] shall conceive, but it it was it was
[1:29:19] different to their understanding
[1:29:22] of their of the prophecy. Ain't that
[1:29:26] right? So, so they didn't understand the
[1:29:28] prophecy the way it was given by the
[1:29:30] prophet. So, the the prophecy was
[1:29:33] fulfilled, but not the way they thought
[1:29:34] it would be. Brother Bram said, "See,
[1:29:36] but they should have understandtood it
[1:29:39] being that they were Hebrews." He says,
[1:29:41] "Hebrews, you know, watch after signs
[1:29:44] and prophets because that was to be
[1:29:46] their messenger." And that's the reason
[1:29:48] that they should have never failed to
[1:29:50] have known him because he was coming,
[1:29:53] the son of man.
[1:29:56] They accused him one time of being with
[1:29:58] sinners, hanging out with the sinners
[1:29:59] and eating with the the sinners and
[1:30:01] publicans and all that.
[1:30:03] and and and uh uh but they should have
[1:30:06] understood. They should have understood
[1:30:07] it because Jesus said the son of man
[1:30:10] comes to seek and save that which was
[1:30:12] lost. See, but they didn't understand.
[1:30:14] Brother Brown said they had their own
[1:30:16] theology. They had their theology of
[1:30:18] good living and being fine people and so
[1:30:21] forth, but they didn't understand what
[1:30:24] really their Messiah was to be. Oh, they
[1:30:27] they had the codes and the ethics and
[1:30:29] the way to live and they had it all down
[1:30:32] to the tea, but their understanding of
[1:30:36] prophecy was very little.
[1:30:40] Amen. And brother Brown said that same
[1:30:43] thing could so easily happen again that
[1:30:46] we could misunderstand it in some way.
[1:30:51] Right.
[1:30:52] So he says there's only one way to make
[1:30:56] sure that we don't misunderstand it. And
[1:30:59] he said find out what he was back then.
[1:31:03] And the scripture tells us that he's
[1:31:05] still the same,
[1:31:07] right? And then find out by scriptures
[1:31:12] how he's going to manifest himself when
[1:31:14] he comes.
[1:31:16] Right?
[1:31:17] See, because the prophecy of his coming
[1:31:20] and how he would come and and what he
[1:31:23] would do has already been written in the
[1:31:26] book of
[1:31:36] prophecy. So this Bible is his prophet.
[1:31:40] It's full of prophecy.
[1:31:42] It's a book of prophecy. It's the
[1:31:44] complete revelation of Jesus Christ all
[1:31:46] the way through. So he says we ought to
[1:31:49] search it and see what day we're living
[1:31:52] in because we might be caught in the
[1:31:55] same trap. Prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:31:58] miss it.
[1:32:00] Amen. Now we know that prophecy is being
[1:32:04] fulfilled today. We are assured of that.
[1:32:07] No question.
[1:32:09] Amen. But not the way in the way that
[1:32:11] people think it should be.
[1:32:14] So we're already seeing that people have
[1:32:16] a misunderstanding of what prophecy is.
[1:32:20] Yeah. But it tells us that people
[1:32:23] haven't searched the scriptures. I
[1:32:25] believe had the church world today
[1:32:28] understood what who the prophet of
[1:32:29] Malachi 4 was, they wouldn't have
[1:32:32] rejected his message. Right? Had they
[1:32:35] understood as to what form the son of
[1:32:37] man was to reveal himself, they would
[1:32:38] have not kicked him out of the age of
[1:32:41] the
[1:32:42] church. Had they understood how the
[1:32:44] rapture was to unfold, they would not be
[1:32:47] left behind and going into tribulation.
[1:32:50] Ain't that right? Prophecy of rapture is
[1:32:53] being unfolded right now being
[1:32:54] fulfilled.
[1:32:56] Ain't that right? Yeah. So, so we see
[1:32:59] that men are rising up as the 400
[1:33:02] prophets did in the days of Ahab and
[1:33:05] Makaya and they're rising up and they're
[1:33:09] prophesying of things to come that is
[1:33:11] not for the season of this
[1:33:14] time. Right. Yeah. So if a
[1:33:18] prophecy uh uh someone gives a prophecy
[1:33:21] and it takes away from the word or adds
[1:33:24] to the
[1:33:26] word then they stand in in danger
[1:33:30] cuz their name will be taken their part
[1:33:32] will be taken out of the book of of
[1:33:34] life. Ain't that right? See so so their
[1:33:37] their prophecy has to be false. If if if
[1:33:40] it's contrary to the prophecy
[1:33:43] here, then the prophecy has to be false.
[1:33:48] Amen. Now, first Kings 22 and1, I'm I'm
[1:33:52] just going to read lengthy here, but it
[1:33:54] gives us the count of the 400 prophets
[1:33:56] and what happened. It says, "And they
[1:33:58] continue three years," talking about
[1:34:01] Israel. I don't know what's going on
[1:34:03] with that speaker, but uh they continued
[1:34:06] three years without war between uh Syria
[1:34:10] and
[1:34:11] Israel. Turn that
[1:34:15] off. And it came to pass in the third
[1:34:19] year, turn these mains on. If if they're
[1:34:22] not on, turn them on. Turn these off.
[1:34:25] Uh it come to pass in the third year
[1:34:28] that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came
[1:34:30] down to the king of Israel. And the king
[1:34:32] of Israel said to his servants, "Know ye
[1:34:35] that Ramothth in Gilead is ours and we
[1:34:39] be still and take it not out of the hand
[1:34:43] of the king of Syria." And he said unto
[1:34:46] Jehoshaphat, "Wil thou go with me to
[1:34:48] battle to Ramoth Gilead?" And
[1:34:52] Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
[1:34:54] I am as thou art. My people as thy
[1:34:57] people, my horses, as thy horses, as thy
[1:35:00] horses. Uh, and Jehoshaphat said unto
[1:35:03] the king of Israel, inquire, I pray thee
[1:35:05] at the word of the Lord today. Then the
[1:35:07] king gathered uh the prophets together
[1:35:11] about 400 men, and said unto them, Shall
[1:35:13] I go to against Ramothgilead to for to
[1:35:16] battle, or should I or shall I forebear?
[1:35:19] And they said, "Go up." See, prophecy go
[1:35:23] up for the Lord shall deliver it into
[1:35:26] the hand of the king. Now, that was a
[1:35:30] good prophecy. How many believes that?
[1:35:31] That that was a good prophecy. Any any
[1:35:33] Bible believer knows that that was a
[1:35:35] pretty good prophecy. See, but and and
[1:35:38] and they were all saying the same thing.
[1:35:41] So, it it it sounded good, right? Yeah.
[1:35:44] And Jehoshaphat though being a righteous
[1:35:47] man said, "But is there not a prophet of
[1:35:50] the Lord besides?" Amen. That we might
[1:35:54] inquire of him. So So he wasn't a a
[1:35:58] righteous man. Wasn't just willing to
[1:36:00] accept all prophecy.
[1:36:05] Oh my, how the people of today are just
[1:36:08] willing to accept anything that sounds
[1:36:09] good.
[1:36:11] See, but but Jehoshaphat wasn't willing
[1:36:13] just to accept any prophecy that came
[1:36:15] forth. And the king of Israel said unto
[1:36:17] Jehoshaphat, "Oh yeah, there is one man
[1:36:21] uh Maya, the son of Imla, uh by whom we
[1:36:26] may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him,
[1:36:28] for he does not prophesy good concerning
[1:36:31] me, but evil." And and Jehoshaphat said,
[1:36:34] "Let not the king say so." and and and
[1:36:36] and the king of Israel called an officer
[1:36:39] and said, "Hasten hither Micaiah uh
[1:36:41] Makaya uh the son of Imla." And the king
[1:36:44] of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of
[1:36:46] Judah sat each on his throne having on
[1:36:49] put on their robes in a void place in
[1:36:51] the entrance of the gate of Samaria. and
[1:36:54] all the prophets prophesied before them
[1:36:56] and and and uh Zedekiah the son of um uh
[1:37:00] well his father I don't know Jana
[1:37:03] something like that made him horns of
[1:37:05] iron and he said thus sayeth the Lord
[1:37:08] with these thou shalt push the Syrians
[1:37:10] until thou hast consumed them and all
[1:37:13] the prophets prophesied so saying go up
[1:37:15] to Ramad Gilead and prosper for the Lord
[1:37:18] shall deliver it into the king's hand
[1:37:21] and the messenger that was gone to
[1:37:22] Micaaya said uh spake unto him, saying,
[1:37:25] "Now, behold now, the words of the
[1:37:27] prophets declare good unto the king with
[1:37:29] one mouth. Let thy word I pray thee be
[1:37:32] like the word of one of them, and speak
[1:37:34] that which is good." And Micaiah says,
[1:37:36] "As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith
[1:37:39] unto me, that will I speak." So he came
[1:37:41] to the king, and the king said unto him,
[1:37:44] Mckaya, shall we go against Rama's
[1:37:47] Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?
[1:37:49] And he answered and said, "Go and
[1:37:51] prosper, for the Lord shall deliver it
[1:37:53] into the hand of the king." Now notice,
[1:37:56] I I just think this is, you know, uh uh
[1:37:58] funny. And the king said unto him, "How
[1:38:01] many times shall I adjure thee that thou
[1:38:04] tell me nothing but that which is true
[1:38:06] in the name of the Lord?"
[1:38:10] Hey, that's funny. You
[1:38:14] know, he's got all these guys telling
[1:38:17] going up, going on up. It's thus sayith
[1:38:18] the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord, go on
[1:38:20] up. And here comes a true prophet
[1:38:22] standing there and he tells him saying,
[1:38:23] "Go on up. The Lord's with it." Now, how
[1:38:25] many times I told you, you tell me the
[1:38:29] truth. So he says, "All right." He said,
[1:38:32] "I saw all Israel scattered upon the
[1:38:35] heels as a sheep that have not a
[1:38:37] shepherd, and the Lord said, these have
[1:38:39] no master. Let them return every man to
[1:38:41] his house in peace." And the king of
[1:38:43] Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, "Did not I
[1:38:46] tell thee that he would prophesy no good
[1:38:48] concern of me but evil?"
[1:38:53] And he said, "Hear thou therefore the
[1:38:56] word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting
[1:38:57] on his throne, and all the host of
[1:38:59] heaven standing by him on his right hand
[1:39:02] and on his left." And the Lord said,
[1:39:04] "Who shall persuade Ahab that he may go
[1:39:07] up and fall at Ramth of Gilead?" And one
[1:39:09] said on this manner, another said on
[1:39:11] this manner, and there came forth a
[1:39:13] spirit, and stood before the Lord, and
[1:39:16] said, I will persuade him. And the Lord
[1:39:18] said unto him, wherewith he says, well,
[1:39:21] I will go forth and I will be a lying
[1:39:23] spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
[1:39:26] See, and he said, thou shalt persuade
[1:39:28] him. Th what a prophecy. Thou shalt pro
[1:39:32] persuade him and prevail also. Go forth
[1:39:36] and do so. Now therefore, behold, the
[1:39:38] Lord hath put a lying spirit in the
[1:39:40] mouth of all these thy prophets, and the
[1:39:42] Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee.
[1:39:44] So this lying spirit, Brother Brown
[1:39:46] said, come from the pits of hell. Amen.
[1:39:50] Can you say amen?
[1:39:53] This ought to tell us that Satan cannot
[1:39:56] do what he wants to anytime he thinks he
[1:39:58] can. That's right.
[1:40:00] He is doing what God has bid him to do.
[1:40:03] Ain't that right? Now it is true that
[1:40:06] they were the seed of Abraham. It is
[1:40:08] true that God had given them the land
[1:40:10] for possession. It it is true that the
[1:40:13] prophecy says that that God told
[1:40:17] Abraham, "Thy seed shall possess the
[1:40:18] gates of their enemy." All of these
[1:40:21] things were true.
[1:40:24] But there had been a prophecy. Amen.
[1:40:26] Also spoken against Ahab, right? Yeah.
[1:40:30] And so in First Kings 21:19, the Lord
[1:40:34] tells the prophet Elijah what to say to
[1:40:36] Ahab. And thou shalt speak unto him,
[1:40:38] saying, thus sayith the Lord, hast thou
[1:40:41] killed and also taken possession. See?
[1:40:45] And thou shalt speak unto him, saying,
[1:40:47] Thus sayith the Lord, in the place where
[1:40:49] the dogs lick the blood of Nabth, shall
[1:40:51] dogs lick thy blood, even thine. Amen.
[1:40:55] So now there's a prophecy, right? Yes.
[1:41:01] So, this prophecy had been laying there
[1:41:04] all that time. I don't know how many
[1:41:05] years it was laying there, but it had
[1:41:07] been laying there. Amen. And now it was
[1:41:11] the season for it to be fulfilled.
[1:41:15] So, all of these other prophets that
[1:41:17] were prophesied going up, going up, it
[1:41:19] sounded good. It was a good prophecy and
[1:41:21] it seemed to be right according to
[1:41:23] scripture, but it wasn't the season.
[1:41:27] That's right.
[1:41:29] Right. See, so prophecy is not just
[1:41:32] randomly fulfilled. That's right. I
[1:41:36] don't think it was just random that
[1:41:38] we've got a pope from America. I don't
[1:41:40] think it's just random that we've got a
[1:41:43] whole cabinet of of the president's
[1:41:45] cabinets that are Catholics. I don't
[1:41:48] think it's just random that our new pope
[1:41:52] is having a mass today, inaugurational
[1:41:54] mass, and and and most of the top or all
[1:41:57] the top associates of of of Trump's
[1:42:00] cabinet are there. I don't think it's
[1:42:03] just random that that that we're having
[1:42:06] issues in the world. There's a timing
[1:42:09] for
[1:42:10] things prophecy that had been laying
[1:42:13] there and laying there for years and
[1:42:15] years and years. Christians have have
[1:42:17] gone to the grave believing it. We're
[1:42:19] sitting here watching these things.
[1:42:24] Prophecy. Amen.
[1:42:26] Brother Brown said, "Isn't it strange
[1:42:28] that that king after that prophecy and
[1:42:32] putting it on the word of God that he
[1:42:35] still didn't understand that he went
[1:42:38] right on anyhow because the word of God
[1:42:41] had to be fulfilled?" Amen. Can you say
[1:42:45] amen? So even prophecy doesn't convince
[1:42:48] people.
[1:42:51] Now closely he says put on your shock
[1:42:53] proof jackets. Isn't it a strange thing
[1:42:56] that God will send a truth to a people
[1:42:59] and in spite of all the preaching till
[1:43:01] you could get horse and die people will
[1:43:03] plunge right on down the road after some
[1:43:05] kind of fantastic fanaticism instead of
[1:43:08] stay with the word of God. Why? The
[1:43:11] Bible says they were ordained of old to
[1:43:14] this condemnation. They went out from us
[1:43:16] because they wasn't of us. Paul says
[1:43:18] after my departing uh grievious woos
[1:43:21] will uh come uh men of your own groups
[1:43:24] will raise up perverse things. He said
[1:43:27] if an angel from heaven would preach any
[1:43:29] other thing than what I've taught, let
[1:43:30] him be accursed.
[1:43:33] God can vindicate it. God can send a man
[1:43:36] and vindicate it so supernaturally and
[1:43:38] people still plunge into death.
[1:43:43] It has to be because it was ordained to
[1:43:45] be prophecy has to be fulfilled,
[1:43:49] right?
[1:43:51] No doubt these 400 prophets were sincere
[1:43:53] in what they were saying. Brother Ram
[1:43:56] said, "These men weren't just overnight
[1:43:58] men. They were selected handpicked
[1:44:01] group, but it was man's hands that
[1:44:03] picked them. God had picked one little
[1:44:06] old holy roller. Yeah, that right. Good
[1:44:09] men, sincere men. But notice what
[1:44:14] happened. A lying spirit entered them.
[1:44:19] Think about it. I wonder what they would
[1:44:21] have done if it wasn't just a lying
[1:44:25] spirit. If it was just them. And Ahab
[1:44:27] says, "What shall we do?" Well, I don't
[1:44:29] know about
[1:44:30] that. I don't
[1:44:32] know. But God says, "Who will I
[1:44:35] persuade? Who will I send to persuade
[1:44:37] Ahab?" See, the time of prophecy must be
[1:44:39] fulfilled.
[1:44:41] And I got to persuade him to go.
[1:44:44] So this lying spirit says, "I'll go.
[1:44:46] I'll get into them mouths."
[1:44:49] Man, think about it.
[1:44:51] So that that lying spirit was able to
[1:44:54] cause every one of those so-called
[1:44:56] prophets to prophesy a
[1:44:59] lie. Brother Brian said because they
[1:45:01] didn't know the word.
[1:45:04] I want you to understand that. See a a a
[1:45:06] lying spirit or any spirit of Satan
[1:45:10] cannot come to that elect. Cannot get
[1:45:12] into the mouth of of the elect.
[1:45:16] Those that know the word to be true.
[1:45:19] Hello. But these men did not know the
[1:45:22] word. They didn't know that there was a
[1:45:24] prophecy there. They hadn't studied the
[1:45:26] prophecies. They didn't know the season,
[1:45:28] the timing that they were in. So
[1:45:31] therefore, because they didn't know the
[1:45:33] word, a lying spirit was able to get
[1:45:35] into them and prophesy a lie.
[1:45:39] Oh yeah.
[1:45:41] Now, Brother Brandham tells it like
[1:45:42] this. He said that line spirit said, "I
[1:45:44] can get in that seminary easy cuz they
[1:45:47] don't have no more much prayer meeting
[1:45:49] and no agonizing. There's nothing around
[1:45:52] there. No blood. So I can just walk in
[1:45:54] anytime I want to. I can take possession
[1:45:57] of that thing, that whole denomination.
[1:45:59] I can get the I can get the whole thing.
[1:46:01] They they don't even believe in the
[1:46:02] blood. I can take the whole thing." God
[1:46:04] said, "That's right. You can do that."
[1:46:06] Yeah.
[1:46:08] And that spirit says, "Well, I can go
[1:46:09] down and get in them fellas and cause
[1:46:11] them to prophesy lie. All them
[1:46:12] preachers, every one of them, all the
[1:46:14] great theology, I'll just blind their
[1:46:17] eyes from the word. That's all I have to
[1:46:19] do is keep that word so they that they
[1:46:21] can't see it." You know, God does that a
[1:46:24] lot of times. He says they got eyes and
[1:46:26] can't see, ears and can't hear. Said,
[1:46:29] "I'll blind their eyes and they can't
[1:46:31] see it." I'm just go down and cause them
[1:46:33] to be inspired and they'll prophesy a
[1:46:36] lie. So, not all inspiration is of God.
[1:46:41] Amen. And no, not all prophecy is of
[1:46:43] God. That's right. Can you say amen?
[1:46:46] Now, notice what he says, brother, if
[1:46:49] there's anything that a bornagain
[1:46:51] Christian ought to know and study,
[1:46:53] that's the word of God. You should be in
[1:46:56] these tapes on a daily basis. You should
[1:46:59] be praying. You should be reading on a
[1:47:01] daily basis the Bible. That's right.
[1:47:04] Hello. Cuz I'm telling you, we're living
[1:47:06] in the greatest deception. You think
[1:47:08] that was something? Amen. Them them them
[1:47:10] 400 prophets to be deceived.
[1:47:13] It wasn't even written that they would
[1:47:14] be deceived uh a forehand on that
[1:47:17] certain thing. Micaiah the prophet just
[1:47:21] saw the meeting in heaven. That's right.
[1:47:24] But it has been written in this last day
[1:47:28] that this would be the most deceptive
[1:47:29] age ever.
[1:47:32] Amen.
[1:47:34] That it would deceive the very elect if
[1:47:36] it was possible. But it's not possible.
[1:47:39] God sent a prophet with thus sayith the
[1:47:42] Lord.
[1:47:43] The lamb has opened the word.
[1:47:47] We ought to know the word.
[1:47:52] Can you say amen?
[1:47:53] I don't want to know what your thoughts
[1:47:55] are. I don't want to know your lifestyle
[1:47:58] and what your little convictions are and
[1:48:00] what you think.
[1:48:02] I want to know what the word says. Give
[1:48:05] me the word.
[1:48:07] Right. We got to know the word.
[1:48:11] See, so listen, brother Brandon says
[1:48:14] another place. Listen, you old saint.
[1:48:15] Shame on you. That's been saved for 20
[1:48:18] and 30 years and still known still know
[1:48:21] no more about the word of God than to
[1:48:23] fall for some little sensation. Are we
[1:48:25] not seeing these things happen? Amen.
[1:48:28] People fall for prophecy. They fall for
[1:48:30] some little gift that a man has or
[1:48:32] whatever and he can say something and
[1:48:34] they'll just leave a church. They'll
[1:48:35] leave this. They'll go this and they
[1:48:37] just follow right on checking that word.
[1:48:42] Got to know the word. Amen. So he said,
[1:48:44] "See, you've been living on excitement."
[1:48:45] Now he's talking to the Pentecostals.
[1:48:47] You've been living on excitement upon
[1:48:49] your church. Oh, we have this church.
[1:48:51] It's the biggest. Well, he's probably
[1:48:52] talking to everybody, all the
[1:48:53] denominations and all that. It's the
[1:48:55] biggest in the city one of these days.
[1:48:57] We'll build a bigger church uh than them
[1:49:00] over there. See, you got your head in
[1:49:02] the television at night. You're reading
[1:49:04] that old True Story magazine and all
[1:49:06] kinds of Tommy Rot like that when you
[1:49:09] ought to have your head daily in the
[1:49:11] word of God.
[1:49:14] People's got Satan's got it to where
[1:49:16] people just don't get into the word no
[1:49:18] more. Movies have become such a thing.
[1:49:23] Television to where people can't even
[1:49:25] conquer that stupid old devil.
[1:49:28] Amen. Then on top of that, we've got we
[1:49:30] we've got our phones
[1:49:37] and people are getting away from the
[1:49:38] real sincerity of the word. When's the
[1:49:41] last time you really listened to a tape?
[1:49:44] When's the last time you just sat there
[1:49:46] and listened to what a prophet of God
[1:49:48] said and prayed over it and said, "God,
[1:49:51] reveal that to me." Well, church, you
[1:49:53] better do it. We got to know the word.
[1:49:56] We got to get into that word.
[1:50:00] Can you say amen? Now, remember the
[1:50:03] prophet talked or Jesus talked about
[1:50:05] four grounds and the seed was sowed on
[1:50:08] all them grounds. But Satan was able to
[1:50:11] take over.
[1:50:13] The word was sowed on one ground and
[1:50:15] Satan was able to take over. A word was
[1:50:17] fall on another ground and Satan was
[1:50:19] able to take over to where the word did
[1:50:21] not have an effect. It was only on good
[1:50:24] ground. And I'm not here trying to scare
[1:50:26] anybody, but I am trying to say we ought
[1:50:29] to live sober in this age.
[1:50:32] That's right. Amen.
[1:50:34] That's true, brother.
[1:50:36] when you ought to have your head daily
[1:50:38] in the word of God. He said, "Now to you
[1:50:40] preachers," I was talking to the leoty.
[1:50:42] Now to you preachers, if you didn't have
[1:50:45] your mind on whether you was going to be
[1:50:46] a big shot or
[1:50:48] not, whether you was going to go to the
[1:50:50] next conference, they're going to put a
[1:50:53] feather in your hat or your little
[1:50:54] denomination's going to do this or that
[1:50:56] or the other. You got your head in other
[1:50:58] things besides the word of God. When
[1:51:01] that enemy comes to the city, you'd be
[1:51:03] standing on the wall warning the people
[1:51:05] about it. Can you say amen?
[1:51:08] See why? Because you know the word. Not
[1:51:11] preaching your opinion, not preaching
[1:51:13] your idea, not preaching your own little
[1:51:16] convictions, but you're preaching from
[1:51:18] thus sayith the Lord. Why? Because you
[1:51:21] know the word for the hour.
[1:51:24] Ain't that right? Satan's got the
[1:51:27] children caught up in movies
[1:51:29] and and he's starting them off because
[1:51:31] parents let them got our phone these
[1:51:33] days and play the cartoons and of
[1:51:36] anything. We we don't care. It's all
[1:51:37] kids stuff.
[1:51:40] How ignorant people can get.
[1:51:45] You let some old backsliding gay guy
[1:51:47] come up with some cartoon and we all
[1:51:49] think it's funny and cute and sit there
[1:51:51] and let our children watch it.
[1:51:55] That's right.
[1:51:58] And we know good and well they're half
[1:51:59] gay anyways and homosexuals and
[1:52:01] communists and everything else out of
[1:52:03] that hell hole. That's exactly right.
[1:52:08] Amen.
[1:52:10] Satan's got them caught up in video
[1:52:12] games and all kinds of entertainment to
[1:52:14] where they don't know the word.
[1:52:22] Can you say amen?
[1:52:24] Parents get caught up in church fights
[1:52:26] and church arguments and caught up in
[1:52:29] this and that and this and you know
[1:52:32] following this gift, that gift, some
[1:52:34] personality, traditions and all these
[1:52:37] things and they're ignorant of Satan's
[1:52:38] agenda. They just fall right in the trap
[1:52:41] of it because they don't know the word.
[1:52:45] They don't know prophecy being
[1:52:47] fulfilled. Yeah.
[1:52:50] You remember there's a prophecy. Brother
[1:52:52] Brand warned that church said, "You
[1:52:53] better watch it. You're living close
[1:52:54] right now. You're close together right
[1:52:56] now." But remember my warning. Satan
[1:52:58] ain't going to let it stay that way.
[1:53:00] He'll send someone in under the skies of
[1:53:03] everything and then all of a sudden
[1:53:04] shoot a poison dart. People don't know
[1:53:07] that prophecy. They don't care about
[1:53:08] such prophecies as that.
[1:53:11] Amen.
[1:53:15] It's prophecies, right? Amen.
[1:53:19] And so they're wrapped up in everything
[1:53:22] and they don't know the word. So what
[1:53:24] does that mean? It makes it so easy as
[1:53:28] it was for that lying spirit to get in
[1:53:30] them preachers. It became so easy for
[1:53:33] Satan to make havoc in the church. Makes
[1:53:36] havoc in the home. Make havoc in our
[1:53:38] minds. Make havoc everywhere to where
[1:53:41] we're just following him. Lead. He's
[1:53:43] just leading enticing spirits. Oh, I'm
[1:53:45] just so discouraged. I'm just so this.
[1:53:47] Hey, what about down the road? What
[1:53:50] about this? What about that? Okay. Okay.
[1:53:53] Okay. You You understand what I'm
[1:53:54] saying? Because we don't know the word.
[1:53:58] The Bible says he's the god of this age.
[1:54:01] Brother Bram said people worshiping
[1:54:03] Satan thinking and they're ignorantly
[1:54:05] worshiping Satan because they don't know
[1:54:06] the word and they're thinking they're
[1:54:08] worshiping God.
[1:54:12] It's
[1:54:13] prophecy.
[1:54:14] prophecy being fulfilled. Right?
[1:54:19] So, we find that they're ignorant of the
[1:54:21] fact that this is the season for Satan
[1:54:23] to become incarnate in a man. You
[1:54:26] realize that it's already prophesied
[1:54:28] that Satan's going to become incarnate
[1:54:30] in a man. Right?
[1:54:33] And the people don't know the word.
[1:54:36] They're putting him there. They're in
[1:54:38] the season of the age.
[1:54:42] Yes.
[1:54:44] deceived, following these
[1:54:46] things, blessing things that that God
[1:54:50] has cursed, and cursing things that God
[1:54:53] has blessed because they're ignorant of
[1:54:56] the season that they're living in about
[1:54:58] prophecy. That's right.
[1:55:02] So, they're ignorant of the fact that
[1:55:03] they're worshiping Satan and thinking
[1:55:05] they're worshiping God. They're ignorant
[1:55:08] of the word, the prophecy of this last
[1:55:10] day. Ain't that right? And sa Satan is
[1:55:12] able to speak through them, use them as
[1:55:16] he did those 400 prophets. But that true
[1:55:19] prophet knew the word.
[1:55:22] Aren't you glad we had a prophet that
[1:55:24] knew the word? Yes, sir. Satan, that
[1:55:26] lying spirit couldn't get in that
[1:55:28] prophet. I don't care what these critics
[1:55:30] say. Amen. Brother Brandon wasn't a
[1:55:31] liar.
[1:55:33] He wasn't preaching his opinion. He was
[1:55:35] preaching, "Thus said the Lord, to get a
[1:55:37] bride ready for this day so that we
[1:55:40] could lean upon them prophecies and not
[1:55:42] be deceived."
[1:55:44] Amen. That's right.
[1:55:47] That's the truth. That lying spirit
[1:55:48] couldn't get in that prophet's mouth.
[1:55:51] Did you know he can't get in the mouth
[1:55:52] of this bride either?
[1:55:55] Prophet said the bride, the word is
[1:55:56] already in the bride. She has thus
[1:55:58] sayith the Lord or she keeps still. Can
[1:56:01] you say amen? There's a line of spirits
[1:56:03] going all around. People prophesying
[1:56:05] good things for America, good things for
[1:56:06] the world. Revival's coming. Revival's
[1:56:08] coming. Revival's coming. It ain't
[1:56:10] coming. A prophet's already prophesied.
[1:56:13] Don't even pray for America. That's
[1:56:15] right. Amen. That's right.
[1:56:20] You realize that this is the season that
[1:56:21] the wheat and tears are maturing, sir.
[1:56:24] Fulfilling prophecy. Brother Brandham
[1:56:26] says, "Watch. The tears are already
[1:56:28] maturing fast, very fast, under corrupt
[1:56:30] teachers who turn the people from the
[1:56:32] word. But the weed also must mature. And
[1:56:36] to her, God is sending the prophet
[1:56:38] messenger with a vindicated ministry
[1:56:40] that he might be accepted by the elect.
[1:56:43] I'll accept him. I accept his message.
[1:56:47] They will hear him as the first church
[1:56:49] heard Paul. And she will mature in the
[1:56:52] word until becoming a word bride. The
[1:56:56] mighty works will be found in her that
[1:56:58] are always attended upon the pure word
[1:57:00] and faith. Can you say amen? So you see
[1:57:03] that God didn't send a true prophet to
[1:57:05] deceive the people.
[1:57:09] I'm not deceived
[1:57:11] by following a vindicated message.
[1:57:17] God promised to send the spirit of truth
[1:57:18] in this day. How many believes that he
[1:57:21] promised it? See, and it came to a
[1:57:23] prophet and anointed him to tell us the
[1:57:26] truth. Amen. As that lion spirit coming
[1:57:29] to them 400 p uh uh uh uh uh 400
[1:57:32] prophets, I could imagine God waiting
[1:57:34] for this time in the time of deception.
[1:57:37] God would see a spirit of truth to
[1:57:40] anoint a prophet to speak thus sayith
[1:57:42] the Lord and reveal the mysteries to us.
[1:57:45] Hallelujah. That we could be ready for a
[1:57:47] rapture. Amen. Bless the name of the
[1:57:50] Lord. Lord, it revealed the day we're
[1:57:53] living in. It revealed what is to take
[1:57:54] place in this day. revealed the
[1:57:56] believer's future and the unbeliever's
[1:57:58] future. Can you say amen? And yet at the
[1:58:01] same time, there's a lying spirit that
[1:58:02] has anointed false prophets to lie,
[1:58:05] prophesy a
[1:58:07] lie. It's already prophesied that it
[1:58:10] would come. Right?
[1:58:12] Matthew 7:15, Jesus said, "Beware of
[1:58:14] false prophets which come to you in
[1:58:16] sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
[1:58:18] ravening wolves." Matthew 24:11,
[1:58:20] breaking in, "Many false prophets shall
[1:58:22] arise and shall deceive many." Matthew
[1:58:25] 24:24, for there shall arise false
[1:58:27] Christs and false prophets, and shall
[1:58:29] show great signs and wonders in so much
[1:58:31] that if it were possible, they shall
[1:58:32] deceive the very elect. 1 John 4:1,
[1:58:36] beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[1:58:37] try the spirits, whether they are of
[1:58:39] God. For many false prophets, because
[1:58:41] many false prophets are gone out into
[1:58:43] the world. Can you say amen? And brother
[1:58:46] Brown said they have to go out there in
[1:58:48] order to bring the word of God to pass.
[1:58:51] This is the season. And this is the time
[1:58:52] of prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:58:56] Prophesying a lie. That same lying
[1:58:58] spirit is running rampant.
[1:59:02] Brother Bram said, "So many people are
[1:59:03] listening to enticing spirits instead of
[1:59:05] taking the word of God. Spirits are in
[1:59:07] the world. They're demons. And they go
[1:59:09] out in places. They get amongst men,
[1:59:11] ministers. They get amongst church
[1:59:12] members. They get amongst good people.
[1:59:14] And they cause them to come into an
[1:59:16] illusion. and they say things and do
[1:59:18] things and teach things and practice
[1:59:20] things that's contrary to the word of
[1:59:22] God.
[1:59:23] Can you say amen? See, so there's only
[1:59:26] one prophet that God promised to send to
[1:59:29] us. He didn't say, "I'm going to send
[1:59:30] unto you prophets." He said, "I'll send
[1:59:33] unto you the prophet of Elijah."
[1:59:36] Praise the Lord. And that's the prophet
[1:59:38] of Malachi 4. Can you say amen? That's
[1:59:42] where the spirit of truth is.
[1:59:44] That spirit of truth lays on them tapes.
[1:59:46] Them spirit of truth is in this bride
[1:59:49] that's attended upon the word of God.
[1:59:52] You believe that? So he that the prophet
[1:59:55] the spirit of truth that is upon that
[1:59:58] prophet that came upon that prophet has
[2:00:00] showed us the prophecy for this season.
[2:00:03] The only group of people that will not
[2:00:05] be deceived by these false prophets and
[2:00:07] false teachers and false prophesiers is
[2:00:11] the elect of God. Amen.
[2:00:15] And notice the people that are deceived
[2:00:18] are those who did not have a love for
[2:00:19] the truth. They heard the truth but
[2:00:22] didn't have a love for it. 2
[2:00:24] Thessalonians 2:7, the mystery of
[2:00:26] iniquity doth already work. Only he who
[2:00:28] now letth will let until he be taken out
[2:00:31] of the way. And then shall that wicked
[2:00:33] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
[2:00:35] with the spirit of his mouth. See, and
[2:00:38] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[2:00:40] coming, even him whose coming is after
[2:00:42] the working of Satan, with all power,
[2:00:44] signs, and lying wonders, with all
[2:00:46] deceivleness of unrighteousness in them
[2:00:49] that perish, because they receive not
[2:00:51] the love of the truth, that they might
[2:00:53] be saved. For this cause God shall send
[2:00:55] them strong delusion, a lying spirit,
[2:00:59] right? That they shall believe a should
[2:01:01] believe a lie. that they all might be
[2:01:03] damned who believed not the truth but
[2:01:05] had pleasure in unrighteousness. Ain't
[2:01:07] that right? See, Ahab didn't love the
[2:01:10] truth. God sent a prophet of Elijah in
[2:01:12] his day. He didn't love
[2:01:14] it. There was that prophet
[2:01:17] Micaiah. He said, "Well, I hate him as
[2:01:20] all of the time prophesying. Why Why
[2:01:22] don't you Why didn't he just turn
[2:01:23] around?"
[2:01:26] He couldn't.
[2:01:28] He had to fulfill his day.
[2:01:31] There was nothing in him to repent.
[2:01:33] Yeah. Amen. Can you say amen?
[2:01:36] See, so so listen
[2:01:39] now. Prophecy for this day has been set
[2:01:42] and there's nothing that can change
[2:01:44] that. The 400 prophets, even though they
[2:01:47] were prophesying good things, couldn't
[2:01:48] change the prophecy that Elijah had
[2:01:51] said, right? Because it was the season.
[2:01:54] It was the time. See? So when God gets
[2:01:57] ready to fulfill prophecy, nothing's
[2:01:59] going to stop it.
[2:02:01] Things will start
[2:02:02] happening when the time comes for
[2:02:05] prophecy to be
[2:02:06] fulfilled. See, it may seem like things
[2:02:08] are out of cater today. It may seem like
[2:02:11] things are just so chaotic, but if
[2:02:12] you'll stop and think about it, it's
[2:02:15] prophecy. Amen.
[2:02:18] Ain't that right? Amen.
[2:02:21] If you'll look for just a moment and
[2:02:24] I'll get ready to
[2:02:25] close, but if you look what's been
[2:02:27] prophesied to happen for the age you're
[2:02:29] living
[2:02:31] in, you see, nations will come to the
[2:02:36] forefront to fulfill prophecy and
[2:02:38] nations will
[2:02:40] decease or fall back. Kingdoms will rise
[2:02:45] and fall. Look at Russia in 1964.
[2:02:48] Brother Brham said Russia only received
[2:02:50] her place in the world in science no
[2:02:52] more than 40 years
[2:02:54] ago. And you know when the first world
[2:02:56] war come, he said they ignored Russia.
[2:02:59] It was just a bunch of ignoramis' big
[2:03:02] old Siberians the beard all over their
[2:03:04] face. They didn't know right and left
[2:03:07] hand. That's right. But
[2:03:09] Russia Russia but she recognized her
[2:03:13] place. She had to do it to fulfill
[2:03:15] scripture. You know my prophecies of
[2:03:18] what I said would happen. How all of
[2:03:20] them would gather in communism. Now she
[2:03:22] leads the world in science. We're way
[2:03:24] back way back behind her. All the rest
[2:03:27] of the world is behind her. She leads
[2:03:29] her place. She just recognized she had
[2:03:31] some brains too. Another place Russia
[2:03:35] reason Russia come to herself. She had
[2:03:37] to just like Israel had to get in the
[2:03:40] homeland. God had to drive Israel back
[2:03:42] to the homeland for the trumpets. And so
[2:03:44] did God have to drive Russia up there in
[2:03:47] communism to do exactly what's been
[2:03:49] prophesied she would do.
[2:03:52] Another one when the whole thing begins
[2:03:54] to leak out and the righteous seed
[2:03:56] begins setting on the on the side
[2:03:59] getting thinner and thinner and the
[2:04:01] wicked just keeps on very religious just
[2:04:03] keeps getting wicer and wicider. See
[2:04:06] well there's nothing to do but destroy
[2:04:08] the whole thing like he did back there
[2:04:09] in the ant and to deluvian destruction.
[2:04:12] Every thought a man is continually full
[2:04:14] of sin. Every man thinks about today see
[2:04:17] is a bottle of whiskey or a woman or
[2:04:19] running around. So he can't live true to
[2:04:21] their wives. Boys can't live true to the
[2:04:23] girls. Girls can't live true to the
[2:04:25] boys. And see why they're in such a
[2:04:27] place till the devil's got them so bound
[2:04:29] and possessed with evil spirits. The
[2:04:31] whole thing's become a conglomeration of
[2:04:34] sin. That's the reason we're in the day.
[2:04:36] That's the reason Russia is playing
[2:04:39] exactly in the hands of God to rock this
[2:04:42] thing out here. The Bible says so.
[2:04:44] Certainly God's using communism. He'll
[2:04:46] use it and communism will destroy the
[2:04:49] entire thing according to the scripture
[2:04:51] and we're in that day. Can you say amen?
[2:04:54] Amen. So we we we can say more and more
[2:04:57] about these things of how that men
[2:05:00] become, you know, they were born for a
[2:05:03] purpose in their day to fulfill the word
[2:05:05] just like Moses. Moses was born to
[2:05:07] fulfill prophecy to lead the people out
[2:05:10] of children out. But Pharaoh was born
[2:05:12] too. Amen. He just didn't happen to be
[2:05:16] there sticking the mud. He was born to
[2:05:20] fulfill scripture.
[2:05:22] Amen. That's right.
[2:05:24] Can you say amen? Amen.
[2:05:27] See, he was born to uh take his place.
[2:05:31] Romans 9:17, for this for the scripture
[2:05:33] saith unto Pharaoh, even for this same
[2:05:35] purpose have I raised thee up that I
[2:05:37] might show my power in thee, that my
[2:05:39] name might be declared through all
[2:05:41] throughout all the earth. Ain't that
[2:05:43] right? Judas came on the scene to
[2:05:45] fulfill prophecy. And at that same time,
[2:05:48] as Jesus came on the scene, Judas came
[2:05:50] on the scene to fulfill prophecy. And
[2:05:53] Judas was just as ordained to fulfill
[2:05:55] his role as Jesus was to for ordained to
[2:05:58] fulfill his role. Esau was just as
[2:06:01] ordained to fulfill his part as Jacob
[2:06:03] was ordained to take his position. Can
[2:06:05] you say amen? See, and so one was
[2:06:09] ordained to see what was happening and
[2:06:11] the other one wasn't. Moses could see
[2:06:14] what God was doing. Pharaoh couldn't.
[2:06:19] Hello. Brother Bram says Pharaoh saw the
[2:06:22] hand of God come down and perform
[2:06:23] miracles in there, but it only hardened
[2:06:25] his heart. See why? He couldn't see that
[2:06:28] God was fulfilling prophecy. Abraham
[2:06:31] could see what God was doing, but Lot
[2:06:33] couldn't. Jesus knew that prophecy was
[2:06:35] being
[2:06:36] fulfilled. Ain't that right? He knew
[2:06:39] what time and season he was living in,
[2:06:41] but Judas didn't.
[2:06:45] Abraham said he was one of Jesus'
[2:06:46] disciples walking with him, performing
[2:06:48] miracles with him and yet he couldn't
[2:06:49] see that prophecy was being fulfilled.
[2:06:52] Balam was a prophet and yet he couldn't
[2:06:53] see what God was doing. Couldn't see the
[2:06:55] pillar of fire, the brazen serpent,
[2:06:57] couldn't see the angel of the covenant.
[2:06:59] Dayan, brother Bram said, Dayan being a
[2:07:01] Jew himself couldn't see that prophecy
[2:07:03] being fulfilled. He had come through the
[2:07:05] Dead Sea and eat mana every night that
[2:07:06] fell fresh and yet still couldn't see
[2:07:08] it. Hey, Ephesus was was head of the
[2:07:12] religious man, you know, head religious
[2:07:14] man of the world at that time. Yet, he
[2:07:15] couldn't see prophecy being
[2:07:17] fulfilled. Brother says, "Why couldn't
[2:07:19] these men see it?" The word had to be
[2:07:21] fulfilled. The Bible says they was
[2:07:23] raised up to take that place. They were
[2:07:25] raised for that purpose. Can you say
[2:07:28] amen? But oh my, we're raised up for
[2:07:31] this purpose. Aren't you glad for that?
[2:07:34] Amen. And Judas may have, you know, I
[2:07:36] got to thinking about that for just a
[2:07:37] moment, but Judas might have been a good
[2:07:39] guy. He must have been a good guy.
[2:07:42] Because when Jesus told him says, "Uh,
[2:07:44] one of you going to betray me." All he
[2:07:45] all 12 of them are sitting right there.
[2:07:46] And he says, "One of y'all going to be
[2:07:47] betraying me." And not one of them says,
[2:07:49] "Ah, Judas, I knew that little scumbag.
[2:07:52] He's been a jerk all along. Smart elk
[2:07:54] and this and that. I I don't know. I bet
[2:07:57] you it's him." No. They were all looking
[2:08:00] at themselves and wondering, "Is it me?"
[2:08:03] Amen. Right.
[2:08:07] But the Bible says that when
[2:08:10] Judas said, "Is it
[2:08:13] I?" Jesus says, "He that dipth his hand
[2:08:17] with me in the dish, the same shall
[2:08:19] betray me." The son of man goeth as it
[2:08:22] is written of him. But woe unto that man
[2:08:24] by whom the son of man is betrayed. It
[2:08:26] had been good for that man if he had not
[2:08:28] been born. Then Judas which betrayed him
[2:08:31] answered and said, "Master, is it I?"
[2:08:34] And he said unto him, "Thou hast
[2:08:37] said." And notice in John 13:27,
[2:08:40] speaking of that same event, Yeah. said,
[2:08:42] "And after the soop," think about it.
[2:08:45] Satan entered into him. That's it right
[2:08:49] there. Think of
[2:08:52] that. I, you know, Judas definitely
[2:08:55] wasn't a believer. I believe brother
[2:08:57] Brown said he was jealous of Jesus's
[2:08:59] ministry and all
[2:09:01] that, but think of
[2:09:04] it. At the right time, Satan entered
[2:09:08] into him and took over
[2:09:12] and become incarnate.
[2:09:16] And even when G Judas accepted the money
[2:09:19] and betrayed Jesus, remember what Judas
[2:09:22] done? He went to the money changers and
[2:09:24] he threw that money. And he said, "I
[2:09:27] have betrayed innocent blood." Think of
[2:09:31] that. I thought, "Oh,
[2:09:34] God, how this world don't even know what
[2:09:36] they're
[2:09:38] doing. How they're yielding over to
[2:09:41] spirits that they don't even know what
[2:09:44] they're doing." Remember, Brother
[2:09:45] Brandham gave the warning about children
[2:09:48] and and comics. He said, "You let your
[2:09:52] children read them comics." He said it's
[2:09:54] preparing their little minds for a blast
[2:09:58] that Satan's going to give them. He gave
[2:10:01] the warning and parents never heard it.
[2:10:03] Never gave heed to it.
[2:10:05] Right now we got them in the White
[2:10:08] House. We got them children sitting
[2:10:10] making
[2:10:11] laws. All these things, God have mercy
[2:10:14] if the musicians will come.
[2:10:19] But look, we're living in the season of
[2:10:21] rapture.
[2:10:24] Prophecy, see, had to be fulfilled in
[2:10:26] order to bring on the rapture. Right?
[2:10:28] See, the prophet of Malachi 4 had to
[2:10:30] come restore the word and to restore the
[2:10:32] faith. According to Malachi 4, the son
[2:10:35] of man had to be revealed according to
[2:10:37] Luke 17:30. The voice of the bridegroom
[2:10:40] had to sound. And brother Brandham said
[2:10:42] the the bride the the bridegroom call
[2:10:44] comes from this the message, right?
[2:10:47] According to Matthew 25, the Lord had to
[2:10:50] descend with a shout voice and trump.
[2:10:52] According to 1 Thessalonians 4:16,
[2:10:55] before we could be caught up, the mighty
[2:10:57] angel had to descend with the book in
[2:10:59] his hand and declare that time shall be
[2:11:01] no more. According to Revelations 10:1,
[2:11:03] the seventh angel had to sound and
[2:11:04] revealed the mysteries according to
[2:11:06] Revelations 10:7. The heavenly voice had
[2:11:09] to cry out.
[2:11:11] Come out of her, my people.
[2:11:14] According to Revelations 18, the stone
[2:11:17] cut without hands had to strike the
[2:11:19] image. According to Daniel 2:34, the
[2:11:23] head
[2:11:24] stone that that Zechariah talked about,
[2:11:28] that's the stone Daniel is talking
[2:11:31] about. And he had to come with the
[2:11:33] message of grace. Amen.
[2:11:36] The evening light had to shine according
[2:11:40] to Zechariah
[2:11:42] 14:7. So many scriptures had to be
[2:11:44] fulfilled and they they've been just one
[2:11:47] right after another. one right after
[2:11:49] another being fulfilled right before the
[2:11:51] world's eyes. Why? It's rapture
[2:11:55] time. Prophecy that been laying there
[2:11:58] for years. We've been talking about
[2:12:00] rapture, singing about rapture,
[2:12:02] preaching about rapture, inspired about
[2:12:04] the rapture
[2:12:07] coming. But scripture had we had to
[2:12:10] wait until scripture was fulfilled.
[2:12:14] But oh my, have they been
[2:12:16] [Music]
[2:12:20] fulfilled. We're also living in the
[2:12:22] season of the great tribulation, which
[2:12:24] means that prophecy must be filled
[2:12:25] that'll bring on the
[2:12:27] tribulation. Darkness has covered the
[2:12:29] earth and gross darkness the people
[2:12:31] according to Isaiah 60. The things that
[2:12:35] were committed in Noah's day had to be
[2:12:37] repeated and is being repeated according
[2:12:39] to Luke 17:26.
[2:12:42] The things that were committed, amen,
[2:12:44] uh, by mankind in in in lots
[2:12:48] time was prophesied to be repeated. And
[2:12:52] it is being
[2:12:56] repeated. Men of corrupt minds reprobate
[2:12:59] concerning the faith have risen and are
[2:13:01] resisting the truth as Janice and
[2:13:03] Chambers had done
[2:13:05] according to 2 Timothy 3:8. It had to do
[2:13:08] it.
[2:13:10] It had to
[2:13:11] come. The world council of churches have
[2:13:14] been
[2:13:15] established and is fulfilling.
[2:13:18] Revelations 13. See, prophecy not only
[2:13:21] for the church has been fulfilled, but
[2:13:26] prophecies, if you look and you know the
[2:13:29] season, you know the
[2:13:31] timing according to a message that God
[2:13:33] sent us in this age,
[2:13:35] prophecy, according to the world that
[2:13:38] had to be fulfilled by the world in
[2:13:40] order for tribulation to
[2:13:42] come have been fulfilled.
[2:13:46] And it's only getting worse and worse
[2:13:48] and worse. Can you say
[2:13:51] amen? Every prophecy concerning the last
[2:13:54] days had to be fulfilled in order to
[2:13:56] bring on this
[2:13:57] tribulation. And I say every scripture
[2:14:00] concerning the bride has been fulfilled
[2:14:01] and is made ready for the rapture to
[2:14:04] take place any time. The bride's already
[2:14:07] received her last sign, the sign of the
[2:14:09] Messiah. Abraham was showed that same
[2:14:11] Messiah sign by Melzdc. Jesus which was
[2:14:15] MelkiseDC showed that same sign to to
[2:14:18] the Jew and Samaritan and the Gentiles
[2:14:21] as the prophet has taught us was the
[2:14:22] last people to receive the sign in this
[2:14:25] day and we have received it. How many
[2:14:28] believe that? No question about it.
[2:14:30] We've received it. Brother Bram said
[2:14:33] that's that's the last sign. The seven
[2:14:35] thunders have awakened the
[2:14:38] bride. These events that are happening
[2:14:41] isn't wakening the bride. The seven
[2:14:44] thunders have awakened the bride. The
[2:14:46] fourth message has come which is the
[2:14:48] message of life. And the bride is living
[2:14:51] again. She has that token life. The
[2:14:54] elect is now setting in the presence of
[2:14:57] the sun ripening to full maturity. The
[2:15:00] shock has already pulled
[2:15:04] away. Rapturing faith has come to the
[2:15:07] bride by the message of the hour. It's a
[2:15:10] faith that is pure. a faith that is
[2:15:12] resting only on the word of God. There
[2:15:15] is a bride today on earth that is virgin
[2:15:18] to the word of
[2:15:20] God. She hasn't been manhandled by these
[2:15:24] denominations. Brother Brandham said, "I
[2:15:26] see only one thing left, the coming of
[2:15:27] the Lord Jesus at any time for the the
[2:15:30] rapture for the church." Another place
[2:15:33] he said, "Brother and sister, I don't
[2:15:35] know in my Bible of any other thing God
[2:15:38] promised to do before the rapture of the
[2:15:39] church. I don't know. You're thinking of
[2:15:41] the mark of the beast coming. He says,
[2:15:43] I've told you that they've already got
[2:15:45] it. The next thing left is for the
[2:15:48] rapture of the church. It could come at
[2:15:50] any time and not disrupt scripture. Any
[2:15:53] scripture in the Bible as far as I know
[2:15:55] it. Can you say amen? See why? Because
[2:15:59] all these things that are coming upon
[2:16:00] the earth does not, as far as I know, it
[2:16:03] does not pertain to the bride getting
[2:16:05] ready. This bride's ready to go.
[2:16:08] This bride is standing alone on the word
[2:16:10] of God and that's it. Oh yes, she's
[2:16:12] going through hell. She's going through
[2:16:14] the fire. Her faith has truly been
[2:16:16] dried, but she's standing upon the word
[2:16:18] of God. Letting the world know, letting

[2:30:45] another.
[2:30:48] Uh I think uh the baby Josiah's baby
[2:30:52] sick and so we want to keep them in
[2:30:56] prayer
[2:30:57] uh there the baby and
[2:31:02] um Lord just help her keep sister
[2:31:05] Bethany and the baby sister uh Tony in
[2:31:09] our prayer as well and Lord just uh be

[2:31:17] know it was prayed for for Zion,
[2:31:20] Jonathan
[2:31:21] Martin's daughter.
[2:31:24] [Music]
[2:31:26] Um, but if you could really get a hold
[2:31:28] of God for her, uh, Satan's really
[2:31:31] trying to take her life. And she's in
[2:31:35] the hospital right now. And, uh, several
[2:31:38] times, uh, come very close to leaving
[2:31:43] this earth. And doctors really don't
[2:31:46] know what's going on. They're they're
[2:31:47] really trying to figure things out. But
[2:31:50] I know for Jonathan and for Laura's
[2:31:53] parents and then Caleb, her
[2:31:55] husband, I know they really appreciate
[2:31:58] your prayers. And so just just remember
[2:32:01] her. God will somehow somehow change
[2:32:05] that situation
[2:32:07] around. Uh whatever is going on, uh that
[2:32:11] God will take care of it. I know he's
[2:32:13] able to do that. How many believe that?
[2:32:16] Amen. He's able. So, God bless you and
[2:32:20] um uh brother Schmia, would you want to
[2:32:22] dismiss in prayer?
