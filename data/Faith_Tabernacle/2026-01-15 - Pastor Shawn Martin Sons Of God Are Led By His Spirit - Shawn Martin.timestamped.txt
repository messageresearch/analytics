[25:12] In the distance, I can see the storm
[25:17] clouds coming my way.
[25:21] And I need to find a shelter
[25:26] before it starts to rain.
[25:30] So I turn and run to you, Lord. You're
[25:35] the only place to go.
[25:39] Where unfailing love surrounds me
[25:44] when I need it most.
[25:49] You're my hiding
[25:52] place. Safe in your
[25:56] embrace.
[25:57] I'm protected
[26:00] from the storm that rages.
[26:05] And when the waters
[26:08] rise and I run to hide, Lord, in you I
[26:16] find my hiding place.
[26:22] I'm not asking you to take away my
[26:27] troubles, Lord,
[26:30] for it's through the stormy weather
[26:34] I learn to trust you more.
[26:38] So I thank you for your promise
[26:42] that I have come to know.
[26:46] Your unfailing love surrounds me when I
[26:52] need it most.
[26:56] You're my hideing
[26:59] place, safe in your
[27:02] embrace.

[27:07] from the storm that rages.

[27:15] rise and I run to hide, Lord, in you I
[27:23] find my hiding place.

[27:30] place. Safe in your

[35:17] glad that we could come to church and
[35:19] worship the Lord. Hold the fork down.
[35:22] Amen. Amen. Um the musicians can be
[35:27] dismissed. We'll turn to the book of
[35:29] John, the 10th chapter
[35:33] and the 24th verse.
[35:36] Amen. I hear it's supposed to get pretty
[35:38] cold tonight and tomorrow and but uh
[35:42] doesn't look like any snow in the
[35:44] forecast,
[35:46] but uh so sorry for the snowbirds and u
[35:51] maybe next time.
[35:54] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[35:57] Um, but before we go into the word,
[36:00] let's just bow our hearts and talk to
[36:03] the Lord. Amen. Lord Jesus,
[36:07] how we're thankful that you've saved our
[36:10] soul
[36:12] that you filled us with the Holy Ghost,
[36:14] Lord, and you've
[36:17] now bringing us into that adoption of
[36:20] sons. And Lord, we're got a bright
[36:25] future looking for the translation of
[36:28] our bodies. And God, it's uh no room, no
[36:34] room to be down. And Lord, in unbelief
[36:38] and hanging our heads down, but Father,
[36:42] we are to look up and lift our head for
[36:45] our redemption drawth nigh.
[36:48] And Father, as we're doing so tonight, I
[36:51] pray that you would just minister your
[36:53] word to us, Father, as you alone know
[36:58] the the meaning. You have the
[37:02] revelation, Lord, of it. And Father, we
[37:05] certainly need it tonight, Father. And I
[37:08] just pray your spirit would move among
[37:10] us now and help me to yield myself to
[37:13] you. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[37:17] Amen. And amen.
[37:20] Praise the Lord. So we look at St. John
[37:25] uh the 10th chapter
[37:27] and um going to start at the 24th verse.
[37:33] Then came the Jews round about him and
[37:36] said unto him, "How long dust thou make
[37:39] us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell
[37:43] us plainly."
[37:45] Jesus answered them, "I told you and you
[37:48] believe not. The works that I do in my
[37:51] father's name, they bear witness of me.
[37:54] But you believe not because you are not
[37:58] of my sheep as I said unto you. My sheep
[38:02] hear my voice and I know them and they
[38:05] follow me and I give unto them eternal
[38:07] life and they shall never perish.
[38:11] Neither shall any man pluck them out of
[38:14] my hand. Aren't you glad for that?
[38:17] &gt;&gt; My father which gave them me is greater
[38:20] than all and no man is able to pluck
[38:23] them out of my father's hand. I and my
[38:26] father are one. Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Then if you'll turn to uh Romans the 8th
[38:33] chapter, 14th verse,
[38:36] very familiar passage of scripture.
[38:42] Romans 8:14. For as many as are led by
[38:46] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[38:49] God. Amen. And for you have not received
[38:52] the spirit of bondage again to fear, but
[38:54] you have received the spirit of
[38:56] adoption, whereby we cry, abba, father.
[38:59] The spirit itself beareth witness with
[39:02] our spirit that we are the children of
[39:05] God. Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats this evening.
[39:11] And u
[39:13] my title would be sons of God are led by
[39:16] his spirit.
[39:18] And uh we see that um Jesus is talking
[39:23] to his critics cuz they they could not
[39:26] believe
[39:28] uh who he was even though he told them,
[39:31] even though he showed them. Uh but he
[39:36] said the reason why they they couldn't
[39:39] believe is simply because they were not
[39:42] his own.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; They did not come from him. So no matter
[39:46] how clear he made it, no matter what
[39:50] depths he manifested the father,
[39:54] &gt;&gt; uh there was nothing that would get them
[39:57] to believe it. And so uh he wasn't sent
[40:01] to try to convince people uh to believe.
[40:05] He he knew that there would be those
[40:08] that who who would believe and those who
[40:12] wouldn't believe. And he knew that those
[40:15] who wouldn't believe wouldn't be his.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And those that would believe would be
[40:21] his. And so he come to seek his own.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; He come to save his own.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; And so from what we've read there that
[40:30] that we as sons, how many believes
[40:33] you're a son and daughter of God?
[40:36] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. I I think that
[40:38] takes faith and we we must be confident
[40:41] in that. And we we don't we don't regard
[40:45] our feelings or uh anything of this
[40:48] flesh. We just there's something that
[40:51] bears witness that we are sons and
[40:53] daughters of God.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; And if we are sons and daughters of God,
[40:57] then we are to be led by the spirit of
[41:02] God. And being led of the spirit of God
[41:05] is a quality that only sons and
[41:08] daughters of God have. Um um you know we
[41:13] we just have that and it's a it's a
[41:16] sobering thought and yet it's a blessful
[41:19] thought
[41:20] &gt;&gt; because we are able to do things that a
[41:24] the average person cannot do.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; We are able to avoid things
[41:31] &gt;&gt; uh that the average person cannot avoid.
[41:34] We are we are able to come in contact
[41:39] with another world that no just your
[41:43] average person can't can't do.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; We are able to see things and to know
[41:50] things that the average person cannot
[41:53] see and know and that's because we are
[41:56] led by the spirit of God.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. Uh there is so much
[42:01] mockery around Christianity that it just
[42:03] really just it just turns my stomach
[42:06] when I see it and I hear it. Uh and
[42:10] there is so much impersonation of
[42:12] Christianity.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; But I I will say this that no man can be
[42:17] a Christian and I'm talking about a true
[42:20] Christian without the spirit of God
[42:22] dwelling in him or her. And and you know
[42:28] uh the only way that Christianity can be
[42:32] lived is by the spirit of God. Uh God
[42:36] would show this in several instances in
[42:38] the Bible. And and it may be just
[42:41] natural things, but it's it's it's to
[42:44] show us that it that that uh uh uh more
[42:48] of a supernatural thing. But look look
[42:51] at a man like Samson. Uh you hear of him
[42:56] taking the gates off of a city that it
[42:59] wasn't just a normal door. It was it was
[43:03] gates that weighed tons and yet he took
[43:07] them off and and and carried them up the
[43:10] hill and and uh now the world's carnal
[43:15] mind of this is they view Samson as some
[43:19] muscular man uh that just very strong.
[43:24] But the prophet would tell us that he
[43:26] was he was he was just a skinny kid,
[43:28] skinny boy, mama's boy, just a little
[43:31] shrimp, I think he would call him. Uh uh
[43:35] just just a a a peeon of a of a guy. And
[43:39] yet, but he done it by the spirit of
[43:42] God, right?
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and how could the Hebrew boys
[43:47] come out of the fiery furnace without
[43:49] even having the smell of smoke uh uh uh
[43:53] upon their clothes and and things? How
[43:55] how could an axe head swim uh in the Old
[43:58] Testament as the Bible talks of uh
[44:02] there? How how could a man uh stand
[44:05] there and call fire out of heaven? Amen.
[44:09] and and and then a man uh uh look up at
[44:13] the sun and speak to it and command it
[44:16] to stand still and it stood still. How
[44:19] how can these things happen? How can a
[44:22] man foretell of uh or maybe tell someone
[44:26] of their past and then able to discern
[44:29] what is happening in the present and and
[44:32] fortell of future events and it be
[44:35] perfect to the dot. See, it took the
[44:38] spirit of God to do all of these things.
[44:42] Uh what what would cause Abel to uh uh
[44:47] offer a sacrifice that would be pleasing
[44:49] to God? Well, he couldn't do that on his
[44:52] own, but he done it by revelation. The
[44:56] the spirit of God moved upon him. And
[44:59] and so what what it would tell us is
[45:02] that uh uh it it takes the spirit of
[45:05] God. It's not a natural thing what makes
[45:09] uh you know the sons of God worship and
[45:12] lift their hands un unto the Lord and it
[45:15] it's the spirit of God. Something moves
[45:18] upon them. Amen. And uh uh uh and and
[45:23] and they act accordingly according to
[45:26] what the spirit is is is telling them or
[45:30] whatever. How will the bride Amen. Have
[45:33] you ever just thought, "How will this
[45:35] bride overcome in this day, this evil
[45:39] day, the most deceptive day, and yet
[45:42] they're going to overcome?" It's it's a
[45:45] paradox. It's something that cannot be
[45:48] explained. It's something that the the
[45:50] carnal man looks at it and says, "Well,
[45:52] I can do that, too." But it's something
[45:55] that cannot be copied because it's the
[45:58] spirit of God that is actually doing it.
[46:02] Zechariah 4 and6 it says this is the
[46:04] word of the Lord unto Zerubabel saying
[46:07] not by might nor by power but by my
[46:10] spirit everybody say by my spirit saith
[46:13] the Lord of hosts. Amen. Amen. So so
[46:17] it's not by might not nor by power.
[46:19] Amen. But by my spirit. You know people
[46:22] misjudge the sons of God and and and by
[46:26] thinking that they're doing things on
[46:28] their own power. uh uh but but it's not
[46:32] it's it that that's far from the truth
[46:35] naturally. You know, we can think for
[46:37] ourselves. You know, a person uh can
[46:41] sing. If he has the ability to sing, he
[46:43] can sing. If a person has the ability to
[46:46] preach and and put things together,
[46:49] well, he he can preach. A person that
[46:52] can play music, if they have that
[46:54] ability, that talent, amen, to play to
[46:56] play music. And he can they can do that
[46:59] with the natural ability or or whatever
[47:02] they've been uh they they have that they
[47:05] can do they can do that with the natural
[47:07] ability uh uh and and but but how many
[47:11] people do it by by without being led of
[47:16] the spirit of God? Amen. Uh you know it
[47:20] it's it's one thing to to be able to do
[47:23] it. It's one thing for a man to preach.
[47:25] It's it's one thing for a man to uh to
[47:28] sing or or whatever, but it's another
[47:32] thing to do it under this by the spirit
[47:34] of God. Amen. See, it's and and that's
[47:38] the key is is the spirit of God. Can you
[47:41] say amen?
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Uh since the beginning of time, man has
[47:45] has wanted to lead himself. But God God
[47:50] ordained that that he would lead man.
[47:53] God wants to lead man.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Uh and so he designed man for that that
[47:59] reason. He uh to where he could lead
[48:02] man. And you know the b uh the prophet
[48:05] says that God made himself a little
[48:08] control tower in the heart of man so
[48:12] that man would be led by his spirit.
[48:14] Ain't that right? See, and so when man
[48:18] uh uh decided to lead himself, the
[48:21] prophet said, "Now that's what separated
[48:24] him from God." You know, if if and I I
[48:28] pray I can take what words we have to
[48:31] say and and really God just use that to
[48:34] help us. But uh uh we don't want to be
[48:37] separated from God. We we don't want the
[48:40] name Christianity
[48:42] and and yet not have that connection
[48:46] with his God's spirit be because we're
[48:49] nothing without the spirit of God. Even
[48:52] even Jesus said without me you can do
[48:55] nothing. Ain't that right? You you can
[48:57] do nothing. And so we we find that uh uh
[49:02] uh an unconverted man, take take that,
[49:05] an unconverted man, all he does is he he
[49:09] walks after the flesh
[49:11] &gt;&gt; and and maybe he he does things after
[49:15] the flesh and he looks at at at the the
[49:18] believer and he says, "Well, I can do
[49:20] just that." So he comes to church with
[49:22] his Bible. He he dresses and she dresses
[49:26] just like like uh uh someone, you know,
[49:29] uh like the believer and and maybe even
[49:32] go as far as not to cut their hair, the
[49:34] woman. And and maybe to say, "Well, I I
[49:38] can wear a dress just like the the rest
[49:40] of them, so she wears the dress." And
[49:42] and and someone the man says, "Well, I
[49:45] can preach just like they do." So So he
[49:48] he says, "Well, I I'm just going to be a
[49:50] preacher." And so he can put notes
[49:52] together and he can do these things and
[49:55] all of that. But you you see uh uh uh
[49:59] what a man does in the flesh. Amen. Is
[50:03] is and what a man does in the spirit is
[50:06] two different things. C can you say
[50:09] amen? Uh uh see and and so uh uh what
[50:15] we're not to walk after the flesh now
[50:18] and and like I say I I pray that it it
[50:21] will help us because a man walking in
[50:24] the spirit and a man uh walking after
[50:26] the flesh produces two different
[50:28] results. Can can you say amen? Amen.
[50:32] See, and and so we we look Romans 8
[50:35] and5. It says, "For they that are after
[50:38] the flesh do mind the things of the
[50:41] flesh,
[50:42] &gt;&gt; but they that are after the spirit, the
[50:44] things of the spirit, for to be carnally
[50:47] minded is death, but to be spiritually
[50:50] minded is life and peace." Ain't that
[50:53] right? So because the carnal mind is
[50:57] immity against God, for it is not
[51:01] subject uh to the law of God, neither
[51:05] indeed can be. So they in then they that
[51:09] are in the flesh cannot please God. Now
[51:12] I want you to understand that now. The
[51:14] carnal mind walks after the flesh. The
[51:17] carnal mind sees no need for the spirit
[51:20] of God. Whereas those that are walking
[51:23] in the spirit, the sons of God, they
[51:26] realize that if they're walking in the
[51:29] flesh, then then they're nothing. It it
[51:32] would take the spirit of God to come.
[51:35] Amen. I think it takes the spirit of God
[51:38] in our singing. I think we need the
[51:40] spirit of God in the preaching. I think
[51:43] we need the spirit of God. Amen. In in
[51:46] in in the music. I I think we need THE
[51:49] SPIRIT OF GOD IN OUR TESTIFYING. I I
[51:52] think we need THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN OUR
[51:54] AMENS. I think we need the spirit of God
[51:57] in our worship. Can you say amen?
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, now all of these things can
[52:03] be done after the flesh, but it would
[52:06] take the spirit of God. Amen. Uh uh that
[52:10] that we need. Now, brother Brandham says
[52:12] it's a dangerous thing when we go to
[52:15] think that many times Christians who are
[52:18] filled with the spirit of God or Holy
[52:21] Spirit will still walk after the flesh.
[52:24] Oh, did you know that they'll do it and
[52:27] then the Holy Spirit gets away from
[52:30] them?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[52:34] &gt;&gt; See, and so so we we don't want to walk
[52:37] after the flesh.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, you know, I think it was Paul
[52:42] that said, "How is that? You began in
[52:44] the spirit and then now you're being
[52:47] made perfect after the flesh, relying on
[52:49] the flesh, works of the flesh, the
[52:52] abilities of the flesh, talents of the
[52:55] flesh." Can you say, "Amen." What the
[52:57] flesh can do. Amen. You started out
[52:59] needing God. You started out depending
[53:02] upon God. You started out looking for
[53:04] his spirit. Amen. But somehow
[53:07] something's changed and you're looking
[53:09] after the flesh now. Depending upon the
[53:11] flesh, relying on the flesh, looking
[53:13] after the flesh. Ain't that right? And
[53:16] and the moment that we get in uh uh away
[53:19] from the spirit. Amen. And and walking
[53:22] after the flesh, well, the the prophet
[53:25] says the Holy Spirit gets away from from
[53:27] them. He said, "See, you see people
[53:30] sometimes someone will raise up and
[53:32] speak in tongues which will be God and
[53:36] maybe someone says, "Well, glory to God.
[53:39] I can do that, too." Well, see, that's
[53:41] flesh. He said, "You have to be led by
[53:46] the spirit."
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. You have to be
[53:50] led by the spirit. Amen. Anything that
[53:54] we do, we don't want to just do it. We
[53:56] don't want to just be a preacher. We
[53:58] want to be anointed preachers. We don't
[54:00] want to just be musicians. We want to be
[54:03] anointed musicians. We don't want to
[54:05] just be deacons. We want to be anointed
[54:07] deacons. WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT TO BE
[54:09] JUST PARENTS. We want to be anointed
[54:12] parents. You You understand what I'm
[54:14] saying? AMEN. PEOPLE THAT are led by the
[54:18] spirit of God. Amen. There are there are
[54:21] a lot of parents that that are out there
[54:24] that are parenting children that DON'T
[54:27] EVEN KNOW GOD, DON'T EVEN CLAIM TO KNOW
[54:30] GOD. THEN THERE'S SOME THAT ARE just
[54:32] going to church and they're caught in
[54:34] religious things and and and they go for
[54:37] through the form of formality and
[54:40] rituals and and all that. But then there
[54:43] are parents that are led by THE SPIRIT
[54:47] OF GOD. CAN YOU say amen? Well, if you
[54:50] you'll see that there is a difference uh
[54:54] between the two.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; So, so you have to be led when when when
[54:58] people look at and say, well, you know,
[55:00] I I see this, so I can do that. I I can
[55:03] do that. You know, that's that's no
[55:05] problem. It it reminds me of of the sons
[55:08] ofKeva uh for example um where you know
[55:13] they they saw Paul casting out devils
[55:15] and and um and they thought well we can
[55:19] do that too and and so um uh they go to
[55:23] this demon-possessed man and says you
[55:25] know uh in the name of Paul Jesus who
[55:28] Paul preaches amen we rebuke you we
[55:31] command you to get out you know well
[55:33] that that demon looked at him says,
[55:36] "Well, now Paul I know and Jesus I know,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; but who in the world are you?"
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And and the Bible says that they made
[55:44] that devil mad. Amen. And and that demon
[55:48] whooped up on them guys and sent them
[55:51] down the street without clothes. Amen.
[55:54] See? Well, see, so what it was is they
[55:58] were doing something that Paul was doing
[56:00] in the spirit. They were doing it in the
[56:02] flesh. See, and they didn't see the
[56:05] difference between the two. They just
[56:08] thought, "Well, Paul's done it and he's
[56:09] doing a pretty good job, so let's go.
[56:11] Let's start us a ministry." Well, but
[56:13] but the the difference was was was Paul
[56:16] was led by the spirit to do it. And and
[56:19] these men, amen, were clueless about the
[56:22] spirit of God. So, so we find, brother
[56:26] Brandon puts it like this. A man or
[56:28] woman that tries to walk after the
[56:30] things of the world can never please
[56:33] God.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, we got a lot of
[56:38] of of man's achievement. We're living in
[56:40] the day of man's achievements. Uh and
[56:44] and man, we've got quite a bit
[56:46] achievements of man and they just keep
[56:49] getting they're growing and getting
[56:51] smarter and and producing quite
[56:54] inventions. It's it's an amazing thing.
[56:57] I mean, they've got, you know, uh, uh,
[57:00] robots now, you know, and and, uh, and
[57:03] that's only just getting they're just
[57:05] getting started with what they're, you
[57:07] know, if the Lord would terry uh, uh,
[57:10] you know, you you hear, uh, I heard Elon
[57:13] Musk the other day and he was given a
[57:16] uh, speaking at a conference and the
[57:18] things that he was talking about blow
[57:19] your mind of what things that he's
[57:22] they've tapped into and what they're
[57:24] they're coming to in the human mind and
[57:27] how that they can read thoughts and and
[57:29] and by your thoughts you'll be able to
[57:31] control things and uh he it was an
[57:35] incredible thing and uh but but see it's
[57:38] after the flesh and and their
[57:41] achievements are done at in the in in
[57:43] the and I'm afraid that the achievements
[57:45] of man has entered into the church to
[57:48] where we're looking at at the at the the
[57:53] depending upon our own the flesh and I'm
[57:56] just talking about the church world uh
[57:59] for an example. Amen. And and you know
[58:03] it's it's incredible. And to where
[58:06] everybody thinks, well, that's the way
[58:08] to go. If you want a good business, if
[58:10] you want a good uh thing going, start a
[58:13] church. get people in, you know, and and
[58:16] you got businessmen running or great
[58:18] organizations as a church, you know, and
[58:21] and they're able to do this and they're
[58:23] able to do that and and no difference
[58:25] than a man that's got, you know, uh uh a
[58:29] thousand employees uh under him and he's
[58:32] doing a business with tech and and
[58:34] whatever he does. Amen. Get that same
[58:36] guy and put him behind the pullpit.
[58:39] Amen. He can he can start a church and
[58:41] he can he can he can go all kinds of
[58:44] things with it. They putting coffee
[58:46] shops in the church and they're doing
[58:48] this in the church and they're doing
[58:49] this in the church and it it's a great
[58:52] organization and it's it's an appeal uh
[58:55] to the church and they're bringing in
[58:57] millions of dollars with it and and all
[59:00] of that. it it's it's it's set aside the
[59:03] spirit of God and and now you find
[59:06] people walking after the flesh. Amen.
[59:09] And it's it's actually an impersonation
[59:12] so to speak of the real spiritual
[59:15] church. Can you say amen?
[59:17] &gt;&gt; So we we find amen that first Timothy 1
[59:21] and12 uh Paul says, "And I thank Christ
[59:24] Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me."
[59:28] Somebody say, "He's enabled me." See,
[59:31] who hath enabled me? See, so so it
[59:34] wasn't a a certain church or a certain
[59:37] ministry. It wasn't uh a college or
[59:41] seminary or or whatever. He's he's
[59:44] putting that I got my start because
[59:47] Christ, the spirit of God, hath enabled
[59:50] me. And for that he counted me faithful
[59:55] putting me into the ministry.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; So so we find this word to enable
[1:00:03] according to Webster is to make able to
[1:00:07] supply with power physical or moral to
[1:00:10] furnish with sufficient power or
[1:00:13] ability. see to furnish with legal
[1:00:17] ability or competence to uh authorize
[1:00:21] see to furnish with competent knowledge
[1:00:24] or skill and in general with adequate
[1:00:28] means. So when Paul is saying he's
[1:00:30] enabled me, he he's he's saying I'm not
[1:00:33] going by my smarts. I'm not going by
[1:00:36] what I've learned through Hebrew law and
[1:00:39] and and uh all of these things. He said
[1:00:42] under the greatest uh teacher of that
[1:00:45] day, Gale, I believe it was. And and and
[1:00:48] yet he SAYS, "BUT IT WASN'T THAT THAT
[1:00:50] put me in the ministry. IT WAS GOD THAT
[1:00:53] put me in the ministry. He's enabled me.
[1:00:58] Therefore, he that hath anointed us," he
[1:01:00] says in another place, is God. A ain't
[1:01:03] that right? See, so then a ministry uh
[1:01:07] should not be operated by the flesh.
[1:01:11] Amen. Nothing a gift should not be
[1:01:13] operated by by the flesh. Can you say
[1:01:16] amen? Amen. Uh it would take God to
[1:01:20] enable us. And and we want to realize
[1:01:23] that uh it takes God to enable us. If if
[1:01:28] God has put a call upon your life, then
[1:01:31] it would take God to open the doors. It
[1:01:34] takes God to anoint. It takes God to to
[1:01:38] to to uh uh bring an enlightenment.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If if whatever it is,
[1:01:47] it's God. It's God gives you the
[1:01:50] ability. It's God that gives you the
[1:01:53] strength. It's God. It's all the spirit
[1:01:55] of God.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:01:59] Isaiah 40 28, I believe, it says, "Hast
[1:02:03] thou not known? Hast thou not heard that
[1:02:06] the everlasting God, the Lord, the
[1:02:08] creator of the ends of the earth,
[1:02:10] faintth not? Neither is weary.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; He's not weary. There is no searching of
[1:02:16] his understanding. He giveth, notice,
[1:02:20] he, everybody say, he he giveth power to
[1:02:24] the faint.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And to them that have no might, he
[1:02:27] increasth strength. Even the youth shall
[1:02:31] faint and be weary, and the young men
[1:02:34] shall utterly fail. But they, everybody
[1:02:36] say, they,
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:02:42] their strength.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Now, this is scripture. They that wait
[1:02:49] upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:02:51] strength. THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS
[1:02:54] as eagles IN A TIME WHERE EVERYBODY'S
[1:02:58] failing and uh they're getting weary and
[1:03:01] they're they're faltering. Amen. THERE
[1:03:04] IS A PEOPLE THAT'S just waiting UPON THE
[1:03:07] LORD.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; FOR THEY HAVE THE PROMISE NOT BY MIGHT
[1:03:11] nor by power but by my spirit.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; See, THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS as
[1:03:18] eagles. They shall run and not be weary.
[1:03:21] They shall walk and not faint.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; See, so sons of God are enabled to do
[1:03:28] what they do.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; They are enabled to withstand the enemy.
[1:03:34] They are enabled to overcome.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the spirit of God that in
[1:03:41] equipss them and makes them uh
[1:03:44] sufficient. Amen. uh uh ready, able to
[1:03:50] withstand the the things that they go
[1:03:52] through. It's the spirit of God.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; See, so now sons of God are enabled to
[1:04:00] see things that the carnal mind cannot
[1:04:04] see.
[1:04:05] And and
[1:04:08] this what sets us apart in my thoughts.
[1:04:11] Amen. Is being led by the spirit of God.
[1:04:15] I my battery might be low, so I'm going
[1:04:17] to go uh to this Judah.
[1:04:21] Uh so we see
[1:04:24] Amen. Uh you have to put it in my ear
[1:04:26] monitors.
[1:04:28] Uh 1 Corinthians 2:9,
[1:04:31] but as it is written,
[1:04:35] praise the Lord. Lord,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; as it is written, I hath not seen nor
[1:04:41] ear heard. There it is. Neither hath
[1:04:44] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:04:47] which God hath prepared for them that
[1:04:50] love him.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; See, say that again. Eye hath not seen
[1:04:55] and cannot see. Ear hath not heard and
[1:04:58] cannot hear. See, neither has it entered
[1:05:01] into the heart of man and cannot enter
[1:05:04] into the heart of man. Those things that
[1:05:06] God hath prepared for them that love
[1:05:09] him. But God, everybody say, "But God
[1:05:12] hath revealed them unto us by his
[1:05:15] spirit." See, it's been revelation all
[1:05:18] the way down through through the ages.
[1:05:20] It It's been a revelation, a a a a a an
[1:05:24] eyeopening. Amen. The spirit of God
[1:05:27] revealing. Amen. So God hath revealed
[1:05:30] them unto us by his spirit. For the
[1:05:33] spirit searchth all things, yay, the
[1:05:36] deep things of God. Now the deep things
[1:05:39] they're they're not things that uh uh
[1:05:43] only a smart intelligent person can can
[1:05:46] comprehend. Amen. But they are things
[1:05:50] that are hidden.
[1:05:52] They are things that a a carnal smart
[1:05:56] genius could never understand.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; But these deep things are things that
[1:06:02] are hidden and cannot be seen EXCEPT GOD
[1:06:06] REVEALS THEM.
[1:06:08] These deep things are mysteries unto the
[1:06:11] world. Ain't that right?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; But it says now, for what man knoweth
[1:06:16] the things of a man, save the spirit of
[1:06:18] a man which is in him? Even so the
[1:06:20] things of God knoweth no man, but the
[1:06:22] spirit of God. Now we have received not
[1:06:26] the spirit of the world, but the spirit
[1:06:29] which is of God. Who's we? The sons and
[1:06:31] daughters of God. We have received the
[1:06:35] spirit of God which uh that we might
[1:06:38] know the things the deep things that are
[1:06:41] freely given to us of God. So it takes
[1:06:45] the spirit of God to reveal them. It's
[1:06:48] not given to the intellect. It's not so
[1:06:53] that man can we're we're not walking
[1:06:56] after the flesh understanding these
[1:06:58] mysteries.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're we're sons of
[1:07:02] God that are led by the spirit of God.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; So it takes the spirit of God to reveal
[1:07:09] the things that are given of God. So I
[1:07:13] if if a person has received the Holy
[1:07:16] Spirit, it's it's because there the deep
[1:07:19] things there's deep things that God has
[1:07:23] given him or her AND GOD WANTS TO SHOW
[1:07:27] THEM TO her to him. Can you say amen?
[1:07:30] That's right. That the the Holy Spirit
[1:07:33] isn't there just to tickle our fancy and
[1:07:35] to get us to shouting and excited. I I
[1:07:38] believe the spirit of God moves in that
[1:07:40] way, but that's not ex that's not the
[1:07:43] purpose. Amen. God wants to show us
[1:07:46] things and and reveal things. You know,
[1:07:49] it's that's why the prophet said, "You
[1:07:51] don't read this Bible," Amen. like a
[1:07:53] newspaper. Amen. You don't read it like
[1:07:56] a book, a a fantasy book or a uh mystery
[1:08:01] book or or whatever. You you don't read
[1:08:03] it like that. Amen. It takes the spirit
[1:08:06] of God, amen, to move upon us to
[1:08:10] understand this Bible.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; See, led by the spirit of God. Now
[1:08:16] Deuteronomy 29:29 and the secret things
[1:08:20] belongs unto the Lord our God. But those
[1:08:24] things that he hath revealed belongs
[1:08:26] unto us and to our CHILDREN FOREVER. HOW
[1:08:29] MANY WANTS GOD to reveal it to you?
[1:08:32] Well, I do. I I I DON'T WANT TO SIT
[1:08:34] WITHOUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD. I I DON'T
[1:08:36] WANT TO BE A MAN THAT LIVES MY LIFE
[1:08:38] WITHOUT THE leading of God. I want God
[1:08:42] when I read this Bible. AMEN. I WANT GOD
[1:08:45] WHEN I hear the message and I I WANT GOD
[1:08:47] to lead me.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Those things that are found in the word
[1:08:54] that that that's the things that are
[1:08:57] secret things. That's the deep things.
[1:08:59] They're found in the word of God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And according to what Jesus said in John
[1:09:05] 16:13, it is the spirit of truth.
[1:09:08] Everybody say, "It's the spirit of truth
[1:09:10] that is to lead us and guide us into all
[1:09:14] truth." All truth. Ain't that right? And
[1:09:17] and and and of course you we understand
[1:09:20] that the word Amen. Uh uh comes to a
[1:09:24] prophet, a vindicated prophet. Ain't
[1:09:26] that right? Amen. The prophet said, "A
[1:09:28] true prophet is a divine interpreter of
[1:09:32] the word of God." That's that's what a
[1:09:35] prophet is. But notice the true prophet
[1:09:38] is the Holy Spirit himself.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believes that? That's
[1:09:44] what the prophet of God said that that.
[1:09:46] So he's trying to tell us that that a
[1:09:49] man that we would call a prophet, he's
[1:09:51] not the one that's sitting there, a man
[1:09:53] opening up the word to us and divining
[1:09:56] the word, interpreting the word. The
[1:09:58] Holy Spirit is the prophet.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Not walking after the flesh. God wanted
[1:10:05] us to understand that it wasn't after
[1:10:06] the flesh.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; That's why he didn't bring an
[1:10:09] intellectual man and raise him up to be
[1:10:11] a prophet.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; He called a a hillbilly Kentucky and uh
[1:10:15] seventh grade education that couldn't
[1:10:17] talk. Right.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; And so the true prophet is the Holy
[1:10:25] Spirit. And he's the one, the prophet
[1:10:27] said, that has the true vision and is
[1:10:30] leading the church. The Holy Spirit was
[1:10:32] the prophet of Moses hour. The Holy
[1:10:34] Spirit was the prophet of Meaya's hour.
[1:10:37] The Holy Spirit is the prophet of this
[1:10:39] hour.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; But then we see that God had has for
[1:10:45] ordained certain men. Amen. Throughout
[1:10:48] time to bring forth the word uh to the
[1:10:52] people and that he would speak through
[1:10:54] these men, amen, and bring forth the
[1:10:58] word through them. Now, we call these
[1:11:00] men prophets. Amen. Ain't that right? A
[1:11:03] prophet. See, but a man cannot be a
[1:11:06] prophet without the word of the Lord
[1:11:09] coming to him. Amen. Without the spirit
[1:11:12] of God, God anoints these men. Amen.
[1:11:16] EVERY PROPHET THAT GOD HAS SENT WAS
[1:11:18] ANOINTED by the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:11:21] That they would utter things THAT THAT
[1:11:23] THEY THEMSELVES couldn't even
[1:11:25] understand.
[1:11:26] THEY THEMSELVES,
[1:11:28] AMEN, would never have spoken it,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; but it was the spirit of God.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; They were led by the spirit of God to
[1:11:36] speak those things.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I believe that's
[1:11:40] exactly what our prophet was in this
[1:11:42] day. God anointed that man. And that man
[1:11:46] was so led by the spirit of God that he
[1:11:49] could utter things and believe things
[1:11:51] and and and speak things that would be a
[1:11:54] paradox and hard to understand to the
[1:11:57] carnal mind.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; See, these men are anointed with with
[1:12:03] what brother Brandon would call a
[1:12:05] prophetic spirit. That's what the spirit
[1:12:07] of God is. It's he's a prophetic spirit.
[1:12:10] Amen. And so when a prophet comes to the
[1:12:14] earth, it means that God is wanting to
[1:12:16] speak to his people and and to lead them
[1:12:21] in in a higher path.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet now is so in tune
[1:12:26] with God and yielded to the spirit of
[1:12:28] God that brother Brandham says that that
[1:12:30] a prophet never stands to be judged by
[1:12:34] any man.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; No, no man stands he stands before no
[1:12:38] man to be judged.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know we got a lot of judges on
[1:12:42] this earth today. Amen. That's trying to
[1:12:44] judge the message. But a prophet never
[1:12:47] stands before man and is judged.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; It's man that stands before a prophet
[1:12:53] because the word of God comes to a
[1:12:55] prophet
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; to judge man.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said there are spirits
[1:13:01] that's in the church. That's true. Such
[1:13:04] as gifts of prophecy, healing, and so
[1:13:06] forth. But they're in the entire body.
[1:13:08] They may fall upon one person tonight, a
[1:13:11] prophecy, and it might never fall upon
[1:13:13] that person again. It might be
[1:13:15] somewhere's else in the body. And those
[1:13:17] spirits are supposed to be judged. Let
[1:13:20] one speak and two or three judge. See,
[1:13:23] said Paul. Now, those are spirits of the
[1:13:26] gifts that's in the church. But the only
[1:13:28] person that has a right to thus sayith
[1:13:32] the Lord is a vindicated prophet. And
[1:13:34] you never seen anybody judging Isaiah or
[1:13:37] Jeremiah or those people. They were
[1:13:40] prophets for ordained and born in the
[1:13:42] world to be prophets. They foraw the
[1:13:45] thing by vision and THEN SAID, "THUS
[1:13:47] SAYITH the Lord, for the Lord had
[1:13:49] already said it."
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and a prophet
[1:13:53] always comes right at the time of
[1:13:56] junction. Amen. And a junction always
[1:14:00] comes at the end of the road. The
[1:14:03] prophet said,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; he says, "Every time the people are
[1:14:06] gathered together at the end of the road
[1:14:09] at a junction, God sends a true prophet
[1:14:12] and the devil sends a false prophet."
[1:14:14] Ain't that right? Well, I know you know
[1:14:16] these things, but just to reiterate it,
[1:14:18] there's only one prophet that God
[1:14:20] promised to send in this last day, and
[1:14:22] that's the prophet of Malachi 4. Amen.
[1:14:25] At the end of the gentile dispensation.
[1:14:27] Do you believe that? He is the the the
[1:14:30] last messenger of the the to the church
[1:14:33] age that John saw the seventh angel
[1:14:36] messenger. Amen. And when he shall begin
[1:14:39] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:14:41] finished. How many believes that? So
[1:14:43] we're not waiting for a prophet. Amen.
[1:14:45] God sent a prophet. Not looking to
[1:14:47] another prophet. God syndicate
[1:14:49] vindicated a prophet of of brother
[1:14:51] Brandham and vindicated his ministry.
[1:14:54] for he was the seventh angel and he was
[1:14:56] the prophet of Malachi 4 and no other
[1:14:59] ministry will ever fit that description.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of truth through that
[1:15:08] ministry has opened the word of God to
[1:15:12] us.
[1:15:13] Not just part of the word but all of the
[1:15:15] word.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] But I will tell you this that a person
[1:15:22] will not understand the message without
[1:15:24] having the spirit of truth within them.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You'll not understand this message.
[1:15:32] You'll not understand the word just by
[1:15:34] your association with the message.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Every person has to have the Holy Spirit
[1:15:41] for themselves.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Because each of us are individuals.
[1:15:46] Ain't that right? And the Bible says the
[1:15:48] spirit of the prophet, which is the Holy
[1:15:51] Spirit, is subject to the prophet.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; So you don't receive a different baptism
[1:15:57] of spirit than what brother Brandham
[1:15:59] had.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? The same Holy Spirit
[1:16:03] that he had. Amen. Is the same Holy
[1:16:06] Spirit you received. The same Holy
[1:16:08] Spirit that that that gave the word and
[1:16:11] revelation to brother Brandham of this
[1:16:13] Bible is the same spirit that you
[1:16:16] receive that will MAKE YOU COME SUBJECT
[1:16:19] TO THE WORD that he himself brought
[1:16:21] through that prophet.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Now, so the Holy Spirit will not show us
[1:16:29] things that that the prophet that he did
[1:16:34] not show the prophet.
[1:16:36] I'm just that's just my beliefs.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; There are many people who get their own
[1:16:41] revelation
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; of things
[1:16:44] and they go out on what they brother
[1:16:46] Brandham called limbs. They go out off
[1:16:48] on limbs.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; They get so far out there they can't
[1:16:52] come back
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; and before you know it they're claiming
[1:16:55] to be in the message and preaching no
[1:16:56] rapture,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; no resurrection,
[1:17:00] no bride age.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hello. saying that we're in the
[1:17:04] millennium,
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; TEACHING TWO SOUL DOCTRINES. That's
[1:17:08] right.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; TEACHING SOME DOCTRINE OF PERUSIA THAT
[1:17:11] IS SO MESSED UP.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; SEE, PREACHING, you know, polygamy.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; And and they'll take portions of the
[1:17:20] word, portions of the message. Amen. And
[1:17:23] and yet IT'S IT'S TOTALLY AGAINST
[1:17:25] EVERYTHING THAT A PROPHET STOOD FOR.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; PROPHET never stood for polygamy.
[1:17:31] PROPHET NEVER TAUGHT two lords.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Prophet didn't preach two souls either.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; See, THE PROPHET DIDN'T PREACH THESE
[1:17:42] THINGS.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; So then IT WOULD REQUIRE US. AMEN. IF
[1:17:47] WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE MESSAGE, WE'VE
[1:17:49] GOT TO HAVE THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPHET
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD COME INTO US AND teach us.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; do you believe it? Yeah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Not lean upon the flesh.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. First Corinth 1
[1:18:04] Corinthians 14:33. God is not the author
[1:18:07] of confusion. 1 Corinthians 1:10. Now I
[1:18:11] beseech you, brethren, by the name of
[1:18:12] our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[1:18:15] speak the same thing, that there be no
[1:18:18] divisions among you, but that ye be
[1:18:21] perfectly joined together in the same
[1:18:23] mind and in the same judgment.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Ain't that right?
[1:18:29] Not one saying, "Well, everything's, you
[1:18:31] know, the message is all right." But,
[1:18:33] you know, he, you know, it's part of
[1:18:35] it's inspired and part of it's not.
[1:18:37] That's the same old devil that's causing
[1:18:39] people for years to say this this Bible
[1:18:42] is part inspired and part not.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:46] It
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; It's just the same thing. If If he's
[1:18:48] been attacking the word, then why
[1:18:50] wouldn't he attack the message for it is
[1:18:52] the word.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so there then
[1:18:57] there comes A UNITY BY THE SPIRIT OF
[1:19:01] GOD, A LEADERSHIP because we come under
[1:19:04] the same leadership. Amen. Brother
[1:19:06] Brandham said, "Listen to the
[1:19:07] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:19:09] in this last stage. What he says FROM
[1:19:12] GOD, THE BRIDE will say."
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; The spirit, everybody say, "The spirit."
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; The prophet
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; and the bride.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; The bride
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; will be saying the same thing.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. and what they will say
[1:19:24] will have already been said in the word.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? SO THEN THERE'S NO
[1:19:30] CONTRADICTION. You cannot say that that
[1:19:33] uh that the word of God is in continuity
[1:19:36] but all of a sudden this bride in this
[1:19:38] age is speaking something contrary to
[1:19:41] this.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; It all speaks together.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Why? Because from
[1:19:47] beginning to end, man, that elect has
[1:19:50] been led by the spirit of God.
[1:19:53] So the spirit of truth is going to lead
[1:19:55] us, every son, every daughter into all
[1:19:59] truth. He's not going to lead some
[1:20:01] people just in Jesus name baptism and
[1:20:05] refuse to lead them the rest of the way.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lead some people, you
[1:20:11] know, lead a person to see the the truth
[1:20:13] of the serpent seed doctrine
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; and then they can't see the truth of
[1:20:17] Malachi 4.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Can you say amen?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Now, this is exactly what the Bible
[1:20:24] says. He will lead and guide us into all
[1:20:27] truth.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; So, so if we're going to speak the same
[1:20:31] thing, it's going to take the Holy
[1:20:33] Spirit to bring a revelation that we can
[1:20:35] understand exactly what a prophet said.
[1:20:38] Now, you may not be able to teach it
[1:20:40] just like a prophet. You may not be, BUT
[1:20:42] THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN IN YOUR HEART
[1:20:44] THAT SAYS THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE spirit of God leading you.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:51] Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If the Holy Spirit
[1:20:54] is in you, it'll lead you right to the
[1:20:56] word."
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, it means that
[1:21:00] he'll lead you to the vindicated.
[1:21:02] If anyone's got the spirit of God truly
[1:21:04] has the spirit of God, isn't that so?
[1:21:07] It'll lead him to the message of the
[1:21:09] hour.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. For this age, because the word
[1:21:13] comes to a prophet. Even our Lord Jesus
[1:21:16] when he was on earth went straight to
[1:21:18] the prophet
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; for he was the word.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; So the prophet explained exactly why
[1:21:25] Jesus went to a prophet before he
[1:21:27] started his ministry. BEFORE HE DONE
[1:21:28] ANYTHING, he went straight to the
[1:21:29] prophet
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the word. It all had to be
[1:21:33] together. Can you say amen?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love the Lord. Yes.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; So then if you notice, he the spirit of
[1:21:41] truth
[1:21:42] is to show us things to come. It's the
[1:21:45] spirit of revelation. Then
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; How we need that not just in
[1:21:51] understanding the word but just in our
[1:21:54] life in general.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what the Holy Spirit
[1:22:01] does when he comes into an individual.
[1:22:04] He reveals things to us. Do you believe
[1:22:07] it?
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet talks about Jesus. There he
[1:22:11] is, a man.
[1:22:13] Tears filled his eyes at times. When
[1:22:17] he's at the the grave of Lazarus, the
[1:22:21] Bible says he wept. He was full of
[1:22:24] compassion
[1:22:26] and and and tears flowed from his eyes.
[1:22:30] And you know uh because of just the
[1:22:34] sympathy for the people and yet he was
[1:22:38] GOD
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; CLOTHED IN HUMANITY TO TAKE AWAY OUR
[1:22:43] SIN. Right
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; now the prophet said see yet behind that
[1:22:49] humanity he had something behind him
[1:22:53] that could look right down into the
[1:22:55] heart of a man and know all about him.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; See, spirit of revelation, prophetic
[1:23:03] spirit,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; spirit of discernment,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; a man that was well, he said it was only
[1:23:12] given to the father to know
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; the end time, to know when he's coming
[1:23:17] back.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He said he didn't even know. And yet the
[1:23:22] God in him could look through these eyes
[1:23:25] and when he looks at a human being could
[1:23:28] know all about him.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that amazing?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; See now now the people didn't know who
[1:23:35] he was. HE WAS CLOTHED IN FLESH. HE WAS
[1:23:39] A MAN standing there. Yet something was
[1:23:42] in that flesh that was God.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; People didn't know who he was.
[1:23:48] That flesh was a veil that God hid
[1:23:51] behind. Ain't that right? Yet Jesus said
[1:23:55] to them in John 8:24, "If you believe me
[1:23:58] not, if you believe not that I am he,
[1:24:01] you shall die in your sins."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; PROPHET SAID HE TRIED TO GET THE
[1:24:05] MESSAGE, THE REVELATION to them of who
[1:24:07] he was. He was a man whose eyes looked
[1:24:11] at the face of the suffering and wept
[1:24:14] for them. And yet THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS
[1:24:17] IN HIM would get behind that human
[1:24:20] vision and see all things.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; He could see things that was things that
[1:24:25] were present and things that were yet to
[1:24:27] come.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; He could foretell the end FROM THE
[1:24:31] BEGINNING BECAUSE GOD WAS behind those
[1:24:34] human eyes.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; But now notice what he says. Still
[1:24:40] talking about being led by the spirit of
[1:24:42] God. Now, he says, "Let God come into
[1:24:45] your life and take control of you, and
[1:24:48] he'll show you things to come. For it's
[1:24:51] not you no more. It's the Holy Spirit in
[1:24:54] your life back there looking through
[1:24:57] them mortal eyes to pick out things."
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we're in a we're in a world where
[1:25:07] no one sees wrong.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Because they're blind.
[1:25:12] did not did not in Leoa
[1:25:15] Jesus told them you're blind, naked, and
[1:25:17] miserable and you know it not.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; They're blind and they cannot see the
[1:25:21] sin even though the sin is there.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; There's no conviction. There's no
[1:25:25] repentance. There's nothing because they
[1:25:26] don't see the wrong in it.
[1:25:30] But see what then then what would cause
[1:25:32] us to look
[1:25:35] and and see the sin so much that it
[1:25:39] would cause our hearts to grieve
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; and we would be burdened for the lost.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of God that is showing
[1:25:52] us things.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Hope you understand.
[1:25:57] See, it's not you no more. It's the Holy
[1:26:00] Spirit cannot be led. Well, you well,
[1:26:03] the Holy Spirit led me, you know, to
[1:26:05] pray for someone and the Holy Spirit
[1:26:07] leads me here, you know, to go here and
[1:26:09] to go here. So many people saying,
[1:26:12] claiming the Lord speaking to them and
[1:26:14] and all these things, but yet they can't
[1:26:16] even see the simple wrongs.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; They can't see the wrongs in a woman
[1:26:21] cutting her hair. They can't see the
[1:26:22] wrongs in in the fact of just not coming
[1:26:25] to church.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; They can't see the wrongs in in in uh uh
[1:26:30] uh man and woman living uh in adultery.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THERE TO TO TELL THEM
[1:26:37] THAT'S WRONG.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Hope you understand.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; See what about women preaching? What
[1:26:45] what what about those things? And yet
[1:26:47] the spirit leading them here, they say,
[1:26:49] and leading them here and leading them
[1:26:50] there. that can't can't open their eyes
[1:26:54] to see the things that are that are evil
[1:26:57] before God's eyes.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; See, so so we find then that it takes
[1:27:02] the spirit of God in a man to show us
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; they that are led by the spirit of God
[1:27:11] are the sons of God.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:27:16] See, now notice when we when we read the
[1:27:18] word of God, then see, we want God in us
[1:27:22] to look through our mortal eyes.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had him do it
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; to where you're reading and maybe you
[1:27:31] you you didn't know what the scripture
[1:27:33] was before, but as your eyes fall upon
[1:27:36] it and and and something begins to
[1:27:38] enlighten you about that scripture,
[1:27:41] well, what is it? IT'S THE SPIRIT OF
[1:27:43] GOD.
[1:27:45] THAT'S ACTIVE IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; We don't want the spirit of God to lay
[1:27:49] dormant.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I got the spirit of God. Well,
[1:27:53] then he's got to be active.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; He's got to be leading us.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It It's just the truth. God, take
[1:28:02] my eyes.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; God, show me things through my eyes. Can
[1:28:06] you say amen? Not so I can be
[1:28:08] judgmental. Not so I can BE A
[1:28:10] KNOW-IT-ALL. NOT SO I CAN BE WHATEVER,
[1:28:12] BUT TO KEEP ME RIGHT.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; See, so so he he takes things God in us
[1:28:26] begins to lead us into things and we
[1:28:29] begin to see things that maybe just our
[1:28:32] carnal mind would have never been able
[1:28:34] to see. Well, you know, uh uh it it just
[1:28:38] shows that we're not just making things
[1:28:40] up.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; We we're we're not just guessing at
[1:28:44] things. It's the spirit of God that is
[1:28:47] leading us. We're being led. Can you say
[1:28:50] amen?
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Well, this takes a total surrender. And
[1:28:53] I I pray God just makes sense out of it
[1:28:55] all. But but brother Brandham said
[1:28:58] you've got to completely surrender your
[1:29:00] own thoughts, your own will, your own
[1:29:03] mind, and let the mind of Christ operate
[1:29:06] in you.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Says, now do you think Christ uh
[1:29:12] the mind of Christ in you would say the
[1:29:14] days of miracles is passed? Do you think
[1:29:16] the mind of Christ in you would say the
[1:29:18] Bible's right in some places and not in
[1:29:20] others? You think the mind of Christ
[1:29:22] would sanction every word that Christ
[1:29:24] ever said? See? Well, it's your wood.
[1:29:27] See, it's right. So, if you don't use
[1:29:30] your own mind, just use his mind. He
[1:29:33] said, "That's how visions at nighttime
[1:29:35] come." See, I don't use my own mind.
[1:29:37] See, I couldn't do nothing but just
[1:29:40] yield myself to him. Then he uses my
[1:29:43] mind, my eyes, MY MOUTH. HE'S MY ALL.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; JUST YIELD. That's the way you do it.
[1:29:50] That's the way these ministers do when
[1:29:52] they're preaching the gospel. They get
[1:29:54] up here and take a text. Why? They just
[1:29:57] start off to preach and yield themselves
[1:29:59] to God. They're ministers. See, first
[1:30:01] thing you know, the Holy Spirit maybe
[1:30:02] take them on another text. Take them
[1:30:04] somewhere's else. See? Amen. See, what
[1:30:07] is it? It's the spirit of God in
[1:30:09] operation.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It's letting the spirit do whatever he
[1:30:13] wants to do.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; It's very important that we're led by
[1:30:22] the spirit. True.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You see, God made us to where he can use
[1:30:27] us. God, man is God's agent, as the
[1:30:30] prophet would tell us. God uses man to
[1:30:33] work his will.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Parents, God wants to use you.
[1:30:38] Ministers, God wants to use you.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Deacons, God wants to use you.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Trustees, whoever, mamas, uh, you know,
[1:30:47] God, God wants to use us all. Maybe
[1:30:50] you're the boss. Maybe you're the
[1:30:51] employee.
[1:30:53] But wherever God has put you, he wants
[1:30:56] to use you.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, "Even though the
[1:31:04] Holy Spirit covers the earth, it is
[1:31:06] almost helpless until it gets into you
[1:31:07] and me." The spirit of God cannot
[1:31:10] operate until it comes into us. We human
[1:31:13] beings to operate.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; So then God is depending upon you and I.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And we're not just the
[1:31:22] general person that he just says, "hm,
[1:31:24] I'm going to try them and see if I can
[1:31:26] work. If I can't, I'm going to try this
[1:31:27] one and see if I can't. If I, well, I'm
[1:31:29] going to just try to find somebody
[1:31:31] here." No, we are chosen for this age as
[1:31:34] SONS OF GOD. AMEN. GOD'S GOT CONFIDENCE
[1:31:37] in us.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; He's dependent upon you and I.
[1:31:44] Brother Bram talks of holding a meeting
[1:31:46] in Mississippi, I believe it was, and
[1:31:49] y'all's heard it, but you know, he talks
[1:31:51] about that little mother walking around
[1:31:54] packing a little baby. And he said there
[1:31:56] was another little mother sitting there,
[1:31:58] just typical little southern mother with
[1:32:00] a little gingham, calico, whatever dress
[1:32:04] on and just a little housewife. But the
[1:32:07] Lord kept dealing with that woman. Go
[1:32:09] pray for that baby. while she looked and
[1:32:12] the woman had a prayer card and she
[1:32:14] says, "Oh, I'd be afraid to go pray for
[1:32:15] that baby. Brother Brandham's going to
[1:32:17] pray for that baby tonight." The woman
[1:32:19] said, the woman said, "The woman's got a
[1:32:21] prayer card." And so I I wouldn't do it,
[1:32:25] you know, and she turned around. The
[1:32:27] Lord said to her, just revealed to her
[1:32:29] heart, "Go pray for that baby."
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; See, it's the leading of the Holy
[1:32:34] Spirit.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; See, and he said, "Well, it just kept
[1:32:38] haunting her so much. She said, 'Well,
[1:32:41] if the woman comes back through here
[1:32:42] again, I'm going to stop her. So, she
[1:32:44] said, 'Lady, would you take my seat and
[1:32:47] sit down here? I know you're just wore
[1:32:49] out with that baby and he won't be here
[1:32:50] for a couple hours yet. And the lady
[1:32:53] said, "Thank you, sister. I appreciate
[1:32:55] that. I hate to take your seat." And so,
[1:32:59] finally, she says, "Would you mind if I
[1:33:01] just offer a little word of prayer for
[1:33:03] that baby? I see you got a prayer card.
[1:33:05] perhaps brother Brandham will pray for
[1:33:07] that baby tonight but just to relieve my
[1:33:10] feeling would you mind if I offer a
[1:33:12] little prayer and she said why certainly
[1:33:14] not dear sister you know and she held
[1:33:17] the baby out and the little mother laid
[1:33:19] her hands on that baby and began to pray
[1:33:21] a simple prayer now brother says that
[1:33:25] that woman with that child got called in
[1:33:27] the prayer line when that woman came up
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen he says now he says the Holy Spirit
[1:33:34] began to talk to the woman and tell her
[1:33:37] who she was, what was the matter with
[1:33:38] her baby, but said, "You know, your
[1:33:41] baby's already healed cuz a lady has
[1:33:43] already prayed for her."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; See, and standing up there in that
[1:33:47] balcony, God's already heard her prayer
[1:33:49] and the baby is already healed. You
[1:33:52] don't have to worry about it. It's all
[1:33:53] right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God. Can you say
[1:34:00] amen?
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Led. Led. See? Well, WELL, WHAT WHAT IF
[1:34:05] he says the mother failed to do what God
[1:34:07] told her to do? See, it wasn't the
[1:34:10] evangelist place.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; God works in all the ley. WE HAVE
[1:34:18] CERTAIN JOBS to do, but you have to pray
[1:34:20] for one another and God will take care
[1:34:22] of you.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I hope in this little sermon tonight
[1:34:27] that it can make some sense to you.
[1:34:31] Whatever job you have to do,
[1:34:36] don't try to do it in the flesh.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Be led.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You may have the ability to preach and
[1:34:43] put a sermon together, but it doesn't
[1:34:45] make you God's minister.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You may have a great voice, be ranked
[1:34:49] among the top best singers.
[1:34:52] You could sing like a mocking bird, but
[1:34:54] that doesn't make you God's singer.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; See, God has to lead you. Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Amen." God has to lead
[1:35:02] you. Brother Brandon tells us how the
[1:35:04] visions come to him. It wasn't just a
[1:35:07] natural thing, but the visions came to
[1:35:09] him. He said, "It's just yielding
[1:35:10] yourself to the Holy Spirit, getting
[1:35:13] yourself out of the way, your own ideas,
[1:35:15] and just be led by the spirit of God."
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, he was already
[1:35:22] designed to have visions because he was
[1:35:24] a prophet. But that man had to yield
[1:35:27] himself to God. Yes, he did.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; had to yield himself to the spirit. You
[1:35:31] may already be ordained to be a
[1:35:33] preacher, but you have to yield yourself
[1:35:35] to the spirit of God. You may already be
[1:35:37] ordained to be a musician and called
[1:35:39] with the gift to sing or whatever it is,
[1:35:42] but you have to yield yourself to God in
[1:35:46] order for God to use that gift, for God
[1:35:48] to use that talent. Can you say amen?
[1:35:51] Amen. See, it's it's an anointing. Gifts
[1:35:53] and callings are are are without
[1:35:55] repentance. And and we know these
[1:35:57] things, but but you know, and and you
[1:36:00] couldn't be what you are without the
[1:36:01] ability. Amen. God given you that
[1:36:04] ability. Ain't that right? But what you
[1:36:06] do with it is is up to you.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; God gave Elvis the gift to sing and he
[1:36:12] gave it to the devil.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yielded himself, surrendered himself to
[1:36:16] the devil.
[1:36:18] And a lot of these gospel groups, the
[1:36:20] Isaac's and the Gaithers and I don't
[1:36:23] know, I could name a bunch of them,
[1:36:26] but that's what they're doing. They're
[1:36:27] just yielding themselves, them gifts to
[1:36:29] the devil.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I was starting to sing country music. I
[1:36:33] one one saw where one uh the Isaacs were
[1:36:37] introduced the other day as the uh uh
[1:36:40] the group of gospel and the group of
[1:36:42] country.
[1:36:43] They walked up there like it was a some
[1:36:45] proud thing to have.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; I thought, "What a shame. Shame on you."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Shame on you. You owe Judas.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they are. They start
[1:36:54] out with the gift of God, using it for
[1:36:57] God, and they get up in their minds and
[1:36:59] they think they're something else, and
[1:37:00] they think they're doing it all. They're
[1:37:02] walking after the flesh.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; It's nothing but a Judas.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "They're not even fit
[1:37:10] to sing a gospel song. That's right.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; But see, what we want to do is yield
[1:37:18] ourselves to the spirit of God.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to surrender. Amen.
[1:37:24] Brother Brandham says, "Now, I'm going
[1:37:25] to tell you a secret as I leave. You've
[1:37:27] been sweet and kind. I've never exactly
[1:37:30] expressed this I know of public before."
[1:37:34] You say, "Brother Brandham, what is that
[1:37:35] gift?" It's a gift of knowing how to get
[1:37:38] William Brham out of the way. So Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ can live through a vessel. See,
[1:37:45] it's just getting yourself out of the
[1:37:47] way. Another place, what is a gift? Not
[1:37:49] something you take and chop and turn.
[1:37:52] No, it's knowing how to get yourself out
[1:37:54] of the way that God can use you.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; A gift is only getting yourself out,
[1:38:00] then God uses it. Another place it's
[1:38:03] finding God to getting yourself out of
[1:38:06] the way and letting the Holy Spirit use
[1:38:08] you to whatever he wants to do. That's
[1:38:11] it. The main thing of any gift is
[1:38:14] getting your own ideas away and let
[1:38:18] Christ. Then whatever it said, if you
[1:38:21] want to know whether it's Christ or not,
[1:38:23] just a sensation, leave it alone. If
[1:38:25] it's just an emotion, leave that alone.
[1:38:28] But if it's written in the word, then
[1:38:29] it's God. Always judge everything that
[1:38:32] any spirit tells you by the word. The
[1:38:34] word don't never get away from that
[1:38:36] word. If you do, you're lost.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; So it a gift is not, well, I've got
[1:38:40] power to do this and I've got power.
[1:38:43] Your power of a gift is get yourself out
[1:38:46] of the way. And the gift that God has
[1:38:50] given you operates through that after
[1:38:52] you're out of the way. Can you say amen?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the musicians will come,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; bless his name.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Another thing I believe that God has the
[1:39:06] answers to life's problems.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; And I think it's very important for us
[1:39:13] to comprehend.
[1:39:14] He has the answer to life's problems.
[1:39:18] He knows the challenges. He knows
[1:39:22] knows the ups and downs before you get
[1:39:24] there. He knows the giants in your way.
[1:39:26] He knows the the the the troubles that
[1:39:29] you have
[1:39:31] and he knew that before the foundation
[1:39:33] of the world. But he knows what to do
[1:39:36] when you don't know what to do.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're a family crisis faces a
[1:39:44] crisis and you don't know what to do.
[1:39:47] God knows what to do.
[1:39:50] And if we can learn
[1:39:54] not to handle it after our flesh, not to
[1:39:57] handle it after our own way,
[1:40:00] but to yield to the spirit of God and
[1:40:02] wait until the spirit of God leads us.
[1:40:06] Can you say amen?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. He knows what to do. See,
[1:40:12] and even when we think we know what to
[1:40:14] do, he knows even better.
[1:40:17] He's always got the right answer for us.
[1:40:21] Do you believe it? That's why Proverbs
[1:40:24] 3:5 says, "Trust in the Lord with all
[1:40:26] thine heart, and lean not unto thine own
[1:40:28] understanding.
[1:40:30] In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he
[1:40:32] shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in
[1:40:34] thine own eyes. Fear the Lord and depart
[1:40:37] from evil." Amen. So, a son of God, he's
[1:40:42] not just to be led, you know, when
[1:40:44] they're using their gift to preach or to
[1:40:46] sing or whatever. Amen. But we are to be
[1:40:49] led by the spirit every day of our lives
[1:40:56] to where we become sensitive to his
[1:40:58] spirit. till we become sensitive to his
[1:41:01] auctioning
[1:41:03] to where we understand
[1:41:05] that not everything that is happening is
[1:41:07] for our bad. God's using it for our
[1:41:11] good.
[1:41:13] Amen.
[1:41:15] Amen.
[1:41:17] You know, he's not just the spirit of
[1:41:18] truth, but he's the spirit of prophecy,
[1:41:21] knowing what will be. Do you realize
[1:41:24] that
[1:41:27] he can help us sidestep trouble
[1:41:30] if we'll just yield ourselves to him?
[1:41:34] He can save us a lot of headaches
[1:41:38] just by yielding and being sensitive to
[1:41:40] his spirit.
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:45] Amen.
[1:41:48] Spirit of wisdom. He is the spirit of
[1:41:50] wisdom. The Bible says he can give us
[1:41:52] wisdom to handle things.
[1:41:57] Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Give us wisdom to speak words.
[1:42:03] He's the spirit of grace. The Bible says
[1:42:06] grace to keep us from things. Keep our
[1:42:10] feet from falling.
[1:42:14] Oh, do you love him?
[1:42:16] I think we need the spirit of God more
[1:42:18] than ever before. need the spirit of
[1:42:20] God.
[1:42:22] You know, Brother Brandham in a prayer
[1:42:24] of his, he said, "Lord, we're living in
[1:42:25] a day when people are taught so hard
[1:42:28] against this." Talking about discernment
[1:42:31] of the spirit,
[1:42:33] said they're against you, against your
[1:42:35] word, against your spirit, they don't
[1:42:37] know what to believe.
[1:42:40] And church, that is the truth.
[1:42:44] We're living in a day that people just
[1:42:46] don't see the importance of the spirit
[1:42:49] of God.
[1:42:52] They they just want to go with what they
[1:42:54] want to do, what they want to say, what
[1:42:56] what how they want to act, what they're
[1:42:59] the boss.
[1:43:02] But every one of us. We are to be led by
[1:43:05] the spirit of God. But people have no
[1:43:08] time for the spirit of God. I've, you
[1:43:09] know, you you watch it. You know, even
[1:43:11] in churches, but not just I I'm not
[1:43:15] saying here. I'm just saying just in
[1:43:16] general, people ain't got time. They
[1:43:18] want to hurry church up
[1:43:21] where God just ain't got time to move.
[1:43:26] They keep a preacher on time clock. They
[1:43:28] teach the song leader on time clock cuz
[1:43:32] they they got to get up and work. But
[1:43:34] but we find it it ain't only on
[1:43:36] Wednesday nights, Sunday. They got more
[1:43:38] things to do. Everybody's got something
[1:43:41] to do except get wait upon the Lord. And
[1:43:45] that's the most important thing is is
[1:43:48] letting God have his way. Cuz I'm
[1:43:52] telling you, church, if if we ain't got
[1:43:54] him and if we can't wait upon him and
[1:43:56] and we can't let him just have his way
[1:43:59] and and and these things, then what are
[1:44:01] we going to do? Can you say amen? You
[1:44:05] love him. God bless you is our prayer.
[1:44:08] Amen. me Lord.
[1:44:12] The fire of your spirit,
[1:44:15] oh consume
[1:44:18] me, Lord.
[1:44:24] Oh, come and make
[1:44:27] me Lord.
[1:44:30] Bless the broken pieces
[1:44:33] of my life.
[1:44:37] Let me be used
[1:44:40] Lord
[1:44:42] for you. Oh, sing it again. Oh, consume
[1:44:47] me
[1:44:49] Lord
[1:44:51] with the fire of his spirit.
[1:44:56] Consume
[1:44:57] me Lord.
[1:45:01] Make me just like you. Come and break
[1:45:06] me Lord
[1:45:09] and bless the broken pieces
[1:45:13] of my life.
[1:45:17] Let me be used
[1:45:20] long
[1:45:22] for you. Sing it as a prayer. Oh,
[1:45:27] consume
[1:45:29] me Lord
[1:45:31] with the fire of your spirit.
[1:45:35] Consume
[1:45:37] me Lord.
[1:45:41] Make me just like you.
[1:45:44] Come and break
[1:45:46] me, Lord.
[1:45:49] and bless the broken pieces
[1:45:52] of my life.
[1:45:57] Let me be used,
[1:46:00] Lord,
[1:46:01] for you. I need more of you. That's the
[1:46:05] way it's got to be.
[1:46:09] I need more
[1:46:12] of
[1:46:14] you.
[1:46:19] That's the way it's got to be.
[1:46:25] I need more
[1:46:29] of
[1:46:31] you.
[1:46:34] Oh yes. Till there's just no room for
[1:46:39] me.
[1:46:45] All those wasted
[1:46:48] hours and minutes.
[1:46:51] Yeah, Lord.
[1:46:53] They're yours now. From the start to the
[1:46:57] finish.
[1:46:59] I need more
[1:47:02] of
[1:47:04] you
[1:47:06] in
[1:47:08] me.
[1:47:10] I need more
[1:47:14] of. Is that the way you feel tonight?
[1:47:17] Can you sing it as a prayer?
[1:47:20] Oh,
[1:47:22] that's the way it's got to be.
[1:47:26] Oh, I need more
[1:47:31] of
[1:47:32] you.
[1:47:36] Glory. till there's no room left in me.
[1:47:46] And all those wasted
[1:47:49] hours and minutes,
[1:47:54] they're yours now. From the start to the
[1:47:58] finish. Oh, I need more
[1:48:03] of
[1:48:04] you
[1:48:07] in
[1:48:13] God bless you is our prayer.
[1:48:17] We certainly love the Lord.
[1:48:20] Amen.
[1:48:22] there's ever a time that we need to
[1:48:25] meditate upon him, not meditate upon our
[1:48:29] problems, not meditate upon others
[1:48:32] problems,
[1:48:33] but just meditate upon God, not meditate
[1:48:37] upon the news,
[1:48:40] but just focus upon God and where he
[1:48:45] becomes such a reality in our own
[1:48:47] personal lives and we can become
[1:48:50] sensitive to his spirit. Can you say
[1:48:52] amen?
[1:48:54] Amen. We could stand to our feet. Amen.
[1:48:58] We want to remember those that are sick,
[1:49:00] not feeling good. Uh there's uh quite a
[1:49:04] few uh that are just not uh doing good
[1:49:08] tonight. And so we want to uh keep them
[1:49:11] in our prayer and u uh that the Lord
[1:49:14] will just touch them and help them. Um,
[1:49:19] uh, Sister Kim, she had gotten her
[1:49:22] result back of the CT scan and, uh,
[1:49:27] there's nothing there to be seen. Um,
[1:49:31] you know, there was a bag of fluid.
[1:49:34] Well, they didn't take the bag out. She
[1:49:37] found out that they've left that bag
[1:49:39] there, and that was probably why they
[1:49:41] were afraid that something's going to
[1:49:43] start back and grow. Uh but um so they
[1:49:48] said that's that's what's hurting her
[1:49:50] back and um then they've got you know
[1:49:54] two metal stints around that stone.
[1:49:57] Um
[1:49:59] and uh that bile and infection and all
[1:50:02] that's going through there and they're
[1:50:05] hoping the point is is they're hoping
[1:50:08] that bile and stuff will kind of wear
[1:50:10] that stone down and get it to move. Uh
[1:50:15] they said it's the largest stone they've
[1:50:17] ever seen. And uh so just to be honest,
[1:50:21] they're perplexed at what to do with it,
[1:50:24] but that's what's causing the pain in
[1:50:27] the stomach and u you know, bless her
[1:50:32] heart, they're not wanting her to do
[1:50:34] surgery uh at this point. uh waiting for
[1:50:39] a few months unless it's just an
[1:50:40] absolute have to where she just can't
[1:50:44] handle the pain and and uh all of that
[1:50:49] stuff and uh so she's just you know
[1:50:53] she's kind of left in a quandry there
[1:50:55] but uh I I you know when the physicians
[1:50:58] don't know what to do God knows and so
[1:51:02] we don't lose heart we don't lose our
[1:51:04] confidence God loves to move when the
[1:51:07] doctors don't know what to do. And I'm
[1:51:10] just believing God to just cause that
[1:51:12] stone to move or to dissolve or
[1:51:15] something. And uh God will just help
[1:51:19] Sister Kim, give her the grace to to
[1:51:22] press on. Amen. And uh so uh but uh just
[1:51:28] keep sister Martha in our prayer and uh
[1:51:31] God just continuing to help her and and
[1:51:34] just so many needs not just present but
[1:51:37] around the world among the bride of
[1:51:39] Christ. And so a lot to pray for. Amen.
[1:51:43] And so God bless you. Remember service
[1:51:46] uh Sunday and um we look forward to
[1:51:51] seeing you again. Uh, Sister Sharon, God
[1:51:54] bless you. Good to have you. Amen. And u
[1:51:59] uh we'll this dismiss in a word of
[1:52:02] prayer. Amen. Let's just pray. Father,
[1:52:06] we thank you Lord for all
