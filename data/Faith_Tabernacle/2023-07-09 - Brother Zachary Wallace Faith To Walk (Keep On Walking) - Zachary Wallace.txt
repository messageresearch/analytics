mercy walked in and it played in my case it called to the stands God's Saving Grace the blood was presented and he covered my sins that's when mercy walking [Music] I stood there and wondered how

stand God's Saving Grace the blood was presenting and he covered my sin the moment that Mercy Walked In oh mercy walked in it played in our case he called to the stand God's Saving Grace the blood was

case this morning come on sister Hannah amen I'm so glad he took our place [Music] as she made her way to Jesus when she stumbled through the tears that made her blind she felt such pain some spoken anger she heard folks whisper there's no place here for her kind still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she knelt before his feet [Music] and though she spoke no words everything she said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster I've come to pour my praise on him [Music] so don't be angry while I wash his feet with my tears and I drive him with my hair me you weren't there the night he found me you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his love all around me and you don't know the cost [Music] I can't forget the way life used to be I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound and I spent my days poured my life without measure into her box I thought I thought I'd found oh until the day when my Jesus came to me he healed my soul with the Wonder of his time much so now I'm giving back to him all of the praise he's worthy of I've been forgiven and that's why I love him so much I've come to poor my my praise on him [Music] Alabaster Box so don't be angry while I wash his feet with my tears and I dry them with my hair with my hair yeah dare the night Jesus found me you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped

we are in your presence [Music] we are in your presence fill us with your power and live inside of me oh you're the Living Water [Music] that ever drawing fountains [Music] foreign [Music] immigration we just desire Lord to do it ordinance desire that you would speak your words for our hearts that we receive it Lord that we would do Among Us what you normally have asked you to have your way to sort of sound the name of Jesus Christ bless you is with you back here for the brothers were saying a few things that this community really scare you often that you've been Eleanor Sean inviting like the last time or something you know you get these nervousnesses of a Preacher but uh uh trust that the Lord will just override all of that this morning and if you have your Bibles I'd like to turn to Joshua the fifth chapter brother Sean called me the other day and he was apologizing that kind of unexpectedly he's ended up going out of town and and I told him you know I was like I would have been good to see your brother but you know it it's all right I'm kind of scared of you anyway you know you're one of the greatest Ministers of the gospel I've ever ever met you know and just somebody that will stand on this message and preach it without fear or favor and just uh just a giant of a man in my side and and so I was a little bit okay with him not being here because it's pretty intimidating to preach to one of your Heroes but uh but we just believe the Lord orders things exactly the way they're supposed to be I'm just going to trust him to give us what we have need of today Joshua the fifth chapter and the 13th verse says and it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and Joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant and the captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place where I'll now standest is Holy and Joshua did so if we would look into this a little more we would see that this is where Joshua received his his directions on how to take Jericho this is where he received his his marching orders and how to be Victorious and it wasn't Joshua's idea it wasn't Joshua's plan it was directly from the captain of the Lord's host now in Matthew 17 and verse 20 I will read one more verse there for a text today I want to take Faith to walk and as kind of a subtitle I want to say just keep walking Matthew 17 and 20 this is where the man was brought before Jesus with his son and he asked Jesus if there was anything Jesus could do for him and and Jesus said if you'll believe and hear the disciples come to him in Matthew 17 20 and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief they're asking why couldn't we cast out this this spirit and he says because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you may be seated this morning so I want to just preach on that Faith to walk focusing on uh just keeping on walking and this uh this this here thought about the Mustard Seed um I I always in my mind had understood this scripture in this in this context I thought of of Faith the size of a mustard seed and I thought okay if you can get Faith and you know you all are familiar with me I build paper airplanes in church so I bring mustard seeds too and uh Faith the size of a mustard seed is a very small quantity there's not a lot to this and I've got I've just got a a whole probably a half dozen of them there between my my fingers and that's not you know one of those mustard seeds that's not a whole lot and in my mind I always thought that it meant that Faith was so incredibly powerful that if you could just have that much faith if you spoke suddenly that mountain would just vanish that was my thought I mean you can't even see that probably in the palm of my hand there it's so small and I thought in my mind well if you could just have that Faith the size of a mustard seed then you know that mountain would just vanish and so it made me feel like I must have an incredibly small amount of faith if I'm struggling with you know this this matter over here or this matter over here but you know I started looking into the message and that's not really the way brother Branham taught it and uh I'll just go through a few of these here brother man says a Mustard Seed Faith won't perform a miracle but if you'll hold on to it it'll bring you out all right so this little Mustard Seed of faith it will not perform a miracle and that really struck me because I'm always thinking about you know like if I could just get enough Faith as a mustard seed and then he tells me that a Mustard Seed Faith won't perform a miracle again he says here uh that was in 62 here in 58 he says and you might not have faith enough to have a miracle performed on you and if you've got if you've just got Mustard Seed Faith stay with it it'll lead you to the light and it won't mix with nothing else again he says uh you know some people has great big Faith like that and they can be healed in a moment that would be a miracle some has faith that that much can be healed in a week some has Mustard Seed Faith takes them a long time but just follow it it's genuine it'll bring you to the light just hold on to it and keep moving and it'll bring you out you just keep holding to that Faith it'll bring you through if it's real mustard seed you know Mustard Seed don't mix with nothing it's genuine you know it just it makes me think of that that mountain and how the prophet says you know you speak to that mountain and maybe nothing would happen but maybe a little grain of sand on the back of that mountain would trickle off and and be removed in the back of the sea and I'm wondering if you know that little grain of sand might not be about the size of the Mustard Seed Faith you've had you had Faith Like a mustard seed and that's Faith Like a mustard seed move that grain of sand and the next day it's going to move maybe two grains of sand and as your faith if you'll hold on to that faith that mountain will be gone and again he says here uh and maybe you have Mustard Seed Faith you can look this up just type in Mustard Seed Faith he talks about it quite a few times he says just a little bit but if you've got Mustard Seed Faith just hold on to it Mustard Seed won't mix with nothing else and if you've got real faith it won't mix with no unbelief hold on to it and it'll wind you around the curve and find you're not in a cave but in the light just hold on to it Mustard Seed Faith will not perform a miracle but if you'll keep that Mustard Seed Faith and you just keep holding on to it and keep walking with it it will take you out of the darkness it will take you out of sickness it will move a mountain there is nothing that is impossible if you'll hold on to that little Mustard Seed of Faith because that little Mustard Seed is putting you in contact with omnipotence and the other thing this is just my thought on this that I thought about is if you take this little Mustard Seed and you plant it and you just give it some time it's going to grow and it's going to grow and it's gonna grow and one place Jesus says you plant that seed and that Mustard Seed grows until it's one of the biggest plants in the garden and the birds are all coming down and and it's a great big big a tree-like plant if you'll hold on to that Mustard Seed but here's the thing that that I'm really getting at today friends is is many times we have that Mustard Seed Faith but then we don't see the instant result and we begin to question we begin to wander and here we see uh Joshua met with that captain of the host of the Lord and he meets with him and and you'll see uh let me go to Joshua chapter six just flip over there with me Joshua chapter 6. verse 11 and they were given a commandment on how to be victorious in this battle and so they they gather around and verse 11 it says so the Ark of the Lord can pass the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp verse 14 and the second day they can pass the city once and return into the camp so they did six days Time After Time After Time they're doing the same thing they're going to the same church service they're believing the same promise and it just feels like they're going in circles and they were they were literally walking around in circles and they didn't see one bit of change day after day after day they'd say well I've walked this way before I've believed this promise before the prophet said to do this we're doing this but I don't see any change I don't see any difference you know if they'd got to day six and just said what in the world are we doing let's elect a new leader let's get rid of this Joshua this guy's obviously not a military leader this guy obviously doesn't know how to handle these situations we need to be building battering rams we need to be building catapults we need to be you know building ladders to scale the walls we've got to be doing something besides running around in circles and not getting anywhere we've done this day after day after day nothing has changed yes it wasn't reasonable friends it didn't make any sense but they were following a prophet's word they were following a message that came straight from almighty God that told him if you'll just obey my word if you'll just do what I'm telling you to do you're going to see those strongholds come down that land is going to be given to you you won't even have to fight for it you won't have to swing a battering ram those walls are going to fall down just obey my word and it got to feeling boring and it got to feeling mundane because it felt so human foreign it felt so human to walk around that City again and again and again they walked around that City 13 times but every footstep was a footstep of Victory because it was according to the word of God and you know what happened they simply obeyed that word day after day after day until suddenly the power of God came down they shouted a shout of Victory the walls begin to tremble the walls begin to shake the whole stronghill fell to pieces why because every day normal people were following the leadership of the word of God and it felt natural it felt human and it didn't make a lot of sense but if you'll stay with that word of God you'll watch The Impossible become reality so do you have the faith to take another step Prince do you have the faith to walk according to the word if the word says to walk around the city then walk around the city if the word says that believe and you and your household shall be see us be saved then you hold on to that promise there is not enough devils in hell to stop that from coming into reality if you'll hold with it but if you hold with it for six weeks and then the seventh week you don't see your family suddenly saved and then you say well I guess it's just not going to happen don't you dare do that you hold on to that Mustard Seed Faith you hold on to that cup full of Faith whatever Faith you have you hold on to that and you keep holding on to that and you obey that word everything will come into subjection to that word just walk with God according to his word you know one of the greatest examples of that is a real man of Faith by the name of Enoch and he walked with God Plumbing to a rapture and I believe that's the exact same thing we're going to do in our Humanity we're going to feel human we're going to feel like we're just getting up and we're tired and we're trying to drink our coffee and get our shoes on and get back to church and then we get there and find out that it's Resurrection morning it's not about how your flesh feels friends it's what your soul believes Enoch Genesis 5 22 walked with God after he began Methuselah three weeks no 300 years year after year after year but every year he was walking with God another year came he says one more year to walk with my God and he walked with him for 300 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him that's the exact same position we're in here friends if I have to live 300 years let me walk with God every single year let me walk with him every single day because I know where this is going I'm nowhere the end of this road is because I have heard a message that has told me that if I'll walk with God he'll take me into the eternities in the sermon he swore by himself brother Graham says this and and it's just I'm sure you've heard it because it's just so beautiful a lot of preachers are gonna gonna remember it but he says listen I'm going to say something look faith is unconscious you believe it I've learned that in the years of travel around the world and meeting the people of all different walks but faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know it that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm and The gales knocking the boat from one side of the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and as quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it was not going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through wonder if I fasted long enough you ever ask those questions but what did the word say I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was the truth the word must be fulfilled and he knowed that what his life was to fulfill them yeah and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand or the left just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God Enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore walk with God doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah doctor says you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that Covenant that he give you and he confirmed it just walk with God then you'll have to go ups and downs don't worry you got to go through Briar patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs down the hillsides up through the mountains over Waters but walk with God oh isn't that just encouraging friends you know there's going to be many different situations that are going to come up there's going to be many different things that will happen in your life just keep walking just keep moving forward can you take take one more step can you take another step then take that step can you take another step take that step prophet of God says he would get to a place where there was absolutely nowhere to go but just you know hardly take one inch farther he says I just take that one more inch and I stand there and watch God move that mountain or make a way through it just keep moving forward don't stop don't hesitate do you have the faith to take one more step then take it you got the faith to make it one more day through that one more day because God is going to bring his promise into reality and it's usually longer than you want but sooner than you really think Galatians chapter 6 and 9 it says and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not and that's something I really want to get across to us is is don't stop in the middle of a supernatural event don't stop right when you know you're just one more day's March from Jericho Fallen flat and you get tired you get weary you stub your toe or you know the guy next to you has bad Bo so you don't want to come back to church or whatever it is why would you let that stop you from seeing one of the most Supernatural things that could ever happen take place the next day just keep walking now I want to get into a little bit of what faith is what is faith and it's not what you imagine faith is a substance it's just as real as any sense in your body will declare anything else it's just as real as as my eyes saying that you know this is a cup of water right here it's just that real it's just as as real as as to say that that is a light right there it's it's reality you're not going to You could argue with me and I like to argue unfortunately and we could argue whether or not that's light or not and we could go one side and up the other but at the end of the day I still know what it's like I really don't care what kind of a crazy argument you came up with that's a light I know it's a light there's just no real discussion on that point [Music] I feel this coat right here I don't care what kind of a theory you'd come up with I don't care what kind of scientific evidence you would have I have every confidence this is a coat I'm wearing I can feel it I can see it it's reality faith is no different friends Faith isn't a hope so Faith isn't a maybe so Faith isn't I think it might be it's a reality faith is a substance it's a real substance of things hoped for it's the proof it's the evidence of things you cannot see with your natural eye now if you had somebody playing an instrument here playing the music faith is just that real you can hear it you take something in your mouth you taste it it's a reality because you know you've gone through so many years of your senses showing you and declaring you what these things are and you're you're confident of those things now the thing is is that those senses can be wrong but that Sixth Sense my eyes might tell me something that isn't true my ears might hear something and it might get it wrong I might taste something and I might think it's one thing and it's another my senses can get things wrong but that Sixth Sense does not if it declares the things of God it's not wrong it's a greater reality than all of this so why would we ever trust how I feel versus what my faith declares why would you ever trust your senses your reasoning your your human understanding against something that's of Greater Authority greater accuracy and cannot fail faith in the word of God will not fail never has never will now program says and works as Faith expressed he says and he promised you the same thing that is if you could believe that it would happen if you can't believe it it just won't happen now I can't make you believe it's the prophet of God if the prophet of God was right here preaching you to this morning he could not make you believe and then it takes it a little bit farther and he says neither can you make yourself believe God has got to give it to you it's a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith your intellectual Faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is down in your heart your intellectual faith can accept it do that that's true and just keep believing it with all your heart until God does reveal it to you just keep believing it until God does reveal it to you and so we can look in the scriptures we can turn brother Amos right all right God bless you Ramos uh you have a Bible here turn with me to uh Isaiah 53 all right we're going to use your your reasoning we're going to use your your your eyesight and we're going to look at Isaiah 53 and uh and see if what the word of God says and this is approaching it intellectually this is approaching it through the human senses we can come here we can see it and we know what it says uh well your senses are gonna need a little help aren't they all right got them glasses uh Isaiah 53 yeah where are we at there you know where I'm looking for [Music] right here right here verse five good and loud you got a good voice right but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all right is that the word of God brother Amos amen it's the word of God Amen is it true amen it's the truth that's right all right so we can we can agree this is the word of God this is truth does it say that we're already healed is that what it's telling us yes so do you have is there any you know issues in your life with sickness I just showed you in the word of God that you're already healed do you struggle with peace in your life and the devil brings the oppression and the torment of the minds right here I'm telling you by the word he already bore that chastisement for your peace do you deal with condemnation or guilt or or something in your heart when the devil is just really tearing you apart right here he already paid the price for your transgressions it's settled now you as people intellectually as reasonable human beings you can say that is the word of God we've seen it in the word of God we've read it in the word of God but if it stays right there you will never see the supernatural released that's right now this is a good start you start with saying that is true and I believe it but this right here won't perform the supernatural but you keep holding on to that Lord I believe your word Lord I believe your word praise the Lord for healing me like oh John blind John Ryan praise the Lord for healing me it was 30 days later he was still testifying praise the Lord for healing me praise the Lord for healing me and all of a sudden one day after about 30 days that word that had been given him dropped from his mind down into his heart and sitting in that barber chair he testified one more time praise the Lord for healing me and it struck home it made it made contact and he leaped out of that chair ran out the door with his eyes wide open because it had become a reality in his heart he didn't know how to take hold of Faith that's what the prophet tells him he didn't know how to take a hold of Faith so he just told him you just keep testifying you keep confessing the word you just keep saying it and one of these days it's going to drop down on the inside now I I've looked into a little bit of like Business Development stuff like that and and one of the things they get into is is this self-help program where they talk about affirmations all right and this is a is dealing with psychology and things like this and and they get in there and they stand in front of the mirror and they say I am a successful businessman I am this I am this and they start saying all of these positive things about them because they have found in-depth studies that prove if you'll stand there and you'll confess something it starts to do something in your life amen it starts to make something happen they don't really know how it works but they know something happens and so they tell people you just stand there and you start telling yourself positive things and you start speaking positive things because there's a power in it well they might not know how it works but we do know how this works we know that when you confess something with your mouth there is a power in your spoken word never let your confession be negative never let a negative word come out of your mouth let it always be positive because there is a Power released when you speak and if you will speak and confess this word of God you will begin to see the word of God coming into reality because when you speak something there's a party that begins to believe it if you'll say it again a little bit more of you begin to believe it and these people they'll just say these affirmations in front of the mirror until finally they really believe what they're saying now that might get you only so far in business but if you confess this word of God and believe it with all your heart it'll take you into eternity friends not your faith it's God's faith God comes down and he places in you faith is a is a confidence you have faith in your wife your husband you have confidence in them you trust them there's a trust there's a confidence in a person that you have faith in them you have an assurance in that individual [Music] and when you have this Faith this confidence not in your neighbor not in your friend not in your government but faith and a confidence and almighty God it releases the power of God into your life here uh in red ramp says this was a living faith I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God that had given him life and kept him living in Christian victory [Music] faith is a revelation all right now I'd really like some more Revelation can you give me some you know you can give me an idea you can explain something intellectually but you can't give me a revelation I can't give you revelation where does revelation come from God Alone and so friends we should pray for revelation more than anything else faith is a revelation from God that's what I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's give to you by the grace of God God reveals it to you through faith therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon the revelation you can't understand it you can't explain it it is a divine revelation that is given to you by God because you've been such a faithful church member is that what he was saying no because you know you you wear modest apparel therefore God gives you Faith because no it's Grace it's Grace that gives you faith not your merits not how good you've been it's the grace of God that comes down and Reveals His word into your heart and gives you a confidence and Assurance of faith in that word that will bring it into a reality some time ago I was out uh in Arizona and uh I was out for an afternoon or an evening walk I was preaching the next day and so I really like to just go walking out in the in the hills and just meditate on the things of the Lord and just look up at the the stars and and it was a full moon it was just a beautiful beautiful night out there so I went out in the Hills there and there happened to be a a bit of a storm that was coming up and so all these clouds came blowing in and now I was marching there through the woods and or the cactuses in the dark and uh I didn't have any light and when you're in the middle of nowhere without a light at night with a bunch of cactuses and rocks around it can be a little challenging and so there's a particular way you have to walk if you're in a place like that and you do these high steps where you're you're feeling each footstep you're feeling your way along and it's very slow it's very painstaking trying to make sure I wasn't gonna hit something you're watching out of your peripheral vision because it picks up light a little bit better that way and and you're just really working your way through and every now and again there'd be a little Gap in the clouds and a little bit of Starlight would come through and you could make better time and but it was really challenging now in my pocket I had my cell phone which had a flashlight on it but my phone was at like two percent battery and so I was saving that for you know an extra special moment and and so I was just waiting trying to find my way along and and eventually I started to hear this Creek flowing I'm like there's no Creek out here what what is that you know and I could hear it was like flowing so I'm working my way along and so I'm like I'm just gonna cut down on the edge of this hill here and see if I can find out what that was and I started looking and I seen up against the the skyline was this high transmission power lines and uh there was these this these power lines there's so much energy flowing through there it was actually bursting with electricity there was Sparks that would pop off of there and it was just there was like a a static a humming sound but I thought it was water flowing it's how much as power was there in those high transmission power lines there's something like 300 000 volts of electricity flowing through there it's extremely charged and yet my phone was still going dead I was next to enough power to light up the entire state and I was still in darkness [Music] my phone had you know technology on it that could turn on a flashlight and I'm right there next to thousands hundreds of thousands of volts electricity that could you know more than charge my phone it was plenty of power there and yet I still was in darkness why because I mean well is it because that electricity just had stopped working no the power was there it was there and it was looking for an opportunity to release itself if there gets you can even have a fire if you'll have a fire underneath those areas the smoke will come up and it'll make just enough of a connection that you'll have a bolt of lightning come out of those high transmission power lines and make contact with the ground it's looking for any opportunity to release that power but it operates under a law and if you don't operate according to that law you won't get one you won't even get the tiniest little spark out of that electrical system you have to operate with that power according to the law that governs it faith is exactly the same way that electricity will light up if you'll work according to the law of electricity but I could stand there and I could shout and I could jump and I could scream and I could yell at that power system it was not going to do a thing but if I'll operate according to the law of that electricity it's just about unlimited friends and the potential and so I had to stumble along and feel my way until I finally got back to a pathway and I got on that path when I went to the house and I went to the house and I took a a charger and I plugged it into the wall and I plugged the cord into my phone and that charger went into the wall it went to the electrical lines it went through the electrical lines to the to the meter at the house and went from there to a transfer station where it's been the energy is converted down because there's so much power there it would destroy my phone if it was connected to it it couldn't handle that amount of power it there you couldn't you couldn't contain it it would destroy you but there's a law that operates it that comes it down brings it down brings it through a Transformer until I was actually able to access and tap into the very same power that was over there and get it on my phone so I could turn on my light and you know you have you'll have needs in your life but if you try and approach it just through you know emotion or or Screaming or yelling or jumping around that's not going to release that power now once you make contact with that power there might be some emotion that comes with it you know um like uh if I had that shot caller right Hudson you know the kids were having some fun with this little shock collar you know and and uh you you put your fingers on it and then you push the button and it zaps you you know and they're raising the level up a little higher and a little higher and feeling it and you know and if we put that on brother Amos this morning and suddenly in church we just hit the button I'm expecting a reaction friends he might jump in the air he might let out a shout he might let out a holler something might happen everybody else might look at him like what is wrong with brother Amos today well the answer to that is friends if you were experiencing what he was experiencing you'd probably have a similar reaction because he came in contact with a power and that power had about a nine volt battery in it and you can't tell me that when you come into contact with my omnipotent God and you get a connection with him that there's not going to be a reaction there's not going to be something that takes place there is going to be a reaction there's going to be a Power released and you might look a little funny you might look a little bit strange but if they were experiencing what you were experiencing they might be doing the exact same thing that you're doing now the only way that a church can be built and the only way that a man can have faith is not by his denomination not by his affiliation but his faith rests upon not the Theology of some man's ideas because it's more or less altogether man but the only way faith can find its solemn resting places upon the immovable and unchangeable word of God the word of God is where you find your anchoring place that is where Faith makes that connection and it's not faith in a man it's not faith in in in in you know your own ideas your own thinking it's faith in the word that is where Faith Finds Its resting place nothing can ever change that Faith think of that you're anchored and you're no more for change for Time and Eternity you're anchored forever now faith is subconscious faith is something that you don't actually think about somewhere down in here the same way that you don't think about blinking your eyes or taking a breath it's the same way faith is it's in that subconscious realm something you don't have to think about um if if you didn't have the faith you couldn't get up out of your chair right now if you didn't have the faith you couldn't take a step you couldn't do it and that might sound strange but you know I was in a situation one time where uh we were with some friends and I went to this this Creek out in Arizona on this this Gorge and about a 20-foot drop off of some rocks into the water and uh so everybody's jumping off the rocks and diving into the water you know and so you know I've done it before and it's really fun so I was like oh I'm gonna do that too and I'm like and I go over and look at that I'm like that's kind of a long ways down so I I'm like okay I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I told myself I'm gonna do it I said I'm gonna do it and I'd run up to that and my feet would literally stop why why I couldn't do it I'm like I get there and and I couldn't take one measly little step why I just didn't have the confidence I didn't have the Faith No it's not common sense I didn't have the I didn't have the faith to take a step and I'm like I'm looking I see my friends jumping off it looks fun I've done stuff like this before I know it's going to be great but until I got that faith it took me like 15 minutes of sitting there before I finally had enough faith to pick up my foot in Step six inches and then I screamed all the way down and went up and did it again but if you don't have the faith or something you can tell yourself I'm going to do this I'm going to take this step if you don't have faith that won't happen yeah this light switch right here when you turn on a light switch it's an Act of Faith you don't think about it you just say I need light and so you uh see okay this one controls right here great just finding out about this church so and you need lights up here you just walk over and you flip that switch you don't think about it you'll just walk by in passing just make a swipe at those switches and you turn them on and you expect it to work you have total confidence that it'll work have you ever turned on a light switch and a light didn't turn on anybody had that happen did you decide that the days of Miracles were passed you know I got a little something here um so you know if you take a power source and you plug it in to this promise of God it's going to produce if you'll take Faith and the faith is that that switch all right so right here on the back of this light there's a switch right here and that makes the connection between this the individual and the power source and now God has a way he has a law he has things in order there there's a there's an established way these things have to be done and so if we come over here and we make this connection you know we get that one lined up maybe your motives and objectives are right you start getting things lined up according to the word of God you start getting these things there now if you take this and you're like okay you know I've got Faith Lord and I'm going to plug it into this man no that's not going to work this is not the source there might be power in there but it's not going to work I can hear right now this speaker's running I can hear it I can hear the volume I know there's power here but if I try and plug into this speaker I will get absolutely nothing even though it has power in it it's not the source that's right that's right you can't you can't place your faith in a pastor you should have confidence in the man but he is not the answer he is not the one you are placing your confidence in but if you'll go to the source there's power in that Pastor because he's connected to the source at least ways in this church there's there is a connection to the source in that man of God but that is not where you plug in that's not where you get your faith you take the faith and you take it and you plug it into well we'll put it in this one because there's another chord there you know that's a good thing to do is see how it worked for someone else now we have the power here we've made the connection we know what the word says we've got it all here now it comes down to one little flick of the finger in which we turn that switch of faith now what do you think is going to happen I hope so I really don't know how this chord works I don't know if that Outlet's a live Outlet sometimes you run into dead Outlets but you know what if I flip that switch and it doesn't turn on I'm not going to repent of this message no way I'm gonna say there's something wrong with the outlet I'm going to say there's something wrong with that breaker I'm going to go on and check that breaker because I know oh I know friends that there is power there and I that you know you can have a break in the line you can have a break at the break the breaker box it might break the connection there you might have your meter and you might not have paid your bill and that meter might be turned off but I know there is power at the source I know there is power at the main station and if I can get a connection from right here all the way to that main station I will have that release of power for my desire right here this morning and so if I flip this switch and it did not produce the results I would say let's go to the breaker let's find the brake where's that sin where's that separation what's causing this disconnect because I know this power works and so this morning we're gonna flip that switch and yeah it turns on the power is here I have not the slightest shadow of a doubt that we have met the requirements to bring electricity into this room foreign oh you're not plugging this power source into a denominational system you're not plugging it into your human reasoning you're not you could sit here and you could reason all day about how good electricity is but if you don't plug it in you will never get the results [Applause] oh friends how confident are you that if I flip this switch it's going to turn on I mean your confidence level gets really high because we've proved that it's from here to here to here and if it's getting to there why wouldn't it hit there you know for several years my wife struggled with postpartum depression she got into a place of just darkness over her suicidal Spirits just troubling her just fear and torment of the Mind it was a very very dark place those things are real friends depression come to a place to see where brother ran him tried to commit suicide twice because of the darkness he was feeling the depression he was under and Satan came and he just began to torment her mind until she was just lost in the Darkness but one day my rod came down he set her free and God led her out of that darkness and brought her into the light and if he did it for this one he'd do it for the next one and I had a my friend my brother-in-law now Nathan Eric we were at a gathering of young people we were just sitting around fellowshipping about the Lord and talking about how wonderful he was and about his promises I was probably 18 or 19 years old and as we were felishing about these things we with somebody said well why don't you pray for what will you pray for my needs and they said my parents they aren't serving the lord they haven't been to church in I don't know like 15 years she says I've been going to church by myself and and so we said we're going to pray for you and we we gathered around and we just prayed a prayer with our sister that God would give her her chill her her family her mom and dad she said sometimes I have to stand at the door of my house and or my bedroom and I say Satan you might be able to have that place out there but this is my room and I tell you you cannot come in here we prayed with her and a prophecy went out through tongues and interpretations that God would give her her family I think it was close to maybe nine or ten years for that family walked into the church and God answered that prayer well when that when that word came forth there was such an anointing of faith and of love friends that that was the most Supernatural experience of love I've ever been in and through that I seen the most Supernatural things take place that night we began to gather around and pray for one another and there was about 10 or 12 of us in that little room and there was about 40 other people at the rest of the building and when they heard that shouting and screaming and speaking in tongues happening in that room they says everybody get quiet and start praying we want to get into what's going on in there and so after a while they opened up a big sliding door and and my brother Nathan brother-in-law Nathan he was the first one he says brothers and sisters I have a need and and we just poured out of that little room and we came out and we gathered around him and we began to say what would you desire brother and he says well I've got this this injury in my wrists she says I I played the piano and Something's Happened it was like a carpal tunnel type thing he says I can't play anymore he says I'm just passing into pray for me and we laid our hands on him and while we were there praying a vibration is began to pulsate up and down his wrists and he's never been troubled with that before again I had we had friends there that this this prayer meeting went on for I don't know four or five hours a group of young people Supernatural after Supernatural after Supernatural took place I had one friend he was just Bound by a depression and arthritis he had arthritis all through his body and he was just bound down but the thing that was really holding was that depression and he was he was literally on the ground like this trying to stand up and it was like he was under 100 pound weight and he's just struggling to stand up and he finally stands up and he's just like please for me and Satan was trying to hold him down for everything he was worth to keep him from standing up and calling on the children of God to pray for his need and finally he pushed through that he pressed through that he says pray for me we gather around and we prayed over him and God broke that power of depression off of his life he has never been troubled by arthritis again from that day God he healed him God set him free testimony after testimony of the supernatural God and there was just in that atmosphere of that love that was there for one another in that atmosphere of faith it was just like whatever you want if you have need of something just ask the power is here we just seen this brother who was hurting the ax in a car accident with his back pain for years and he just testified a couple of minutes ago that back pain just left his back we know God's here we know the Supernatural is happening so why wouldn't you ask for something hey so friends we asked and we asked and we asked until many of us couldn't walk anymore we were you know there's a virtue that goes with that and we were just just gathered around and just incredible the things that God did that night was the night I began to recognize the voice of God speaking to my heart he would he would give me a prayer to pray for someone and I could not get away from that voice until I would answer that prayer and pray over that person that particular way and just began to be sensitive and things and and I got home from that I was driving back from the airport and all of a sudden I realized I've been so busy praying for everybody that night that I never asked for anything myself I was just like I mean I could have had anything absolutely anything no no bars hold like anything was possible I was like man what an opportunity and I missed that opportunity and so as I was there I'd been in a snowboarding accident and I made a mistake and and hit my edge of my board into the ground probably 30 40 miles an hour and just slammed right into my shoulder very high speed and it had just it injured my shoulders severely I I think were you there Daniel Were You There When I had that injured shoulder up there in Arizona when we went skiing I remember you were pulling on my shoulder in the car I think trying to pop it back in the socket or whatever was wrong with it it was painful and it got to where I could only raise my shoulder up about this far and and it would just bind and the pain would be there and and that was all I could do and I was like man what could I have asked for and I thought of that injury I was like I could have been healed of that shoulder could have been healed if I'd had just asked as I was driving down the road passing by Carefree exit in Phoenix Arizona a voice came to that car instead I am still the same God [Music] and I said then I accept my healing right now in the name of Jesus Christ and you know what friends I went everywhere I testified I told about what God had done there and what God had done for me and I felt not one tiny bit different but there wasn't it wasn't a hope so France it wasn't a maybe so I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if he said I could have it then I had it and I testified for months and finally one time I was up in Canada and I was testifying up there and I also didn't realize that shoulder hasn't bothered me in a long time and that word had become a reality in my life but friends if God would do that for my wife if he'd do that for a group of young people if he would do that for me if he would do that why wouldn't he do it for you he's the god of the supernatural how many of you here could raise a hand and say I was healed of this or this or this raise your hand how many of you have made contact with that God and seen him heal you and do Supernatural seeing you deliver you from things you couldn't get out of seeing you do you know what I'm talking about and I'm telling you if he would do it for one the power's here we've made contact all you've got to do is switch that little switch right here and we'll release the power to you it's not a maybe so it's not a hope so if God will do it for you if he did it for this one if he did it for that one why wouldn't he do it again [Music] absolutely he will praise the Lord you know when you begin to share those testimonies you begin to feel that Faith just beginning to pulsate you begin to realize we serve a God that's real we serve a god that is is present we serve a god that is a a living reality here in our midst you recognize that thing that's bothering me it might not be here at the end of service you recognize that promise I've been holding on to it could be the day that that's going to be released and I'm going to be free from that thing but Rams speaking to this people in Chicago he starts says you know there's a what's the matter with your people here he says you really have wonderful Faith he says I can feel it but here's what you're afraid of you're afraid to turn that Faith loose since you're afraid to turn that face lewd you lose you're afraid to act your faith don't do that faith without works is dead don't be that feeling of Faith that's pulsating through this room right now don't be afraid of that don't be afraid of that pulsation of faith in your heart you act on that Faith you give you you let that just have its way in you and you let God come down and make himself real the Rams in a prayer line and this woman comes up and she's got deafness and he says the woman coming to me prayed for this deafness she's deaf I could feel that there's a deaf Spirit on the woman and you listen very closely what he says here there's a deaf Spirit on that woman right here setting before me now and it knows what's the it that deaf spirit that demonic Spirit that's holding that woman captive it knows something it knows that woman has Faith also it's perhaps going to have to leave just in a moment you know why those Devils began screaming you know why when that Faith would begin to raise and they begin to see the supernatural God present those demons will begin screaming out for help because they realize the possibility they recognize you know what Branson bright Ransom right Branson's got faith in his heart there is a possibility that I'm gonna lose my hold on him just any moment because there's a possibility that he might make contact with the supernatural God right now do you realize the devil realizes friends the possibility of this meeting this morning but do you do you realize the possibility the devil has a there's a fear on the devil there is a nervousness on the devil he is afraid of the possibility of what could happen here this morning and so he's doing everything he can he's calling out to this Spirit over here and that Spirit over there don't let him break loose Devil's screaming for help trying not to lose control because if that Faith Breaks Loose every person could walk out of here healed set free and receiving the promise of God walking in Victory because faith is the victory you know Mom I'm running longer than I thought you know some time ago I had a dream maybe a couple weeks ago and uh I wouldn't call it a spiritual dream although it had a spiritual principle that I just really enjoyed um I kind of dream is kind of like a I don't know it's like an adventure dream or something like that you know things are always very entertaining in there and and so we were going along in this particular dream and and there was a group of people and we were trying to get through all these like obstacles and they were kind of like maybe if you've ever been in an escape room something like that like all these puzzles and trying to break through these barriers and trying to get through and and there was this guy this guy that was there that was kind of like holding us captive in a way and we were like breaking through all the barriers and we're getting through and finally we get through to the to the main Central Area we we got through everything and we get there and uh there was this being sitting on a throne there and he was a being of Darkness he had uh he was a mentor I think or something like that a very ugly creature and so this devil was there and we're looking at them we're like so you're the one that's been causing all these obstacles you're the one that's been trying to place all these barriers here and so we kind of made the connection here and it's like oh man you know this is not a good guy and uh and he begins to speak and he says there was a sister uh standing next to me a younger girl and and he says you used to serve me he says You Belong To Me he says you can never escape from me and I looked over and I said you know sister Diana you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior right she's like yes I says you believe the Lord Jesus Christ and you've given your heart to him he says yes I have and so I stepped in between that devil there on on that throne and that girl and I said Satan he says you listen to me you have no power or authority over her she does not belong to you she is a daughter of God and then I I spoke those words I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and something happened that I can't explain it but it was like a million tons of bricks struck onto that that creature on his throne and it completely obliterated into a giant hole in the ground there was nothing left it was just an Unstoppable force that came striking down with those words of rebuke in the name of Jesus Christ and I woke up and I was just like that's awesome that's what it does like I got to see the impact of the word of the faith in the name of Jesus Christ I got to see the impact of what that does to the devil why don't we use that a little more often friends why don't we release that blast word that will just disintegrate Satan and then the other day I found this quote and I just couldn't couldn't uh I got pretty excited about it brother Branham says here demons will tremble and sinners awake faith in Jehovah makes anything Shake amen makes the kingdom of the devil crumble and fall turn them big blast words on thus saith the Lord that Atomic word of God flies out there and just disintegrates Satan's kingdom we have been given an atomic blast words we have been given a word that is a sure word and we need to be using it friends when you come up against an enemy when you come up against the devil don't just sit there and say well I'm sorry I Disturbed you no rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ we have been given Atomic blast words you've got different situations I've got different situations but the word has an answer for that situation and you go to that word and you say thus saith the Lord the doctor says I'm going to die but God says I'm going to live the doctor says this but the word says this you begin to take and you find the word for your situation and you release those atomic blast words we'll disintegrate Satan his kingdom we can have a perfect faith in a perfect word sermon perfect faith I really encourage you to go home and listen to that it's powerful he says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing Ascender of the Soul and Spirit of the joints and of the marrow and it is a discerner of their thoughts and intents of the heart the word made flesh now right here I'm hearing him speaking of that son of man Ministry that Vindication that it was God himself that was coming here to give us a word the word operating in human flesh by physical signs by Mysterio Signs by scriptural signs perfectly to bring you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture now you can't have confidence if we had an imperfect word but we don't we have a perfect word and thereby we can have a perfect faith for a perfect rapture now I don't know if if your church is like this but I reckon it probably is do you hear a lot about vindication about a Vindicated word about a Vindicated Prophet you know some people get to be like well we've heard that we've heard that yeah well it's there's a reason you're hearing it it's because it's really important that you recognize the Vindication of the word for the hour that you're in Satan has had great success in exalting himself above the sons of God in each age by getting the people of that age not to Value the promised word for their age now Vindication uh if anybody here been skydiving Miss Universe skydiving haven't been all right what about you brother no body here been skydiving well me neither but um if we were going skydiving this morning who here would want to go skydiving okay all right all right we got a few of us I'd like to go too never had the opportunity but uh somebody here was going skydiving anyway so if we were going skydiving this morning all right and we get to the to the skydiving you know unit the class there and the guy comes in and he brings out your parachute he says here you go here's your parachute you know put it on how many of you would jump out of a plane 40 000 feet up in the air with one of these on of course not you're not going to trust your your trust in your life to this if I get on an airplane one of these days which I might do I might not I don't know might grow up but if I were to get on an airplane and they were going to give me a parachute I'd want to be positive right that it had been proven I'd want to know that it was a certified guaranteed parachute that was promised that it will not fail you it doesn't work 50 of the time it works 100 of the time I'd want a Vindicated parachute friends and if the guy comes out and he hands me the parachute he's like okay yeah he said I just started work here yesterday here's your parachute uh hold on give me a second it says to pull you know you put that part around no no um oh no it goes this way over here are you gonna jump out of a plane when that guy tells you to jump out of the plane there's no way you're gonna want to see some certifications you're going to want to see he's like don't worry I've done this 3 000 jumps already you know I've got you know 20 000 flight hours whatever he's gonna give you he's going to give you some certifications he's going to show you the the qualifications he has for telling you to jump out of a plane and fall for thousands of feet yeah you're going to want a Vindicated parachute and you're going to want a Vindicated parachute instructor friends and you know what that's just for your natural life what we're talking about is your soul God didn't just throw us something and say here put this on and not give us any confidence in whether or not it worked he sent us a Vindicated message by a Vindicated prophet he says and if you will rest your soul on this it will bring you into eternity it will take you into a Rapture it'll change the very fibers of your body if you'll hold on to this Vindicated word [Music] we have a Vindicated message by a Vindicated Prophet it's not a hope so it's not a maybe so it's not a might be and God took painstaking efforts to vindicate this Prophet so you could have a perfect faith in this perfect word for a perfect rapture Abraham says here who then will have the power of infallibility you know what infallibility means never wrong who then will have the power of infallibility it's a parachute that doesn't just work 50 of the time France the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last stage for this last stage is going to go back to manifesting the peer word bride that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the sign we can have a real faith we can have a confidence that goes beyond any mortal realm we can have an assurance that goes beyond because we can see Vindication thousands of vindications of this prophetic ministry again and again and again so that there is no excuse there's not the slightest shadow of a doubt we know we have received a Vindicated message by a Vindicated prophet thank you and as he said in perfect faith and so when a man lives by faith we we have the opportunity now to access substance Faith reality faith we have the opportunity right now to access a faith like has never been seen before it's a rapturing faith and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material you'll see you're getting into rapturing condition now what's what's he say about the rapturing condition substance Faith reality faith not a hope so not a maybe so but a no-so not something that you think might work you have been thoroughly satisfied I'm not getting on that plane until I'm thoroughly satisfied that it's a Vindicated parachute it's a Vindicated instructor until I'm satisfied I'm not getting on but friends I have been satisfied I have been satisfied about the authority of this word in this hour I have been satisfied that it is the saith the Lord and I have taken flight already I'm already up there friends and just any minute now when they push me out that door I'm not going down I'm going up this is a rapturing message I have received a rapturing faith it is coursing through my heart and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it will produce what it said it will do if I'll just keep on walking if I'll just stay faithful I'll just keep walking with the word I'm gonna it might feel natural it might feel human but if the prophet said for me to live this way then that's the way I'm going to live if the prophet said to walk around Jericho one more time then that's what I'm going to do because I have been thoroughly satisfied that it is under the Divine word of God We are following a Vindicated message that was given directly by the captain of the host of the Lord and that Captain has never lost a battle [Applause] I am satisfied if my wife would come to the piano here this morning I want to look at one last last thing here been talking about faith to walk do you have that face to walk maybe you got a Mustard Seed Faith maybe you got quite a few mustard seeds worth of faith maybe you got a whole barrel full I don't know I don't see your heart I can tell your faith is in this room though hey you know one day there was a man who broke every scientific law he broke through the barriers of science because the word told him he could do it Ram says Peter he was doing all right until he got scared the word told him he could walk on the water the word told him you can walk on the water you can walk through the fire you can go through this sickness you can make it through this situation the word told him to walk and he walked anybody here ever walked on H2O before we have no record of anybody ever doing this again nobody ever doing this before this is unprecedented but a man hears a word that came from the mouth of somebody that had been Vindicated and he jumped out of that boat and he walked on the water that's impossible you can't do that but he did that [Music] and he stepped out of that boat and he went walking and and says here [Music] he was scared at first he thought it was a ghost He said Lord if it's you bid me come to you on the water he said come on now that's just the same as James 5 14 the same as Mark 16 the same God said it come on so he started walking and he done all right got down out of the ship and started walking on there was a storm there white caps terrifying experience and he allowed fear to slip in Jesus said come on he stepped down and he said it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared what come in his mind first thing I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he looked at well he looked at his symptoms he looked out there and he seen them big waves and he got scared and what what when he did down he went what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed got scared of his belief then his substance left him he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance substance would have went right over the top of that y cap and went right on to him if he has the perfect Faith see but he didn't have it he thought he did he did at first that's what I want to focus on right there he did at first he was willing to venture right out why the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he just stepped right out of the boat and takes off he never thought about the ways how contrary there was he never got that in his mind [Music] hey he walked on the water at first because he had perfect Faith at first then he got into his mind this isn't reasonable the doctor said this this isn't reasonable the situation is beyond control there's no way that this is ever going to change he started to get into his mind down he went [Music] friends I believe there's many different times in our life we've been in the presence of God we've been in the atmosphere of of the presence of God and something comes down and God speaks into our heart I pray today God spoke something into your heart and it hits you and something inside of you just rose up and said Lord I believe when you do that you're stepping out of the boat and you're walking on the water you have a perfect Faith you have a perfect assurance and you begin to walk on that water you begin to make steps one step at a time straight towards the Lord Jesus Christ you're moving and you're in the middle of a supernatural event you're in the middle of an absolutely miraculous thing it's just walking but it's absolutely Supernatural but then how long did Peter Walk On The Water France how long did he have perfect faith 10 seconds 30 seconds I mean it wasn't that long [Music] you had that perfect Faith at first and then he allowed that question to become in down he went I know I believe so many times we're in the middle of something God's doing God speaks to our heart Brother Sam right he speaks throughout our heart and he tells us something and that Faith just engages and it connects and maybe it's that Mustard Seed Faith maybe it's a great big perfect faith and them Supernatural begins to take place you step out of that boat and you start walking don't stop don't think about anything else you're already in the middle of a miracle friend you're already in the middle of a supernatural God doing Supernatural things you are doing what is impossible and you're there don't stop don't question don't look to the right hand don't look to the left you are in the middle of a miracle right then just keep walking just keep walking don't look at the wave don't look at the storm look at Jesus Christ the one who told you to walk look at Jesus Christ the one who gave you the promise and keep on walking just keep on walking you're already in the middle of a miracle I don't know your situation I don't know what what you're dealing with in your life
