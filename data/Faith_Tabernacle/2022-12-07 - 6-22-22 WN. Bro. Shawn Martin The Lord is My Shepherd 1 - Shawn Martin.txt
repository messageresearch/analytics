of Psalms the 23rd chapter and just read the first verse we're all familiar with it okay and I guess it's used quite often at funerals but I think it is very very applicable to us who are alive amen it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one amen let's just go to the Lord in prayer father truly we need you this evening more than we ever have before father you have made it Lord through our lives as we grow older we're learning more of you the Lord you're making it to where we become more needy and father how we feel that way this evening and we just asked that you would come Among Us and just take what simple words we have Lord and just minister to your people pray that you would help me just to get myself out of the way Lord and may you anoint the years in the hearts of your people this evening oh God we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you can have your seats this evening we want to remember brother Josh Bennett's meeting that is starting tomorrow night through Sunday and so if any of you are able to go I know you'll be blessed by the ministry that will be there and I think brother Ron Spencer brother Wayne Lawson and brother Jonathan and then brother I think brother Josh Martin's be ministering the Saturday morning youth service and so I I know you'll be blessed and also we want to keep brother Andrew in our prayers to be traveling tomorrow or Thursday or something to that effect tomorrow Friday to Florida and so um he's um me doing a four night meeting and and so we wanted to just um uh pray for him as well but uh tonight I just have a a simple thought and that's just the Lord is my shepherd it's it's a simple thought but it's a profound to the believer and really it's it's a it's a a statement that would perplex the world uh because they don't know the the Lord as their Shepherd but today God has been many things uh in the world has made him uh many many things he's been made that way a mascot an Aaron boy and a god of convenience the god of Showmanship and these things and he's been made everything that he really isn't to be he that's not what he is and but David recognizes the Lord to to be his Shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and and I looked up the Amplified and and he he puts there the Lord is my shepherd to feed to guide and to Shield and now god holds that responsibility he's the one that puts himself in that responsibility and David has just come to know what the Lord is to him and that is a Shepherd one that would feed the guide to Shield this shows the special relationship that David has with God and that God has with David there's no struggling to be leader there's no there's no animosity between David and God there's there's not no friction there as to David's will trying to overcome God's will it's just a simple acknowledgment a recognition that that David has and that is the Lord is my shepherd and so David in other words knew his place and he was content with it there was no contention there David had come to be satisfied that he was the lamb and that God was the leader God was the shepherd and by studying sheep the prophet says that we can learn we can learn about us we can learn about our nature because now not not talking of worldly nature carnal nature but when you you get the Holy Ghost and you you come into the body of Believers then you take on a nature and the nature that you would take on is the nature of a sheep in in in in uh one way and so we learn about our nature as Christians by studying uh sheep and the prophet said one thing that we learn from a sheep is is that when the weather is really hot sheep won't separate themselves but instead they will all Stand Together and he says they do that to make shade for each other he says they're having Fellowship and he says now it would be good if all God sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere if all God's Little Sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shade of each other the Comfort to lean upon each other he said now someone would say now is that necessary brother Branham it is certainly it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good Dependable friend that when the troubles are blazing the heat's on you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them and talk it over in personal confidence and then kneel down and prayed together and know that this person is a good god-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in oh it's good to do that come let us reason together set the scripture or come and let us Stand Together and so then he goes on that even in the times of in the north when the blizzards are really uh prevalent and and it's freezing cold and and you can barely see and the winds are blowing that snow all around he says those little sheep he said they may be on one side of the hill but they'll come running and they'll meet up with all the other sheep and they'll huddle together to keep warm they're going to keep each other warm ain't that right because of the heat of their body and he says I think when the church gets real cold and indifferent God's sheep ought to huddle together and pray for each other and the warmth of real good Christian Fellowship all it means so much God spoke of it in or David spoke of it in the first Psalm and said blessed is the man that saareth not in the seat of the scornful or standeth in the way of the Sinners but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in the law does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the river of water and his Leaf shall not wither for whatsoever he doeth shall prosper ain't that right now then then he goes on to say now you know if he said if you're going out for a picnic and he describes his country how hot it gets in the summertime and you want to go on a picnic and it's really hot he says you you need shade he said you want some shade you ain't gonna go sit out in the sun you know you want shade but he said you want to know that you're not just sitting under a twig that someone just set out there and it may be Shady right now you know but it ain't got no roots it ain't got nothing he said but you want to know that you come back next year it's going to be planted is that that tree's still going to be there ain't that right and so he says see uh you got to have confidence in that shade that you're you're you're you're you're you're coming under he said but you go to where the big old stately Oak stands where the trials and temptations and The Swinging of the limbs back and forth and back and forth has moved that old tree till them roots are way down deep in the ground and you can pretty well believe she'll still be standing there and he said that's the way I like now tonight now he's talking about getting together and the kind of getting together right he said that's the way I like is to get an old God uh God's safe Saint that's weathered the storm and their roots are still holding deep in the love of God what it means to get a person like that and have a little time of Fellowship it means so much ain't that right so so you can learn from sheep another thing that sheep is is is a sacrificial animal and um uh you know which there's nothing helpless as a sheep ain't that right nothing and David being a Shepherd in the natural uh watching his father sheep he he understood that the nature of sheep he knew understood the relationship that a Shepherd would have with the sheep and and and and and the the importance of sheep having a shepherd and and and sheep have to have a shepherd ain't that right we have to have a shepherd and so they're they're the most the prophet said they're the most helpless creatures in the world when they are lost and when a sheep is lost it'll just stand there and bleed and bleat and bleed stand there until it dies except the other sheep could be 100 300 yards away and but that sheep has lost its direction and in instead of getting its senses it's it's helpless it can't yet its senses and so it needs the shepherd to lead it back to the fold hey ain't that right and so if if the shepherd doesn't get to it in time then a predator will come and a wolf or a coyote or whatever and take advantage of the helplessness of this sheep and so it must have a Shepherd to lead it ain't that right and so we know from David that a Shepherd is a protector of the Sheep amen David experienced it one time as he tells the story to King Saul of of how that the bear come and try to get a lamb and he took the lamb from the the flock and and then a lion came in and took a lamb from the flock and but he says I went after that I went after them and and God gave Grace and I was able to rescue them from the mouth of the lion and the mouth of the bear what a Shepherd we need ain't that right a Shepherd that is willing and able because David going after the something that was mighty uh like a lion or a bear he was actually willing to lay his life down for that sheep which was a type of Christ ain't that right and so brother Branham would tell us that he says that the Sheep is the most helpless thing there is there's nothing so insufficient of Defense than the Sheep think of that now that's what God Likens us and we have no defense we're just sheep ain't that right amen there's no insufficient of the uh there there's nothing so insufficient of Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but the Sheep stands helpless and if you notice God never Likens us as to a horse that can run never Likens us as to a lion that can roar and tear apart but he Likens us as sheep and you say man and and the prophet begins to pull out these characters of the sheep that are that we are liking to ain't that right amen that's right amen now I know that God Likens us unto Eagles but but but uh uh but an eagle is a predator but we find that uh uh God Likens us as to an eagle in different characters but we're speaking of a sheep and you say man a sheep uh that ain't uh going around killing that ain't out to devire that ain't we're just it's just a helpless creature that is in need of a Shepherd ain't that right so we are the people the the Bible says David says we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand uh Psalms 103 it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his past sure ain't that rhyme see so we we find that God Likens the prophet said he Likens his believing children unto sheep because they must be guided sheep must be guided and not just natural sheep but God's children must be guided can you say amen that's right see and so if if it's a necessity to be guided by somebody then you know that of course the devil is going to take take uh to try to take advantage of that uh uh of of that guiding ain't that right and and so the prophet would give out that warning be careful as to who guides you then you're going to be guided by something but be careful as to who or what guides you because see if if you're being led by a goat the prophet says every time that they want to take the Sheep to the slaughter they get a goat and that goat will take the Sheep to the slaughterhouse they'll get them up on that ramp and as soon as it gets right up into the gate that that that goat will jump off and and the Sheep just goes right on into the slaughter can you say man amen so the prophet says the goat will lead but you cannot lead him ain't that right so that's the nature of of a goat but the Sheep cannot lead the Sheep has to be led I I think sometimes we you know the world thinks Christians are dumb but in all reality we are in in in ways be because we we realize that we're not made to defend ourselves we're not made to just go out there and and and and and uh you know just whatever you want to call it you can't make life or make your way through life without a shepherd without a leader can you say man that that's just the way that God has made us to be now so it's the shepherd now the prophet said the shepherd must be very smart in order to tell the difference between the bleeding of a goat and the bleeding of a sheep because they sound alike ain't that right and so we find that Jesus said it'd be so close in this last day that it would actually deceive the elect if it was possible so then then we're seeing that Satan Works in a in a in a shrewd way very shrewd in trying to bring us into under his headship ain't that right under his headship and but but then you hear the Lord is my shepherd I think it's important for sheep to know who is their Shepherd not to be confused because as the as as we know throughout the Bible that that uh the shepherd the Sheep know their Shepherd can you say amen that's right when they're when they're when they're under a Shepherd amen the prophet says that the shepherd it stinks like the Sheep smells like the Sheep he's with the Sheep he he's with them all the time and and the moment you think that God is forsaken you you're wrong he's the shepherd [Music] ain't that right now the Lord is The Shepherd of every Son of God every daughter of God the Lord is the shepherd and and and the more we can realize that recognize that I think we'd be better off ain't that right now Romans 8 14 it says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God so you're going to be led the world is going to be led the the the the the uh man is being led there the world the churches they're being led to the World Council of churches ain't that right but the difference that makes the Son of God Stand Out is they are led by the spirit of God so the Lord is their Shepherd can you say man he's the king's Shepherd now notice what David being a lamb writes about the shepherd there in in um uh uh II Samuel 22 and 5 it says when the waves of death come past me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of hell can passed about me uh uh the snares of death prevent at me in my distress I called upon the Lord and cried to my God and he did hear my voice out of his Temple and My Cry did enter into his ears then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations of Heaven moved and shook because he the shepherd was Wrath ain't that right there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devired and coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet and he rolled upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the Wind Wings of the wind and he made his Darkness Pavilions round about him dark Waters and sick clouds of the sky and through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled the Lord thundered From Heaven and the most high uttered his voice and he sent out arrows and Scattered them lightning and discomforted them and the channels of the sea appeared and the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the Lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils he sent from above he took me and he drew me out of many water years he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my Calamity but the Lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me can you say man thank the god to have a Shepherd that Delights in you now I know this is simple but I know that we've all come to a place at some point or another to where that that that we've we've come to to places that we don't know what to do and and it looks like the enemy was going to overtake us but then we realize the Lord is Our Shepherd can you say Amen have you ever realized that in the most of times that you you just don't know it just looks like you ain't going to be able to go any further and then it just comes to recognition that God you are my son Shepherd and I am needing help I'm a lamb that is bleeding and you watch God come on the scene in your behalf yes sir see so our Lord uh the Shepherd that doesn't just sit back and let the enemy devour his sheep the enemy will not and cannot Devour the soul of God's sheep can you say amen amen amen he may be able to take them in death amen to where their body is just a spoonful of of dust or Spoonful Of Ashes but that Soul amen liveth and abideth forever can you say amen that's right that soul of God's sheep lives for eternally amen that's right and another thing that the devil cannot devour and that is the praise of God's Sheep amen and the worship that comes from the Sheep of God Amen he can never devour their love for their Shepherd he he will never be able to devour amen their faith in him can you say amen amen there's things about a believer that the devil cannot devour that the enemy can never destroy there's something about us a man that were in the shepherd's Hands Where where the apple of his eye we we are the people that he will move Heaven and Earth for we are the people that if there was no other people on the face of the Earth he still would have come and he would have went to Calvary just for one amen that's how much he loves his sheep can you say amen amen he's a Shepherd that will not forget us he's a Shepherd that will not just turn his back upon us he's a Shepherd that forever has us at his heart [Applause] you believe that the Lord is Our Shepherd now David named some of the benefits that come with the Lord being a shepherd and notice it's all in that verse I didn't read it but he says we shall not I'm going to put it in plural we shall not want or lack we are made to lie down not not not in desert places but in Green Pastures we are laid beside not the rumbling Waters you get around rumbling Waters of turrets or current and turmoils and and and where there's a strong current you're just scared to get around that water you're afraid to fall in but he leads us besides Steel Waters and our soul is restored do you believe that our soul is restored we are LED in the paths of righteousness for his namesake and notice his presence takes away all fear foreign as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we fear no evil for we realize that he is with us Hallelujah this is what we're walking in today is the valley of shadow of death ain't that right we are comforted by his rod and staff a table he is prepared for us in the presence of our enemies our head has been anointed and I I'd like to just take some some time in in and just go through all of this later Amen in in the services but a table is prepared for us in the presence of our enemy our head has been anointed our cup run is over now this is the benefits When the Lord is your Shepherd it just makes you want to be a sheep can you say Amen it just makes you want to turn it all over the Lord and let him fight your battles it just makes you just want to call out to him amen and in in the Despair and when it looks like it's all Bleak yet you still have a trust that is anchored because you realize he's your Shepherd and there ain't nothing going to touch the hair of your head it's just not goodness and mercy never leaves us we will dwell in the house of the Lord forever now if these if these benefits do not apply to you then you're not his sheep and he's not your Shepherd can you say Amen so then we have to settle it how many believes that the Lord is your Shepherd you really believe that the Lord is your Shepherd then then we understand these are benefits that we cannot say the Lord is Our Shepherd and then scratch out these benefits as though they belong to some other race of people or some other class or some other church or some other individual if the Lord is my shepherd it's a it's a personal Shepherd it's a personal relationship a personal faith a personal confidence and these benefits are attributed to me he's my shepherd and sheep follow their Shepherd this shows the relationship that and trust that sheep have in their Shepherd I've had you know different ones that I guess have sheep and they try to tell me well you know sheep is just bullheaded and they just this and they just that that's just the way we are brother Sean and I thought well when I read about sheep when the prophet talks about he never talks about any of that he puts that to goats but sheep have confidence in their Shepherd it's a relationship that has been built you know you hear the story of you know that you you see the shepherd the picture that Shepherd holding his lamp across his shoulders he got that rod and it's been said that when the Sheep a Little Lamb you know he just filling his oats and he just you know so he wants to stray he wants to have a good time he doesn't know the shepherd yet and the shepherd knows that there's enemies out there he knows the nature of that lamb he knows the lamb before the lamb knows itself and so he he pulls in that sheep that little lamb and the lamb just keeps going and finally the old Shepherd out of love he'll take that take that thing take his staff and he'll he'll he'll break that leg buddy you talking about looks like the the shepherd forsaken the the lamb but then it says that the the shepherd will take that lamb and it's bleeding and he just oh just fell off forsaken but the shepherd will take that lamb and he'll rest it upon the strong part of his body the shoulders and he carries that lamb everywhere he goes he sings to that lamb he talks to the lamb and what is happening is there's a bonding taking place between the shepherd and the lamb and the lamb is learning the voice of the shepherd ain't that right he's learning the voice of the shepherd and then when the leg heals and he's able to put that lamb down never again does that lamb wander the Lamb's right there by that Shepherd everywhere he goes and when the shepherd speaks he knows the voice can you say man now if that's in the natural so is it in the spiritual ain't that right we're we're a people that began to know our Shepherd right now I I thought of how they follow the shepherd and the relationship brother Branham talks about being in the in the Eastern country where you know at their food market they have all their food outside it's not like our grocery stores and people just travel you know walk all through there and I'm sure you've seen scenes and pictures or whatever of it but they have food just lined up out in the streets you know and and he says he was there and a Shepherd come bring in a sheep right starting to ride through all that and any thought my goodness this is going to be catastrophe them sheep going to smell that food and that's it you know the shepherd loses its control over the Sheep but he says as he watched all the cars stopped for the Sheep to go across and the shepherd went right through all of it and the Sheep would look at it but it stayed right with the shepherd He said not one of them touched that food they were following their Shepherd and he said oh if the people could understand my language I would have stopped the cars and preached a sermon of what I just saw that the Sheep stay with the shepherd can you say amen that's right they know the shepherd will feed them they know the shepherd will take care of them they're now out trying to defend themselves for themselves can you say amen that's right see so so then then the Sheep are Guided by The Shepherd's voice John 10 27 my sheep hear my voice my sheep hear my voice if a natural sheep can can fall in love with their Shepherd's voice and know their Shepherd's voice and and not get distracted by any other voice then cannot God sheep do the same if God would make a natural sheep to type out you and I and we see that they don't fail in that they know the shepherd's voice they're loyal to that Shepherd's voice then so is God's sheep loyal to his voice as well he said my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me now we know and again this is simple I know that the voice of God is the word of God the voice of God everybody say the voice of God is the word of God ain't that right so the word of God is our defense the word of God is our shelter our refuge it's it's a preserver of life ain't that right now Jeremiah 7 23 uh God uh speaks to Israel and saying obey my voice obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people ain't that right now that's the difference the thing is is Don't Be The Voice got it we ain't in Rodeo time we we've been rodeos when I was younger you know when they have them in Oklahoma and and you know uh uh my my nephew got he's he's a tough old boy you know y'all seen him I'm sure but uh uh you know he's just strong and he got in that competition you know I think it's a hundred dollars last guy that could stand in there without getting knocked out you know her chicken and he he he uh he's determined you know he's gonna last and that bull come running at him he stayed right there and that bull just plowed him man now I think it knocked him out but that's that that's not God in the Sheep if you want to be a bull then be the bull but you'll never be part of Gods you understand so obey my voice and I'll be your God and you shall be my people and won't ye in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well with you God has a way to to to to protect his sheep ain't that right obey my voice ain't that right so the great Shepherd makes himself known by his voice and brother Brown said we know it's the voice of God because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word it's one thing for a prophet to speak but it's another thing for that where to be backed up and then you know it's the voice of God ain't that right brother Brown said this is God's prophet and a true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with this Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it's the voice of God can you say Amen we now know what is the difference between just a theologian and God's voice we now know what is the difference between somebody that is just trying to to make something out of the scriptures and then God's voice can you say Amen not everybody that that preached from the Bible is God's voice not everybody that quotes scriptures is God's voice but we're understanding now that the voice of God is the manifestation of this word of God ain't that right and so now we find out amen that the prophet said there's so many voices in the Earth today now you'll you understand why there's going to be very few that make it in the rapture amen because the Rapture is connected with the voice of God and it is true because looking right look look in Revelations the fourth chapter after these things I Heard a Voice saying to me John come up hither brother said that was the Rapture the voice of God is connected with the rapture ain't that right but notice there's so many voices in the Earth today that it is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural so what is the voice of God it's the voice of the supernatural Supernatural can you say Amen see so we we find now that that we have lived in a time uh through through years of thousands years to where the voice of God Our Shepherd the voice of Our Shepherd has been foreign to the world right ain't that right the voice of God has been foreign to the church world it reminds me of the time in the days of of the Old Testament Eli and Samuel and the Bible says that the voice of God was a rare thing for Samuel 3 1 says the word of the Lord was precious in those days why was it precious because it was rare it wasn't just a common thing it was rare in the days of Eli and there was no open Vision ain't that right so what was it the prophet describes that time as a time of confusion because there was no voice of God there is no open Vision it was just it was a time of confusion a time of of catastrophe the people couldn't clearly see because there was no open Vision ain't that right Prophet said the voice of God was just foreign to them and it got in such a place till the church began to let uh get so loose that the word is foreign to the people ain't that right they didn't know the word of God they didn't understand the word of God there was nobody to give them the correct word of God so they didn't have a voice of God and wow what a what a what a sad day that would be to live in that time amen and you didn't know what to do with your children you didn't know what to do with your family you didn't you didn't know how to cope with the church you just didn't have a voice of clear Direction wow that'd been bad wouldn't it amen well it's you know you know the prophet says that Eli of course we know he was a priest he wasn't a prophet but he was backslidden his his eyes began to get dim uh because of his old age ain't that right he couldn't see to get around and he had let the word of the Lord go undone he had left the work of the Lord go undone everybody was occupied with everything else but the house of God and and the things of God and and Corruption was in the church and the people had no clear direction from the Lord and and the prophet said the need of the hour was they needed an open Vision they they needed the word of the Lord to speak directly to the people Amen to gather them out of all of that confusion so that the Sheep could shine and follow Laura remember without a Shepherd the Sheep scatter ain't that right amen so God had to raise up a prophet among them and that was Samuel because the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet The Prophet is the one that has the vision the open Vision ain't that right so he wanted God wanted to get the people out of the confusion Eli's days the prophet coming upon the Earth showed that Eli's day Eli's days were numbered amen and and Eli the priest the prophet said represented the church the church denominations were numbered ain't that right God was going to raise up a prophet amen that had a clear-cut thus said the Lord amen to give a vision to give direction to to to to to an open Vision to the people ain't that right then then parents could start teaching their children and the church could start teaching their their people and and and and and and people would have thus said the Lord amen down into the bosom yes sir see so he says the prophet is the word and the priest is the church and God the voice of God was making itself known through the prophet ain't that right not the priest the prophet amen and he says God has promised to meet the need of this hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after he has promised it we can rest assure that he will keep his promise and that's the confidence the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need can you say Amen but I want to say we've gone beyond just looking and needing a man God to meet the need of the hour today he's already met the need of the hour do you believe that the Lord has sent a prophet through the Malachi prophet of Malachi 4 he has met the need of the hour just as he did with the prophet Samuel God would raise up a prophet in this day and the churches would be numbered the denominational Church would be numbered it it would be the end of them it would be the end of their foul teaching it would be the End Amen other man-made traditions and and the voice of confusion there will literally be a voice of God on the Earth today thank you Lord amen and we know it to be the voice of God because it brought back the supernatural Living God Among Us you believe that Supernatural god with the supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word amen see now only God sheep now listen now only God sheep going to hear the voice now now now you know the prophet goes on talking about you know being overseas and and and and he's talking to some some gentleman that uh I don't know if he was a Shepherd himself or what but brother Brown saw that there was donkeys out in the field with the sheep and there was other things out in the field with the sheep and and and they got to talking about that Shepherd and the the man says well you know he's kind of like he he's kind of like y'all's cowboy in the United States and so brother Brown said oh so a Shepherd is a herder you know and he said well yeah he's kind of like a herder he says oh he's well I just thought it was for sheep and and the man said no it's not just for sheep he'll he'll he'll be a Shepherd to the donkey and he'll be a Shepherd to this he'll be he said but notice the difference he said it's at night time that the shepherd will call his voice will begin to call and only the Sheep will answer his voice and only the Sheep is gathered into the full everything else is left out in the fields but at night time does the Sheep is gathered in for protection oh my God can you say Amen now I know everybody's claiming Christianity and I know I know everybody's feeding off the blessings of God but there is a voice that is sounded in this evening time bringing the Sheep into the foe why the wraths of God is coming it's true and Only God sheep's going to hear the voice everybody else may be speaking in tongues but only God sheep going to hear the voice everybody else may be running around dancing shouting and you know professing Christianity and going to the sports uh Arenas and the bars and and all of that and don't really care about the things of God and yet just putting on a a display of godliness and all of these things and and just having a form but there's a bride a sheep that's going to hear the voice of God [Applause] can you say Amen see and when they hear the voice every denominational power is broken over them do you believe that see why the open Vision has now come to them there's plenty you know those that claim to be in the message but they have never heard the voice behind The Voice and they still hold the old denominational ways they still holding the old Pentecostal Traditions they they're still stuck in in man-made Traditions can you say Amen yes sir see amen they still accept the denominations as though they have some kind of truth that they can teach us as the Sheep of God Amen they still tried to divide the Bible from the message and and see they don't understand that that it's not the separation between Bible and messaging and the New Testament Prophet versus the Old Testament Prophet all that it's the voice of God that is sounding the same voice that was sounding in Isaiah's day is the same voice that was speaking through the prophet of this day it's the voice of God all right it's the voice can you say man and if the Lord is your Shepherd then you know his voice [Applause] you know his voice can you say man now brother Branham explains the reason as to why the church is in the condition that it's in he said and and when we're saying the church remember not bride brother Branham plainly put the difference between bride and church ain't that right so the church natural has heard the prophet just like you and I have Prophet went around the world seven times proclaiming this message the supernatural power of God behind it right it wasn't hitting the corner but the reason why it never changed the church and the church is in its condition is because there are so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it spoke right through their midst right in their midst see they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day now this is amazing how that they have they have centered themselves on the voices of the day to where they couldn't hardly even hear the voice of God and recognize it they couldn't recognize it right and so we we find that that brother Bradham would tell us if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us now now think of it because we know beyond a shot of a doubt how many knows Beyond Shabbos out that God his voice has been sounding we know beyond a shout of a doubt then what would bring confusion then is the voice of our enemy that would bring confusion to where we would not understand the voice of God when it spoke he said there's so many voices in the Earth today that it is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural there's so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even shake the Nations ain't that right they're not just overnight people but they Shake Nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowery see and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper see there's voices that raise up and it may be even confusing to you young people how that demand can be great in in successful in their great meetings and thousands of people and yet the voice of God or the message of brother Branham would be so condensed down that hardly nobody knows it that that he came in this day do you realize history is being lost of what brother Branham what happened in brother branham's meetings right yeah that's right a lot of things are being lost because you got your your our elders that were there have have left the scene or leaving the scene ain't that right give it a few more years and and and and and and if if God would tarry there'd be very very very few people in this earth know that God sent a prophet and that's why it's important to have Ministry that'll stay with that message and proclaim the message before you to keep that Vision alive [Applause] and you say Amen now he said see a person get confused it's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper there's voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewheres the true voice of God now I'm not going to go into everything I'm I'm I'll let you go here in a minute but some of the voices today brother Bradham mentions them thousands of voices but one of them is a church voice and you know you can take this in so many directions as far as a church voice because you know that's what brother Branham come to do is he come to expose the devil in the church whereas everybody else all the other preachers you know they expose the devil in the in the center in the bar in the in the in the movie house and and this and that but here come a prophet exposing this the the the religious side of the devil out ain't that right and and there are there are great powerful Ministries out there that that truly have a gift to preach sometimes I when you hear them I'm like wow if if they just gonna know the message it would just be mind-boggling and then sometimes I wonder you know you just kind of you drift as a as a man and you're thinking well why would God not use them people to come into the message and and bring the people together because that's not God's plan amen God used the seventh grade conduction to bring the message and he's not going to use some great gift to where everybody oohs and all's over that gift that's that's going to pass we we're past all that The Lord Is Our Shepherd ain't that right The Lord Is Our Shepherd so then then we find they're able to deliver their sermons and wow they're able to to bring masses of people in and just hold them Spellbound and and sometimes I just marvel at the way they can just present a message but yet the voice is contrary to the voice of God but that voice is so powerful and strong the church voice is so strong that it'll put the voice of God way back can you say Amen now Prophet said it's the voice of a false prophet he said now see the prophet of course is a preacher the modern word Prophet absolutely means a man that preaches under inspiration and there's men who stands and calls themselves a prophet and then denies the word of God denies the truth of God and at mine it just blows the people's minds how the fact can prosper and we say the real voice of God was in the then the message of William or Adam and it ain't prospering much to them so they just think you're following something some old dead thing if it was really the voice of God then it would Shake everybody remember brother Brown talks about brother Boze don't brother Brown said I just I've been praying for shaking he said I just I just knew the shaking was coming brother Brown said you're seeing the greatest shaking it'll ever have that's right why the voice of God was sounding and he wasn't out to shake everything he was out to shake that little bride bring her into the full can you say man so people have turned down their visitation today because their Church taught different than what the voice of God was proclaiming then there's the voice of politics promise of prosperity brother Brown said the voice of politics is actually stronger than the voice of God in the churches it's amazing how politics have become such a big thing in message churches wow George they will literally fight over this most people vote without even knowing what the will of God is and really don't care we see that we're in the last days we know what the voice of God says there's not no hope for America there's nothing that's going to bring it back and how many thought that Trump was the guy voting message people getting out and voting for this guy but see it was the voice of politics that was drowning out the real voice of God hello is true and the prophet sits there so they're really without knowing the will of God they're just doing what they want to do well then when Biden comes in we all complain but if we really know that the Lord is Our Shepherd and we understand that the will of God is then we know that we're in his will we were smack dab right in the middle of his will do you believe that Biden's corrupt he's bringing this nation down but it's supposed to happen can you say Amen but we're not calling out for prosperity brother man said Prosperity does not is not a sign of God's blessings hello Prosperity is not a sign of God's blessings but my sheep know my voice and if there's ever a time that the voice of God must be prominent in our lives our church our home it's now don't get me swayed by the voice of politics don't get swayed by the voice of the church can you say Amen that's right see amen another thing another voice is the voice of Hollywood don't be swayed by that voice and you say Amen brother Brown said seed the voice of Hollywood has captured the world that's right yes guess what it's doing it's drowning out the voice of God it's drowning out the voice of the Lord so we understand why so many very few are going to make it too many voices out there let's probably let someone come out in Hollywood with something you'll find it all over the country hello some popular thing some dress some some Style it got me in you know wearing these skinny jeans and churches falling right into it message young people falling right into it it's a voice of Hollywood it's true see and he says see you find it all over the country notice they have set a pattern for our women on their dress and their heads hairstyles see they set that dress and the church ought to know the voice of the trumpet of God on that but there's so much confusion because you see others do so and there you set them as the examples you you see ours these these these sisters wearing these short skirts don't put that as your example they want to go out skiing putting putting you know wearing their mini dresses and and and wearing her pants claiming that's Holiness that ain't holiness hello it's not holiness it's a style that is coming in that's drowning out the voice of God our lady should be ladies our men should be men and you say Amen so he says don't you never pattern yourself after that kind of an example because it's perishable always hear the voice of God what he says about it can you say man that's right see so there's so many things to get us at a place to where we can't hear the voice of the Lord amen bran talks about having religious holidays there's religious holidays Christmas St Patrick's Day yeah you know you got your Mother's Day Father's Day you got you got all these things and and and he says and the commercial World captivates that it it it it it pounces on that and then they make millions and millions of dollars off these things and the voice of God sets dead can you say Amen the voice of God and so every other voice is setting the pace for the world setting the pace setting the pace setting the pace can you say man that is it helping the people absolutely not is your money helping your people helping you absolutely not your fine houses find cars find everything absolutely not it's making the church more dead it's making the church more worldly it's making the church more they ought to see it and I'm not just saying ours I'm just saying it's everywhere and these voices are setting the pace for the world but it's not the voice of the shepherd can you say Amen it's a voice that's leading them to destruction and the people become are so gullible so unsettled because they don't know the voice of the shepherd and the prophet says how do you know the voice and I'll close but the prophet says how do you know the voice he said you don't know the voice by your ear playing the tape but he said you know the voice by your heart that inner something begins to speak to you yeah you're hearing the voice of a prophet yes you're hearing the pastor yet you're hearing the Evangelist you're you're hearing but the voice of God is something that's an inner side inner that begins to softly speak to you have you ever had that happen sure you have do it you just know this message is right you just know what direction to take yet you just know and and and and how you know it is not because you've got uh uh uh some sensation or a bundle of emotions that you're able to take it back to the word [Music] ain't that right you're able to judge the Spirit by the word by its motives ain't that right brother Brown said the only way to straighten all these voices out is tested by the word test it by the word can you say Amen do you love the Lord amen see so what we what we want to do is get to the place and I I think it would be good for this church to get back to the place a real sensitivity to the voice of God don't look to the left or the right I enjoyed brother Andrew's sermon the other day changing our Focus see when the Lord is your Shepherd and you know that you're following the Shepherd by The Voice then you're not running to and fro like the Bible says you're not fulfilling that part of Prophecy where they run to and fro looking trying to find the word of God the Bible says they shall not find it but my sheet know my voice my sheet my sheep can you say man now the Cry of today is behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me I don't think there's any other age that has given a challenge to the church to hear his voice as it is this age hear my voice why because God would raise up a prophet to give an open vision amen and all of these voices would be sounding at the same time and the call would be hear my voice hear my voice and if you hear my voice and you open up to me I'll come in and sup with you then you begin relationship Fellowship can you say Amen you love the Lord check everything with the word see if the musicians will come brother Brown said you might hear in your ears the voice speaking but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking then you're hearing you're not you do not see with your eye you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something and say well I just don't see it well you're saying you don't understand it say you do not hear with your ears you hear with your heart many times your ears hears the true voice of God and it falls off of you like water off of a duck's back see because your ears are hearing but when you really hear you hear with your heart then you know the Lord's your Shepherd and you're coming in tune with that inner voice that small voice can you say man I want to bring something else out right fast but Psalms 95 and 7. it says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart now you know what he's talking about don't let your heart be filled with unbelief don't Harden your heart don't Harden your heart When Trials come don't don't don't Harden your heart when things come up that seem to be impossible don't let your heart be filled with contempt when it seems that God isn't making a way of Escape for you don't don't let your heart be hardened at his voice yield to his voice can you say man don't let your heart be hard and when it seems that God isn't working a miracle but hear the voice of the shepherd no weapon that's formed against the eagle and prosper every tongue that shall rise against the end judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the lord of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord hear the voice of the shepherd Jeremiah 32 27 behold I am the Lord the God of All Flesh is there anything too hard for me [Applause] don't don't Harden your heart at The Voice see see you you're going to see all kinds of things and and the voice of the Lord will be so contradictory to everything all right that if you're not careful you'll start doubting that voice and you'll Harden your heart against that voice and accept every other thing don't Harden your heart the Lord is your Shepherd that voice is the one that's going to get you out of here the voice is what's calling you wooing you can you say Amen Psalms 103 2 bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits he'll forgiveth all thine diseases who healeth all thy uh forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crown of thee with loving kindness and tender Mercy who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles can you say Amen hard not your heart in the day of his voice amen amen we could go on but just stop there appreciate your patience let's just sing a song Andy Walks With Me F maybe and he walks with me and he talks he
