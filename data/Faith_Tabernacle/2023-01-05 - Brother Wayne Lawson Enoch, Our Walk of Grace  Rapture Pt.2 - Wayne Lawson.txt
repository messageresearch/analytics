meetings having the confidence and of course brother Andrew thank you guys for having us and uh and taking your time to be here this week with us and we certainly appreciate it the fellowship around the word and amen we're certainly praying the Lord would share something that he would speak to our hearts amen and I just wonder if we could just bow our hearts this evening in a word of Prayer gracious Lord we are thankful that you would give us the grace to Stand Here Again Lord the year has just changed and Lord we're reminded of another year waiting Lord looking for that imminent return that Lord when we'd be caught a way to meet with you now Lord Jesus this is on our mind it's on our hearts Lord It's it's season Lord and as they sang the song All I Got lately he's leaving on my mind I think about it Lord I think what it's going to be when the when the elements of my body go to changing and and Lord we just get to walk from one realm to another and Lord it's the it's the center of my life it's the focus of my heart and Lord we're willing to lay aside anything that we could be a part of that and achieve it Lord and we're asking you tonight father that you just come and you'd speak to us Lord you would deal with our hearts Lord you would lead us in the word Lord that you would open things that you would desire us to know and we're asking that you would bless this congregation that would take their evening and gather together Lord and give us an opportunity to speak with him I pray you bless them Lord just send your Angels Among Us and Lord is Apostle Paul said give us the spirit of wisdom and Revelation tonight father now we ask it in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and God bless you amen we'd like to go back to the scripture if we can to the first Thessalonians chapter 4 we'll be looking in the 16th and the 17th verse first Thessalonians 4. 16 and 17. for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord we ask the Lord to bless his word tonight as you can be seated I want to take a uh an extension of this I'm going to be in if the Lord Keeps Us in this path we'll be here for services on this particular subject but tonight we're going to take a second part and as we left you last night at the pyramid I want to talk to you again about Enoch but tonight I want to talk about Enoch's walk and then our walk of Grace our walk of Grace of course if we're if we're looking at this subject and we say that we're speaking on a Rapture well there's a lot of different definitions of what you would say if you say the Rapture there's a lot of ideas about that but so there's has to be exactly a defining or a definition do you get it from uh which dictionary from which person from which assembly who who has the definition of that but I believe that it was given to a seventh angel prophet and I believe that messenger was able to give us this word and brother Bradham actually tells us that the word rapture is not in the Bible he said but it's it's to be caught up so we're using the word rapture in the place of being saying caught up and brother Madam uses this word and he says instead of saying they shall be caught up he said they shall be raptured which Rapture is including both the resurrection of the Dead and the change of their body to immortality and then it's the living that has changed so Rapture is inclusive of both resurrection and uh an Ascension or a body change uh so we we realize that Rapture uh actually the the definition of the root word rapture actually is derived from a French word rapture and it's actually from a medieval Latin Rapture which is Latin is the base of most languages uh but it actually means a seizure or a kidnapping and I I specifically like that myself because it makes it seem a little more like what the prophet was trying to tell us is that God was coming back for his children it wasn't so much that you're running God down trying to be a part but that God sent something to get a hold of you to make you a part amen is not that you're able to make yourself but it's that God has sent something that has has drawn you uh that is basically could I say it like this an irresistible forces came after you amen and snatched you and and actually uh in the unveiling of God brother Brahman says that some are already I'll leave one take one he brings that to the son of man Ministry and shows that some are already taken by the message it it took you it took one left one took another left one amen showing that this is an individual relationship now the Rapture of course what we're talking about the Rapture the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her and it is revealed to her and the revelation of the true bride of Christ will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture and now this Revelation for the for the Revelation is Faith and you cannot have a revelation without it being Faith so we say to you Faith uh the rapturing faith it's we're speaking about Rapture revelation Faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God the word comes to a prophet faith and Revelation is speaking of rapture is brought by a prophet now of course the prophet tells us this he says of course the third pool of his ministry he says there's no higher order to reveal the word than a prophet so somebody says well brother Wayne why do you why do you think that God would send the prophet in this dispensation the Bible said God will do nothing until he sends a prophet do you really think the great event of the Rapture would happen and God not send a prophet amen it takes a prophet to bring change to a generation nothing changes until the word is spoken and then that's where change begins amen now there's there's no higher order reveal the word of the Prophet so a prophet is spoken now the Rapture he says that we're talking about is only for the bride there's a lot of people there's a lot of classes of people but what we're talking about is for the bride there are actually three different Witnesses in the Old Testament of rapture we're talking about Enoch Elijah and Jesus now for our types of what we're talking about last night and tonight is we're going to speak about Enoch and the scripture says that Enoch walked with God and was not amen and for God took him I think that's a powerful thing God took him amen amen uh you know they got these new things and they talk about people doing things and they say don't be like uh don't be like this guy or be like this guy you know and I want to be like Enoch you know he walked with God God took him be like Enoch you know walk with God and let God take you amen God took him now in Hebrews 11 the Bible said by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him and before his translation he had this testimony that he had pleased God without faith it is impossible to please him again Faith Revelation Faith Revelation is the rapture comes from Faith or Revelation and the Bible says that Enoch had it before he changed bodies Enoch had it before he left the Earth he had it and he built it in a pyramid I don't know how long the pyramid took to build but whatever it took he already had the Revelation and put it in the pyramid before he was changed so it was a it was not something that he caught just before he walked off the Earth it was something that he carried with him so you can actually possess the Rapture Revelation and still remain on the earth for a season of time is that right come on church amen that's exactly right you said preacher what are you trying to get at I'm trying to say that you're in possession tonight of the very Revelation that will change the body of the church amen we are in the Revelation rapturing season that's where we're standing tonight it was the prophet of God said of course the Bible said faith is our Victory is that right and the Bible says that this Death Shall be swallowed up in what in Victory that our faith will swallow up this death amen and then shall it come to pass the Saints for death is swallowed into Victory it's going to the the Revelation is going to swallow the church amen y'all know what I'm talking about God always gives a revelation then you possess it Noah's seen it 120 years and then possessed it amen Enoch how long did he see it before he saw it far enough ahead of time that he built it in a pyramid and then Vindicated his Revelation by changing his body and left a Vindicated Memorial upon the Earth that we're still talking about 4 000 years later powerful to me that he had this Revelation before his translation now this is speaking of the church amen having the Revelation before amen seven Church age is what takes the Rapture one and four teen says Enoch with seventh from Adam was prophesied saying Enoch preached saying the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints amen of course he not being our type he preached the message of rapture and was scoffed at the same as we're scoffed at today he was scoffed out back then he preached the revelation of the Rapture they denied it and went into Judgment of the antiluvian flood amen if you turn down the message of change and Rapture only judgment is there because it was the Escape before the Judgment amen God showing in Enoch that he was building a way not an ark like Noah but he was building a way to get us off of the earth before the judgments fail God was able to do it if he wanted to show it in a type how could he do it how could he how could he get Enoch off of the earth without death as it typed to us he made a translation for him God made a Rapture for him and God had to do it in order to make a type out of Enoch of course Enoch his whole body was transformed that he might be able Amen to be a type can you imagine he changed his body to be a type if God could change a body in a type what could God do in the reality of that type amen when the type is being fulfilled I believe God tonight has got a People in mind that we'll be changing their body the prophet of God tells us of course that he not built amen the the pyramid which was the second Bible and he said what Enoch done here he said well it's taking place it's the gospel coming to the church it's like the gospel coming see it starts wide at the bottom and it represents the early days of reformation and you could call yourself a Christian and maybe it was Catholic it would get you killed just to say that you were a Christian but then they preached justification and then long come Wesley and then come along the church see it's a minority coming down to minority can we bring up that pyramid picture again Enoch's pyramid we look at it one more time amen we was on it last night we'll look at it one more time there is Enoch's pyramid we're not going inside his Pyramid tonight but there's his pyramid and the pyramid never had the Capstone put upon it right amen him showing amen that it didn't have the Capstone in that age but the cat Stone would be coming whenever that William Branham draws us a pyramid he brings us the Pyramid of the Statue of the perfect man the next one when brother Branham brings it to us he puts the Capstone on the pyramid and he's preaching to us that this is the ending of the age see he said if you're in the Zodiac you're in the last of the of the consolations he said if you're looking at the pyramid you're at the Capstone if you're looking at the written bible you're in the Book of Revelation so whichever Bible you're looking at we are at the end and it is time for the rapturing of the church amen this is a picture of course of the Statue of the perfect man which you find in First Peter chapter one amen if you're if you're if you're looking in that First Peter chapter one amen it's a promise of divine nature given to the church it's a it's a mountain or a possession the church's promise divine nature and and and and from the faith of God giving you a birth he adds to that Faith knowledge and and I guess we got him right here don't we we add their faith and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness now you can look at all them and those are the attributes amen that come up through the ages of the seven colors of the rainbow amen but when you come to the top one amen the Capstone is love right the catstone is love and and the Bible said amen that God would add love how many realizes that there's not another virtue in this pyramid where God said he is he never said I am knowledge or I am virtue or I am Faith he bet God said I am love amen amen that the pyramid is capped by the spirit of God God that that Revelation Amen in this age is a powerful understanding that the Lord himself as a spirit will cap the Pyramid of the church is that right he will cap it off himself he will weld the whole thing together he he'll make a one unit out of it isn't it powerful that the Capstone is in the shape of the entire pyramid so the whole pyramid is him on that one Capstone amen when you get the cat Stone you got everything you need when you get the Capstone it's a finished work amen the prophet of God said the seven seals seals off the New Testament is that right it seals off the New Testament the word coming to the church now in First Peter chapter one when Peter builds you up he'll build you all the way up to love and the minute he gets to love the next verse in the 11th verse says for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the king to Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in present truth yeah I think at me as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance and knowing shortly I must put off of this Tabernacle even as the Lord Jesus has showed me now Look at the power of this for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly isn't it amazing that at the Capstone age amen When Love sets upon the church amen there's a prophecy of an entrance being ministered to the church amen there's a door open in other words the heavens opened at this time if you're reading also look in second Peter 1 and verse 16 Peter says it like this we have not followed cunning divised fables we have made known unto you by the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by eyewitnesses of his majesty for we have received from God the Father honor and Glory when there came such a voice from heaven from from the excellent Glory saying this is my beloved Son and whom I'm well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard and when we were with him in the Holy Mount now look this man was with Jesus in Matthew 17 on Mount Transfiguration and he's giving you his account Matthew wrote it in one account he's writing it here in his account and he said we have heard a more sure word of Prophecy we're until you do well to take heed as a light that's shineth in a dark place until the day dawn of the day star arise in your heart knowing this verse that no prophecy is of the scripture is of any private interpretation so what he's prophesying is as as it was there on the holy mountain when Jesus went up on my Transfiguration what they saw was a glorified Jesus they saw a cloud come down on the mountain is that right it was not a thundercloud they saw it was a theophonic cloud That Came Upon that mountain and out of that mountain come a voice is that right amen and that voice was a voice that glorified Jesus Christ amen in his glorification and Peter says amen that he it was a more sure word of Prophecy in other words they seen Isaiah they sing Malachi they seen Ezekiel they sing the words of the prophets but they didn't they wasn't reading them that morning they were looking at them with their own eyes and he said we were eyewitnesses of the Majesty of our almighty God and he said these are not fables we're following this virgin birth that we've been this is not a fable amen the power of God that we've been talking about these things are not fables and he was testifying of a mount Transfiguration experience when they were on that mountain now listen friends we are not on Mount Transfiguration over there in Jerusalem tonight amen but we have had a Jordan River at the Ohio river and we've had a mount Transfiguration with the message of the hour and we've come up on Mount Sunset amen and we've seen a cloud come down and we heard a voice saying this day this scripture is fulfilled it's not a private interpretation him the word of God has become manifest in this generation to carry a bride from one dimension to another amen if you're a part of the word you're a part of the whole word and the word don't just have a prophet bringing a message it's got a People receiving the message and the people receiving the message are going to walk to the message till it changes their mortal blinds hey I believe it tonight I know that prophecy is not a private interpretation amen but God will change it in First Corinthians 13 watch the beauty of this here we are again with love but then that which is perfect has come that punch in part is done away now I want to say a little something right here there's a lot of mix up on this scripture and I don't mean it to to be mean but I'll just say this the Church of Christ interpret this scripture that when the perfect word comes then the the gifts are done away that's why they've interpret that scripture amen so they do a good job proving that one don't fade which is love and that's true love is eternal the gifts will cease how many knows that and that's what Paul is saying the gifts will cease but how many knows when they cease the prophet said the apostolic age does not end amen until the calling ages over as long as God is calling there's an Apostolic age so don't interpret this that whenever the message comes the gifts are done away with because it's not at all brother Ben said the apostolic age doesn't exceed doesn't cease nor does the power of Pentecost cease amen with a coming of the word it's a Church of Christ Doctrine to teach it otherwise amen and we're not Church of Christ right we're we are Bible Believers and and God bless the Church of Christ I pray I pray God do great things for them amen but we're talking about a rapture we're talking about a Rapture when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child thought as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things now you know he's going up this pyramid for now we see through a glass Darkly but then we shall see face to face I will know in part that then shall I know even as I am also known you said preacher what are you talking about that cat stone is Love First Corinthians 13 is a chapter of love and it's saying in the age of love when that perfect thing comes you will be known you will know as you were known now now somebody said well Bill Wayne what difference does it say that we know who we are amen I'm talking about Rapture Revelation here the prophet of God said when this bride knows who she is the rapture will go have you ever thought that the right shirt Revelation to you is a knowledge of who you are how many realizes adoption has to do with the maturity of who you are amen amen the Holy Ghost is your witness that you were Sons to begin with and now he's come to lead you into the fullness of the word of God in the dispensation that we're living in amen it comes at the time of Love Can we go to one more scripture first John chapter 3 and watch this scripture first John chapter 3 and verse 1 I could preach a month on this one behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knew us is not because it knew him not what kind of love does it take for God to call us sons of God sons of God somebody said well if we're Sons then we're in a place of maturity and we don't need the Holy Ghost anymore we don't need the move of God anymore come on church amen but the Bible said that he asked job where were you when the sons of God were shouting for Joy he didn't say when the babies of God was shouting for Joy or when the infants of God or the immature church is shouting for Joy he said when the sons of God were shouting for Joy I actually believe it's a sign of maturity when the church can know that it has a need of God he doesn't need of the Holy Ghost it's only an immature church that believes they can do these works on their own or they can live as a Christian on their own but the but the higher you get in God Amen the prophet of God said watch that wheat just before Harvest he said the head will begin to bow my goodness he'll begin to see that he needs God what kind of what kind of love is it that he would bestow upon bonus it's agape love we're we're at love again but now we are the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is brother we shall see him as he is glass Darkly in the days of Paul come on I didn't write it Paul did grass rocked it Darkly in the days of Paul but there is coming a Time according to Daniel 12 that in the end time the seals will be broke off of the Bible and you would see it face to face amen there was a time that man looked Darkly but not today a day star has risen in this generation the Vindicated word has shined the light even in the evening time it shall be light amen the word of God manifested will bring a Clarity to the church I say the Sun is up amen I say confusion is over I say dark and gloomy days have come to an end we have seen the resurrection and power of Jesus Christ in this generation the very thing that will change your body is not coming the thing that will change your body is here that's what sweeps through these buildings amen when you when you feel the power of God and somebody breaks out dancing somebody hollering Hallelujah glory to God you say what's wrong with them it's called the Dynamics of the spirits and that's exactly what hits the mechanics of the word and causes a change in the body [Applause] see amen we shall see him as he is how many knows that man didn't understand what man was until First John 3 said we should when he shall appear we shall see him like he is brother random brother bam teaches this particular scripture and says see it didn't it didn't appear what man was going to be he said but the other day I went over there and he said they're men now ever been a man he said the theophany is not a spirit it's a temple it's a body it eat and he he said or not he said but it was in every way a man he said I embraced them they were ever bit there they were men and women every bit man and woman he said everything but the glands he said that that wasn't there he said but they were real amen do you see the age we're living in when the revelation of theophany Amen isn't it beautiful when you come to the time of change is when the time of the revelation of theophany breaks out upon the church this was not known in other Ages come on Church it wasn't known Paul said I went over there and I rode of it in a few words it was illegal for me to talk about what I saw over there he said a Melchizedek he said I said a few things he said but you can't take it now but there is coming another church there is coming another season and it's coming Another Time come on Church and and Paul spoke of Melchizedek a few times William Branham preached this entire sermons on who is this Melchizedek who was at church it was God in theophany and at the time of the revelation of the church receiving theophany revelation God himself came to give it we knew God had a theophany we didn't know we had theophany but God revealed it in this message and William Branham built an entire tape and sent it back to the church because it's no longer illegal to know it it's not illegal to know it it's the age of Revelation it's the age of wisdom and knowledge it's the age you will be know the way you have been known of God [Applause] brother let me tell you what if we don't pass her go to sleep here and we're we're going to be changed God's got a body that we can step right into brother man said death he off and he'll come right here and we'll be changed he said if we're asleep God will raise us up in that theophany and meet it with this physical body but brother let me tell you this when it's all over we're all changed whether we're alive or whether we're dead we all change by the power of God and that power is already in the building tonight the power that will change your body is what heals the sick it's what saves the laws it's what brings the gifts it's what brings the power of God come on friends we don't need to throw out the thing we need for change my goodness yes sir yes sir bring our bring our pyramid back up here yes sir when it comes to that love isn't that isn't that amazing the offany Revelation comes Seven Seals are open all this comes the capping of that stone spoken word original say brother I'm sitting in that pyramid you could take a razor blade and can't run between the rocks it was so fitly put together they said Solomon's Temple was the same he says but watch now there comes that headstone crying Grace Grace amazing The Headstone now here you've got it written above that it's love but above it it says Grace the reason Grace is on this headstone is because of what brother Branham teaches I'm not sure who drew this probably brother Ronnie milavo but uh but I'll say this to you amen this is coming from the prophecy of Zechariah 4 you all know the prophecy we've preached it brother Sean's priesthood brother Andrew we've all preached this because William Branham was as Rubble to the church right and when the Bible said when he lays the foundation you can rejoice when you see the plummet in the hand of the ruble when you sings cerebrum will walk out with a plummet when you see William Branham walk out in his ministry you can Rejoice now what was they rejoicing for because he wasn't only going to lay the foundation he was also going to bring the headstone the message isn't bringing the headstone the message is the headstone don't you believe in the Corporal yes I believe in the Corporal body of Jesus Christ we will go meet him but what we're talking about tonight's the head to the church The Headstone is the spirit of God brother Mary says what caps the church now of course amen there Comes This headstone crying Grace Grace there Comes A Spoken Word Original Seed brother man said Grace Grace Amazing Grace there it is he said that's the headstone see you see it coming up justification here it comes now God taken it see he come from the Sanctified Bunch up to that Pentecostal Bunch restoration of the gifts now God has taken it from there and honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just like the word because it's got to fit with the word see God sent that baptism of the Holy Ghost now a lot of people get really uh messed up on this there's a lot of arguments and I don't want to teach tonight on dispensations but let me just make this real clear to you but baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on Azusa Street was not a holy ghost falling like it did in the upper room and somebody said somebody asked me one time they said brother Wayne what's the difference because it went into a husk showing it was a denomination which was a part of the Holy Ghost it wasn't the true Holy Ghost and Prophet God said the reason we know it is because the word hadn't come yet amen but then watch amen what we have is we have the word coming and bringing the true baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the Holy Ghost falling under a son of man age just to clarify to you we believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we're talking about under the son of man Administration now watch what he's talking about in Zechariah 4 amen uh if you if you're if if you want to talk more on it later I'll be glad to Zechariah Chapter Four he said who aren't thou old Greek Mountain before it's Aruba thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstones shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen isn't that beautiful too gracious amen look Grace Grace say it with me Grace Grace there's two Graces right now if you go to the scripture somebody said well brother Wayne how is there two Graces in the New Testament how it's just the grace of God right but how is there two Graces well if you go to Titus Paul says it like this for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men so there was your grace and the time of Paul and it appeared unto all men but in the 13th verse just after that he'll say but we're looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ and savior so he said there's something that has appeared to man but we're looking for something Paul was not saying everything that you were looking for was there at his moment he was projecting something in the future and he was saying it's appeared unto man but there's something coming now watch this because if you go to First Peter 1 and 13 you'll see it again we're forgot the loins of your mind to be sober and to the hope of the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ come on church amen The Book of Revelations was not opened in the time of Peter it wasn't even written yet but in the revelation of Jesus Christ that would have to come of Grace how many knows why it's Grace because you can't open the Bible said no man can open this book no man could look at no man could open this book the book of redemption had been sealed from the Garden of Eden right it's sealed from the Garden of Eden and it would take the grace of God to open up that book in the end time now if you go back here and look at what he has to say about he said the grace of God is brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now you all probably have that book rojc you call it revelation of Jesus Christ right it's a it's an end time book coming from The Book of Revelations now if you watch Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 2 Peter Paul says it like this if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you in other words Paul was giving a dispensation of Grace and he brought a Grace that appeared unto all men but he's prophesying there's coming a time you're going to see face to face there's a time you won't be looking in the glass Darkly there'll be a time John says there'll be a time when you shall be no as you are known amen Paul said when Christ who is our light shall appear amen something's going to transpire as Jesus said a little while and the world will see me no more but ye shall see me I will be with you even in you because I live ye live also watch two resurrections I live ye live also and in that day come on that was not Jesus day that was not Paul's day that was not Peter's day that was not ruther's day but in the day amen that God would say and I am in the Father the father and me and I and you Amen in that day you shall know you said preacher what day is it the prophet of God said it was the day the Revelation was made known my goodness that's our day it's the day of rapture it's a preacher what are you talking about brother man preaches the message of Grace and he said that great Prince is going to call Grace Grace so zerubbabel the Old Testament is William Branham in the New Testament he's restoring the temple not by pie not by power but by Spirit now brother Brandon said this true message of Grace Remains the Same and that's what Satan has tried to knock from the church is the grace of God that we're all saved by the grace of God not by denomination not by The Works of man but by the grace of God that's where salvation has come from the message of Grace brother random says it like this he says oh he said we wouldn't have a chance of poor unlearned people he said but it doesn't take knowledge he said but it'll take not by might or by power but by my spirit now watch this I'll unfold this mystery and he will cry Grace Grace with shoutings and cryings the unfolding of the mystery was the bringing of The Headstone according to brother Branham the unfolding of the seals is the mystery of the coming of the countstone if you're listening to the breach and brother man must tell it there and he'll be preaching long and he'll say this great book nobody could touch it y'all know the story he said if nobody could touch it at all he said but listen he says but now it's come the time he said let him come forward now and take the book or forever hold his peace is that right amen but the Bible in Revelations 5 said and he come and took the book amen and in the breach message guess what we get the first seal on the next night because he come and took the book amen amen I think we could Shadow out I think we could praise God for the grace that's come by the word of God in this generation it's not just the grace of Paul's age it is Grace that Paul had and the grace of the message of the hour put it together it's Grace Grace it's the grace of God and has come to this generation we have a Vindicated word amen what is it amen according to the spoken word Original Seed he said it'll be so close he said unto the word itself will blend into this word it'll be called Grace Grace To The Headstone God's only provided place for the Remsen but now we come to the Head the cat Stone Grace Grace to the Capstone cried The Headstone crying at Grace Grace passed from death and creep into the word of the Living God Hey listen to that pass from Death Cree into the word of the Living God God's only provided plan for this age amen all his sons in this word age are quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive seated in Heavenly places already alive and subject to every promise listen that alive and subject to every promise and them which are alive and remain they are alive and subject to every promise let me ask you is the rights are a promise we are alive and subject to every promise there will be a bride there will be a Rapture there will be a change and there ain't nothing the devil can do to stop it there ain't enough demons in Hell there ain't enough Devils allowed to see you that's not enough come on Church there's not enough nudity that's not enough magazines there's not enough alcohol that's not enough cigarettes that's not enough sports it's not enough problems amen Nothing's Gonna Hold This Pride I'm taking a rapture it's a promise and we're subject to it already hey you being a part of God's G seated together to manifest the entire body of Christ my goodness Jehovah Jireh remember the last thing is divine presence the word itself he is the word the head the word is coming to the body amen we're not looking for the word to come folks right the word has returned unto the bride Amen brother man said not some man Messiah the holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing he here it is here now working in the flesh getting the body ready for rapturing Grace my what was William branham's Ministry doing he was bringing rapturing Grace hey man he wasn't starting a church he was finishing the church the seventh Angels Ministry was to finish put the cap on it what was the Holy Ghost given for brother bam said what's it to do to continue the work bring his church together to bring a place in that day far beyond Lutheran Methodist and Pentecost it's coming to a place of adoption and rapturing Grace my goodness listen to that adoption rapturing Grace in first seal brother bam said we don't know what they are yet talking of the Thunders he said but my opinion they'll be revealed right away Amen brother Brown and when it does it'll give faith for Rapture Grace come on that's not just like a punch line for a group that's the word of God for our generation the seven Thunders will give faith for Rapture Grace have you ever wondered why you need faith for Rapture Grace because the kind of Grace I'm talking about is Grace that you cannot get without God giving it to you I'm talking about Divine love projecting Sovereign Grace Divine love projects Sovereign Grace we have received Sovereign Grace in this generation faith for grace in other words it's going to take a revelation to understand how God could give a man this much grace you'll never get it to denomination you'll never get it to the ideas of man it would take a prophet to go into the high and a part of God's mind and say you always were a CERN and he would pick it up in Ephesians and he would pick it up in the Book of Job and he would pick it up in the Book of Revelations and he would prove his words that you were in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world and you have fell into this Earth as a as a bypassing of your theophany but God can't leave you here you're a very part of the very soul and the gene of almighty God and he sent this message to redeem you to find you to look you up like an eagle looked up a baby eagle come on church God come to find you and he didn't come to find you to leave you here and make it through this judgment but the grace of God I'm talking about is God come to catch you he come to bring you he come to make you move you into the rapturing of the church and Escape before the tribulation and it's going to take Faith to receive that kind of Grace right you're going to have to have faith to believe this gonna take a revelation to understand how Wayne Lawson can go in the rapture that's right but Mark's going to take Revelation you're going to take understanding how can God look at this man and say he's spotless but Sean's going to take the grace of God it's but it takes Revelation the grace of God that we can look at one another and say this man is spotless never a mistake when somebody well I know I must take that guy I know a mistake brother Wang May amen but see you're looking at the wrong thing I ain't got time to preaching them tonight but I take the scripture and cover you up with it brother bam said balik went and told Balaam and took him to a spot and showed him the problems with Israel and brother Brandon said they'd done every dirty thing they could on the counter he said but Balaam and baylet was seeing the problem he said Oh my he said God never saw it he said they couldn't see the atonement and God couldn't see the sin isn't that powerful amen they couldn't see the atonement but God couldn't see the sin he said they couldn't they couldn't see the atonement and nor could they hear the shadow of the king that was in the camp they couldn't hear and they couldn't see but there was a people of God and could see the atonement they could hear the shadow of the king well that's another sermon sorry hey man just just something I mean y'all just y'all just Billy drawing tonight God bless you hey man Shake somebody's hand say God bless you God bless you amen a lot of drawing going on in here tonight the second seal he said God help our unbelief take it away Lord we want to receive rapturing Grace we may in other words what's that take away our unbelief so we can get it take away that feeling that I got to do something I gotta make something I gotta I gotta hurry I gotta oh I gotta get it done no you need to surrender to the will of God for your life it is the will of God to give you the Holy Ghost it is the will of God to heal your body it is the will of God Amen he chose us come on think about it you are living in a Rapture season because God chose you to live in this generation because you will not hinder the coming of the Lord but change in the moment in the twinkling of an eye my goodness the axis lead at the root of the tree all teachings are cursed under the word of the Lord with the Rapture in Grace we want it we'll be able to make these mysterious Thunders out here and the church will be taken up we want it we want to be ready to receive it Lord perseverance 1963 setting in Heavenly places caught up in rapturing Grace right now somebody say right now rapturing Grace right now Rapture and Grace ain't coming amen we've done heard the voice cry Grace Grace To The Headstone right stream Grace right now all we got to do is surrender to Grace that's already upon the Earth the Grace has come it's rapturing Grace right now perseverance right below it that's paragraph 12. we're going to paragraph 123. they've come too late to tell us Divine Healing they've come too late we've done been healed we've done been filled with the Holy Ghost and we done got rapturing Grace amen I understand English like that don't you we done got it we done got it say what you want to I done got it you can say it ain't real I already got it amen somebody said well God don't heal the body you come too late I've already been healed I've already had a supernatural touch in my life I know thousands of people who have been miraculously healed I have read thousands and hundreds of thousands of accounts of God stepping in and doing it and I'm sorry I'm not going to give that to the devil gonna give that report to the devil and say the devil did it I don't believe that I believe God did that and you've come too late to tell me that God don't save that God don't ain't able to take a young man's life tore apart and tore around amen looked like that it's too far gone but God likes them kind of cases God gets his reputation with them kind of cases he takes them out of the bar rooms he takes them out of the streets he takes the power of God fills their heart and then puts them in a Pulpit to say I am a witness that God still saves and feels and heals amen we've got the power of God in this generation we've already got it and let me say this I've already got Rapture and Grace you have come too late to tell me that this message ain't got the grace for rights the preacher what are you talking about brother man said when you got the Holy Ghost you got everything in you come on church when that love set down on that pyramid it was all there already come on it was already in there amen and God has put everything you need for a Rapture in you already [Applause] Devil's not making you looking for something I tell you what you ought to do you ought to quit looking you ought to quit looking for it and start looking at it we done got Rapture and Grace and here's something to think about brother shamaya brother Bram said law having a good shadow of things to come he said what the law offered he said the next chapter in the 11th verse Daniel done it unto the law look what Enoch done under the law look what Moses done under the law he said then if he was living in the shadow of the atonement he said what ought the Christian Church do today was the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ we're standing tonight friends I tell you it ought to make every Christian buckle up his armor you know to put on the full armor of God and sure bring the breastplate in the helmet the shield and all these things Paul said like a soldier going into the battle The Wiles of the enemy come up throw up your Shield go on out to meet him if the law can produce that what of the reality of the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said when a dead letter will do that what are the resurrect constraints of the power and the spirit amen what could it produce if the law without the spirit produced that what would the spirit of Jesus Christ do in the Church of the Living God I think it'll do it I think it'll do more to make us feel good I think it'll take us into a realm real quick and everything about us come on Church it'll Quicken our language it'll Quicken our step it'll Quicken the way we feel see visions prophesy of course all kinds of gifts will be in the church but there's another level and that levels when the word comes down in divine order and the church walks puts One Foot In Front Of Another until they are no more you say preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about the time of change it's a junction and brother man the cause of those times brother man said watch those Junctions Enoch live in a junctional time and God came down and walked with that man he said well hey man they like that in other ages it's all right this is a different age it's a different time it's a different period This is a junction it's when mortality and immortality are meeting it's when Time and Eternity are blending together it's when the ages are ending and the bride is stepping out to take a change listen friends we are not living in the days even the brother random we are 50 years past come on 57 years on Christmas Eve past brother Adam's going oh God Amen Enoch changed 57 years after Adam died I don't know if it means anything but it's pretty good to me amen Adam was going 57 years when Enoch walked off of the earth and here we've been 57 years without the prophet and I believe there's a bride going to walk off of this Earth anytime I believe in church I believe walking time just in time change time we're there we're at that time you said brother Wayne why are you saying that because brother bam said just before the time of changed God came down in omnipotence and done them around gosh he came down in omnipotence and done the miraculous at the time of a junction God does something Supernatural well listen let me tell you why I believe we're in a junction of years we're leaving 22 and we're going in 23. Amen Let the omnipotence of God come down in your heart and do a miracle tonight and say God I tell you what I'm gonna do every bad thing that was in 22 every bad thing that was in 21 I'm going to lay it aside and I'm going to walk with God I'm gonna walk on like never before Lord I'm Not Looking Back not picking up troubles I'm gonna move forward by the grace of God Amen because God is here it's a time to walk with him omnipotence has come to do Supernatural things go walking with omnipotence and see what could take place walk with the power of God and see what happens come on church I know what I'm talking about come and preach little meetings like this whether it be maybe 150 200 people gather them up on a Wednesday night and amen and something happened in that meeting we talk about 10 years later Miracles take place when the word of God is being preached cancers have dropped off of people leukemia has been healed because we are in a season that the omnipotence of God is here to do the miraculous Among Us a miracle work in God is Among Us now Enoch needed a way out and there was no airplanes during this time brother by Adam said see he had the Revelation and how but God going to do it he said there wasn't even a jet plane to get him off his feet man had never even been on a jet and he was talking about walking into another dimension but God provided a way a translation that took Enoch from Earth to Glory without receiving death so have you ever thought about where Enoch was before Enoch was not where was Enoch before Enoch was not he was in God's provided way come on Church you are standing where Enoch was before Enoch was not now God provided away brother bam told him he said Enoch needed a ladder and God gave him a highway isn't that powerful he said I want I I tell you what brother Wayne I want a Rapture God give you a message to walk with you say I want a translation God give you a word to go walking with it do you know that when Enoch took off on that wall it was a special time it was a time when it was a time when the when the Eternal Walk was Immortal that's a sermon isn't it brother Terry it's a Time the Eternal well the more I think brother Mark said he's been preaching on immortality season blending of dimensions tell me it's not Timely literally we're that's what we are it's a season do you see brother Brandon says you know maybe we don't have the power to walk like Enoch did and take an afternoon strong go home he said but I do believe it will happen and I know there will be a Rapture in the last days so maybe they didn't have it then he said but I know it's got to come somebody's going to do this now watch this let's go let's go and read this and and I don't let's go to that next pyramid picture I Got That Rock let's let's go let's go out here now you all recognize that picture right there what that is that is the rock that's in Sabino Canyon how many business can you so a lot of you has not been there just a few of you been there some of you've been there and you know exactly where I'm going with this but but isn't it amazing that here's another pyramid here's here's another pyramid brother Brown describes this pyramid in the wings of the snow white dove and he's talking about his ministry and the change that's coming upon him and he's and he he says I went down that day and I think it was around noon or so 11 o'clock he said I went down and got a drink and come back up he said and and I stood next to that rock where Perry's Standing There Brother Branham put himself against The Rock with a bare chest he just walked up and got against The Rock but but when he did this this rock was there and there's a little path if you're if you're looking at it it would be like this being the pyramid and I'm going to walk by it there's a path now I'm not got a big path here but I'm gonna walk this path to show you the path might be that wide you know but after but right right on the other side of the path it's just a drop off down to the creek so you it wouldn't be really passable this rock was sitting right in the pathway then but when you when you went there brother Doug Baker took me there the first time he took me on a nice tour there and went there kids and when we walked up to it uh if if you if you look on the ground out in front of it like if you look on the ground out this way out in front of the rock down on the hill there's more there's another half of that rock laying down there and brother when I walked up to it brother uh but the dog he says he said brother Wayne you notice anything odd about these rocks and I said yeah of course I said that rock down there has been dynamited I said the the drill marks are still on the Rock he said do you know that I said well I used to drill and shoot rocks on Highway construction and big rock Cuts you go through I've done a bunch of them so I knew immediately what them rocks what that cut was in that rock it was a drill bit that had cut the Rock and had blasted it and he said well he said what's amazing he says that this that this path right here was drilled and shot and that they split this rock in half and built this path that walks right through there I said man that's amazing well this pyramid of course has been opened right this rock has been opened with a blast all right where he's standing when brother Branham walks up to the Rock he says he was standing there now if you're if you're there during the time of day you'll find out why he's standing so close to rock there's no shade trees right so this Rock's basically the only shade and if the Sun is high you basically have to get against The Rock before you get any shade so he's standing there with his shirt off staying against this rock and the Lord speaks to him and says look under your heart y'all remember the story look under your hearts in the end of the Wings the snow white dove give me the next picture look under your heart and when he looks under his heart this is what he sees it's uh maybe you can't see it very well there but it's the word Eagle written in white courts it's the word eagle the fourth anointing in the Book of Revelations was Eagle amen the fourth anointing was prophetic was Eagle how many knows that was that was a symbol of brother Graham's Ministry was Eagle right and and he puts his heart on it and there it is in white courts written the word Eagle give me the other ones there's a couple more there uh well yeah you can see this here just there it is right there I had Cheyenne Erickson to darken the rock she didn't touch the courts she just darkened The Rock uh with edification she didn't change anything I just had to put a darker color on the Rock so you could see that it's actually the word Eagle written in white courts Now give me that other picture of brother Perry green I worry standing against that rock now you can see where it's Eagle there now right it's probably striking brother Perry somewhere maybe right in here amen now when brother Branham walks up there hey man when he is told to look he said what's that lane under your heart and isn't it amazing that Perry being a little bit of a taller man it's going to strike him different than it struck brother Branham but God has so designed things that he knew how the statue of his prophet he knew the size of this man he knew the measurement of his heart from the from the dirt yeah I'm talking about God now I'm not talking about I'm not talking about engineers and Architects I'm talking about God and he engineered this thing where this man's heart now you sing this word Eagle what's it this long four or five inches now I'm not a mathematician there's probably some very smart people sitting in here tonight amen maybe you could help me with the statistics but what is the statistics that a man at the size of William Branham would put his open chest on a rock that would strike him at the heart and it would be this big now how big is the world how many Roxas in the world how many Canyons is in the world if you just went into Arizona how many Canyons would they be how many rocks how many are you with me yet amen he didn't know Eagle was written there he just walked up to a rock and put his heart in there it was written in the Rock Eagle Amen in in a four inch spot in the entire world and he puts his heart over that spot and God says to him look what's written now Perry Greenwood and never got there would he he meant it just didn't strike him right amen he didn't strike him in the same place it did Brother Branham but it was struck brother about him in the heart with a the word Eagle now you you take it to that next one but what's amazing is that path well when we got to talking about this I said brother Doug then then this path evidently had to be in it had to been built in some time period where they've dynamited the front half of this pyramid off and opened this up he said that's right so amen immediately when I got home I started I started getting out the history books and I started looking at the at the Sabino canyons and looking at all the dates and all this do you all know they built the paths in subpino Canyon in 1933 before 1933 you could have walked up to that path and there was no way to walk through that rock you it now today I could say to somebody hey have you ever walked that path in front of Eagle Rock and said oh yeah I've been on that path but in 1950 you could have said to one of the older guys I was down on this certain path the other day and they said well that path don't even exist see but it didn't exist when they were teenagers because it hadn't been opened yet see it took something to open the path of a certain season where you could walk the same place now listen I have stood right where the Prophet stood I have walked the same path at a prophet walk amen I literally passed through the same place he passed through and it's available today for a bride to literally walk the same path that William read themselves somebody said well brother Wayne we don't teach the Rapture like that because you know we was reading a book and back in 1884 they believed it was this way and back in back in in 1764 this this great man believed it like this and another one says it believes it like that amen and there's nothing wrong with what they believed it wasn't opened in that generation it wasn't open in their season but in our generation God sent a message and at the same time at the same time that an angel of the Lord was appearing on the Ohio River anointing a man of God in 1933 amen a light came out of Heaven brother man said a light they called a star amen a light came out of heaven and said as John the Baptist was given Amen to forerun the first coming I'll give you a message and a forerunner's second coming and there's some old construction workers out there in Arizona drilling a rock have no clue why they're drilling it they have no clue why they're building probably a couple of them saying it's too hot for this work today I don't know why we couldn't have built this next fall or next year but when they blew that rock open amen there it was in the middle of that rock oh Church of the Living God that word Eagle was not revealed until 1933 you couldn't seen it before then but you can see it now you said preacher I'll tell you what you guys believe things that nobody else believes it's because they couldn't see it then but you can now brother bam called it this dispensation of Grace in the evening time now look at this this just before the antiluvian flood Amen brother Brandon said Noah he said was going to be leaving he said God give us a type and Enoch he said you know what he did he gave us a slow motion type isn't it powerful we're going to change the moment between July but the man said he slowed Enoch down and gave him a slow he gave us a slow motion type so we can study it he did it in slow motion hey man took 300 years to do it so that you could look at it and study it and know that it was real amen God commanded Enoch and everything God did commanded Enoch he did amen now prophet of God said see what it is any time that a man or a woman takes God at his word they are an astronaut amen and see today what astronauts and so forth have achieved in the natural God has been able to achieve in his church by the spiritual people who believe any man or woman who will dare at any time to take God at his word is an astronaut come on Enoch was an astronaut he took God at every word and he walked with the word of God a spiritual astronaut is an eagle and this is an eagle age and it's an eagle anointing and it's a power of God dropping on the church he said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about when the Dynamics and the mechanics have come together you can come out here tonight amen and you can take a baseball bat and I could I could hit you it's just fake right in the knee and you'll need to come out just like that because I I hid it in a spot that gets a reaction probably anywhere I hit you with a baseball bat get a reaction amen but but but but but it it it's you you say well he struck me in the knee with it he struck me in the arm with it brother Branham said God struck Enoch with his Dynamics in Enoch's mechanics so he had the mechanics and God took the Dynamics and he struck him in the right place and when the mechanics and the Dynamics come together the quickening power of God took that man off of the earth and I'll tell you we've got a lot of McCain in the church come on we've been mechanically putting this church together for the last 50 years and I love the mechanics of this word you know what I'm preaching tonight I love the mechanics of this word but until the Dynamics of God strikes that mechanics it will not live but we are living in the generation where the Dynamics has come on the mechanics of the word for the changing of our body the quickening power of God Enoch walked with God Enoch walk with God he said Christians tonight we have an opportunity he said all the opportunity Saint Paul never dreamed of having we have opportunities Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had my goodness you got an opportunity tonight to walk with the omnipotent and see the miraculous among the Church of the Living God I think it's time to shake loose church I think it's time to shake loose of all of our thoughts of all of our feelings amen we are living in the darkest of all ages but God is simply omnipotent among us to cause us to walk in the power of God brother Adam said what we ought to do is walk come on now Rapture is progression we ought to walk he said faith is unconscious and I learned years ago in meetings and different walks he said faith is unconscious and you've got faith and don't even know you got it he said Jesus see he just walked right on unconscious he walked right on unconscious because he was here to fulfill a word he swore by himself brother bam said this you're here to fulfill a word too he said so you are to walk unconscious of fear you ought to walk unconscious of criticism good Lord what if what would we do if we did that if we didn't care what nobody said about us I'm walking this Trail right here and you can't stop me because on this Trail it's the change of my body on this Trail is omnipotence and miraculous come on church it's time to turn a deaf ear to all the criticism that is coming against us and say I'm going to walk with God I'm going to walk with him I'm not going to pay any attention to the left hand or to the right I won't have that boy win that bicycle had he win it he didn't look left he didn't look right he set a goal and he took off walking amen and that's exactly the Church of the Living God he said when something comes up in the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God if your neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking [Applause] just keep walking when the doctor says you're going to die walk with God my goodness look what he says brother man says you'll have your ups and downs but don't you worry you're going to go through some Briar patches you're going to go through some sharp rocks over Bluffs down the hillsides up through the mountains and over the waters but walk with God it's time to walk with God Walk with every word amen forget it amen I know there's a lot of reasons to that the devil's throw it out there but we can walk with God anyhow [Applause] this is a Vindicated Revelation folks this isn't something that's a guesswork this is Vindicated Revelation somebody said well brother Wayne what are you talking about he not walk with God and then he wrote it and then Vindicated somebody said well brother Brandon you know he never he never did that but actually he did actually he did somebody said when did Brother bam do it it's recorded in the message he that is in you and brother bam takes that and goes out to Corral Peaks when he was out there in Colorado some of you boys been hunting out there knows what kind of storm strikes those mountains and brother Brown said I went way up on high on the mountain honoring my wife for her anniversary and he said I went out there and he said the Great Blizzard started striking I thought I better get out of here quick or I'm getting lost why that happens you get turned around you'll die off there he said but a voice called me said go right back up top there he said and I've lived long enough to know to obey the voice of God and there he was walking in the middle of a street can you imagine hey man somebody said brother brother you're going the wrong way but Sean you're going the wrong way as a storm on don't you know you ought to go that way amen but something had told him to go that way so he knew to obey God come on I'm talking about Enoch folks he meant he knew to walk with God and he walked in the middle of a storm it was blowing and hailing and rain was coming upon him but but God had something in mind he was walking with the omnipotence and God was going to do a miracle among them how many knows the story but the man said I walked up there he said that great storm must blow him and he said the Lord spoke to me and he said I am the one that calmed the waters I am the one that still the storms I'm the one that took the angriness out of the waves and my voice still has power he said you speak to this storm oh church we have forgot that there is a power in our voices we can still speak to the storms of Our Lives look what he done the prophet said storm go back where you come from and let the sun shine for four days brother let me tell you we're everywhere problems everywhere it was on every leaf on every Bush on ever I'm preaching now amen that was rain on every Bush it was on every leaf it was on every tree the evidence of that blizzard that snow it was everywhere but when he spoke to it he said go back and let the sun shine and let us be in the drive for four days come on Church and brother bam said there was a great win come Blowing by he said and there it went he said the clouds went back where they came and the sun began to come out he said I Heard a Voice he said would you come walk with me it's pretty powerful I tell you what's amazing brother bam said it like this he said now when you hear a voice make sure it's scriptural like as if voices were talking to you every neighborhood Amos now when a voice talks to you make sure it's scriptural I said yes sir brother Bradham see what he done was when he spoke that storm away the one he was walking with he said come on walk the sunshine now y'all remember what he did Brother Brown said I went over there and he said I was standing there and he said I had my head put my gun against the tree and he said I had my head down and he said I kept hearing this patent he said I wondered what's that noise and he said I realized that it was my tears coming off of my beard falling on those dry leaves look it was gone the storm was gone the evidence was gone the aftermath was gone it was all gone because he was walking with omnipotence how many ever heard brother bisco tell the story of the brown bear he said they were missing that Vision the brown bear you remember it he said it rained for four days solid so Brother Bear never come out of his tent ring four days solid he said on the last day he said we we saddled everything in the wedding he said it was a mess out there packed everything up he said brother Brandon walked out and said where was that where was that bear at Eddie and he said he pointed him brother man walked up there said he'd come back in a minute and he said now I've been the Jonah here he said I should have went with you boys and got that bear he said I've been to Jonah he said but we will ride out of here dry brother Eddie says he said brother Wayne when you go buy them bushes it's been how many Ever Walked In the Woods it ain't if it ain't even raining you'll be sopping wet walking 100 yards in the woods because then bush is hitting you and all that he said there wasn't a raindrop the leaves was dry the bushes was dry the trees were dry been raining four days he said preacher what are you talking about I'm saying that it don't have to last always I'm saving trouble don't last always when you're walking with the omnipotent God he can cause the storm to leave and then in a moment dry the whole thing up and it's like that had never come a storm at all and come walk with me and brother takes off walking and while he's walking he said there it was he said all of a sudden you remember the story he said there I was walking in virgin Timber and never an ax laid that's virgin Timber never actually come on y'all know now y'all know where we are we just stepped into the Eden in the millennial world no no axes there nothing there used to preach what are you talking about what's the very next thing he said I look up and there stands three deer and they're not afraid of me and he talks to them and starts communicating with the animals they're not afraid he said they don't leave they come closer he had power over the animals he's walking in the sunshine the evidence of all of the trouble is gone he said I look he said and I was in every way a young man and then I turned and looked and there stood my Young Bride oh that's right I'm walking with him that's right I'm walking with him do you know this is not a fantasy I'm telling you these are not fables we're talking about these are realities when you walk with God things can change in a moment amen we're talking about the Rapture we're talking about the changing in the moment and the twinkling of an eye it can look like that there's no sun it can look like now to see it can look like that the world is falling apart and in one moment and in one moment it's stepping from one dimension to another don't you get discouraged don't you get your head down don't you let this devil stop you walk with God Shake It Off Church walk with God I tell you what I don't care where you're from I don't care what church you go to if you're a Believer this message I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ amen Walk Of God drop it walk with God let everything go walk with God with all your heart walk with God thank you all right so brother I've been told this before but I can't walk with God I can't because we've had we've had trouble that's too much going on there's too much with me there's too much with problems with others and there's another greater story in the message than Georgie Carter kind of musicians come now there's not a greater story than Georgie Carter nine years nine years on the bed walk him with God every day in the scripture laying there in that condition and everybody around her saying there's no hope there'll never be change it can never happen she was reading about a miraculous God that was upon the Earth doing miracles brother Amos wasn't her fault she was in that condition y'all know why you all know her uncle raped her and gave her tuberculosis and they'd crippled her and put her in that condition and she was crippled and she would have stayed there but God sent a prophet he walked in that room brother Shawn he prophesied over and said get up from there in the name of Jesus Christ brother Brown said power came into her legs and she stood up on her feet first time in nine years he said preacher what are you talking about five minutes before the word came to her she couldn't walk five minutes before that Prophet prophesied she couldn't walk but the minute that the message spoke over her life brother Brown tells a story about a little girl over there in Finland right on the edge of Ukraine or Russia and Finland and he said there was a bunch of War orphans actually uh you know that one he's sweet I know I want you to play it lightly sweet I know that that video he sent you I don't know if you know if you don't something close will be okay but brother Ram said there was a little girl came a little finished grocery the War Orphan he said she'd come in there and said she had a crutch on her leg said when she come in there she come walking she said she was she was just walking like this and she she was carrying that crutch she couldn't even take a step he said that the ushers was walking him in and he said they didn't want you know anybody getting close to him he said but she was standing off she was looking at him he said while she was sitting there looking at her he said I I knew she wanted to speak to me he said so I stopped and I said bring her here he said I wanted to see what she'd do he said she walked right up to me and took took brother Brown's coat she probably wasn't much older than you and she saw that man of God she took brother Brown's coat and brother Brown said she kissed his coat said ketos Thank you thank you powerful brother bam said I looked down at her and I sing the vision he said God would honor it you're healed said she didn't speak my language he said there she went off with those crutches she's already healed vision's already been over alive prophets already spoke but it ain't her language she's walking brother said I go in and have the meeting prayer line he said I'm praying God get me back in contact with that child somehow he said I call the first part he said here she comes right in the prayer line he said I told the The Interpreter you say what I'm telling her say honey God met you out there in the hall you already healed take them crutches off he said she sat down there and started taking them crutches off he said I went to praying for other people he said the next thing I know she had them crutches over her head she's running across there I'll be healed I'm Healed before her translation she had the revelation she couldn't walk five minutes before that the Revelation was already given but it wasn't she hadn't caught it wasn't hers yet there's a little black girl in a in a meeting brother mom's having visions he said young ladies laying back here on the Cod he said I see it now man turtle shell glass is doing surgery over her it's a a voice larynx I think it was he said they did something wrong he said they've crippled the child she's laying back here tonight he said a color lady jumped off off the back come running up front she said that's my baby that's my baby he said well sis he said God bless you and she said will she be able to walk now brother Branham and he said honey I don't know he said don't think I'm telling you what's wrong with her God knows what's wrong only thing I'm telling you what's wrong with her other man said I went back to pray and when I did he said there it was he said I was standing in a dark alley and he said I looked up and across the street here here come this little colored girl with a baby doll and she was rocking that doll walking along he said I turned around said the child can walk now the mother said she can walk he said she can now two minutes before that but you can now [Music] this message gave you the ability right when brother Branham says that he said I turned and looked over the audience and here comes an elder gentleman across the top of the congregation he said he's walking in a brown pinstrip uh Brown I believe it's a brown pinstrip a strip striped suit he said I've seen him coming and I see him standing before a great he said oh there it is he said I see him this man falling off of a hay wagon as a young man they did a
