[44:55] Father
[44:56] Lord as your Believers have gathered
[44:58] here on this Resurrection Sunday father
[45:01] we've not gathered here to be seen or to
[45:03] be heard but Lord we've gathered here to
[45:05] worship you and to lift up the name that
[45:08] is above every name for Lord we know
[45:10] that at the name of Jesus every knee
[45:12] shall bow and every tongue shall confess
[45:16] and father we know the world hates that
[45:18] name the world despises that name father
[45:21] they've done everything they can to bind
[45:23] that name but Lord here's a group of
[45:25] people that you've called for that name
[45:27] and Lord I believe there's power in that
[45:30] name this morning that when we speak the
[45:32] name of Jesus Lord as I was just hearing
[45:34] your Prophet say last night breathe that
[45:37] holy name in prayer Lord just a breath
[45:39] of that name can change the situation
[45:42] and oh God I'm asking you this morning

[46:04] upon them Lord those that are on their
[46:06] way and unable to Lord get through
[46:08] traffic or whatever the situation may be

[46:16] to receive it in the wonderful name of
[46:18] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[46:21] and all the Believers says amen and amen
[46:25] the Book of John the 20th chapter and in
[46:28] the 18th verse of John 20 the Bible says
[46:31] Mary magdalina came and told the
[46:34] disciples that she had seen the Lord and
[46:36] that he had spoke these things unto her
[46:39] then the same day at evening being the
[46:41] first day of the week when the doors
[46:43] were shut the disciples were assembled
[46:46] for fear of the Jews came Jesus and
[46:49] stood in the midst amen I I love that
[46:52] Jesus came and stood in the midst and
[46:55] saith unto them peace be unto you amen
[47:00] when he had so said he showed unto his
[47:02] hands and his side and then were the
[47:04] disciples glad when they saw the Lord
[47:07] then said Jesus to them again peace be
[47:10] unto you as my father has sent me even
[47:14] so send I you and when he had I want you
[47:18] to catch this and when he said this he
[47:21] breathed on them when he had said this
[47:25] he breath breathed on them and saith
[47:28] unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now
[47:31] watch the next verse right after he says
[47:33] this he speaks of authority and says
[47:36] whosoever sins ye remit they are
[47:39] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[47:42] you retain they are retained amen we ask
[47:45] Lord this morning to add the blessing to
[47:47] the reading of his word as you can have
[47:49] your seats here this morning amen we we
[47:51] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[47:53] word of God amen amen I want to by the
[47:55] help help of the Lord for just a few
[47:56] moments this morning to speak to here
[47:59] and if I would title this today I want
[48:00] to speak to you on freshly inspired by
[48:04] the Breath of God Amen freshly inspired
[48:07] by the Breath of God now I'm actually
[48:09] drawing this thought from a quote in
[48:11] 1956 brother B preaching on speaking or
[48:14] speaking here on hear ye him from
[48:16] Matthew 17 where Jesus was there on
[48:18] Mount Transfiguration and in the in
[48:20] paragraph 10 he said you know God's word
[48:22] is so Eternal it's so inspired that it's
[48:25] not just for one occasion or for one
[48:28] generation amen but the word of God Is
[48:31] So Eternal it's the same and the truth
[48:34] amen the word of God is eternal the word
[48:36] of God is the same and the word of God
[48:39] is the truth he said this same word
[48:41] inspired the disciples it inspired the
[48:43] first row of disciples and then the next
[48:46] is they followed down to the Lutheran
[48:48] age through the Methodist age in every
[48:50] age and it is just as sufficient and
[48:53] inspiring today Amen to us as it was the
[48:56] first day it was given see and if the
[48:58] world would stand a million years that
[49:01] word would still be just as inspired to
[49:04] the generations that will follow us as
[49:06] it is to us because it is perfect it's
[49:10] always amen given for the time he said
[49:13] one great way we could approach it this
[49:15] afternoon is the coming of the Lord see
[49:17] first is Moses amen then Elijah and then
[49:20] Jesus then we notice that Peter while he
[49:21] was there brother B said Peter had just
[49:24] been freshly inspired
[49:26] he said because he had just give a
[49:28] witness to who Jesus was amen and he was
[49:31] inspired now when a man and this what I
[49:33] want to focus on when a man is inspired
[49:36] and he reads the inspired word then the
[49:39] two Inspirations gives a result no
[49:41] matter how well that you study the word
[49:43] it'll never do you no good until you're
[49:46] inspired yourself it takes your
[49:49] inspiration amen the word is already
[49:52] inspired amen so amen we're not here to
[49:54] inspire the word amen but the word is
[49:57] already inspired amen so what we're
[49:59] doing is letting the inspired word
[50:02] inspire our heart amen and that's what
[50:04] brings the results he said so what we
[50:06] need today amen is an inspiration over
[50:09] us amen God sweeping down with a new
[50:12] inspiration and breathing over us his
[50:15] power and his love and himself that it
[50:18] might Inspire us to Quicken us and
[50:20] awaken us to his word and then the word
[50:23] being brought in the spirit of
[50:24] inspiration then you'll see miracles
[50:26] happen amen and things take place
[50:28] because the two amen just comes together
[50:31] so when the inspired word amen connects
[50:34] with the inspired believer amen and the
[50:36] two come together amen then watch that's
[50:39] where the miracle happens amen that's
[50:41] where things take place now in job 32:8
[50:44] one of my favorite scriptures the Bible
[50:46] said amen that there is a spirit in man
[50:49] amen and the inspiration of the almighty
[50:52] giveth them understanding now when you
[50:54] look at that word INSP spiration it
[50:56] means breath it means spirit amen it is
[50:58] the Breath of God or the breath of man
[51:01] amen every breathing thing the spirit of
[51:03] man now amen so there job says it's the
[51:06] inspiration of the almighty that giveth
[51:09] him understanding in other words what we
[51:11] could say Amen it it is the breath of
[51:13] the almighty amen that breathes over the
[51:16] believer and that breath is what
[51:18] inspires them amen and gives them
[51:21] understanding about the word in the age
[51:23] they're living in brother said God keeps
[51:25] his word he said oh God who formed the
[51:27] Heaven and the Earth just let his breath
[51:29] go forth with his word and everything
[51:31] Tak in its right position amen the Earth
[51:35] the moon the stars amen all swung into
[51:38] place just as God Amen breathed on his
[51:41] word and oh God today we ask amen that
[51:44] you'll breathe on your word as we are
[51:46] trying Amen to bring it to the people
[51:48] may it take its position this morning
[51:51] amen its place and be rooted and
[51:52] grounded in every heart amen that every
[51:55] person might receive your blessings amen
[51:58] when you see the mountains out there
[52:00] amen the Breath of God put him in their
[52:02] position when you see the stars the
[52:04] Breath of God put him in the sky amen
[52:06] when you see the Sun and you see the
[52:08] trees amen it was the Breath of God that
[52:11] breathed over the creation amen and
[52:13] brought it into its position listen
[52:15] church amen if the Breath of God can
[52:17] hang the moon and the Breath of God can
[52:19] place the mountains amen I believe that
[52:22] same breath amen can come in the Church
[52:24] of the Living God amen and can breathe
[52:26] over every believer amen and it'll be a
[52:28] press breath amen it'll be an inspiring
[52:31] breath amen I say oh God this morning
[52:34] breathe on us once again amen breathe on
[52:36] us with your love amen breathe on us
[52:39] with your provision breathe on us with
[52:41] your anointing breathe on us with
[52:43] Revelation breathe on us with power amen
[52:45] I believe if the Breath of God begins to
[52:47] blow in the Church of God Amen there'll
[52:50] be a Revival breakout in every heart
[52:52] there will be a dance breakout in the
[52:54] church there'll be a shout come out of
[52:56] the heart of every believer because the
[52:58] Breath of God Amen is inspiring the
[53:01] Church of God Amen I I tell you what the
[53:03] devil's tried to do he's tried to blow
[53:05] his poisonous breath long enough amen
[53:07] but I tell you what it's going to take
[53:09] to counteract amen the devil's poisonous
[53:11] breath amen is a fresh breath of the
[53:13] Holy Ghost amen and when he breathed
[53:16] upon him he didn't say receive your
[53:18] problems he didn't say receive your
[53:20] situation he said receive ye the Holy
[53:23] Ghost and you all know that the the Holy
[53:25] Ghost is the only thing amen that can
[53:27] fix a situation it's the only thing that
[53:30] can bring a Deliverance it's the only
[53:32] thing that'll be the lifter up of your
[53:34] head oh hallelujah amen sometimes we
[53:37] just got to look away to Jesus amen we
[53:39] got to look away from all the problems
[53:41] and all the situations amen and all the
[53:44] backb and gain saying and just look away
[53:46] to Jesus and let him be the lifter of
[53:49] our head amen I believe it I believe
[53:51] there's power Amen in the Breath of God
[53:53] Genesis 2:7 the Bible said that the Lord
[53:56] God formed man amen of the Dust of the
[53:59] ground amen and breathed into his
[54:01] nostrils the breath of life amen and Man
[54:04] became a living soul in Isaiah 42:5 the
[54:07] Bible said thus saith God the Lord he
[54:10] that created the heavens and stretched
[54:12] them out he that spread forth the Earth
[54:14] and that which cometh out of it amen he
[54:17] that giveth breath unto the people upon
[54:19] it and the spirit to them amen that walk
[54:22] therein oh Church the same breath
[54:25] amen that created the Earth you're
[54:27] walking on is the same breath that was
[54:29] breathed upon you amen that's in you
[54:32] listen friends we're not walking by our
[54:34] own breath we're not walking by our own
[54:36] spirit amen but the same breath that
[54:38] said let there be and let there be has
[54:40] now returned in the church in the form
[54:43] of the Holy Ghost amen and we're walking
[54:45] upon the created Earth amen but the
[54:48] breath we're living and breathing by is
[54:50] the created Breath of God Amen I tell
[54:52] you in in other words breath is a sign
[54:54] of life life amen if there is no breath
[54:57] amen there is no life call 911 amen and
[55:00] the first thing they're going to say is
[55:02] are they breathing amen amen because
[55:04] breath is a sign of life amen can I tell
[55:07] you what else breath is in the Bible
[55:09] it's connected to praise Amen in the
[55:11] Bible the word breath is connected to
[55:13] praise brother said look here in Psalms
[55:16] 150:6 he reads it let
[55:19] everything let everything that haveth
[55:22] breath amen praise the Lord amen and
[55:25] then he says it again praise ye the Lord
[55:28] let everything that has breath amen
[55:31] praise the Lord amen praise ye the Lord
[55:35] amen that word praise means to shine
[55:37] amen it is figurative of God's favor
[55:40] amen it is to flash forth light it is to
[55:43] praise it is to boast it is to be
[55:45] boastful it is to make a boast amen I
[55:47] like this one it is to make a fool of
[55:50] Amen to act madly to act like a madman
[55:53] amen so when you begin to praise amen
[55:55] sometimes you're going to boast amen and
[55:58] sometimes you're going to shine amen and
[56:00] sometimes amen you're going to make a
[56:02] fool of yourself and sometimes when you
[56:04] get done praising they're going to think
[56:06] you're a crazy man amen but let me say
[56:08] this at the end of the day the only
[56:10] thing I'm concerned about amen is is
[56:13] there some breath in the Church of the
[56:14] Living God Amen that no matter what
[56:16] we're going through no matter what we're
[56:18] facing amen there's a breath in our
[56:21] lungs Amen to say praise ye the Lord I
[56:24] might be broke but praise the Lord I
[56:26] might be sick but praise the Lord I
[56:28] might be depressed but praise the Lord I
[56:30] might be discouraged but praise the Lord
[56:32] I might be perplexed on every side amen
[56:35] but praise the Lord why do you say that
[56:37] amen because the god that's going to fix
[56:39] it is the god that's breathing in your
[56:42] lungs amen and the breath that you're
[56:44] giving praise with is the same breath
[56:46] that's going to blow on the face of the
[56:48] situation amen and things are going to
[56:50] change amen because he's the god of
[56:53] change he's the god hey if you begin to
[56:56] praise him he'll begin to blow if you
[56:58] begin to praise him he'll begin to fight
[57:00] back against those Devils because our
[57:03] God Amen is a god of battle he's a god
[57:05] of wh I say praise the Lord amen praise
[57:09] the Lord the Bible said let everything
[57:11] that has breath amen praise the Lord he
[57:14] said no I'm not emotionally but I am
[57:16] emotionally too he said anything without
[57:19] emotion is
[57:21] dead anything without emotion is dead I
[57:25] love this one ordination paragraph 98 he
[57:28] said do you imagine a man saying he
[57:29] loved his wife and he hadn't seen her
[57:31] for a long time amen and pass right by
[57:33] and say well I'll see her some other
[57:35] time amen see that isn't or the wife
[57:38] saying she loves her husband amen or the
[57:40] parents saying they love their child
[57:42] amen well it shows amen so love shows he
[57:45] said see in our think our Expressions
[57:48] that we should constantly long to be in
[57:51] worship amen we should constantly amen
[57:54] long to be in worship anywhere Amen to
[57:57] Worship the Lord when we come together
[57:59] to worship Him amen worship him at home
[58:02] worship him while you're driving your
[58:04] car wherever we are Worship the Lord
[58:07] amen just pray he said the Bible said
[58:09] let everything amen that hath breath
[58:12] praise the Lord and then he said praise
[58:14] ye the Lord now I I I just got to say
[58:16] this quote astounds me he said even if
[58:19] you haven't got any breath amen still
[58:21] praise the Lord amen praise everything
[58:24] that has breath praise the Lord amen and
[58:26] then praise ye the Lord amen you say
[58:28] brother Andrew how can I praise amen
[58:30] when I don't have the breath to praise
[58:32] well you got to remember that he is the
[58:34] breath and you got to remember that if
[58:36] you're there amen that he can breathe in
[58:38] you amen and he can give you the breath
[58:41] to praise in other words you just got to
[58:43] be willing to praise amen and God will
[58:45] supply the breath to do it amen you just
[58:48] got to be willing to worship amen and
[58:50] God will supply amen the breath to
[58:53] worship listen friends God is not
[58:54] looking for people that's got it all
[58:56] figured out amen he's just looking for
[58:59] somebody amen that is willing amen and
[59:02] ready to manifest him in the age that
[59:04] they're living in amen I tell you why we
[59:06] don't pray sometimes I tell you why we
[59:08] don't worship sometimes amen preachers
[59:10] included it's because we go through
[59:12] things we Face situation amen we Face
[59:15] obstacles the odds are against us amen
[59:17] but I love what the prophet said he said
[59:20] sometimes amen we just need a little
[59:21] fresh feeling amen sometimes we just
[59:24] need a little fresh feeling he said here
[59:27] not long ago brother Fred and I and
[59:28] brother Tom a bunch of us went to a
[59:30] noted Baptist Church in the City of
[59:31] Tucson he said to see if we couldn't
[59:33] find a little something amen that would
[59:35] give us maybe a little fresh feeling and
[59:38] the minister stood up and said amen the
[59:40] people in Egypt when they left eating
[59:41] Garlic and so forth amen they wanted to
[59:43] go back again and eat amen said that
[59:45] something like people today and he said
[59:47] we all said amen he said I never seen
[59:50] such a bunch amen the whole church lost
[59:52] sight of the preacher and look back to
[59:54] see who it was it said amen amen it like
[59:56] just scared them to death amen they
[59:58] didn't know what it was amen they didn't
[1:00:01] know why amen that there was somebody
[1:00:04] Amen in the church sister Becky amen and
[1:00:06] they were saying amen but I'll tell you
[1:00:08] why they were doing it it's because they
[1:00:10] were willing to say amen and so because
[1:00:13] they were willing to say amen amen God
[1:00:15] sent some breath in there Amen to say
[1:00:18] amen amen and to breathe an amen to his
[1:00:20] word he said Make a Joyful Noise unto
[1:00:22] the Lord amen praise upon the harps
[1:00:25] praise him with the Sury let everything
[1:00:27] that hath breath praise ye the Lord amen
[1:00:29] God rejoices in his people let them that
[1:00:32] have learned say amen amen when anything
[1:00:35] is said right amen I tell you what we
[1:00:37] need to do amen we need to let the
[1:00:39] Breath of God Amen blow in the church
[1:00:42] again amen and bring back our amens we
[1:00:44] need to let the Breath of God blow in
[1:00:46] the church again amen and bring back our
[1:00:48] hallelujah amen and bring back our glory
[1:00:51] to God Amen y'all remember what it used
[1:00:52] to be like amen when you couldn't wait
[1:00:54] to hear the word amen and all you could
[1:00:57] say was amen amen remember what it was
[1:00:59] like when a good point was made amen all
[1:01:01] you could do was say hallelujah amen but
[1:01:04] you know what happened amen somewhere
[1:01:06] amen we lost a fresh feeling of how good
[1:01:09] God has been to us amen somewhere we
[1:01:12] went through a trial we went through a
[1:01:13] battle come on church we went through a
[1:01:15] war amen but I say God is here this
[1:01:18] morning Amen in the restoring power of
[1:01:21] his resurrection and I believe he's here
[1:01:23] Amen to restore our amen I believe he's
[1:01:26] here to restore our Hallelujah I believe
[1:01:28] he's here to restore our thank you Jesus
[1:01:30] I believe he's here to restore our
[1:01:32] praise and restore our worship amen I
[1:01:34] think it's time to let the Breath of God
[1:01:36] Amen Breathe Again in the Church of God
[1:01:38] Amen because this is not the hybrid
[1:01:40] church this is the true
[1:01:43] church this is the true church and the
[1:01:46] prophet of God said the true church amen
[1:01:48] is the mystical Body of Christ and it is
[1:01:51] born of the Breath of God Amen the
[1:01:53] Church of the is the mystical Body of
[1:01:55] Christ and it is born of the Breath of
[1:01:58] God oh did you get it the congregation
[1:02:00] said amen the Church of God is born of
[1:02:04] the Breath of God Amen God breathed into
[1:02:06] the nostril spiritually of Adam and he
[1:02:08] became a living Soul he said did you
[1:02:11] know the Pentecostals or the true
[1:02:13] Pentecostal church is the born of the
[1:02:16] Breath of God did you know that they're
[1:02:19] the born of the Breath of God then he
[1:02:21] turns to John 20 and reads our opening
[1:02:23] text and said now watch the father that
[1:02:26] sent him went in him in other words he
[1:02:30] said and Jesus when he sends a disciple
[1:02:34] he goes in him can I ask you this amen
[1:02:37] how is he in you in the age you're
[1:02:39] living in well according to Isaiah amen
[1:02:42] the god that created the heavens and the
[1:02:44] Earth amen is the same God that breathed
[1:02:47] in those who are walking upon what he
[1:02:49] created in the age they're living then
[1:02:52] listen friends anden the church is born
[1:02:54] of the Breath of God when this stature
[1:02:56] has molded itself up there in condition
[1:02:58] amen then God's breath breathes upon
[1:03:01] them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:03:04] then you are a son of God you can join
[1:03:06] anything you want to but you're born in
[1:03:08] the Church of the Living God Amen you
[1:03:10] are born by the Breath of God Amen God
[1:03:13] breathed upon them and said receive ye
[1:03:17] the Holy Ghost amen receive ye the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost oh my not come and join put your
[1:03:24] name on there with your soup suppers and
[1:03:26] all that goes with it you join a lodge
[1:03:28] you can join amen a Methodist Lodge you
[1:03:30] can join a Baptist Lodge or a
[1:03:32] presbyterian or Catholic Lodge or even a
[1:03:35] Pentecostal Lodge amen but when you
[1:03:37] become a child of God Amen you are born
[1:03:40] by the Breath of God Amen then what did
[1:03:42] the prophet of God say he said we are
[1:03:44] born by the word amen then brother shiah
[1:03:47] the word is the Breath of God can I say
[1:03:50] this to you amen God watches over his
[1:03:53] breath amen God watches over his word
[1:03:56] God don't waste his breath amen God
[1:03:59] watches over his word amen and God
[1:04:01] Reveals His word amen now watch this and
[1:04:04] what God has breathed upon his word amen
[1:04:07] when it becomes revealed it must have
[1:04:10] the preeminence amen can I say this to
[1:04:12] you amen then the word is the Breath of
[1:04:14] God right but the revealed word amen is
[1:04:18] the inspired Breath of God in the age
[1:04:21] we're living in brother said events made
[1:04:23] clear by prophecy he said we watch the
[1:04:25] Bible amen for God doesn't leave us in
[1:04:27] darkness he sent the Bible to forell us
[1:04:30] the events amen before they happen the
[1:04:32] very nature and time they would come he
[1:04:35] said now when you see the church get
[1:04:36] worldly like it was in the days of Sodom
[1:04:39] amen see the church world all going into
[1:04:41] the worship amen the God of this evil
[1:04:43] age and seeing that how many can agree
[1:04:45] that we see that amen we see the the we
[1:04:48] see the church World getting whirly and
[1:04:50] wicked and going in Amen to the worship
[1:04:53] of the God of this even age amen but at
[1:04:55] the same time we see that he said but
[1:04:57] then seeing a little minority group amen
[1:05:01] gathered out under the inspiration of
[1:05:03] God Amen producing again amen the word
[1:05:07] oh God producing again the life of Jesus
[1:05:10] Christ by the scriptures that's supposed
[1:05:12] to happen amen then you know what hour
[1:05:15] you're living in the Bible foretells by
[1:05:17] prophecy what day we're living and what
[1:05:20] time we're living and what kind of
[1:05:21] events ought to be taking place it
[1:05:23] foretells exactly to the
[1:05:25] letter and has never missed one age all
[1:05:29] the time not one time has it ever missed
[1:05:32] and it won't for who are predestinated
[1:05:34] to see it will see it amen for those who
[1:05:36] are predestinated to see it they will
[1:05:39] see it Jesus said no man amen can come
[1:05:42] to me except my Father which draws him
[1:05:44] and all the father has given me will
[1:05:46] come now watch a prophet it's the word
[1:05:49] joining the word it's the word joining
[1:05:52] with the word it can't do nothing else
[1:05:55] amen we know it the day we're living in
[1:05:57] amen so in this age the Breath of God
[1:06:00] Amen is joining with the Breath of God
[1:06:02] Amen the word of God is joining with the
[1:06:05] word of God I tell you what the devil
[1:06:07] wants us to do amen is the devil wants
[1:06:09] to put a thought in our mind amen that
[1:06:11] this word is not enough the devil wants
[1:06:14] to put a thought in our mind that we
[1:06:16] need something more than the word amen
[1:06:18] I'll say like a prophet said amen we are
[1:06:21] sufficiently impressed with the word and
[1:06:24] our midst amen I tell you what the devil
[1:06:26] was trying to do in John 20 he was
[1:06:28] trying to get them to believe something
[1:06:30] amen apart from the word amen but when
[1:06:32] Jesus come in the midst of them he stood
[1:06:34] right there in the midst of them the
[1:06:36] word appeared in their midst amen and
[1:06:39] said listen church amen receive ye the
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost and he breathed upon them
[1:06:44] amen now watch a prophet he said Jesus
[1:06:46] knew amen there was going to be a
[1:06:48] terrible draft amen away from the word
[1:06:50] in the pergan church amen which was yet
[1:06:53] 200 years old from the patmas vision so
[1:06:55] brother Mark we're not we're not a
[1:06:57] thousand years down the road amen we're
[1:06:59] just a a couple hundred years amen away
[1:07:02] from the patmas vision in the pergami
[1:07:04] and church age amen and they're already
[1:07:06] leaving the word he knew that drift
[1:07:09] would cause him to get in the Dark Ages
[1:07:11] he knew that the way man originally got
[1:07:13] away from God Amen was by first leaving
[1:07:17] the word if you leave that word you have
[1:07:20] left God if you leave that word you have
[1:07:23] left God thus he is presenting himself
[1:07:26] to the church at pergamus amen and
[1:07:28] indeed to all churches of all ages and
[1:07:31] here's what he says I am the word if you
[1:07:34] want deity in your midst amen then
[1:07:37] welcome and receive the word don't ever
[1:07:39] let anyone or anything get between you
[1:07:42] and that word this which I'm giving you
[1:07:45] the word is a revelation of myself amen
[1:07:48] I am the word remember that amen so
[1:07:53] Jesus is in the midst of the church and
[1:07:55] he's saying I am the word and if you
[1:07:57] want deity in your midst amen then don't
[1:08:00] welcome a feeling don't welcome a
[1:08:02] sensation amen don't welcome a gift
[1:08:04] that's unchecked by the word amen
[1:08:06] welcome the word in the church and when
[1:08:09] the word comes in the church there will
[1:08:11] be a power come behind that word and the
[1:08:13] prophet said I wonder amen if we are
[1:08:15] sufficiently impressed amen with the
[1:08:17] word in our midst amen Faith Tabernacle
[1:08:20] can I ask you amen are we sufficiently
[1:08:23] Inay bless with a word in our midst amen
[1:08:26] or is it just another sermon is it just
[1:08:28] another scripture is it just another
[1:08:30] quote is it just another service or is
[1:08:33] it just another meeting I say oh God
[1:08:35] Shake us from the pullit to the back
[1:08:37] door this morning and let us awaken our
[1:08:40] souls by the Breath of God to the
[1:08:42] inspired word of God Amen I tell you
[1:08:44] what's not Eternal is our feelings I
[1:08:46] tell you what not is true is our
[1:08:48] Sensations I'll tell you what is not
[1:08:50] perfect is our emotions amen but we have
[1:08:52] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[1:08:55] of the word of God with Divine
[1:08:57] Vindication and the word of God is
[1:08:59] perfect on our good days it's perfect on
[1:09:02] our bad days it's Eternal on our good
[1:09:04] days it's Eternal on our bad days and I
[1:09:07] say with everything within me I am
[1:09:09] sufficiently impressed with a revealed
[1:09:12] word of God in the age I'm living
[1:09:16] in if a prophet taught it I'm not
[1:09:18] ashamed of
[1:09:19] it now come on church and either we
[1:09:22] stand with a word or we stand with what
[1:09:24] what somebody thinks about it now I say
[1:09:26] this I am sufficiently impressed with
[1:09:29] the word in our
[1:09:31] midst have I got any other Witnesses you
[1:09:34] are sufficiently impressed that word
[1:09:38] impressed means sealed come on now and
[1:09:41] what did Jesus do he said receive ye the
[1:09:45] Holy Ghost brother said the Holy Ghost
[1:09:48] is the Seal of God he said now watch and
[1:09:51] that seal is not from meeting to meeting
[1:09:53] meeting he said but that seal is unto
[1:09:56] the day of your Redemption listen he did
[1:09:59] not say are we sufficiently impressed
[1:10:01] with Signs Now come on amen he said the
[1:10:05] word are we sufficiently sealed with the
[1:10:08] word now let me put this out there we
[1:10:11] believe in signs We Believe don't we do
[1:10:14] we do we believe in signs we believe in
[1:10:16] signs but can I tell you what signs can
[1:10:19] be impersonated come on now a devil can
[1:10:22] impersonate a time but a devil cannot
[1:10:25] impersonate the word now listen to what
[1:10:28] 2 Thessalonians 2:8 says when that shall
[1:10:31] then shall that Wicked be revealed whom
[1:10:33] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:10:36] of his mouth amen let me ask you this
[1:10:38] where does that breath come from it
[1:10:40] comes from your mouth amen shall re
[1:10:43] shall consume with the spirit of his
[1:10:45] mouth and shall destroy amen with the
[1:10:48] brightness of his coming even him whose
[1:10:51] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:10:53] with all power and signs and line
[1:10:56] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[1:10:59] unrighteousness in them Shall Perish
[1:11:01] because they now watch they Reed not the
[1:11:04] love of the truth that they might be
[1:11:07] saved in other words the word is the
[1:11:10] truth so they did not receive a love for
[1:11:12] the word they were not sufficiently
[1:11:15] impressed with the word amen but listen
[1:11:17] friends we are lovers of the word amen
[1:11:20] we are lovers of Truth amen I say this
[1:11:22] the Bible speaks of signs in Exodus 7
[1:11:26] the Bible speaks of signs and wonders
[1:11:28] amen that were done in the land of Egypt
[1:11:30] in Mark 16 Jesus said amen that signs
[1:11:33] shall follow them that believe amen can
[1:11:36] I preach you for a second amen signs and
[1:11:38] wonders amen shall follow them that
[1:11:40] believe I remember one time some of
[1:11:42] y'all here know Danny steeman I remember
[1:11:43] one time brother Danny was preaching and
[1:11:45] he got up and he was talking about signs
[1:11:47] and wonders following the believer and
[1:11:48] he said now here he said I'm the
[1:11:50] believer and he got two young boys and
[1:11:52] he said High sign and high wonders you
[1:11:54] know he called one signs and one wonders
[1:11:56] and he said now listen he said follow me
[1:11:59] amen so brother Danny started walking
[1:12:01] and everywhere brother Danny went he
[1:12:02] didn't turn around to see if they were
[1:12:05] still there he wasn't asking them are
[1:12:07] they still there he was not checking in
[1:12:09] with them to see if they were still
[1:12:10] there he said signs and wonders follow
[1:12:13] the believer he said so wherever I go
[1:12:15] signs and wonders go amen I think it's
[1:12:17] on the internet if you like said it
[1:12:18] sometime he said everywhere I go amen
[1:12:21] signs and wonders C so listen friends
[1:12:23] when we when we lose the sufficiently
[1:12:25] impr pressedness of the word is when we
[1:12:27] have to start stopping to check and make
[1:12:29] sure there's enough signs and wonders in
[1:12:31] the church amen for us to even claim to
[1:12:33] be Supernatural amen but I do not base
[1:12:36] the supernatural amen upon signs that
[1:12:38] can be impersonated I base it upon the
[1:12:41] word and as a Believer I am the word and
[1:12:43] then if I am the word signs and wonders
[1:12:46] are under a direct Mandate of the
[1:12:48] almighty God Amen to follow me wherever
[1:12:50] I am so if I'm here signs and wonders
[1:12:53] are here if I'm in Africa signs and
[1:12:55] wonders are there if I'm in Canada signs
[1:12:57] are Wonder come on wherever you go as a
[1:13:00] Believer church signs and wonders are
[1:13:02] following you amen because that's what
[1:13:05] God ordained them to
[1:13:06] do in John 4 Jesus said you won't
[1:13:10] believe except you see signs and wonders
[1:13:12] now how many realizes the Bible
[1:13:14] instructs us Amen to try the spirits the
[1:13:18] Bible brother preaches a whole sermon
[1:13:19] called discernment of spirit and what he
[1:13:21] says here amen is give them the word
[1:13:24] test notice he didn't say give it the
[1:13:26] sign test he said give it the word test
[1:13:29] amen spoken words Original Seed remember
[1:13:31] Moses born for the work had to wait on
[1:13:33] God for the extra gift for the job see
[1:13:35] he had to go back and wait amen for the
[1:13:38] time appointed amen now listen the
[1:13:40] people now listen a certain Pharaoh had
[1:13:43] to be on the throne and the people had
[1:13:45] to be wanting the bread of life before
[1:13:48] God would send him back amen that
[1:13:50] reminds me brother Josh's sermon here
[1:13:51] the other day amen on the blessing of
[1:13:53] hunger amen listen somebody had to be
[1:13:56] wanting the bread before God sent it
[1:13:58] somebody had to be wanting the
[1:14:00] Deliverance amen before God would send
[1:14:02] Moses into Egypt he said now with
[1:14:04] thousands of sign workers in this last
[1:14:07] day amen has created a generation of
[1:14:09] sign Seekers that knows no more anything
[1:14:12] about the true move of God in his word
[1:14:14] in these last days he said give him
[1:14:15] blood and oil and fleshly demonstration
[1:14:17] on the platform and they'll support it
[1:14:19] whether it's God's word or not whether
[1:14:21] it's scripture or not amen but Jesus
[1:14:23] warned us of such thing he said now
[1:14:25] listen Matthew 24 there'll be two
[1:14:27] spirits and they'll be very close alike
[1:14:30] and they will deceive the very elected
[1:14:32] if possible he said now how can you tell
[1:14:35] them amen give them the word test how
[1:14:38] can you know it speak the word and see
[1:14:40] what they say about it amen if they
[1:14:42] don't believe the word they have no seat
[1:14:45] germ in them they are of the evil one
[1:14:48] and deceive you as the first bride was
[1:14:50] deceived and the second bride was
[1:14:52] deceived they are deceivers of the third
[1:14:55] bride by hybriding the word or trying to
[1:14:58] uh can I say this God never plac signs
[1:15:02] ahead of his
[1:15:03] word he said amen that's a scorcher amen
[1:15:07] but God never placed signs amen ahead of
[1:15:10] his word they were added for proof of
[1:15:12] the word amen but the word was first
[1:15:16] amen the signs and wonders were added
[1:15:18] amen for the proof of the word amen but
[1:15:21] the word was first he said want me to
[1:15:22] prove it to you look at Elijah when he
[1:15:24] went to the woman he said make me a cake
[1:15:27] first amen then watch the miracle happen
[1:15:30] amen come to the word first amen and
[1:15:33] then watch the miracle the seed word
[1:15:35] itself is what the Holy Spirit enteres
[1:15:38] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:15:40] the miracle don't take place on the sign
[1:15:42] the miracle don't take place on the
[1:15:44] Wonder amen the miracle according to a
[1:15:46] prophet the miracle takes place on the
[1:15:49] word he said you begin to believe God's
[1:15:51] word amen and then the Miracle takes
[1:15:54] place on the word because the word is
[1:15:56] the seed that brings forth the miracle
[1:15:58] amen God to take the word first the holy
[1:16:01] spirit gives it life amen like water
[1:16:03] falling from Heaven amen can I say this
[1:16:06] to you amen the Holy Spirit does not
[1:16:08] energize your flesh only it does not
[1:16:11] energize your spirit only amen but the
[1:16:13] Holy Spirit energizes your soul amen and
[1:16:16] the soul is the real you then I tell you
[1:16:19] what we need to do is we need to unclog
[1:16:21] the channel amen of inspiration in our
[1:16:23] soul and let the inspired word amen
[1:16:26] strike the real us amen and let a breath
[1:16:28] of wind come out of our soul it says
[1:16:31] we'll stand with a word if we have to
[1:16:33] stand alone we'll stand with what a
[1:16:35] prophet told if everybody rejects it we
[1:16:38] can't help it we got to stand we got to
[1:16:40] stand church amen I am sufficiently
[1:16:43] impressed with the word that is standing
[1:16:46] in our midst amen the prophet makes it
[1:16:48] very beautiful speaking of David he said
[1:16:50] David was inspired as could be all the
[1:16:52] people was sh shouting and glorifying
[1:16:54] God Amen for a reason that seemed
[1:16:56] exactly scripture but he was the wrong
[1:16:58] person the inspiration should have come
[1:17:00] to Nath and not David he never consulted
[1:17:03] Nathan and do you see what happened see
[1:17:06] God said he does nothing amen till he
[1:17:08] reveals it to his servants the
[1:17:11] prophets and job was this prophet in
[1:17:14] this day now the only thing God had done
[1:17:17] to job what always give him wisdom in
[1:17:19] his word and inspiration but he could he
[1:17:21] could get no inspiration he knowed he
[1:17:23] had all the
[1:17:25] mechanics he had offered the burnt
[1:17:27] offering he had done everything he know
[1:17:29] to do was right but he couldn't get a
[1:17:31] word from God now watch job he cannot
[1:17:34] get a word from God I love this but the
[1:17:37] devil couldn't move him now let me say
[1:17:40] this sometimes you're going to be like
[1:17:42] job and you cannot get a word from God
[1:17:46] Amen so the devil will come in and
[1:17:48] impersonate a sign to give you a word to
[1:17:51] mislead you that's why you've got to be
[1:17:55] sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:17:58] that's in our midst you've got to know
[1:18:00] come on now remember the remember the
[1:18:02] the the the angel light come to to
[1:18:03] Luther I believe it was or Martin and
[1:18:05] said Fall Down and Worship me said
[1:18:07] here's the nails cars said here's the
[1:18:09] crown of thorns he said but I looked at
[1:18:11] him amen and I knew that wasn't God in
[1:18:13] the age he promised to be here in like
[1:18:15] that he said so I knew it was a devil
[1:18:18] amen impersonating God let me just say
[1:18:20] this church amen when you can't get a
[1:18:22] word from God Amen but the devil
[1:18:24] couldn't move him he said now there you
[1:18:26] are when you're prayed for you don't
[1:18:28] have to run back through a line or go
[1:18:29] let somebody else pray for you when you
[1:18:31] know you've done exactly what God Said
[1:18:33] to do see then wait for that channel of
[1:18:36] inspiration to open up to you and now
[1:18:39] I'm Healed and when it drops in there
[1:18:41] then it's all over oh you don't need no
[1:18:43] prayer line nothing else it's over it
[1:18:46] has been revealed to you just like
[1:18:48] Simeon amen the day Simeon received the
[1:18:51] promise I will not die until I see the
[1:18:54] Lord's Christ amen there were many days
[1:18:56] between Simeon and the Fulfillment of
[1:18:58] that promise but never one time amen did
[1:19:00] Simeon let the devil amen bring another
[1:19:03] child in front of him and say this is
[1:19:05] the child amen because Simeon was
[1:19:08] sufficiently impressed amen with the
[1:19:10] inspired word that said you'll not die
[1:19:13] until you have seen the Lord's Christ
[1:19:15] listen you're looking at one country
[1:19:17] preacher amen that is sufficiently
[1:19:19] impressed with the words of the seventh
[1:19:21] angel if he said Church ought to be run
[1:19:23] this way that's the way we're going to
[1:19:24] run it if he said deacons ought to be
[1:19:26] placed this way that's the way we're
[1:19:28] going to place them if he said we ought
[1:19:29] to preach this way that's the way we're
[1:19:31] going to preach come on church amen if
[1:19:33] he said we shouldn't have televisions in
[1:19:34] our home amen then we're not going to
[1:19:36] have them if he said we shouldn't look
[1:19:38] like the world and we're not going to
[1:19:39] look like it and I don't care come hell
[1:19:41] or high water amen we're not going to
[1:19:43] back off and let some sign come in the
[1:19:46] place of this message and lead the
[1:19:48] church now I know where I'm standing
[1:19:50] amen oh God I might as well preach since
[1:19:52] we're here amen I know it's an age where
[1:19:54] people are losing the ability to be
[1:19:57] sufficiently impressed with just
[1:19:58] preaching the message so they get up and
[1:20:00] say well if we just teach the Deep
[1:20:02] things we're going to have an
[1:20:03] intellectual church and we're going to
[1:20:04] lose our young people and we're going to
[1:20:06] dry up and die well I refuse to believe
[1:20:08] that nonsense amen cuz I am a believer
[1:20:11] that wherever you preach this message it
[1:20:13] is the Breath of God listen you're
[1:20:15] looking at somebody that stood in
[1:20:16] churches amen that men told me amen I
[1:20:19] should never even go preach in but I
[1:20:21] went there and preach this message with
[1:20:22] all kinds of funny ideas and stood there
[1:20:25] and declared what a prophet said and
[1:20:27] watched the Breath of God breathe across
[1:20:29] the church and change hearts and lives I
[1:20:32] am an advocate for the preaching of the
[1:20:34] message of the hour listen we can do
[1:20:36] without everything else but we cannot do
[1:20:39] without the message of the hour it's the
[1:20:41] direction to the
[1:20:44] church now I know what I'm talking about
[1:20:46] because it's an age where people think
[1:20:48] now oh God am then now we don't check
[1:20:51] the message we don't check check the
[1:20:53] church by the message we check the
[1:20:54] message by the church so if the message
[1:20:56] teaches against it but we think it's
[1:20:58] okay we just go right on with what the
[1:20:59] church is okay but let me say this how
[1:21:01] long's going to be before we're back in
[1:21:03] Babble and
[1:21:04] confusion come on now brother BR
[1:21:06] preached Church order for a reason it
[1:21:08] wasn't a suggestion it was a it was a it
[1:21:10] was a Vindicated word of a prophet who
[1:21:13] was trying to set the church amen in
[1:21:15] order and he wasn't moving the church
[1:21:17] back into Corinthians he was trying to
[1:21:19] get him into Ephesians we already had a
[1:21:22] Corinthian and he preached an entire
[1:21:24] sermon called the Corinthians the book
[1:21:26] of Correction but then he comes into his
[1:21:28] ministry and said but according to
[1:21:30] Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 we are promised
[1:21:33] another Ephesian he said there'll come
[1:21:35] an understanding in the church amen and
[1:21:38] that understanding will come by the word
[1:21:40] oh thank you Lord Jesus the
[1:21:42] understanding will come by the word and
[1:21:44] job said there is a spirit the
[1:21:47] inspiration of the almighty amen giveth
[1:21:50] him the understanding amen then what is
[1:21:52] bringing the the inspiration or rather
[1:21:54] what is bringing the understanding amen
[1:21:56] is the Breath of God in the Church of
[1:21:58] God which is positionally placed in that
[1:22:01] church amen not in a Pentecostal age
[1:22:03] amen a birth but in an adoption age
[1:22:05] which a prophet called The Bride age
[1:22:07] amen when it's revealed to you that you
[1:22:09] yourself has received God's promis
[1:22:11] inspiration you being Christian amen it
[1:22:14] struck you you don't even need a prayer
[1:22:15] line the only thing you need is an open
[1:22:17] heart when all the mechanics are ready
[1:22:20] and let the inspiration drop in then
[1:22:23] nothing can change your mind you've got
[1:22:25] it nothing can change your mind you've
[1:22:29] got it now listen what brother B said he
[1:22:30] said now notice job he needed a Channel
[1:22:33] of inspiration he had it open but he had
[1:22:36] the channel to communicate with God by
[1:22:38] his inspiration he had a way of moving
[1:22:42] himself out now here's the big problem
[1:22:44] job had a way of moving himself out amen
[1:22:48] and let the word of God move in can we
[1:22:51] say that together move ourself
[1:22:53] out and let the word of God move
[1:22:57] in now you want to fix a bunch of
[1:22:59] confusion move yourself out and let the
[1:23:03] word of God move in the situation you
[1:23:05] want to fix a bunch of false Doctrine
[1:23:07] move yourself out the way and let the
[1:23:09] word move in said we got to move
[1:23:12] ourselves out of the way he said the
[1:23:13] greatest enemy I've got is William
[1:23:15] brandom he's the one that gets in God's
[1:23:17] way he's the one that gets lazy he's the
[1:23:19] one that gets to a place sometimes where
[1:23:21] he thinks he can do something about it
[1:23:23] when he does that shs God right out of
[1:23:25] the picture but when I can get rid of
[1:23:27] that guy when I can get to a place that
[1:23:29] he's H the way then God can come over
[1:23:32] and do things that William brandham
[1:23:34] knows nothing about he said that's when
[1:23:36] God can use you that's when he can use
[1:23:38] any of you he can use anybody who will
[1:23:41] get themsel out of the way but as long
[1:23:43] as we got ourselves in the way then we
[1:23:46] cannot be used of God can I say this
[1:23:48] when we're in the way when we are in the
[1:23:51] way amen we block the inspiration of God
[1:23:54] but when we're out of the way amen then
[1:23:56] the inspired word moves in and does
[1:23:59] things do you realize that's what the
[1:24:01] song service is to do is to get ourself
[1:24:03] out of the way so that the word can come
[1:24:06] in the church and can work effectually
[1:24:08] and mightily Among Us amen y'all imagine
[1:24:11] just walking in out of your cars and
[1:24:13] sitting down and open the Bible and
[1:24:14] start preaching amen your minds on
[1:24:16] everything your mind's on the day your
[1:24:18] mind's on the week your mind's on the
[1:24:20] situation amen but when you be to sing
[1:24:23] the songs of Zion amen a prophet of God
[1:24:25] said a holy ghost filled pianoist in
[1:24:27] church order and a holy ghost filled
[1:24:29] pianoist gets up and begins to play amen
[1:24:32] and begins to begins to drive Devils
[1:24:34] away come on now amen and what you're
[1:24:36] doing is you are creating an atmosphere
[1:24:39] for the word I think Josiah preached on
[1:24:41] it a while back amen creating an
[1:24:43] atmosphere for Revival amen let me ask
[1:24:45] you church amen if we don't create an
[1:24:47] atmosphere amen then the word's going to
[1:24:49] come and it's going to stand in the
[1:24:51] corner with dirty feet amen but if
[1:24:53] somebody amen will let the Holy Ghost
[1:24:55] amen open their eyes to the Revelation
[1:24:58] he's not in a grave in Jerusalem he's
[1:25:01] not in a tomb in je Jeffersonville but
[1:25:03] he's right here this morning in the
[1:25:06] Dynamics of his power in the
[1:25:07] manifestation of his resurrection and
[1:25:10] he's not here as an onlooker he's
[1:25:13] here he's here breathing on the church
[1:25:16] inspiring our hearts Awakening our
[1:25:18] Spirits refreshing Our
[1:25:21] Lives when the word moves in and does
[1:25:23] things brother said now it's a great
[1:25:25] thing to come up here and preach a
[1:25:26] gospel that can make people actually
[1:25:28] that was once a bootlegger and gamblers
[1:25:30] and prostitutes and everything else all
[1:25:32] on the street sit in Heavenly places in
[1:25:34] Christ Jesus and can feel the
[1:25:37] inspiration of the spirit amen to rise

[1:25:42] and scream out
[1:25:45] amen hallelujah praises to God that's a
[1:25:49] wonderful thing now come on Church
[1:25:52] that's a direct quote the Holy Ghost can
[1:25:55] move you and you can feel the
[1:25:57] inspiration of the spirit raise you to a
[1:25:59] place till you lose yourself and scream
[1:26:02] out do you see what happened amen you
[1:26:05] got out of the way so the word could
[1:26:07] move in you got your ideas out of the
[1:26:10] way so the word can move it now come on
[1:26:12] if you're going through something amen
[1:26:14] and in your mind you're trying to fix it
[1:26:16] you're trying to solve it you're trying
[1:26:17] to work it out you don't know how it's
[1:26:19] going to happen what's going to happen
[1:26:20] what's Heen you got all these things on
[1:26:22] your mind amen and you say it in the
[1:26:24] service with that on your mind and the
[1:26:27] preacher stands up and says our God is a
[1:26:29] way maker if yourself is still in the
[1:26:32] way you're going to say well I don't
[1:26:33] know how this is going to happen I don't
[1:26:35] know how it's going to work out amen but
[1:26:37] if you get yourself out of the way and
[1:26:39] the word of God brings over you and says
[1:26:41] God is a way maker amen then without
[1:26:43] your selfcontrol and your praise you're

[1:27:34] assured of Amen knowing of whom thou
[1:27:36] Hast learned
[1:27:38] them can I ask you something where did
[1:27:40] we learn the truth on the word of
[1:27:43] God we learned it by the spirit of truth
[1:27:47] that anointed a prophet so I'm not going
[1:27:50] to get in the last days and start
[1:27:52] questioning my teacher I'm not going to
[1:27:55] get here at the end time and start
[1:27:57] questioning who taught me these things
[1:27:58] listen I'm going to stand on the
[1:28:00] revelation of what I've been taught and
[1:28:02] that from a child thou has known the
[1:28:04] holy scriptures which are able to make
[1:28:06] thee wise under salvation amen through
[1:28:09] faith which is in Christ Jesus look at
[1:28:11] verse 16 of 2 Timothy 3:16 all
[1:28:16] scripture can we say that together all
[1:28:18] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[1:28:23] all scripture is given by the Breath of
[1:28:26] God Amen and is profitable for Doctrine
[1:28:29] for Repro for correction for instruction
[1:28:31] and righteousness now you all going to
[1:28:33] think I'm silly okay but brother Joe I
[1:28:35] looked up the definition of that word

[1:28:40] every any all the whole everyone all
[1:28:44] things
[1:28:47] everything any Scripture the whole
[1:28:50] scripture all scripture everything in
[1:28:53] the scripture oh come on Church any
[1:28:57] Scripture all things in the scripture is
[1:29:00] this truth it's given by the inspiration
[1:29:03] of God in the second seal he said we're
[1:29:05] so glad to to to be living in the day
[1:29:07] that God is revealing itself to us he
[1:29:10] said now all scripture is inspired the
[1:29:12] scriptures must be absolutely the truth
[1:29:14] no way around it let me back up he said
[1:29:16] I believe the great day has just begin
[1:29:17] to Dawn breaking the lights are begin to
[1:29:19] flash the birds of paradise has begin to
[1:29:21] sing in the Saint's heart they know that
[1:29:23] it isn't long now something's going to
[1:29:26] happen it's just got to now all
[1:29:28] scripture is inspired the scriptures
[1:29:30] must be absolutely be the truth no way
[1:29:33] around it there's where I different with
[1:29:34] our Catholic friends I believe that it
[1:29:36] was not written by just mere man I
[1:29:38] believe it was moved by the Holy Spirit
[1:29:41] and all these little things that has
[1:29:43] been added tried to add to it did you
[1:29:45] notice in the solving up the way
[1:29:46] everyone was kicked out these real true
[1:29:49] scriptures amen dovetail one with the
[1:29:51] other till there's no contradiction in
[1:29:54] them nowhere at all again he said Jesus
[1:29:57] said all scripture is inspired and not
[1:30:00] one bit of it can keep from being
[1:30:01] fulfilled there is no way Amen to keep
[1:30:04] the scriptures from being fulfilled can
[1:30:06] I give you another one he said I believe
[1:30:08] that Jesus Christ keeps every word all
[1:30:11] scripture is inspired I don't believe we
[1:30:13] have one right and we'll be condemned
[1:30:15] forward if we add one word to it or take
[1:30:18] one word from it let me say this nobody
[1:30:20] amen will take the script scriptures and
[1:30:22] add to or take away amen and say say I'm
[1:30:25] okay in it but I tell you what they do
[1:30:27] do is they take the message and they
[1:30:29] hack here and they hack there and they
[1:30:32] trim his and they add this and say now
[1:30:34] here's the direction can I tell y'all
[1:30:36] something amen by Bible says that Moses
[1:30:39] gathered him up on the mountain and said
[1:30:41] this day I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:30:42] record against you don't you add to or
[1:30:45] take away from one thing that I've said
[1:30:47] amen and brother brandham stood and said
[1:30:49] as Moses did so do I don't you add two
[1:30:52] or take away one thing amen from what's
[1:30:55] in this quot what's in this tapes let me
[1:30:57] say this friends I think it's high time
[1:30:59] Amen to throw our scissors away I think
[1:31:01] it's high time Amen to throw our cookie
[1:31:03] coat or clutch away I think it's time to
[1:31:06] come back and just say what a prophet
[1:31:08] said and let the Breath of God blow
[1:31:10] across the church and Inspire the church
[1:31:12] with a fresh reality with a fresh
[1:31:14] anointing with a fresh Vision oh church
[1:31:17] of living God it's time to get back to
[1:31:20] just saying what a prophet said and let
[1:31:22] it have influence in the church that
[1:31:23] believes what he
[1:31:26] said we're living in another day now I
[1:31:29] tell you where that Spirit come from
[1:31:30] that Spirit was around in brother b's
[1:31:32] day that Spirit of cutting and hacking
[1:31:34] and putting together and
[1:31:36] showing I know what I'm talking about I
[1:31:39] know exactly where I'm standing it's a
[1:31:42] spirit brother tells a story y'all
[1:31:45] remember he said that woman fell sick
[1:31:46] her son Kevin her son was over there
[1:31:48] overseas and she got real sick so they
[1:31:50] went down there and checked on her
[1:31:52] and they said you need prayer so they
[1:31:54] went in prayed for him they said now
[1:31:55] where's your son she said well he's
[1:31:57] actually away in Ministry he's studying
[1:31:59] they said well you're dying so you need
[1:32:01] to call for him so she called for her
[1:32:03] son to come home and he couldn't get
[1:32:06] there in time so a few days later he
[1:32:08] gets a postcard and the postcard says
[1:32:10] you know hey doing good God bless you
[1:32:12] honey see when you get home so when he
[1:32:14] gets home he walks in he says mom he
[1:32:16] says now you were dying he said I
[1:32:18] couldn't get here he said but now you're
[1:32:20] well what happened she said well honey
[1:32:22] said the local gospel Full Gospel Church
[1:32:25] not the local part gospel the local Full
[1:32:28] Gospel that believed all scripture any
[1:32:31] Scripture everything in the scripture
[1:32:33] all things in the scripture the whole
[1:32:36] thing amen they believed in it and they
[1:32:38] come down there and they prayed for me
[1:32:40] according to Mark 16 she said well honey
[1:32:42] he read it right out of the Bible these
[1:32:44] signs shall follow them that believe if
[1:32:46] they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:32:47] shall recover and she said I believe
[1:32:49] that in God healed me he said mother
[1:32:52] that was Mark 16 he was reading from I
[1:32:54] said yes said well you see in the
[1:32:56] Seminary we learned amen that Mark 16
[1:32:59] from the ninth verse on is not inspired
[1:33:02] and she said Glory
[1:33:04] Hallelujah herself was out of the way
[1:33:07] and the word had moved in she could not
[1:33:10] control her response to the word she
[1:33:12] said Glory Hallelujah why he said mother
[1:33:15] you begin to act like those people shame
[1:33:16] on you said what's the matter with you
[1:33:18] said I was just thinking thinking son do
[1:33:21] you mean to tell me that Mark the 16th
[1:33:23] chapter of God's Bible from the 9th
[1:33:25] verse on is not inspired said no it
[1:33:27] isn't mother it was put in there by a
[1:33:29] false witness now can I tell you how far
[1:33:31] that spirit will take you it'll take you
[1:33:33] to even saying the one that spoke it was
[1:33:35] a false witness come on go read Mark 16
[1:33:38] it's not in Black letters it's in Red
[1:33:40] Letters which means it was the literal
[1:33:42] words that was recorded from the lips of
[1:33:44] Jesus Christ and they call that a false
[1:33:47] witness she said well praise the Lord he
[1:33:49] said what's the matter with you mom said
[1:33:51] I was just just thinking if God could
[1:33:53] heal me with the uninspired word then
[1:33:56] what could he do with that which is
[1:33:57] really
[1:33:59] inspired if he could heal me with the
[1:34:02] uninspired word then what could he do
[1:34:04] with that which's really inspired that's
[1:34:06] it see we have to believe all God's word
[1:34:09] is inspired and it all has its right
[1:34:12] meanings so all of the false conceptions
[1:34:14] of the earth which looks real and looks
[1:34:17] so reasonable is only a perverted Act of
[1:34:20] the devil from the original plan of God
[1:34:23] I think we ought to Pastor that quote
[1:34:24] all over the social media amen we have
[1:34:26] to believe all God's word is inspired
[1:34:29] and it has all its right meanings so all
[1:34:32] of the false conceptions of the earth
[1:34:34] which looks real and looks so reasonable
[1:34:37] is only a perverted Act of the devil
[1:34:39] from the original plan of God he said
[1:34:41] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:34:43] every word that proceedeth how the mouth
[1:34:46] of God can I tell you what a prophet
[1:34:48] said he said in Mark 16 is just as in
[1:34:51] inspired as John 3:16 he said thus Satan
[1:34:55] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:34:57] at Pentecost with the power of God Mark
[1:35:00] 16 and action is the true church amen
[1:35:03] that Jesus claims as his own all else is
[1:35:06] false it has to be don't get mad at me
[1:35:09] but any spirit that says Mark 16 is a
[1:35:12] false witness amen is a false spirit
[1:35:15] amen and any spirit that says this
[1:35:17] message is a false witness of the power
[1:35:20] of God in the AG we're living in it's a
[1:35:22] false
[1:35:24] witness come on now Mark 16 is the sign
[1:35:28] of the true church now can I can I just
[1:35:30] I'm I'm I'm going to tie this together
[1:35:32] but sister cim I got to thinking amen
[1:35:34] Mark 16 the verse they chose was the nth
[1:35:37] verse they said from the ninth verse on
[1:35:40] brother Shi that's not even inspired so
[1:35:42] being the guy I am amen I want to know
[1:35:44] what the ninth verse said so I went over
[1:35:46] to Mark 16:9 read it and here's what it
[1:35:48] said now when Jesus was risen early the
[1:35:51] first day of the week he appeared first
[1:35:54] to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had
[1:35:57] cast Seven
[1:35:59] Devils from the verse Oh God from the
[1:36:03] verse of his appearing at the
[1:36:05] resurrection that brought a Deliverance
[1:36:08] into her life they say from that verse
[1:36:10] on is uninspired so from that oh God so
[1:36:13] they're saying from the time he appeared
[1:36:15] on everything is uninspired amen you see
[1:36:19] they were teaching his appearing to Mar
[1:36:21] Magdalene was a false witness but here's
[1:36:24] the problem Mary Magdalene was a true
[1:36:26] witness so the false witness could not
[1:36:29] defeat her testimony because she was the
[1:36:31] one that had the Seven Devils she was
[1:36:34] the one that knew the torment of the
[1:36:36] enemy she was the one that was bound but
[1:36:39] she was also the one that had recognized
[1:36:41] his appearing in the age she was living
[1:36:44] in and when she oh God hallelujah when
[1:36:47] she recognized his appearing amen what
[1:36:49] did he say he said
[1:36:51] receive ye the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:36:54] whosoever sins you shall remit they
[1:36:56] shall be remitted and whoever sins you
[1:36:58] shall retain shall be retain in other
[1:37:00] words his breath amen was more than just
[1:37:02] a breath amen it was an authority coming
[1:37:05] in the church and listen Faith
[1:37:06] Tabernacle I believe there's some end
[1:37:08] time word Believers here that will not
[1:37:10] back off of this message they will not
[1:37:12] receive false accusation they will not
[1:37:14] bow their KN is something that's
[1:37:16] reasonable probable looks good they will
[1:37:18] stand on the infallible thus sayith the
[1:37:21] Lord and back every devil in hell up cuz
[1:37:23] we have seen the
[1:37:25] [Music]
[1:37:26] Lord we have seen the Lord we recognized
[1:37:30] his
[1:37:31] appearing now you saider what are you
[1:37:34] getting at the word of the Lord comes to
[1:37:35] the prophet the inspiration of the day
[1:37:37] and age comes to the prophet of that age
[1:37:39] Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do
[1:37:41] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[1:37:44] his servants the prophet Revelation 3:14
[1:37:48] un the angel now now let's not read this
[1:37:51] just like a Baptist this
[1:37:52] morning no offense under the angel of
[1:37:56] the church L of sins right these things
[1:37:58] say the amen the faithful true witness
[1:37:59] the beginning the creation of God the
[1:38:01] what that that's the way they read it
[1:38:03] but today we can read it like this under
[1:38:06] William Mary and
[1:38:08] brandham is that okay the angel symbol
[1:38:12] has been revealed we now have a personal
[1:38:16] identification to the symbol of the
[1:38:19] Church of the leans write these things
[1:38:21] saith the amen the faithful the true
[1:38:23] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:38:26] God I wish I could preach this morning
[1:38:29] in other words the God that was in the
[1:38:31] beginning I'm not saying that to you I'm
[1:38:33] saying to myself the God that was in the
[1:38:35] beginning has come all the way to the
[1:38:37] end time and the same God that was
[1:38:40] breathing in the creation there has
[1:38:43] returned in the last days and is
[1:38:44] breathing once again in the creation
[1:38:47] here and the prophet said Remember the
[1:38:49] message is promised and when all these
[1:38:51] Mysteries has been so bundled up by a
[1:38:54] bunch of Ecclesiastes ecclesiastical it
[1:38:56] will take a direct profit from God to
[1:38:59] reveal it listen now remember the word
[1:39:01] of the Lord comes to the prophet not the
[1:39:03] Theologian the word of the Lord comes to
[1:39:06] the prophet amen not the Theologian you
[1:39:08] want to scare the socks off of me tell
[1:39:10] me some man is a theologian in this
[1:39:15] message I mean just be honest with you
[1:39:17] you want you want to you want to make me
[1:39:18] uncomfortable in the conversation is
[1:39:20] tell me some man is a theologian and
[1:39:22] he's got all the information all the
[1:39:24] understanding and we ought to submit to
[1:39:26] what he says amen I'll tighten up on you
[1:39:28] quicker than a turtle goes in his shell
[1:39:30] amen because the word of the Lord does
[1:39:32] not come to your Theologian it comes to
[1:39:34] the prophet he is a reflector of God's
[1:39:36] word listen and he cannot say nothing he
[1:39:39] can't say his own thoughts he can only
[1:39:42] speak what God reveals listen friends
[1:39:44] that's why I say say What's on them
[1:39:46] tapes it's not the faults of William
[1:39:49] brandom it's not the suggestions of
[1:39:51] William brandom it's what God thinks
[1:39:53] about the word he could only say what
[1:39:55] was spoken to him by God even the
[1:39:57] prophet balam when he was trying to be
[1:39:59] sold sell his right he said How can any
[1:40:01] Prophet say anything but what God puts
[1:40:02] in his mouth it's a thing that God does
[1:40:05] and you can't say nothing else you're
[1:40:08] born that way listen friends William
[1:40:10] brandom was born Amen to say what God
[1:40:13] told him to say make fun of me ridicule
[1:40:16] me if you want to but I was born to say
[1:40:19] what a prophet said not change it one
[1:40:22] bit not add to it take away from it put
[1:40:24] all my studies together and present it
[1:40:26] to the church as a new way to go and do
[1:40:29] things I say what a prophet
[1:40:31] said now I'm I'm I'm going to preach it
[1:40:33] for a second we're going to go home okay
[1:40:35] because it's a danger in the last days
[1:40:37] didn't Timothy R and say these words he
[1:40:39] said perilous time shall come didn't I
[1:40:41] say that brother perilous time shall
[1:40:42] come so in the last days there's a
[1:40:45] danger and the danger is uninspired
[1:40:47] leadership the prophet of God said it's
[1:40:49] been always these time a group of lead
[1:40:50] leaders that gets all people mixed up
[1:40:53] it's not so much the people it's the
[1:40:56] leaders that get them mixed up you say
[1:40:58] oh brother brandom well now listen can I
[1:41:00] can I oh God I'm going get in trouble
[1:41:02] can I tell you how America how how you
[1:41:04] could fix a lot of problems in America
[1:41:06] let me tell you if you take the leaders
[1:41:09] behind closed doors and sit down on both
[1:41:11] sides and solve
[1:41:14] it is that okay if you get the leaders
[1:41:17] together and say now your party's got
[1:41:19] this Pew of you and our part and work it
[1:41:22] out but you know why you got people
[1:41:25] screaming vulgar things you know why you
[1:41:27] got people shooting and stabbing is
[1:41:30] because somebody involved people in a
[1:41:32] fight they should have never been a part
[1:41:34] of come on church and what's happening
[1:41:37] in the natural the devil will try in the
[1:41:40] spiritual said watch it's the leaders
[1:41:42] that get the people mixed up now you
[1:41:43] know what happens don't you is somebody
[1:41:45] gets up and sets a direction apart from
[1:41:48] what the prophet T so somebody down the
[1:41:50] road say well the prophet said so he
[1:41:52] corrects that guy and now that guy's
[1:41:54] correcting this guy are y'all hearing me
[1:41:56] and before long everybody's correcting
[1:41:57] everybody and ain't nobody correcting
[1:41:59] the situation and you got a bunch of
[1:42:01] Crossfire in the church and people are
[1:42:03] literally dying by confusion but the
[1:42:06] prophet of God said here's what happened
[1:42:07] is is uninspired leadership is what done
[1:42:11] it amen uninspired leadership now watch
[1:42:13] the theologians uninspired leadership
[1:42:15] that's why they called Mark 16
[1:42:17] uninspired is there uninspired
[1:42:19] themselves but now watch theologians
[1:42:21] uninspired leadership say the same thing
[1:42:24] about his appearing in the last
[1:42:27] day hence forth second Timothy 4:8 there
[1:42:30] is laid up for me a crown of
[1:42:31] righteousness which the Lord the
[1:42:33] righteous dud shall give me at that day
[1:42:35] and not to me only but unto all them
[1:42:37] also that love he is appearing now look
[1:42:42] at this word appearing it's appearance
[1:42:44] often used to the Glorious manifestation
[1:42:46] of the Gods and especially of their
[1:42:47] Advent to help in the New Testament in
[1:42:49] the New Testament the Advent of Christ
[1:42:51] not only that which is already taken
[1:42:53] place by which his presence and power
[1:42:55] appear in the saving light he is sh upon
[1:42:57] mankind but also the illustrtion return
[1:43:00] from Heaven to Earth to occur in the
[1:43:03] future now John brother said John was so
[1:43:05] sure he was going to see the Messiah
[1:43:08] till he said he's in our midst now now
[1:43:11] watch there's a big difference in the
[1:43:13] sign of Jesus appearing and Jesus coming
[1:43:16] there's two different words means two
[1:43:17] different things the appearing of the
[1:43:18] Lord the coming of the Lord now watch
[1:43:20] now the appearing of the Lord is now
[1:43:23] when he's appearing in his people his
[1:43:25] spirit is working among them proving
[1:43:27] that it's him with them getting them
[1:43:28] ready for the Rapture for the come of
[1:43:29] the Lord to catch away his bride the
[1:43:31] appearing the the appearing and the
[1:43:32] coming from that time 62 you all know
[1:43:34] this quote by heart my Ministry is
[1:43:36] different I'm a pastor teacher I'm not
[1:43:38] I'm if I say anything wrong Brethren
[1:43:39] forgive me I don't mean to but this is
[1:43:41] my Ministry is to declare him he's
[1:43:45] here in other words my
[1:43:48] Ministry in John 20 he stood there
[1:43:51] himself and said I'm in your midst in
[1:43:54] the days of John the Baptist John stood
[1:43:55] on the banks or in the river and looked
[1:43:57] upon the banks and said behold the
[1:43:59] messiah's come in this day brother BR
[1:44:01] said now watch he said I'm declaring
[1:44:03] he's here so John the Baptist brother
[1:44:05] brandham both Ministries fulfilled the
[1:44:07] prophesied comings of Elijah
[1:44:09] right one was the third coming one was
[1:44:12] the fourth coming but now watch both
[1:44:14] Ministries were ministries of
[1:44:17] introduction they were forerunning the
[1:44:20] the coming of the Messiah now can I can
[1:44:23] can you look at Hebrews 6:20 with me in
[1:44:25] Hebrews 620 the Bible says this whether
[1:44:28] the Forerunner is for us entered even
[1:44:30] Jesus which is made a high priest
[1:44:32] Forever After the order of MDC now look
[1:44:36] at this word Forerunner it is a
[1:44:38] forerunner especially one who is sent
[1:44:40] before to take observation to act as a
[1:44:43] spy to scout a light armed Soldier one
[1:44:47] who comes in advanced now watch this one
[1:44:50] who comes in advance to a place where
[1:44:53] the rest are to follow so brother Bill
[1:44:56] the Forerunner goes before in the place
[1:44:58] but then there's some more that's to
[1:45:00] follow and them said my mission I
[1:45:02] believe to the Earth is what to forerun
[1:45:04] the coming word see the coming word
[1:45:06] which is Christ and Christ in him has
[1:45:08] the Millennium and has everything right
[1:45:10] there because he is the word he said how
[1:45:13] can a messenger sent from God just
[1:45:16] believe some of the scripture and not
[1:45:17] all the word deny part of it the true
[1:45:20] prophet of God will proclaim the word in
[1:45:22] the last days denominations will hate
[1:45:25] him but he will not pull any punches on
[1:45:27] them he will be like he was when he come
[1:45:29] the first coming of Christ you
[1:45:31] generation of opers but the
[1:45:32] predestinated will hear and will make
[1:45:35] ready for the count down amen y y'all
[1:45:38] hear this remember say we we we we're
[1:45:40] going to have a forerunner and he's
[1:45:41] going to go Advance he's going to go
[1:45:43] before and what he's going to do is he's
[1:45:44] going to check there now what he checks
[1:45:46] others are going to follow y'all
[1:45:48] remember talked about going swimming as
[1:45:50] a kid he said we go down there at the
[1:45:51] swimming hole and sister Jane he said we
[1:45:54] didn't hardly have no clothes he said
[1:45:55] we'd take off running down there he said
[1:45:57] when we got down there he said I was
[1:45:59] always the first one in the water now
[1:46:00] some people take it as stories I take it
[1:46:02] as scriptural uh scriptural illustration
[1:46:05] he said I was the first one in the water
[1:46:07] he said I had a nail Mark he had that
[1:46:09] nail wrapped around that overall and he
[1:46:10] said I pulled the nail the clothes went
[1:46:12] he said I was the first one in the water
[1:46:14] he said now when I jumped in the water
[1:46:16] he said here's what I do he said if the
[1:46:18] water was cold I'd hang up one hold up
[1:46:20] one finger and say wait a second he said
[1:46:23] but if the water was just right he said
[1:46:25] I held up two fingers and I said it was
[1:46:27] good come on in now watch this he said
[1:46:29] in everything clothes go to scattering
[1:46:31] everybody would be in the message I mean
[1:46:33] everybody would be in the
[1:46:35] pool and brother I'm telling you now to
[1:46:38] you guys that's never been in the pool

[1:46:42] just right jump into it and find out you
[1:46:45] will find out it's wonderful the spirit

[1:47:38] not deceived Hallelujah we know in whom
[1:47:43] we have believed listen John 20 and I'm
[1:47:46] closing on this point I promise John
[1:47:48] 20:22 when he had said this he breathed
[1:47:50] on them and saith unto them receive ye
[1:47:53] the holy ghost look at this word breathe
[1:47:56] to blow or breathe upon whether Jesus
[1:47:57] after the manner of the Hebrew prophets
[1:48:00] expressed where Jesus after the manner
[1:48:03] of the Hebrew prophets expressed by the
[1:48:05] symbolic Act of breathing upon the
[1:48:06] apostles the communication of the power
[1:48:10] of the Holy Spirit to them this word's
[1:48:12] only used once by the lxx translator in
[1:48:14] Genesis 2:7 where God breathed on Adam
[1:48:17] and he became a living Soul just as the
[1:48:20] original are you ready for
[1:48:22] this just as the original creation was
[1:48:26] completed by an act of God so to the new
[1:48:29] creation was completed by an act from
[1:48:32] the head of the new
[1:48:34] [Music]
[1:48:37] creation
[1:48:38] headship is
[1:48:42] here the same one that breathed in the
[1:48:45] beginning has come to the
[1:48:48] end on now
[1:48:51] he breathed on creation brother Shmi and
[1:48:54] what you see out there today is the
[1:48:57] completion of the Breath of God in the
[1:49:00] First Act of
[1:49:01] Creation listen Church the valley of dry
[1:49:05] bones you ever been there you ever got

[1:49:18] couldn't shout like he used to yeah you
[1:49:21] know what the Bible said there was a
[1:49:22] valley of dry bones and the Bible said

[1:49:59] gets some bones over here and carries
[1:50:00] them over here and that's his kingdom of
[1:50:01] Bones and before long it's just bones
[1:50:03] and none of the bones together to
