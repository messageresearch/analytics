[37:11] failures Lord and bless the ministering
[37:15] of your word as well as the hearing now
[37:18] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[37:21] says amen and amen you can have your
[37:25] seats
[37:28] I don't really have a uh just a whole
[37:31] lot just a simple subject tonight and
[37:35] and um really didn't know how to title
[37:38] it I just put alone with
[37:41] God and um I guess just been uh just for
[37:46] me uh uh thinking here this week and but
[37:50] you know as um as Christians and uh we
[37:55] we
[37:57] we go through many things in life and
[37:59] and especially in this the age that
[38:01] we're living in it just seems like
[38:03] there's just uh
[38:05] everything uh that is uh there to
[38:08] challenge our faith challenge Our
[38:12] Testimony there to challenge our
[38:14] experience in God and um and you know
[38:19] just it's just a constant challenge of
[38:21] of of everything everywhere we turn
[38:24] there's always a challenge
[38:27] and and I'm sure you young people as
[38:29] well experien these things whether it be
[38:33] at school or um at at the job or
[38:37] whatever um there there are just so many
[38:40] spirits that are out there today and uh
[38:44] we are we are the uh
[38:48] minority a lot of people speak of
[38:50] minority well we we really truly are the
[38:54] minority and and uh um you know thinking
[38:58] of the preservation of how um you know
[39:02] that man has tried to preserve whether
[39:04] it be animals and because they've come
[39:07] close to extinction or trees you know
[39:10] thinking of uh you know uh Heather and I
[39:13] had uh years ago went uh up there to
[39:17] where them big old trees are redwood
[39:19] trees I guess what they call them huge
[39:22] trees and they they said you know that
[39:25] there were uh uh thousands of Acres of
[39:29] them and and uh the woodsmen started
[39:33] just cutting them down just left and
[39:34] right cutting them down you know and so
[39:36] someone went to the government and there
[39:39] was them you know the uh Tree Huggers or
[39:42] whatever and uh you know but they they
[39:45] fought for preservation of these trees
[39:47] which in one sense I'm glad they did so
[39:49] we got to see a tree that I you know
[39:52] huge and uh but uh uh there's there's
[39:56] lot of things that we're trying to
[39:57] preserve in this life but if if there's
[40:01] anything that preservation really means
[40:05] uh much in to us and that is Christian
[40:09] preservation that God uh uh didn't bring
[40:12] us this far to L us he didn't he didn't
[40:16] save us just to uh for us to go extinct
[40:21] but but God has a way of
[40:24] preserving and you know we we uh we Face
[40:28] challenges in our experience of being
[40:31] saved and and having the Holy Ghost and
[40:34] I think most of us probably go through
[40:37] certain things I know even brother Bram
[40:39] talks about how that he didn't at one
[40:41] point he felt like he just wasn't called
[40:43] to preach you know and he was going
[40:45] through a dry time a a testing time and
[40:49] or whatever you would want to call it
[40:50] but we all go through them and and uh
[40:54] even you know having the the holy Holy
[40:56] Ghost and it it doesn't you know we talk
[40:59] about being an invincible Army and and
[41:01] that's true but to prove that we we
[41:04] still go through challenges and we we
[41:06] just go through it doesn't take away our
[41:08] human Humanity so we have our ups and
[41:12] downs and a a man a person not realizing
[41:17] it can go through so much in life and in
[41:21] in different ways uh that he actually
[41:25] becomes hard
[41:26] he can become callous in his spirit and
[41:30] uh he can become numb to the things that
[41:34] uh uh uh that he goes through also we we
[41:39] have we're living in an age where
[41:41] there's just it's just hustle and bustle
[41:44] I think that's the right phrase that
[41:45] they would use just go go go go do do do
[41:50] do and it just seems like the moment we
[41:53] hit our feet Hit the Floor go go go you
[41:55] know went not enough hours in the day
[41:58] even though they're still the same 24
[42:00] hours that it was when you know we
[42:02] didn't have the cars and the electric
[42:04] and all that but somehow it has made our
[42:07] world faster in our our just our lives
[42:12] uh faster and um and it's really just
[42:15] hard to catch up we just go go go go go
[42:18] and with that then we we have a uh a
[42:22] tendency
[42:23] to uh uh leave
[42:26] uh fellowship with God behind and um say
[42:31] a little prayer as we're eating a
[42:32] biscuit on the road you know or uh
[42:35] saying prayer you know as we're driving
[42:37] down the road getting to where we're
[42:39] going and it it's just you know it's
[42:42] it's it's a uh but
[42:45] unintentionally uh we leave off the
[42:48] true the true thing and that is
[42:51] fellowship with God we can even go to
[42:54] church we can we we can be a pastor
[42:57] preacher we can be musicians we can be
[42:59] diligent in the things of God and still
[43:02] leave off the main thing and that is
[43:03] fellowship with God and uh brother
[43:07] brandham even tells us that even as a
[43:09] pastor he said you pastors don't get too
[43:10] busy to where you can't take time for
[43:13] God and fellowship but we we we have
[43:17] these dry spells and um I think we all
[43:20] go through seasons in our life and um
[43:24] sometimes these seasons can can be long
[43:28] uh but uh church church each every
[43:31] Church goes through them uh families
[43:34] individuals
[43:36] Ministries uh we all go through our
[43:39] seasons of of droughts of seasons of of
[43:43] things but it's in these times that we
[43:45] really need the Lord and and we need to
[43:49] to to know that we have access to God in
[43:53] in these times and uh um it's it's not
[43:57] that we're lost even though Satan tries
[43:59] his best to convince us that we are or
[44:02] that we the experience that we've
[44:04] claimed to have isn't really wasn't
[44:06] really real and and so uh which he's
[44:09] he's he's he's just a liar but but we
[44:12] all we all need a
[44:15] renewing do you believe that we we all
[44:18] need a time a place of of renewing
[44:23] and this this word renew
[44:26] uh according to Webster is to make like
[44:28] new to restore to freshness and even
[44:33] though we we've got the message of the
[44:35] hour uh uh we still have times that
[44:39] we've got to just we just need that
[44:42] renewing uh with God and sometimes uh we
[44:46] can run out of steam if you want to say
[44:49] it that way I don't call it burnt out
[44:52] but I do I I think it's just seasons in
[44:54] our life that
[44:56] that you know uh uh sometimes you're on
[44:59] the mountain sometimes you're in the
[45:01] valley sometimes you're uh feel like you
[45:04] know your prayers are getting through
[45:06] sometimes you feel like your prayers are
[45:07] bouncing to the ceiling you know and and
[45:10] uh uh it it it's just all of these times
[45:14] but but a renewing and I I you know I I
[45:17] think as a church as just all of us as
[45:21] an individual we must not fail to to
[45:25] real realiz that
[45:27] that it's not that God has left us it's
[45:31] not that God is is done it's not that
[45:34] we've we've wored up in in you know on
[45:37] the bank so to speak but it's just that
[45:40] we need to take time to be renewed with
[45:43] God and we
[45:51] cannot life life daily situations must
[45:56] not control us because we are a
[46:00] different breed of
[46:01] people life will kill you the demands of
[46:06] life will kill you people will get so
[46:08] stressed out that they don't know what
[46:10] to do we we've got them taking nerve
[46:13] pills and taking all kinds of things and
[46:16] and it's because is is is life has put
[46:20] demands upon us that really shouldn't be
[46:24] and and I think it's just the condition
[46:26] of the world a lot of these things is
[46:29] coming from
[46:31] unregenerated people whether it be our
[46:33] boss that is demanding overtime
[46:36] constantly or whether it's just uh uh
[46:40] whether it's government or they're
[46:42] raising you know it's just seems like
[46:44] you can't get you can't get bills paid
[46:47] and and uh make ends meat seems and and
[46:52] I I think it's a I think there I think
[46:54] it's all whether whether they realize it
[46:56] or not I know that I believe it's the
[46:59] devil uh that is getting all this up uh
[47:03] trying to make where to where there's no
[47:05] home life anymore uh to where the woman
[47:09] has to get out and work can't have time
[47:11] for the children the children don't know
[47:12] what a home life is cuz Mom and Dad are
[47:15] just too busy and and and yet it seemed
[47:19] like the more people work uh the more
[47:21] stressful it
[47:22] gets and and which tells that money is
[47:26] not the answer uh vacations are not the
[47:30] answer uh nothing against any of that
[47:33] it's just not the answer uh not for a
[47:36] Christian because what what we're trying
[47:39] to do is preserve we're trying to
[47:42] preserve something we're trying to
[47:43] preserve that life that's within us just
[47:46] as much as as as you know uh so so uh uh
[47:53] the this thing of the world I I thought
[47:55] like brother brand I'm talking of uh
[47:57] very at at the time of Exodus for Moses
[48:00] well well Pharaoh started attacking the
[48:03] children we know that the little
[48:05] children then he put women to work and
[48:07] and it was just constantly he was
[48:09] attacking the people of God and and to
[48:13] where they were just so busy with things
[48:16] and church we're not of this
[48:18] world and and I I might not be too
[48:22] popular in what I'm saying tonight but
[48:25] uh I I still believe it I still believe
[48:27] that there's got to be family values I I
[48:30] still believe that there's Mar marriage
[48:33] values I I still believe that we've got
[48:36] to have time for one another I believe
[48:38] that we've got to be what God has called
[48:40] us to be do you believe that and and and
[48:45] uh but but when when when we're so
[48:49] stretched out again because we're trying
[48:52] to meet the demands of life then what do
[48:55] we do
[48:56] but more than anything it affects our
[48:58] Christian
[48:59] walk
[49:01] um you can you can go to church out of
[49:04] Duty and all of us have gone through
[49:07] these phases yes sir preach just because
[49:10] it's a duty play the music because it's
[49:13] just a duty we go through life sometimes
[49:17] and not even realizing what we're doing
[49:20] but then we find out that we're just
[49:22] needing
[49:23] something well it's not not that that
[49:26] again it's not that you're lost it's
[49:28] nothing there it's just we need that a
[49:31] renewing it's just a time that we need
[49:34] to get with God can you say man because
[49:37] this renewing comes comes by getting
[49:39] alone with God and and and it's it's a
[49:43] place of life that's what it is it's a
[49:46] place where where you know this this
[49:48] place that David was talking about it's
[49:51] a place where where corruption can't set
[49:54] in and take over I know these bodies are
[49:56] getting older but I'm talking about that
[49:58] Soul I'm I'm talking about a joy that
[50:00] can be sustained I'm I'm talking about a
[50:03] peace that can be sustained I'm I'm
[50:05] talking about that inner man that can
[50:07] actually just stay
[50:09] sustained through everything that we're
[50:11] going
[50:13] through yes amen this place that David
[50:18] uh uh spoke of is a sacred place it's a
[50:21] place where God God is and and brother
[50:24] brandom called called it a a hallow
[50:27] place a sacred place but it's also as I
[50:30] believe we read where David called it a
[50:32] secret place which means it's a hidden
[50:35] place and uh which tells us that nobody
[50:39] knows about this place unless they've
[50:42] been there whatever is in that place no
[50:46] one knows no one can uh uh can tell by
[50:50] experience unless they were in there to
[50:54] experience it and so and and no one can
[50:57] find it by itself themselves because
[50:59] it's a secret place that's exactly what
[51:02] David said it's a secret place ain't
[51:04] that right and so how many people have
[51:07] tried to find this place throughout the
[51:10] ages uh and and they sought and they've
[51:13] longed to have this place uh uh uh where
[51:18] God dwells this is the place where God
[51:20] dwells and and yet many many many people
[51:24] no matter how religious no matter how
[51:26] many schools and learning and and titles
[51:29] and all these things that they have and
[51:32] and yet no one no one can find this
[51:35] place it actually takes God bidding us
[51:39] to come now in in Psalm 65 and4 uh uh it
[51:45] says blessed is the man whom thou
[51:47] choosest now I did not give them
[51:49] scriptures ahead of time so they'll have
[51:51] to type it in but blessed is the man
[51:54] whom thou choosest
[51:56] and caus us to approach unto thee so now
[52:00] think of that God has to give the
[52:04] choosing God has to choose and he has to
[52:08] allow that man we we say pull that man
[52:12] uh put something in his heart or bid
[52:15] that man uh uh woo that man to come to
[52:20] him amen that's the only way that we'll
[52:22] find it sir that's the only people conf
[52:25] find it is when God chooses that
[52:28] individual and causes them to approach
[52:30] unto him that he may dwell in thy courts
[52:34] we shall be satisfied with the goodness
[52:36] of thy house that place even of thy
[52:41] Temple so those who are chosen have the
[52:44] opportunity to come into this secret
[52:47] place and dwell there dwell there now
[52:51] Old Testament uh the Old Testament was
[52:53] was types and shadows as as we know and
[52:57] uh so this the mo the Tabernacle of
[53:00] Moses comes to mind when I'm thinking of
[53:03] the secret place and uh uh you know he
[53:08] made this Tabernacle and it had three
[53:11] three sections it was the outer Court
[53:13] where all the congregation could dwell
[53:16] in and and there there were certain
[53:19] things that that was in in in that in
[53:22] that outer court but the light was the
[53:25] sunlight that came right brother Ram
[53:27] talks about it and how that uh uh you
[53:31] know some days were cloudy days some
[53:33] some days sunny days rainy days you know
[53:36] the weather fluctuated in the outer
[53:38] courts you know and and that was the
[53:41] where the majority of the people stayed
[53:43] was in the outer Court you know and they
[53:46] could not go in into this other section
[53:49] but then there was the Holy place where
[53:52] the priests were able to go into that
[53:54] Holy place and and there was the candles
[53:57] and there was certain things in there
[53:59] that they had to officiate and do but
[54:02] that light uh was candle light as as you
[54:06] know as we know and and and that place
[54:09] would get Smoky at times you know and
[54:12] and smoke up and and all that you
[54:15] probably you know as they're trying to
[54:17] officiate their their their their their
[54:20] jobs and their duties and things like
[54:22] that but then but then there was the
[54:24] Veil and then beyond that veil was the
[54:28] the holiest of
[54:30] holies and and that was only a certain
[54:34] person a chosen person could go be in
[54:37] that place and the only light that was
[54:40] there in that place uh was the shanic
[54:44] glory amen where God would come down in
[54:47] a pillar of fire and light the room
[54:50] ain't that right and and that was the
[54:53] hidden Place amen that no man no man
[54:55] could go unless they were chosen to go
[54:58] into that place and and uh uh in that
[55:02] place there was The Mercy
[55:05] Seat and uh I you know uh to think of
[55:09] what God was
[55:12] showing uh
[55:14] foretelling of of this day in my opinion
[55:17] and I know we could go deep in more into
[55:20] all these things and uh but just to
[55:24] maybe just to say stay simple but it was
[55:28] a place that God he would have Moses to
[55:32] build knowing looking for a future you
[55:36] know a future people and and he would
[55:40] like call Aron and he'd tell Aaron you
[55:43] you can go into this place hidden to
[55:45] everybody else nobody else knew but then
[55:48] there there was this this this mercy
[55:51] seat and and you if you can put it up on
[55:54] the screen uh The Mercy Seat I I wanted
[55:58] them to put up a picture that was The
[56:01] Mercy Seat it was a box there and and uh
[56:05] that's what it was like and in that box
[56:07] there was uh certain contents uh the the
[56:10] the law was in that box I believe uh if
[56:14] I'm not mistaken the hidden Mana was in
[56:17] that box was it in the box or there was
[56:20] Aaron's Rod uh but there were certain
[56:23] things that was in that
[56:25] uh in that box there but then there was
[56:29] The Mercy Seat which was the lid to the
[56:32] box and that was the Ark of the Covenant
[56:34] that we hear about uh throughout the
[56:37] Bible and so but but I I thought of that
[56:41] uh there was the wings there was the
[56:43] cherubims that was and you see their
[56:46] wings and and uh uh there and and it
[56:51] covered The Mercy Seat it it was there
[56:53] and uh second or or Exodus 37 and9 it
[56:58] says and the cherubim spread out their
[57:00] wings on high and covered their uh and
[57:04] covered with their wings Over The Mercy
[57:06] Seat with their faces one to another
[57:09] even to The Mercy Seat were uh were the
[57:13] the faces of the
[57:15] cherubims now Paul talks about it in in
[57:19] uh Hebrews
[57:20] 93 he says after the second veil of the
[57:23] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[57:25] of all and he said which had the golden
[57:28] sensor the Ark of the Covenant overlaid
[57:31] round about with gold wherein was the
[57:34] golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod
[57:38] that budded and the tables of the
[57:40] Covenant the word of God that's so them
[57:42] them three that was in that box and then
[57:46] The Mercy Seat laid was the lid and the
[57:49] cherubims he says and over it the
[57:51] cherubims of Glory
[57:53] overshadowing or uh or shadowing The
[57:56] Mercy Seat and and so that Mercy Seat
[58:00] was was something that that and blood
[58:02] would be on that Mercy Seat ain't that
[58:04] right uh the the the priest would
[58:06] sprinkle blood on that mercy seat and uh
[58:11] uh and I thank God for
[58:12] Mercy I I thank God that he would
[58:16] provide a place that we could know his
[58:20] mercy and and and so but then in 1
[58:24] Samuel 4 and4 uh it tells us that the
[58:27] Lord of hosts dwelt between them
[58:30] cherubims that he would come down and
[58:34] and he he would come into that little
[58:37] room and he would abide in in in in
[58:41] between them cherubims even 2 Kings
[58:44] 19:15 declares the same thing Hezekiah
[58:47] prayed before the Lord and said oh Lord
[58:49] God of Israel which dwellest between the
[58:53] cherubims uh uh Psalms 99 And1 he sth
[58:58] between the cherubims and and many
[59:01] scriptures uh uh tell us uh where where
[59:05] God was when he'd come into that room it
[59:07] was there on The Mercy Seat between the
[59:10] cherubims and and so uh brother Bri said
[59:13] see down in between the Arc of the wing
[59:15] arch of the wings of these cherubims was
[59:18] a supernatural light hanging in there
[59:21] which was a Halo of God that Lit the
[59:24] whole room it was a supernatural light
[59:27] well others were getting their light
[59:29] from the sun and others were getting
[59:31] their light from the candles but there
[59:33] was one that was chosen to walk into the
[59:36] place where God would dwell and remember
[59:39] they put Aaron's rod in that place and
[59:43] it budded in the presence of God that
[59:47] Rod come to
[59:49] life it budded and and and not but but
[59:52] also the very God that made that Rod
[59:55] knew where that Rod come from it knew
[59:59] exactly what what what the origin of
[1:00:02] that Rod was so so it wouldn't in other
[1:00:04] words it wasn't a what an arm or a a
[1:00:07] what what I can't remember right away of
[1:00:09] what kind of a uh uh uh uh uh Rod it was
[1:00:14] but it sure didn't bear oranges it
[1:00:15] didn't bear apples it didn't bear
[1:00:18] whatever because almonds amen and and
[1:00:21] see because God knew what it what the
[1:00:23] origin was God knew and God was going to

[1:07:51] all just stood there and watched and
[1:07:52] looked could never enter into that
[1:07:55] experience with God like that priest was
[1:08:00] amen and another thing them cherubims
[1:08:04] they were they stood for a a purpose God
[1:08:08] would have them to make cherubims you
[1:08:10] realize cherubims the prophet said were
[1:08:12] guards that's what they are when God
[1:08:15] drove Adam and Eve out of the garden he
[1:08:18] set cherubims yes that guard to guard
[1:08:22] that tree of life right to where Adam or
[1:08:25] man could not go back in there and
[1:08:27] partake of it because there was
[1:08:29] cherubims Garden them away from it ain't
[1:08:32] that right and and and so but here's now
[1:08:35] these these
[1:08:37] cherubims that are upon The Mercy
[1:08:42] Seat come
[1:08:44] on and brother Braham said they guard
[1:08:46] that shanic
[1:08:48] glory the lord God putting them there as
[1:08:52] a sign that they're guarding this sh
[1:08:54] kind of
[1:08:55] Glory they're guarding the where the
[1:08:58] word is they're guarding that mercy
[1:09:01] seat right and he says then it it goes
[1:09:04] to show you that that not that every

[1:09:17] that what you have should be precious to
[1:09:20] you amen yes sir Hallelujah
[1:09:24] the opportunity that we have should be
[1:09:29] precious sometime we wonder well why
[1:09:32] can't they see
[1:09:33] it why can't others see it why can't
[1:09:36] others get get what they're needing what
[1:09:40] why why are they looking for everything
[1:09:42] else is because there's guards they're
[1:09:45] guarding that amen that's very true
[1:09:48] guarding and and yet you've been called
[1:09:51] to come in and partake of him
[1:09:54] to know that he's the same yesterday
[1:09:56] today and forever and yet there's so
[1:09:58] many people out there in religion that
[1:10:00] don't know that he's the same yesterday
[1:10:02] today and forever because they've never
[1:10:04] partook of it but God has chose you and
[1:10:07] so it it's not every scall Wag that can
[1:10:10] come in there and partake of it you he
[1:10:12] said you've got to pre be prepared
[1:10:15] everybody say be prepared you've got to
[1:10:18] be prepared to come into His presence
[1:10:22] amen you say Amen you've got to be
[1:10:25] prepared before you come into the
[1:10:28] presence of it see so then the one that
[1:10:31] was chosen had to be prepared in order
[1:10:35] to go into this the in into this prescy
[1:10:39] brother Bram said see remember the
[1:10:41] congregation in the days couldn't even
[1:10:42] approach in in couldn't approach it in
[1:10:45] no manner no way see but when Aaron he
[1:10:50] said how many times did he get to go
[1:10:51] into it once a year
[1:10:54] here now you think of that that man even
[1:10:59] though he was chosen to go in once a
[1:11:01] year could he only go in amen
[1:11:06] right come on I say that you don't have
[1:11:08] to wait once a
[1:11:12] year you you don't because Paul would
[1:11:16] tell us let us come before before the
[1:11:19] throne of grace to find help in time of
[1:11:22] need ain't that right come boldly before
[1:11:25] the throne of grace and and the throne
[1:11:27] of grace is The Mercy Seat so this has
[1:11:30] been open to the believer those that
[1:11:33] have been chosen that's why you don't
[1:11:35] look to
[1:11:36] politics good grief that's right why
[1:11:40] would you look to Trump Republican
[1:11:42] Democrat wh why would you look to that
[1:11:44] for your
[1:11:45] answers if you've been bidden to come
[1:11:48] before the throne of
[1:11:50] grace to find help in time of need
[1:11:54] it doesn't matter if they take away all
[1:11:56] of our food is not God the one that can
[1:11:59] provide the
[1:12:01] food and are you not the one to
[1:12:04] experience that he is the same yesterday
[1:12:06] today and forever then why would we
[1:12:08] doubt it why would we look and see that
[1:12:10] he could cause the Mana to come he could
[1:12:12] he could have the Ravens to feed his
[1:12:14] servant but why can't he do it for us
[1:12:17] but you've been bid to come into the
[1:12:20] this holiest secret place that you you
[1:12:23] may see that he's the same yesterday

[1:12:54] and he had to have on certain
[1:12:57] clothes yes sir right and it was made
[1:13:00] with certain hands A A peculiar type of
[1:13:04] clothes so he couldn't just be dressed

[1:21:13] deadly enemies who Compass me
[1:21:16] about Psalms 57
[1:21:20] And1 it it says to the chief
[1:21:23] musician uh whatever he says when he at
[1:21:27] Mitchum of David when he fled from Saul
[1:21:29] in the cave be merciful unto me oh God
[1:21:34] be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth
[1:21:38] in thee yay in the shadow of thy Wings
[1:21:43] will I make my refuge until these
[1:21:47] calamities be
[1:21:49] overpassed can you say
[1:21:51] Amen
[1:21:53] oh do you love the
[1:21:55] Lord so I believe that the spirit of God
[1:21:58] upon David that was upon David was
[1:22:00] calling out for this day
[1:22:04] prophesying as he foresaw a people in
[1:22:07] this day that would be closed that would
[1:22:11] be separated and anointed to where they
[1:22:14] could come into that presence and
[1:22:16] partake of him that's right this is what
[1:22:18] the theme of brother branham's message
[1:22:21] was in his meeting was Jesus Christ the
[1:22:24] same yesterday today and forever amen
[1:22:27] can you say Amen if the musicians will
[1:22:30] come that's good prise the Lord so the
[1:22:33] prophet said here he was anointed went
[1:22:36] in behind that place and they could just
[1:22:38] listen hear them Bells all those that
[1:22:40] were outside all they could do is just
[1:22:42] listen hear the bells such and such but
[1:22:46] Aaron standing in the GL shik of Glory
[1:22:48] by The Mercy Seat where the cherubims
[1:22:51] had their wings tipped over it the
[1:22:54] guards of the mercy seat oh they could
[1:22:56] listen in there how their hearts long to
[1:22:59] go in there holy holy holy unto the Lord
[1:23:03] and know that what it did to Aaron he
[1:23:07] lived from year to year to go in he
[1:23:09] lived to go in that place once a year
[1:23:12] man just longing for that
[1:23:16] place see and how the regular
[1:23:20] congregation couldn't go in yet they
[1:23:22] were Liv living under the blood but yet
[1:23:24] they uh yet not into the shik glory but
[1:23:28] when the True Blood came the blood of
[1:23:30] Jesus Christ God's son he broke down the
[1:23:33] middle wall of partition he tore down
[1:23:35] the curtain from top to
[1:23:39] bottom and now the believer whosoever
[1:23:41] will let him come into the shik kind of
[1:23:43] glory and a man through justification
[1:23:45] believe in the word sanctification clean
[1:23:47] him from his sins he's subject to enter
[1:23:50] into the Pentecostal shikina
[1:23:53] God did the same thing on the day of
[1:23:55] Pentecost when he saved the church
[1:23:58] through such
[1:24:00] justification Romans 51
[1:24:04] sanctification it says uh you know uh St
[1:24:08] John 1717 Jesus said sanctify them
[1:24:11] Father through the truth for Thy word is
[1:24:13] truth but on the day of Pentecost the
[1:24:15] middle wall of partition had been torn
[1:24:17] down the curtain was rent from bottom to
[1:24:19] top or from top to bottom at Calvary and
[1:24:23] the believer entered into that shik
[1:24:26] glory and the power of God fell upon
[1:24:29] them holy holy holy unto the Lord went
[1:24:34] the Praises and glories in unknown
[1:24:36] tongues and out of there they come
[1:24:39] shouting and rejoicing and notice he
[1:24:42] says and that's the only place of
[1:24:46] Fellowship coming into the presence of
[1:24:48] God the shik glory that's the only place
[1:24:52] for Fellowship Lord aren't you glad that
