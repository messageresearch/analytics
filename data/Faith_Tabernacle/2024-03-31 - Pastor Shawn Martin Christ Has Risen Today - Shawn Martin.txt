that the Lord would just bless them abundantly and um just bless future together and um uh met U her fiance and and he just seems to be a nice nice man there and so uh anyway so if you all want to go you are invited to go be April 14th and I don't know if it's going to be right after the service or or what but uh uh anyways April 14th on a Sunday and um she want me to let y'all know that y'all was invited amen so um uh Mark the 16th chapter and the uh first verse we will start there and says and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salom had bought uh sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the seure at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone uh from the door of the scepter and when they looked they saw that the stone was roded away for it was a very uh it was very great and entering into the seure they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were arried and he saith unto them Be not afed Afraid ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee and there shall you see him as he said unto you amen then if you'll turn with me uh the book of Psalms 102 Book of Psalms 102 and um we're going to read um the 16th verse and when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and just ask the Lord to be with us today Father truly we're so thankful for the meaning of this day and what this day is been set aside for and Lord we know that you're alive and that you're well and because of that we ask that you would just come Among Us Lord and anoint my lips father Lord let it be Words of Life help me just to get myself out of the way father and that you would take over and speak to your people I pray that you would anoint the ears and the hearts to hear and receive of you father Lord if there's any sins that are not under the blood we'd pray that you'd forgive us of them oh Father you're are uh our intercessor here and father we just rely upon you today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen you can have your seats today today has of course been set aside to um celebrate the resurrection of our Lord Jesus and so of course it would behoove us to maybe speak about the resurrection and um there there is so much that could be said and that has been said and so I don't think that it' be anything new that we say but just to um uh refresh bring to remembrance uh what it really means to us and um of course Easter is uh more than just buying a new dress or wearing a new hat uh which is all right uh you know uh Easter is some is is it's about something that is new and you know God did something new that day and the prophet said that Easter is a Triumph Easter it it's say it's a victory that God Gave Over the Earth amen so when we look at Easter it's more than just a a church Gathering or a family gathering after service and hunting uh eggs uh but it's a it's victory and and uh it's it's Triumph uh for God raised his own son from the dead that whosoever would believe upon Him should have eternal life and so today when we think of it we wouldn't be here today if he had not risen ain't that right and uh just a a couple scriptures as we go but 1 Corinthians 15:15 says if Christ be not raised then your faith is in vain and you are yet in your sins so if there is no Resurrection then we're gathered here in vain and we we have no right to sing amazing raised we have no right to say that we're Justified if he had not raised everything hinged on the resurrection in the 20th verse but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept uh for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so we know that there for the believer there is a physical resurrection and uh uh for all those that are asleep in Christ and and there is also a spiritual Resurrection uh for the church all those that are in the body of Christ and and uh so which means that that death is under our feet death is in our in our control ain't that right amen and that is all because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ we know that the spiritual Resurrection takes place now and Ephesians 2 and 1 Paul would tell us that you and you ha he quickened who were dead who were dead Amen in trespasses and sins and so everyone of us that have the Holy Ghost that's that's God's proof amen that you have passed from Death un life ain't that right amen and I think this is why Satan fights so hard against the real baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because that is God's proof of Resurrection God's proof amen the old things have passed away and behold all things have become new ain't that right so so the prophet says you're not like you used to be you are changed where you used to doubt God's word now every word that God speaks you say Amen because something has happened to you ain't that right amen and he says that's just the form the first form of the Resurrection uh uh the spirit on the inside and so so we we certainly believe in Resurrection I I I don't believe that Jesus intended for us to build a memorial around the resurrection of of his own resurrection of 2,000 years ago I I think that that's you know uh there's a lot of Easter Plays and which is is just fine and there's a lot of uh uh talk about what happened 2,000 years ago which is is fine we're thankful for that that's the that's the foundation of Christianity is is the resurrection but but we find that that Hebrews 138 Paul would tell us that he's the same yesterday today and forever can you say Amen he's the same yesterday and that was the as we know the theme of brother bram's uh uh uh Ministry he's the same yesterday today and forever and we cannot prove that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen just by talking about what happened 2,000 years ago amen uh to Simply say that he is alive doesn't prove anything Amen to Simply say that he is the same today as he was back then doesn't prove a thing so God doesn't want us just talking about him and and uh in a history lesson or uh uh a theology or or whatever but see God has to prove amen what we are saying ain't that right amen God has to prove by what we are saying by manifesting himself today Amen to show that he is the same yesterday today and forever we can draw a picture of him and say he's the same see he's the same yesterday but that doesn't make him the same yesterday today and forever but when he the person comes the same God that was back then comes in today and does the same works that he done back then then you can know that he's the same yesterday today and forever ain't that right and so it's up to us to prove this it's up to us to to to to uh uh that God could could prove himself now if you will notice in our scripture reading uh there it says that they were at the place amen they they were at the place that they thought he would be at the rising of the sun they thought the last time they saw him he was in a tomb and and so they they went there thinking that's the place he's going to be at at the rising of the Sun amen and and and if you notice they went there not looking for a living Christ amen but they were simply going to pay their respects amen of what they knew of him to be amen of their memory of him what he was to them and and and and so and they done it honestly amen because they didn't know that he had risen amen so everything that they were doing was based upon what he was in the past but they didn't expect him Amen to be alive that that day can you say amen amen so they had come see so then he had become a thing of the past to them a historical figure amen but it was at that place a man that the angel told them he's not here but he is uh risen he is alive ain't that right and then the question was asked them why seek ye the living among the dead ain't that right amen you you you ain't going to find him at a tomb anymore amen because he is alive ain't that right so then we find that he appeared to them Jesus himself appeared to them outside the tomb amen not in the Tomb outside the tomb ain't that right amen outside the place amen and and that word appeared is is to manifest he manifested himself so he showed himself visible to the early risers at the rising of the sun ain't that right I thought uh uh as as you look uh he never showed himself anymore throughout that day amen uh all day long uh through the span he didn't show himself Amen to be alive until the evening time amen but I tell you when they left that tomb they knew that he was alive can you say amen amen they they weren't looking anymore for some Dead uh uh God some historical thing but they knew he was alive and and they were told now go tell go tell them go tell others that I'm alive and that I am risen ain't that right amen see so then then they realized that once they they knew that he was alive then they no longer hung around the tomb amen of of the Dead ain't that right amen that's right and the angel of the Lord never told them to hang around the the tomb amen but told them where to meet him amen where they would see him ain't that right amen you see the angel of the Lord today has never told us to hang around the tombs amen of something that is dead amen that's right you know uh uh the prophet said only the devil hangs around the tombs amen and he d drives people to the tombs a ain't that right amen and and one example is the man of gatera Amen that that when he become possessed of of what 2,000 demons and and things but but it his Dwelling Place become in the tombs ain't that right amen see and and that's where the devil made him hang out and and and so the prophet says see Satan likes to dwell in tombs and hangs around old dead places ain't that right and he says and that don't exclude churches either see he says when they get colder it's a devil's hangout yeah amen and that's why we must never let our church let never let our lives get cold never let our experience get cold amen because that's where the devil loves to hang out can you say amen that's right see amen so dead places are are where he likes to dwell amen so you take a person the Prophet said that does that's dead in sins and trespasses and don't believe in the power of the resurrection of the Lord that's where the devil likes to live amen but how many believes in the in the power of the Resurrection amen see amen you can be tempted and you can be you can have your mind battles and you can go through trials amen but a man that that that has been quickened a man that is no longer dead in trespasses and sins and and truly believes in the power of the resurrection of the Lord amen the devil cannot hang out there can you say Amen I'm so glad for that so brother BR says if you truly want to know amen some of these old cold formal churches that has the form of godliness and denies the power thereof are the real hangout for Devils can you say amen that's right see a place where they say oh that's all work up that's that's all mental that's psychology see he says oh my and some of those Devils don't make you cut yourself they ain't going to make you commit suicide they ain't going to make you drive you to drink and and smoke and and all these things he say some of them is just as shrewd and Polished as they can be they're Scholars see he said and don't think that they're not ain't that right see so so we we look at these things and and and and you could just imagine the people that that were in shock amen when they realized that the one that they thought was dead they had come to build a memorial around and and and cry over and talk about the past and and all these things and find out that he ain't dead after all amen I think that's awesome can you say amen amen see the ones that had killed him and put him in the Tomb notice they were guarding it making sure that he couldn't leave that tomb amen they were making sure that he was dead they were making sure amen that they could have no contact with that body amen and so they were sitting there but God would go past the guards amen God would go past everything Amen to prove his resurrection can you say amen amen he couldn't stay in the Tomb amen see and the prophet would tell us the world put him in a tomb and sealed him up in that tomb and so they were making him a thing of the past amen see amen but then the prophet would tell us that Easter morning ruined all of their theology ruined all of their plans ruined all of their thinking ruined the devil's party amen ruined every skeptic that was saying see he he was just just a normal crazy guy he was just the average guy that was taken just like everybody else does Amen see ruined it all ruined the church's theology ruined the world's theology can you say amen and whatever power they thought they had the resurrection defied every bit of the government's power every bit of the church's power every bit of The Bishop's power the resurrection can you say amen that's right see so as we know amen and it's just by the grace of God that we know by the message of the hour that the world today has been trying to put Christ in a tomb Amen to think of that now they've been trying to keep him amen and and the prophet would call it a Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or you know Pentecostal or we'd say even Apostolic and all of these tombs amen and and to think of this that we were once in a tomb as well ain't that right man brother BR says I I was out of a Baptist tomb and and you might have been in some other tomb and I was in a Pentecostal tomb and and all of that but then we find out that he has risen can you say Amen he's risen and so the only thing that hangs around those type of tombs is the devil and you have to say it just that way ain't that right and he's driving the people to those places can you say amen amen that's right see and only worshiping a god of history and the prophet says they're actually worshiping the God of this world which is Satan and they don't even know it ain't that right amen so the question is is why why would we seek the living among the dead why would we tell the people to go back to their to a denomination why would we tell them oh you know just go soft and easy with it and and well we don't want to offend them and we don't want to there so it's okay you know they may be whatever amen but we really realized by the message of the hour that that's a tomb amen that only holds the dead can you say Amen but if we really believe that Christ is a living we want to point people to a living Messiah do you believe then amen see and so as he proved him Resurrection in the evening time so is he doing it today amen Zechariah 14:6 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that evening time it shall be light can you say amen and the prophet says he takes that scripture he says see God was promising a resurrection God was promising a resurrection see and John 14:19 Jesus says because I live you shall live also Amen to think of that thou amen that I live you shall live also no wonder Jesus doesn't want us just just dwelling Upon A a resurrection of 2,000 years ago what about your Resurrection what about the resurrection of today that we can talk about and and and not talk about from from a history amen or or about what somebody else experience but I have received that same experience that same power of the Resurrection can you say Amen see so the this evening light if if you think of it he said it speaking of a promising a resurrection well this this evening light the prophet would call Messiah light amen so when there would be light would mean that there would be a messiah amen a messiah that would would come forth and and and be revealed ain't that right now and it would be in the evening time and if you just bear with me now amen I want to read there in Luke 24:13 starting there and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emus which was from Jerusalem about three score fur Longs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass while they communed together and reason now Jesus had just died they had just buried him and so they're they're sad and they're talking again they're talking of him in the past it was a past tense God oh I remember when and oh yes I've I remember the stories and I've oh this and oh he was just such a good guy and and they were crying see they they were in despondent they they were discouraged their hope had been been dashed see amen so so they're they're they're talking in that way amen see and he says and as they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with him but their eyes everybody say Their Eyes Were withholden Their Eyes Were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad see amen so so many people are sad today amen when religion should uh uh Christianity should be joyful man see and he says and one of them uh uh whose name was Copus and answering and unto said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem see and hast thou not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them one things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a mighty Prophet indeed and word before God and all the people and they go in to describe all of the things that and and they begin to talk but in the 25th verse he says oh he says oh oh fool slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures con the things concerning himself and yet while he's doing this their eyes are closed they they don't know who he is and they drew nigh unto a village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone farther amen but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to ter with him and and and it came to pass he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight can you say Amen so see the prophet would say all through that day he had been he he had been bringing the word to them with no signs see there's no signs and so while he was bringing the word to them scripture upon scripture upon scripture yet they had no idea that he was the one that was walking with them can you say Amen they didn't know that he had reason or risen he says they loved him they believed him but they didn't know he had raised from the dead and they had even argued against see amen arguing the fact that he had not risen he's in the grave and all these things see but he says when he got them inside amen AB by by themselves and sat down in the evening time that's when he revealed his resurrection do you understand why the prophet's Ministry is so different from that of of every other minister throughout the ages a man is because it was more than just a man preaching a theology to us and teaching us about a God that could and a God that would and a God that whatever it was revealing the resurrection of Jesus Christ to our day yes sir that's right he says see he never did one thing that he did in life only just the word but notice at the evening time at the evening time that's when he proved D his resurrection am so notice he says we've gone through a dismal day A Dark Day neither light nor dark see and we've been hearing the word with no manifestation see just a gloomy foggy day but in the evening light sir in the evening time the light that evening light is shining again can you say man aren't you glad for that it's shining he said see down through the years we've had all these scripture teachings but it's this day for the manifestation the manifestations of the Resurrection amen so we read there where Paul where where it says that he done something and he quickly vanished out of their midst he he had vanished and the prophet said see notice it was a short message it wasn't very long can you say amen he didn't stay long with him he just manifested him himself and vanished out of their sight and their eyes were open and they knew that was him and they said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the road now Christianity is is not based on replacement it's based on Resurrection Resurrection is not replacement can you say amen and and while many people again and and I'm not bashing it's just the facts and we could being there but but most while they're talking about a resurrection of 2,000 years ago they're replacing amen Christ today Amen to say he's alive but it's all historic amen while they're replacing him with programs with Bishops with Creeds and dogmas and and and all kinds of things can you say amen amen see it's replacement so the resurrection is not really a amen uh meaningful to them amen because Resurrection is not replacement the same Jesus that went down is the same Jesus that came up can you say Amen not replaced but resurrected now we know that Abel was a type of Christ and how that he was killed amen and and and then here God would raise up Seth to take his place amen and and that was a replacement but the prophet said what that was was nothing but a preaster amen see amen God showing that another righteous seed would come amen but it was only a replacement but when the they killed Christ amen the Royal Seed of Abraham amen not was he replaced but he resurrected he didn't need a replacement he was that resurrection and life can you say Amen so Christ is not replaced he's resurrected amen now we all know the scripture very well Luke 1728 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank amen they bought they sold they planted they builded see but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the of man is revealed can you say Amen see so what is this it's proving that he is alive this son of man revealing himself is the evening light that was promised in Zechariah it's the Messiah like ain't that right so as we know and and again thank God for the message cuz we wouldn't have got it amen and it just by Revelation amen uh can we still really understand it and Perce receive it but but how did amen God appear to Abraham in the days of lot amen everybody talks about the days of lot Sodom and gorah but they really missed the secret of it is that God manifested himself in that day to the elect can you say amen amen and he manifested himself not in spirit form but in man form in human form form ain't that right amen see down through the seven Church ages we've gone through the spirit of God spirit of God Amen but in this day it's come back to the son of man amen amen Son of God Son of Man see so he appeared to Abraham Amen in the days of lot amen as a form of a man in the form of a man the prophet said Abraham had seen God in many different forms in a light in Visions but here was God in a man just before the weighted and promised son appeared he said see God had appeared in many forms as he has through the church ages in lights and so forth as he spoke to Abraham and by Voices but just before the coming son arrived he changed the body of Abraham and Sarah immediately after this so they could received the son and notice the last sign that they got before the son arrived was Jehovah talking to them in the form of a man oh aren't you glad for that amen see amen and how they know this was Jehovah was because he said Abraham not Abram just a few days before God changed his name where is thy wife Sarah not Sarah but Sarah princess see and Abraham said but she's in the tent behind you and he said I I personal pronoun I will visit you according to my promise at the time of life the next 28 days something is going to happen to Sarah see and Sarah in the tent smiled in herself and said in her heart how could this be saying I'm old and have pleasure with my Lord who is also old uh uh Abraham see and and the angel or the man said why did Sarah say in her heart see in the tent behind him why did she say these things cannot be see it was a man in human flesh like a prophet yet it was Elohim Discerning the thought that was in Sarah's heart behind him and so Jesus would tell us as it was in the days of lot so shall it be at the coming of the end of the world when the son of man not Son of God the son of man would be revealed again amen can you say Amen what a resurrection now we we find there in Matthew uh 12 and 38 Jesus uh here well it says and then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee so they were sign Seekers just like the Pentecostal sign Seekers they got to have a goosebump before they really think they're saved you know they got to have someone prophesy they got to have someone to have a vision they got to have someone to have a dream they got to have someone to you know uh uh uh say something good it it they they're sign Seekers ain't that right and so Jesus would tell them and say now an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given it uh but the sign of the Prophet Jonas now notice for as Jonas was in three days and three nights in the Well's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth ain't that right now Jonah Jonah was as good as dead amen L being in that uh the the the the the belly of that well amen see but then he come forth as one risen from the dead ain't that right so God would tell them now you you know the prophet told us that Jesus was actually prophesying he wasn't just speaking of that day which they that in one sense he was but yet this is the worst age ever it we are living in this prophecy of of where the it's an adulterous evil Wicked generation amen and there would be a sign now you think of that I don't know about you but I I I as me personally I never was able to uh uh put that App apply that to our day amen and to really understand that until I come into the message of the hour amen and and and see so so having a prophet as as we said before God sending a prophet to us is Grace To Us amen that we could understand amen what God was really saying for us in our day amen see so we're living in the generation that was receive the sign and brother brandom said it is the resurrection sign it's not just a a sign of people just laughing in the spirit it's not the sign of everybody speaking in tongues and prophesying and and rolling on the floor I've been there seeing all that done and and and and doing flipflops and cartwheels in the church and and you know we get so excited that you know the preacher could be preaching and someone stand up and start prophesying and and the preacher get done you know would stop preaching everybody get quiet and before you know preacher wouldn't even he wouldn't even finish his text you know and everybody start dancing and shouting and the preacher say well the Lord's had his way here tonight and and uh we we called that being the presence of the Lord well brother Rand called back blessings and he told us that you're not supposed to interrupt the preacher when he's standing there preaching the gospel didn't you say Amen see and so he put things in order but that still wasn't the sign that we were looking for amen it would be a resurrection sign amen ain't that right Hallelujah so the son of man being revealed Alive Now how did Jesus show that he was the Messiah we can take that scripture there in John 4:1 16- 26 where Jesus goes and talking to this Samaritan woman and as they're talking he's trying to catch your spirit ain't that right it's what the prophet told us and and then he tells her go get your husband she says I have none and and and so he says yep yeah uh you you spoke right for thou has had five husbands and and the one that you're living with now is not thy husband and and the woman just by him saying that said sir I perceive that thy heart a prophet amen why he's doing the very same thing that mzc did mzc did to Abraham and now he's showing that same sign can you say amen amen and by that sign she realized that he was the Messiah amen and as he goes down she she says well our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship and and and so he's starting to talk to her and all these things and and in the 25th verse amen of of John uhh 16 I believe it is um it it says uh uh the woman SI unto him I know that Messiah cometh I know messiah's coming which is called the Christ and when he comes he will tell us all things in other words he will do the things that you just did ain't that right and Jesus said unto her I am he that speaks unto thee think of it he knew she knew that he was Messiah by the messic sign it was sign of the Messiah amen that sign as the prophet told us was given to the Jew and to the Samaritan but it was now in this day amen the son of man would be revealed again and it would be to the Gentiles a resurrection sign a resurrection sign can you say Amen that you would not have to talk about God in the past but you could know that he's alive today by the sign that he would perform in this age can you say Amen what would he do he would prove that he's not a corpse in some denominational tomb can you say Amen now notice brother Brown says I'm fully persuaded that people are are not getting to Christ amen I believe that it's the enemy that's throw this entrance amen because the reason I believe this he's not the object that they have been pointing to see the people's been pointed to they have either been pointed to a Dogma a Doctrine a party or experience or a sensation or something like that instead of being pointed to Christ the word can you say Amen another place says now there's many people who love him who doesn't yet realize that he is alive and they it's some kind of a history that they have learned in some school it's some book of theology some ethics code of ethics that they have studied somewhere and Jesus is a historical figure to them and yet in the history they love him they're hearing the history of him and they love him can you say Amen yet they don't realize that he is alive with us walking around with us just as he always did he is here the same as he ever was what a blessed people to know that he's alive sir not knowing it because you went to some Easter play and what some guy come out of the Tomb and everybody gets excited and you say well he's alive cuz they said it but you've seen his sign of messiah messiah light right God sent John the Baptist to point out to the people the Lamb of God among them everyone would have missed it they would have missed that he was the Messiah the prophet said John would have missed it had it not been revealed to him reation amen but see after John pointed him out to the people what did John say I must decrease that he may increase amen his ministry was finished he introduced Messiah on earth now the prophet said God sent his prophet and as soon as the prophet got through with his message the Lord followed the prophet's message for deliverance oh we are living in a grand time immediately when the prophet went off the scene what happened the Lord came on the scene as soon as John went off the scene the Lord came on the scene very strange how God works but he does it he works in mysterious way ain't that right another place he was the word he was the word made light who was Messiah ain't that right he was the word made light amen see he was the word manifested then when he come on the scene John says I must decrease he must increase see two of them couldn't stay at the same time John had to go but Jesus remained Jesus didn't leave when the prophet left can you say Amen the prophet left and Jesus remained and so is it today brother Brandon may not be on the scene but he doesn't need to be on the scene the very one he introduced to us is on the scene Lord do you believe it amen to God we find that brother bram's Ministry was the forrun of the second coming and he introduced Messiah do you believe that we we could spend some time on that brother Bram says my Ministry is to declare he is here amen he is here and did he not do that he could take that scripture he's the same yesterday today and forever and make it so real to us ain't that right that even the Skeptics that were in that day thought that he I've read a lot of a lot of them from from uh uh uh lot lot of the preachers in that day Jack Moore and and uh uh man or Roberts and and uh just so many more amen where they said there there's one thing about till Osburn it reminded us of Bible days again one one preacher said said we had preached about it we were talking about it that God would do this and God did this he said but it was all in history we talked about it but it was all in history he said but then when we come he said when I first come into that in into a meeting of of of of of William brandom he says I I thought it all everything that I had been saying everything I'd been talking about as a history was standing right there before me it brought Jesus Christ on the scene can you say Amen see that was what his ministry was and so now brother brandham has gone off the scene but that same Jesus Christ is here among us we must never let that foret fail us don't you forget that Christ is here Among Us that's right yes sir true where is he today that we may know him amen Ephesians 1:22 Paul tells us that the church is the body body of Jesus Christ and haveth put all things under his feet and gave him to be head the head over all things to the church which is his body amen can you say amen amen now you know a body if it don't have life in it it's nothing but a corpse that's what makes the churches a corpse is they have no life no but there is a body of Jesus Christ on the Earth today it's not a physical body it is the mystical body body of Jesus Christ and the Very life that was in that physical body is here today the very power that was in that physical body is in the body of Jesus Christ today the church do you believe that amen Ephesians 5:29 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones amen see making it very personal to us today amen John 14:16 and I will pray Jesus says I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you back then and shall be in you can you say amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's right not coming to us in a Corporal body right we will go to meet him in his Corporal body but he comes to us his body as we are his body he comes to Us Praise the Lord yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also promising a resurrection for the church at that day everybody say at that day Prophet said this day you shall know that I am in my father you in me and I in you can you say Amen who's going to know the church is going to know his body is going to know amen while they're all talking about Christ as a historical God there is a people that is his body that knows where he's at they know where he's at he's alive can you say Amen am oh Messiah light now notice uh uh uh Isaiah 60 And1 arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee now the prophet used this scripture so many times as for this age thy light is the evening light can you say amen amen for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee arise yes a resurrection shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee not somewhere else but upon you not in the heavens but upon you deity is not in heaven it's in you that's what a prophet said can you say Amen believe so what is it the son of man is being revealed being revealed do you still believe he's been revealed I believe the prophet performed that Messiah sign the son of man was revealed let us know that he's alive and well that he's on the earth now but I believe he's still in a body being revealed as son of man believe I know one had told me years ago said well we we we we we we're back in the Son of God age only brother Brandon's Ministry was son of man I said oh no no no I didn't understand everything about it but I said no I do don't believe that at all I believe that if he revealed himself as son of man there is a church that he has taken flesh upon amen he's taken up on my flesh he's taken up on your flesh and his very character is being shaped and molded in the Church of the Living God his very power his very essence is in the Church of the Living God can you say Amen he's alive and well amen the Bible says that wise shall know their God Amen think of that now the wise shall know their God true and they will be the ones that will do great exploits you know brother brandom applied that to this age here at the revealing of the son of man when he would reveal the resurrection sign would be performed amen there would be a wise people that wouldn't just shuck it off say well that's just beenal telepathy that's just psychology that's just Ah that's just whatever oh no they become wise amen they start to look and they start to ponder and they start understanding and they realize that's my God not that body not not brother Brandon being God now can you say Amen but there was a God Amen in that [Applause] body revealing but notice the wicked will not know the god of Heaven no sir so what will they know him they'll know him in a form they'll know him in ritual but the prophet said they don't know him by the way of perfection ain't that right am see God can only work through Perfection for he is perfect ain't that right so therefore it has to be a perfect Channel amen that God works through see amen because the prophet said he cannot stain himself in any way he can't come and work through sin it stain his Holiness it would stain him see he doesn't work through human Ambitions he doesn't work through some sinful uh filthy whatever you know amen no he's got to have Perfection he's got to have a perfect channel to work through can you say Amen cuz he's not going to stain himself see and notice what the prophet said that's why Jesus come to take away our sins amen that we might be perfected that God could work through his church and there is where the secret lays can you say amen how that God could work through US amen the secret is is he took me and he washed me he cleansed me he perfected me to where he can't even see my sins Hallelujah can't even see you as a sinner can you say amen amen he can't see you because there's a blood and it was his own created blood amen so was the blood of Jesus Christ that he could loose you from all sins Hallelujah amen now he's got a church that he can work through a perfect Channel amen they've died to themselves it's his character being molded in them now it's his ways being being worked through them now it's his voice it's his thoughts it's it's everything has to do with him we have become his hands we become his feet we become everything that he is that's what he said Do you believe it amen Jesus told the disciples he said tear ye into the in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen amen don't do nothing till you become indued we understand that now that that power is resurrection power ain't that right so for two for nearly 2,000 years we've had had a dark world of theology amen and the prophet says the Holy Spirit Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2,000 years but is everybody say it is to be loosed in the evening time evening time what is going to be loose Messiah light can you say Amen Messiah light Amen to fulfill Zachariah Amen in the evening time it shall be light can you say Amen to fulfill amen the prophet Isaiah arise Shine for thy light is come God would send a message in this time an evening time message Amen to loose the holy spirit in the evening time by the evening time message brother Bram said what is it it's the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time evening time God praise the Lord that's Galatians 2:20 Paul would tell us I'm crucified with Christ and this is all of our life here this is our story I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live what you died to your old self died to your old ways died to your nature died to your past died to your habits died to sin died to hate died to bitterness died to to lust died to what you died but never unless I live praise the Lord praise the Lord yet not I but Christ liveth in me can you say amen and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so notice what the prophet said his standing light is the light of Messiah his standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages can you say Amen now notice Romans 8:11 very uh uh uh common scripture to us for it speaks for us amen but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies you get it that's why we couldn't stay in do amen amen can you say amen that's why sons of God Daughters of God couldn't stay in a in in denomination we have been gathered by a supernatural power a supernatural happening it was the quickening power that took us out we couldn't be satisfied there can you say amen God could not reveal to him to the world a Living Church his living body in some old dead tomb and we will not not let some old dead carcass corse amen bring us back to dead religion just ain't going to do it Christ is living can you sayen Christ lives God he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and we know what Quicken is is to make Alive Now notice amen and I saw another Mighty Angel all right come down from heaven Glory oh god with an open book Thank God Amen Hallelujah you know what it was it was the quickening power yes it was that spirit that quickened Christ from the dead here he comes and every name written on the Lamb's Book of Life you see because the prophet was saying I was listening to him today and I think it was in the Easter uh uh rising of the Sun the rising of the Sun and and he said see the spirit could only what it does it only quickens the word do you understand that they've made such Frolic out of and such a a a misuse of the spirit of God and misinterpreted what the spirit of God is I've seen him danc and shouting and all that and still live like a devil outside the church and all of that see and and having all this baggage and most people are now claiming to have the Holy Ghost and yet smoking their cigarettes and and and doing all kinds of vile things and and and and and and all these things but here's what the prophet said see the spirit comes to Quicken the word can you say Amen the spirit comes to Quicken the word it doesn't just come amen and just suit your fancy and give you chill bums but it quickens the word that's been predestinated before the foundation of the world can you say amen amen there is a destiny for you God had a destiny he says I've given you an expected end now that Spirit The Same Spirit that quicked Christ has come in this day with an open book to Quicken every name that he had written before the foundation of the world come on now it's not a literal book that he's come to redeem you're that book Glory can you say amen hallelujah notice notice see he said it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's been foreordained to be in the rapture yeah what how then then we we must not be afraid that we're going to miss the Rapture that's what he's come for is the Quicken oh do you love him you say well I'm bride well how can you be bride and be lost how can you be bride and go through the tribulation how can you be bride it's already predestinated for you to go and he has come in this day to Quicken the seed that's GL hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah there's power yes there is thinking of brother Bram talking about the rising of the sun there's power in that light I think I've told you before but uh at our church back in Oklahoma the old church it was you know it had uh it it had little little uh Windows you know about like that and I think it had three of them but uh we had concrete floor which it was carpeted then we had a stone Altar and and then the top of it was concrete and uh anyway they laid the rock and all that so it was you know and I'm sure the con the the foundation of it was pretty thick I I would assume and but you know we we had that I we had bought the church from another church that uh Nazarene church and and we had been in there for you know I don't know 10 years or so and but one day we come in and noticed that there was a blade of grass that had come between the car carpet or between the Altar and the floor and right there was a blade of grass and the window was sitting you know a little ways over from that right and I thought well how in the world could that grass get there and look and and there was a crack right along that seam and the power of that sun even though it wasn't shining directly on it cuz there was a roof and all that but the light from that wind the window gave it some power allowed the strength of that sun to call that seed just just because there was concrete there didn't mean that there wasn't seed it just was needing light to call it can you say amen and I I thought of that because you know here Jesus you know when you're looking at like Mary Magdalene that was her life was a wretch but all the way through even through the Bible look at Rahab the Harlot and and uh well just just all through and but Mary Magdalene and uh uh had Seven Devils cast out of her look at the woman and it may be the same I can't remember right off but here the Pharisees the Pharisees was going to kill this lady cuz they caught her in adultery right and they bring her to Jesus as they were passing they already had the Rocks they already had it all the ammunition and and so but so they were already on their way but they passed Jesus and they thought you know what let's stop for just a moment before we do this thing and find out what he has to say about it you know and and no doubt they thought well you know he's going to really Rain judgment down and Jesus says ye without sin cast the first stone I don't know what he was doing when he was writing on the ground you know all these things but whatever happened in that moment it changed their mind and they began to C drop the stones and they walked away and he looked at that lady and says where are thine accusers and he she says I have none it was the power that he had and and and you can look at the man of gathering that that no one could help him but here he come the word made flesh amen and he set that man free and all the way through and here we are in this age where where where the mighty Angel has come with an open book and and the prophet said why did he do it why has he come to claim those he had redeemed to claim he's got the power no matter how much concrete is over your life he's got the power can you say Amen no matter how bad it seems and how impossible it seem he has the power and that's what it's all about it's his resurrection power amen loose her and let her go is that not what was said House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Amen you love him so how how did God make Jesus known back there brother Brown said by sending him and anointing him with his own spirit and Jesus said if I do not the works of my father then believe me not is that right if I do the works then you believe the works because why he didn't hook up with their organizations and their denominations he stood out from all of them bald them out and they say he tore up churches and everything well see could you expect his Spirit to do anything less when he comes again see he will do the same thing because he can't change it's God see we can change our human selves can change but God cannot change he has to be the same he's infinite we're in we're finite so he cannot change so when he comes upon the church his church in the last days what will it be a pulled out group amen of people people Anointed with the spirit of God they will be [Applause] Messiahs can you say that with me they will be Messiah why it's evening time it's evening time and the world thinks that he will reveal himself in his Corporal body yet when he comes the world will not see his Corporal body the when the Rapture takes place they won't see him he'll come as a thief in the night hello amen but he's revealing himself in his mesical body his bride body Messiah I love it am I love the Lord amen they'll be anointed ones and if his spirit is in them they'll do the things that he did just exactly can you say amen amen oh he's wonderful amen now notice what he says now if we are born of the spirit again of the spirit of God God don't have little weak parts and big strong parts now think of that you may be in your own place position and you may seem like a nobody you may just be the one that greets people as they come in you may be the a manner you may be just a musician you may be the one that sweeps the floor you may be the one that that that talks to people out out you know whatever whatever God has got you to do that is position you know some some people are evangelists and go world over some some are just just you know helps in the church some just stay home and they do work for God in the local community it it it just all that but no matter what what the position that you have God has no weak Parts in other words the God is Not stronger in somebody else than he is in you that's good way to put it ain't that right you've got the same Authority the same power that's what brother Bram tried to get us to I believe with all my heart that he tried to get us to understand the God that was within us and to recognize how powerful he is in US remember how many times that he'd have everybody just lay your hands upon each other and people would start rising out of the Wheelchairs and and pandemonium would take place right he didn't have to lay hands on everybody he was just trying to get their faith amen so God has no weak parts and big strong Parts he's altogether God and if you had enough God in you till it was just a barely a shadow that's enough power to make a new Earth that's enough power to make a new moon and a new system it's God and it's strong see and right now and every believer in here has eternal life which is God's spirit in you enough power that'll raise up the dead that'll heal the sick that'll set orbits in Condition it's controlled by law that Spirit that's in you can you say Amen now notice you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen that same spirit that you've got in you will raise yourself up at the day of Resurrection hallu amen amen can you say amen amen in another place he says Jesus is so close to coming to the earth now until his power has began to catch the people and winding them up getting them ready for the bride getting ready to be caught up in the Rapture a church that'll just fit exactly see to be taken up through its power will draw all the rest of them that's born again out of the earth that's right oh do you love him is the Lord wonderful amen amen amen we could go on and on but I'll hope we've helped you amen I'm so glad for the resurrection of today wonderful brother BR said what did Jesus had he had the quickening power and it made it quickened every promised word for him that spoke of him for his day to where he made it live and brother BR said and that's the same thing what this quickening power is doing for us amen it's quickening every promised word for our day that speaks of this bride prise the Lord can you sayen oh he lives he lives amen if the musicians will come thank God he lives the Lord is so wonderful to us amen hallelujah I believe now what kind of a church is Christ being revealed in it's the same kind of a church that he started on the day of Pentecost it's a Pentecostal church and it's made up of people who have received the Pentecostal blessing praise the Lord that's what the prophet said and he said what is what is this Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the Resurrection absolutely can you say Amen so the only way that a man can be Pentecostal I know Pentecostal seems to be a curse word among the message folks pentec if the Devil Makes that that bad to you of a Pentecostal the word Pentecostal something wrong yes amen it's not God that made Pentecostal Pentecostal comes from God not the devil the only way a man can be Pentecostal is to have the Pentecostal blessing which is the confirmation of the Resurrection that's right can you say Amen so we know Pentecost is not a denomination it's it's not just a church Church name it's it's not just whatever Pentecost is an experience so then God's church is a church that is full of quickening power for that's what they received on the day of Pentecost can you say amen amen that's what come in the upper room brother BR says and then that quickening power so changed them they were scared and it turned them into brave people they were scared of what the Jews would do and they were trembling right but when that quickening power came had so quickened them changed them yes sir that they would tell anyone about the message of the hour they tell anyone about it cuz something happened in them amen can you say amen amen that's right see I like this because he says see the holy go Holy Spirit came and confirmed to them that they would be raised up because they were potentially raised then from cowards to brave men see they were afraid of the very word that they they had thought don't let this pass over you they were afraid they know that he was the word even the Jews had to admit it Nicodemus said Rabbi we know that you're a teacher come from God see no man can do these things except God be with him see we know that we recognize that well so did the disciples Peter even swore in his presence see and all them had forsaken him at his crucifixion but here they are now in this Upper Room in the presence of God and all of a sudden here come this Holy Spirit down from heaven and it quickened them and the quickening took place and they wasn't afraid to make a witness of the message that they believed and know to be the truth amen can you say Amen how many knows that this message is the truth do you know it's the truth amen we must not be afraid to be a witness of it cuz we realize this message is proof it's the revealing of the son of man amen it's Christ himself can you say Amen oh praise the Lord what song He's Alive and Well living in me tell the world that he is the same the same [Music] today and forever Jesus is Alive and Well sing it now oh he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that he is the [Music] same he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus is [Music] Alive as they just play softly brother BR said there's a lot of mockery that goes with this quickening power or it's a lot of of mockery of this quickening power people thinking they got it when they don't he a lot of people do it because they've got some false impression of what they've seen other Christians do but he said Satan can't impersonate any of that we know that as missionaries you can see it impersonated shouting dancing speaking in tongues and all these things you can see it impersonated anywhere absolutely among the heathens and people who deny there is such a thing as Jesus Christ Christ being the Son of God and they do all those things themselves but notice but the real true quickening spirit that comes to a Believer quickens him to God's word that's back to Eagle food again it quickens us back to Eagle food right back to where he lives man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God can you sayen he said see if it's the real holy spirit that a man has and not a m moery Holy Spirit it will manifest the promise of this hour that's right can you say amen amen see do we believe in dancing you bet we do do we believe in shouting you bet we do do we believe in the gifts you bet we do but when the quickening power came to us it quickened us to that word the word to where we know how the gifts work we know what we to look for we know what to you understand what I'm saying it quickens us so much that this word begins to live within us amen oh I'm so glad for that amen you see a perfect Church operating perfect gifts not that that there ain't no problems in a church every church will have its problems Satan's all the time working in in one way and if people ain't matured enough they allow the devil to use them and this and this and this but when you're coming into [Music] it it's a perfect church that God can operate perfect gifts operate his perfect word in this church and I I just believe that God is doing that in his body today oh I'm so glad for that we don't have to take substitutes we don't have to take just the average we don't have to take we don't have to go back back to Pentecostal age and work the gifts the way they used to work we don't have to do that God didn't call us to do that we are a body of Christ in this day you love him let's stand to our feet oh that Jesus is Alive and Well sing it now oh he's alive and will the world oh that he is the same
