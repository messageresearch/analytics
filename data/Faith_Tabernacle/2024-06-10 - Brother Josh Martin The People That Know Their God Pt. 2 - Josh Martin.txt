things or have a peace in our mind God can show us up on the scene and let you know I've got it you don't have to fight I've got it amen do you love the Lord this evening amen if you have your Bibles this evening let's open our scriptures to Daniel 12:1 I'm just going to continue on my thought from this morning maybe talk a little more on the exploits or on the reflection and so I hope that'll be okay tonight I've I've been on these lines from for some time back home so I been just taking my Liberty this today so hope that's been okay uh Genesis 12:1 the Bible would say now the Lord said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father's house and unto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation I Will Bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing amen can we bow our heads tonight dear heavenly father Lord we're thankful for your grace and your mercy father thank you for coming Among Us this morning Lord as we felt your presence Lord and your anointing but Lord this is another opportunity father another service that you've allowed us to have Lord God as we come into your presence we ask that you would feel welcome Among Us Lord God I ask that you would anoint your vessel tonight Lord As I Lay myself aside speak through these lips of clay Lord I ask that you would speak to the hearts and to the needs Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated tonight so we see in our our scripture reading here that Abraham had a visitation and the visitation was a calling out and I believe that the the purpose of the calling out was for exploits and and God would tell him get get out of thy country and I will make thee a great nation I'm I'm going to bless your seed I'm going to produce something through you that you're not able to do so something Supernatural was going to take place and we see that Abraham was separated for a purpose and I like how the Bible is put I'm going to make thee a great nation I'm going to bless thee it's nothing to do with human ability but I'm going to do it through you and we know that it's been God's desire to have men and women in his own image to express himself through you know but the branam would preach a message called the Masterpiece and he would and he it's an incredible sermon he would talk about Michelangelo and the sculpture of Moses and he would say nobody knew what Michelangelo was making but he himself and it would be in his mind and since he would have a vision in his mind he would work by a pattern and he would start to do work day by day mother brandom said it would be hours countless nights where he he didn't sleep much but then all of a sudden that vision would start to take change into an image where it wasn't just in the mind but then it was coming into reality and I love how brother Brandon would say it there would be a reflection that matched his vision so all of the years of hard work would start to pay off because there was something thing the negative had become the positive and then brother Brandon would say let's close that book and talk about the great sculpture and brother Brandon would would say that he didn't have to find materials to create a masterpiece he would create the materials he was the great the the the the great sculpture and he would say he would create and bring into existence what his attributes desired and I thought that was powerful that it was his attributes that desired for you to be here you didn't desire to be here but God desired you to be here it wasn't because your mom and your daddy come together a great grandparents grandparents come together but God wanted you to be here he had a desire for a reflection so he would predestinate you to come into existence and brother Brandon would tell us he would create all the creeping things create the Tigers create the the the animals he would create the nature but then there would finally come upon the earth a Perfection and he would say finally there come upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what the Creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and we would see that the same nature that was in God would be in Adam brother Brandon would tell us that Adam he would speak to the storm he would speak to he would speak to the tree be plucked up and planted over here the Bible would tell us that he would create or he would he would name all all the animals all with the spoken word just like God could speak the word the reflection could speak the word and just like God was eternal the reflection was was eternal the Angels couldn't be a reflection they didn't have a soul they they wasn't made after God's likeness but man was a masterpiece in the mind of God and brother Brandon would tell us that God wanted a masterpiece family so he would strike the left side of Adam and from Adam he would come and help me and and like I brother Brandon would say he didn't create another creation he took from the original creation and from the original brought forth Eve so now they were one and the same and God what would God say when he would come to the Garden Adam Adam Where Art Thou there were One Creation there were one there there were one and the same and it was only after the fall that Adam would call her Eve so before while they was in Perfection it was one creation and oh my I believe God has brought the bride and the groom back together where it's One Creation once again but brother Brandon would tell us that he was so pleased with this masterpiece that he would rest on the seventh day brother brandom says while God was resting the devil would slip into the garden and would Mar this masterpiece and he says now the Masterpiece is marred so no longer is Adam speaking to Nature now he's running from nature he's not he's not speaking to the storm or petting Leo the Lion but now he's running from Leo the Lion so no longer is Adam reflecting eternity but now Adam is reflecting another land and then brother Brandon would tell us what we reflect here is only the land that we are dwelling in he says as I said in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here what you are what your Celestial body or or body is up yonder what your Celestial body is somewhere else is what you are reflecting back here in the spirit land what you are what you are here if you're still vulgar minded and so forth in the spirit land you're vulgar minded here if you got malice Envy Strife you're in you're in the spirit land with that it reflects back here so the land that we are dwelling spiritually only reflects naturally so in order to be a reflection we got to get out of the land of bondage and into our inheritance in order to reflect eternity we got to change our dwelling place and we would see that in order for Abraham to be a reflection there had to be a separation and that separation would put him in a position for the blessing of God to fall upon his life and you see the natural seat of Abraham the naturally he had a he had to make a separation but we might not have to leave a natural land but it might be a spiritual land it might you know it can be the simple things movies gossip or whatever but then it could also go into the deeper things of theology what you think is right what Dr so and so said or what this this one says it's a land that we can dwell in that keeps us from reflecting the Eternal Heights but God has given us a message in this generation that I believe is our Promised Land it is our inheritance that's the land we are to dwell in not what so and so said not what this one says but there's the land God has given us that we are to reflect and we see that the land we live in is only what we reflect and we can see in the Bible that the children of Israel even though they were called and promised the land they were only reflecting bondage as long as they were in Egypt you see but once they got out of Egypt their reflection changed oh my it took the the promised land would take somebody that was being beaten somebody that had to make had to make bricks and was and was bound by another but once they come out of that land out of that land there would come a liberty when they come out of bondage there would be a freedom and they would walk into a new land and when say give me my Mountain it was the same people but in a different land oh my and this message has taken the same people that was once Bound by theology that was once Bound by ideas that was once Bound by Creeds has taken the same vessels but plac him in another land that they can reflect the mind of God oh my you see we're just a reflection of what this message is and this message is the thoughts of God to the body oh Hallelujah he would anoint the prophet to bring forth the thoughts of God now there's a vessel that has changed their Dwelling Place changed their land and is reflecting the mind of God brother Brandon would say now total separation from all unbelief and remember Abraham the patriarch was never fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what God said to do and will never never never be blessed any and have the blessings until we obey what God Said to do so before we can be a reflection we got to come out of a land into a new land and you see in the Bible would tell us in Genesis 13 and 14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him now lift up thine eyes lift up from th place where thou art northward Southward Eastward Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then then shall thy seed also be numbered arise and walk through the land of it the length of it and the breath of it for I will give it to thee and I like how he how he starts it now the Lord said unto Abram after lot was separated from him so after the separation then God would give The Possession oh come on now after the separation then God would say arise it's time to walk through your inheritance everything that you see now belongs to you you know what that would be a voice I would want to hear when you want to hear that whatever you see is yours whatever your footsteps can walk upon is yours since there's a separation I'm going to give the possession and oh my I think it's time that we make a separation so that we can fully receive what God has given to us brother Brandon would tell us that Footprints mean possession so if if you have made a separation it ain't time to get lazy with the things of God it's time to walk through it he would say walk through the length of it and the breadth of it whatever you can see belongs to you and brother Brandon would tell us that the trouble with the Christians today they are air of all things and they and he would say well brother if I bought a house or somebody give me a house I would go through every room of it I would go down in the basement I would go out in the garage I want to know what I own and that's the way it was when I got saved the God these are God's promises so I just went through every one of them claimed every one of them they are mine he says that's the problem is they don't want to go through it but if there's a separation it's time to arise oh hallelujah it's time to arise get into this word and see what God gave you God has given you a sound mind God has given you a peace God has given you a hope God's giv you courage to face the enemy that comes against your mind God's Ging giv you a Rapture it's time to arise and see what God has given us oh it's time to stop listening to the negative thoughts and listen to what these tapes say oh come on now I don't care what the complexes say what do God what does God say I'm going to arise and walk through my land brother the Brandon would say it's like a variety store he says if it's as big as this church he says if I walked into it and it was mine he says I would walk through every every shelf of it I would walk through the behind the counter I wanted to see what belonged to me if it was all mine I wanted to go see it and I think it's time we go see what God has given us amen and he's telling Abraham not what you can do but what I can do but then he would stop and he would say then Thou shalt be a blessing so it's it goes from I'm going to bless thee I'm going to make thee a great nation to now you're got a part to play I'm going to pour out the blessing now you got to reflect the blessing oh Hallelujah so it went from God then to Abraham and oh my God has has fulfilled his part he's given us a message now it's our turn to pick it up and reflect it it's our turn to take it off the tapes and put it into a life oh my but you see I love the election of God and God didn't just one day you know look up and say you know what I better find somebody to have a to have a supersede through he didn't do that before Abraham was ever upon the Earth he already knew Abraham was going to be the father of Nations so when Abraham come upon the Earth God's plan would start to come into fulfillment to pour out the blessing and we would see the Psalms would say in Psalms 3 and8 salvation belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is upon thy people and so the blessing of God couldn't just follow on anybody but the predestinated of God and I say you're not here by accident you haven't heard this message by accident but the blessing of God is only for the people of God oh brother Brandon would say this but when he came ex expressed exactly like the New Testament said he would be expressed or The Testament said he would be expressed then all of those who were redeemable believed it because they were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God because they were redeemable oh because you were redeemable even though when you was far out there whenever you was doing your doing your own thing it was because you were redeemable God would pour out the blessing it was because you were redeemable God will pour out the favor and we would see that the favor blessing of God changes everything we would see that the favor of God would come to Little Mary that could not do anything but the favor of God would come to her and would say this in Luke 1:28 the angel came in unto her and said hell thou are highly highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women so the favor of God would being bring the blessing of God so that exploits could come through her she would look at the angel and would say I know not a man how can I do these things and he would say the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you the blessing is going to overshadow you and you're going to produce it oh Hallelujah you could to be a reflection in your own ability but the blessing of God would be poured upon you that you can be a reflection the Bible would tell us in Genesis 29- 17 Leo was tendere eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored and I like this scripture because Rachel couldn't have children she couldn't do Leah could but there was one thing that Rachel could always point back to she was favored oh she might not have much to give this one could have more to offer but she had one thing the favor of Jacob and little church you've got the favor of almighty God oh my we might be a small congregation we might not have a big youth group we might not have a a worship team a a robe choir but you got the favor of God that has come to you and says you are my reflection you might not got much to offer you might not got much to give but you are favored oh and also he would say say you are well beautiful you're beautiful and well favored in the sight of God whenever all the worship the Bible would tell us is a stench in the nostrils of God he looks at you and says you're beautiful how come you're beautiful cuz you're favored the favor of God has brought a Perfection it has brought a a blame mistake that in the sight of God he looks through every circumstance God looks through critics God looks through Skeptics and all he sees is blaspheme but he looks at you and sees Perfection he sees a beauty that only the blood can bring oh hallelujah it's not a natural beauty he looks at you it says you are favored Hallelujah so the bride is found favored because of election the favor of God ain't to Puff you up but the favor of God is to fulfill the purpose and the Bible would tell us in Romans 9 and11 for the children not being yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so the the the the the purpose would come to Jacob or the favor would come to Jacob because of election and it was the favor of God protecting the purpose of God oh my and you wonder why you're have you're not in a premature grave it's been the favor of God protecting the purpose God knew he had a plan for your life that's why he has kept you every step of the way that's why you're not insane that's why you're not in a grave or in a prison cell somewhere the the purpose of God has been protected you remember whenever Daniel was throwing into the lion's den the Bible would tell us that the king would come and seal the he would seal the cave so that the purpose could be fulfilled oh he would seal it and I think my another King has done that in this generation there would be a purpose upon the Earth so God would come and seal the purpose he would pour out the blessing upon the purpose so that it can be fulfilled oh that's why you're standing here today God has come by the brandom to tell us that God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out it's the purpose of God being protected oh my it's the favor of God could you imagine being the woman at the well you know I can imagine she wasn't the only one that was divorced or the only one that was a prostitute and sure there was other ones in that City but she was favored she was elected Jesus would say I have needs to go by Samaria what was that need what was that desire it was the purpose what was that desire it was the election that needed a blessing it was election that needed the favor of God to come back her way so that she could reflect something and here would come Jesus I've got needs to go by that way and Oh my he had a need to come by tonight he had a need to come by this morning because there's a purpose there's an elected seed that needs Another Blessing oh man if you need another blessing don't out or don't don't throw it away and say you know what God don't fill no more God don't bless no more the same God that started you in your journey is going to take you all the way through the same God that filled you at the beginning can refill you tonight God is still pouring out blessings upon the purpose Hallelujah and so what made her so special that God would say I've got needs she was favored and brother Brandon would say this now what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven I love that quickly you don't got to go through Pitt or go through a a five-step program for you to be forgiven quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her or brought it back when she saw the express scripture manifested oh I just love that quickly whenever she realized that this is her opportunity this is her favor being poured upon her that would redeem her back to the image that God had in his mind oh Hallelujah so the favor of God would take her flesh and bring forth exploits cuz I I know that it's a simple story but we remember that she would run into the City and would say come see a man and the Bible would say uh would say this here that in John 4:28 then uh the woman left her water poot went into her way into the City and saith to the men come see a man which told me all the things that I ever done is this not the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him my the men of the city believe the pros could you imagine these men probably couldn't even be seen in a square mile from her their wives wouldn't even let him because they didn't want his reputation being ruined but something changed in this young lady not not not necessarily her flesh or or glow about her but her exploits changed her life started to produce something else they will look at her and would say I know what she used to do but something's different about her oh man if you want a witness be a witness for God be a reflection your friends know what you used to do co-workers know what you used to do how you used to drink you used to cuss you used to do these things but now something different is on the inside of your life don't come see you man oh my if you want to you want to see Soul save let your life witness that there's a resurrection savior there's somebody that can break the chains and the addictions come see a man they realize something had taken place her life was an exploit you see like I said this morning an exploit ain't always some big Supernatural things sometimes exploits are the simple things sometimes exploits is just a mama getting up and preparing preparing a meal for her children raising a paradox sometimes exploits it's just the life being lived you know brother Brandon would would tell the story about the young girl that wore a skirt I believe I I believe she was a waitress and there was a uh a big a big old church across the street from the restaurant and they were all dressed in pants or our shorts I believe and brother Brandon would say her life is condemning them she was she her life was an exploit oh my our lives are exploits you remember that the man that set up the pool of Bethesda where the Brandon would say there was worse cases than what he had and the Bible would tell us the lame was there the halt was there all of these other worst cases was there so you would think if God wanted an exploit if God wanted the profound Miracle he would go to the lame man right he would go to the blind man but brother Brandon would say that this man was just tired this man was just weary he could get up he could walk around he could talk but he was just tired so you would think that God would go to somebody that he could get more Glory out of oh and too many times we think that I don't got much to offer this one has a bigger testimony that one God's working greater over there but what you have just give it to him he's looking for an exploit you would see brother Brandon would tell us that many people think that this man full of compassion talking about Jesus full of compassion how come he didn't stop at the others and brother Brandon would say many people uh uh they they uh they they they they misplaced compassion with human sympathy he says compassion is doing the will of the father and so whenever God full of compassion was walking by all of the other ones it was the favor coming to election oh Hallelujah they had more to offer they had more to give but he had a purpose he had an elected seed that the purpose or the the favor of God would come to him oh Hallelujah and the favor of God has come the compassion of God the will of God has come to your life it says you might not have much to give you might not have much to offer but you've got a purpose you've got a purpose it's the favor come to your life bypassed everybody else and brought the favor it was the favor of God that will come to the the tomb of Lazarus and we say Lazarus come forth how come it didn't go and say Billy Bob come forth he come for Lazarus all right Jim Bob come forth Mary Sue come forth he come for Lazarus and oh my God come for you this evening God Has Come For You in this generation it says I know your neighbor might have more to give this one might have more to give but I've come for you this message called your name and brother Brandon would tell us how come he would say Lazarus come forth because if he would have said come forth the whole Cemetery would have come forth but he didn't come for everybody he come for Lazarus you know what what is so incredible about the The Story of Lazarus is he just restored his identity that he had before the fall because we know after he died he was known as dead and Jesus would call him dead he would say remove the stone away from the man of the man that is dead he lived among the dead you know but once Jesus come and the stone was rolled away he didn't say dead man come forth he said Lazarus He restored the identity that he had before he was dead and what what did this message do it just restored the identity that you had in the mind of God since you was redeemable since you was in the mind of God the favor of God would come and say hey you don't belong in that you don't belong in the dump you don't belong in the chicken pan I'm bringing you your identity oh you was always in the mind of God and I'm pouring out the favor upon your life oh Hallelujah reveal the mystery of God so there can be a people know their identity oh we got to know who we are but he hasn't just chosen us or just predestinated us for anything but he poured out his favor so we can produce exploits and I read the scripture this morning you have not chosen me John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you ask of my father the father in my name he may give it to you that your fruit should remain so he so Lazarus wasn't just called out of the Grave just to stay around the graveyard he was called out of the Grave to go back to his inheritance could you imagine being Lazarus he was in the grave for three days and you know he would come out of the Grave come into his house and could you just imagine there's somebody sitting on his couch or somebody eating his food and he would say hey this is my house and they would say no you're dead he would say no I'm not dead I'm standing in front of you no you are dead now then what would take place he would call the authorities and get the title deed and would say no my name is on the deed I'm standing in front of you then the authorities would kick him out it was because since his identity was restored all of the inheritance he had was restored with it oh my when this message brought you your identity the variety store all of your inheritance was given back to you so if you see a squatter setting on your peace setting on your joy say hey it's mine brother Brandon would say call the call the authorities when brother Brandon would talk about the little cop you remember the little cop he says he would he was a little scrawny fella that would step into the road and blow his whistle and he says all those cars would come to a stop because behind him was the whole city he had the whole police force he couldn't stop it but the police force could and oh my you might not be able to get the enemy out of your joy out of your peace but you've got all of Heaven back in you up you've got almighty God saying hey it's yours it's your inheritance oh Hallelujah so God didn't just choose us but he appointed he appointed to us and that word ordained means to appoint or to set so if you you have not chosen me but I chosen you and set you that you should bring forth fruit oh I've set you our placed you or adopted you so that you can bring forth fruit oh my that your fruit should remain you see many people want to operate the supernatural but they fail to live a life and the Bible would tell us in Daniel 1:8 but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself and that I really love that he didn't just purpose in his heart but then he requested he started making changes many people purpose in their heart at church but then they go home and they lose it but Daniel is he saying here I'm going to request he would go to the one that was giv him the meat that was giving him the wine and would say hey no more and I think it's time we start doing that amen I'm not going back to that land the land of rebellion the land of bitterness the land of Gossip I'm not going back I'm not just requesting I'm purposing ing I'm not just purposing I'm requesting I'm making changes then the Bible would say now God have brought Daniel under favor so once there was a purposed heart then the favor would be poured upon him then the Bible would tell us in Daniel 1:15 at the end of the 10 days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat so now their flesh was a Vindication what Daniel had was the truth oh come on now our flesh our life our exploits is a Vindication that this message is the truth cuz we know that Daniel he would go to the the prince of the Unix and would say give us 10 days we'll eat our own thing drink our own thing and let the rest of the boys do do drink and eat what you got for him and let our countenances determine if we got what we have is right and then the Bible saying at the end of the 10 days their life appear more fairer oh my not just in the mind not just in the in the soul but their flesh oh my it's a living gospel this message is a living thing that can come and take a life and transform it that the rest of the world can see exploits that they can see a life being changed the Bible would tell us in Matthew 12:35 a good man out of a good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things right brother Brandon would say this he would say now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but what are you but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing it hacking it into pieces taking what you want leaving what you don't want you're are not interested in living it he's talking to the church world that you have this you have that all you're doing is dividing it you're not interested in living it but I don't believe that's our attitude we're not just hacking it in the pieces we're not just arguing but we are interested in living it we don't want this word we're not we're not getting in the tapes to argue we're not getting in the tapes to debate we're getting in the tapes to live it God I want a reflection upon the Earth and my life and you see the favor of God wasn't just lift Daniel up but for exploits to be in his inside of his flesh and you see the Bible would tell us of 1 Peter 2 and9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness into Marvelous Light and I like how scoffield puts it he describes Praises as virtues oh my and that really done my heart good uh you you should show forth the virtues of the one who hath called you and so the very life of God we are shining forth since God has called us there's a life on the inside that way you're manifesting he called us to shine forth the virtues or excellencies of God himself and brother Brandon would say what he is she is to manifest he would he would say this here the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes or his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all of his works are perfect oh all of his works are perfect and he's one the start of the work in your life he's going to be faithful to complete it God is going to have a masterpiece prde upon the Earth the devil may try to Mar it he may try to bring it down but since God has a purpose the favor of God is bringing it to pass we are just expressing his virtues and we would see that Abraham would just be a reflection to what deity can do we know Adam had already fallen the Covenant between God and man was broken so when God would come to Abraham he went to make a covenant with God and in God in Abraham he would make a covenant with himself and like I read the quote this morning that God would call Abraham by his grace not what you can do Abraham but what I can do but we see that the blessing could not come the past until Abram had a name change and what was so special about the name change it was deity picking up Fallen man and reflecting himself through it cuz we know brother Brandon would tell us the children was supposed to come by the spoken word right in the beginning but because of the Fall it's no longer the spoken word but now it's by sex and the reason of this the Fallen condition is the reason they couldn't have children but here God would come to a cursed human being the wouldn't have children and turn the curse into a blessing so that in his flesh somebody that could not produce it could be a reflection oh my that's why God has come to humanity that in themselves could not be good in themselves could not produce the word he would come to a fallen Humanity pour out his favor pour out himself to that generation so there could be a reflection oh the Bible would say how be it our God has turned the curse into a blessing and we would know what would happen where the Brandon would tell us that Elohim God would take the last letters of Elohim and would put it onto Abraham so now onto Abram so no longer was it Abram the man now it's Elohim God coming to Abram the man so now it's God coming to it's deity coming to humanity to produce a reflection oh my brother brandom says it was a portion of Elohim so if a portion of Elohim could produce a body Chang what about the fullness oh come on now a portion of Elohim would show him Jehovah Gyra a portion of Elohim would change his body a portion of Elohim would bring the promised child what about all of God but the Brandon would say all that was in God was in Christ all that was in Christ he pours into the church we haven't just got a portion of God all that God has been poured out upon this church I say there should be Reflections when we go to work it's a reflection when we go to school it's a reflection if we're in the kitchen it's a reflection if we're taking our our children to school it's a reflection it's deity coming inside of humanity oh Hallelujah somebody knows their God and they producing exploits oh brother the Brandon would say then he changed his name from Abram to Abraham he would say and hm was a part of God's name did you notice that did it ever soak down in it Abram Elohim see he put a part of God 's name because God is the father of all he made his name being Elohim he put a part of his name with Abram Abraham see he made him a partner with him through his seed he would bring forth a seed and will and bless every nation in the earth he'll be the father of many nations and I'll get this part Abraham would reproduce the faith of Elohim Abraham would reproduce the faith of Elohim in other words what God was producing Abraham now would produce oh come on now just like God is the word now we're producing the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us there's another body upon earth that is producing the word and brother Brandon would say just like and just like the bridegroom was the word so must the bride be the word we're reproducing the same things that God produced oh Hallelujah it was after the blessing and brother Brandon would say that whenever Michelangelo would get a sculpture and build a sculpture he would strike the knee and would say speak and brother Brandon would say there was nothing in that's in inside of that sculpture to speak but then he would say God didn't God want to do that he would step into the Masterpiece and would say Speak oh Hallelujah he didn't just create you and would say hey do this do that keep my Commandments keep my word produce the Rapture he would say no I've got you on earth now I'm stepping into you to produce the supernatural it ain't you producing the supernatural it's deity inside of humanity producing the resurrection sign oh hallelujah it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever in a fallen human being that has been lifted up by the favor of God oh hallelujah it's a mama that fights mind battles fights headaches it's the Dy that has back pain the goost to work but deities inside of that body producing the supernatural oh Hallelujah God has stepped into this bride the Bible would say in 1 Peter 3:9 not rendering evil for evil or reing for reing but contris blessing knowing that you were there unto called that you should inherit a blessing we're called to inherit the blessing so the same blessing that Abraham had in portion we have in fullness oh come on now the same blessing he had on portion we have in fullness now you may say what's that what are you talking about brother Josh brother Brandon would tell us if you go to the ocean and take a cup with you he says if you dip it in the ocean you don't have all of the ocean but everything the ocean has is in that cup and brother Brandon would tell us what Jesus had in fullness we have in portion but all that he had is in this bride oh every aspect every Power every word is in the bride oh Hallelujah so we are called to inherit the portion that God has in this generation oh I say it's my inheritance to have a Revival it's my inheritance to see my children saved it's my inheritance to see the church in Revival I'm claiming it I'm going to arise and walk through the inheritance that God has given me this ain't time to lay the word down it's time to pick it up and see what God has has given us oh the Bible Will Tell Us in Isaiah 65 and8 thus sayeth the Lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one sayith destroy it not for a blessing is in it and we know that the new wine is the type of the Holy Ghost for the brand tell us the body of Christ is one Spirit where every member from Pentecost to this time drinks of the same new wine the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the same results so the the Bible tells us destroy not the new wine for inside of it is the blessing oh but the Bible would tell us touch not the oil or the wine but the Brandon would say the the wine is the the Holy Ghost and oil and oil is stimulation of Revelation I might have got that backwards but you see he's saying it for reason don't touch it because there's a blessing inside of it oh you can't the devil can do what he want he can bring discouragement but he cannot touch the new wine he cannot touch the blessing he can bring discouragement he can bring mind battles he can bring aches and pains but there's a blessing that is reserved to the elect that the devil has no right to get into hallelujah it's deity stepping into humanity and brother brandham talks about the picture and he would say the negative has begun has become the positive and he says our life here is in a negative form but there's a positive somewhere there can't be a negative without the positive oh but he says now the negative has become the positive our life has taken on the image of what God had in his mind and he would say this here so when so when we see so when we see that our life is here in in the negative and knowing that we are an image of some life somewhere else then we know that there is a positive somewhere that the light has struck and it's reflected something on the earth and we are only that reflection the genuine object is somewhere if that is that I'm a worst deceived man in the world I've spent my life in vain but I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is here that's why we are here what is the positive it's the word coming to a bride and reflecting itself oh the the bride and the groom has come together and is producing the life of the word brother Brandon going say this now if those are the attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore must that must be the word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of the hour that's what the word bride means is the manifestation of the word in the season that it is alloted you see Mary was just a body for that word to be produced through and we're just a body for the word of God to be produced through so God has taken a body that is under a curse and has turned it into a blessing oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say the days of Miracles are passed he says let them prove it and I love how he says that let them prove it he says not what you call a super race what God calls a super race he says what is the super race he says it's uh because they got what a supernatural power with Supernatural signs through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God he says you talk about super Supernatural God in a supernatural body in a natural people giving Supernatural signs he says yes a super race they that know their God shall do exploits great exploits and show Supernatural signs of people oh my Supernatural signs of people what is a supernatural sign well the Brandon would say the greatest Miracle is the life being transformed well I'm not doing away with Miracles I'm just saying too many people look for them and Fa to see that you are a miracle you get up in the morning you're a miracle you got a sound mind you're a miracle you got your children sitting on a front Pew it's a miracle don't mistake the big things brother BR I'm going to say this here this is just ordinary Indian paper but what it's but it's what is on it it's God's letter and God's it's God's letter form yes sometimes and it's no matter how little it is that's where people make our mistake we're always wanting to do something big but maybe we wasn't ordained to do something big come on now maybe you wasn't ordained to cast Devils out maybe you wasn't ordained to speak speaking tongues maybe you wasn't ordained to see Visions but God has ordained you to live a life and the supernatural would come through that life oh Hallelujah the Supernatural is going to come through that life let our musicians come this evening I like how the the Bible would say in Romans 11:3 Lord is talking about Elijah Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down th altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to bail even so then at this present time there was also a Remnant according to the election of Grace oh I love that cuz here was a prophet that was saying you know there's not going to be rain nor due till I call for it he was producing the Supernatural and he says Lord Am I by myself am I the only one that the Supernatural is operating through and he would say no I've got 7,000 they may not be like you but they haven't bowed their knee oh they haven't bowed their knee they still got exploits they might not be speaking the word like you are they might not be seeing visions like you are but they have not bowed their knee and if you haven't bowed your knee to the spirits of leoa keep pressing on keep pressing on there's exploits in there there's exploits every time you fight a depression spirit and you get through it that's an exploit amen I have reserved to myself to myself 7,000 who have not bowed their knee oh Hallelujah and he's re he's reserved you for this time like I said this morning about Esther such a time as this he's reserved you for such a time as this for exploits amen let's bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for your love and your mercy God thank you for your spirit Lord thank you for the blessing that you've poured out upon this generation Lord the favor God you've given us Lord just like Abraham you would say I'm going to do this I'm going to do that but then Thou shalt be a blessing Lord he was to reflect what you was doing through him and Lord we're just a reflection of what you're doing in this generation Lord not what we can do but what you can do Lord the Bible would say the city is exalted because of the blessing Lord the reason why we're somebody on Earth is because of the blessing we're exalted into two Heavenly places father Lord we want to say thank you for your mercy in Jesus name amen what are you playing The More I Seek [Music] You the more I find you The More I
