[40:39] We're going to change the time to 10:00
[40:44] instead of 11. And um I've uh been asked
[40:50] to do that every year and I keep
[40:52] forgetting uh to announce it. And so um
[40:56] anyway, so u we'll be having starting
[40:59] the service this year at at 10
[41:03] on the fall festival. Also, brother
[41:06] Wayne uh Lawson be with us. the 19th
[41:10] through the 21st of December. And so we
[41:13] want to remember that as well. Amen.
[41:17] Before we go into the word, may we just
[41:20] bow our heads and talk to the Lord.
[41:24] Precious Father, we're so thankful that
[41:27] we have a refuge in you,
[41:30] Lord. You made yourself available,
[41:34] Lord, and not driving us away as you did
[41:39] there in the garden when man had sinned,
[41:43] but you've made a way, Lord, that we
[41:46] could come and you're welcoming us to
[41:50] eat of the tree of life. And we're so
[41:52] thankful that we can today,
[41:56] Lord. Just asking that you would move
[41:58] among us tonight. take what simple words
[42:02] we'd have, Lord, to speak. And you know
[42:05] what's on my heart and I pray, Lord,
[42:07] that you would just bless your people,
[42:10] those that are sick and not able to be
[42:12] here. I pray that you would just touch
[42:15] them. Father, we just ask it, Lord, in
[42:20] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:24] Praise the Lord. So we want to
[42:27] look at uh John the 14th chapter
[42:33] and uh the first verse it says, "Let not
[42:36] your heart be troubled.
[42:38] You believe in God, believe also in me.
[42:43] In my father's house are many mansions.
[42:45] If it were not so, I would have told
[42:47] you, I go to prepare a place for you.
[42:50] And if I go and prepare a place for you,
[42:53] I will come again and receive you unto
[42:56] myself, that where I am, there you may
[42:59] be also.
[43:01] Amen. You can have your seats. And um
[43:06] good to have brother Amos and sister
[43:09] Lisa back with us and heard they had a
[43:12] good service. So we thank the Lord for
[43:14] that over the weekend. And um uh going
[43:18] to use the title
[43:20] again. Uh there is a place prepared for
[43:23] me and um you know I'm
[43:28] so glad that
[43:30] we have a place to go and I'm looking
[43:34] forward to that time.
[43:36] And so in our opening scripture,
[43:40] Jesus is
[43:42] letting the believer know that u that
[43:48] there is life after death.
[43:51] And so but he starts out by saying, "Let
[43:54] not your heart be troubled."
[43:57] &gt;&gt; And I don't think that he wants our
[43:59] heart troubled tonight.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he's
[44:04] then he lets us know that he's going to
[44:07] prepare for our future.
[44:10] Amen. And um
[44:14] he says I go to prepare a place and it
[44:17] wasn't that he went to a place called
[44:21] Texas now that known as Texas or a place
[44:25] now known as Maine or
[44:28] uh or some other continent or whatever
[44:33] uh here in the world uh where he went
[44:37] this place could not be accessed. test
[44:41] by boat or plane or train, automobile or
[44:46] what whatever it would be.
[44:49] But the Bible says that he was taken up.
[44:54] He was taken up and received
[44:57] uh uh and a cloud received him out of
[45:00] their sight.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And
[45:05] Bible says that the angels appeared to
[45:08] the disciples and said, "Why gaze you
[45:10] into the heavens?"
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't anything
[45:18] uh that man could make that took him to
[45:22] this place. But yet, he went because
[45:25] it's it's another world. It's a it's
[45:28] another place. The Bible mentions a few
[45:33] times of the world that is to come.
[45:38] Jesus said if a man speaks against the
[45:41] Holy Ghost uh of what has been done in
[45:44] this day as we know that it will not be
[45:47] forgiven him in this world or the world
[45:51] to come.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Right? In Paul's writings, we see that a
[45:56] man can taste the word of God and the
[46:01] powers of the world to come.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; That's that's what Paul would tell us,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And so then there's a there's a world
[46:09] that is is different from what we are
[46:14] used to.
[46:16] uh and and so Jesus would say in my
[46:20] father's
[46:21] uh uh kingdom
[46:24] are many palaces and if it were not so
[46:29] then I would not have told you I go to
[46:32] prepare a place for you. So, so in my
[46:36] father's kingdom, it isn't in in the
[46:39] kingdom of man, it's it's the father's
[46:42] kingdom.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And and and in that kingdom are many
[46:47] palaces and and these things. So, uh uh
[46:52] where Christ has gone to has nothing to
[46:56] do with this world, right?
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Uh the place that he has prepared for
[47:00] us. uh this place is in the world to
[47:04] come.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh and and the prophet says
[47:09] we enter into this world at the end of
[47:13] the road at at the end of of this life,
[47:17] our journey, then we enter into this
[47:21] world. And so if you of course our
[47:25] opening scripture we read there in John
[47:27] 1 through3 he's talking about uh let not
[47:31] your heart be troubled. I I go to to
[47:34] prepare a place I will come back and
[47:38] receive you unto myself that where I am
[47:41] you may be there also. Then if you go
[47:44] down to the 27th chapter, John 14:27,
[47:49] Jesus says, "Peace I leave with you. My
[47:52] peace I give unto you, not as the world
[47:56] giveth."
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and then then he says uh
[48:02] uh not as the world giveth give I unto
[48:05] you, let not your heart be troubled,
[48:08] &gt;&gt; neither let it be afraid. saying the
[48:11] same again. Let not your heart be
[48:14] troubled. I'm I'm going to leave my
[48:16] peace with you.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this peace isn't going to be
[48:20] with what the world gives and and
[48:22] through entertainment and through uh
[48:25] money and materialistic things and uh uh
[48:29] these things and and so brother Brandon
[48:32] would tell us there is no peace to a
[48:34] troubled heart. Amen. So you cannot have
[48:37] peace and have a troubled heart. Amen.
[48:40] So he's telling us don't don't have a
[48:43] troubled heart. I'm going to leave you
[48:45] with my peace. I'm going to give you my
[48:47] peace. Amen. So you won't have a
[48:50] troubled heart. Amen. And and he speaks
[48:53] words of peace. Amen. U and the prophet
[48:57] says this. This is why he tells the
[49:00] disciples, he tells the believers, uh,
[49:03] uh, I'm going to prepare a place and I'm
[49:05] going to come back and receive you unto
[49:08] myself that where I am, you may be there
[49:10] also. He's saying these things. Amen.
[49:13] Because he doesn't want us to think
[49:15] about anything else.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He He doesn't want
[49:19] us to think about anything else. We are
[49:22] to keep our minds on these things.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't look to the left.
[49:28] Don't look to the right. Don't Don't get
[49:30] your mind bogged down with with the
[49:33] worldly things. Amen. There's a future.
[49:36] And I'm telling you, there's a future.
[49:38] You've got a future. Amen. And it's not
[49:40] in this life. It's it's it's life after
[49:44] death. It's a in another world that is
[49:46] to come. And that's what I want you to
[49:48] think about.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And and so this is his comfort to the
[49:54] believer. Now, in in that same chapter,
[49:58] Jesus promised to send the Holy Ghost to
[50:01] be our comforter. Ain't that right? So,
[50:03] he starts out uh don't let your heart be
[50:05] troubled. He tells us what he's going to
[50:07] do. And he just keeps on laying there of
[50:10] of what what he's going to do. Now, I
[50:12] don't want you I'm going to leave you my
[50:14] peace. So, don't let your heart be
[50:16] troubled. Don't let it be afraid. I am
[50:19] going to leave you a comforter. I'm
[50:21] going to send my comforter uh back uh uh
[50:24] unto you. And we know that the Holy
[50:27] Ghost is our comforter. How many
[50:30] believes that it it's our comforter?
[50:32] Amen. See, and and so uh u uh you know,
[50:37] so he sends us the the the best
[50:40] comforter. I if there was any other way
[50:43] to comfort us, if there was any better
[50:45] way of comforing his people, he would
[50:48] have sent it. But he sends us the best
[50:50] that he could and that is the Holy
[50:53] Ghost.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why if you don't have
[50:56] the Holy Ghost, you need him.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you're looking to other
[51:00] things for peace, then you need the Holy
[51:03] Ghost because God God never promised,
[51:05] Amen. that we we should have comfort in
[51:08] the in words of doctors. Amen. Because
[51:11] there's going to be times the doctor's
[51:12] going to be limited. There's going to be
[51:14] time doctors ain't ain't going to know
[51:16] what to do. But but you should never
[51:18] lose comfort. Amen. And and when the
[51:21] doctor says we don't know what to do,
[51:23] you're going to die. You're you're this.
[51:25] You'll always be this. See, and and
[51:27] we're not to to find comfort in in
[51:30] whether we have money or what the
[51:32] president does and and cheap prices and
[51:35] and and quality things or or whatever.
[51:38] See? Amen. If you don't have the Holy
[51:41] Ghost, you need him.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so because Jesus said in
[51:47] John 14:26,
[51:49] he shall teach you all things and bring
[51:53] all things to your remembrance. See,
[51:56] whatsoever, now listen, what is he going
[51:58] to bring to your remembrance? Whatsoever
[52:01] things I have said unto you. Ain't that
[52:04] right? Amen. So, he's he's he's given
[52:07] them words of peace. He's telling them
[52:10] what the future is to every believer
[52:12] now. Now, it's not just to the
[52:14] disciples. He's he's laying this out to
[52:16] every believer. And then he says, I'm
[52:19] going to send the Holy Ghost to comfort
[52:21] you. And he's going to bring remembrance
[52:24] to your remembrance the things that I
[52:27] have said to you.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Paul says, "We have not
[52:30] received the spirit of the world, but we
[52:33] have received the spirit which is of
[52:36] God, which which come from God, which is
[52:39] a part of God." We'll say it. Which is
[52:41] God. Amen. That we might know the things
[52:45] that are freely given to us of God.
[52:49] Ain't that right? That we might know the
[52:52] things or be reminded of the things that
[52:56] Christ has talked about that the Bible
[52:59] has spoke of. Amen. Of the things that
[53:02] are freely given to us. Now, when this
[53:05] life is over, Amen. Jesus is letting us
[53:08] know that when this life is over, there
[53:12] there is a life that we go to,
[53:15] &gt;&gt; that we enter into. And the prophet said
[53:18] it's a continuing of this same life in
[53:22] another world in in another place. See?
[53:26] Amen. But what is in that place is new.
[53:31] Amen. That place is new. That world, the
[53:35] world in which we live. Amen. Today,
[53:38] now, present tense is is is called the
[53:41] old world. It it's it's the old world.
[53:44] There is an old earth and and an old
[53:48] heaven. Amen. And and the word old uh
[53:51] can mean the length of its existence.
[53:54] You know, uh uh the the the longer I
[53:58] live, I'm the older I'm getting. And and
[54:01] so we could call this world uh it's old.
[54:03] We can look at it by consider it old by
[54:06] the length of ex existence or it can
[54:10] also mean former. Amen. Former. Amen.
[54:15] Something in the past that's no longer
[54:18] continuing. Like you may, you know, uh
[54:21] uh may maybe you you had a old
[54:24] girlfriend before you got married or
[54:25] whatever and and she's a former that
[54:28] that's a former girlfriend. former, you
[54:30] know, or or maybe you once, you know, uh
[54:34] uh my former pastor passed away, you
[54:36] know, and and and he's no longer my
[54:39] pastor or or whatever or a former church
[54:42] or whatever, but it's something that
[54:44] used to be in in in your life, but it's
[54:47] no longer there. Used to be. See? And
[54:50] and so uh uh true believers know what
[54:54] the word old means. Amen. See, you you
[54:57] can be a teenager or an adolescent and
[55:01] know the meaning of the word old if you
[55:04] are a believer.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because 2 Corinthians 5:17, it
[55:10] says, "Therefore, if any man be in
[55:12] Christ, he is a new creature.
[55:16] Old things, everybody say old things.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Former things are passed away, and
[55:23] behold, all things are become new.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Romans 6:4. Therefore, we are buried
[55:32] with him by baptism into death. That
[55:36] like as Christ was raised from the dead
[55:39] by the glory of the father, even so, we
[55:42] also should walk in newness of life. So,
[55:48] if we're walking in newness, then
[55:50] there's an old life that we have left
[55:52] behind. There's a formal life that that
[55:55] we used to identify with, but now we're
[55:58] walking in newness of life. Ain't that
[56:02] right? So, after John was caught up on
[56:05] the Lord's day and I uh in really this
[56:09] day, he he saw he says, "I I saw a new
[56:12] heaven and a new earth." See, a a new
[56:16] heaven. So, so then that tells us that
[56:19] the old heaven was passed away,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; right? the old earth was passed away.
[56:26] And and he and he he saw that these
[56:28] things were passed away. And and so the
[56:31] the the the prophet said the old heaven,
[56:33] the old earth gives way to the new.
[56:37] Ain't that right? He said if we're to
[56:39] have a new earth, the old earth and the
[56:42] new earth cannot exist at the same time.
[56:45] Now, this is something that should
[56:47] comfort uh comfort our hearts. Amen. the
[56:50] things that that we're we're living in
[56:52] now, Amen. is is part of the old because
[56:56] we know that it's going to pass away.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the old and the new cannot
[57:02] cannot exist at the same time. The new
[57:04] world and the old world cannot exist.
[57:07] There can't be two world orders together
[57:10] at the same time. Now, in order to get
[57:12] the new earth, he says the old one has
[57:15] to die. Now if the old one has to die
[57:19] then it's giving birth painans for a new
[57:23] one right now. Can you say amen?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; If you look at John 21 and1
[57:31] uh it says I saw uh a new heaven and new
[57:35] earth for the first heaven the first
[57:37] earth were passed away. There was no
[57:40] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[57:44] new Jerusalem. Amen. Coming down from
[57:47] God out of heaven. Amen. So the old
[57:50] Jerusalem's got to give way. It's got to
[57:53] crumble. It's it's it's it's giving
[57:55] birth painans to the new. And and and I
[57:58] know they say pray for the peace of
[58:00] Jerusalem. Well, I'll tell you, we're
[58:01] not there ain't no peace for for
[58:03] Jerusalem of this old Jerusalem. It's
[58:06] got to pass away as we know what the
[58:08] Bible says. There's great turmoil and
[58:10] and things that are coming. Yes, God's
[58:12] going to visit Jerusalem. God's going to
[58:15] visit the the 144,000 and and things,
[58:18] but that's during the tribulation and
[58:20] and and and and things like that. But
[58:23] but what we're looking for is a new
[58:25] Jerusalem. Amen. Where the King of Peace
[58:29] reigns and there will be peace on earth.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[58:34] &gt;&gt; So, so new Jerusalem. I He said coming
[58:37] down from God out of heaven, prepared as
[58:40] a bride adorned for her husband. And I
[58:43] heard a great voice out of heaven,
[58:45] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[58:48] is with men, and he will dwell with
[58:50] them, and they shall be his people."
[58:53] Now, notice the condition of this new
[58:55] world. Amen. The tabernacle of God is
[58:58] with men. He will dwell with them. They
[59:01] will be his people. And God himself
[59:04] shall be with them and be their God. And
[59:07] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[59:10] eyes. And there shall be no more death,
[59:13] neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
[59:17] shall there be any more pain, for the
[59:20] former things have passed away.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that sat upon the throne
[59:29] says, "Behold, I make all things new."
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; It's a world to come.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] So,
[59:42] we find that we'll have a new body,
[59:46] right?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you don't believe that.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; How many believe you're going to have a
[59:51] new body?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and we're going to live in a
[59:56] new city.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a new civilization,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So, it's not going to be a civilization
[1:00:06] of education and science.
[1:00:09] It's not going to be anything of a
[1:00:12] civilization that has politics
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; or this type of a world order. It will
[1:00:18] not be an antichrist system. Amen.
[1:00:21] Brother Bram says education and wisdom
[1:00:24] of this world has turned the church into
[1:00:27] a bunch of ragweeds.
[1:00:29] It's education and educational system,
[1:00:32] science and civilization is of the
[1:00:35] devil. It's the devil's civilization.
[1:00:38] The Bible said so. And our civilization,
[1:00:42] everybody say, "Our civilization."
[1:00:44] Our civilization that's coming on will
[1:00:48] have nothing to do with this
[1:00:49] civilization at all.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; It's nothing of it at all. There will be
[1:00:54] a different civilization.
[1:00:57] So this would be an old civilization
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; and there is a new civilization
[1:01:04] in that new world that is to come.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so we find he says the
[1:01:12] the more scientific we get, further we
[1:01:15] go into death things, traps to kill and
[1:01:19] everything in that new civilization,
[1:01:21] there will be no death, no sickness,
[1:01:24] sorrow, no pain. There won't be none in
[1:01:27] there. So this civilization will have to
[1:01:30] be destroyed because it's of the devil.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so when that new
[1:01:37] come comes in, the old has to give way.
[1:01:40] It's just like winter, amen, has to give
[1:01:43] way to spring. Amen. Uh uh every season
[1:01:47] coming in, the old has to give way and
[1:01:50] die so a new season can come.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and no matter how cold it
[1:01:58] is and how frozen it gets and and and
[1:02:00] and all these things, as long as time is
[1:02:03] ticking, there's going to be a spring
[1:02:06] and death has to give way to life again.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; It it just has to. Death and life cannot
[1:02:13] exist.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. At the same time. Amen. See, so
[1:02:20] every mortal thing, the prophet said,
[1:02:21] must die so that immortality
[1:02:25] can take its place. Now, this is why we
[1:02:29] are at the end of all things.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; I I know that you know everybody keep
[1:02:34] trying to keep this thing running, keep
[1:02:37] time going, keep keep America living,
[1:02:40] keep it all strong. Amen. Let it let it
[1:02:43] get back renewed again. But there's got
[1:02:46] to come an end to it all. That's right.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; You see, we're about to cross that
[1:02:53] dividing line between mortality and
[1:02:56] immortality.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And and so nations,
[1:03:01] if you want to know why the havoc and
[1:03:03] all the troubles and all that, nations
[1:03:05] are giving away, amen, to the coming
[1:03:09] kingdom.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; This civilization is giving away to the
[1:03:13] coming civilization.
[1:03:15] This old earth is given away, amen, to
[1:03:19] to that new earth. Amen. The the heavens
[1:03:22] are given away, amen, to the to the new
[1:03:26] heavens. Amen. The earthly is given way
[1:03:30] to the heavenly.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And and so again, the prophet said, "Now
[1:03:34] it's a continuation of this same life in
[1:03:38] another world." In other words, we'll
[1:03:40] still be human beings. Amen. in that we
[1:03:44] will have a body like this.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; We'll have eyes to see. We'll have legs
[1:03:51] to walk. We'll we'll have ears to hear.
[1:03:54] We'll we'll we'll have these things. But
[1:03:56] there will be no death in it.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; There will be no sorrow there. There
[1:04:00] will be no heartbreak and and no tears
[1:04:03] to shed.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; No pain. Can you say amen?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, this body that we're in can
[1:04:11] be tempted and it makes mistakes even
[1:04:13] even if you do have the Holy Ghost. And
[1:04:16] and and there's a warfare that just
[1:04:18] constantly goes on. Amen. Matthew 22 and
[1:04:22] 23. Amen. It says the same day uh came
[1:04:26] to him Jesus the Sadducees
[1:04:30] would say that there is no resurrection
[1:04:33] and asked him saying master Moses said
[1:04:36] if a man die having no children his
[1:04:38] brother shall marry his wife and raise
[1:04:41] up seed unto his brother.
[1:04:44] Now there were with seven brethren, and
[1:04:46] the first, when he had married a wife,
[1:04:49] uh, deceased, having no issue, left his
[1:04:53] wife unto his brother. Likewise the
[1:04:55] second also, and the third unto the
[1:04:57] seventh. In other words, all these
[1:05:00] brethren died, and the wife was passed
[1:05:02] all the way down, amen, to the seventh.
[1:05:06] And last of all, the woman died also.
[1:05:09] Therefore, in the resurrection, whose
[1:05:11] wife shall she be of the seven? For they
[1:05:16] all had her as a wife. See? And Jesus
[1:05:20] answered and said unto them, you do
[1:05:22] heir, not knowing the scriptures, nor
[1:05:24] the power of God. For in the
[1:05:26] resurrection, they neither marry nor are
[1:05:29] given in marriage, but are as the angels
[1:05:33] of God in heaven. Yeah.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't say they are angels.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He just said they're as the angels.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said angels don't marry
[1:05:45] or give in marriage.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; The sex glands will be gone.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; So, we'll be living in this body. A a a
[1:05:55] body will be human. We ain't going to be
[1:05:57] a cloud. We ain't going to be just some
[1:05:59] ghost.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; We're living in a body.
[1:06:03] And yet the sex glands will be gone.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Right now we're living in a in a mortal
[1:06:10] kingdom, but one of these days we're
[1:06:12] going to live a in an immortal kingdom.
[1:06:16] Can you say amen? When brother Brandham
[1:06:19] had uh went beyond the curtain of time,
[1:06:23] he he saw the saints that had once lived
[1:06:27] in this old earth, this this world, and
[1:06:30] as mortal human beings, but they had
[1:06:33] crossed over into another world. They
[1:06:36] they they didn't they they didn't become
[1:06:38] a cloud like brother Brandham thought.
[1:06:40] He was kind of scared to die cuz he
[1:06:42] thought you'd just be a cloud just
[1:06:43] floating along and you know and and and
[1:06:46] these things and but when he went over
[1:06:48] there he realized that that it wasn't a
[1:06:51] cloud. we just didn't just didn't we we
[1:06:55] we're as human beings and he says see I
[1:06:58] when I seen that place and that
[1:07:01] condition with uh that those people were
[1:07:03] in and how beyond anything that this
[1:07:07] world could ever think of. It was
[1:07:09] glorious. There could not be sin there.
[1:07:12] No death nor nothing could enter that
[1:07:15] spot. And there was no different between
[1:07:18] men and women. only the sex glands was
[1:07:21] gone from them. So, so he says, "And
[1:07:25] there could never be no more adultery,
[1:07:28] no more nothing." But yet the woman was
[1:07:31] still a woman in the way of figure.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And the man was still a man in the way
[1:07:37] of figure. And they'll forever be that
[1:07:40] way.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If you're a man here,
[1:07:44] you're going to be a man up there,
[1:07:45] Brother John. Amen. Glad for that,
[1:07:48] right?
[1:07:49] Amen. See, and so then there there can
[1:07:53] be no more sin over there.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Lord
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; in that place,
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; brother Ram said, "These women were
[1:08:00] hugging me." And they were women. Now,
[1:08:03] you know what he says about in this in
[1:08:05] this world, he says, "Any red-blooded
[1:08:08] man that would hug a woman, there's
[1:08:10] sensation there. Don't don't care if you
[1:08:12] got the Holy Ghost or not. There there's
[1:08:14] a sensation." And that's why he tells
[1:08:16] us, "Amen, don't don't hug our sisters
[1:08:19] and sisters don't hug the brethren and
[1:08:21] and these things. You don't hug a
[1:08:22] woman." Ain't that right?
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; See, and and so uh but but he says here,
[1:08:28] he says, "But there was no possibility
[1:08:31] of ever being sin again because the
[1:08:36] glands of our bodies will be changed
[1:08:39] there."
[1:08:40] He says, "See, we're different sex now
[1:08:42] because that's that's uh uh for
[1:08:45] reproducing the world and our marriage
[1:08:48] to bring children, but then there will
[1:08:51] be no more need of that. There will be
[1:08:54] no children born. We won't have sex
[1:08:56] glands in the new world. Not at all. But
[1:09:00] yet the woman will be woman in stature
[1:09:03] and men will be men. But there will be
[1:09:06] no more male and female among them in
[1:09:09] that way. And them glands won't be in.
[1:09:13] So there will be no way at all for Satan
[1:09:16] to ever play another trick on them.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So for you brothers, you
[1:09:31] know, us brothers, our wives
[1:09:34] will be no more than just a lovely woman
[1:09:37] to us. That's what brother Ram said. And
[1:09:41] for you sisters, your husband will be no
[1:09:43] more than just a lovely man. Amen. To
[1:09:46] you. But yet that man's yours. That
[1:09:48] woman is yours. He said you belong to
[1:09:51] each other. But yet the filio love part,
[1:09:54] the filio part won't be there. It'll be
[1:09:58] all agel. Can you say amen?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; So there will be no jealousy for there's
[1:10:03] nothing to be jealous about.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; You remember me to asking brother
[1:10:12] Brandham. So I got a question. You know
[1:10:15] when we get on that other side says you
[1:10:17] you know you did have hope as a wife.
[1:10:20] So, who gets you? Basically, you know,
[1:10:25] and uh he she says, you know, kind of
[1:10:28] like Hope was a little jealous
[1:10:31] uh when she was in on the earth. She's
[1:10:34] jealous of you. So, how's that going to
[1:10:36] work? And so, Brother Brandon says, "But
[1:10:39] you you forget that over on that side,
[1:10:43] there ain't going to be no sex glands in
[1:10:44] that way." So, so there ain't going to
[1:10:47] be no jealousy. there there ain't going
[1:10:49] to be no warfare fighting, you know,
[1:10:52] over over each other. Ain't that right?
[1:10:54] Cuz there ain't going to be nothing to
[1:10:55] be jealous about.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Talking about a place he's gone to
[1:10:59] prepare.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; So he says, you you never know such a
[1:11:03] thing as that. Just lovely young men and
[1:11:08] young women to live.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Now, it's amazing how that God
[1:11:15] foretells
[1:11:19] of things here in the things that he's
[1:11:21] made. When God in creation made things,
[1:11:25] he made it to where it would foretell of
[1:11:29] the future.
[1:11:31] You know, uh, of course, we were
[1:11:35] disconnected from God
[1:11:38] uh and had no fellowship with him
[1:11:42] and we thought that this was life. I I
[1:11:46] remember hearing brother Brandham
[1:11:48] talking about, you know, the lady girls.
[1:11:52] They were drinking and things and
[1:11:55] kept him up and I think he had just
[1:11:59] he got ready and he was getting ready to
[1:12:01] go to church and opened the door and
[1:12:04] come them two young ladies from America
[1:12:06] or whatever and um they said, "Oh, this
[1:12:10] is life."
[1:12:13] He stopped him and says, "No, this ain't
[1:12:16] life."
[1:12:17] Says, 'You know, uh, and he began to
[1:12:19] just talk to him a little bit. But see,
[1:12:22] we we thought this was life. We thought
[1:12:24] that this was our only future.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; How many people are living today
[1:12:30] thinking that this is the only future?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And and so we live for this life. We
[1:12:37] invested our time and our energy into
[1:12:41] this life. How many people do that yet
[1:12:43] today? They'll put church on the back
[1:12:45] burner, the things of God on the back
[1:12:48] burner
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; and they'll pour all their life and
[1:12:52] their energy, their time and everything
[1:12:56] into this life.
[1:12:59] We, you know, we fought for the things
[1:13:01] of this life. We were proud of the
[1:13:04] things we possessed in this life. It it
[1:13:07] it gave us a sense of u uh uh pride and
[1:13:12] and we couldn't just let go of this
[1:13:15] world.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; But see, everything that God created in
[1:13:20] this life speaks of another world.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And the reason I he could do that is
[1:13:29] because of his infinite knowledge,
[1:13:32] knowing what will be. and and God in his
[1:13:38] wisdom,
[1:13:39] he he wasn't just making things for the
[1:13:42] present, but he was looking into the
[1:13:45] future and and and so and and knowing
[1:13:49] what will be. I I thought of um Exodus
[1:13:54] 25 and1.
[1:13:56] It says, "And the Lord spake unto Moses,
[1:13:58] saying, speak unto the children of
[1:14:00] Israel, that they bring me an offering
[1:14:04] of every man that giveth it willingly
[1:14:07] with his heart, you shall take my
[1:14:09] offering." Then you go to the eighth
[1:14:11] verse. and let them make a sanctuary,
[1:14:14] that I may dwell among them, according
[1:14:17] to all,
[1:14:20] that I show thee after the pattern of
[1:14:23] the tabernacle, and the pattern of all
[1:14:25] the instruments thereof, even so shall
[1:14:28] you make it. The 40th verse, and look
[1:14:33] that thou make them after their pattern
[1:14:38] which was showed thee in the mount.
[1:14:41] Then if you go to numbers 8 and4
[1:14:45] and this work of the candlestick was of
[1:14:49] beaten gold unto the shaft thereof unto
[1:14:52] the flowers thereof was beaten work
[1:14:55] according unto the pattern which the
[1:14:58] Lord had showed Moses. So he made the
[1:15:02] candlestick.
[1:15:04] Then in Hebrews 8 and3, for every high
[1:15:08] priest
[1:15:10] is ordained to offer gifts and
[1:15:13] sacrifices,
[1:15:14] wherefore it is of necessity that this
[1:15:17] man have somewhat also to offer. For if
[1:15:20] he were on earth, he should not be a
[1:15:23] priest, seeing that there are priests
[1:15:25] that offer gifts according to the law,
[1:15:28] who serve unto the example and shadow.
[1:15:32] Everybody say shadow of heavenly things.
[1:15:37] Who serve unto the example and shadow of
[1:15:40] heavenly things as Moses was admonished
[1:15:44] of God when he is about to make the
[1:15:46] tabernacle. For heh saith he thou that
[1:15:50] thou make all according to the pattern
[1:15:53] show to thee in the mount. Ain't that
[1:15:56] right?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 9:21.
[1:15:59] Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both
[1:16:02] the tabernacle and all the vessels of
[1:16:05] the ministry. And almost all things are
[1:16:09] by the law pers with blood, and without
[1:16:11] shedding of blood, there is no
[1:16:13] remission. It was therefore nec uh
[1:16:17] necessary that the pattern of things in
[1:16:21] the heavens should be purified with
[1:16:24] thieves. The pattern of things. Hello.
[1:16:29] So he made the pattern after the things
[1:16:33] in heaven.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; He saw what was the heavenly
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; and God required him to pattern the
[1:16:43] things that he made uh on earth after
[1:16:47] those things in heaven.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; So God would not let Moses just build
[1:16:54] any tabernacle
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; uh on earth.
[1:16:58] God just didn't say, "Moses, build me a
[1:17:00] tabernacle." Okay, I'll I'll I'll take
[1:17:02] care of that for you. And then God just
[1:17:05] leave it up to him to make any old
[1:17:08] tabernacle the way he wanted it. God
[1:17:10] would require him. This tabernacle is to
[1:17:14] be made after the heavenly.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You see, it's I believe it had to be a
[1:17:24] continuation of everything else that God
[1:17:28] made on the earth. And so this word
[1:17:31] tabernacle means a dwelling place or or
[1:17:34] or tent. And and God wanted to meet with
[1:17:39] his people and have fellowship with his
[1:17:41] people. Ain't that right?
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the whole goal. God
[1:17:45] wanted fellowship. God wanted his people
[1:17:48] to understand him and to know him. Amen.
[1:17:51] And and he become one of them. So he
[1:17:54] would take Moses on the top of the
[1:17:56] mountain and show him what kind of
[1:17:59] dwelling place that he was after
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; and that he desired to dwell in on
[1:18:06] earth. Can you say amen?
[1:18:09] So notice God showed Moses what the
[1:18:11] heavenly tabernacle was like and
[1:18:14] required that he patterned the earthly
[1:18:17] tabernacle after it. So the earthly
[1:18:20] tabernacle was a reflection of a
[1:18:23] heavenly tabernacle
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; from another world.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; So it was speaking not of itself. It was
[1:18:33] speaking of another one.
[1:18:39] Moses when he made this tabernacle, he
[1:18:41] made it from sheep skin.
[1:18:46] He didn't make it like we would make it
[1:18:48] with boards, lumber, but he made it with
[1:18:52] skin.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Showing that the heavenly tabernacle
[1:18:59] isn't made out of wood or stone,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:05] is made out of skin.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And and this tabernacle that Moses made
[1:19:13] of skin had three compartmentments in
[1:19:16] it,
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; The outer court,
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; the inner court or the the holy place
[1:19:22] and the holiest of holy,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; ain't that right?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And and all of these pointed to Christ.
[1:19:31] Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Another tabernacle.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. What Moses laid out, that outer
[1:19:43] court, inner court, the holiest of holy,
[1:19:46] it was the compartments.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And it all spoke of Christ. Every bit of
[1:19:53] the furniture that was used in that
[1:19:55] tabernacle was a pattern.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Of Christ. That's right.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; It all pointed to Christ. No wonder the
[1:20:04] Bible says all the fullness of the
[1:20:07] Godhead dwelt bodily in Christ.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Even in Acts 7:48, it was said by
[1:20:17] Stephen that Solomon built God and
[1:20:20] house. We know that he built an house.
[1:20:23] But Stephen says, "But how be it, the
[1:20:25] Most High dwelleth not in temples made
[1:20:29] with hands, as saith the prophet,
[1:20:33] most high does not want to dwell in the
[1:20:36] temple
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; made with hands."
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; We can make him a house. We can make
[1:20:42] lumber and and build the stone and build
[1:20:45] such significance, but that's not what
[1:20:48] God wanted.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Christ was God made
[1:20:55] flesh.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Human skin.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Moses patterned that tabernacle after
[1:21:06] the heavenly.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't take human skin. He had
[1:21:11] to take animal skin. Yeah.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; But God could create himself a body
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; and come and dwell in skin.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said God unfolded himself
[1:21:28] into a mortal being
[1:21:31] and it was God dwelling in a three- room
[1:21:34] house.
[1:21:36] Right.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Just like Moses. outer court, inner
[1:21:40] court, holiest of holy. You know, you
[1:21:43] are a three- room house.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Body, soul, and spirit. Can you say
[1:21:47] amen?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And and just as the sun can shine and
[1:21:54] they get cloudy and the rain and all
[1:21:56] these things on that outer court, so
[1:21:59] does your your your outward. It's up and
[1:22:02] down. It's it's like this. And and as
[1:22:04] the inner cord they light that they it
[1:22:07] would be lit by candles and yet them
[1:22:10] candles would go out. It would get smoky
[1:22:12] and all that. So it is on your spirit
[1:22:15] trim.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; But down in that soul
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; is where the mercy seat is.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Down in that soul is where the shakana
[1:22:24] glory is.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:30] So,
[1:22:32] brother Bram said, "The earthly things
[1:22:34] only express what the eternal things
[1:22:36] are. They only express that there's a
[1:22:40] greater of the same kind
[1:22:43] because these are a same kind."
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; So, this world is testifying of another
[1:22:50] world.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You are testifying of another. Amen.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Your body, my body is testifying of a
[1:23:02] greater body.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The earthly is only testifying of
[1:23:12] something greater that's beyond.
[1:23:17] 2 Corinthians 5:1 Paul says, "For we
[1:23:20] know that if our earthly house, this old
[1:23:22] flesh, this old tabernacle, the earthly
[1:23:26] house of this tabernacle were dissolved,
[1:23:28] we have a building of God."
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And house not made with hands, eternal
[1:23:34] in the heavens.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Now, this isn't just something that
[1:23:39] that's we're waiting for it to it's
[1:23:41] already there
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; in another world. Yes.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For in this in this
[1:23:49] this earthly body, we grown. Everybody
[1:23:52] say we grown.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; We grown earnestly,
[1:23:57] desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:24:01] house which is from heaven. If so be
[1:24:04] that being clothed, we shall not be
[1:24:06] found naked. For we that are in this
[1:24:09] tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not
[1:24:13] for that we would be unclothed, but
[1:24:16] clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:24:20] swallowed up of life.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Now, we love this earth that we live in.
[1:24:26] We we love the scenery. I love just
[1:24:29] going out and taking drives
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; on the back roads and looking at the
[1:24:33] beauty of the mountains and the the
[1:24:36] trees. We love to live and breathe the
[1:24:40] air.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Love to see the flowers and the
[1:24:43] mountains and the trees that God
[1:24:45] created. Ain't that right?
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; But this is only an expression
[1:24:53] of another world to come.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; For I go to prepare a place.
[1:24:59] Now that word expression means something
[1:25:02] that manifests,
[1:25:04] embodies or symbolizes something else.
[1:25:09] Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; So the trees that you see here is just a
[1:25:14] reflection. It embodies symbolizes
[1:25:18] something and another world.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:26] the things that we love here in this
[1:25:29] life in the way of God's creation, it
[1:25:32] has to die. We see trees that die
[1:25:36] and and that'll never come back. they
[1:25:39] fall or flowers that die.
[1:25:44] But the one that's dying
[1:25:47] is only expressing
[1:25:50] that there's another one
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; that will never die.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:02] Brother Bram says when you see a tree
[1:26:04] struggling, pulling, trying to live,
[1:26:07] that means there's a tree somewhere that
[1:26:09] doesn't have to do that.
[1:26:11] When you see a man here struggling to
[1:26:13] live, somebody in a hospital or in a
[1:26:15] sick bed, in an accident struggling, and
[1:26:18] the death rattle is in their throat
[1:26:20] pulling and crying and screaming for
[1:26:22] life. What does that mean? There's a
[1:26:24] place somewhere.
[1:26:27] There's a body that doesn't struggle and
[1:26:30] scream for that. It just doesn't do it.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; So, the things that
[1:26:39] God has given us in this life are just
[1:26:42] temporary gifts
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; for you to enjoy while you're here.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:49] able to enjoy the mountains and the
[1:26:51] trees and the the flowers and
[1:26:55] uh just the the life here. It it's it's
[1:26:59] it's temporary gifts, but they're
[1:27:02] expressing a place.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Where we're going.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:13] I thought of brother Biscll as he gave
[1:27:16] his testimony of how um that he was
[1:27:20] somewhere in Canada way up in the
[1:27:22] mountains with brother Brandham and they
[1:27:25] were just sitting or standing there just
[1:27:27] looking at all the beauty.
[1:27:31] He says, "Oh, brother Bram, this is just
[1:27:32] so beautiful."
[1:27:36] Brother Bram says, "You know what,
[1:27:37] Eddie?
[1:27:39] This is the way it's going to be in the
[1:27:40] millennium,
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; All this that you're enjoying, it's
[1:27:44] going to be there in the millennium.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Think of that. See, this is only
[1:27:48] expressing another reflecting another
[1:27:51] world.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So, so Jesus has gone to prepare not
[1:27:59] something that is temporal,
[1:28:02] but he's gone to prepare an eternal
[1:28:08] eternal. Never had a beginning and will
[1:28:12] never have an end. It's it's an eternal
[1:28:14] world. It's an eternal condition,
[1:28:18] an eternal civilization, an eternal
[1:28:21] people, an eternal city. And death
[1:28:24] cannot take it away from us. Age,
[1:28:29] it doesn't age with time. For there is
[1:28:32] no time.
[1:28:34] That's hard for us to understand being
[1:28:36] that we're creatures of time.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; It's hard to understand that there was a
[1:28:41] God that's always existed. He He didn't
[1:28:44] began. He didn't end. He always is.
[1:28:47] Always was
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; and and that's the place we're going.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; See, time came by sin.
[1:28:59] Brother Ram uses the example. He said,
[1:29:01] "You take a perfect circle. It just
[1:29:03] keeps going around and around. There's
[1:29:05] no end to it. But then sin brought in a
[1:29:09] gap.
[1:29:11] It it it it caused a a a gap in the and
[1:29:15] and and he says that this way it put a
[1:29:17] little hickey or a or a little drop in
[1:29:20] the chain. So it uh so it comes down.
[1:29:24] Eternity continues on, but it's not in
[1:29:27] its perfect condition. And there's a
[1:29:29] little gap comes down, breaks over this
[1:29:32] way and goes out this way. See, God had
[1:29:34] to do that because Satan caused it. And
[1:29:37] it dropped down to a space of time
[1:29:41] for the trying and the perfecting and
[1:29:45] for the purging of the lost. that God by
[1:29:49] his sovereign grace might someday lift
[1:29:53] that little hickey or gap back into the
[1:29:57] perfect circle.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Then she rose on just the same.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; We know Jesus is was from eternity to
[1:30:09] eternity.
[1:30:11] Amen. And and yet the prophet said he
[1:30:14] stepped into the time space and was made
[1:30:18] flesh.
[1:30:19] And he had 33 and a half years of time.
[1:30:24] But he dropped into that time space made
[1:30:27] flesh to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:30:31] blood all across this place to redeem it
[1:30:34] and connect it back with God again for
[1:30:37] all eternity. Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; So God dwells in eternity for he is
[1:30:47] eternal. Time means nothing to God.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; I want you to get that now. Time means
[1:30:57] nothing to God.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've been praying for a
[1:31:04] year." Time means nothing to God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:11] Psalms 90 and4
[1:31:14] for a thousand years in thy sight are
[1:31:17] but as yesterday
[1:31:19] when it is passed
[1:31:21] and as a watch in the night. So if if
[1:31:25] you were just if you lived a thousand
[1:31:27] years, it's just as yesterday to God
[1:31:31] when it's all passed. It it it means
[1:31:34] nothing. See 2 Peter 3:8, "But beloved,
[1:31:38] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[1:31:40] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[1:31:43] years, and a thousand years as one day."
[1:31:46] Ain't that right?
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; So here, 2,000 years ago, Jesus promised
[1:31:52] to come back
[1:31:56] and he says, "I I'll receive you unto
[1:31:59] myself that where I may be, you may be
[1:32:02] also." Can you say amen? That's right.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; But listen church, we cannot live with
[1:32:06] him as creatures of time.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he is taking us
[1:32:14] creatures of time and making us
[1:32:18] creatures of eternity.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Now think of it. This is what's going on
[1:32:25] now. He's taking us creatures of time
[1:32:28] and he's making us creatures of
[1:32:31] eternity.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. sons and daughters of his.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; So then there has to be a change over
[1:32:39] from time to eternity,
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; from mortal to immortality.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Now listen, church, he says, I'm going
[1:32:48] to prepare a place.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Not just up there, leave you here, but
[1:32:53] I'm going to come back and I'm going to
[1:32:55] take you there.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; That we can live together. But that
[1:32:59] place is an eternal place.
[1:33:03] No temporary. So there has to be a
[1:33:06] makeover, a change.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; So then the first thing, the thing that
[1:33:11] calls time must be abolished.
[1:33:15] So therefore, he paid the price of
[1:33:17] redemption at Calvary.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And what's the beginning of the change?
[1:33:24] The soul.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Your soul has to be changed from time to
[1:33:33] eternal.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said you're a time being
[1:33:41] until you're born again
[1:33:43] and then you're an eternal being.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can get it is to
[1:33:50] have part of God in you being eternal
[1:33:54] life. So when we we think of Holy Ghost,
[1:33:57] you know, the the apostolic Pentecost,
[1:33:59] they make the Holy Ghost all about
[1:34:00] emotions, rolling on the floor, jumping
[1:34:02] up and down, speaking in tongues,
[1:34:04] prophesying, and all of these things.
[1:34:06] But the Holy Ghost is a life of God,
[1:34:10] eternal that comes in you and makes you
[1:34:12] an eternal being.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Well, then that has to mean that one
[1:34:18] thing. If sin calls time and now you
[1:34:23] become eternal in your soul, then
[1:34:25] there's no sin held against you.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; That little nick
[1:34:34] or nich or hickey or gap has been taken
[1:34:38] away.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; You can't be saved today and lost
[1:34:43] tomorrow.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; That would be something temporary.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:34:50] Hallelujah.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; So there's no sin held against you.
[1:34:52] That's why the prophet said, "You are
[1:34:54] the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the
[1:34:56] son of the living God. Every man and
[1:34:59] woman that's born of the spirit of God,
[1:35:01] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ, and
[1:35:03] believes every word of God, stands as
[1:35:05] though you never sinned at the first
[1:35:07] place." You are perfect.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; So what you are in your soul will never
[1:35:14] change.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; It's eternal.
[1:35:19] Can you say amen?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Let the trials come.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Let all hell come.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Let let let let let let let let let let
[1:35:27] let let let let let let let let let let
[1:35:27] let let let let let let let let let let
[1:35:28] let let let let let let let let let let
[1:35:28] let let let let the floods let the fire
[1:35:29] let whatever come and your soul will
[1:35:32] never change.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; It can't change. It's eternal.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; It's it's been transformed. Oh yeah.
[1:35:42] Your body is still subject to time and
[1:35:44] it's getting older and weaker. It's
[1:35:46] still subject to to the the effects of
[1:35:50] sin and diseases and and and and all of
[1:35:53] these things. But that's going to change
[1:35:56] too.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You believe it.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; That's when total complete redemption
[1:36:04] happens. Happens.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 15:50.
[1:36:13] Paul says, ' Now this I say, brethren,
[1:36:15] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:36:17] kingdom of God. I'll say it again. Flesh
[1:36:20] and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of
[1:36:22] God, neither doth corruption inherit
[1:36:25] incorruption.
[1:36:26] So this is the mystery, right? He said
[1:36:28] it's a mystery. Behold, I show you a
[1:36:30] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[1:36:33] shall all be changed.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; We're not all going to go by the way of
[1:36:37] the grave, but we all going to be
[1:36:39] changed.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. those that have gone by
[1:36:41] the way of the grave and those that are
[1:36:43] still alive is going to be changed.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Not changed in your soul. That that
[1:36:49] change is happening now.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He says in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:36:58] an eye at the last trump for the trumpet
[1:37:00] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:37:03] incorruptible
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; and we shall be changed. For this
[1:37:08] corruptible must put on incorruption,
[1:37:10] and this mortal must put on immortality.
[1:37:13] So when this corruptible shall have put
[1:37:15] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[1:37:17] have put on immortality, then shall be
[1:37:20] brought to pass the saying that is
[1:37:22] written, death is swallowed up in
[1:37:25] victory.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; That gap has been taken away.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And you're back to a circle again.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you say
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Now notice the dead shall be raised. We
[1:37:40] shall be changed. And when this this
[1:37:42] happen when he comes to receive us.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:16. For the Lord
[1:37:51] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:37:54] the shout, with the voice of the
[1:37:56] archangel,
[1:37:59] with the trump of God.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:38:04] Can you say amen?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:38:10] be caught up together with them in the
[1:38:13] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:38:15] so shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; We become completely redeemed
[1:38:22] and we step into eternity.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:31] When brother Brandham
[1:38:34] experienced
[1:38:36] going beyond the curtain of time,
[1:38:40] he tried his best to describe eternity
[1:38:45] and
[1:38:47] what it would be like for us to live in
[1:38:49] eternity. and he talked how that it was
[1:38:53] been
[1:38:55] nearly 2,000 years
[1:38:58] since Christ had died.
[1:39:02] But he says that doesn't mean one little
[1:39:05] dot to eternity.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Now think of that here. Here it was even
[1:39:10] before you know when Jesus says I go
[1:39:14] away.
[1:39:15] We look at it in time. It's been 2,000
[1:39:18] years. or so. But in eternity, it's just
[1:39:22] a little dot. It's it's
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "If we were here 10 million
[1:39:27] years, it still would not be just as it
[1:39:32] was the old saying, where was the man
[1:39:34] when he jumped off the bridge? You could
[1:39:37] not figure it out." Someone say, "Well,
[1:39:40] in the water, but he hadn't jumped yet."
[1:39:44] Someone say, "Well, on the bridge."
[1:39:45] Well, he's still on the bridge. He
[1:39:46] hasn't jumped. See? So there's no
[1:39:48] beginning or end to it. He's trying to
[1:39:52] describe what eternity is.
[1:39:54] See, we we looking at this big old gap.
[1:39:57] We're looking at this big old thing, but
[1:39:58] in eternity, it's just
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; it's just a little old. So, Brother
[1:40:05] Brandham described what it will be like
[1:40:07] over there in eternity. He said, 'I'll
[1:40:11] walk up and I'll say, 'Brother Humes,
[1:40:13] let you and I, brother and brother Beer
[1:40:16] and some of the brethren, we'll go up to
[1:40:17] Papa God and say, "Let's take a journey.
[1:40:21] You boys like mountains." And when you
[1:40:24] was on Earth, yes, we sure did. Oh,
[1:40:26] there's a couple million miles of them
[1:40:29] out yonder in that new world. Go ahead
[1:40:32] out and roam over them. And you know,
[1:40:35] I'm walking out through there, all of us
[1:40:37] walking out there just for about 500
[1:40:41] years. Just a little journey, a million
[1:40:45] don't make any difference. Now, that
[1:40:47] sounds like crazy, he says, but it's the
[1:40:50] truth.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; See, because there's no time, it's
[1:40:54] eternity.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; When I go out there, I walk along down
[1:40:57] through there, and you know who I meet,
[1:40:59] he says, well, I say, well, if it ain't
[1:41:02] Sister Georgie Bruce. Well, Sister
[1:41:04] Georgie, it's been a long time since I
[1:41:06] seen you. Looks like, you know, like
[1:41:09] like she always does. See, she maybe is
[1:41:12] 10 million years old, but just as young
[1:41:14] as she ever was.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; She'd be scratching somebody on the
[1:41:18] back. I look there and it's it's Cheetah
[1:41:20] the lion. How are you this morning,
[1:41:22] Cheetah? See, meow like a kitten. Oh,
[1:41:25] I've been down there talking to some of
[1:41:27] the sisters around them. Big flowers
[1:41:29] down there. We've been there about 500
[1:41:32] years looking around. Now, that sounds
[1:41:33] crazy, but it's the truth. That's the
[1:41:36] way God intended it.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Another place says, "We'll walk up and
[1:41:42] down now, and I'll take a trip with you
[1:41:45] across the mountains for a million
[1:41:46] years. Just a few days, just a few
[1:41:49] minutes." See, we'll go across there,
[1:41:53] sit around over there. When it comes
[1:41:55] time to eat, first thing you know,
[1:41:56] Sister Wood, I say, "Sisterwood, where
[1:41:58] have you been all this time? I haven't
[1:42:00] seen you for seems like it's been 15
[1:42:02] minutes. Oh, that's been 2,000 years
[1:42:04] ago, Brother Brandham. Well, how are you
[1:42:06] feeling? Of course, you can't feel
[1:42:07] nothing but good. See? Hey, come here,
[1:42:10] boys. I'll show you all something,
[1:42:12] brethren. My darling brethren, here's
[1:42:14] the fountain of water, the best you've
[1:42:15] ever drank, and we'll get a good cold
[1:42:18] drink. I'll reach up there, get a big
[1:42:19] bunch of grapes, and we'll all sit down
[1:42:22] there and eat it. See, that's exactly
[1:42:24] what it is. Ain't that right? See? So,
[1:42:28] so there there it's it's an eternity. He
[1:42:31] says no more long nights of praying.
[1:42:34] Just enter that youthful age to young
[1:42:37] joyful age to be there. And and not for
[1:42:41] just a year or 50 years or a million
[1:42:44] years. He says when we've been there a
[1:42:47] hundred billion years, we won't even be
[1:42:49] started at all.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; I believe that he has come back to
[1:43:00] receive us so that we may be with him
[1:43:03] eternally.
[1:43:05] And
[1:43:07] he specifically said who he's coming
[1:43:09] back to. And if you notice, you start
[1:43:11] with John 14th chapter. From the first
[1:43:15] verse, he says, "I go to prepare a
[1:43:17] place. I'll come back and receive you."
[1:43:19] and and all the way down in that same
[1:43:22] chapter from uh 18 to 20, he says, "I'll
[1:43:26] not leave you comfortless. I will come
[1:43:28] to you. Yet a little while the world
[1:43:31] seeth me no more, but you'll see me
[1:43:33] because I live. You shall live also at
[1:43:36] that day." And the prophet said, "This
[1:43:38] day you shall know that I'm in my
[1:43:41] father, you in me, and I in you."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; What is it? God has once again unfolded
[1:43:50] himself into human beings.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He's come to take us with him.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And he's not taking us somewhere a
[1:44:04] million miles away
[1:44:08] as the prophet would tell us.
[1:44:11] He said, "See, it's a place, a condition
[1:44:13] that we move out of this dimension that
[1:44:16] we live into another dimension."
[1:44:20] You think of it when Jesus was on Mount
[1:44:23] Transfiguration.
[1:44:25] The Bible says that Moses and Elijah
[1:44:28] appeared and began to talk with him,
[1:44:31] they had been dead hundreds of years,
[1:44:33] and yet in an instant time, they were
[1:44:36] right there. And they're talking to
[1:44:39] Christ. Ain't that right?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; See, and so brother Brown says, "See,
[1:44:43] we're looking we're looking at some
[1:44:45] mythical something way off out yonder
[1:44:49] 100 million years." Another place he
[1:44:52] says, "I got a revelation the other day
[1:44:54] standing up there on Mount Palomar
[1:44:57] at the observatory seeing the time the
[1:44:59] space over to Mars and to the last
[1:45:02] continents and so forth and light
[1:45:05] traveling at so many thousand miles per
[1:45:08] second." He said if an angel started
[1:45:11] from the furthest star coming here to
[1:45:15] earth, it would take him billions times
[1:45:18] billions times billions of years to get
[1:45:21] here. If he started from Mars and come
[1:45:24] here flying at the speed of light space
[1:45:27] or light speed, it would take him
[1:45:29] billions of years to get here. He said,
[1:45:33] "I cannot believe that there is a house
[1:45:35] way out yonder,
[1:45:37] but I believe that that house that God
[1:45:40] was speaking of is right present here
[1:45:44] now."
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; That that's the place where the mortal
[1:45:49] beings when we cease to be mortal here,
[1:45:52] we step into immortality yonder into a
[1:45:56] place
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; and I believe that's where Jesus is
[1:46:00] today. the resurrected Lord Jesus. Not
[1:46:02] out yonder somewhere a million miles
[1:46:06] away.
[1:46:10] Not not somewhere
[1:46:13] not somewhere a million miles away
[1:46:16] but a a right here present with us now.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Sure.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; In the fourth dimension, people can
[1:46:26] prove that right through this room now
[1:46:29] is coming through radio activity, radio
[1:46:32] messages coming right through this
[1:46:33] building now is coming television
[1:46:35] pictures, but it's too fast for our
[1:46:37] eyes. He said, you go millions of miles
[1:46:40] beyond that dimension and you'll get
[1:46:42] into a place that's just as real as
[1:46:45] television
[1:46:46] pictures is in this room this morning.
[1:46:49] And there's the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:46:52] resurrected son of God, standing here.
[1:46:56] And the reason that you can't see him is
[1:46:58] because our heart hasn't become tuned
[1:47:02] down to it. Now, think of it. Television
[1:47:06] can pick up things that we cannot see.
[1:47:11] Things in this room right now, voices
[1:47:13] and pictures that we cannot see. But yet
[1:47:17] something they have found through
[1:47:19] technology, science can pick it up and
[1:47:22] make it a reality.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; And yet, brother Brandham is saying that
[1:47:26] other world is right here too.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are here.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the place that we're going.
[1:47:36] Amen. It's just in another dimension.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; So it's not millions of miles away.
[1:47:42] Ain't that right? So he says now but
[1:47:45] when our body becomes in tune with God
[1:47:51] picking a part becoming a part of him
[1:47:55] then our soul everybody say our soul
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; soul
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:03] to vindicate the presence of the Lord
[1:48:05] Jesus Christ in all of his power and
[1:48:09] omnipotence that he has risen from the
[1:48:12] dead and he lives among us today. Aren't
[1:48:15] you glad for that?
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; We can't see it. But when we become born
[1:48:21] again,
[1:48:23] that soul of ours can pick it up.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And we can know he's here.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; We know that that other world is real.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; It is real.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Now, the world ain't groaning for it.
[1:48:39] Right?
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; They're living for this life,
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; but there's something in us that is is
[1:48:45] crying out and letting us know there's
[1:48:47] something around here.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; It's becoming in tune with that other
[1:48:52] world.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "The only way you
[1:48:54] can groan for that other world is
[1:48:56] because there's new life that speaks of
[1:48:58] it."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I love him.
[1:49:04] Since the dawn of time,
[1:49:07] men have wondered what life is like
[1:49:10] after death. And there's no way to
[1:49:14] really fully know since we haven't been
[1:49:17] there.
[1:49:19] You take a a baby, and I'll use Zane for
[1:49:24] example,
[1:49:26] since he's fixing to be born.
[1:49:30] You know, you you could take that little
[1:49:32] child, that little baby in the womb of
[1:49:34] mama
[1:49:36] and
[1:49:38] you know, uh, if he had intelligence
[1:49:42] right now, if he could know what's going
[1:49:43] on, if he could think,
[1:49:47] you know, the prophet says, you know, he
[1:49:50] said, if that baby could think, it would
[1:49:52] say, you know what, they tell me that
[1:49:55] I'm fixing to be born.
[1:49:58] They're getting prepared for my coming,
[1:49:59] my arrival. And they're they're they're
[1:50:01] telling me just any time I'm going to be
[1:50:04] born into this world, into a world that
[1:50:07] I know nothing about.
[1:50:09] And if he could think about this, you
[1:50:12] know, I'm I'm used to this. I'm used to
[1:50:14] whatever I'm I've been I I was begotten
[1:50:17] in here. And and I get my energy from
[1:50:20] here. I get my food from here. I I I I'm
[1:50:23] I'm sustaining life in here. I I'm I'm
[1:50:26] being sustained. Yet they tell me that a
[1:50:29] sun is bright out in that world. They
[1:50:32] tell me there's trees and and grass and
[1:50:35] and and and and people that just walk
[1:50:37] around
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; and and a lot of them.
[1:50:43] Then he gets scared to death
[1:50:46] cuz he don't know what that world's
[1:50:48] like.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; He's never been there. Can you say amen?
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; See? And so he says, "What would I do
[1:50:55] out there? What kind of a world is it? I
[1:50:58] know nothing about this place." See, so
[1:51:00] how will I survive out there? And and
[1:51:02] how am I going to eat and breathe and
[1:51:05] and all of these things?
[1:51:09] He's that little baby would be scared to
[1:51:11] death to be born because it's coming
[1:51:13] into a place he knows nothing about.
[1:51:16] Yet
[1:51:17] this place, this world
[1:51:20] is million times million times supreme
[1:51:26] than the world that he's in in that
[1:51:27] mother's womb. Can you say amen?
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; But think of us that have lived, we're
[1:51:35] living in this world.
[1:51:38] We know what it's like
[1:51:41] and we came from that world.
[1:51:44] We We used to be in our mother's womb,
[1:51:47] but we would never want to go back.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; We'd never want to go back into mama's
[1:51:56] womb again.
[1:51:57] You remember when brother Brandham
[1:51:59] crossed the beyond the curtain of time
[1:52:02] as he's looking at all these people and
[1:52:05] talking with them and all these things
[1:52:07] and he's talking with that angel, he
[1:52:08] turns around and asks that angel, "Do I
[1:52:10] have to go back?" Oh my. He was there.
[1:52:14] He could look at his body laying in the
[1:52:16] on in the bed and the body that is he
[1:52:19] was in had had hair. He was young.
[1:52:24] He didn't want to go back.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; And then tried to come back. He had to
[1:52:32] come back, the angel said. And he and
[1:52:35] then he tries to describe what that
[1:52:38] world was like to us.
[1:52:41] He said, "If I tried to speak you of the
[1:52:43] things that would be beyond a human's
[1:52:46] understanding, if I tried to speak of
[1:52:48] those things, I couldn't I still
[1:52:50] couldn't describe the place of the
[1:52:52] blessed and how peaceful. Never to die,
[1:52:54] never to be old, never to be sick,
[1:52:56] always to be young, always to be
[1:52:58] healthy, never to die, eternal life in
[1:53:01] the blessed of youth, no sin or nothing
[1:53:04] else." And yet there's no way to
[1:53:06] describe it. Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Eyes hath not seen, ear hath
[1:53:10] not heard, neither has it entered into
[1:53:13] the heart of man those things that God
[1:53:15] hath prepared for them that love him."
[1:53:17] See, there's no way to explain it.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "We are like that
[1:53:26] baby when we are dying. You're being
[1:53:28] born into a place. You've never been
[1:53:31] there. You can't understand it.
[1:53:35] how great it is and how it's going to be
[1:53:37] out there. The only thing that makes me
[1:53:41] realize or you realize is that little
[1:53:43] touch of life like the spirit may come
[1:53:45] into the baby in its mother's womb. It's
[1:53:48] the only way that we can understand what
[1:53:50] is that great land out yonder when
[1:53:53] there's no sickness, sorrow, no death or
[1:53:55] old age or nothing. Can you say amen?
[1:53:58] And once we get to that place, we'll
[1:54:00] never want to come back. That's exactly
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; into this condition.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; I thought of our loved ones that have
[1:54:09] gone over and they would never want to
[1:54:12] go back. They'd never want to come back
[1:54:14] here. when my, you know, my first wife
[1:54:16] passed away or my wife passed away and
[1:54:19] you know that that was one of the
[1:54:21] hardest things is I I'd listen to
[1:54:22] brother Brandham's testimony and and I
[1:54:25] just constantly listen to that and and
[1:54:29] one of those things that was just the
[1:54:30] hardest thing is to think that she would
[1:54:33] not want to come back to be with me. She
[1:54:36] would not want to come back to be in
[1:54:37] this world and to suffer and all the the
[1:54:41] things and because she had come into a
[1:54:43] world millions and millions and million
[1:54:45] times supreme than what this is.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; I thought of hope. Brother Bram talking
[1:54:53] of hope as she was crossing over into
[1:54:56] that land.
[1:54:58] And he says, "If I live to be a hundred
[1:55:00] years old, I'll never forget what
[1:55:01] happened. She turned over and those big
[1:55:04] great big pretty eyes, they looked at
[1:55:06] me. She smiled and she said, 'Why did
[1:55:09] you call me back, Billy? I said, 'What
[1:55:11] do you mean call you back? She said,
[1:55:13] Bill, you preached about it. You've
[1:55:14] talked about it, but you don't have no
[1:55:16] idea what it is. I said, well, what are
[1:55:19] you talking about? She said, heaven. She
[1:55:21] said, look, I was being escorted home by
[1:55:24] some people, men or women or something.
[1:55:26] They was dressed in white. And she said,
[1:55:27] "I was at ease and peace of big birds
[1:55:31] flying from tree to tree." She was
[1:55:33] describing a world
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; that we have no clue about
[1:55:39] except there's something in our hearts
[1:55:42] that speak of it
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; and let us know that it's real.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; You love him. Amen.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that time.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; What we have seen in this last day
[1:56:10] is a reality of what he has said. He
[1:56:13] made the promise, I go away, but I will
[1:56:17] return.
[1:56:19] and receive you unto myself.
[1:56:24] We can't get involved in life to where
[1:56:26] we lose sight
[1:56:29] of our future.
[1:56:32] We can't get so wrapped up in our
[1:56:34] ministries and our ideas and
[1:56:39] focus on things that we forget
[1:56:42] what it really truly is to be a
[1:56:44] Christian.
[1:56:49] Why are you a Christian in the first
[1:56:50] place?
[1:56:55] Have you ever just thought of that? Not
[1:56:58] to make you a preacher, Brother Amos.
[1:57:00] Not to make you big some great name. We
[1:57:03] shouldn't strive to be some great big
[1:57:05] name. We shouldn't strive to be known.
[1:57:09] We shouldn't strive to be whatever. He
[1:57:11] made you a Christian because he's come
[1:57:14] to prepare you a place. Amen.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He's come back for you.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; We should be the most happiest people on
[1:57:23] the face of the earth
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; knowing we're getting ready to go home.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; And we must not forget because if we're
[1:57:32] looking for things to comfort us,
[1:57:35] they've got dogs that comfort animals,
[1:57:39] comfort foods.
[1:57:42] They got everything to comfort. comfort
[1:57:44] with money, comforted with nice things,
[1:57:48] comforted with retirement plans,
[1:57:51] comforted with everything and not
[1:57:52] knowing they could lose that in a
[1:57:54] heartbeat. Or you could be as rich as
[1:57:57] them billionaires
[1:58:00] and die tomorrow and be totally lost.
[1:58:05] So our comfort isn't in this this world,
[1:58:08] but there is a future.
[1:58:11] And he left us with words to comfort us,
[1:58:16] to let us know there is a life after
[1:58:18] death.
[1:58:21] And you're going to be with me forever.
[1:58:25] And the conditions are going to change.
[1:58:27] Everything's going to change. You
[1:58:28] suffering now, you'll not suffer then.
[1:58:33] You you you crying now, you won't cry
[1:58:36] then.
[1:58:39] I go to prepare a place.
[1:58:42] I'm so glad. Can you say amen? Do you
[1:58:44] love him?
[1:58:46] Going to rise it. Oh, rise.
[1:58:52] Rise above it all.
[1:58:56] Going to spread my wings. Fly away to
[1:59:02] heaven.

[1:59:35] to heaven.
[1:59:38] Rise above it all. Sing it now. Oh, I'm
[1:59:44] going to rise.
[1:59:46] If you know you're going to rise, won't
[1:59:48] you praise the Lord? Get out of your
[1:59:50] sleep. Get out of your stomach and just
[1:59:52] praise him.
[1:59:55] Hallelujah.
[1:59:57] Oh, rise above it all.
[2:00:03] Going to spread my wings, fly away to
[2:00:08] heaven.
[2:00:10] Hallelujah.
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:13] Oh, let that eternal being just began to
[2:00:16] express to God.

[2:00:26] Our worship here is only a reflection.
[2:00:30] [Music]

[2:01:49] to heaven.
[2:01:51] Oh, rise above it all.
[2:01:56] Oh, I'm going to spread my wings, fly
[2:02:02] away to heaven,
