before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord and um I I tell you we need the Lord today more than we ever have and I believe that he's here amen father Lord we bow our heads Lord and in humility father realizing father that we're nothing without you and Lord everything that you have done for us and been to us it's just been by your grace there's nothing that we deserve Lord that it was all in your predestinated plan and father we're so thankful for it Lord and the promises that you've given us Lord we base our whole life upon it and knowing that you're faithful and that you will perform them and I pray Lord that you would first of all touch brother Bob father as he's hurting in his leg father I pray that you would touch your servant father and help him Lord he's been dear to us Lord been faithful and Lord I know he's getting up there in years Lord but father I I just ask that you would touch him and Lord you're more than able to do that father May that leg just uh uh operate normal father May the swelling the fluids just leave we ask it Lord and father we're asking your presence to be with us now and that you would help us Lord help me to yield myself to you to give myself out of the way and Lord use the gift that you placed with within me and I pray that you would anoint your people anoint the hearts to to receive the ears to hear we ask it father we commit this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord Ephesians the the fourth chapter and the fourth verse it says there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given Grace unto uh according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended upon on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto to men amen you can have your seats this morning and um I want to continue on the thought the ministry of God in the body of Christ and um there is one body that represents the Lord Jesus Christ and and that body uh prays for his will to be done yes there's only one body that knows the will of God and only one body that can submit to the will of God and that's the body of Jesus Christ and I uh looked it up and the body is something that embodies or gives concrete reality to a thing amen and I I really like that because that's that's exactly what the body of Christ is it embodies God and gives the reality of God it's the only thing that can there's no denomination religion it's it's the body of Christ that gives concrete reality to him and so within this body God has placed gifts uh for the working of the ministry such as the fful ministry and and I believe that that that is important or God wouldn't have put that in his body and they are God's gift to the body and so brother Braham said you've got to approach God's gifts in the right way and that's with reverence and Ministry is Minister gifts they're gifts in the body five-fold uh five spiritual gifts that's predestinated for ordained of God to the church he said I know there's nine local gifts in the body but these are God's office gifts the office Apostle prophets teach teachers pastors evangelists and we must respect them if we expect something from God and so that is a gift but then we we find that God W has put gifted people within his body and each one of those gifts the prophet said are a Ministry of their own other place he said they they are gifts just like preaching is a gift like healing is a gift like other things are gifts these are gifts they are ministries of their own and each man is commanded to wait on his own Ministry and so I believe that this is what the Bible calls the ministry of the Saints Amen in other words it's it's it's something that we've all are called to do anyone that is in the body of Christ God put you in the body and and you have to remember God is the one that puts us in the body no man can put you in the body it has to be God only the day of Pentecost when he started his church the Bible says the Lord added to the church daily and so it has to be God and and God has to put the gift uh uh no man can lay hands on you to get you a gift uh um uh the only reason why we would lay hands on a a minister uh uh when he's starting to preach or whatever is not because to put the gift there but it's because we recognize that gift we recognize that there is a gift and we want God to use that gift and uh uh there and so uh um uh just I I as you know I I read a lot of quotes because I I want you to know where I'm getting this at but uh Christ sets members in the body the prophet said and he endows them with their Ministries and he puts G the gifts at her disposal amen and so then these nine spiritual gifts are in the body and I believe that they are in operation and they should be in operation because God would put them we know that God put them in the body but but it's never in the word where God took them out of the body and so uh Paul the prophet said set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came ain't that right so then then Ministry Ministry is meant to operate in the body of Christ no matter what it is whether it's the fifo ministry or that we know that there's G helps and governments in the body which are gifts we know as we talked about last Sunday that uh uh Paul had his helpers Aquilla Priscilla Mary and and so on and so forth that were helps to him and to the the the Gentile church and and so they were gifts uh that were put in the body of Christ at that time uh for for that that time and and so is it in this age that that we all have something to do not because necessarily that you're in the local body of the local church but you're in the body of Christ amen in the body of Christ and so but the ministry is is to fulfill the will of God and to carry out God's purpose and plan amen and I I think that's something that we we must uh it must resonate within us is that I am here to fulfill God's purpose and plan that's what I'm here for that's what you are here for and and so then then uh the ministry that God has given us in the body of Christ is not for us to to do with whatever we see fit uh uh and to use them in any way that we want uh but but it's it's it's to fulfill his plan and so then the prophet said you've got to surrender everybody say I've got to surrender you you've got to surrender soul body Spirit strength everything you are to the will of God Amen and and and uh to to become a prisoner to him and and so that's that's the that's what we are called to do amen is not to worry about our gifts per se but yield ourselves and become a prisoner to the will of God Amen and as we said so many times that Jesus taught us to pray amen thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and and so every member that is part of the body of Christ that that is their desire that is their goal is God let your will be done in earth as it is in heaven amen you see we should never pray to change God's mind about things but rather we pray for him to change our mind ain't that right amen our mind and so God's mind doesn't need changing we're not here to tell God what to do and so the prophet would tell us prayer should be Lord change me to fit your word amen not let me change your mind but you change my mind you change my mind to your will and your will is written here in the book and so and Lord don't let me go till You've Got My Mind Set just like your mind and then when my mind is set like your mind then I'll believe every word that you've wrote can you say amen amen and so I I find that that so many people are discontented with who they are and what they have and they're they're just not satisfied and and so and this is where you get so many impersonations and or we we could even call it actors amen is is they're wanting to be something that God never called them to be they're wanting to do something that God's never called them to be and you know the Greek word for Pharisee is actor it's it's a someone that is pretending and and acting and trying to be something that they're not ain't that right and and to me that is a spirit of of the devil and and to to to bring in impersonation and I'll tell you why is because he's the first one that started it he's the one that said I'm going to be like God remember that amen God had created him uh uh to be the the top Angel amen next to God and and and he didn't want that position he was discontent with that and and so he wanted to be like God he wanted to have have a kingdom like God he wanted to be a Creator like God he he wanted to be worshiped like God and and so uh uh he's he he he sets out to be God to act like God to look like God everything is is to be like God he's not content with what God had made him a ain't that right amen and so uh uh then he becomes competitive with God Amen and and instead of rejoicing like like the other angels and and just saying satisfied in his position now he becomes the competitor amen with God ain't that right amen so he's not satisfied with the will of God he wasn't satisfied with the way God created his Eden he wasn't satisfied a man with God uh the way God had his son and and and and and and his his uh daughter and and uh Adam's wife and and these things and he thought he could he he could do better and so then then we can understand that he's the one that has this discontentment amen and and and so then we see that he's he causes men and women amen not to be satisfied with who they are look look where we're at today men ain't satisfied with being a man they want to be a woman woman is not satisfied with god making them the way they are they want to be a man and and and it started with with women cutting their hair then wearing their britches and and and things like that and they were trying to cross over it was a spirit slowly bringing women Crossing them over and then men started having their long hair and and and and acting like a a girl and their bangs remember brother Bram talked about the the the haircuts with the bangs and all that he called them sissies and and all that it was a slow crossover Amen to where we are today that did you realize that that uh uh in the beauty pageant uh my wife was telling me the uh Miss Universe or whatever that they had that a man transgender won that thing over all them women amen and she showed me a picture of of of of the individual that want it that you know and you couldn't tell it was a man at all it it was a you know and and but they won that thing over all the women now you you think of that it's because Satan has put it in the minds because this is his eating you understand what I'm saying so everything is becoming a crossover it's it's so much discontentment so much uh uh uh confusion and dis satisfying and and all of these things well there should be no competition in the church either can you say amen God doesn't want competition in the church and and and we shouldn't put ourselves one against the other I thought of like Paul where he says in 1 Corinthians 12 and 15 if the foot shall say well well because I'm not the hand I am not the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say well because I'm not the eye I'm not the body see or of the body is it therefore not of the body in other words does that change God Amen I know they want us that you know uh if you call a transgender you know a man that has now switched over to try to be a woman I will not call that person a woman you know uh uh I I'll say yes sir yes sir you know and and and they get mad about that you know but it doesn't matter if they if if if they had us all saying yes ma'am yes ma'am she you know all these things and and all that but to God is still a man you you can never change that and that's one uh if God has called you to be something you you can do whatever you want to and switch and and and and do something else but God will never change his mind about what he's called you to be if he called you to be the foot be the foot amen and you stand there trying to be the hand well you can't be the hand in God's eyes it won't work God will never change his mind so he says if the whole body were an eye then where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where would the smelling see but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased us no it didn't say that did it as it as please sea Martin oh God please set me where I want to be please put me in a Hawaii man let me be the Evangelist in the Bahamas oh God please please please please and and he so he says okay Sean you you're you're my bright one you know and so I'm going to place you there but that's not the way it worked he set Shawn Martin in the body as it pleased him and and he set every one of us as it pleased him can you say amen and then he gives us gifts not not to work the way we want to work but as it has pleased him so then our prayer must be father thy will be done ain't that right so now brother Bri says see when you get to a place that you're willing to be nothing that's right then God can make something out of you but as long as you're trying to be big and a lot of Flowery advertising and all this stuff and going on in my opinion something has happened see so we want to become a nobody and he said see God will take something that there's nothing to and make something out of it and it proves that he is God so no matter how insignificant you feel stay that way no matter how of nothing you might seem to be stay that way because then God God can use you and it proves that he's God can you say Amen not that we offer talents not that we offer say God now if you'll just choose me I got a lot to offer here we have nothing to offer and we don't want to bring to God everything that we have we have nothing in his sight if we have anything it's because we built it up in our own mind sir Philippians 2:7 says that Jesus made no of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant what a difference that is between him and and and and Mankind brother brah says the man that made an artificial artificial tooth made a reputation for himself but the one who made the real tooth made of himself no reputation the man that made an artificial arm made a reputation for himself but the man who made the real arm made of himself no reput a see the Way Up Is Down always remember that be humble be sweet and kind be creative and let Christ be in you ain't that right so Jesus Took the lowest job that there was on on Earth and that was washing the feet of the people see but he was there everybody say he was there to do the father's will he could have called Legions of angels to come down to rescue him but he was there to do the father's will a ain't that right amen he he he had come to a point in his life that he was handled by men in any way they wanted to handle him they spit upon him they hit him they bruised him they beat him they done whatever they want to he was in their hands but he was there to do the father's will ain't that right and so there is a will of the father for the supernatural or spiritual body of Christ today a man there is a will of the father for uh a woman as to how she is supposed to act and how she is supposed to dress and the role that she is to play in the home there is the will of the father for a man amen as to how he should act and conduct himself there's the will of the father for every church and for every gift and and and and Ministry within the body of Christ ain't that right and I want to say it this way the church should not compete against the world Amen uh uh God put the church the way they are supposed to be and the world is what they are to be ain't that right and there should not be any competition and this is what even brother brandham talked about how preachers are becoming Hollywood preachers and everything in the church becoming Hollywood and and and and all of these things God did not call us to be entertainers can you say man God didn't call us to be entertainers God called us to be a Powerhouse for his Spirit to come into and deliver people to set people free ain't that right Christian sisters shouldn't try to compete against the women of the world and brothers we should not make our wives feel that they have to compete with these so-called beauty queens in order to get our attention on can you say amen and sisters you shouldn't make your husband feel as though he has to conform to the men of the world for him to be feel like he's a man ain't that right amen see and so so in the Old Testament God's will was for Israel to come out of Egypt and go into the promised land that that was that was the goal uh uh of of of God and so as we know brother brandom told us there's two parts of redemption the first one is the coming out of and second part is going into the coming out was a separation of the believer uh God's Promised Land people separating them from the unbeliever separating their habits and and these things and he was going to deal with Israel now once he gets them separated ain't that right going to take them into their own Promised Land Amen to where they could be a people of of and govern and and all of these things as as a nation and so brother Brown says to be sure that they would not be mixed up in some kind of an ism what did he do he sent them a prophet he sent a prophet to them Moses with a message identifying God's word what was Moses's message to identify God's word and then to identify Moses he sent a pillar of fire that hung over him and you say Amen am and notice and then to give them a perfect Assurance he required a token see and so it's a perfect type of the church today we know that that we have we've been called out can you say amen amen Revelations 18 and4 amen which is is is applies to this age I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not part partakers of her sins and and that you receive not of her plagues well what are we coming out of we're coming out of the world we're coming out of Babylon we're coming out of confusion and and chaos and all the mixup and all of these things God C us out of that Amen to be a separated people can you say amen amen now but our coming our coming has to out has to be scriptural everything the thing that calls us out has to be be scriptural it has to fit in line with scripture can you say amen amen we believe that we're in that Third Exodus and all that so then we could not come out Israel could not come out except God sent them a prophet and we could not come out except God would send us a prophet ain't that right thank God for a prophet in this day amen you can never overemphasize the message of the hour amen because that's the only way that you can come out I don't care if they were smart preacher I don't care how good they could take this Bible and explain it it had to take a prophet to call us out can you say amen and then that Prophet would have to have a message that identified God's word to us amen for the age that we're living in you know I I I wonder why that you we hear uh uh often and and it's becoming seems to becoming more uh uh prominent and and uh uh of ministers you know uh um uh telling us to get back to the Bible and and they they seem to think that we study the message more than we do the Bible and we know more about the message than we do the Bible and and all these things but you know I I personally believe if I study the message then I understand the Bible I I don't think that Moses took the people away from God's word but his message identified the word for their day and I think our prophet in coming bringing us out identified the scriptures in this word for our day and age we've had the Bible for years but we could never understand this Bible there's a lot of pulpits say men standing behind the pulpits preaching this Bible without an understanding of this word amen that God would send us a prophet Amen to separate us from Babylon to separate us from the confusion that we could be identified with the word of God can you say amen amen see so the prophet's message does not take us further away from the word but uh uh uh it identifies the word of God but then to identify the prophet now then God would send a pillar of fire can you say Amen to identify him there's a lot of false prophets in the land there's a lot of prophets people saying that they're prophets and and Men rising up and all that and still to this day they're doing these things and and and I'll be honest can can can they uh can they discern yes they can they you know it's been witnessed that they've done it you know in the Pentecostal Rim uh uh uh there were so-called prophets and things that uh that come to our church and they'd call you out they'd discern you now I'm going to be honest it wasn't all accurate amen but we didn't mind all that you know if he called us out and if it was accurate then he had to be a prophet you know and there was no questions uh you know to to whether you know well he missed that one five times but he got that one right you know uh uh and all these things but but but see we it was it was a mass confusion but but when God would have his picture taken with that man it it was the same to Israel as it is to us can you say amen God identifying him you know as I said the other night God has never had his picture taken with any man outside of brother Brandon amen and you will never find it you you'll never find it and and uh uh he he hasn't had his picture taken with Shawn Martin he hasn't had his picture taken with brother Wayne Lawson he hadn't had his picture taken with brother Barry coffee hadn't had his picture taken with brother Ron Spencer Andrew Spencer brother Tim PR you know brother Ray Ericson brother W Martin brother SE Jonathan Martin hadn't had his picture taken with brother Terry Horn brother Amos you know he's he's not had his picture taken with Brother Joseph brandham he has not had his picture taken with anything like that ain't that right I'm not saying that the pillar of fire ain't with these brothers and and and these things uh uh uh but but I will tell you if you believe the message the pillar fire is with you as well amen I I just believe that but there's only one that he's had his picture taken and and that ain't by accident and and it was taken by God's own enemy that was trying to prove brother Brandon was a fraud and that is healing was a fraud and all of that and remember the that man that stuck his fist be under under FF Bosworth's nose and none of them come out none of them they they all turned out blank except that picture right there amen because God was sending a message to you and I amen and the further we get away from the prophet uh of the years amen it's been what 60 years or so since the prophet's been gone we've had more people rise up and discount this message and act like this message ain't nothing and and and and and trying to tell us don't read the quotes reading the quotes too much and and and pick brother Brandon to aart and this is his opinion and that's his and all of that amen and I thank God that we still have a picture that we can look to and say God did it God backed that man up and if God can back that man up I'm okay with believing what he said can you say amen amen now the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always do you believe that amen see so God had his picture taken with brother Brandon to identify him as being the prophet that he sent amen yes sir if God just wanted his picture taken he could have just had a photographer to take a picture of the of the room and he would make sure he was in that camera amen he could have had his picture taken you know uh uh uh uh 20 ft above brother Brandon's head but he made sure that he was in the picture of that picture right there with brother brandham amen so that he would identify and so therefore God's elect comes out of her out of the the world out of out of Babylon out of all this by this message and you say amen and you know what to see that Pillar of Fire is a comfort to the Believers yes sir the prophet said notice he says he was a comfort to Israel when they could look up and see the pillar of fire and hear the prophet speak the words that was true and God Vindicated that was their comfort Hallelujah so we don't need movies to comfort us we don't need comedians to comfort us we don't need uh uh the seminaries to comfort us we don't need the fancy choirs to comfort us we don't need money to be our comfort that is comfort enough for God's children because we know the the the the trouble is coming we know tribulation is coming we know that we're coming into more of a Sodom and gomorah but we're comforted by one thing we see the pillar of fire amen and we hear the words of a prophet can you say Amen yes sir he says it was a consolation you knew that it was right you was at peace see we at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ and that Pillar of Fire was the consolation can you say Amen now notice so he's bringing us out bringing us out but why why has he brought us out and he's put us into now brother Braham said see he's got one got his Oneness his true Oneness showing himself among them out of every denomination bringing his elect together from all kinds of churches from everywhere bringing out his children falling right in line with his word hallelujah so there's no discontentment God would send a prophet and confirm him with a pillar of fire to be our comfort yes sir amen so we won't be dissatisfied so we won't be discontent we know that he's bringing us together that we could fall right in line with his word which is his will ain't that right notice he's calling his elected together in Oneness with himself with the same kind of ministry he had oh do you love him and he says what has he done he has placed them with a true teacher true prophets who stay with his word the Bible so the prophet never strayed from the word of God right amen ain't that right so now the coming into was the second part of redemption but notice God didn't just bring them into the land and say all right have at it kind of like the Oklahoma Land Rush if you've ever read that you know the the government allotted Parcels of land and they you know drove Stakes down in there so then they had a land run everybody lined up on a certain day and they they they gave the goal and everybody got on their teams of horses and whatever they had walking or or just to riding a horse and they took off and they trying to get the the the piece of property that they wanted well God doesn't bring us into the body and then say okay go for it and we're just a you know bang bang amen I got here first oh no you didn't no and he didn't do that to Israel but he brought them in by a prophet Lord and that Prophet by divine revelation knew where each one belonged ain't that right see he had predestinated each tribe to a place see and the prophet said Ruben meant sheep herder Gad meant cattle raiser Ephraim meant corn raiser so if you switch to up then they'd be totally out of place ain't that right see and so there had to be a prophetic Ministry to positionally place them in the land and the prophet said by spiritual discernment Joshua see amen uh the new leader by spiritual discernment placed each one where he belonged and divided the land just exactly he said the trouble today when we are coming to our Promised Land God wants to raise uh sheep like Ephraim see he wants to raise something like the other and every man wants to be the same see let God give one man a gift of healing and every man wants to a gift of healing Ephraim and Gad all of them see wants to mix all up and come as one but we are divided in our positions can you say Amen so God's Oneness doesn't mean that we're all preachers God's Oneness doesn't mean that we're all singers God's Oneness does not mean that we're all ain't that right see so in our position we're divided that's right he said see all don't have the gift of wisdom all don't prophesy all don't speak in tongues all are not prophets but God has set in the church some that prophesy some that speak with tongues see and we want to make them all speaking in tongues how confusion is that see see he says then you get you can get nowhere why the Philistines would take them over in a little bit but when each Man by a by a leader see separated them by spiritual discernment and placed them into the body where they remained and become the cream of the earth God give us a Joshua he says God give us back a Joshua that'll hold the commission with the word aren't you glad we've had our Joshua yes sir see so Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over and Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua so how many calebs do we have hallelujah amen there there's some calebs that are going to stay with this message yes sir now every every member in the body is important Prophet said many times we Overlook the the value of little things and he say sometimes a minister that's got just a little group of people back in some Mission he feels like maybe well I I can't be a Billy Graham or an or Robert so I'm not very much in the picture but notice what he says but he doesn't realize that he's just as important right as Billy grandar Roberts if everybody say if he's in the will of God doing his place when a person is in the will of God doing his place he's just as important amen see another place he says God has made you a place can you say that with me God has made me a place aren't you glad for that God knew you coming in the body so he predestinated you a place he made you a place Lord don't try to take somebody else's place that's carnal impersonations and that shows that there's something wrong with you amen see when we realize our position in Christ then abide in that if it's just a little housewife stay right there right there that's what God wants you to do just be what you are don't don't complain God help us not to complain amen no matter how hard the task may be if God's put you there stay there and don't complain am yes sir don't complain to be a housewife don't complain that you have to get out and go work for your your husbands don't complain about your children yeah that's right everybody's complaining it seem like they're unhappy that's right unhappy preachers unhappy people unhappy musicians unhappy everybody just unhappy unhappy husbands unhappy fathers unhappy mothers and then they feel like they deserve something we've all got our reward coming just stay in your position amen amen can you say amen amen you might say well I don't know what God wants me to do then the best answer I could get to you is stay in his presence then get your nose out television get your nose out of the comics get your nose off YouTube Facebook and WhatsApp and wherever else I don't know all them things just say get your nose out of social media get in the presence of God get your mind off of everything else quit entertaining all this other stuff get into the presence of God can you say Amen the prophet said God Moses knew more about the will of God for his life in five minutes in the presence of God than he did a 40 years of training right and what the church needs tonight is not some fantastic not some new denomination but to be be alone with God ain't that right young people be alone with God get alone with God that's right parents get along with God preachers get along with God every one of us get along with God all selfishness all malice all fear all unbelief just Fades away and God becomes preeminent that's now if you notice it's it's not having gifts that counts and it's not being anointed that counts but it's being in the body that counts because a man can have a gift and be anointed and yet not be in the body of Christ true that's true and when he isn't in the body of Christ and he isn't under the headship of Christ that's I said you know last Sunday that a a gift can be used by the carnal mind which is is dangerous when it's used by a carnal mind because it's a carnal nature amen amen and the carnal mind is not subject this is what Paul said in Romans is the carnal mind is not subject to the law or word of God and neither indeed can be so he can hold an office in the church he can he can be used in the church in in whatever and be Anointed with it that if he's not a part of the body and he's operating it by a carnal mind he will never become subject to the will of God the word of God Amen ain't that right see so therefore the colel man uses the gift to edify himself to point people to himself look what a job I'm doing look what I'm I'm capable of hello it's me amen right that's right brother BR said you know a man can prophesy and it comes out true you know and if he's not carefully he go well see I'm the one that prophesied that oh my I say that very humbly oh brother prach but what happen he tries to establish his own name before the people right see so the individual may be anointed but not anointed to the word amen and that's that's what the prophet said that that that people are being anointed but they're not anointed to the word so it's coming to a time where now notice what he says this is important it's coming to A time where impersonations and carnal thinking is going to be circumcised from the real true Body of Christ right praise the carnal minds and the impersonators are going to be cut away from the body of Christ talking about a separation it's going on can you say amen and he's going to have a body that's pure everybody say pure holy and filled with his spirit with his walking in his spirit and doing the works that he did be faithful to that amen ain't that right that's what he said be faithful to that another place he says listen to your gifts and keep them in the Bible don't take a substitute when the skies are full of the real ones let's keep the real ones let's keep the real or don't have any at all amen can you say Amen see to the to the to the the bride of Christ in this day it doesn't matter what kind of gift a man has that's not too impressive as I've said before we're not in the Pentecostal age where we were all gullible right and vulnerable yeah if a man claimed to be a prophet man you talking about we just gushed all over him if a man had a certain gift we just gushed all over him if a man could preach he could preach the house down we just gushed all over him I mean it was just come on bro and we were so vulnerable yeah right you could walk in no there ain't no telling how many people of ministers came in our day and split CH our church cuz people dissatisfied with the pastor so you get a new face a new ministry a new whatever hum Danger yeah sweet talking and this and that understanding the gripes of the people and this and this and that and every after him and before you know it he's starting a church some down the road people were vulnerable but Believers aren't vulnerable we keep the gifts in the word can you say Amen where's this thing going to lead us that's right amen where's it going to take us Yello sir amen so let's keep the real or don't have any at all now this body of Christ I hope this is okay this morning but the body of Christ has a head as we know and the prophet says the head guides the body take your head off and see how far you go come on well you go somewhere in the unknown but your body sure won't cooperate amen so it's the intelligence that controls every movement of the body there isn't a preacher outside or inside this message that's the head of the body on do you know that yes sir amen that's right and as much as I love brother brandom and believe that he was a word Prophet he's not the head of the body right brother Joseph brandham ain't the head of the body John Martin ain't the head of the body we could go preacher after preacher after preacher in the message outside the message they're not the head of the body amen and you say amen that's right Colossians 1:18 Christ he is the head of the body the church amen ain't that right who is the beginning and the firstborn from the dead and that in all things everybody say in all things he might have the preeminence that in all things he might have the preeminence he wants preeminence over the fivefold ministry he wants preeminence over the church he wants preeminence over the musicians he wants preeminence over the deacons he wants preeminence over for whatever Ministry he's given you he's the head of the body and he wants the preeminence and when does he get preeminence when he falls upon your spirit nope when he gets into your soul amen then he's able to control every part of you that's right hallelu so Christ is the head of the church and as the Prophet would tell us over and over he is the word so then the word is our headship and the word comes to AET Prophet Amen brother Brandon made mistakes one thing I loved about him is he was very transparent amen and willing to confess them right that's right but that doesn't mean that this message is wrong hello amen people want to pick flaws in the message then they they pick him apart pick him apart all you want to but you can't pick the message apart the message is real the message is our headship God didn't vindicate that man in all of his faults and failures that's not why God done that he had a message to bring that's right can you say Amen so as they say that you know that brings idolatry when you have that picture no it doesn't it does not bring idolatry to us not a Believer it sets us right brother brandham is just a man he's not our Lord Jesus Christ amen so Christ being the head has the preeminence over all the gifts that he has placed in within the body he has the preeminence over all branches of ministry that operates within his body he has the preeminence over all the members right in his body so now notice we're not to come together to talk about the message we are uh uh come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word can you say Amen see and so I believe that that the True Believer in the message is more connected with the word and this Bible than anyone else in the world is true message Believers is because the word came to a profit amen amen so then every gift and every Ministry in the body of Christ is disciplined everybody say disciplined every Ministry Ministry every gift is disciplined every operation of these gifts and Ministry is disciplined because now we have our headship discipline to the word remember discipline means to show restraint controlled temperent ain't that right see so now notice what the prophet said about the Pentecostal people he says the gifts and callings are in the church but the people don't know how to control themselves that's right yes they don't know how to take hold of God another place the gifts are in the church but the po little children get those gifts and they don't have the teaching to know how to control it if you'd mcontrol it see you'll do more damage than you will good amen about it another place what the church needs tonight is to know how to control these gifts for evil spirits can come in and speak just the same as good spirits can speak you know that see he says now and you must have the spirit of discernment to know that that they had it in the Bible time see and if they didn't do it see why if they didn't do a then why Paul says let uh why did Paul say Let One judge and the people judge and so forth see see those gifts of Prophecy everything is supposed to be correctly put in order for Satan can intim imitate every gift that God's got every gift he can in imitate it and you must know the right and wrong and by their fruits you know it see watch whether it comes to pass and whether it's truth or not and that's the way you know the spirit yes see so we are now under a headship are you with me now so then every gift every Minister comes under the headship how do we discern the gift how do we discern discern the ministry you don't discern the man you discern the spirit the prophet said remember go listen to discernment of spirit discern his motives discern his intentions what is he trying to do with that gift amen well then how do we judge there is a message that's right that has brought us back to the word praise the Lord is this all right he said I think we need to what we need is to get ourselves in control and just quit scattering and jumping and respect the gifts of God and things and put them in their places like that and let the Holy Spirit operate the church and then them other people will go to hungering and thirring for it see now see so you've got the extremes youve got those that do not believe in gifts at all they don't believe in no an on they don't believe in nothing so they're just intellectual in their Church in their speeches draws the intellectual crowds then you've got those that are Fanatics they've gone into fanaticism with everything hello but as as we've taught that that brother Brandon was a balanced man this message is balanced the way of Holiness the the the way of Holiness is a balanced way amen he said see but as long he said but as long as you let it run loose see and this one this way and that one that one and no control they just think it's babbling they talk better than that in the Bible see it's not the gifts that they've got against it's the way you Loosely use them you know the prophet said a man can send his soul to hell with a Divine gift ain't that right that's another place he says this he said if God has really given something and give it to your charge now we're going to wind it down but he says if God has given you something and put it into your charge I want you to listen now every Minister every Deacon every trustee every singer whatever you are whatever gift you've got listen if he's given you this and he's put it in your charge you've got to use that with the wisdom of God Amen can you say Amen brother Brown talks you know about adoption and we know that we're in adoption this is the adoption age and he talks about it in in many places of the obedient son versus the disobedient we know that the father could not put any confidence in the son that was disobedient so then therefore that son would never fall heir to any of the possession that the father had because the father couldn't trust him yet he remained a son but if the son was obedient then the father could trust him then the father would set he a certain day aside and would then adopt him publicly right amen he would place a robe on him and have a ceremony and what is adoption we we would apply that adoption today is taking someone outside the family and bringing him to our family making him part of our family and that's not true not not as far as biblical adoption adoption in the Bible is that a son was always the son but it it depended on whether he was worthy for the business the father might have had a business a farm or or whatever and he wanted to hand that over to his son and so he'd take take that son and put him under a tutor and that tutor the father could trust that tutor and and they they were intimate friends and and these things and and and so the the tutor knew exactly what the father wanted what his character was how he controlled his business how he done it all and he would try to relay this to the son he would try to teach him he would try to build the character of the father in the son he would try to put the knowledge of the father in the sun he would try to do it all to where that when that sun got ready amen then the sun could take over the bus business but then the tutor would would come back and Report occasionally to the father well the father said well how's he doing now how's he doing cuz he wants to hear that good report right well I I don't know what to do with this guy you know I I hate tell you you know uh Jim I you know Billy Bobby just I I try to give him some lessons and he just totally does it Opposite constantly like brother Brandon would say it this way tutor come to him and said well I gave him a flat tire you know when they getting ready to go to church they got outside and there was a flat tire and they you know they just went back inside and sat down or he'd say he'd come to them and say you know what I I caused them to have a flat tire and you know what they done they they went and called somebody else to get a ride for church really wow pretty good yeah you know what I'm saying see God allows things to happen to just see where we're at amen he allows situations ain't that right so now notice see God wants to put us in a position of authority that when you say you're not just sitting there rambling your words ain't that right that's right that's right so he said see if we can only get quietened down away from our differences and become a one great United body God God would Place those gifts exactly where they belong then you'd see Miracles done signs and wonders done these gifts like speaking with tongues how we misuse that see just fly loose any time did you realize that that's wrong can you say that with me that's wrong certainly is but put it in its place and let it be used exactly the way God intended it to be used it'll bring down the power and blessings of God but out of place it'll CA confusion just like healing healing is a great thing but if it's placed and used in in wrongly and it's placed in the wrong position misused then the prophet said it becomes a reproach and all gifts are all other gifts are the same see if everything was operating perfect in harmony with God this Pentecostal group would be one great big Pentecostal Church of the Living God see that's right but the way we misuse it see the gifts are here so God would call us out of that babyon we're not part of that Pentecostal Babylon we are now under a headship sir the Pentecostals consider speaking in tongues to be a great thing oh yeah but that's the last and least of the gifts every True Believer believes in them but as the prophet taught us the first gift is wisdom the second gift is knowledge and he said what good is it going to do to have knowledge if you haven't got wisdom to know how to take care of your knowledge that's right what good does it do to speak with tongues if you haven't got the wisdom to know when and how to place it the same with healing or with any of the other gifts can you say Amen see so so then then you you know Paul Paul would talk about it and how that Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and in Prudence when did that happen in this messag I I believe that when the seals were open there came a wisdom to the church amen a discernment within the church hello every one of us in the message and in the body should have discernment Amen to the youngest to the oldest uh uh if you're placed in the body of Christ and we all know by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and if we're placed in that body then now we're under a headship and that headship is our intelligence that operates the body then we have this wisdom because the wisdom is coming from the headship right you say amen amen that's right and so then you know with all of the confusion that has happened in in in the Pentecostal and brother brandham he held the ministers responsible he held the ministers responsible for bringing such confusion he says because they are so confused with their organizations and I have to be honest the confusion has drifted over within the message ranks and and the reason why is because men will not let go of their organizational teachings and they want to bring this into the message and mix it with the message you cannot cannot you can't do it you got to come out of her my people come out of her my people the headship is not organization you love the Lord am amen I got a lot more but if the musicians will come we have been positionally placed in the body of Christ under one headship amen it is the only body that is subject to the word proving that it is a word body we are a word body so if a man has been baptized by one spirit in into one body of Jesus Christ then he will be disciplined to the word of God can you say amen Amen brother Braham said you can sit in the same church Shout by the same gospel but if your nature isn't tempered you'll never be recognized as a genuine son it's got to be tempered amen can you amen do you love the Lord hallu praise God there's a meaning and a real purpose for being in the body of Christ God putting us there it changes the nature changes changes who we are changes our way second Corinthians 5:17 If any man be in Christ he is a new creature Creation The Prophet would tell us creation old things are passed away and behold all things are become new ain't that right amen Romans 6 and3 know ye not that so many of us us as were're baptized in Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of [Music] life one place says brother Braham says I'm I'm going to have you know I'm going to have to cut just a little bit here you know get the Briars out of the way but he said men and women that won't follow God's word and his teaching after they claim to be born again there's something wrong say that again men and women that won't follow God's word and his teaching after they claim to be born again there's something wrong can you say amen amen why because we cannot be in disagreement with the word and fulfill the will of God at the same time can you say Amen oh do you love the Lord God just didn't give us gifts we made it to where we would be pliable to him his leadership here John 1613 it says how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all all truth can you say Amen all truth I love the Lord amen what
