[42:48] how we love you with all our heart.
[42:52] And what a joy to know that we are yours
[42:56] and to be privileged to be counted among
[43:00] the redeemed. Yes. Purchase possession
[43:05] by the blood of the lamb.
[43:08] We are so grateful.
[43:10] We say blessed be thy holy name. Thou is
[43:14] rich in mercy and have paid us all and
[43:17] have wrought this great work of
[43:19] salvation upon our life.
[43:22] And once again by your grace you have
[43:26] brought us for a fellowship with you
[43:27] under your shed blood
[43:30] to feasting in those things that are
[43:33] revealed to us in these last days.
[43:37] For you said in your word,
[43:40] the secret things belongs unto the Lord,
[43:44] but those things that are revealed
[43:46] belongs unto the children.
[43:49] We are yours.
[43:51] And we come with our heart humbly bow
[43:55] with earless expectation to hear from
[43:57] you. May you come take control
[44:01] for I cannot do without you.
[44:04] I'm trusting on your unmmeritable grace
[44:08] to come, oh God, mount this pulpit and
[44:12] minister to your people that tonight
[44:16] once again
[44:17] we will all be blessed and your people
[44:20] will hear from their
[44:24] Let it be for I'm going out of the way
[44:28] decreasing for we must decrease for you
[44:31] to increase. Have mercy upon our
[44:35] unbelief
[44:36] and once again, oh God, increase our
[44:39] faith
[44:41] by the power of the Holy Ghost as we
[44:44] stand upon your word of promises
[44:48] unfailing. Father, we take authority
[44:51] over every spirit
[44:54] of hell that doesn't work for your good,
[44:59] doesn't work for your purpose of our
[45:01] gathering tonight.
[45:03] We bring their manipulation
[45:06] and forces to captivity under our
[45:09] control. Father, we push out every
[45:12] presence of hell
[45:15] in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:18] that the Holy Ghost take control
[45:22] fill every soul, body and spirit just
[45:25] like it was in the house of Colinius.
[45:29] So let it be Lord while your word will
[45:32] be coming out. Let the Holy Ghost fill
[45:35] this place. Bless us like never before.
[45:39] We wait on you in Jesus name we pray.
[45:44] Amen.
[45:47] Hallelujah.
[45:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You love the
[45:52] Lord. Let's give a clap offering to the
[45:54] Lord Jesus Christ.
[45:58] God bless you or richly. You may be
[46:00] seated.
[46:02] It's nice to be in the house of God.
[46:06] Amen.
[46:08] and a great privilege to be in the midst
[46:10] of the bride in this part of the world.
[46:13] Hallelujah. The prophet said
[46:18] the greatest thing
[46:21] privilege that God will give to his
[46:23] servant his servant
[46:26] is to speak to the bride. Amen. So I
[46:30] count it a privilege to be here this
[46:32] night and I want to appreciate brother
[46:36] Shan
[46:37] who have given me this great privilege
[46:39] to speak to the bride of the lord
[46:42] me I'm not good in expressing and
[46:45] explaining myself but I just want to say
[46:48] God bless you brother Sean and I bring
[46:51] greetings from my church back at home
[46:54] and my little family.
[46:57] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And
[46:59] without wasting our time because time is
[47:01] always our enemy, let's quickly go to
[47:03] the scripture reading.
[47:06] Hallelujah.
[47:08] You love the Lord. Let's give a clap
[47:10] offering to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:13] The Lord is good.
[47:16] The Lord is good.
[47:18] All the time is good. We bless the holy
[47:22] name of our savior. So we are going to
[47:26] read from
[47:29] kind of a lengthy scripture.
[47:32] Ephesians chapter 2 1-13.
[47:39] Ephesians 2 1-13.
[47:45] Let's be on our feet
[47:48] as we respect in honor of the reason of
[47:51] the word of God.
[47:57] The word of God is our national anthem.
[48:02] We pledge allegiance to it. Yes. And
[48:06] when you are singing
[48:08] the national anthem, you must have
[48:10] respect and regard for your country and
[48:12] you be on your feet. And that's why we
[48:15] always be on our feet in respect.
[48:18] So Ephesians chapter 2 from verse 1 to13
[48:27] I'm not a English good English
[48:29] speakaking man because I'm not though
[48:33] I'm born in English country I'm not born
[48:35] in English man so we all learn English
[48:40] so I want you to be patient with me and
[48:44] uh pray with me uh I'm not going to say
[48:47] something different. We are going to
[48:48] speak the same language
[48:51] even if my English expression is not
[48:53] good but because of the revelation of
[48:57] where we come from I think we
[48:59] understand.
[49:01] So be in the spirit and I think God will
[49:04] help us tonight. Hallelujah.
[49:07] In the book of Ephesians chapter one
[49:13] I will need tissue.
[49:16] We need a tissue.
[49:18] Okay. Sorry.
[49:22] Thank you. God bless you, sir.
[49:25] We need it.
[49:30] Ephesians chapter one. Ephesians chapter
[49:32] 2 rather from verse 1 to3.
[49:37] And you had he quickened
[49:40] who were dead in trespass and sin.
[49:45] wherein in time past ye walk according
[49:50] to the curse of this world, according to
[49:54] the prince
[49:57] of the power of the head,
[50:00] the spirit that now workth in the
[50:04] children of disobedience,
[50:08] among whom also
[50:10] we all had our conversation
[50:14] in time us in the lust of our flesh,
[50:18] fulfilling the desire of the flesh
[50:22] and of the mind. And we by nature the
[50:27] children of wrath,
[50:29] even as others,
[50:33] but God
[50:34] who is rich in mercy,
[50:39] for his great love where he love. Amen.
[50:43] Amen. I love that.
[50:46] Even when we were dead in sin,
[50:50] had he quickened us together with
[50:52] Christ,
[50:54] by grace ye are safe.
[50:57] Can you say amen to that?
[51:00] And had raising us up together
[51:03] and made us sit together in heavenly
[51:06] places in Christ Jesus. Amen. What a
[51:08] place. Hallelujah.
[51:12] Thank you, Lord.
[51:15] What a privileged position. Amen. What a
[51:18] position full of authority. Amen. Sure.
[51:22] What a a position
[51:27] that cannot be questioned. That's right.
[51:30] Thank you, Jesus.
[51:32] May God help us.
[51:35] Hallelujah.
[51:36] Amen.
[51:39] and had raisen us up together.
[51:43] Verse six, and made us sit together in
[51:45] heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[51:48] that in the age to come he might show
[51:52] the exceeding riches of his grace in the
[51:57] kindness toward us
[52:01] through Christ Jesus.
[52:04] Amen. Amen. For by grace are ye saved
[52:07] through faith,
[52:10] and that not of yourself.
[52:13] It is the gift of God. Hallelujah.
[52:18] Not of work, lest any man should boast.
[52:23] For we are his workmanship. Yes.
[52:27] Hallelujah.
[52:29] Created in Christ Jesus unto good works.
[52:33] Yes. a different species
[52:36] that the Bible called a peculiar people.
[52:40] Hallelujah.
[52:42] A holy priesthood.
[52:44] Yeah. A special species. Amen. We are
[52:50] different kinds. We are a
[52:53] specially made
[52:56] built for a special purpose.
[53:00] All right. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's
[53:03] continue to read on.
[53:08] Where are we? It's like a jump a little
[53:10] bit.
[53:12] Verse 10. Okay. For we are his
[53:16] workmanship,
[53:18] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[53:22] which God had before ordained that we
[53:25] should work in them.
[53:28] Wherefore
[53:31] remember that ye were
[53:35] I'm sorry I come again. Wherefore
[53:38] remember that ye being in temperass
[53:42] Gentiles in the flesh. You see that?
[53:46] Who are called uncircumcised by that
[53:50] that which is called the circumcision in
[53:53] the flesh made by hands. That's right.
[53:57] that at the time
[54:00] at that time we were without Christ.
[54:04] Amen.
[54:05] Being alien from the commonwealth of
[54:08] Israel
[54:10] and stranger from the covenant of the
[54:12] promise
[54:15] has no hope having no hope and without
[54:19] God in this world. What a place
[54:23] horrible.
[54:25] But now
[54:28] in Christ Jesus,
[54:31] ye who sometime were far off, that's
[54:35] right, are made near by the blood of
[54:38] Christ. Amen.
[54:40] May God have mercy
[54:43] and bless the reading of his word in
[54:45] Jesus name. You may be seated for a
[54:48] while.
[54:52] Hallelujah.
[54:54] Amen. Amen.
[55:00] I love that.
[55:02] I want to talk about something simple,
[55:06] something that we are used to and common
[55:11] among
[55:12] Christian and believers. Amen.
[55:16] I want to talk about church. The church.
[55:21] Amen.
[55:27] Now the church
[55:31] in the Greek word
[55:35] it means
[55:37] ecclesia. Amen.
[55:41] Ecclesia.
[55:43] Yes. Okay. and Ecclesia
[55:47] we spell E K
[55:50] L E S I A right
[55:55] I'm not good in writing in the B so I
[55:57] don't want to so you follow me and God
[56:00] will help us to understand Hallelujah
[56:03] and in the spelling we have we have e
[56:07] that ek means
[56:10] in the Greek word art of
[56:14] or
[56:16] out from
[56:19] and the rest of the spelling
[56:22] which come by the word calio it means to
[56:26] call
[56:28] or to summon.
[56:31] Hallelujah.
[56:33] So the invisible church
[56:37] means
[56:40] the called out
[56:43] once. Hallelujah. And we when we go into
[56:47] the dictionary
[56:49] to express it better,
[56:54] the word Ecclesiast,
[56:57] the dictionary said is often translated
[57:00] as church
[57:03] in English. Is that right?
[57:07] primarily means assembly or a gathering.
[57:13] Now that is in the natural. So he's
[57:17] going to he's also going to explain it
[57:19] deep in the spiritual.
[57:21] Hallelujah. All right.
[57:24] In classical Greek,
[57:27] it referred to a political assembly of
[57:32] citizens
[57:34] called out for a public deliberation.
[57:40] Amen. Amen.
[57:44] A political assemblies
[57:47] of citizen of a nation of a kingdom.
[57:52] Hallelujah. Yes.
[57:54] Called out, selected, chosen
[57:58] for public deliberation.
[58:02] A public assembly.
[58:06] Hallelujah.
[58:08] A public example. Rather I said
[58:10] assembly. Sorry to say that.
[58:13] A public example.
[58:18] In the natural part,
[58:21] we are made called to be a public
[58:24] example
[58:26] because the scripture said we are
[58:29] strangers and prim.
[58:32] We are not of this world.
[58:36] We are from God going back to God. Yes.
[58:41] So our journey in life is returning.
[58:45] Yeah.
[58:46] Hallelujah.
[58:48] Praise the Lord.
[58:50] Hallelujah.
[58:52] So we are made called to be a public
[58:56] example
[58:58] because Jesus said we are strangers and
[59:01] pilgrim. Yes.
[59:04] And he was praying for the bride.
[59:07] He said, "Father, I would not that you
[59:10] take them from this world because I call
[59:14] them, I choose them and ordain them for
[59:17] a certain purpose in this world."
[59:20] So don't take them out because they have
[59:23] to declare and fulfill and manifest the
[59:27] purpose why I have ordained them for it.
[59:30] [Music]
[59:31] And it's going to be a public showdown.
[59:35] Therefore, he said
[59:38] you are a light that is placed on the
[59:41] mountain.
[59:43] Right? The light placed on the mountain
[59:47] is not for it's not a secret issues.
[59:52] It is a public.
[59:56] Hallelujah.
[59:59] You are a light placed on the mountain
[1:00:03] to give light to the world.
[1:00:08] So looking at this
[1:00:12] definition
[1:00:16] he said
[1:00:19] a political assembly of citizen
[1:00:23] called out for a public deliberation.
[1:00:27] Yes.
[1:00:29] Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] So the life of the cordat
[1:00:34] the the bride is a public showdown.
[1:00:38] Therefore Jesus said you are the light
[1:00:41] of the world.
[1:00:43] Let your life so shine.
[1:00:46] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:00:50] Praise the Lord. That men will see. Is
[1:00:53] that public?
[1:00:56] Praise the Lord. Yes, sir. That they
[1:00:59] will glorify your father.
[1:01:02] So, the message of the hour is not a is
[1:01:07] not a a a a a a believer's affair.
[1:01:12] No,
[1:01:14] it's not a member of the church.
[1:01:19] Hallelujah.
[1:01:21] The message of the hour. The prophet
[1:01:24] said,
[1:01:26] "We doesn't come together to talk about
[1:01:28] the message." Right. But we come
[1:01:31] together to live the message. Amen.
[1:01:35] Right. It's a light that must shine
[1:01:38] forth.
[1:01:40] And it must not be only when we are in
[1:01:42] church.
[1:01:43] That's right.
[1:01:45] Amen. And we can dress well, appear
[1:01:47] well,
[1:01:50] talk like a Christian. Oh, pastor. Oh,
[1:01:52] this. Oh, God bless your soul. No.
[1:01:57] It is something that must be in the
[1:02:01] public declaration.
[1:02:03] [Music]
[1:02:04] Come on now. Hallelujah.
[1:02:08] It is something because Jesus said a
[1:02:12] light is not made to be kept under the
[1:02:16] bush.
[1:02:19] That's right. It is made to give light
[1:02:21] to the public.
[1:02:26] So you are the light. That's right. As
[1:02:29] the Bible said, we are the perfect work
[1:02:31] of God made manifest.
[1:02:35] manifest to give light to this world.
[1:02:39] Therefore, the prophet said
[1:02:41] the bride
[1:02:43] is the solution
[1:02:46] to this world. Amen.
[1:02:50] We had the solution. Sure. Amen. We have
[1:02:53] the answer
[1:02:56] because
[1:02:59] the capstone intelligent has come. Amen.
[1:03:03] The capstone ministry have come
[1:03:06] to cap our mind, our intelligence.
[1:03:10] That's right. With the great intelligent
[1:03:12] of the omnipotent one. Amen. Amen. So we
[1:03:18] have what it takes to determine what is
[1:03:22] good for this world and what is not
[1:03:25] good.
[1:03:27] When science produce and manufacture,
[1:03:30] we can look at it and we can determine
[1:03:34] we can tell it
[1:03:36] whether it will be good or it won't be
[1:03:38] good.
[1:03:40] Amen. So we are not people who are
[1:03:43] carried about the fashions and the
[1:03:45] things that is made in the world. Right?
[1:03:48] We are the people who are ordained to
[1:03:51] examine hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:54] what is right and what is supposed to be
[1:03:56] accepted and what is not.
[1:04:04] That is what it takes to be a bride.
[1:04:10] And that is what
[1:04:12] the definition is expressing
[1:04:15] a public deliberation
[1:04:19] in the septuagent.
[1:04:22] The Greek translation of the Hebrew
[1:04:25] Bible,
[1:04:28] it translated
[1:04:30] the Hebrew word meaning assembly or
[1:04:34] congregation.
[1:04:35] Yeah.
[1:04:37] Now in the New Testament,
[1:04:41] Ecclesiast
[1:04:42] is used to describe
[1:04:46] both a local and a universal gathering.
[1:04:51] Yeah. both the local church and the
[1:04:54] universal body of the Lord. All right.
[1:04:56] Hallelujah.
[1:05:00] A uni a local and universal
[1:05:08] believers in Christ.
[1:05:12] Now that signifies
[1:05:15] a body
[1:05:17] of people.
[1:05:20] Amen. Amen.
[1:05:23] Called out by God.
[1:05:26] Amen. To be in relationship.
[1:05:30] That's right. With him. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:36] Amen. Yes. And only him
[1:05:41] and one another.
[1:05:44] Yes. Because your proof to be in him.
[1:05:47] Amen. have to be your love for one
[1:05:49] another.
[1:05:53] So even
[1:05:56] the English dictionary express it up to
[1:05:59] that
[1:06:02] to prove that you are in Christ. You
[1:06:05] have to be your attitude towards one
[1:06:07] another.
[1:06:08] You have to be your love towards one
[1:06:10] another.
[1:06:13] May God help us. Amen. May God help us.
[1:06:20] And that bring us to
[1:06:25] 2 Corinthians
[1:06:27] chapter 5:E1 17.
[1:06:31] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:33] 2 Corinthians 5:17 says,
[1:06:37] "Therefore
[1:06:39] is
[1:06:41] therefore if any man be in Christ,
[1:06:45] he is a new creation."
[1:06:48] Yes. Old things have passed away.
[1:06:52] Behold, all things are become new.
[1:06:56] Yes.
[1:06:59] Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] our old nature,
[1:07:05] our old life,
[1:07:09] our old thinking
[1:07:11] and our old tradition. Yes.
[1:07:15] Come on now. Preach.
[1:07:18] When you are a church of the living God,
[1:07:20] it means you are called out of that.
[1:07:24] Amen. To a new creation.
[1:07:27] That's right. to become a new creation.
[1:07:32] Therefore, Paul said in the book of
[1:07:34] Romans chapter 6,
[1:07:37] can we continue in sin
[1:07:40] in an unbelieving attitude
[1:07:43] that the grace of our rebirth will
[1:07:46] remain. Amen. And fulfill it cost in our
[1:07:50] life is a question he throws to the
[1:07:53] believer. Say, can we continue in it?
[1:07:57] Because there is a grace given to us to
[1:08:01] fulfill the purpose of our calling.
[1:08:04] Therefore, Paul said, "Walk out your
[1:08:06] salvation."
[1:08:08] But it's not by your might or by your
[1:08:11] power or by man's ability or human
[1:08:14] ability as the prophet said, "But by my
[1:08:17] spirit, says the Lord." Amen. That's the
[1:08:21] grace. That's the anointing. That's the
[1:08:24] power. Amen. And Paul is asking us, can
[1:08:28] we go otherwise
[1:08:30] in sin and that grace will back us and
[1:08:33] accomplish God purpose? Say no sir.
[1:08:38] Say no.
[1:08:41] Because there is a evidence of your call
[1:08:43] that you are called.
[1:08:47] You must prove
[1:08:50] that you are saved. Yes. To be saved is
[1:08:54] not a secret thing.
[1:08:56] It is not what you tell people.
[1:08:59] That's why the prophet said, "Don't
[1:09:01] leave me the gospel. Don't don't speak
[1:09:03] preach me the gospel. Leave me the
[1:09:06] gospel." Amen.
[1:09:10] And Paul went further. He said, "How can
[1:09:13] we that are baptized into Christ and
[1:09:18] live any longer there in in the past?"
[1:09:23] You was once dead in sin and trespasses.
[1:09:27] The scripture say, "Had he quickened,
[1:09:30] praise the Lord. From the dead works,
[1:09:34] that's right, dead of this world."
[1:09:37] Filthiness
[1:09:38] of this world. Yeah. corruptions,
[1:09:42] defiling,
[1:09:48] of this world. Paul said, "How can you
[1:09:51] live any longer therein?"
[1:09:55] He said, "We are supposed to know
[1:09:57] better."
[1:09:59] Therefore, he went further to say,
[1:10:02] "Know you not
[1:10:04] that in as much of those that are
[1:10:07] baptized in Jesus name,
[1:10:10] have baptized into his death. Yes.
[1:10:14] Meaning we are dead to our old
[1:10:17] conscience.
[1:10:19] We are dead. That's right. To our old
[1:10:21] man.
[1:10:23] We are dead to this body.
[1:10:27] Therefore, brother Brown said, "My
[1:10:29] biggest problem
[1:10:31] is brother."
[1:10:34] Yeah. He said how can we
[1:10:37] don't you know that in as much of us
[1:10:40] that are baptized
[1:10:43] into Jesus name not those we are not
[1:10:45] talking about father God the father god
[1:10:47] the son go the holy ghost no those
[1:10:49] people they are not in this category I'm
[1:10:51] talking about I'm talking about the
[1:10:53] category that Paul
[1:10:55] is declaring here in as much of us are
[1:10:59] baptized
[1:11:01] in Jesus name we are bapt We are we are
[1:11:05] we are buried with him by baptism. Yes.
[1:11:09] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Death to the old works and we are
[1:11:14] raising up with him. Amen. Like as if he
[1:11:18] like as is he was raising up by the
[1:11:21] glory the power of the father. So also
[1:11:25] we we are coming in his likeness.
[1:11:29] Oh hallelujah. Amen. Raise it up to walk
[1:11:33] in newness of life.
[1:11:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:38] That's what is ordained to our part.
[1:11:43] Amen.
[1:11:47] Call out
[1:11:49] to declare
[1:11:51] Christ. Amen. Call out to show that
[1:11:56] Jesus is alive. That's right. Cut out.
[1:11:59] Amen. to declare that Christ is the only
[1:12:02] solution. Call out.
[1:12:06] Amen.
[1:12:07] To wave
[1:12:10] the name of Jesus
[1:12:13] as a banner over the sick. Amen. Over
[1:12:17] the afflicted. That's right. Can you say
[1:12:20] amen? Amen. to wave the name of Jesus
[1:12:26] as a banner
[1:12:28] over the situation of the people. Yes.
[1:12:31] Over the sickness, over the situation,
[1:12:35] declaring that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:12:39] yesterday, today, and forever. That's
[1:12:40] right. For he was bruised for our
[1:12:43] iniquity. Yes, sir. His chastisement of
[1:12:47] our beast was upon him and with his
[1:12:50] stripe we are healed. Take the name of
[1:12:54] Jesus shine of sorrow and of war. Wave
[1:12:58] it over your situation. Glory as a
[1:13:01] banner of grace as a banner of victory
[1:13:04] as a banner of solution as a banner of
[1:13:07] result to every situation you find
[1:13:10] yourself. Thank you Jesus. Amen. May God
[1:13:13] help us.
[1:13:14] Amen. May God help us. Give us this
[1:13:18] courage to this course we are ordained
[1:13:21] to. Amen. In this last day, he light.
[1:13:25] Yes.
[1:13:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. And
[1:13:32] therefore again
[1:13:34] the book of Romans chapter 1 verse 8
[1:13:36] verse1 said
[1:13:41] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:13:45] to them which are in Christ.
[1:13:47] Amen. Yes sir. Can you say amen to that?
[1:13:51] Amen. Who what
[1:13:55] you see I always love the expression of
[1:13:58] the scripture. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go
[1:14:00] ahead. tells you that's God talking.
[1:14:03] Amen. And that shows that God knows
[1:14:05] every heart of every man. So he place it
[1:14:08] in a sentence that you will read between
[1:14:12] the line and know what he's talking
[1:14:14] about. Yes sir. Yes sir. There is
[1:14:17] therefore no condemnation
[1:14:20] to them that are in Christ Jesus. He
[1:14:23] didn't end up there. He say who walk not
[1:14:26] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:14:30] So there are those
[1:14:33] that are in Christ Jesus that are still
[1:14:36] working after the flesh. That's right.
[1:14:40] That will be working after the flesh.
[1:14:44] Praise. And there will be a particular
[1:14:46] species
[1:14:48] specially built, ordained for his
[1:14:51] purpose that we walk in the spirit.
[1:14:56] Amen. And the brother said, "Did you see
[1:15:00] and read that scripture very well? Open
[1:15:03] your eyes."
[1:15:05] Yeah. He said
[1:15:07] those that are in Christ. That's right.
[1:15:10] Not those that believe Christ.
[1:15:16] When you believe, you must go further.
[1:15:20] Right?
[1:15:22] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:15:25] you believe? Not before you believe.
[1:15:27] That's right.
[1:15:29] No, you have to go further.
[1:15:34] To believe is not sufficient.
[1:15:38] You must go further.
[1:15:42] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:15:45] Praise the Lord,
[1:15:48] brother. We have arrived.
[1:15:52] We have been called out. And how did we
[1:15:55] know? Because we have the revelation
[1:15:59] of the messenger to the bride. Yes.
[1:16:04] To call them out. So we knew that this
[1:16:09] is a calling out
[1:16:12] in the message the invisible union of
[1:16:14] the bride of the Lord Jesus. Yeah.
[1:16:19] The prophet said
[1:16:23] with confidence
[1:16:25] and boldness
[1:16:27] paragraph 336, yes sir, preach 1965
[1:16:33] in the 11th month in the 26th day. He
[1:16:37] said,
[1:16:39] "And in the invisible union of the
[1:16:41] church
[1:16:45] by the the bride to Christ."
[1:16:49] Amen. Amen. Are you catching it now?
[1:16:52] Yes. The revelation. Yes. We caught the
[1:16:56] revelation. That messenger is here now.
[1:17:01] Can you say amen?
[1:17:04] Amen. We got the revelation
[1:17:08] of the last prophet message
[1:17:11] and we know who we are. Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:18] Your original life has come back to his
[1:17:20] original position. That's right. It's
[1:17:22] time.
[1:17:24] Yes, sir.
[1:17:26] We call the revelation.
[1:17:29] He said,
[1:17:30] "The messenger
[1:17:32] to that bride is here." Amen.
[1:17:36] Hallelujah. I love that. Then we know
[1:17:41] who we are. Amen. We believe it. Yes.
[1:17:44] Amen. And we know it's true. Amen.
[1:17:50] Not only because he said it, but our
[1:17:54] life.
[1:17:57] Hallelujah. Amen. Prove that it is true.
[1:18:01] Amen. Jesus said,
[1:18:04] if you cannot believe me
[1:18:07] what I'm saying,
[1:18:10] believe the works thereof.
[1:18:12] The faith without works is fight. If
[1:18:16] they cannot believe the message, let
[1:18:19] your life testify. Praise the Lord. Let
[1:18:22] your life prove them to be wrong.
[1:18:25] Don't let your words, your profession
[1:18:27] prove them wrong. Let your life prove
[1:18:29] them wrong.
[1:18:35] Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] So the messenger is here to the bride
[1:18:43] which is Jesus Christ.
[1:18:45] The same yesterday,
[1:18:48] today, and forever more. Can you say
[1:18:51] amen? Amen. Amen. Now is now he only
[1:18:56] speak through his prophet
[1:19:02] the Bible says. So
[1:19:04] he never does anything but first he make
[1:19:07] it known to his prophets. That's right.
[1:19:10] Amos 3:7.
[1:19:13] He always has done it.
[1:19:18] He never change his pattern.
[1:19:22] See,
[1:19:23] and the prophet can only speak if he
[1:19:28] true what God tell him. Amen. Is that
[1:19:32] right?
[1:19:34] That's true. Yes.
[1:19:38] We had a revelation and we know we have
[1:19:41] been cut out. Amen. From our tradition,
[1:19:46] from our unbelief.
[1:19:48] Yes. Amen. from our own thinking that we
[1:19:51] may live a life not to lean on our own
[1:19:55] understanding.
[1:19:58] We have been corrected from our own
[1:20:00] understanding.
[1:20:01] Cried from our own thought to the
[1:20:04] thought and understanding of God that we
[1:20:07] walk in the power of this glory.
[1:20:13] May God help us. Yes. Hallelujah. We
[1:20:17] have been cut out from life unto death.
[1:20:20] Right? That's what Roman 8 told us.
[1:20:27] Now is therefore no condemnation to them
[1:20:29] that are in what? Christ
[1:20:32] being out
[1:20:35] from death into life.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:41] Now
[1:20:43] secondly,
[1:20:45] we have been called out
[1:20:48] from darkness into light. Praise the
[1:20:51] Lord. Yeah. So you can see and know how
[1:20:57] powerful you are.
[1:21:00] You have been called from darkness into
[1:21:03] light. That's right. Amen. Did you see
[1:21:06] that?
[1:21:10] The Bible said
[1:21:12] in the beginning was the word, right?
[1:21:15] And the word was with God
[1:21:18] and the word was God.
[1:21:20] Right?
[1:21:22] The same was in the beginning.
[1:21:27] This is that light
[1:21:32] that light upon a man
[1:21:36] and giveth light. Amen. Amen. Yeah. He
[1:21:39] is the light of the world. That's right.
[1:21:42] And this is that light,
[1:21:44] that light upon man that give him life.
[1:21:49] Amen. Now the whole show and conclusion
[1:21:52] is here.
[1:21:55] Where we don't have to take any we don't
[1:21:58] have to conceive any defeat.
[1:22:02] There is no cause to conceive defeat in
[1:22:04] life.
[1:22:05] We are made and bound for victory
[1:22:08] because we are born to overcome.
[1:22:11] He said this is that light and he is the
[1:22:15] light. And he being the light is that
[1:22:19] light that light upon men and give them
[1:22:23] life. And he follow up by saying this
[1:22:27] light shine upon the darkness and the
[1:22:31] darkness cannot comprehend it, cannot
[1:22:35] hold it back. So you are the light. Can
[1:22:39] you say amen?
[1:22:42] The call out
[1:22:45] is the light.
[1:22:48] Shines upon the darkness. Praise the
[1:22:50] Lord. So we don't wonder why the world
[1:22:52] is going deep in this darkness.
[1:22:56] We know it's a it's a ground. It's a
[1:22:59] space. It's an atmosphere that is
[1:23:01] creating for us to shine. Hallelujah.
[1:23:05] Because if there is no situation of the
[1:23:08] world today in this condition,
[1:23:11] there is no way your light can shine.
[1:23:14] That's right. Light is not recognized
[1:23:17] where there is light.
[1:23:23] May God help us.
[1:23:27] May God help us.
[1:23:29] The first Peter 2 9 and 11
[1:23:34] made it clear for us
[1:23:37] a better understanding.
[1:23:40] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[1:23:44] But yeah are a chosen generation.
[1:23:48] Can you say amen to that?
[1:23:52] Chosen generation,
[1:23:54] a royal priesthood,
[1:23:57] a unholy nation.
[1:24:00] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] An holy nation,
[1:24:06] a peculiar people.
[1:24:11] A special species.
[1:24:14] specially built for a special purpose. I
[1:24:18] like that. When you see yourself to be
[1:24:21] that
[1:24:23] is not to tell people this is what you
[1:24:25] are,
[1:24:26] you must walk like that. You must live
[1:24:30] like that. The prophet said if you
[1:24:33] praying trusting God to be a
[1:24:36] millionaire,
[1:24:37] you must from that minute when you rise
[1:24:40] up from your prayer, you start living as
[1:24:43] a millionaire.
[1:24:46] Talking like a millionaire. That's
[1:24:49] right. That's right. And you become a
[1:24:51] millionaire. That's good, brother. Don't
[1:24:53] fear.
[1:24:55] God is able to subdue your body,
[1:24:59] subdue your situation to obey your
[1:25:02] confession as you live by your
[1:25:05] confession. May God help us. The prophet
[1:25:08] said you neither you pray or you are
[1:25:11] prayed for being sick,
[1:25:14] rise up with faith.
[1:25:16] Oh, this place is still paining and it's
[1:25:18] swelling up. Forget about it. Continue
[1:25:21] to live as you are as that you are
[1:25:24] healed. Continue to talk like as if you
[1:25:26] are healed. Continue to declare your
[1:25:28] healing. I am healed. No hell can hold
[1:25:31] it back. Amen. Because the Bible said
[1:25:34] upon this rock. I build my church and
[1:25:38] the gates of hell can never prevail
[1:25:41] against cannot prevail. Can you say
[1:25:43] amen? Hold your procession. Keep it
[1:25:46] going. Declaring what you know is true.
[1:25:50] And hell cannot stop you in this life.
[1:25:52] Amen. Yes sir. Whether you are dying
[1:25:55] that has nothing to do with it. I used
[1:25:57] to tell my son sometime when I'm going
[1:26:00] on mission I things that I know
[1:26:04] that I've not made known to him. I start
[1:26:07] telling him everything because I know
[1:26:09] where I'm going. I don't know whether
[1:26:11] I'm coming back. But though that was
[1:26:13] ringing in my mind but it still doesn't
[1:26:15] stop me.
[1:26:17] There is something you have to do for
[1:26:20] your Lord. If it takes you are going to
[1:26:22] die, go through because David said,
[1:26:25] "Though I walk through the valley and
[1:26:28] the shadow of death." So David know that
[1:26:32] the ground is walking out. It's
[1:26:34] dangerous. No man goes and come back.
[1:26:37] It's not a surviving journey. But he
[1:26:39] said he feared no evil. Meaning he knew
[1:26:42] the evil on the way.
[1:26:46] But he have this confidence that is
[1:26:49] ordained for a special purpose to work a
[1:26:53] purpose for God. So he said I fear no
[1:26:57] evil because the God who saved my life
[1:27:01] the God who called me out he promised to
[1:27:04] be with me. Amen. He promised to be me.
[1:27:08] He promised to go with me. He promised
[1:27:11] to carry me. As the prophet said, Christ
[1:27:14] through every life situation and bring
[1:27:16] me safe to the shore. Yes. So David have
[1:27:20] that confidence and he took up a
[1:27:22] challenge against death, against evil
[1:27:26] against every enemy and he go come back
[1:27:29] victorious. And the prophet said David
[1:27:32] is the great warrior. The only man on
[1:27:34] earth that won lose no battle.
[1:27:37] Hallelujah. because he have so much
[1:27:40] confidence
[1:27:42] in whom he believe. Hallelujah to God.
[1:27:45] Paul said, "I know who I believe and I
[1:27:49] am persuaded." Amen. That he is able.
[1:27:53] That's right. Can you stand up and say
[1:27:55] that tonight? No matter the face of the
[1:27:58] enemy, the situation that is before you,
[1:28:02] can you rise up and take your stand and
[1:28:04] challenge the situation? I know who I
[1:28:07] believe. I challenge the sickness. I
[1:28:09] know you believe. I challenge the
[1:28:11] problem. I know where I believe. And I'm
[1:28:13] persuaded
[1:28:15] that is able to keep everything.
[1:28:19] I trust unto his hand. Man of courage,
[1:28:24] man of confidence,
[1:28:26] man of victory. David said, "I fear no
[1:28:30] evil." What is David telling you? David
[1:28:33] is telling you, I am too much anointed
[1:28:37] to be disappointed. Hallelujah.
[1:28:40] I am so much anointed. Too much anointed
[1:28:43] to be disappointed. And when you are
[1:28:45] born of the spirit of God, I tell you
[1:28:47] brother, you are too much anointed to be
[1:28:50] disappointed.
[1:28:52] Amen. You are too much anointed. The
[1:28:55] anointing in you is so much that
[1:28:57] conceive no defeat. So you are so much
[1:29:00] anointed to be disappointed in life.
[1:29:05] That was what David was telling us. I am
[1:29:08] too much anointed to be disappointed.
[1:29:11] And the prophet bring us to to that same
[1:29:14] picture. He said when you are born again
[1:29:18] and adopted sons of God said when you
[1:29:22] are born again filled with the Holy
[1:29:24] Ghost
[1:29:26] you are filled.
[1:29:28] You are equipped with everything
[1:29:32] amination you need. That's right. To
[1:29:34] make to succeed this life. Yes sir. Yes
[1:29:37] sir. What is it? Baptism of the Holy
[1:29:40] Ghost
[1:29:42] to be sons and daughter is too much
[1:29:45] anointing
[1:29:46] to be disappointed.
[1:29:50] We count every disappointment to be a
[1:29:52] blessing. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:29:55] Because Paul when he was anointed, he
[1:29:58] was too much anointed to be disappointed
[1:30:02] in with tribulation. Therefore, Paul
[1:30:04] said, "I glory in tribulation."
[1:30:07] What is it? Too much anointed to be
[1:30:11] disappointed.
[1:30:13] We are too much anointed to be
[1:30:15] disappointed. We don't take no conceive.
[1:30:18] No matter what you said about us, it's
[1:30:19] not our business. You say, "Oh, brother
[1:30:21] Jeff is this and that." That's not my
[1:30:23] business because you are not my focus.
[1:30:25] Hallelujah. We are not an eagle that
[1:30:29] listen to the cry of the schooler. Are
[1:30:32] you with me now?
[1:30:35] What did the prophet said? The ego
[1:30:37] didn't mind. He doesn't even care
[1:30:39] whether there is a school because his
[1:30:41] focus is not the school. Amen. Just pay
[1:30:44] deaf ear to it and focus on his purpose
[1:30:49] because he know who he is. Kura cannot
[1:30:52] change his thought. He was ready and the
[1:30:54] prophet was seeing the boldness and the
[1:30:56] confidence. He don't even care about his
[1:30:58] career and he rise up his rifle and say
[1:31:01] you're looking I can shoot you.
[1:31:04] The eagle didn't even check himself. He
[1:31:06] said you are ready to attack. I'm going
[1:31:09] to tell you something. The prophet said
[1:31:11] he flop his wing said check out these
[1:31:14] two wings. Do you know what it is? Look
[1:31:17] at it very well.
[1:31:19] No matter what you want to do, I don't
[1:31:22] care about it. What I know, I have this
[1:31:25] tool
[1:31:27] before you cut. I'm out of the danger.
[1:31:31] Hallelujah. Why the ego knows so much
[1:31:35] who is and the prophet said there is
[1:31:37] something about position in life.
[1:31:43] Did you hear that very well? There is
[1:31:46] something about position in life.
[1:31:49] And the prophet said in the message of
[1:31:51] adoption, he said when we say
[1:31:54] positionally placed in the body of
[1:31:56] Christ,
[1:31:58] we are talking about adoption.
[1:32:01] Amen. And when we say adoption,
[1:32:05] then we are talking about redemption.
[1:32:09] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:11] You love the Lord. Give a clap offering
[1:32:14] to the Lord. I love I love that. Clap
[1:32:16] for Jesus.
[1:32:18] There is a honor, there is a blessing,
[1:32:21] there is joy in heaven in clapping for
[1:32:24] Jesus because Jesus want you to heal
[1:32:27] him.
[1:32:29] When he rose up and Mary came to him,
[1:32:32] what did he said? Oh, hail me.
[1:32:37] You see that?
[1:32:40] That's why we sing praises to heal him.
[1:32:44] Clap for him. You're singing. You are
[1:32:47] clapping your hands. I come here and do
[1:32:49] like as if you are some big shot and you
[1:32:51] are too mature to clap your hands. You
[1:32:52] are not ready to become a Christian. Cuz
[1:32:54] when you go back to the heaven, you'll
[1:32:56] be frustrated and you run and leave the
[1:32:58] heaven. You tell God, I'm tired of this
[1:33:00] place.
[1:33:02] Come on. Hallelujah.
[1:33:04] Cling downs jump
[1:33:08] the worldly people in their worldly
[1:33:10] music that make no sense. That is why
[1:33:13] the the musicians sing. He said he said
[1:33:16] he said he said he said I got he said I
[1:33:20] got I I got joy in what it runs off my
[1:33:24] mind now.
[1:33:27] He said uh crisis my firm foundation
[1:33:33] the rock that we must stand everything
[1:33:37] around me broke shaking or breaking.
[1:33:41] Hallelujah. And he went forth and
[1:33:44] saying,
[1:33:46] he said, I I I have got joy that made no
[1:33:49] sense.
[1:33:52] Yeah, I got it. He said, I got joy that
[1:33:55] makes no sense. Because the kind of joy
[1:33:57] they have in the world, jumping and
[1:34:00] running and dancing for foolishness,
[1:34:02] nakedness,
[1:34:04] is a joy that makes no sense.
[1:34:09] Even the musician sang such a song that
[1:34:13] the joy they have in the world makes no
[1:34:16] sense.
[1:34:19] Therefore, Jesus said, "My joy, my
[1:34:22] peace, a gift to you, everlasting." Not
[1:34:25] like the one men give to you that makes
[1:34:27] no sense, right? But the one that
[1:34:30] remain,
[1:34:33] no man can take it. In other words, no
[1:34:35] situation can rub it for you.
[1:34:39] Amen. You say what are you talking
[1:34:41] about? Let's go to book of Romans
[1:34:42] chapter 8. I never go there. Let's just
[1:34:44] see if time is not on our side. I was
[1:34:46] try quickly wrap up but I find a way.
[1:34:49] Let's go to Roman.
[1:34:51] Okay. Should I do that here or I should
[1:34:54] do it here. Okay, let me do it here.
[1:34:56] Roman chapter 8 from verse 30 something.
[1:35:02] They have joy that make no sense.
[1:35:04] Temporal
[1:35:06] after they jump and run and wind their
[1:35:08] buttons and all kind of things rock and
[1:35:10] roll and they come back frustrated. What
[1:35:13] can they do again? They are ready to
[1:35:14] commit suicides. Oh, if they cannot
[1:35:16] commit suicide, I need something to save
[1:35:17] me from su what I need something to save
[1:35:19] me from suicide. They look for drugs.
[1:35:22] Take joy, pleasure, comfort themsel with
[1:35:25] drugs and that comfort killing them.
[1:35:29] That's right.
[1:35:30] What is it? Joy that makes no sense.
[1:35:34] That's what he got in the world. And you
[1:35:36] believe will sit in your in your own
[1:35:38] house in your TV or in your screen and
[1:35:40] and you seeing the way they are they are
[1:35:43] displaying their joy and they are
[1:35:45] recognized. They clapping hands. Oh, I
[1:35:47] want to be a celebrity. You are a fool.
[1:35:50] You don't know what is wise. You don't
[1:35:53] know what is wisdom. You don't know what
[1:35:54] is good.
[1:35:57] You are just a believer but you are not
[1:35:59] in Christ.
[1:36:03] Yeah. When you take pleasure with the
[1:36:06] word, don't forget the Bible say, "Love
[1:36:07] not the word and the things that are
[1:36:09] there in. For if any man love the world
[1:36:11] and the things thereof, the love of the
[1:36:14] father is not in."
[1:36:16] That's right. Amen.
[1:36:19] Hallelujah.
[1:36:21] and they become your model.
[1:36:25] Where in this world that a believer take
[1:36:29] a worldly celebrity and holy champion to
[1:36:33] be his mother?
[1:36:36] No. Can we continue in saying that the
[1:36:39] grace of God may abide? No. Paul say
[1:36:42] it's not possible. Amen. Because two
[1:36:45] cannot work together except they agree.
[1:36:47] That's right. When you are a Christian,
[1:36:49] you must be a Christian. When you want
[1:36:51] to be in the world, gain the whole
[1:36:53] world. Don't just put one leg here and
[1:36:56] in the evening you put another leg here.
[1:36:58] When you put one leg here on Sunday, you
[1:37:00] put your leg in the church. No, you are
[1:37:02] fooling yourself. You can't fool God.
[1:37:05] Amen. You are making a big mockery of
[1:37:08] yourself. We must repent. Amen. come to
[1:37:12] the reality of our calling and stand
[1:37:16] there because there is something the
[1:37:19] prophet said about position in life.
[1:37:23] Amen.
[1:37:25] What things separate us for this love?
[1:37:27] We didn't read a Roman again. Let's read
[1:37:29] it.
[1:37:34] Romans chapter 8.
[1:37:36] My sight is becoming so so I have to go
[1:37:39] back before I see. That's why I prefer
[1:37:41] use using the the screen and make it
[1:37:43] big. So, but it will help me here.
[1:37:47] Romans chapter 8
[1:37:49] verse 30
[1:38:00] from verse 30.
[1:38:03] Is it okay? Let's start from the prison
[1:38:06] so that we know where from verse 30.
[1:38:08] Moreover, whom he did predestinated,
[1:38:12] them he also called. Is that right? So,
[1:38:15] we are now back to the picture. Is that
[1:38:17] right? And them and whom he called, them
[1:38:21] he also justified. And who and whom he
[1:38:25] justified, them he also what? Glorify.
[1:38:30] 30 31 What shall we say to these things?
[1:38:36] If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:38:42] Exactly. They will never burn that
[1:38:44] devil. That will rise up and bring a
[1:38:46] believer to disappointment. No, because
[1:38:49] believer know every disappointment is a
[1:38:51] blessing.
[1:38:53] Can you say amen? That devil will never
[1:38:56] be born. I used to tell my church back
[1:38:58] at home, I said the devil that will
[1:39:00] bring me to my feet and make me regret
[1:39:02] of believing the message, he will never
[1:39:05] be born.
[1:39:07] I say he will never be born. So he's not
[1:39:09] even existing. So meaning I will never.
[1:39:12] You say are you trying to say you are a
[1:39:13] superman? I'm not a superman. The man
[1:39:16] who called me, he gave the promise. Yes.
[1:39:19] Hallelujah. He said I will never
[1:39:23] allow you or let you be tempted above
[1:39:25] that which you cannot bear. So the devil
[1:39:28] will rise up that temptation that I
[1:39:30] cannot bear to make me for will never
[1:39:32] exist
[1:39:34] because that word will never fail. He
[1:39:36] will surely stand his course behind them
[1:39:39] that are ready to walk with your faith.
[1:39:43] We read we are closing. We are closing.
[1:39:45] Time is not on our side. I know you
[1:39:47] Americans. Oh we pray for you people.
[1:39:49] You guys every day because all of our
[1:39:52] work bills and everything. So sometime
[1:39:54] we cry. We are there. We are just
[1:39:55] crying. Oh, our brothers in America,
[1:39:57] help them.
[1:39:59] Praise the Lord. Because me back, I told
[1:40:02] you in my church, every day we are in
[1:40:04] church service. Do you believe that?
[1:40:06] Every day we are in church service.
[1:40:09] As I'm not there, church service is also
[1:40:11] they just came from church. Tomorrow
[1:40:12] they back there. Next tomorrow, they're
[1:40:14] back there. Sunday, they're back there.
[1:40:18] So, we have plenty of time. We don't
[1:40:19] want to take chances with our time. We
[1:40:21] want to make good use of it for the
[1:40:23] Lord.
[1:40:25] Because the life situation there is is
[1:40:27] terrible. If you don't use your time
[1:40:29] properly for God, you regret. There is a
[1:40:32] saying that they used to say those that
[1:40:33] are praying for it's not easy for them
[1:40:35] to make it not to talk about those who
[1:40:37] are not praying.
[1:40:39] Did you understand that parable? I don't
[1:40:41] know whether you get it. There's a
[1:40:43] parable that used to say those that are
[1:40:45] praying and those that they are praying
[1:40:47] for it's not easy for them to make it
[1:40:50] not to talk about those that are not
[1:40:51] praying.
[1:40:53] Yes. So we don't make we try to make
[1:40:56] good use of our time. If God give it to
[1:40:58] us, it's not for us to be sleeping
[1:40:59] around. Unless we wake up, we will not
[1:41:00] have nothing to eat. Hallelujah. Must
[1:41:03] pray the heaven down because pray give
[1:41:06] us our daily bread. You must pray heaven
[1:41:08] to bring it because it's there in heaven
[1:41:11] for you. May God help us.
[1:41:14] Where where are we now? We'll be closing
[1:41:16] soon just from just give me 10 minutes
[1:41:18] and we round up. Hallelujah. So where
[1:41:21] are we reading verse what?
[1:41:24] Hallelujah. Verse.
[1:41:28] Okay.
[1:41:30] Verse 32.
[1:41:32] What shall we say to these things? If
[1:41:35] God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:41:38] For he that spare not his own son, but
[1:41:42] deliver him up for us all. How shall he
[1:41:46] not with him also freely give us all
[1:41:50] things? Praise the Lord. Who shall lay
[1:41:54] anything to the church of the elect of
[1:41:58] God, the color, the predestinated? Who
[1:42:01] on earth even in heaven who will do it?
[1:42:05] Is there is no way nowhere for such
[1:42:08] person? It's not existing.
[1:42:12] Hallelujah. It is God that justify us.
[1:42:16] Yes. Amen. So that settle the case
[1:42:18] because it's God that justify us. No man
[1:42:21] can lay charge against this.
[1:42:24] Amen.
[1:42:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:28] It is God that
[1:42:32] I'm mixing the thing.
[1:42:35] Is God that
[1:42:38] Okay. Justifiers have seen it again.
[1:42:41] Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] Who is he 34 that condemnth?
[1:42:51] It is Christ. That's the only man can do
[1:42:54] that.
[1:42:56] That Hallelujah. It is Christ that die
[1:43:00] for us. Yeah. Rather that is raising
[1:43:03] again
[1:43:06] who is even at the right hand of God.
[1:43:10] And the prophet said right hand
[1:43:11] authority. who also make intercession
[1:43:15] for me and you the bride and the call
[1:43:19] both local and universally.
[1:43:22] Amen. That's the man that make
[1:43:23] intercession for them
[1:43:26] because he know what is in the mind of
[1:43:29] the spirit. So therefore he make
[1:43:31] intercession for us. Amen.
[1:43:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:38] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:43:43] Christ? Amen. Shall tribulation
[1:43:47] or distress or persecution or famine or
[1:43:51] nakedness or per
[1:43:55] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:43:59] killed all day long. So in all this
[1:44:01] thing we fear nothing.
[1:44:04] Fear not that can kill your flesh.
[1:44:09] But fear him who can kill both your
[1:44:11] flesh and soul in hell. So we fear them
[1:44:15] not because the worst they can do is on
[1:44:18] our flesh.
[1:44:20] May God help us. Hallelujah. As it is
[1:44:23] written, for I said we are killed all
[1:44:26] day long, we are counted as sheep for
[1:44:30] slaughter.
[1:44:31] Nay in all these things we are what?
[1:44:36] more than conqueror through him that
[1:44:39] loveth. For I am persuaded that neither
[1:44:45] death nor life, nor angel, nor
[1:44:49] principalities, nor powers, nor anything
[1:44:53] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:44:57] nor depth, nor any other creation
[1:45:02] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:45:06] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:45:11] Lord. Amen. Praise God. So what can pull
[1:45:14] us?
[1:45:15] They never born it. You will never
[1:45:18] exist.
[1:45:20] If God allow anything to come to you, he
[1:45:23] knew what he kept in you before he
[1:45:26] allowed. He knew you have what it takes
[1:45:29] to overcome it. That is why he lied like
[1:45:32] Job. So we don't fear no evil. And no
[1:45:35] situation can take us from this great
[1:45:39] love.
[1:45:41] But God, we have anchored our soul.
[1:45:45] We have anchored our soul in the heaven
[1:45:47] of rest. That's right. And we say thou
[1:45:50] see no more. Have anchored my soul in
[1:45:54] the heaven of rest. I say th I see no
[1:45:59] more.
[1:46:01] The tempest may sweep over my the life's
[1:46:05] stomach gate. In Jesus, I'm anchored in
[1:46:10] Jesus. I'm save.
[1:46:13] Oh, hallelujah. In Jesus, we are safe.
[1:46:17] Nothing can move us. Nothing can shake
[1:46:20] us. We are ordained for it. It's not our
[1:46:23] making. It's not our willing. But it is
[1:46:25] our father own good pleasure to give us.
[1:46:29] Amen. And the Bible said we have
[1:46:30] received a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:46:34] You are unshakable. You are unstoppable.
[1:46:37] The church of the living God are made to
[1:46:40] accomplish God purpose. And the gates of
[1:46:43] hell cannot prevail against them because
[1:46:45] the purpose of God can never be
[1:46:48] defeated.
[1:46:50] So you can never be defeated. That's
[1:46:53] what the prophet said. We have received
[1:46:55] a kingdom
[1:46:58] because we are called out from the
[1:47:00] satanic kingdom unto the kingdom of God.
[1:47:03] And we close as we read as we come close
[1:47:05] to this place. We are called out from
[1:47:09] this satanic kingdom that Satan has
[1:47:11] dominated because when he took Jesus and
[1:47:14] he show up for the temptation. He told
[1:47:18] Jesus, he take him to the high mountain.
[1:47:20] He say look at the whole beauty. Look at
[1:47:22] the whole grammar. Look at all the whole
[1:47:24] blessings that you you you cannot even
[1:47:27] count. All is for me. If you bow down
[1:47:30] and worship me, I give you all.
[1:47:34] We have been saved.
[1:47:37] once dead in sin and trespasses.
[1:47:40] God in his great mercy by grace we are
[1:47:44] saved through faith in his promise. His
[1:47:47] word revealed to us and be quicken
[1:47:50] together with Christ who conceive no
[1:47:52] defeat.
[1:47:54] Heavenly places there we sit right at
[1:47:56] his feet. And the Bible say above every
[1:47:59] principalities
[1:48:01] empower. as we close above every
[1:48:04] principalities
[1:48:06] and power because we have received a
[1:48:09] kingdom that cannot be moved. We have
[1:48:12] received a kingdom that cannot be
[1:48:14] shaken. We have received a kingdom that
[1:48:16] cannot be defeated. They have received a
[1:48:19] kingdom that has no challenge,
[1:48:23] no contender.
[1:48:25] That's what we receive. So we are more
[1:48:28] than a mash for the devil to meet every
[1:48:31] devil's lies in these last days. God
[1:48:34] made it, not me.
[1:48:37] I'm so happy. Amen. He loves me. I'm so
[1:48:42] glad for his salvation. I'm so glad for
[1:48:47] the message of the hour.
[1:48:50] I'm so glad for he has always been there
[1:48:54] for me. I am so glad that Jesus loves
[1:48:59] me.
[1:49:00] Jesus loves me.
[1:49:03] Oh, he loves me. I am so glad that Jesus
[1:49:08] loves me. Jesus loves me. Even me. It's
[1:49:14] not my making. It's not your making. Not
[1:49:17] for you to proud or think you are better
[1:49:19] than somebody or you are better than
[1:49:21] yellow color. You are better than a
[1:49:22] white color. You are better than a green
[1:49:24] color. You are better than a black
[1:49:26] color. Nobody is nothing.
[1:49:30] We are all one color in the spirit.
[1:49:34] Because in the spirit we have one
[1:49:35] garment, white garment. And when we show
[1:49:38] up over there by the grace of God,
[1:49:41] everybody is not is showing up with a
[1:49:43] white color. You can't see a yellow man,
[1:49:45] you can't see a white man. You can't see
[1:49:47] a black man, you can't see a green man.
[1:49:50] Everybody's showing up in one color.
[1:49:53] Amen.
[1:49:54] Praise God. May God help us.
[1:49:58] As we read this scripture, let's close.
[1:50:01] The Bible said in the book of Hebrew,
[1:50:04] chapter 12 27-29.
[1:50:09] That's what we are. Our appearance shake
[1:50:13] every environment.
[1:50:16] So we become the talk of the town. We
[1:50:19] are the talk of the world.
[1:50:22] So people can't understand
[1:50:25] but we know who we are. We caught the
[1:50:28] revelation of the last me prophet
[1:50:31] message. So there is no prophet coming
[1:50:34] again. Amen.
[1:50:37] I don't care what you say you are. You
[1:50:39] are good to go with it. That's not my
[1:50:40] business. You are free. I don't have
[1:50:42] anything against you. And you can't be
[1:50:43] the talk of my the talk of my pulpit. No
[1:50:46] no no no no no.
[1:50:48] My puppet is so far away from talking
[1:50:50] about who you claim yourself to be. If
[1:50:52] it bothers me, I need and pray for you.
[1:50:54] That's all I can do. I pray for you, I
[1:50:56] forget you.
[1:50:58] Because don't let nobody
[1:51:01] become a challenges, stumbling block on
[1:51:03] your way to this heaven.
[1:51:06] God gave us love to disanol everything,
[1:51:09] defile everything and walk our way.
[1:51:12] Victory to heaven.
[1:51:15] Romans chapter Hebrews chapter 12 he
[1:51:19] said
[1:51:20] and this word
[1:51:23] now this word in the beginning was the
[1:51:25] word and the word was with God and the
[1:51:26] word was God and the word was made flesh
[1:51:29] and dwell among us and the same word
[1:51:31] were revealed to us in this last day
[1:51:33] through the prophet to call her the
[1:51:34] bride. So the Bible say in this word
[1:51:39] revealed to us. So we put ourself in our
[1:51:42] day. Amen.
[1:51:45] In this word
[1:51:47] and I say revealed to us through the
[1:51:49] prophet in this last day. Can you say
[1:51:51] amen to that? Amen. Yes. You believe it.
[1:51:56] in this word
[1:51:58] yet once more sneak signify
[1:52:03] the things signify the removing of those
[1:52:07] things that are what shaking
[1:52:13] let's not let me not say anything now
[1:52:15] before we read further think about it
[1:52:18] what are those things that are shaking
[1:52:21] that this word reveal to us signify the
[1:52:25] remover of it.
[1:52:29] Yes, we must be thinking about that.
[1:52:32] Let's we read the Bible, read it like
[1:52:34] scripture. We read it out of the mind of
[1:52:37] the message.
[1:52:38] Amen. So if you say we are not Bible
[1:52:41] student, you are telling lies. Come and
[1:52:42] challenge me. I've stood with priests,
[1:52:46] different countries,
[1:52:48] challenge them with the Bible. deeper
[1:52:50] life uh uh uh what you call it seven
[1:52:53] days I've had this they think they know
[1:52:55] the Bible I stood with them challenged
[1:52:58] them Jehovah witness I took their own
[1:53:00] Bible and convinced them I said you you
[1:53:03] wrote Bible and you think that this
[1:53:05] Bible is strong I say I'm going we are
[1:53:06] going to use your Bible see there's
[1:53:09] nowhere Jesus is God because why is
[1:53:12] Jesus saying I came and my father and
[1:53:15] this and he that sent me is greater than
[1:53:17] me why did Jesus say that I said You see
[1:53:20] you lack revelation.
[1:53:23] No matter how we explain it for you, you
[1:53:25] will not see it. But let me show you
[1:53:26] something. Did you know in your Bible
[1:53:29] Jesus declare himself that is God of
[1:53:31] heaven and earth, the almighty? He said,
[1:53:33] "No." I took him to Isaiah chapter 9:6.
[1:53:37] He said, "Oh, he's a mighty God. Is not
[1:53:39] an a he's a mighty God is not the
[1:53:42] almighty God." I said, "Don't worry." I
[1:53:43] said, "Open your Bible again and see."
[1:53:45] And he opened to Revelation chapter one
[1:53:48] p. I am he the first and the last. He
[1:53:52] that liveth and was dead. And he said I
[1:53:55] said who is that? He said Jesus. And he
[1:53:57] was reading and he said the beginning
[1:53:59] and the ending the almighty. He closed
[1:54:03] the Bible said don't close it.
[1:54:05] You think we don't read Bible and you go
[1:54:08] about saying that we don't read Bible.
[1:54:09] We are reading prophet message. with
[1:54:12] this message we can tell you Bible from
[1:54:14] A to Z because right in the message is
[1:54:17] the Genesis to Revelation.
[1:54:22] He was shocked and he said, "Brother,
[1:54:26] you are conk." I still remember that
[1:54:28] word. He said about 10 years or 15 years
[1:54:30] ago, I still remember say you are conk.
[1:54:33] So, what is this? Then I put the message
[1:54:36] start bringing him the message. He's
[1:54:37] from Canada. He came to Africa as a
[1:54:40] mission missionary to evangelize. I
[1:54:44] said, "What you are having?" Zero. You
[1:54:46] are working your way to hell.
[1:54:49] So said, "What do you mean?" I said yes
[1:54:51] because you have seen it in your Bible
[1:54:53] and I will see whether if you will deny
[1:54:55] it.
[1:54:57] This is not my Bible. So if you deny
[1:54:59] what your Bible said, you're walking
[1:55:01] your way to hell. You are against your
[1:55:03] own Bible you are using. Yeah. And if
[1:55:05] your Bible is powerful than you, then
[1:55:08] you are dead.
[1:55:10] And you just pick his Bible and ref
[1:55:14] say yes. The theologians they set me up
[1:55:17] in Indian Republic where I used to go
[1:55:19] and eat after evangelism. They came
[1:55:22] there in group and they started bringing
[1:55:24] tricks and you know some people group of
[1:55:29] people in this world they always talk
[1:55:30] about a prophet they causing confusion
[1:55:32] in the message. I was listening I was
[1:55:35] eating my food. I said please let me
[1:55:37] have a enjoy my food because the journey
[1:55:38] I've gone walking under the sun. I don't
[1:55:41] want anybody to disturb my mind. I want
[1:55:42] to enjoy my food very well. So they were
[1:55:45] talking and they even said a messenger a
[1:55:48] prophet William false
[1:55:51] prophet I was eating when I finish I
[1:55:53] drink my water I said what are you
[1:55:56] people talking about this man I knew
[1:55:58] because why is it that it is when I came
[1:56:00] there they came and start that issue and
[1:56:03] how did they know that I'm preaching
[1:56:05] that gospel
[1:56:07] and he started I said ah it's a simple
[1:56:10] thing you says brother Brian who brought
[1:56:12] baptism in the name of Jesus I said,
[1:56:14] "Forget about that. It's not brother.
[1:56:16] It's the Bible." He said, "No, it's
[1:56:18] brother Abraham." I said, "Okay."
[1:56:20] I open to act. I said, "Read yourself."
[1:56:25] I said, "And Peter said,
[1:56:28] I said, and brother Brian said, they
[1:56:29] said, no, Peter said, I said, then you
[1:56:31] must be stupid.
[1:56:33] You must be stupid accusing somebody
[1:56:36] falsely." And brother Brian said, "No,
[1:56:38] it's Peter said, "Then you must be
[1:56:39] stupid." So you just make yourself what
[1:56:44] did I said? They commit themsel to
[1:56:46] misunderstanding. They just put themsel
[1:56:48] in a way not to understand nothing.
[1:56:52] So what is it? The people of this world
[1:56:55] as the Bible said they have see their
[1:56:57] life with death and in other words they
[1:57:00] have committed themselves to
[1:57:01] misunderstanding. No matter how you made
[1:57:04] it clear still they don't want to agree
[1:57:06] to understand it. So therefore the
[1:57:08] people of this world has committed
[1:57:10] themselves to misunderstanding and death
[1:57:12] is awaiting them. That's right. Unless
[1:57:15] they repent because there is still time.
[1:57:17] We don't give chance. So we don't give
[1:57:19] we don't speak. Sorry if somebody don't
[1:57:21] speak like you. I'm not against you.
[1:57:22] That is how I preach because I know the
[1:57:25] kind of people I'm dealing with and I
[1:57:26] don't know the kind of people you are
[1:57:28] that sitting here. So forgive me if I
[1:57:30] offend you by my speech. Forgive me. God
[1:57:32] bless you brother. Let's read. said this
[1:57:34] word
[1:57:36] signify the remover of those things that
[1:57:39] are shaking. Yeah. As of those things
[1:57:44] that are made. No.
[1:57:48] Do you have it there? Okay. Yes. This
[1:57:50] one is better.
[1:57:52] And this word yet once more signify the
[1:57:56] removal of those things that are
[1:57:58] shaking. That's why I said think about
[1:58:00] it. What are the things that are shaking
[1:58:02] and the word signify the pulling away of
[1:58:05] those things. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:08] As of the things that are made
[1:58:12] that those things which cannot be shaken
[1:58:17] may remain.
[1:58:19] Hallelujah.
[1:58:23] Hallelujah.
[1:58:24] Wherefore
[1:58:27] receiving we have we receiving wherefore
[1:58:31] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:58:35] what?
[1:58:37] Let us hold have grace
[1:58:40] whereby we may serve God acceptable.
[1:58:44] Hallelujah. With reverence and godly
[1:58:48] fear. We are closing. What are the
[1:58:51] things that are shaking
[1:58:55] that the things that
[1:58:58] cannot be shaken will remain?
[1:59:02] Amen.
[1:59:04] What are those things? The word,
[1:59:09] the message of the hour
[1:59:12] is symbolize removing those things that
[1:59:14] are shaking. The things that are shaking
[1:59:17] are things that God didn't need.
[1:59:20] things those things that are not made by
[1:59:22] God.
[1:59:24] Hallelujah. Every tree that has not been
[1:59:28] raising of my father asks John say God
[1:59:31] is ask is there to remove them. So that
[1:59:35] is why the believer the born again the
[1:59:39] adopted sons and daughter they called
[1:59:41] out
[1:59:43] they becomes a judgment they become a
[1:59:46] talk of the town. When you come
[1:59:49] when you started leaving they started
[1:59:52] wondering what is happening in this kind
[1:59:55] of life. So they are panicking and when
[1:59:58] you start telling them about the message
[1:59:59] they they start what is you are you
[2:00:01] talking about? Are you crazy? Are you
[2:00:03] out of your mind? You're not out of they
[2:00:05] are shaking. They are panicking. So you
[2:00:07] become a judgment to them.
[2:00:11] So when you appear, when you are living
[2:00:13] straight in the word, you abide in me
[2:00:16] and my word abide in you, your life is
[2:00:20] no longer your life. Paul said the
[2:00:23] things I used to do, I want I I love
[2:00:25] doing, I can't do them again. But the
[2:00:28] things I I don't have desire. I was
[2:00:31] fighting against those are the same. Now
[2:00:33] I I I love doing. He said this one is
[2:00:36] not me. is Christ that lives in me. So
[2:00:41] the people were panic wondering what has
[2:00:43] happened to Paul. So like Paul life and
[2:00:46] his experience and it becomes a trouble
[2:00:48] to the people that when he started
[2:00:51] talking they are panicking till the king
[2:00:54] said Paul you will you also convert me
[2:00:57] to become part of you. He's afraid that
[2:00:59] Paul is going to to to convert him
[2:01:02] because he's shaking what he's holding
[2:01:05] is not made by God. So when those things
[2:01:07] that are that that that are made by God,
[2:01:10] the word of God comes to him. So he
[2:01:12] cannot stand
[2:01:14] the things that are made by God, the
[2:01:17] word promised to us, those are the only
[2:01:19] thing that can stand. And when they have
[2:01:21] been declared in the midst of the things
[2:01:23] God doesn't made, then the things that
[2:01:26] are not made started shaking. They
[2:01:29] carried panicking, looking for somewhere
[2:01:31] to hide themsel, looking for excuse to
[2:01:33] make their way, all kind of things. What
[2:01:35] is it? The word symbolizes the remover
[2:01:39] of the things that are shaking. That's
[2:01:41] right. The message of the hour, you
[2:01:43] remover symbolize the remover of the
[2:01:46] things that are shaking. God didn't make
[2:01:48] sickness. God didn't make affliction.
[2:01:50] God didn't make kidney failure. God
[2:01:52] didn't make heart attack. God didn't
[2:01:54] make BP blood pressure. God didn't make
[2:01:58] all this frustration. So the Oh,
[2:02:00] hallelujah. The word of God symbolize
[2:02:03] the removal of those things that God
[2:02:05] didn't make. Thank you, Jesus. You are
[2:02:09] the solution.
[2:02:11] You are the answer. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:14] Wow.
[2:02:16] Of the devil's lie. All that he made,
[2:02:20] you become the answer to it. So you the
[2:02:24] word representing the word as an
[2:02:26] ambassador symbolize the removal of
[2:02:29] everything. Therefore we come together
[2:02:32] put our hands together pray for those
[2:02:36] things that God didn't need. Hallelujah.
[2:02:39] Anoint them in the name of the Lord.
[2:02:41] Rebuke the devil because God didn't made
[2:02:44] it. He's just there to to the children
[2:02:47] of God. God didn't make it.
[2:02:51] Take the name of Jesus, wave it as a
[2:02:53] wave offering over every sickness and he
[2:02:56] will find his way because God didn't
[2:02:58] make it. And the reason is that the
[2:03:00] word, the name symbolize the removal of
[2:03:03] those things that God didn't make. When
[2:03:06] you recognize your position, may God
[2:03:08] help us. May God help us. Shall we be on
[2:03:11] our feet as we as we close? Shall we be
[2:03:13] on our feet? I want to read a quote.
[2:03:14] Let's be on our feet.
[2:03:18] The word of God
[2:03:20] symbolize the remover of those things
[2:03:23] that are shaking. So let's read a quote.
[2:03:26] The word of God.
[2:03:31] Amen.
[2:03:39] Reading from the message adoption. And
[2:03:42] the prophet said
[2:03:50] something else to read.
[2:04:04] Hallelujah.
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:27] Let me get it here.
[2:04:31] Hallelujah.
[2:04:34] Let me get it here.
[2:04:37] Take courage and move forward.
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:48] Just one minute. It's like a mix where I
[2:04:50] place it, but I think I can go to other
[2:04:52] messages and get it.
[2:04:57] [Music]
[2:05:02] The devil don't want me to read that
[2:05:03] quote. We will read the quote. How was
[2:05:05] it?
[2:05:14] Move forward.
[2:05:16] Supposed to be here.
[2:05:18] You going to help me.
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:23] Go help me. Go help me. Go help me.
[2:05:28] Yes.
[2:05:30] Yes. I got it. Just one minute.
[2:05:34] Hallelujah. I got it. That's the
[2:05:37] message. Witness
[2:05:40] called out to be a witness of the
[2:05:43] resurrection of Jesus Christ. Now from
[2:05:47] paragraph 35,
[2:05:51] every man today
[2:05:54] knows that he can take the name of Jesus
[2:05:58] Christ and meet any foes at any place
[2:06:04] any time. Yes. And he will defeat
[2:06:09] he will be defeated. Amen. Is that
[2:06:12] right?
[2:06:14] I have met witch doctors. I have met
[2:06:19] demons of all sorts and never seen a
[2:06:23] time. But what they did bow to the name
[2:06:28] of Jesus.
[2:06:32] Tell you friend, when the church the
[2:06:37] God, yes. Hallelujah. lost the name and
[2:06:42] the power of the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:46] They lost it
[2:06:48] when they went down.
[2:06:51] Praise the Lord. Talking about Moses, we
[2:06:55] come down. He said it we it was the
[2:06:59] stick that they had to the hair. It was
[2:07:06] the stick that hold over the water. It
[2:07:10] was the It was God judgment
[2:07:13] rod and what what the stick of Mos what
[2:07:18] the stick was in Moses' hand. The name
[2:07:22] of Jesus Christ is to the born again
[2:07:28] church.
[2:07:31] Praise God.
[2:07:34] Get it? away from there and he is gone.

[2:07:45] you. Child of sorrow and of woe,
[2:07:48] temptations around you, breathe the holy
[2:07:51] name in prayer.

[2:07:59] hand represent the name of Jesus. And
[2:08:03] when you take that stick from Moses hand
[2:08:06] is done. Amen. You bring him down.
[2:08:11] Any man that takes the name of Jesus,
[2:08:15] meet the devil anywhere, any situation,
[2:08:19] any condition, he will surely defeat
[2:08:21] him.

[2:09:46] Hallelujah.
[2:09:48] Praise God. shall bow down our heads.
[2:09:52] Brother and sister, the prophet said,
[2:09:55] "Whatsoever the message of the hour has
[2:09:57] preached, the pillar of fire is here."
[2:10:01] And there is a song that said is here.
[2:10:03] Elijah, God is here to do and will
[2:10:06] whatever you say.
[2:10:09] Jesus, the God of the message of the
[2:10:12] hour,
[2:10:14] is here tonight. If you can believe,
[2:10:19] hold within your heart and lift your
[2:10:21] hands up and say, "God, remember me."
[2:10:25] No matter what it is, no matter what you
[2:10:28] have been going through, no matter what
[2:10:30] you are passing through, no matter what
[2:10:32] you are trusting, God, I'm telling you,

[2:10:55] and to conceive in the heart that you
[2:10:57] are still the same yesterday, today and

[2:11:02] the message of the hour. That you have
[2:11:04] never failed. You are always there
[2:11:08] to prove that you are still the God of
[2:11:10] the bride, the God of the message of the
[2:11:13] hour. That everywhere this message is
[2:11:15] proved, your presence is there. The God
[2:11:19] of Elijah, the God of Malachi 4, the God
[2:11:22] of William Brown, hallelujah, was there
[2:11:24] to do and will to prove himself that is
[2:11:27] still God over the universe. Therefore,
[2:11:30] we ask for mercy and we say forgive us
[2:11:34] for our unbelief. Lord, once again, let
[2:11:37] the power of the blood of Jesus move in
[2:11:40] a special way like never before. Sweep
[2:11:43] over every soul, nullify, dissolve every
[2:11:46] doubt and unbelief, every evil
[2:11:49] conscience of doubleminded
[2:11:52] or second thought. Lord, may the power
[2:11:55] of the blood never lose the strength in
[2:11:58] this congregation.
[2:11:59] May he move in a special way and
[2:12:02] dissolve and nullify every fierce and
[2:12:05] double-minded. And may the power of the
[2:12:08] Holy Ghost, the great serum of God,
[2:12:11] sweep over their soul from their
[2:12:13] bloodstream
[2:12:15] down to the head,
[2:12:17] wipe off, wash away every trace and
[2:12:21] spot, sickness, diseases, whatsoever
[2:12:25] kind of situation. Let the Holy Ghost,
[2:12:28] the great ser of God move in the name of
[2:12:32] Jesus.
[2:12:33] Dissolve, break down every fetter,
[2:12:36] frustrate, nullify every sickness,
[2:12:39] set them free from the power of
[2:12:40] darkness, unbelief, and whatsoever is
[2:12:43] behind the back of their heart as a
[2:12:45] desire. What are they trusting for? For
[2:12:48] their sons, for their daughter, for
[2:12:50] their children, for their work, for
[2:12:53] their body, we stand upon your word by
[2:12:56] the authority of the Holy Ghost. Father,
[2:12:58] we rebuke every demon behind their
[2:13:01] situation
[2:13:02] and they will receive
[2:13:06] that which is in the deepest of their
[2:13:08] heart desire. Let it be. We ask it in
[2:13:12] the name of Jesus as we stand upon your
[2:13:15] word. We take up the name of Jesus and
[2:13:18] Lord this hour. I wave it as a wave
[2:13:20] offering over this church. I wave it as
[2:13:22] a wave offering over your people. Lord,
[2:13:25] we wave your name. The name of Jesus,
[2:13:28] the name that is above other name, the
[2:13:30] name that all name is must bowar, we
[2:13:33] rise up with it by the evidence of the
[2:13:35] Holy Ghost. We wave it over the church.
[2:13:38] We wave it over the congregation. We
[2:13:40] wave it over their life. We wave it over
[2:13:42] their desire, Lord, that you set them
[2:13:45] free,
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:48] that they will go and come back with
[2:13:50] testimony that you are God. Jesus Christ
[2:13:54] the same yesterday, today and forever
[2:13:56] more. Grant it Lord we ask in the name
[2:13:59] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:14:04] Hallelujah.
[2:14:06] Invite the pastor. Sorry for taking your
[2:14:09] time. I was not able to check the time
[2:14:12] but I knew I took your time. So you
[2:14:14] forgive me before I leave.
[2:14:18] God bless you. Amen.
[2:14:23] Joy of heaven. Sing it again. Oh, this
[2:14:28] name.
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:31] Oh, how sweet.
[2:14:33] [Music]
[2:14:34] Hope of earth and joy of heaven,
[2:14:41] precious name.
[2:14:45] Oh, how sweet.
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:48] hope of earth and joy of heaven.
[2:14:55] Oh, take the name of Jesus with
[2:15:01] you
[2:15:03] as a shield from every snare.
[2:15:10] Lift temptations round you gather.
[2:15:16] Breathe that holy name in prayer.
[2:15:22] Oh precious name. Aren't you glad for
[2:15:25] the name of Jesus?
[2:15:28] Glad that we have that position that we
[2:15:30] can display that token the life of
[2:15:34] Christ.
[2:15:35] Oh precious name.
[2:15:39] Oh, how sweet.
[2:15:43] Hope of earth and joy of heaven.
[2:15:51] Well, did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:15:54] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:58] Amen.
[2:15:59] Glad that we have a position.
[2:16:03] And it's not a position that man gives
[2:16:06] us, but God gave us from the foundation
[2:16:10] of the world. And it's being declared to
[2:16:13] us in in this age, in this time. And it
[2:16:17] is the time of the manifestation of sons
[2:16:20] of God, the revealing of the sons of
[2:16:23] God. And I'm I'm certainly glad for
[2:16:26] that. And no matter what we go through,
[2:16:30] what we face, Amen. And we can look,
[2:16:34] amen, at that obstacle, amen, and and
[2:16:39] speak to that and command it to go.
[2:16:42] Amen. And I'm I'm I'm thankful for that.
[2:16:45] There is no weapon formed against us
[2:16:47] that's going to prosper. No weapon
[2:16:49] whatsoever.
[2:16:51] And I like what the brother said, it has
[2:16:53] to be dark. Amen. For us to shine, there
[2:16:56] has to be a contrast. And if we are
[2:16:58] lights, then God would put us in in the
[2:17:02] darkest age ever. Not for us to blend in
[2:17:05] with the darkness, but to shine our
[2:17:07] light. Amen. For it is the light that is
[2:17:11] 10 million times stronger than darkness.
[2:17:14] Amen. Maybe we could just sing that
[2:17:17] song. I love him. I love him. Oh, I
[2:17:24] love him.
[2:17:28] Yes, I
[2:17:32] love him
[2:17:35] because
[2:17:38] he first
[2:17:41] loved me
[2:17:47] and pray
[2:17:50] just my
[2:17:53] salvation.
[2:17:56] ation
[2:17:59] on Cal.
[2:18:04] Aren't you glad that you can love him?
[2:18:07] He made a way of redemption that we
[2:18:09] could express our love. Oh, I
[2:18:15] love him.
[2:18:18] I
[2:18:21] love him
[2:18:24] because
[2:18:26] he first
[2:18:30] loved me
[2:18:35] and purchased
[2:18:38] my
[2:18:41] salvation.
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:47] on Calary's
[2:18:53] tree
[2:18:55] as they just play softly.
[2:18:58] We want to keep uh brother Jeffrey in
[2:19:01] our prayer and
[2:19:03] he's um been just pouring himself out
[2:19:09] and traveling and um
[2:19:12] uh he's just kind of worn down in body.
[2:19:15] He was telling me that uh he was in
[2:19:18] urgent he's had been in New Jersey for
[2:19:20] about two weeks and a pastor friend of
[2:19:24] his I think is a doctor and um but uh
[2:19:30] took him to the doctor to check his
[2:19:33] blood pressure. It was 234
[2:19:36] and uh that's very very high. the doctor
[2:19:41] said, "I I don't understand why you're
[2:19:43] even standing, how you even walked in
[2:19:45] here." And um so he's been very very
[2:19:51] not feeling good. And so we want to keep
[2:19:55] Brother Jeffrey in our prayer
[2:19:58] uh that the Lord will just touch his
[2:19:59] body. Amen. And make him whole. And um
[2:20:05] well, we need men that'll proclaim the
[2:20:07] gospel, that's not ashamed of the
[2:20:09] message, that will just declare it how
[2:20:12] it is to the people. And and we want to
[2:20:15] just continue praying for him, his
[2:20:18] family, his church, his ministry
[2:20:21] that uh God will just bless him and keep
[2:20:24] him. Amen. and um had a little accident
[2:20:31] just now and uh Heidi's broke her nose
[2:20:34] and so uh they have taken her to the ER
[2:20:39] and uh so we want to pray for that
[2:20:42] situation.
[2:20:44] doctors. Lord will just help her and uh
[2:20:49] be with Josiah Mindy there and um but
[2:20:53] you know the devil's just always trying
[2:20:55] to work in some way somehow and uh but
[2:20:59] we are victors. I I just believe that.
[2:21:04] And um so if maybe we could just bow our
[2:21:08] heads and
[2:21:10] we've just heard the message. We've
[2:21:12] heard just what we are as sons and
[2:21:14] daughters of God. I just believe that.
[2:21:18] Believe that with all of my heart.
[2:21:21] Let's just ask sons and daughters. Let's
[2:21:23] just go to our father in prayer. Pray
[2:21:27] for brother Jeffrey Heidi. Lord Jesus,
[2:21:33] we don't come to you as beggars.
[2:21:37] We don't approach you as strangers,
[2:21:41] as one that is estranged from you. But
[2:21:45] you had made a way of redemption,
[2:21:49] that the gap would be closed and there
[2:21:52] would be no gap that we could come
[2:21:55] into your presence before your throne of
[2:21:59] grace and find help in time of need. And
[2:22:03] the way we would come is boldly for
[2:22:06] that's the way you've told us to
[2:22:08] approach it. Come boldly before the
[2:22:10] throne of grace.
[2:22:12] And father
[2:22:14] I'm just asking that you would touch
[2:22:16] Lord Brother Jeffrey and
[2:22:19] Lord as he has poured himself out to us
[2:22:22] and we can see that this message is dear
[2:22:25] to him as it is to us and how true it
[2:22:29] is. You're calling your bride from all
[2:22:31] around the world. It's it's it's not
[2:22:34] American bride. It's it's an
[2:22:36] international bride. And Father, I pray
[2:22:39] that you would bless him and Lord, that
[2:22:42] you would touch his body,
[2:22:44] Father, cause that blood pressure to
[2:22:46] come down and and to start working
[2:22:50] right, Lord. And I pray that you would
[2:22:53] give strength to him.
[2:22:55] Lord, that you would just bless his
[2:22:57] family and church, his ministry back
[2:23:01] home, Father, the efforts that he's
[2:23:03] putting in to establish souls into this
[2:23:06] message. I pray, Lord, that you would
[2:23:09] just bless him doubly, Father. And Lord,
[2:23:13] I pray that you would touch Heidi. and
[2:23:15] as we had prayer for in in outside and
[2:23:19] Lord, but we're we're asking again,
[2:23:22] Lord, just believing that you you'll
[2:23:25] just make everything okay, Father. Just
[2:23:28] uh uh just calm uh Josiah and Mindy,
[2:23:34] Father, and may your peace be with them,
[2:23:36] Father. I pray Lord, I just pray that
[2:23:40] you would bless the congregation,
[2:23:43] Father, and just grant their heart's
[2:23:45] desire.
[2:23:46] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name and
[2:23:50] amen.
