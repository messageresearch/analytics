promised he would bring you through am and I'm certainly glad for that amen I trust everyone had a good day today amen and uh certainly a beautiful one and a good day to serve the Lord amen and musicians can be dismissed um uh good to have brother Steve sister Elizabeth amen and just thinking about you today and uh so uh good to have them and and uh good to have brother Mark with us on a Wednesday night and just everyone in the house of the Lord if you have your Bibles we're going to turn uh to the Book of Revelations the 3 chapter we've been uh reading this the past couple services but I would like to go back to it uh Revelations 3 and 14 and certainly um en enjoyed the uh question and answers the other night and and um hope everyone that was here enjoyed it and um it's a definitely a good study amen but uh Revelations 3 and we'll start at the 14th verse and unto the angel of the Church of the lay Osan write these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with iav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to to him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath ear let him hear what the spirit sath to the church amen then um The Book of Romans the 12th chapter and uh read the uh first [Music] two verses there I believe Romans 12 and um we'll start at the first verse says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen let's just bow our heads Hearts to the Lord precious father we humbly ask father that you would just be with us now as we come to this part of the service which we believe to be the most important father for it's your word that you have hid us behind it's your word that we live by we can't live by anything else but your word and we just ask that you would just Inspire it to us father and may it be planted deep in our hearts help us Lord to receive father and that we may grow thereby I pray that you would not only anoint me but anoint the people as well we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats this evening and I going to use the title uh again uh overcoming the age of lukewarmness and we know that there is going to be an overcomer and uh for God did address them in the in that age um there but uh we we read there be not conformed but be ye transformed and of course um that that is the Overcomer those that are not conformed but transformed and of course the word conformed means to Fashion alike or conform to the same pattern so you you don't want to be conform to the same pattern as the world whatever you you are to overcome then you you you can't be fashioned like that and then transformed means something that has been changed something that's changed from one thing to another so the Overcomer is the one who doesn't follow the same pattern of the world the same traits the same characteristics the same habits uh you you you can't do that now the the the thing is is we have to overcome that because it's it's the easiest thing to conform because we're all born of of a carnal nature uh the adamic nature Fallen nature whatever you'd want to call it and the world operates by that um uh anything that is world based or of the world it it is inspired it comes from that carnal nature and so it's it's Auto automatically appealing to us it's automatically something that would attract us pull us draw us it's something that we would adapt to because that's part of us uh as carnal human beings um that's why rock and roll will will get it a little child uh at a very young age because it's it's something that is it comes from the carnal and and therefore that carnal nature uh uh automatically Falls in line with that uh uh movies uh television um uh smoking drugs sex uh uh all of these things uh it's it's it's something that would be easy to conform to be because and even religion even religion would be something to conform to so easily because it all comes from a a carnal uh it's it's a carnal thing and and that's that's uh so but but the the Overcomer is transformed it it it transformed Chang from one thing to another so so we we are living in the age of la le osia uh and and yes we know we're in the bright Age and and brother I I believe brother Brandon put that distinction bride age leay OS sea age is to show that we're not of the leodys and age that's the briad ages for the Overcomer and and so their traits their habits their characteristics everything about that Overcomer that bride age is totally different than a Le oosa but yet we're in leosia we're we're just like it you know we're in the world but we're not of the world ain't ain't that right and and so we're we're living in Le oosa but we're not part of that age we're not to be identified with age we're not to be uh uh um you know we we we don't identify with that we're not to we are actually to overcome it we are not to feel at home in this age we are not to adapt to this age uh we are called to overcome it and and so now brother bradam says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks uh a lot of people say see there is no devil it's just just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real ain't that right now I'll just tell you right now you won't recognize him to be real or recognize him in every one of his tricks by your carnal nature amen you you it it just seems because you feel at home you just think it's comfortable you just think it's you know uh the the thing and a lot of people believe it's just of God really but but it's it it's a devil and you must recognize him in every one of his tricks you you he said so you must know he's a devil the same time you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you how many believes that he he's against you and yet he'll appeal to your carnal nature he'll he'll appeal to your your flesh your spirit he he appeal to all this this but yet he's against you that's why the the prophet called enticing spirits but as they because they're they're they're appealing they're they're attractive but yet they're against you see and and so uh uh uh uh so so he's against you and then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than than he is the devil and that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by Grace you are more than a match for him see and so there's real overcoming when you recognize aren't you glad for that so there's no excuse for not uh uh overcoming it's just how to overcome you've got to recognize him you've got to recognize him in every one of his tricks you got to recognize that he is a devil and that he's against you ain't that right and then then the other part of recognition is you got to recognize that God the god that's in you is greater and mightier than the devil ain't that right amen and and recognize that God has already overcome uh uh uh the your enemy that's right see and so this is the greatest age of deception uh that that we're living in and and so then that tells us that in the greatest age of deception people aren't going to recognize people aren't going to know and and and yet the over Comer will be the only one to recognize showing that he isn't deceived there is a people that will never be deceived amen it would be so close that it would deceive the elect if it were possible that it can't it he'll never deceive the elect therefore that elect is the one that recognizes him in every one of his tricks and they are the Overcomer amen see and and so uh they recognize who is who what is what they they recognize that see and so now you'll not see the need to overcome uh uh if you don't recognize what you must overcome amen because a lot of times the things that you enjoy you've got to overcome that the the thing that you wouldd like to feel at home with you've got to overcome that the things that are attractive the things that appeal to you amen you've got to overcome that and that's why it would take amen recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks recognize that devil recognize what that spirit is trying to do to you where it's trying to take you amen where it's trying to go can you say amen amen you see so the Bible foretold that a people would get in in a condition to where they wouldn't be able to recognize or another word for recognize is discern uh uh between Good and Evil amen Isaiah 5:20 says woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put Darkness for light and light for darkness and that put for bitter or bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter you talking about a confused people ain't that right amen they didn't change the bitterness Amen to Sweet they just can't tell the difference amen what is bitter they think it's sweet they call it sweet what is really evil they call it good and what is good they really call it evil see so we're we're this this is a perfect Prophecy of the day that we're living in an age of deception now it's the greatest Age The Prophet said it's it's even greater than what Eve done now you think of the deception that Eve went through amen God told her literally told her don't you eat of that tree I I guarantee you he he he took her to that and said don't you eat of that fruit now don't you eat that tree amen I I don't know but I'm sure God made it very clear of what she wasn't to do amen and and there was no muddle up in her mind because she had never known Satan she had never heard the voice of negative and and all that all she heard was clear truth don't you eat of that but by the time Satan got done with her amen the prophet said that she partook of it thinking that she was doing God a service thinking that she was doing God uh the uh uh the will of God think of that so that was deception but the prophet said that was deception in infant form infancy but we're living in a greater the greatest age of deception now the prophet said there's been greater days of of persecution we read this the other day when when the children of God was uh uh uh put to death on every hand see the greater days of persecution than what we are in today but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never had a day like this we're living now see it's the most cunning deceitful day and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toes today than he ever was in any age can you say amen amen we've got to be on our guard at all times we've got to be on guard amen praise the Lord even when you're having bad days you better be on your toes amen amen when you're when you're discouraged and you ain't feeling good and and and you just don't know which way is up or down don't you let down your guard you got to be on your toes can you say Amen every Christian must be on her toes in this age amen so we can see why overcoming is the in this age is the hardest amen uh uh uh age than it ever was uh uh it it's going to be a a a a Wonder no wonder they're going to want to hear our story amen yes they might have been fed to the lies and they may have been burned at the Stak and all of that and and and and we look at that and say well that was a hard thing amen but so greater is is the deception in this day that is the hardest age to overcome that's why there's going to be very if you make it amen you you understand that right amen as brother Brandon put uh uh draw that to that pyramid it started at the base wide in the first church age but time it got to our age it was just like that amen there there's a more honing than any other age is in this age that God is having to hone us Amen to be able to fit in that slot amen aren't you glad for that amen see so overcoming is harder uh in this age than it was in any other age so it's this age that God had nothing good to say about think of that Amen in in all the other ages he had something nice to say about it but in this age the prophet said he had nothing good to say it was a plain rebuke amen thou sayest I'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not everybody say knowest not don't know it see knowest not that thou art riched miserable poor blind and naked see and so then then what is this the it's it's it's a a it's lukewarm it's an age of lukewarm the people of this age is is lukewarm lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and yet have a form of godliness you talk to most people they're Christians they they they profess God they profess Christianity they they have some type of religious um uh uh uh uh confession or whatever amen and yet smoking drinking uh committing adultery and living in sin and so carnal and all of these things amen but that's what the prophet uh uh Paul I believe would tell us that lovers of pleasure lovers of pleasure there's never been an age where so much entertainment and so much pleasure as it is in this day amen pleasure loving people in this day and yet having a form of God godliness amen see so so they they don't totally reject God Amen they but uh uh they they they go through the rituals of of of of things see but notice now uh uh uh Matthew 2412 Jesus said and because iniquity everybody say iniquity inity because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now that's prophetic of our day today there's never been a time that iniquity amen has reached its peak as it is today amen and the love of many are waxing cold because iniquity is abounding more and more and more see the scripture is is speaking of this Le oysan age amen see love of many wax cold because of iniquity abounding see iniquity you it that's a horrible thing iniquity and yet they have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof still having a form of godliness but yet their love is waxing cold because of iniquity amen amen see and and so now you know uh uh denying the power see uh Paul or Peter would say uh the the having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof having a form of godliness oh God I love you Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus but denying the very power thereof Amen brother brandom said Pentecost is a blessing it's the power of God ain't that right so so what what they're denying is Pentecostal power now you know good and well we're not talking about Pentecostal age brother brandom even said them Pentecostals of of the age amen needed a Pentecostal fire amen they ain't really got what they had or claimed to have see amen so what is this what is the power of God the Pentecostal power whatever you want to call it it's the quickening power that makes you alive amen it it quickens that mortal body amen see brother brandham says this I'm so glad that there is a 10,000 octane power the word of God and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church that's what a the Church of God Amen God wants out of his church amen a people that's got a 10,000 octane power within them where the word of God and the Holy Ghost is lit up in their lives amen and the resurrection power of God Amen is within them pul Satan within them quickening the word to them quickening things of God to life can you say amen amen most people today that go to church they don't know nothing about God they don't know about the miraculous power of God they don't know about the healing power of God they don't know uh uh about the saving power of God they don't know nothing about the delivering power of God do you understand what I'm saying brother brandom even said that the people are the church is turning the people to the doctors now he said especially to the psychiatrist because a church that should know the power of God don't know the power of God they've got the form of godliness amen but they're more acquainted amen with psychology they're more acquainted with a medical field than they are the power of God you see the this power that the church is denying is the Dynamics brother Braham said when you have received this Holy Spirit now see that uh they did at Pentecost see they were the mechanics now the Dynamics had to come see they had believed you know our good Baptist friends tells us when we believe we've got it but they didn't have it see yet they had believed Acts 19 they had believed but they didn't have it have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed see they had the mechanics all right because apollis uh was teaching to them and proving by the Bible see the mechanics that Jesus was the Christ but they didn't have the Dynamics see that's it see he said so when you get the Dynamics you have been quickened from Mortal to immortality it makes the whole body com subject to the word it'll make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different what is it it'll transform you amen instead of you conforming to the world there is a power amen that will transform you amen see so so then this is why amen that this lay otsy a bunch isn't being changed amen they're not being changed amen we've had more clear gospel in this age than any other age and it should be enough to change a person amen but instead of that they're looking for a messiah in politics they're so wrapped up in the things of the world Amen they won't know when Christ comes they won't know when the change really happens to that elect can you say Amen why because they've got a form of godliness they'll accept that amen but they deny that very power well what is that that power is the power of transformation amen see they deny the power of transformation so see the only change that the people are wanting is a perverted change amen they want a world without God they want a world without biblical standards and convictions they want a world without Holiness they want a world without the revealed word can you say Amen they want a world without Christ the person of Christ amen they want a world without a token in this age amen they want to change think of that God has promised them a change he showed them what he would do in this age through Abraham just before he changed them he appeared to them in in flesh amen it was the power that had come to Abraham and Sarah to change them amen but they rejected that when Christ appeared in this day in flesh to change them amen they rejected the power can you say Amen they rejected that that come to them to change them now they're looking for change they're looking for a politician to change them amen they want change in the world they want change in America they want to get rid of all the evil amen and change as though some sinner is going to change them God promised them a change God came to change them and they rejected it can you say man see they they want a world without Holiness they want a they want a world without standards they want a world where they can do what they want when they want so what they want is they want to get rid of the power of Jesus Christ they'll take military power any day but when there's a word power that comes to them they don't want that can you say amen that's right see amen see and so you you remember when he walked the Earth the first time Jesus see they wanted to get rid of him they hated him because he didn't go along with their teachings they hated him because he didn't agree with way the churches were they hated him because he didn't agree with their way of worship and he condemn them for their backsliding ways amen people get offended when you just call it out amen just like like it is amen if you ain't got a strength enough your backslid amen that's what it is amen but God didn't call us to live in a backslid and lay out of SE and age and conformed to this he called us to be on fire for God he called us Amen to stand at our post of Duty and to fight every devil of hell it doesn't matter what it is amen but he condemned them for their backsliding ways brother Brown said they hated him so bad because he tore up all their organizations so to rid him out of their sight to get rid of him they buried him see and rode a great big D denominational Stone over the door so he'd be sure not to rise again but we got good news right amen the grave couldn't keep him from rising that old denominational Stone couldn't keep him from coming out and exposing himself and manifesting himself again amen he said see and then he tells them I'm going to send back to the father but I'm going to bring my spirit back Amen to you ain't that right and he told them he told that little elect tear ye into the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that same spirit that has quickened me is now going to Quicken you amen the same God that made me overcome this age is the same God that's going to be in you to cause you overcome and did they overcome you bet they did they overcome see why because the spirit that same spirit that was in Christ amen was dwelling in them now we've talked about the false Vine you all know about it amen and and the false Vine amen was planted it was planted without having the quickening power of God it's a carnal church that false Vine is carnal Amen in that in that false Vine that false Vine produces carnal impersonations carnal interpretation of the scriptures carnal comparisons carnal worship carnal forms of religion carnal Impressions carnal men using gifts in a carnal way everything about it is carnal carnal carnal amen there might be even men that are God called got a true gift in their heart but they'll use it in a carnal way amen got carnal learning they'll go to school they'll what whatever floats their boat they'll do it see it's it's a carnal amen thing ain't that right see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof to Quicken their mind to Quicken their understanding to Quicken their body Amen to Quicken everything about them to the word of God and what has it done it's produced a lukewarm age to where they're not all together cold and not hot but just uh uh lukewarm you know you you drink lukewarm water it'll make you sick drink lukewarm milk it'll make you vomit amen see the prophet said the church should be fervent everybody say fervent amen the church should be fervent Amen in other words hot amen not cold hot ain't that right amen the world should be cold and the church should be hot but it ain't that way amen that everybody's lukewarm Amen to where they they sing country songs and gospel songs rock and roll songs and gospel songs and everybody just pays you know just loves it and swallows it up amen like drinking Kool-Aid you know and and and and it doesn't bother them they'll they'll watch television they'll watch this they'll have this they'll have they'll have all kinds of stuff and it doesn't matter amen that they need the anointing when they get up and sing it doesn't matter that they need the spirit of God Amen to come into their church and break the feds amen they got professional choirs they got professional singers they got professional uh uh musicians they got professional preachers everything's professional it's becoming professional uh uh uh uh uh leoty you understand see amen everything's becoming professional amen but what we need is the spirit we need the church to be on fire for God so hot that God feels welcome in the church see that that word fervent it means having or showing great intensity of feeling or enthusiasm see see the the church world has lost their enthusiasm oh it's true now uh yeah oh yeah but you'll talk to them about cooking and and they'll get excited about that they'll tell you about their new grill they'll tell you about their new their new you know their new recipe they they'll tell you about the the ball games they'll tell you about their new deer and that they just shot or the gun they just shot it with and they they get so excited about everything but when it comes to the things of God they've lost their enthusiasm see amen so so fervent means having or showing great intensity amen of feeling or enthusiasm Amen in other words you become a theme for Christ not a baseball theme a Jesus Christ theme a message theme ain't that right very hot fervent means very hot glowing exhibiting or marked by great intensity of feeling zealous amen so brother Brandon we we read this the other day but brother BR said what is wrong with these people of the last days they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it other words there there's no feeling of intensity about the word of God oh they'll pick up some magazine they'll pick up a love story they'll they'll turn on some rotten stupid filthy movie you understand what I'm saying that it's Godless where you have to turn your head every time you look at it amen boys if you got to turn your head amen it don't belong in your house amen that's right see amen if you got to do these things see amen but what is it see amen we've lost the fervency about the word the world has lost the fervency about the word word amen and what's it doing they've lost their their their their feeling for God Amen it doesn't matter about things anymore women will show their their breast they'll show every form of their body and and and uh the skirts are getting shorter the and getting tighter the blouses are getting Tighter and and you understand what I'm saying amen it's things see and because they ain't fervent about the word brother Brown said they are lukewarm about it now notice what he says look he said the great scientific educational hybrid Eve today called The Church what is she trying to do she is trying to is she trying to exalt God's word and let the people do the way they're doing see uh See she's not trying to exalt God's word amen and she's letting the people just do whatever see now notice he says see they're not using a thinking man's filter or God's filter see look what they're producing they're exalting themselves instead of God's word ain't that right exalting their knowledge exalting their interpretations exalting their wisdom exalting all of that instead of just staying basically with the the basic truths of the Bible see look see so he said they're exalting themselves the church is in her deformed seed of knowledge program has caused the whole race to be scientifically ignorant of the word of God now you think of that now amen man more people going to church and yet scientifically ignorant of the word of God ignorant of the word of God see he said but the people are willfully sinning they're willfully sinning it's brought the whole system of church world today into a willful sin against God and you say Amen it's got to a point that no matter what you tell them they ain't going to listen hey ain't going to listen and yet they'll say Amen to it they they they'll they'll oh yeah yeah preacher go right ahead yeah woohoo and then they won't listen to it something's not causing them to be transformed can you say Amen see so the name Le oia means people's rights or Justice of the people brother Bram said was there ever an age like the 20th century Church age that has seen all Nation rising up and demanding equality socially and financially this is the age of the Communist where all men are supposedly equal though it is only so in theory this is the age of political parties who call themselves Christian democrats Christian socialists Christian Commonwealth Federation Etc Christian Republicans we'll put that in there too amen Christian Independence everybody's just a Christian right Amen in their own rights amen see profess see and so according to our liberal theologians Jesus was also a socialist see that's what that Leota Bunch amen interprets Jesus to be was just a socialist and the early church under the guidance of the spirit practiced socialism and thus we ought to do so today well you know what a socialist is it's an advocate for socialism so they they say Jesus was a an advocate amen for socialism well socialism is a system of society or group living in which there is no private property see so under socialism There Is No Boundaries to a property amen and and and all has rights to it amen I I you have right to my property I got right to your property and and and but not only that then you got right to my property and you got right to his property and we got right to your property there's no boundaries amen everybody's just claiming whatever I got right to your house you got right to mine and da D D D D see and and so we we live in this you know what is mine is yours and what is yours is mine and and it's all equal see and so they say that Jesus was a socialist so so basically what what the what they're trying to represent in the christiandom is that we're all going to heaven heaven is all of ours amen and and and there's so many ways that we can go to heaven and everybody can go to heaven see there's no sinner there's no Sint there's no right and wrong we all have equal rights to heaven we all have equal rights Amen to the body of Christ we all have equal rights to the rapture we have everything in common there's no separation in between us and and the moment you set up amen and start preaching a conviction or whatever people get offended by that how dare you say that to me amen I'm right I'm okay you understand what I'm saying there there's no differention there there's nothing it's just what it is it's a filth love it's human compassion amen it it's something that that a love amen for one another that causes us Amen to push back God's word and and just be acceptable of everything and anything there's no difference can you say Amen so now brother brandom in talking of this Le oosa he said see when the Ancients called Le oosa the Metropol Metropolis Metro whatever uh it was looking forward to the One World Government that we are now setting up we're headed to a One World Government ain't that right as we think of that City being the location of a great church counil we see foreshadow The ecumenical move taking place today see wherein very soon we will see all the so-called Christians come together who's coming together so-called Christians all so-called Christians are coming together they're dropping all their barriers they're dropping all their convictions they're dropping all their rights they're dropping everything their claims everything to where they become acceptant to everything hello he said indeed the church and state religion and politics are coming together that's why the church is so much in politics they're coming together church and state is coming together religion and politics are coming together see and they think it will be the Gathering of all but see what they don't realize it isn't a gathering of all it's only The Binding of the tears yes sir but the wheat wasn't bound with them tears can you say Amen there's going to be an overcomer in this age no matter how how few it is and few it will be but somebody is going to stand there under the power of God Amen and claim what is rightfully theirs by the word of God they're going to withstand that spirit and I say they are withstanding can you say amen I hope this all right for for tonight amen but they withstanding you're you're going through your battles because you're standing amen it you're standing but don't you understand what Satan wanting to get you to do he's wanting you to go with the way of the world and bind you up with the tears but there's already been written that the wheat will not be pound not with the tears the wheat is not bound with the tears it's gathered into the Garner Lord are you with me it's gathered in the Garner why what gathered it there was a carcass that came there was the word the revealed word had come and where the Eagles are the carcasses there is the Eagles are gathered together can you sayen amen the tears are being uh they're being gathered they're being bound together in the world Council of churches you watch it it's happening that's right it's happening now praise the Lord you love him so the weed is the Overcomer that's overcome the spirit of people's rights the spirit of equality if they got to get their toes stepped on so be it if my life is not lining up with this word I want to know that's right if God is got to cut and cut here and cut here and cut here I want him to do it now notice brother briam goes on to say the name Le oia was a very common name back then and it was given to several cities in honor of Royal ladies so named this city was one of the most political politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor Le osia enormous amounts of property were bequeathed to the City by prominent citizens it was the seat of a great Medical School its people were distinguished in the Arts and Sciences it was often called the Metropolis that word again amen as it was the county seat for 25 other cities the Pagan God worshiped there was Zeus in fact this city was once called de dipolos city of Zeus in honor of their God in the fourth Century an important Church Council was held there oh my see in the city of Le oysa frequent earthquakes finally caused its complete abandonment how fitting were the the characteristics of this last age to represent the age in which we now live in see for example they worship one God Zeus who was the chief and father of the Gods see this forecast the 20th century one God father of us all religious premise that sets forth the Brotherhood of men and is now is is even now bringing together the Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus Etc with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increase our love understanding and care of each other the Catholics and Protestants are even now striving for and actually gaining ground in this Union with the avowed intent that all others will follow now they purposed that all others will follow ain't that right this very attitude was seen in the United Nations uh organization when the world leaders refus to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship see they refuse to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship but recommended putting aside all those separate concepts with the hopes that all religions become leveled into one for all desire the same goals all have the same purposes and all are basically right nonsense right am I hope that's all right see they theyve come how did they get to this condition it started out with one Church in the beginning that was on fire and fervent and and on on on excited passionate about God and his word to where it wrote the book of Acts now we've come to this to where it doesn't matter what you believe it doesn't matter which way you worship it doesn't matter nothing they've come to this condition by no longer being fervent by the word and you say well I'll never be like that you better stay fervent you better stay fervent about that word you better not be lukewarm about that word we're in a deceivable age decep a deceiving age can you say man lukewarm now notice the city of Le oysa was one of earthquakes such earthquakes as finally destroyed it this Le oysan age will end in God shaking the whole world that has gone off to make love with the old Harlot not only will World Systems crumble but the very Earth will be shaken and then renovated for the millennial reign of Christ now Church we're here we're seeing the shaking not only in the spiritual world but in the natural world he says the city of Le oysa was rich endowed by the wealthy it was full of culture science abounded see how like today the churches are rich the worship is beautiful and formal but cold and dead culture and education have taken the place of the spirit-given word and faith has been superseded by science people don't need Faith anymore they've got everything at their the disposal at their fingertips by through by science faith has been superseded by science so that man is a victim of materialism that's in this age see what you got to overcome in every attribute ancient Le oosa is found now notice this in every attribute Ancient Ancient Le oysa is found reborn in the 20th century Le oysan age in the mercy of God May those who have an ear to hear come out of her that they may not be partakers of her sins and the consequent judgment and again because iniquity is abounding the love of many has wax cold brother Braham says I you know we got the plenty of churches plenty of teaching plenty of religious gatherings plenty of religious Deeds but we need the love of God ain't that right he said the love is dying away amen and what they got into just a form see beat the piano up and down real hard and holler glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord like that it's just a form see so that tells us that all shouting and dancing and all that is not all NE is not all controlled by the spirit of God or even inspired uh uh uh uh uh by by the spirit of God you can actually be dancing shouting glory to God hallelujah and it just be a form if the fire ain't lit in your oh amen if you're not passionate about the word of God on the job at the house Amen in your life at the school wherever you are your religion is just a form now see it become just a form just a kind of acting what we used to have now think of what he's saying it's just a form just kind of acting God didn't call us to act like the first Pentecostal Church on the the days of Acts we're not to act that's just a form we want that same fire that they had we want the same dynamics that Quicken their body and their spirit and their soul and transform them we want that same Dynamics can you say amen that's right see he says it's just become a form just kind of acting what we used to have and that travail of soul is just about over now think of that so the Pentecostals had come into a form of acting I believe there was elect on that that was there on isusa street that was come out of that isusa street I believe that amen but most of it was just a form it was just acting it's just true but here we've come amen God help us not to just be actors God help you sisters not to just be actors you got your long hair you got your dress you got everything just right but if you can't get rid of your gossip Spirit you're just acting hello amen if we can't get rid of our bitterness if we can't get rid of the things of the world we're just acting and that goes to us men as well if you cannot get rid of that pornography you're just acting you're just being a Pharisee true right living like the world acting like the world treating our wives like they're just idiots you understand what I'm saying God never called you Amen to Lord over your house and and and brother brandham said don't treat your wife like she's just a doorm you can't respect that woman should have married her that you're just acting see amen but what did Brother RM say he said that travail of soul is just about over see people are more in in in at home with sin than they are crying against sin don't worry about I'm just preaching to the church next door so yall don't worry about it now church this just on my heart so if it's not for you don't worry about it pray for the person that it is okay brother Bram said talking about this layot toy and age they think more of their pride and their dignity than they do of the lovely Christ of God young men and young women thinking more of the things of this world than they do of God people put more on the Christmas tree than they do for Christ preachers think more of a meal ticket than they do the gospel you understand this is way osia this is where we're at they think more of the Bunny and the eggs than they do the resurrection of Jesus Christ they put more emphasis on the play and the drama make sure that it's professional amen then accepting the resurrected power of Jesus Christ that's right it's true brother Bram said people of this age think more of their society than they do of Christ they think more of hurting people's feelings than they do of standing for Christ God didn't call you just to be friends with people God called you to be a witness of his resurrection amen the Lord I understand you got to be salty I understand you can't be just you know I I know I use uh a strong language sometimes but you just can't be jerks can't go around being rude stuck up I understand that you got to be friends you got to and I know you are amen but Church there's a spirit in this day that wants us to blend just to blend we don't want to stand out to tell someone that that God actually sent a prophet and what God actually done in this day it's more we we stand more criticism for that then we would to believe that that that that that we you know that someone else would when they tell they pray for uh to an idol of Mary they they don't get criticized for praying for to some dumb Idol but once you tell somebody that God sent a prophet oh you're a cult yeah you understand what I'm saying amen but now notice now we're going to close brother Bri said in the leot AIA or see or last AG self-love everybody say self- Lov self Lov got more people to take selfies standing in the mirror it's funny when I see boys standing in the middle for mirror for hours trying to fix that one little hair what gets on to people I know teenagers go through things but come on boys it doesn't matter if your hair is all nice they'll put pounds of gel on it they'll use a can of hairspray just to hold that one little strand of hair down that's fine whatever but but but notice what it's happening it's becoming increasing in this age more complexes more whatever because see selflove in this lsia or last age self-love hello Church see and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God you should be more in love with God than yourself you should be more in love with God than than the materialist that what does it matter if we have nice cars and nice houses I'm not saying that's wrong but when we put that in front of of of of God and we take that and put that in the place of God something is wrong amen see you got to be Overcomers see so so he said see he said uh uh so I'll read it again in the layot of see or last days self-love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard everybody say we need to guard make that personal I need to guard I want to say this preacher needs to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit see it is time to draw nigh to God and let him feel our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of this last day Church and reject the truth of God which alone everybody say it is alone which alone is able to help us nothing else will be able to help us no politician will be able to help us no doctor of divinity will be able your doctor won't be able to help you psychology won't be able to help you but the truth will be able to help you that's right amen Prophet said iniquity is abounding and we continue to do so now notice and I'll wrap it up thank you for your patience 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity do already work when did it start working in the first age well I I mean the white horse rider right we know it was in the garden but that white horse rider the mystery of iniquity doth already work now now notice iniquity is something that you know you ought not to do and you do it anyhow now Paul tells us in the fourth verse we just read the the SE the the the seventh verse where where the mystery of iniquity does already work but notice now uh in the fourth verse Paul tells us what this mystery of iniquity is who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God ain't that right see so this mystery of iniquity had already been working down Through the Ages see with the the intent opposing exalting himself above all that is called God or that is worship so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing that he himself that he is God that's the one that started this false Vine that's the spirit that was in this false Vine exalting itself above God showing himself that it is God it is right it is righteous you understand we understand that this all going to wind end up in the man of sin amen and all these things amen but but there's been character traits all the way down Through the Ages and that vine that was started as a a small seed has been growing and growing and growing and growing till in this day it's come to full maturity ain't that right see and this mystery of iniquity has has abounded and is going to keep on abounding and because it is abounding people's love for God and the things of God are waxing cold now if you go in the ninth verse even him Who coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love the of the truth notice it wasn't that the truth did not come to them amen it wasn't even that they did not see the truth they didn't have a love for the truth truth you understand what I'm saying amen see and that puts us now we that that puts us on danger ground because we know what God has done in this age and if we become to where we're not passionate about this message and we just just treat it like some of and we become a lukewarm Church a lukewarm individual a lukewarm family a lukewarm home amen something amen is not right they had not received not the love of the truth that they might be saved see amen see you got to receive a love for the truth not just having truth is going to save you you got to be passionate about it you got to love it enthus see amen uh uh for this cause God shall send them strong delusion see that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness see so iniquity is abounding the people have rejected truth amen and if there's ever an age that iniquity is now coming and abounding and growing and and maturing it is now can you say man see so we we can truly say that iniquity is abounding Amen in the homes of the world in science in in in politics and Technology Amen in education in the church iniquity is abounding ain't that right amen look look at this uh scripture the Bible talks about those who are workers of iniquity amen uh Jesus speaking in Luke 13:24 strive to enter in at the Straight Gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able to why they ain't been able to overcome hello they will seek to enter in and shall not be able when Once the Master of the House has risen up and have shut the door and has have shut to the door and you began to stand without and and to knock at the door saying Lord Lord open unto us and you and he shall answer and say unto you I I know you not whence you are then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou Hast taught in our streets oh think of that in other words we know who you are we've been in your presence we are queen with you ain't that right so that is their their that that's their resume to him we've eaten and drunk in your pres we've gone the church we felt something and he shall say I tell you I know you not whence you are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity ain't that right Matthew 7:22 many will say unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity in other words brother Brown said these workers of iniquity are deceivers they come from that same Spirit opposing all that is of god called God Amen and and resisting and all these things see so this mystery of iniquity is the spirit of antichrist that started to ride in the first church age he as God sits in the temple of God calling himself god notice what brother brand said forgiving sins on Earth and that'll go on and iniquity shall abound and on can you say Amen see so so what is the danger in this Le oysan age the people having their sins forgiven by this mystery of iniquity this Antichrist spirit and not by God am amen can you say Amen this mystery of iniquity iniquity abounding and abounding amen and the people getting their sins forgiven by the spirit of iniquity now now notice Jesus gave the church he gave the church the power to remit sins um uh John 20 and 22 and when he had said this he breathed on them and Sith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are to retained ain't that right so this word remit means to forgive amen it it means to take away to remit is to take away see and and and and the Harlot Church claims to have power to remit sins and they do it notice brother BR and they do it they they claim to have the power to forgive to take sins away and they do it but they remit sins by their denominational power hello brother B said see look at their children every downa cut their hair painted up like clowns men out living with other men's wives flirting running around the street mix bathing everything else sure they forgive they remit sins in their own way but their fruit shows what it is hello Church see see not right for them no sir what do they do they wear shorts and cut their hair and wear their makeup Jesus said by their fruits you shall know they are known see the kind of seed that they are there is what it is see denominational seed gives denominational forgiveness and what has this mystery of iniquity have done it has produced a bunch of Le lukewarm leosa people hello that's right it's produced nothing but Hypocrites that do not see the need anymore to be fervent about the word of God any longer why they're okay pre hard at me I'll go somewhere else you got a smorgus board today church is just like going to restaurants you know I don't like this I'll just go somewhere else you understand what I'm saying M uh uh uh uh iniquity is is abounding abounding because there's a spirit of iniquity forgiving sins pardoning the people and what is this bunch of Le oysa doing brother brand said they're trying to bring on a millennium without repentance they're trying to bring world peace without repentance they're trying to bring back what what the church used to have without repentance that's can you say Amen see she claims power to forgive sins but you're not judged by your claims you're not known by your claims you're known by your Works how could she forgive sin look at her look at her she's anti word right in her teaching in her Worship in her Living anti- Word and then she's stands as the one to forgive the sins a it's okay you're all right you just keep go ahead Jesus loves you brother Bram said when Jesus did the same thing see he said you know they said he said condemn me show me where I disbelieve the word see she claims power to forgive sins but that only that comes only by the word amen everybody say that only comes by the word forgiveness only comes by the word see that's right God only can forgive sins that right didn't those Pharisees say that was see he said what was the matter with the with the blind bunch of Hypocrites see why because they didn't see that was the word standing with him he is the word glory to God that's the reason he could forgive sins he was God the word manifest another place he see the Holy Spirit Bears record of the predestinated gift that the church claims she has what by watering the word punctuating the word with an amen when it said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen when it says these other things amen that's it amen to everything it punctuates the word and God predestinated the gift to come to remit sins but it was given to the spirit filled word body cu the word can only forgive sins because the word is God yes sir you see how important it is and why we're blessed to have the word it's not sugarcoated but it just tells us where it's at amen but there's a blood in that word yes sir to forgive sins amen amen you love him amen so this false Church in closing the false Church claims to speak for God but she is no longer the God's mouthpiece see he said I'll spew you out God has spewed her out so she is no longer God's voice to the world but his voice is now in the bride Amen in the Overcomer can you say amen God still got a voice to this world and it's in the Overcomer amen so who is this bride it's the Overcomer what does she do she overcomes the age overcomes The Temptations of the age overcomes every denominational critic overcomes the popular sins of the age I'm reading what brother Bram says about overcoming overcomes the deception of the age I am rich and I have need of nothing I have see oh I'm all this and all this see and I'm I'm the bride see I'm this I have need of nothing and don't know that you are naked and blind see what does she do she overcomes all the worldly things of this age amen can she do it yes she can do it the Bible says she hath made herself ready she will stand as an overcomer withstanding every spirit in this age she will amen 2 Timothy 3:1 it says and know this also that in the last days in the last days and other words the expression in the last days refers to the time immediately preceding the Rapture of the church perilous times shall come see perilous times I looked up this word times it's it's a critical epic uh uh uh making period for ordained of God when all that has been slowly and often without a observation ripening through long ages is now mature and comes to the birth in Grand decisive events the last times perilous times can you say Amen so what started as just a little seed is now ripen the seed of deception has come to maturity the seed of rebellion has come to maturity the seed of religion has come to its fullness ain't that right brother Braham said the false Vine came into full fru in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil-spirit church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where in lodged the fowls of the air and at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this be true then it must also be true that the bride church WIll mature and her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all cunning and diabolical uh uh Power diabolical power made up of political force physical force and demons of Darkness come against this True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever United can you say Amen do you love him if the musicians will come amen now think of it now we're living in a day where Isaiah 541 is being fulfilled more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife sayith the Lord Luke 168 Jesus said the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light Isaiah 5:21 woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and PR it in their own sight see so what is it speaking of the children of this world who are the children of the desolate ain't that right now we've talked about it before but notice Paul says perilous times or maybe Peter perilous times shall come the word perilous means dangerous it also means to lower to lower which comes from the idea of reducing strength so no wonder there is a great falling away in this age like never before because the people ain't got the strength to overcome they're too much in the world they're too much into this they're too much Le oosa you understand what I'm saying they they they've not kept their lamps trimmed they they've not kept the oil in their lamp you see they're not fervent they're not passionate about the word of of God and and their strength is being reduced there's no strength to overcome notice now they're not able to overcome worldliness they're not able to overcome the popular sin of the age they're not able to overcome anything see so now if you go back to 2 Timothy 2:5 men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors he high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and all of that having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away so you see why this world is headed to [Music] tribulation there's nothing to look for forward to in this age I know they keep prophesying about revivals and great things but a prophet said it ain't happening the next thing is tribulation but why what is the Tribulation it's God fulfilling his word notice here in Isaiah 13 and 9 through 11 behold the day of the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the Sinners thereof out of it for the stars of Heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in is gone forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine and I will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of The Proud to cease and will lay low the hotess of the terrible can you say Amen so what is that Overcomer brother Bram said the Overcomer is the man that really sits down and throws aside everything else besides the word throws aside everything else the Overcomer says I don't care how I feel the word says this I don't care what other people say or do the word says this I don't care what the doctor says the word says this I don't care what denominations say the word says this right I don't care what looks to be right the word says this I don't care if everybody else is doing it the word says this see that's the Overcomer not going with the the current but standing strong with Bible conviction can you say Amen one more quote brother Bram said the word has to come to pass it's God's word plant it in your heart if you want to go in a Rapture if you want to be Christians genuine Christians place this word as I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet and the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed don't you let some educated Theologian out here try to pump it out of you don't you let him spray you with that carnal science and knowledge and education you believe God can you say man
