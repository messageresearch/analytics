look to the Lord tonight truly we thank you Lord that we come into your house we gathered in your name we're thankful Lord that we have at least some understanding now Under the Umbrella of this message and what the true name of the god is the Lord Jesus Christ not titles but name and so many wonderful Revelations father we we understand that we didn't know back in the Pentecostal days in the year even the early days of the message how that the message has certainly been unfolded to us and Revelation is is getting greater and greater and as the prophet said we don't put a period there but we put a comma in whatever God will unfold to us and reveal to us according to your word and we're we're happy to be part of that end time word we thank you Lord that we could come to church again we still have the the freedom and the privilege to come and worship you we thank the Lord that you have again sent us a prophet that we have understanding of how to worship and and God's chosen place of worship and so many so many wonderful things we just give you praise now we look to you on behalf of these requests Lord I got a text from one of the brothers and happy valleys my sister Erica she had to go to the ER and she's it really recent really needs a touch from you she's fought that condition and having what they found in her brain now probably perhaps came from her lungs but God you're still an ever-present help in a time of need Lord you just said Ask believe and don't doubt you can have whatever things you desire God give us that Faith to believe for our sister Lord drop your faith down with our faith that'll make you a perfect faith that we can believe perhaps in behalf that you would touch her in Ron Peterson's daughter she was requested several months ago and she has cancer in fighting that and Lord God we know that as a prophet taught us not even to fear cancer but Lord faith can overcome so we just give us Faith the prayer to help to believe for her Lord in her condition and brother Ron Spencer and the different ones and the other requests four or five requests that was made known you know each one and I pray that you'll just touch brother barn and give him strength Lord whenever he might return back home or wherever he might go next you know all about it we just commit that into your hands and my brother Andrews he preaches the word of God Lord let it be ever present water from the Rock and spiritual food and due season and Lord let it be a present-day truth and whatever you've laid on his heart Lord it be edifying to the body of Christ for after

Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here this afternoon father I know that Lord they've not come here tonight without opposition but father some of them had to fight over spirits of sickness spirits of discouragement Lord father some have driven many hours to be here this evening but lord they're here because there's a deep calling to the Deep lord they're here because they're not here just to take up space or to be religious but father there is a world that is in another dimension but lord it's a perfect world and it's called into their hearts and they can't remain at ease in time they want to draw closer to you Lord so father as they come here tonight push Beyond Spirits push Beyond tiredness Lord to be here I invite you to come into this building by the power of your

we bind the hand of Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we invite you to come you heal our sick Lord I know there's some here in the building Lord's suffering some at home different places listening by the way of Internet suffering in their bodies I pray oh God that you would Lord just Minister them a healing touch Lord even now father as they're hearing the word Lord May the May the pain whatever the symptoms may be may they leave in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and father whatever you have on your heart for this meeting tonight we'll be sure to yield ourselves into your hands and say Lord have your way Among Us for it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the believer says a man and amen The Book of Matthew the 11th chapter we want to look in the first verse of Matthew 11. Jesus here is speaking he says and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed fence to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another so he's asking questions concerning the Vindication of the Messiah he said are we are you he that should come or do we look for another but Jesus answered and said to them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight how many believes that's happened in this hour the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them now notice the next words of Jesus and blessed somebody say blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me amen blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now I also want to look in the Book of Luke the 17th chapter and read two verses there and we'll give you our subject tonight and let you be seated uh Luke the 17th chapter in the first verse I have been speaking to you a little bit here on the heavenlies and the Lord just totally changed my direction uh last night so we're gonna just follow him if that's okay amen here in Luke 17 Christ is teaching uh the church to avoid occasions of offense and in the first verse it said then said he unto his disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come but woe unto them through whom they come for it was better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea then he should offend one of these little ones amen we asked the Lord this evening to add the blessing unto the reading of his word is you can have your seats here this afternoon amen how many uh thanks God for the reading of the word of God amen we are thankful tonight to be in the service of the Lord I I want to tonight if I can for just a few moments speak to you here and if I title this sermon I want to speak to you on he is right on schedule he is right on schedule when I speak of this he I want to go ahead and identify I'm speaking of God that God is right on schedule how many will agree with me tonight that God is an end time on time every time God Amen he's always on time he's always in time and every time he's right on time so amen I want to say this maybe just to lay a foundation read a few statements to you amen I'll say it like this God is always on time and the message at Thy word 51 but remember said on the scripture tonight Jesus was trying to teach the Apostle Peter how to take his word now he sometimes when you're absolutely at the end of the Rope that's when he speaks to you see as I was speaking this afternoon to the Hebrew children they were right in the fiery furnace before the Lord ever moved a hand but he's always on time now to the human mind he should have moved before they went in the fire to the human mind amen he should have moved before they ever went in there at bound hand and foot amen but to God Amen his thoughts are not our thoughts and our thoughts are not his thoughts amen he did he declares the mysterious works of his word by his own power amen God is always on time in the message the junction of time 56 he said God always is on time sometimes amen we are a little bit late or a little fake and a little different that does that's always done for a purpose amen but God is always on time with his message amen and so today I believe that we're facing a great something that the church should know and understand we ought to know what all this is about and find it in God's word for I believe that if it isn't in the word then I'm just a little doubtful of it but if God's word speaks of him amen then God no matter how indifferent it might seem to our custom of teaching and meant it's God working out his word many times it's contrary to our way of thinking or maybe the way we have been taught to think but we have to recognize the omnipotence of God when it's performed before us amen we have to recognize the omnipotence of God when it is performed before us meanest man I know he said well I'm so glad that there is one on time amen and that's God and his message it's always on time he said notice we find out they had to be ready and prepared to go in how did it happen he said we see him now sitting in the room unwashed unanointed not kissed welcome sitting in the Cardinal's house but I want to ask you something he said what happened to that foot wash funky where was he at how did he bypass that what an opportunity and he missed it oh I believe if I had been there and nobody was a coming I would have been on a stepladder somewhere watching for him to come amen see the honor of washing his feet but somehow he just bypassed him and let him go he said where was the man with the anoint you know but somehow he was there and was dirty he said it kills me to say it but Jesus with dirty feet you know the Frenchman calls him Jesus he said amen with dirty feet nobody cared enough to wash his feet he said what's that got to do with us brother Branham he's come and he was on time amen amen he didn't get his feet washed because he was late amen he didn't get his feet washed because they didn't recognize who he was when he come in the building he said and he's always on time he's never late he said and we'll call for a Revival and comes and somebody starts to praise the Lord or we hey man he's put out the church see he's never welcome amen it's Jesus with dirty feet amen I I want to read you one more in Super Signs 63 he said God know the end from the beginning how many agrees that God knows the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that it would work out just to his glory and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes your goals amen God is making everything the clock is ticking exactly on time amen I know it's a bit it's a it's a difficult time I know there's more pressure than you've ever faced in your life amen but let me remind you tonight that our God is not a slack God Amen Our God does not show up sometimes and shot show up other times amen but whenever he makes a promise to be with us he said I will be with you even in You Until the End of the Age amen and listen we're closer Home than we've ever been before amen this is not the time to let depression this is not the time to let nervousness and anxiety Amen in the time 1000 tribulations and disappointments of our life amen back us off of the position that God has given us amen our God is still with us amen if we're in the valley he's with us if we're on the mountain he's with us if we're sick he is with us if for well he is with us amen if we are broke or we are rich it makes no difference amen our God is with us he's with us on Wednesday he's with us on Sunday amen he's with us on Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and Saturday amen because he's God and he will not fail his believing children God is exactly on time God is with us God is making everything work out amen that his glory will be seen among his people he said sometimes we get weary and we get upset have you ever been there amen we get weary and we get upset and we get hastily and we think oh we must do this or we must do that amen but you just remember God's will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire amen but by his foreknowledge see amen he knew who would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything somebody say everything he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's it taken away amen he can foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he knew that we would live in this day he knew we would and he had plans for this day he had plans for every day and never has one of his plans ever failed he is always on time amen well in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word amen be established can I get a witness here tonight they can witness that God is on time he is in time every time it doesn't matter if it's the Red Sea he's on time it doesn't matter if it's the Lion's Den he's on time it doesn't matter if it's the whale's belly and Jonah's day he is on time because he's God and he refuses to be reduced from being God by the situations and the trials of your life he will be there always because he's God and he's always on time now amen when you read that Matthew 11 chapter what I have just read to you is what a prophet called amen the Forgotten beatitude but can I see it you like this thank God for a prophet who rediscovered what had been forgotten thank God for a prophet that rediscovered what had been forgotten he says here in paragraph six of the Forgotten beatitude he said we want to read Matthew 11 6 he said now I'm going to call this subject amen the forgotten the attitude amen now we are all acquainted with the Beatitudes how many is acquainted with the Beatitudes they're in the Book of Matthew in the fifth chapter amen Jesus taught the Beatitudes when he'd taken the people and he went upon the mountain just before the beginning amen or just as his ministry will start him see when he went up there and began to teach he said see he became their leader and he went up there and taught them to the Beatitudes and said now you've heard them say of old time amen but I say unto you now when he said you've heard them say of old time he was actually referring back to Moses in the book of Deuteronomy the 18th chapter when he said the Lord your God will raise up a prophet unto thee Amen in the midst of thee of thy Brethren liken unto me and unto him shall ye herk amen so Moses were speaking of the coming of Jesus and when Jesus come on the scene he was speaking back of what Moses prophesied in other words Moses was saying he's coming and when Jesus come on the scene he could say I am what Moses said was coming brother man like this he said Moses was a type of Jesus he said Jesus was an antidype of Moses he said Moses was a prophet he was a lawgiver he was a kind of like a king over the people in the wilderness with Israel he was born to prophet he was hid from Pharaoh just as Jesus was he and amen from the Roman Empire see his ministry and life amen just typed right along and Moses when he got the children of Israel in the wilderness amen he went up in the mountain and got the Commandments amen and then came down and began to teach the commandments so in other words Moses was not teaching them things that he was hatching out of the back part of his mind he was not teaching him things that he thought well maybe if I say this it'll help him amen but before Moses opened his mouth he went up on the mountain and received a message amen and come down and established in stone what God spoke to him lip to ear and Jesus before he moved into the position of a leadership amen he went up on the mountain and begin to teach the Beatitudes now amen don't make me preach by myself tonight amen but Moses amen went to the mountain and God for Revelation amen Paul went to the desert and got for Revelation and in the end time there was a man named William Marion Branham amen who found his way to the mountains of Arizona Amen in the desert and received the revelation of the word of God and the AIDS were living listen friends we ought to have a smile on our face tonight we ought to have an amen in our mouth we we ought to have a Hallelujah ringing in our soul amen our leader has come into position but he's not brought us into position amen by some legalistic beating and banging you around but he has brought you into leadership by the blessings of the revelation of the word and the age you're living amen he's on time amen I know there's a lot of pressure but he's on time amen when Jesus come in power what did he do he taught them the blessings of the word he went he went up on the mountain sat down and began to teach the people here's what he taught him brother Timmy taught him blessed are the parent heart amen for they shall see God he said blessed are the poor in spirit amen for theirs is the kingdom of God he said blessed are you when you are reviled and persecuted and made fun of and so forth amen for they persecuted the prophets which was before you amen so rejoice and be exceedingly glad amen because great is your reward in heaven amen Jesus was teaching the blessings amen upon the church and he called them the Beatitudes he said now Moses tap was a type of him and we're all acquainted with those types of what Moses and what Jesus was amen but this be attitude amen is on over in the 11th chapter and the sixth verse if you don't watch you'll read right over the top of it see and you won't get it it's wedged Amen in between other words but it's still of the attitude I say thank God for a dispensational prophet who could go through the Bible amen and find the things that the world had missed amen and rediscovered them come on what did he say he said I'm not out here amen just as a suspect her I am here as a prospector amen I am finding the golden nuggets and the word and I'm digging them out and I'm polishing them up and I'm presenting them to you amen as truths as blessings and you know when I say I say thank God forever Tafe we got thank God for every book we got thank God for every man of God preaching this message because they're not preaching legalism they're not preaching their ideas they are preaching the revelation of the Beatitudes listen and if they're preaching the message they're not telling you you're condemned they're telling you you're blessed if they're preaching the message amen they're saying blessed are the pure and hearts for they shall see God they're saying blessed are you that are reviled and revile not back against the revilers amen because your reward is in the heavens of Heavens listen friends we are not a bunch of church members women we are the pride of Jesus Christ who is following General Jesus and he's not leading Us by a rope and he's not moving Us by a whip amen but he's leading us and moving Us by the sovereignty of his own will and the age we're living in listen we're not about to help us people we are the Blessed people of the most high God if anybody got a righteous shout we gotta write a shout if anybody got a right to dance this ride's gonna write to dance she's been blessed beyond measure brother but I'll shout by myself we've been blessed beyond measure come on come on Mary hey man you didn't work yourself into this position amen God gave it to you amen you didn't earn your way into this position God gave it to you and you know what you got to do you got to accept what God gave you in the age that he sent it to you well glory to God somebody shout hallelujah you're not making yourself bride your bride by accepting what he sent in the age that you're living in it's a blessing upon you it's not a curse it's not a condemnation it's a blessing but it took a prophet to ReDiscover the blessing he said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me he said blessed are the pure in Hearts blessed are the peacemakers amen blessed are blessed are and way over here amen he slips this be attitude in again amen nearly six chapters later brother Branson he slips another beatitude in that would have been ignored had a prophet not come listen if a prophet had not come we would have every right to be living like a bunch of offended people without any reason to praise God but because God sent a prophet the coming of a prophet was the removing of the ability to live underneath the offenses of your family and the offenses of your first birth and the offenses of what somebody said or what somebody done God who is rich in Mercy amen a lot of profit to ReDiscover what I believe is the most powerful beatitude of the entire Beatitudes is blessed is he that can live in a world of offense but he does not become a product of the offensive world that he's living in but the spirit of God can raise him above the hurts it can raise him above the disappointments it can raise him above the trials and the situations that the devil tries to bury a Believer under oh yeah blessed is amen blessed is he blessed are you how don't you feel like preaching with me tonight amen you're a blessed man brother Amos Amen brother Joel you're a blessed man brother Jr you're a blessed man amen God allowed a prophet brother Daniel to find a blessing and pronounce it upon the church and say blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now this word offended it's a it's a very powerful word it means to put a stumbling block amen or an impediment in the way upon which another May trip and fall it means to offend listen this definition it means to entice to sin now what is sin sin is unbelief and the prophet Brethren preaches an entire sermon called the enticing spirits then can I tell you what enticing Spirits are they are spirits of offense enticing Spirits amen trying to lead the church amen to disbelieve the word of God that word offended means to cause a person to begin to distrust and to Desert one whom he ought to trusts and Obey it means to call to fall away it means to be offended in one it means to see in another what I disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority Amen to cause one I just picked it up so I'm gonna preach it amen I know there's a lot of people right now amen they're giving all their time to studying the message and trying to prove her brother Brandon made this mistake and he misquoted this and amen but I just want to put them I might as well preach I'm here and amen I just want to put them reprobates on notice and let them know there's not one thing you can come up with in this message that is going to cause me Amen to distrust the seventh angel amen listen you didn't vindicate him so you came and vindicating to me amen by The God Who is rich in Mercy amen that sent William ran him into this generation is the same God that met me and called me to preach the message and if he Vindicated him to me there ain't enough questions and essays and scientific researches that you can produce to change my teeth my faith is this this day this scripture is fulfilled Malachi 4 is fulfilled Revelation 10 is fulfilled Luke 17 30 is fulfilled and there ain't enough offenses from a bunch of unbelievers to back the bride off of the blessing that she has received in the age of she's living in amen I trust this message I trust the authority of this message I trust the authority of just saying what a prophet said and it means to see another when I disapprove of and what hinders me from acknowledging his authority it means to cause one to judge unfavorly amen or or misjudged now watch this Earth unjustly of another that word offended means since one who stumbles or whose foot gets entangled feels annoyed it means to cause one that is pleasure of a thing it means to make indignant it means to be displeased Amen to watch it means to be in now I say this indignation now when you look at this you realize that what we're seeing here is John's Ministry right and in charge Ministry can I say it to you like this John had a scriptural Ministry now he was one of the five comings of Elijah right we all know there's five comings Right There Was Elijah then there was Elisha then there was John the Baptist amen then there was Malachi 4 which we believe is William Branham according to malachiosaur amen then there was Revelation 11 which will be ma which will be John and Moses amen and they will take the message back to the 144 000. amen so when John come upon the Earth John come upon the earth born underneath a commission and that commission was amen introduce the Messiah listen John it don't matter what you got it don't matter what you do have amen it just matters that you fulfill the commission that I brought you up on the earth and Thaddeus introduced the Messiah so what did the Bible say in John 1 6 it says there was a man sent from God whose name was John this man come from God and his name was John now the Bible tells us that John amen bear record of Jesus as the light the truth see then the light Has Come Into Darkness amen and darkness comprehended it not amen so John with his commission all of a sudden he's got the greatest commission and brother Jordan that is you introduce the Messiah when he comes on the scene amen you will recognize him and you will begin to declare Messiah is here now but this man with his commission all of a sudden amen we find him in prison now think about this amen we find John in prison and the prophet said John had been placed in prison amen because of his ministry amen John was not in prison because he robbed the bank he was not in prison because he was selling dope amen he was in prison because of his ministry which was his commission and oh what a rugged fellow John was he really truly was the messenger because Jesus said amen he shall go before me and how when they called him he was perfectly like Elijah who his Spirit was anointed see John was the anointed Elijah of the New Testament let me just go and say this when they put John in prison it did not lessen his anointing amen of being the third coming of Elijah or the Fulfillment of the messiah's introduce her amen if John come on church and then the prison did not devalue the Commission in other words wherever you put John he would steal the prophet of God if you put him in the prison he was the prophet if you put him on the banks of the Jordan he was the prophet if you put him in the pulpit and there was Herod with his wife it was unlawful he was still the prophet because he was born with that commission and I might as well go ahead and say it amen sister Kim wherever you put this Pride amen she will be the bride if you put her in the hospital she's still the bride if you put her in the grave she'll still be the bride if you put her in prison she'll still be the bride there is no place you can put this bride that will reduce her from being what God called her and ordained her to be God called you to be victorious so you can be victorious in the school God called you to be victorious so you can be Victorious on your child because your commission cannot be listened by the condition of your life oh yeah and then what you're going through brother during it does not change what God commissioned you to be from before the foundation of the world then John was a rugged Man he was a Wilderness man he had and all of a sudden he goes from the freedom of the Wilderness Amen to the musty jail cell of a prison he goes from the freeness brother Terry of the Locust and the honey and then in doing this he pleased Amen to sitting in an old musty wet damp jail but you know what it did not change who he was it must have been a horrible experience for John man it been free all of a sudden amen he finds himself down in a little old musty dirty town perhaps dark in a dungeon somewhere because that life chest Bell was herodias had him thrown in there because he told him it wasn't right for Herod to take his brother Philip's wife and live with her he said see John was not a compromiser amen John was a man of God he said in John was one of those men that did not hold back any punches amen listen friends John amen knew if he said that it could put him in jail but it would still be bride he come on sir he would still be a prophet so what John could have done was John could have said in his office and said now let me let me let me find the politically correct way to go up there and say it ain't right for you to have that woman because if I say it the way God's given it to me to say they could put me in jail but John was not looking at his Earthly status amen and forfeiting his Heavenly status for his Earthly status but John knew amen if I say it and they cut my head off I'll still be a Son of God if I don't say it and they'd come on come on church if I don't say it amen I'll get corrected by God so either I get corrected by God or I just say it and take the Earthly lash of Correction and John was a man who was sent from God not to be a compromiser amen but to be a prophet of God let me just go and say this church and living God don't you back off of your position as the Bride of Jesus Christ for the fear of some pressure for the fear of somebody that won't lock you or somebody will say something about you listen brother Tim if they scandalize your name and they drag it through the mud when they get done you'll still have your name on the Lamb's Book of Life because you're position is not coming from their ordination of some man your position is coming from the foreknowledge of God well I feel good what was right to John was right what was wrong was wrong I hear the prophet say oh God we need more men like that today how many agrees man who will stand on real genuine convictions of the word of God speak it and don't hold your don't hold your peace speak it out now what was John he was a prophet and what did God like in His prophets to he likened His prophets unto Eagles and the prophet said there was John now in that little musty dirty tail with some dirty bread they probably follow him in once in a while he probably gotten thin and no way to read his Bible said like this and forgotten the attitude you can look the word up he calls it mustering amen John is mustering away his physical body is mustering away from what it used to be but his physical body it's not changing his Heavenly position I wish I was a preacher right now brother Tim his physical condition was not changing what was his position in the mind of God among church he was bound to where he couldn't read his Bible he was so low he couldn't even hardly lift his head but in the eyes of God brother Josiah he was still a prophet in the eyes of God he would still be announcer of the forerunning of the first coming of Christ listen people I know that sometimes our physical bodies will fill us and ailments will stack Upon Us amen but your gray hair amen does not reduce your position as a son or daughter of God Amen the sickness that is attach your body does not reduce the condition of you as a Son of God well I might as well preach amen I'm just going to use her brother during for a second amen Parkinson's does not diminish I'm in a position of a Son of God Parkinson's is not his identity it's not his position and I'm just going to go and say it brother during we thank you buddy amen we salute two I mean you didn't have to get in your car and drive 18 hours and sit in a tent and come to the meetings amen but you come because you're a gin Rock you're a lawyer of the Cross and he drove out here listen he'll go wherever he can to be in a meeting with his own body against him you know why because his Earthly condition is not devalue in his Heavenly position in the eyes of God he don't see Parkinson's he sees a Victorious Son of God and whatever you're going to tonight Church in the eyes of God he does not see your complex he sees you as a Victorious son and daughter of God he does not see you as a confused help us hopeless individual he sees you as a messiah Anointed with a purifier come on put us in the jail but we'll still be a believer put us in the hospital we'll still be a believer come on you can put brother walk in a nursing home and he'll still speak in tongues and he'll still shout and sing because the Earthly condition is not this value in his Heavenly position Hallelujah when I feel like you're out in church we're going through a lot but we're still Sons and Daughters of God we're still gonna make it I know you may think I ate 16 sticks a night a night and I might have but I think it's time to lift up her head I think it's time to remember that our Earthly condition is not changing Who We Are being in jail we might not be able to read our Bibles we might not be able to run the fields and Wilderness like we used to our eagle eyes might even get filmed over but the prophet of God said an eagle can go higher than any other bird the higher you get the further away you can see I'm on Church the higher you get the further away you can see remember so the higher you get more you can see therefore prophets in the bible were those Eagles who could soar way up above the congregation and find out what thus saith the Lord was then come back down and bring the news so in other words no wonder the devil Brother Sam I wanted John to muster away no wonder the devil wanted John take a lie to get filmed over no wonder the devil wanted John to get weak and get discouraged and get helpless and hopeless and lose the strength of his confession because if he got so low he couldn't go so high then the people would no longer be receiving the saithful Lord but God who is rich in Mercy provided a rock that John could put his quest to your eyes on and could beat the sleep out of his eyes and he could climb back up in the heavily oh God I feel like preaching he could climb back up in the heavilies and he could see what he was supposed to see John was not ordained to see the prison he was not ordained amen now come on church amen we're Eagles we're not ordained to look at our problems all the time we're not ordained to focus on this situation and focus on that situation come on I'm just going to preach amen I know there's a lot of different directions right now amen but whatever you do you focus on this message and you pursue it with every answer strengthen your body I don't care what a preacher says I don't care what a church does you remember that God sent a message and we're not to follow a man or to follow the voice of the seventh angel y'all know I'm telling you the truth and let me just go and say this there's a pressure Amen to accept and just accept and just accept but I'm just gonna go and take some Liberty and preach to you you are not under obligation to accept anything that is contrary to what a prophet tone in the age you're living in I don't care what the guy's name is I don't care what status he curse I don't care what his family name is if it's contrary to what William Marion Branham said you can cut my head off but I'll go down to bleed and say you stay with what a prophet said it'll lead you to the sicknesses it leads you through the disappointments it'll lead you to the Dark Nights come on church can I get a witness that this message is an on-time message it'll show up in the darkest of hours when you say preacher when does Jesus come along it's always the darkest of hours and then Jesus comes walking on the water and he changes the situation because he's an on-time God with this message [Music] I feel that devil pushing back and I will push back you stay with this message you stay with what a prophet said you say well brother Andrew I've got accepted no you don't come on Church okay you don't believe me go to Matthew 4. in the Bible the devil quoted Jesus the word and Jesus rejected it well he didn't reject the word he was the word he was rejecting the direction of the one who was presenting it come on church he would come it was the word but the way it was being presented was not in a pure unadulterated Direction so because Jesus was the word who could not mix the word with a with a perverted Direction he rejected Satan's proposition and stayed with the word come on Church of the Living God I think it's time we get some Backbone in us I think we forget about who's who and what position who holds and remember that a prophet went around the world seven times to bring us a message without confusion without babbling without babbling influence to bring us to a place of stability come on Church we're Eagles and we got to get our eyes off all the directions and we've got to get our eyes on what will lift us up in the heavens I'll tell you what a prophet said he said if we're Eagles and it's time for the Eagles to get to Flying higher if we're Eagles it's time for the Eagles to get to Flying higher what are you saying preacher I'm saying Revelation 4 1 after this I looked you need to take another look after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was it wherever Trump had talked with me which said come up hither military I've never called it like this today he said come up hither and I will show thee things I'm on church amen he said come up hither watch those words I brother Sean will show thee things amen which he must be here after look at this word show it means to expose to the eyes it means to give evidence or proof of a thing it means to show by words or teach so here the spirit is telling John notice the order I which is God will show thee which is the believer my goodness it's not you showing God your problems it's God showing you the promise concerning your problems now the Book of Revelation is a prophetic book right and the prophet shows us that that book was reserved amen for the sons of the last day which would be the sons that would come to adoption amen which would make those Sons a prophetic class of people then the proud of God said it's not the life story of John it's the revelation of Jesus Christ in the future Church ages to come he said the Greek word revelation is apocalypse say which means unveiling so this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of stature exposing it to the onlooker it's an uncovering it's a revealing that was previously hid now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his future works and the oncoming sevens Church ages so therefore the importance of Revelation by his Spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized that's why the prophet said pray for Revelation more than anything because if you ever get a revelation of your position that you hold in the mind of God in the situations of your Earthly condition will never back you all for the revelation of who you are in the mind of God what are you saying preacher I'm saying that God Amen is known by spiritual somebody say spiritual divine revelation I say this we should expect Revelation listen I know it's just Wednesday night amen but have I got any inspectors have I got any expectors here tonight have I got anybody that says it may be Wednesday amen but I'm still expecting a revelation listen friends we can tell God God I come for revelation God I don't want to leave here with just a sermon I don't want to leave here with just a few songs I want to leave you with a revelation you know what we can pray when we come to those doors we can pray God show yourself to me all right come on no other age could pray that but this age can every other Age come to church and they looked at the word amen with a veil over the word but in this age the Mighty God has been unveiled before us then we can look at the word and not look at it as just somebody that sees a veil over something desirable to see but we can look at it and we can see amen what is behind the veil and there's joy behind the veil there's healing behind the veil there's Victory and power there's power and deliverance and a miracle and an answer and it's behind the veil if you come to not expecting to see the Lord in his work God will show you himself and will give you such a peace listen I propose to you you don't have to leave here nervous you don't have to leave her confused you don't have to leave here under the bondage amen of anxiety or nervousness or depression or complexes listen I'm going to take a sword out right now Satan I a jury thee in the name of Jesus Christ thou demon of service problems without demon of depression I rebuke you and command you to take your hands off of the church of living God unless we entail into the Revelation or rise in this hour let God arise and his enemies be scattered we ain't got to live tore up we ain't got to live all confused biting our fingernails popping pills if you will believe then just be faithful with the little things and God will show you the great things what do you saying preacher I'm saying it's time to get up higher we'll say Well when God comes he will show us things what about John 16 13. how many when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come look at this word show it means to report it means to bring back Tidings it means to rehearse I ain't got time to preach there amen when when when John said it in Revelation 4 he said I would expose to the onlooker by words and I will teach them and by teaching them I will show them things which must be Hereafter when Jesus spoke in the Book of John and said he will show you thanks to come he said in other words brother Brown said to God 62 he said other words he'll be the one somebody say the one oh say it like you're preacher with me he'll be the one he'll be the one that will reveal the thing you see so there'll be one revealer come on church and there'll be one bride receiving brother Sean what the revealer is exposing to the owner listen church amen there's been churches churches and there's been Brides brides but there's got to come one who will be bone of his bone Brother Sam shall be power of his power shall be the life of his life and a prophet walked off the scene brother Judah and said she is him among church it was not just the unveiling of the bridegroom it was the revealing of the Bride who would look at the bridegroom and would not just see him through a glass darken she would not just see him through the eyes of some denomination but she would see him as the Mighty God she would see him as the Everlasting father she would see him as the spirit of truth that has come I wish I had a whole service on that the spirit of Truth has come somebody tell you it's coming you can look at him and say you're a liar he's come the spirit of Truth is come things once hard to understand is now made plain through the astronaut do you now believe 52 Battle Creek Michigan now the world take the word and scrum it all up and I like that word scrum they'll scrum it all up thank God for a prophet right these theological seminaries and teach this philosophy and so forth in Psychology and theory and so forth and they might do that but yet one thing sure we have the Holy Spirit as a Divine witness and if that is truly the Holy Spirit then it Bears record of Christ and Christ in the spirit form come on church we no longer brother Bob have to put our put our blinders on and follow some man in his adoption ideas we no longer have to put our blinders on and follow some direction about forgives or some direction about this or some direction about the seventh seal the spirit of Truth has come into the church to Open the Eyes of the Eagles brother Terry there's a stepladder in the house of God it's time to climb up and look at things the way the spirit of Truth has shown you to look the eyes of some man you'll sit there helpless hopeless defeated and praying you go home and just die in your sleep but if you'll climb up and look to the eyes of the spirit of truth that has come into this generation it will break the crust off of your eyes yes sir and you will see him the same here on Earth in spirit form Until the End of the Age I love this brother Sean he will show you things to come he will rehearse or repeat what's over there when the spirit of truth comes brother dear and he will rehearse to you what he saw over there he will go beyond the curtain of time and brother Terry he will come back and he will make an entire sermon called be on the curtain of time he will get called up in the consolation of seven angels in another dimension and he will see the revelation of the Seven Seals and he will be commissioned in the desert to return back to Jeffersonville and preach the Revelation and when he comes back he will rehearse to you what the angel of God stepped into his room seven days in a row and revealed to him concerning the word in the age you're living I say oh God bring these things to our remembrance come on let's forget the prison let's forget the offenses let's forget the situations and remember the things of God he said Jesus Christ the son of God God's provided sacrifice he's God's Everlasting Eternal provided sacrifice it's provided for your sin it's provided for your healing it's provided for your freedom it's provided for your joy it's provided for your peace it's every attribute that Jesus died for he come to rid sin amen so you could receive it what are you saying preacher can I have a few more minutes I'm saying the Holy Spirit does not change the trend come on Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will show you things I've taught you I've said to you and he will show you things that is to come see our human part gets ourselves all wound up in different things and groups of men get together and votes on this and that and this is what throws us off the line he said see well this was for another day no he is the same yesterday today and forever and all somebody say all all the word is inspired all of it see then the Holy Ghost is the prophet when the Holy Ghost has come he will make those things live out right to the promise when he the spirit of Truth has come I I know I've taken a detour but I'm going back to the Forgotten be attitude okay when he the spirit of Truth has come he will live out his nature through you to the promise that's a mouthful church he will live out through you his nature to the promise in other words you'll walk like Jesus you'll talk like Jesus brother Kevin you'll love like Jesus will forgive like Jesus will be just like Jesus because the spirit of Truth which comes from Jesus has come into the church to live itself out to the promise he said the continuity of God's word God's promise God's spirit we're living in the hour We're watching the unfolding amen of the Prophecies of the age coming to pass it's a great time we're living the Holy Spirit was to show us things that is to come as the devil ever beat you up over the evidence of the Holy Ghost is anybody it's not a trick question he's beat us all up over the evidence Holy Ghost but a Prophet come in this age and he rehearsed to us what he heard from the other side and said the evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word he who can believe that the spirit of Truth is coming to this age the people of today is choosing a modern denomination what does it do it only reflects their poor understanding of the word now come on don't get mad at me but people that choose little side side messages around this message only proves their poor understanding of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10. come on don't get mad at me let's preach amen amen people get up and say well you know I think we got some answers but I think we need to preach Christ it only reflects their poor understanding of the message of the hour well they say you know what amen I don't think we need to quote brother random well we see that you're understanding is poorly given well glory to God I might need bodyguards time I get done I'm saying well you know everybody got to go this direction cause this is the brown s he had contrary to what a prophet talk I have obligation to God to say I do not have to follow your poor understanding of what the bride's Revival is I do not have to follow some man's poor understanding of preaching when the prophet's saying I have been liberated by the receiving of the spirit of truth I have been given eyes to see what has been veiled behind the cover has been ripped off in this age and I'm feeding upon the true of Thoroughly of Vindicated word in the time and season I'm living now amen I know I'm way off my subject but let me get back to it real quick he's right on schedule he's right on schedule amen God works by time in a season can you agree in Ecclesiastes 3 1 through everything somebody say everything there is a season there is a time to every purpose under the heaven remember said Jesus told his disciples I knew you before the foundation of the world before the world ever began all things was made and ordained there we are just working according to the schedule that's a powerful quote brother during all things were ordained and made there we are just working according to the schedule a schedule is a very important thing right amen all of our lives right here tonight are operated off of a schedule see if the plans or scheduled changes then so many things can be disturbed amen not now don't believe me just go to the airport and let one schedule change and tickets you've had I remember I mean one time Dave salad and I was going to Poland and on the way over there we mystify it and when we got to the airport to fly back home we didn't have no flights so because we missed one flight they took the liberty to cancel all of our flights and we had to rebook all of our flights back home see because the schedule is very important I think it's a powerful thing that when Jesus came on the earth amen he was subject to a schedule but it was not the schedule of the Pharisees it was not the schedule of this agencies he was subject to the schedule which is the will of the father he said I can say unto you the son of man can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever things he do with these also doeth the son likewise in John 5 30 he said I could have my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which has sent me then this harmony is to exist between the groom and the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never announced it therefore nothing can harm her not even death see now watch this humans then we're all humans right humans have a tendency Amen to rush God and get ahead of God's schedule out are you with me now amen amen humans have a tendency Amen to rush God and get ahead of God's schedule I love what Romans 8 28 says we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to our purpose according to the church's purpose according to a group of man's purpose according to his purpose so brother Terry God's schedule is his word and his word is perfect therefore his timing is perfect now you know what a schedule is amen it means to arrange or to plan an event to take place at a particular time if you look at John's life amen God had a schedule for John's life before John's mother even consumed him or conceived her conceived him in her womb amen John was dead in the womb of Elizabeth but when he heard the name Jesus amen he leaped in his mother's womb therefore brother Graham said John was born full of the Holy Ghost at nine years old no education he went into the Wilderness as a man called of God and was a Woodsman amen now watch this he was greater than all the prophets you say why was he the greatest because the prophets and other prophets spoke of the Messiah but John introduced him all other prophets amen I hate dashes but it's getting cold up here and amen all other prophets said this is Messiah coming this is Messiah coming but when John come on the scene he said this is Messiah here in other words brother Terry he said my Ministry is to declare him he is here Amen in Matthew the third chapter you'll see that John at 30 years old begins to preach the coming of the Messiah very strong he said he was going to he was going to have a fan in his hand he said I'll know the Messiah when I see him but when trouble set in I'm preaching to you now when troubles when trouble set in amen Jesus come and sold the Messiah that he was the Messiah amen when then something went wrong and God had introduced the Messiah with the Messiah having a fan in his hand he was going to burn up a chance but he found out the works of Jesus he was meek and lowly so it worried him when did John get worried when trouble began to set in when do we get worried when trouble begins to set in he said but watch amen he didn't know what to say he thought somebody said he thought he thought amen now oh my there's something wrong here somewhere it seemed he had believed the wrong thing do you realize you never questioned this message till you get in trouble you never questioned God positionally placing you in a church or in the body of Christ until little trouble sets in upon you amen and then all of a sudden amen am I supposed to be here have I believed the right thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many times we think too that it isn't working right but it's working right as long as we know he is here come on church I need some help here for a second as long as we know he is here everything is working out brother son if he's not here we might as well close the doors turn off the lights and board up for Windows but if he is here it doesn't matter who else who says who likes who don't if he is here he will walk on the face of the conditions and he will push back the devil and his children receive a blessing in the face of the devil it don't matter listen you say preacher I'm going through a lot can you say these words with me he's here brother Andrew it's getting pretty hard can you say these words with me he's here to Kim and her powerful words he's here I know them are simple words but it's a reality he's here and if he is here maybe it ain't working according to the way we thought think it ought to work out amen but it's working according to the way the word of God wants you to work now I just gotta I gotta I gotta barrel down here and preach to you for a second in John in Matthew 11 John asked two questions you know what those questions were or thou he that should come or do we look for another do you realize Satan by questioning is trying to move people from belief to disbelief so we find out there that the devil tries to make the people disbelieved so the devil was trying to get John to disbelieve he was the Messiah brother brother during when John was running through the fields eating the locusts eating the honey or they must default never crossed his mind is this he or do we look for another when he was climbing the trees Jordan and brother brother Shawn he was doing whatever he wanted to do wild and free he never had a question is he the Messiah but for very minute he got put in the prison for the ministry God called him to was the very minute that old filthy trespassing devil climbed into John's mind and began to plant questions of is this the Messiah or do we look for another one to come could I have been wrong is he really the right one I know the sign was right I see the mess sign but this meek and lowly all this I don't get it I can't figure it up I can't make ends can you hear a preacher's Heart Tonight brother bam says you're not supposed to make ends meet [Music] and shout hallelujah oh yeah you're not supposed to make ends meet what did the Bible say trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding what did Paul say he said we walk by faith and not by sight remember I said if I could tell you the whole thing and you know it and all then it would no longer be Faith anything I can explain to you is not Faith by faith are you saved by faith are you healed you just believe it even though you can't explain it come on church I know I don't need to preach salvation here tonight because y'all are saved I know some of y'all need healing so I'm preaching healing but I'm going to take a I'm going to take a sword to a devil and you can sit there and watch me if you want to it's a devil that says we're not going to make it with the same Faith you believe that you're saved by the same face you believe you're healed by the same Faith you believe that your children are going to be saved by it's the same Faith you need to reach over and pick up and put aside in that Devil's face and say by faith I've already made it therefore I'm not going to make it I've already made it the same Faith you believed when you were sick in the hospital it's the same Faith you need to use right now and say I still believe God is with us I still believe God is for us somebody shout hallelujah let's served the same Faith now watch this the part of God said when John was in prison he never Oh my he never said you know what you take John can I preach to you now can I preach to you he never said brother Tim you take John a book on how to be happy in jail brother Amos he never sent him a book on how to behave himself in jail you know what within disciples come and they said John wants to know Roshan can have a few minutes he said John wants to know are you the one who does he look for another one remember said Jesus just looked at him for the nerd and said just go and stay till after the meeting he said after the meeting he said when the service was over he said those two disciples went back to meet John and said this amen go tell John the lame walk the blind sea the death here that all comes to the meeting is poor but the Poor People's gospel gospel preaching come on Church what did those disciples do they reported back to John in the prison well if they saw the Spirit of Truth do yeah I'm only shall Hallelujah and tell John not to be scared and Hallelujah Mateo right there well John not to be scared

schedule don't you pay attention to anything else gonna I bring this home as Believers sometimes we find ourselves in the same prison John found himself in but as I said before the president never lessened John can I say it to you like this John was in it was in a physical Dungey dirty damp dark jail but brother Amos greater than that he was in a prison of offense you say preacher what is that prison of the fence things did not turn out the way John thought things would turn out I'm prepared to plow here for a second closing our thoughts are not God's thoughts John thought well I've introduced a messiah that had had a fan in his hand and he's over kissing babies and over there setting them on their knees and over here meek and lowly there's something's wrong somewhere John become dismayed like many of us do he said we see things going on that isn't what we think is just right we become dismayed now listen church I'm preaching to you as a human two humans take your Halos off get mad at me if you want to but take your Halos off we get dismayed but don't be wary it'll be all right the devil got a hold of him in there and the devil fault now I've got him in jail I've thrown him in jail I'll rough him up right good while he's in here God isn't using him right now I've got him where I want him all cased up is equal I can't see I'll just make him wish he had never preached the gospel come on Church how quick in the prison of a fence did John trade off the fault of this is the Messiah this is the one to come and brother Terry he received the thoughts of the devil that I wish I had never even preached the gospel he said that's the way he does many and there's many a good man in the same shape today that's exactly right we think it ain't working right but it is working right everything's all right come on church amen everything is all right I said everything is all right I said everything is all right I said I know you may be in a dirty damn prison but everything gonna be all right the spirit of Truth has come he's come across he's already been on the other side of your child he's already been on the other side of the prison's hell he knows it's gonna be okay you got to receive the spirit of Truth and look at it the way he's revealed it to look at John oh my John was offended it now I'm going to deliver this and I'm done foreign said there's more people offended in Jesus than any other person that lived on the Earth they get offended too quick but Jesus in this misplaced beatitude slipped over there so we could get it tonight and he said these words blessed is he who has not offended to me don't be offended in me no matter what takes place everything's working right on schedule God I wish I could preach right now just go ahead and believe it that's all everything's all right just go ahead and believe it can I preach something to you God show you something Jesus never rebuked John Quinn come on church when John said the worst thing he could say to Jesus Jesus brother Duren turned around and said the greatest thing he could have said about John come on Jesus comes in town for a meeting and those two disciples run over there with John's questions pregnated by the devil's thoughts and says are you the Messiah or do we look for another one to come and Jesus never lost his temper well I might as well preach that Jesus never got all wadded up and said listen here you two wanna bees if you want about oh no Jesus said now listen y'all just have your seat right there and you enjoy the meeting and when the meeting's over you go tell John what you see and when Jesus manifested The Works of the father those two disciples took off from him come on Church Jesus had just received the worst things Jesus just received the worst words he could have received from his own Forerunner and his name was John and Jesus never turned around and said now you go tell John that oh sorry that oh sorry church member I wish I'd have never chose him I wish I'd never invest nothing in him Jesus said you go tell John and while the disciples was running to bring word to John Jesus turned around and took up for John and John was offended at Jesus but Jesus never let John's offenses change the way he thought about John come on church I close by saying this Jesus had ever right to say John I don't know this but Jesus turned around and he said some of y'all come out here and you're looking for this and you're looking for that amen but John there's never been a greater one than John the Baptist while John was still in prison for the whole church we ought to put our shop and shoes on right now because every single one of us oldest to youngest revelated to most illiterates from the preachers to the janitors to the kids we've everyone somewhere sometime God offended at God and we said God this should have went this way and that should have went that way and if this is the way this message is then why did you bring it in me

become offended this situation and all of a sudden we no longer act like we used to act we just act like Jesus and just say just wait till after the meeting just wait a few days or it's gonna be okay [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah what are you playing here tonight [Music] is over the victory is won and it's already done oh it's already done hallelujah it's already done oh praise the Lord the battle bat over the victory is one it's already done done one more time oh it's already done hallelujah it's already done oh praise the Lord the Battle Is Over the victory is one it's already done you know isn't it astounding as they play that Softly hitting it astounding that the prophet of God said the most offended person that people are offended at is Jesus well Ashanti didn't say the most defended people his wives or husbands or kids or grandchildren or her cousins or bosses or School teachers he said the most defended person is Jesus he said he's more offended that than anybody think about that the person you would think you would never be offended at is the one that a prophet identified is the one that receives the most negative treatment over situations but I got to thinking today bro Tim brother but I'm told about that woman overthink it was in Germany or Finland somewhere he said her baby died and he said she said now if you'll get brother Branham to come over here and pray for my baby said the Lord will heal that baby and he'll he'll live he said I believe it said they had the helicopters ready they had the military ready they had everything ready to fly me over there and he said all of a sudden I was praying and he said the Lord spoke to me and said call the woman tell her to bury the child it's of me and go on said to our old baby and I picked up the phone I called her the lady I said sis God spoke to me said have you buried the child it's of him we just got to go on and trust him about two years later brother they ran into that woman or received a letter from her but Tim that woman asked for the ram she said brother Brandon she said I believed if you would come and pray for that baby it'd raise up and live it was everything was and brother Brandon will you just tell me that I not have faith that I'm not have faith oh no sis he said you had great faith he said great faith he said yeah he said because God said no and you still trusted him [Music] God said no and you still God said no and for two years you've continued to serve him and praise him and bless his name and be good to his children and go to church you still testified God's A Healer friends I don't know about you but that's the kind of faith I want that much she had every reason to get all watered up at God unless God I'll tell you one thing see if I ever go back to see if I ever read my Bible again see if I ever say brother [Music] but great faith great faith knows that no matter what the conditions are God is right on time do you love him tonight God bless you friends we love you to love the Lord I pray something was said to bless you tonight I know it was simple but I pray it was a help I pray you can see that God sent a prophet in this age to find that misplaced the attitude dig it out and polish it up recorded 1961. go listen to it it's a powerful tape you love him tonight can you raise your hands and say I love you Lord I thank you for loving me I thank you for blessing me I thank you for delivering me I thank you for all you've done for me I think you've forgiven me a breakthrough I thank you for I thank you for speaking to me I thank you Lord for providing for me I thank you Lord for coming down and having a conference with me when I was all offended at you Lord I thank you Father I thank you Lord I Thank you for healing my babies when I was offended at you I thank you Lord for coming on the scene when that bill couldn't get paid and you come right in the midnight season and money was right there I thank you Lord and you knew I was offended at you you knew I was looking at the condition to the prison and you still done it anyhow so tonight God I want to take a few minutes well I don't know about you but I think we ought to take a few minutes right here and just give God a wave off and a hand clap of Praise or something I think we ought to thank him here tonight for providing Force when we didn't deserve it I think we ought to thank him for giving it to us when we didn't deserve it I think we ought to bless his name I think we ought to thank him for giving us a smile when we have every reason to frown I think we ought to thank him for giving us peace in the midst of the storm I think we ought to bless the god who is the god that's been more offended after anybody but he never let the offenses change the way he thought about it she never let the offenses Daniel change the way he looked at us he still looked at us as Overcomers he still called us bride he still called us Messiah he still called us an invincible Army he still called us

that there would be a shaking in the heavens the Earth and that which can be shaken will be shaken and that which remaineth a man that cannot be shaken will remain and I'm glad there's a people that's remaining tried and true proven but they're remaining a man is by the grace of God ain't that right the grace of God God has been so good to vindicate this message so thoroughly a man that we would not be shaken that we would be solid and remain the trials are going to come and go our health is going to come and go life just comes and goes everything just comes and goes that the Vindication of
