but uh a living reality amen amen and we can truly say he lives amen because we have experienced him amen the musicians can be dismissed it's good to just see everyone in the house of the Lord trust you're staying cool amen throughout the day it's been a little warm amen it uh good to have uh brother Quenton with us God bless you and we've uh certainly uh grown to love and appreciate him and his family amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Joshua amen the 14th chapter and good to have my mother-in-law amen and uh Suzanne and uh she's going to be leaving us um I guess Friday and uh but it's just been an honor to have her amen with us and pray that the Lord just gives her a safe trip amen and um talked to or um just communicated with brother shmaya today and they're doing uh doing well the babies's uh seems to be doing good um uh he weighs about 2 lb and 11 o now so he's gaining some weight so this is this is good and um sister paty she's home and uh they they uh wanted to keep her but uh she wanted to go home and felt like she would do better there so we want to keep her in our prayer and um that the Lord would just continue to help her um um recover and um and I believe God is able to do that amen and so uh I believe in the power of prayer amen we certainly need one another needing each other's prayers don't we uh another thing we want to um remember uh Brother David yansy and his family uh he's an older brother been pastoring in Georgia for uh many years I don't know how long but uh his son um has taken over uh in pastoring and uh but his other son uh Phillip I think is the son that is pastoring his name is Joseph yansy and uh but U his son Philip um passed away uh Sunday there at the church and um so it was unexpected and um Left Behind a daughter and a 13-year-old uh daughter and of course his wife and so we want to just pray for that family that the Lord will just uh and the church and everyone there involved um and um pray for them that the Lord would just Comfort their hearts and brother Andrew uh Glover actually was preaching there Sunday and um uh when that happened and so they've actually asked him to stay over and and uh minister at the memorial service and so we want to keep brother Andrew in prayer so Sister Mariah and I I think it's just put them all in a in a in a shock there and you kind of one the thing you you're talking to him and then he's gone and it was during the fellowship there at the fellowship hall and so I know they would appreciate the prayers before we go into the word though let's just bow our heads and talk to the Lord we certainly need the Lord um every day of our lives and especially tonight we just need him father Lord we come to you not in vain but we come knowing that you hear our prayer father and we we come Lord as the scripture bid us to come we come boldly father and before the throne of grace and father first of all we ask that you would just help this family the yansy family Lord Lord that have lost their loved one Lord we know what it is to lose father someone precious to us and how their hearts must be broken but I pray Lord that you would strengthen the family and the church father fathers the days ahead as they go through life with trying their to mend their heart hearts Lord and to cope without their daddy Lord uh husband son Lord friend we pray Lord that you would bless them God be with brother Andrew give him the wisdom and what to say father during this time father now we ask Lord that you would be with us tonight and you see what we would have to say father I pray Lord that you'd help me just get myself out of the way and that you would speak to our hearts Lord father for we need you and Lord I pray that your presence would just be felt here among us and that You' do a creative work within all of our hearts for truly lord it's our desire father to be more like you and to be draw closer to you oh God I pray that you would grant that now in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen and amen we're going to read the book of Joshua the uh 14th chapter and we're going to start at the seventh verse but it says 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from kades Baria to aspy out the land and I brought to him word again as it was in Mine Heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly follow the Lord my God and Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where upon thy feet have trotten shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God and now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he said these 40 and5 years even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo I am this day four score and 5 years old as yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me and my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day uh how the anakims uh were there and that the cities were great uh yeah great and fenced if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out out as the Lord said amen you can have your seats this evening and um I want to continue maybe on the the subject uh that we've talked about the past two Wednesdays I guess uh taking our inheritance by the word of our mouth and uh the word um to uh inherit the word inherit is to come into possession of or receive especially as a right or Divine portion and so we're we're this is what we're talking about is Caleb's inheritance God had promised him an inheritance and so he's he's wanting his inheritance you see you can only inherit that which has been given to you it has to be something given and uh to have an inheritance somebody has to leave you something uh and so uh the prophet in the uh adoption series uh tells us that God did leave us something he left you something and he he did that before the foundation of the world Amen and so he goes on uh uh to tell us what he left he said a name written on the book that when the lamb would be slain you would be recognized with it what an inheritance amen wrote our name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that we would be recognized with it and and well how did we get this inheritance and Paul would tell us there in the book of Ephesians uh first chapter the 11th verse and of course the book of Ephesians is the deals with the second um uh uh work of redemption uh there's two parts of redemption that's coming out and going into and so uh brother Bram talks about the Book of Joshua being the book of or book of Ephesians parallels with the Book of Joshua and uh dealing with our inheritance our placing and so Paul would tell us there in Ephesians 1:11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance say it with me I have obtained an inheritance amen and and and and notice being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so then this this this inheritance is Comes To Us by predestination you you did not get this inheritance by by uh turning a new Leaf you you did not uh uh brother Braham said you don't receive this inheritance because you walked uprightly amen the The Armenian Doctrine uh cannot bring you to your inheritance it it does not have that power to do that the only way you can get that inheritance is uh uh by predestination and so brother brandom says before he was po before he was God before he was savior before he was healer before he was all of this he predestinated he he put the Lamb's name on the book looked down through by his for knowledge and seen your name and put it in there too well what is it and after a while we come in the world born by sinful parents we walk around on the world you know and first thing you know that like that little hook nose Jew uh Paul see he was carrying out and the first thing something said here here here here here you know and you say oh Abba Father see you're going around as as we would use the Expression painting the town red and and uh living like a Helen and and doing whatever you were doing in in your life but something be to pull on you like it did with Paul and and and and surely all of us can experience that in some way shape or form we're not here because that we were uh made to do it amen there was something that was pulling uh uh us uh us amen calling us and so uh and and and and our response was Abba Father and so here we began to come see predestinated us to our inheritance in him which was predestinated to us see we inherited it before the foundation of the world see oh for his own purpose to work out his own good will to be a God and savior ain't that right so Caleb uh representing a a that that predestinated group amen if you want to find yourself in scripture then then then read the book of of of Caleb and or or of of of Joshua and and find out what Caleb was and what he did because he represents the the believer of this day who is following the end time leader uh uh Joshua ain't that right and so your inheritance is is is predestinated unto you and it's it's your legal right to lay claim to that inheritance amen and and we talked about last uh uh Wednesday about laying claim amen you have a right to lay claim to it as as as this is what Caleb was doing he he was laying claim to his inheritance he he wasn't worried about everybody else's inheritance he wanted what was rightfully his amen and he laid claim to it and that word again lay claim is to demand as being one's property to assert one's right or title to to say that you own it and so th this he wasn't going to bargain With the Enemy he wasn't there to to to mingle With the Enemy No he wanted his Mountain he wanted to possess it as his own amen and so I I think it is time to lay claim to our inheritance either either we're going to lay claim to it or or we're going to be out in the wanding in the wilderness one of the two but but I I don't believe that we can be sons of God in this day amen and not lay claim to our inheritance and so this is exactly what Caleb was doing he was so inspired by what God had told him amen uh uh uh uh uh through the the the mouth of a prophet he was so uh uh uh believing it and and and resting in what God had told him that his age didn't matter his his his ability whether whether he could defeat the giant or not defeat he was not looking at his stature he was not looking at his ability he just knew that God said he could have it and that's exactly the way he was doing it he was laying claim to it by the word of God ain't that right and so uh uh uh uh uh Caleb had entered the land through the ministry of Joshua and I believe that's what uh the the message is in this day is is uh the ministry of Joshua uh of course as i' I've told you I believe it is the ministry of Moses I believe it's the ministry of zerubabel I believe it's the ministry of Joshua I believe it's I believe that he fulfilled this message fulfills a lot of things amen but that Joshua Ministry amen represent the end time leader of this day and we know that that that you know brother BR said well the the Holy Ghost is Joshua and that's exactly right no man in his right mind or his natural Ministry his Natural State could lead a people into a supernatural land but God is the well the we we look at the prophet you know and and uh uh well brother Brandon said the Holy Ghost is the prophet amen the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Elijah in this day amen but it rested upon that seventh angel messenger ain't that right and and so uh uh and and this is why that that we we follow the message of brother Brandon is because it wasn't just a man that brought us the message of the hour this message is not brother brandom's message it's the angel of God's message it's it's God's message amen spoken through the prophet in this age can you say amen amen see so uh uh uh and so when he had came had entered the land amen uh under the ministry of Joshua Caleb told Joshua Now give me my Mountain remember that now he's telling he's reminding Joshua of the promise that was given to him and now he looking at Joshua as the leader amen and he said now Joshua give me my Mountain amen give me amen the Liberty to go possess the mountain it's time for it I'm in the land I I'm I'm here and I don't want to just dilly-dally around I I don't want to just wander around I'm not called to wander in the land of promise I'm called to to take what is rightfully mine ain't that right and and so it was Joshua amen that that gave him the Liberty under the ministry of Joshua amen Caleb had the Liberty to possess amen his inheritance amen you see the word was so real it was made so real to Caleb amen that all he could see was himself as the Overcomer whatever giant would come his way whatever obstacle would come his way it didn't matter to him the promise was so real to Caleb that he could see himself defeating that giant he could see himself conquering any W City he could see himself amen obtaining his inheritance can you say Amen see you Caleb had nothing to possess in the land of Egypt Israel had nothing to possess in the land of Egypt see the prophet said The Inheritance didn't lay in Egypt uh you look at numbers 34 And1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying command the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land of Canaan this is the land this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of Canaan with the Coast thereof amen see so so the inheritance didn't lay in Egypt The Inheritance amen did not lay in the wilderness amen you never find Caleb or or any of them possessing in in in in the wilderness because the inheritance didn't lay there amen the Bible says that they passed amen through the land of Esau but could not possess his land amen see uh Deuteronomy 2 and4 and Comm command thou the people saying you are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Israel see or uh children of Esau which dwell in sear uh and they shall be afraid of you and take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore meddle not with them don't mingle with them don't settle down there with them don't don't try to possess this land with them see because he says for I will not give you of their land no not so much a much as a foot breath because I have given Mount seir unto Saul for possession can you say Amen so see there there there was possession uh uh uh Esau had a possession amen but it did not belong to Caleb it did not belong to Israel it God had allowed them amen you see and and and there are people that are settling down in religion they're settling down into whatever amen but God has called us to go further God has called us to pursue amen higher things greater things than God can you sayen that's right see and so God didn't give them Esau's land for an inheritance we find that Israel even passed through the plains of Moab and that's where they met BAC and balum and and and all these things but see God did even though they passed through that land god did not give them that land for an inheritance they had to keep moving on God wanted them to keep moving can you say amen and I say it this way as the prophet would tell us our inheritance didn't lay in the land of justification and neither did it lay in the land of sanctification and neither did it lay in in the land of the new birth either we've had to keep moving on can you say amen amen but we find out that the Lutheran amen they they failed to move move on Amen they settled right there that that in that portion of justification they you know and and and the weslan settled in the land of sanctification and the Pentecostal amen settled in the land of restoration of the gifts and and all of these things now you know there's a lot of people or not a lot but there is a teaching going on that the new birth is is the the the the land of inheritance but that's not true amen because uh you know brother Brandon talks about it how that the Pentecostals thought that when they had received the new birth that they had arrived and and and uh he said but they did not receive the inheritance see even though the prophet said they were born into the family as a son they were born into the kingdom of God but they didn't receive the inheritance so which tells us that the inheritance or the New Birth is not your adoption ain't that what brother Bram said the new birth is not your adoption and so the inheritance lays in the land of adoption that's that's our inheritance ain't that right amen yes we've had to pass through justification but we didn't settle there we we we passed through sanctification but we didn't stop there we passed through the gifts and the tongues and and all of these things and and and but we didn't stop there there is an inheritance that God has given us as an El amen see so brother brandham says now people say well praise the Lord I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that settles it that seals me into the kingdom I'm a son and daughter of God he said that's true but that don't have nothing to do with your inheritance yet see he said in another place when the Pentecostal church and these people in the last days here that's beginning to find the new birth being born again they thought that settled it no sir you ups and downs and ins and outs and things like that God can't place you as a son see but when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay right amen one of these days God will call you out and set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that'll shake the nations with it see what I mean it's the adoption into the family amen another place brother brandom in his pray prayer he said we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in not with a new birth for we've receive that through Christ but you'll adopt your church then see then she'll be clothed in the power of the resurrected Lord another place he says your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing can you say Amen it's your placing see so then when we are born of the spirit of God born again see then then we are sons and and yes that is true but according to uh uh uh Ephesians 1:5 Paul says that we were predestinated unto adoption he said having predestinated us unto the adoption of children or Sons by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will see so now brother brandham said Paul Paul is speaking of The Last Day sons of God the sons of God in this last day there is a people amen sons of God that have been predestinated unto adoption amen yes they had to pass through this and they had to pass through sanctification justification amen the Pentecostal amen and and these things but they were predestinated Amen to inherit a land a promise amen and in inheritance amen see and so we we find that you're not here on Earth by accident there is a purpose amen for you being here ain't that right so now brother Brandon would say now in this in this age that we're now living at this age it's beyond Pentecost everybody say it's beyond Pentecost now now now you cannot deny Pentecost amen uh the Pentecostal experience you cannot just as much as you cannot deny justification sanctification you cannot deny p i I know a lot of people in the message are afraid of that word Pentecostal amen but there is a Pentecostal experience and it will make you act just like they did on the days of Acts Amen in the days of act on the day of Pentecost we believe in speaking in tongues we believe in the gifts we believe in Prophecy we believe in all these things amen but we believe in justification we believe in sanctification we believe in all of that us amen there is an inheritance can you say amen amen so we're not a people that deny what was there amen amen we're just moving on and not settling in the land that God never gave us to possess amen you see there's a land for you to settle down in ain't that right that's right so he says see it's beyond Pentecost Pentecost has settled itself into organizations and started faking whole lot about organization see amen see so in this age it tells us amen and there's several quotes where brother Brown said we're beyond the Pentecostal age we're Beyond Le oia or or we're in the bride age where it's seed time it's it's the shuck which is Pentecost has dried up and and all of these things which is telling us it's time to take our inheritance ain't that right we are living as we said so many time we're living in the book of Ephesians amen that's what we're living in as the bride of Christ see our inheritance is in the land of adoption we know what that promised land was to Israel amen uh uh it it was in that land amen that under the ministry of Joshua which was the ministry of Grace it was not a Ministry of legalism under Moses a Ministry of condemnation it was a Ministry of Grace and under that Ministry there was a positioning there was a placing there was a dividing of inheritance and Joshua under by inspiration placed them in the land where they belonged ain't that right see and brother Bram tells us he calls it the land of adoption amen you see it's the it's the adopted son that falls air to the inheritance amen inheritance can you say Amen inheritance is greater than just blessings amen You Can Dance you can shout you can speak in tongues you can do all them things and brother Bram calls that blessings amen but we're not talking about blessings we're talking about inheritance that you have been predestinated to and and you've got to fight every giant you got to fight everything that tries to hinder you and and claim claim what God has given you before the found of the world Amen so brother brandom says see adoption is a placing is placing a son see The Inheritance given you by predestination if it's given you by predestination then no wonder brother Brown tells us no one can take your place no one can take your place can you say Amen you can't look at somebody else and say well he's he's in my place no quit dreaming about somebody else quit wishing you were there in them and take what God has given you that's right that's right can you say amen that's right now if you you look uh Israel had been persecuted by by pharaoh and and had been in bondage for hundreds of years as as we know and they were deprived of worshiping the true and living God they they they were deprived of of of being what God had called them to be amen and they were held slaves uh uh under the the a strong Taskmaster amen but see God had made them a promise Amen in in his Bible or in his word and uh by the prophets the prophet said that he had give them a land see God remembered that God remembered his promise God knew there was a land waiting for them even though they were in bondage and getting whipped and and tormented amen and deprived of being uh uh what God had called them to be God remembered there's a land waiting for them amen and at a time he would deliver them and take them out of that land of bondage into a land uh of inheritance see and so so they they they they they were slaves there amen there was no inheriting in that land amen but when they entered into this land they they didn't go into that land to be slaves again they didn't go in that land to be tormented Again by the enemy they were now the possessor because they were now in the land of inheritance oh yes sir amen and and no doubt the enemy was stronger in that land than it was in that land for they were they were far more uh uh well you never find the Israel looking at the Egyptians saying we look as grasshoppers in their sight and we're we're as grasshoppers but when they come into this land of inheritance the enemy was so great so big so strong that they felt like they could not make it ain't that right but yet when they entered that land amen there was a people like Caleb that drove back the enemy and possessed their inheritance can you say Amen now I say to you there is a difference between a restored Son of God and a sinner amen see they didn't go that land amen just to be identified as a sinner they went in that land to be identified as a son ain't that right amen they went into that land not to be identified as a victim as one that is defeated they went in that land to be as to be identified as a conqueror possessor ain't that right you know when when man sinned he separated himself from God and he cross the great Chasm the brother Brandon would tell us and when he did that he put himself on the side of death this side of death and there was that great Chasm that that he could not go back into what he was amen before he had sinned there was no way for him to get back and and and to to to come back to what he was and and brother brandom talks about this Chasm you know there's a there's just just a a a big big big uh gap between man and God now man's on this side where it's a sight of death torment amen destruction amen and and and he can never come back and on this side he was a Son of God this side he is a sinner acting like a sinner uh uh uh uh thinking like a sinner talking like a sinner amen under the slave of the of the devil a puppet for the devil but on this side was a Son of God Amen and and you know the prophet said he's an offspring of God on this side see where he started with was he's a Son of God he's an offspring of God he's an inheritance of the earth he can control nature he can speak things into existence why because there was nothing separating him from God he was in unity with God but when he sin he crossed this Chasm and could not get back can you say Amen that he could speak the prophet said things into existence because he's a Creator himself now have you ever thought brother Brown said Satan is not a Creator his subjects is not a Creator Satan cannot create but man was made to be a Creator when he was on this side of the chasm he stood as a Son of God and his domain was the earth he's a Creator see because he's a offspring of God ain't that right that the prophet said when he when he crossed that Chasm then he separated amen his sunship now he becomes a sinner he he becomes that that Holy image of God has left him amen and and uh uh uh he well brother BR said now he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan and and all that but then God would provide a substitute and in the Old Testament they had the blood of bulls and goats and and uh yet that blood could not divorce sin it could not take away that Chasm amen it it still left that Chasm amen because it could not uh uh uh divorce sin it would only cover sin a ain't that right meaning the prophet said that that that if I've got a red spot on my hand and and and I cover it you know uh uh you know uh with with something and I and I cover it there well just because I cover it and you can't see it doesn't mean that it's not there it's still there ain't that right so that was the blood of bulls and goats it covered their sin but man was still a sinner in the eyes of God and therefore he could not cross amen back to in that Chasm under the blood of bulls and goats because it's still there ain't that right but God would create a blood if if you listen to that the the message God hiding himself in Simplicity or no no the breach amen uh in the breach brother BR talks about that bleach that God created himself it was the created blood of God Amen that was a bleach for sins of men amen I looked up that word bleach it means to remove to wash out Amen to uh uh uh to take away well brother brandom goes and talks about that you know the the drop of ink that that it can stain a shirt it can stain whatever amen but you take that same drop of of of of ink and put it in a bucket of bleach you'll never see it again because the power of bleach it it breaks the elements of that ink it breaks the power and it sends it back amen all them elements that that came to make uh that ink has now been broken up and there's no such thing as ink in that bleach he said that's the if bleach can do that how much more powerful can the blood of Jesus Christ uh take a man's sins and so with it's confessed and dropped in that blood it you well brother Bram said you'll never be able to find it again ain't that right you'll never be able to find it again brother Bram says the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him not you if lays on him till the day of judgment see what happens to the son he now becomes imperfect fellowship with the father again he's no longer in a Chasm he's now brought back in Fellowship through the blood of Jesus Christ into fellowship with the father ain't that right he said see he's becom in perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him there's no stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free how many's free he's free now that means something now you're not just free as an American a lot of people said well I'm American I'm free to do whatever want to but they're still bound there's a lot of people walk in the streets today amen and they're bound but the blood of Jesus Christ has literally set us free that even if you were in prison you're still free even though you were in man-made shackles you're still free and there is no devil of hell that can bind you again now you think of that Chasm when man was on this side of the chasm he lost what God's purpose was for him he lost the thoughts of God Amen God become a mystery to him the purpose of God become mystery everything about God was a mystery but when that Chasm was broken or or repaired and the breach was prepared uh repaired and the man was able to come back in Fellowship amen now comes to him again what God's purpose is for him now comes again what God had intended for him to be in the first place you believe that so now brother Bram said see there's no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah just as that Chlor Clorox and or that ink can never be ink no more because it's broke up you can't go down there amen say well I'm going to get that ink I'm going to I I'm going to I'm going to pour you know sift that uh that bucket of bleach and and and sift it through a strainer until I find that ink you'll never find it there's no such thing as ink in that in there amen it's been broke up not hid it's broke it's demolished it's destroyed now so he says and when s confessed sin is confessed and dipped into the blood he says see a man or a woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and laid on him till the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire and the chasm is bridged and never to come into remembrance no more and a man stands Justified as a Son of God God made a way for you to come back to your inheritance God made a way it's one thing to preach about your inheritance but if your if the chasm is still there there's no way for you to come into your inheritance there's no way for you to understand what God is wanting of you but in this age there's been a voice and that voice is the voice of the blood that says you're forgiven there is no sin against you you are Justified as though you had never done it in the first place it's the voice of the blood on now screaming out can you say amen and a man stands Justified as a Son of God brother bradam says now look when that real genuine birth of the Holy Spirit comes into a man he's a Son of God not pretend you're not pretending to be a daughter of God it ain't a myth that we're preaching here it is a literal thing you stand as a Son of God and have more uh greater Authority than even the president of the United States you have even greater Authority than the Angels that's right prise it's what a prophet said you have more Authority than your angel he he said he said what what what is recognized more the prayer of an angel or a prayer of a Son of God he's a Son of God Amen he said what has more Authority than an angel or a son he said a son he said an angel's just a servant and it's at your bidding amen now you know angels are here to help you believe angels are here to help you when you're struggling angels of God are here right now to move you into a fa higher Faith yeah Prophet teaches it that's right the Angels they're here for you amen that's right yes sir now watch he said now when that real genuine birth of the Holy Spirit comes into a man he's the son of God there is no Chasm everybody say there is no Chasm between him and God there is no Chasm between you and God it's true am Satan wants to tell you there's a Chasm but there's not see he is his son in his presence so you're no longer as Adam kicked out God made a way you are an Adam restored into the presence of God again right amen that's right which means you're no longer a sinner yeah amen I know we've talked about this but you're no longer a sinner the blood of God has so powerfully washed you well didn't Paul say you're loosed I think it was well no as in Revelation we've been loosed H thou Hast loosed Us by thy Blood Brother Brown said it was the perfect blood that is loost loosed you and if it was perfect blood that had loosed you then it's brought a perfect loosening right you have been loosed it's a perfect loosening not just one little string and loosed you not just the loosening of the handcuffs to make you uh your life easier for you but the handcuffs have been destroyed the Rope has been taken off and utterly destroyed that's right that's right so your past has been removed from you amen that's right we uh the family and the young man we we uh went up to the star there in Rono last night to look over the city and there was a another young man he had he had long hair and he had a microphone all set up and he was asking different ones hey would you want to do an interview with me and everybody was turning him down so when we come up uh he asked you know and he all I got is three questions and I said you know we said no that's okay so we went on but I I just felt I need to go back so I went back I said hey uh what what what's your purpose and what what are you doing you know and he said well I'm with this certain thing and said we put this on YouTube and and uh he said I just like to talk to people and things I said okay I said uh I said I'll ask I I'll I'll talk with you and uh so he uh he he he one of the questions that he asked is what is the most thing in your past that you would like to forget and I I said well you know I I I I said uh to be honest there's no way that you can forget your past you know so there'd be no way to dwell on that and wishing you could forget this and forget that what's done is done and you know it'll always your memory will be there so there's no man that could ever really forget his past that's said people have tried to run from their past for years and because it haunts them and and things like that but I said young man I I said there is one that can forget your past and I said that's God and he got wide eyed he said oh really you know and and so I said you know I I said you know to think of it you know he's God having an infinite mind knows the end from the beginning I said I don't know if you know God or anything like that but I said I am a Christian and I I I'm a Believer in God and I I said you know God uh he knows where I am at all times he knows every thought that we think I said he even knows you and and these things and and um I said he actually knows us better than ourselves but I I said one thing though that God wanted to do is he wanted to forget about your past he wanted to forget what you are as a sinner and I said so what he done is he created a blood and that would make him forget and it is so powerful that even an infinite God that knows the end from the beginning that knows every flea that's bad its eye that knows the the the depth of each each breath not only ours but every horse every cow every hippopotamus every lion down to the mosquitoes to to whatever every heartbeat on the face of the Earth God knows and he counts them and yet he creates such a blood that is so powerful there's one thing he can't remember is my sins my past and because of this is I am free from my past I can actually walk away from my past because the one thing that matters is whether he knows my past or not whether he's going to hold that accountable to me but because he's made a blood there's nothing held against me that even though I know what I've done in the natural I can even try to remind God about what I done and he just says what sins are you talking about there's nothing he can remember because he's the one that created the sea of forgetfulness I don't know where that sea is he says there's a sea there he created it for himself that even when Satan comes to me and reminds me of my past amen it doesn't affect my relationship with God right I am a son of God and even though my past might haunt me in my mind a lot of things of regrets and wishes things I wish have I could have redone and all that I still ain't a sinner in the sight of God that's right hallu I don't know how he took it but he was kind but you see he cannot remember them now God did this why would God do this to restore us back to where we would no longer longer be under bondage of the devil how how could you be a conqueror as a sinner how could you be an overcomer a possessor of your inheritance if Satan is dictating your life but God has broken the power of Darkness over your life are you with me yes sir amen broken that power see so now God did that so we can come into our inheritance now notice brother said Jesus never left you you an inheritance he never left us an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance can you say Amen say it with me he paid my for my inheritance he paid for my inheritance he didn't give us our inheritance he paid for our inheritance and brought you to your inheritance ain't that right amen the blood has already been paid it's all already bought the your Redemption is already been paid for 2,000 years ago but in this age there is a book that has been opened and your name is there and every promise in the book is yours it's your inheritance you don't have to be sick you don't have to be beggarly you don't have to be down and brokenhearted you don't have to have that Spirit of anxiety and depression you don't have to have that unbelief hanging on you you yes you believe it am see your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God gave you your inheritance whether you deserved it or not that didn't matter he gave it to you before the foundation of the world you love him Amen brother Brown said see your inheritance was first before the lamb your inheritance was first before the blood was shed your inheritance was first before the foundation of the world ain't that right Jesus only come he says now here's the way here's the way they tried to make it well God said there's a lot of people lost I don't want them you know lost I want him to be saved so I'll send Jesus down and perhaps maybe maybe somebody will feel sorry and know what I've done and get saved oh mercy he said I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do run it some times then see I wouldn't do it like that well how about God see God by his foreign knowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved He sent Jesus to save those that he already chosen see didn't Paul say uh uh uh uh five verses behind this I believe speaking in about Ephesians that he chose us in him before the there was even a world that's our inheritance God chose us aren't you glad God chose you that's your inheritance he chose you to every promise that's what makes this word so real that's that's why the message is so dear to us it takes the promises and hands them to us in our lap and lets us know it's yours you've got a right to claim it don't you let the devil talk you out of your healing don't you let the devil talk you out of the Holy Ghost don't you let the devil talk you out of a Rapture and you say Amen it's your inheritance he chose you see so he says see that's our inheritance God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what his shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us nothing you do then he takes that scripture he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice he said now there's where you'll rise up again and say brother bradam how about that but just remember who have received the knowledge of the truth they never receive the truth they just receive the knowledge of it yes but there was a is a people on this earth like Caleb that reeded the truth and wouldn't let it go they received it can you say amen amen look at the 10 spies that went over that land they received the knowledge of what was in that land they saw the land in which they were to be placed they partook of the evidence of that land but then what did they do they had the knowledge of it but then they gave an evil report to the people so much that their Ministry their voice caused the people's hearts to melt think of it I don't want a Ministry like that I'd rather stand there proclaiming the promise of God to whoever even if it's to the cows yeah than to have such an evil report of negativity that would cause the people's hearts to melt can you say Amen yes sir we're not here dwelling on what you are in in in the physical we're not here dwelling upon your mistakes we're not here dwelling upon the the the limitations that you might have whether you're talented or not talented smart or not smart that doesn't matter there is a promise amen can you say Amen sir see so they partook of it but they gave an evil report of it down Through the Ages God has given a Revival to the church down Through the Ages can you say amen amen they saw the land brother BR talks about it he said let's just say the land is the Holy Ghost he said they saw the land they tasted of it amen in other words you you can't tell me that any god-given Revival that came to the people was just some formal intellectual Revival come on no sir it was it was an evidence that there's a land it's an Evidence of the Holy Spirit can you say Amen brother BR said they had the supernatural all the way down Through the Ages they had tongues they had prophecy they had they had all these things amen down Through the Ages true hello yes sir amen Luther spoke in tongues yes sir it's what brother Bram said Wesley had Supernatural Miracles with him every age has had an Evidence of a land ain't that right amen amen that's right they've all experienced some Supernatural power of God whether it be a portion or whatever but what did the lutherans do they gave an evil report of it what did the weslan do give an evil report of it what did the Pentecostal AES do gave an evil report of it that's right yes yes sir and what's happened just like it did with them 10 spies and all those that believed it they died and every age that church has died because they went and they went into form alism amen amen to where the lutherans don't even resemble what Luther was when he first brought the message the wesle don't even resemble what Wesley was when he first brought the message the Pentecostals don't even resemble what it was on ausa Street that's exactly right can you say Amen they've all gone to formalism and formalism is a death sentence by turning down the word of God God forbid that we would get so formal dead and dried up where we don't even know the power of God anymore can you say Amen sir that's right we need the power of God do you believe that we need the power of God how else is Caleb going to defeat them Giants he said I'll be able to do it if the Lord is with me and so is it with us try to do it on your own self you'll die just as much you'll be defeated ain't that right well what is formalism it's the the practice or the doctrine of strict adherence to prescribed or external forms everything's got to be just right everything's got to be this way you know formalism come into the church when Catholicism was born at ner Rome brother Brown said they organized and set together a church called The Universal Church there they made a universal prayer they had a perfect harmony that was their idea of Harmony where everybody said the same prayer at the same time oh everybody had everything just exactly right that's what they do today everybody around the world's got to have a certain time that they all play the same thing and listen to the same thing and all of these things and they call that Unity that's not Unity amen amen see so they had a perfect harmony everybody had to be together everybody had to say the same thing the same prayer was was said that was formalism that had come into the church but if you notice Caleb he had a different Spirit than them others it's what the Bible said he had a different spirit amen as I said before the word had become so real to him how through the preaching of the Gospel through the preaching of the word ain't that what Paul said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing come by the word of God yes it becomes so real to him the word becomes so precious and so real to him that he would not let it go no sir this is where you know we we talked about it where Paul said what said that the word is NY even in thy mouth everybody say in thy mouth what is in thy mouth the word is NY even in thine mouth and in thine heart that is the word of faith which we preach brother Braham said now the only thing that God can do to make his word real is to get some good preacher who can preach the word that's the official and the initial way can you say Amen yes sir that's what God does he sends a preacher anoints that preacher Amen to preach the gospel and we all know what the gospel is it's the word made Power the word demonstrated so it isn't just something here just saying some little old thing no no it's the word being demonstrated and it's building our faith so what we have seen in this day is a prophet come with thus say the Lord a Divine word and we saw it Dov tail with scripture after scripture after scripture and now it's our turn to preach this same message in the gospel to build faith not build doubt not to bring division not to bring confusion can you say Amen why we've got an inheritance right so the gospel is the word made power now as I get ready to close what caused Adam to lose his inheritance well brother brandham said he turned loose of the word the very thing that he needed he did he didn't need to had no tricks he didn't needed no psychology he didn't need to be smart he didn't need to know the ways of the world he just needed the word and God gave him that word to live by and as long as he had the word he had Dominion his domain was the earth he lived as a God he could speak to the winds peace be still and it would happen I think it was brother Wendell that so uh uh just wonderful message Sunday but he had put it you know talked about it you know he'd speak to a tree be PL move plucked up and planted over here and it would happen he he he could move mountains he could say I don't like that mountain right there you know it's in my way of the sunset so he would say Mountain be be moved and be over here he could re he could replace the Earth and and and do whatever he wanted to with the Earth if not replace but you know what I mean and and and so but he did that by hanging on to the word that God gave him but when he turned loose of the word he lost his inheritance and the prophet said when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely con Supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth God's the god of the universe everywhere but his son had this Earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to but when he did that he lost his inheritance see Adam could say let this mountain be moved over here uh uh over there and it would do it see Adam could say let this tree uh uh here be plucked up and planted over here it would do it for he had complete Supreme control as a minor God under God our father because he was a Son of God he said oh now couldn't we stop here just a minute and get back to our real sermon then if the blood has cleansed it back what about now look at look what that Son of God the second Adam did he and then he says the works that I do shall you do also see Adam lost his in in itance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he swed out to Satan he swed his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the Tree of Life his right to the Earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit of it to the hands of Satan he passed it from his hand to Satan now there has been he said it it it returned and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had and that's the Earth ain't that right why because Adam L let go of the word but there was a Caleb that was a type of this last day bride that would follow that end time messenger that would not turn loose of the word no sir everyone else let go of it and you think of it these stem spies they were probably no doubt men of great reputation they must have it a some old beggar they must have had great standing among the people right because what they said so turned them from the message of the hour so turned them what they said caused their hearts to melt CU they must have had great respect for these men great respect that would turn their heart from the message and they let go of the word that Caleb wouldn't let go no sir he wouldn't let go of that word aren't you glad for that yes sir see God sent the prophet Moses to give word give his word to the people Moses wasn't just a prophet he was the manifestation of the word that was given to Abraham and God Vindicated Moses before the people you think of that the people had saw the supernatural they had saw the the Red Sea open they had saw you know their clothes never wore out their shoes never never grew old did you know every time they were hungry God fed them every time they were thirsty there was a rock that followed them oh my and it wasn't just a little tricker you know a trickle it it was a gushing it was a such a gushing that that it actually last Ed I mean there was still water years later when when when uh was it Jehoshaphat and Ahab join made Alliance and and they were they they wandered out in the desert and they were they were thirsty they were about to die and all that and and they remembered there was a prophet Elisha and and the prophet Elisha told them to start digging and and the prophet Elisha knew that there was water under there that flow from that rock and when they were digging that's what a prophet said now that and and he told them to dig because there was water there and when they dug the water began to Spring forth that wasn't a little trickle of water that come from that rock it was a Guster and yet these men with an evil report made their hearts to melt that they would forget about their inheritance they would forget about the supernatural that was with them they would forget about everything all right yeah and they died oh church do you love him you would think that God wasted his time in sending Moses to to them or that he wasted his time in proving to them time in time again see but God didn't waste his time for the word was sent to a predestinated people and all out of all them millions of people there was only two that really knew what it was all about and that was Caleb and Joshua sir they stayed with the word they stayed with it can you amen and there is a people that's going to stay with it in this age church if I can just encourage you don't get discouraged keep pressing on keep pressing on can you say Amen if you'll watch the pattern of every Son of God remember as we talked about you know it but before the people could God would allow the people to going to the promised land he brought them to their final testing and that was that Kadesh barnea right and and and Kadesh Baria means judgment it's it's it's testing time and and it was a testing time for the people they had to make their judgment they had to judge between God's word and and an evil report their faith was to be tested to see if they really had the faith that to to believe because God would not allow unbelief to enter into that land unbelief that kept them from entering into that land there had to be a Heart full of Faith Can you say Amen they didn't need another Prophet amen God had already sent him a prophet amen so so God didn't say okay you know before I be before I you know y'all I send the 10 spies and all that i' I've got to send you another Prophet along so so you can get this and so you can really understand because maybe Moses ain't making it clear to y'all I I don't believe that just as much as I don't believe we need another Prophet to lead this bride around I I believe that God sent a prophet of Malachi 4 and he was so clear that a Believer can understand that every promise is for them and they will lay hold to that word that's right yes sir I just believe that amen see so so we look at these things it would be nice it would be nice if God would have just let everybody just hear Moses hear Moses just here Moses but God allowed the 10 spies to go over knowing knowing that they had an evil heart of unbelief knowing what they were going to do he allowed them to see the evidence of the land but he also allowed them to see the Giants the obstacles everything there and then they would come back and of course they would forget about the evidence they would override the evidence and everything that God said in his word and saw the truthness of it the manifestation of it and all they saw was GI all they saw was The Impossibles all they saw and then they began God would allow them to voice it out to the people God would allow them at Kadesh barnea just before they would cross into the land to see where they were with this can you say Amen yes sir see and it would be so great if God would keep the negative away from the message of the hour it'd be great if he would just keep us from I'm saying all the negative amongst around the message the message ranks and around the church and in from our home and it'd be nice if he had just only let us see all positive about everything that God allows people to rise up in a church and cause division he allows people to rise up with an evil Port report about the message and the messenger he allows us to see and to hear what the make believers are doing and what they are saying he allows us to come to this to where we have to make our choice but I tell you what church as for me in my house as Joshua said I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to serve the Lord no matter what it takes can you say Amen yep God lets us see the good and the ugly but he does it to see where your faith is and even Jesus had to be tested he had to be tried but he withstood every bit of he stayed right with the word of God he defeated Satan upon the word of God you ain't going to defeat Satan on your personality your charisma you ain't going to defeat Satan by being grouchy and by by by you know uh uh uh gossiping you you ain't going to defeat Satan by dancing and shouting and being talented you'll defeat him only by the word of God and and God has already given us the word God's already given us the Word of Promise in this age amen all I believe it that's right I believe it do you believe it if the musicians will come God bless you brother brah talks about he says the Seed of Abraham must first be tested to see if they really believe the word remember the only way that he could keep the promises of God because he believed the promise of God I'll say that again the only way that he could keep the promise of God is because he believed the promise of God it's the only way we'll keep the promise of God is when we believe the promise of God and was tested whether he believed it or not we are brought to that test the Seed of Abraham today is brought to that test will we take God's word or will we take what man said about it will we take what some organization has made up as a Creed and accept that or do we take what God said if God's word is true we believe God's word regardless of what anything else is we let Every Man's word be a lie and God's be truth the true Seed of Abraham but before you can become that true seed you've got to go through the test like Abraham did himself he promised not only to Abraham but to his seed would that but his seed would possess the enemy's Gates oh my just think the patriarch was fully persuaded in it in his test of the promise of the word of God it was right see regardless of what the circumstances was he still believed the word was right the Abraham the great patriarch never wavered in faith when he was brought to that testing time he believed that God was able to raise him up from the dead he believed it because God made the promise and when God made a promise that he would be father of Nations see uh uh he believed that that was so he didn't know how it would be when the baby come after he had trusted 25 years and then asked to destroy the baby he still knew that God's promise was true and he gave his son see his seed is the same thing the promise of God is the seal to those who are the Seed of Abraham the promise is a seal a signed witness and when we believe every promised word then the seal is given to us to confirm the promised by oh aren't you glad for that being the Seed of Abraham we go through the test whether we're going to believe the Bible or not the Bible is this word of God see it is it it is because it is God and then after you've went through the test to believe when some of them says well the days of Miracles has passed if you accept that that's contrary to the word if you say you do not receive the Holy Ghost today there's no such thing just the 12 apostles received it well the word said Peter preaching it on the day of Pentecost he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call that's exactly what it means so now if you're ready to take the test of God's acid test and follow that prescription I'm telling you
