[35:48] always, a great honor to be here with
[35:50] Faith Tabernacle with [music] Sean and
[35:52] certainly appreciate him the invitation
[35:54] to be here and and for each of you
[35:56] that's drove and came and and set aside
[35:59] your time. I just pray the Holy Spirit
[36:00] would would [music] speak to you in a
[36:02] special way. Amen. And Amen. It'd be
[36:05] wonderful. Amen. It's good to see you
[36:06] all tonight. And Amen. We've [music] got
[36:08] some things upon our heart and I just
[36:11] pray the Lord would just move upon it.
[36:13] Amen. Let's [music] just bow our hearts
[36:14] together tonight and and let's just look
[36:16] to him for it. Father, we certainly
[36:19] thank you tonight, Lord, trusting,
[36:22] believing, Lord,
[36:24] as we put our hands in yours, knowing,
[36:26] Lord, that above all things, we [music]
[36:28] worship you. We serve you. We love you,
[36:30] Lord. And we ask that, Lord, that these
[36:33] meetings would just bring glory to you
[36:35] and to your name, Lord.
[36:38] Father, I pray [music] that you would
[36:40] bless your children tonight. I pray that
[36:42] you would take your word of faith, Lord,
[36:44] and that you would place it in them,
[36:46] Lord. That you would use [music] the
[36:48] words, Lord, to be able to inspire and
[36:52] strengthen this group, Lord, the
[36:55] believers that have gathered here
[36:56] tonight, Lord. Now, [music] Father, we
[36:59] ask you and invite you that you would
[37:02] just begin to take the services, Lord.
[37:05] if there's something that is a great
[37:07] need among us tonight. Lord, [music] we
[37:09] invite the supernatural, God, that you
[37:12] could take a hold of these things
[37:13] [music] and use them for your glory. And
[37:16] Lord, we ask you now, come take control
[37:18] of the service. Father, we pray in
[37:20] [music] the name of Jesus. Amen and
[37:24] amen. And God bless you tonight. And
[37:26] [music] Amen. I just want to enter back
[37:28] into the word if it's possible. Amen.
[37:30] It's uh like I said, a very wonderful to
[37:33] be here with you. Amen. Let's turn into
[37:35] the book of Hebrews. We're going to go
[37:36] back into the seventh chapter of the
[37:38] book of Hebrews. And I'm going to just
[37:40] read it again. Uh Hebrews chapter 7.
[37:42] Amen. It's a um it's a a tremendous
[37:46] time, amen, to be serving the Lord and
[37:49] and to be in the age that we're in. I I
[37:53] think of a prophet saying that we would
[37:55] rather be in this age as any other time.
[37:57] And I don't think that he was ignorant
[37:58] of the other ages. I just think he had a
[38:01] revelation and reality of what really
[38:04] was happening in this age. Amen. And
[38:07] comparable to the other ages, it's a
[38:09] very powerful time. Amen. Amen. Um I
[38:12] want to read here from Hebrews chapter
[38:14] 7. We're going to read four verses. Now
[38:16] for this Mazdc is the king of Salem, the
[38:20] priest of the most high God whom Abraham
[38:23] met returning from the slaughter of the
[38:26] kings and blessed him. to whom also
[38:29] Abraham gave a tenth part of all by
[38:31] being interpretation
[38:33] the king of righteousness and after that
[38:36] also the king of Salem which is the king
[38:39] of peace. He had without father without
[38:42] mother without dissent having neither
[38:46] beginning of days nor end of life but
[38:49] made like unto the son of God abideth a
[38:51] priest consent continually. Now consider
[38:54] how great this man was unto whom even
[38:57] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of
[39:00] his spools. May God bless his word
[39:02] tonight as you could be seated. And I I
[39:04] want to talk to you a little bit tonight
[39:06] about the things that uh that's upon my
[39:08] heart. And Amen. I I've just been uh in
[39:11] a in a bit of study upon these things.
[39:13] And I know I know we're right at home
[39:15] tonight here with brother Sean and the
[39:17] church and all of you uh just message
[39:19] believers. I I I I've never pretend to
[39:21] be anything different than a message
[39:23] preacher. That's just who I am. And
[39:25] that's what I believe. And Amen. And uh
[39:27] I I just I'm just not ashamed of the
[39:29] message. I'm not ashamed of the
[39:30] commission. I'm not ashamed of the
[39:32] prophet. I'm not ashamed of what he
[39:34] taught. Amen. But rather, I'm very happy
[39:36] to be identified with such a a message
[39:39] and such a grace that we would be able
[39:41] to be identified with that. And I
[39:43] certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[39:44] Tonight. And Amen. As we're as we're
[39:47] entering into these things, I'd like to
[39:49] talk to you a little bit about uh uh I'm
[39:51] just going to take this for a title
[39:52] maybe to get you an idea where I'm going
[39:55] with this, but uh I want to talk to you
[39:57] about unlocking uh the spiritual gene
[40:00] expressions. Unlocking spiritual gene
[40:03] expressions. And and and when I I I talk
[40:06] about that, I I recognize here that of
[40:08] course we're dealing with Melazdc and
[40:10] and and last night we we spoke about him
[40:13] a little bit. Amen. But of course, amen,
[40:16] if you're if you're talking about
[40:17] Melkazdc,
[40:18] this is the age uh when you can. Now,
[40:21] Paul said it in Hebrews 5 that he said
[40:24] that he would like to talk about it back
[40:26] then. He said, "But they're a bit dull
[40:28] of hearing and it wasn't the time uh for
[40:31] this to come out." But then, Brother
[40:32] Bam, he he he comes forth and really uh
[40:36] uh dives into scripture and brings out
[40:38] who Melazdc is. And he does it for the
[40:41] believer. Amen. that we might be able to
[40:43] understand who this is. And somebody
[40:45] said, "Well, who is he?" Brother Wayne
[40:47] said, "Well, the prophet said, watch,
[40:48] the scripture said he's without
[40:50] beginning of days or ending of life."
[40:51] So, he's an eternal person.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; The scripture says he was also a man.
[40:56] So, whoever this man was, Amen. It was
[41:00] God who created a human body and stepped
[41:03] into it and spoke to Abraham. And it was
[41:06] like to the son of God because it was a
[41:09] created body, not the begotten body of
[41:11] the son of God through a virgin birth.
[41:14] Amen. But it was God in theophonic form
[41:17] speaking to his servant Abraham. Amen.
[41:20] To Amen. to bless him. Amen. And to
[41:22] bring communion unto him. And I I think
[41:24] it's so powerful because it's the effect
[41:27] of that revelation is what uh as what
[41:30] made Abraham, brother Abraham said when
[41:31] he saw uh three come to the tent door,
[41:34] he could look at all three and he could
[41:36] say my Lord. He said and oh Lot down in
[41:39] Sodom, he said when he seen him come
[41:40] down there, he said he's seen two and he
[41:43] said, "My Lords." He said, "Then watch
[41:45] the effect of that revelation." And
[41:47] Abraham knew just that one God and and
[41:49] was able to witness him when he began to
[41:51] speak to him. And Amen. when he come to
[41:53] that tent door. And now, Brother Bam
[41:55] told us, he said, "Then see the very
[41:57] same one that come to that tent door to
[42:00] Abraham, he said, now let me turn my
[42:02] back to you." He said, "So you can see
[42:05] that the same angel that was there at
[42:07] the tent door is the same angel that is
[42:09] here tonight." Amen. And I I would like
[42:12] to uh say, Amen. I don't believe that
[42:14] that's just a history lesson in the
[42:16] church. But I believe that same angel is
[42:19] still with the message of the hour just
[42:21] like he was in the days of the prophet.
[42:23] Amen. Amen. He's still just as alive
[42:25] tonight because we wouldn't call him
[42:27] Melazdc tonight. We would call him Jesus
[42:30] Christ because Melazdc became Jesus. And
[42:33] Jesus is not dead but yet he is alive.
[42:37] Now, now, Brother Brandham is very uh uh
[42:39] clear and I love how he does it because
[42:40] he uses this revelation of Melazdc.
[42:44] Amen. To expose you, the the seed of
[42:47] Abraham to the same revelation Abraham
[42:49] had. And that revelation is of that
[42:52] eternal person of that God. No matter if
[42:54] he appeared in a pillar of fire or if he
[42:57] was in a burning bush or if he was
[42:59] standing in the cloth, amen, of
[43:01] Melchazdc or whether it was that one he
[43:03] called Lord God Almighty. Whoever it
[43:06] was, he showed you it was the same
[43:07] person just changing mask. And he said
[43:10] that God never changed his attitude. He
[43:13] never lost ability. He was the same God
[43:16] all the time. He was just changing mask.
[43:18] And brother Bam takes that revelation
[43:20] then to explain to you his ministry and
[43:23] what was happening in the in his
[43:25] generation. Now, in the proving of his
[43:27] word, Brother Bam tells us a powerful
[43:29] thing when he says, "See, now remember
[43:33] that was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[43:35] back there that could discern the
[43:37] thoughts that was in Sarah's mind." He
[43:39] said, "That was not Jesus. He had not
[43:41] yet been born." But it was a man in
[43:43] human flesh that Abraham called Elohim.
[43:46] And he said, "That great almighty." See,
[43:48] as it was in the days of Sodom, watch
[43:50] now. In the days of Sodom, so shall it
[43:53] be at the coming of the Son of Man. when
[43:55] the son of man is being revealed. Now,
[43:58] watch what he's doing. He's taking Luke
[44:00] 17:30 and Genesis the 18th chapter and
[44:03] telling you the same thing that happened
[44:05] in Genesis 18 is exactly what Luke 17:30
[44:09] is about. Amen. It's in the days of the
[44:12] Sodom, so will it be in the coming of
[44:14] the son of man when the son of man is
[44:17] revealed. Now, not as a churchy, but the
[44:20] bride is called in the day when the son
[44:22] of man is revealed to join the church.
[44:25] Amen. To the head. Now, we only have one
[44:27] head, and that head is our Lord Jesus
[44:30] Christ. And and the church is to be
[44:32] joined to the head, our Lord Jesus,
[44:34] which is the word. He says, "For the
[44:36] marriage of the bride." See, the
[44:39] bridegroom call will come right down
[44:41] through this. So, brother Ram is telling
[44:42] you now the ministry in Genesis 18 is
[44:46] the ministry that the son of man will
[44:48] have in the last day. And when he begins
[44:50] to speak, it'll be the age where the
[44:53] bride is going to be brought to the
[44:55] headship. In other words, this this
[44:57] ministry is going to bind together Jesus
[45:01] and his bride. That it's going to it's
[45:04] going to cause a union to transpire
[45:07] between the two. And brother Bam says,
[45:09] "Then the church has to be the word
[45:11] because he's the word and the two unites
[45:14] together." How many realizes that's what
[45:16] the marriage of the lamb is about? It's
[45:18] about you being the hearer of the word
[45:21] and him being the word. And when them
[45:23] two come together, it's called a
[45:25] spiritual union. Amen. That God
[45:28] invisibly has come into union of the
[45:31] bride. Amen. And it's by the message of
[45:34] the hour is how that union's going to
[45:37] take place. In other words, you can't be
[45:39] the bride without the message of the
[45:42] hour because that is the purpose of the
[45:46] message is to join together the bride
[45:49] and Christ. Amen. Now, it'll take a
[45:52] manifestation and a revealing of the son
[45:54] of man. That's why not a clergyman can
[45:56] do this or just any preacher. Amen. See,
[45:59] it's Jesus Christ. And he'll come down
[46:02] in human flesh among us and we'll make
[46:05] his word so real. Amen. That it will
[46:08] unite the church and him as one. Now,
[46:10] the bride and then she'll go home to the
[46:13] wedding supper. Now, if you're a if
[46:16] you're a study of the message, this is
[46:17] one of them that you can put on your on
[46:19] your uh refrigerator and you can read it
[46:21] daily. He said, "The wedding supper, see
[46:24] not to the marriage." See, I'll go home
[46:27] to the wedding supper. But she's already
[46:29] united. See? Amen. We're not going to
[46:32] the marriage. We're going to the wedding
[46:34] supper. The marriage takes place here
[46:37] under the message of the hour. See, then
[46:40] you're already a married woman. Amen.
[46:43] Isn't it beautiful tonight to think
[46:45] about the rapture is the marriage
[46:47] supper. Amen. Then brother man said, see
[46:49] then the only the Holy Ghost fililled
[46:52] bride is going to go in that rapture.
[46:54] Amen. So tonight, if you're that Holy
[46:56] Ghost filled bride, Amen. you're going,
[46:58] THERE'S NO WAY to miss the rapture
[47:01] because you've already become the bride
[47:04] before the rapture ever takes place. I'm
[47:06] so glad to know that there's already
[47:09] been a union that has transpired in the
[47:12] age we're living in. That's what is so
[47:14] powerful in the sermon of Christ, the
[47:16] mystery of God revealed when brother
[47:18] Brandham says, "They are now one unit."
[47:20] Amen. It's not two different things. A
[47:23] prophet is now looking at the bride and
[47:25] he's saying the bride and Christ are the
[47:28] same thing. This is not two DIFFERENT
[47:30] THINGS. SEE, CHRIST AND THE BRIDE ARE
[47:33] NOT SEPARATE. It is now she has become,
[47:36] amen, the word in the age she's living
[47:39] in because she is the bride of Christ.
[47:42] Now, I think it's very powerful when you
[47:44] begin to see brother Brandham says then
[47:46] watch. He says when that son of man
[47:48] manifested itself, he said then the two
[47:51] become one. And when it does that,
[47:54] what's going to happen? It'll manifest
[47:56] the son of man again.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; It'll manifest the son of man again.
[48:02] Now, many people think that after
[48:04] brother Brandham left the scene, then
[48:06] this then we go right back to the son of
[48:08] god age. Amen. And it's no longer a
[48:10] prophetic age. It's no longer a
[48:12] prophetic time. We have moved out of the
[48:15] son of man dispensation. But that's not
[48:17] true, folks. Amen. This message joins
[48:20] you with the headship of Christ. And
[48:22] brother Bam said, "I now challenge you
[48:24] to believe that the Son of Man will be
[48:27] manifested in the bride's body." Well,
[48:29] you talk about a challenge tonight to
[48:31] believe that the Son of Man is
[48:34] manifested in the bride's body, but it's
[48:37] done by THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU'RE
[48:39] NOT THE PROPHET. You're the product OF
[48:41] THE PROPHECY. AND NOW THE vindication of
[48:44] his word HAS COME RIGHT IN TO the church
[48:47] of the LIVING GOD. OH MY GOODNESS. AMEN.
[48:50] We can look at this tonight and we can
[48:52] look back 50, 60, 70 years and we could
[48:55] talk about the PROPHET AND WE COULD TALK
[48:57] ABOUT HOW God done things with the
[48:59] prophet OF THE HOUR. AMEN. BUT LISTEN, I
[49:02] think it's time to move the revelation.
[49:04] Amen. To move it up from what God DID IN
[49:06] THE PROPHET UNTIL WHAT GOD IS DOING IN
[49:09] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. WE'RE NOT
[49:12] HERE JUST FOR A HISTORY LESSON. WE are
[49:14] here to manifest what has been brought
[49:17] into this age and has been proven to be
[49:20] thus saith the Lord. This bride is not
[49:23] feeding on just anything. She's feeding
[49:25] on the mind of Christ. That's what she's
[49:28] receiving is the mind of Christ. It's
[49:31] not what has happened, it's what is
[49:34] happening. She will manifest the son of
[49:37] man again. Isn't that beautiful? That's
[49:41] why he said in John 12. Amen. Jesus
[49:43] said, he says, "I will glorify thy
[49:46] name." The father spit, "I'll glorify
[49:48] thy name." And they said, "Well, that's
[49:49] the thunders." And Jesus said, "No,
[49:52] that's the voice of God." And he said,
[49:53] "I manifest thy name. I'll glorify thy
[49:56] name, but I will glorify thy name
[49:59] again."
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. Now, watch that
[50:04] because that again part is what really
[50:07] what really brings forth the bride of
[50:09] Christ. Now, of course, brother Bham in
[50:11] the future home. Amen. He says it here.
[50:14] He says, "Amen." He said, "Now, there's
[50:17] a difference between the intellectual
[50:20] faith, Amen, and the revelation."
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bam used the Pharisee and
[50:25] the woman at the well to tell the
[50:26] difference. And and what he said was he
[50:29] said, "Of course, the Pharisee had
[50:31] learned it from the Bible. He had
[50:33] learned God was God. He had learned
[50:34] holiness was right. He had learned there
[50:36] was a law of God. He had learned an
[50:38] intellectual conception. And he was born
[50:40] in the right lineage. He was a Levite,
[50:42] but he only knowed it by intellectual
[50:44] conception. Amen. But see, Amen. He had
[50:48] learned it from what had happened.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And that's a lot of good theologians, a
[50:54] lot of people reading the Bible, they
[50:56] learned it of what had happened. And
[50:58] they can they can tell you a lot about
[51:00] what had happened. Amen. But it'll take
[51:02] a spiritual revelation to tell you what
[51:06] is happening. IT'LL REQUIRE THE ability
[51:10] to hear from God. It'll take the spirit
[51:13] of God to bring revelation to make the
[51:16] thing clear up in your mind to bring
[51:19] clear understanding of what is happening
[51:22] today. I I love how brother Brandham
[51:25] said that little woman at the well, she
[51:27] had an attribute in her that was a
[51:29] represented in heaven. So when she saw
[51:32] the manifestation of the son of man,
[51:35] Amen. she knew what was happening. It
[51:37] was something happening, folks. She
[51:39] dropped her water bucket and run into
[51:41] the city to let them know what was
[51:43] happening because she had the ability to
[51:46] receive revelation. And I thank God
[51:49] tonight that there's something on the
[51:51] inside of us, amen, that we're not just
[51:53] reading the message, amen, of something
[51:55] that happened back in 1960s, but there's
[51:59] something about the message that is
[52:01] stirring up a revival THAT IS HAPPENING
[52:04] IN THE CHURCH TONIGHT. THERE'S SOMETHING
[52:06] ON THE INSIDE OF THE believer that has
[52:08] been awakened by THIS MESSAGE TO LET US
[52:11] KNOW WHAT I'M DOING TONIGHT COMES FROM
[52:14] WHAT GOD HAS done in the age that I'm
[52:16] living in. My goodness, when you see
[52:19] what's going on in the day that you're
[52:21] living in now, now uh uh there a couple
[52:24] direct statements here I think is a is a
[52:26] real blessing. Amen. And and maybe just
[52:28] to uh make a definitive statement upon
[52:31] it. Amen. You said, "Brother Wayne,
[52:32] what's happening?" Well, let me read you
[52:34] what Brother Bam says. It's a spiritual
[52:36] union of Christ and his church.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; When the flesh is becoming word and the
[52:42] word is becoming flesh, that's what's
[52:45] happening. The positive is moving into
[52:48] the negative and the negative is moving
[52:50] into the positive. Amen. That's what's
[52:52] happening. You're you're reading the
[52:54] messages. You're hearing your pastors
[52:56] preach and the spirit of God is taking
[52:59] the word and bringing it into your life.
[53:01] And you are starting to become the very
[53:04] word that you are hearing. Amen. I I
[53:06] love how brother Bam says the word is
[53:08] becoming flesh now. That's what is going
[53:10] on. Amen. You You have began to nurse
[53:13] from the promises of God a change into
[53:17] your life. Amen. Amen. When you think
[53:19] about it, Amen. Somebody said, "Well,
[53:21] Brother Wayne, then then what are we
[53:23] dealing with?" See, but it's time for
[53:26] Elohim to come into bride form.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:31] Isn't it time for God to come back into
[53:33] human flesh? Brother Bam said, "The word
[53:36] is sharper than a two-ed sword, a
[53:38] discerner, and see, he's here to appear
[53:40] on the scene to make Jesus the same
[53:43] yesterday, today, and forever." It's a
[53:46] promised word that's been allotted for
[53:48] this day. Now, we are living in this
[53:50] day, and God is here with us to manifest
[53:54] it and make it true. See, it'll take the
[53:57] Holy Spirit in you. It'll take the
[54:00] message that's been sent to you to take
[54:03] the two and to make it true in the day
[54:06] that we're living in. Now, this is the
[54:08] day brother says it now. He says, "When
[54:11] the son of man is being revealed, Elohim
[54:14] will return back to the royal seed of
[54:16] Abraham and show them the same thing he
[54:19] showed him in that day." Has he done it?
[54:21] Then Elohim as it was, it will be a
[54:24] characteristic of God.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram says, "Now watch
[54:29] this. Jesus said, at that day ye shall
[54:32] see me." See, the world seeth me no
[54:35] more, but ye shall SEE ME BECAUSE OF THE
[54:39] revelation of Mechazedc when it's COMING
[54:42] FORTH IN THIS AGE. You'll see that
[54:45] revelation, BUT NOT JUST SEE IT, you
[54:47] will allow IT INTO THE HEARTS THAT IT
[54:50] WILL BEGIN TO change you and change your
[54:53] lives. The characteristics of God. Now,
[54:56] now, now, Brother Bama, he sums it all
[54:58] up by saying the whole picture. He says
[55:00] from Genesis to Revelation, there's
[55:02] nothing wrong. This is Elohim
[55:05] materializing so he can be touched.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; This is Elohim materializing so he could
[55:12] be touched. Now y'all don't y'all don't
[55:14] maybe sometimes think about it like this
[55:17] but when that word is coming into your
[55:19] life this is Elohim in coming into you
[55:23] through the word and the spirit that's
[55:25] in you is starting to manifest Elohim
[55:29] the invisible God is becoming visible
[55:33] and you are becoming the visible
[55:35] presence of almighty God MY GOODNESS
[55:38] THAT'S WHY IN CHRIST the mystery brother
[55:40] Ram said what was hid in the mind of God
[55:44] is now in the flesh of the bride of
[55:47] Jesus Christ. You want to know what God
[55:48] had on his mind? Amen. I say this, you
[55:51] turn, look around the room right now and
[55:53] you can see what God had on his mind.
[55:56] Might not impress you. Amen. But it
[55:59] impresses GOD BECAUSE GOD IS SATISFIED.
[56:02] AMEN. It's his bride. It's his word. And
[56:06] there's been a union in this age. Amen.
[56:08] And I thank God that when he looks upon
[56:10] it, he is satisfied with what his work
[56:13] has done in this age. You say, "Brother,
[56:16] brother Wayne, now there there's I'm
[56:18] just making direct statements. This
[56:20] whole thing is God becoming tangible."
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Elohim materializing. God becoming
[56:27] tangible. What is it? It's God, the
[56:30] eternal one is becoming tangible in a
[56:33] bride. [screaming] Brother Brandon uses
[56:35] the word immorate. He said he's becoming
[56:37] immorph. What is it? It's immorphe in a
[56:40] bride. Amen. The word is hid not behind
[56:44] badger skins. It's behind bride skins.
[56:48] Amen. What is it? It's the eternal
[56:50] spirit. And his attribute displayed in
[56:52] his body. Amen. Moving it from a
[56:55] negative to a positive. Just like a dark
[56:58] room develops a picture.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; God had took a picture of you before the
[57:03] world ever began. God's got a picture of
[57:05] the bride tonight. Do you know God put
[57:07] the picture up there in his attribute?
[57:10] Amen. And and brother Amos, it doesn't
[57:12] matter what the devil does, that
[57:14] attribute can never be destroyed.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; The attribute. Now, think of that's a
[57:18] quote. Attribute can't be destroyed.
[57:20] That picture cannot be destroyed. It was
[57:23] not taken of you, Amen, at your worst.
[57:26] It was taken of YOU AT YOUR BEST. AND
[57:28] GOD is here by the message developing.
[57:32] Amen. They say the best you. I'd say
[57:34] this. Amen. You can't get 10 steps to
[57:36] the best you. And you can't buy some
[57:38] theologian book to get the best you. But
[57:41] the best you IS THE ONE GOD HAD IN HIS
[57:43] MIND. But the way to get the BEST YOU IS
[57:46] BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, [screaming]
[57:48] BROTHER. IT FITS LIKE A glove on the
[57:51] bride of Jesus Christ. It is the
[57:53] developing of a picture moving from the
[57:56] positive to the negative. Now, many
[57:58] times it'll take death to develop that
[58:00] picture. But there's a bride on the
[58:03] scene today that that will not be a
[58:05] development of death, but the spirit of
[58:08] God will develop the full picture while
[58:11] they yet live. And they step from one
[58:14] body to another. My goodness. Amen. That
[58:17] attribute of God. What is it? It's
[58:20] Elohim. And these are direct quote.
[58:22] Amen. It's Elohim back in the bride.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Elohim is back. You said, "Brother
[58:29] Wayne, WHERE'S HE AT in the bride?"
[58:31] &gt;&gt; He's not just in this room. He's not
[58:34] just in the age. HE'S NOT JUST IN A
[58:36] PROPHET. ELOHIM IS back in THE BRIDE.
[58:40] HE'S HERE TONIGHT IN THE FORM OF THE
[58:43] BRIDE. LOOK, YOU AIN'T got to PRAY HIM
[58:46] DOWN. HE'S ALREADY HERE. YOU AIN'T GOT
[58:48] TO SAY, "GOD, COME DOWN TONIGHT." HE'S
[58:51] ALREADY HERE. HE'S HERE IN THE FORM OF A
[58:54] BRIDE. WHEN YOU BEGIN to surrender,
[58:56] Amen. GOD BEGINS TO COME OUT of the
[58:59] inside. It's Elohim. And he's back in a
[59:02] bride. That's it. Amen. Brother Brandham
[59:05] talks about it. It's Elohim, but this
[59:08] time he's back in the seed of Abraham.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; He's in the seed OF ABRAHAM. ALL that
[59:15] God was, somebody say, all. All that God
[59:18] was, he poured into Christ. Come on,
[59:21] folks. That's what he did. But what's he
[59:23] doing? AND ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST HAS
[59:26] been poured into this bride. Amen. I
[59:29] heard a guy quote that one time. He
[59:31] said, "Well, you got to know that,
[59:32] brother Bam really didn't mean all. No,
[59:34] all means all. And all that was in God
[59:37] was poured into Christ. And all that was
[59:40] in Christ was poured into this bride.
[59:42] There's not one man walking around on
[59:44] the earth with all OF GOD." AMEN. BUT
[59:47] YOU GOT THE SAME element in you that WAS
[59:49] IN JESUS CHRIST. IT MAY JUST BE A
[59:52] TEASPOON, BUT BROTHER, IT'S GOD. AND
[59:54] THERE'S NO WEAK SPOT IN GOD. IF GOD IS
[59:57] IN YOU, ALL POWER IS IN YOU. THE POWER
[1:00:00] OF CREATION IS IN YOU. LIFE IS IN YOU.
[1:00:03] TRUTH IS IN YOU. Because God, the
[1:00:06] eternal one, is on the inside of you
[1:00:08] residing. Amen. In you.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; That's a prophet we're talking about.
[1:00:16] I'm not reading some Baptist
[1:00:18] theologians. And I'm not just picking on
[1:00:20] Baptist, but they GOT A GOOD GUESS. THIS
[1:00:22] IS THUS SAYAITH the Lord. ALL THAT WAS
[1:00:24] IN CHRIST has been poured into THIS
[1:00:27] BRIDE. AMEN. NOW WATCH THIS. If you want
[1:00:30] scripture, it's John 14. At that day you
[1:00:33] shall know that I'm the father, the
[1:00:34] father and me and I and you and you and
[1:00:36] me. Now that's a that's a complete,
[1:00:38] isn't it? That's a complete revelation.
[1:00:40] The Bible in the bride. Amen. Who is
[1:00:42] God? Brother Bram says it. Deity is here
[1:00:45] with us. He says, "Deity is in us." This
[1:00:50] is a prophet speaking. Deity is not in
[1:00:52] heaven. DEITY IS in the bride.
[1:00:57] [laughter]
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wayne, I'm a
[1:00:59] Christian." Do you know what it means to
[1:01:00] be a Christian? To be a Christian means
[1:01:02] to be Christlike.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You're tabernacling deity.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; You have become the tabernacle of deity.
[1:01:09] Amen. The the spirit of God has come
[1:01:12] into you. Now you you you look around
[1:01:15] today and we see what was happening in
[1:01:18] another age. We had see what happened in
[1:01:21] another time. But where are you
[1:01:23] standing? What what what is the standing
[1:01:26] of things as they are today? It's God
[1:01:29] our Lord Jesus in the form of bride.
[1:01:33] Amen. Now now brother Brandon will ask
[1:01:36] it. You say bride word bride. You keep
[1:01:39] talking like this. And brother Ram said,
[1:01:41] "Oh yeah, that's the manifestation of
[1:01:43] this hour." Not a creed or denomination,
[1:01:47] but a living oracle of God, an attribute
[1:01:50] of God, displaying to the world the
[1:01:53] attributes of God in the formation of
[1:01:55] bride. It's God, but you're viewing it
[1:01:59] in formation of bride. You're not
[1:02:01] viewing it in formation of a of a bush.
[1:02:04] It's not in formation of the man Melazdc
[1:02:06] or the man, the Lord Jesus. You're
[1:02:09] viewing God in the form of the bride.
[1:02:13] My goodness. You ought to tell that old
[1:02:15] devil, "Get on out of here, Satan."
[1:02:17] Amen. God chose me. Whether you like it
[1:02:20] or anybody else likes it, he made his
[1:02:22] election before the foundation of THE
[1:02:24] WORLD. HE CLAIMED OUR LIVES and now in
[1:02:27] morphase himself in that body.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, thank God tonight.
[1:02:34] Amen. Brother Bam says it is the
[1:02:35] displaying of the world the attributes
[1:02:37] of God in the formation of bride that's
[1:02:40] to be expressed in this hour. Now when
[1:02:43] we come to the house of God tonight I
[1:02:45] there's some things you hear Brother Bam
[1:02:46] say it's just so powerful. Amen. You
[1:02:49] come to the house of God tonight and and
[1:02:51] some people I know we're in an age it
[1:02:53] seems like you got to pick you know are
[1:02:55] are y'all are y'all a spirit or y'all
[1:02:57] word. Well uh we're both.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost like people got to
[1:03:02] make you choose now. You know which side
[1:03:04] are you on? Well, we're both. Amen.
[1:03:06] We're both word and spirit. And if you
[1:03:08] get one without the other, you got out
[1:03:09] of balance.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the prophet will tell us.
[1:03:13] He says, "Now people make it a funeral
[1:03:15] possession."
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; He said they make it a funeral
[1:03:18] possession. And he said other people
[1:03:20] make it a frolic,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; but it's not a funeral possession. And
[1:03:24] it's not a frolic. He said it's a feast.
[1:03:27] And that feast is with Christ. You see,
[1:03:30] the bride is receiving a feast with
[1:03:34] Melazdc. Just like Abraham was fed by
[1:03:38] Melazdc, so is the bride feeding on the
[1:03:42] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[1:03:45] She has received the message of the
[1:03:47] hour. Now, now if you go back in the
[1:03:49] Bible, amen, in Genesis, and you find
[1:03:51] out that when Abraham met Mekazedc, it
[1:03:54] was after the battle. It was after the
[1:03:56] battle was over and he served his
[1:03:58] servant communion.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He served him communion.
[1:04:04] Now he brought forth Melazdc brought the
[1:04:08] bread and the wine.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's like you're going
[1:04:12] to a to a party. They bring your own
[1:04:14] party. Bring your own steak party. Bring
[1:04:17] your own chicken party. And then there's
[1:04:19] just come on and eat party.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you have come to.
[1:04:23] You have come to a feast where the food
[1:04:26] has been provided. Amen. You don't have
[1:04:28] to bring your own wine to this one. You
[1:04:31] got both the bread and you got the wine.
[1:04:33] I tell you, it's the best bread and it's
[1:04:36] the best wine that a person can have.
[1:04:38] This is the BEST MEAL THAT YOU'RE EVER
[1:04:41] GOING TO EAT. MATTER OF FACT, WHEN YOU
[1:04:42] BEGIN to feed on this word, you will
[1:04:44] never BE THE SAME AGAIN. BECAUSE THE
[1:04:47] SAME ANGEL THAT MET ABRAHAM AND BROUGHT
[1:04:50] THE BREAD AND THE WINE IS THE SAME GOD
[1:04:53] THAT HAS BROUGHT THE BREAD AND THE WINE
[1:04:55] to this church. HE'S BROUGHT A WINE
[1:04:58] THAT'LL STIMULATE YOUR SOUL. HE'S
[1:05:00] BROUGHT A BREAD THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR
[1:05:02] BODY. THIS MESSAGE WILL AFFECT YOU EVERY
[1:05:05] TIME YOU eat it.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; It's the same one. Amen. He brought
[1:05:11] forth. I love that. He brought forth the
[1:05:14] bread and the wine. The same one. The
[1:05:17] same one that did it. Now, here it is.
[1:05:19] The effect of that revelation we spoke
[1:05:21] of last night. The effect of that
[1:05:23] revelation tells us who this is bringing
[1:05:25] it.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're you're Bible readers and we
[1:05:29] know we know the promise of our day is 1
[1:05:32] Thessalonians 4. Brother said, "If it
[1:05:34] not for the rapture, what promise do we
[1:05:35] have?"
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; We we don't even have a promise. this
[1:05:38] this louda this age this darkness this
[1:05:41] troubled world that we're living in what
[1:05:44] promise does the bride have amen I if
[1:05:47] it's not for the promise of rapture what
[1:05:50] would we have but God made a promise in
[1:05:53] Thessalonians that there would be a
[1:05:56] rapture of the church in 1 Thessalonians
[1:05:59] 4 the Bible says for the Lord himself
[1:06:03] amen shall descend from heaven with a
[1:06:05] shout and with a voice of the archangel
[1:06:08] and with the trump of God and the dead
[1:06:12] shall rise first. Now, if you're if
[1:06:14] you're uh looking at the age, Paul put
[1:06:17] this in there in the Thessalonians.
[1:06:19] Brother Brandham is the one that broke
[1:06:21] into the scripture in the message of the
[1:06:23] rapture and opened it for us. Remember,
[1:06:26] he said to the bride, "The rapture will
[1:06:29] be a revelation."
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "She'll be waiting on it."
[1:06:32] Well, you had to wait about three or
[1:06:34] four pages. And then he broke into it
[1:06:36] and told you the revelation laying in
[1:06:39] the rapture. The revelation. Rapture.
[1:06:41] Revelation. He told you what it was. He
[1:06:44] said, "Do you see what it is?" The shout
[1:06:46] of first Thessalonians 4 is the message.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; How many knows that to be true?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; The shout is the message of William
[1:06:55] Brandom.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that shout then therefore is
[1:06:59] going to be brother Brandham said the
[1:07:00] living bread. Do you see Christ himself
[1:07:04] is the one bringing the message? When we
[1:07:07] when we talk about this, we're going to
[1:07:09] have to we're going to have to break
[1:07:11] into a little something here because
[1:07:13] when you see the three-fold of First
[1:07:15] Thessalonians 4, you're dealing with the
[1:07:17] seventh seal. How many knows that's his
[1:07:19] coming?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; So, when Brother Man preached on the
[1:07:22] seventh seal, he said there's a
[1:07:24] three-fold revelation to it, didn't he?
[1:07:27] Now, if you say, "Brother Wayne, what's
[1:07:28] the three-fold revelation of that seven
[1:07:31] seal?" You got to go to Christ, the
[1:07:33] mystery of God reveal. And Brother Brown
[1:07:35] breaks it down in three parts. He said,
[1:07:37] "There's a revealing, there's a
[1:07:39] preeminence, and there's a taken back to
[1:07:41] Eden." So, you got a revealing, you got
[1:07:44] a preeminence, and you got a taken back.
[1:07:46] Can you see it? You got a revealing of
[1:07:48] the message, the shout. You've got a
[1:07:50] preeminence of that message in the
[1:07:52] bride, which is the voice. And then once
[1:07:55] that voice fills up in the bride,
[1:07:58] there'll be a body change and a taking
[1:08:01] back to the marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:08:03] Isn't it beautiful? Watch that adoption
[1:08:05] lay right over that seven seal. There's
[1:08:07] a revealing by a tutor. There's a
[1:08:09] preeminence of his teaching and then
[1:08:12] there's a change of the body. Didn't
[1:08:13] brother Ben say the adoption, the
[1:08:15] fullness of it is the changing of the
[1:08:17] body. Amen. Then you can see that God,
[1:08:20] Amen, is bringing us into an adoption
[1:08:22] age. YOU MEAN YOU CAN SAY IT a rapture
[1:08:25] age. You can SAY IT A BRIDE AGE. AMEN.
[1:08:28] WHATEVER wording you want to pick it.
[1:08:30] AMEN. IT'S THE SEASON WHERE THE BRIDE
[1:08:33] HAS RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM GOD THAT'LL
[1:08:36] CHANGE her mortal body. My goodness.
[1:08:39] Amen. Then we we we all of a sudden now
[1:08:42] we're going to break in the seventh seal
[1:08:43] a moment. Okay. So when we start talking
[1:08:45] about the seventh seal, we know the
[1:08:48] seven seal is in three parts. We know
[1:08:50] the seventh seal was a space of a half
[1:08:52] hour.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Now I don't have a lot of authority to
[1:08:55] say what that half hour is. I'll say
[1:08:57] this to you. The great revelation behind
[1:08:59] it is it's a process.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Now that's what we all missed, wasn't
[1:09:04] it? That it was a span of time. So when
[1:09:07] it says it was the space of a half hour,
[1:09:09] it tells you it was a span of time. Cuz
[1:09:11] when we first read, when I first always
[1:09:13] heard as a kid, Amen. I thought it was
[1:09:15] in the blink of an eye that the whole
[1:09:17] thing was going to take place. You know,
[1:09:19] Jesus would appear in the heavens and
[1:09:20] then in the blink of the eye, we'd all
[1:09:22] change and go with him. That's what I
[1:09:23] that's what I thought because that's
[1:09:25] what tradition taught. But the message
[1:09:27] of the hour is a tradition shattering
[1:09:30] message. It'll shatter every tradition
[1:09:33] that's been put upon this. Amen. So that
[1:09:36] you can see that the seven seal is a
[1:09:38] space of time. IT'S A PROCESS OF THE
[1:09:42] MESSAGE becoming life in the BELIEVERS
[1:09:44] IN THE LAST DAY. AND WE'RE LIVING IN
[1:09:47] HELL. THINGS ARE FALLING APART ALL
[1:09:49] AROUND US, BUT NOTHING'S OUT OF CONTROL.
[1:09:52] NOTHING'S OUT OF PLACE. THAT BRIDE
[1:09:54] [screaming] IS RISING UP JUST LIKE THE
[1:09:57] MESSAGE said she would be. You see, the
[1:09:59] Satan's too late, Brother Amos. We've
[1:10:01] already got the message. Satan's too
[1:10:04] late. They can ATTACK THE MESSENGER, BUT
[1:10:06] THE SEED HAS ALREADY been preached. The
[1:10:09] message HAS ALREADY BEEN GIVEN. CAN I
[1:10:10] SAY IT? AMEN. THE DOVE DELIVERED THE
[1:10:13] MESSAGE. YOU CAN KILL THE DOVE IF YOU
[1:10:15] WANT TO, BUT WE'VE GOT THE MESSAGE.
[1:10:19] It's already been given in this age.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you everything's falling apart.
[1:10:24] All these problems is everywhere. Amen.
[1:10:26] But you you see the message is going to
[1:10:28] go right on living because there's a
[1:10:29] bride receiving it as the message. It's
[1:10:32] a span of time. Amen. But you see the
[1:10:34] seven seal. Amen. It it's a accumulation
[1:10:37] of a lot of events. And you can look at
[1:10:39] things of what brother Brandham calls it
[1:10:41] on the events of his coming. But we call
[1:10:43] it we when you read about the king's
[1:10:45] sword, how many knows that's part of the
[1:10:46] seven seal? And when you read about the
[1:10:49] third pull, that's the seventh seal. You
[1:10:51] read about the tent vision, there's your
[1:10:53] seventh seal. The seven seal is the
[1:10:55] coming of the Lord. It's the headstone
[1:10:57] capping the pyramid. It's the
[1:10:59] fulfillment of the book of Revelations,
[1:11:02] the 10th chapter. Now, that's the one
[1:11:05] that is is so powerful to you and I. We
[1:11:09] can see the coming of the Lord in that
[1:11:11] king's sword. And we can see the coming
[1:11:13] of the Lord with that prophetic
[1:11:14] ministry. And we can see the coming of
[1:11:16] the Lord when it's a prophet with his
[1:11:18] back turned to the congregation. But we
[1:11:20] were not careful. Satan wants to miss
[1:11:23] wants us to miss THAT. IT'S A PART of
[1:11:26] the coming OF THE LORD OF you receiving
[1:11:28] the word and bringing IT TO LIFE IN THE
[1:11:32] AGE WE'RE living in. You are the living
[1:11:34] revelation of this word.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; A mighty angel descending into this age
[1:11:40] opens the word for the church. Now I I
[1:11:44] pray I have full liberty here. Amen. Let
[1:11:46] me let me just break into a word. Now
[1:11:49] they used to call this word by a
[1:11:50] different name and they misp
[1:11:52] mispronounced it. And I'd say many that
[1:11:55] mispronounced it also mispreached it. Uh
[1:11:58] a lot of people found the Greek word uh
[1:12:01] paraca. Amen. And and this Greek word
[1:12:04] paracia is found in 1 Thessalonians 4
[1:12:07] when it says this in the 15th verse. And
[1:12:09] we remain unto the coming of the Lord
[1:12:11] shall not prevent them which are asleeps
[1:12:13] under the coming of the Lord. Now in the
[1:12:14] Greek when they wrote that word, the
[1:12:16] word coming meant it it was it was
[1:12:19] actually said paraca. Now a lot of
[1:12:22] people took that and they did away with
[1:12:24] the literal body of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:12:26] And they made it all a spiritual thing
[1:12:28] which they missed. They missed the thing
[1:12:30] because brother Bam said the true
[1:12:32] believer believes in the corporal body
[1:12:33] of Jesus Christ and a catching away of
[1:12:35] the bride to the marriage supper of the
[1:12:36] lamb. There's a real marriage supper.
[1:12:38] There's a real physical body and we're
[1:12:40] going to meet him in the air. But watch
[1:12:42] because the happening of this time is
[1:12:45] not around the physical body. This is
[1:12:49] the spiritual body of Christ bringing a
[1:12:53] message. Amen. That's coming from
[1:12:55] himself to you and I. Now, now, now if
[1:12:58] you look at this word under the coming
[1:13:00] of the Lord, the word paraca, Amen. It
[1:13:02] actually means, and this is just a word
[1:13:04] study, Greek word study has no no other
[1:13:07] thing. Amen. It's the concept of a
[1:13:09] divine visitation.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's divine visitation. It
[1:13:15] means a coming or an arrival. It means
[1:13:17] the face or the presence. It is actually
[1:13:21] I love this one. Amen. It's properly the
[1:13:24] arrival of the owner who alone can deal
[1:13:27] with situations. Brother, if that ain't
[1:13:30] what we needed,
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; we needed the owner.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; We needed the one that owned the lamb's
[1:13:35] book.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; We needed the owner of all things. Amen.
[1:13:38] To show up. He alone can change the
[1:13:42] situation. It's a technical term that
[1:13:44] deals with the visit of a king. You mean
[1:13:47] like king of peace, the king of
[1:13:50] righteousness. Amen. It's some official
[1:13:52] or some royal visit. Do you know the
[1:13:55] word literally means beside? It means
[1:13:58] the personal presence. Now, now when you
[1:14:01] say that, Amen. We're living in a time
[1:14:04] we've BEEN PROMISED A VISITATION.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. And brother Bham takes this in a
[1:14:09] sermon. if you like to listen to his
[1:14:10] sermons. Is there anything too hard for
[1:14:13] the Lord? And he takes that sermon and
[1:14:16] he sets Abraham in the tent door and he
[1:14:18] says that must have been a hot morning
[1:14:20] and he says the cattle was thirsty. He
[1:14:23] said the lamb was dry. He said Sarah was
[1:14:25] complaining because she didn't have the
[1:14:27] latest fashion and she was upset over
[1:14:30] some things. And brother Bam said the
[1:14:32] conditions were as such to make him miss
[1:14:36] the oncoming visitation. Amen. But watch
[1:14:39] what he done. He was telling you that
[1:14:41] the conditions of Leardysia are designed
[1:14:44] by hell. Amen. To make you miss the
[1:14:47] blessing of the visitation of God in
[1:14:50] your age. Oh, but I tell you this,
[1:14:52] Abraham didn't miss his blessing.
[1:14:54] Abraham didn't miss the visitation. And
[1:14:56] brother, the bride has not MISSED THE
[1:14:59] VISITATION THAT GOD IS. I SAY I MEAN
[1:15:02] HELL MAY SEND EVERY DEVIL IT'S GOT BUT
[1:15:05] WE KNOW THE PRESENCE OF JESUS Christ
[1:15:08] anyhow. Whatever he sins BROTHER YOU'RE
[1:15:11] ABLE TO OVERCOME IT. WHATEVER COMES.
[1:15:13] AMEN. CHRIST HAS VISITED THIS generation
[1:15:16] anyhow.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the coming. It's the coming
[1:15:22] that of first Thessalonians 4
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; in the 15th verse. The coming of the
[1:15:27] Lord shall not prevent. Now, if you read
[1:15:29] it, if you read it, it would just read
[1:15:31] it's the coming of the Lord. He shall
[1:15:33] descend from heaven with a shout. The
[1:15:36] unseen one will make an arrival, an
[1:15:39] appearing, and he will give forth a
[1:15:42] message. Now, watch because that message
[1:15:45] then, now if you if you if you like to
[1:15:48] compare scriptures, I I do. Matthew the
[1:15:50] 24th chapter and the 27th verse, very
[1:15:53] familiar to you. For as the lightning
[1:15:55] cometh out of the east and shineth unto
[1:15:57] the west, so also the coming of the son
[1:16:00] of man be. Now, isn't that beautiful?
[1:16:02] Because this time it doesn't say the
[1:16:04] coming of the Lord. It said the coming
[1:16:06] of the son of man.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; So, you recognize he's talking about
[1:16:10] that Genesis 18 experience. And he's
[1:16:14] telling you it ties to 1 Thessalonians
[1:16:17] 4. Watch what he does. Until the coming
[1:16:19] of the son of man be. Now, for
[1:16:21] wheresoever the carcass is, y'all y'all
[1:16:23] know that scripture. Wheresoever the
[1:16:24] carcass is, there will the eagles be
[1:16:28] gathered.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Now, go back to 1 Thessalonians 4. He
[1:16:32] will descend from heaven with a shout.
[1:16:35] Amen. He will come from the east and
[1:16:37] west and bring forth a message. There's
[1:16:40] a coming and there's a gathering. In 1
[1:16:42] Thessalonians 4, the shout is the
[1:16:45] message that gathers the bride. In
[1:16:47] Matthew 24 and 28, there is a gathering
[1:16:51] of the bride. Then you can see that God
[1:16:54] has wrote it in different places with
[1:16:56] the same revelation. But without the
[1:16:58] revelation, there's not an ability to
[1:17:01] read what has been written. Some people
[1:17:03] say, "Well, Brother Wayne, Amen, you
[1:17:05] people can't preach the message of the
[1:17:06] hour by the Bible." If you would let me
[1:17:08] use the scriptures that was given for
[1:17:11] the message of the hour. Amen. There's
[1:17:13] plenty of scripture that backs up the
[1:17:15] message of the hour. Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; This bride, Amen, she will know her
[1:17:19] mate. It It's the revealed word of the
[1:17:22] hour. We're living in the age his coming
[1:17:25] will be in. We're living in the age his
[1:17:29] coming will be in. She will be
[1:17:30] identified. Now, if you just place that
[1:17:33] coming on his corporal body, then that
[1:17:35] coming is something way out in the
[1:17:37] future. And it will be and we're going
[1:17:39] to meet him in the air. But he's not
[1:17:41] talking about that coming. Well, it's an
[1:17:44] appearing, not a coming. BUT IF YOU
[1:17:46] FOLLOW BROTHER Brown's teachings, you
[1:17:48] see sometimes he interchanges coming and
[1:17:50] appearing without even blinking. That's
[1:17:52] right.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And sometimes he's talking about the
[1:17:55] coming of the corporal body. And
[1:17:57] sometimes he's talking about the coming
[1:17:59] of the son of man. Amen. But I thank God
[1:18:02] tonight that it uses another word. He
[1:18:05] says, "Even in the day when the son of
[1:18:07] man is revealed, what good would it do
[1:18:11] for him to be here and us not know it?"
[1:18:14] Yeah.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. But what we have had in this age
[1:18:18] IS A PROPHET OF GOD TO make the presence
[1:18:21] of God known among us. Amen. We're
[1:18:24] sitting right here tonight. Amen. And
[1:18:26] there's colors coming through this room.
[1:18:28] And there's voices coming through this
[1:18:30] room. There is another dimension here.
[1:18:32] There's all kinds of things happening.
[1:18:34] And you say, "Uh, it ain't happening."
[1:18:36] But turn on a television and you can see
[1:18:38] it's happening. Turn on a radio, you can
[1:18:41] hear it's happening. And the presence of
[1:18:43] God was coming to this age to marry a
[1:18:46] bride. And it AND GOD SENT A PROPHET
[1:18:50] AMONG US TO IDENTIFY HIS PRESENCE.
[1:18:53] THAT'S WHY brother Ram said it wasn't me
[1:18:56] that created those squirrels. He just
[1:18:59] used my voice. It wasn't me. Amen. That
[1:19:02] did that down on THE RIVER. I WAS JUST
[1:19:04] THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED. YOU'RE NOT
[1:19:06] FEEDING ON ME, THE MAN. YOU'RE FEEDING
[1:19:09] ON THE WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. Oh
[1:19:12] church. Amen. God has revealed to this
[1:19:15] age. He has brought an unveiling of who
[1:19:18] it is that is speaking. It's been
[1:19:20] uncovered. It wasn't William Brandham
[1:19:23] speaking.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Be careful the next time you call it his
[1:19:30] opinion.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody told me said, "Well, Brother
[1:19:35] Wayne, that's just Brother Bam's
[1:19:36] opinion." Will I take his opinion over
[1:19:38] your thus sayaith the Lord?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You say I got studied on that one time,
[1:19:45] brother Sean, because somebody was
[1:19:46] bumping me pretty. That's just his
[1:19:47] opinion. I think it was about shorts
[1:19:49] that people shouldn't wear shorts. You
[1:19:51] know, brother Bam said, "You if
[1:19:52] you do." And they were all tore up about
[1:19:54] it and that's just his opinion. So I got
[1:19:56] to studying opinion. Y'all got to
[1:19:59] forgive me. It's just me. I got to
[1:20:01] studying opinion and I thought, "Well,
[1:20:02] opinion has to have a source. You you
[1:20:05] get an opinion because you who you hang
[1:20:06] around with. You draw your opinions from
[1:20:09] your company and your fellowship. And I
[1:20:11] said, "Well, Brother Brand was hanging
[1:20:12] around with that angel. He was
[1:20:14] fellowshipping with that angel. So, his
[1:20:16] opinions were rooted in the presence of
[1:20:19] Almighty God." Let me give you one more.
[1:20:21] You know what a real opinion is? That's
[1:20:23] what they call the Supreme Court. When
[1:20:26] they judge something, they pass down an
[1:20:28] opinion. Well, it may be just an
[1:20:30] opinion, but it's coming from an
[1:20:32] absolute authority. And God has sent a
[1:20:35] MESSAGE WITH ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY ON WHAT
[1:20:38] THE MESSAGE IS IN THIS GENERATION. AND I
[1:20:41] HAVE RECEIVED OF GOD AN ABSOLUTE AMEN.
[1:20:44] AND IT'S UNLOCKED SOMETHING ON THE
[1:20:46] INSIDE OF ME. AMEN. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE
[1:20:49] AUTHORITY over my life. THERE'S AN
[1:20:51] ABSOLUTE OVER OUR CHURCH. THERE'S AN
[1:20:53] ABSOLUTE OVER MY FAMILY. AMEN. IT
[1:20:55] absolutely is the truth. And an absolute
[1:20:58] will produce a paradox.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; In an age where there is no absolutes,
[1:21:04] we got an absolute.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; He's here to reveal or to uncover. Amen.
[1:21:11] Now, if it was just what it was, that's
[1:21:14] one thing. But I'll tell you this, he's
[1:21:17] still here. The prophet of God said, "I
[1:21:19] am my message is to declare him he's
[1:21:21] here." Well, let me say he's still here.
[1:21:24] When the spirit of truth, when he shall
[1:21:26] come, he shall lead you and guide you
[1:21:29] into all truth. He is still here. HE IS
[1:21:33] STILL LEADING. HE'S STILL ACTING. HE'S
[1:21:35] STILL MOVING. Who do you think gets a
[1:21:37] hold of your pastor and preaches that
[1:21:39] sermon? Who is it that uses that
[1:21:41] evangelist? Who is it that moves to the
[1:21:43] church? Who is it that amens the word?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. WHO IS IT THAT AMENS THE WORD?
[1:21:49] THAT'S NOT YOU. THAT'S AN ATTRIBUTE OR A
[1:21:51] GENE THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU THAT
[1:21:53] RECOGNIZES THE WORD AND THE WORD IS
[1:21:56] COMING TO THE WORD AND IT'S WAKING
[1:21:58] SOMETHING up in you.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He's still here.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; He's still in He's still in the bride,
[1:22:08] manifesting through the channel. He
[1:22:12] promised to do it.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; In the shout the brother said in the
[1:22:16] bride uh the rapture, Amen. He says it
[1:22:19] here. does all three things. Amen. Just
[1:22:22] before he appears, Jesus, a shout does
[1:22:24] all three things. He's descending. A
[1:22:26] shout is a shout. It's the message going
[1:22:29] forth. The living bread bringing forth
[1:22:31] the bride. Watch what he called it. The
[1:22:32] living bread. What did Melazdc bring?
[1:22:35] Bread. What was the opening them seals?
[1:22:38] Bread.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; What kind of bread? Living bread.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Unleavened bread.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Uncorrupted bread. Untouched bread.
[1:22:46] Undenominated word. You hear the Bible
[1:22:49] says it. Amen. Watch in 1 Thessalonians,
[1:22:51] he deals with it. But in 1 Corinthians
[1:22:54] the 15th chapter when he talks about our
[1:22:56] body change, he said this corruptible
[1:22:58] shall PUT ON INCORRUPTION. HOW YOU GOING
[1:23:00] TO DO THAT? What message are you going
[1:23:03] to take that don't have corruption?
[1:23:05] It'll have to be one THAT COME FROM GOD.
[1:23:08] It'll never come out of no book. You'll
[1:23:10] never bring [laughter]
[1:23:11] You'll never bring it out of no
[1:23:12] denomination or no school. It's
[1:23:14] contaminated.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; That's right, Lord. But he brought a
[1:23:18] message from God.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, the purity of this message, the
[1:23:22] purity of this word.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; And now, now when I say that, you have
[1:23:26] to pay attention because brother Bam
[1:23:28] said he does all three.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The same God that brought the purity of
[1:23:33] this message is the same God in you
[1:23:36] accepting this message.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Don't you think the voice is separate
[1:23:41] from the shout? He does all three of
[1:23:44] them. The same one that brought the
[1:23:46] message is living in the bride,
[1:23:48] receiving the message and manifesting
[1:23:51] the message.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. That's what's working
[1:23:54] in you. It's the living bread
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; bringing forth the bread and the wine.
[1:24:00] Now, in Genesis 14, you can read about
[1:24:02] it. It's the 17th verse down to the
[1:24:04] 24th. And you can read how that the king
[1:24:08] uh uh uh Melkazedc appears unto Abraham.
[1:24:11] And when he appears unto Abraham, Amen,
[1:24:14] he brings the wine and the bread. It's
[1:24:18] communion because, see, the battle's
[1:24:19] over. Amen. It It's It's already been
[1:24:22] whipped out. And And when he brings
[1:24:24] this, what's he doing? He's bringing him
[1:24:28] the bread of communion.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He brought it. I I I don't have enough
[1:24:33] time to preach the real realities, but
[1:24:35] I'll just maybe touch it. You remember
[1:24:38] brother Brandham when he goes up on the
[1:24:40] mountain and he that is in you and he
[1:24:42] says he comes down out of that storm and
[1:24:44] hears that voice talk to him and he said
[1:24:46] I had a sandwich in my shirt and he said
[1:24:48] well I thought I'd just stop and eat
[1:24:50] that sandwich. You know what I'm talking
[1:24:51] about, brother Mark. You go out there in
[1:24:52] them mountains and you make that
[1:24:54] sandwich in the morning cuz you're going
[1:24:55] to be in the mountain all day if you up
[1:24:56] there walking and you can make that
[1:24:58] sandwich and you can do your best. Put
[1:24:59] in your backpack, put in your shirt.
[1:25:01] Brother Ram had it in his shirt. Can you
[1:25:02] imagine? He said it was all sogged and
[1:25:04] mashed together, you know. Amen. because
[1:25:07] he was carrying the bread with him.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; You you see that when you you can't car
[1:25:12] Abraham couldn't have went and fought
[1:25:14] that battle and went and did all that
[1:25:16] and come back carrying bread that would
[1:25:20] not have been affected by the battle he
[1:25:22] was in
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; or by the situation of his life. You do
[1:25:25] you see what I'm talking about? Your
[1:25:27] family somehow would get into that. Your
[1:25:29] your ideas, your mentality, those
[1:25:32] things, the things that brother Brandon
[1:25:34] was bringing us. Amen. He didn't bring
[1:25:37] them himself. They were brought from
[1:25:40] God.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; When Melkazedc met Abraham, he had fresh
[1:25:45] bread. Amen. The only journey it had
[1:25:48] made was FROM ETERNITY TO TIME. AMEN. IT
[1:25:52] HAD BEEN BROUGHT FROM DIRECTLY from the
[1:25:54] hands of God uncontaminated.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; That's the way I eat this message.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I eat it uncontaminated. Amen. I eat it
[1:26:05] as the as the presence. Now, now if
[1:26:07] you're an Old Testament reader and you
[1:26:10] read about the Old Testament and you
[1:26:11] know about the about the uh about the
[1:26:13] tabernacle and the wilderness and you
[1:26:15] can see the levels, you know, the holies
[1:26:17] of holies, nobody could go in there but
[1:26:18] one time a year and it was the high
[1:26:20] priest and he went and anointed. Now,
[1:26:22] the presence of God was behind that
[1:26:25] badger skin.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; And they had bread in the second veil.
[1:26:29] They had bread in the outer court. Now,
[1:26:31] that bread was called shoebre. It was
[1:26:33] actually the holy place, not the holies
[1:26:35] of holies. But they had bread in there
[1:26:37] and they actually called it showbread,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Or the bread of his presence
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; or the bread of his face. This bread was
[1:26:47] what they were eating in the visible
[1:26:51] because there was a God in the
[1:26:53] invisible. So they sat there and there
[1:26:57] was some presence behind that veil and
[1:26:59] they were eating bread that had to be
[1:27:01] baked to prove there was something back
[1:27:03] there. Do you see? When they'd eat it up
[1:27:05] and break it. Amen. They would do it for
[1:27:08] the purpose there's something back
[1:27:09] there. You can't see it, but this bread
[1:27:12] is proof that the presence of God is
[1:27:14] behind that veil. Now, if you went
[1:27:16] behind the veil, back in behind that
[1:27:19] veil, there was the the ten commandments
[1:27:21] that had been written by the hand of
[1:27:22] God. And they were laid in the ark of
[1:27:25] the covenant. Remember that? And they
[1:27:27] were laid in the ark of the covenant.
[1:27:28] So, that was the word. And it was in the
[1:27:30] ark. And brother man said, "Now watch,
[1:27:32] the pillar of fire stayed over that
[1:27:34] word."
[1:27:36] But the priest would come in and he
[1:27:39] would then sprinkle the blood upon the
[1:27:42] ark of the covenant. He said, "There you
[1:27:44] go. There's your seed. gets the word.
[1:27:46] There's your light, the pillar of fire,
[1:27:48] and the sprinkling of that blood, he
[1:27:51] said, was the spirit life.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; So, as the as those three things hit
[1:27:57] together, it ripened something that come
[1:28:00] out of that holies of holies and it was
[1:28:03] called shoebre and they eat it. So now,
[1:28:06] Brother Bam is trying to show you that
[1:28:08] there's there's things that's been
[1:28:10] laying in the Bible that needed the
[1:28:13] presence of the pillar of fire and it
[1:28:16] needed the spirit of God to bring it out
[1:28:19] of scripture so you could eat it.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; You see? Amen. Until it's manifest, the
[1:28:24] bride could eat it because you know true
[1:28:26] interpretation of the words to manifest
[1:28:27] it or bring it to pass. Now, now,
[1:28:29] Brother Bam, in the unveiling of God,
[1:28:31] and I I don't want to get too deep in
[1:28:32] this. I I pray I don't get too too deep
[1:28:34] on this on you, but Amen. Brother Bam
[1:28:36] says it like this. He said, "Now watch.
[1:28:38] That shoe bread was believer's food.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; It was only for the believer." Now, what
[1:28:43] was it? It was shoebre that was brought
[1:28:46] forth. Now, you said bring forth.
[1:28:48] Brother B said to reveal it is to bring
[1:28:52] it forth.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; When you reveal the word, it brings it
[1:28:56] forth. Mechazedc brought forth the bread
[1:29:00] and the wine. Now what's he done in this
[1:29:03] age? When the son of man will reveal the
[1:29:06] scripture, he is bringing forth the
[1:29:09] bread and the wine. That is the
[1:29:11] provision of the church in the last day.
[1:29:14] What is it? It is a command for the
[1:29:16] church. Then to feed on the message the
[1:29:19] same as Abraham ate with Melazdc. When
[1:29:22] you're eating the message of the hour,
[1:29:25] you are feeding on the presence of God
[1:29:28] because that's the unseen force. But the
[1:29:31] bread you're eating is the revelation of
[1:29:33] his word.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I I I just love the scripture. Now, when
[1:29:37] you get into this, you get into that
[1:29:38] seventh seal, then that's Revelations
[1:29:41] 10, right?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Now, if if you're if you like
[1:29:44] Revelations 10, how many knows you're
[1:29:46] John
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; in the book of Revelations?
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; You're the believer.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; In Revelations 10, there's there's
[1:29:52] there's a couple things happening.
[1:29:55] Number one, John is seeing a mighty
[1:29:58] angel descending out of heaven.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Just what happened in 1 Thessalonians 4,
[1:30:04] he's watching a mighty angel descend out
[1:30:06] of heaven. And as he's descending out of
[1:30:08] heaven, he has a book open in his hand.
[1:30:12] And John sees this. He sees a mighty
[1:30:14] angel bringing the word to a prophet.
[1:30:18] That's what he sees. Amen. It's a
[1:30:20] powerful thing because it's the seven
[1:30:22] seal. the word coming to a prophet.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Look at the beauty of that. Y'all, you
[1:30:27] ever wonder who that angel was? Brother
[1:30:28] Ram said that that notable one, that
[1:30:31] notable angel up there. Somebody said, I
[1:30:33] always wondered what it was. The other
[1:30:35] day I was reading and brother Bam says
[1:30:37] he came to me. That is the seven seal. I
[1:30:41] said, "Oh my goodness." Then that was
[1:30:43] Christ bringing the word to a prophet.
[1:30:46] That's the seventh seal. That angel was
[1:30:48] none other than the covenant angel from
[1:30:50] Revelations the 10th chapter. Look what
[1:30:52] he's doing. He's bringing the word to a
[1:30:55] prophet. And John saw that. But the John
[1:30:58] that saw it was then commanded to take
[1:31:01] the book and eat that book.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And it was the eating of that book.
[1:31:07] Amen. That was going to change John.
[1:31:10] Now, when he began to eat it, I I spoke
[1:31:12] shortly last night. I want to continue
[1:31:14] this just for a moment. When you eat
[1:31:16] something, it's a miracle because you
[1:31:18] don't think about it. I don't think
[1:31:19] about it. It's just a paradox. You eat
[1:31:20] it and it and it turns into life. That's
[1:31:22] all you know. But but what it does is it
[1:31:25] don't change who you are. It just makes
[1:31:27] you develop in what you already are. Now
[1:31:30] when when I I've got to do this in case
[1:31:33] uh just just for subject matter, but but
[1:31:35] you think about uh you think about the
[1:31:37] food you eat, your food does not change
[1:31:41] the individual. So in other words, let
[1:31:43] me just say uh that you have the son of
[1:31:45] of brother Sean, sister Heather. Amen.
[1:31:48] Now what's happened is that they each
[1:31:50] one gave to their son a certain
[1:31:53] instruction a certain kind of trait that
[1:31:55] come from their family. Sometimes you
[1:31:57] see the father sometimes you see the
[1:31:58] mother but but it's because that it
[1:32:00] comes from both side. Now if I say trait
[1:32:03] that speaks of what is passed from
[1:32:06] parents down to their children.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I see the father in him. I see the
[1:32:10] daughter in him.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; All right. Now when when that is coming
[1:32:13] down into the into the person it's
[1:32:16] called a trait. But it comes from what
[1:32:19] we call a gene. Now the word gene was
[1:32:21] not really relevant until the late part
[1:32:24] of the 40s and then brother Random
[1:32:26] himself started using it in the 1960s.
[1:32:29] Now a gene is only what it is. It's just
[1:32:32] DNA but it's talking about a block of
[1:32:34] your DNA. So like if you have a a
[1:32:36] stretch of DNA, if you just took one
[1:32:38] stretch of your DNA at six foot tall,
[1:32:40] just one stretch. And that 6' tall
[1:32:43] stretch has many genes in it that
[1:32:45] determine your hair color, your size
[1:32:47] color, uh everything that you are. It
[1:32:49] has your instruction manual. But until
[1:32:52] you eat something, the instructions
[1:32:55] never come out into the life. You got to
[1:32:58] eat something before your DNA does you
[1:33:01] any good. You you you could have
[1:33:02] genetics in you the greatest the
[1:33:05] greatest champion in the world but till
[1:33:08] you begin to eat something you have no
[1:33:11] ability to use what potential is on the
[1:33:15] inside of you. Now of course amen when
[1:33:17] we say this word DNA is pretty powerful
[1:33:19] if you like to study these kind of
[1:33:21] things. Amen. That DNA actually was uh
[1:33:24] was discovered a bit in the late 1800s
[1:33:26] but it wasn't really broke into until
[1:33:29] 1953.
[1:33:31] That's significant, isn't it? 1953 gave
[1:33:34] us the invention or the discovery of
[1:33:37] DNA. It also gave us looking under the
[1:33:39] unseen demonology. Amen. The unseen
[1:33:43] world become greatly important in the
[1:33:46] 50s through a prophet of God to the
[1:33:49] church while DNA became the spiritual
[1:33:52] natural side of the tree of life. And
[1:33:55] and scientists started breaking into it.
[1:33:57] And it's pretty powerful because DNA
[1:33:59] then actually is just the genetical
[1:34:02] model or instruction of your life. You
[1:34:05] know, it's in every cell in your body.
[1:34:07] Whether the cells in your hair or in
[1:34:09] your big toe, the same instruction is in
[1:34:12] every cell that's in your body. Now, now
[1:34:15] when you talk about DNA, and I'm I'm
[1:34:16] going to I'm going to bring this to
[1:34:18] something that DNA in you, they find out
[1:34:22] that it has four letters. They just they
[1:34:24] just gave it fourletter alphabet. your
[1:34:25] English letter uh has 26. So like ABC D
[1:34:29] all the way to Z, you know. Amen. That
[1:34:31] that 26 letters, you take them and they
[1:34:34] can make a bunch of words. Those words
[1:34:37] are stacked up in a dictionary. All
[1:34:39] right? There's four letters in a DNA.
[1:34:42] Those four letters can only be put
[1:34:45] together so many ways.
[1:34:47] So what they do is they call it they
[1:34:49] call it a book of life or a genome. and
[1:34:52] they have discovered so like if you like
[1:34:54] when you get the dictionary wrote and
[1:34:56] you say well the the the letters can
[1:34:58] only be put together so many ways the
[1:35:00] code of DNA was broke in 1966.
[1:35:05] So in other words from the ' 40s till
[1:35:08] 1966
[1:35:09] they were trying to break in to what the
[1:35:12] DNA was. They were trying to discover
[1:35:16] what DNA is what what DNA does and they
[1:35:19] were they kept breaking into it. But in
[1:35:21] 1966, they solved the code. Amen. In
[1:35:26] other words, from 1966 until the day
[1:35:28] we're living right now, there has been
[1:35:31] no more discoveries on the unfolding of
[1:35:34] what it is. They have now just put it in
[1:35:36] use. So what it did, it opened up a
[1:35:39] field under the scientists. They got
[1:35:41] through medical and they're using it in
[1:35:43] every kind. They're using it in
[1:35:45] investigations. They're using it in
[1:35:46] hereditary
[1:35:48] 23 and me. They're using it in all kinds
[1:35:51] of different areas. Amen. Because
[1:35:53] they're no longer trying to break the
[1:35:55] code. They're now using it in life.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see a message of the hour come on
[1:36:01] the scene and a prophet opened up this
[1:36:03] message? Amen. And God solved the thing
[1:36:06] for you and I. So today, preachers are
[1:36:09] not coming to the platform trying to
[1:36:11] open up the mystery of what it is. WE
[1:36:14] HAVE BROUGHT IT IN A PLACE THAT IT
[1:36:16] SHOULD BE PUT INTO the use of the bride
[1:36:19] of Jesus Christ. It ought to be WALKING
[1:36:21] POWER. IT OUGHT TO BE LIBERATING POWER.
[1:36:24] IT OUGHT TO BE STRENGTH IN YOUR BODY.
[1:36:26] But only when you begin to feed on it.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; When you begin to feed on it, it begins
[1:36:33] to open up the traits. How many knows,
[1:36:34] brother Brandham said, when we near the
[1:36:36] headstone, this bride will have his
[1:36:38] potentials. The potential or the traits
[1:36:41] of almighty God is laying in every
[1:36:45] believer sitting in this building.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; The potential to change dimensions are
[1:36:51] already INSIDE YOU TONIGHT. YOU DON'T
[1:36:54] HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU JUST HAVE TO
[1:36:57] EAT the message of the hour and it will
[1:36:59] do the work for you.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I I just I just think about me
[1:37:03] being a human being, being my mom and
[1:37:04] dad's son. Amen. I never had try to be
[1:37:07] that. After I had a birth, I just
[1:37:09] started eating and and when I eat, I
[1:37:11] begin to develop and begin to mature and
[1:37:13] I become exactly what my DNA was. Do you
[1:37:17] recognize why are we trying so hard to
[1:37:20] be something that God ALREADY MADE US?
[1:37:22] WHY ARE WE ALWAYS working so hard to be
[1:37:25] something we are? Amen. It puts us under
[1:37:28] weary, puts us under stress. But if we
[1:37:31] WOULD RELAX OURSELVES AND JUST BEGIN to
[1:37:33] eat the MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, YOU ARE
[1:37:36] ALREADY BRIDE. YOU ARE ALREADY WHAT GOD
[1:37:39] MADE YOU TO BE. But when you begin to
[1:37:41] feed on the word, it begins to unlock
[1:37:44] the things that God has put inside of
[1:37:46] you. I I I I mean I I just got to I just
[1:37:49] got to studying on this thing and it's
[1:37:51] amazing because they actually have a
[1:37:53] book. You know, they call it the book of
[1:37:54] life. It's it's actually a book of of
[1:37:57] all of the genomes of what DNA. So if
[1:38:00] they're if they're looking at your DNA
[1:38:02] and there's a pair of the ATS and the
[1:38:04] CGs and it's arranged a certain way,
[1:38:07] they can say, "Oh, that'll turn out to
[1:38:08] be cancer one day, they can study your
[1:38:11] DNA and tell you before you get cancer
[1:38:13] because it's in your it's in your it's
[1:38:15] in your script. It's in your
[1:38:16] instruction." Amen. I think there was a
[1:38:19] famous Angelia Jolina one I think it was
[1:38:21] her.
[1:38:23] I'm not sure. I think it was her, but
[1:38:25] they one of them they found breast
[1:38:26] cancer in in they went in and she didn't
[1:38:30] have cancer, but she had the gene that
[1:38:32] would produce cancer eventually. They
[1:38:34] didn't know you get it in 5 years or 10
[1:38:36] years. So, she preventively already had
[1:38:39] stuff did so that she wouldn't ever
[1:38:41] develop that in her body because genes
[1:38:45] are actually so real that they can
[1:38:48] prevent diseases before they ever
[1:38:50] happened. Amen. Do you recognize that we
[1:38:53] have a book? And in that book, it can
[1:38:55] detail the characteristics of your life
[1:38:58] and tell you where you're going and what
[1:39:00] you're doing. Before you ever get there,
[1:39:03] God can predict your future.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Because it's already in you.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Now, I I think it's powerful
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; because on the DNA, amen, of certain
[1:39:13] people, it's written, you know, me and
[1:39:15] you share a DNA something probably
[1:39:17] similar. You're probably somewhere from
[1:39:18] Europe cuz it's that little short DNA,
[1:39:20] you know. Amen. We ain't going to get
[1:39:22] very tall. And and I don't care what
[1:39:24] kind of food you eat. Amen. I I often
[1:39:26] say I'll get bigger, but it ain't going
[1:39:27] to get taller. Amen. I can grow, but
[1:39:30] I'll never grow taller. Amen. Do you see
[1:39:32] the DNA either is your potential or your
[1:39:35] limitation?
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And there's a limitation that is set
[1:39:39] upon you. Do you know Brother Bram said
[1:39:40] this bride can't fail?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know HE SAID THAT THAT first Eve
[1:39:44] fell by the word, but there's coming
[1:39:47] another Eve that will never fall. Come
[1:39:50] on, CHURCH. THERE IS A a limit to what
[1:39:52] you can do. YOU CAN NEVER FAIL BECAUSE
[1:39:55] GOD HAS SO SET THE THING. YOU CANNOT
[1:39:59] commit adultery.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'LL NEVER COMMIT ADULTERY. IT'S
[1:40:04] WRITTEN ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. YOU CAN'T
[1:40:07] COMMIT adultery because the seed is
[1:40:09] already in you. You can't fail. The seed
[1:40:11] is already in you. Amen. It's written on
[1:40:14] the genetics of your life. There is
[1:40:16] limitations. Amen. And there is
[1:40:18] potential. Look at that potential laying
[1:40:21] there. He said there'll be overcomers in
[1:40:23] the last days. There's some overcomers
[1:40:25] sitting here tonight. And you can
[1:40:27] overcome anything the devil can throw at
[1:40:29] you. It's already written in the
[1:40:31] scriptures. Amen. He that overcomemeth
[1:40:33] what I grant is sit with me in my
[1:40:35] throne. You've got potential to rule.
[1:40:38] You got potential to rule IN THE COMING
[1:40:40] LIFE. BUT YOU GOT POTENTIAL to rule
[1:40:42] tonight. Amen. YOU GOT POTENTIAL TO RULE
[1:40:46] over the devil, OVER THE FLESH, AND OVER
[1:40:48] THIS WORLD. The ruling potential is in
[1:40:51] you. Now, if you're eating the wrong
[1:40:53] foods, it never unlocks it, right? Shuts
[1:40:57] that down, don't it? Y'all know what I'm
[1:40:58] talking about. You You start looking at
[1:41:00] the wrong things, you start eating the
[1:41:02] wrong things, you start listening to the
[1:41:04] wrong things, and it starts taking away
[1:41:06] that dominion, right? Amen. And so, you
[1:41:08] ain't nothing. You can't do nothing.
[1:41:10] You'll never go nowhere. You'll never be
[1:41:12] nobody. You eat on that a while and you
[1:41:14] can't get your head up. Amen. Because
[1:41:16] the devil knows how to lock your
[1:41:18] potential with what you're eating.
[1:41:20] That's why he's feeding this world with
[1:41:23] all of his demonic powers and influences
[1:41:26] of this age. Amen. But you know when
[1:41:28] when when I say these things, you know
[1:41:30] that actually is epigenetic. And there's
[1:41:32] a big study being done right now because
[1:41:35] they actually say uh uh that the food
[1:41:37] you eat. They said what it is is like
[1:41:39] okay like your uh your your your body is
[1:41:42] a piano. Your gen your genetics your DNA
[1:41:44] is a piano. The food you eat is the
[1:41:46] pianist. So when your food comes in the
[1:41:50] certain kinds of foods can unlock
[1:41:51] certain things. So like if a pianist is
[1:41:54] reading music the piano's the same
[1:41:56] right? But it makes one key sound
[1:41:58] louder. Like if he hit if a guy hits a
[1:42:00] certain key and that key is louder and
[1:42:02] the other one's light. Your food is
[1:42:04] doing that. It doesn't change the
[1:42:06] keyboard, it changes what's coming off
[1:42:08] of it. And and the message that you're
[1:42:11] devouring is determining what kind of
[1:42:14] life is SOUNDING OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN.
[1:42:18] YOU START EATING the wrong things and it
[1:42:20] quietens THAT NOTE OF SUPREME RULER OF
[1:42:23] POWER. IT QUIETENS THAT NOTE. AMEN. and
[1:42:26] all. It's still there,
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; but it just quietly sounds.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; But you got it in you anyhow. It's
[1:42:32] written right there on the gene right
[1:42:34] there. Right there close to that
[1:42:35] overcomer, brother Will. Amen. Right
[1:42:37] there. There's that serpent stompings.
[1:42:39] It's right there. And they shall tread
[1:42:41] upon the head of serpents and scorpions.
[1:42:44] Amen. And every unclean thing, it's
[1:42:45] written there. Now, if you get the wrong
[1:42:48] message and people say, "Well, that was
[1:42:50] for days gone past and and that ain't
[1:42:52] for us no more and miracles ain't for
[1:42:54] the bride no more." You see what it
[1:42:55] does? It quietens. Amen. It quietens
[1:42:58] that hand of the supernatural that ought
[1:43:01] to MAKE IT RING OUT OF THE BRIDE OF
[1:43:03] CHRIST. BUT BROTHER, I BELIEVE IN A
[1:43:05] GOSPEL THAT'LL OPEN UP THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:43:07] ELEMENT OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:43:10] BROTHER, let me tell you something
[1:43:11] tonight. You got an authority in you.
[1:43:13] You can walk on the head of every devil.
[1:43:15] Every devil IN HELL HAS BEEN PLACED
[1:43:18] UNDER THIS BRIDE. You can walk on the
[1:43:20] head of that demon. It's got no rights
[1:43:22] here. It's got no powers here. Amen. And
[1:43:25] if you get to listening TO THE RIGHT
[1:43:27] MESSAGES, AMEN, YOU'LL FIND an anointing
[1:43:29] that comes in your life THAT'LL GIVE YOU
[1:43:32] AUTHORITY OVER EVERY DEVIL, OVER EVERY
[1:43:35] POWER.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And they shall tread upon the
[1:43:40] head of serpents. You are genetically
[1:43:42] designed by Almighty God to walk on the
[1:43:44] head of devils and not get hurt.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. YOU'RE DESIGNED TO do it.
[1:43:50] YOU'RE DESIGNED. THAT'S RIGHT THERE on
[1:43:52] your right there on your jean. You're an
[1:43:54] eagle, sister. You're an eagle, right?
[1:43:56] And it means they fly higher than any
[1:43:58] other bird. That's who I am. I'm going
[1:44:00] to get higher than Leodysia. I'M GOING
[1:44:02] TO GET HIGHER THAN THE WORLD. I'M GOING
[1:44:04] TO GET HIGHER THAN THIS AGE AND ALL OF
[1:44:07] ITS TROUBLE. IT'S ON MY GENETICS,
[1:44:09] BROTHER. AND I GOT A MESSAGE THAT SAYS
[1:44:11] YOU'RE BORN FOR IT. YOU'RE DESIGNED FOR
[1:44:14] IT. YOU'RE ANOINTED FOR IT. YOU'RE THE
[1:44:16] BRIDE of Jesus Christ. It's written
[1:44:19] right there. [laughter] Amen. If you
[1:44:21] could pull out my DNA, my spiritual DNA,
[1:44:23] you could do it because it's written in
[1:44:25] the Bible, too.
[1:44:29] So, well, Brother Wayne, what are you
[1:44:31] really talking about? I'm talking about
[1:44:32] what you eat,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; how it determines your your your how
[1:44:36] your piano plays. It determines how your
[1:44:39] life lives.
[1:44:41] Things that are written in you, Amen,
[1:44:43] can be quietened and they can be prayed
[1:44:46] louder. You you take you take good
[1:44:47] worship, good praising people. How many
[1:44:49] like to praise the Lord? I mean, really,
[1:44:51] y'all like to worship the Lord. You
[1:44:52] know, I know some of y'all I've been in
[1:44:54] church with you really like to worship
[1:44:55] the Lord. You you get to listening to
[1:44:58] the wrong voices and it'll quieten that
[1:45:00] one. You know, they get to saying,
[1:45:02] "Well, it's just a bunch of emotion."
[1:45:05] Oh, they're just excited. They It's
[1:45:07] emotionalism. They get up there and beat
[1:45:09] the drums and get the people excited and
[1:45:11] and you know, and and what they'll do is
[1:45:13] they'll feed the church. They might take
[1:45:16] a part of a quote but not the intent of
[1:45:18] the quote.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to be balanced.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; You got to be balanced. If a person has
[1:45:24] good balance, brother John, do you know
[1:45:26] a good balance? You you can you can
[1:45:29] stand on one foot if you got good
[1:45:31] balance. So when you hear a quote that's
[1:45:35] one-sided, if you got balance, it won't
[1:45:37] throw you off your feet.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when somebody gets up and reads
[1:45:41] a quote that makes it sound like, Amen.
[1:45:44] Don't lose your balance. You're balanced
[1:45:46] people. You know exactly what truth is.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; But Satan would quieten your worship.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD QUIETEN THAT PART of you that
[1:45:56] wants to worship God and wants to lift
[1:45:58] your hands and praise him. So he'll put
[1:46:00] an ever dirty name on it. He'll cause
[1:46:02] impersonators to rise up. He'll raise up
[1:46:04] ministers who are angels, transform
[1:46:07] themselves into angels of light, but
[1:46:08] they'll be dead men. Amen. There'll be
[1:46:11] doctors of divinity trying to put out
[1:46:14] the presence of God.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. Devil still talk, folks.
[1:46:18] And it's the seed of the serpent. It's
[1:46:20] it's it's brother Bam called it. He said
[1:46:22] the seed of discrepancy. Amen. To preach
[1:46:25] the Holy Ghost was for another age. Do
[1:46:27] you see what it'll do? IT'LL START
[1:46:29] QUIETENING THAT SIDE. IT'LL START
[1:46:32] HUSHING DOWN the moving of the Holy
[1:46:34] Ghost because of what some intellectual
[1:46:36] has to say. And if you start feeding on
[1:46:39] that mess, it won't be long. You know,
[1:46:41] they'll start preaching against certain
[1:46:42] songs or certain directions. And brother
[1:46:44] Kevin, you hear that song come across
[1:46:46] the church. Amen. And people will get
[1:46:48] tight
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; because Dr. So and So Bishop So and So
[1:46:53] ain't there to say it's okay. I pray to
[1:46:55] God we don't have to have men that come
[1:46:58] and tell us what song we can sing, what
[1:47:00] song we can't sing. We ain't got no need
[1:47:02] for bishops in this message. We need to
[1:47:05] let THE PRESENCE OF GOD UNLOCK THE
[1:47:07] WORSHIP IN THE CHURCH AND THE ANOINTING
[1:47:10] OF GOD GET A HOLD OF THE BRIDE AND GIVE
[1:47:12] WORSHIP BACK TO GOD.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; OH, I believe in it. I believe in it.
[1:47:19] You say, "Preacher, what are you talking
[1:47:20] about?" I'm talking about if there is
[1:47:22] foods that can quieten it, there's foods
[1:47:24] that can engage it. There's foods
[1:47:26] that'll open it up.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. There's good places. You go
[1:47:30] read Psalms 150 and tell me you
[1:47:32] shouldn't dance in the church. You read
[1:47:34] Psalms 150 and tell me we shouldn't have
[1:47:37] music in the church. You read Psalms 150
[1:47:40] sometimes. Read the quotes. Read what
[1:47:42] Brother Brandham says. Brother Brandham
[1:47:44] said, "Oh, I tell you this." He said,
[1:47:45] "Any religion without emotion is dead
[1:47:48] and anything dead needs buried." Amen. I
[1:47:51] tell you what, tonight I'm not dead. I'm
[1:47:53] alive and I got SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE
[1:47:55] OF ME. AMEN. I STILL BELIEVE THIS
[1:47:58] MESSAGE. I STILL BELIEVE IN WORSHIP AND
[1:48:00] THE POWER OF GOD. YOU LET ALL THE DEVILS
[1:48:03] DO WHATEVER they want to. I'M GOING TO
[1:48:05] WORSHIP THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I'm going to
[1:48:07] do it IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMY.
[1:48:11] I believe I believe we are to feed the
[1:48:13] people something that'll BRING LIFE AND
[1:48:16] STRENGTH and anointing upon their lives.
[1:48:18] I believe we ought to be able to praise
[1:48:20] God. I believe we ought to praise him IN
[1:48:22] SUCH A PLACE, AMEN, THAT WE RECOGNIZE
[1:48:25] WE'RE NOT JUST eating bread. We're
[1:48:27] drinking the wine OF MELAZDC, WHICH
[1:48:29] WOULD MAKE a man drunk.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'll tell you what, plain
[1:48:34] and sensible. We ought not act like a
[1:48:36] bunch of people. Brother Bam said it. He
[1:48:38] said the revelation of the word would
[1:48:40] bring a stimulation that would affect
[1:48:42] you the same as natural wine affects a
[1:48:45] man drinking it. the preaching OF THE
[1:48:47] GOSPEL OR TO GET SO WONDERFUL IN THE
[1:48:49] CHURCH UNTIL IT'S LIKE DRINKING WINE.
[1:48:52] YOU LOSE YOUR CARES, YOU LOSE YOUR
[1:48:54] PRESENCE, YOU LOSE YOUR PRIDE, AND YOU
[1:48:57] GET INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN JUST
[1:48:59] WORSHIP GOD. You said, "Preacher, how
[1:49:01] far we are to go." Amen. I'm afraid we
[1:49:03] might go too far. Brother said, "That's
[1:49:05] all people want to talk about is who
[1:49:07] didn't go to they didn't they went too
[1:49:09] far." He said, "Denying the millions
[1:49:12] that never went far enough.
[1:49:18] I think we ought to eat something and
[1:49:20] make us feel like getting up in the
[1:49:21] mornings.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. We ought to be able to
[1:49:27] eat on something. Some food that'll turn
[1:49:30] on some praise jeans.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You built to do it. You built to do it
[1:49:35] cuz God built you for worship. God loves
[1:49:37] worship. He built the bride for worship.
[1:49:40] How many knows that you WERE DESIGNED
[1:49:42] FOR WORSHIP? THAT GOD that you serve
[1:49:45] loves worship.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, amen. He ain't
[1:49:49] going to have to go to no angel to get
[1:49:51] the worship that belongs to him. I'm not
[1:49:53] giving it TO THE DEVIL. I'M NOT GIVING
[1:49:55] it to the world. I WAS CALLED TO
[1:49:57] WORSHIP. I WAS ANOINTED TO WORSHIP. I AM
[1:50:00] A MEMBER OF THE BRIDE OF JESUS.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, folks. He don't want
[1:50:06] no blessing bride. He wants one that can
[1:50:08] go in the presence.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; One that can walk in there. Amen. to
[1:50:12] where they can feel the presence of God,
[1:50:15] the anointing of God. MY JUST WAIT OFF
[1:50:18] IN THERE. BROTHER BRAM SAID, "You ought
[1:50:19] to worship till you get to the place you
[1:50:21] don't even know your own name."
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, they really call
[1:50:26] him a fanatic, wouldn't they? That
[1:50:28] Brother Bam done lost his mind. All he
[1:50:30] wants to preach about is worship.
[1:50:31] Brother Bam said, "We ought to get so
[1:50:32] drunk until we don't even KNOW OUR OWN
[1:50:35] NAME." WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU even had
[1:50:37] a buzz?
[1:50:39] COME ON. WHEN'S the last time people got
[1:50:40] enough buzz just to lift their hand or
[1:50:43] clap THEIR HANDS OR HOLLER AMEN? I THINK
[1:50:45] WE OUGHT TO BYPASS THE BUZZ AND GET
[1:50:48] DRUNK ON THE ANOINTING OF GOD UNTIL THE
[1:50:51] PRESENCE OF GOD BREAKS INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:50:54] BROTHER, I want the WORD. I DO, TOO. BUT
[1:50:56] I WANT A WORD THAT'LL TURN ON
[1:50:58] [screaming] THE PRAISE GENE ON THE
[1:51:00] INSIDE OF A BELIEVER TODAY.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; HEY, HEY, HEY. Somebody said, "Well,
[1:51:05] Brother Wayne, hey man, I tell you, I'm
[1:51:07] just worried. I'm just worried that I
[1:51:09] might get out of water. I'm afraid I
[1:51:10] might get too loud. You know, somebody's
[1:51:12] going to think so. But not God.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; But not God. We are not rejoicing. We
[1:51:17] have power over demons. We are not
[1:51:19] rejoicing that we can cast out spirits,
[1:51:22] but our names have been written in THE
[1:51:24] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. THIS MESSAGE IS THE
[1:51:27] BOOK OF LIFE BEING PREACHED IN THE AGE
[1:51:30] YOU'RE LIVING IN. And you begin to
[1:51:32] worship and praise under him. Brother,
[1:51:34] it to turn something on on the inside of
[1:51:36] you that brings steering and
[1:51:38] manifestations of life. It's the truth,
[1:51:41] folks.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. We eat things. We eat things
[1:51:49] that make us so worried that we can't
[1:51:52] enjoy life.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; We can't enjoy things because it's what
[1:51:56] we're feeding on.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; We get to feeding on that stuff. Amen.
[1:52:00] And I tell you what, what you really
[1:52:02] need to do before you come to church is
[1:52:03] go get you a good bake full of TNT or
[1:52:06] Fox News or CNN. That's what you really
[1:52:08] need. Go sit down an hour of Fox News
[1:52:11] and get yourself full of all the
[1:52:14] nonsense that's in this, it's a
[1:52:16] political mess. AND WHICHEVER SIDE
[1:52:18] you're reading, IT'S A MESS AND IT'S A
[1:52:21] HELL BULLING OVER INTO THIS AGE. AND
[1:52:23] EVERY time you feed on it and you get
[1:52:25] stuck on it and you get to watching on
[1:52:27] it and you get more nervous and YOU GET
[1:52:29] MORE NERVOUS AND then you get
[1:52:30] short-tempered and then you get mean AND
[1:52:33] YOU WONDER WHAT'S WRONG. YOU'VE TURNED
[1:52:35] OFF
[1:52:48] RIGHT BACK IN THE CHURCHES. AMEN. WE
[1:52:50] OUGHT TO THROW THEM OUT LIKE THE PROPHET
[1:52:52] OF GOD SAID to
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got an unsaved
[1:52:58] child. Amen. And and the devil just
[1:53:00] keeps feeding you. Oh, this is going to
[1:53:01] happen and that's going to happen. Just
[1:53:03] look just look at their problems and
[1:53:04] look at their issues. I tell you what, I
[1:53:06] got a food that can turn your head. I
[1:53:08] got a food that'll make your head spin
[1:53:10] the other way. Amen. It'll make you look
[1:53:12] at the promises of God.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. I I was thinking about
[1:53:18] this the other day and I was thinking
[1:53:19] about had he ride out there. Brother
[1:53:21] Brandham came with squirrel spoken word
[1:53:24] spoken word meat.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; My goodness. A prophet with spoken word
[1:53:30] meat come to her little cabin, little
[1:53:32] humble place. There was just a few of
[1:53:34] them there that night and he she was
[1:53:37] going to cook for him
[1:53:39] but he done the cooking that night.
[1:53:42] Hey man, she was going to cook him
[1:53:44] squirrel for him.
[1:53:46] But what he brought was another kind of
[1:53:47] meat didn't need cooking, brother.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; He got to tell him about that squirrel
[1:53:52] and how he spoke that seventh one. It
[1:53:53] was laying there. Amen. She got to
[1:53:55] gobbling that up. She got to believe in
[1:53:57] what he was saying. And it be to unlock
[1:54:00] something on the inside of her. AND SHE
[1:54:02] SAID, "BROTHER BAB, [screaming] IT AIN'T
[1:54:04] NOTHING BUT the truth." And when she
[1:54:06] began to agree with that word, ALL OF A
[1:54:08] SUDDEN there was something unlock.
[1:54:10] Listen, folks, if I had the God, I was
[1:54:12] to have the ability.
[1:54:14] There has been things that have been a
[1:54:16] part of what God created man for from
[1:54:19] the Garden of Eden all the way to the
[1:54:21] 1950s that had never been unlocked in a
[1:54:25] human being.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; But when brother Brandham told a story
[1:54:30] about creating a squirrel and she began
[1:54:32] to eat that and begin to feed on that,
[1:54:35] brother Bam said for the first time the
[1:54:38] third pull was exercised on a human
[1:54:40] being. Listen, it has not happened from
[1:54:43] the Garden OF EDEN ALL THE WAY TO
[1:54:45] HATTIE, RIGHT? BUT WHEN SHE FED ON THAT
[1:54:49] GOD WAS USING A MAN TO CREATE AGAIN,
[1:54:52] SOMETHING UNLOCKED ON THE INSIDE of her
[1:54:55] and brother weary turned to faith.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Let's not worry about them kids. Let's
[1:55:01] claim them.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; LET'S QUIT WORRYING ABOUT them and let's
[1:55:04] claim them. LET'S QUIT WORRYING ABOUT
[1:55:07] WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER OUR FAMILY.
[1:55:09] LET'S CLAIM WHAT'S going to happen OVER
[1:55:11] OUR FAMILY. IT'S IN YOU TO do it.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; There's a message for it.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; When you begin to feed on this word,
[1:55:20] listen, I'll tell you what it'll do.
[1:55:21] It'll unlock something in you that you
[1:55:23] can claim a child that don't look like
[1:55:25] there's no way for him to get saved.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; But you got an authority by almighty
[1:55:31] God. And when you begin to feed on that,
[1:55:33] what's it going to do? It's going to
[1:55:34] unlock something.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:39] You start feeding on this message.
[1:55:42] The message is designed
[1:55:45] to make you what God made you.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; People get a hold of it and they go to
[1:55:52] twisting it on
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and they take the great piano of God and
[1:55:58] they play the wrong song.
[1:56:01] [sighs]
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; But you can eat this message.
[1:56:05] Oh, and it'll belt out the best music.
[1:56:10] Sweet sweet words of life. Your your
[1:56:13] your spirit, your life, your
[1:56:15] manifestation.
[1:56:18] I wish that uh I wished all the food
[1:56:22] that turned on good things taste like
[1:56:23] ice cream, but they don't
[1:56:27] cuz they start talking about broccoli
[1:56:28] and green tea and salads. And
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; so sometimes you got to eat things you
[1:56:35] don't like.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; But it'll do something for you nothing
[1:56:40] else can do.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; See, it'll unlock
[1:56:46] the expression.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; If there's a natural DNA, folks, there
[1:56:51] is a spiritual one.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:56:58] if I had another two hours, I'd preach
[1:56:59] it. I'm not going to tonight. I'm I'm
[1:57:01] going to make it mentioned so you can go
[1:57:02] look it up. But in Hebrews the 8th
[1:57:04] chapter, he said, "I'll make a new
[1:57:05] covenant." Hebrews 7, Melazdc. Hebrews
[1:57:08] 8, Melaz Mazdc's covenant. I'll make a
[1:57:12] covenant with you and I'll write it.
[1:57:16] I'll write it upon your heart. I'll
[1:57:18] write my laws in you.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; It'll be inscribed
[1:57:26] on the inside of you.
[1:57:28] And as you begin to feed on the word,
[1:57:31] it'll just start manifesting.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to try to be.
[1:57:36] You already are.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; You just have to eat to eat the message
[1:57:41] of that. I want you to stand to your
[1:57:42] feet with me tonight.
[1:57:49] It's a mystery
[1:57:50] of food.
[1:57:56] just go pull up that little butterfly
[1:57:57] and ask him how he got to be what he is.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I tell you what I was.
[1:58:04] I was just a worm.
[1:58:06] I was just a worm and crawled up on the
[1:58:08] right leaf.
[1:58:11] I watched one of them one time and you
[1:58:13] know they they got real time then they
[1:58:14] got fast time and I watched a little
[1:58:17] butterfly while it was yet a caterpillar
[1:58:20] crawl upon a leaf and their bites are so
[1:58:22] small and they're so insignificant it
[1:58:25] takes a long time for you to even see
[1:58:27] that they ate anything
[1:58:30] but after a little while a hole begins
[1:58:31] to appear in the leaf where it's been
[1:58:34] brother as they start eating something
[1:58:37] starts unlocking
[1:58:39] something thus sayith the Lord said,
[1:58:40] "Crawl up in that tree right there and
[1:58:42] goes and crawls in a cocoon and and the
[1:58:45] things that it ate
[1:58:47] all of a sudden has the ability to
[1:58:49] change that thing from a worm to a
[1:58:52] butterfly
[1:58:54] from something that's ground on the
[1:58:55] ground bound to be there to something
[1:58:58] [music] that can take the heavens.
[1:59:01] Can you imagine?"
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And the great mystery is that leaf it
