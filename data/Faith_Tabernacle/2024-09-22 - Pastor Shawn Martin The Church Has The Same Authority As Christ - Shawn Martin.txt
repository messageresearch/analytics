everyone in the house of the Lord and uh good to have brother Christian his family amen with us and um uh the Lord um uh was gracious to him and uh uh didn't need to have uh surgery on the shoulder there but uh uh he had fractured uh his shoulder had a uh I guess a skiing accident or some kind of an accident amen and um so anyway but the Lord uh kept him and uh we just uh believing for a speedy recovery and uh we we really appreciate brother Christian appreciate his family and uh always a delight to see them and and also it's it's good to have uh brother Wayne Clark with us from Arizona and uh a friend of uh well he had attended dad's church there in pacon uh when Dad was pastoring up there and uh friend of brother Joi and and uh so we're really just honored to have him uh here this morning as well and um uh the musicans can be dismissed I've certainly enjoyed all the songs and the the specials and praise the Lord and it's good to be home amen and um uh we got home um Thursday um evening and afternoon I should say and so U but had uh a good meeting there in py and uh the Lord seemed to move uh among the people so we're really thankful thankful for that and um also Daniel has asked me to greet you all and uh he is ready to get home and uh he's been in Nicaragua for about two weeks now and uh just had some a good time and uh but I I I think U he he's ready to get home he's he's missing uh uh Britney and the girls and and uh just missing the church and so um anyways he should be home the Lord willing Tuesday and I know uh uh Britney's and and the girls are missing him as well amen and uh so uh but we do want to keep sister paty in our prayer if you'd like to turn with me to uh The Book of Luke first of all uh the 10th chapter but we want to keep her in our prayer uh the Lord was certainly merciful to her and um uh we about lost her you know uh the other day and uh we were thinking she might have had a minor heart attack but the doctor said it was a major uh heart attack and 95% of one of the arteries uh was blocked and I think the other one is um 85% if I'm not mistaken but uh so they were able to to do one of the uh put a stin in one of them the arteries and tomorrow they're going to do the other artery put a stin in and so we want to uh just keep her in a prayer but um the doctor said if all goes well uh they'll be releasing her Tuesday and uh so uh I know she appreciates all your prayers and and um the visits the calls and and these things and uh we also want to keep Shu all in our prayer and uh the Lord will just continue to be with him help him uh I don't understand everything um as far as the you know um the formula that they've been given him uh it's it's not working uh good and um theyed three different formulas and um so the doctors wanting to put a feeding tube in him which would require a surgery and of course you know brother Shmi and sister Bethany don't want that and and understandably so they're ready to get home ready to come home and so we want to just really pray uh uh for that uh situation as the Lord will just move and um we're thankful for the Lord moving as he has um these past three months on the baby uh but uh I believe the Lord can just uh bring them home amen and um um so we we certainly want to keep them in in our prayer also uh brother Amos and sister Lisa they're out of town brother Amos is uh I think ministering in Baltimore and uh so we want to keep them in our prayer today uh the the Fall Festival is coming up November 3rd uh there and so we want to uh uh keep that in mind and uh brother Ben PR uh from Arkansas is going to be ministering uh that day and uh so looking looking forward to that also uh next week Sunday evening uh we'll be having uh question and answers and and um so if you have your questions have questions if you want to send them to me um we'll do our best to to answer them according to uh what the prophet taught and according to the scriptures and um uh believe for a good time and so um but Luke uh the 10th chapter and we're going to read the 19th verse pray praise the Lord it says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you isn't that wonderful then if you'll turn with me to um acts 1 and 8 amen Jesus speaking to the church but said but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen could we just bow our heads and hearts and talk to our Lord father we bow our heads to the dust from which we've come Lord in humility and in reverence to you realizing that our life is in your hands our past present future and Lord we're just so thankful for the work that you've done in all of our Lives thank you for bringing us here this morning waking us up up with the heart's desire to come to your house and to fellowship with you now Lord we're just asking that you would meet every need that is here father whether it be physically spiritually mentally whatever it would be father may you feel at home to work the supernatural I pray father that you would just help me to get myself out of the away and anoint us Lord speak through me father to your people that when we leave here we be more closer to you better Christians better established father we thank you we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this morning if I would TI it Le the uh the today's sermon I guess I would title it the church has the same Authority as Christ and you know having power to cast out Devils to heal the sick and to um um to to do these things uh that the disciples had done that even Jesus did healing you know the blind eyes causing them to see raising the dead and those things uh that that is a great thing uh to do I believe that that is still the commission that God has given us to do in this day and I think that's part of the Christianity that's part of the works that the church is to do and Jesus gave the disciples that power to do that uh to go out and to uh cast The Devils out and to to lay their hands on the sick and and these things and and they were rejoicing they they were excited about that that that uh the demons were subject to them and and these things but then Jesus would tell them that don't don't rejoice in the fact that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice that your name is written in in heaven in in the Lamb's Book of Life Now there there is a reason uh that we should rejoice in that that should be our fundamental reason for uh the foundation for our joy and our worship and our rejoicing because we're all fighting a spiritual warfare I don't think that there's one here this morning or maybe listening online that that isn't you know without a battle we're all fighting a battle it's it's a and and we all have an adversary and you know the Bible there in 1 Peter 5 and8 it says be sober be vigilant for your adversary your adversary so you got a personal adversary and uh the ad your adversary the devil as a roaring lion he's walking about seeking whom he may devour so the whole point is to devour you and and not necessarily I mean not necessarily to take you out of existence uh from the earth per se even though you know that that he does that too but uh there's so many people that have been divided in their spirit spiritual walk that they go to church and they claing Christianity but they're just an empty shell it's just a religion it's just a duty it's just a form of godliness and and these things so but but we all have this adversary and he's seeking to destroy us and and and and so but in in that uh uh and that that sounds awful it sounds scary but yet it's not because there's going to be somebody to overcome someone is is going to to and I I just believe that there's a people on the Earth and and people in here that are uh going to overcome the the Bible says that there's going to be an overcomer and and Revelations 12:11 says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death it's interesting that this scripture is is written as though it's past tense they overcame him as though it was already done in the past and and uh uh uh these things and and yet uh uh here we are still in the process of overcoming but yet we're tied to that scripture amen they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb uh uh but yet this tells us that overcoming is a certain thing it's it's a sure thing it's overcoming a a people to overcome in this age is not an iffy thing it's not shaky but somebody's going to overcome because it's already written that that they've overcame and it's not written that they're going to overcome but it's written they overcame and that's just how sure that God's word is ain't that right amen God's word cannot lie and so we have been given power to overcome amen not just power to heal the sick power to raise the dead power over the same but power to overcome that that's what we've been given and and to me that's a greater thing uh than than just power amen uh to uh to you know to cause blind eyes to come open and and these things now you know in in this we we are made up of three parts and the prophet taught us this that it you know we are a body uh spirit and soul and and and he's taught us that our you know our bodies have our body has the five inlets The Taste feel hear smell and and sight and and it's with these senses that we have contact in the physical Rim uh uh we we can you know we can touch the pulpit we can taste our food we can you know we can smell and uh different different uh uh um uh smells and and and things like that and and we're able to contact by the senses the outward the Earthly and then we have our spirit that has five inlets uh uh senses and and it's memory affection conscience reasoning and imag ination and and the prophet said with these senses we are able to contact the spirit world you you can't contact the spirit world with your Earthly senses uh but but now we're able to go and and and there's a world that is unseen and by these five senses of memory and reasoning and conscience and and affection and and and these things then uh we're able to contact the spirit world now Satan has access to these inlets um he's has access to the the F the senses of the body the senses of the spirit and he tries to use these to his Advantage uh uh there and and so uh but then the prophet says but inside of that inside of that Spirit uh your spirit you've got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God that is where you're transformed from Sinner and and and uh uh uh uh you know Beggars and vagabonds and worthless you're transformed from that to being Sons and Daughters of God do you believe that amen see and so now the prophet taught us that the soul is you amen you you may see this but you've not seen me you've just seen the body that I'm living in and this body is an expression of what really is inside but inside of this is me ain't that right amen and when I go to to meet the Lord amen whether if I go by the way of the Grave this body remains but I have gone and so all you see is just the Tabernacle the corpse ain't that right but uh the soul is really what I am and and the prophet told us that the control tower is is in the soul that's that's where the real Authority comes from is down in the soul and and it's either God or Satan that controls you ain't that right amen because that is the control tower and the ability to overcome depends on what you are controlled by amen now if you're controlled by the devil then then you'll never be able to overcome now you may shout and you may speak in tongues and you can may even pray for the sick or you can even preach or you can play the music and and all that but if that soul is under the control of of the devil then there's no overcoming power ain't that right now so so when now we need this Authority we we got to have this Authority because we were all born Sinners um born in sin shaped in iniquity we all know these things and we've all have a carnal nature and that carnal nature is enity against God it's an enemy to God it cannot become subject to the laws of God and and it it does it it's contrary to the laws of God Lives contrary to the laws of God ain't that right now we know the law of God is the word of God and and so it can never come subject to that and and so but this carnal nature brother bradam said this nature is sticky it's a it's a sticky nature and it will be until this new life has been fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again ain't that right now now because that we have a carnal nature amen and and we've all been born with it then there's things that we understand about this world and and the Bible uh Paul would talk about it or Peter uh the Bible talks about it uh the lust of the flesh the pride of life the lust of the eyes ain't that right and and we deal with temper we deal with passions we we we deal with roots of bitterness remember the Bible says don't let root of bitterness uh uh uh get get get in you now he's talking to Holy Ghost filled people but yet because of a carnal nature we we have that tendency we got to fight these things that that come upon us of Gossip un belief and and and and and all of these anxieties and and and fear and and all of these things uh uh we we become subject to these things we be get bothered by these complexes and hurts and and all of these things you understand see and and so uh uh uh uh we we deal with these things but can these things be conquered yes they can be conquered they can be conquered if you're part of the Church of the Living God Amen they can be conquered see and and so because it is the church that has been given the authority been given power now when we speak of the church we're not referring to Catholic church or Baptist or Pentecostal or or or whatever we're not speaking of of of denomination and you know there we're not even speaking of inter denominational churches uh uh you know there's only one Church everybody say there's one church that God recognizes and that's the body of Jesus Christ that's the church that Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it ain't that right now that church is inter denominational church and it's it's a world Universal Church ain't that right a worldwide universal church amen and so now every person must be a part of this church not Faith Tabernacle but the church that Jesus promised to build in in in order to exercise the power that's been given to it can you say Amen the power that's been given to it and and we know that it's impossible to join this church amen you've got to be born into the church You by a new birth ain't that RH amen you you you know uh you you wasn't uh you didn't join brother Bill you didn't join the Bradberry family you were born into it it it was just a birth amen by that see and and so same way is it in this amen uh we we're born into the family of God to the Church of God then and first uh Corinthians 1213 for by one Spirit one Spirit many spirits but one Spirit one we are all baptized into one body can you say Amen one Spirit we're baptized not by a water baptism it's a spirit baptism you can be you can you can be baptized so many times till the T poost know your social security number and and that ain't going to get you into the church you've got to have a spirit baptism by one Spirit are we baptized into one body ain't that right so it's the Spirit baptism that puts us into the church which is the body of Christ amen now if if you look uh uh there's something about this uh being part of the church now Romans 6 and 1 we'll start there but it says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound amen should we just continue indulging in the things of the world smoking and gambling and and committing adultery and and cussing and and whatever else we've done you know shall we cons sin you in this that Grace May abound unto us God forbid no ain't that right how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer uh therein know ye not that as many of us as were baptized Spirit baptism into Jesus Christ CHR were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism Spirit baptism into death like uh that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so also should we walk in newness of Life can you say Amen so there is a newness of life when we come into the the church and become part of of the body of Jesus Christ for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also uh be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serf sin amen see we we we uh uh yes it sin might have been enjoyable amen because the Bible calls it a plag pleasure amen for a season but yet while it was a pleasure it was you was actually serving sin you were a slave to sin you were in bondage to sin ain't that right amen it wasn't just a choice so to speak it was a bondage you you become a slave to this thing A lot of people are slave to passions they're they're a slave to temper they're they're a slave to fear and anxieties they're they're a slaved to to to whatever Satan has to offer ain't that right they become slaves to these things and but God didn't call us to be slaves Amen to the passions of the world he he didn't call us to be slaves to that cell phone and to the internet and and to the to the naked women and to the uh uh to the all the fith that are out there he didn't call us to be slaves to these things see amen so he that is dead is free everybody say I'm free I'm free from sin I'm free from sin see amen see now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died un sin one but in that he liveth he liveth unto God see amen likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed under sin but alive under God through Jesus Christ Our Lord aren't you glad for that that you can be alive unto God you can be more conscious of God than you are conscience of the sin and the field of this world you can become alive to the powers of God and the realities of God more than you are alive to the things of this world Amen that's what it means you're alive unto God Amen you were alive unto sin you amen you come to church sometime and and you didn't even understand why they shouted and why they rejoiced and you didn't understand the things of God Amen why do we need to preach it and why do we need to go to church and why do we need to do this amen but you never questioned about going to the baseball games you never questioned about getting up at 3:00 in the morning to go hunting you never question questioned about all that because you were more alive to the pleasure of sins and the pleasure of this world I'm not talking saying hunting is is a sin amen but you understand what I'm saying we were a more alive to the things of the world than we were to the things of God but now that we've died under sin we are more alive to the things of God Amen we can understand why they Rejoice because we Rejoice we understand there's a home amen that is more of reality than our natural home and we're going to that home it's a uh more of a reality to us than the things of this world so likewise you also reckon yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord now notice what he says let not sin let not sin therefore reain in your mortal body you're free from sin you're free from it you're not servant to sin but that doesn't mean that sin is trying to take over you it doesn't mean that that carnal flesh amen ain't trying to rule you but now you don't have to abide by that you don't have to give in to that let not sin Rule and reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof see he's talking to people that have been free ain't that right neither you yeld your your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God yield don't yield to the devil yield yourselves to God can you say Amen so this tells us it's not an automatic thing amen you got to yield yourself amen and how do you yield yourself Paul says I Die daily I Die daily to the passions I Die daily to the anxieties I Die daily to my wants I Die daily to what this flesh is trying to get me to do and I have the power and the authority to do so neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as though that as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin everybody say for sin shall not have dominion over me sin shall not have dominion over me for you are not under the law but under grace aren't you glad for Grace amen if it had not been for Grace I'd still be a slave to sin I'd still be serving sin amen but now it's the grace of God that has freed me Amen to where I'm no longer a slave to that old thing I'm not a slave to habits I'm not a slave to this flesh there is something within me I am free [Music] hallah now notice the prophet said our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is inforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells in us now notice sin is unbelief do you believe that sin is unbelief now I want to just continue on here 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born of God does not everybody say does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God now the legalist will take that and say well you know if if you if you make your mistake brother beill then then you ain't got the seed of God that's not what what is saying here at all now notice we'll go on see he cannot sin amen uh uh say that again whosoever is born of God does not commit sin in other words does not disbelieve everybody say disbelieve does not disbelieve for his seed his seed Prophet said God's seed see the word is that seed REM remains in him in in his flesh nope in his Spirit nope in his soul the word that genan seed word remains in him see the man and he cannot sin he cannot disbelieve because he is born of God ain't that right now Hebrews 10:26 talking about the authority now amen Hebrews 10:26 for if we sin or disbelieve willfully see after we that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins legalists have taught us that that this applies to everybody that if you if you ever sin amen you come to a time that there's no sin uh uh sacrifice for these sins the prophet said that scripture doesn't even apply to Christians amen that they've got an authority there that and and this scripture doesn't even apply to it can you say Amen it it doesn't Paul is not talking to the Christian that real believer because he is the one who cannot sin he's the one that cannot disbelieve Lord now it doesn't might mean that we don't have sins in the sense of this old flesh the sins that that we make our mistakes we fall we come short of the glory of God we we we have our failures now notice why the prophet said God by Grace saved you not you yourself see if you do you got something to brag about but you haven't got nothing to brag about all Praises goes to him it's him then he's give you the sure hope sure hope see swore by an oath the impossibility for his children to ever be lost amen it's impossible for his children to ever be lost why his seed remaineth in him the seed God's seed remains in that man in that woman in that boy in that girl down in the soul that's ain't that right now they'll get weapons for doing wrong you reap what you sow you get that see now now don't think now you just going out and sin and get by with it if you do and got that attitude it shows you've never been born again you get it if you still got the desire in you to do the wrong then you're still wrong for he has perfected forever those that is see see and those beasts under the Old Testament under legal days offered yearly continually could never take away sin but when we put our hands upon his head and confess our sins and our Born Again of the spirit of God we have no more desire of sin you're no longer the slave to sin that desire is gone you used to want to go out and party you used to want to go out and drink you used to want to lust after them women you used to do all these things that never think nothing of it you loved it you you were glad for it you enjoyed it you indulged in it on now that's what made you the a slave to it was the desire can you say Amen you wanted that big you wanted to get out and cuss and hang around the worldly people come on now come on church it's the truth right see what is it see there was a desire see but when we put our hands upon his head and confess our sins and a born again of the spirit of God we have no more desire of sin sin has has passed from you ain't that right and he says and that's for Time and Eternity can never if sin has passed from you you can never be a sinner in the sight of God again it's not being a saint today and a sinner tomorrow you can never be a sinner sin has passed from [Applause] you what an authority now he says you'll make mist mistakes you'll fall you'll willfully do wrong you'll go out sometimes and do things that don't mean you're lost that means you're going to get a weapon that means you're going to get a correction can you say Amen why because we're in this old flesh we're tempted we're we we we we got that sticky nature that's right ain't that right he said my little boy lots of times my children will do things yours does too and they know it's against your rules and they know what to expect when they when they do it they're going to get a weapon for it sometimes a good one but it's still your child certainly see it's impossible for that man to ever be gone again that's once being born of eternal life God's not an Indian giver give it take it away give it take it away ain't that right see so he says see he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never everybody say shall never come into judgment but is passed from Death unto life and I'm going to raise him up at the last days amen oh what a law what a word ain't that right that's God's promise now if you go on and say well oh well then I can just do he says I always do what I want to do how many just does what you want to do you're free to do whatever you want to do there's no law to this I've said it before I'll say it again might shock you go out you can go out and smoke as many cigarettes as you wanted to smoke yeah I drink all the beer I want to drink the problem is I don't want to drink it the desire's gone it ain't somebody telling me well you better not do this and you better not do this sister Brenda and you better not do this no no no I'm free to do whatever I want to do but I'm no longer a slave to sin I don't have to come up here and beat the people up God ain't trying to beat you into submission he freed you from sin in to where now you're free to serve godall that's right see I always do what I want to do amen but if you're a Christian you don't want to do the thing that's wrong because the very life in you the very Foundation if you want to do wrong it shows you shows the wrong thing is in there how can bitter and sweet water come from the same Fountain so you've been all mixed up on some kind of emotion or fabulous something something another sensation forget it go back to the Altar and say God take my old sinful life away and put me in such a condition that my whole desire changes see he that's born of God does not commit sin he has no desire to do so certainly certainly the devil will trap him here and there but not willfully the Bible said so the devil will trap him now and then and and sure he will he tried to throw a trap for our lord Jesus he did to Moses and caught him he did it to Peter and caught him he did to so many see Peter even denied him but then he went and wept bitterly because there was something in him that's amen glory you love the Lord says when the dove was turned out of the Ark the crow went out and called around he called around see he was in the ark all right but he went out his nature was different he could eat all all the old dead carcasses he wanted to and be satisfied why he was a crow to begin with he was a scavenger he was no good I think that's why a lot of people can live without church so long they they can live without prayer they can live without Bibles uh uh reading they they can live without listening to messages they they can live without these things it it they they can do and they they they they can you know I mean they don't have to why it's a nature come into the ark anytime he wants to and leave anytime he wants to it doesn't bother him it's the nature see he was a crow to begin with he was a scavenger he was no good he was a hypocrite who sat on the roost with the dove just as big as the dove was he could fly anywhere the dove could fly but he could eat but he could eat good food just as the dove ate and then he could eat rotten food what the dove couldn't eat for the dove is a different mixup she's a different make she's a dove and the doll can Dove cannot digest rotten food because it don't have any Gall and a man that's born of the spirit of God becomes a dove of God his nature his change his makeup see yes sir you put the spirit of the dove in the crow he' never sit on a dead carcass see if he lit down by mistake he'd certainly get away quick he couldn't stand it see and a man that's born in spirit of God just cannot tolerate see he can't he might light in a barroom sometime but he'll get out of there just out of there quick a he a a woman might entice him to get him to turn uh around but he'll turn his head again he'll get away from there real quick why he's a dove how many doves do we have I'm many a dove ain't that right see well he says you ain't going to fool him because he knows my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow he's a dove to begin with there is what I'm speaking about the actual something that anchors in [Music] there now as Christians we war against the flesh that's the battle that we all go through amen we war against it we don't give into it we War now and and it might seem that the people out out there in the world and even modern Christians out out in the nominal Christians or whatever they they're just so indulgent they're just happy happy because there's nothing there to fight against they're happy with what they're doing they'll fight against the word more than they will the wrong but we're fighting against the sin we're fighting against the things that so easily beset us amen cuz we're trying to run a race we're trying to achieve something amen ain't that right now notice Romans 7:14 Paul describes the Warfare he says for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal so under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not that I yeah that that do I not but what I hate that do I then if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that uh that it is good now then it is no more that I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh now I want to say this now you know some teach that this is Paul talking as a sinner that's not true Paul is speaking as a converted man been born again amen can you say Amen but yet he says sin that dwelleth in me for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do for now if I do that I would not it is no more I do it I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me that sticky nature is still there amen and that right but notice the 22nd verse for I Delight after the law of God after or Delight in the law of God after the inward man can you say Amen see the desire for sin is gone now my desire is delighting in the laws of God the word of God after the inward man not the flesh come on Amen but I see another law in my members warning against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through the Lord through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I I myself serve the law of God but with the the flesh the law of sin now brother brandham really describes this and I won't go into it but uh maybe another time we can get more into it but he talks about it's the flesh the flesh is basically it's backsliding the flesh is carnal the flesh we always got to put up with the flesh the flesh doesn't want to go to church the flesh would rather be at a ball game than than than come to the house of God the flesh gets embarrassed when we all get excited about the things of God but the flesh sure doesn't get excited when you're teams winning the flesh so tired to pray but the flesh doesn't get so ex get get too tired to get up and go shopping go there's people standing in line you know on on on black Fridays way early in the morning they go get that good deal flesh doesn't question all that they get excited about that but when it comes to the house of God when it comes to prayer when it comes to putting the TVs away when it comes to putting all these other things and devoting yourself to God the flesh doesn't want that that's right so it's the flesh that makes the excuses flesh doesn't want to praise God I'm too sick that's right right the flesh the flesh reason with God's word so there is that constant battle there is that constant Warfare that that that that conflict between the outward man and the inward man ain't that right but notice Jesus gave the church power that word power means Authority ain't that right John 1 12 but as many as received him received the word for their day he was the Living Word ain't that right when you see God doing it and vindicating his word that's him and as many as received him to them gave he power or authority to become sons of [Applause] God that's right amen yeah we don't have power to heal the sick we don't have the power to save The Sinner to raise the dead we don't have power to cast out demons but we have an authority ain't that right brother Brandon described it as the like the policeman that stands out in the intersection he's standing there at the intersection directing traffic y'all y'all seen it right or maybe at the school you know at in in the school zone there you know you go to blackburg and there'll be a place at the end of the day when school is out and he's standing out there directing traffic now he ain't got enough power to you know to stop a flea and he certainly ain't got enough power to stop them automobills that are coming through but what he does have he has a badge of authority that stops everything right right sure does well see see then then that that that that's the church God doesn't have to have muscled up people he doesn't have to have talented people he doesn't have to have people so well put together educated people rich people smart people but what people he does have he's given them the authority you may be as poor as poor it can be but if you're part of the church you've been given an authority to stop every demon in his tracks you have the authority Amen to stop that devil from working in your life you've got the authority to stop the devil from working in your home working in your church working in your mind you have that Authority you're no match to the devil without an authority amen GL Hallelujah we have the badge of authority that's right the prophet said it's not a denomination it's the power of the resurrection of Christ in each individual life he gave all the power and authority that he had to his church prise the Lord no excuse say well he did it he was God the authority belongs to you can you say amen he had to give us this author Authority because all Demons of hell has been Unleashed in this day but you will not succumb to it you've got an authority I don't care how bad the age is I don't care how deceitful the age is you've got an authority look at the authority that Jesus had the Bible says he taught he taught as one having Authority yes sir than that Authority that the chief priest didn't even have that when he taught he taught his one having an authority and everybody recognized it the church recognized it The Sinner recognized it the poor the rich whatever when they heard him this is a man of authority prise the Lord the Bible also says with authority he commanded the unclean spirits and they obeyed him why he was God in human flesh can you say that with me he was God in human flesh God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself he was not the second person nor the third person of the godhead he was the only person of the godhead made flesh ain't that right so then if if he was God made flesh then the authority that Jesus had was the same author Authority that God had the same Authority that was displayed to that old body was the same Authority that was displayed when God spoke in spirit form let there be light and there was light it was supreme authority in the body of Jesus God suffered like we suffer God aged God cried God hungered and thirsted God became weak at times ain't that right God in that body grew frail because the body grew Fair frail he was stoop shoulder the prophet said he just tired he was weary God grew grayhead can you say Amen but the authority of God did not change or diminish prise Lord when he become a human being and the Centurion we know recognized the kind of authority that Jesus had remember Matthew 88 he said to Jesus Lord I'm not worthy that thou should us come under my Ruth but speak the word what an authority speak the word don't don't come over there and and get your fist and knock somebody out just speak the word I'm looking for an authority that will cause sickness to leave my my servant can you say amen he said speak the word only and my servant shall be healed what an authority just speak speak the word don't whine about it don't cry about it don't beg over it speak it with authority in other words command it to leave and my servant shall be well ain't that right now the prophet said that this Centurion he knew that Jesus had all power all power over all sickness all diseases over death hell and he knew that all Jesus had to say was speak the word and that settled it now that's what that Centurion knew about the authority that Jesus had and the prophet said that every all the power and authority that Jesus had he's put in the church right praise the Lord glory amen now Jesus was willing to just go lay his hands on him and cause that fever to break but it was the Centurion that recognized there was a greater Authority than just laying hands we talk about the light you know brother Bram talked about when you know this I think it was Readers Digest when they you know they had that Minister you know they studying and the minister laid hands on that sick person and there was light that come out of them hands and to that to the patient brother Ram talks about it what what what an authority that we have just to lay hands on the sick and that is an authority you know but what a greater Authority all right to be able to speak amen Lord now surely you've seen that happen surely you've seen it in your life just just for an example when we were just kids me a mom was taking my grand her mom my grandmother she was an invalid back to Arkansas so Dad stayed home and it was raining I I remember it too and I was I was I don't know I might have been six but but we a car had stopped or pulled out in front of mom or done something and Mom slammed on the brakes and when she did we started spinning when she lost control and we went all the way down and was crossing or there there was a water I just remember that and we went all the way down in the bank and the back wheels ended in the water now what we didn't know is dad woke up and the Lord told him you pray or you'll never see your family again Dad rolled out of that bed and started pleading the blood over us hallelujah come home and realize it was the same time all right that that had happened the Lord speaking Dad wasn't there to lay hands on that car Dad wasn't there to lay hands on the family that wasn't there at the steering wheel to make sure that we were all safe but he began to speak a word can you say Amen you may not know where your daughter or son is that are out there in the world but just speak a word the word has more power can you say Amen it's an authority on now now the prophet said it astonished Jesus by what the Centurion said all right it astonished him cuz he's used to oh lay come lay remember your eyes come and lay your hands come come come and here's the Centurion recognized in a greater Authority than just laying hands speak it and it astonished Jesus see and the prophet said see just to know that his word it was a power of Testament his power of authority and Christian friend tonight his word is the power of authority that what he says it will be regardless of what you think or I think it's going to be just the same it's an authority good I hope this is all right now notice what kind of authority it was it was scriptural authority scriptual authority everybody say scriptural Authority see now now notice what how this works see the prophet said this word was spoke of God before the foundation of the world this word was spoke of God before the foundation of the world was ever laid and the only way it's written in a book is because that he revealed his word and plan to His prophets and apostles and they wrote it in the word now see Jesus was a predestinated seat of God how many believes that he was not he did not come into this world by accident he was pre-planned he was for ordained of God predestinated see a seat of God and the word is seat of God every word in this Bible is a seed of God and this word speaks of you it spoke of Jesus ain't that right the scriptures foretold of his life and what he was to do and what he would be ain't that right Prophet said the word spoke of him when he healed the sick when he raised the dead when the lame leap like in heart it was the word yes it was coming from the word it was scriptural Authority when he laid when he caused the blind to see it was coming from the word he was doing exactly what the word said he would do that's right right he was predestinated to be the prophet to be the lamb to be the king Lord to be the intercessor to be to be priest see the scriptures foretold of him they foretold that he would raise from the dead and he knew who he was he knew what his position was by scriptures his authority came from scripture yes sir that's right that's why he says there in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me the very scriptures say you quote testify of me you claim to believe them but they testify see it was scriptural Authority so Jesus had scriptural authority to be the Messiah to be the Redeemer he had scriptural authority to do the works that he did to perform the sign that he did amen Psalms 40 and S then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me and I Delight to do thy will oh my God yay thy law is within my heart did you know John the Baptist had scriptural authority to be what he was and do what he did why he was the prophet he would had scriptural authority to be the prophet that forun the first coming of Christ no devil of Hell could could stop it he was standing there on scriptural Authority remember Matthew 3:1 in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaias Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight ain't that right John 1:19 and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he conf and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ he wasn't trying to be something he wasn't but what he did do and what he was he had the scriptural authority to be that and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he says I am not art thou the that Prophet see uh and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sin us what sayest thou of thyself and he said kind quot from scripture I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness makes straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet isaas can you say Amen see so John the Baptist wasn't out on a limb and neither was Jesus out on the limb doing what they done it was all based upon the scriptures now notice the prophet said now John Jesus did recognize in John that John was a true Prophet the word had spoke of John and he knew that he was the absolutely the prophet of the hour and John knew that Jesus was the Messiah of the hour and they both clearly had an understanding can you say Amen so they made their confession based on the scriptures because they believed what the scriptures said about them Church we're not out on a limb amen when we say we're going to be in a Rapture that's that we're not being put out on a limb when we say we are Sons and Daughters of God that we're not out on a limb when we say that we're going to receive a body change we're not out on a limb it's everything based upon the scripture we have scriptural authority to be what we are to say what we are to believe what we believe hallelujah it's based upon scriptural Authority aren't you glad for that by scriptural authority Jesus over overcame the world he defeated death he defeated hell he defeated the grave he overcome every Temptation Hebrews 4:15 Paul said he was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin he overcome sickness he overcome bitterness he overcome Lust by God's word he overcame brother briam said he overcome the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only yeah right another place he said he fa to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fa in direct Disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word don't disregard the word right for the word speaks of you it's your Authority am bless the name of the Lord I may not have that authority to tell you who's going to be president and I may not have the authority to put Trump or to put whoever candidate you want in in as president there's nothing in the scripture for that but I do have the authority to cast out Devils I do have the authority over every sin I do have that authority to triumph over every demon of hell because it's scriptural author Authority scripture now notice brother Braham speaking of Jesus said with all of his power with all of his signs and with everything he had in him he didn't use one of them to defeat Satan he took the father's word and defeated Satan right that's all you have to do just take God's word and defeat Satan with what he took the scriptures that prot to him and defeated every devil you can't tell me that as as he was coming up closer to death he knew he was going to die he knew what the scripture said and yet anxiety began to No Doubt fight him just like it fights us no doubt fear began to set in are you really the Messiah are you sure this is really going to work are you sure and then yet he would take the scriptures and say that it is written it is written it is written can you say amen he looked at him one time and said destroy this Temple and within 3 days I'll raise it up again he was speaking by faith but he had scriptural authority to speak like that for the scripture says destroy this body or or what was it I'll not suffer my Holy One or uh to see corruption or leave his soul in hell and Jesus knew that he would rise within 3 days because he knew that he that scripture was spoke of him him he had scriptural authority to talk like he did and you have scriptural authority to claim your children you have scriptural authority to speak yourself into a Rapture I don't care what he trying to defeat you you've got scripal authority to overcome that thing now notice Jesus had all the fine qualities of God in him do you believe it he had powers upon Powers but when he met Satan he never used his power he gave an example for the weakest of Christians when he met Satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and the weakest weakest Christian can take that stand hold it sure God's in his word every time everybody say every time every every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written I believe he had power to do it but he met Satan on the same grounds with the same word that you can meet him with every one of us it's written it's written I might not be The Brightest Bulb in the socket but I do have the power and authority to tell the devil it's written it's written I may not know all the words of this Bible and they I might not know all the Greek understandings of it but I know there's one thing I can say it is written and I have that same authority to put the devil in his place Amen Hallelujah Jesus showed us that the authority lays in the word of God can you say amen amen now notice and I'm going to try to close but he said the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ because everybody say because you are a pre destinated seed just like Christ was you can't be part of this church part of the bride and the word not speak of you that's right Jesus could not be Messiah he knew he couldn't be Messiah and not one scripture of the Messiah that spoke of the Messiah not pertained to him he knew every scripture that pertained to the Messiah spoke of him for he believed he was that Messiah and he proved he was the Messiah and so is it for you if your bride if you're part of this thing then every scripture that speaks of this bride pertains to you now you're predestinated see John 15:16 if you have not chosen me Jesus said but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you ain't that right so this shows that you're a word seed that word seed is down in the soul amen flesh might act up flesh might be contrary but the seed is in the soul Hallelujah 1 Peter 2:9 but you are a chosen generation chosen generation a ro priesthood a holy nation see a peculiar people maybe your flesh ain't telling you that but the Bible the word is speaking of you you're a predestinated seed amen that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but now are the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy ain't that right now notice what a prophet said back in the beginning when God looked down and seen what was going to happen he spoke of the slain lamb and God's word is always conf confirmed in heaven and the lamb was slain right there before the foundation of the world according to God's word is that right but it never happened until 4,000 years see but it was a finished work back there because God confirmed it in the heavens just like you was always saved God confirmed it in the heavens before he ever become a reality here on the Earth and you're he's already glorified you in that it's already confirmed it's a dumb deal it's a finished work that word it's a scriptural Authority amen ain't that right so see he said and the Bible said that you in his church tonight that's born again he said how it's nice for the poet to say that a new name that's written down in glory tonight but the Bible said that everyone that was saved their names were put on the Lambs of the book of life before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain you was associated with it then what are you going to do about it all that comes to me no man can come to me ex come except my father draws him so there's the elected from the beginning now as we wrap this up you've got to overcome too amen I got to overcome too amen can you say amen and we've been given that authority to overcome not overcoming In the Flesh for our flesh is weak our flesh is powerless to overcome the world but the authority lays in the gene seed of God that word seed amen that God put in us before the foundation of the world ain't that right now you can have the Bible you can read this Bible you can read it backward and for forward you can you you you you can read it 10 times through every year you can know it backward and forward but it'll do you no good unless there's that genan seed word seed down in your heart can you say Amen Prophet said you can mimic any of these things you can contact like like a Christian or you could cast out devils like a Christian but the inside control tower the beginning the origin isn't of God it'll never return turn to God Amen you understand it see did not Judas cast out Devils did not C caus uh the one who condemned Jesus put him to death even prophesy but he could not stay with the word amen can you say Amen so now you're transformed this is again where you're being transformed the prophet said from the church and the world into being Sons and Daughters of God not prophesying speak tongues running all over the place and remaining the same still with them same old desires there is an authority that's been given to you scriptural Authority can you say Amen but then the word seed has to be quickened yes by the spirit so Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now notice what a prophet says when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin you've got your faults and your failures and all that that ain't even imputed unto you did the scriptures say blessed is the man whom the Lord does not impute sin see he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just he said just get in Christ and it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creation in Christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit he said try to live a right kind of life he said like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost and going out in here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it can't can't just be so certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in this world but this seed word made manifest or quickened made alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question there's there's no arguing with God there there's no ounds of unbelief there can you say amen he says and what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started see it's already started why because it's turned you there's there's that control tower God now has quickened that word seed he's living in there and everything your flesh may not be there your flesh May testify it may be crying out and and Waring against you but that word seed is Quicken and it's dominating dominating amen can you say amen that's right praise the Lord that's good your flesh might tell you you've crossed the line there's no more Mercy but there's something down inside of you says I'm still a Son of God it dominates you're too sick to worship you're too sick to praise God you're too sick you know and all that's doubt maybe start trying to come into but that word seed begins to well up God is faithful God is true God will come through this thing he will never leave me nor forsake me I've got the scriptural Authority can you say Amen what is it it begins to put this body under subjection it silence that voice that carnal Spirit it silences that thing amen you love him amen he said what is it it's the earnest of the Resurrection this body will be raised up again it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and Corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned Heavenly and see now that's the earnest that you're going in the Rapture it's the earnest a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen see I've seen sh Shadows of people done eat up with cancer tuberculosis see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong there if if there is no Divine Healing then there is no Resurrection because Divine Healing is the earnest of the Resurrection you know what the earnest money is don't you he said it's the down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his Tripes were healed notice how wonderful we love him now this body is subject to the spirit it's not yet entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but now we're subject to the word subject to the word can you say Amen oh do you love him can you lift your hands unto the Lord I love him I love him hallelujah hallelujah if the musicians will come amen he said see the outside body has five inlets to it the contact your Earthly home see taste feel smell and hear the inside which is a spirit it has five senses conscience love and so forth but the inside of that the soul has one thing and that's what faith or doubt right right it's what he said one gate it's either Faith or doubt and he says that's where you live right you live amen he said the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it kef is prophesied Judas cast out Devils the spirit anointed him see the rain falls on the just and the unjust the Wheats can Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core see that's where our Authority lies is down down at the core see so the uh uh he said there's where you are in intellectuals can can accept it and say oh sure that looks good I believe that that still don't do it see no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still it isn't so because if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here see the flesh the spirit see but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean they're saved that's exactly right the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life see it come from God it goes to God it's the soul he said I notice it's got to be five uh faith f AI t h the outside Spirit Js us on the inside you see that's how standing here looking at you I don't know one of you see uh a one of you the spirit can anoint me still I don't know none of you but when that inside of the inside breaks in that's God see that's where the outside can reason you can take a man and say well now I know I'm not supposed to make commit adultery but you know then the spirit tells me that I shouldn't commit adultery but will you see way down in there steal that thing in there it'll kind of govern around and better watch it see but when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body ain't that right see and that's where we're coming to we're coming centered upon the word not emotions not feelings it's not how we feel you you you may wake up not feeling saved you feel back slid feeling like you ain't got Victory feeling defeated feeling everything but what down in that soul is what counts because in there the word begins to say but you're not defeated but you are victorious but you are saved but you are going to make it can you say amen and then there you don't live by your feelings you don't act by your feelings you don't you don't talk by your feeling you talk by what the word is saying oh I may not feel it but I feel I know I'm saved I know that's different but it's true then you start reigning you start ruling by the word not by your feeling not your feelings ruling you you're ruling your feelings you're ruling your emotion you're ruling everything by the word that's in [Music] you amen can you say amen I love the Lord there's so many things that brother Bram talks about but throwing throwing our body and I'm going to read this one more I know I've kept you he said you are an out outward man which is controlled by five senses you are an inward man controlled by uh one sense which is Faith this Faith disagrees with all five senses if the and which he says six senses but we know he taught there's five senses he said with all five senses if the five senses doesn't agree with faith see this Faith disagrees with all five senses if the five senses doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to to the other as long as the five senses agree with the faith wonderful but when the five senses disagree with faith then leave the five senses alone leave your emotions alone leave what you feel alone leave what it's your flesh is telling you leave it alone and go by faith you said now for instance Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true amen the outside man reason says that can't be true to you then ignore the outside man and accept the Inside Man see that's the same thing Paul is speaking of you see he was slded under the law uh uh to carnal sin every one of us is the same that's the reason we have the troubles that we do married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin adulteries everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal that part must perish but the inside we are a spirit Man soul inside see and that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith everybody say by Faith by accepting what God says we could go on and on you bring it into subjection by Faith by accepting what God says don't believe in [Music] yourself yourself will let you down everything else is going to let you down everything else is Shifting Sands there's one thing that you have the authority with and that's that's by God's word and you take God's word by faith and accept it and then it becomes an authority to you you can speak to your feelings you can speak to every situation and say I know it's real I know it's true Satan give it up it's time to leave can you say amen I know fear will come upon you don't accept that say I refuse to accept fear complx has come upon you I refuse to do I I just refuse to that I'm going to take God's word but you got this you got that you got that it doesn't matter I'm going to take God at his word I've got that authority to do so scriptural Authority amen is it we've got the power oh we've got the power in the name of Jesus us we've got the power
