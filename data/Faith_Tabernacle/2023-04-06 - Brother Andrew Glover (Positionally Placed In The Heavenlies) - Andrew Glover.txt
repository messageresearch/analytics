accomplished here we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do thy wonderful name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the book of Ephesians we want to look there in the second chapter and you all can turn these uh monitors here off I'll just use my ear monitor in the book of Ephesians the second chapter we want to look in the fourth verse I know it's a very very familiar reading to us this evening amen Paul says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us how many is thankful for his love even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ he says by Grace ye are saved amen now I love this sixth verse and hath raised us up together and made us sit together so there's a Unity here raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show his exceeding exceeding Riches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ amen we asked the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if the Lord will help me I want to speak to you here on positionally placed in the heavenlies positionally placed in the heavenlies I know maybe the last time we spoke to you all we spoke to you on a thought of we are heavenlies in our souls amen we are heavenlies in our souls and we we're coming from there in the book of Ephesians the first chapter where Paul says he hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we found that there's many spiritual blessings right there's Divine Healing he said Visions foreknowledge power but the one I really labored on with you and that thought was on the Revelation amen of his presence being here now amen regardless of the conditions and I'll I'll just say this I was able to listen to the meeting here from Sunday morning and my wasn't that powerful what brother Sean laid out about the presence of God Amen I am thankful to be identified in this hour by the presence of Jesus Christ amen now we find then that the spiritual revelation of his presence being here now amen is the anchor of the soul that no matter what we go through no matter what we face no matter what our bodies Our Spirits our minds anything goes through we have a revelation in our soul that he is here with us and he's here now now the father of God said Jehovah Jireh 64 he said now remember that Christ is risen from the the dead and is Among Us and to get that in your mind Christ has raised from the dead and is Among Us now we've seen all kinds of great moves and shouting and praising God and that's all fine he said we've spoken tongues prophesied all we've seen that he said that comes right along with it but remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself amen the last thing is his divine presence the word himself he is the word he said the head the word amen it's coming to the body see then that word in Hebrews the fourth chapter said the word of God is sharper more powerful than in two-edged sword and a discerner of the false and intents of the heart he said now take that scripture run it back to the beginning of the prophets and then run it right on down through Jesus Christ and see if it isn't the same thing he said the same thing he is known as the Messiah amen so all the way back from the book of Genesis the third chapter coming up to the present hour amen it was prophesied that Jesus Christ Christ would be here as the Messiah amen but now he's not here in a Corporal body amen but there is another body upon the face of the Earth and it's a mystical body it's a universal body amen it's the bright body of Jesus Christ known as amen the Messiah it of the Messiah now he said he is known as the Messiah it's not some man here is the Messiah amen but the holy spirit is the Messiah amen Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing amen so here it is here now just working in the flesh amen getting the body ready for the Rapture and Grace do you believe it friends amen then the hour that we are living in he is not here amen conditioning us or preparing us for another church age amen he's not preparing us for another hour or another age or another season to come amen but this is the final age it's the it's the final voice we're in the final moments amen amen at any time now we are going to blend out of time and back into eternity amen therefore we are getting the body ready for the rapturing grace God's provided Place 65 he said now notice remember the great power of God moving comes into a Son of God it quickens him and the spirit of Life enters into him then what does it do it seats them in Heavenly places now we can all agree from the beginning to the end brother random emphatically amen establishes that the believer's position in Christ is in Heavenly places right the believer's position in Christ is in Heavenly places now not they will be but we are now see we have already resurrected and the Dynamics and the mechanics has gone to work and it's quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of God Amen notice what he's saying the quickening power amen Has Lifted us up into the presence of God Amen the quickening power has changed our attention amen from the things of the Earth to the things of Heaven amen see we have been raised into the presence of God where his spirit is and now somebody say now amen we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen in Christ Jesus sitting in there and the great Thief that's already fired up been raised from the dead amen and we're a part of it if you're a part of the Bride you are because the Bride is a part of the groom you know so we find out that it's the same thing amen and she will do exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day amen this bride will not do nothing thing but what the word has predicted amen have heard to do in the age that she's living in do you know why this bride is not building an ark amen because that's not what the word predicted she would do in this age do you know why she's not killing a natural lamb and putting the blood of a natural lamb above the door because that's not what the word predicted she would do in this age amen but she is assembled together amen and she's not forsaken the assembling as she sees that they approach him amen because that's what the word predicted she would do amen she's laying hands on the sick and they are recovering amen because that's what the word predicted she would do amen she's casting out Devils she's speaking in tongues amen she's preaching the message she's believing the power of God among church we cannot do something amen that we were not ordained to do but the reason we're doing it amen is because from before the foundation of the world Amen God through a gene seed ordained us amen for a Time such as this amen come on Esther amen it's not a strange thing that you're in the Kingdom amen you were brought in here for a Time such as this and come on bride I know there's troubles I know there's situations I know there's depressing hours amen but we were born for a Time such as this they meant to believe the power of God to believe the promises of God now I'm just going to tell you what a prophet said about you he said she won't be a layout of sin come on the prophet of God said this bride amen will not be laodicea amen not by no means of lukewarm amen but shall be on fire for God and shall be moving in the spirit of God Amen she will not let her trials make her lukewarm she will not let disappointments amen make her lukewarm she will not let the pressures of society amen reduce her down to a nominal layout of sin Christian amen but she will be what the word has predicted she will be she will be the bride amen now people say well we're in laodicea I know we're in laodicea but we're not ugly Odyssey we've been called out by a message and you say Amen we've been called out by a message now when this bride recognizes who she is amen then the Rapture is going to go she will by no means amen be allowed to see him she will by no means be lukewarm but she will be on fire for God she will be on fire for God no fat feel good she will be moving on the spirit of God she will be on fire for God she will be moving in the spirit of God Amen because that's what the word has predicted she would do now amen I know if we're going to talk about the bride amen we've got to positionally place the bride now you all know there's a tape called the countdown right amen preaches in 1962. he preaches another tape called the restoration of the Bright Tree he preaches the Jehovah Jireh series he preaches amen amen uh the seed is not there with a shark amen he's preaching all these sermons and in these sermons amen he's laying out four stages Amen in the countdown he lays out four modes of transportation in the restoration of the Bright Tree he lays out four death Messengers amen informed life Messengers restoring the right tree back amen what is he doing he is positionally placing the bride Amen in this hour for the Rapture and I was just listening the other day today countdown 62. I've never quite called it the way brother Brandon praise it here in the opening prayer he says I pray and thank you for giving us good rest in our bodies and for the knowledge that we have of your word and the understanding that we have of the spirit constantly praying that you'll give us a greater understanding so that we might not be a vain puffed up people by it amen but a humble people see in order that the Holy Spirit might be able to use us Amen to the fulfilling of the word of God Amen and to place us positionally where we need to be at this hour amen for we must be at the right place for it to happen amen the bride must be at the right place amen for the word that has been spoken heard to be fulfilled amen she cannot be in another age then listen if you're not preaching a bright age message amen you cannot preach it the right can be changed Amen in the moment in the tweaking of an eye amen because she will not be changed amen under a 1906 layout see an anointing she will not be changed under a Lutheran anointing or a Wesley anointing amen but underneath the message of the hour amen he will call her out of the confusion and will positionally place her Amen in a place where her body can be changed amen you know why the devil's fighting you to not get in those States amen because rapturing faith is in those States you know why the devil facts you not to read your Bible amen because there's a word and it's an inspired word it's a word of encouragement it's a word of Victory and the devil knows if he can get you out of place amen then the word that's been spoken concerning your life amen will not be fulfilled amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen wherewith he loved us amen called us by a message and put us in a position and we want to be it Lord amen if it's a housewife behind the table if it's a factory man with a wrench in his hand and a testimony if it's for the minister in the Pulpit or the Deacon or the trustee or the child at school the teenager in the discussion at the class wherever it is Lord let us be there at the right time I'm on church this bride amen is not just made up of preachers it's not just made up of deacons and Sunday school teacher amen but there's young people amen that's on fire amen for God by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost we know you promised it and it's going to happen because you said so amen see it's our faith is built there amen that our faith is built upon the revelation of the position amen that God has given us by the scriptures and the age we're living in listen I believe the hour has come amen for the church to come to a complete understanding program opens countdown and says Lord give us a greater understanding he opens the adoption series 16. 60 and says Bible teaching usually is a little treacherous amen but you know it kind of walk out on thin ice amen but we just feel maybe at this point at this time amen it might be good to kind of bring the church to what I think amenities to a complete understanding positionally of what we are in Christ Jesus amen sometimes I think that preaching is a wonderful thing amen but listen preaching catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word amen but teaching places a man positionally what he is amen and we can never rightfully be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are we can never fulfill amen the adoption Upon Our Lives until we are positionally in the place that God has placed us listen amen if God's called you to be a preacher then be a preacher and get in the pulpit and preach if he's called you to be a singer amen then sing with everything that's within you if he's called you to be a deacon be the best Deacon there could be whatever God has called you to be amen be it regardless and the devil against you amen that does not want you to fulfill the call that God has placed upon your life listen we got to shake ourselves some time or another and realize these high times and these troubled times are not going to defeat us amen but we're going to defeat them amen hard times is not going to defeat this bride amen but we're going to defeat them amen lay out a sea it's not going to defeat this bride amen but this bride is going to defeat laodicea o Church of the Living God I think it's time to get our sword in our hand I think it's time to get our shield in front of us amen and start fighting back against these Devils amen that's trying to bury us under complexes and bury us under hard times we have not been positionally placed in depression we have not been positionally placed in anxiety and nervousness but we have been positionally placed in the heavenlies by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and every devil every demon ever spirit is subject to the word regardless of the conditions the presence of Jesus Christ is upon the church and we will not be defeated by hard times but we will defeat Hard Times come on housewives you're not going to be defeated by the sicknesses on your babies but you're going to defeat them sicknesses it's on your baby amen because the word has given you an authority to do so we can never rightfully be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are and what are we we're Victorious what are we we're Overcomers what are we we're more than conquerors what are we brother Amos we're an invincible Army what are we we're Messiahs well are we church amen where the word born bride see the part of God said the time has come amen then to act upon what we know to be the truth and you cannot act with faith until first you know what you're doing see you've got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it you got to know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it you've got to know what you are before you can have faith to do it you've got to know where you're at before you can have faith Amen to manifest the promises of the age that you're living in now Paul says in Hebrews 11 3 he says through faith we understand amen that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear right amen now look at this word understand it means to proceed with a mind it means to have understanding it means to think upon it means to heed it means to ponder or consider so brother Daniel Paul is saying through faith we consider that the worlds were framed by the word of God Amen through faith we perceive amen that the things which were not seen amen we're not made of things which do appear remember him takes Hebrews 11 3 as his text in the message countdown and says now just remember that when you see anything in the natural amen it is typifying a spiritual thing when you see a natural thing where the Terry it is typifying a spiritual thing and all things are made amen after things which do not appear amen see so the natural then has reflected the spiritual so when you see the natural it is a reflection of the spirit so when you see the spiritual it is a reflection of the natural remember says at the world fair amen they're sowing by scientific research amen what science has been able to achieve in the Natural Things amen now we are here amen showing by spiritual research amen what God has been able to achieve amen with people who will believe his word amen scientific research at the world fair is a is a display brother to him amen of what men have been able to achieve amen by scientific abilities amen but in the house of God Amen is a display of what God has been able to achieve amen with people who will believe his word come on you may not feel like you're much Brother Sam amen but you are at this Play Amen of the ability of God Amen to fill the life of a man and lay out of sea and overcome 200 000 thousand devil among you young people may not feel like you very much amen but you're God's display amen of what God can do in the life of a teenager come on housewives you may feel like you're just cleaning house and making beds and cooking pies amen but you are a display of what God can do in the flesh of a woman amen that will recognize the AIDS that she's living in listen you are a display of a spiritual research of what God has been able to achieve amen scientific things you've got to achieve in my scientific lines but if you're going to achieve spiritual things then you've got to work in the spiritual lines thank you if you're going to achieve Natural Things sister Cindy you're working the natural lines if you're going to achieve spiritual things you've got to work in the spiritual lines amen so we're living in an age where there are natural and there are spiritual achievements remember him said what are they they are modern and spiritual happenings now you know when he preaches amen the countdown he uses the modes of transportation right and he said see the first one was a horse and buggy which he like an under justification which the messenger of that day amen was a man named Luther right he said then they made another Discovery and they broke out into the automobile and he linked that one to Wesley under the message of sanctification he said but then the third one was amen they made an airplane which was a scientific achievement amen and he likened that one to the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was given amen when the when the when the gifts was restored to the church Pentecost right he said but now watch those scientific achievements amen are only forerunners of spiritual achievement now do you realize why amen that they got an automobile after the horse and buggy it's because there was scientific researchers who refused to quit because they knew that quitters never win amen and winners never quit amen so no matter how many walls they came up against amen they kept on chipping away they kept on chipping away because they had a revelation if I'll just keep pressing I'll eventually break through to something and the proper God said then come along the Wright brothers amen listen amen amen amen the horse and buggy had to overcome its challenges brother Samara the automobile had to overcome its challenges amen listen all the Orville right had to overcome their challenges Amen to get a man's feet off the ground he said then Pentecost fell and they took to the air with a spiritual gift with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they took to the air oh got his feet off the ground so he could swim around get up in the air amen but oh how far he was above the horse and buggy he meant how far he was above the automobile amen he was up in the air amen but he was knocking and puffing and banging amen but he was flying amen he was knocking he was puffing he was banging around but he was fine amen see what man achieves on the earth amen for their Maid of things which do not appear amen God was able to achieve somebody say God was able to achieve amen something by Spirit-filled people who were hungering and thirsting and those amen that would stay with the word listen been horrible amen and the Wright brothers never broke through amen by going back to what the horse and buggy done amen they never broke through by settling amen for the speed of the T model forward amen but there was a hunger and there was a thirst amen there's higher Heights amen there's got to be a quicker speed there's going to be a higher altitude we can go to an Old Church of the Living God Amen don't you let your struggles and don't you let your situations cause you Amen to settle for just a horse and buggy amen settle for just an automobile come on let's go ahead and preach we're here amen don't even settle for an automobile amen there's an astronaut anointing that has been released under this adoption message and you can climb into the spaceship and you can go above the oats of the horse and bucket you can go above the e87 of the automobile you can go above the Jet Plane Fuel and you can stay up into an astronaut ship with the master astronaut himself and his name is none other than Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday that day forever and what his word said he would do he is here to do well glory to God I feel good it's time to be astronauts it's time to rise above I'm in this puffing and pain and flying and clatter chatter chatter amen climb up into a place with God where there's a spiritual hunger there's a spiritual desire the Bible said blessed are they we're still hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled remember said what is righteousness he said righteousness is his word then God was able to achieve the astronaut amen by those who were hungry and were thirsting for the Fulfillment of the righteousness of God Reverend I said look what God's been with his church now we've entered the age what did Paul say he said that in the ages to come he might show what is the exceeding of his riches and Grace amen we have entered the age not no more horse and buggy not no more automobile no more airplane but now there's astronauts somebody preached with me astronauts oh yeah what a great thing this is an astronaut age amen the horse and buggy was Earthbound somebody say Earthbound the horse and buggy was Earthbound amen but now we are in an astronaut age and so has the church he said that's the big swing over then I cannot get before the people amen they have settled down for an airplane some of them settle for a horse and buggy amen but God has got an astronaut H amen amen God has got higher Heights amen sister and he's got deeper dips he's got somewhere the church can go amen beyond the chatter chatter amen beyond the Puffin beyond the just beyond the busted water jackets they own the dead batteries they own the busted piston rings amen but she can go into a place with God where regardless of what she's going through her position is inhibited a place is in Christ Jesus now you say what brought about this I'll tell you what done it amen was the full restoration of the word amen is the achievement of God to bring forth Faith to put the bride in the Rapture if the word is not restored then there's not Faith to go in the Rapture if the word is not restored then there's not Grace to go into your heart Amen to take a Rapture because the bride is going to take the Rapture by the word which is the full word this bride will take a Rapture amen by the full word which was restored under the voice of Malachi 4 which was revealed under the third pull of the seventh Angels Ministry it was the Fulfillment of Joel the second chapter when he said I

Palmer worm everything that's eating it down now watch this the four death Messengers amen eat that tree down amen but to fully restore it amen will take four life Messengers Amen to combat with the four death Messengers done to the tree now can I just preach to you what the prophet said he said now notice your Masterpiece the life that was in the husk Amen in the stalk in the tassel in the husk amen it all gathers in the seed come on Church everything that was in the horse and buggy is in the astronaut everything that was in the automobile is in the astronauts everything ever come on Amen every scientific achievement mounted up into the final achievement of the astronauts amen everything that was in justification is in this bride everything that was in sanctification is in this bride everything that was in the baptism of the Holy Ghost under the restoration of the gifts is in this bride amen see all of the life gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went into the other to make the other and then he turns and says justification made a way for sanctification and sanctification made a way for what the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen people say well that's as high as we can go amen but God was able to achieve amen through those who would stay with his word amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost Amen brother Branson made a way for the Holy Ghost itself Amen to come right down in Perfection amen back to the word again to manifest itself listen friends we have not come here Amen to manifest the Creed we have not come here to manifest a Dogma we have not come here to manifest depression and to manifest complexes and to manifest nervousness amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen has called us into this age Amen to manifest the word in its fullness in its entirety in the deity of the person of Jesus Christ listen amen amen Shake Yourself Faith Tabernacle you got a job to do you got a commission upon you you got to finish line the cross and that is to manifest the full word again like it was in the beginning oh man you're not just manifesting justification you're not just manifesting sanctification or even the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but the baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way for the Holy Ghost itself can we say that together the Holy Ghost itself remember said it's time that God will fulfill his word the things that I do will you do also even more than this for I go into my father see it's time for God to prove that his word is truth not only a mythical story not like a Buddha where they produce psychology the Buddhist the Molly Molly is over kind no but there's not another religion under the skies that can produce the signs and the wonders of a resurrected Jesus Christ except somebody accept the Holy Ghost itself working in the people so the Holy Ghost itself amen is not an eighth age with an eighth messenger with an eighth Day idea amen the Holy Ghost itself is the word that was in the stalk in the shuck in the tassel has gathered into the seed Amen to Bear forth and to produce a yield the true Easter seal he said but God give them something then that they cannot destroy is the supernatural spirit it's the Holy Ghost itself and it's infallible and it's imperishable and it cannot be destroyed it'll live on and on and on and because he lives amen we live with him because we're sealed in the body of the Lord Jesus no way no way to ever be destroyed well that ought to make you put your shouting shoes on Amen there's no way you can ever be destroyed I'm going to give you some stuff to fight with okay that devil is trying to destroy you it's time you remind that therefore the anointing that you're under is not that of just testification or just sanctification or just the dip in the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost itself in perishable amen the undestroitable amen the supernatural Spirit that's infallible has come into your flesh and it is coming there in the form of eternal life testimony of a true witness God's witness the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost itself amen living in us would never affiliate itself an organization because you cannot organize God and the same thing that happened to them will happen to these in the last days in the evening lights like it was back there in the influence of another 62. how can you hold the office of God's anointed and deny his anointed word which is himself in word form my the word of God's anointed is the word itself in word form how can you deny the word is right and then still say your anoints with the spirit the only thing that'll manifest the word of God is the Holy Ghost itself the Branson then he turns and says when he the Holy Ghost will come he will take these things of mine and will show them to you see and Be not Afraid in 1963 he said I believe in child and I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in interpretation of times I believe in Divine Healing I believe in all those things but yet it's something better than that it's the birth itself are you ready for this it's the Holy Ghost itself coming in US those things are fine that's good but it's like the colored man eating watermelon he said there's more of it you got to go on and to love and joy and peace and long suffering and gentleness and patience amen and the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen burns into the life then we could have a testimony meeting about what God is doing in our midst come on I love testimonies from other churches amen but what about our church amen what's God doing it will you say brother Andrew God ain't doing much well I resent that line devil amen because I'm looking at a house full of Miracles tonight I'm looking at people who have lived another week in Satan's eating and they're still got a mind to serve God they've been they're not denying that God exists they're not denying the message is the truth amen come on church tell me where is that coming from it is coming from the position that's the word has elevated you into come on Amen without this message we're just as iconic as the other six billion people on the face of the Earth amen but with this message we have broke beyond the Earthbound Realms of cyclonic and psychology and all these troubles of the mind and Troubles of the spirit and we have broke into a place where our soul has come face to face with God and we are anchored not to the next convention not to the next Youth Camp but we are sealed until the day of our Redemption listen we realize the word is in us the Holy Ghost has come upon us he is bringing those things that he taught into our hearts it's the Holy Ghost itself come on I'm just giving you a few quotes of hours of a long study on that fourth word the Holy Ghost itself the Holy Ghost itself amen is coming and he is a revealer of the written word and he is a solar of the things to come then pray tell me when did the revelation of the Seven Seals break out under a Pentecostal anointing of laodicea or under a word birth amen of the restoration of the voice of God come on Church it broke out under the voice of Revelation 10 7 because the Holy Ghost itself is a revealer of the written word come on pray tell me amen when were we hearing about things it is to be was that under the first pull under the second pull amen it was under that third pull that we heard modern events are made clear by prophecy brother Sean it was under that third pull that we heard the Rapture and the future and the future home and the things are to be come on it took a prophet church amen when I might as well preach I feel good it took a prophet to stand in the pulpitian sister Jane and look at the clock on the wall and say the time is now struck too amen the second pull this over and the third pull is at hand amen and announced to the church amen the word has come into effect amen by the revelation of the son of man I'm on church amen it's not time to get depressed it's time to smile like you never smiled before it's not time to talk about turning around and giving up amen it's time to put your running shoes on I can hear the prophet say it as plain as I'm standing here oh God give me courage Amen to take the sword in my hand and March forward to that third pull amen because in that third pool is where the power of the word is laying to overcome the devil oh God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost itself has come into the church he is a revealer of the written word notice this and a shower of things to come remember said watch those two pools healing first pull prophesy on second pull look at this shall what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ now watch a prophet right here brother watch him take a turn he said lady you're very sick you're nervous got a stomach trouble you're almost a nervous breakdown do you believe God will heal you Mary believe with all your heart Jesus Christ will give you your desire watch two pools in a matter of a few seconds you're sick you've got a stomach trouble first pull amen but the second poor Mary do you believe with all your heart amen that Jesus Christ will give you your desire watch him saying he's on your lap what was he doing in that tape he was bringing the god of Heaven out of the throne into your lap he's on your lap see here is the late now let me back up I'm not saying he's not on his throne he was bringing him into your presence by the revelation of his word to show you what are you going to do with it see he said here is a little lady sitting here praying looking right at me heads down raise up and look at me good person you're not from here you come from away from here New York but if you believe that Jesus Christ makes you well he will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost what's your spiritual healing backed up with a physical healing he'll give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you believe that mistress Brian from New York do you believe with all your heart amen and you can receive the Holy Ghost right now Mrs Bryan Mrs Mary do you believe you can receive the Holy Ghost right now then watch him turn it's in your lap friends do you believe it the word making itself manifest come on what did he say justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person the Holy Ghost itself and what is the Holy Ghost he's the Messiah and what is the Messiah the anointed word he said Do you believe it the word is in your midst making itself manifest do you believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today in favor I don't know these people God is my judge amen but Jesus Christ knows him and what will you do with this anointed word see as it was in the days of Sodom amen then so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now watch a prophet bring it right down to a Razor's Edge if this part is true if this part is true brother Samaya if what part is true if the part that says you got a stomach trouble and your name is mistress Mary and you come from New York Mrs Brown if this part is true amen then the message that I preach is true come on church if the discernment and the prophesying was the truth amen then the message was the truth and where did they say he went off they said he went off when he got out of the first pool out of the second pull and stepped over in the third pool amen but the third power amen was the bringing of a perfect word to make you a Perfect Bride Amen to go into a perfect sure I'm on church if that part was true then I say whatever is King within me this message is the truth it's the Holy Ghost itself I'm on the direct quote it's the Holy Ghost itself doing its own interpreting that it's right come on when that Holy Ghost itself comes into the church it will be the voice of God himself interpreting his own word by bringing it to pass can you say Amen the Holy Ghost itself oh believe it with all your heart now you say brother Andrew I don't know well I know you were ordained to believe this message brother Tim you was ordained to believe this message somebody said to me not long ago so well I didn't see the sign I didn't hear the voice well

guys wouldn't listen to tapes because brother Bram said on tape he said see the sign believe the voice he never emphasized just don't believe in the sign he emphasized on seeing the sign but believing the voice and the only way you can believe the voice is you are elected to hear the voice and when you hear the voice amen it's more than a theological voice amen it's a scripture voice that is sounding Out a scriptural truth see you were ordained to believe this message you were ordained to see the sign you were ordained to believe the voice I love what Isaiah 62 says in verse 11 behold the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say it is the daughter of sound who has signed the bride amen Behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work is before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called sought out amen a city not forsaken amen this bride amen is the salt out amen by the word of her age Easter Seals 65 brother Terry you was there amen it's the Holy Spirit today amen hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message amen not that will believe just because he said you're Mrs Mary or you're Mrs Brown or you're from New York amen but because they will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to the believer and when you accept it in its fullness and God knows you will do it he comes down and gives you the abstract to it and then every promise that's made is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is here to Quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see the great God the Holy Spirit here to do that power think of it when the Holy Ghost itself is here to Bear record of this hour in verse 65 you didn't learn it by the books
