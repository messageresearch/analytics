[38:35] praise the elders and Angels
[38:40] bow the
[38:42] redeemed worship you
[38:46] now holy
[38:48] holy holy
[38:51] are you
[38:56] Lord you know we we have been given an
[38:59] opportunity
[39:00] to to see the Lord uh in in the most
[39:05] spectacular way than than the
[39:08] generations before us amen for he's been
[39:13] you know hidden but in this day he has
[39:17] he has revealed himself and we see him
[39:20] totally totally
[39:22] unveiled in in in the age that we're
[39:25] living in and we find that there's
[39:27] there's no room for personalities
[39:30] there's no room for Kingdom Builders
[39:32] there's no room it's left nothing but
[39:35] Christ
[39:36] alone and uh I am so thankful for that
[39:40] that when we sing such songs as this
[39:43] it's not just because we've heard about
[39:45] him 2,000 years ago but he has truly
[39:48] been revealed to us that we can openly
[39:51] declare openly see him that he is Holy
[39:56] he is worthy
[39:57] and I'm I'm so glad for that uh you can
[40:02] have your seats for just a moment uh I
[40:04] tell you we we had such a wonderful
[40:07] meeting um this year and it seems like
[40:10] every year it just gets better and um
[40:15] the ministry uh that was brought forth
[40:19] um was just really uh incredible and you
[40:24] would have thought that uh they all sat
[40:26] in a room
[40:28] and uh talked on what they were going to
[40:30] speak
[40:31] on uh but I believe it was all divinely
[40:34] orchestrated of God and all the
[40:37] ministers you know they said well we
[40:38] didn't know what the other one was going
[40:40] to speak on and but yet it was just
[40:43] continuity uh all the way through and
[40:46] and um I certainly
[40:48] appreciate uh ministers that will uh
[40:51] just lend their heart over lend
[40:54] themselves over to let the Lord speak
[40:57] and I truly believe that the Lord did I
[41:00] I believe that there were many many
[41:02] things that took place uh in in the
[41:06] services uh the prayer line uh this year
[41:10] it just seemed like uh it was so
[41:14] Supernatural um you know all of the uh
[41:18] you know I've been in prayer lines
[41:19] before and and uh helping with it and
[41:24] and there is there's just a power there
[41:27] but this this year it just seemed like
[41:29] it was greater than than I've ever seen
[41:32] before and U you know just um I've
[41:37] always been amazed you know here uh at
[41:41] at where at this the camp um you know I
[41:45] I stand in the front where the line is
[41:48] where it starts and and just kind of um
[41:52] uh direct you know helping the line to
[41:54] go you know to go um smooth smooth and
[41:58] um and you know I see them little guys
[42:02] uh how they they don't know why they're
[42:03] just there in the prayer line and uh
[42:07] maybe kind of looking around seeing
[42:08] what's going on and then they hit that
[42:10] certain spot um where that anointing is
[42:14] is at and and you just start to see them
[42:16] just cry and just then they don't really
[42:18] know why they're crying uh but this year
[42:21] um we've seen that but also uh seen some
[42:26] of them just just uh they they get to
[42:29] that certain spot and they can't stand
[42:32] and they're they're trying their best to
[42:34] hold on that to to you know and and end
[42:37] up just falling out and uh without hands
[42:41] being laid on them or whatever but it
[42:43] was just a a real
[42:45] Supernatural and uh
[42:47] one uh man you know uh had told a
[42:51] brother said you know it says I I it's
[42:54] been either a long time since we've been
[42:57] to a meeting or uh but he says I've
[43:00] never felt such a a
[43:02] presence uh like I did you know when
[43:06] went into that through the prayer line
[43:08] say there was just something that that
[43:10] I've never felt before he said and he
[43:13] said I've left a changed person and um
[43:17] so you know we we certainly appreciate
[43:19] that and we've got
[43:21] testimonies of uh and I'll read to you
[43:24] later about them of what God has done in
[43:28] in different individuals lives and so we
[43:31] we certainly appreciate the Lord uh uh
[43:34] working in a supernatural way from the
[43:37] beginning of the meeting to the end of
[43:39] it and uh I just love the Lord I want to
[43:44] just to say thank you to all um to all
[43:49] of you who helped in the meeting before
[43:53] the meeting during and then
[43:55] after uh
[43:57] uh and no matter what part you played
[44:00] whether it's just cooking something or
[44:03] or helping serve in the line or um
[44:08] whether it's prayer whether it's
[44:09] cleaning the
[44:11] restroom uh whether it's
[44:14] just uh helping with the ushering or
[44:17] working in the prayer line uh whatever
[44:21] you did it was no small
[44:24] task uh even the brothers with the golf
[44:27] carts uh uh helping bring the people
[44:31] down to the tent and with the
[44:34] parking um everything was so needed and
[44:39] it it it it was a a very very great
[44:43] blessing to us and uh to the to help the
[44:47] the meeting go
[44:49] smoothly and um I know it was a lot of
[44:52] work um but uh you you did it uh um
[44:57] willingly from the heart and to me
[44:59] that's what makes the difference and I
[45:02] believe that the Lord will um honor that
[45:06] and we'll will bless you in a in a great
[45:10] way uh the the food was just uh very
[45:14] very good and and um brother will you
[45:17] just do the best at chick cooking
[45:19] chicken it it was good and and we really
[45:23] appreciate you putting your all into
[45:26] that and he uh I heard the the pork just
[45:29] didn't get done at at that time but uh I
[45:33] want to help you with that too uh but we
[45:37] uh we appreciate brother will uh giving
[45:40] his time appreciate uh uh all the the
[45:44] leaders brother Tim uh taking that
[45:47] responsibility on his shoulders uh to
[45:50] get us all lined up on how to get that
[45:53] tent set right and I'm going to tell you
[45:56] that that tent uh endured a lot of
[46:00] wind and um
[46:03] rain uh before the meeting and there was
[46:07] not one sag in that thing I mean it it
[46:10] uh it went just really well and uh uh so
[46:15] brother Tim just really took it uh there
[46:18] and and helped us out and I really
[46:21] appreciate that and also helping us uh
[46:24] we were supposed to be taking the tent
[46:26] down today
[46:28] um and uh but due to the weather uh we
[46:33] uh in the forecast there we decided spur
[46:36] of a moment to uh take it down uh Friday
[46:40] evening and appreciate the brothers that
[46:42] were able to come and to help us and of
[46:45] course it went down easier than it went
[46:48] up and uh but we really appreciate that
[46:52] and appreciate uh Sister Kim weeks for
[46:57] uh taking that responsibility on getting
[46:59] all the food prepared and buying it and
[47:02] and preparing the menu and uh just
[47:05] making sure that everything just went
[47:07] smoothly appreciate you sisters for just
[47:11] endeavoring as the Bible would say
[47:13] keeping the unity of the spirit and I
[47:15] heard y'all just had a a a good time as
[47:19] far as a atmosphere was great and I
[47:23] appreciate that appreciate you Brothers
[47:25] putting when we put up the tent or even
[47:28] working uh just the past I guess we've
[47:31] been working the past month um some of
[47:34] us brothers and of course the sisters
[47:37] but endeavoring to keep that Unity of
[47:40] the spirit no matter you know of course
[47:42] when when you're all together and we're
[47:44] all working you know something some hurt
[47:47] feeling or some little thing will be
[47:49] said or whatever and but we always were
[47:52] able to squash it and U uh remember who
[47:56] we were and who we are and and uh I just
[47:59] appreciate that very much and I just say
[48:03] God bless you to all of you who have
[48:06] labored uh sister Martha taken that
[48:08] responsibility to um uh to put everybody
[48:13] up in the cabins and and and that's
[48:15] that's a responsibility in itself and a
[48:18] challenge and we certainly appreciate
[48:21] everything that was done and I hope I
[48:24] don't leave anyone out but um I just
[48:27] want to say that all of your work was
[48:29] very very much
[48:31] appreciated and um I uh thinking of
[48:35] Hebrews the 6th chapter the 10th verse
[48:39] where it says for God is Not unrighteous
[48:41] to forget your work and labor of love
[48:44] which you have showed toward his name in
[48:46] that you have ministered to the Saints
[48:49] and do Minister and I believe that's
[48:52] what was done this past week was not
[48:55] only the ministry standing behind the
[48:57] pulpit but every every part was a
[49:00] Ministry ministering and um uh we we
[49:04] just certainly appreciate that very much
[49:06] and I um uh I will read uh
[49:10] one uh uh maybe a a a deal here uh from
[49:17] sister and she said words cannot
[49:19] describe the power of a long weekend in
[49:22] the presence of the Lord Jesus and
[49:24] fellow Believers we spent 30 Thursday
[49:27] through Sunday at Faith Tabernacle
[49:29] annual tent meetings with brother Shawn
[49:30] Martin with his brothers brother Wendell
[49:33] and brother Jonathan as well as others
[49:35] the preaching uh preaching the powerful
[49:38] message of Jesus Christ she said I
[49:41] didn't want to go I was so exhausted
[49:43] from three trips to Arkansas along with
[49:46] the grief and emotional and pH physical
[49:49] strain of supporting my grieving sister
[49:53] and best friend I just wanted to stay
[49:56] home sleep and cry but we packed up our
[49:59] family and drove the six hours and oh it
[50:03] was so worth it the campground itself is
[50:06] in a beautiful mountainous setting
[50:08] restful to the soul and body we camped
[50:11] in A Primitive uh cabin on the grounds
[50:14] with no driving for those four days just
[50:16] walking up and down the hills from our
[50:19] cabin to the tent and occasionally
[50:21] getting a lift on the golf cart to save
[50:23] my sore knee uh four days of no cooking
[50:26] or shopping the food was all prepared on
[50:29] the grounds by an amazing army of men
[50:31] and women feeding up to a thousand
[50:33] people four days of Glorious worship and
[50:36] word four days of amazing fellowship and
[50:40] sleep said I chose to sleep every
[50:43] afternoon instead of fellowshipping
[50:45] which if you know me is not typical but
[50:48] I needed to rest and restore and on the
[50:51] night of the prayer line I entered into
[50:52] the presence of the Lord and the Holy
[50:55] Spirit got a hold of me and I danced
[50:57] with arms raised like I hadn't even had
[51:00] shoulder surgery now my range of motion
[51:05] is so much better I feel stronger rested
[51:08] rejuvenated truly the Lord Jesus still
[51:11] does miracles in our day amen and that's
[51:14] just the one of many that have been
[51:17] coming forth from the the the meeting
[51:19] and so we certainly appreciate that I
[51:22] know uh I've asked brother Ronnie long
[51:25] to minister today
[51:27] uh due to just being busy setting every
[51:30] putting away everything and and uh we
[51:33] certainly love brother Ronnie very much
[51:36] and enjoyed his ministry so I he was
[51:40] gracious enough to come and but his wife
[51:44] uh just received a real touch of the
[51:46] Lord as well and been struggling for a
[51:49] few years in a certain area but God just
[51:53] totally delivered her uh this year and
[51:56] so we we just thank the Lord for that
[51:59] and
[52:00] um just God is
[52:03] good and uh so uh just want you to know
[52:08] your your efforts your labor is not in
[52:10] vain at all and uh we we love you and
[52:15] and I uh we love God's people we love
[52:18] the Lord Jesus Christ and um it's good
[52:22] to have Dad uh with us and Mom and uh
[52:26] dad came up well both come up for the
[52:28] meeting but Dad wasn't able to make it
[52:31] uh a couple times he was dressed to go
[52:33] and and just wasn't able to make it but
[52:36] um he's here this morning and so we're
[52:39] just really glad to to have him and um
[52:43] um but we could just stand to our feet
[52:46] and um and it's good to have our our
[52:49] visitor back there was and sister Bonnie
[52:52] as well uh good to have her back with us
[52:55] and and and uh sure love sister Bonnie
[52:59] uh very much and and uh just love God's
[53:02] people amen and uh how many's expecting
[53:06] God to speak to us this morning amen um
[53:10] we had cancelled service and we'll still
[53:13] have no service tonight but uh let's
[53:16] just put our all into it today this
[53:19] morning and may God just speak I enjoy
[53:21] that song enjoyed all the songs but
[53:24] thinking as brother Matthew was saying
[53:26] there just singing God just speak to our
[53:29] hearts amen I I want to know what God
[53:32] has to say and uh there's a lot that he
[53:35] has in store for us as his people and uh
[53:40] thinking of how that um uh you know when
[53:43] God in MDC in the form of Flesh he he
[53:48] said how can I keep my secrets from
[53:50] Abraham saying that he's my friend and I
[53:54] thought of that um uh and how how that
[53:56] God couldn't withhold the Mysteries he
[53:59] couldn't withhold them things within
[54:01] himself and as the Bible says the
[54:04] secrets of the Lord belong the secrets
[54:06] belong to the Lord but that which is
[54:08] revealed belongs to us and I say God
[54:11] reveal it to us today speak to our
[54:14] hearts amen praise the Lord so let's
[54:17] just sing the song Here's my cup Lord as
[54:21] brother Ronnie will come and share
[54:23] what's on his heart oh he here's my
[54:28] cup

[58:09] man that guy can cook
[58:11] chicken praise the Lord we thank you for
[58:13] all your efforts and of course goes
[58:15] without saying I just Echo what brother
[58:17] sea said that it's um there's something
[58:21] special in this time and age when you
[58:23] see people just just come together to
[58:26] serve God's people and I believe he's
[58:28] he's smiling upon it I believe he's
[58:30] pleased
[58:31] amen praise the Lord and we don't want
[58:33] to take too much time
[58:35] today but let's turn to the book of
[58:38] Hebrews the 2 chapter
[58:57] it's kind of
[58:58] like a message is kind of like cooking
[59:00] chicken you just need a little bit more
[59:02] time sometimes
[59:05] but but it all works out right we can't
[59:09] get to it all in one service but we're
[59:11] just going to uh enter into a portion
[59:13] here I'd like to speak for a few moments
[59:14] this morning on uh the voice of
[59:18] Grace Hebrews the 2 chapter but in one
[59:21] certain place the sixth verse testified
[59:23] saying what is man that thou art mine of
[59:26] him or the son of man that thou visitest
[59:28] him thou mest him a little lower than
[59:30] the Angels thou crownest him with glory
[59:33] and honor and did set him over the works
[59:35] of thy hands and thou Hast put all
[59:37] things in subjection under his feet for
[59:39] in that he put all in subjection under
[59:42] him and he left nothing that is not put
[59:44] under him but now we see not yet all
[59:47] things put under him but we see Jesus
[59:49] who has made a little lower than the
[59:52] angels for the suffering of death
[59:54] crowned with Glory andon honor that he
[59:57] by the grace of God should taste death
[1:00:00] for every man for it became him for whom
[1:00:03] all are all things and by whom are all
[1:00:05] things and bringing many sons unto glory
[1:00:08] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:00:10] perfect through sufferings for both he
[1:00:13] that sanctifieth and they who are
[1:00:15] Sanctified are all of one for which
[1:00:18] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[1:00:20] Brethren saying I will declare thy name
[1:00:22] unto my brethren in the midst of the
[1:00:24] church will I sing praise unto thee and
[1:00:26] again I will put my trust in him and
[1:00:28] again behold I and the children which
[1:00:30] God hath given me for as much then as
[1:00:33] the children are partakers of Flesh and
[1:00:34] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[1:00:37] of the same that through death he might
[1:00:39] destroy him that had the power of death
[1:00:42] and that is the devil and deliver them
[1:00:44] through through who through fear of
[1:00:47] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:00:49] bondage for verily he took not on him
[1:00:52] the nature of angels but he took on him
[1:00:55] the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all
[1:00:56] things it behooved him to be made like
[1:00:59] unto his Brethren that he might be a
[1:01:01] merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:01:03] things pertaining to God to make
[1:01:05] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:01:07] people for in that he himself has
[1:01:09] suffered being tempted he is able to
[1:01:12] secure them that are tempted amen may
[1:01:14] God bless this word this morning you can
[1:01:16] be seated so we read here in this
[1:01:19] passage of scripture that that that
[1:01:21] death is to be conquered but there is a
[1:01:24] process of this right there's a process
[1:01:25] process of this uh uh um overthrow of
[1:01:29] death and and so if we just kind of go
[1:01:31] back a little bit in in in this in this
[1:01:34] scripture we we know that in the
[1:01:36] beginning it was a perfect harmony with
[1:01:39] man and God and we could go back into
[1:01:41] Genesis and we could see where Adam had
[1:01:43] that relationship with God and where
[1:01:45] they communed one with another and you
[1:01:47] know you could just kind of put yourself
[1:01:48] in Adam's shoes where you're walking uh
[1:01:51] with your father through the garden and
[1:01:53] everything is calm and all is well and
[1:01:56] just kind of puts his arm on you and
[1:01:57] everything feels like it's going to be
[1:01:59] okay and you know just without a worry
[1:02:01] without a fear with you know he could he
[1:02:04] could command nature he could command
[1:02:05] the Seas he could he could do all the
[1:02:08] things that God could do for he was a
[1:02:10] God he was just as God was and and and
[1:02:14] and and to see that Interruption take
[1:02:16] place something took place to interrupt
[1:02:18] that and that was lost so we could say
[1:02:21] it Adam had dominion over something that
[1:02:25] we do not have Dominion of right now
[1:02:27] right and that would be the access to
[1:02:28] all those Dimensions so when when there
[1:02:31] was a fall that took place uh and this I
[1:02:33] know this is little Sunday school we we
[1:02:35] aware but I just want to background this
[1:02:37] a little bit but but there's a fall that
[1:02:39] took place and something was lost and
[1:02:41] fell down below where Adam could reach
[1:02:44] right there was there was something that
[1:02:46] fell down below where Adam could get to
[1:02:49] and he lost access to to what his
[1:02:52] Dominion was and now God God could just
[1:02:55] you know remain in those in those
[1:02:56] greater seven dimensions and he could go
[1:02:58] to and fro as he pleased but Adam lost
[1:03:00] access to those areas because he had
[1:03:03] fallen down and those keys if we could
[1:03:05] put it like that Keys fell down lower
[1:03:06] than Adam could get there right and they
[1:03:09] fell down below the reach of Adam and
[1:03:11] there there had to have been something
[1:03:12] to take place in order for that to be
[1:03:15] redeemed right and that's what brother
[1:03:16] brandom says that that's what time is is
[1:03:18] is it's a Plan of Redemption it's that's
[1:03:21] when time started and there was a there
[1:03:23] was an interruption in the eternal
[1:03:25] Circle where a Redemption plan would
[1:03:28] come to pass and brother B say that's
[1:03:29] all time is is it's just time for
[1:03:32] Redemption it's not it's not just a
[1:03:34] punishment or a sentence but it's a time
[1:03:36] of redemption for us that Jesus can
[1:03:39] restore back all that Adam lost right
[1:03:41] that's what the prophet said and all
[1:03:43] that Adam lost will be restored back to
[1:03:45] the church and I believe there's only
[1:03:47] one Avenue that is going to get restored
[1:03:49] back to the church and it's through the
[1:03:50] grace of Jesus Christ and somebody had
[1:03:53] to go and redeem back what Adam lost
[1:03:56] and bring it back to its original
[1:03:58] condition and this person would have to
[1:04:00] have the ability to not only descend for
[1:04:03] any man could descend that low but also
[1:04:06] Ascend so there would be a greater power
[1:04:08] than just to descend to the deeps but it
[1:04:10] would have to be a power that would be
[1:04:11] able to ascend back to restore back to
[1:04:14] where it once was so we we we can see
[1:04:17] through the fall of mankind that there
[1:04:19] was there's there every man that's ever
[1:04:21] been born under sin was was born shaped
[1:04:24] in iniquity uh you know full of trouble
[1:04:26] short of day speaking lies nobody had to
[1:04:28] teach you how to how to lie or how to
[1:04:31] steal or how to uh you know misuse your
[1:04:34] your your manipulation or nobody had to
[1:04:36] teach you how to do that but a child a
[1:04:38] very small child you can see that they
[1:04:40] will try to even manipulated a situation
[1:04:42] for their benefit and it's just
[1:04:44] something that comes naturally to them
[1:04:46] but I believe we're being restored back
[1:04:48] to a a supernatural people not just a
[1:04:51] natural relationship with our with our
[1:04:53] serpent nature but a supernatural
[1:04:55] relationship with where we came from to
[1:04:57] be restored back to that original where
[1:05:00] Adam was so there would have to be
[1:05:02] something that would take this man Jesus
[1:05:04] far enough down where he could access
[1:05:07] those keys cuz when Lucifer fell and he
[1:05:09] was cast out of Heaven he had those keys
[1:05:11] with him to those Dimensions right he
[1:05:14] had the keys with him to power over
[1:05:16] death hell in the grave and he took
[1:05:17] those down with him and they were in his
[1:05:19] ownership so every man from Adam on
[1:05:22] would have to to go by the doorway of
[1:05:25] those ke they would have to come under
[1:05:27] the submission of the one who held those
[1:05:29] keys which would be Lucifer himself to
[1:05:31] hold the keys to death Hell In The Grave
[1:05:34] right but I believe we're coming to an
[1:05:36] age and now now in that age where death
[1:05:38] has no power over the church hell has no
[1:05:41] power over the church but somehow this
[1:05:44] must have been redeemed back to man and
[1:05:46] not just one man but a group of
[1:05:48] Believers that would put on the mind of
[1:05:50] Christ so there's access to these
[1:05:52] Dimensions here but it would take a
[1:05:54] process of time
[1:05:56] in order for Jesus to go down there so
[1:05:59] we could just go on a little journey for
[1:06:01] for a little bit here on Jesus's walk
[1:06:03] and so God puts himself he puts himself
[1:06:06] into this man Christ Jesus and he's
[1:06:08] walking among flesh and he could have
[1:06:09] put of course we know you know the 42nd
[1:06:12] generation of Jesus Christ he could have
[1:06:13] put himself into Levi's tribe or you
[1:06:16] know anywhere he wanted but he put
[1:06:17] himself in judah's tribe where there was
[1:06:19] troubles and there was there was uh
[1:06:21] there was prostitutes and there was
[1:06:23] unbelievers and there was you know David
[1:06:25] and there was Tamar and there was ruths
[1:06:27] and there was and he put himself down
[1:06:29] into that line to prove a point that his
[1:06:32] grace would be greater than what we go
[1:06:34] through on this Earth and so he places
[1:06:37] himself into this line of Judah and by
[1:06:40] this Fallen root he's going to restore
[1:06:42] all of judah's names back onto the book
[1:06:45] right because Judah wasn't a very looked
[1:06:47] after name it wasn't very uh it wasn't
[1:06:49] the Priestly tribe it wasn't the ones
[1:06:51] that were reading the Scrolls or the pH
[1:06:54] the Pharisees sitting there but it was
[1:06:55] just plain old the line of Judah but
[1:06:57] that's where Jesus came and I thank God
[1:06:59] that he comes not based in our names or
[1:07:01] our our genealogy or what this Earth had
[1:07:04] for us before but he comes based on the
[1:07:06] heart that's within us by a seed he
[1:07:08] placed in there so he knew that the seed
[1:07:11] was in the line of Judah and he would
[1:07:13] take and place his name there in that
[1:07:15] line and so he comes into this line he
[1:07:17] begins to fellowship and I just I just
[1:07:19] started to think on these things that
[1:07:21] Jesus would put himself into flesh and
[1:07:24] and he didn't find you didn't find Jesus
[1:07:26] in the synagogue you didn't find him in
[1:07:27] the great church you didn't find him
[1:07:29] wearing a fancy suit or you know wearing
[1:07:31] fancy garments or driving a nice car or
[1:07:34] living in a nice house but you found
[1:07:36] Jesus among the common people that's
[1:07:38] that's where God likes to dwell as among
[1:07:40] the common people because we recognize
[1:07:43] as common people that we can't do this
[1:07:44] on our own there's no amount of merits
[1:07:47] that we could reach or amount of
[1:07:48] strength we could reach or amount of
[1:07:50] studying we could reach to to be able to
[1:07:52] have this restoration but we need him
[1:07:55] and that's why he comes to people that
[1:07:57] recognize we need him it's nothing we
[1:08:00] can do in our own strength but we are he
[1:08:02] came to the lowest of the low and I just
[1:08:04] you know if we take this journey with
[1:08:06] Jesus as he's walking along he doesn't
[1:08:08] find his disciples in the
[1:08:11] Seminary he doesn't find his disciples
[1:08:13] in the in the great riches or the tajma
[1:08:15] Halls he he finds them fishing somewhere
[1:08:18] and you know he goes to Peter who's
[1:08:20] who's maybe not even wearing clothes
[1:08:22] that day and he's out on his boat
[1:08:23] somewhere and he doesn't come to him
[1:08:25] with great words or great you know a
[1:08:27] great thunder lightning crossed across
[1:08:29] Peter's life but he just simply said hey
[1:08:32] Peter are you catching fish today what
[1:08:34] what are you doing out there why why are
[1:08:36] you here and began to just begin to to
[1:08:38] have a communion with him but he knew
[1:08:40] all along there was a seed within Peter
[1:08:42] and at the right time Peter would
[1:08:44] recognize who he was right so he didn't
[1:08:46] come to the churches and and to find
[1:08:48] that and I wonder where where we were
[1:08:50] when he came to find us and we have
[1:08:52] seeds within us and at some point Jesus
[1:08:55] is Jesus has crossed our path and
[1:08:57] ignited that seed within us and for a
[1:09:00] lot of us we were sitting in some church
[1:09:02] somewhere or maybe we were labeled a
[1:09:04] Methodist or a 7-Day Adventist or maybe
[1:09:06] we were in a church called the message
[1:09:07] of the hour that was the denomination
[1:09:09] but somewhere Jesus came across our path
[1:09:12] and spoke to that seed and we became
[1:09:15] awakened to that but Peter had already
[1:09:17] lived a life somewhere in his 30s and
[1:09:20] what happened to all of the sins that
[1:09:22] Peter had committed
[1:09:26] what happened to all of Peter's life and
[1:09:28] there he is and and and he becomes a
[1:09:30] friend to Jesus and then he denies him
[1:09:32] three times but yet Jesus has already
[1:09:35] prayed for him so what happened to that
[1:09:37] unbelief that Peter had committed what
[1:09:39] what happened to the denial of Christ so
[1:09:42] somebody had to be owed that right
[1:09:43] because somebody has the keys to those
[1:09:45] three things and they've got to have
[1:09:47] their their payment it would be it would
[1:09:49] be like if I if I asked Branson to
[1:09:51] borrow $200 and I said hey can I have
[1:09:53] $200 today to get home and you know he
[1:09:55] gives me $200 reluctantly but you know
[1:09:58] he he he sees that I need to get home
[1:10:00] and so I take the $200 I spend it I go
[1:10:04] home and I'm thinking I've got to pay
[1:10:06] him back the $200 but then Judah calls
[1:10:08] me and Judah says you know what that
[1:10:10] money you owee Branson you don't have to
[1:10:12] pay him
[1:10:13] back well that sounds good to me but
[1:10:16] Branson still owed the Money Right
[1:10:18] Branson still owed some money and and
[1:10:20] I've got to pay it back so who's going
[1:10:22] to pay the debt so then Branson's
[1:10:24] immediately going to call Judah and say
[1:10:27] hey where where's this money going to
[1:10:29] come from why'd you tell that guy I
[1:10:30] didn't have to you didn't I didn't have
[1:10:32] to pay him back where where's my money
[1:10:34] at see there was still a transfer took
[1:10:36] place and every sin that was ever
[1:10:38] committed somebody's going to have to
[1:10:39] pay the price for that sin it doesn't
[1:10:41] just disappear but where did it go where
[1:10:44] did that sin go but it had to go
[1:10:46] somewhere it had to go on somebody's
[1:10:48] account somewhere and and somebody would
[1:10:51] have to settle that debt it doesn't just
[1:10:53] disappear that we can't pay it but
[1:10:54] somebody had to make a payment for that
[1:10:56] sin and somebody somebody and I I thank
[1:11:00] God that one day I had a big long list
[1:11:02] and I Heard a Voice tell me you don't
[1:11:03] have to pay it back but I will pay the
[1:11:06] debt for you and everything that I owed
[1:11:09] up to that point was settled I don't
[1:11:11] know how he came up with the funds but
[1:11:12] it got taken care of and the accounts
[1:11:14] been settled and the same thing for
[1:11:17] every one of us that have gone through
[1:11:18] our life and gone through our Saga
[1:11:20] there's been a tab been racking up in
[1:11:22] our life of all the things that that
[1:11:24] that the devil would like to keep track
[1:11:26] on us right he let's just say it like
[1:11:28] this the devil's got a little black book
[1:11:31] and he likes to write down everything
[1:11:33] that we do and he follows us around and
[1:11:35] say well you didn't do that right and
[1:11:36] you didn't do that right and you didn't
[1:11:38] do that right so now we can recognize
[1:11:40] what voice we're dealing with when when
[1:11:42] we're we're fighting with ourselves on
[1:11:44] the inside and we say well just a
[1:11:45] failure we can't do that we can't do
[1:11:46] that well that's the influence of the
[1:11:48] devil that's following you around saying
[1:11:50] you're not doing anything right but he's
[1:11:52] he's writing it down according to his
[1:11:54] little black book right so Jesus didn't
[1:11:57] come to the ones that didn't that had a
[1:11:59] perfect record you know the Pharisees
[1:12:01] didn't have a very long book but they
[1:12:04] were greater Sinners than those that
[1:12:06] were out fishing and the publicans and
[1:12:08] because they didn't recognize who God
[1:12:10] was when he was in front of them and so
[1:12:12] we see Jesus came and he fellowshipped
[1:12:15] among people like you and I and I I I
[1:12:18] find great confidence in this brother
[1:12:19] Terry because it's not based on my works
[1:12:21] or my ability it's not based on anything
[1:12:23] I can do for him you know it our works
[1:12:26] are what we show in gratitude towards
[1:12:28] him but that's not why we're where we're
[1:12:30] at The Works have nothing to do with
[1:12:32] where we're at if we were going to stay
[1:12:33] in works we could have stayed back in
[1:12:35] Amish or menite or we could have stayed
[1:12:37] the the monks we could go over to
[1:12:38] overseas and their Works will outshine
[1:12:41] us a million times but it's not by works
[1:12:44] it's by grace and there's got to come
[1:12:46] something in our life that overrides our
[1:12:48] own thoughts about ourselves and Grace
[1:12:51] will take the place of the debt that we
[1:12:53] owe because if it was up to us we'd have
[1:12:55] ourselves chained up cuz we know
[1:12:57] ourselves right we know what a failure
[1:13:00] we are we know we know how we can't seem
[1:13:02] to do anything right and it just we just
[1:13:03] mess everything up and we'll talk
[1:13:05] ourselves out of every Victory we've
[1:13:07] ever had but Grace takes the place of
[1:13:09] how terrible we are and puts us where
[1:13:12] Christ is so Christ not only came to
[1:13:15] them where they were but he took them
[1:13:17] from where they were to where he was and
[1:13:20] so we can enter into this uh we'll just
[1:13:22] jump into an example here where Christ
[1:13:24] was was invited to a feast of the
[1:13:26] Pharisee right and Simon the Pharisee
[1:13:28] invited Jesus to his house now many
[1:13:31] churches are inviting Jesus this morning
[1:13:33] to their to their church assembly and
[1:13:35] many many homes are opening up and many
[1:13:37] many uh uh pulpits will be opened up to
[1:13:39] invite Jesus to their assembly but they
[1:13:41] invited Jesus there not knowing the
[1:13:43] power that he had within him and they
[1:13:45] invited him to make fun of him they
[1:13:47] invited him there to make fun of them
[1:13:49] you ever get into a situation where you
[1:13:51] know you're walking into the into a
[1:13:53] table of your enemies and you know it
[1:13:55] but you feel like you're to go there and
[1:13:57] that's where Jesus was where he was
[1:13:59] walking into a table of his enemies uh
[1:14:01] the the the the every every scorner
[1:14:04] every mocker was there to to pick on
[1:14:07] Jesus and brother brandham takes this in
[1:14:08] the message pride in campbellville
[1:14:10] Kentucky and he begins to describe what
[1:14:12] this Feast would look like and how how
[1:14:14] this Pharisee was so rich he had
[1:14:16] everything at his access for
[1:14:17] entertainment but but but he thought it
[1:14:20] would be fun to have Jesus there to make
[1:14:22] fun of him and it would it would be fun
[1:14:24] to have Jesus there to just let him sit
[1:14:26] there unwelcomed and with dirty feet and
[1:14:29] and and and and ashamed and unano and
[1:14:31] and try to make him feel like the small
[1:14:33] man in the room and you see that's how
[1:14:35] the devil works is he tries to Puff
[1:14:37] himself up so big in our life that he
[1:14:39] tries to make Jesus the small one in the
[1:14:41] room and and make him feel unwelcomed
[1:14:44] and and and unappreciated and and
[1:14:46] unwashed and I don't know about you this
[1:14:48] morning church but I'm not going to let
[1:14:49] Jesus sit there unwashed and in the
[1:14:52] corner somewhere with dirty feet but I
[1:14:54] came to the House of God this morning to
[1:14:56] wash the feet of Jesus because I
[1:14:59] recognize why I'm here and there was one
[1:15:01] there let's just put ourselves in that
[1:15:03] type of that woman where she recognized
[1:15:06] why she was there and she walked through
[1:15:08] the Hall of critics knowing she was
[1:15:10] going to be criticized knowing she was
[1:15:13] going to be attacked knowing what she
[1:15:14] was opening herself up into but within
[1:15:17] here there was a there was a calling
[1:15:19] coming out to say I've got to get to
[1:15:21] Jesus I've got to get to Jesus and no
[1:15:24] matter what the critics were saying
[1:15:26] about her and she was walking down you
[1:15:27] can just imagine brother Matt she walks
[1:15:29] in this room and and everybody knows her
[1:15:32] everybody knows it'd be like your life
[1:15:34] on display and everybody knowing every
[1:15:36] sin that you committed and every every
[1:15:38] deal that you did and she's walking
[1:15:39] through hearing all of these demonic
[1:15:41] influences attacking her you're unworthy
[1:15:44] what are you doing here you should leave
[1:15:46] why sh why are you here you shouldn't
[1:15:47] even come to church today you should
[1:15:49] turn around and go home what are you
[1:15:51] doing there you don't God doesn't hear
[1:15:52] your praise God doesn't hear your amen
[1:15:55] you see how the critics work and it just
[1:15:56] attacks our mind and our attacks and
[1:15:59] attacks and attacks so you're not alone
[1:16:00] in that but he does that to everybody
[1:16:03] are we okay this morning and he he his
[1:16:07] job is to criticize us so I think as a
[1:16:10] Church of God we should move beyond the
[1:16:11] critics because the critics are always
[1:16:13] going to criticize the critic is going
[1:16:15] to do what he does best and that's
[1:16:17] critic everything we do every move we
[1:16:19] make and you know what I'm kind of on
[1:16:21] the side where brother bam said that I'd
[1:16:23] rather be doing something for the Lord
[1:16:25] and make a mistake then not do anything
[1:16:27] at all and if we have to get a bigger
[1:16:29] eraser let's get a bigger eraser but an
[1:16:31] eraser is humility a eraser is something
[1:16:34] that we can come down and say you know
[1:16:35] what I messed up there but I'm not
[1:16:37] giving up I'm going to get back up and
[1:16:39] I'm going to do it again because God had
[1:16:41] given grace to the church he knows we're
[1:16:44] imperfect he knows we don't do
[1:16:45] everything right he knows that it's not
[1:16:47] by our ability but he wants to see a
[1:16:49] bride in action taking him at his word
[1:16:52] and moving into the plan of God so let
[1:16:54] me say you're going to make mistakes
[1:16:56] you're going to make the wrong call
[1:16:58] sometimes you're going to handle
[1:16:59] something the wrong way but don't give
[1:17:01] up get back up and use your eraser and
[1:17:03] say you know what Lord I'm sorry I'm
[1:17:05] sorry I did this wrong I'm sorry I'm
[1:17:07] just forgive like brother B would say
[1:17:09] forgive your stupid servant but get your
[1:17:12] eraser and then get back up because
[1:17:14] mistakes will
[1:17:16] happen you'll handle something wrong
[1:17:19] we're human beings if if we could handle
[1:17:21] everything right we wouldn't have need a
[1:17:23] Plan of Redemption to come but the fact
[1:17:25] that we're in time proves that we do
[1:17:27] need Redemption and we do need somebody
[1:17:29] greater than us and he's not expecting
[1:17:31] us to be perfect you know you can search
[1:17:33] this through the message you will never
[1:17:34] find brother brandham says the term
[1:17:36] sinless Perfection because it's not
[1:17:38] there brother brandham doesn't teach it
[1:17:40] like that he doesn't show adoption like
[1:17:42] that it's not about our works it's not
[1:17:44] about how good we can live it's about
[1:17:46] accepting the grace of God in our life
[1:17:48] that it overrides our own will our own
[1:17:51] ability Our Own Strength our our our
[1:17:53] strength is made weak in his presence
[1:17:56] right because we want his strength we
[1:17:57] want our our weakest moment to be our
[1:18:00] strongest one in his presence and what
[1:18:02] would be the point of that if we could
[1:18:03] do it
[1:18:05] ourselves but we
[1:18:07] can't so God's trying to show us
[1:18:09] something it's by his grace it's by him
[1:18:13] and him alone so something would have to
[1:18:15] be greater than what the critics were
[1:18:17] saying and this woman there she she
[1:18:19] didn't she didn't just sparingly we know
[1:18:21] the story so well she didn't just
[1:18:22] sparingly go out and buy the cheapest
[1:18:24] oil at Dollar General no she could buy
[1:18:27] but she knew the importance of the man
[1:18:29] that was sitting there so when we come
[1:18:30] to the house of God it's not just about
[1:18:32] how good we can sing or who's songling
[1:18:34] or who's preaching or who's who's
[1:18:36] playing the piano today or what are we
[1:18:38] going to eat for lunch after service or
[1:18:39] who's there or who's not there but
[1:18:41] recognize why you're coming to this
[1:18:43] place is not to not to so much shake
[1:18:45] hands with one another but there's
[1:18:47] another being in the room that is
[1:18:49] greater than anything we could ever
[1:18:51] achieve in this life if we could
[1:18:53] recognize that every time we come into
[1:18:55] His presence to say what can I do for
[1:18:57] you Lord how can I serve you how can I
[1:19:00] worship you better how can I wash your
[1:19:02] feet and not so much what he can do for
[1:19:04] you but what can you do for him because
[1:19:07] we know he's able to do whatever we have
[1:19:09] need of we know that he's the able one
[1:19:11] we know that he can come and change the
[1:19:13] situation we know that whatever Darkness
[1:19:15] we're facing one thing we know that God
[1:19:18] can change the situation now our
[1:19:20] question to him is what can I do for you
[1:19:22] how can I worship you how can I wash
[1:19:25] your feet how can I anoint you how can I
[1:19:27] give you reverence how can I give you
[1:19:29] praise how can I do better than I did
[1:19:31] yesterday to serve you in a greater
[1:19:33] portion that's our desire as a Christian
[1:19:36] Church not to not to just you know I
[1:19:38] think sometimes we look for the power of
[1:19:40] God to to to magnify our own individual
[1:19:43] testimonies and that's not what God's
[1:19:44] after he's not over Great Men he's not
[1:19:47] after uplifting men God will never share
[1:19:49] his glory with any Ministry with any man
[1:19:51] with any woman with any sister but yet
[1:19:53] God uses hands to deliver his his
[1:19:56] healing and to deliver his portion and
[1:19:58] to deliver his anointing he uses hands
[1:20:01] but he cares not for the hands he's just
[1:20:03] looking for Willing servants brother
[1:20:04] bandam himself the greatest servant in
[1:20:06] this age would say the greatest gift I
[1:20:08] have is
[1:20:10] surrender to get out of the way and let
[1:20:13] God be God in Me and I find that we
[1:20:16] would be a lot further on in our in our
[1:20:18] happiness a lot further on in our joy if
[1:20:20] we just let God be God in us if God
[1:20:23] wants to use you to sing let him use you
[1:20:25] if God wants to use you to shout let him
[1:20:27] use you if God is in your hand raised
[1:20:29] let him let him be in your hand raised
[1:20:30] if God's in your working in your cooking
[1:20:33] and your delivering and you're singing
[1:20:34] and whatever it is let it be used by God
[1:20:37] and let God handle the rest and don't
[1:20:39] search after the gifts let let God use
[1:20:41] you how he wants to use you God will use
[1:20:44] gifts God will use singing God will use
[1:20:46] preaching God will use laying on of
[1:20:48] hands but let God be God don't try to
[1:20:50] force God to do something because then
[1:20:52] we're making it about ourselves and not
[1:20:54] about God but we've got to relax and let
[1:20:57] God be God in the church right we come
[1:21:00] to the church with anticipation and and
[1:21:02] and and it creates a pressure on us if
[1:21:04] we're not careful that there's so much
[1:21:06] anticipation to get this right and get
[1:21:08] well I'm speaking to the right group
[1:21:09] this morning you guys just put on a
[1:21:11] church hosting a thousand a thousand
[1:21:13] people for what six Services it was and
[1:21:15] there's pressure that comes with that
[1:21:17] there's a pressure around that to we
[1:21:19] there's so much anticipation and and
[1:21:21] even something that's unspoken that you
[1:21:23] know you just feel this Force on there
[1:21:25] but let God be God because you're going
[1:21:27] to make mistakes Judah you're going to
[1:21:28] make mistakes sometimes the microphone's
[1:21:30] going to go but you don't quit you just
[1:21:33] fix it and you move on and next year you
[1:21:35] learn again and you don't quit but you
[1:21:37] get back up and use your eraser and you
[1:21:38] get back up and keep going that's what
[1:21:41] God wants is servants who are willing to
[1:21:43] get knocked down and get back up because
[1:21:45] by his strength we're made perfect we're
[1:21:48] not quitters we're not Giver ERS we're
[1:21:50] not going to turn around we've come way
[1:21:52] too far in our journey to turn around
[1:21:54] now but we're marching on with Christ
[1:21:56] why would we give up now when we've come
[1:21:58] so far why would we turn around now when
[1:22:00] we can look back at all of the mountains
[1:22:02] that he's brought us through why would
[1:22:04] we turn around now when we see it's just
[1:22:06] a couple more turns of the road and I
[1:22:09] believe we're going to overcome this
[1:22:10] thing let's not look back to where to to
[1:22:13] to everything that we could say well
[1:22:15] well we we messed up there we messed up
[1:22:17] there we messed up there we messed up
[1:22:18] there God knows that he knows we messed
[1:22:21] up brother will he knows our inabilities
[1:22:24] but his Grace is greater than our mess
[1:22:26] ups his grace is greater than everything
[1:22:29] that we could do in this life so this
[1:22:31] woman realizes this is she's walking to
[1:22:33] Jesus's feet and and and she's she's in
[1:22:36] herself having this inner Battle of all
[1:22:39] of my critics they know everything about
[1:22:41] me and there they are they don't even
[1:22:43] recognize the presence of Jesus in the
[1:22:47] room then this woman walks in and oh
[1:22:50] this will be a good show if he's a
[1:22:53] prophet if he's a real man of
[1:22:56] God you know and his disciples were
[1:22:58] fighting him at the same
[1:23:00] time they he just preached against
[1:23:02] Pharisees he just had preached against
[1:23:05] dealing with these religious spirits and
[1:23:07] and and in high places and yeah he then
[1:23:09] he gets invited to this feast and he
[1:23:11] says I'll go and I can imagine Peter
[1:23:13] saying what do you mean you're going to
[1:23:14] go you just told us that that's the
[1:23:16] wrong thing to do he says but there's
[1:23:19] one
[1:23:21] there he doesn't go anywhere unless
[1:23:24] first his father shows him to go and he
[1:23:27] must have had a vision that he'd be
[1:23:28] sitting at that Feast of the Pharisee
[1:23:31] but there'd be one Soul there and he
[1:23:33] went anyway and his disciples Josiah
[1:23:35] were telling him don't go it's a trap
[1:23:37] don't go they're they're going to
[1:23:38] ridicule you they're going to mock you
[1:23:40] they're not going to wash your feet
[1:23:41] they're going to embarrass you it's you
[1:23:43] preached against this and now you're
[1:23:45] going to go and have fellowship with him
[1:23:46] but he doesn't go anywhere unless first
[1:23:49] his father shows him and he went on a
[1:23:52] mission there to find one and that's how
[1:23:53] great my God is is he'll he'll forsake
[1:23:56] his reputation he'll forsake all of his
[1:23:58] his Earthly critics he'll do anything to
[1:24:00] go get to that one because that's all he
[1:24:03] cares about because you know why in just
[1:24:05] a few years all those critics were dead
[1:24:07] but that little woman there had eternal
[1:24:09] life and all those critics will cease to
[1:24:11] exist one day but that little woman
[1:24:13] there will always have life because he
[1:24:16] was able to forsake what they thought
[1:24:18] about him to come to that one and so she
[1:24:22] finds herself pouring her pour bring her
[1:24:24] anointing oil and I love how brother bam
[1:24:26] says this he says she she thought all
[1:24:28] she had to bring was that oil and she
[1:24:30] spent her life savings on it and she
[1:24:32] thought that's all she had to give but
[1:24:34] yet brother BR said there was more she
[1:24:36] could give because she furnished the
[1:24:37] water and the
[1:24:39] towels and as her glory began to fall
[1:24:42] upon his feet and she began to wash him
[1:24:44] and I wonder how many times as
[1:24:45] Christians we forget why we're here
[1:24:48] we're not here to look good or
[1:24:49] prestigious or better than anybody else
[1:24:51] but let's let our Glory fall and wash
[1:24:54] his feet and let him be the master in
[1:24:56] the room it's not about how great we are
[1:24:58] or how big we are but let God be God and
[1:25:00] recognize who's in the room that's right
[1:25:03] she began to worship and wash his feet
[1:25:06] and began to cry out and you know and
[1:25:08] and and and and the devil's right there
[1:25:10] behind
[1:25:11] her with this big list I mean if it was
[1:25:14] a list it probably would have been a
[1:25:16] scroll going down the road this sin this
[1:25:19] sin this sin this
[1:25:21] sin and there she is washing his feet
[1:25:24] amen what about this what about this
[1:25:27] what about this you ever feel that you
[1:25:31] ever feel that when you Worship the Lord
[1:25:32] and you feel what about this what about
[1:25:35] that where's that coming from it's not
[1:25:38] coming from God but there's another
[1:25:40] voice speaking to us and this devil was
[1:25:43] tempting her and tempting her and giving
[1:25:44] her every every reason to just walk out
[1:25:47] and say you know what today wasn't the
[1:25:48] day I tried but I'm going to go ahead
[1:25:50] and walk out imagine if that woman would
[1:25:52] have turned around and walked out in the
[1:25:53] middle of that worship she would have
[1:25:55] never heard the words that would set her
[1:25:57] free from that bondage but there was
[1:25:59] something greater that was there than
[1:26:01] all of those cuz by the Jewish custom
[1:26:03] she would have been stoned right there
[1:26:05] was more on her there was enough
[1:26:07] ammunition there to Stone her where she
[1:26:09] would never live another day and it was
[1:26:11] all true that's the thing about it is it
[1:26:13] was all true and they had her they had
[1:26:16] her pinned to the wall and they they
[1:26:17] were getting ready to Stone her but
[1:26:19] there was a voice that cried out greater
[1:26:21] than the laws now who wrote those laws
[1:26:25] where did the where did the Jews get
[1:26:26] those laws so who wrote the Ten
[1:26:29] Commandments well God did right it was
[1:26:31] the Finger of God that wrote The
[1:26:33] Commandments and handed them to Moses on
[1:26:35] the tablets so those are God's morals
[1:26:37] right those were something that he wrote
[1:26:39] down but but yet when the children of
[1:26:41] Israel the very same the very same
[1:26:43] moment were defying those laws and God
[1:26:46] was going to wipe them out and said get
[1:26:47] out of the way Moses I'm going to
[1:26:48] destroy him and Moses said no
[1:26:51] Lord yeah but your grace
[1:26:56] well wait a minute he just wrote those
[1:26:58] laws what's greater than the law of God
[1:27:01] there's got to be something greater than
[1:27:02] the law there's something greater than
[1:27:05] just what God just wrote that down fresh
[1:27:07] but yet in the same moment something
[1:27:10] interrupted that that said it was
[1:27:11] greater than the law of God and it was
[1:27:14] Grace Sovereign Grace moved in and it
[1:27:16] was greater in the mind of God than even
[1:27:19] his own law right cuz that woman would
[1:27:22] have been stoned but yet Jesus is
[1:27:23] sitting there and knows the law he knows
[1:27:25] the Scrolls he he knew what his father
[1:27:27] had wrote about it he knew what they
[1:27:28] were preaching in the synagogues and yet
[1:27:30] he told her the greatest words that a
[1:27:32] human being could ever hear thy sins
[1:27:35] which are many are all forgiven are all
[1:27:39] washed away and I church that would be
[1:27:41] the greatest thing I could ever hear and
[1:27:43] if we're searching for a word from the
[1:27:44] Lord there's not a greater word from the
[1:27:46] Lord than that thy sins which are many
[1:27:49] are all forgiven are all washed away thy
[1:27:52] unbelief which is much is all washed
[1:27:55] away because there's no greater voice
[1:27:57] than the voice of Jesus crying grace to
[1:27:59] the church because he has the authority
[1:28:02] over the law and with the law would have
[1:28:04] us bound Grace came in and took its
[1:28:07] place and said thy sins are forgiven thy
[1:28:11] mistakes are forgiven thy iniquities are
[1:28:14] forgiven Thy Thy Thy unbelief is
[1:28:16] Forgiven All Is Forgiven when he comes
[1:28:19] and speaks over your
[1:28:21] issue that's the word from the Lord
[1:28:23] we're looking for for and it doesn't
[1:28:25] come from just an individual or just
[1:28:27] some preacher with a microphone don't
[1:28:28] take it from me but the voice of Grace
[1:28:31] has cried in this
[1:28:32] age and it's cried greater than the
[1:28:35] law something
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:42] greater greater than the law has come in
[1:28:44] and I thank God because if it were up to
[1:28:46] us we would all be bound by the law and
[1:28:49] tell me who in here could keep every
[1:28:51] Everything of the law who in here is
[1:28:54] perfect Church order every time go
[1:28:56] through the Cod book can you keep it in
[1:28:58] perfect time every time is your life
[1:29:01] worthy of the Gospel you listen to that
[1:29:02] message and you realize you're not as
[1:29:03] good a Christian as you thought you were
[1:29:05] what is it it's you can't fulfill the
[1:29:08] law you cannot in your this flesh and
[1:29:11] this Fallen nature fulfill the law but
[1:29:14] Grace has come into an age to take the
[1:29:16] place of that Grace has come in
[1:29:19] Hallelujah 1 John 3 would say behold
[1:29:21] what manner of love the father hath
[1:29:24] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:29:26] called the sons of God am what a
[1:29:30] statement what manner of love is this
[1:29:35] amen that's right therefore the world
[1:29:38] knoweth us not because it knew him not
[1:29:42] am what manner of love is
[1:29:45] this I think about this what manner of
[1:29:48] love with a man that had no no ties or
[1:29:51] no relationship naturally to that woman
[1:29:54] a prostitute woman that she should have
[1:29:56] been
[1:29:56] stoned but yet he spoke over her that
[1:30:01] money you owed him you don't owe him
[1:30:04] anymore where did it
[1:30:07] go amen where did that long list of sin
[1:30:11] go amen I had to go somewhere amen
[1:30:15] yes there was a man sometime in the
[1:30:18] 1940s his name was Daniel Curry preacher
[1:30:21] right you know the story and he had a
[1:30:24] dream that he was a good man kept his
[1:30:25] life right kept everything up and the up
[1:30:27] and up the paperwork looked good and he
[1:30:29] had a dream that he died and went to
[1:30:31] heaven and there he comes in his in his
[1:30:34] version of this of this Heaven he's
[1:30:36] walking up to the white pearly gates and
[1:30:38] and there's there's Peter St Peter at
[1:30:40] the gate and he walks up there you know
[1:30:42] he's thinking my life's right you know
[1:30:43] I'm ready for this I I've been waiting
[1:30:45] for this I preached your law I preached
[1:30:47] it I I've I've held to the word and he
[1:30:50] gets up to the gate and there the the
[1:30:52] saint at the gate is says now what's

[1:30:59] Curry
[1:31:00] no no I don't have that name amen goad
[1:31:05] uh D
[1:31:07] Curry no no I don't see that name I've
[1:31:11] actually only got one name on this
[1:31:13] list and it's not Daniel
[1:31:15] Curry are you sure yeah yeah no you're
[1:31:18] going to have to be sent to the Judgment
[1:31:21] next and he goes on his way and I know
[1:31:23] it's it's little little Christians it's
[1:31:25] the greatest fear in the world is the
[1:31:26] white Throne judgment and it's the
[1:31:28] greatest fear that some people ever face
[1:31:29] but I thank God that I'm not going there
[1:31:32] I thank God that I'm not going to a
[1:31:33] judgment where he's going to have to
[1:31:35] look over everything I've done but the
[1:31:36] bride's being judged right now by the
[1:31:39] power of the Holy
[1:31:40] Ghost and so he goes to this judgment
[1:31:42] and there's the great judge there and
[1:31:44] he's looking through the list he says
[1:31:46] you know Daniel Curry did you did you
[1:31:48] ever did you ever
[1:31:52] lie well yeah
[1:31:54] I guess I
[1:31:57] have did you ever covet your neighbor
[1:32:01] possessions yeah yeah I guess I have you
[1:32:05] can just see he began to recognize his
[1:32:08] insufficiency sure did you ever do
[1:32:11] anybody bad in a business deal did you
[1:32:13] ever steal
[1:32:14] candy
[1:32:16] yeah yeah I
[1:32:18] have you ever you ever looked upon
[1:32:20] something that wasn't yours and coveted
[1:32:22] it yeah yeah I guess I
[1:32:25] have and he began to have that moment
[1:32:28] there that's the wrong time to have that
[1:32:33] moment I'm
[1:32:35] insufficient amen I'm not going to make
[1:32:37] it by my works and my abilities and my
[1:32:39] strength and all of a sudden he wasn't
[1:32:41] Reverend Daniel Curry anymore he was
[1:32:42] just a he was just a a little man
[1:32:45] begging for the mercy of God and he
[1:32:47] began to cry out I I just kind of put
[1:32:49] myself there in his shoes and you can
[1:32:51] just see him there he's I spent my whole
[1:32:53] life serving you I I preached your word
[1:32:55] but yet in this presence I recognized it
[1:32:57] was all just my works it was all just
[1:33:00] something I was trying to do it was
[1:33:02] something I was trying to be strong
[1:33:03] enough to overcome and I was trying to
[1:33:05] be you know and it was all I I I I right
[1:33:09] and in that presence that Sovereign
[1:33:11] Grace Just sweeps in and he begins to
[1:33:13] recognize all of his inabilities and
[1:33:15] begins to cry out Lord Lord is there any
[1:33:18] way and the judge says by the by the
[1:33:20] power of the law I've got no I've got no
[1:33:22] other choice but to send s you to a
[1:33:24] grave of hell and as he began to lift
[1:33:26] the gavel he said in the dream a voice
[1:33:29] rang out in that dream and it was
[1:33:30] sweeter than any mother's voice he'd
[1:33:32] never heard and he said wait on Earth
[1:33:36] Daniel Curry stood for me and now I'll
[1:33:39] stand for him and he began to Rejoice
[1:33:41] within himself and he turned to look and
[1:33:43] it was the face of Jesus Christ
[1:33:45] something greater than the law that the
[1:33:48] judge was about to ring Cried Out across
[1:33:50] his life and said there's still Grace
[1:33:53] for you I thank God this morning church
[1:33:55] there's still Grace for us there's still
[1:33:58] a mercy seat he's still he's still
[1:34:01] interceding on our behalf before the
[1:34:03] father we're not in this uh it's not
[1:34:06] it's not a failure that's right but
[1:34:08] there's Mercy for us there's Grace for
[1:34:10] us there's there's a way out for us he's
[1:34:14] made a way for us in that voice sweeter
[1:34:16] than any mother's voice oh Church we're
[1:34:19] not preaching disgrace I I hope you
[1:34:22] understand where I'm at yes amen amen
[1:34:25] but to think that something greater than
[1:34:27] your own sins and
[1:34:29] inabilities to cry out that he wrote the
[1:34:31] law he was the one wearing the wig and
[1:34:34] he was about to send the Judgment but it
[1:34:36] depends on what side you're on
[1:34:40] right and in our day I could say it like
[1:34:43] this Elijah fulfilled a twofold
[1:34:45] purpose Elijah came to judge the Earth
[1:34:49] but Elijah also came as zerubabel and
[1:34:52] zerubbabel's message to the church was
[1:34:54] Grace Grace Grace Grace so which side of
[1:34:57] it are you on are you on the side of
[1:34:59] judgment or the side of Grace I don't
[1:35:01] know about you friends but I want to be
[1:35:03] on the side of Grace because I know if
[1:35:05] it was up to me I would fail with the
[1:35:07] law if I was on the law side of it I
[1:35:10] would be cast down forsaken thrown into
[1:35:12] a fiery furnace there's no way I can
[1:35:14] uplift that but on the grace side I can
[1:35:17] say thank you Lord for your grace in my
[1:35:20] life thank you for your provision thank
[1:35:22] you for your mercy thank you for your
[1:35:24] goodness because you made a way when
[1:35:26] there was no way oh my brother Ram says
[1:35:29] now the great chain of perfection was
[1:35:31] broken by time and space and time came
[1:35:34] because of sin let's draw this picture
[1:35:36] of time let's see this perfect circle
[1:35:39] then all at once the sin dropped in and
[1:35:41] and and and the wife calls it like a
[1:35:42] little hickey and so eternity comes on
[1:35:44] into but it's not in its perfect
[1:35:47] condition there's a little Gap that
[1:35:49] comes down and breaks over this way and
[1:35:51] goes out this way and God had to do do
[1:35:53] that because Satan caused
[1:35:57] it so you didn't cause it Satan caused
[1:36:01] it and it Dro down to a space of time
[1:36:03] for the trying and the perfecting and
[1:36:06] for the purging of the
[1:36:08] lost that God by his Sovereign Grace
[1:36:12] somebody say grace gra might someday
[1:36:15] lift that little hicke or Gap back into
[1:36:17] the perfect circle and then she rolls on
[1:36:20] just the same time now this time is the
[1:36:22] little loopit Loop down and Jesus was
[1:36:25] from eternity to Eternity but he stepped
[1:36:27] into the time space and was made flesh
[1:36:30] and come through here in order to
[1:36:32] sanctify or put a streak of blood across
[1:36:35] all this place to redeem it and connect
[1:36:37] it back with God again for all
[1:36:41] eternity he says that's all time is
[1:36:45] brother Terry what a statement that's
[1:36:48] all time is the greatest enemy that the
[1:36:52] Earth has ever known
[1:36:54] was put here so that we could have a
[1:36:56] pathway back to
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:02] God where did Daniel Curry's sins
[1:37:06] go about it he just read him
[1:37:09] off this this this this this but yet a
[1:37:11] voice cried out and said no put it on my
[1:37:15] account put it on my charge not put it
[1:37:17] under my name put it there on that name
[1:37:19] on that list put it on that name you
[1:37:22] ever been eating somewhere at a
[1:37:23] restaurant and you go to pay your bill
[1:37:25] find out it's already been paid Lord
[1:37:28] what do you mean it's already been paid
[1:37:30] there over the weekend I was getting I
[1:37:32] was getting coffee and brother Sean just
[1:37:33] happened to be in front of me and I get
[1:37:34] up to the window and they said it's
[1:37:36] already been paid I said Praise
[1:37:39] Jesus it's already been paid now what
[1:37:42] about your list of sins when you go and
[1:37:45] you think in in the dread of having to
[1:37:47] pay for that list and the dread of
[1:37:49] knowing what you've done in your life
[1:37:51] but yet knowing it's already been paid
[1:37:53] four oh Hallelujah now the right nature
[1:37:56] you know brother Sean says well I'm
[1:37:58] going to buy you coffee and I ordered 10
[1:37:59] coffees well that would be
[1:38:02] disgrace right you think well he's
[1:38:04] paying for it
[1:38:06] anyway I didn't do that but well I
[1:38:08] probably did order 10 coffees but it
[1:38:09] wasn't for
[1:38:10] me but you see we're not preaching
[1:38:12] disgrace where you think oh it's been
[1:38:14] paid for I'm going to go live out and
[1:38:15] live any way I want to and live but it's
[1:38:17] all about our love relationship with the
[1:38:19] Lord and when you actually love somebody
[1:38:21] you would do anything but hurt them you
[1:38:24] would do anything above all you would
[1:38:26] you would you would die out to yourself
[1:38:28] a million times rather than hurt
[1:38:29] somebody you really love but yet how
[1:38:31] many times have we failed to do that but
[1:38:33] Our intention was to to live right Our
[1:38:36] intention was to be right Our intention
[1:38:38] was to serve God the right way but when
[1:38:41] we can't do it Grace comes in right when
[1:38:44] we can't fulfill it all the way Grace
[1:38:46] comes in and I thank God that there's a
[1:38:48] portion of Grace there I thank God that
[1:38:51] we can put our name there surely he ha
[1:38:53] borne my
[1:38:56] griefs where' they
[1:38:59] go amen something had to be heavy
[1:39:03] enough to take him all the way down to
[1:39:06] the lowest parts of the earth and as
[1:39:09] he's walking the Earth and he's
[1:39:10] fellowshipping with people and he's you
[1:39:12] know he's taking friendships on and he's
[1:39:14] you know he's meeting one another and
[1:39:15] he's carrying on the everything that's
[1:39:17] on their tab is coming to him it was
[1:39:20] like he was walking around the
[1:39:21] restaurant grabbing tickets that's right
[1:39:23] yeah amen hey I'll take that tab hey
[1:39:27] give me that put it in his pocket where'
[1:39:29] they go but somebody would have to pay
[1:39:32] for that somebody would have to pay for
[1:39:34] that that that debt that was owed right
[1:39:38] so we know that we know the for the sake
[1:39:40] of time you know the the scene of
[1:39:41] Calvary and and he's walking down the
[1:39:44] road to to to galtha and and there
[1:39:47] brother brandom kind of types it like
[1:39:49] that cross knocking on those
[1:39:51] cobblestones
[1:39:54] amen they say the cross piece on that
[1:39:56] cross weighed 300 lb here's a man 140
[1:40:04] lb what was so
[1:40:07] heavy well this one and that one and
[1:40:09] this one and that one he's walking down
[1:40:11] the road and he's looking at this face
[1:40:12] and that face and this sin and that
[1:40:15] burden but not just that but they put
[1:40:17] him up up on the
[1:40:19] cross and in agony he's there crying out
[1:40:22] and you could go read psalms 22 when you
[1:40:23] have time and enter into the suffering
[1:40:25] of
[1:40:28] Jesus my bones they stare at
[1:40:31] me my tongue it Cleaves to my
[1:40:33] mouth I can I can count my bones my
[1:40:37] flesh is torn from
[1:40:39] me my God my God Amen what was so
[1:40:46] heavy well it was just the sins of those
[1:40:48] people no it was the sins of the world
[1:40:53] brother bham goes into a little
[1:40:54] restaurant one time and there's a woman
[1:40:56] with with blue hair carrying on and and
[1:40:59] being unrighteous with other men and he
[1:41:01] he begins to rebuke them in his Spirit
[1:41:03] thinking oh this is just trash of
[1:41:05] humanity even a
[1:41:07] prophet misjudging his
[1:41:10] situation but God corrected him thank
[1:41:12] God that he was man enough to tell us
[1:41:15] because this story means a lot to us and
[1:41:18] there he goes off in the corner and and
[1:41:20] and and God drops him into a vision and
[1:41:22] there he's caught up and he sees the
[1:41:23] Earth is with this fog over it and
[1:41:26] there's these black Shadows coming out
[1:41:28] of it and and and there are these great
[1:41:30] sins are crying out and there's Jesus on
[1:41:32] the cross over the Earth and there he is
[1:41:34] on the cross reaching out and grabbing
[1:41:35] those shadows and taking them into
[1:41:37] himself and and the prophet thinking
[1:41:39] well is that just is that the sins of
[1:41:41] the world and the voice tells him no
[1:41:43] that's just your sins oh God oh God help
[1:41:47] me to think that a man like William
[1:41:49] brandham that is so Vindicated time and
[1:41:51] time again to be kept from drinking kept
[1:41:53] from smoking kept from carrying on with
[1:41:55] women kept from all these things and yet
[1:41:57] his sin was even reaching out where
[1:41:59] Jesus would have to grab it and take it
[1:42:01] in where does that put us the regular
[1:42:03] person walking on the earth and in
[1:42:05] himself he began to feel the the the
[1:42:07] humbleness of the spirit and say oh God
[1:42:09] I'm sorry and he said now you're judging
[1:42:11] that woman and look at the sins that
[1:42:14] you've committed he said God forgive me
[1:42:16] God let me have Grace and there he went
[1:42:18] back to that woman and led her to the
[1:42:20] Lord there by the spirit of Grace that
[1:42:22] came in the room and where he once would
[1:42:24] have just thrown her out as the trash of
[1:42:26] humanity but yet he came back because
[1:42:28] God showed him I go nothing and nowhere
[1:42:31] until first my father shows me and by a
[1:42:34] vision she was led to the Lord that
[1:42:36] there was still Grace for her and so
[1:42:39] while they were there 2,000 years ago
[1:42:41] and there was a man on a cross he didn't
[1:42:43] move his hands were pinned his feet was
[1:42:45] pinned but yet in another dimension he
[1:42:48] was moving grabbing the sins of today
[1:42:50] that was in 1950 something here we are
[1:42:52] and
[1:42:53] 2024 and yet even now the sins of today
[1:42:56] he's reaching out and he's reaching out
[1:42:59] for that sin and taking it into himself
[1:43:01] to absorb what we could not do he is
[1:43:04] paying the price for that there's their
[1:43:06] tab let me take it into myself there's
[1:43:09] their debt let me take it into myself
[1:43:11] and he begins to move on our behalf even
[1:43:13] now this morning and even on our way to
[1:43:16] church and the thoughts that we've had
[1:43:17] yesterday but there's going to come a
[1:43:19] time when the last bride member will sin
[1:43:22] for the last last time I believe we're
[1:43:24] very near the time when the last sin
[1:43:27] will be committed and he'll reach out in
[1:43:30] another realm and here we are in this
[1:43:32] little hickey of time and there he is
[1:43:34] right now sitting on the cross reaching
[1:43:37] out and grabbing that sin and he's going
[1:43:38] to say it's
[1:43:40] finished it's finished the Redemption
[1:43:43] cycle is finished I've done it I
[1:43:46] fulfilled it I I've took on the sin of
[1:43:49] man and I've took it unto myself and he
[1:43:52] descended down to the lowest parts of
[1:43:54] the
[1:43:54] earth why that is when the work began
[1:43:59] and he goes up to the devil's house and
[1:44:01] you can imagine all the demons in hell
[1:44:03] and there's anxiety in the corner
[1:44:05] trembling he's here and there's
[1:44:07] depression over there he's here and
[1:44:09] there's cancer he's here and he's
[1:44:11] walking down the halls of Hell going
[1:44:13] straight to the to the one who holds the
[1:44:15] keys and he's saying this weight that I
[1:44:18] bore took me all the way down here but
[1:44:21] I'm not staying here
[1:44:23] I'm not going to stay here and there he
[1:44:26] takes the takes to the door of Satan and
[1:44:28] Satan's turning
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:32] latches and he kicks open the door of
[1:44:34] death and hell oh yeah I believe it's
[1:44:37] real I believe it's
[1:44:39] happening we think of this 2,000 years
[1:44:41] ago it's right now it's happening right
[1:44:44] now and he kicks open the door of Satan
[1:44:47] and and he has the keys there on his hip
[1:44:50] and say says wait a minute
[1:44:54] I'm
[1:44:54] old Adam fell I'm
[1:44:58] old there's a big there's a big
[1:45:02] list that's got to be
[1:45:04] paid and Jesus says turn to your list
[1:45:08] well let's turn to let's turn to Mary
[1:45:17] Magdalene this was old her I was there
[1:45:20] when it happened I wrote it down I was
[1:45:23] there let's
[1:45:25] turn let's turn to Josiah
[1:45:30] McClaren it was there I was there when
[1:45:33] it happened where did it
[1:45:36] go where did it go and right then Jesus
[1:45:40] began to raise
[1:45:42] up Hallelujah I am the sinless Son of
[1:45:46] God I have never sinned a day in my life
[1:45:49] although sin was on me it was not in me
[1:45:51] but I used it as a carrier to get down
[1:45:54] here to where you were so that I could
[1:45:56] fulfill the Plan of Redemption for
[1:45:58] mankind so that I could fulfill the Plan
[1:46:00] of Redemption for my seed after me and
[1:46:03] after Abraham that we could be restored
[1:46:06] back to Eternity and just about that
[1:46:08] time the cross was still dripping with
[1:46:10] his blood it worked its way down through
[1:46:12] the Rocks as it were and a big red drop
[1:46:15] began to drop on the on the Black Book
[1:46:17] of Satan and your name was erased and
[1:46:20] blotted out of his book Satan doesn't
[1:46:23] even know your name because the power of
[1:46:25] the blood came and erased every memory
[1:46:28] that you ever were on the book you have
[1:46:31] no entry on the book of sin because the
[1:46:33] blood of the sinless one came and erased
[1:46:36] and washed it away Satan doesn't know
[1:46:39] your name he doesn't know where you're
[1:46:41] at he doesn't know where you live why
[1:46:43] because the blood the blood made a way
[1:46:46] when there was no way he came and washed
[1:46:49] it away and Satan there looking at his
[1:46:51] red blood now just washed over his book
[1:46:54] and Jesus says now give me the
[1:46:57] keys give me those keys and ripped off
[1:47:00] the keys to your overcoming power and
[1:47:03] arose with them on his way out he
[1:47:05] knocked by a few
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:11] doors I'm here I'm
[1:47:16] here he began to preach to those Souls
[1:47:18] that were lost before why didn't you
[1:47:20] listen to Noah why didn't you listen to
[1:47:23] William brandom's message why didn't you
[1:47:25] listen to Enoch's message why didn't you
[1:47:27] listen to Elijah's message and began to
[1:47:29] preach to those that had fallen on but
[1:47:32] then he turned another
[1:47:34] door and brother B says job opens the
[1:47:38] door and throws on the door says there
[1:47:40] he is he lives I knew I'd see him in my
[1:47:43] flesh there's the one that I saw when
[1:47:45] the lightning was flashing all around me
[1:47:47] and I thought I was just on an ashy for
[1:47:49] the rest of my life I didn't know where
[1:47:51] I was going to go what I was going to do
[1:47:53] where I was going to turn out there's so
[1:47:55] many decisions to make it but there he
[1:47:57] is there's the one where the lightning
[1:47:59] and the thunder rolling there he is he
[1:48:02] says Abraham look who it is and Abraham
[1:48:05] runs to the
[1:48:06] door it's him it's the one Sarah look
[1:48:11] who it is and brother Braham says in the
[1:48:13] mighty conqueror that Sarah looked and
[1:48:15] said it's the one that we had dinner
[1:48:17] with at the tent door it's the one that
[1:48:19] we had bread and wine with it's the one
[1:48:22] that we killed the fatted calf with it's
[1:48:24] the one I see
[1:48:28] him and Ezekiel came behind them it's
[1:48:31] the
[1:48:33] one he's the wheel in the middle of the
[1:48:36] wheel in Isaiah he had borne my griefs
[1:48:41] it's the one I saw he's here and Jesus
[1:48:44] begins to share with him all that's
[1:48:46] taking place while they were in paradise
[1:48:48] and then he pulls out the keys your
[1:48:51] rides here your ride has come your
[1:48:55] flight has come it's time to get on
[1:48:57] board we're going out of here and the
[1:48:59] Bible says that they ascended with him
[1:49:01] out of the Grave because he had power
[1:49:04] over hell in the grave and they ascended
[1:49:06] all the way up lift you up oh
[1:49:08] Everlasting Gates who is this king of
[1:49:10] glory as they ascended the ramp parts of
[1:49:13] Heaven what is it it's the keys over
[1:49:16] these Dimensions that tie us down it's
[1:49:18] been returned to the church and when he
[1:49:20] arose he gave gifts under man what were
[1:49:23] those gifts not just the spiritual gifts
[1:49:26] but gifts over death hell and the grave
[1:49:30] Hallelujah and they're yours the keys
[1:49:32] are here who made the law of the
[1:49:35] gravitation of the planets what being
[1:49:36] would be powerful enough to cause the
[1:49:38] sun in orbit and the moon and hold the
[1:49:41] Earth in Perfect Balance well God would
[1:49:44] have to do that but what gave Joshua the
[1:49:46] authority to speak to the son and say
[1:49:48] son stand still greater than the law the
[1:49:52] orbits that God had put into motion was
[1:49:55] the voice of Grace that cried out from
[1:49:57] Joshua to say son stand
[1:50:01] still and it obeyed
[1:50:04] him who made the law of gravity what is
[1:50:07] this law of gravity well God put it
[1:50:10] there right but what happened when Enoch
[1:50:14] was walking with
[1:50:15] God the
[1:50:17] lawmaker was walking with a with a
[1:50:21] son amen and that conversation got so
[1:50:24] charged in the anointing it got so
[1:50:26] uplifting in the word they got right to
[1:50:29] where we're at I be I believe that the
[1:50:30] seals were breaking under Enoch and he
[1:50:33] began to see the full Plan of Redemption
[1:50:35] in God's mind and he began to get
[1:50:37] rapturing Grace faith and that rapturing
[1:50:39] Grace Faith Came Upon him and just as
[1:50:42] they were walking down the road that
[1:50:45] Grace that was in Enoch's life became
[1:50:47] greater than the law of
[1:50:50] gravity who made the law
[1:50:53] L God did but he is the grace and when
[1:50:57] you're walking with Grace it's greater
[1:51:00] than any condemnation it's greater than
[1:51:02] any any other authority out there even
[1:51:05] his own law and you can say by the law I
[1:51:07] should be condemned and you're right but
[1:51:09] Grace has rang across the church Grace
[1:51:13] Grace Grace to the
[1:51:16] church it's Grace over our Lives why
[1:51:19] would we look to judge one another and
[1:51:21] judge this so many quotes on this but
[1:51:23] I'm just preaching this morning that's
[1:51:25] okay praise the Lord so many so many
[1:51:27] quarrels and back bitings and but how
[1:51:29] did you get here by Grace why are you
[1:51:33] where you're at today Grace I know I do
[1:51:36] not deserve to be where I'm at I do not
[1:51:39] deserve to be in a church and have a
[1:51:41] sound mind and to have a beautiful
[1:51:42] family and to have friends and loved
[1:51:44] ones I do not deserve that but Grace has
[1:51:47] intervened in my life and more than that
[1:51:49] I do not deserve a token to Eternal
[1:51:51] Kingdom I do not deserve this key that I
[1:51:54] have to rapturing Faith but I'll take it
[1:51:56] by Grace I'll claim it by Grace I'll say
[1:52:00] I'm already healed by Grace maybe you
[1:52:02] think I don't deserve to be healed and
[1:52:04] maybe you're right but Grace says
[1:52:07] otherwise well I don't deserve to have
[1:52:09] an overcoming life I'm just a failure
[1:52:10] but Grace says
[1:52:12] otherwise let Grace be the voice in your
[1:52:15] life cuz it's greater than what you
[1:52:17] would say about yourself but the blood
[1:52:19] has a voice and it's Grace
[1:52:22] grace to the church that we're not under
[1:52:24] condemnation or bondage where men have
[1:52:26] been under bondage for all of all of
[1:52:28] time cycle but the cycle breaker has
[1:52:31] come the cycle breaker has come into
[1:52:34] time and
[1:52:37] disrupted Grace he said it I read it
[1:52:42] Grace will restore us back to Eternity
[1:52:44] it's Sovereign Grace amen
[1:52:49] amen how'd the devil get down there he
[1:52:51] doesn't go any anywhere unless first the
[1:52:54] father shows
[1:52:56] him you mean that that was a vision in
[1:52:58] in his mind to go down there and take
[1:53:00] the keys how else would he have the
[1:53:02] strength to say not my will oh but thine
[1:53:05] be done he knew the Plan of Redemption
[1:53:08] was coming to fullness he knew that
[1:53:10] there would be those ones that he picked
[1:53:12] up along the way and even us here today
[1:53:14] looking on us what manner of love is
[1:53:18] this as he as he dragged that cross up
[1:53:21] that hill what manner of love is
[1:53:23] this amen a greater suffering than we
[1:53:26] could ever imagine you think about
[1:53:29] sometimes sometimes we come to church so
[1:53:31] burdened with our cares so burdened with
[1:53:34] our worries and how's this going to work
[1:53:36] out and I don't see a plan out of this
[1:53:37] and you think about that that's just you
[1:53:39] an individual well then take on this
[1:53:41] whole
[1:53:42] church and then take on every church out
[1:53:45] there and then take on the disciples he
[1:53:47] was walking with and every every age
[1:53:49] that would come between them and us
[1:53:53] right a greater suffering than we could
[1:53:55] ever
[1:53:58] imagine what manner of love was
[1:54:07] this I pr you'd preach something deeper
[1:54:09] than Calvary I don't think it gets
[1:54:10] deeper if you can't see the seven seal
[1:54:13] in this you don't understand
[1:54:15] it it's Christ in this age what is he
[1:54:19] doing what is he doing in this age he's
[1:54:22] revealing himself to the church he's
[1:54:24] revealing himself to the bride how is he
[1:54:27] doing it by Grace because you studied
[1:54:30] hard enough no brother Sean you devoted
[1:54:33] your entire life to the gospel you've
[1:54:35] you've not studied that hard to find
[1:54:37] where God would come in but by Grace
[1:54:41] every Theologian out there brother Terry
[1:54:43] your whole life been devoted to this you
[1:54:45] know you couldn't do it sorry you know
[1:54:47] you couldn't do it on your own but
[1:54:50] Grace any man who tells you I've got
[1:54:53] that I've got the revelation of
[1:54:55] this it's by
[1:54:57] Grace it's not because we studied it's
[1:54:59] not to him that willth or him that
[1:55:01] runneth it's by God that showeth Mercy
[1:55:06] my grace is sufficient for thee so tell
[1:55:09] me what sin is too great for that
[1:55:12] Grace Hallelujah
[1:55:14] hallu we've just gone through a couple
[1:55:17] of witnesses a couple of testimonies
[1:55:19] that have Mong reports on them and you
[1:55:22] tell me what sin in your life is too
[1:55:24] great for that Grace Peter denied him
[1:55:27] three
[1:55:31] times on but he said worry not
[1:55:34] Peter my grace is sufficient for thee my
[1:55:38] grace is suff we're going to stumble
[1:55:40] we're going to make mistakes we're going
[1:55:41] to fall apart we're going to get clouded
[1:55:43] Vision we're going to worry about this
[1:55:44] and worry about that but tell me what is
[1:55:47] greater than the grace of
[1:55:49] God what is greater than the mercy see
[1:55:52] he had what manner of love is this that
[1:55:54] he had bestowed upon the church he knows
[1:55:58] he knows the situation you're in he's
[1:56:00] not alarmed by it he's not shocked by it
[1:56:02] but his grace is greater than that his
[1:56:05] grace is greater than any mind battle
[1:56:07] that we will face his grace is greater
[1:56:09] than any depressive spirit that would
[1:56:11] try to take us down his grace is
[1:56:15] greater so what are we claiming the law
[1:56:17] or Grace brother bradam said you're a
[1:56:19] church this morning and you're choosing
[1:56:21] law or Grace my church in here decides
[1:56:25] I'm going to choose Grace Grace Grace
[1:56:28] Grace what the law could not do Grace
[1:56:31] has already done I could not keep it but
[1:56:34] Grace made a way for
[1:56:36] me there has to be something greater
[1:56:38] than just the works of the ages
[1:56:41] Revelations the 4th chapter after this
[1:56:43] age I looked Leo TOA Behold a door was
[1:56:46] open in heaven and the first voice which
[1:56:48] I heard whereas it was a trumpet talking
[1:56:50] with me come up hither and I will show
[1:56:53] you these things which must be Hereafter
[1:56:55] what was
[1:56:57] it it was Grace to
[1:56:59] John amen it was Grace to
[1:57:04] John what cried out it was a voice Grace
[1:57:09] come up higher John come up out of those
[1:57:12] ages come up out of that Darkness come
[1:57:14] up out of that confusion come up out of
[1:57:16] that battling come up out of that and
[1:57:18] take on Grace become Grace that's right
[1:57:22] I don't know if you know this or not
[1:57:23] brother but you're John you're John in
[1:57:25] the book you are coming up higher out of
[1:57:28] the ages into Grace and right after that
[1:57:30] is Revelations 5 right when every man
[1:57:33] wept because they knew the list that was
[1:57:35] in front of them of all of their sins
[1:57:37] and iniquities and John said I I there's
[1:57:40] no way for it to be
[1:57:42] fulfilled there's no way we can have
[1:57:44] this he said but oh a voice said to me
[1:57:49] weep not
[1:57:50] John weep not bride
[1:57:54] Hallelujah thy sins which are many weep
[1:57:57] not bride this isn't your destination
[1:58:00] but you've got another destination
[1:58:02] coming weep not about what you see here
[1:58:04] but look beyond that weep not John and
[1:58:07] he said I heard a roar come from behind
[1:58:09] me it was the Roar of Grace and he said
[1:58:12] when I turned to look as if it were a
[1:58:14] lion I saw a
[1:58:16] lamb cloning in humility clothed in
[1:58:20] humility coming to Bear the the burdens
[1:58:22] of the world but no man was found worthy
[1:58:24] to open the book but Grace came in and
[1:58:27] made a way to open the book and that
[1:58:30] same John who was who was in the darkest
[1:58:32] of Ages who came through all of those
[1:58:34] ages be before him that same John when
[1:58:37] he recognized that there was a Grace for
[1:58:40] him and where that blood had blotted out
[1:58:42] his name on The Devil's book that same
[1:58:44] blood had wrote his name in the Lamb's
[1:58:47] Book of Life and John got so beside
[1:58:49] himself he didn't care what the critics
[1:58:51] said said he didn't care what anybody
[1:58:53] else around him said he didn't care
[1:58:55] about his own unbelief he didn't care
[1:58:56] about his own doubt and unworthiness he
[1:58:59] said Glory holy holy holy is the
[1:59:04] Lamb holy is the Lamb that's right what
[1:59:08] was it it was
[1:59:10] Grace I see it it's Grace together it's
[1:59:14] come in for me it's made a way for me
[1:59:16] it's Grace Grace
[1:59:19] Grace how would I ever be there but by
[1:59:22] Grace Jesus walked with with with with
[1:59:24] John John knew what it would take to
[1:59:27] live a perfect life I can't do
[1:59:31] it but Grace
[1:59:35] amen it was
[1:59:38] Grace thank you Father Bram said when
[1:59:40] you get there if you don't see me you
[1:59:44] just listen and you'll hear me somewhere
[1:59:47] down by the stream of life in a little
[1:59:49] old cabin somewhere singing amazing
[1:59:52] Grace How Sweet the Sound is saved a
[1:59:55] wret like me you tell me a Vindicated
[1:59:58] man like William Brandon would have to
[2:00:00] sing the voice of Grace over there then
[2:00:01] you and I better be singing it as well
[2:00:03] here Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[2:00:06] the saved a wret like me how would I
[2:00:09] ever be
[2:00:10] there amen amen how would I ever get
[2:00:13] there that's right but by Grace
[2:00:18] amen How would how would you ever attain
[2:00:20] that kind of riches and Glory
[2:00:23] brother baram said you would like to
[2:00:24] write a check but you ain't got the
[2:00:25] money that's right it would take one
[2:00:28] with the money with full Authority all
[2:00:31] that Adam lost would be restored back to
[2:00:34] the church and I believe that took place
[2:00:36] in our age
[2:00:38] right in our time right to this church I
[2:00:42] can't speak for everybody else out there
[2:00:44] but I believe that this vision of the
[2:00:46] Bride of the message of the hour is
[2:00:48] rapturing Faith I believe it will
[2:00:50] Rapture the church and I don't it's
[2:00:52] going to be one day we'll be driving
[2:00:53] down the car the the road in our car and
[2:00:55] all of a sudden there's no driver there
[2:00:56] but I believe under the anointing of the
[2:00:58] message of the hour it's the only place
[2:01:00] where we can come in and get lifted up
[2:01:02] enough out of this Dark Age that we're
[2:01:04] in to rise above Le O deia to rise above
[2:01:08] the chaos of the world to rise above our
[2:01:09] own inabilities and rise up into Grace
[2:01:12] and every time he comes on the scene
[2:01:15] he's fixing to do something there at
[2:01:17] Abraham's tent when mzc came down and
[2:01:19] fellowship with him Sarah's body was
[2:01:21] changed Sarah's body got changed under
[2:01:24] that anointing every time mzed comes and
[2:01:26] there in the lower parts of paradise
[2:01:29] when that when that door knocked and
[2:01:32] there she said there he is the one at
[2:01:33] the tent door her keys were there
[2:01:36] Sarah's body got changed one more time
[2:01:38] and I believe right now in this age
[2:01:40] Sarah Sarah you better get ready you
[2:01:44] better get ready give me that picture of
[2:01:46] that cloud you better get ready mecdc
[2:01:49] has come one more time and every time
[2:01:52] elaz comes Sarah's body's fixing to get
[2:01:55] changed and I believe a voice of Grace
[2:01:58] has come out from the center of that
[2:01:59] cloud and saying grace to the church you
[2:02:02] better get ready you better lay aside
[2:02:04] every weight you better let it go you
[2:02:07] better drop it because I am coming come
[2:02:10] up higher out of it come up higher out
[2:02:13] of
[2:02:14] it grace to the church I believe Sarah's
[2:02:18] body's getting ready to change I believe
[2:02:20] we're getting ready to get sent back to
[2:02:21] our perfect picture I believe we're
[2:02:23] getting ready to send back to the
[2:02:25] eternities out of what Adam lost the
[2:02:27] keys are here a prophet messenger came
[2:02:30] in our day and was Vindicated by that
[2:02:32] the
[2:02:33] keys your rid's
[2:02:38] here it's
[2:02:40] here the keys already in the ignition
[2:02:43] the gas is in there the Dynamics
[2:02:45] mechanics all you've got to do is turn
[2:02:47] the switch all you've got to do is push
[2:02:49] the button it's ready it's liftoff time
[2:02:52] 76 5 4 3 2 1 countdown is on it's
[2:02:56] liftoff time Church Grace has come into
[2:02:58] an age it's taken over what you cannot
[2:03:01] do you've got no control of this because
[2:03:04] Grace has taken over your life what you
[2:03:06] committed to God let no man put us under
[2:03:09] because God is in control of this
[2:03:12] situation God is in control of your life
[2:03:15] you think oh I don't know how I'm going
[2:03:16] to get out of it you're not going to get
[2:03:17] out of it but Grace Will Make A Way
[2:03:20] Grace always makes a way when they were
[2:03:22] at the Red Sea and Moses said I don't
[2:03:24] know what to do I don't know what's in
[2:03:25] front of me a pillar of fire came
[2:03:28] down and Grace made a way for them to to
[2:03:31] get out of the devil's
[2:03:35] snare oh with this snare the devil's got
[2:03:38] me and is too great it's greater than
[2:03:39] God's grace really oh
[2:03:43] no but God's word is more
[2:03:47] powerful he that is in you is more
[2:03:50] greater
[2:03:57] worry not Peter oh but you don't know
[2:04:00] what I've thought you don't know this is
[2:04:03] an age we're living in friends this is a
[2:04:06] time like we have never seen no man
[2:04:09] before us what is it it's the finishing
[2:04:11] the culmination of the ages together and
[2:04:14] God is doing something that he has never
[2:04:16] done
[2:04:17] before praise the Lord I believe the
[2:04:19] third poll is in effect sir when you get
[2:04:22] time go listen to the message Look Away
[2:04:24] to Jesus and brother banam brings down
[2:04:27] the effects of the third PLL and he says
[2:04:29] that was five evidences g r a c
[2:04:35] e come on now at our church a couple
[2:04:38] months ago there's a young man lived in
[2:04:40] church his entire life 35 years old
[2:04:44] introverted doesn't talk to anybody
[2:04:45] leaves right after service comes in late
[2:04:48] I I've had two maybe two words with him
[2:04:52] but Grace made a way for him and there
[2:04:54] at the end of one service he came up for
[2:04:56] prayer I said I've never seen this
[2:04:57] brother come up for
[2:04:59] prayer brother Josiah we didn't have to
[2:05:01] touch him we didn't lay hands on him he
[2:05:04] said I need the Holy Ghost and the
[2:05:07] brother that was preaching said Do you
[2:05:08] believe it's yours yeah I believe
[2:05:10] it brother Sean I've never seen
[2:05:12] something like that happen that fast a
[2:05:14] 35-year-old Pew riding Christian hallu
[2:05:18] hallu but knowing that there was
[2:05:20] something greater for him knowing that
[2:05:22] he was just going through the motions
[2:05:24] knowing that I mean he'll testify about
[2:05:26] this his his literal skin color has
[2:05:27] changed since this
[2:05:30] event what was it it was Grace
[2:05:33] amen you think well I'm too far in this
[2:05:36] he was 35 years in that why I'm too far
[2:05:39] deep in
[2:05:42] this brother Junior you ever go out in
[2:05:44] the woods you get stuck in the mud you
[2:05:46] trying to spin your way out it just gets
[2:05:48] deeper and deeper and deeper
[2:05:52] you're thinking I'm just H I'm never
[2:05:54] going to get out of this situation and
[2:05:56] you know what getting stuck in the mud I
[2:05:57] don't know about everybody else but it
[2:05:58] gives me a sense of hopelessness what am
[2:06:00] I going to do out here I don't have
[2:06:01] phone signal I don't have a way out I
[2:06:03] don't have a wench I don't
[2:06:07] know but you're not still in the mud
[2:06:11] Junior the Lord Brother will you're not
[2:06:13] still stuck in the mud and you go back
[2:06:15] to that moment when you were down there
[2:06:17] in the trenches you think I'm never
[2:06:18] going to get out of here I'm going to be
[2:06:19] stuck here they're going to find a body
[2:06:20] laying here
[2:06:22] I'm just going to be stuck out in these
[2:06:23] Woods I remember one time in in in I had
[2:06:25] an elk hunt in Arizona and dark got on
[2:06:28] me faster than I could and you know how
[2:06:29] it is out there Josiah one range looks
[2:06:31] like the next I couldn't find my truck I
[2:06:32] was out there middle of the night
[2:06:34] wandering
[2:06:35] around and that Spirit of hopelessness
[2:06:37] comes on you that's right I'm never
[2:06:39] going to get out of
[2:06:42] here brother banon was there one
[2:06:45] time how am I going to get out of
[2:06:48] this how am I going to get out of this
[2:06:50] situation
[2:06:52] you know what he did he just put up his
[2:06:56] hands yes and the fog began to lift all
[2:07:01] of that confusion began to lift and he
[2:07:03] just put up his hands there he said he
[2:07:05] felt a Lifeline it was Grace it was
[2:07:09] Grace that would lead his hands he said
[2:07:10] I knew as soon as I made contact with
[2:07:12] that line at the other end of that line
[2:07:14] was my wife and my children and I was
[2:07:16] going home he said it was as good as
[2:07:18] done but what he had to do was override
[2:07:20] the hopelessness and lift up his hands
[2:07:22] and say Lord your grace is sufficient
[2:07:25] Lord I know you're able to fix this
[2:07:27] situation Lord I know that you're able
[2:07:28] now I don't know what everybody in here
[2:07:29] is going through but I do know that God
[2:07:31] is able I do I don't have to hear your
[2:07:33] story or how bad it is or how deep in
[2:07:36] the hole you are but I do know that God
[2:07:37] is able I do know that no matter how
