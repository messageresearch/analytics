[39:51] just keep him in our prayer
[39:53] amen and
[39:56] do all that we can for the Lord ain't
[39:58] that right
[40:00] amen amen before we go into the word may
[40:04] we just bow our heads and talk to
[40:07] her father
[40:10] precious Lord we come to you Lord just
[40:14] with grateful Hearts thankful
[40:17] for all that you have done for us
[40:20] Lord we thank you that we're in your
[40:22] hands
[40:24] and Lord that you know our future
[40:27] taking care of our past our present Lord
[40:30] and
[40:32] father the future is bright
[40:35] and I pray father that you would just
[40:37] come in the service and move by your
[40:41] spirit Lord you see every need that is
[40:43] present
[40:44] Lord and you know how to meet the need
[40:48] and I pray Lord that you just give us a
[40:50] fresh anointing
[40:52] and your word father and may you speak
[40:55] to every heart tonight
[40:57] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[41:00] amen and amen
[41:04] First Corinthians the 14th chapter
[41:09] and
[41:11] praise the Lord
[41:14] the 15th
[41:17] verse I believe it is yeah
[41:20] but it says what is it then I will pray
[41:24] with the spirit and I will pray with the
[41:27] understanding also
[41:29] I will sing with the spirit and I will
[41:32] sing
[41:33] with the understanding also amen you can
[41:38] have your seeds
[41:41] we've just been um
[41:44] um talking on on prayer
[41:47] and um it Thrills my heart to to know
[41:53] the age the time that we're living in
[41:56] and that we are the manifestation of
[42:00] God's thoughts today
[42:02] and everything that God had thought of
[42:05] we are the sons and daughters of God
[42:08] that he saw before the foundation of the
[42:11] world
[42:12] and
[42:14] to know that we are in the position
[42:17] today we if if there's ever a people
[42:20] that are in position to have fellowship
[42:24] with him
[42:26] as he desired to have in the beginning
[42:28] we are that that group of people
[42:31] this is what he's worked for this is
[42:33] what he's longed for
[42:35] God loves to have Fellowship
[42:38] and you could see why Satan does all he
[42:41] can to keep us busy keep his occupied
[42:44] with other things
[42:46] but he he loves fellowship and in his
[42:50] mind he purpose to have Fellowship
[42:53] now brother Branham gives the simple uh
[42:57] definition I guess or Bosworth uh the
[43:01] fellowship is Two Fellas of the same
[43:04] ship
[43:05] which
[43:07] is is saying basically they they share a
[43:10] mutual bond they have uh the same
[43:15] understanding it's it's a it's they have
[43:18] something in common
[43:20] and I think this is where we're at uh in
[43:24] this day as Sons and Daughters of God
[43:27] prayer is a way for us to have
[43:31] Fellowship
[43:32] uh with God
[43:35] um prayer is our acknowledgment of God
[43:38] the Bible talks about in all thy ways
[43:42] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your
[43:44] paths
[43:45] well that's that's prayer
[43:48] first Peter 5 and 7 as well it says
[43:51] casting all your care upon him for he
[43:55] careth for you
[43:56] if we could really understand the
[43:59] passion that God has the desire that God
[44:02] has for for us
[44:04] sometimes we think it's all one-sided
[44:07] that maybe we love God and we we want
[44:10] God and we want a fellowship with God
[44:12] but God knows nothing about us but
[44:14] that's not true
[44:16] God's wanted Fellowship way before we
[44:18] ever desired Fellowship
[44:20] and and as the the I believe it was the
[44:24] prophet that said he wants to hear you a
[44:26] thousand times more than you wanted
[44:29] before you could ever desire it God God
[44:33] desired it everything and and and so
[44:36] therefore casting all your care upon him
[44:39] for he cares for you
[44:41] you see when we come to Christ it's it's
[44:44] a place just to let off the pressure
[44:48] there's so much pressure in the world
[44:49] today so many things that people don't
[44:52] know what to do and where to go and how
[44:55] to handle things and uh on and on and on
[44:59] but but when you come to Christ it's
[45:02] it's a it's a time just to let off the
[45:05] pressure
[45:06] it's a time and I think this is why we
[45:08] need to pray
[45:09] but it's also as the prophet would tell
[45:12] us that it's God's provided place of
[45:15] safety
[45:16] in times of sickness and Times of of
[45:19] trouble in times of turmoil you can go
[45:23] to Christ you can come to him and just
[45:25] let off all that pressure amen because
[45:28] you know you have this understanding
[45:31] that he cares for you and so everything
[45:34] that we would have need of is in Christ
[45:38] Christ is our everything do you believe
[45:40] that Christ is our everything so when we
[45:43] come into prayer we we're having this
[45:45] understanding that Christ is is
[45:47] everything that we have need of he's our
[45:50] satisfaction he's our he's he's our
[45:53] provider he's our sustainer and and all
[45:56] these things so the prophet says that
[45:58] Christ took your worry that you wouldn't
[46:00] have to do it
[46:01] hey man that's that's right and so he
[46:04] says don't don't worry about your cares
[46:07] for that's his business ain't that right
[46:10] so if you notice we're invited to come
[46:12] boldly before the throne of grace
[46:15] amen not to complain
[46:18] not to Grumble not not to manipulate
[46:22] not nodding these things but we're
[46:25] invited to come boldly before the throne
[46:28] of grace to find help in time of need
[46:30] help he's got needs
[46:32] I think as humans we've all got needs
[46:35] and so God provided a channel God
[46:38] provided a way that we could come and to
[46:41] find the help
[46:42] now you know we can come boldly because
[46:47] of the work of redemption we must never
[46:50] take that lightly of the work of
[46:52] redemption lightly and and as the
[46:55] prophet told us the Redemption is to
[46:57] bring back to its original condition
[47:00] so then it's in this day as as the lamb
[47:05] has come he's already done the work of
[47:08] redemption but it's in this day he came
[47:10] with an open book
[47:12] and it's to claim what he is already
[47:15] redeemed
[47:17] if if you're filling a pull whatsoever
[47:20] it's it's because it's christ-lane claim
[47:23] to you
[47:24] he's bringing you unto himself
[47:27] the Bible says it was God in Christ
[47:29] reconciling the world unto himself
[47:32] and so God through this work of
[47:34] redemption it was to reconcile us back
[47:38] to have fellowship with him do you
[47:40] believe that
[47:41] so we have been brought back in the
[47:44] fellowship just as Adam had that that
[47:48] Fellowship but I believe that we have a
[47:51] greater understanding
[47:53] a greater Fellowship they uh then then
[47:57] what what Adam had and it brings us into
[48:01] a more intimate Fellowship than than
[48:04] Adam had with God Adam prayed in in the
[48:08] garden uh there and and uh you know the
[48:12] the prophet told us of how that they
[48:14] would uh him and Eve would just go and
[48:17] have fellowship with God in the cool of
[48:20] the evening and how that God desired he
[48:22] longed for that time of the day and Adam
[48:25] and Eve long for that time of day just
[48:27] to to run in in the garden and and and
[48:31] go to that certain place that they met
[48:33] with God and and have fellowship and
[48:36] communion with with the Lord and they
[48:38] they stayed in fellowship with him ain't
[48:41] that right and so man now if you if you
[48:45] don't stay in fellowship with God you'll
[48:48] dry up in your spiritual walk with the
[48:50] Lord
[48:50] a man the prophet said you you if you
[48:54] don't keep that prayer life going and so
[48:57] Adam communed and he fellowshipped with
[48:59] God and and the sake of the communion
[49:02] that he had he was able to do it without
[49:04] any sin in his life for he had never
[49:07] sinned a man he he prayed without any
[49:11] interference uh uh from Satan for Satan
[49:15] had not yet the power that he has today
[49:18] he was not able to inflict Adam with
[49:21] mind battles he was not able to inflict
[49:23] Adam with uh diseases and sickness and
[49:27] fear and dread and worry and all of
[49:31] these things Adam was able to fellowship
[49:33] with God and and not have any
[49:36] interference
[49:38] from Satan he he he he prayed with an
[49:42] understanding that he was a Son of God
[49:45] he prayed having an understanding of his
[49:49] position he he prayed understanding that
[49:54] his words had power
[49:57] I I I think that when Adam commune with
[50:01] God fear wasn't mixed with his words
[50:05] uh worry wasn't mixed with his prayer
[50:09] unbelief wasn't mixed uh uh with the the
[50:13] communion that Adam had with God can you
[50:16] say man amen and so uh Adam when he
[50:22] prayed to God uh he didn't have to have
[50:25] a blood sacrifice because he hadn't
[50:27] sinned yet
[50:28] it was a communion with God it was what
[50:31] what a fellowship what a what a joy it
[50:35] must have been just to go to God and and
[50:38] talk with him ain't that right
[50:41] Adam he prayed as a Son of God not as a
[50:45] sinner he prayed as a son of God
[50:48] he fellowshipped as a son not as a
[50:52] sinner
[50:52] so you can you can see the kind of
[50:55] Fellowship that God wants to have with
[50:58] you and I
[51:00] a fellowship that that not not he wants
[51:04] a fellowship where there's no worry
[51:06] involved
[51:07] he wants a fellowship where there's no
[51:10] unbelief involved he wants a fellowship
[51:14] a man where there's not anxiety involved
[51:18] can you say man
[51:21] a man he wants a fellowship see and and
[51:24] so uh uh he he wants us to come
[51:29] and and in our prayer be as a son and
[51:33] daughter of God and not as a sinner
[51:37] you see when man sinned the holy image
[51:40] of God left him
[51:42] his understanding became darkened
[51:45] and I I look to hear in Ephesians 4 17.
[51:49] Paul speaking of the Gentiles say this I
[51:52] say therefore and testify in the Lord
[51:55] that you walk you henceforth walk not as
[51:58] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[52:00] their mind having the understanding
[52:03] darkened being alienated from the life
[52:07] of God through the ignorance that is in
[52:09] them because of the blindness of their
[52:11] heart ain't that right now Paul talking
[52:13] of the Gentiles here but I can't help
[52:16] but believe that this was the condition
[52:18] of all men a man when after after the
[52:22] fall amen I believe that Abel was even
[52:26] in this same condition until God opened
[52:29] the eyes of his understanding by
[52:31] revelation
[52:32] you see if there's any understanding
[52:35] it's going to take God to open our eyes
[52:37] it's not something that you you ain't
[52:39] going to get this kind of understanding
[52:41] through Seminary you're not going to get
[52:43] this kind of understanding just just uh
[52:46] my church or or even even reading the
[52:49] Bible it's it's all of these things are
[52:52] important I'm sure but God has to give
[52:54] the understanding and that understanding
[52:56] comes by Revelation ain't that right and
[52:59] if you you look in the in in the Hebrews
[53:03] uh there the 11th chapter by Faith by
[53:05] faith talks about Abraham by faith it
[53:08] talks about Noah by faith and Moses by
[53:11] faith and every one of these we call it
[53:13] the faith chapter and and all these
[53:16] things but what it was what God would
[53:18] Enlighten their understanding
[53:21] he enlightens them in in in some way or
[53:24] another and and uh and and so uh uh it
[53:29] takes God to give the understanding but
[53:32] but even after the fall man has always
[53:35] prayed and and worshiped and you know
[53:39] the majority of prayers have been
[53:42] offered throughout time without any
[53:45] understanding
[53:47] many men prayed today without
[53:49] understanding
[53:51] they've been throughout years and years
[53:53] of all through the history of mankind
[53:56] it's prayer has been offered up without
[53:58] understanding
[54:00] the majority of men who have prayed have
[54:03] done so not having an understanding of
[54:06] God
[54:07] they have prayed without understanding
[54:09] of who he is and what he is they have
[54:12] prayed without understanding
[54:14] his Redemptive work not understanding
[54:18] his power his faithfulness his love not
[54:21] understanding his mind not understanding
[54:24] the difference between a sinner and a
[54:26] saint
[54:27] amen many many prayers have been offered
[54:31] not understanding the grace of God
[54:34] amen not understanding the promises of
[54:37] God can you say man
[54:38] and and it's because man has become
[54:41] alienated from from from God it was the
[54:46] sin that that that kept man uh in in
[54:49] that in that condition and and so all
[54:54] kinds of prayers have been uttered
[54:56] sorrowful prayers mournful prayers
[54:59] faithless prayers unintelligent prayers
[55:02] and all these things and and it just
[55:05] shows uh just how estranged the
[55:10] relationship between God and man is
[55:14] and this word estranged is having lost
[55:17] former closeness and affection in a
[55:21] state of alienation from a previous
[55:24] close or familial uh relationship and so
[55:28] so I I think our prayers
[55:32] can you can tell by our walk with God by
[55:36] our prayers you can tell of our
[55:39] understanding of God by our prayers
[55:41] amen and and so uh uh with all of these
[55:47] things God doesn't just want a prayer
[55:49] uttered a man he wants us to pray with
[55:52] understanding
[55:54] he doesn't want us just to be
[55:56] churchgoers but he wants us to come and
[55:59] and have understanding
[56:01] he doesn't want us just to worship he
[56:04] wants us to worship with understanding
[56:06] he doesn't want us just to read the word
[56:08] but he wants us to read the word with
[56:10] understanding he doesn't want us just to
[56:13] say man to something he wants us to say
[56:15] Amen with understanding it it there has
[56:18] to be an understanding to this can you
[56:21] say man and and so God has made it to
[56:25] where we don't have to be estranged from
[56:28] him
[56:28] and and Ephesians 2 and 12 uh through 16
[56:33] it says that at that time you were
[56:35] without Christ being aliens uh from the
[56:38] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[56:40] from the covenants a promise having no
[56:42] hope and with god without God in the
[56:44] world but now everybody say now in
[56:48] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far
[56:51] off are made not by the blood of Christ
[56:55] for he is our peace who hath made both
[56:58] one and hath broken down the middle wall
[57:01] a partition between us having abolished
[57:05] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[57:08] Commandments or contained in ordinance
[57:11] for to make in himself of Twain one new
[57:14] man so making peace and that he might
[57:18] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[57:21] the cross having slain the enmity
[57:23] thereby ain't that right so we're made
[57:27] we're we're made drug now unto God by
[57:30] the blood here's Hebrews 7 and 14 for
[57:33] the law made nothing perfect but the
[57:36] bringing in of a better hope did by the
[57:39] which we draw nigh unto God
[57:44] now you think of that so God been
[57:46] working all these time seeking a
[57:50] Reconciliation to bring us back and not
[57:54] just to make us church goers not to make
[57:57] us just uh uh having a form of Holiness
[58:01] or a form of godliness but to bring us
[58:03] back into relationship and fellowship
[58:07] and where we could have a greater
[58:10] understanding of God than what Even Adam
[58:13] had
[58:16] so we draw Night by the blood of Jesus
[58:19] Christ therefore we are not to keep
[58:23] praying a sinner's prayer every time we
[58:27] pray
[58:30] can you say Amen
[58:31] we're not Sinners no more
[58:34] ain't that right
[58:36] that's right you know brother Branham he
[58:39] says God looking through the blood he
[58:41] doesn't see you no more as a sinner he
[58:43] sees you redeemed
[58:45] amen you're redeemed because he always
[58:48] everybody say always sees you through
[58:50] Christ that's the reason we can be
[58:54] perfect
[58:55] not perfect in the sense of sinless
[58:58] we're perfect in the eyes of God when
[59:01] we're in Christ
[59:03] another place brother Brown said I might
[59:05] be a sinner in your sight but if I'm in
[59:07] Christ God don't see it because his sins
[59:12] atoned or his blood a toned for my sins
[59:16] there
[59:17] see I can't sin can you say that with me
[59:20] I can't sin
[59:22] I can't sin he that's born of God does
[59:25] not commit sin for he cannot sin the
[59:30] seed of God remains in him if he makes a
[59:34] mistake sure he's right then willing to
[59:37] confess it if he's a real Christian he
[59:39] will do it if he holds it back it shows
[59:42] he ain't got nothing in the first place
[59:44] he hasn't got nothing to begin with can
[59:46] you say man
[59:48] see so so we're looking that that God
[59:52] wanting a fellowship not with just human
[59:55] beings but with his children
[1:00:00] with his children
[1:00:02] and not to come as as one him holy and
[1:00:07] we're unrighteous
[1:00:09] and and we don't have a clue as to who
[1:00:12] he is because your sin would keep him
[1:00:14] keep you from him
[1:00:16] yeah ain't that right but God would make
[1:00:19] an atonement to where you would become
[1:00:22] righteous just as he is
[1:00:25] that you would become holy just as he is
[1:00:28] and that God would look at you as a
[1:00:31] sinner but he would look at you as
[1:00:34] righteous as holy through the blood of
[1:00:37] Jesus Christ
[1:00:39] so now you can come boldly
[1:00:43] ain't that right
[1:00:44] brother Brown says the church seems to
[1:00:46] be so scared of things
[1:00:49] but he says you got nothing to be scared
[1:00:51] about
[1:00:52] can you say that with me I got nothing
[1:00:53] to be scared about
[1:00:57] nearly the the first word that Jesus
[1:00:59] said after his resurrection was fear not
[1:01:02] fear not why he took the fear away
[1:01:06] he took the anxiety away so brother
[1:01:09] Brown said don't get scared there ain't
[1:01:12] nothing going to happen
[1:01:14] nothing can happen nothing can bother a
[1:01:18] Christian
[1:01:19] not even death itself can even touch the
[1:01:22] Christian
[1:01:23] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:01:25] on him that sent me hath everlasting
[1:01:27] life and shall not everybody say shall
[1:01:29] not come into condemnation but has
[1:01:32] passed from Death unto life
[1:01:34] so therefore death has no Reign on a
[1:01:38] Christian
[1:01:39] ain't that right
[1:01:41] so then brother Bram says what a faith
[1:01:45] that ought to build up in the people
[1:01:48] something that'll told the mark
[1:01:51] ain't that right you don't want your
[1:01:53] prayer to be wishy-washy
[1:01:55] you don't want your faith to be
[1:01:57] wishy-washy God's looking for somebody
[1:01:59] that'll told the mark
[1:02:02] ain't that right now you know good and
[1:02:04] well he's not going to keep you from
[1:02:06] challenges
[1:02:07] he ain't going to keep the mountains
[1:02:08] from coming up against you he's not
[1:02:11] going to keep the Giants from from
[1:02:12] bothering you he ain't gonna keep the
[1:02:14] enemy away from you but he wants
[1:02:17] somebody that'll trust him have enough
[1:02:20] understanding of his work of redemption
[1:02:23] can you say Amen have enough
[1:02:26] understanding of his love and of his
[1:02:28] purpose and of his will for their lives
[1:02:31] that they could have the faith to stand
[1:02:34] there and go toe-to-toe with the Devil
[1:02:38] so he says you'll never get nothing by
[1:02:41] being a little jellyfish Christian
[1:02:44] he said did you ever see a jellyfish you
[1:02:46] just hit him and he'll splatter all over
[1:02:48] everything
[1:02:50] see a jellyfish you know what usually
[1:02:52] eats them he says the crabs and things
[1:02:55] along the side of the seashore comes up
[1:02:57] with his pincher and cuts him in two and
[1:02:59] takes him down because the jellyfish
[1:03:01] just lays there brother we need some
[1:03:04] Christians not jellyfish but Christians
[1:03:08] with the backbone that'll stand ain't
[1:03:10] that right he's I don't mean to I don't
[1:03:13] mean to fuss with people but stand
[1:03:15] everybody say stand for your god-given
[1:03:18] rights that Christ died for can you say
[1:03:21] amen amen that's why you can cast all
[1:03:24] your care upon him for he made a way
[1:03:27] that you could do so
[1:03:32] you're justified in doing it
[1:03:35] you know that you're justified in taking
[1:03:37] all your cares and casting it upon him
[1:03:40] ain't that right
[1:03:42] amen so as Sons and Daughters of God our
[1:03:46] word should have power
[1:03:49] amen we should believe that
[1:03:51] we should understand that not as sons of
[1:03:54] Adam but sons of God
[1:03:57] see for the word is in our mouth we've
[1:03:59] quoted this James 5 16 the effectual
[1:04:02] fervent prayer of a righteous man of
[1:04:04] veileth much ain't that right fervent
[1:04:07] prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:04:09] righteous man of veileth much
[1:04:11] we've read this before Mark 11 22 and
[1:04:14] Jesus answering Seth unto them have
[1:04:16] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[1:04:19] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:04:21] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:04:23] cast into the sea shall not doubt in his
[1:04:25] heart but shall believe that those
[1:04:27] things which he's saith shall come to
[1:04:29] pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:04:32] he shall have not might he shall he
[1:04:36] shall have therefore I say unto you what
[1:04:38] things so ever you desire When you pray
[1:04:40] believe that you receive them and you
[1:04:43] shall have them
[1:04:45] ain't that right so now you're coming
[1:04:48] with a a a a boldness you're coming with
[1:04:50] the confidence
[1:04:52] you're coming with an understanding
[1:04:55] that whatever I ask whatever I speak
[1:04:59] amen my words will have power they they
[1:05:02] are affect us
[1:05:03] ain't that right
[1:05:05] yes sir the only way that your words can
[1:05:09] have
[1:05:10] power or be effective When you pray is
[1:05:12] nothing condemning you
[1:05:14] and First John 3 and 20 it says if our
[1:05:17] heart condemn us God is greater than our
[1:05:20] heart and knoweth all things beloved if
[1:05:23] our heart condemneth not then we have
[1:05:25] confidence toward God
[1:05:28] ain't that right so so what we want is
[1:05:31] we want confidence with our prayer
[1:05:33] we want confidence we we we we don't
[1:05:36] want to take these things lightly we
[1:05:39] want we don't want to take our prayer
[1:05:40] lightly we don't want to take the the
[1:05:42] thing that God has given us for granted
[1:05:47] ain't that right
[1:05:48] some trust in chariots some trusting
[1:05:50] horses some trusting this and this and
[1:05:52] that but we trust in the name of the
[1:05:55] Lord
[1:05:56] we've got the greatest weapon in our
[1:05:58] hands and that's prayer
[1:06:00] ain't that right
[1:06:01] so therefore now you're coming you're
[1:06:04] not coming worrying you're not coming
[1:06:06] you're not coming uh uh uh with unbelief
[1:06:10] you're not coming questioning god well
[1:06:12] can you really do that no he's bringing
[1:06:15] us back to what Adam was in in the
[1:06:18] beginning
[1:06:19] and what was Adam in the beginning Satan
[1:06:22] had no control over him
[1:06:24] Satan could not touch him
[1:06:26] Satan could not affect him can you say
[1:06:29] Amen
[1:06:30] now God's made it to where you know well
[1:06:32] anyway so so we got to have faith and
[1:06:36] and brother Brian said how can you have
[1:06:38] faith when you know you're not walking
[1:06:41] in his word when you know there's things
[1:06:44] there that you ought to say and you
[1:06:46] don't say it there's things there you
[1:06:49] ought to teach and you don't teach it
[1:06:50] there's things there you can't say and
[1:06:52] how can you have faith when you know
[1:06:55] you're wrong ain't that right he says
[1:06:57] another place if I regard iniquity in my
[1:07:00] heart then God will not hear my prayer
[1:07:03] said David so what is Iniquity iniquity
[1:07:06] is something that you know that you're
[1:07:07] doing that you ought not to do and still
[1:07:10] won't repent of it see if I regard
[1:07:13] iniquity in my heart knowing that I
[1:07:15] should do it I don't do it see then God
[1:07:17] promised the bible promises that God
[1:07:19] will not hear your prayer if you know
[1:07:21] that you should do it and won't do it
[1:07:23] ain't that right so then he says stay
[1:07:27] with that word
[1:07:29] now I can tell you what you need to do
[1:07:31] but if you stay with the word of God
[1:07:34] I can't condemn your heart God can
[1:07:36] condemn your heart
[1:07:38] and if you're not walking in the word
[1:07:40] there's that condemnation that strikes
[1:07:42] there especially if you're a son and
[1:07:44] daughter of God ain't that right so stay
[1:07:46] with the word because we want our
[1:07:49] prayers to be effective
[1:07:51] ain't that right and this is the whole
[1:07:54] point of the restoration of the word of
[1:07:56] God in this day that there would not be
[1:07:58] any confusion as to what to believe and
[1:08:02] what not to believe
[1:08:04] ain't that right because we're coming
[1:08:06] back to perfect fellowship with God a
[1:08:09] perfect Faith with God we see that God
[1:08:12] has Vindicated it time and time and time
[1:08:15] again and we can rest our faith in that
[1:08:19] without questions ain't that right so
[1:08:22] stay the prophet said stay with that
[1:08:24] word where there's nothing condemned
[1:08:28] now Romans 8 and 1 Paul would tell us
[1:08:31] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:08:34] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:08:37] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:08:39] spirit amen don't walk after the flesh
[1:08:41] but walk after the spirit and the spirit
[1:08:43] leads with the word
[1:08:45] the spirit comes from the word ain't
[1:08:48] that right because Brother Brad said it
[1:08:50] can only come out of the word the spirit
[1:08:52] can only come out of the word his word
[1:08:55] is spirit ain't that right so he says
[1:08:58] the real true spirit of God can only
[1:09:00] speak the word of God so walk after the
[1:09:03] spirit
[1:09:05] not after the flesh the flesh will deny
[1:09:08] it the flesh will deny everything it's
[1:09:10] got your feelings the sensations and and
[1:09:13] and the carnal and the enmities and and
[1:09:16] all of these things it works against God
[1:09:19] yeah it's so easily lured by the things
[1:09:22] of the world
[1:09:23] and and and there's so much condemnation
[1:09:26] in them things
[1:09:27] ain't that right so then when you come
[1:09:30] into prayer and and your heart is
[1:09:32] condemning you well well you you you
[1:09:35] ain't gonna get nowhere because you
[1:09:36] cannot the Bible says it you cannot
[1:09:39] believe
[1:09:41] you cannot have confidence as long as
[1:09:44] there's something hid in your heart
[1:09:47] so we got to get all that cleaned out
[1:09:49] ain't that right so then when when when
[1:09:53] all of the sin and when all of the
[1:09:56] iniquity is out of our heart then watch
[1:09:59] your prayer go to work
[1:10:02] brother man says see then don't be
[1:10:04] afraid to say to this mountain be moved
[1:10:06] say it stay there and watch her crumble
[1:10:12] and you say man see it's not just now an
[1:10:15] utterance of words but there's power in
[1:10:19] them words
[1:10:20] it's it's just not going through the
[1:10:22] routine routine of prayer and getting up
[1:10:25] and nothing is happening
[1:10:27] but now you are a son of God you've been
[1:10:30] restored back into Fellowship
[1:10:33] ain't that right
[1:10:36] now he says see stay there and watch her
[1:10:39] crumble that's right but if you got any
[1:10:41] condemnation there you better keep still
[1:10:43] for you're just babbling then
[1:10:47] so we don't want to just Babble in our
[1:10:49] prayer
[1:10:50] well I pray you know I pray every
[1:10:51] morning every night and every noon and I
[1:10:53] just pray pray pray that's fine but are
[1:10:56] your words babbling are you just
[1:10:58] babbling or are you getting somewhere
[1:11:00] with God
[1:11:02] can you say man he said see uh uh if you
[1:11:06] got any condemnation there you better
[1:11:07] keep still you're just babbling then
[1:11:09] you're not saying the truth you're not
[1:11:11] saying the things that you should say
[1:11:14] ain't that right
[1:11:16] so now uh not to keep you much longer
[1:11:20] but
[1:11:21] if you notice after man it's sinned then
[1:11:24] he marred his soul in darkness and
[1:11:27] Blackness came into it
[1:11:29] and brother Brown says then God came
[1:11:31] down and lived in man suffered with man
[1:11:33] to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes
[1:11:36] into man and drives that Blackness and
[1:11:38] sin away from him aren't you glad for
[1:11:40] that
[1:11:40] aren't you glad that you have no
[1:11:42] Blackness and sin God drove it all away
[1:11:46] oh my see when he sinned the holy image
[1:11:49] of God left him his channels become
[1:11:52] clawed his understanding become darkened
[1:11:56] oh and it's so true now amen see and now
[1:12:01] he says the Holy Spirit comes into man
[1:12:03] and drives that Blackness and sin away
[1:12:05] from him and brings it back into perfect
[1:12:08] Fellowship a part of God
[1:12:12] and now we by the blood of Christ who
[1:12:15] cleanses us from sins we become Sons and
[1:12:19] Daughters of God who is God the one that
[1:12:22] stood there and rolled Stars off of his
[1:12:24] hands and rode worlds out of his hands
[1:12:27] and made the things which do not appear
[1:12:29] deity and deity himself lives in man the
[1:12:34] Creator that made Heaven and Earth lives
[1:12:37] in mankind why no wonder cripples see
[1:12:40] when you realize that can't straighten
[1:12:42] out the Creator's here no wonder blind
[1:12:45] when they can't see opens up and and and
[1:12:49] because the Creator is here can you say
[1:12:51] Amen you see that that's what causes the
[1:12:54] blind eyes to see is the creators here
[1:12:56] that's that's what causes the to
[1:12:58] walk that's what causes the death to
[1:13:00] hear that's that's what causes the
[1:13:02] mountains move to move is the creator is
[1:13:05] here where in you he's come to abide in
[1:13:09] you ain't that right now it's no longer
[1:13:12] Christ in his Corporal body a man
[1:13:16] speaking Lazarus come forth but now
[1:13:19] there's that same authoritative voice
[1:13:21] that is in you as a Son of God that when
[1:13:25] you speak even death can give it up
[1:13:27] death has no hold over a child of God
[1:13:31] true
[1:13:34] amen he says see we the Bible said we
[1:13:37] are Sons and Daughters of God his
[1:13:38] offspring then we're something like God
[1:13:41] was
[1:13:42] Jesus said himself it is written you are
[1:13:44] Gods written in your law see we become a
[1:13:46] part of God a Son of God by adoption
[1:13:49] through Jesus Christ
[1:13:51] now this is the greatest our
[1:13:53] understanding is becoming greater than
[1:13:55] we've ever had in the history of mankind
[1:13:58] in my opinion and my belief because this
[1:14:02] is the time of adoption
[1:14:05] Brother Brad plainly tells us there was
[1:14:07] no other time of adoption
[1:14:09] outside this time
[1:14:11] ain't that right
[1:14:13] even what they done on the day of
[1:14:15] Pentecost and in the book of Acts that
[1:14:16] was only a seed
[1:14:18] that was seed the potential was there
[1:14:20] but now we are we have come back to see
[1:14:23] it again but we're the ripening we're
[1:14:25] the ripen can you say man and and so uh
[1:14:30] as we're ripening in this presence of
[1:14:32] the son of uh uh in the s-o-n amen we're
[1:14:37] taking on adoption
[1:14:39] hello Church where adoption's not far
[1:14:43] from you I believe adoption is here I
[1:14:45] believe the spirit of adoption is here I
[1:14:47] believe that people are the sons and
[1:14:49] daughters are are being adopted a man in
[1:14:52] this age for this is the age of adoption
[1:14:54] ain't that right and we become part of
[1:14:57] God now you always was the son of God
[1:14:59] but notice you're taking on uh uh
[1:15:03] rulership you're taking on Authority as
[1:15:06] a Son of God now you're taking over the
[1:15:09] father's business because you know uh
[1:15:12] you you watched and studied how the
[1:15:14] father would conduct his business now
[1:15:16] you're conducting the business as the
[1:15:19] father would the father just steps back
[1:15:21] and lets you lest the sun take over and
[1:15:25] the and and it will in this case the
[1:15:27] father hides himself in the Sun
[1:15:30] Sons and Daughters can you say Amen we
[1:15:33] become part of God a Son of God by
[1:15:36] adoption through Jesus Christ therefore
[1:15:38] if you realize if you realize that the
[1:15:41] very God that made the dirt and the
[1:15:43] Earth and whatever's here is living
[1:15:45] among men where is our faith at
[1:15:50] and you say man I hope I'm making sense
[1:15:52] to you but where's our faith at what
[1:15:55] faith should we have
[1:15:57] faith in in God oh yeah I know God can
[1:15:59] do it or faith in what you are
[1:16:02] faith in your words faith in your prayer
[1:16:04] faith in your in what you are as a son
[1:16:08] of God
[1:16:09] can you say Amen
[1:16:14] I've said it before you know
[1:16:17] brother Brandon talks with the two faith
[1:16:20] of the the Jew and the the Gentile
[1:16:25] Jarius he told Jesus he said my
[1:16:28] daughter's sick if you just come and lay
[1:16:30] your hands he said I'll do that
[1:16:33] then later on the the Centurion
[1:16:37] you know he he just said I'm not worthy
[1:16:39] that you'd come under my roof if you
[1:16:41] just speak the word
[1:16:43] and it was two types of faith
[1:16:45] but you know as I studied reading that
[1:16:47] and studying it a while back it it just
[1:16:50] it just come clear to me and you take it
[1:16:53] whatever but but that that was the faith
[1:16:57] of the Jew that was the faith of the the
[1:16:58] the the Gentile but then there was the
[1:17:01] faith that Jesus had himself
[1:17:04] Jesus wouldn't have went over and laid
[1:17:06] hands if he didn't have the faith
[1:17:09] Jesus wouldn't have spoke the word if he
[1:17:11] didn't have the faith
[1:17:14] Jesus wouldn't have even went to the
[1:17:15] grave of Lazarus if he didn't have faith
[1:17:18] but where was his faith he had Faith the
[1:17:21] prophet will talk about in perfect Faith
[1:17:23] he had faith in who he was
[1:17:26] right
[1:17:27] the Jew had faith in his touch
[1:17:30] the Centurion had faith in his word but
[1:17:33] Jesus had faith in who he was
[1:17:36] ain't that right and if we realize that
[1:17:39] we are the prophecy
[1:17:41] if we realize that what God had in the
[1:17:44] behind her part of his mind we are the
[1:17:47] manifestation of that
[1:17:49] then our faith is in what we are in what
[1:17:52] the word says we are
[1:17:56] and you say man see how how that makes
[1:17:58] our prayers different that makes our
[1:18:00] approach to God different
[1:18:05] so he said see Jesus said the things
[1:18:08] that I do when he was on Earth greater
[1:18:10] shall you do for I go into my father
[1:18:12] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:18:14] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:18:16] you shall have them that's the Creator
[1:18:18] speaking is that right then it doesn't
[1:18:21] lay in him it lays in US
[1:18:25] ain't that right
[1:18:28] then we in Fellowship what Adam lost in
[1:18:33] the fall Christ restored in his death to
[1:18:36] bring man back into fellowship with God
[1:18:40] now the church has moved up to that
[1:18:42] fellowship with God communion like Adam
[1:18:46] had in the beginning In the Garden of
[1:18:48] Eden taken away all sin free from
[1:18:51] condemnation the Holy Spirit cleansing
[1:18:53] us from all sin now everybody say now
[1:18:57] you're free to exercise the next step in
[1:19:00] God
[1:19:02] that's what the prophet said
[1:19:04] no no no no no condemnation no sin
[1:19:08] you've been cleansed how many has been
[1:19:09] cleansed
[1:19:11] amen you didn't walk in here a sinner if
[1:19:14] you did you need to get saved
[1:19:18] that you didn't come in here a sinner
[1:19:19] you're not worshiping as a sinner
[1:19:22] you're not saying amen as a sinner
[1:19:24] you're not praying as a sinner you're
[1:19:26] not uh singing as a sinner I'm not
[1:19:29] preaching as a sinner not playing music
[1:19:32] as a sinner we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:19:35] God that God has cleansed with his own
[1:19:38] blood and sealed us with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:42] can you say Amen now we're free to
[1:19:46] exercise the next step in God
[1:19:49] so now notice what the prophet said if
[1:19:52] our heart condemns us there's no need of
[1:19:54] coming across the platform
[1:19:57] there's no need of asking God for
[1:19:58] anything because you don't have the
[1:20:00] faith to receive it
[1:20:02] but when you have met every requirement
[1:20:04] that God requires then Faith steps out
[1:20:07] there see Faith automatically steps out
[1:20:09] there
[1:20:10] Faith steps out there and says God is
[1:20:13] God I've met the requirements can you
[1:20:16] say Amen
[1:20:17] now we all have to ask forgiveness on a
[1:20:20] daily basis
[1:20:21] amen because we make we make mistakes
[1:20:24] and we well the prophet said we
[1:20:26] backslide every day
[1:20:29] but here in Ephesians 1 5 we talked on
[1:20:32] it before but Ephesians 1 5 having
[1:20:34] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:20:36] children
[1:20:37] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[1:20:39] the good pleasure of his will
[1:20:41] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:20:43] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:20:46] Beloved aren't you glad for that
[1:20:48] he hath made us not a priest not Pope
[1:20:52] not not not preacher God made us
[1:20:55] accepted Christ made us accepted in whom
[1:20:58] we have Redemption through his blood the
[1:21:00] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:21:02] riches of his grace
[1:21:04] now you know Paul is talking to the
[1:21:06] Saints who are in Christ Jesus he's not
[1:21:09] talking to those outside of Christ
[1:21:11] talking to those that are in ain't that
[1:21:13] right so Christians sin but they're not
[1:21:16] sinners
[1:21:18] the brand said Christian sins
[1:21:21] Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin
[1:21:25] a sinner doesn't sin because he's a
[1:21:28] sinner
[1:21:29] he's just a sinner to begin with and
[1:21:31] that's all see here he said take the
[1:21:34] back of this book it's black
[1:21:36] how much of that you know you you it's
[1:21:39] all black you can't just say part of
[1:21:40] it's black whatever it's all black so he
[1:21:43] said see the whole thing it's all black
[1:21:44] that's the way a sinner is he's just
[1:21:46] condemned to start with
[1:21:48] well you say well what about if he
[1:21:49] commits adultery what if he ravishes a
[1:21:51] woman what if he gambles what if he
[1:21:53] shoots somebody that's none of our
[1:21:54] business see that's none of our business
[1:21:55] we got laws down here to take care of
[1:21:57] that we're not reformers we're preachers
[1:21:59] of the Gospel so we don't condemn him
[1:22:01] for what he's done we don't condemn him
[1:22:03] for committing adultery we condemn him
[1:22:06] because he's a sinner
[1:22:07] if he was a Christian he wouldn't do it
[1:22:09] that's right if he's been changed he
[1:22:11] won't do that because he's a sinner
[1:22:13] that's what makes him do that can you
[1:22:15] say man so we you are sealed with all
[1:22:18] the ghosts we're not Sinners we are Sons
[1:22:21] and Daughters of God
[1:22:26] ain't that right
[1:22:27] now God fellowshipped with Adam knowing
[1:22:31] he could sin
[1:22:35] but God fellowships with you and I
[1:22:37] knowing we can't sin
[1:22:40] can you say Amen
[1:22:43] God fellowships With Us what a
[1:22:45] relationship
[1:22:48] that we have with God how secure we are
[1:22:53] knowing that we cannot fall
[1:22:57] God Fellowship without him knowing that
[1:22:59] he could fall knowing that he would fall
[1:23:03] that God fellowships With Us knowing we
[1:23:06] cannot fall
[1:23:08] we we cannot go back
[1:23:11] because we've been sealed unto the day
[1:23:14] of our Redemption
[1:23:16] and you say Amen
[1:23:17] brother Graham talks about Eve and how
[1:23:19] that God told her not to do such and
[1:23:21] such and she turned around and listened
[1:23:23] to the devil
[1:23:24] and she listened to him and and done
[1:23:27] exactly what God told her not to do but
[1:23:29] he says but the Eve in this last day is
[1:23:32] not going to do it thank you
[1:23:35] because she's predestinated not to do it
[1:23:38] yes sir God is going to do it he knows
[1:23:42] he'll have it see he said he'd have a
[1:23:44] church without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:23:46] she's going to stand there in the
[1:23:49] Splendor of him his word may manifest
[1:23:51] and she'll be a talk into the world well
[1:23:55] he didn't say that about he but he says
[1:23:57] it about you
[1:24:00] can you say Amen
[1:24:03] and if a man God would have fellowship
[1:24:06] with a man knowing he would fall how
[1:24:09] much more Fellowship do you have with
[1:24:11] him
[1:24:12] of his work of redemption
[1:24:15] claimed you
[1:24:18] Brown said a man that's born of God
[1:24:20] cannot sin he does not sin there's no
[1:24:22] way for him to sin how can it be a
[1:24:24] sinner and redeemed at the same time
[1:24:26] how can I be in the pawn shop and out of
[1:24:28] the pawn shop at the same time
[1:24:30] he redeemed Us by his blood by his
[1:24:33] Spirit he cleansed us and then comes to
[1:24:35] dwell in us the church not the
[1:24:36] denomination now the church ain't that
[1:24:38] right
[1:24:39] so here Proverbs 24 16 it says that just
[1:24:43] man fall of seven times and riseth up
[1:24:46] again
[1:24:48] he falls down seven times and yet he's
[1:24:51] still not a sinner
[1:24:52] he rises back up again can you say amen
[1:24:56] and God can have
[1:24:59] think of that
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:05] God can have fellowship with us
[1:25:09] therefore you cannot pray as a sinner
[1:25:13] amen you love the Lord
[1:25:17] amen
[1:25:21] you say well I prayed I prayed
[1:25:24] and the musicians can come
[1:25:27] you say well I you know I've and I'm not
[1:25:30] getting anywhere what's wrong
[1:25:32] you know
[1:25:37] I believe that
[1:25:41] if your heart condemns you
[1:25:44] you know it it condemns you and what it
[1:25:47] does it convicts you
[1:25:49] it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't make
[1:25:51] you unworthy it doesn't say that you're
[1:25:53] unworthy there's a difference really in
[1:25:55] condemnation and conviction
[1:25:58] condemnation Works death
[1:26:01] conviction brings to repentance
[1:26:04] and brings life
[1:26:06] ain't that right so when your heart is
[1:26:09] comes under a conviction
[1:26:11] and it tells you you're not doing this
[1:26:13] and you should be doing this and you
[1:26:15] know better and you know that way you
[1:26:16] can't have faith
[1:26:19] with God your faith won't be there it
[1:26:22] just won't the Bible says it it won't
[1:26:24] you won't be able to have confidence
[1:26:26] but then when you you've got a blood and
[1:26:28] brother Brown says there's that blood
[1:26:29] that that keeps us covered all the time
[1:26:32] because we're so stupid
[1:26:34] and we're going to make we're going to
[1:26:36] make mistakes as we go through life
[1:26:37] ain't that right
[1:26:39] but then you know if your heart doesn't
[1:26:42] condemn you
[1:26:44] you know it's it's you're you're you're
[1:26:46] you got the desire to serve God you're
[1:26:49] you're walking in the word you're you're
[1:26:51] you're believing everything that God
[1:26:53] would say by the prophet
[1:26:59] but then you say well but but
[1:27:01] my prayer ain't getting answered
[1:27:05] well
[1:27:07] that's when you got to stay
[1:27:10] and that's where you got to keep hanging
[1:27:12] in there
[1:27:14] because brother Brown says I believe God
[1:27:16] hears prayer
[1:27:19] but God don't always have to answer
[1:27:21] prayer right then
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:25] God answers in his own time
[1:27:29] and I think that's where the matured
[1:27:31] Sons and Daughters of God we're having
[1:27:34] this understanding when we come to
[1:27:36] prayer we're not we're not we're not
[1:27:38] moving God to answer right then
[1:27:41] we're not saying all right God you
[1:27:42] better do it now I'm you know no that's
[1:27:45] that's a little kid that that's a little
[1:27:47] child
[1:27:48] demanding his way
[1:27:50] but as matured sons of God we have this
[1:27:53] understanding that it doesn't matter if
[1:27:55] it's tomorrow it doesn't matter if he
[1:27:57] does it a month from now it doesn't
[1:27:59] matter God everything will work out
[1:28:01] according to his time
[1:28:03] and there's no weapon formed against us
[1:28:06] that's going to prosper
[1:28:07] it looked as though God Christ Jesus
[1:28:11] came four days late for Lazarus but in
[1:28:14] all reality he come right on time
[1:28:17] ain't that right so we have this
[1:28:20] understanding as sons of God because now
[1:28:23] we have the mind of Christ that God does
[1:28:25] not work all the time when we think he
[1:28:27] ought to work and and and it seems like
[1:28:30] when everything is about to fall apart
[1:28:32] we just have this understanding he'll
[1:28:35] answer our prayer in his own time
[1:28:38] he's gonna answer
[1:28:40] so God answers in his own time brother
[1:28:43] Brown said if you've asked him and
[1:28:45] believe him then he will answer in his
[1:28:48] own time
[1:28:50] and you say man
[1:28:52] so I imagine he said see when they was
[1:28:54] praying talking about the four Hebrew
[1:28:56] children he says when they when they was
[1:28:58] praying he said I can see the Angels
[1:29:00] standing around the Throne of God where
[1:29:02] God was setting saying they're in prayer
[1:29:04] they're under strain and God replies oh
[1:29:07] yeah I know but they'll hold out true
[1:29:09] I've Got Confidence in them they're my
[1:29:12] servant Abraham's seed so they'll hold
[1:29:14] true so a lot of times God is bragging
[1:29:17] on us
[1:29:20] God is bragging
[1:29:23] because God's got confidence in you as a
[1:29:25] Son of God God's got confidence in you
[1:29:27] as a daughter of God
[1:29:30] he knows
[1:29:32] ain't that right
[1:29:34] then we understand that in his wisdom
[1:29:37] he's got wisdom
[1:29:39] he's got a reason for not answering
[1:29:40] right away
[1:29:42] he's got a reason for not doing things
[1:29:44] the way we want him to do and we think
[1:29:46] it ought to be done this way
[1:29:48] so then we with understanding knowing
[1:29:51] that we're praying to a wise God we're
[1:29:53] fellowshipping the all-wise God and when
[1:29:56] he moves he moves according to his
[1:29:58] wisdom and his understanding you love
[1:30:01] him in the Lord wonderful
[1:30:05] God bless you
[1:30:07] brother Brown said this I will read this
[1:30:09] he says if you abide in me
[1:30:12] he is the word see my words abiding in
[1:30:15] you you can ask what you will
[1:30:18] I know see then if if Christianity was
[1:30:21] the word of God see
[1:30:24] and he was the word and by accepting the
[1:30:26] word and the word lived through him then
[1:30:28] I know if he abide in me and my word in
[1:30:31] you ask what you will and if you are in
[1:30:34] the word and part of the word you'll
[1:30:36] only ask if I say you'll only ask
[1:30:39] you'll only ask what the word tells you
[1:30:42] to ask
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:45] know the day you're living then and ask
[1:30:49] accordingly
[1:30:51] can you say Amen
[1:30:53] see now your prayer is is word based
[1:30:58] the word based
[1:31:00] he promised his supply all your needs
[1:31:04] is that right
[1:31:06] but you say oh God if you just bless me
[1:31:07] with the Mercedes that's not what he
[1:31:09] promised
[1:31:11] he promised he'd Supply your needs can
[1:31:14] you say man
[1:31:15] so then you ask according to his word
[1:31:18] you're not asking a miss something evily
[1:31:22] why because you have understanding as
[1:31:24] the Son of God in church if we could
[1:31:27] only realize that this message has
[1:31:28] brought us up to an understanding
[1:31:31] a man that we can now have a a a a
[1:31:34] heart-to-heart talk if we could say it
[1:31:36] that way with our father
[1:31:38] and and the understanding and the
[1:31:40] relationship grows and deepens and and
[1:31:43] and and the father now is able to commit
[1:31:46] the kingdom into our hands knowing that
[1:31:49] we're not going to ask you know for for
[1:31:51] crazy things and things outside his word
[1:31:54] and and and just you know things that he
[1:31:57] cannot back up
[1:32:00] we're not going to ask prayers that he
[1:32:03] cannot support and back up
[1:32:06] it'll be prayers according to his will
[1:32:09] according to his promises prayers that
[1:32:11] he has promised
[1:32:14] and oh there's a lot of promises there
[1:32:17] that we can look and say father you
[1:32:19] promised them
[1:32:21] cast all my cares upon you
[1:32:24] we have in this fellowship with our
[1:32:26] father
[1:32:27] oh God help us to have that
[1:32:29] understanding
[1:32:31] of Who We Are
[1:32:33] that he loves us
[1:32:34] we love him
[1:32:36] and there's nothing there keeping that
[1:32:38] keeping us from him he's done everything
[1:32:42] he can to open up his arms wide and and
[1:32:45] to have that relationship that when we
[1:32:47] would talk he could hear and he could
[1:32:50] answer aren't you glad for that can you
[1:32:53] lift your hands and just worship Our
[1:32:56] Father
[1:32:58] oh we're so thankful Lord for the
[1:33:00] relationship that we have with you and
