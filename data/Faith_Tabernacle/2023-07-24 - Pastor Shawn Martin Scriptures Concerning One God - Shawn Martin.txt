funeral which I've been to a lot of funerals but that was one of the most excellent messages they talked about all the different chains taking place in brother Walker's life you know and from the beginning down to his life and and then this last change they talked about you know First Corinthians 15 51 and verse Thessalonians 4 16 the big change you know that we're fixing to take so I wanted

you there'll be a change after a while where are we now where a friend will wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss but Jesus died upon the cross that we might have a chain after a while the price of change was high in cost indicted all the total loss when the angel put his feet on land and sea but the bride was washed in bleached put her sins far Out Of Reach now the Virgin bride says absolutely free I'm telling you there'll be a change after a while where are we now where a friend will wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss but Jesus died upon the cross that we might have a

I believe yes Lord I believe oh yes I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord Lord I believe that all things are possible I believe [Music] amen only believe ain't that right praise the lord well the musicians can be dismissed and um if you'd like to turn I'm going to turn to two scriptures here to start off with first Peter the third chapter and um we quoted them this morning but I'm going to read them here and first Peter the third chapter and the 15th verse it says but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear amen then if you'll go with me second Timothy 2 14. II Timothy second chapter and we're going to start at the 14th verse 14 and 15. but it says of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers studied to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth and in news 16th verse but Shan shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness amen let's just bow our heads talk to our Lord father we ask that you would just be with us this evening and Lord may your presence just be here Lord and pray that you would just give us all a better understanding Lord and father we just Commit This service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seeds um we we believe that there is only one God and um and I guess I wanted to deal uh with this just for um the sake of the young people or just anyone and I guess most of you young people have been raised in the message and so as I said this morning you have a general idea as to what we believe as message Believers but um it it I I think all of adults here desire that you not just have an understanding as far as what you've been taught by your parents but that you'd be grounded in the scriptures to where you know that what we believe is the absolute truth and I know I desire that for my children and for all of us here that you don't just go by because of what Mom and Dad said or the preacher said or whatever but that you can actually be be grounded in knowing that what you believe is not a fairy tale it but it is it is the truth and and then that way you can base your convictions upon the word of God uh and not upon how you were raised um of course uh it's important that you are raised in the truth but it it it comes to a time that that it's it it's it switches from dead and Mom's convictions to your convictions and uh because you're going to be tested you're going to be tried you're going to go through the uh there's going to be people wanting to know what you believe and they're they're going to ask you they're going to want they're going to want proof and and it's not that you're going to change everybody's mind it's not that you're going to convince everybody but you need to know where you stand be uh I I think it's uh as it's been said before that if someone can talk you into it someone else can talk you out of it and so it's it's got to be something based your your convictions your beliefs have got to be founded up on the word of God and so uh um and I I think that um some of you are finding out that not the majority believe the way we believe and uh and they do not believe the way the Bible teaches and such as the belief that God sent a prophet in this age and uh the idea of a prophet scares so many people and uh and that's and and that's fine and and true it's it's because we've had men that claim to be prophets and and they've LED people into weird ways and uh but but that doesn't do away with the fact that God promised to send a prophet in this day uh and and so uh we're just going to read scriptures uh tonight um being that we have communion and uh so um I got my two boys here um we're going to have them to pass the mic around and um I just told no preaching and just just um okay and then David you can come over here and then uh they've been really excited about this I mean this is something they're really excited about especially with Levi at least I I guess David's excited too but uh so uh David was or Levi was concerned do we do we just put it up on their mouth or do they hold it and it probably best you hold it or you'll be eating it but um so um uh anyways we're we're gonna you you they're going to give you the mic and so you can read them and then re read aloud so everyone can hear and write these scriptures down and we're probably not going to get all the scriptures but we're going to try to get as many as we can the Bible only speaks of one God and that's that's my point of these scriptures uh because people think that they got this idea that there's either one God in three persons or there's three gods and and Etc but there is only one God and no matter what the majority says the Bible's right right and so uh I do want to start off if you'd like to turn with me to Genesis 1 1 and maybe we could just start right there um Genesis 1 1 and you know it but we're going to read it anyways okay um Genesis buying Vine Genesis okay 1-1 it says and you can read it with me in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth in the beginning God created so uh uh we at this point there is only one god mentioned right at the beginning of the Bible God created the Heavenly Earth ain't that right so if a person just had that one scripture just that just start with that one scripture uh that God not God's as in plural but one God God created the Heaven and the Earth ain't that right and as we talked about that this God and that word god means Elohim the self-existent one ain't that right so uh uh we're going to have uh uh let's see uh brother Mark you want to start this off okay Malachi at 2 10. and um and read it uh out loud so that everybody can see what we're doing and and if you want to turn to these scriptures you can as well Malachi 2 10. have we not all one father hath not one God created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the Covenant of our fathers amen so again have we not all one father hath not one God everybody say one God created us so not two or more Gods but one God amen we give brother Amos you want to go to Colossians 1 12. through 17. Colossians 1 12. and read through 17. giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of Darkness it translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature who by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by Him for him and he is before all things by him all things consist amen so his dear son who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of ever creature for by him were all things created amen now uh we'll just keep on but we we look at the scriptures and it tells us that there is one Lord and uh we'll look uh sister Becky you want to read Deuteronomy 6 and 4. Deuteronomy 6 and 4. hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen so the Lord our what God is one Lord and we'll go uh Mark sister Anna you want to read a few scriptures mark 12. 29-30 and also verse 32. mark 12. 29-30 as well as 32. and Jesus answered him first of all God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment and the Scribe said unto him well mastered thou has said the truth for there is one God and there is none other but he amen one God and there's none other and that God is Lord ain't that right the Lord and so we're not he's not com asking us to love two Gods three Gods he's asking us to love the Lord thy God one God ain't that right and that Lord is our creator Romans 3 29 um um sister Alice you want to read that for us Romans 3 29 through 30. is he the god of the Jews only or is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith amen amen amen so it's not only just the Jews that have one God but the same God of the Jews is the god of the Gentiles ain't that right and you cannot get no Orthodox Jew a real Jew to believe that there's more than one God amen and a True Believer of a gentile will only believe there's one God ain't that right so uh uh Ephesians the fourth chapter and uh brother will do you want to read that Ephesians 4 4. through six Ephesians chapter 4 verse 4. through 6. there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling the Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen so one body one Spirit one Lord one God and Father of all ain't that right who is above all through all and in you all amen so uh uh now we uh uh you have to take these scriptures and study when you get home because we could go through a lot of them but if you want to say that with me there is one God and father of all who is above all through all and in you all can I ask you did you quote scripture or did you quote some man in that scripture all right okay so the god that is in you all is the father of all who is above all and through all not the third person in the godhead right not the third person it's not God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost the one God that's in you is father of all above all through all in you all ain't that right amen so uh um John 14 uh Sister Crystal do you want to read for us John 14 26. and I want to just point this out that when it says in you all it's it's uh uh again it's not in in as far as every human being he's talking about sons of God Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right amen so John 14 and 26. Twitter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you amen so the comforter which is the Holy Ghost right and these are Jesus's words brother Branson you want to read uh John 14 16-17 John 14 16-17 Saint John 14 and 16. in in 17. Sister Crystal just read where Jesus said about the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth and not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen so again the spirit of Truth is the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom whom Jesus said the father will send in my name ain't that right now we just read that he what Jesus says for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you ain't that right so here he's saying he dwellers with you uh uh which there he was there in body he was dwelling with them but he says he would dwell in you and we just read there is one God and Father of all who is above all through all and in you all ain't that right so he's not talking about two Gods coming in you it's the one God ain't that right one God so uh um we can look and um let's see here uh we we find that Jesus identified the Holy Ghost as being the comforter that will come and he said that he was dwelling with them then for he dwelleth with you and how did he dwell with them by living in a human body called Jesus Christ right he dwelt with them living in a human body so he was dwelling with them but he says he shall be in you and that happened when on the day of Pentecost that's right and after after the day of Pentecost we we read where where we we just read it he Ephesians 4 and 6 where Paul tells us who is the one inside of us the one God and Father of us all can you say man so the comforter is the one God and Father of us all and the comforter is the Holy Ghost ain't that right so if this is correct if all these scriptures are correct the Holy Ghost which is the comforter the spirit of Truth is the one God and Father of all and he is above all through all and in you all ain't that right so uh Jesus goes on to say in John 14 and 18 and uh let's see sister Lee said you want to read no don't want to read uh let's see sister Jane you want to read all right we'll I might have skipped Levi but we'll get you in a minute um John 14 and 18. through 20. I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you now just stop there what is he saying now he's the one that's going to be the comforter ain't that right amen so he the Holy Ghost he's the one he said I'm coming I'm the one that's going to come to you ain't that right I will not leave you comfortless but notice he Comforts us in a different way than just being with us ain't that right he comforted the disciples by being with them when the storms come he walked on the water he rode the boat and said peace be still when the sick was was uh uh died he's the one that come he was with them ain't that right but he doesn't come to us or Comfort Us by coming to us in his physical body in the physical body of Jesus Christ ain't that right all right sister Jane 19th verse 20. yet a little while in the world seeth me no more that ye see me because I live you shall live also at that day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you amen so Jesus is saying he is the comforter and it's in this day that the revelation strikes home that is not three Gods it's one God living in US ain't that right the same God that lived in Jesus Christ in that body now lives in us uh Colossians 1 27 Heather do you want to read that Colossians 1 27 this is Paul writing here to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory amen so who is it Christ in you well Jesus said that the the Holy Ghost which is the comforter will come and come to you right well then Paul is saying it's Christ in you so what is Christ Christ in you is the one God and Father of all above all through all and in you all ain't that right uh uh First Timothy 2 5 and um let's see sister hope you want to read this one first Timothy 2 and 5. for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus so it identifies who that one God is ain't that right there is one God everybody say one God one mediator between God and man now I know that just throws everybody up for a loop there's one God and one mediator between God and man the man Jesus Christ ain't that right now it's not saying he's another God we've already been talking that there's only one God and there's none else besides him ain't that right so God takes on another role and he becomes the mediator he takes on the judge and he takes on the lawyer he becomes judge he becomes a lawyer well it's the same thing he can become a lamb he can become the high priest he can become the Tabernacle he can become whatever he wants to become and if you look it's all this whole Bible the theme of it is Jesus Christ can you say Amen it's God taken on different roles amen so James 2 19 and uh uh brother Kevin you want to read this James 2 19. they'll believe us that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble so the devil's got a greater Revelation than a lot of these people around here not in just in the world general for it says the Devils believe that there's one God he's met him he was in heaven he didn't see no three gods he only dealt with one and that God kicked him out ain't that right so there is only one God it's the people that get confused the devil blinds them infuses them James um uh let's see here um Deuteronomy 4 and 39 Deuteronomy 4 and 39 and uh brother John do you want to read the scripture yeah John Deuteronomy 4 35 and 39. I hope this is okay tonight uh Deuteronomy 4 35 and 39. or hath God saved to go and take him a nation from the midst it's Deuteronomy 4 35 is it do you have that I might have wrote it down wrong unto thee it will show that the mightiest know that the Lord he is God and there is none else beside him and then the 39th verse note therefore this day and considered it in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above and above the Earth beneath and there is none else amen so think of that now the Lord everybody say the Lord he is God there's only we've already read it there's only one Lord ain't that right the Lord he is God and there is none else see why you don't need to go Seminary somehow they produces more than one God know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the Lord he is God in heaven right and upon the Earth beneath there is none else amen and you say man now this was in this was in Deuteronomy and he's saying the Lord is God in heaven and upon Earth could this before be foretelling of Jesus Christ coming upon the Earth amen amen that there's one God Amen in heaven and on upon the Earth beneath amen so so he's not changed for whatever he is in the heavens it ain't changed when it comes to the Earth ain't that right somehow people just get it all confused amen but if he's God in heaven when he comes to this earth and manifests himself he doesn't come in another person he comes as the same God one God ain't that right the Lord he is God acts 9 and 1 and Sister Kim Brumfield you want to read this amen acts 9 1-6 say one through six yes Acts 9 1 through 6. and so yet breathing out threatening us and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest now just stop there who now notice this Paul is breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of who the Lord one Lord right Okay so uh uh go ahead uh second verse and desire to him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecuted found me now right there now he he's the Bible just says he's going after the Lord right after the Disciples of the Lord and yet the voice is saying you're persecuting me ain't that right okay fifth verse and he said he said Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus and now persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what will they'll have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee with thou must too now he's talking to the the person that he's com that he is persecuting ain't that right and he says who art thou Lord is he talking to a different to a different Lord than what was of the of of the Old Testament we read that there was that there's only one Lord and there's none else besides him well Paul is is he's a scholar in the Old Testament uh teachings so he knows what Lord he's not saying Lords or which Lord are you he's addressing as there's only one Lord who art thou Lord he's he's not worried about okay now which one which Lord are you now so I can get this right no he only knows one Lord and he's approaching him as the one that he knows who art thou Lord and so this one Lord introduces himself to Paul as Jesus I am Jesus can you say Amen so now we know who the Lord really is he's the god of the Old Testament and there is none else and as we've been taught that Jehovah of the old is John Jesus of the new ain't that right uh First Kings 8 and 59 um my guy oh you can get the microphone now and uh First Kings 8 and 59 and um Mark Smith you want to read First Kings 8 and 59. through 60. 59 and 60. so now Paul is is is talking to the Lord he's persecuting the Disciples of the Lord and we find out that he's not just persecuting you see when you touch the children of God you're touching God himself and so he's he's uh after the disciples of the Lord ain't that right that's what the Bible says here breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord but we found out he was persecuting Jesus Christ by persecuting them and are you ready all right First Kings 8 59 and 60. and let these my words wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord be nigh unto the Lord Our God day and night that he maintained the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel at all times as the matter shall require that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God and that there is none else amen so that's Bible right so does the bible contradict itself or can we actually rest upon the Bible Old and New Testament you we should be able to rest upon the Bible on thus saith the Lord amen so so the Lord is God and there is none else ain't that right and Jesus as the Bible says was the in was the image of the invisible God the visible image of the invisible God that human body was the Tabernacle of God himself ain't that right amen so uh Isaiah 45 and 5 and uh brother Enoch you want to read uh all right Isaiah 45 and 5 through 7. amen this is a different um lesson it's not the King James version so well you you you you read it and then I'll give the uh King James translation oh okay so Isaiah 5 7 I create both light and darkness I bring both blessing and disaster I the Lord do all these things I will send Victory from the sky like rain the Earth will open to receive it and will Blossom with freedom and Justice I the Lord will make this happen amen so so here uh Isaiah 45 and 5 through 7. it says I'm going to read the King James translation I am the Lord everybody say I am the Lord and there is none else ain't that right now this is the Old Testament now so what Paul was persecuting was the same word of that of that Isaiah is talking about there is none else there is no God beside me I girded thee though thou Hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I mean he's really making that clear there's none besides him I am the lord and there is none else I form the light and create Darkness so he's the Creator I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things ain't that right so in the beginning God created heavens and earth so we now know it's the Lord that created the heavens and earth the same God that Paul or that Saul persecuted in the New Testament and was introduced as Jesus ain't that right Isaiah 45 and 18. praise the Lord amen brother Bill do you want to read this one as well Isaiah 45 and 18. for thus saith the Lord that created the heavens God himself that formed the Earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the lord and there is none else none else none else aren't you glad for that so again we'd read in Ephesians 4 5 it tells us that there is one Lord amen so Genesis 2 and 4 I'm just going to skip through this because Genesis 2 and 4 tells us that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens the seventh verse of Genesis 2 tells us that the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground the eighth verse and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in the uh in the garden ain't that right so all throughout the second chapter of Genesis tells us that it was the Lord God Amen the Lord God and then from there your your you read scriptures after scriptures that tells us there's only one Lord there's only one God and it's not just in the Old Testament it's in the New Testament as well ain't that right Isaiah 40 and 1 through 3. brother Terry do you want to read that one for us Isaiah 41 and 1 through 3. Isaiah 41-3 40 and one yes sir 40 verse 1. yes not 41. right right sorry my fault okay Comfort ye Comfort ye my people saith your God speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her Warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for her sins through and then third verse the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God Amen so here there's a voice that's crying prepare ye the way of who the Lord which Lord one Lord the Lord that created the heavens and the Earth ain't that right now there's going to be somebody come on the scene to prepare the way for him amen that's right same Lord now Malachi 3 1 and brother Amos you want to read that for us Malachi 3 1. behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me in the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts so what is the scripture prophesying of the coming Messiah ain't that right and who was the Messiah Jesus the Lord shall suddenly the Lord shall suddenly come to his Temple amen so the Lord is prophesying of his own coming and John the Baptist was the messenger to prepare the way you believe that well let's look John 1 19. amen John 1 19 uh let's see I didn't even get brother Jr or sister Brooke praise the Lord bro June you want to read this one amen John 1 19 through 23. and this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ and they asked him what then art thou Elias and he saith I am not art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that send us what sayeth thou of thyself he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah's amen so he wasn't that Prophet which they they were referring to the Messiah or thou the Messiah that Prophet for the Messiah was to be a prophet ain't that right but he says no I am the voice I am that voice of one in the wilderness crying out prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight the way of the Lord amen so Luke 1 76 and sister Jane you want to read this one Luke 1 76 and thou shalt be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before the face of the Lord and prepare his ways amen so here and thou child speaking of John the Baptist shall be called the prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go before what the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ain't that right now if you want to go to Philippians 2 and 9 and uh sister Brooke do you want to read that one through 11 Philippians 2 9 through 11 this is speaking of Jesus thank you amen wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen so who is Lord Jesus Christ who did John prepare the face of Jesus Christ he prepared the way was Jesus Christ ain't that right amen so uh then you look at Romans 14 11. and uh Josiah you want to read this one Romans 14 11. oops I forgot Mindy too he's hiding back there is what you're doing so Romans 14 11 . so we just read that Jesus Christ is Lord for it is written as I live as I live as I live as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God Amen so who's going to ever need is going to bow to who Jesus Christ now it says as I live saith the Lord ever and he shall bow to me and we just read that Jesus Christ is Lord and there's only one Lord ain't that right so we look as well as Zechariah 14 and 9. and I hope this is a help to you someone anyways but Zechariah 14 and 9 and uh don't see Brittany back there she's really hiding uh uh oh sister Melissa I forgot sister by goodness well see she's just hiding in plain sight you want to read this uh Zechariah 14 and 9. thought she'd get out of it and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth in that day shall there be one Lord at his name one amen and the Lord shall be what King over all the Earth and in that day there shall be one Lord and his name one you know that Revelation is going to strike home and everybody's going to know will be one one can you say Amen John 1 29 and sister Mindy you want to read this John 1 29 and 36. John 1 29 and also 36. the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world and this 36th verse and looking Upon Jesus as he walked to seeth Behold the Lamb of God Amen so who's the Lamb of God Jesus that's right so I think we could all agree to that Revelation 17 14. Amen brother Kevin you want to read this one Revelation 17 and 14. these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful amen so we John introduced the lamb to us Jesus Christ ain't that right and these are going to make war with the lamb amen and the lamb shall overcome them why for he is Lord of lords he's King of Kings ain't that right above all through all and in all Amen in you all that's what he says in you all ain't that right so so the father was in the son John 14 7 if you want to turn there and brother John you want to read this uh John 14 7 through 11. oh I didn't get Faith either well we get you next also uh and don't don't have that excited look and you're in the next if you had no if he had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him have seen him Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it's a sufficient us suffice the sufficeiveness she just said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet has thou not know me Philip he said that has seen me has seen the father and how saith thou then show us the father I believe it's thou amount that I am in the father and the father in me and the words I'm speaking to you I speak not to myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth thee Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for he he the very Works sake amen so who was in the Sun the father amen one God and Father above all through all and in you all amen Faith second Corinthians 5 19. to with that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not in putting their trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation amen so God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself first Timothy 3 16 and Judah I know I couldn't see your head but I knew he was back there First Timothy 3 16. and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seeing of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received it into Glory amen so without controversy everybody say without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh God was justified in the spirit God was seen of angels God preached unto the Gentiles God believed on in the world and God received up into Glory can you say Amen amen see so Jesus said the father was in him Paul says it was God that was in Christ he also said God manifested In the Flesh and received up into glory and great is the mystery of godliness ain't that right if we just a few more scriptures and then we'll close Isaiah 43 and 3 and um um Heather you want to read this Isaiah 43 3 and 11. for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for the I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior so who is he he's our savior he's the Lord he's our savior and there's none other ain't that right for he said beside me there is no savior all right Isaiah 45 and 21 brother Branson you want to read this 45 Isaiah 45 21-23 here yay let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who had told it from that time who not have not I the lord and there is no God else besides me a just God and a savior there's none beside me 22 and 23. look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else I've sworn by myself the word has gone out of my mouth and righteousness and shall not return that that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall answer or shall swear amen so every knee is going to bow to God and savior and his name is Jesus Christ Jesus said I come in my father's name ain't that right all right Isaiah 49 and 26 uh and everybody wanted to make sure you got in this thing so Isaiah 49 and 26 . and I will feed them that oppressed thee with their own flesh and they that shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and All Flesh shall know that I the Lord and thy Savior and thy Redeemer the mighty one of Jacob amen All Flesh All Flesh shall know ain't that right there's going to come a time that everyone's going to recognize what we know already and I am so glad that we know it now and we don't have to wait until some other time amen when it's too late but all flesh is going to know he says that I am the Lord am I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer all right Hosea 13 and 4 Daniel you want to read this Hosea 13 and 4. man these boys are doing a good job they think so too Hosea 13 and 4. yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt and thou shalt know no God but me for there is no savior beside me amen so God had established himself in in the Old Testament to Israel that there is no other God and that's what he's been drawn to do for the Gentiles is to know there is no other God besides him and there's no other savior ain't that right now acts 5 and 30 uh sister Anna you want to read this acts 5 30 through 31. the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you slew and hanged on a tree him that God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins amen so it tells us who's the savior the god of our fathers raised up who Jesus whom you slew and hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior what was it God in Christ reconciling the world to himself ain't that right all right do we have a little bit more time Philippians 3 20. sister Alice you want to read this Philippians 3 20. for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ so who's who's the one we're looking forward to the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we've been blessed because the Jews only know one God one Savior and they're still looking for him right they don't believe that Jesus Christ is the savior they don't believe that he that that he he was God they believe good man or whatever but we've been given that revelation of who he is so now we're not just looking for God we're looking for the god the Lord Jesus Christ ain't that right amen so we we find uh um acts 13 and 23. uh brother will you want to read this acts 13 23. hmm of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus amen now this man's seat hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a savior Jesus amen First Timothy 1 1. uh says Crystal do you want to read this one first Timothy 1 1. you love the Lord yeah or an apostle of Jesus Christ by the Commandment of God our savior the Lord Jesus Christ which is Our Hope amen so it's our savior the the Jews rejected him they didn't want nothing to do with it ain't that right but God promised that out of the Gentiles he would get a people for his name's sake he's our savior amen the Lord Jesus Christ I love the Lord First Timothy 2 and 2 and I'll just read it but he says through 3 for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God to our Savior so who is it the Lord Jesus Christ amen uh look uh first Timothy 4 and 10. um the Sister Kim Broomfield you want to read this First Timothy 4 and 10. for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe amen so who is the Living God the savior of all men not a living God not another Living God the Living God I think we all know that there's one God amen especially of those that believe praise the Lord isn't the Lord wonderful amen second Timothy 1 9 brother Junior do you want to read this first second Timothy 1 9 through 10. who hath saved us and called us with a with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel amen all do you love him Titus 1 and 4 to Titus my own son after the common Faith grace mercy and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior amen so telling you who it all is God from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior he's not introducing to gods it's one God can you say Amen the Lord Jesus Christ is our father and our savior amen if we want to tide us to a nine and um um brother Amos if you want to read that 2 9-13 praise the Lord Titus 2 9 through 13. exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them will hold things not answering again not prayer loaning but showing all good fidelity that they may Adorn the doctrine of God or savior in all things for the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared unto all men to teaching us that denying ungodliness a world and lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope glorious appearing of the great God in Our Savior Jesus Christ amen so that they may Adorn the doctrine of God our savior right and then they're in that 13th verse looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our savior who Jesus Christ amen I love the Lord Titus 3 and 3 through 6 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lust and Pleasures living in Malice and in the hateful and hating one another but after the kind after that the kindness and the love of God our savior uh toward a man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior not two saviors there's only one savior the Lord Jesus Christ first John 4 14 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world one more Jude 25. to the only wise God can you say that with me to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen oh the Lord is good amen if maybe uh we could just have a song oh how I love him oh how I love him how I adore thank you buddy my breath my sunshine my all in all the great create creator became my savior [Music] and all God's fullness dwellers in him sing that again oh how I love him do you love him how I adore him my breath my sunshine my all in all all the great creator became my savior and all gods fullness dwell is in him amen he is so wonderful if you'd like to turn with me to First Corinthians we could just stand to our feet and as we get ready to take communion communion is a a sacred thing an honorable thing that we would take by commandment of Our Lord and we know and realize that only those that are filled with the Holy Ghost you must as the the scriptures require and the prophet has taught us that the Holy Ghost demand needs to have the Holy Ghost in order to take this because it's it's a partaking uh it's a symbol a partaking of our Lord and his word his spirit and of course we know what the wine represents it's his blood we do not take juice um uh as maybe others do they they use grape juice or whatever but we know that that's that can sour that can spoil but wine is a representation because it does not spoil and um and so we we use wine Jesus used wine uh but it represents his blood it is not the blood of the Lord as some would think it they can have the power to change it into the blood but it is symbolic of the blood and we take the bread as in symbolic to the word of God but it is not the body of Christ but it is symbolic amen so First Corinthians the 11th chapter and the 23rd verse we'll start there but it says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed it took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup when he had suped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you drink or as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eat us and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would be judged or if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if you any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and I the rest well I said in order when I come and so we know that Isaiah believed the prophet talked about uh the tables being full of vomit and and uh these things and here you know uh with all of their man-made doctrines and people living just any way they want to live and and not according to the word of God and you know uh they're holding on to traditions and Creeds and you got people smoking and drinking and gambling and swearing and committing adultery and uh just so wrapped up in Hollywood and and all of these things and then they come taking the Lord's supper and it has no meaning no value in what they're doing but we are to to do this in remembrance of the Lord remembrance of what he has done remembrance of what he is and who he is and what he is to us a man he saved us he redeemed us he he bought us with the price ain't that right and and we're partaking of this uh as a symbol that we're partaking in fellowship with Jesus Christ and you know of course we we're all Sinners and when I say that we we're failures we we make mistakes and all of these things but it's it's something that we've read and many times where we don't do it and if we do sin we have a covenant we have a uh uh an intercessor an atonement a man that that when we repent of these sins the blood is there to cover a saint that Ryan and so we come boldly uh not not irreverently but we come boldly partaking of these things knowing in our hearts that that all of our sins are under the blood and and that we're not doing this in a mockery in in spite but we're really taking God in a serious way amen so uh if there's anything in your heart that that needs to be made right amen I I think it this is this is the time to do it if we never if we ever need to get sincere this is the time to say Lord I I want to be more sincere than I ever have if you've been playing games don't play games with God Amen so let's just bow our heads and you you just talk to the Lord in your own heart and then we'll pray father as we approach this sacred time lord it's an honor to be able to take these Lords as our heart is yearning for you Lord and how we love just to sit at your feet Lord and just to partake of your words for your words are life Lord we have the ticket in our hand the token has been applied father we're living off of you Lord for your spirit and life and Lord we're doing this in remembrance of what you've done at Calvary Lord You're our savior Our Redeemer we have fallen in love with you no matter how long ago it was that we gave our hearts to you lord it's a continual thing with this father every day we just want to fall in love with you over and over if there's any sins Lord that is not covered by your blood we pray that you'd forgive us of them Lord that your blood would atone for us father help us Lord to be more sincere than we ever have help us Lord to deny the world Lord our habits father things Lord that has been trying and testing us and whatever it would be help us just to deny them and cut it all off that we may serve you holy we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord you can be seated here and
