[43:08] and we need him don't we
[43:11] amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn
[43:14] to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter
[43:20] amen
[43:23] Hebrews the 11th
[43:26] chapter and we're going to read the
[43:28] sixth verse
[43:30] praise the Lord
[43:35] and before we go into the word may we
[43:37] just bow our heads and
[43:40] talk to her Lord
[43:42] father
[43:45] we're so glad that
[43:47] we serve a living Christ and
[43:50] that our experience isn't
[43:53] a yesterday experience it isn't
[43:57] something of history but it's a
[43:59] continuing
[44:00] every day Lord that we're walking with
[44:03] you we're experiencing you in a
[44:07] a different way on another level
[44:11] and father we're so glad Lord that you
[44:15] just keep revealing yourself and it just
[44:17] causes us to love you more
[44:20] Lord the times that we fail and you pick
[44:23] us back up
[44:25] we just fall in love with you more
[44:27] father and
[44:29] I pray Lord that you would just be with
[44:31] us this evening as we would Endeavor to
[44:34] preach the gospel
[44:36] and I pray Lord that you would take the
[44:38] simple words that I have and just let it
[44:42] go in deep into the Heart Lord and that
[44:45] we would be better Christians father we
[44:48] we not hear just to waste time of seeing
[44:52] one another and hearing each other sing
[44:55] Lord everything that we do is for your
[44:58] glory and to honor you
[45:00] and oh God may you just feel welcome now
[45:03] and and just do a creative work in our
[45:06] hearts Lord it's our prayer may your
[45:09] spirit just settle down upon the
[45:12] building Lord and every pew
[45:15] father and and just touch your people we
[45:19] ask these things in your gracious name
[45:22] Jesus Christ amen
[45:25] Hebrews the 11th chapter in the sixth
[45:28] verse it says but without faith
[45:31] it is impossible to please him
[45:34] for he that cometh to God must believe
[45:37] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[45:39] them that diligently seek him
[45:42] amen you can have your seeds
[45:47] without faith
[45:49] faith of course is the is the key key
[45:52] ingredients
[45:54] I believe uh for anything of the
[45:58] Christian walk
[45:59] you you must have faith
[46:02] and
[46:05] Love worketh by faith everything works
[46:09] by faith
[46:10] now I'm going to use the title again
[46:13] that we use last Sunday evening and
[46:15] that's meditating on the positive
[46:18] and
[46:20] Philippians 4 and 8 we know this very
[46:23] scripture well but it says finally
[46:26] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[46:30] whatsoever things are honest
[46:32] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[46:36] things are pure
[46:37] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[46:40] things are of good report
[46:42] if there be any virtue
[46:45] if there be any praise
[46:47] think
[46:49] on these things
[46:51] so of course I I believe that this is
[46:56] showing that we we must be able to
[46:59] discern
[47:00] uh what is good and what's bad and and I
[47:04] think our whole Christian Life
[47:06] it it's it takes discernment
[47:09] and and so we must know what is good
[47:13] what's a virtue what's what's of
[47:17] strength what things are honest what
[47:19] things are pure what things are just
[47:22] what things are of a good report
[47:25] what things have virtue have praise and
[47:29] these are the things that we are to
[47:30] think on
[47:32] so so
[47:33] we we we must Cipher through things a
[47:38] man and now Paul is speaking to the
[47:41] church here there in in really I guess
[47:44] both both uh uh Scriptures it was Paul
[47:48] writing and and the church is made up of
[47:52] people who have a new birth
[47:55] and uh they have been baptized into one
[47:59] body by one spirit
[48:01] and so uh the church that's what
[48:07] separates people uh that are part of the
[48:10] church
[48:11] uh from everyone else is they've
[48:14] received that new birth
[48:17] by the spirit of God
[48:19] and so uh this is what Paul is speaking
[48:22] of and speaking to and so God has a law
[48:27] uh that man must live by his church must
[48:33] live by
[48:34] and and so uh and if he lives by that
[48:37] law then it will actually work for him
[48:42] and and so I know of unconverted men
[48:46] that have practiced the principles of
[48:50] the Bible they have put the principles
[48:52] of God's law to work and it's it's
[48:55] actually been fruitful for them in in
[48:59] ways
[49:00] um I I believe it you know our military
[49:03] has has or I've heard of military using
[49:07] uh scriptures and and applying that to
[49:11] military strategy and and it has worked
[49:15] for them uh we have found that even
[49:18] businessmen uh apply uh you know have
[49:23] applied the laws of God and it's worked
[49:27] for them and and their their the laws of
[49:30] God work ain't that right
[49:33] and so uh but you know I believe that
[49:37] the Bible even though it is has an
[49:41] effect for everyone in in to a certain
[49:43] degree but I I believe that the Bible
[49:47] was written for for the Believers uh the
[49:50] children of God the Church of God and
[49:54] um and and so and and if the church will
[49:58] walk according to God's law I believe
[50:01] they will have more success than what an
[50:06] average person would using the
[50:08] scriptures I because I believe that they
[50:12] they have the spirit of God within them
[50:15] and and if the word is written to the
[50:19] bride of Christ to the church uh because
[50:22] really Brown said it is a love letter
[50:24] it's it's there then they will actually
[50:27] get the results that the promises are
[50:30] intended for I tended to have
[50:33] and so I believe that tonight I am
[50:36] speaking to uh Christians and Christians
[50:40] believe the word of God and so I I
[50:43] believe that you you believe the word of
[50:46] God tonight
[50:47] and so
[50:49] um uh now the world teaches uh positive
[50:53] thinking and and yet while all along
[50:57] denying uh the word of God and and and
[51:01] there there is a degree of being
[51:05] positive in the natural
[51:07] but uh and and that may be okay but it
[51:11] has its limits
[51:12] and there are you know certain people
[51:14] that you I'm sure all of us have met
[51:17] that uh maybe don't even know the Lord
[51:20] don't don't claim to know the Lord but
[51:22] yet they're positive they they're just
[51:25] upbeat they have this positive attitude
[51:27] about everything you know and and you
[51:30] think man that's that's nice and and uh
[51:34] and yet they don't even claim to know
[51:36] God or anything but there is a
[51:39] positiveness about them and they they
[51:42] have that positive attitude and and I
[51:45] you know I I think it's good to be
[51:48] positive I I just believe that you don't
[51:51] you know it's it's tough being around
[51:53] someone that's always negative and
[51:55] talking negative and thinking negative
[51:58] and acting negative and and uh you know
[52:02] it's it's just
[52:03] um because brother random says that we
[52:06] all create an atmosphere
[52:08] yeah we every one of us is a Creator and
[52:11] you can either create a depressing
[52:13] attitude or an atmosphere of depression
[52:17] of of just Doom and Gloom or you can
[52:21] create a positive attitude an atmosphere
[52:26] that's right well if if the unbeliever
[52:30] has that and and
[52:33] well I I just tend to think that every
[52:36] Christian
[52:38] ought to be positive
[52:40] and and even though that may go against
[52:43] your nature
[52:45] yet there is a spirit of God that's in
[52:48] US
[52:50] the spirit of God is positive do you
[52:53] believe that when it comes to promises
[52:55] the spirit of God is Promised is
[52:57] positive when it comes to the word of
[53:00] God the spirit of God is positive
[53:02] there's well brother Brown said there's
[53:05] nothing negative in Christianity there's
[53:08] nothing and and so we're not talking of
[53:11] positive thinking in the way the world
[53:13] would think about that but we are
[53:16] talking about positive because if you
[53:18] have the Holy Ghost again then you you
[53:22] you you have to be positive again you
[53:26] say bad you have to be positive now you
[53:29] know uh in the natural all of us are
[53:32] given five senses
[53:35] um and and
[53:37] um and you know these are senses are
[53:40] given to us by God to help us get along
[53:43] in the world and uh and by these five
[53:46] senses we can be positive
[53:49] it it actually there's to a certain
[53:51] degree we can actually be positive I am
[53:54] positive I am positive that you're here
[53:56] tonight
[53:58] and I'm positive by that because I see
[54:01] you my eyes declare that you're here
[54:04] and not only that my ears
[54:08] declare that you are here at least some
[54:11] of you
[54:13] because I hear you amenity
[54:15] or chocolate rosam's here
[54:18] and so uh uh but but these senses help
[54:23] us
[54:23] to become positive uh to you know taste
[54:27] is positive right
[54:30] um uh you you can uh you know you you
[54:34] can eat a uh macaroni and cheese and and
[54:38] you you don't even have to you know you
[54:41] don't have to see it you don't have to
[54:42] feel it just taste it
[54:44] and I guarantee you
[54:46] you know if it's you know uh uh macaroni
[54:50] and cheese I would anyways you know but
[54:53] but it it becomes positive you can tell
[54:56] the difference just through taste
[54:58] whether it's orange juice or apple juice
[54:59] you can tell the difference because the
[55:02] your sense of taste
[55:04] uh declares to you what is the
[55:07] difference
[55:08] and you can be so positive about it
[55:10] right that you don't have to see it just
[55:13] just take a dream
[55:14] amen and someone can question about well
[55:17] how do you know well I know because I
[55:19] tasted it in my my taste bud declares
[55:23] what it is
[55:24] see and and so then hearing is positive
[55:27] as well you can tell the difference
[55:29] between an organ and a piano
[55:31] at least most of us can I guess and and
[55:34] when you hear in the piano you say oh I
[55:37] like that piano
[55:38] you know you you could even hear it on a
[55:40] tape and and you know you don't have to
[55:43] see it you don't have to but you can
[55:45] recognize it by by your hearing and you
[55:49] can become so positive about about it
[55:51] that you just automatic say man that's a
[55:53] that's a good piano player or horrible
[55:55] you know whatever but but you identify
[55:58] it as being a a piano or an organ or
[56:02] whatever because you're able to tell the
[56:04] difference feeling is positive you know
[56:07] I I've thought of reading the story of
[56:10] Fanny Crosby that could not see and yet
[56:13] uh she learned to by feeling a certain
[56:17] leave she could take a leaf you can give
[56:19] a relief and she would feel it and she
[56:21] could tell you what tree that leaf came
[56:24] from
[56:24] my feeling just feeling but she would
[56:28] become so positive to that and and so
[56:31] smell is positive
[56:33] um of certain things you know you you
[56:36] don't have to say it that way before you
[56:38] see it you can say boy that's cigarette
[56:39] smell you know someone's smoking a
[56:41] cigarette well why because the smell of
[56:45] that thing is it declares to you what it
[56:48] is and you become positive I I remember
[56:52] you know or I don't remember dad
[56:54] remembers you know Mom and and we I was
[56:56] just a little guy and we was at a
[56:58] restaurant and someone was smoking and
[56:59] dad says man Jolene someone's smoking
[57:02] somewheres and I just got up and looked
[57:05] around and it was the next door guy and
[57:07] I said here he is right here Dad he's
[57:10] the one that's smoking sit down son you
[57:12] know uh but but I've Vindicated what he
[57:15] was smelling you know but he declared it
[57:18] before he ever saw it see and and so
[57:21] these senses but yet our senses are
[57:25] limited
[57:26] and our senses can play tricks on us too
[57:29] ain't that right they can play tricks
[57:31] and and so Satan will actually use our
[57:36] senses against us
[57:38] ain't that right to calls it to declare
[57:41] something that ain't there
[57:44] now if if you can you know because he
[57:46] will use our senses to doubt God's word
[57:49] ain't that right
[57:50] and then when Satan starts getting a
[57:53] hold of our senses and then he starts
[57:57] getting us to become negative toward
[58:00] God's word ain't that right it's it's
[58:03] unbelief is is what it is see in a
[58:06] negative way then when the doctor says
[58:09] you know uh you you're sick you know or
[58:13] uh there's you're gonna die and well you
[58:18] know you you just heard that and and if
[58:21] you're not careful Satan will play on
[58:24] that and before you know it you become
[58:26] so positive that you're gonna die
[58:30] you you you because you heard what the
[58:34] doctor said you heard the bad report
[58:36] ain't that right and and you become
[58:39] positive in a negative way
[58:42] you get sick you get um you know
[58:45] whatever some things happen and you know
[58:49] maybe uh uh you're seeing just uh and
[58:53] and things just keep coming and coming
[58:55] and like they say when it rains it pours
[58:59] and and before you know it you you
[59:01] become negative so negative that you
[59:05] don't think you'll ever make it through
[59:08] it right yeah and so so what we hear
[59:12] sometimes is not always true what we
[59:15] hear sometimes is not always Akron what
[59:18] we hear what we see it's it's it's these
[59:22] things so uh uh you know you you brother
[59:26] Branham even talked about it of how that
[59:28] maybe you'll see someone or hear someone
[59:31] or of someone praying they're sick and
[59:33] they're praying to get well and they're
[59:35] believing I'm uh you know they they
[59:37] confess and then they get sick and then
[59:39] they die
[59:40] and and then you get sick and then it's
[59:43] comes time for you to accept your
[59:45] healing brother Brown said Satan will
[59:47] come to you and and and show it to you
[59:49] and then all of a sudden you start
[59:51] remembering well I remember so and so
[59:53] how they confess their healing and how
[59:56] they prayed for healing and they died
[59:58] right and before you know it it begins
[1:00:01] to affect you
[1:00:02] so you you can't always be led by your
[1:00:06] senses your five senses ain't that right
[1:00:09] so we we find that
[1:00:13] um uh being positive uh must be based on
[1:00:18] the word of God you do not walk with by
[1:00:22] your five senses you don't walk with God
[1:00:24] by your five senses these these five
[1:00:26] senses are Earthly they are to help you
[1:00:29] get along in life ain't that right but
[1:00:32] you are not to be led by your five
[1:00:36] senses
[1:00:37] ain't that right see you you cannot we
[1:00:41] we cannot claim our healing by our five
[1:00:43] senses we cannot claim our salvation by
[1:00:47] our five senses we cannot claim uh uh
[1:00:51] our deliverance by our five senses you
[1:00:54] you cannot even claim the Rapture by
[1:00:56] your five senses can you say Amen
[1:00:58] because see the promises of God can only
[1:01:02] be positive by faith
[1:01:05] ain't that right and that's what we read
[1:01:07] now without faith
[1:01:09] you can go you can go out well you can
[1:01:12] go without all your five senses but
[1:01:13] without faith you can't please God
[1:01:18] you you don't have to have the sense of
[1:01:20] sight to please God
[1:01:21] but you have to have faith
[1:01:24] ain't that right these five senses can
[1:01:26] go uh uh but but Faith a man is what
[1:01:30] pleases God and if you notice uh Jesus
[1:01:34] said all things everybody say all things
[1:01:36] are possible to them
[1:01:40] that have good smell
[1:01:43] or that God have good hearing
[1:01:45] no it's by faith all things are possible
[1:01:50] to them that believe
[1:01:52] so that tells us that faith is a sense
[1:01:55] brother Branham called it the sixth
[1:01:57] sense and it's Superior than any other
[1:02:00] sins
[1:02:02] can you say man
[1:02:03] now so so we we find that in Hebrews 6
[1:02:07] and 12 Paul tells us to be followers of
[1:02:11] them who through faith and patience
[1:02:15] everybody say faith and patience
[1:02:18] inherit the promises
[1:02:20] not by your senses not by how you feel
[1:02:23] not by by what you see not by what you
[1:02:27] hear but by faith and patience they
[1:02:31] inherit the promises of God
[1:02:35] and and we are to be followers of them
[1:02:38] ain't that right so you cannot get in
[1:02:41] you can't get anywhere in God without
[1:02:44] faith
[1:02:45] that's right for faith is positive and
[1:02:49] it's more positive than anything else
[1:02:54] ain't that right
[1:02:55] your eyes will play tricks on you
[1:02:58] you're you're hearing will play tricks
[1:03:00] on you to what you think you heard it
[1:03:03] and maybe you really didn't hear it
[1:03:05] everything can play tricks on you
[1:03:08] ain't that right because Satan it's it's
[1:03:11] of the carnal man and this old carnal
[1:03:14] man is not regenerated
[1:03:16] your soul is regenerated
[1:03:18] ain't that right that's right and if you
[1:03:22] don't have a control tower down in your
[1:03:24] soul a man Satan can have Heyday with
[1:03:28] the five senses of the Flesh and he can
[1:03:30] have Heyday with the five senses of your
[1:03:33] your spirit
[1:03:34] which is memory conscience affection
[1:03:38] uh the other two uh reasoning and and
[1:03:42] and these things so so but faith is is
[1:03:46] based upon the word of God and as we
[1:03:50] talked about last Sunday the word of God
[1:03:52] never fails
[1:03:54] Heaven and Earth will pass away but my
[1:03:56] word will never pass away
[1:03:58] ain't that right so then God wants us
[1:04:02] his church a man to be founded upon the
[1:04:06] word of God that cannot fail
[1:04:10] ain't that right so then as the prophet
[1:04:13] says when when your your five senses
[1:04:16] disagree with the word stay with faith
[1:04:18] and ignore your five senses when when
[1:04:22] the spirit your senses of your spirit
[1:04:24] ignores the word and gets away from the
[1:04:26] word ignore that and ignore all of that
[1:04:29] and stay with the word of God
[1:04:31] ain't that right yes sir see so because
[1:04:35] faith is positive because it's founded
[1:04:38] upon the word of God now brother Brown
[1:04:41] said faith is the only direct and
[1:04:43] positive sense and it's the Sixth Sense
[1:04:47] faith is more positive than sight
[1:04:50] faith is more positive than feeling you
[1:04:54] do not feel Faith you do not taste Faith
[1:04:57] you do not smell Faith you don't see
[1:05:00] Faith but yet faith is the substance of
[1:05:04] things hoped for and the evidence of
[1:05:07] things uh not seen ain't that right
[1:05:09] faith is so now now Faith what is Faith
[1:05:14] the prophet said faith is knowing faith
[1:05:17] is knowing if you're hoping that's not
[1:05:19] faith if you're wishing that's not Faith
[1:05:21] you know I want to be a Christian that's
[1:05:24] not Faith well I I really you know I'm I
[1:05:28] want to be healed that's not faith I'm
[1:05:30] really you wishing you know I'm hoping
[1:05:32] I'm you know I'm I'm uh uh you know
[1:05:35] wanting to be in the Rapture but that's
[1:05:37] not Faith see faith is knowing
[1:05:42] everybody say faith is knowing
[1:05:45] faith is knowing so so when you have
[1:05:49] faith you know it's it's settled it's
[1:05:53] done
[1:05:55] it's a finished thing
[1:05:58] that's Faith ain't that right
[1:06:00] so if you have faith and you know beyond
[1:06:03] any Shadow of Doubt amen so faith is
[1:06:07] beyond what you see feel hear smell
[1:06:09] taste it is more positive than any of
[1:06:12] those things now I read to you and I'll
[1:06:15] I'll put it up on the screen but Hebrews
[1:06:17] 11 1 it says now now read it with me now
[1:06:22] Faith is the substance
[1:06:25] what substance of things hoped for
[1:06:30] say that again faith is the substance of
[1:06:34] things hoped for
[1:06:36] faith
[1:06:38] is the substance
[1:06:40] of what you are hoping for
[1:06:44] and you say Amen so without faith you
[1:06:47] don't have substance
[1:06:49] but if you have faith and you have the
[1:06:51] substance
[1:06:52] ain't that right you want healing faith
[1:06:56] is the substance you want Deliverance
[1:06:58] faith is the substance you you you want
[1:07:02] your hearing to get better faith is the
[1:07:04] substance you want to be healed of
[1:07:07] arthritis faith is the substance you
[1:07:09] want to be healed of heart disease faith
[1:07:11] is the substance can you say amen that's
[1:07:15] right see uh uh uh so so you want the
[1:07:18] Holy Ghost faith is the substance if you
[1:07:21] want an apple tree the apple seed is the
[1:07:25] substance of what you're looking for
[1:07:28] ain't that right amen yes sir if you
[1:07:31] want a loaf of bread the money that's in
[1:07:33] your pocket is the substance of what
[1:07:36] you're looking for
[1:07:38] that's right and then when you've got
[1:07:40] the substancy well then what what do you
[1:07:43] have you already have it
[1:07:47] ain't that right if you want corn but
[1:07:50] all you have is is the seed well it's in
[1:07:54] your hand then you have the substance in
[1:07:56] your hand
[1:07:57] so in all reality you have the corn that
[1:08:01] you're looking for
[1:08:02] amen it's the substance
[1:08:05] ain't that right so then as the prophet
[1:08:08] said you can be just as happy that you
[1:08:10] have the corn
[1:08:11] having the substance as you would the
[1:08:14] crop
[1:08:15] why because the seed is the substance of
[1:08:19] the crop you're looking for so you
[1:08:23] cannot have anything from God without
[1:08:26] faith
[1:08:27] amen look at all the the miraculous
[1:08:30] things that happened in the Old
[1:08:32] Testament and in the in in the New
[1:08:34] Testament but looking at the Old
[1:08:36] Testament Paul tells us how it was it
[1:08:39] was by faith that the Jericho walls came
[1:08:42] down
[1:08:43] it was by faith a man that that Sarah
[1:08:48] received life it was by faith a man that
[1:08:52] now that Shem sham guard was able to
[1:08:55] defeat the enemy it was by faith that
[1:08:57] Gideon was able to bring Israel a man
[1:09:00] into victory over the enemy it was by
[1:09:03] faith
[1:09:05] ain't ain't that right see by faith the
[1:09:08] Hebrew boys escaped the fiery furnace by
[1:09:12] faith
[1:09:13] and that same faith is here tonight
[1:09:17] ain't that right so you you can't look
[1:09:20] at them maybe they're Our Heroes but
[1:09:22] they're not super men they're not super
[1:09:24] women they are literally women and men
[1:09:28] just like you are that have the same
[1:09:30] faith that you have
[1:09:34] by faith the Bible says Abraham
[1:09:37] considered not the deadness of of
[1:09:40] Sarah's womb he he not he uh uh he he
[1:09:44] considered not his own body now dead
[1:09:47] ain't that right because he had the
[1:09:50] substance of the promise he was looking
[1:09:53] for
[1:09:55] by faith ain't that right see so Faith
[1:09:59] gives us a it causes us to act
[1:10:02] differently it causes us to think
[1:10:04] differently it causes us to speak
[1:10:07] differently because it's the substance
[1:10:09] of things hoped for
[1:10:12] ain't that right
[1:10:13] so we we find that Abraham rejoiced he
[1:10:18] praised God he made confession before he
[1:10:21] saw any sign of physical evidence
[1:10:25] hello my I think that's powerful amen
[1:10:29] you know brother Branham would tell us
[1:10:31] how Abraham maybe go to Sarah you know
[1:10:34] every morning how are you feeling Sarah
[1:10:36] well no different we'll praise God we're
[1:10:38] having it anyhow
[1:10:39] amen he had the booties made he had
[1:10:42] everything ready for that baby
[1:10:45] and yet he didn't know when it was
[1:10:46] coming but that didn't matter time did
[1:10:49] not matter to Abraham because he already
[1:10:52] had the substance
[1:10:57] can you say amen he already had the
[1:11:00] substance so as far as he was concerned
[1:11:03] it was already done
[1:11:05] yes sir ain't that right amen see so so
[1:11:10] then we find now faith faith is founded
[1:11:14] on a different knowledge than what our
[1:11:16] senses are founded upon
[1:11:18] the doctor tells you you know that
[1:11:20] you're going to die with cancer to
[1:11:22] tuberculosis or whatever see and and and
[1:11:26] uh well he gave you a knowledge
[1:11:30] and by that you heard that with your the
[1:11:33] hearing of your ear
[1:11:35] and and now you whatever choice you have
[1:11:39] the choice of what you're going to do
[1:11:40] with that knowledge
[1:11:42] but that knowledge did not come from the
[1:11:44] word of God that knowledge came from
[1:11:47] medical learning it came from scientific
[1:11:49] knowledge ain't that right see and so
[1:11:53] therefore and now now for him
[1:11:56] scientifically and medically he's done
[1:11:58] everything he can for you and so uh uh
[1:12:02] uh with that if there's no medical to
[1:12:05] help you if there's no science to help
[1:12:07] you or whatever then then as far as he
[1:12:11] is concerned you're a lost hopeless case
[1:12:14] you're a lost cause you're it's over
[1:12:16] with ain't that right amen but yeah
[1:12:19] we've heard testimony after testimony of
[1:12:22] people with stage four cancer that was
[1:12:25] dying that that couldn't even eat
[1:12:27] anymore that just had to lay there in
[1:12:30] the floor and yet 40 years later they're
[1:12:34] testifying that God Is A Healer
[1:12:37] can you say man but what what is it see
[1:12:40] well see our senses operate by that kind
[1:12:43] of knowledge but then Faith knows
[1:12:47] different amen than what the doctor says
[1:12:50] faith operates on a higher knowledge
[1:12:54] than what the doctor's knowledge is
[1:12:57] ain't that right that's why a man
[1:12:59] imperfect Faith the prophet would say
[1:13:01] you know that if you had that faith and
[1:13:04] the doctor told you Friday that you're
[1:13:06] going to die amen and he said about by
[1:13:10] Monday that's only three days four days
[1:13:12] uh three days and and he said you're
[1:13:15] gonna die by Monday you're you're going
[1:13:17] to be dead he said you would laugh in
[1:13:20] the doctor's face
[1:13:22] amen why because you have a greater
[1:13:26] knowledge
[1:13:28] that has been given to you
[1:13:31] ain't that right now you have the choice
[1:13:34] and what you want to believe in you can
[1:13:37] take the doctor's words and what he has
[1:13:39] learned from medical science or you can
[1:13:42] take God's word
[1:13:46] ain't that right
[1:13:48] so we we find that that faith is founded
[1:13:53] upon the word of God so no matter what
[1:13:55] the doctor says no matter what Doom and
[1:13:57] Gloom is and no matter what what we see
[1:14:00] with our eyes and feel with our feelings
[1:14:03] and and all of these things we are our
[1:14:06] faith is founded upon God's word and we
[1:14:10] know
[1:14:11] God's word is true how many believes
[1:14:14] God's word is true
[1:14:15] you believe you really believe that
[1:14:17] God's word is true when is it true as
[1:14:19] long as you're on the Mountaintop as
[1:14:22] long as the doctor gives you a clean
[1:14:23] bill of health is it true just as long
[1:14:26] as everything is going hunky-dory is it
[1:14:28] is it true just When the Children a man
[1:14:31] your family are serving the lord
[1:14:34] or is it true at all times
[1:14:37] the word of God never fails
[1:14:41] so then faith has to be founded upon
[1:14:43] something Rock Solid and everything
[1:14:46] around us is shifting sand ain't that
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:50] it's true and we even know that the
[1:14:53] medical doctor can be wrong
[1:14:57] they're constantly changing
[1:14:59] their ideas their opinions
[1:15:03] ain't that right because they're
[1:15:04] learning
[1:15:05] but God never learns
[1:15:08] he's infinite knowledge
[1:15:10] so whatever he says it's done it's
[1:15:13] settled it's it's over ain't that right
[1:15:16] now if that Faith or if that word can be
[1:15:20] dropped down into our soul it will give
[1:15:23] us a faith that will anchor us
[1:15:29] now
[1:15:31] I hope I'm making sense to you
[1:15:37] brother Brown said people don't know the
[1:15:39] first principle of faith
[1:15:42] he said come into the prayer line
[1:15:44] but yet they don't know the first
[1:15:46] principle of faith
[1:15:49] and he says 99 percent
[1:15:52] most of them
[1:15:54] well they I think he said 99 out of a
[1:15:57] thousand
[1:15:58] uh something to that
[1:16:00] he says they have hope instead of faith
[1:16:04] now then he in one place he says little
[1:16:07] timid hope
[1:16:09] lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the
[1:16:12] greatest enemy faith has
[1:16:15] you got a good name hope
[1:16:18] so don't take that
[1:16:23] we love you
[1:16:28] now bite us these things faith hope and
[1:16:30] charity
[1:16:32] there you go
[1:16:34] it's a little timid hope lovely as sweet
[1:16:37] as she is and yet she's the greatest
[1:16:39] enemy faith has that's right the
[1:16:41] greatest enemy faith God is Hope listen
[1:16:44] because a person becomes so hopeful till
[1:16:49] they leave away from faith
[1:16:52] ain't that right
[1:16:55] they leave away from Faith you're not to
[1:16:58] be hopeful
[1:17:01] you're not to serve God In Hope
[1:17:05] right that's right ain't that right now
[1:17:08] we we expect challenges to come our way
[1:17:12] we're not promised uh uh a life of ease
[1:17:16] we're not promised something that is
[1:17:19] just everything going to be Rosy
[1:17:21] but we are promised the word of God
[1:17:25] now his word says I'll never leave you
[1:17:27] nor forsake you
[1:17:28] his word says I'm the god that healeth
[1:17:30] thee
[1:17:32] ain't that right
[1:17:33] every promise in this book is mine
[1:17:37] and without uh uh uh all things are
[1:17:39] possible to them that believe that's the
[1:17:42] word of God
[1:17:43] but see if if a person's not careful
[1:17:46] they become so hopeful
[1:17:48] till they leave away from faith
[1:17:51] cannot say and and if I can say it in a
[1:17:54] in a right way I do not do away with
[1:17:56] prayer if there's ever a time we need
[1:17:58] prayer it's now
[1:18:00] but people pray the wrong way I think
[1:18:05] they pray hoping
[1:18:07] that's right they pray
[1:18:09] but no matter do you realize you can
[1:18:11] pray without faith
[1:18:14] you can you can come to church without
[1:18:16] faith
[1:18:17] you can read this Bible without faith
[1:18:20] you can listen to the message without
[1:18:21] faith
[1:18:23] and and and the whole point is to
[1:18:25] inspire faith in you
[1:18:27] can you say man you are not to serve God
[1:18:30] by hope
[1:18:32] hoping I hope I hope maybe if I pray
[1:18:35] long enough I hope
[1:18:38] yeah
[1:18:39] amen now brother Ram says now hope will
[1:18:42] agree with the Bible hope will say it's
[1:18:45] true hope will say I believe every bit
[1:18:47] of it I believe that's that that's the
[1:18:49] word of God I believe that God will keep
[1:18:51] his promise hope believes all of that
[1:18:55] right
[1:18:56] but then hope says now I believe that
[1:18:59] God will heal
[1:19:01] but look at my condition
[1:19:06] ain't that right but now Faith don't
[1:19:09] look at that
[1:19:11] come on now Faith don't consider the
[1:19:13] condition
[1:19:14] Faith don't consider what what is going
[1:19:17] on faith don't consider what the doctor
[1:19:19] just said
[1:19:23] I my mom has been a just a woman of
[1:19:26] faith
[1:19:27] uh all the way you know all her life and
[1:19:30] her brother died of cancer and
[1:19:32] and she's made the statement I won't die
[1:19:36] of cancer I won't
[1:19:38] and uh we say well that's good you know
[1:19:43] keep it up
[1:19:44] then she got cancer
[1:19:48] did her testimony change nope she ain't
[1:19:51] gonna die of cancer
[1:19:53] so she goes around I'm not going to die
[1:19:55] of cancer
[1:19:57] so and yet she would die I mean she was
[1:20:00] the the the we didn't know what was
[1:20:02] wrong with her but all of her blood
[1:20:04] platelets she was losing blood coughing
[1:20:07] up blood it was coming out of her her
[1:20:10] eyes uh she's Mass she's a mess getting
[1:20:15] weak real weak uh just pushing herself
[1:20:19] trying to trying to just she started
[1:20:21] just laying down and mom never lays down
[1:20:24] in the day
[1:20:25] and and she's taking naps and and you
[1:20:30] know well we you know Dad was worried
[1:20:32] and we so we started pressing you know
[1:20:35] issue to get into the in the hospital
[1:20:38] find out and welcome found out you know
[1:20:41] what was going on and and she had
[1:20:45] stomach cancer and the doctor says Miss
[1:20:47] Martin it's you know usually if we can
[1:20:51] detect this and usually it's no issue
[1:20:53] but it's down in the lining of your
[1:20:56] stomach and uh you've got to have
[1:20:58] surgery my mom says I will not have
[1:21:01] surgery
[1:21:02] and he says well Miss Martin he says you
[1:21:06] have to have surgery
[1:21:07] you know and and she said well I'm just
[1:21:11] telling you I'm not going to have
[1:21:12] surgery God's going to heal me
[1:21:14] and she's testified to the doctor this
[1:21:16] you know and and so
[1:21:19] we you know and and then in this time
[1:21:23] because Dad's all you know you're lean
[1:21:25] you know you got to have surgery and
[1:21:28] Mama we ain't had I ain't having surgery
[1:21:31] so we you know we convinced told Mom
[1:21:34] said well then let's just schedule the
[1:21:36] surgery okay I'll schedule it but I
[1:21:38] ain't having surgery you know okay but
[1:21:42] you satisfied you know so I will not you
[1:21:46] know she's just going around I will not
[1:21:47] you know and and so uh then you know she
[1:21:52] she taken a doctor wanted to give her
[1:21:56] medication and things like that and
[1:21:59] you know she said well is that hindering
[1:22:01] my faith is that doesn't mean that I'm
[1:22:03] not believing or what and you know I
[1:22:05] told us well you know uh brother Brandon
[1:22:08] was with he was okay with medication and
[1:22:11] all that and ultimately the God is the
[1:22:13] one that heals so she they put her on
[1:22:16] steroids and it made her looning she
[1:22:18] said I ain't taking that no more you
[1:22:20] know and uh and on and on Walton the day
[1:22:24] came for the surgery you know and mom
[1:22:26] told Dern dad's Dern I ain't having
[1:22:29] surgery you know I ain't you know he
[1:22:32] says but I'll go I'll go but I'm not
[1:22:34] having surgery so they get in the
[1:22:37] hospital and and you know the day he
[1:22:39] came and and Dad told told the doctor
[1:22:42] says well I'll tell you what you know
[1:22:44] now you've heard my wife say she's not
[1:22:47] having surgery she's claiming God to
[1:22:49] heal her so before we do anything else I
[1:22:53] want you to go do X-rays and sit and see
[1:22:56] what you find
[1:22:57] doctors said well okay I'll do that you
[1:23:00] know so they've done the x-rays and he
[1:23:03] left Mom and Dad in there for half a day
[1:23:05] for several hours and
[1:23:08] um and they're thinking well what's
[1:23:10] going on you know what's happening and
[1:23:11] finally comes in he says you know uh
[1:23:14] Miss Martin he's I'm so sorry I've left
[1:23:16] you here so long it says but we we've
[1:23:19] done the x-rays and what we saw uh is
[1:23:23] really unbelievable but he says I I
[1:23:25] actually I've called doctors around uh
[1:23:28] to come and look at this because
[1:23:31] um it's it's something that I've not
[1:23:33] seen before and Mom said well what is it
[1:23:36] and says well I'm here to tell you that
[1:23:38] you're cancer-free so there is no cancer
[1:23:41] and you ain't needing surgery
[1:23:43] and of course mom got all excited and
[1:23:46] happy and started dancing praise God and
[1:23:50] he said well Miss Martin that God is the
[1:23:52] only one that could have done that he
[1:23:53] said I'm baffled you know and he said
[1:23:55] because it was there we know it was
[1:23:57] there but see faith is positive
[1:24:01] and and you can't work yourself up
[1:24:04] it's just accepting What God Says
[1:24:07] and not looking at anything else
[1:24:10] not considering anything else can you
[1:24:14] say man see so hope believes all of that
[1:24:18] seed but he says now Faith don't look at
[1:24:19] that faith comes around and says I don't
[1:24:23] care nothing about conditions God said
[1:24:26] so and it's mine
[1:24:30] see that's what faith says faith is
[1:24:32] Burly see as as I once said faith has
[1:24:36] chairs on the uh chairs it has hair on
[1:24:39] the chest say when it stands up and
[1:24:42] pulls its big muscles out everything
[1:24:45] else vanishes away and just flies away
[1:24:48] when Faith really takes a hold nothing
[1:24:51] else stands
[1:24:54] and you say man so now Faith doesn't
[1:24:57] need any positive signs well I'm just
[1:25:00] waiting to see if I feel better that's
[1:25:01] not faith
[1:25:03] Faith don't need positive signs Faith
[1:25:07] just looks at the word that says
[1:25:09] positive as it needs it's the most
[1:25:12] positive thing ever
[1:25:15] because you can feel better today and
[1:25:17] and and feel miserable tomorrow
[1:25:20] dad you know he is with that person
[1:25:22] fighting that persons and there will be
[1:25:24] weeks that he will do good weeks and
[1:25:27] then all of a sudden just a downhill
[1:25:29] where he can't even get out of bed
[1:25:31] and and the trembling and all that
[1:25:34] getting worse and all that but there's
[1:25:36] just that maintaining I'm Healed I'm
[1:25:39] Healed well but but you're looking worse
[1:25:41] it doesn't matter I'm Healed I'm I'm
[1:25:43] claiming my healing now you talking
[1:25:46] about battles that's battles look at
[1:25:48] brother Ron in the same uh condition
[1:25:50] with his is the cancer doctor told him
[1:25:53] what two three years ago that he had
[1:25:55] four months four months to live but
[1:25:59] every time he keeps just confessing I'm
[1:26:02] Healed
[1:26:05] he really believes he's healed
[1:26:12] amen faith
[1:26:14] you know
[1:26:16] Mary didn't need any positive signs
[1:26:21] before she confessed that she had a baby
[1:26:25] now you just imagine that everything
[1:26:27] against terrible
[1:26:29] she had she hadn't been with a man
[1:26:33] not you know and yet she's gonna go and
[1:26:36] and she's she's had the the visitation
[1:26:40] now she's so positive she's gonna have a
[1:26:43] baby
[1:26:44] and she goes and tells Elizabeth
[1:26:46] I'm with child
[1:26:49] and brother Brown said she had no
[1:26:50] positive signs
[1:26:52] but she didn't need the positive sign
[1:26:55] she had faith
[1:26:58] ain't that right now hold is okay
[1:27:02] brother Brown said she didn't wait till
[1:27:04] she was positive she was going to have
[1:27:05] this child she didn't wait till she felt
[1:27:08] alive before she said anything about it
[1:27:10] she started right away testifying
[1:27:13] telling people that she was going to
[1:27:16] have this baby when there was no signs
[1:27:17] of it yet
[1:27:19] God give us more Mary's
[1:27:23] that's right don't wait for signs and
[1:27:26] wonders just take God at his word and
[1:27:30] start rejoicing and saying it's going to
[1:27:33] happen
[1:27:34] you say well if I just had if I just had
[1:27:37] the word of an Angel to come to me you
[1:27:40] don't need an angel to come to you
[1:27:43] we've had a prophet to come
[1:27:47] ain't that right we got the word of the
[1:27:49] Lord restored to us
[1:27:51] and more on top of that the prophet said
[1:27:54] the angel of the Lord accompanies this
[1:27:56] message always
[1:27:57] everything is positive
[1:28:01] about faith all you need is faith
[1:28:05] just take God at his word ain't that
[1:28:07] right
[1:28:08] now brother Graham said I believe if
[1:28:10] every patient in this building right now
[1:28:12] would accept it upon the grounds of
[1:28:15] God's word and believe it and start
[1:28:16] testifying and praising God for your
[1:28:18] healing the meeting wouldn't close with
[1:28:21] one crippled person in here
[1:28:23] now that's a prophet he knew he was so
[1:28:26] sure of the word of God
[1:28:27] that if every individual and I say it
[1:28:30] here tonight would accept the word of
[1:28:33] God by faith
[1:28:36] except your healing on the grounds of of
[1:28:39] God's word except your deliverance on
[1:28:41] the grounds of God's word except God's
[1:28:44] mercy on the grounds of God's word
[1:28:46] except every promise of God on the
[1:28:49] grounds of God's word you would not
[1:28:52] leave here the same man
[1:28:57] he said that's right he said God is
[1:29:00] under obligation to answer his word
[1:29:02] ain't that right
[1:29:04] so now why is it important to meditate
[1:29:06] on the positive
[1:29:07] now I'm I'm not I'm not talking about
[1:29:11] when I say positive I'm not talking
[1:29:13] about getting Steve Forbes magazines
[1:29:16] and reading on that I'm not talking
[1:29:19] about getting psychology books and
[1:29:22] reading that I'm not talking about
[1:29:24] getting books about investing
[1:29:27] uh you know I mean if you're gonna do
[1:29:29] all that you know but I'm talking about
[1:29:31] something more positive
[1:29:34] and that's the word of God
[1:29:36] ain't that right
[1:29:38] so so we find why why is it important
[1:29:41] well the word of God is a seed
[1:29:44] ain't that right
[1:29:46] and what are you
[1:29:48] you're the ground
[1:29:50] that the word of God must fall into
[1:29:54] you that's right you got to be the good
[1:29:56] ground
[1:29:57] you got to be ground that is acceptable
[1:30:00] receptive to the word of God
[1:30:03] amen see in order to bring forth so you
[1:30:07] and I we're the ground brother Brown
[1:30:09] said see it's the inside no matter how
[1:30:11] good you are how moral you are how
[1:30:13] truthful you are those things are
[1:30:15] respected but Jesus said except a man be
[1:30:17] born again there's got to be something
[1:30:20] happen inside if you don't that's
[1:30:22] artificial put on for down in your heart
[1:30:24] you desire to do it anyhow it can't be
[1:30:27] artificial it's got to be real and
[1:30:29] there's only one Avenue that that can
[1:30:32] come down and that's by way of free
[1:30:35] moral agency it come into the Soul by
[1:30:39] your thoughts
[1:30:42] as a man seeketh in his heart so is he
[1:30:47] so it comes drops into your soul by your
[1:30:51] thoughts now brother Brown says anytime
[1:30:54] a woman takes a wrong step she has to
[1:30:57] First receive it in her mind
[1:31:00] ain't that right some Slicker has to
[1:31:02] persuade her she listens to it against
[1:31:05] her own better judgment then the ACT is
[1:31:08] committed
[1:31:09] I think that's why the the preaching of
[1:31:12] the Gospel is so important
[1:31:14] ain't that right if the devil can preach
[1:31:17] a a gospel preach something to uh to get
[1:31:21] it into your thinking
[1:31:23] and then calls you to commit an act he
[1:31:26] did it for Eve then what about the
[1:31:28] preaching of the Gospel
[1:31:32] so he says see uh uh first it hit Satan
[1:31:36] hit Eve's mind
[1:31:38] and in the womb of her mind she doubted
[1:31:41] God's word
[1:31:42] now in the womb of God's mind or our
[1:31:45] mind today tonight we want to believe
[1:31:47] God's word
[1:31:48] but she doubted God's word in the womb
[1:31:51] of her mind then come the actual Act
[1:31:55] and the only way that we can ever be
[1:31:57] born again is first in the womb of the
[1:32:00] Mind receive the word and then the
[1:32:03] spirit comes on top of that and brings
[1:32:06] it to life there you are that's what
[1:32:08] does it that's real gospel teaching
[1:32:11] brother
[1:32:12] he said I believe that Saint Paul was
[1:32:13] standing today he had teached the same
[1:32:15] thing I do in this hour ain't that right
[1:32:18] so before it can be materialized it has
[1:32:22] to be received in the mind
[1:32:28] is that the way it happened with God
[1:32:33] Man was created in the mind of God first
[1:32:36] knows what brother Branham said God
[1:32:38] created a man in his own image after his
[1:32:40] likeness and he created him it's God
[1:32:42] speaking in his thoughts in his mind
[1:32:46] what he had and then hears you know uh
[1:32:50] where he actually done the deed
[1:32:53] so the creation remember he says the
[1:32:55] world was created by God's thought first
[1:32:58] he created the world by his thought
[1:33:01] first
[1:33:02] ain't that right amen look at Redemption
[1:33:06] Jesus came way before he actually came
[1:33:12] Redemption was completed before the act
[1:33:14] of redemption was completed
[1:33:17] ain't that right brother Brown said God
[1:33:20] had always had a Plan of Redemption and
[1:33:23] that's been through blood ever since the
[1:33:26] very beginning and Dawn of time
[1:33:28] preceived in the mind of God before the
[1:33:31] world ever come into existence
[1:33:35] ain't that right so the Plan of
[1:33:38] Redemption that we're enjoying today was
[1:33:42] conceived in the mind of God
[1:33:46] we see Jesus slain a man at Calvary but
[1:33:50] it happened fairs in the mind of God
[1:33:54] brother Brown says Jesus was the lamb
[1:33:56] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:33:58] he was enslained for four thousand years
[1:34:01] afterward
[1:34:03] but he first in this the mind of God was
[1:34:08] already slain and Redemption was
[1:34:10] completed
[1:34:12] and in the mind of God you are always
[1:34:15] saved glorified
[1:34:19] Victorious and it happened in the mind
[1:34:21] of God
[1:34:23] and you're only the thoughts of God
[1:34:26] being materialized
[1:34:29] and brother Graham said if you wasn't in
[1:34:31] the mind of God you never will be
[1:34:34] can you say Amen
[1:34:36] so it has to come into the Mind first
[1:34:43] God wants you know people who are
[1:34:46] prisoners to his word
[1:34:49] notice
[1:34:50] brother Brown said Christ is now taking
[1:34:53] himself a bride
[1:34:55] is what I love
[1:34:57] well what is this bride it was a thought
[1:35:00] conceived in his mind
[1:35:03] every member of the Bride is already
[1:35:06] been placed in his mind
[1:35:08] no one can take your place
[1:35:10] because he is eternal his thoughts are
[1:35:13] Eternal his word is eternal no matter
[1:35:16] what the devil does
[1:35:18] you're you you cannot be replaced
[1:35:22] ain't that right now Christ is now
[1:35:26] taking himself abroad to be pregnated
[1:35:29] everybody say be pregnant with what his
[1:35:33] own seed word in her womb Spirit womb in
[1:35:38] her mind and it won't mix with any
[1:35:41] denominational trash
[1:35:44] she is a virgin to him
[1:35:48] oh aren't you glad that's that's where
[1:35:51] you're at tonight you are a virgin to
[1:35:54] him
[1:35:55] Satan Cannot drop anything in the womb
[1:35:58] of your mind
[1:36:00] you ain't gonna dwell on it you ain't
[1:36:02] gonna mess with it you ain't gonna give
[1:36:04] any thought to it why you've been
[1:36:07] ordained to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:11] and you are now becoming impregnated
[1:36:14] with the word of God not impregnated
[1:36:17] with what the doctor's word said you're
[1:36:20] impregnated by what God Said
[1:36:22] sure the trials are going to come sure
[1:36:25] the challenges are here sure diseases
[1:36:28] are going to try to come upon you but
[1:36:30] you've already been planted by the word
[1:36:33] of God the word has now been impregnated
[1:36:36] in the womb of your mind
[1:36:39] we're not we're not we're not saying
[1:36:42] Amen to these things for not
[1:36:44] it's something that's happening in the
[1:36:46] womb of our mind
[1:36:50] you believe that we're becoming
[1:36:52] receptive to the word of God
[1:36:57] yeah
[1:36:59] brother Brown said if you've got your
[1:37:01] senses see taste feel smell in here
[1:37:03] they're all right but don't trust them
[1:37:07] everybody say don't trust them
[1:37:10] unless they agree with the word
[1:37:12] don't trust them
[1:37:15] they're all right
[1:37:17] but if they disagree with the word don't
[1:37:19] you listen to them
[1:37:21] now imagination conscience memory of
[1:37:23] reason and affections they're all right
[1:37:26] if they agree with the word
[1:37:29] but if your affection doesn't agree with
[1:37:31] the word get rid of it
[1:37:33] because you'll blow a few flu
[1:37:36] right quick if your reason disagrees
[1:37:39] with the word get away from it that's
[1:37:41] right if your memory imagination your
[1:37:44] conscience anything disagrees with that
[1:37:46] that's what's on the inside get rid of
[1:37:49] it
[1:37:50] don't you let the devil take that seed
[1:37:52] away from you
[1:37:54] ain't that right now we know that the
[1:37:57] the the the foregrounds there were four
[1:37:59] grounds and the seed was planted on all
[1:38:01] them grounds but there was only one
[1:38:03] ground that brought forth to the right
[1:38:05] fruits
[1:38:07] brought forth that's right other the
[1:38:11] trials choked it out and the pleasures
[1:38:13] or whatever see but then there's that
[1:38:15] good ground
[1:38:16] and I believe I'm talking to good ground
[1:38:18] tonight
[1:38:23] second Corinthians 10 and 5. Paul says
[1:38:27] casting down imagination cast it down
[1:38:30] cast it down and everything everybody
[1:38:33] say every High thing
[1:38:36] that exalters itself against the
[1:38:38] knowledge of God
[1:38:39] ain't that right now you know what the
[1:38:41] knowledges of God is because this is the
[1:38:43] word of God
[1:38:44] you've seen it Vindicated over and over
[1:38:46] and over we've seen it it was the theme
[1:38:49] of brother branham's Ministry he is the
[1:38:51] same yesterday today and forever
[1:38:55] if he raised the dead then he can raise
[1:38:58] him up now
[1:38:59] if he healed the sick he can do it now
[1:39:02] ain't that right if he calls the man to
[1:39:05] get up off that that had been there
[1:39:07] for years and years amen and yet raised
[1:39:10] him up he can do it today there's
[1:39:12] nothing impossible with God
[1:39:16] Hallelujah to God yes sir
[1:39:19] now he says casting down imaginations
[1:39:21] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:39:23] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:39:25] bringing everybody say bringing now he's
[1:39:28] talking about you you bringing into
[1:39:31] captivity
[1:39:32] right every thought to The Obedience of
[1:39:36] Christ
[1:39:37] any thought that is negative don't you
[1:39:39] dwell on that
[1:39:43] come on now
[1:39:44] there may be symptoms but don't dwell on
[1:39:46] it situation gets worse don't dwell on
[1:39:49] it
[1:39:50] bring every thought that is against God
[1:39:53] the knowledge of God bring it into
[1:39:55] captivity
[1:39:57] then you say Amen
[1:40:01] now brother Brown said it must be
[1:40:03] accepted in the mind
[1:40:05] and then it's believed with the heart
[1:40:07] then the word of God becomes a reality
[1:40:10] then every senses of soul and body is
[1:40:13] just scored out with the Holy Ghost then
[1:40:15] your sense of God your consciousness of
[1:40:18] God or your conscience of God everything
[1:40:20] that's Godly flows through you there's
[1:40:23] not a doubt anywhere and there's nothing
[1:40:26] can rise up
[1:40:28] is this okay are we speaking something
[1:40:30] for him
[1:40:33] there's nothing can come up in the
[1:40:36] memory
[1:40:37] now listen to this I think this is this
[1:40:39] is this is good
[1:40:41] this is where we come we've got to come
[1:40:42] to
[1:40:46] the word must be accepted in the mind
[1:40:49] then it's believed with the heart
[1:40:52] then the word of God becomes a reality
[1:40:54] and every senses of soul and body is
[1:40:57] just scored out with the Holy Ghost then
[1:40:59] your sins of God your conscience of God
[1:41:01] everything that's Godly flows through
[1:41:03] you
[1:41:04] there's not a doubt anywhere there's
[1:41:07] nothing can rise up there's nothing can
[1:41:10] come up in the memory and say well I
[1:41:12] remember Miss Jones tried to trust God
[1:41:14] and miss so and so miss doe tried to
[1:41:16] trust God for healing one time and she
[1:41:18] failed
[1:41:19] see that won't come up
[1:41:22] because the word has already been
[1:41:24] angered in the soul
[1:41:27] ain't that right
[1:41:28] but if that channel has been cleared out
[1:41:30] and purged and been filled with the uh
[1:41:33] fuel on the inside with the holy spirit
[1:41:35] that don't even come in memory no matter
[1:41:39] about Miss Jones and what she did it's
[1:41:41] you and God together and nobody else but
[1:41:44] you too there you are there's your
[1:41:46] battle kill him at the beginning stop
[1:41:50] him dead in his tracks
[1:41:53] it ain't how long and keep that in mind
[1:41:56] it ain't how long
[1:41:58] you can make the war linger
[1:42:01] stop it right now
[1:42:04] stop it right now
[1:42:07] can you say Amen
[1:42:09] don't get don't let Satan get you to a
[1:42:11] point and talk you into it where you're
[1:42:12] always going to have your heart problems
[1:42:17] don't get into the condition that you're
[1:42:19] waiting to be healed
[1:42:21] that's not faith
[1:42:23] well I'm waiting I'm waiting no if
[1:42:26] you've got faith you already are healed
[1:42:28] there ain't no waiting to it just begin
[1:42:30] to confess it just begin to thank God
[1:42:32] I'm Healed I I just thank God that I'm
[1:42:35] I'm you know there's times that I've got
[1:42:37] trouble in my shoulder you know and it
[1:42:39] hurts to lift up you know but you know
[1:42:40] what I'll do I'll just lift up my arm
[1:42:42] anyway and say thank God I'm Healed I
[1:42:45] will never let that devil stop me from
[1:42:47] praising my God
[1:42:50] it ain't gonna do it
[1:42:55] and he'll get us into that point to
[1:42:58] where all we see is our problems all we
[1:43:00] see is the negative all we see is
[1:43:02] everything around us and then we really
[1:43:04] have a hard time just taking God at his
[1:43:07] word
[1:43:08] well if I've got faith if that faith is
[1:43:11] a knowing and I'm it's telling me that
[1:43:13] I'm already healed well I ain't gonna
[1:43:15] just stay home
[1:43:19] I'm not going to just stay and whine
[1:43:21] about it
[1:43:22] many times I preach well I'm I'm not
[1:43:24] feeling good but I ain't gonna let the
[1:43:26] devil stop me
[1:43:32] and you say man
[1:43:34] now brother Brown said if you'll come
[1:43:36] and you'll keep them memories and
[1:43:38] conscience and everything thinking about
[1:43:40] well I might fail it might not be right
[1:43:43] see how Satan does that to our memory
[1:43:46] our conscience our reasoning and all
[1:43:48] that have you ever just done that has he
[1:43:51] ever come to you well if I confess my
[1:43:53] healing and then it gets worse what are
[1:43:54] people going to say doesn't matter
[1:43:56] hey
[1:43:59] right so he said see you say thinking
[1:44:03] about will I might fail I might not be
[1:44:05] right don't you do that at all you throw
[1:44:08] aside everything and open up the channel
[1:44:11] and say God your word is eternally true
[1:44:13] it's for me if the whole church fails
[1:44:16] that the whole world fails yet I cannot
[1:44:19] fail because I'm taking you at your word
[1:44:23] now is that the way we're doing it the
[1:44:25] whole Walk Of God has taken God at his
[1:44:27] word here
[1:44:28] amen
[1:44:31] how many times I tell you I'm going in a
[1:44:33] Rapture and you know what Satan tries to
[1:44:34] tell me Well what if
[1:44:37] I ignore that thought I'm going in a
[1:44:39] rapture
[1:44:40] I'm taking God at his word I'm going in
[1:44:42] a rapture
[1:44:43] can you say Amen see that's what faith
[1:44:46] does you start claiming it in a personal
[1:44:48] way
[1:44:51] yeah it may make you fanatical but God
[1:44:54] will always prove you
[1:44:56] y'all will always vindicate you right
[1:45:02] yes sir that's right so he says see you
[1:45:05] throw aside everything open up the
[1:45:06] channel and say God your word is
[1:45:08] eternally true it's for me
[1:45:10] he says see there's the battle that's
[1:45:12] the thing
[1:45:14] another place he says God is putting
[1:45:16] down everything you're thinking about
[1:45:20] thoughts matter
[1:45:22] everything you're thinking about
[1:45:26] now if that can really get down into us
[1:45:30] I'm gonna close in a minute but I'm
[1:45:32] gonna say it to you
[1:45:34] that can really get down to us then we
[1:45:36] will be careful
[1:45:38] as to what we allow our mind to
[1:45:41] entertain
[1:45:43] ment
[1:45:46] can you say man
[1:45:49] he's putting everything down you're
[1:45:52] thinking about and he knows it in his
[1:45:54] recording book
[1:45:56] your thoughts everybody say my thoughts
[1:45:59] are louder in heaven than your voice is
[1:46:02] on Earth
[1:46:03] right so it says then think the right
[1:46:06] thing
[1:46:08] think the right thing
[1:46:11] well I sure want to be better than than
[1:46:13] let it start with your thinking
[1:46:15] well I I want to act better Christians
[1:46:18] let it start with your thinking
[1:46:22] you say man
[1:46:24] and now it cannot just be intellectual
[1:46:26] thought now we understand this that it
[1:46:28] has to come by your it through your
[1:46:29] intellectual thinking because that's
[1:46:31] what we're preaching right now
[1:46:33] but it can't just stop with intellect
[1:46:36] it has to come down into your heart
[1:46:41] in that soul
[1:46:44] and you say Amen
[1:46:46] see so now brother Brown would say this
[1:46:49] there's your Battleground your
[1:46:50] Battleground is back here at the
[1:46:52] beginning back in here in the soul back
[1:46:54] in your mind that opens the mind is the
[1:46:56] gate to the soul the gate to the spirit
[1:46:58] rather he said your mind opens up and
[1:47:00] accepts this uh accepts the spirit or
[1:47:04] rejects the spirit you can have these
[1:47:05] have little Consciousness little
[1:47:07] feelings little Sensations all these
[1:47:09] things that has nothing to do with it
[1:47:10] that's just a little Sensations things
[1:47:12] but when it comes to reality your mind
[1:47:15] opens it up your mind either accepts it
[1:47:19] or rejects it
[1:47:21] ain't that right
[1:47:22] and then he says oh God let none of them
[1:47:25] miss that
[1:47:26] see your mind either accepts it or
[1:47:29] rejects it
[1:47:31] ain't that right
[1:47:33] another place that said it's your mind
[1:47:35] that opens up the door closes the door
[1:47:37] and listens to your conscience listens
[1:47:39] to your memory listens to your
[1:47:40] affections but when your mind closes
[1:47:43] itself to these things and let God the
[1:47:45] spirit of his word come in it blows the
[1:47:48] rest of the stuff out every doubt is
[1:47:51] gone every fear is gone every sensation
[1:47:53] of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone
[1:47:56] there's nothing standing there but the
[1:47:58] word of God and Satan cannot battle that
[1:48:03] he'll mess with your five senses of the
[1:48:05] flesh you'll mess with the five senses
[1:48:07] of of of of of your your your spirit
[1:48:10] that he cannot mess with what what's in
[1:48:13] the soul
[1:48:17] he cannot battle against it
[1:48:20] now notice Philippians 2 5 let this mind
[1:48:22] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:48:25] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:48:27] not robbery to be equal with God
[1:48:30] your mind must be open to the word of
[1:48:33] God
[1:48:34] ain't that right as one Minister said
[1:48:37] you know we must open it open to or let
[1:48:40] it happen in reality not just mental
[1:48:43] conception
[1:48:45] see so we cannot not open our mind or
[1:48:49] wound to just anything
[1:48:54] you can't
[1:48:58] that's well
[1:49:00] that's what you've done
[1:49:02] she her womb her womb was came was
[1:49:08] filled from from The Serpent and her
[1:49:11] womb came from Adam
[1:49:13] two different Acts
[1:49:18] and brought forth two different children
[1:49:21] is that right
[1:49:24] yeah and we're taking that in the
[1:49:25] spiritual sense of our mind
[1:49:27] if your mind is the womb to accept
[1:49:31] you cannot accept the things of the
[1:49:33] devil
[1:49:35] and the things of God at the same time
[1:49:37] God ain't that that God don't want that
[1:49:40] he wants a Verge a bride that's virgin
[1:49:42] to him
[1:49:45] ain't that right
[1:49:48] so then you cannot let your mind just be
[1:49:51] empty
[1:49:52] it's why every service counts
[1:49:55] so I plan them tapes count
[1:49:57] the word of God counts
[1:50:00] getting in prayer counts
[1:50:03] you're meditating on the positive
[1:50:09] brother Brandon even said when you
[1:50:10] approach God approaching based upon the
[1:50:12] word of God
[1:50:14] God you promised this
[1:50:18] don't don't just just come half-hearted
[1:50:21] don't don't come to God with what other
[1:50:24] people say about it
[1:50:26] well God so-and-so says it can't happen
[1:50:29] but I sure hope it does
[1:50:32] that's not how you approach God
[1:50:34] approaching based upon what he said he's
[1:50:37] the one that said it
[1:50:39] it's not what so-and-so says about it's
[1:50:41] not what happened to everybody else
[1:50:43] I'm approaching you God based upon your
[1:50:46] word
[1:50:47] and I'm accepting it for me
[1:50:51] meditating upon that positive
[1:50:55] if the musicians will come
[1:51:00] you realize people can keep the word
[1:51:02] from living in them by what they think
[1:51:04] of it
[1:51:06] REM said I just know that there's
[1:51:09] something right out here just ready to
[1:51:11] reach over and get a hold of him
[1:51:14] it's going to be greater than it's ever
[1:51:16] been it's going to be wonderful I
[1:51:18] believe God's fixing to do something
[1:51:19] great but now we've got to approach it
[1:51:23] sanely
[1:51:25] intelligently and right in the word
[1:51:30] and you say man
[1:51:34] and how do we do that knowing that the
[1:51:37] word is being fulfilled
[1:51:41] today
[1:51:43] knowing Who We Are
[1:51:47] I got a lot more to go but
[1:51:51] who do you believe you are
[1:51:54] you believe you're a son and daughter of
[1:51:56] God do you believe that you've been
[1:51:57] chosen for the foundation of the world
[1:52:00] yeah
[1:52:01] you've been called for this age do you
[1:52:04] realize do you believe that the word
[1:52:06] that is for this age is being fulfilled
[1:52:08] in you
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:12] that ain't for anyone else it's for me
[1:52:14] every promise is for me
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:18] it's for me
[1:52:20] and so then when we come to God we
[1:52:22] approach God sanely we approach God
[1:52:24] intelligently based upon his word
[1:52:29] hello
[1:52:30] we can say well God I'd come to you and
[1:52:33] I just want to thank you for what you've
[1:52:34] done in Noah's day God you're just so
[1:52:36] good and get up and walk away
[1:52:39] what about my day God I want to thank
[1:52:42] you for choosing me I want to thank you
[1:52:44] for the word that is pertaining me
[1:52:47] and I'm telling you I'm accepting it be
[1:52:50] it unto me according to Thy word father
[1:52:53] what is it you're approaching him sanely
[1:52:56] intelligently based upon the word
[1:52:59] the word for our day
[1:53:01] you're loving isn't he wonderful
[1:53:06] I thought of this
[1:53:08] he said while the Holy Spirit is here
[1:53:10] we'll call the prayer line and pray for
[1:53:12] the sick everybody get your faith down
[1:53:14] and and in your heart
[1:53:16] you don't have to say it in your mouth
[1:53:19] remember that you don't have to say it
[1:53:21] in your mouth just remember your
[1:53:22] thoughts are louder in heaven and your
[1:53:24] voice is on Earth
[1:53:26] say this oh Jesus thou son of David have
[1:53:28] mercy on me and see if he'll do the same
[1:53:31] thing he did back then
[1:53:33] Hallelujah why
[1:53:36] it's coming into your mind you're
[1:53:38] entertaining it in your thoughts and
[1:53:41] while they thought upon him he showed up
[1:53:44] and brother Ram said it's when you're
[1:53:46] thinking upon him that he shows up the
[1:53:49] angel of the Lord is upon this upon the
[1:53:52] Earth he is here with his people do you
[1:53:54] believe that he is here it's not
[1:53:56] something that you're having to beg for
[1:53:58] him to come he is here
[1:54:00] but what are we meditating upon what
[1:54:03] what is bringing him to us are we
[1:54:06] sinking upon things that driving him
[1:54:09] hiding him from us or are we thinking
[1:54:11] those things that makes him more visible
[1:54:13] before us
[1:54:15] he's here
[1:54:17] not just with the propheties here with
[1:54:19] the people with us his bride you believe
[1:54:22] that
[1:54:23] Hallelujah let's just sing it now it's
[1:54:27] already done oh it's already done
[1:54:32] hallelujah
[1:54:40] It's Already Done
[1:54:42] praise the Lord
[1:54:45] foreign
[1:55:14] hurray praise the Lord
[1:55:17] the battle
[1:55:19] the battle's old
[1:55:22] terrie is one
[1:55:25] I'm already here
[1:55:29] say it again it's already done
[1:55:32] it's already done
[1:55:41] It's Already Done
[1:55:45] praise the Lord the Battle Is Over
[1:55:53] Victory is one
[1:55:56] it's all
[1:55:58] they just play Softly
[1:56:03] now if you notice this quote
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:07] he said just polishing and joining
[1:56:09] church and reading a whole lot and
[1:56:11] knowing a lot of books and authors and
[1:56:13] so forth doesn't mean that you're
[1:56:14] converted
[1:56:15] because you have an intellectual mind
[1:56:18] that makes you have a mental conception
[1:56:20] that there is a God somewhere still
[1:56:23] you're not a Christian yet until
[1:56:24] actually you've become personal in
[1:56:28] contact with Christ that changes your
[1:56:30] heart and nature
[1:56:32] and what stood out to me is that the
[1:56:35] intellectual mind makes you have a
[1:56:38] mental conception
[1:56:40] that it's got to go deeper than that
[1:56:43] because that don't mean that you have
[1:56:45] that faith
[1:56:46] but when that word drops down from your
[1:56:49] mental conception that intellect drops
[1:56:52] down into your heart and only by God it
[1:56:55] can do that
[1:56:57] then it becomes more here than here
[1:57:00] it becomes a knowing down in here
[1:57:04] and then you begin to confess from out
[1:57:08] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:57:10] speaketh
[1:57:11] ain't that right and when it's down into
[1:57:14] the soul
[1:57:15] that you're healed that you're saved
[1:57:18] that you're delivered that you're free
[1:57:22] then no matter what no matter what you
[1:57:24] see no matter what happens around no
[1:57:27] matter what you feel Satan's gonna try
[1:57:30] to make all your senses and everything
[1:57:31] go haywire and up and down and you all
[1:57:33] know how it goes
[1:57:35] feelings and Sensations and this
[1:57:37] sometimes you feel good sometimes you
[1:57:39] don't sometimes you think you're safe
[1:57:41] sometimes you don't feel like you're
[1:57:42] saved all of these feelings and emotions
[1:57:45] and all of that has no bearing to it
[1:57:48] because now faith has anchored in that
[1:57:50] soul
[1:57:52] the soul is the control tower
[1:57:54] it governs everything else
[1:57:57] can you say Amen
[1:57:59] brother Brian said now there's two
[1:58:00] different types of christianities seem
[1:58:03] strange but I would not say two
[1:58:04] different types I'd say two different
[1:58:07] phases would be a better word to use two
[1:58:09] phases the same Christianity but two
[1:58:12] phases of it one of them is an
[1:58:14] intellectual or a mental conception of
[1:58:16] what God has said in his word and of
[1:58:18] Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge
[1:58:20] the other is a is an experimental
[1:58:23] experience that God has given the man in
[1:58:25] his heart
[1:58:27] the one intellectually is hunger and
[1:58:29] he's feasing on God but his Feast
[1:58:31] doesn't hold out
[1:58:32] the other seems to have Victory all the
[1:58:34] time there's nothing bothers them now
[1:58:37] have you ever just noticed there's
[1:58:38] nothing bothering them it's not that
[1:58:40] they're living a life of ease they're
[1:58:42] going through the same afflictions
[1:58:44] they're going through all these things
[1:58:45] but nothing is bothering them
[1:58:48] because they're anchored some things
[1:58:50] went beyond intellectually and gotten
[1:58:52] down in that soul
[1:58:54] he says see there's nothing bothering
[1:58:56] them they're just as solid and anchored
[1:58:59] as they can be no trials no storms
[1:59:02] bothers them at all
[1:59:05] oh my
[1:59:06] Hallelujah I believe that's where God is
[1:59:09] getting the church to be can you say
[1:59:12] Amen do you love him
