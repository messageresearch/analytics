[37:21] time thought of the other day just
[37:24] thinking of that scripture you know of
[37:27] where the Lord promised that he would
[37:28] bear his people up on Eagle wings and
[37:32] and we saw you know how that the Jews
[37:34] use that scripture you know to
[37:39] uh if I've got history right that they
[37:42] were a lot of them were maybe scared to
[37:45] get on the planes as an old Rabbi he
[37:48] began to read that scripture he bear
[37:50] bear my people up on Eagle wings and
[37:54] they took courage and they got in all
[37:55] them PLS and they went to the Homeland
[37:57] and there they are positionally there
[38:00] and we see what's going on and that
[38:03] ain't all by accident it's uh um um it's
[38:08] just exactly the way God's planned it
[38:10] and we know that that U God the spirit
[38:13] of God is lifting off of America off the
[38:17] Gentiles and is returning back to the
[38:20] Jews before all that can happen amen
[38:23] there's there's an eaglets if we could
[38:26] say it that way
[38:28] that God promised I ain't going to leave
[38:29] them here I'm going to Bear them up on
[38:32] Eagle wings and I'm so glad for that
[38:35] because we've got a word that is
[38:37] restored to us not to just get us
[38:40] educated not to make us church members
[38:42] but to literally take us home amen and I
[38:46] am so glad for that we are getting ready
[38:50] to leave this
[38:51] world and you know people are falling
[38:54] apart and they're looking for answers
[38:57] the most intelligent men are looking for
[39:00] answers what's going on what's Happening
[39:03] you know and just talking to a gentleman
[39:05] today just a really fine gentleman and
[39:08] uh but he was telling me he says I he

[46:43] verse number
[46:44] 18 the Bible said and I said my strength
[46:48] and my hope is perished from the Lord
[46:52] remembering my Affliction and my misery
[46:55] the wormwood and the GF all my soul hath
[46:59] him still in remembrance and is humbled
[47:02] in me this I recall to my mind and
[47:06] therefore have I hope it is of the
[47:10] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[47:14] amen now here's why because his
[47:16] compassions they fail not they are new
[47:20] every morning great is thy faithfulness
[47:24] the Lord is my portion saith my soul
[47:27] therefore will I hope in him and the
[47:29] Lord is good unto them that wait for him
[47:32] Amen to the soul that seeketh him now in
[47:35] Ephesians chapter 2 in Ephesians chapter
[47:38] 2 and verse one uh you all know that
[47:41] this is Brother bram's text in the
[47:42] sermon God who is rich in Mercy amen and
[47:46] I want to tonight maybe just to speak a
[47:48] little bit here to you some more on the
[47:50] thought of Mercy we were speaking last
[47:51] time we spoke to you on his mercies R
[47:54] new every morning and maybe just to take
[47:56] another portion of that in Ephesians
[47:58] chapter 2 and verse one Paul here
[48:00] speaking brother Bram says it very
[48:01] beautiful a personal way he says you
[48:04] hath he quickened who were dead and
[48:06] trespasses and sins now we're in time
[48:09] past you walked according to the course
[48:12] of this world according to the prince of
[48:15] the power of the air the spirit that now
[48:17] worketh in the children of Disobedience
[48:21] among whom also we all had our
[48:22] conversation in times past in the lust
[48:25] of our flesh for fulfilling the desires
[48:28] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[48:31] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[48:33] others now amen that's a pretty dark
[48:36] picture a't it but God Amen somebody say
[48:39] that with me but God who is rich in
[48:42] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[48:46] loved us amen let's just bow our hearts
[48:49] together tonight Heavenly Father Lord
[48:51] your word is true and your spirit is so
[48:54] real among us tonight father as I heard
[48:56] your Prophet say today that Lord we're
[48:58] not just coming to church to learn
[49:00] something new or to father to get a
[49:03] better idea or to just see one another
[49:05] he said but we're coming to church
[49:07] because God is God and Lord I know to
[49:10] the world or to some that might sound
[49:12] foolish but Lord to a Believer Lord
[49:14] Wherever We Gather and know that you are
[49:16] God that means all things are possible
[49:19] and Lord as we come here tonight thou
[49:21] knowest the needs of every heart Lord
[49:23] the situations that maybe seem
[49:25] impossible Lord Maybe sicknesses and
[49:27] diseases and bodies Lord I don't know
[49:29] all the needs but thou knowest all
[49:31] things and Lord we're asking you to come
[49:33] among us tonight now father we we have
[49:36] sensed your presence here in the singing
[49:37] Lord as the Believers have laid aside
[49:40] the cares of life and the things of the
[49:42] day to Lord create an atmosphere that
[49:44] you would be pleased to come and dwell
[49:46] in now Lord I'm asking as we Endeavor to
[49:48] look into your word Lord May the power
[49:51] of Revelation take over the meeting Lord
[49:53] May Hearts be stimulated by the
[49:55] revelation of the word
[49:57] that youve sent in this generation and
[49:58] whatever you have on your heart we'll be
[50:00] sure to give thee praise and honor and
[50:02] glory for all things you do Lord you do
[50:05] them well we commit this meet in thy
[50:07] faithful hands in Jesus Christ's name we
[50:09] pray and all the Believers says amen and
[50:13] amen God bless you amen as you have your
[50:15] seats here tonight amen we we thank the
[50:18] Lord for the reading of the word of God
[50:20] amen amen I want to by the help of the
[50:22] Lord for just a few moments amen I want
[50:24] to take a a thought here tonight and the
[50:26] titled this I kind of may be left off
[50:28] with that last time but I want to pick
[50:30] up here on it's of his mercies amen that
[50:33] we are not consumed intellectually it's
[50:36] of his mercies that we're not consumed
[50:38] intellectually now Ephesians 2 Paul says
[50:41] but God who is rich in Mercy brother BR
[50:44] said see he's rich in many things he
[50:46] said but to me the greatest of all amen
[50:49] is that he is rich in Mercy now when you
[50:51] look at the definition of mercy from
[50:53] Ephesians 2 it is the kindness or the
[50:56] good willll towards the miserable and
[50:58] The Afflicted amen and it is joined with
[51:01] a desire to help them amen now then that
[51:03] Mercy begins to be broke down speaking
[51:06] of men showing Mercy towards men that is
[51:08] to exercise the virtue of Mercy amen and
[51:11] to show on self merciful then there is
[51:14] the mercy of God towards men and that is
[51:17] the mercy of God in providing and
[51:19] offering to men salvation amen by Christ
[51:22] then he speaks of the mercy of Christ
[51:24] amen whereby at his return to judgment
[51:27] he will bless true Christians amen with
[51:29] eternal life now I'll say this tonight I
[51:32] believe that we are here amen as Eagles
[51:35] I believe we're here as end time
[51:36] Believers that believe in the end time
[51:38] word and I believe that we're not here
[51:40] gathered under just commentaries and
[51:42] ideas and theologies amen but we're here
[51:45] underneath a prophet's teaching amen
[51:47] which is a perfect interpretation of the
[51:50] word of God Amen with Divine Vindication
[51:53] so we no longer amen just reading Act 2
[51:57] or John 3 or John 5 amen under the
[51:59] mindset of what somebody else has
[52:01] thought about those scriptures amen but
[52:04] now we're reading it under perfect
[52:06] interpretation amen by Divine
[52:08] Vindication therefore tonight I can
[52:10] announce to you amen that we are already
[52:13] the possessors of eternal life amen and
[52:16] there is absolutely nothing that the
[52:18] devil can do about it amen think about
[52:21] that tonight there's no devil there's no
[52:23] trouble there's no pressure amen there's
[52:25] nothing that can change change the
[52:27] Revelation amen that you was in God from
[52:29] before the foundation of the world Amen
[52:32] and you are here as a representation
[52:35] amen of a manifestation of the thought
[52:37] of God now brother sister very beautiful
[52:40] that no man can come to me except my
[52:42] father draws him first see all that
[52:44] comes amen they will have everlasting
[52:47] life amen and I'll raise them up at the
[52:49] last day now he that heareth my words
[52:53] and believeth on him that sent me now
[52:55] watch what brother B says amen have not
[52:58] will have so this is not something in
[53:00] the future amen but rather it's
[53:02] something in the past amen that they
[53:04] will have amen present tense right now
[53:07] amen Everlasting eternal life and shall
[53:09] not come into condemnation amen but they
[53:13] have passed from Death unto life now
[53:15] amen because you have believed not
[53:17] intellectually amen but from your heart
[53:20] so you're in possession amen of the
[53:22] Divine promise of God of eternal life
[53:25] amen not because of something you did
[53:27] amen but because of something he did
[53:30] amen and you have accepted the
[53:32] Revelation that these are not things in
[53:34] the past amen and they're not just in
[53:36] the future amen but they're right here
[53:38] in the present again he says every who
[53:40] believes on Jesus Christ I don't mean
[53:43] intellectually believes amen but with
[53:45] your heart believes on Jesus Christ amen
[53:48] then God's life comes into you and you
[53:50] got eternal life amen and you pass from
[53:54] death into life because Christ has said
[53:56] Soul amen now I'm I'm drawing this
[53:58] inspiration tonight amen it is of the
[54:00] Lord's mercies that we are not consumed
[54:03] amen because of his compassions they
[54:05] fail not now amen y'all remember last
[54:08] time we spoke to you on those three
[54:09] Hebrew boys amen how that they did not
[54:11] allow the fiery furnace to consume their
[54:14] identity amen but rather they left the
[54:16] door of Mercy open so that the fourth
[54:18] man could walk in amen and they were
[54:21] possessing the gates of the enemy amen
[54:23] because the Lord's mercies were new unto
[54:26] them I want to say this morning or he
[54:28] says now they are new every morning
[54:29] because Great Is Thy Faithfulness now I
[54:32] want to read this to you again they are
[54:34] new Every Morning day and night amen
[54:36] proclaim the mercy and compassion of God
[54:39] who could exist throughout the day if
[54:41] there were not a continual amen
[54:43] superintending Providence who could be
[54:45] preserved in the night if the Watchmen
[54:48] of Israel ever slumbered or slept but we
[54:50] are sustained by the mercies of God Amen
[54:53] we are sustained by the mercies of God
[54:56] man whole life his bodily his mental and
[54:59] spiritual is sustained by the mercy of
[55:01] the Lord it is of the Lord's Mercy amen
[55:04] that we are not consumed intellectually
[55:07] it is of the Lord's Mercy that we are
[55:10] not consumed intellectually he said
[55:13] consider the wear and tear the brain
[55:14] this Rider amen the continual evolution
[55:17] of thought the daily anxiety of mind and
[55:19] against this set all renewing energy of
[55:21] the Holy Ghost who gives strength day by
[55:24] day repairing the waste of faculty and
[55:26] renewing the resources of power now I
[55:30] want to just give you this definition
[55:32] here of the word intellectually amen it
[55:34] means in a way that relates to your
[55:36] ability it is a way that relates to your
[55:39] ability to think and understand things
[55:42] amen especially complicated ideas amen
[55:45] now if you if You' lived more than two
[55:47] seconds on the earth amen you've run
[55:49] into some complicated times you run into
[55:51] some complicated situations amen but
[55:54] here he's saying amen do not become
[55:57] consumed intellectually amen with the
[55:59] situation because when you become
[56:01] consumed intellectually what you do is
[56:04] you replace the Divine ability amen with
[56:07] your own human ability see what begins
[56:09] to happen is you begin to think how can
[56:11] I work this out how can I fix this amen
[56:14] how can I change this amen and you
[56:16] become consumed that you forget
[56:17] everything amen that you ought to
[56:19] remember and you remember everything
[56:21] that you ought to forget amen that's why
[56:23] we're not here amen serving God B off of
[56:26] an intellectual conception Amen brother
[56:29] said I'm astonished in this day and have
[56:31] always been when people profess to be
[56:33] Christian and the first little little
[56:35] trial comes they fall by the wayside it
[56:37] goes to show that it was an intellectual
[56:40] conception of Christ that's the reason
[56:42] so many don't hold out today is because
[56:44] it's an intellectual conception
[56:46] intellectually you could believe it but
[56:49] it goes further than Nazi Amen to accept
[56:52] Christ is to accept the person of Christ
[56:55] amen so to accept Christ amen is to
[56:57] accept the person he said many of us
[56:59] accept religion of Christianity upon the
[57:01] learning of Creeds others accept
[57:03] Christianity upon the doctrines of
[57:05] baptism amen some on the emotion they
[57:07] have exercised such as shouting or
[57:09] dancing the spirit speaking in tongues
[57:11] having marvelous gifts to present amen
[57:14] all those things are good in their place
[57:16] amen but to accept Christ is to accept
[57:18] the person it's then these other things
[57:21] just automatically fall in line amen so
[57:24] if you get him amen then the shouting
[57:26] will come amen if you get him then the
[57:28] dancing will come if you get him then
[57:31] the gifts will come if you get him amen
[57:33] then the revelation will come listen
[57:35] without Christ amen we're just a group
[57:37] of people gathered in a building amen
[57:40] but if Christ comes on the scene amen he
[57:42] has the potential Amen to change every
[57:45] heart to heal every body to save every
[57:47] life listen friends I'm talking about a
[57:49] God who still has the ability to defy
[57:53] amen the odds against you and say but if
[57:55] I for them then who can be against them
[57:58] amen listen because God Amen has always
[58:01] sought man it's never been man seeking
[58:03] God it's always been God seeking man and
[58:07] I want to say this you can run but you
[58:09] can't hide amen you can say you're going
[58:11] to quit but you can't amen cuz you
[58:13] didn't start yourself and you can't
[58:15] finish yourself amen but God on the day
[58:17] of Pentecost started this church amen
[58:20] and there ain't enough criticisms there
[58:21] ain't enough intellectuals there ain't
[58:23] enough Devils of forms and rituals Amen
[58:25] to defeat seek God in his work of
[58:27] redemption in the age we're living in
[58:30] amen God is seeking somebody amen who
[58:32] will believe him not intellectually but
[58:35] from the heart he said now see he may be
[58:38] intellectually believe in God but when
[58:40] he believes from his heart he is
[58:42] converted and becomes a member of the
[58:44] body of Christ when he is converted from
[58:47] his heart and not from his intellects
[58:49] said look before they could see the
[58:51] Miracles amen they had to come the
[58:53] provided approach before they could see
[58:56] leave the Red Sea open amen they had to
[58:58] be a partaker amen of the provided
[59:01] approach amen of the Divine approach or
[59:03] the Divine articles amen now remember
[59:06] brother said the only way to obtain
[59:08] Mercy amen is to follow the instructions
[59:11] that will literally release Mercy into
[59:13] your life and I want to say this message
[59:15] amen is not legalism amen this message
[59:18] is not a bunch of Dos and don't and go
[59:20] here and don't go there amen but this
[59:22] message is the instructions amen from
[59:25] the Lamb of God who is come in this
[59:27] generation listen hey if God is rich in
[59:30] Mercy then he's able to change every
[59:32] home he's able to change every life
[59:35] listen I believe it friends I believe
[59:36] that God has unlimited money amen can I

[1:04:27] Revelation something happened and it was
[1:04:30] not by intellect it was by Revelation he
[1:04:33] said now intellectual is all right you
[1:04:35] can receive the word intellectually but
[1:04:38] let it soak down through the heart amen
[1:04:40] that's where it begins to read the
[1:04:42] results so when the word gets in the
[1:04:45] heart is when the word begins to see
[1:04:48] amen and you begin to see the results
[1:04:50] now amen I believe that the Holy Spirit
[1:04:52] speaks amen of this end time that we're
[1:04:54] living in brother I believe it speaks of
[1:04:56] it being amen an intellectual time you
[1:04:59] know the prod of God said you want to
[1:05:00] put some scriptures down here it's
[1:05:02] Matthew 24 and it's 2 Timothy 3:1 the
[1:05:05] Holy Spirit speaks amen of a great
[1:05:08] intellectual age at the end time did you
[1:05:11] know that amen why is it see he said
[1:05:13] Joseph I think he's speaking of Bose
[1:05:15] you've traveled with me much here in the
[1:05:16] nation you've heard the meetings
[1:05:18] overseas I go overseas and have 150
[1:05:21] 200,000 500,000 and the people just one
[1:05:25] thing you see every day that the
[1:05:27] meetings goes on nearby here in the
[1:05:28] Tabernacle up to 10 20 and 30,000 amen
[1:05:32] will fall from their feet amen and they
[1:05:34] will praise God they see it what's the
[1:05:37] matter don't take place in America it's
[1:05:39] the intellectual time they want someone
[1:05:42] who can speak amen not of judgment amen
[1:05:45] not of these things because it breaks
[1:05:47] them up from their fellowship with their
[1:05:49] clubs and their lodges amen and the
[1:05:51] ungodly things that they belong to
[1:05:53] therefore if their Pastor would name
[1:05:55] something like like this amen the Deacon
[1:05:57] board would have him out real quick see
[1:05:59] amen and put some Ricky in amen because
[1:06:01] that's what they're wanting amen now
[1:06:03] watch friends we're living in a Time
[1:06:05] amen where the prophet of God now this
[1:06:06] was all the way back in the 50s and 60s

[1:06:26] God Amen come on it's not because one's
[1:06:28] in America and one's in Africa or India
[1:06:30] or Europe it's because the age in the
[1:06:33] world we're living in the lid has come
[1:06:35] off of hell and demon powers have moved
[1:06:38] into religious Realms and they've
[1:06:40] invaded pulpits they've invaded

[1:07:16] it on to our ranks amen amen it used to
[1:07:18] be that church was where they preach the
[1:07:20] gospel amen but now intellectually amen
[1:07:22] we need to shut the preachers up and
[1:07:24] just press player put a t I'm going to
[1:07:26] get in trouble a and just shut all the
[1:07:28] ministry down amen it's intellectuals
[1:07:30] have invaded the puppet and we might as
[1:07:33] well say it amen when you bull it down
[1:07:35] to the bottom amen it's a devil trying
[1:07:37] to gain access to a church because if
[1:07:39] you silence the Watchman in the tower he
[1:07:42] will take over every inch of that church
[1:07:44] but I want to let that devil know I
[1:07:46] don't care how intellectual people
[1:07:48] become around this message I will stay
[1:07:51] amen with the spirit filled leadership
[1:07:53] of the Holy Ghost that is returned in
[1:07:55] this age to Lead Me amen there's a high
[1:07:58] calling upon my life I can't stay in
[1:08:00] leosa I can't stay in the world I got to
[1:08:03] go to where I come from I came from God
[1:08:07] and I got to go back to God and the only
[1:08:09] thing will take me there is the Holy
[1:08:11] Spirit and the power of his resurrection
[1:08:15] it's an intellectual age it's an
[1:08:16] intellectual time now you all know I'm
[1:08:18] preaching tonight amen we don't have
[1:08:20] sermons no more we have intellectual
[1:08:22] speeches
[1:08:25] come on church amen the preach of the
[1:08:28] Gospel has been reduced down to a few
[1:08:30] good points you know well here's a few
[1:08:33] good that's what brother said that's
[1:08:35] what got the church in trouble today is
[1:08:37] too many educated preachers without
[1:08:39] being born of the spirit men and women
[1:08:42] like to listen to intellectual speeches
[1:08:45] in the stead of preaching amen the power
[1:08:48] and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:08:50] amen I want to say this and I say it
[1:08:52] without one hesitation I am a firm
[1:08:54] believer in the power of his
[1:08:56] resurrection I believe it has the power
[1:08:59] to save I believe it has the power to
[1:09:01] heal I believe it has the power to
[1:09:03] change come on Friends somebody told me
[1:09:05] one time they said will you all say the
[1:09:07] power of his resurrection I said no Paul
[1:09:09] said that and a Prophet come and showed
[1:09:12] us that's where the power was laying was
[1:09:14] in the ability Amen to raise again on
[1:09:17] the third day listen that's what got us
[1:09:19] in trouble he said we don't need any
[1:09:21] more high schools or educated preachers
[1:09:23] what we need is God call called men
[1:09:26] that's filled with the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:28] not some man-made Theology of some
[1:09:31] denomination intellectual speeches are
[1:09:34] deceptive amen can I preach tonight amen
[1:09:37] they are deceptive and what they do amen
[1:09:39] is they bring the church into a state of
[1:09:42] deception then the enemy comes in and
[1:09:44] don't knowbody how to deal with the
[1:09:46] devil amen because there's nothing in
[1:09:48] the intellectual speeches that will
[1:09:50] anoint them to break the power of that
[1:09:51] devil but in a good oldfashioned Holy
[1:09:54] Ghost inspired ser
[1:09:55] Mark 16 said they shall lay hands on the
[1:09:58] sick and they shall recover I don't
[1:10:01] believe it's time to put up with Devils
[1:10:03] I believe it's time to put out the devil
[1:10:05] I don't believe it's time to put up with
[1:10:07] Spirits I believe it's time to defeat
[1:10:09] the Spirits by the preaching of the
[1:10:11] message of the hour listen I will not
[1:10:13] lay down my Bible and let some polished
[1:10:16] up intellectual speech amen become my
[1:10:18] voice I'm going to say what a prophet
[1:10:20] said Till every devil backs up because
[1:10:23] I'm living in the hour of fulfillment
[1:10:25] when God promised a restoration Joel
[1:10:27] 2:23 he said be glad then amen ye
[1:10:31] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[1:10:32] your God for he hath given you the
[1:10:35] former Reign
[1:10:37] moderately and he will cause to come
[1:10:40] down for you the rain the former rain
[1:10:42] and the latter rain in the first month
[1:10:46] said the former rain means a rain of
[1:10:47] teaching and the second rain is the rain
[1:10:50] of the spirit that comes upon what's
[1:10:52] been taught amen and produces the crop
[1:10:55] now the first rain is a teaching rain
[1:10:57] but the second rain amen is a harvest
[1:11:00] rain so if the seed that's been taught
[1:11:03] is good seed then when the rain begins
[1:11:05] to fall amen the rain will bring a
[1:11:08] harvest to The Good Seed watch why it
[1:11:11] we've had such a Revival amen
[1:11:13] Pentecostal Baptist all of the trees put
[1:11:14] out their buds as Jesus said they would
[1:11:17] and what if we hatched out the Baptist
[1:11:18] they got a million more than 44 look at
[1:11:21] the Catholic how they increase look at
[1:11:22] the nomination look at Pentecost what do
[1:11:24] we do we seow denominational seeds amen
[1:11:28] and we reap denominational Harvest amen
[1:11:30] why the church ought to be on fire for
[1:11:32] God right now if there's ever been a
[1:11:34] word seed sold back there there would be
[1:11:36] signs and wonders and miracles and the
[1:11:39] church would be together amen with one
[1:11:41] heart and one Accord amen marching
[1:11:44] toward Zion for the Rapture but what did
[1:11:46] we do we had intellectual speeches Amen
[1:11:49] in the stead of the word listen friends
[1:11:52] intellectual speeches amen is not the
[1:11:54] teacher rain or the teaching rain of
[1:11:57] Joel too because my Prophet said is this
[1:11:59] okay brother Sean my Prophet said when
[1:12:01] the Harvest rain falls it will cause a
[1:12:04] growth now come on I believe in good
[1:12:06] Bible teaching amen and I believe that
[1:12:08] God can anoint men to teach amen but if
[1:12:10] you're going to teach teach what a
[1:12:12] prophet taught am I know not everybody
[1:12:14] preaches like me or preaches like
[1:12:15] brother Sean or screams like brother
[1:12:17] Amos and shouts are you hearing me we're
[1:12:19] all different amen but let me say this
[1:12:21] if a man's going to be a teacher amen
[1:12:23] teach a seed amen that when the Holy
[1:12:25] Ghost moves on and advances or the
[1:12:27] Dynamics Begin to Fall amen the gas
[1:12:30] won't sputter but there'll be a fire
[1:12:32] that can burn come on y'all know what
[1:12:33] I'm talking about amen are you hearing
[1:12:35] me Amen brother amamos you may go into
[1:12:37] church sometime and preach amen and you
[1:12:39] start preaching and everybody starts
[1:12:41] shouting and rejoicing and the pastor
[1:12:43] sitting there saying man amen I ain't
[1:12:44] never seen this amen it ain't that the
[1:12:46] pastor's useless amen it's that the
[1:12:49] pastor has been laying in good seed amen
[1:12:52] then when the Rain Begin to Fall for the
[1:12:54] preaching of the Dynamics of the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost amen there was a combustion took
[1:12:58] place and there was a Revival broke out
[1:13:00] in the heart listen I think it's time to
[1:13:02] let Revival burn more than just once a
[1:13:05] year or twice a year I think we ought
[1:13:07] let the Revival of the Bride amen burn
[1:13:10] every day burn every hour burn every day
[1:13:12] of Our Lives hey this ain't just a
[1:13:14] one-year camp meeting this ain't just a
[1:13:16] oneye special week amen it's a Revival
[1:13:19] fires of God bringing forth a harvest
[1:13:22] amen of the word I'll say what a prophet
[1:13:25] said I don't believe in intellectual
[1:13:28] speeches I think we got that point home
[1:13:30] let's move on I believe in the word
[1:13:32] itself then stay with that promise Until
[1:13:36] It's Made manifest and fulfilled then
[1:13:38] you've got it the brother said the
[1:13:40] church today somebody say today needs
[1:13:43] the power and Truth again now I'll say
[1:13:46] this the opening of the word amen is the
[1:13:49] restoring of the original Power and
[1:13:51] Truth in other words to the church when
[1:13:54] the seal come open when the word was
[1:13:57] revealed it was more than an
[1:13:59] intellectual conception it was the
[1:14:01] promise of the restoration amen of what
[1:14:04] the cankerworm and the pmer worm and the
[1:14:06] caterpillar and the Locust eat away in
[1:14:08] Daniel 12:4 thou oh Daniel shut up the
[1:14:10] words amen and seal the book even to the
[1:14:13] time of the end for many shall run to
[1:14:15] and fro now watch this and knowledge
[1:14:18] shall be increased there no reason why
[1:14:21] that the age we're living in would not
[1:14:23] be consumed intellectually because it's
[1:14:25] the age when knowledge is increasing
[1:14:28] Daniel said in that day they would run
[1:14:29] to and fro knowledge shall increase the
[1:14:32] wise shall know their God in that day
[1:14:34] and they shall do great exploits amen
[1:14:36] but the wicked will not know amen the
[1:14:39] god of Heaven listen the wicked knows
[1:14:41] the god of denomination they know the
[1:14:43] god of Education they know the god of
[1:14:46] society they know the god of politics
[1:14:48] amen but they don't know brother shemiah
[1:14:51] amen the god of Heaven amen because they
[1:14:53] did not come from Heaven and the there's
[1:14:55] not a pull to go back to Heaven listen
[1:14:57] that's why oh I feel like preaching
[1:14:59] right now that's why with all the
[1:15:00] advancements of Technology it does not
[1:15:03] satisfy the thirst of the Bride to leave
[1:15:06] leosia come on church amen is it's okay
[1:15:09] to preach amen some of you all come in
[1:15:11] the message when they were still washing
[1:15:13] Amen on washboards Amen no offense
[1:15:16] that's what was happening amen there was
[1:15:17] no technology and here you are years
[1:15:20] later and there's all kinds of gadgets
[1:15:22] technology and you're still talking
[1:15:24] about a future home you're still talking
[1:15:26] about a place amen where there is no
[1:15:28] technology where there is no science
[1:15:30] where there is no devil you know why
[1:15:32] because you're not a seed amen of
[1:15:35] civilization of this Earth you have come
[1:15:37] from God and you got to go back to God
[1:15:40] and so God will not allow science he
[1:15:42] will not allow politics come on church
[1:15:44] he will not let nothing amen suppress or
[1:15:47] subdue amen the thought of your heart of
[1:15:50] going to
[1:15:52] heaven come on now I'm going to say it

[1:23:02] Ghost Hallelujah somebody shout
[1:23:05] amen you say well that sounds mythical
[1:23:08] he said it may be but listen it's real
[1:23:12] he said I believe it right here in the
[1:23:13] presence of his beings tonight in his
[1:23:15] sight we are all ready
[1:23:18] glorified those who he justified he ha
[1:23:22] past tense glorified
[1:23:25] and what makes you a Christian is
[1:23:27] because and long for that Perfection is
[1:23:30] because the Perfection are y'all hear me
[1:23:32] tonight how let me just get a show of
[1:23:34] hands how many's longing for that
[1:23:36] Perfection you're longing for that place
[1:23:38] where there is no old age where there is
[1:23:40] no sickness brother Terry where there is
[1:23:42] no evils that exist you're longing for
[1:23:45] that place then hear a prophet amen the
[1:23:47] reason you're longing for that place is
[1:23:49] because it's laying right out there that
[1:23:52] glorified body when this one is has
[1:23:54] moved out you move into that one come on
[1:23:58] it's just a move friends when this one

[1:24:03] God is eternal he was that perfect
[1:24:06] perfect love perfect peace perfect Joy
[1:24:08] perfect satisfaction he said see now the
[1:24:11] only way we can come back to Perfection
[1:24:13] is to come back with that Perfection
[1:24:16] which is god listen then we come to
[1:24:18] Perfection then we have eternal life
[1:24:22] Without End or without anything it's
[1:24:24] just forever it's eternal life see the
[1:24:27] Perfection of perfection is God now can
[1:24:30] I say this and I'm turning the corner
[1:24:31] the reason why these things are so
[1:24:34] important amen sometimes people say well
[1:24:36] I don't know why they preach against
[1:24:37] psychology I don't know why they preach
[1:24:39] against intellectualism I don't really
[1:24:40] see the point why they go those places
[1:24:43] because you're in a battle that's right
[1:24:46] you're in a battle and it's called the
[1:24:48] greatest battle that's ever been fought
[1:24:50] now listen the pr of God said that was
[1:24:52] ever fought is now ready to go in action
[1:24:55] amen I believe that God has been
[1:24:57] selecting his soldiers and I believe
[1:25:00] he's been dressing them he's been
[1:25:02] training them when this great battle
[1:25:04] started on Earth then there had to be a
[1:25:06] mutual meeting place brotherus I just
[1:25:08] love that quote there had to be a place
[1:25:11] selected amen for the battle to begin
[1:25:14] and for the battle to rage and the
[1:25:16] battle begins right here in the human
[1:25:18] mind that's where the battle starts the
[1:25:21] human mind was chosen amen for the place
[1:25:24] of the the battle where it was to begin
[1:25:26] and that is because that decisions amen
[1:25:28] are made from the mind the head can I
[1:25:31] say this tonight friends you are the
[1:25:33] army of the living Gods you are the
[1:25:36] soldiers who know him you know the god
[1:25:39] of Heaven not by a ritual not by a form

[1:25:46] hour when perfect interpretation of the
[1:25:49] word has come into your life you know
[1:25:52] him in the way of perfection and you
[1:25:54] know him in the power of his
[1:25:57] resurrection listen what the prophet
[1:25:59] said you promised Lord in the last day
[1:26:01] that that would take place we read in
[1:26:03] the Book of Revelation at the leoan
[1:26:05] church age that the intellectual Giants

[1:26:11] Plum out of his church now come on I'm
[1:26:14] preaching to you now amen at the End of
[1:26:16] the leoan Age the intellectual Giants
[1:26:18] come in the church and they pushed
[1:26:20] Christ right out of his church he said
[1:26:22] and he was standing knocking at the door
[1:26:23] of his own house
[1:26:24] amen trying to get back in amen oh God

[1:27:02] harnessed to the word of God which is
[1:27:04] the perfect interpretation with Divine
[1:27:07] Vindication that's why you can't say
[1:27:09] anything but what a prophet said that's
[1:27:11] why you can't believe anything but what
[1:27:13] a prophet taught because it's the only
[1:27:16] thing we can stand back and say it's
[1:27:19] perfect it's

[1:28:47] knows something about the message are

[1:28:51] been there and knows what is to come
[1:28:54] amen I just amen it just kind of struck
[1:28:56] me it may sound silly brother Sean amen
[1:28:57] it just kind of struck me amen down
[1:28:59] there in the in the in the basement a
[1:29:00] minute ago in the office I got to

[1:29:45] follow me or follow somebody who's
[1:29:47] guessing and think come on church are
[1:29:49] you hearing me amen I'm not guessing
[1:29:52] where the candy is I'm not thinking and
[1:29:54] I know where the candy is I saw with his
[1:29:56] eyes where the candy was and William
[1:29:59] Brandon was not guessing where your
[1:30:00] theophany was he was not probing where
[1:30:03] your theophany was he went beyond the
[1:30:05] curtain of time and he said I saw you
[1:30:08] there and he come back and laid the way
[1:30:10] of perfection and said if you want to
[1:30:11] see your mama come follow me if you want
[1:30:14] to see your loved ones come follow me if
[1:30:16] you want to see the future home come
[1:30:19] follow me I didn't hear about it I
[1:30:21] didn't read about it I saw it face to
[1:30:23] face
[1:30:25] Hallelujah I saw it for myself friends
[1:30:28] are you hearing me if you want to become
[1:30:30] consumed intellectually then follow
[1:30:32] somebody that thinks they know where
[1:30:33] it's at but if you want to walk in the
[1:30:35] way of perfection then follow the voice
[1:30:38] of perfection through the seventh
[1:30:41] angel I know where it's at I seen
[1:30:47] it I seen it I didn't hear about it I
[1:30:50] saw it I didn't just read about it I saw
[1:30:53] it
[1:30:54] now the word of the Lord comes to the
[1:30:56] prophet right brother said Noah was sent
[1:30:58] to a scientific age with an unscientific
[1:31:01] message Noah was sent to an intellectual
[1:31:03] age with an unintellectual message he
[1:31:06] was sent to an age of
[1:31:08] science oh when he had a message of
[1:31:12] faith and promise to a scientific
[1:31:14] age
[1:31:16] Noah was preaching a message of Promise
[1:31:21] a message of Faith to people who were
[1:31:24] consumed
[1:31:26] intellectually they were consumed with
[1:31:29] The Radars Sister Kim they were consumed
[1:31:32] with the fact that they could shoot a
[1:31:33] radar up there and there was no rain in
[1:31:35] the skies they were consumed with the
[1:31:38] intellectual facts about how you build
[1:31:40] an ark brother Tim and they knew that
[1:31:42] there's no way what Noah's building can
[1:31:44] survive what he says is coming but
[1:31:47] here's the difference amen there was a
[1:31:49] revelation that had come into Noah's
[1:31:51] heart and the prophet of God said before
[1:31:54] he started working on the ark he already
[1:31:56] oh God he already started amen seeing
[1:32:00] the
[1:32:01] rainfall did y'all hear that before he
[1:32:04] started working he saw the rain falling
[1:32:08] before he started building the ark he
[1:32:10] saw the rain was going to come so what
[1:32:12] Noah did was Noah relied upon the
[1:32:15] mercies of God that were new every
[1:32:18] morning come on Church you imagine
[1:32:20] brother Shan Noah out there working on
[1:32:22] that Ark and what is it tracks on the
[1:32:24] mountain brother said the daddy would
[1:32:25] bring their family over there and if
[1:32:27] they wanted a good laugh in the evening
[1:32:29] he said they would stand there and they
[1:32:31] would laugh at brother Noah that was
[1:32:33] working on the ark you know why they
[1:32:35] were laughing is because they were
[1:32:38] consumed
[1:32:40] intellectually they were consumed with
[1:32:42] their own ability to survive and end
[1:32:45] deluvian destruction but you know what
[1:32:47] got Noah back out there every day
[1:32:49] brother shemi hammering away was because
[1:32:52] the mercy of the Lord was new every
[1:32:55] morning God knew them people were going
[1:32:57] to drown God knew that nation was going
[1:32:59] under and God imparted that Revelation
[1:33:02] into a man named Mo Noah and he went out

[1:35:57] urgent the time is at hand what are you
[1:36:02] saying can I can I close on this
[1:36:06] point I keep preaching a minute then the
[1:36:09] mercy of God called us out of the Leota
[1:36:14] Spirit called us out of
[1:36:17] Babylon out of the spirit of confusion
[1:36:21] Proverbs 16:6 by Mercy are y'all ready
[1:36:24] for this by Mercy and Truth iniquity is
[1:36:31] purged I read that brother Terry I about
[1:36:33] shouted by Mercy and Truth iniquity is
[1:36:38] purged and by the fear of the Lord men
[1:36:42] depart from evil evil in Revelation 18:1
[1:36:45] after these things I saw another Angel
[1:36:46] come down from heaven having great power
[1:36:49] and the Earth was lighted with his glory
[1:36:51] and he cried mildly with a strong voice
[1:36:53] saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is
[1:36:55] fallen and has become the habitation of
[1:36:58] devils and the hold of every foul
[1:37:01] spirit and a cage of every unclean and
[1:37:04] hateful
[1:37:05] bird now watch this for all nations
[1:37:08] somebody say all have drunk of the wine
[1:37:11] of the wrath of her fornication and the
[1:37:13] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:37:15] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:37:17] of the Earth are waxed Rich through her
[1:37:20] abundance of Delicacies are you hearing
[1:37:22] me there intellectually consumed through
[1:37:25] the abundance of leota's Delicacies
[1:37:28] they're consumed through the abundance
[1:37:30] of what Babylon has to offer but I heard
[1:37:33] another voice from Heaven Hallelujah I
[1:37:36] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:37:38] come out of her my people that you be
[1:37:41] not partakers of her sin and that you
[1:37:44] receive not of her plagues are you all
[1:37:45] ready for this for her sins have reached
[1:37:48] under heaven and God hath remembered her
[1:37:52] iniquities but do you realize according
[1:37:54] to Hebrews amen that our iniquities are
[1:37:57] remembered no more glory to God our
[1:38:00] iniquities brother brother Tim our
[1:38:02] iniquities are remembered no more God
[1:38:05] remembers babylon's iniquities he
[1:38:07] remembers her sins but there's a
[1:38:09] virtuous sinless Bride on the face of
[1:38:11] the Earth who has received the perfect
[1:38:14] interpretation of the future home and it
[1:38:17] is ignited a Revival in her soul and God
[1:38:20] has forgot her iniquities he's thrown
[1:38:22] her sins in the see a forgetfulness
[1:38:24] brother Terry if anybody got a righteous
[1:38:26] shout and dance is the Bride of Jesus

[1:48:32] stand in your mirror cuz I was born in

[1:57:30] preaching about the Lord wants you on
[1:57:32] fire and he wants you fully surrendered
[1:57:34] the scepter is in your hand and I Sister

[1:57:49] that I literally just accepted that this
[1:57:50] is the way people are and ought to see
[1:57:52] it and she said you know how I got here
[1:57:55] she said the devil told me it's okay

[1:58:12] and said but I was not promised the
[1:58:14] spirit of the age because the spirit of
[1:58:16] the age is not the promise of Luke 24
[1:58:19] she said I was promised the spirit of my
[1:58:21] father oh God and I watch the mercy of

[2:00:09] life aren't you glad for the mercies of
[2:00:13] God Amen certainly enjoyed the service
[2:00:17] tonight sometimes
[2:00:20] we we just forget what God has really
[2:00:23] done for us and what he continues to do
[2:00:27] for us that we're standing here not by
[2:00:29] our own will
[2:00:31] power but it's by the mercy of the
[2:00:34] Lord I truly believe it's the mercy of
[2:00:37] the Lord that led us to this
[2:00:39] message and whether you're were
[2:00:43] born into it as far as raised in the
[2:00:47] message or you come from a different
[2:00:50] background it's still the mercy of God
[2:00:53] that you can believe this
[2:00:55] message and I was talking to my wife the
[2:00:58] other night and it I don't know I it
[2:01:02] really hit me of just the grace of God
[2:01:04] upon my life and but I I remember you
[2:01:08] know we were raised more in the
[2:01:10] Pentecostal and uh rim and I my dad had
[2:01:16] I remember him listening to some tapes
[2:01:20] of brother brandom occasionally not much
[2:01:23] uh but uh occasionally he would listen
[2:01:25] to him but we were never taught about
[2:01:28] brother brandom never really understood
[2:01:31] anything about brother brandom I didn't
[2:01:33] know really who he was and uh but I
[2:01:36] remember as was uh dating a girl and
[2:01:39] thought I thought I'd marry her uh you
[2:01:43] know and I I don't know 17 18
[2:01:47] and and uh I remember somehow the the
[2:01:52] brother bram's name came up that she
[2:01:53] brought up brother bram's name and it
[2:01:57] was really in a derogatory
[2:02:00] way and I said have you ever heard heard
[2:02:03] him oh no no said uh I just my mom and
[2:02:09] saying some things and and basically was
[2:02:13] just saying he was a fraud and da d da
[2:02:17] and you know I I I like I said I I
[2:02:21] didn't know much about him or anything
[2:02:24] and and I told her I
[2:02:27] said our relationship is
[2:02:30] over and she's like huh I said it's it's
[2:02:34] over she why what what did I say I said
[2:02:38] you spoke against William
[2:02:41] brandham and and and I said I don't know
[2:02:44] much about him either
[2:02:46] but you ain't going to talk to him about
[2:02:49] him like that to me and she pleaded and
[2:02:52] pleaded and it was over it was done I
[2:02:55] mean just right then you know and I I
[2:02:58] couldn't understand that but I remember
[2:03:01] later on few years later uh
[2:03:06] dad's kin some of his kin was Assemblies
[2:03:09] of God and and they were uh really
[2:03:13] pulling on me uh because of the young
[2:03:15] people and things like that so I started
[2:03:18] going over there you know to their youth
[2:03:21] nights and things like that
[2:03:23] and I was leaving one night and to go
[2:03:28] and I just and I really thank God for my
[2:03:32] dad but he just looked at me he said
[2:03:36] Sean I said yeah he said brother Brown
[2:03:39] said them are clubs they're not
[2:03:42] churches and he just went on his way but
[2:03:44] that struck me so
[2:03:48] hard I just walked away from him
[2:03:52] and I thought I thank God for a
[2:03:54] dad that would just let me know but more
[2:03:57] than that I'm so glad that God struck my
[2:04:00] heart I still didn't even know about
[2:04:02] brother Brandon it was few years later
[2:04:06] that I got married
[2:04:07] and I think Seth was
[2:04:11] born when the Lord started dealing with
[2:04:14] me
[2:04:15] and we started trying to find a way both
[2:04:19] me and my wife she was raised in a
[2:04:20] Pentecostal
[2:04:22] trinitarian you know anyway her her
[2:04:25] experience but we just started trying to
[2:04:28] find a way to uh know more about brother
[2:04:32] brandom and God just opened the Avenue
[2:04:35] and we started getting the tapes and
[2:04:37] things but I can truly say it was the
[2:04:40] mercy of the Lord that's all I know it
[2:04:42] was just the mercy of God and my heart
[2:04:46] burns more and more not that we worship
[2:04:48] that
[2:04:49] man but we worship the god thought of
[2:04:52] that man and I'm I'm so thankful because
[2:04:55] now I
[2:04:56] look more and more I see people
[2:04:58] questioning what's going on in politics
[2:05:00] what's going on with the world and all
[2:05:02] that and my heart's rest assured I've
[2:05:05] got an absolute I've got the answers and
[2:05:09] I so thank God for that I'm so glad that
[2:05:12] I can raise my children in in the
[2:05:15] message and know that God Vindicated it
[2:05:18] amen and it's absolutely the truth
[2:05:21] whether I understand it or not it is the
[2:05:23] truth can you say Amen you love the Lord
