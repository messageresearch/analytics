[38:29] but I will say I am doing better
[38:33] amen by the grace of God
[38:35] and so if you have your Bibles we're
[38:39] going to turn first of all to the Book
[38:41] of Proverbs
[38:43] and
[38:45] um
[38:50] got our meeting coming up and uh getting
[38:53] excited about it
[38:55] and we've already just seen the Lord
[38:57] moving yeah
[39:00] here and making
[39:04] way in in different areas and so
[39:07] just lets us know that the Lord Is With
[39:10] Us amen and so and I just really
[39:15] appreciate those of you that just
[39:17] excited about it amen and looking
[39:20] forward to what God has in store amen
[39:24] and got people just excited all over
[39:27] looking forward to great things
[39:30] and also we had uh talking to Brother
[39:33] Sam this morning and it was suggested
[39:36] and I think it was a good suggestion
[39:39] that brother Walker you know he's um
[39:43] been there in the nursing home and um
[39:49] it would be nice if if different ones of
[39:53] this could coordinate to see him every
[39:56] day just to cheer him up make sure that
[40:00] he is being taken care of and I know it
[40:03] is a lot on
[40:05] their daughter uh Carla having to take
[40:09] care of uh Sister Walker and sister
[40:12] Walker's pretty feeble herself and
[40:15] having to take her to different
[40:17] appointments and things and so there are
[40:20] days that she's not able to come and and
[40:24] um and so
[40:26] but if you would like to do that just to
[40:29] uh to help out just to visit you know
[40:34] um
[40:34] sometime in the week and 30 minutes or
[40:38] whatever
[40:39] any would be great and I know he would
[40:42] he would appreciate it and and just just
[40:47] to make sure that he's been taken care
[40:49] of you know and fed and whatever and I
[40:53] know I went there the other day and and
[40:55] someone's giving him you know he loves
[40:57] him pecan pies people giving him pecan a
[40:59] little pecan pies and there's a stack of
[41:01] them there was ants all over them and
[41:04] certainly don't want him eating ants you
[41:07] know and so
[41:09] um so you know I don't know how well you
[41:13] know he's taken care of I'm going to
[41:14] just believe that they're trying their
[41:16] best to take care of him but brother
[41:18] Walker is is part of us been here for
[41:22] many years and when the church was in a
[41:26] uh needing a pastor in a slump a lot of
[41:29] things going on brother Walker took it
[41:32] upon himself to try to help the church
[41:35] and he put us all into it and he
[41:39] actually developed shingles from it
[41:42] just a lot of pressure and but he was
[41:44] willing to do that for the sake of the
[41:46] church and I know he is he has been a
[41:51] tremendous support to me through through
[41:55] the thick and thin all the battles that
[41:58] this church has gone through and uh
[42:01] Walker always call me
[42:03] I got your back you know and and I'm
[42:06] with you so and that just meant so much
[42:10] to me and we want to have his back amen
[42:14] and help him and so we love brother and
[42:17] sister Walker and appreciate all that
[42:20] they've done for us amen
[42:23] and so you can talk with Brother Sam
[42:26] about that if you want to get with him
[42:28] and and say hey I'd like to come on a
[42:32] certain day or whatever and
[42:34] I think it'd be great
[42:37] um before we go into the word let's just
[42:39] bow our heads and talk to our father
[42:43] Lord Jesus
[42:46] as we approach your word now
[42:49] Father which is we believe to be the
[42:52] most important part of the service
[42:55] Lord for it's in your word that we find
[42:59] healing power we find The Virtue we find
[43:03] everything that we would have need of
[43:06] Lord is when you speak the word Lord and
[43:10] your spirit goes from that Lord upon the
[43:14] congregation I have seen eyes come open
[43:18] just through the preaching of the Gospel
[43:20] seen the lame walk seen things happen
[43:23] father
[43:24] and I know there's power in the word
[43:26] I've seen people get the Holy Ghost just
[43:29] through the preaching of the word
[43:31] Lord there's nothing impossible
[43:35] and I pray father that your anointing
[43:38] would just drop in now
[43:40] and Lord that you would anoint not only
[43:42] me but anoint the hearer of the word and
[43:45] may you have the preeminence in every
[43:48] heart this morning any spirit that would
[43:51] try to uh hinder the service that would
[43:55] take our thoughts away Lord I pray that
[43:57] you would just your angels would just
[44:00] stand by every Pew father and drive
[44:03] every demonic power away from this place
[44:07] we ask it father we love you we praise
[44:11] you and father as we would set up the
[44:14] tent this afternoon I pray that you
[44:16] would be with us give us help the grace
[44:18] father and let everything just go okay
[44:22] father and we're just looking forward to
[44:24] a wonderful time Lord in the meetings
[44:28] coming up we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[44:31] name and everyone says
[44:34] amen The Book of Proverbs
[44:38] we want to look
[44:40] first of all we've been reading this
[44:43] um
[44:45] and and I would start at the first verse
[44:49] the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David
[44:52] king of Israel
[44:53] to know wisdom and instruction to
[44:56] perceive the words of understanding to
[44:59] receive the instruction of wisdom
[45:01] Justice and judgment and equity
[45:05] to give subtility to the simple to the
[45:07] young man knowledge and discretion
[45:10] a wise man will hear and will increase
[45:13] learning in a man
[45:15] of understanding shall attain unto wise
[45:19] counsels to understand the proverb and
[45:22] the interpretation the words of the wise
[45:25] and their dark sayings
[45:27] the seventh verse here to focus on is
[45:31] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[45:33] knowledge but fools despise wisdom and
[45:37] instruction
[45:38] then I'm going to go to a familiar
[45:40] scripture and that's in Ephesians
[45:43] chapter 1. we've talked on it here
[45:49] in the past
[45:50] but the book of Ephesians
[45:58] and if I can find it here
[46:03] when I do I'll say Amen
[46:07] um praise the Lord
[46:11] amen got it
[46:13] so Ephesians 1 and
[46:17] um
[46:18] we're going to look
[46:20] um
[46:22] start at the 15th verse wherefore I also
[46:25] after I heard of your faith in the Lord
[46:27] Jesus and love unto all the saints cease
[46:30] not to give thanks for you making
[46:32] mention of you in my prayers
[46:34] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[46:37] the father of Glory may give unto you
[46:39] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[46:43] the knowledge of him
[46:46] the eyes of your understanding being
[46:48] enlightened that you may know what is
[46:51] the hope of his calling and what the
[46:54] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[46:56] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[47:00] greatness of his power to us word who
[47:03] believe according to the working of his
[47:06] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[47:09] when he raised him from the dead and set
[47:12] him at his own right hand in the
[47:15] Heavenly places far above all
[47:18] principality and power and might and
[47:21] dominion and every name that is named
[47:23] not only in this world but also in that
[47:27] which is to come and hath put all things
[47:31] under his feet and gave him to be the
[47:34] head over all things to the church which
[47:38] is his body everybody say which is his
[47:40] body
[47:41] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[47:46] all and that's the knowledge that Paul
[47:48] is praying that you have
[47:49] amen and then Romans 18 11
[47:55] familiar scripture that
[47:58] We Know by heart I guess that uh Romans
[48:03] 8 11.
[48:05] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[48:08] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[48:11] that raised up Christ from the dead
[48:13] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[48:16] his spirit that dwelleth in you amen you
[48:21] can have your seats this morning
[48:24] and as it's been mentioned we're you
[48:27] know this is the day of Easter then
[48:30] we have come just
[48:33] for many as a memorial
[48:36] and um
[48:38] but
[48:40] um we know that Easter is something
[48:42] special to us maybe in a different way
[48:47] um
[48:47] Easter of course speaks of the
[48:49] resurrection of Jesus Christ and so many
[48:53] are gathered this morning in their
[48:55] churches to
[48:58] um to honor the resurrection or to hold
[49:01] it as a memorial
[49:02] and um no doubt there are many that are
[49:07] giving an Easter play
[49:12] um and and
[49:14] that is to take us back in into time and
[49:20] give us a history lesson as to uh what
[49:26] happened two thousand years ago to let
[49:29] us know that he did rise from the grave
[49:32] and and that he is alive but but that
[49:37] that that gives us a knowledge but it's
[49:39] only a knowledge of History
[49:42] and you know don't don't get me wrong
[49:44] history is good it's it's good to know
[49:48] history it's needed because history
[49:51] helps us to identify uh with the past of
[49:55] what happened it by history we
[49:58] understand
[49:59] uh uh our day uh by certain events that
[50:03] took place in in the past and uh it
[50:08] helps us to understand the pattern of
[50:11] world events National events Church
[50:14] events
[50:16] um and and these things
[50:18] we find that there is a pattern of the
[50:22] rise and fall of Nations there is a
[50:25] pattern of the rise and fall of churches
[50:28] there is a pattern of Revival igniting
[50:33] and dying there is a pattern as to how
[50:37] the devil Works
[50:39] um so so with that we can can look back
[50:43] to history and understand uh
[50:46] really get a great better understanding
[50:49] of what is taking place in the age that
[50:52] we're living in and and even jesus takes
[50:56] things back into history and and he
[51:00] would tell us now as it was in the days
[51:02] of Noah so shall it be in in the coming
[51:05] of the son of man or the revealing as it
[51:08] was in the days of lot so he's given us
[51:11] a history lesson and and letting us know
[51:13] that you can go back in history and see
[51:15] what that was and then know the day that
[51:19] you're living in so we thank God for the
[51:21] history uh by history of the Bible we
[51:25] can identify as the prophet would tell
[51:27] us we can identify our present condition
[51:30] as individuals as a church Nation
[51:32] whatever with and and and with the
[51:35] characters of The Bible and of other
[51:38] ages so so again we can look at the
[51:42] characters that uh of past history in
[51:44] this Bible and we we can identify
[51:47] ourselves our character our actions and
[51:51] everything uh and and we can we can know
[51:54] as to what we are and uh by by that uh
[51:59] like like someone would say well if if I
[52:02] could just uh been back in when Jesus
[52:05] was alive and uh when he walked the
[52:08] Earth boy I would love him I I would oh
[52:11] man I wouldn't be no I wouldn't I
[52:13] wouldn't be no Judas that's for sure I I
[52:16] wouldn't be those people looking around
[52:18] saying well who is this as he's riding
[52:20] down fulfilling scriptures riding on the
[52:23] donkey and he's fulfilling what Isaiah
[52:26] said I sure wouldn't be that I'd be the
[52:28] one throwing the branches and all of
[52:29] that I'd be the one to recognize him
[52:32] well you know as as we find though that
[52:35] we have that opportunity just as they
[52:38] did in this age here because he's alive
[52:42] and so how we react to the to to him
[52:46] today would let us know what we would be
[52:49] back then uh uh and these things so uh
[52:53] uh but but having a knowledge of his
[52:57] resurrection of just uh 2 000 years ago
[53:02] it does not bring the fear of the Lord
[53:04] and this is what we had been talking
[53:05] about is that knowledge uh uh begins
[53:09] with the fear of the Lord
[53:11] um uh if any man has knowledge then then
[53:14] the beginning of that knowledge is the
[53:17] fear of the Lord and so then we find
[53:19] there's a certain knowledge that we must
[53:21] have and that's not a knowledge of what
[53:24] God was ain't that right amen because
[53:28] you know if he did rise 2 000 years ago
[53:33] and we say that he is alive today then
[53:37] we must ask where is he today ain't that
[53:40] right where is he today uh uh it's one
[53:44] thing to say he's alive but then while
[53:46] we're saying that we've never
[53:48] experienced his reality of being alive
[53:50] we've in and so therefore he just
[53:53] becomes a figment of our imagination and
[53:56] then if he's a figment of our
[53:58] imagination if we then all of our ritual
[54:01] religious rituals it means nothing it's
[54:04] just it's being done out of Duty if
[54:07] we're doing it all and never experience
[54:09] a living God today then then it's it's
[54:14] just a god of history and we everything
[54:17] we're doing is in honor of a god of
[54:19] yesterday and and these things but
[54:22] according uh to Hebrews 13 and 8 amen
[54:26] the Bible says he's the same yesterday
[54:29] today and forever Jesus Christ the same
[54:33] yesterday so if he is the same and if he
[54:37] is alive then what he was yesterday he
[54:40] is today he is his character his nature
[54:43] his power his attributes his love his
[54:47] his his his intimal uh innermost heart
[54:52] uh what he is what he he still is today
[54:56] do you believe that amen if he created
[54:59] back then he can do it today if he spoke
[55:02] the uh the word back then and the word
[55:06] had results it can happen today do you
[55:09] believe that amen if he walked on the
[55:11] water back then he can walk on the water
[55:13] today if he turned the water into wine
[55:16] he can do it again today if he calls the
[55:19] blind eyes to see back then he could do
[55:22] it today amen why he is the same person
[55:26] do you believe that amen now that's why
[55:28] we say he's alive and and if we really
[55:31] believe he's alive then it then we
[55:33] believe in the impossibility I don't
[55:36] care if the doctor says and and and uh
[55:38] that you're going to die tomorrow amen
[55:40] if we believe is a lie then we'll never
[55:43] listen to what that doctor says we'll
[55:45] look at the word of God and and say well
[55:48] you know what he raised Lazarus from the
[55:50] dead that had been four days from the
[55:52] dead so there's nothing impossible with
[55:55] God can you say amen amen so then we
[55:58] find that we're looking at this
[56:00] Resurrection amen and we find that
[56:03] Resurrection is not a replacement
[56:06] amen it's not a replacement but it means
[56:09] to bring the same thing amen back a man
[56:13] to life again that that which was bring
[56:18] that back to to reality or to life a man
[56:22] that which went down to be raised back
[56:25] up that which went away to bring it back
[56:28] again so we're not talking about a the
[56:32] Lutheran Church a man coming back to
[56:35] life we're not talking about the
[56:36] Pentecostal age coming back to life
[56:39] we're not talking about some Revival of
[56:42] yesterday coming back to life we're
[56:45] talking about his resurrection there is
[56:48] no Resurrection in some denomination
[56:50] there there there is no Resurrection in
[56:53] a Lutheran Revival there there is no rev
[56:56] uh Resurrection in a Pentecostal Revival
[56:59] you understand what I'm saying amen
[57:01] people say oh if we could go back to
[57:03] 1906 and uh to what they had back then
[57:06] there's no Resurrection for that amen
[57:09] we're talking about a different
[57:10] Resurrection can you say amen amen we're
[57:13] talking about the resurrection of Jesus
[57:16] Christ and so we're not wanting to know
[57:19] a church we're not wanting to to have an
[57:22] experience with the denomination we're
[57:24] not wanting to have an experience in
[57:27] some thing dangled way what we want to
[57:30] know is we want to know him he's the one
[57:33] that we declare to be alive he's the one
[57:35] that we need to declare that he has
[57:38] risen now this word to know is to have a
[57:42] a knowledge to know have a knowledge and
[57:45] so now the Bible just doesn't declare to
[57:49] us what he was two thousand years ago
[57:52] and it doesn't declare to us just what
[57:56] he is to be a man in the future but the
[57:59] Bible declares to us what He is today
[58:03] and I'll declare to you there are more
[58:06] scriptures that speak of this day than
[58:08] any other age amen that's that's right
[58:11] amen this speaks of his second coming a
[58:14] man more than his first coming ain't
[58:16] that right amen that's right and so it
[58:19] declares a man what he is today amen and
[58:24] and so you know the prophet told us that
[58:27] people always praise God for what he has
[58:30] done amen and that's good I'm glad what
[58:33] he did amen but we can put our focus on
[58:36] that amen and and and come up short amen
[58:40] and then man always praises God for what
[58:43] he's going to do amen which is good amen
[58:46] because we got a bright future amen but
[58:48] they failed to see what he's doing today
[58:51] a man is because a man they have a
[58:54] knowledge of what he has done and they
[58:57] have this knowledge in some form of what
[59:00] he's going to do amen but they don't
[59:03] have the knowledge of what he is doing
[59:06] present tense today ain't that right
[59:08] amen but we see we've got to have a
[59:11] knowledge for for the Bible says to know
[59:14] Christ is life he that hath the son has
[59:19] life ain't that right amen so we want to
[59:23] know Christ not as and yesterday not
[59:26] amen uh there's there's I'm gonna just
[59:30] say it there's not life in knowing
[59:32] Christ of what he was 2 000 years ago
[59:34] amen there's not life in what he's doing
[59:37] in in the future but to know him today
[59:41] is life to know what he is today to know
[59:45] what he's doing today is life ain't that
[59:49] right to know where he is today wherever
[59:52] he is there is life amen that's right
[59:55] and there's only one way to know him do
[59:58] you believe that only one way to know
[1:00:01] him is not by book learning not by
[1:00:04] reading the Bible amen every year
[1:00:06] through from Genesis to Revelation
[1:00:08] that's not the way to know him amen but
[1:00:11] here it is in Philippians 3 and 10. Paul
[1:00:15] says that I may know him and the power
[1:00:20] of his resurrection ain't that right
[1:00:23] that's the only way to know him and this
[1:00:25] word no now listen the word no means to
[1:00:30] perceive to understand to have a
[1:00:33] knowledge of to become acquainted with
[1:00:37] so not know of him Paul Paul didn't say
[1:00:41] I want to know of his resurrection a man
[1:00:44] I want to know about him his
[1:00:47] resurrection that he says I want to know
[1:00:50] him and the power of his resurrection
[1:00:53] now notice how brother Branham
[1:00:55] interprets the scripture of what Paul is
[1:00:58] saying I want to know him in the power
[1:01:02] of his resurrection can you say Amen now
[1:01:06] that's the only way to know him is when
[1:01:09] you know him in the power of his
[1:01:12] resurrection I can tell you that for 2
[1:01:16] 000 years I could tell you A Hundred
[1:01:18] Years or or for an eternity all about
[1:01:21] God that if you don't know him in his
[1:01:25] power of the Resurrection then you'll
[1:01:28] never know him can you say man so Easter
[1:01:32] is is is is is not just about 2 000
[1:01:35] years ago that Easter it means something
[1:01:38] personal to us can you say man as
[1:01:41] Believers now the prophet said the only
[1:01:44] thing you have to know everybody say the
[1:01:46] only thing I have to know
[1:01:48] the only thing you have to know is the
[1:01:51] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:01:53] Christ he said let me go with that that
[1:01:56] saved me from sin what saved you the
[1:01:58] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:02:00] Christ what redeemed you the power of
[1:02:03] the resurrection of Jesus Christ what
[1:02:05] delivered you the power of the
[1:02:07] resurrection of Jesus Christ what
[1:02:10] changed you from a sinner to a saint the
[1:02:12] power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:02:15] Christ amen now we're not talking about
[1:02:17] these old uh so-called Christians that
[1:02:19] still smoking their cigarettes and
[1:02:21] drinking her beer and having all these
[1:02:23] kinds of party and said I'm a Christian
[1:02:24] oh no no no no you got to know him in
[1:02:27] the power of his resurrection well what
[1:02:30] happened in his resurrection corruption
[1:02:32] tried to set in but there was a power
[1:02:35] that stopped that corruption and raised
[1:02:37] him into newness of life ain't that
[1:02:40] right and that same corruption amen sin
[1:02:42] is nothing but the power of Darkness sin
[1:02:45] is nothing but the power of corruption
[1:02:48] in your soul can you say Amen but let
[1:02:51] that power of Resurrection come into
[1:02:53] that Soul it'll stop that corruption
[1:02:55] right there amen and them cuss words
[1:02:58] amen will flee from you amen them evil
[1:03:01] thoughts them evil actions improversion
[1:03:03] amen can you say Amen it'll change you
[1:03:06] from a homosexual to a right person that
[1:03:09] you're supposed to be it'll change you
[1:03:11] from a transgender back to way God
[1:03:13] created you to be you've got to know him
[1:03:16] in the power of his resurrection
[1:03:21] know him
[1:03:23] it saved me from sin it'll heal my
[1:03:25] sickness and see that's all you have to
[1:03:27] know
[1:03:28] everybody say that's all I have to know
[1:03:30] is no hymn In The Power of his
[1:03:34] resurrection
[1:03:35] ain't that right so then what we're
[1:03:38] saying then is your knowledge then comes
[1:03:40] by experience your knowledge comes by
[1:03:44] experience not by book learning but now
[1:03:46] I know him that he's risen not because I
[1:03:50] saw an Easter play I know that he is
[1:03:53] risen not because my preacher told me he
[1:03:55] has risen I know that he has risen not
[1:03:58] because Mom and Dad just comes to church
[1:04:00] and tells me amen every day of my life
[1:04:02] that that he has risen but now I know
[1:04:05] him in the very power of his
[1:04:09] resurrection
[1:04:11] amen and when you know him in the power
[1:04:13] of his resurrection then then no one can
[1:04:15] convince you that he didn't raise
[1:04:17] you know that he rose
[1:04:19] you believe it with all your heart
[1:04:21] because you have experienced the same
[1:04:23] power
[1:04:24] [Applause]
[1:04:26] ain't that right so now your knowledge
[1:04:28] comes by experience
[1:04:32] experience it means this the fact or
[1:04:35] state of having been affected by or
[1:04:38] gained knowledge through direct
[1:04:40] observation or participation
[1:04:43] something personally encountered
[1:04:46] undergone or lived through that's that's
[1:04:49] what your knowledge is now it's an
[1:04:51] experience you personally have witnessed
[1:04:54] it you personally have gone through it
[1:04:56] you personally have have they
[1:04:58] experienced this and undergone and lived
[1:05:01] through this the act or process of
[1:05:04] directly perceiving events or reality so
[1:05:09] I know him by experience and that's the
[1:05:12] knowledge that we want to have amen amen
[1:05:16] now we we find that Bible scholars and
[1:05:18] theologians constantly ridicule brother
[1:05:21] Branham for not knowing how to to to
[1:05:24] talk right and to how to pronounce his
[1:05:28] his words correctly and things like that
[1:05:31] and his reply to them was this I wished
[1:05:35] I did no better words and grammar but if
[1:05:38] it's taking anything away from Jesus I'd
[1:05:41] rather know Jesus anytime and know him
[1:05:44] in the power of his resurrection can you
[1:05:48] say amen and I don't I don't want Pulpit
[1:05:50] manners if it's going to take me from
[1:05:52] the reality of Jesus Christ amen I I
[1:05:55] don't want Church manners if we don't
[1:05:57] know you know in other words get so
[1:05:59] formal to where we we know what to do
[1:06:01] and and how many songs to sing and well
[1:06:05] we can't go over the 15-minute Mark you
[1:06:07] know what I'm saying amen if that's
[1:06:09] going to take away from us knowing him
[1:06:11] in the resurrection power of his
[1:06:13] resurrection to where God can't move
[1:06:15] upon the sinner anymore that God can't
[1:06:18] feel with the Holy Ghost anymore and God
[1:06:20] can't do nothing because we've got a
[1:06:22] time schedule amen I'd rather take all
[1:06:25] of that away that I may know him and the
[1:06:28] power of his resurrection ain't that
[1:06:32] right amen so many young people this
[1:06:34] Young Generation amen they're they're
[1:06:36] missing out upon the experience of Jesus
[1:06:38] Christ amen because they got church
[1:06:41] orders and church this and church that
[1:06:43] Church format do away with your
[1:06:45] formality and get so loosed in God till
[1:06:48] God can have his way in your life amen
[1:06:51] to where God can get some time and to
[1:06:54] change you can you say amen that's right
[1:06:56] amen well it you know it's true anyway
[1:06:59] I'd rather know Jesus anytime a lot of
[1:07:02] time we make our church services so
[1:07:04] short amen that God you know it takes a
[1:07:08] lot longer time these days I really
[1:07:10] think amen for God to break through
[1:07:12] these these mind battles and that God to
[1:07:15] break through Amen to them heart hearts
[1:07:18] that God can break through Amen to the
[1:07:20] carnalism amen that we just put a time
[1:07:23] to God Amen and said and saying God we
[1:07:26] need you more than anything my children
[1:07:28] need you amen my neighbor needs you we
[1:07:32] need a move of God Amen and we need to
[1:07:35] know you in the power of your
[1:07:37] Resurrection
[1:07:39] ain't that right
[1:07:42] now so now listen it's not it's not to
[1:07:46] know him by his word
[1:07:50] Ram said that's a long way from being
[1:07:53] sufficient
[1:07:55] it's not know him by deed
[1:07:58] we got to know him by person of his
[1:08:02] resurrection
[1:08:03] now look look with me uh uh they'll put
[1:08:08] it on the screen I guess but second
[1:08:09] Corinthians 5 14. For the Love of Christ
[1:08:12] constraineth us
[1:08:14] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:08:17] for all then we're all dead
[1:08:21] and that he died for all that they which
[1:08:25] should live not henceforth
[1:08:28] uh unto themselves but unto him which
[1:08:31] died for them and rose again
[1:08:33] wherefore henceforth we know no man
[1:08:37] after the flesh
[1:08:38] yea though we have known Christ after
[1:08:40] the flesh yet now have since his
[1:08:43] resurrection we know him no more after
[1:08:46] the flesh
[1:08:48] the resurrection changed something did
[1:08:49] it not we thank God for the resurrection
[1:08:53] amen see Paul now the Apostle Paul was
[1:08:56] writing this we we no longer know Christ
[1:08:58] after the flesh not since he's risen
[1:09:00] from the dead amen and and and and so
[1:09:03] now the the Apostle Paul never knew
[1:09:06] Jesus in his physical manner in his
[1:09:09] physical form amen the only way he knew
[1:09:12] him was by a revelation by a vision amen
[1:09:16] and brother Brown said see Paul only
[1:09:18] knew Jesus by the Revelation just like
[1:09:20] Peter did amen now remember the
[1:09:23] Revelation is greater knowing him and
[1:09:25] the power of his resurrection is greater
[1:09:28] than even knowing him if he was sitting
[1:09:31] here in flesh and you were shaking his
[1:09:32] hand amen see amen because Jesus asked
[1:09:36] Peter he says whom do men say that I the
[1:09:38] son of man am or asked his disciples
[1:09:40] well everybody was guessing they saw him
[1:09:43] they ate with him they they they they
[1:09:46] slept maybe in the same area that that
[1:09:48] he was in they ate breakfast with him
[1:09:51] they prayed Amen to together amen
[1:09:54] whatever they done they watched him even
[1:09:56] do the Miracles and things but when he
[1:09:58] gave them the test and said who do men
[1:10:01] say that I am oh a lot of guesses well
[1:10:03] you're a good prophet and you're this
[1:10:05] one you're that and you're that but whom
[1:10:07] do you say that I am amen and Peter said
[1:10:09] Thou Art the Christ amen the son of the
[1:10:13] Living God Amen now listen now amen see
[1:10:16] he he had seen him in the flesh but now
[1:10:19] he knew him not after the flesh ain't
[1:10:22] that right he knew him in a greater way
[1:10:24] amen and notice amen Jesus said this he
[1:10:28] said
[1:10:29] Matthew 16 and and and uh uh we'll go to
[1:10:34] 17 in Matthew 16 17 and Jesus said unto
[1:10:38] him Peter blessed art thou Simon barjona
[1:10:41] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:10:44] this unto you now think of it amen he
[1:10:47] could have set here in flesh and he
[1:10:50] could have lived with them and stayed
[1:10:51] with them and done all kinds of signs
[1:10:53] and wonders with them amen and before
[1:10:56] them and yet it could not give them a
[1:10:59] greater Revelation because he couldn't
[1:11:01] know them after the flesh amen but he
[1:11:04] said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed
[1:11:07] this unto thee amen but my Father which
[1:11:10] is in heaven
[1:11:12] ain't that right
[1:11:14] amen so the prophet said even Jesus's
[1:11:18] own life amen there on Earth his works
[1:11:21] and all that did not reveal this to
[1:11:23] Peter
[1:11:24] amen Peter had walked with him talked
[1:11:27] with him touched him but he didn't know
[1:11:29] Christ by those things that's right see
[1:11:32] and so uh Paul had something greater
[1:11:35] amen uh than any of the uh uh the the
[1:11:38] apostles amen because even though he
[1:11:41] didn't walk with him
[1:11:43] excuse me even though he didn't walk
[1:11:45] with him and even though he didn't lay
[1:11:47] hands amen or or his physical Eyes Upon
[1:11:50] that physical being amen he knew him in
[1:11:54] a greater way
[1:11:57] amen the prophet said the the disciples
[1:12:00] could have said to Paul we have more of
[1:12:02] a revelation because we ate with him we
[1:12:03] sat by him
[1:12:05] amen we we've done all these things see
[1:12:07] we watched him perform but Prophet said
[1:12:09] that Paul saw him after he was dead
[1:12:13] buried and rose again and expressed
[1:12:16] himself in the pillar of fire that led
[1:12:18] the children of Israel
[1:12:20] can you say Amen
[1:12:22] so Paul Paul Paul uh had the same
[1:12:26] Revelation that Moses had Paul had the
[1:12:29] same Revelation all the way down Through
[1:12:30] the Ages
[1:12:31] saw him for what he was ain't that right
[1:12:34] didn't just build a memorial to a man as
[1:12:38] the people are doing today
[1:12:40] building a memorial to a man of 2000
[1:12:42] years ago amen but here we're finding
[1:12:45] out that we've seen Christ not after the
[1:12:48] flesh we're not knowing him after the
[1:12:50] flesh we're new with him by revelation
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:56] because Jesus promised to build his
[1:12:58] church upon Revelation Upon This Rock
[1:13:00] I'll build my church
[1:13:03] amen not upon an Easter play not on on
[1:13:06] an Easter egg
[1:13:08] not on a Memorial Day of Memorial unto
[1:13:10] me will I build my church but Upon This
[1:13:13] Rock upon this revelation of who I am
[1:13:15] will I build my church and the Gates of
[1:13:18] Hell cannot Prevail against it
[1:13:24] now
[1:13:26] brother Brown says now scholar can sit
[1:13:28] down and read that word till he can just
[1:13:30] tie your mind up in any way
[1:13:32] if he wants to do it because he's smart
[1:13:34] and Brilliant thank you
[1:13:36] yeah
[1:13:38] uh because he's smart and brilliant
[1:13:41] get a Catholic priest or not so much as
[1:13:44] that as a good trained Theologian in the
[1:13:47] Bible brother of Baptist or Presbyterian
[1:13:49] or something he'll make you think that
[1:13:51] you don't know nothing when it comes to
[1:13:53] talk what it's because that he has known
[1:13:56] him in the flesh his word ain't that
[1:13:58] right see the word so so brother Branham
[1:14:01] is telling us that you can take this
[1:14:03] Bible and you can read it over and over
[1:14:05] and be so skilled in this Bible a man
[1:14:07] but you can oh you're only knowing him
[1:14:09] in the flesh you understand what I'm
[1:14:12] saying
[1:14:13] and and that's what the scholars have
[1:14:15] done they've studied the Bible brother
[1:14:17] Brown even said he could take the
[1:14:18] Presbyterian Doctrine and tie the
[1:14:21] Pentecostals till they wouldn't know
[1:14:22] what to do he could take the Baptist
[1:14:24] Doctrine and show the Pentecostals a
[1:14:27] million things that they know nothing of
[1:14:28] he said but that's not it that's not his
[1:14:32] church
[1:14:33] can you say amen amen scholarly that's
[1:14:36] not his church dignified that's not his
[1:14:39] church that that that being all of these
[1:14:42] things Amen brother Brown said his
[1:14:44] church is himself revealed
[1:14:48] why because you're the body of the Lord
[1:14:51] Jesus Christ upon this Earth his church
[1:14:54] is himself revealed and expressed by the
[1:14:59] word itself that he is God I hope it's
[1:15:02] okay I hope it's making sense to you see
[1:15:04] so the only way that you can know him is
[1:15:07] by Revelation and he is the word of God
[1:15:10] Amen he is the word so it's the word
[1:15:13] revealed to you by revelation
[1:15:17] we're going to get to more into in just
[1:15:19] a moment the word revealed to you by
[1:15:21] Revelation now brother Branham asked the
[1:15:24] question then how do you know it's
[1:15:26] revealed to you notice what he says it
[1:15:29] lives itself and expresses himself
[1:15:32] through you
[1:15:33] now that's how we know that it's not
[1:15:35] just mental learning but it's actually
[1:15:37] by Revelation that we have received is
[1:15:40] because it lives the word lives through
[1:15:44] you
[1:15:47] oh my then see then it it makes us more
[1:15:51] than just a church member then it it
[1:15:53] makes this it makes us Stand Out than
[1:15:56] just the average Church goer no wonder
[1:15:58] church is so boring to many people is
[1:16:01] because they've never experienced the
[1:16:02] God Amen that the church talks about
[1:16:05] amen the church is not this building
[1:16:08] it's something that we have dedicated
[1:16:11] that that we could come together but
[1:16:13] we're the Church of the Living God we're
[1:16:15] the one that has the pillar fire living
[1:16:17] within us do you believe that amen see
[1:16:21] and so when we come together like this
[1:16:23] then the pillar of fire every one of us
[1:16:25] has brought a lick of fire together amen
[1:16:28] and deity is made known Amen in this
[1:16:31] place and church God should be able to
[1:16:34] do anything impossible in this place we
[1:16:37] should come with such an expectation
[1:16:39] because we know beyond a shot of Adele
[1:16:42] that he has risen he is alive because I
[1:16:45] brought him with how many he's brought
[1:16:47] him with you this morning I brought him
[1:16:49] with me amen that's why we could look at
[1:16:52] the challenges that we face and say I
[1:16:54] know God's going to make a way I know
[1:16:56] God is going to save I know that God is
[1:16:59] going to deliver I know he is alive he's
[1:17:03] alive and I've witnessed it I know him
[1:17:05] in the power of his resurrection if he
[1:17:08] saved me he can save you if he delivered
[1:17:11] me he can deliver you because I look at
[1:17:13] myself as the chief sinner of you amen
[1:17:15] if he can reach down and save a rotten
[1:17:18] ratchet Center like me I know he can
[1:17:20] save you
[1:17:24] I know he can do it
[1:17:26] can you say man
[1:17:28] see and so it's revealed how do we know
[1:17:30] it's living itself it's expressing God
[1:17:33] expressing himself through you
[1:17:36] now if you notice
[1:17:38] when John received the revelation of
[1:17:40] Jesus Christ
[1:17:41] he wasn't given a history lesson
[1:17:46] ain't that right
[1:17:47] this revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:17:49] Book of Revelations
[1:17:51] it was John receiving the revelation of
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ but he wasn't given a
[1:17:56] history lesson
[1:17:59] he didn't go back through memory lane
[1:18:01] and reminisce of all the experience he
[1:18:03] had with Jesus and what Jesus done and
[1:18:06] Jesus this and Jesus that no
[1:18:09] this is a greater revelation
[1:18:12] a greater revelation
[1:18:15] ain't that right well what was revealed
[1:18:18] to John then
[1:18:19] that Jesus Christ that was dead is now
[1:18:22] alive
[1:18:24] notice in Revelations 1 17 John said
[1:18:28] when I saw him I fell at his feet is
[1:18:31] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:18:34] saying unto me fear not I am the first
[1:18:37] and the last
[1:18:39] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:18:42] behold I Am Alive forevermore amen can
[1:18:47] you see man and notice now so he's not
[1:18:50] reminiscing of what he was before his
[1:18:52] resurrection he is seeing him as alive
[1:18:56] after his resurrection because why he
[1:18:59] says I have the keys of hell and of
[1:19:02] death he did not have that when John
[1:19:04] walked with him but now in this
[1:19:07] Revelation when John sees that he is
[1:19:10] alive he sees something he possesses the
[1:19:13] keys of death and of Hell amen that
[1:19:16] Resurrection meant something to us can
[1:19:18] you say amen amen now know this now
[1:19:21] notice John talked about his shoulder he
[1:19:25] saw his shoulder he saw his feet he saw
[1:19:28] his eyes he talked about it right amen
[1:19:31] he talked about his hair
[1:19:33] ain't that Brian talked about his voice
[1:19:35] but John wasn't describing Jesus in his
[1:19:38] physical body as to what when he he he
[1:19:42] was when John walked and talked with him
[1:19:45] John the prophet said John was given the
[1:19:48] revelation of the Sevenfold glory of the
[1:19:51] person of Jesus Christ in his
[1:19:54] resurrection
[1:19:55] foreign
[1:19:57] in his resurrection now I'm not against
[1:20:00] I'm not against the plays and all that
[1:20:02] we went and watched uh one the other
[1:20:04] night you know and and enjoyed it you
[1:20:07] know and they they put in a good a play
[1:20:09] uh so we're not against that but but but
[1:20:12] we but we do see but we do see that all
[1:20:16] they can show us a man is just a a
[1:20:20] replica of what Jesus was before he he
[1:20:24] raised you understand what I'm saying
[1:20:26] amen but hear what John is seeing and
[1:20:30] what John is is showing what is being
[1:20:32] shown to John is not a play but he's
[1:20:36] showing what Christ is after this
[1:20:38] Resurrection
[1:20:40] oh my
[1:20:42] ah God's showing that to the world today
[1:20:45] amen praise the Lord I go okay I gotta
[1:20:47] be careful so so it was a revelation of
[1:20:50] his glorious being okay so what does
[1:20:53] John sing Christ in his church
[1:20:58] why amen because it's after his
[1:21:02] resurrection
[1:21:03] he saw him in his church which is his
[1:21:07] body the fullness everybody say the
[1:21:10] fullness fullness Perfection completion
[1:21:13] of him
[1:21:14] ain't that right so this is what Paul
[1:21:17] what is what Paul was saying in
[1:21:20] Colossians 1 27 to whom God I didn't
[1:21:23] give this to you and but to whom God
[1:21:26] would make known what is the riches of
[1:21:28] the glory notice now this is a knowledge
[1:21:31] that we needed and he would he would
[1:21:33] make this knowledge he would give us
[1:21:35] this knowledge God would make known to
[1:21:37] us ain't that right what is the riches
[1:21:40] of this mystery among the Gentiles not
[1:21:43] the Jews among the Gentiles
[1:21:48] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:21:52] now in in in in what I believe is that
[1:21:56] mystery that Paul just spoke of is being
[1:21:58] made known today
[1:22:00] do you believe that it's being made
[1:22:02] known in this age now Jesus it goes to
[1:22:05] fulfill what Jesus said because I live
[1:22:07] you shall live also ain't that right now
[1:22:11] brother Branham in speaking of this day
[1:22:13] said this is the age of life
[1:22:16] the personal life of Christ
[1:22:18] what was in him the life that was in him
[1:22:21] is now to be made known
[1:22:26] Christ in you everybody say Christ in me
[1:22:30] the hope of glory
[1:22:32] amen see the same life The Same Spirit
[1:22:35] the same quickening power that was in
[1:22:38] him see now this is the age for Tolkien
[1:22:43] ain't that right it's the evening time
[1:22:46] this is what the token is
[1:22:48] amen is is the life
[1:22:52] a man see it's the age of life amen so
[1:22:55] then this is the age to know him in the
[1:22:58] power of his resurrection
[1:23:02] this is where this is where we're at
[1:23:05] amen see raised again see so now what
[1:23:09] are we then living in the Fulfillment of
[1:23:11] ezekiel's vision which was prophetic a
[1:23:15] man of the of the dry bones Ezekiel I
[1:23:17] didn't give this to you either but
[1:23:18] Ezekiel 37 and one I uh uh just got this
[1:23:22] down in my office there the hand of the
[1:23:25] Lord was upon me and carried me out in
[1:23:28] the spirit of the Lord and set me down
[1:23:30] in the midst of the valley which was
[1:23:32] full of Bones and calls me to pass by
[1:23:35] them round about and behold there were
[1:23:38] many in the open Valley and low they
[1:23:40] were very dry and he said unto me son of
[1:23:43] man can these bones live it was a
[1:23:46] desolate uh picture it was it was
[1:23:49] horrible
[1:23:51] and I answer oh Lord God thou knowest
[1:23:54] again he saith unto me prophesy unto
[1:23:57] these bones and say unto them O ye Dry
[1:24:00] Bones hear the word of the Lord thus
[1:24:02] saith the Lord God unto these bones
[1:24:04] behold I will cause breath to enter into
[1:24:07] you and you shall live
[1:24:08] now if you'll notice in the following
[1:24:10] verses now God chose the four stages of
[1:24:14] restoration and I will lay sin you upon
[1:24:18] you first stage and will bring up flesh
[1:24:21] upon you second stage and cover you with
[1:24:25] skin the third stage brother Brown said
[1:24:27] see first stage Luther second stage
[1:24:29] Wesley amen for the third stage
[1:24:32] Pentecost ain't that right and put
[1:24:35] breath in you and you shall live for
[1:24:38] stage and you shall know when at the
[1:24:42] time that you live at the time that you
[1:24:45] breathe that life comes into your blood
[1:24:47] Your Vessel you shall know a knowledge a
[1:24:52] knowledge you'll know that I am the Lord
[1:24:55] yeah
[1:24:56] so I prophesied and as I was commanded
[1:24:59] and as I prophesied there was a noise
[1:25:01] and behold a shaking and the bones came
[1:25:04] together bone to his bone and when I
[1:25:06] beheld uh uh Lo the sinew and the flesh
[1:25:09] Came Upon them and the skin covered them
[1:25:12] above but there was no breath in them
[1:25:14] amen now think of a we had come through
[1:25:17] Wesley or Luther Wesley and the
[1:25:19] Pentecostal age but there was no breath
[1:25:23] man can you say man amen there was no
[1:25:26] breath amen see he says uh that then he
[1:25:30] says unto me prophesy unto the wind be
[1:25:33] prophesy son of man and say to the wind
[1:25:36] thus saith the Lord God come from the
[1:25:40] Four Winds oh breathe and breathe upon
[1:25:44] this a breath and breathe upon the slain
[1:25:47] that they may live see the fourth stage
[1:25:49] amen and the prophet identified this
[1:25:52] stage as his message
[1:25:54] can you say amen God would identify this
[1:25:58] age amen what was it it was the
[1:26:00] revealing of the Mysteries amen no
[1:26:03] longer was it a theologian standing
[1:26:05] there amen no longer was it just a
[1:26:07] teacher standing there or a preacher
[1:26:09] standing there preaching all kinds of
[1:26:11] traditions and ideas amen there was a
[1:26:14] prophet of God Amen that was bringing
[1:26:17] the restoration of these Mysteries it
[1:26:19] was the Breath of God that was breathing
[1:26:22] upon the body of Christ can you say amen
[1:26:25] and all I can say is I thank God that he
[1:26:29] has revealed the Mysteries unto us I'm
[1:26:32] so glad amen that God has come himself
[1:26:36] through a prophet
[1:26:40] come from the Four Winds and breathe
[1:26:43] so I prophesied as he commanded me and
[1:26:46] the breath came into them and they lived
[1:26:49] what is it a resurrection
[1:26:52] they lived
[1:26:54] oh my we find what it is it's the Breath
[1:26:56] of God
[1:26:58] amen and he stood up on their feet
[1:27:01] they stood up on their feet in an
[1:27:03] exceeding great Army
[1:27:06] ain't that right
[1:27:07] you love him
[1:27:09] now notice as it was in the days of
[1:27:12] Jesus first coming so is it in this day
[1:27:15] someone had to be on earth at the time
[1:27:18] of this coming
[1:27:19] his coming to Earth to introduce him to
[1:27:22] the people
[1:27:23] there had to be an introduction to the
[1:27:25] Messiah because the people didn't know
[1:27:28] he was among them
[1:27:29] it took a prophet to bring the knowledge
[1:27:34] ain't that right
[1:27:35] so in John 1 26 John the Baptist said
[1:27:38] their standeth one among you whom you
[1:27:41] know not now it was John that was sent
[1:27:44] to introduce the Messiah
[1:27:47] at that first coming
[1:27:49] here it was Jesus was there but the
[1:27:52] people didn't know
[1:27:53] it took a profit
[1:27:55] amen it took a profit a man uh uh and I
[1:28:00] say a word Prophet a man to introduce
[1:28:02] the word
[1:28:04] Messiah ain't that right they're
[1:28:07] standing one among you whom you not know
[1:28:09] and it wasn't until the next day that
[1:28:12] John introduced him to the people saying
[1:28:16] Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away
[1:28:18] the sin of the world so he was standing
[1:28:20] there among them and they didn't know it
[1:28:22] Amen brother Brown said before he was
[1:28:24] recognized by anybody come to the
[1:28:27] prophet he was the word and John was a
[1:28:30] prophet ain't that right so theologians
[1:28:32] cannot recognize him
[1:28:34] yeah
[1:28:36] that's you know
[1:28:38] theologians are fine but they're not not
[1:28:41] they're they're not showing me Christ
[1:28:43] now this again this is why brother
[1:28:46] Brandon would say we're getting the
[1:28:47] people to church not to Christ
[1:28:50] because it took a profit to do it
[1:28:54] come on now
[1:28:57] they're having church church Revival
[1:28:59] Revival Revival
[1:29:01] bride bride bride bride bride
[1:29:06] he's saying there's got to come one
[1:29:10] ain't that right but there was nothing
[1:29:13] there that the theologians had to
[1:29:16] introduce him the scholars and all their
[1:29:17] teaching amen it was not called to
[1:29:20] introduce
[1:29:24] but there would be a prophet that would
[1:29:25] come
[1:29:27] and introduce
[1:29:29] now for people to say that message
[1:29:31] people ain't getting people to Christ
[1:29:34] they're ignorant and unlearned
[1:29:40] I know Mrs preachers constantly blasting
[1:29:43] message people it just bothers me
[1:29:49] message Pete for the cream of the crop
[1:29:52] yeah now I'm not saying that they're
[1:29:55] they're you know I mean there's
[1:29:56] Hypocrites among everybody
[1:30:02] but there's genuine there and that's
[1:30:04] where you're only going to find genuine
[1:30:08] people that are ready for a bride people
[1:30:10] that's going on in the Rapture is is it
[1:30:12] sitting there in message churches
[1:30:14] so don't throw the whole lump out
[1:30:17] just preach promises
[1:30:21] hello
[1:30:22] so we find
[1:30:24] now John John introduced him because
[1:30:28] that's what the Bible says he would do
[1:30:30] prepare the way of the Lord
[1:30:32] so then to prove that John was right
[1:30:36] Jesus performed a sign of Messiah
[1:30:39] now the prophet said in in the presence
[1:30:42] of God unrecognized that he come Jesus
[1:30:45] come in his right sign
[1:30:47] he come according to the promise and he
[1:30:50] performed the Messiah signed Andrew
[1:30:53] believed it he performed assigned to
[1:30:55] Peter he believed it he performed that
[1:30:58] same Messiah sign a man to the woman at
[1:31:01] the well she believed it
[1:31:03] he ain't ain't that right wow they were
[1:31:06] predestinated seed
[1:31:08] just just have to say it that way and
[1:31:10] notice look at the woman at the well she
[1:31:12] said sir I know that when the Messiah
[1:31:14] cometh he will tell us these things or
[1:31:17] all things in other words he will reveal
[1:31:20] the secrets of the heart
[1:31:23] ain't that right and then Jesus turns
[1:31:25] around says I am he that speaks to you
[1:31:27] oh my see so he proved that John was
[1:31:32] right in his introduction
[1:31:35] that he was the Messiah amen but then
[1:31:39] also did he just say it's dormant after
[1:31:41] after John introduced him as the Messiah
[1:31:44] absolutely not
[1:31:46] and and this is where the church cannot
[1:31:49] just set dormant
[1:31:50] Christ will not just set dormant because
[1:31:52] the prophet left the scene
[1:31:55] John fully declared I must decrease that
[1:31:59] he may increase
[1:32:01] he knew that two could not stand on
[1:32:03] Earth at the same time
[1:32:04] so don't just look and depend on a
[1:32:06] prophet and say well Prophet needs to
[1:32:08] come back you're against the scriptures
[1:32:10] when you say that
[1:32:14] then you say amen for if you are Miss
[1:32:16] Jesus Christ then that was what the
[1:32:19] prophet was to introduce was Jesus
[1:32:21] Christ in your flesh
[1:32:24] if you're the body of Jesus Christ the
[1:32:28] prophet came to introduce Christ among
[1:32:31] the world today
[1:32:34] in your flesh
[1:32:36] so he didn't just set dormant after the
[1:32:38] introduction no sir he did exactly what
[1:32:41] the scripture said he would do
[1:32:43] he healed the sick raised the dead calls
[1:32:45] the blind to see he said at Liberty them
[1:32:47] that were bruised ain't that right now
[1:32:50] notice the prophet said we've got to
[1:32:52] come to a place again to something
[1:32:54] that's going to introduce the Messiah
[1:32:56] now Church we're not reading that quote
[1:32:59] as though we're looking for something to
[1:33:01] come we we're reading this quote and
[1:33:04] declaring it had to come and it has come
[1:33:08] the introduction has been made
[1:33:14] ain't that right amen now Christ was not
[1:33:18] introduced to us though
[1:33:21] as a traditional thought
[1:33:24] you know see the the the
[1:33:28] tradition
[1:33:31] there's a traditional thought about
[1:33:33] Jesus coming
[1:33:36] foreign
[1:33:39] and and the tradition has him
[1:33:43] coming in clouds in the sky
[1:33:46] and all the world looking at him
[1:33:52] and they're looking to see him in his
[1:33:55] physical form
[1:33:58] the Bible says that we will not see him
[1:34:00] in his physical form on Earth
[1:34:04] he never promised to come in his
[1:34:06] physical body on Earth
[1:34:10] and you say man
[1:34:11] but now they're looking to see him in
[1:34:14] his physical form
[1:34:15] and we believe that we will see him in
[1:34:18] his physical form
[1:34:20] a man but the world will not see him
[1:34:23] ain't that right not everybody is going
[1:34:25] to see him in his physical body
[1:34:27] not not not at this not at the rat in
[1:34:30] time of rapture the Bible says we'll be
[1:34:31] caught up to meet him in the air
[1:34:34] and there's only going to be a certain
[1:34:36] few that's going to meet him in the air
[1:34:38] amen now notice first Thessalonians 5
[1:34:41] and 1 but of the times and the seasons
[1:34:43] Brethren you have no need that I write
[1:34:45] unto you for yourselves know perfectly
[1:34:47] that the day of the Lord so cometh as a
[1:34:50] thief in the night for when they shall
[1:34:53] say peace and safety are they not saying
[1:34:55] that then sudden destruction cometh upon
[1:34:58] them as travail upon a woman with child
[1:35:00] and they shall not they shall not Escape
[1:35:03] but ye Brethren are not in darkness that
[1:35:06] that day should overtake you as a thief
[1:35:08] can you say Amen so there's going to be
[1:35:11] people the coming of the Lord a man will
[1:35:14] be as a thief in the night he comes as a
[1:35:16] thief and what does the thief do come to
[1:35:19] get the jewels well in the night while
[1:35:22] everybody's asleep he sneaks in there he
[1:35:25] picks what he wants and he take and he's
[1:35:27] gone before they wake up and they
[1:35:29] realize he came and gone
[1:35:31] ain't that right sometimes it takes it
[1:35:34] takes a week sometimes it takes days
[1:35:36] before they realize what just happened
[1:35:40] but the valuables are gone
[1:35:43] yeah now Church there's valuables on
[1:35:44] this Earth
[1:35:47] that's his body
[1:35:49] now brother Brown said the first thing
[1:35:51] you know you're going to say well I
[1:35:53] thought there was supposed to be a
[1:35:54] Rapture before the tribulation see the
[1:35:57] tribulation is going to strike and what
[1:35:58] it would be uh what would it be awful if
[1:36:01] you heard say well it's already been and
[1:36:04] you didn't know it see there will be one
[1:36:06] in the field I'll take one and leave one
[1:36:08] just somebody come up missing there'll
[1:36:10] be just a very very few in that Rapture
[1:36:13] that'll be changed see the sleeping
[1:36:15] bride the bride that's been taken
[1:36:17] Through the Ages see she will come forth
[1:36:20] first and then we which are alive and
[1:36:23] remain shall be caught up with them just
[1:36:25] one here one there one over here and and
[1:36:28] this thing see at least every day across
[1:36:31] the world there is as many as 500 people
[1:36:34] missing and people don't even know about
[1:36:36] you never hear about it
[1:36:38] see what if there was a thousand they
[1:36:41] would say oh well this woman she just
[1:36:43] run off with somebody this preacher he
[1:36:44] just took some other man's wife and is
[1:36:46] gone he went to the Bahamas or something
[1:36:48] like that we just can't find him
[1:36:52] he's about what's happened he's gone to
[1:36:54] glory in the Rapture and they won't know
[1:36:57] it
[1:36:59] and you say Amen
[1:37:01] see so here's the traditional thought
[1:37:04] that he will be introduced is that we
[1:37:07] all look at him in the in the clouds
[1:37:11] and everybody's rejoicing The Sinner the
[1:37:13] saint those that despised him
[1:37:16] church people that didn't like church
[1:37:20] they don't like the word that's ready to
[1:37:22] get out at a certain time
[1:37:24] they just suspect everybody's going to
[1:37:26] sit there and glorify him
[1:37:28] that ain't the way it's going to be
[1:37:31] he's coming as a thief
[1:37:34] for his valuables in other words he's
[1:37:37] coming for those that's got his own life
[1:37:39] in them
[1:37:44] ain't that right that's what's valuable
[1:37:47] so Luke 17 30 tells us that he's going
[1:37:50] to be revealed or introduced as the son
[1:37:53] of man
[1:37:54] so then God would send us a prophet and
[1:37:56] his ministry was to introduce the
[1:37:58] Messiah now I want to ask you did he
[1:38:00] introduce a messiah that's dead
[1:38:04] did he introduce a messiah that is a
[1:38:06] historical figure did he introduce to us
[1:38:09] some fairy tale
[1:38:11] absolutely not now notice in the Book of
[1:38:14] Revelations we see that John was caught
[1:38:16] up into the Lord's Day
[1:38:19] and I have to say it's this day it's the
[1:38:22] day that Messiah was to be introduced
[1:38:26] can you say Amen it was in this day that
[1:38:29] he was caught up in and when he saw him
[1:38:32] he saw him as being alive and Alive
[1:38:36] forevermore
[1:38:39] can you say Amen church he saw him
[1:38:42] walking in the midst of the candlesticks
[1:38:43] he heard him speaking and his voice was
[1:38:46] the sound of many Waters
[1:38:49] now I'm getting ready to close but you
[1:38:51] know good and well for 1500 years
[1:38:55] the church has had him sealed away
[1:39:00] the Holy Spirit the prophet said has
[1:39:02] been bound by these denominational
[1:39:03] Rivers for almost 2 000 years
[1:39:07] but it's in this day the day that John
[1:39:09] was caught up in
[1:39:10] the day that the Messiah was to be
[1:39:12] introduced
[1:39:14] it is to be loosed in the evening time
[1:39:17] by the evening time message no other
[1:39:19] message but the evening time message the
[1:39:22] Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:39:24] Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:39:28] in the evening time we read this last
[1:39:31] Sunday but the ministry brother Brown
[1:39:33] said is to make known the Lord Jesus his
[1:39:36] presence our objective mainly is for you
[1:39:39] to see the presence of Jesus Christ and
[1:39:42] to know that he is here
[1:39:46] oh do you love him
[1:39:49] I love him
[1:39:50] now our knowledge of Christ
[1:39:52] must first of all come by the scripture
[1:39:56] that's where the problem lies today
[1:39:59] people don't know what the Bible has
[1:40:02] said about him
[1:40:04] people don't know
[1:40:06] or what he is to be in this day and age
[1:40:08] and they have misplaced the scriptures
[1:40:10] by their theology
[1:40:13] and work doctrines until the presence of
[1:40:17] Jesus Christ is not recognized
[1:40:21] now brother Brown said how will the
[1:40:23] people that's believing him know it
[1:40:25] unless they're constantly in the word to
[1:40:29] know what he is
[1:40:31] just like the woman at the well when he
[1:40:33] he he performed the Messiah sign to her
[1:40:37] she said sir I know that when the
[1:40:40] Messiah cometh he'll do these things
[1:40:42] well how did she know she had read it
[1:40:45] from the word
[1:40:50] so this introduction of Messiah is not
[1:40:53] going to be
[1:40:54] all in the hands
[1:40:58] people rolling on the floor
[1:41:00] doing somersaults
[1:41:04] hello
[1:41:06] amen having all these kinds of things
[1:41:09] that's not Messiah
[1:41:12] a man see I'm not saying people won't do
[1:41:15] them things I'm just saying that's not
[1:41:16] that's not sign of Messiah
[1:41:19] because we know Satan does them things
[1:41:21] as well
[1:41:22] ain't that right
[1:41:24] yes sir see I'll just tell you one time
[1:41:27] uh a while back about the preach that
[1:41:29] got caught up in that that that that
[1:41:31] started practicing the Witchcraft the
[1:41:34] pastor in his church started passing
[1:41:36] practicing Witchcraft and had a man lay
[1:41:38] on the floor
[1:41:40] and then raised him up in the air and he
[1:41:42] was floating in the air by witchcraft
[1:41:44] now Church
[1:41:46] that's not the sign of Messiah
[1:41:50] ain't that right so so your recognition
[1:41:54] of Messiah must come from scriptures
[1:41:57] ain't that right
[1:41:59] see her knowledge the woman at the well
[1:42:01] her knowledge was based upon scripture
[1:42:04] see the two disciples that walked on the
[1:42:06] road to Emmaus didn't know the scripture
[1:42:08] the prophet said that's the reason they
[1:42:10] didn't know him
[1:42:11] see now he is here tonight we read this
[1:42:14] the other morning Sunday morning he is
[1:42:17] here tonight
[1:42:18] identifying his presence by the
[1:42:20] prophecies foretold for this age he is
[1:42:24] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:42:29] do you believe it
[1:42:30] the church has Twisted up the scriptures
[1:42:33] so much down Through the Ages till they
[1:42:36] can't make heads or Tales of it
[1:42:39] we couldn't I couldn't make heads or
[1:42:41] tails of it see and Satan has designed
[1:42:45] it that way
[1:42:46] amen because when Jesus Christ is not
[1:42:49] recognized the prophet said his power is
[1:42:52] not revealed
[1:42:54] I'll say that again when Jesus is not
[1:42:57] recognized in the presence of Jesus
[1:43:00] Christ he is not recognized the power of
[1:43:03] God is Not revealed
[1:43:06] brother Brown said no matter how much
[1:43:09] God Is Standing present you've got to
[1:43:10] believe it like the woman with the issue
[1:43:13] of blood see all them people passing by
[1:43:16] all them standing up saying there goes
[1:43:18] the rabbi that's the guy that claims to
[1:43:20] be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all
[1:43:22] such as that but what happened this
[1:43:25] little woman had an issue of blood and
[1:43:27] she had heard about him and when she
[1:43:29] come down there regardless of what
[1:43:30] anybody said she recognized who he was
[1:43:34] and she said if I could only touch His
[1:43:36] Garment
[1:43:38] is that right and when that genuine
[1:43:40] faith in God became a positive thing to
[1:43:43] her what did it release it released his
[1:43:46] power to heal her it touched him in such
[1:43:50] a way he turned around and told her what
[1:43:53] was wrong with her and said your faith
[1:43:55] that saved you what did it her faith
[1:43:57] understanding there might have you know
[1:44:00] been sicker than she was but you see she
[1:44:03] recognized his presence and she knowed
[1:44:06] that that was her opportunity
[1:44:09] my what an opportunity we have been
[1:44:12] given in this age
[1:44:14] not just to be church members
[1:44:17] not just to go to church and do a
[1:44:19] religious duty but we have been
[1:44:21] privileged to recognize his presence
[1:44:24] and everything that you have need of is
[1:44:27] granted to you if you need Deliverance
[1:44:29] just recognize his presence is here and
[1:44:32] you can have that Deliverance his power
[1:44:34] and it's gone even to the place that his
[1:44:37] rapturing power is being released unto
[1:44:40] us transformation power is being
[1:44:43] released unto the people that has
[1:44:46] recognized him
[1:44:49] he said if we could only realize that he
[1:44:51] is appearing to us in these meetings for
[1:44:54] one purpose
[1:44:55] and that's to release our desires that
[1:44:57] we have in him to us but we've got to
[1:45:00] recognize his presence and how now how
[1:45:03] you recognize his presence is when the
[1:45:06] promised word for this age is made
[1:45:07] manifest not the promised word of Moses
[1:45:10] age or any of any other ages but the
[1:45:13] promise of the the word for this age
[1:45:16] can you say Amen so let's look at a
[1:45:19] promise for this age shall we a man Luke
[1:45:21] 2 11 29 this is an evil generation and
[1:45:25] they seek a sign now another place he
[1:45:28] called it an adulterous and wicked
[1:45:30] generation amen and there shall no sign
[1:45:33] be given ungiven it but the sign of
[1:45:36] Jonas the prophet for as Jonas was a
[1:45:39] sign unto the ninevites so shall also
[1:45:43] the son of man be to this generation now
[1:45:46] run uh the presence of God unrecognized
[1:45:49] brother Branham said Jesus was actually
[1:45:51] prophesying of this age there is not a
[1:45:54] man there's never been an evil age like
[1:45:57] this age today there has never been an
[1:45:59] adulterous age as this age today
[1:46:03] can you say amen and yet Jesus told them
[1:46:06] that there will be one sign and only one
[1:46:09] that will be given to this unbelieving
[1:46:11] generation and that'll be the sign of
[1:46:13] his resurrection for as Jonas Rose amen
[1:46:17] from that that that that that that that
[1:46:18] uh body of water and come out of that uh
[1:46:21] uh uh that that whale amen that would be
[1:46:25] the sign a man that would come would be
[1:46:28] Messiah would be rise again would raise
[1:46:31] again and what is that brother Brown
[1:46:33] said he would raise amen from the Creeds
[1:46:35] of man he would raise from the
[1:46:37] traditions of men he would raise from
[1:46:39] the unbelief of men through all the ages
[1:46:42] and he would rise and show himself alive
[1:46:45] to this generation and that would be the
[1:46:47] sign that he that this generation would
[1:46:50] get
[1:46:52] and you say man it's the sign of his
[1:46:54] resurrection he is see is the show in
[1:46:57] this age he is the show that he is alive
[1:47:00] in this age he is to show that he is
[1:47:03] alive now church amen as much as I enjoy
[1:47:06] you know the the the plays and all of
[1:47:09] these things I'm you know I'm I'm not
[1:47:11] against that until you know I enjoy it I
[1:47:14] I you know you enjoy them saying amen
[1:47:16] but we don't need that to know that he's
[1:47:18] alive
[1:47:19] hey man I'm not here to tell you that
[1:47:21] he's alive of what happened to 2000
[1:47:23] years ago I'm telling you you're living
[1:47:25] in age where God promised he would be
[1:47:28] alive he would show himself and he has
[1:47:30] shown himself alive and if you can
[1:47:33] recognize his presence his power
[1:47:36] will be released
[1:47:38] to you
[1:47:43] see he's going to show himself alive it
[1:47:45] will not be a church replacing him
[1:47:47] it won't be a denomination replacing him
[1:47:50] it won't be a theologian replacing him
[1:47:52] we're not to receive a sign of his
[1:47:55] replacement
[1:47:56] we are to receive a sign of his
[1:47:58] resurrection
[1:48:00] can you say Amen
[1:48:01] amen what he was then he'll be today
[1:48:03] what he did back then he'll do today
[1:48:06] can you say Amen oh do you love him
[1:48:09] isn't he wonderful amen that's right see
[1:48:12] so we have been given the sign that he
[1:48:14] promised to give to this generation now
[1:48:17] if I'm gonna I'm gonna close
[1:48:19] but what was he back then
[1:48:24] John 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[1:48:26] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:48:28] Word was God
[1:48:30] and the 14th verse and the Word was made
[1:48:34] flesh
[1:48:36] every prophecy that spoke of Messiah
[1:48:38] became flesh in Messiah
[1:48:42] right
[1:48:43] everything every type every shadow
[1:48:48] you read about the natural lamb how they
[1:48:50] they sacrifice and offer to Natural lamb
[1:48:53] in the Old Testament it only spoke of
[1:48:55] him
[1:48:56] he was the the ultimate sacrifice
[1:48:59] he was the high priest
[1:49:01] oh
[1:49:03] he was the temple
[1:49:05] the Shekinah Glory came in
[1:49:08] for it was God in Christ
[1:49:11] when God was in Christ no longer did the
[1:49:13] Shekinah Glory come into the the the
[1:49:15] natural Tabernacle
[1:49:18] the glory departed from that
[1:49:20] because he was now in the true
[1:49:22] Tabernacle
[1:49:23] can you say Amen
[1:49:25] oh we could go on and on and on the word
[1:49:27] became flesh and dwelt Among Us and the
[1:49:31] Bible says in him was life and the life
[1:49:35] was the light of men we could go on and
[1:49:38] on about that light in life but in him
[1:49:41] was the life and the life was the light
[1:49:44] of men now he was the word now notice
[1:49:47] Hebrews 4 and 12 the word of God is
[1:49:50] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:49:53] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:49:55] deciding dividing asunder of Soul and
[1:49:58] Spirit and of the Johnson Mara and is a
[1:50:01] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:50:03] the heart
[1:50:04] now you think of what that word is what
[1:50:07] a powerful thing that word is
[1:50:09] think of it now
[1:50:11] on the day of judgment
[1:50:14] man's going to stand
[1:50:16] at that judgment throne
[1:50:22] on Judgment Day and they're going to be
[1:50:24] judged by only one thing and that's by
[1:50:26] the word of God and he is the word
[1:50:31] the Bible says that every creature will
[1:50:33] stand us naked before him
[1:50:36] the word
[1:50:38] Hebrews 4 13 for there is no creature
[1:50:41] that is not manifest in his sight
[1:50:46] you can cover it up by television you
[1:50:48] can cover it up by Hollywood you can
[1:50:50] cover it up by makeup you can cover it
[1:50:52] up by wearing wigs
[1:50:54] you get even cover it up by changing
[1:50:56] your gender
[1:50:58] if you can
[1:51:02] you can cover it up by digging digging
[1:51:04] the biggest biggest deepest cave in the
[1:51:07] ground
[1:51:09] you can cover it up with comedy you can
[1:51:11] cover it up by hardening your heart
[1:51:13] you can cover it up with your smile on
[1:51:15] your face you can cover any it all up
[1:51:18] but when it comes to the word
[1:51:21] you will stand his naked before him
[1:51:26] for he says all things are naked and
[1:51:28] open unto the eyes of him
[1:51:31] which is the word
[1:51:33] when Nathaniel stood before him and
[1:51:35] Jesus told him who he was
[1:51:38] Nathaniel saith unto me unto him when
[1:51:40] snow is thou me and Jesus answered and
[1:51:43] said unto him before that Philip called
[1:51:45] thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I
[1:51:48] saw thee
[1:51:49] what was it it was the word discerning
[1:51:53] for it was him the word
[1:51:56] brother Brown says when he comes that
[1:51:58] word will come against all nations and
[1:52:00] all men
[1:52:01] and none will be able to stand against
[1:52:03] it
[1:52:04] it will reveal what was in every heart
[1:52:06] as he did with net Nathaniel the word of
[1:52:09] God will show who did the will of God
[1:52:11] and who didn't it will make known the
[1:52:14] secret works of every man and why he did
[1:52:16] them it will divide asunder
[1:52:19] Romans 2 and 3 says and thank us thou o
[1:52:22] man that that judges them which do such
[1:52:26] things and do us the same that thou
[1:52:28] shall escape the Judgment of God brother
[1:52:31] Brown said the the hard impenent in
[1:52:34] penitent heart will be judged The Works
[1:52:36] will be judged the motives will be
[1:52:38] judged there will not be any respect
[1:52:40] before God and all is going to be judged
[1:52:43] by the word and no one shall Escape it
[1:52:45] those who heard and wouldn't listen will
[1:52:48] be judged by what they heard those that
[1:52:51] rested in it saying they believed it and
[1:52:52] didn't live it will be judged every
[1:52:55] secret will come out in the open and be
[1:52:57] shouted from the house stops oh we will
[1:53:00] really understand history then there
[1:53:02] won't be a mystery left from all the
[1:53:05] ages why because the word is the
[1:53:08] discerner the word is the one that opens
[1:53:10] no one will stand a man covered up amen
[1:53:14] no matter what excuse you have amen when
[1:53:16] you come by that word the word will
[1:53:18] expose every heart every motive
[1:53:20] everything and the excuses that we have
[1:53:23] and buried and covered ourselves and
[1:53:25] used to hide and pretend Amen in all
[1:53:28] these things it'll all be made open
[1:53:32] it's going to be true judgment
[1:53:36] why because the word is a discerner but
[1:53:38] what has he done in this age
[1:53:41] see the word became flesh
[1:53:45] and there was nothing that could be hid
[1:53:46] from him
[1:53:48] he knew the thoughts he knew what they
[1:53:50] deserved in their heart
[1:53:53] he knew what that Pharisee was
[1:53:56] where he said you're of your father the
[1:53:58] devil
[1:53:59] only the word could known that
[1:54:03] ain't that right
[1:54:06] you see it's the word that reveals and
[1:54:08] so has the word come in this age Messiah
[1:54:15] the sign of Messiah has happened again
[1:54:20] the hearts of men have been revealed
[1:54:25] right
[1:54:27] night after night
[1:54:28] as brother Brandon would stand on that
[1:54:30] platform and discern the hearts
[1:54:35] tell them what their address was tell
[1:54:37] them what their name was
[1:54:39] tell them what was wrong even when the
[1:54:41] doctors couldn't know and just tell what
[1:54:43] was wrong
[1:54:45] the doctors would say well it's this and
[1:54:47] the prophet would stand there and by
[1:54:48] that word would discern and say no it's
[1:54:50] not that it's this
[1:54:53] ain't that right
[1:54:55] what was it it was the word revealing
[1:54:57] the heart secrets of men and women in
[1:54:59] this age that we're living in
[1:55:02] showing that the Messiah is on the Earth
[1:55:04] again
[1:55:06] you say Amen brother Brahm said it is
[1:55:08] the word it is performing where unto it
[1:55:11] was sent for it the word is full of
[1:55:13] power it is the same spirit that was in
[1:55:16] Jesus the word that is present again in
[1:55:19] the church in this last age as a last
[1:55:22] sign trying to head the people off from
[1:55:24] judgment for they that reject him the
[1:55:27] word are now already come into judgment
[1:55:29] crucifying him afresh
[1:55:34] ain't that right now not only have we
[1:55:36] seen the word Discerning but it's still
[1:55:38] discerning
[1:55:39] do you believe that listen now as I get
[1:55:42] ready to close but I want you to listen
[1:55:44] Hebrews 5 and 12 for when for when for
[1:55:48] the time you ought to be teachers you
[1:55:49] have need that one teach you again which
[1:55:52] be the first principles of the Oracles
[1:55:54] of God and are become such as have need
[1:55:56] of milk and not a strong meat for
[1:55:59] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[1:56:02] the word of righteousness for he is a
[1:56:04] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[1:56:06] that are full of a a full age even those
[1:56:10] who by reason of use have their senses
[1:56:13] exercised to discern everybody say to
[1:56:15] discern both good and evil now church we
[1:56:20] have come the church has come to the
[1:56:22] place of full age
[1:56:24] do you believe that adoption time this
[1:56:27] is adoption time and the church has
[1:56:30] ripened in the presence of the Sun
[1:56:35] you all know it but read the re read it
[1:56:39] I mean we'll listen to the messages
[1:56:42] she is the only one this bride the
[1:56:46] Church of the Living God is the only one
[1:56:47] that has the ability to discern between
[1:56:49] right and wrong
[1:56:51] Good and Evil therefore she is showing
[1:56:55] forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:56:58] by her discernment
[1:57:00] why because he is the only one that
[1:57:02] could discern
[1:57:04] can you say Amen now we may not be
[1:57:07] Discerning the hearts and all these
[1:57:09] things in in the sense of what brother
[1:57:10] Branham done but but the word has been
[1:57:13] made known to us
[1:57:16] that has given us a knowledge
[1:57:20] hello
[1:57:21] goes why we're in and live in an age of
[1:57:24] mixing colors everything wants to mix
[1:57:26] everything is a Christian everybody is
[1:57:28] is saved everybody wants to be religious
[1:57:31] everybody is now we're living in a time
[1:57:33] of melting pot
[1:57:36] Don't Preach hard don't you condemn me
[1:57:38] don't you talk to me about hell I've
[1:57:40] been in the message I've been in the
[1:57:42] church for 50 some years how dare you
[1:57:44] tell me how to live
[1:57:47] I don't care if you've been in it a
[1:57:49] hundred years
[1:57:51] we still have a discernment of the word
[1:57:55] ain't that right so here we find what is
[1:57:59] discernment it's Revelation that's
[1:58:00] that's what discernment is it's
[1:58:03] Revelation and that's what the true
[1:58:04] church is built upon so now now the
[1:58:07] prophet said only he Christ the word can
[1:58:10] discern
[1:58:11] ain't that right and he's the spirit of
[1:58:13] truth that was promised to come in this
[1:58:16] age the Bible never promised to
[1:58:18] introduce to us a psychologist
[1:58:23] brother Graham said psychology is a shot
[1:58:25] in the dark
[1:58:28] hello
[1:58:29] but he promised that he would be
[1:58:31] introduced as the spirit of Truth
[1:58:36] so now look at the age that we're living
[1:58:38] in this is the age we're living now
[1:58:39] Isaiah 5 and 20 we've read it before but
[1:58:42] woe unto them that call evil good and
[1:58:44] good evil that put forth put light for
[1:58:46] Darkness then uh or Darkness for light
[1:58:49] and light for darkness that put bitter
[1:58:51] for sweet and Sweet for bitter woe unto
[1:58:53] them that are wise in their own eyes and
[1:58:55] pruded in their own sight woe unto them
[1:58:58] that are Mighty to drink wine and Men of
[1:59:00] string to mingle strong drink now you
[1:59:03] can use that in in a spiritual
[1:59:04] application of how in Revelation she has
[1:59:07] made all men to drink of the wine of her
[1:59:09] fornication and and on and on and on
[1:59:12] which justify the wicked for reward in
[1:59:15] other words they reward the wicked for
[1:59:17] their evil doings and their their wrong
[1:59:19] doing an unrighteous doings and and all
[1:59:22] that and they take away the
[1:59:24] righteousness of the righteous from him
[1:59:28] so this is prophesying of the people of
[1:59:31] this age that would have no discernment
[1:59:33] between good and evil right and wrong
[1:59:36] no wonder it's the most deceptive age
[1:59:39] ever and Jesus would tell us amen that
[1:59:41] it would be so close of a deception that
[1:59:44] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:59:46] wasn't if it was possible
[1:59:48] and you say Amen but in this time of
[1:59:51] deception there is a people that's been
[1:59:54] given a discernment to no right wrong
[1:59:56] why he is alive
[2:00:00] he the word is quickening the word to us
[2:00:05] he's alive
[2:00:07] notice the word is in the bride do you
[2:00:09] believe it
[2:00:10] not not how you gonna get that you're
[2:00:12] going to eat that no the word The Living
[2:00:14] Word the spirit of Truth is in the bride
[2:00:17] that same word that that that that that
[2:00:19] discern the hearts of men and women that
[2:00:22] same word is in this bride and we have
[2:00:24] that spirit of discernment to know what
[2:00:26] between good and evil between right and
[2:00:29] wrong and we know I have to keep that
[2:00:31] balance Amen in the word because
[2:00:35] it's a spirit of discernment
[2:00:37] now notice the word is in the bride and
[2:00:40] the mind of Christ to know or to discern
[2:00:42] what he once done with the word they do
[2:00:46] only his will they're not mixed up
[2:00:49] they're not mixed up and saying
[2:00:50] everything is his will they're not
[2:00:52] looking at every Christian out here and
[2:00:54] everybody just all this and and said oh
[2:00:57] that must please God Amen looking at the
[2:00:59] rock and roll and everybody dancing with
[2:01:01] their little lights up in the church and
[2:01:03] and and the women with their little
[2:01:05] short sleazy dresses and all these
[2:01:07] things and then we said oh that must be
[2:01:09] pleasing to God they say they're
[2:01:11] Christian there is a discernment to the
[2:01:13] will of God to where we know what
[2:01:16] pleases God and what doesn't please God
[2:01:23] the word is in the bride when this age
[2:01:30] is alive
[2:01:34] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:01:36] Christ to know to discern what he once
[2:01:38] done with the word they do only his will
[2:01:41] he says amen I believe that no one can
[2:01:43] persuade them different
[2:01:44] they have thus saith the Lord they keep
[2:01:46] still I don't care how right it looks
[2:01:48] and how real it seems
[2:01:52] I don't care how they don't know how
[2:01:54] much of an anointing it has
[2:01:58] I don't care how sincere it is
[2:02:02] there's any discernment to know the
[2:02:04] difference
[2:02:07] they have the Sith Lord or they keep
[2:02:11] still
[2:02:12] then they will do the works of God for
[2:02:15] it it is himself in them
[2:02:19] what the word himself in them
[2:02:26] continuing his word to fulfill can you
[2:02:28] say man
[2:02:29] so that discernment is still here
[2:02:31] because the word has once again taken on
[2:02:35] the flesh
[2:02:36] in broad form
[2:02:38] he's alive
[2:02:40] he's alive do you believe he's alive
[2:02:43] he's alive and well not not because I'm
[2:02:46] up here dancing and shouting that don't
[2:02:48] mean nothing not because you come to an
[2:02:50] altar and you cry that don't mean he's
[2:02:52] alive
[2:02:54] hello
[2:02:55] he the word is showing himself in a body
[2:02:59] of Believers today
[2:03:01] that's why we just don't accept anything
[2:03:03] as Christian
[2:03:07] he's alive in us
[2:03:13] you love him
[2:03:14] see
[2:03:16] why ain't the elect going to be deceived
[2:03:21] well Brian said here's the secret
[2:03:24] the word is in the bride
[2:03:27] the word is in the bride
[2:03:29] he's alive and well
[2:03:31] in her
[2:03:33] in you
[2:03:35] amen
[2:03:37] listen the reason the elected won't be
[2:03:39] deceived you know why he says is because
[2:03:42] they are the word
[2:03:45] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[2:03:48] of his life power of his power she is
[2:03:52] him
[2:03:53] Church what an introduction
[2:04:01] all I know is I'm glad to be part of it
[2:04:07] he says they can't be nothing else they
[2:04:11] can't hear nothing else they don't know
[2:04:14] nothing else
[2:04:15] why
[2:04:17] they are the word
[2:04:20] they are his body
[2:04:22] can you say Amen no other knowledge can
[2:04:25] come to them
[2:04:28] because their knowledge has come by
[2:04:30] experience
[2:04:32] you love him
[2:04:33] isn't he wonderful
[2:04:36] yet the musicians will come
[2:04:40] we find second Timothy 3 and 8 says now
[2:04:43] as Jammers Janice and Chambers withstood
[2:04:45] Moses so do these also resist the truth
[2:04:48] men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[2:04:50] concerning the faith
[2:04:51] but what was janison Chambers
[2:04:53] impersonators
[2:04:57] but the prophet said Moses wasn't
[2:04:59] carried away with all their
[2:05:00] impersonations
[2:05:01] for Moses was the word for that day
[2:05:04] and because the word was given to him
[2:05:07] for that day
[2:05:09] amen so this word bride ain't carried
[2:05:12] away with impersonators she can discern
[2:05:15] between real and fake
[2:05:18] she can discern between Good and Evil
[2:05:21] ain't that right
[2:05:23] now notice this discernment
[2:05:26] First Corinthians 4 and 4 for I know
[2:05:29] nothing by myself
[2:05:31] yet am I not hereby Justified
[2:05:35] but he that judges me is the Lord
[2:05:37] therefore judge nothing before the time
[2:05:44] until
[2:05:46] the Lord come
[2:05:48] now
[2:05:49] do you realize that
[2:05:54] all the church ages
[2:06:00] Satan was able to ride
[2:06:06] and never be discerned
[2:06:09] for what he really was
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:17] cover
[2:06:19] form of a church
[2:06:23] [Music]
[2:06:26] that it would be in this day
[2:06:29] when the Lord shall come
[2:06:32] who both will bring Delight the hidden
[2:06:35] things of darkness and will make
[2:06:36] manifest the councils of the heart
[2:06:39] then shall every man
[2:06:42] have Praise of God
[2:06:45] Say Amen
[2:06:47] what's happened
[2:06:51] Christ has come
[2:06:55] not in the way that the church thinks he
[2:06:57] should
[2:06:58] but he is here
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] and he's shown forth the Messiah sign
[2:07:05] the sign of his resurrection
[2:07:09] and you say Amen
[2:07:11] now
[2:07:14] we're not looking
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:17] at things blindly but now we can see
[2:07:19] Satan because Satan has been exposed in
[2:07:22] every every way every trick everything
[2:07:25] because brother Brown said the only way
[2:07:28] to overcome is to know him and every one
[2:07:29] of his tricks
[2:07:30] Satan has been exposed
[2:07:33] can you say man at this coming
[2:07:37] and I'll tell you
[2:07:38] Satan hates it
[2:07:40] Satan seeks to destroy
[2:07:43] and he's doing everything he can to
[2:07:45] destroy
[2:07:47] brother Brown said if he he knows that
[2:07:49] if the people get the true revelation of
[2:07:51] the true church and what she is and what
[2:07:53] she stands for and that she can do the
[2:07:55] greater work she will be an invincible
[2:07:57] Army
[2:07:58] if they get a true revelation of the two
[2:08:01] Spirits within the framework of the
[2:08:04] Christian church and by God's spirit
[2:08:05] discern and withstand that Spirit
[2:08:07] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[2:08:10] powerless before her he will be as
[2:08:13] definitely forwarded today as when
[2:08:15] Christ withstood his every effort to
[2:08:17] gain power over him in the desert
[2:08:19] yes Satan hates Revelation but we love
[2:08:22] it with true Revelation in our heart the
[2:08:23] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[2:08:26] but we will everybody say we will
[2:08:29] prevail over them
[2:08:32] can you say Amen you love him I could go
[2:08:36] on and on and I'll close God bless you
[2:08:38] is our prayer
[2:08:40] I'm so glad to know he's alive

[2:10:57] Jesus is Alive
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:01] as they just play softly you know
[2:11:04] thinking of all this what we're saying
[2:11:06] today
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:11] brother Bram talks about them Chinese
[2:11:14] laundromen that first came
[2:11:16] to America and they couldn't
[2:11:19] start the business of
[2:11:21] about doing laundry for people
[2:11:24] [Music]
[2:11:25] but they didn't know how to speak their
[2:11:27] language American so
[2:11:30] when a person come to give their laundry
[2:11:35] how would they communicate where the
[2:11:38] person says hey I couldn't get my
[2:11:40] laundry how are they going to get it
[2:11:41] back
[2:11:41] [Music]
[2:11:43] so
[2:11:45] they came up with a way to take a piece
[2:11:47] of paper and they would rip it
[2:11:51] and however that paper was
[2:11:53] you know it could have ripped you know
[2:11:55] all kinds of ways but they put them
[2:11:57] pieces to see so then the Chinese
[2:12:00] laundromen he would keep one piece and
[2:12:03] his customer would keep another piece
[2:12:07] it's all the customer you know he'd go
[2:12:09] and the laundromen do his thing and
[2:12:11] customers come back in a couple days to
[2:12:13] claim what was rightfully his
[2:12:17] but he couldn't claim it
[2:12:19] if the pieces didn't match
[2:12:23] he had to come with the same thing that
[2:12:26] the Chinese man had
[2:12:27] [Music]
[2:12:29] and when they came they would match them
[2:12:31] papers together
[2:12:32] and that Chinese laundroman would know
[2:12:37] yours
[2:12:39] well you see
[2:12:40] Jesus is coming for his own
[2:12:44] first he had give us his spirit
[2:12:49] the bride the church had to come up into
[2:12:52] a fullness and stature of Jesus Christ
[2:12:57] to where all the powers that Jesus had
[2:13:00] is now in the church
[2:13:03] all the authority that Jesus had is now
[2:13:06] in the church it has to be in the church
[2:13:09] for that's the only thing that Jesus
[2:13:11] will come for
[2:13:14] is going to come for a people that is
[2:13:16] unlike him that has the same attributes
[2:13:20] The Same Spirit the same power the same
[2:13:22] word the same Authority she must be like
[2:13:25] him
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:28] say well I go to church I've been
[2:13:30] religious that don't mean anything
[2:13:34] unless we know him in the power of his
[2:13:37] resurrection
[2:13:38] that's the only ones he's coming for
[2:13:40] that's the jewels that he's coming to
[2:13:42] claim
