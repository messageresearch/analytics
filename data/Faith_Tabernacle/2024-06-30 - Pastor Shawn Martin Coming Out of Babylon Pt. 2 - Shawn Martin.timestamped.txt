[47:01] to serve the Lord and um uh we want to
[47:06] remember uh communion this evening and
[47:10] um also as it was announced uh
[47:14] remembering uh sister py and uh saw her
[47:19] visited with her a little bit this
[47:20] morning and uh doing doing good so we
[47:25] thank the Lord for that and getting her
[47:27] appetite back and um she was able to
[47:31] walk uh just a little bit but um praying
[47:35] that uh as they she starts that
[47:39] rehab um it'll help her out a lot better
[47:42] and um of course got to um um see the
[47:48] doctor about her arteries but just
[47:51] believing that the Lord will just uh
[47:53] unclog them amen and uh but it was good
[47:57] to to see her in good spirits today and
[48:02] um so she wanted me to thank you for
[48:05] your prayers and uh those of you that
[48:08] are able to visit
[48:09] call uh there and um so she's at warm
[48:14] Hearth uh now and uh so close uh close
[48:19] by so we're glad for that but uh she
[48:23] should be in there about two weeks I
[48:24] think the doctor said so
[48:27] um anyway if you can visit with her I
[48:29] know she appreciate that loves the
[48:32] company amen and of course um we want to
[48:37] keep um brother sheman sister Bethany as
[48:41] well as the baby in our prayer and um
[48:45] Lord just uh continue to be with them
[48:48] and um I think they're ready to come
[48:51] home of course uh I would be too but uh
[48:55] anyways um just believing that the
[48:58] Lord's going to just uh take care of
[49:00] that baby amen and um the doctors um
[49:06] they were going to do a spinal well you
[49:08] know I I most of you probably already
[49:11] know but they were going to uh the
[49:13] babies got um urinary tract infection so
[49:18] they
[49:19] were trying to figure out what caused
[49:22] the infection um most usually
[49:27] um uh for the male uh uh if he if if a
[49:33] male gets it then it's usually comes
[49:35] from the blood uh stream or so there's
[49:39] three ways he can get it but uh anyway
[49:42] so they're wanting to make sure that the
[49:45] infection uh if it is in the bloodstream
[49:48] didn't go up into the spine up to the
[49:50] brain and so they were going to do a
[49:52] spinal tap and uh doctor got ready for
[49:56] that and he noticed something in the
[49:58] spine close uh close down to um uh the
[50:05] tailbone there and uh so he halted that
[50:09] and and ordered a
[50:12] um uh an ultrasound so they had the
[50:15] ultrasound
[50:17] done uh but it wasn't it didn't satisfy
[50:21] them um there and so the doctor um is
[50:26] wanted to do a CT scan but in order to
[50:29] do that they'd have to take the baby
[50:31] move him downstairs and the doctor don't
[50:34] want to move the baby at this time and
[50:37] um
[50:38] so um uh he did tell them that he's very
[50:43] glad that he stopped and and did not uh
[50:47] proceed with the spinal tap um so
[50:51] anyways uh I guess you know they're kind
[50:54] of looking for spinal menitis and uh
[50:56] different things and um if if the
[51:01] infection has gotten up into the brain
[51:03] they need to take care of it right away
[51:06] uh the doctor said which
[51:08] will be about 3 weeks of
[51:12] medication uh to clear it up but they do
[51:15] not want their they'd rather not or
[51:18] don't want to give him the medication if
[51:20] they don't know if the infection is in
[51:25] the brain and so anyways uh so right now
[51:29] they're they've got the baby on a um
[51:33] medication to take care of that UTI uh
[51:37] which will be uh believe for 7 days and
[51:41] then at the end of seven days they'll
[51:44] figure out what they need to do uh so we
[51:47] need to just pray um that they won't
[51:50] have to do a spinal tap for one and um
[51:54] that um you know the Lord will just take
[51:57] care of that little child and U of
[52:00] course give uh brother Shmi sister
[52:04] Bethany a um just a real piece and um
[52:09] you know they're keeping their head up
[52:11] and uh but brother shi's about to go
[52:13] steer crazy he's uh you know brother
[52:16] Shmi he's a a people's person and and uh
[52:21] don't like just sitting around and so uh
[52:24] I'm sure he would appreciate the prayers
[52:28] and um uh but sister Bethany seems to be
[52:31] doing good and uh they appreciate all
[52:34] your prayers your visits and the things
[52:37] that you have done uh for them and uh so
[52:40] the Lord is good amen and so uh if you
[52:44] have your Bibles we're going to turn to
[52:46] Revelations the 18th
[52:51] chapter amen good to see brother Matthew
[52:55] amen and working a lot of hours uh here
[52:59] lately but um it's always good to be
[53:03] with God's
[53:04] people
[53:13] amen and um we will um before we go into
[53:18] the word maybe we just bow our heads
[53:20] and talk to the Lord we certainly need
[53:25] him
[53:26] and as the prophet said you know we can
[53:29] by our physical ability we can open the
[53:32] Bible we can read it with our natural
[53:34] eyes but it takes God to reveal it to
[53:38] us
[53:40] father Lord we realize the
[53:45] sacredness of this
[53:47] moment as part of the service Lord our
[53:52] souls are resting upon your INF ible
[53:58] word father we want to know we want to
[54:01] be assured
[54:03] we we want to be ready and Lord It's
[54:07] Your
[54:08] word father that helps
[54:12] us washes us cleanses
[54:15] us prepares us for this great event
[54:18] that's
[54:19] coming father we don't want to take this
[54:22] lightly but we pray Lord that you would
[54:26] just
[54:27] anoint us anoint me Father help me to
[54:31] get myself out of the way and Lord Jesus
[54:35] that you would send your word into the
[54:40] audience here and or whoever might be
[54:44] listening online and may your spirit
[54:46] follow the word and Lord Quicken it to
[54:50] our hearts pray that you would just give
[54:53] me understanding and help me Lord and
[54:57] and uh to say what you would have us to
[55:00] say father for without you we're
[55:04] nothing oh God we commit this into your
[55:07] hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the
[55:11] church
[55:12] says
[55:14] amen uh Revelations the 18th
[55:18] chapter um and we'll just uh go ahead
[55:21] and read the start at the first verse
[55:23] and after these things I saw another
[55:25] angel
[55:27] come down from heaven having great power
[55:30] and the Earth was lightened with his
[55:32] glory and he cried mightily with a loud
[55:36] or with a strong
[55:37] voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen
[55:41] is fallen and has become the habitation
[55:43] of devils and the hold of every foul
[55:46] Spirit and the cage of every unclean and
[55:49] hateful
[55:50] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[55:53] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[55:56] Kings of the Earth have committed
[55:58] fornication with uh her and the
[56:01] merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich
[56:04] through the abundance of her
[56:07] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[56:09] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[56:13] people they be not partakers of her sins
[56:17] and that you receive not of her
[56:20] plagues amen you can have your seats
[56:26] this
[56:27] morning and um I'm going to just use the
[56:33] title again uh coming out of
[56:37] Babylon and uh we believe that this is
[56:40] the age the time that God is calling his
[56:44] people out yes of
[56:47] Babylon and U if if he has called us to
[56:52] come out then it behooves us to know uh
[56:56] what we're we're coming out of uh what
[57:00] do we come out of um and uh this this
[57:04] might seem uh little Elementary
[57:08] to uh some of us and and uh yet there
[57:14] may be some here or watching online that
[57:20] uh don't know what it is that we've come
[57:22] out
[57:23] of uh and this isn't something that we
[57:28] should take lightly because our soul is
[57:30] resting upon this for only those that
[57:33] come out and truly delivered uh will be
[57:37] in the Rapture and uh they're the
[57:42] Overcomers of this laysan age right and
[57:46] uh so I uh I ain't I ain't a teacher
[57:51] like brother Terry is uh but we we pray
[57:54] that we can make some sense and and and
[57:58] these
[57:59] things um but if you notice that God is
[58:04] commanding us to come out of her and uh
[58:07] it's a she uh and so uh it's it's a
[58:11] woman that we are to separate ourselves
[58:15] from and have nothing to do with her and
[58:19] and of course uh if we look at where
[58:23] this woman is um
[58:26] uh we we could read there in Revelations
[58:30] the 17th
[58:32] chapter and the second verse it says uh
[58:37] so he carried me away in the spirit Into
[58:40] the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit
[58:42] upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of
[58:45] names of
[58:46] blasphemy having seven heads and 10
[58:51] horns then if you go to the ninth verse
[58:55] uh it's says and here is the mind which
[58:58] hath wisdom the seven heads are seven
[59:02] mountains on which the woman
[59:06] sth and so this actually gives us a um
[59:12] a
[59:15] geographical
[59:16] location as to where uh she
[59:20] is and
[59:23] um and we know that to be wrong
[59:26] right for there is no City uh in the
[59:30] world that has been
[59:31] celebrated as the city of Rome for uh
[59:35] its situation on Seven
[59:39] Hills Pagan poets and this isn't
[59:42] Christian this is just Pagan poets and
[59:45] orators uh have all characterized Rome
[59:49] as the Seven Hill
[59:51] City one writer declared Rome has has
[59:56] both become the most beautiful city in
[59:58] the world and alone has surrounded for
[1:00:02] herself seven Heights with a
[1:00:06] wall another spoke of Rome as being the
[1:00:10] lofty City on Seven Hills which governs
[1:00:13] the whole
[1:00:15] world uh one historian uh said uh to
[1:00:20] call Rome the city of the Seven Hills
[1:00:23] was by its citizens held to be at as
[1:00:27] descriptive as to call it by its own
[1:00:30] proper
[1:00:32] name uh another writer made reference to
[1:00:35] Rome by saying the gods who have set
[1:00:38] their affection on the Seven Hills
[1:00:41] making reference to Rome yeah uh another
[1:00:47] made reference to Rome when using the
[1:00:49] phrase the seven dominating
[1:00:53] heels uh there uh one Pagan Emperor
[1:00:58] wrote a letter to another and declared
[1:01:00] himself to be a citizen of Rome by
[1:01:03] introducing himself as a man from The
[1:01:06] Seven Mountains so it's widely widely
[1:01:10] known that that
[1:01:12] Rome uh uh is is sets upon uh Seven
[1:01:19] Mountains seven heels uh whatever so so
[1:01:23] this woman is in Rome
[1:01:27] um and and of course uh this woman in
[1:01:31] the Bible is is not given a good name uh
[1:01:36] but the Bible calls her the great
[1:01:39] and and so now there are there are
[1:01:43] people who will readily
[1:01:46] agree uh that uh Rome and uh is is the
[1:01:52] um or this woman the great uh is
[1:01:56] the Catholic Church uh Rome uh there but
[1:02:01] uh but the Bible also says that she is
[1:02:04] the mother of harlots she's not the
[1:02:06] mother of
[1:02:07] sons uh but she's the mother of of
[1:02:11] harlots and so uh of course the Bible
[1:02:15] saying that she is a the great a
[1:02:17] is an immoral woman or a
[1:02:23] prostitute and and she's the mother of
[1:02:27] prostitutes uh of of daughters that are
[1:02:31] immoral uh for they are Harlot she she's
[1:02:34] the mother of harlots and so what it is
[1:02:37] it's a woman who lives untrue to her
[1:02:40] marriage
[1:02:41] vow and uh and so uh now the Bible calls
[1:02:47] uh and of course Revelation is a book of
[1:02:49] symbols but uh the Bible calls her a
[1:02:52] woman uh but we we realize that woman
[1:02:57] represents uh Church uh Church uh uh
[1:03:01] Through the Bible uh uh God has used
[1:03:05] women in in uh the Bible uh to to Bear
[1:03:11] witness or as a type of of the church
[1:03:15] and so there are good women uh
[1:03:17] representing the bride of Christ there
[1:03:19] are bad immoral women or whatever that
[1:03:23] represents the the carnal Church Church
[1:03:27] uh but so so when you you look at uh Eve
[1:03:31] or you look at Sarah and you you read
[1:03:33] about Tamar or Ruth or Jezebel or Mary
[1:03:38] or uh uh they their lives are depicting
[1:03:42] uh the church and and what what is the
[1:03:46] these things uh Hagar and and and such
[1:03:50] and and so uh uh uh uh so the the bride
[1:03:55] of Christ
[1:03:56] uh Jesus talks about the wise Virgin uh
[1:03:59] well we we know that that what he was
[1:04:02] talking about when he's speaking of the
[1:04:04] wise virgin he's talking about the
[1:04:05] Church of Jesus Christ which is the
[1:04:08] bride of Christ so the Church of Christ
[1:04:11] is a woman as well and typified Through
[1:04:14] the Bible as such and and things uh the
[1:04:18] the Catholic Church by its own
[1:04:21] declaration claims to be uh the mother
[1:04:25] Church
[1:04:26] and the prophet of God says and and
[1:04:28] they're correct uh they are the mother
[1:04:30] Church the Catholic Church uh uh uh and
[1:04:35] and it is the first organization to be
[1:04:38] established right well I looked up this
[1:04:41] word organization because we talk about
[1:04:44] organization we talk about denominations
[1:04:46] and and such uh but organization is
[1:04:50] characterized by complete Conformity to
[1:04:54] the standards and requirements of an
[1:04:58] organization it's a group of persons
[1:05:01] formally joined together for some common
[1:05:06] interest um so so now uh there are other
[1:05:10] words to to that are used to describe an
[1:05:14] organization such as a
[1:05:16] society uh an institution a board or uh
[1:05:21] a fraternity or Association or or things
[1:05:25] like that so the Catholic church is is
[1:05:29] the mother of of harlots or we we could
[1:05:33] say it another way she's the mother of
[1:05:37] organizations or
[1:05:39] denominations uh denomination that is
[1:05:42] exactly what a denomination is it's an
[1:05:45] organization uh uh actually it says
[1:05:48] denomination is a religious
[1:05:50] organization whose
[1:05:52] congregation is United in at adherence
[1:05:56] to its beliefs and practices so so this
[1:06:00] is if you're going to be a Baptist uh
[1:06:03] and you join that that uh uh
[1:06:07] denomination then you are joined there
[1:06:11] by its adhering to its beliefs and its
[1:06:15] practices if you're a Jehovah's Witness
[1:06:18] if you're a Mormon if you're if you're
[1:06:20] whatever and and and so much are they
[1:06:24] joined that uh uh you know uh a lot of
[1:06:28] times you can ask them are you a
[1:06:30] Christian and they'll actually tell you
[1:06:31] well I'm I'm Baptist or I'm I'm
[1:06:34] Methodist or I'm Pentecostal or I'm I'm
[1:06:37] that and and uh um you know I uh talking
[1:06:41] to one and I actually asked him are are
[1:06:44] you are you a Christian and and of
[1:06:47] course he told me no well I'm I'm and he
[1:06:50] told me the the the denomination that he
[1:06:52] belonged to and so that that's the n 19
[1:06:57] is is uh uh when you join that religious
[1:07:01] uh organization
[1:07:03] denomination and uh by being ad in in
[1:07:07] adherence to its beliefs and practices
[1:07:11] now brother brandom says now she is a
[1:07:14] mother talking of the Catholic church
[1:07:18] and we'll we'll try to get into it more
[1:07:20] as we go uh uh but she is a mother and
[1:07:24] has produced produced daughters so if
[1:07:27] she is a mother church then she has
[1:07:30] produced
[1:07:31] churches uh uh and and and so now he
[1:07:35] says now a daughter comes out of a woman
[1:07:38] a woman robed in Scarlet is sitting on
[1:07:43] the Seven Hills of Rome she is a harlot
[1:07:47] in other words a a prostitute an
[1:07:50] immoral woman see and has born daughters
[1:07:54] and those daughters are the Protestant
[1:07:57] churches that came out of her and then
[1:08:00] went right back into organization and
[1:08:04] nanism so this mother of the daughter
[1:08:07] churches is called a that is a
[1:08:10] woman who was untrue to her marriage vow
[1:08:13] she was married to God and then went off
[1:08:16] fornicating with the devil and in her
[1:08:20] fornications she has brought forth
[1:08:23] daughters that are just like her this
[1:08:26] mother and daughter combination is anti-
[1:08:30] word everybody say anti- word this this
[1:08:34] this this mother and daughter
[1:08:36] combination is anti- word
[1:08:40] anti-ir and consequently antir chist for
[1:08:45] if you're anti- word you're
[1:08:48] Antichrist see and so now we we know
[1:08:52] that uh Luther Luther came out of uh of
[1:08:57] of the woman uh the Catholic church and
[1:09:01] um and then became the second or uh
[1:09:05] organization then from him come uh uh uh
[1:09:10] zwingley I guess and and then Calvin and
[1:09:13] then come the Anglican church and
[1:09:17] organization uh all of them into
[1:09:19] organizations and then come down to the
[1:09:21] Methodist and out of the Methodist comes
[1:09:24] Alexander Campbell and out of uh
[1:09:26] Alexander Campbell Came John Smith and
[1:09:29] and then the Christian church and then
[1:09:32] uh out of that they they uh comes uh
[1:09:35] they broke up into four or five churches
[1:09:38] and and uh Church of Christ and then
[1:09:41] just run into all kinds of isms and and
[1:09:44] and these things and and then from there
[1:09:47] comes the Baptist uh uh church and you
[1:09:50] know from it comes a lot of isms
[1:09:52] fragments and and you've got free wi
[1:09:56] first and second and and all kinds of um
[1:10:00] uh uh uh denominations from that and
[1:10:03] then you've got the methodists and they
[1:10:04] broke and fragmented and and uh these
[1:10:07] things then you've got the Nazarene then
[1:10:09] you've got the pilgrims Holiness and and
[1:10:12] and they're they're fragmented and and
[1:10:15] it just keeps breaking off and breaking
[1:10:17] off and breaking off and then it come
[1:10:19] down to Pentecost and and and Pentecost
[1:10:23] um come out was doing great and and then
[1:10:28] and what did it do it it it organized
[1:10:31] itself back into a
[1:10:33] denomination and you've got UPC you've
[1:10:36] got uh Assemblies of God uh you got
[1:10:39] oness and you you just got so many uh uh
[1:10:43] uh uh fragments even in Pentecost and
[1:10:47] and so uh brother R says what what they
[1:10:50] done is they done the same thing that
[1:10:52] their Mammy did and uh the Catholic
[1:10:54] Church ain't that rhyme they went right
[1:10:57] back and organized and became a
[1:11:00] denomination so and and when we're
[1:11:03] thinking of these things we're not
[1:11:04] talking about the people there are good
[1:11:06] people in every
[1:11:08] denomination uh uh uh but the thing is
[1:11:12] is they're in a sinking ship amen amen
[1:11:16] you you you you know when the Titanic if
[1:11:19] if you were in another safe safe place
[1:11:23] you know and and you're you're screaming
[1:11:25] at them people to get off that ship
[1:11:27] somehow get off the ship you know well
[1:11:29] you're not mad at them people you you
[1:11:31] just know you know that that ship is
[1:11:34] going down and somebody's going to die
[1:11:36] somebody's going to perish ain't that
[1:11:38] right and and so uh um well see so the
[1:11:42] people are united in their adherence of
[1:11:46] of the beliefs and practices of that
[1:11:49] denomination and that's why it's so hard
[1:11:52] for people to understand why their
[1:11:56] denomination is is wrong uh why it's
[1:11:59] wrong is because they have built their
[1:12:02] whole life on these things but each
[1:12:05] denomination has bylaws well I I looked
[1:12:08] up bylaws a a rule adopted by an
[1:12:12] organization chiefly for the government
[1:12:15] of its members and the regulation of its
[1:12:19] Affairs and and of course every church
[1:12:22] has got to have some type of a
[1:12:24] government and and some type of a
[1:12:27] standard uh uh to to to live by uh but
[1:12:32] it's as long as it doesn't disagree with
[1:12:35] God's word ain't that right and and then
[1:12:39] every each denomination has a Creed they
[1:12:42] they live by a Creed they give this
[1:12:44] Creed to the people and the people uh
[1:12:47] live and adhere to this Creed well what
[1:12:51] is a Creed it's an aor authoritative and
[1:12:55] notice that it's it's an authoritative
[1:12:58] formula of religious beliefs so so a lot
[1:13:02] of people don't know if if they're in a
[1:13:05] Baptist Church or if they're in a in
[1:13:08] some denomination well they don't know
[1:13:10] really what the Bible says because they
[1:13:14] know more about what their Church
[1:13:16] teaches and what their Church okays and
[1:13:19] and what their Church agrees with
[1:13:20] because that's what they have to adhere
[1:13:22] to more than the word of God
[1:13:26] ain't that right and and that is the
[1:13:28] truth and so well there there was a a
[1:13:32] Creed that that was uh uh
[1:13:36] uh uh formulated at Nia Council and that
[1:13:40] was called the nyine Creed and and so I
[1:13:45] look this up the nyine Creed is a
[1:13:48] statement of Christian faith that
[1:13:51] expresses the beliefs of the early
[1:13:54] Christian Church
[1:13:56] which uh it was originally written in
[1:14:00] 3:25 at the First Council of NAIA and
[1:14:04] and hope hopefully we we can get more
[1:14:06] into that but you you ought to uh if you
[1:14:09] have the chance go go study the church
[1:14:11] ages listen to them and and and these
[1:14:15] things but but uh uh so this this come
[1:14:19] this this agree this n Council had come
[1:14:24] together
[1:14:26] uh and it it it wasn't a gathering of
[1:14:28] God remember God called his people
[1:14:31] together on the day of
[1:14:32] Pentecost and and gave them the baptism
[1:14:36] of the Holy Ghost and initiated them in
[1:14:38] the church you never see them living by
[1:14:41] a Creed you just saw them living uh and
[1:14:46] being led by the spirit of God uh but uh
[1:14:50] it so so this niia Creed uh it was held
[1:14:53] in uh this Council was held in ancient
[1:14:57] NAA um and uh the Creed was created to
[1:15:01] oppose
[1:15:03] heresies heresies and uh that that were
[1:15:07] troubling the church at the time now
[1:15:10] these heresies that was troubling the
[1:15:12] church they were Christian values that
[1:15:16] the Apostle had that was troubling and
[1:15:19] that church was was
[1:15:22] lukewarm uh or uh so-call Christians
[1:15:26] that were troubled by the gospel that
[1:15:30] that uh the the the saints were were the
[1:15:34] elect was teaching and preaching you
[1:15:38] understand and and so uh this so it
[1:15:42] wasn't a Believers that that brought
[1:15:45] this Council together actually the
[1:15:47] Believers uh uh protested it but but it
[1:15:50] was a bunch of of uh make Believers if
[1:15:54] you want to call it that and and they
[1:15:56] were bothered and they wanted to change
[1:15:59] things uh uh you know and and and so uh
[1:16:03] they formulated this Creed to oppose
[1:16:06] heresies that were troubling the church
[1:16:09] at the time uh and and so uh
[1:16:12] particularly those related to the
[1:16:15] Trinity and the nature of Christ and so
[1:16:19] uh uh a Creed also is Set uh is is a a
[1:16:25] set of fundamental beliefs a guiding
[1:16:28] principle amen so now the church begins
[1:16:32] to take it upon themselves to guide the
[1:16:35] people to direct their minds to direct
[1:16:38] their belief system to to uh um and and
[1:16:42] so instead of just the Lord running the
[1:16:45] church and as as what uh uh God intended
[1:16:51] the Holy Spirit to run the church now it
[1:16:54] was a group of
[1:16:55] uh formulating a Creed amen and this is
[1:16:59] what was going to happen is that if you
[1:17:01] join the church if you join that
[1:17:04] denomination uh so then this is what you
[1:17:07] have to live by this is going to be your
[1:17:09] your guiding principle and and how many
[1:17:13] preachers have turned down the true
[1:17:16] gospel even though they have seen it to
[1:17:18] be the truth but their denomination is
[1:17:20] against it and and and can't preach it
[1:17:24] and and such because there is a Creed
[1:17:27] that is established and if they ever go
[1:17:30] outside that Creed then they're no
[1:17:33] longer or well they're ex communicated
[1:17:36] from from that
[1:17:38] denomination and so uh the N Creed uh
[1:17:42] also called the Creed of uh uh con
[1:17:48] constant conop um is is the defining
[1:17:53] statement of belief of
[1:17:55] mainstream
[1:17:57] Christianity now uh uh now think of that
[1:17:59] so this nying Creed is is um uh the
[1:18:04] defining statement of belief of
[1:18:07] mainstream Christianity in those
[1:18:09] Christian
[1:18:10] denominations uh that adhere to it and
[1:18:14] and and so uh uh and and and this is
[1:18:17] just uh I looked it up uh on internet
[1:18:20] and just kind of studying on this night
[1:18:22] looking up what this night seem Creed is
[1:18:26] and and and if you don't mind I'm going
[1:18:27] to read this the NY Creed it says I
[1:18:31] believe and this is where all have to
[1:18:34] abide by this I believe in one God the
[1:18:37] Father Almighty maker of heaven and
[1:18:39] Earth and of all things visible and
[1:18:42] invisible I believe in one Lord Jesus
[1:18:44] Christ the only begotten Son of God born
[1:18:47] of the father before all ages God from
[1:18:49] God light from light true God from true
[1:18:52] God begotten not made uh
[1:18:56] consubstantial with the father through
[1:18:58] him all things were made for us men and
[1:19:01] for our Salvation he came down from
[1:19:03] heaven and by the Holy Spirit was
[1:19:05] incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became
[1:19:08] man for our sake he was crucified under
[1:19:11] Pontius Pilate he suffered death and was
[1:19:13] buried and rose again on the third day
[1:19:15] in accordance with the scriptures he
[1:19:18] ascended into heaven and is seated at
[1:19:19] the right hand of the father he will
[1:19:21] come again in glory to judge the living
[1:19:23] and the dead and his Kingdom will have
[1:19:25] no end I believe in the Holy Spirit the
[1:19:29] Lord The Giver of Life who proceeds from
[1:19:31] the father and the son who with the
[1:19:33] father and the son is adored and
[1:19:35] glorified who has spoken through the
[1:19:36] prophets I believe in one Holy Catholic
[1:19:39] and Apostolic church I confessing
[1:19:42] confess one baptism for the Forgiveness
[1:19:44] of sins and I look forward to the
[1:19:47] resurrection of the dead and the life of
[1:19:49] the world to come amen so this is the
[1:19:52] Creed that that all most of your M
[1:19:54] stream denominations or whatever live by
[1:19:58] and and so um and if you if you notice
[1:20:01] uh the Ning Creed is officially uh one
[1:20:05] writer said accepted by the Catholic
[1:20:07] Orthodox and major Pro Protestant
[1:20:11] churches today in addition to the nying
[1:20:14] Creed there's the Apostles Creed and uh
[1:20:18] being officially accepted by Catholics
[1:20:21] and most
[1:20:22] Protestant uh denomination
[1:20:25] so then then we find that there is a a
[1:20:29] uh a um um comparison or a relationship
[1:20:35] correlation uh with the Catholic church
[1:20:38] and and the organization churches uh
[1:20:41] these things you know a a the wildest
[1:20:44] woman can bring forth a a a a girl and
[1:20:48] uh that girl be true virgin clean and
[1:20:52] all that and that girl can go straight
[1:20:54] if she wants to and and and and and so
[1:20:58] the prophet says Lutheran the Methodist
[1:21:00] and Baptist and all of them uh they went
[1:21:05] straight for a little while when their
[1:21:07] Founders were there preaching the gospel
[1:21:09] to them but now they go to shows dances
[1:21:13] television smoke you know they do
[1:21:16] everything else and stay home on Sunday
[1:21:19] you know and and so he says they have
[1:21:21] become a harlot just like their mother
[1:21:26] and and and so theyve let down standards
[1:21:29] they've let down biblical principles and
[1:21:33] and they've adopted things uh that their
[1:21:36] Church allows well you know uh how
[1:21:39] many's turned down this message because
[1:21:41] their Church doesn't teach it that way
[1:21:44] and and I I remember a man given uh a
[1:21:47] lady a Bible uh King James Bible and uh
[1:21:51] she was Catholic and and a few days
[1:21:54] later Returns the Bible to him and says
[1:21:56] I cannot read it says I've showed my
[1:21:58] priest and the priest says that's that's
[1:22:00] not right I'm I'm not able to read it
[1:22:02] and and here you are you know well that
[1:22:05] would have bothered me if someone
[1:22:06] telling me I can't read the Bible but
[1:22:09] but for them they their priest is all
[1:22:12] they know and their priest is the
[1:22:14] absolute uh their church is the absolute
[1:22:19] right can you say amen amen and and so
[1:22:23] uh the Catholic Church claim CLS to be
[1:22:25] the bride and wife of Christ uh as as
[1:22:29] you even see through the nuns how they
[1:22:32] they shave their their hair off and they
[1:22:35] pledge all their affections uh to Christ
[1:22:39] and and these things and they sincere as
[1:22:42] sincere can be but so
[1:22:45] blinded uh uh to to what God has called
[1:22:49] his bride to be now so why would God
[1:22:53] call this woman a the great
[1:22:57] uh well we we read it where and and got
[1:23:01] other scriptures but uh it's because she
[1:23:04] has committed
[1:23:06] fornication and and and and and what she
[1:23:09] has done is she's committed spiritual
[1:23:11] everybody say spiritual
[1:23:14] fornications and that is through her
[1:23:16] nickan Doctrine now the prophet says
[1:23:19] she's adopted Creeds instead of her
[1:23:22] husband's word ain't that right instead
[1:23:26] of becoming a real real true mate to her
[1:23:29] husband she took another book of Creeds
[1:23:34] and what was she the mother of harlots
[1:23:36] that did the same thing now you don't
[1:23:39] need any more explaining to that see you
[1:23:41] see where it's at what was it
[1:23:44] organization getting everybody say
[1:23:46] getting
[1:23:48] away from the word getting away from the
[1:23:53] word that's right another place
[1:23:55] committing fornication see leading
[1:23:58] people by denominations with her cup of
[1:24:02] iniquity of
[1:24:04] manmade Doctrine and pulling them away
[1:24:09] from the fountain filled with blood
[1:24:11] where the power of almighty God flows
[1:24:14] freely to manifest Jesus Christ another
[1:24:18] place what made her a well she
[1:24:21] rejected the word and took the
[1:24:23] denomination
[1:24:24] and she become a and what did her
[1:24:27] children do they were harlots which did
[1:24:30] the same thing rejected the word took to
[1:24:34] the denomination her children daughters
[1:24:38] churches and look at them now ain't that
[1:24:41] right now now to think of this influence
[1:24:45] though that this woman has this church
[1:24:48] uh uh s or uh Revelations 19 and2 tells
[1:24:52] us that she has corrupted the Earth with
[1:24:55] her fornication so she isn't just just
[1:24:59] uh in Rome sitting there corrupting her
[1:25:02] attendance in Rome but she's corrupted
[1:25:05] the Earth with her fornication uh
[1:25:09] Revelations 18:3 All Nations everybody
[1:25:11] say all nations All Nations have drunk
[1:25:16] of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:25:18] fornication and the kings of the earth
[1:25:21] so it didn't just stop with ppers and
[1:25:23] beggars but it's gone up all the way to
[1:25:26] the highest ranking of government the
[1:25:29] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:25:32] fornication with her I think it's
[1:25:34] strange that every president that we
[1:25:36] have from I don't know when uh it's been
[1:25:39] a few years now uh they all go to Rome
[1:25:42] for some reason uh uh to talk to the
[1:25:45] pope kind of interesting isn't it and
[1:25:47] then you've got uh most of our uh
[1:25:50] Congress and most of our Senate if not
[1:25:52] all are Catholics yes sir in some
[1:25:56] fashion or form ain't that right but but
[1:26:00] we find that all nations have drunk of
[1:26:02] the wine of her wrath in other words
[1:26:04] they have taken everybody say they have
[1:26:07] taken her nickan
[1:26:11] Doctrine they have taken her nickon
[1:26:16] Doctrine it's true now for themselves
[1:26:20] and what they have done they have done
[1:26:22] just as Cain did
[1:26:25] when he took wisdom after his mother
[1:26:28] Church Eve with his
[1:26:31] reasoning ain't that right he took her
[1:26:35] wisdom his mother church so to speak her
[1:26:40] wisdom which was
[1:26:42] reasoning Abel took
[1:26:46] Revelation ain't that right see and so
[1:26:49] the churches are doing the same thing
[1:26:51] showing what they've come from yeah amen
[1:26:54] come on yeah now uh this woman church
[1:26:58] it's also called mystery Babylon and and
[1:27:02] so when you look at it um uh one writer
[1:27:07] says it is the chief seat of adultery
[1:27:10] idolatry under the New Testament this
[1:27:13] mystery Babylon as the ancient Babylon
[1:27:17] was the chief seat of idolatry under the
[1:27:20] Old Testament see and and and so uh uh
[1:27:25] you you you the city of Rome
[1:27:28] um uh uh one one writer says that the
[1:27:33] the walls around that city of Rome was
[1:27:36] seven miles um all the way around seven
[1:27:39] miles and and brother brah says when
[1:27:43] Christianity first came to Rome there
[1:27:45] were 400 different Pagan
[1:27:50] temples the gods and goddesses
[1:27:55] within that seven mile walled City seven
[1:28:00] miles that's not too far that's right
[1:28:04] and in that City
[1:28:06] 400 we think it's rough when you got in
[1:28:12] Hickory 10
[1:28:16] churches and that's not including
[1:28:18] Baptist and all
[1:28:21] that and and but in that seven walled
[1:28:25] City there were temples erected for gods
[1:28:30] and
[1:28:31] goddesses that's incredible High
[1:28:35] number and and so it it shows it was
[1:28:37] Pagan now uh uh Revelations 17 And1 and
[1:28:42] there came out uh came one of the Seven
[1:28:44] Angels which had the seven vows and
[1:28:46] talked with me saying unto me come
[1:28:49] hither and I will show unto thee the
[1:28:52] Judgment of the great
[1:28:54] that sth upon many
[1:28:57] Waters now if you go to the 15th verse
[1:29:01] it it explains what the waters are he
[1:29:04] saith unto me the waters which thou
[1:29:07] sawest where the horse sth are
[1:29:10] peoples
[1:29:12] multitudes Nations and
[1:29:16] tongues and you say Amen so her
[1:29:19] influence is is going to
[1:29:22] spread this is what the prophecy is
[1:29:24] ain't that right and this wh church is
[1:29:28] sitting upon the waters she's sitting
[1:29:33] upon peoples multitudes Nations and and
[1:29:36] tongues showing that she has
[1:29:41] dominance dominance over them amen she
[1:29:45] has dominance over people
[1:29:48] multitudes
[1:29:50] Nations
[1:29:52] tongues and you say Amen right just this
[1:29:56] this little old church yeah with an
[1:30:01] old
[1:30:05] pop come on brother Ram says he can stop
[1:30:09] Wars he can start
[1:30:12] wars he says you know when when you know
[1:30:17] our President says something just really
[1:30:18] for America when you know another
[1:30:21] President of Russia or president of
[1:30:23] China or whatever they they just you
[1:30:25] know but when the pope speaks All
[1:30:28] Nations adhere to
[1:30:31] it because she has
[1:30:34] dominance
[1:30:36] hello and and so she's sitting upon the
[1:30:39] waters and and and brother Bram says it
[1:30:41] shows she has power throughout all
[1:30:45] nations tongues and people so this isn't
[1:30:49] just some little guy saying you know
[1:30:52] it'd be nice if we just do this and do
[1:30:54] this and do this no no no he's got
[1:30:59] power he's got power in the White
[1:31:04] House come on he's got power in in the
[1:31:09] Senate and Congress and probably ought
[1:31:13] to be quiet huh but it's
[1:31:16] true he's got power in
[1:31:20] Nations and it's a controlling power
[1:31:24] yeah so brother Ram said she controls
[1:31:27] the world with her powers a church
[1:31:32] yeah ain't that right and not only that
[1:31:36] but she controls churches with her
[1:31:39] powers see so Revelation
[1:31:42] 17:2 um with whom the kings of the Earth
[1:31:45] have committed fornication and the
[1:31:47] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[1:31:51] drunk right with the one
[1:31:54] of her
[1:31:55] fornication both Catholic and
[1:32:00] Protestant this isn't just her reach
[1:32:02] isn't just with
[1:32:04] Catholics it's her reach is in the
[1:32:08] Protestants and we're finding out as as
[1:32:11] as time is getting closer it ain't going
[1:32:14] to matter if you're Catholic or or
[1:32:16] Protestant they're all coming together
[1:32:19] it's becoming a big Melting
[1:32:22] Pot now ain't that right and and so uh
[1:32:27] uh so they' the kings of the Earth the
[1:32:31] inhabitants of the Earth have
[1:32:35] committed spiritual
[1:32:37] fornication with her taking her
[1:32:41] doctrines yeah taking her lifestyle true
[1:32:46] taking her Creeds in other words denying
[1:32:49] the very word of God yet having a relig
[1:32:53] religious form saying they are the bride
[1:32:56] of Christ saying they are one with God
[1:32:59] and yet committing adultery on him by
[1:33:03] taking uh a Creed of man instead of the
[1:33:06] word of
[1:33:07] God right ain't that
[1:33:10] right I hope that's all right so he
[1:33:13] carried me third verse he carried me
[1:33:15] away in the spirit Into the Wilderness
[1:33:17] and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet
[1:33:20] colored beast beast always represents
[1:33:23] power
[1:33:24] so she's sitting there with
[1:33:27] power ain't that right right and full of
[1:33:31] names of blasphemy Father Son and Holy
[1:33:34] Ghost and and such as that names of
[1:33:37] blasphemy having seven heads and Tin
[1:33:40] horns and the woman uh was arrayed in
[1:33:44] purple and scarlet color and and decked
[1:33:47] with gold and precious stones and Pearls
[1:33:50] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[1:33:53] a Abominations and filthiness of her
[1:33:56] fornication fornication is unclean
[1:33:58] living ain't that right and upon her
[1:34:02] forehead was a name written mystery
[1:34:04] Babylon the great the mother of harlots
[1:34:07] and Abominations of the earth and I saw
[1:34:10] the woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:34:13] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:34:16] of Jesus and when I saw her I wandered
[1:34:19] with great admiration so this wasn't
[1:34:22] some evil thing thing that he was
[1:34:24] looking at in in appearance she was
[1:34:30] beautiful and he was actually in
[1:34:32] admiration of her looking at her but yet
[1:34:36] he saw her with the blood of the
[1:34:40] Saints
[1:34:42] amen the origin of Babylon is found in
[1:34:46] the new in the Book of Genesis and we
[1:34:49] know the Book of Genesis is the book of
[1:34:51] Beginnings it's the C chapter every
[1:34:54] started that of today started all back
[1:34:56] there in the beginning and and uh so so
[1:35:01] uh what started there as a seed has
[1:35:05] matured in in this day reached its full
[1:35:09] potential uh in the age that we're
[1:35:11] living in Genesis 10 and 8 and Kush
[1:35:15] begat Nimrod and he began to be a mighty
[1:35:20] one in the earth talking of nimrod in
[1:35:23] other words he was a man of influence
[1:35:26] this Nimrod the word Nimrod it means to
[1:35:30] take to steal Rebel
[1:35:34] Tyrant and and so it it it was he who
[1:35:39] dared uh to challenge the supremacy of
[1:35:43] of God yeah he was known for his
[1:35:46] strength and ambition and he sought
[1:35:49] power and control Beyond human limits
[1:35:54] he was a mighty Hunter a a mighty
[1:35:57] warrior before the Lord wherefore it is
[1:36:00] said the ninth verse uh even as Nimrod
[1:36:05] the mighty Hunter Hunter before the Lord
[1:36:08] uh uh now you know I I looked up this
[1:36:11] and and and it says in the face of
[1:36:14] Yahweh signifying when it says he's a
[1:36:17] mighty Hunter before the Lord in the in
[1:36:19] the face of Yahweh signifying in
[1:36:22] opposition to the Lord so so he was
[1:36:26] against God he was a rebel against God
[1:36:30] and this started as a little seed in in
[1:36:33] the beginning and and and so uh uh and
[1:36:37] if you notice the 10th verse and the
[1:36:38] beginning of his kingdom was Babel Babel
[1:36:44] which is
[1:36:46] Babylon and and so uh uh that that's the
[1:36:49] original name for Babylon was Babel and
[1:36:52] and and so
[1:36:55] uh the message tells us you know uh uh
[1:36:58] that that kush uh nimrod's father
[1:37:03] actually uh
[1:37:04] began uh um uh Babel started by Kush the
[1:37:10] son of ham but it was brought to a
[1:37:14] kingdom of influence and of
[1:37:18] magnificence under his son
[1:37:21] Nimrod and so nimrod set out to
[1:37:24] accomplish three things and that was to
[1:37:27] build a strong Nation to propagate his
[1:37:30] own
[1:37:31] religion and this this
[1:37:34] matters uh uh in in this and to make a
[1:37:37] name for himself now this was the
[1:37:40] beginning and and and now we're looking
[1:37:43] at the end and we're seeing what effect
[1:37:47] that purpose that motive his actions had
[1:37:52] when he started this and how it has
[1:37:55] lingered all the way up to this time
[1:37:58] amen ain't that right uh uh so the three
[1:38:01] purposes again to build a strong Nation
[1:38:04] to propagate his own religion and to
[1:38:06] make a name for himself and he was
[1:38:09] successful at all three of of doing
[1:38:12] these things uh one writer says his his
[1:38:15] accomplishments were so Monumental that
[1:38:17] the kingdom of Babylon was called the
[1:38:19] head of gold amongst all World
[1:38:22] governments
[1:38:24] see and and and now we know that that as
[1:38:27] he he set out to propagate his own
[1:38:30] religion it was and it was satanic
[1:38:34] inspired that's right that that that's
[1:38:36] what it was and it gained
[1:38:39] prominence in throughout the world it it
[1:38:43] just didn't stay in Babel it it spread
[1:38:47] through the world at that time up till
[1:38:51] this now and and the scripture itself
[1:38:54] identifies that with
[1:38:57] Satan if if you'll look at it Isaiah 14
[1:39:01] And1 it says for the Lord will have
[1:39:03] mercy on Jacob and will choose and will
[1:39:06] yet choose Israel and set them in their
[1:39:09] own land and uh the strangers shall be
[1:39:13] joined with them and they shall clead to
[1:39:16] the house of Jacob and the people shall
[1:39:18] take them and bring them to their place
[1:39:20] and the house of Israel shall possess
[1:39:22] them in the land of the Lord for
[1:39:24] servants and handmaids and they shall
[1:39:26] take them captives whose captives they
[1:39:29] were and they shall rule over their
[1:39:33] oppressors what a prophecy and it shall
[1:39:35] come to pass in the day that the Lord
[1:39:38] shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and
[1:39:42] from thy fear and from the hard bondage
[1:39:45] wherein thou was made to serve that thou
[1:39:49] shalt take up this proverb against the
[1:39:51] king of Babylon
[1:39:53] and say how hath the oppressor ceased
[1:39:57] the Golden City ceased can you say Amen
[1:40:02] now if you look at that this ties with
[1:40:04] Revelations chap 17 and 18 this this
[1:40:09] prophecy so so God is clearly
[1:40:12] identifying Babylon as the oppressor of
[1:40:15] his
[1:40:16] elect amen hello and God is promising
[1:40:21] that he's going to deliver them yesen
[1:40:24] that they will rule over
[1:40:26] them they're going to rule over their
[1:40:30] oppressor yes praise the Lord can you
[1:40:32] say Amen so he is for telling of the
[1:40:36] demise of
[1:40:39] Babylon now the fifth verse the Lord
[1:40:41] hath broken the staff of the wicked and
[1:40:44] the scepter of rulers
[1:40:48] Babylon he who smoke the people in Wrath
[1:40:51] with a continual Str
[1:40:54] I thought of that how Brother brandham
[1:40:56] Talks of him that man beating that woman
[1:41:00] remember that with that stick beating
[1:41:01] that woman and she's hunkering down and
[1:41:05] brother brandham commanded him leave her
[1:41:09] alone what was it it and and and and and
[1:41:13] he described it as as the bride being
[1:41:16] stricken
[1:41:18] beaten oppressed can you say amen he who
[1:41:22] smoked the people in Wrath with a
[1:41:24] continual stroke he that rued the
[1:41:27] nations in Anger is persecuted and none
[1:41:29] hindereth the whole earth is at rest and
[1:41:32] is quiet they break forth into singing
[1:41:36] amen when when is this when when when
[1:41:39] Trump gets in and stops Wars yeah right
[1:41:43] this happens when when the city of God
[1:41:47] comes and settles upon that new Earth
[1:41:50] that's been renovated Babylon no longer
[1:41:54] exists its power is broken can you say
[1:41:58] Amen yay the fur trees Rejoice at thee
[1:42:02] and The Cedars of Lebanon saying since
[1:42:04] Thou Art laid down no fell is come up
[1:42:07] against us hell from beneath is moved
[1:42:11] for thee to meet thee at thy coming it
[1:42:15] stirreth up the dead for thee even all
[1:42:17] the chief ones of the earth it hath
[1:42:20] raised up from their Thrones all the
[1:42:23] Kings of the Nations and all all they
[1:42:26] shall speak uh uh and say unto thee art
[1:42:30] thou also become weak as we art thou
[1:42:33] become like unto us thy pomp is brought
[1:42:36] down to the grave and the noise of thy
[1:42:39] vows uh uh the worm is spread under thee
[1:42:42] and the worms cover thee ain't that
[1:42:45] right but now if you notice how God goes
[1:42:48] from using the word Babylon to Lucifer
[1:42:51] in the 12th verse how art th th fallen
[1:42:54] from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the
[1:42:56] morning how art thou cut down to the
[1:42:59] ground which did US weaken the Nations
[1:43:02] for thou Hast said in thine heart I will
[1:43:05] Ascend into heaven and I will exalt my
[1:43:08] throne above the stars of God and I will
[1:43:11] sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:43:13] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:43:16] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:43:18] clouds I will be like the most high so
[1:43:22] we can understand understand this
[1:43:23] inspiration that come to Nimrod to
[1:43:26] propagate his own religion amen uh uh is
[1:43:30] coming is is inspired from the devil
[1:43:33] itself yet Thou shalt be brought down to
[1:43:35] Hell to the sides of the pit they that
[1:43:38] see thee shall narrowly look upon thee
[1:43:40] and consider thee saying is this the man
[1:43:43] that made the Earth to tremble think of
[1:43:46] that church the enemy that you're
[1:43:48] dealing with is is
[1:43:51] nothing that's a exactly right
[1:43:54] little we're going to look at him and
[1:43:57] and is this the man that made the Earth
[1:43:59] to tremble that did shake the kingdoms
[1:44:01] ain't that right see so so another
[1:44:04] scripture that foretells of the
[1:44:06] destruction of Babylon is in Jeremiah 51
[1:44:09] and 52 wherefore behold the days come
[1:44:12] sayi the Lord that I will do judgment
[1:44:14] upon her graven images and through all
[1:44:17] her land the wounded shall groan though
[1:44:20] Babylon should Mount up to heaven and
[1:44:22] though she should fortify the height of
[1:44:24] her strength yet for me shall spoilers
[1:44:27] come unto her sayith the Lord now you
[1:44:32] know to think of what purpose Russia has
[1:44:34] in this age a lot of people don't
[1:44:36] understand why Russia is existing and
[1:44:38] how she's come from nothing to become a
[1:44:41] pre pre prominence in the Earth today
[1:44:44] well we know what it is don't we that's
[1:44:46] right see and and so her yet from me
[1:44:49] shall spoilers come unto her sayth the
[1:44:52] Lord a sound of a cry Cometh From
[1:44:54] Babylon and great destruction from the
[1:44:57] land of the cines because the Lord has
[1:45:01] spoiled Babylon and destroyed out of her
[1:45:04] the great voice when her waves do roar
[1:45:07] like Great Waters a noise of their voice
[1:45:10] is uttered because the spooler is come
[1:45:13] upon her even upon Babylon and her
[1:45:16] mighty men are taken and every one of
[1:45:18] their bow bows are broken uh uh for the
[1:45:21] Lord God of recompenses shall surely
[1:45:25] requite see uh and I will make drunk her
[1:45:29] princes and her wise men her captains
[1:45:32] rulers and mighty men and they shall
[1:45:35] sleep a Perpetual sleep and not waake
[1:45:38] sayth the king whose name is the Lord of
[1:45:41] hosts thus say the Lord of hosts the
[1:45:43] broad walls of Babylon shall utterly be
[1:45:46] utterly broken and her High Gate shall
[1:45:49] be burned with fire and the people shall
[1:45:51] labor in vain and the folk in the fire
[1:45:54] and they shall be weary ain't that right
[1:45:58] so so this is a prophecy of the demise
[1:46:01] of Babylon but nimrod's religion that he
[1:46:07] purposed to uh uh propagate invaded the
[1:46:12] whole world and and uh it's the basis of
[1:46:17] every system of
[1:46:20] idolatry it's it's the theme of
[1:46:24] Mythology though you know the prophet
[1:46:26] said though the names of the Gods differ
[1:46:28] in various sections of the land
[1:46:30] according to the language of the people
[1:46:32] but yet it that idolatry started there
[1:46:36] at Babylon so Nimrod built a super Tower
[1:46:41] and he built a super
[1:46:43] religion right ain't that right now now
[1:46:47] we find that there was at one time uh uh
[1:46:51] one language in all the Earth Genesis
[1:46:54] 11:1 and the whole earth was of one
[1:46:56] language and of one speech and it came
[1:46:59] to pass as they journeyed from the East
[1:47:02] that they found a plane in the land of
[1:47:05] shinar and they dwelt there and they
[1:47:08] said one to another go to let us make
[1:47:10] brick and burn them thoroughly and they
[1:47:13] had brick for stone and slime had they
[1:47:15] for Mortar and they said go too let us
[1:47:18] build a city and a tower whose top May
[1:47:20] reach into heaven under heaven and let
[1:47:23] us make us a name lest we be scattered
[1:47:26] abroad upon the face of the whole earth
[1:47:28] now the prophet said the motive behind
[1:47:30] the building of of the Tower of Babel
[1:47:33] was to build a man-made Earthly do
[1:47:37] Dominion right that that was the purpose
[1:47:40] to have a Dominion not just in a little
[1:47:44] section but but throughout the world can
[1:47:48] you say Amen so then uh uh uh you know
[1:47:53] uh I believe it was the prophet that
[1:47:54] that would say it and also other
[1:47:57] historians said that the reason that
[1:48:00] Nimrod built the Tower of Babel was in
[1:48:02] defiance of God God had just
[1:48:06] destroyed uh uh the the Earth with the
[1:48:10] flood ain't that right amen and and and
[1:48:14] and uh uh destroyed them and and so he
[1:48:18] thought in his mind his arrogancy that
[1:48:22] if I just if we just build a tower if
[1:48:25] God would ever do that again we would
[1:48:27] just climb up on the top and and we
[1:48:31] we'll defeat it we we'll survive you
[1:48:34] know we don't need an arc we just do it
[1:48:37] our own way what an arrogance and you
[1:48:41] say amen and and and so it was a
[1:48:44] religious Tower built to defy God
[1:48:49] himself and that's this is the seat of
[1:48:52] it a't that right and and so that same
[1:48:55] arrogance toward God has showed itself
[1:48:58] all through history of Babylon King
[1:49:01] Nebuchadnezzar for one king Bel chazar
[1:49:05] and and even in the Roman Kingdom and
[1:49:08] and now in in mystery Babylon and and so
[1:49:14] uh if you look here uh uh continue in uh
[1:49:17] Genesis 11 and 5 and the Lord came down
[1:49:20] to see the city and the tower which
[1:49:22] which the Lord the children of men build
[1:49:24] it and the Lord said behold the people
[1:49:26] is one and they have all one language
[1:49:29] and this they began to do and now
[1:49:32] nothing will be restrained from them
[1:49:34] which they have imagined to do go to let
[1:49:37] us go down and their confound their
[1:49:40] language that they may not understand
[1:49:42] one another's speech so the Lord
[1:49:45] scattered them abroad from then upon the
[1:49:47] face of all the Earth and they left off
[1:49:50] to build the city there for it is the
[1:49:53] name the is the name of it called Babel
[1:49:56] because the Lord did there confound the
[1:49:58] language of all the Earth and from then
[1:50:01] did the Lord scatter them abroad upon
[1:50:03] the face of all the Earth so again Babel
[1:50:07] is where confusion started right Bible
[1:50:11] is where Defiance from God uh uh uh uh
[1:50:15] toward God started doing something
[1:50:19] contrary and spread throughout the Earth
[1:50:22] uh uh you know but not only was there
[1:50:25] one language there was also one religion
[1:50:28] before Babel uh come into existence uh
[1:50:33] one uh historian well historians agree
[1:50:37] that that at one time all the peoples of
[1:50:40] the earth believed in one God not three
[1:50:44] one and they believed in one God Supreme
[1:50:47] Eternal invisible who by the word of his
[1:50:50] mouth spoke all things into existence
[1:50:53] and that in his character he was loving
[1:50:55] and good and just now that's exactly the
[1:51:00] way Pentecost started out on the day of
[1:51:03] Pentecost ain't that right the church
[1:51:06] started out one Lord one Spirit One
[1:51:10] Faith one
[1:51:12] baptism one God ain't that right yes sir
[1:51:17] and that that was the teaching there was
[1:51:19] no other teachings in the church and and
[1:51:22] and they all believe the same thing they
[1:51:24] all believe that you you know there
[1:51:27] there was no such thing as shaking a
[1:51:28] preacher's hand there was no such thing
[1:51:31] as Creeds that the church had to live by
[1:51:34] there there was no such thing as as you
[1:51:37] know uh intercession of saints and and
[1:51:41] and and confession to a priest and and
[1:51:45] all of these things but but see just as
[1:51:48] it was in in in that time uh uh so was
[1:51:52] it in this time it wasn't long after the
[1:51:55] day of Pentecost that that the nickan
[1:51:59] teaching was being taught in the first
[1:52:01] church age what 33 years or so after the
[1:52:06] the day of Pentecost and and and so that
[1:52:09] teaching of nickan ism uh was was
[1:52:13] started being taught in the first church
[1:52:15] age which was totally contrary to what
[1:52:18] God had in mind for the
[1:52:20] church in the second chur Church age it
[1:52:23] then become a Doctrine in the Third
[1:52:24] Church age C Catholicism was established
[1:52:28] at Nan Council ain't that right and so
[1:52:32] brother Bram says anyone knows that the
[1:52:33] Catholic church was brought into
[1:52:35] existence at the Nan Council see before
[1:52:38] there it was called nickan by God which
[1:52:42] means uh nicod to conquered to overcome
[1:52:45] overthrow the Ley ain't that right yes
[1:52:47] sir and and so if if you look for just a
[1:52:51] moment and I I won't keep you much
[1:52:53] longer but if if you look at it that
[1:52:56] what God says to that third Church age
[1:52:59] the Third Church age uh Revelations 2:14
[1:53:03] I have a few things against thee because
[1:53:06] thou Hast there them that hold the
[1:53:10] doctrine of
[1:53:12] balum ain't that right the doctrine of
[1:53:15] balum and what did Bam do he taught Bao
[1:53:19] to cast a stumbling block before the
[1:53:21] children of Israel to eat things
[1:53:24] sacrificed under Idols totally against
[1:53:26] God totally against God what God had
[1:53:29] told them and commanded them and to
[1:53:33] commit
[1:53:34] fornication who did that balam you know
[1:53:38] historian says that balam come from that
[1:53:41] area
[1:53:43] Babel and here he is
[1:53:46] now coming and trying to entice God's
[1:53:50] people that's right ain't that right
[1:53:53] yeah so hast thou also them that hold
[1:53:57] the doctrine of the nicians which thing
[1:54:00] I hate so it's the same thing same same
[1:54:04] kind of balum spirit that cause the
[1:54:07] people to fall away from the word of God
[1:54:12] and go into destruction
[1:54:15] true can you say Amen balam is the one
[1:54:18] that taught the Israel to stumble
[1:54:21] brought idolatry
[1:54:23] and and
[1:54:25] sinful uh uh what was that word excesses
[1:54:30] uh to Israel uh brother Braham said at
[1:54:33] Bal pure bpure and and you know that he
[1:54:37] tried to curs them but he couldn't do it
[1:54:40] he tried to get God to turn against them
[1:54:42] but he couldn't do that right remember
[1:54:44] that every time you know when he went
[1:54:46] out to curse them when he opened his
[1:54:48] mouth he did nothing but bless them and
[1:54:51] his prophecy still is is in effect of
[1:54:55] today and and so because he couldn't
[1:54:58] curse them he he invited he told BAC
[1:55:03] what you do is you invite Israel to come
[1:55:05] over for a feast a festival and and and
[1:55:08] bring them over to our side yeah and and
[1:55:12] you know brother Bram says just kind of
[1:55:14] like this tell them that we're all one
[1:55:16] it doesn't make any difference you know
[1:55:18] you you don't have to stand out you
[1:55:20] don't have to be different you don't
[1:55:22] have to you know we're all
[1:55:23] one we we do the same things you do we
[1:55:27] offer the same sacrifices you do we
[1:55:30] offer do this and we do that and we do
[1:55:32] this we're just as fundamental as you
[1:55:34] are but what Israel had they had the
[1:55:37] spirit of God with him they had the
[1:55:40] Vindication of a prophet they had the
[1:55:41] pillar of fire The Mercy Seat the Brazen
[1:55:44] altar the the brass serpent they had all
[1:55:47] of that Israel was or B was just
[1:55:50] fundamental
[1:55:52] they they were just formal in their in

[1:56:08] you just invite them over you'll swing
[1:56:11] them your way oh my you you you'll swing
[1:56:15] all of it your your way and so that was
[1:56:17] the purpose that's the purpose of that
[1:56:20] NAIA Council yeah right that was the
[1:56:23] purpose of this whole thing and look
[1:56:25] what it has happened the whole world has
[1:56:28] wandered after
[1:56:30] her on the kings of the earth and the
[1:56:33] inhabitants of the Earth have drunken
[1:56:35] from the wine of her fornication so
[1:56:38] brother Brown said see bac's teaching

[1:57:26] world and to where people don't know who

[1:57:31] are God's called you to be separate from
[1:57:34] the
[1:57:34] world it's just the facts and and we're
[1:57:38] finding that in the message church that
[1:57:40] that it's already hit the Pentecostals
[1:57:42] and the Baptist and every other religion
[1:57:45] out there but we're finding it it's
[1:57:46] starting to creep into the messes
[1:57:48] churches to where somehow they they feel
[1:57:51] like they need to raise that standard up
[1:57:54] the only standard you need to raise is
[1:57:56] your convictions not your
[1:57:58] dress
[1:58:01] hallelujah praise the Lord then you say
[1:58:03] amen amen so see and and and and if you

[1:59:42] sing baby sing amen amen amen whatever
[1:59:46] your talent is get it
[1:59:50] together but beauty is not on the
[1:59:53] outside brother Brown said yes it is
[1:59:55] natural for a woman to want and be
[1:59:57] pretty and and that you should want to
[1:59:59] be pretty why do you want to be pretty
[2:00:02] that's right amen for your next door
[2:00:05] neighbor that's it or for your
[2:00:08] husband that's right can you say amen
[2:00:11] amen but then brother Brandon tells us
[2:00:14] and Paul tells us that the beauty is
[2:00:17] really in in in inside character that's
[2:00:21] right that Godly character is what makes
[2:00:24] you
[2:00:25] beautiful and any godly man with the
[2:00:28] Holy Ghost will look at that and see
[2:00:32] more Beauty than they will outside them
[2:00:34] doors in the sexy
[2:00:37] dress that's amen that's right our Our
[2:00:43] Girls shouldn't feel like they have to
[2:00:45] be in
[2:00:46] competition our wives shouldn't feel
[2:00:48] like they have to be in competition amen
[2:00:51] amen and
[2:00:53] amen God help us not to us men to make
[2:00:57] our wives feel secure yes that they
[2:01:01] don't feel like they have to be in
[2:01:03] competition am I don't want my wife
[2:01:05] dressing like the world I don't want my
[2:01:07] girls dressing like the world I want
[2:01:09] them to know that they're holy they're
[2:01:11] valuable they're more valuable than
[2:01:13] anything that's
[2:01:15] right beautiful can you say amen amen so
[2:01:18] this is what Baum he he he enticed them
[2:01:22] got them sexy dressed women and all that
[2:01:25] and oh how they were made and how they
[2:01:27] could show themselves and they fell for
[2:01:31] it and began to commit
[2:01:34] adultery Israel began to intermingle
[2:01:38] with Moab they were to be a separate
[2:01:42] nation calling to God all together and
[2:01:45] they mingled they intermingled and the
[2:01:48] prophet said God never did forgive
[2:01:50] them you say amen amen see so they
[2:01:55] committed
[2:01:57] whoredom see and they fell for it and
[2:01:59] began to commit adultery and Bam know if
[2:02:01] God wouldn't curse him he'd take them
[2:02:04] over on this denominational side and
[2:02:06] cause the anger of God to kill them
[2:02:08] anyhow and let God kill them himself if
[2:02:12] he could ever get them out of the way of
[2:02:14] Truth you see what Satan wants to do get
[2:02:17] you out of the way of Truth and let God
[2:02:20] do it that's right
[2:02:22] right
[2:02:23] well babylon's and her daughters going
[2:02:27] to be thrown in the bed of
[2:02:29] worldliness and they're going to be
[2:02:31] killed with
[2:02:32] death can you say amen and it's
[2:02:35] happening spiritual death yes it's true
[2:02:39] so Satan has been the one that's always
[2:02:41] caused confusion he's the one he's the
[2:02:44] one that's always trying to steer up
[2:02:46] trouble he's the one every time that God
[2:02:48] sends a Revival Satan is the one to try
[2:02:51] to get distract the people from revival
[2:02:54] distract them from what God is
[2:02:56] doing amen ain't that right but God
[2:03:01] always has a people who will not go
[2:03:03] astray did you know the the the prophet
[2:03:05] says that well he says history Bears it
[2:03:08] out that those tribe those of the tribe
[2:03:10] of Shem remember there was ham Shem and
[2:03:13] japheth ham was cursed of God for what
[2:03:17] he did to his daddy right and and Nimrod
[2:03:22] Kush was the son of ham and Nimrod was
[2:03:25] the son of kush see coming from that
[2:03:28] hamide but there was a side of Shem and
[2:03:33] history says that those of the tribe of
[2:03:35] Shem Shem uh stood with the unchanging
[2:03:39] truth and were in solid opposition to
[2:03:43] those of ham who turned away from truth
[2:03:45] to the devil's LIE there's going to be
[2:03:48] somebody that stands for this truth that
[2:03:51] will not
[2:03:52] bow a knee they just ain't going to do
[2:03:54] it can you say Amen see so so all the
[2:03:59] ancient historians agreed that the
[2:04:00] Babylonia religion was not the original
[2:04:03] but it was the first to drift away from
[2:04:06] the
[2:04:07] original and and and so it was there at
[2:04:10] Babel that Satan corrupted the minds and
[2:04:13] hearts of men to where they rejected the
[2:04:15] truth think of that they rejected the
[2:04:18] truth and and so as he has set out to do
[2:04:22] uh from the very beginning he set out uh
[2:04:25] uh uh he drew worship away from God so
[2:04:28] that he himself could receive worship as
[2:04:31] though he were God and the servant uh
[2:04:34] instead of the servant and creature of
[2:04:36] God he he he posed himself to be God
[2:04:40] instead of the creature of God and he
[2:04:43] done this to be exalted ain't that right
[2:04:46] and he was able to
[2:04:48] accomplish what he started out to do do
[2:04:52] and what he started and and and was
[2:04:56] doing it spread throughout the whole
[2:04:57] world look at this we read of this in
[2:05:00] Romans 1:21 and I I won't keep you much
[2:05:03] longer uh uh actually if the musicians
[2:05:06] will come um so when they knew God they
[2:05:12] glorified him not as God neither were
[2:05:14] thankful now this all started remember
[2:05:17] this all started at Babel and years and
[2:05:21] years years and years it's all now is
[2:05:23] still filtrating when they knew God they
[2:05:26] glorified him not as God neither were
[2:05:29] thankful but became vain in their
[2:05:32] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[2:05:35] darkened professing themselves to be
[2:05:37] wise they became fools and changed the
[2:05:40] glory of the uncorruptible god into an
[2:05:43] image made like to corruptible man to
[2:05:45] birds and four-footed beasts and
[2:05:48] creeping things wherefore God also gave
[2:05:50] them up to unclean to the lust of their
[2:05:52] own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies
[2:05:54] between themselves who changed the truth
[2:05:57] of God into a lie and worshiped and
[2:05:59] serve the creature more than the Creator
[2:06:02] who is blessed forever ain't that right
[2:06:05] see so so being vain in their
[2:06:09] imaginations this is where the people
[2:06:11] are today vain in their
[2:06:13] imaginations coming up with all kinds of
[2:06:16] things that's right and the Heart being
[2:06:19] filled with Darkness they accept Ed a
[2:06:22] corrupted religion till they worship
[2:06:25] creatures and not the Creator and what
[2:06:27] is Satan he's a
[2:06:29] creature he's a creature of
[2:06:32] God ain't that right the son of the
[2:06:34] morning amen and notice Paul identifies
[2:06:39] him there in 2 Thessalonians 2 and 3 as
[2:06:43] the one who opposeth and exalteth
[2:06:46] himself above all that is called God or
[2:06:49] that is worshiped so that he has
[2:06:52] God sth in the temple of God showing
[2:06:56] himself that he is God see not that he's
[2:06:59] a creature but that he is God that's can
[2:07:04] you say Amen so it wasn't just a
[2:07:06] confusion of languages that started
[2:07:08] there it was a confusion of religion
[2:07:11] right
[2:07:12] confusion you love the Lord we could go
[2:07:15] on and on about these things and Lord
[2:07:19] willing we'll
[2:07:20] continue uh uh on but I I'm so glad that
[2:07:24] God has called us out of
[2:07:26] confusion called us out to where we can
[2:07:29] truly know what we believe amen we can
[2:07:34] truly know the real God amen amen I love
[2:07:39] the Lord amen amen thinking of what
[2:07:42] brother brandham said you know of how
[2:07:45] that people are worshiping Satan
[2:07:46] thinking they're worshiping God that's
[2:07:48] right and Satan is being put up on the
[2:07:51] thr by his people by the people because
[2:07:55] they have gotten so twisted up yes they
[2:07:58] don't even know God anymore claiming to
[2:08:00] know him claiming to have him claiming
[2:08:03] that his name is with him but God says
[2:08:05] I'll put my name in nowhere I ain't
[2:08:07] going to put my name there's only one
[2:08:08] place I'll put my name that's right
[2:08:10] ain't that right and in that place I'll
[2:08:12] meet the worshipper any other place any
[2:08:15] other gate any other thing I ain't going
[2:08:17] to meet the worshipper there they can
[2:08:19] worship they can cry they can boohoo
[2:08:21] they can dance they can shout they can
[2:08:23] preach they can go to church they can do
[2:08:25] all the rituals they can do all the
[2:08:27] things that and and and be fundamental
[2:08:31] in their
[2:08:32] beliefs but I ain't going to meet him
[2:08:34] there there's only one place that I will
[2:08:36] meet the worshipper and that's where I
[2:08:37] put my name and his name is in
[2:08:40] Christ can you say
[2:08:42] amen and that bride is Miss Jesus Christ

[2:16:04] other day the reason for that child's

[2:16:18] years of them confessing and Le in God
