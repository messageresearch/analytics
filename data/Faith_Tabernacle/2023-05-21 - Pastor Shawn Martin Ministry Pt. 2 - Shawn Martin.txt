paradise and to be with the Lord and I'm so glad and if it could bring them out and he can bring us out and and change your bodies one of these days it's it's made a way for us to come back Amen in fellowship with God Amen the musicians can be dismissed it's good to just see everyone and I'm going to read this here it says Hearts touched by the Lord's kindness says can't help but be grateful thank you so much brother Sean we were unable to attend the meetings this year but so appreciated the live stream Services you provided it wasn't the same as being there but the presence of the Lord was felt thank you brother Sean and Saints for all the efforts to have these meetings such a blessing if the Lord tarries another year we hope to be there with you all God bless you brother Scott and sister Norma Hunter and they've been attending our meetings for a little while but wasn't able to come this year they're from Indiana but I wanted to read that to you and we had such a great time in the Lord and I heard that brother Cole it was touched and and gave his heart to the Lord I yes and so we're really thankful for that and the Lord just and we just pray that the Lord will continue to bless him and and just build him up and and in the Lord and strengthen him and Amen to me that's that's what it's all about amen is just getting closer to the Lord a relationship with God amen and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to First Corinthians the the fourth chapter amen it's good to have everyone that was gone over the weekend last weekend and back in the house of the Lord praise the Lord and before we go into the word may we just borrow heads and talk to the Lord father we've sung the songs we've worshiped Lord and that was to create an atmosphere for you to come Among Us and and we pray that Lord you'd feel welcome now we're asking that you would just speak to every heart father you see what is on my heart and pray that you'd help me deliver it and just get myself out of the way that you could speak to your people and Lord help them just to get themselves out of the way that they can hear and receive of you father Lord any spirit that would try to hinder the service we pray that you would drive it away Lord and may you be glorified we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen First Corinthians the fourth chapter and I'm just going to read the first verse but it says let a man sow account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God Amen you can have your seeds and this may be just a little odd um scripture reading for but I I hope to um make sense of it but the what I want to say but I'm wanting to continue on the uh subject of last Sunday um there uh and so I'm going to title the the subject of ministry and uh I'm not going to be able to finish it all this morning so I'm going to just take my time for a few minutes and and build on this thought but the the word ministry um is an agent or instrument a person or thing through which something is accomplished an agent or an instrument a person or thing through which something is accomplished so that's the idea of ministry and uh as I said last Sunday that every nation has a purpose it has an agenda and and so each nation has offices or we will call it Ministries where men carry out that purpose the purpose of that Nation and uh our nation you know we have all kinds of Ministries uh we have ambassadors um and who have a specific task we we have the military and within that in the military there are different branches yet the Air Force the Navy the military or the uh uh Marines and uh the the seals and but but they are they are Ministries in in that they are agents to to help um we we have different branches of government such as congressmen Senators Governors mayors and the list goes on and on and on of of how this nation uh is able to do what it does it's it's it's it's because of the branches it's the offices it's the Ministries that are within the nation that carry things out and and so but each each office has a purpose and they're used to accomplish a a purpose and so now what makes it we we see a lot of chaos within the nation and what makes it uh chaotic uh is when you have people filling these positions that refuse to unify around the goal or purpose and um it's it's you know it's it's bad enough when you have uh Republican and Democrat in office you know and um and they're fighting one another you know they they just can't seem to get on the same page uh uh but then it's it's really bad when you have the Republicans fighting Republicans and Democrats fighting Democrats it it brings the chaos to a different level and so uh we see that the party that is Unified most is the strongest it's it's the uh and is able to accomplish more and so uh uh then you you we find that everybody's got their agendas and and so the leaders of each party are trying to unify their party uh to get things accomplished but it just doesn't seem to be able to do it and uh and and the reason why is because it's the Bible has already predicted that it wouldn't it it just won't happen it just can't uh because the nation has got to fall uh and and so it's it's not the outside that's killing our nation it's it's actually within uh the the nation because people just won't unify around a common goal and and you know um but there is a people and I'll put it this way there is a people that are unifying in the government and uh because they got to fulfill scripture I mean it's they are coming together it's it's behind the scenes and and they are determined to get their agenda uh uh out and so uh but but I'm not here to talk about America or the world politics and all these things I am just saying that there are Ministries you you have to have a you have to have Ministries whatever you want to call it governments branches uh whatever uh in in order for the purpose to be fulfilled and and so but as we want to look at it even higher today uh uh that God has a purpose God has a will and it's a Divine will it's an eternal purpose that's what Paul said and and so God um God has uh there has to be a Ministry in order for this will this purpose to be accomplished there there has to be now Colossians 1 16 says for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him ain't that right so then we we find that he is the one that has created these things for his purpose for his will and and for this to be carried out so God has established a Ministry now I I think the idea of ministry comes from God he's the first one and and so uh you you look at it Isaiah 55 10 we know it as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not leather but whatareth the Earth and make it for us and it make us it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish everybody say shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper right in the thing whereto I sent it now when we when when you have uh the nation first was established the men that founded the nation or established it and and uh they they formed a declaration of independence and things but they realized that they they had to have something to to carry these things out they had to have people they had to have agents they had to have branches they had to have offices in order to carry their dream and what they wanted and and these things I think that all come from God man being made in the image of God it it it it it it it it it it come it's it come the original thought came from God now God said my word will be accomplished it will accomplish it it it will prosper in the thing that I sinned to do and I say to you that the word will be accomplished through the ministry by Ministry and so everything that is part of this ministry serves to fulfill God's word do you believe that now uh I know maybe what some of you are quiet for is you're thinking Ministry five-fold Ministry uh I'm going broader than just fifo Ministries so you can relax and take it easy uh uh everything that is a part of this ministry serves to fulfill God's word uh Psalms 34 7 uh uh the angel of the Lord and brother Branham uses the plural the angels of the Lord in campus round about them that fear Him and what delivereth them so we'll start right there for just a brief moment but then because the Angels were created a man before Man was created and and and that they were created for a purpose but they are God's ministers they are part of this ministry do you believe that angels are part of the ministry of God uh they have a Ministry brother Brian said they are with us angels are with us to minister spiritual blessings to us and to help us along the road and encourage us as we see the hill of Zion Yonder inside ain't that right so they they have a Ministry and and they do not work apart from God's will God's purpose but it all comes together to fulfill God's word I'm glad that there's Angels I'm glad that God would put Angels by us a man there they help us when we're discouraged they're there to give us encouragement when we we we we find that even when we are trapped by the enemy or in even in the natural when when the apostles there in the book of Acts was was thrown into prison the Bible says that the angel of the Lord came not a man it was an angel of the Lord that came and opened the prison door and set them free now it was a supernatural happening because the next day well first the angel of the Lord told them after he had set him free there in Acts 5 and 20 go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life so the angel of the lord gave them a command on what to do so the next morning uh uh they they they uh the governor mayor whoever the judge whatever they sent for these men to put him into trial and so when the men came the prison doors were locked the men that were guarding were there the only people that was missing was the ones the angel of the Lord delivered and that was the apostles ain't that right and they found them in the temple preaching the gospel see so God would send his Angel as a minister for to fulfill his will ain't that rhyme brother Branham in one prayer of his ask God to send the angels to stand near the sick so to minister to them the blessings of the Covenant that Jesus Christ made with the sick have you ever just thought of that of of of of of when you're in sickness and there's an encouragement there that that that that comes maybe you were feeling a little low maybe you were feeling a little down and and there's something that strikes your faith and and builds you up and and you just get an energy of yes Lord your word is real I have no doubt that there were angels that are encamped around you that the Lord would send to minister to you see they're ministers and and so don't don't think you're walking this life alone don't think you're fulfilling the Christian walk by yourself there's angels of God that are in kin to all around you and God would create them for his purpose ain't that right amen so we believe in the ministry of the Angels they are there to encourage you they are there to help you they are there to help you believe in in in several instances you'll hear Brother Branham say Lord May the angels of God just stand at their post of Duty stand by every Pew every chair or every person and help them to believe amen why we need the ministers can you say amen and God would have them they are there to inspire you to you Inspire faith in you to give you strength and encouragement and all of these things and and so uh uh but then you know and we we could go on we could talk about the universe and we we talked a little bit about it uh last Sunday but but every every Star is in its place and there's billions and billions of them you can't count them amen and and even if you could count the ones that you see there's stars that you can't even see and there's there's solar systems and and all of that that is that that man hadn't even discovered yet and but yet therefore a purpose do you believe that therefore purpose and the prophet says that if one star it would get out of out of its place it would affect the entire Earth if the moon would get out of its place it would affect the entire Earth everything is for the ministry of God's purpose amen see and so every person and and and now look at it our way uh for a moment at us but every person that is part of the body of Christ is a minister do you believe that you cannot be part of the Menace uh the body of Christ and not be part of of ministry amen uh because you are a man you are in the ministry in whatever role God places you in the body a man First Corinthians 12 and 18 but now hath God set the members of every one of them in the body as it pleased him ain't that right not not as it pleased you but as it hath pleased him because God has a purpose and and for you God's not just called you and saved you and then let you twiddle your thumbs until the Rapture a man but you got a Ministry and if one of the Heavenly hosts get out of place what about the Earthly host how it affects ain't that right and so we we see now when when talking about Ministry Ministry is about serving and and I want to get more into that uh uh later but Ministry is about serving and as I've said Ministry is is I believe it was God's idea and he is the first one to implement uh Ministry tree amen and so I want to look at it as God's Ministry not my Ministry not your ministry not the ministry of the Stars not the ministry of angels but God's Ministry for he's the one that created it all for his purpose ain't that right he saved you because he had a purpose in Saving you he didn't just he didn't just save you brother AJ a man he could have saved everybody else around you but he saved you because he got a purpose in that and and and what we are doing as the prophet said now we come to God asking him what was your purpose in Saving me amen I'm glad you saved me but what's the purpose can you say man amen that's right he didn't save you and then you just go do your own thing and and what you think would be best for God's kingdom but God would save you for his will and his purpose and so every one of us uh uh uh are part of God's Ministry if we're part of the body of Christ now today we have been given the privilege uh to know the desire of God before the foundation of the world and and this is the blessings I believe one of the the great blessings of being able to stand in this age after the seals and and and to know God's mind uh many people have lived through the ages not understanding God's mind even though a revelation would come to them and they may write it down in the scripture but maybe not fully understood but in this age it's not only just revealed but there is a people that is understanding and we're not understanding portion of Prophecy we're understanding all prophecy amen see we're not understanding a man say so uh uh we we've been given this prayer privilege to know he has always existed for he is eternal he was lonely and wanted Fellowship right amen he had attributes within him and wanted to express them speaking of God he wanted uh to become a family he wanted to express who he is and what he is to his family and through his family he loved his family and he wanted to receive love from them he wanted to have relationship with his family can you say amen amen and and and and these things have now been made known to us and opened up up a a a whole new uh way of Christian life amen uh more than just coming to church and and and and and fulfilling a a duty at the church or doing what is required or whatever amen but we're understanding why we're here why amen we come to the house of God what drives us is because God desired something from us he desired Fellowship he desired expression he wanted to express himself not just to you brother shalom but through you a man say he he wanted this and and so we we find that God was Elohim a man before anything else amen even before oxygen was was there and and uh uh there was Elohim God existed he was the self-existent one ain't that right amen and so he was lonely in this self-existence he knew who he was he knew what he was capable of he knew what was in him but he he he uh was lonely because there was nothing there her Amen to Fellowship a man sees so then he became God after created the angels for God is an object of worship ain't that right amen he didn't need man in the say in the sense to make him God Amen he was already worshiped by the creation that he had created cherubims and seraphims and all kinds of Angels were there around the Throne of God Amen constantly continually worshiping him ain't that right amen but it didn't fulfill God's longing a man for Fellowship and then we find God became father not when he created the draft not when he created angels not when he created the monkey amen but when he created Adam and we know what father is it's a parent he became a parent amen because now he created something that was from him for he said let us make man in our own image ain't that right so not one Angel was made like Adam not one animal was made like Adam there was Adam there was nothing in God's creation that was made like Adam hey ain't that right Adam was made in God's Own image which made him God's son a man an offspring of God ain't that right so what makes us long for Fellowship amen with God what makes us one his approval what makes us want to know him more what makes us want to please him is because we are his children you believe that we are his children you realize that God never made uh uh you for the Angels but he made angels for you he never made you to ministered Angels but he made angels to minister to you that's right see so many times we are guilty of of thinking uh that our desire for him is greater than his desire for us amen but but that's not true sometime we we might think that that we want the Holy Ghost more than God wants to give it to us that's not true ain't that right amen said the prophet said he's closer to you than his door and his door is your heart now you think of that where's your heart somewhere dropping here right and yet he's closer to you brother Tim than he is your heart that's right he's so close tonight he's closer to you than your right arm is he's part of you ain't that right and if we could only realize that he's here and how he wants to have fellowship with us his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours is he wants to fellowship with you more than you'll ever want to fellowship with him it wasn't you that bargained with God it wasn't you that came to God and said I want to have some fellowship God he put the desire in you and he began to woo you for Fellowship he longed to have Fellowship can you say man he's the one that promised I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world when you forget about God he doesn't forget when you're in your complaints he's not complaining can you say man amen when you want to turn your back and walk away from it all God will never turn his back very true very true amen what makes a mother dashed through a burning fire not thinking about her own self the prophesied her hair on fire clothes on fire The Edge she'll go there and grab that baby and run out with that baby and do everything she can to protect that baby what makes a man give his own life for his wife not caring about danger anything he's there to protect her protect his children protect his family what is it you know what the prophet said it's a strain in you that comes from God see You're Made In His Image and it's the same strain that he has for you and you say man so when we look at a true genuine father or mother we begin to get and just a partial idea and I'm I'm talking about just a little idea of God's heart toward his children his own children he's Papa God he's father can you say Amen that's right see so the love of a father or mother can never compare with that of the love of God Matthew 7 11 if you then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ain't that right how much more so he's trying to establish himself by the natural parent and the father and mother and and he's wanting you to get just a little bit of of what he feels towards you but he says it's greater than the love of a of a father or a mother ain't that right Isaiah 49 15 God asks can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forgive yet will I not everybody say will I not forget thee he won't forget you now is that his word or not he won't forget you behold behold I have gravened thee on the palm of my hands ain't that right there's there you can't be erased you're engraving in his hands so for for Satan to take you from God Amen went to be take part of God and for Satan to hurt you is to hurt God for Satan to destroy you is to destroy God is wanting to show us that you're not just a an object over there and he's looking after you you're right here not just being held by him but you're engraving in his hands and I have to I just say it it has to be the right hand in his right hand where his power is Behold thy Graven thee upon the palm of my hands thy walls are continually before me come on Ministry Ministry actually started from what I can see so you just have to excuse me but I I believe that Ministry started before the foundation of the world and as I say Ministry is about serving it's it's an agent where where my personal thing an agent is a person or thing by which something is accomplished Ministry God God himself implemented Ministry Before Time and he put every one of his children's names on the Lamb's Book of Life now standing in this age that means so much that God would do that back then and what he was doing was securing you ain't that right he he through Ministry he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life to secure you [Music] but also a lamb was slain before the foundation of the world ain't that right Romans 8 30 tells us that there are a people that God predestinated before the foundation of the world Ministry he also called them Justified them and glorified them ain't that right we see God's Ministry not just in his mind as a pre-thought but we see God's Ministry in his creation God knew that his children would arrive on the Earth amen he didn't make the Earth for himself he made it all for you right so he knew that his children would come to the Earth so he prepared for our arrival and when when we arrived God had already finished it there were the mountains there was the Lakes the rivers there was The Valleys that in the deserts there it all was laying there ain't that right well Brown said they were here first because of the kindness of our heavenly father placed them and he did it because he knew that there would be some that would like the mountains there would be some that would like the rivers there would be some that would like the deserts ain't that right there would be some that would like you know the planes brother Rand said he knew your nature so aren't you glad that God had an infinite mind to know he knew so he wasn't making things just well I think I think I think they'll want this I think they'll like it but he knew your nature and thus he created it by that he knew your nature and what you would be so he made it just the way that you could enjoy it [Music] he prepared everything before we got here and then we find that just before Jesus ascended into heaven there in John 14 and 2 he said in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again ain't that right and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also do you believe it's already prepared it's there it's prepared God in his ministry seeking of you that when you would get there it wouldn't be all chaotic but it would be just according to your liking he's prepared for our our arrival in his creation he made made it in such a way that his children could see him reflected in it you can see God in the grass you can see God in the trees you can see God's majesty and how great he is in the mountains you can see God's faithfulness when you look in the desert and you see out of all that bleakness or something living God faithful to that little flower he's faithful to us you can see God everywhere you can see God in the Stars foreign that we could understand his ways he made Creation in a way that his children could be aware of his presence by beholding his creation amen I think it was brother Brown talking about that man that went went uh he went hunting with and you know or maybe he was hunting with the preacher and he told the preacher I gave my heart to the Lord and he said well what was it was it the sermon I preached was it this was it that he goes no he's standing out here and sing God's creation maybe seeing the setting of The Sun I can't remember what it was that inspired him but see he saw God in nature ain't that right so we we find that God has never done anything without having a purpose for doing it I'm again just wanting to establish that thought of ministry God has never done anything without having a purpose he has never done anything for the purpose of just showing off he has never done anything for vainglory he's never done anything that would destroy his own family everything has been set for his children his own family amen so then we find that the foundation for Ministry is love Divine love and this ministry Ministry exists because of the love of God we see this exemplified uh after God's children sinned they did what God told them not to do and God told them the day you do it it'll be in that day you'll die well they did it not understanding or realizing the real consequence of it and when they sinned it separated them from God ain't that right they failed from that Holy image so now man has a fallen nature that's carnal and enmity against God I want you to think of that no man seeks after God Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him ain't that right no man knoweth the father no man knoweth the son no one knoweth the father but by the son no one knoweth the son except the father first reveals him I have not seen nor Earth heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things that God's prepared see when he fell he fell so separated him that as of today there are people that aren't even conscience of God there may have even been some of God's children that didn't even believe that he existed have you ever thought of that maybe cursed him but God's love toward his children his family has never wavered brother Branham talks about when God talked with Adam and Eve he said Yonder I see Adam and Eve first little sweethearts there in the Garden of Eden I see Adam back there when he put his arms around his little sweetheart to walk out with her for God had condemned them and he started out with his arms around his darling Adam was not deceived he did have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter if he had she had to go to torment he'd go with her when God looked down and seen that love of a human being it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself and he said I will come and go too and said I'll put enmity between her seed and the serpent seed we find four thousand years later or so that God come down manifested in the flesh and went to the very Flames the prophet said the hottest of suffering that he might bring us into fellowship with him taking no thought of his own not my will but fine be done and you say man ever since the false man has been under Satan's control Satan has been able to flick man with the uh uh sickness and disease he has been able to enslave Mankind and used man for his own evil devices he's been able to put that to wedge between God and man ain't that right and that wedge is stronger today than ever mankind has never been the same since the fall but God determined to redeem his children I'm so glad there was Ministry God determined to redeem his children and he came up with the plan the Plan of Redemption right wide to bring healing to both soul and body to bring Deliverance to bring Salvation to bring restoration God would provide a way Escape through his ministry he would provide a way of Escape so that man could be reconciled back to God and they could both be one again can you say Amen see so then if in order to do that a substitute had to be provided yes being a little simple this morning but I want to get it across a substitute had to be provided and this word substitute is to put or use in another play in place of another a person or thing that takes the place of another can you say amen and that was the only way for God to bring restoration that's the only way that God could restore man and bring his desires is that he would provide the substitute ain't that right man could not provide the substitute he was the head of all creation but he failed and when he fell everything under him fell and he could not create for only God can create ain't that right so therefore God in his ministry would provide a substitute amen ain't that right he didn't just do it for the fact of of creating he did it for you and I in the Book of Genesis he showed what kind of substitute he would provide after Adam and Eve realized that they had sinned they had no covering they stood naked and and so Adam the Bible says got his own covering by sowing live fig leaves together thinking that God would not see their nakedness but we find that when the presence of God come in the garden looking to meet with Adam and Eve it becomes so apparent that they could not stand in the presence of God in their own covering so they ran and hid the Bible says God began to search for Adam Adam Where Art Thou he knew that something was wrong because the place where he met them they weren't there I think the atmosphere had changed I I think all creation changed death loomed on everything Genesis 3 and 9 says in the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said but who told thee the thou was naked thou Eaton of the tree whereof I have commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat now you see if you can think of it this way that he didn't need anyone to tell him he was naked his own heart condemned him when he's coming to the presence of God there was something that condemned him he didn't feel that before his eyes was open ain't that right so in God's Eden as the prophet would tell us they were both naked without a stitch of clothes on them and they knew it you know and and they knew it not they they they they're in that garden and there's no clothes and and no covering and they knew it not brother Brandon says why didn't they know it for they were veiled to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy Spirit they could look right at each other and didn't know that they were naked they were veiled with the Holy Spirit of holiness the spirit of Holiness veiled their eyes they were veiled they were saved in God's Pavilion ain't that right so the Holy Spirit was over their eyes and they saw nothing but their brother and sister that's what the prophet said ain't that right I say it to you today it takes God's Veil today it still takes that veil of Holiness to look and not lust can you say Amen and then that's that's the only way that a man will go in this evil rotten adulterous age without lusting is you've got to have the veil of holiness that covers your eyes can you say man it'll make you turn your head ain't that right so I won't say it this way don't despise holiness people have made Holiness all about the outward apparel made it a Doctrine or a form of legalism but Holiness is the spirit of God for God is Holy do you believe that a man living clean on the outside is just part of it amen but there's a lot of people that live clean and have a Holiness standards that ain't wholly inside ain't that right well it's true too many times we work on the outside instead of working on the end God letting God work on the inside if God can work on that inside he'll work on that outside he'll fix that outside can you say man amen see we need the spirit of Holiness in this day so they did not know that they were naked because the Holiness of God kept their eyes veiled God hid their conscience from sin by the holy Veil so you see what God needed to do for you and I he needed to provide a holy Veil there's going to be a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish in this age [Music] do you believe it now the book of Hebrews says the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin do you believe what you understand what we're saying that if you are thoroughly purged I'm not talking about Temptation I'm not talking about these things but there is a veil that covers your eyes to where you'll walk away can you say Amen no more conscience the prophet said sin has passed from him see we're in Satan's Eden are we not and the people are returning back to nakedness I'd say they have [Music] and the prophet said they are veiled by an Unholy Veil the spirit of unholiness uncleanliness and lust has veiled them education science why it's scientific scientific they say wear shorts it's cooler scientific science he said the Indians teach you better than that they wrap up in a blanket to be air-conditioned and and and put on them see and and so education has absolutely come back to a Time the very thing that they seek has brought them to culture and civilization has put them back in ignorance again worse than they was in the first place is that right look at the age that we're in notice What God Says to the laodicean age there in Revelations 3 17 because thou says I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and no it's not everybody say no it's not you can go look listen to the message and and what is that Noah know it not that not no it's not that thou art wretched and miserable poor blind and naked ain't that right what is it it's the veil of unholiness over their eyes that's right see and and so then you look here's second Corinthians 4 and 4 in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them ain't that right so it's it's a blindness it's it's this unholiness the veil of unholiness is a blindness to where the people can't see the light of the Glorious gospel First Timothy 4 and 2 says have they have their conscience seared with the hot iron that brother Bradham said their heart has become seared amen now something about Adam is that when he did Sin there was something in them to convict him there was something in him to recognize that hold it this ain't right I ain't the way I used to be things ain't the way they used to be see he tried to go into the presence of God with his own ideas his own covering his own his own thoughts his own works his own this and it didn't work he had to run so he wasn't like the people of today that have their hearts seared they're blinded by this veil of unholiness the heart doesn't condemn them so when Adam and Eve sin their heart condemned them they ran and hid from the presence of God ain't that right people will broadly walk into the presence of God and it doesn't face them in this age but now after the fall watch the ministry of God go to work God provided a substitute for them ain't that right Genesis 3 8 unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them who did it God so loved his children that he would provide a way for them to come into His presence again hello it's true and I say to you that God in his ministry is still clothing his people if you'll notice God used a specific thing to clothe them you something that Adam and his carnal Fallen condition didn't think of using God took a lamb and slew it that right something that the world may not think about is the blood of that animal was shed by God killing it and taking the skin off see it it took something it it it it it took something with blood you with me I know this is simple but it took something with blood God's ministry will always have blood as long as his children is here on this Earth his ministry will have blood and you say Amen for it's the only way that man can be reconciled back to God there's power in the blood there's healing in the blood there's Deliverance in the blood you believe it forgiveness in the blood reconciliation is in the blood the ministry of God has never been without blood So Adam tried to cover himself with something that had no blood but it didn't work it was a self-made religion it was a Ministry that God was not a part of right it had no power in it unless the prophet tells us Adams Adam's work what Adam did represents all religions of the world today self-made self-serving carnal-inspired carnal mind today the religions relied denominations rely on their Creeds and dogmas they light rely on their own inspiration they rely on their forms of worship they have a form of godliness but denied the very power of the earth brother Graham said fundamental in Doctrine but powerless in power Creed's dogmas forms of worship are powerless theology is powerless brother Brian said we have built great hospitals and schools in great places and seminaries and educated our preachers to make them so they can speak with fine very fine swelled words and use the psychology and stand stiff and say Amen just as plight as it can be and all of that and what has it got us a big bunch of backslidden people nothing but a bunch of cold formal in different churches as cold as zero weather spiritually speaking that's not the ministry of God brother Brown said I challenge any man to show me any organization on fire for God filled with the Holy Ghost with signs following them rise and tell me one any organization there's no such a thing it's not on the pages that's right they're all powerless and dead get it see he says but he also prophesied there would be a real Church in that day a little flock a Remnant he said there would be and there will be there will be a people who know their God said the prophet and will do great exploits in the last days so notice the difference in Ministry God's Ministry has power in it man's Ministry has no power in it can you say Amen brother bran said God hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless and what is Christ he's our lamb he's where the blood flows from you believe that amen see it ain't got Christ in it but any religion that's that Christ is in under his own blood it's got power in it thinking of Ministries in the blood the Bible tells us that when Moses built the Tabernacle and he was putting all the instruments for Ministry in the Tabernacle that he sprinkled both Tabernacle and the vessels and and the Bible calls it vessels of ministry with blood every vessel that would be used in the ministry had to have blood the temple the Tabernacle had to have blood because it would be God's Ministry and you say man Hebrews 9 21 moreover he sprinkled the blood with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission ain't that right so everything that was to be used we see God in his ministry going to provide something now to bring reconciliation to him God in his ministry I want to provide something that would break the Fetters of the devil over his children and he starts with blood we read in Genesis where the two brothers Cain and Abel made an offering to the Lord Abel killed a lamb and offered it to God and God respected it why blood was shed came he took of what he had grown his own works oh it was alive but there wasn't no blood in it and he offered it to God and God refused it wrong Ministry ain't that right and how did Abel know to offer a bloody sacrifice well Hebrews 11 4 says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain you see there's a Ministry but then there's a more excellent Ministry there's an offering but then there's a more excellent offering there's a way but then there's a more excellent way ain't that right so by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than it came by which he obtained that he was righteous well what is faith faith is a revelation that comes from God ain't that right gang didn't do it by faith because he had no revelation well he was inspired but it was a carnal inspiration man ain't that right but Abel was in the line of God for he had received the revelation a Ministry so by Revelation Abel offered a bloody lamb and it was more excellent than Cain's sacrifice Abel's sacrifice was a mess it was bloody ain't that right but it was more excellent and I want to tell you today it doesn't take a ministry that's polished up we don't need Paul stunt Ministries I think God's Ministry is a mess there's blood in it it's a mess people want to be so dignified when they give their heart to the Lord it's a mess it's it's it's a mess slobbering crying it's not slinging it's a mess brother Brown was against these dry-eyed confessions no convictions ain't that right yes sir and this is what more and more we get is is is is dried out confessions but God's Ministry is a mess it's got blood it's not here to be polished up it's not here God doesn't need a big fine fancy building to preach in he doesn't require some polished up family to have a Ministry in that family and you say man it just takes a Ministry with blood in it amen it might be a mess but that's the thing God will vindicate you believe it so therefore right after Adam first sinned God had a way of redemption for him right quick the prophet said and see before Adam could ever approach back to fellowship with the father God had to slay an innocent lamb he says the very first sin was committed uh uh God would rock her off her place because he's holy talk about the world and his words are right before he could even talk to Adam and Eve he had to make a sin offering there with a lamb ain't that right I'm I'm I hope this is all right God's Ministry knows the way of approach God's Ministry knows the right way of approach so much Ministry today that is savior of God but they don't know the right way of approach they don't know how to bring the people into an approach and the approach that God has provided for us today the world rejects it they've got their own approach to God that God in his ministry provided an approach that man could come and talk with him amen God doesn't talk to people just because they got to find choirs in the professional music and you say man brother Brown said see he wrapped that bloody skin around Adam and throughout the welcome carpet for him to walk back on the carpet of redemption he said God's God always had a Plan of Redemption and that's been through the blood ever since the very beginning and Dawn Of Time perceived in the mind of God before the world ever come into existence another place he said when Jesus died he cleansed all the world of sin by his blood so the ministry has blood can you say amen he said that's the reason they can have Rock and rolls and all kinds of vulgar in the world tonight and God doesn't take their life or skip the world of all is because that blood is a laying on The Mercy Seat but one of these days that blood's coming off The Mercy Seat then it's judgment he said I don't know it may be off before that clock hits and it gets 9 30. I don't know but she'll be dark then and there'll be nothing but judgment you've passed your own judgment with the attitude you've taken toward his son and the atonement that's right that's good Prophet goes on to talking about it and I'll get red clothes but when Adam and Eve started walking out of the garden there was a cloud over them sin hung over their brow s of Darkness hung all around them after they had received word of the Eternal destination they walked out of the garden with those bloody sheepskins around them here they were having the cloud of Darkness here they were feeling so wretched and miserable any any true Christian when they sinned there's just something there that they feel that's just something not right it's just something wrong you can imagine that weighed upon them as a walking out but then the prophet said as they're walking with that cloud of Darkness over them they had a ray of Hope that there was coming a redeemer God wouldn't finish his ministry yet but he would tell them okay I'm going to send you out now the prophet would tell us and he describes it he says I can see Adam and Eve walking through the garden with her head hanging down he's got his arms around her and are sobbing as they're walking in the the bloody sheepskin is flapping on their thighs blood running down their legs as they walk in house sobbing and God as they're going this way God's going that way and he's walking and he says all of a sudden God turns around and says stop wait wait he said I know you got to go he said I want you to know I'm going to provide a redeemer for you I'll provide something for you and he said what stop God l o v e can you say Amen see God's everlasting love God's eternal love that could not stop because of their fallen condition it provided a Ministry for them can you say amen and in that Ministry would come a redeemer in through that Ministry would come salvation through that Ministry was a ray of Hope For The Sinner can you say amen and I tell you tonight there's a Ministry on the earth that is still providing a ray of Hope for every backslider for every person that is in their Valley for every lost son and daughter husband and wife there is a Ministry that is provided for blood can you say Amen the prophet said to the preaching of the Gospel provides a blood Veil do you believe it God provided a redeemer it would take the ministry of God to provide such a thing you love him let's just sing this song as the musicians come Oh How He Loves You and Me me oh how he loves you and me he gave his life what more could he give oh how he loves you oh how he loves me oh how he loves you and me can we go down the key sing it now oh how he loves [Music] yes he does yes he does oh how he loves homes you and me he gave life one more could he give Oh How He loves you aren't you thankful for his love [Music] please sing it once again yes oh how he loves you you and me [Music] Oh How He Loves You and Me [Music] for he gave his life what more could he give you've oh how he loves you oh yeah yes Oh How He Loves You and me I shall forever I shall foreign mine nice to Calvary two of you the cross where Jesus Jesus died for me how marvelous the grace that caught my falling sword he looked beyond my fault and saw my need can we sing that verse [Music] Amazing Grace shall always be my song of praise it was great [Applause] I do not know just why he came to love me so but he looked beyond yes he did [Music] and saw my knees sing it now I shall forever lived my knives glory to God glory to God two of you the cross us where Jesus died for me how marvelous the grace that bond for caught my falling soul eat Beyond my sing that again he looked beyond aren't you glad he looked beyond oh he looked beyond [Music] my faults and Saul my knees Grace Grace God 's Grace [Music] that still Pardons and clears Within [Music] Grace Grace Grace God's Amazing Grace [Music] that is greater than all our sin as they just play softly aren't you glad for the grace of God what
