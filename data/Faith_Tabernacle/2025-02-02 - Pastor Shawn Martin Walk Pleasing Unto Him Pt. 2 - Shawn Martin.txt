Loretta with us amen and the uh the children and uh brother Josh will be ministering for us Wednesday evening he's or W yeah Wednesday evening and he's um down in North Carolina I believe today or South Carolina one of the two and uh so uh uh but we're we're glad to have uh the family amen and uh it's been said good to see brother Bob out of the hospital and doing good and uh we certainly thank the Lord for that amen and uh uh just everyone uh in the house of the Lord I know the sickness has been going around but um um we're we're definitely conquerors uh even over sickness amen and um um uh we had a just a wonderful time of worship Wednesday night tonight and uh after you know the service and just the presence of the Lord came in a special way and I I thank the Lord for that I after we dismiss several stayed probably 45 minutes after the service just worshiping the Lord and just a good spirit uh there and and I just want to say I I appreciate you just taken the time to Worship the Lord um it um you know I worship is a is is such an important part of service and um uh you know the the song leader don't have everything you know um I don't think he should be able to or have to get us primed up I understand that we have you know sometimes we have services that are you know just everybody tired or whatever but I think it's important to press past that tiredness or whatever we got going on and just to Worship the Lord and you know the the lamb has opened the book and um you know brother Bram called the the the worship the king lamb worship and he said it's time for that that's King Glam worship time and U and we are victorious and that's Why We Worship the Lord is because we we know that it's already done we know that we're Victory Victors we know that Satan is defeated and uh whatever he's trying to put on your life that he's just a bluff and so we don't have to worry about him anymore we just just Worship the Lord and brother brand I'm talking about a man that could live so close to the Lord that the devil don't know what to do with him I think that's what it is is just he can't Bluff us anymore he just to a point that we we've understanding who we are that every angle that he tries to put on us um we we just don't listen to him anymore and he just lost his power over us uh in the sense that he can't Bluff us amen and so we must never let the the spirit of worship die in the church never let the Revival fire die we always want to stay in the life can you say Amen uh we want to if you would like to turn with me the first of all the book of Colossians the first chapter and um we want to as it's been said to keep brother Bill Y and uh the family in prayer as they've sister Shirley has passed away and I believe the the memorials Service uh and the viewing will be tomorrow evening and I don't have the time with me so the viewing starts at 5: and the service starts at 7 okay and it'll be at uh at the the church there the lighthouse I think is it Lighthouse yeah and so uh uh we we want to uh keep them in prayer I understand that brother bill will be taking the service and uh ministering and so I know uh he'll need our prayer and may the Lord just give him the strength also uh our tent meeting is coming up uh uh you know here soon and uh brother Tim had talked to uh uh Diane there at the the the camp and uh she um it it was was that uh uh she had had mentioned to Daniel that we would uh only be allowed to set up uh around the 20th which would have given us only a week and so uh but she told brother Tim that we could set it up on April 14th which will be on a Monday um at this time we can't they don't want to setting it up any earlier uh because of a camp or or someone is coming supposedly coming in at that time um uh for the weekend and so she doesn't want to setting it up before uh that time or during that time and so uh uh it looks like we will be able to set the T up on April 14th uh on a Monday so if any of you brothers would like to help and can get off work uh at at that time that would be great if anything changes we will let you know um uh hopefully uh by the end of February she said she would know if if if that group is going to take the camp uh at that time usually we're the first ones uh that open the camp up uh and so uh this time I guess they open she open opened it up for another group ahead of us and U so anyways uh hopefully that ain't too confusing so April 14th Monday uh we'll be setting the tin up uh unless something changes and we're able to get it earlier than that so uh just keep that in your mind uh Colossians um one and um nine we'll start there for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you be filled with the knowledge of his will notice that be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being FR fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God then if you'll turn with me first Thessalonians um 4 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and I do want to say I appreciate the brother's praying the church praying Wednesday night uh for my cough it's definitely easy up um and U doing so much better so I thank the Lord for that and um that having a cough is no fun especially when you're trying to preach but um so 1 Thessalonians 4 and we're going to start at the first verse furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and ex exort you by the Lord Jesus that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification ation and honor amen could we just uh bow our heads and talk to our father precious Lord it is truly an honor for us to gather together among Believers of like Precious Faith whom you have redeemed you've set aside and called for your purpose father and just to come and meet with you Lord we pray that our worship was found pleasing to you father and that you would feel at home we ask now that you would speak father through these mortal lips that you would just speak your words of Life To Us Lord and Lord let that word be creative within us and Lord we would say as Mary did be it unto me according to Thy word father have free reign today Lord you know every need you know where every individual is in their walk with you I pray father that great grace would come upon us today father that we could be more like you and reflect you in a greater way father and that we could just abide in your presence presence father we just ask that you know our hearts this morning Father give me that Liberty and help me just to be able to express my heart today we ask it in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you can be seated today I um the title I want to use again as I did Wednesday night walk pleasing unto him and U I truly believe that we're living in a time of the manifestation of the sons of God and um we know it to be the time of adoption and uh just maybe for a a little background of uh the way brother Bram taught us and that about the adoption [Music] uh in the Old Testament when a a a a boy was born into a wealthy family uh maybe the the boy's father owned a a kingdom lots of acerage and he had uh servants and and and uh things on his his farm or or ranch or whatever and so that that boy was born into to the kingdom and he was a son but he was just a son a son without Authority a son without privilege a son that had not an inheritance as of yet or come into His inheritance and basically he was just as a servant he was told what to do how to do it and commanded and and so uh he he wasn't free to tell somebody else what to do but he was told to do this he was told to do that and he had to he had to be taught he had to listen he had to know what Authority was and the Apostle Paul explains it in in Galatians 4 And1 he says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under two and governors until the time appointed of the father so then the son wasn't left on his own uh just growing up you know left unattended left without instruction because he would grow up to be a brat he would grow up to be sport you know and uh and so uh you know the father then he would bring in a tutor uh and he had to trust that tutor he had to know that tutor it may have been a a best friend of his or whatever but uh he was he was busy taking care of the farm and and making sure everything was going good and so he didn't have time to to uh raise his son in in in in the way that the son needed raising and so he he brought in a a tutor and and so uh uh you know brother BR says you know the father he didn't know if his boy would turn out to be a gangster or be slothful in running the business so then he couldn't just let the boy grow up and then turn the kingdom over to the boy you know at a at a certain age maybe 21 or uh or whatever but without first training the the boy and then testing him the boy had to be trained and tested and so he would he would he uh had to trust the tutor to train the boy in the right way the the father knew how to run the business he knew what he was wanting he did not want that business to fail he didn't want it to be sold uh and and you remember the prodal son uh he showed himself to be a slothful uh he wanted his inheritance and he just squandered it well that's not what the father wanted uh uh and so he would get the best tutor and and and then Not only would the tutor have to to train the boy right but he also had to be honest uh he had to bring report to the father on how the boy was doing and whether it displeased the father whether it made the father happy or whatever he had to be honest uh about the the the child's uh uh progress so the the tutor he was an instructor a a a teacher and so you know the prophet would tell us that you know maybe the the tutor come to the the father and and he would tell and say well the boy's not he's just not going to be very good with business you know I you know I i' I've tried to teach him I've tried to help him and he he just won't listen he just he's stubborn he's he's got his own way about things and I I just don't know you know and and uh he's going to be this or that and the prophet says then the Father the father realizes right then that that boy cannot take over his domain that's right because what would he do he had run he had run it through he says see The Return of the prodical son gives the very a very beautiful picture of it he couldn't see what would he do uh uh would be to mortgage the farm or sell it off and drink it up and and run around see so then that son continues to be a son but without reward he continues to be a son but without inheritance because that son doesn't inherit anything uh there but if the boy proved to be of good character and and the the the tutor would tell the father oh you'd be proud of him I you know uh now this is and and you can go look it up the prophet preaches hear ye him and several time I think 12 times he preaches that subject and plus adoption series and on and on but you know uh uh maybe he would tell the father you know I you know what Sunday morning come along and I costed him to have a flat tire I caus that tire to be flat and you know what he uh he went and and instead of just giving up he went to the neighbor's house to see if he could get a ride to church or he called somebody to see if you get a ride he said that that that boy just I mean he was just I I just I tried to mess his day up and and he he was just persevering he said now that that boy is is going to be good you know and and so he he would uh uh brother Brandon would explain it in different ways of of how this this son would be uh but but the son would be proven to be of good character and was found to be faithful about the father's business uh you know maybe the friends wanted him to go out and and uh you know drink a little bit but uh no no I can't do that i' I'm uh I've got to stay with this you know and and uh uh so then the father would adopt him into the kingdom ain't that right now brother Ram said his conduct determined his inheritance how he conducted himself determined whether he come into that inheritance now when the boy was adopted that he wasn't just a son anymore but the prophet said he was Heir coair with the father of every possession he had he was no longer under a tutor but now he was like his father his father give him certain things to do he might have told him now you take care of this field over here or you do this over here and you take care of the slaves you take care of whatever it is see he was in full possession he for he was adopted into that family and his name on his check was just as good as his daddies can you say Amen so so we we find that that there Paul would talk about it in Ephesians 1 and5 it tells us that God predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will can you say amen I thank God that that we we just didn't come through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he predestinated us to come into our inheritance uh adoption but now brother Bram tells us through through these stories of of the Old Testament just that we don't come into adoption just because uh but we come into adoption because our conduct well there's a good character about us now now I I'll be honest now there's a I know there's been a lot of trials that hits us uh there's a lot of things that come upon us and sometimes it it just seems hot and it seems heavy and it seems like we just ain't going to make it but I I tell you God's testing the character he's wanting character can you say Amen now our tutor is the Holy Ghost um which is the spirit of Truth John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come and in other words the spirit of the word amen not just any Spirit but the spirit of Truth the spirit of the word when he comes he will guide you into all truth how many believes that when he comes he's going to teach you he's going to instruct you in Old truth not partial truth not leave you wondering about a little thing no this is honest this tutor's honest he knows what the father wants and so he is going to guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you then in John 14:26 Jesus said he shall teach you all things not some things all things can you say amen and I tell you teach in his teaching sometimes is unbearable in a lot of ways his teaching sometimes hurts his teaching sometimes leaves us bewildered at times amen see and sometimes it leaves us questioning what's really going on here see because a lot of times teaching is not just coming behind the pulpit and you sitting in a Pew and you're learning that way that's good God wants us to do that but a lot of times it's a School of Hard Knocks and and so he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so this would tell us that we have no other teacher outside the Holy Spirit the spirit of the word which tells us that our headship is the word of God Amen no other teacher no other instructor amen but our headship is the word and then it tells us also that we must have the right character amen uh uh and that's what God is looking for last Wednesday I I spoke on about elaser looking uh uh for a bride trying to find a bride for Isaac and and his master El uh Abraham sent him out to among his own Kindred to find a bride for Isaac the prophet says and when he got there elaser waited until he found character he he he he he wasn't looking for beauty he wasn't looking for talent in and per se you understand what I'm saying he wasn't looking for a gifted person if if we could look at speak of it in our terms he wasn't you know uh uh speaking looking for a well-qualified preacher one that could uh uh uh just Astound the crowd and he wasn't he wasn't looking for the he was looking for character and he would wait he knew what he was looking for he he was wanting to see and so the prophet said God is looking for character amen we can run around the building but God wants character we can we can prophesy we can speak in tongues we can preach so beautiful sing so beautiful play so beautiful in instruments and and all of these things but God is looking for character that's why the preacher goes through trials that's why the deacons go through trials that's why mothers and fathers and children and musicians and and every one of us is not exempt from the trials and the the testings of life because God is looking for character can you say amen that's right he's not flirting he's not looking for boyfriend girlfriend type thing he's not just looking to go dating he wants a wife ain't that right and and so therefore the car comes from the word of God Amen now if if you think of it there has been no Ministry no Ministry who's who's fell in line with the responsibility uh that elaser had outside of brother brandom's Ministry now now think of that elaser was a type he was a type Rebecca was a type and Isaac a type and and and all of these things a type and there's been no Min Ministry fulfill that type A as as brother branham's Ministry it was and brother brandham wouldn't even known of that except the angel of the Lord told him that his ministry fell in line with elaser it was that of elaser go get that bride remember brother Brandon wondering what he had done if if I've done anything wrong do I need to repent of it do I make it right what what what what's going on is there something else that that I'm coming to or or what what is it and he opened that he closed his eyes opened his Bible and his fingers fell L are going after uh uh uh uh a bride for Isaac and he said that's right with my message go get that bride see so therefore if if brother brandham fits that type then there must be a Rebecca on the earth to meet the word to meet the message to fulfill the type of her and and if you notice elaser found her in the evening time not in the morning not midday but in the evening time and the message of the hour is the evening time message it's not a morning message it's not a midday message it's the evening message and brother Bram would tell us the word the evening message must carry evening results do you believe that it's not to get us all Getty and and and all puffed up it's not to get us amen into a Pentecostal Revival or a Lutheran Revival or a wesleyian Revival it's to get us into a place where character comes forth our character comes forth can you say amen that's right see there wasn't much charact and and I'm just going to preach now there wasn't much character down Through the Ages amen uh uh uh God's bride fa amen Adam's bride fell and Jehovah's bride fell can you say amen and look at the church they amen God brings them out they go right back in God brings them out they go right back in this bride will not go back into denominations she she will not go back in the world there's a character about her that's right and this message is producing or bringing forth that character so he says now the evening message must seow evening seed not morning seed evening seed is that right midday scene see it it seeds back there uh was denomination it died and perish but evening time message will show evening time light will show evening time results see the evening time message can you say Amen now the beginning message if we'd want to say it that way the morning message the beginning message showed the morning results or beginning results and that was cre creation Genesis 1:1 ain't that right in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and and and and he created this and he created the trees and he created the birds and he created this and and created man and it was a creation that was the morning message that was the begning message and then brother Brandon would tell us that in Jesus time was the midday message amen that that showed midday results God made his son in his own image in the midday amen that's what Jesus was he was a creation amen the only begotten son of the father can you say amen amen see and and the son was created by the midday message and he says now in the evening time see in the evening time what's he doing he makes his bride in the evening time a bride is produced by the same word can you say Amen the word in the beginning brought forth the world the word in midday brought forth the created son the word in the evening time brings forth a bride can you say Amen so how did God create the Earth in the beginning by speaking it into existence by his word spoke it into existence amen who was his son the word do you believe that in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and that same word was made flesh the word brought forth the sun now how is he making his bride by the same word do you believe it not by a Creed not by a theologian not by psychology amen see but God promised that the word would come back God promised that the word would come back and be made flesh again do you believe that amen the revealing of the son of man amen the word would come back amen but it would come back in Bride form it would come back in Bride form and the evening time message will produce it and I say has produced it amen the Lord now after elaser found the character brother bradam says the next thing was getting her ready to go he found the character next thing was get her ready to go to meet the bridegroom notice that's the same now brother it's the same now the E the end time message is not out yonder in Babylon it's not for Babylon it's not for everybody the evening time message of elaser was not for Rebecca's family it wasn't for the whole tribe it was for Rebecca amen can you say Amen so you understand why there's a lot of folks don't even know about the message of the hour others don't even care to listen about the message of the hour you tell them God sent a prophet and they look at you as an a cult you're crazy but they'll accept anything else that comes along they will accept every politician that's that and they'll swallow every promise that they make and all oh a golden age oh yeah it's a golden age amen who says it's going to be a golden age Prophet said it's not Bible doesn't predict them things but when a prophet comes and you try to show them by the word of God that Malachi 4 promised a profit in this age oh that's just cra crazy why it's not for that crowd it's for a Rebecca can you say Amen now notice it it takes a prophet to find the character that God's looking for see the word was lost how many believes that the word was lost by Creeds and dogmas and Catholicism and and and that carnal Church uh uh uh uh that false Vine false church that inter intertwined and nearly killed out the true church and and and they they come up with so much doctrines and so much this that the word was lost and it took a profit to bring it back it started good on the day of Pentecost amen that that seed was there and and It produced uh uh it showed what the real seed was that was an original Pentecost there wasn't nothing fake about that amen there was no impersonation about that Peter took it to the scriptures says this is that which the prophet Joel spoke of showing it was a word seed but look at all these other religions there's nothing found in the word about it that is true amen amen see and and so therefore the word was lost everybody accepting this and that and and impersonations and false false Impressions and and all of these things it took a prophet to bring the word back and to bring that word back to manifestation again see God God isn't after another church you know uh being established in town he's you know he's he isn't after another Revival happening worldwide he isn't after something new to come and excit fight the church and stimulate the church come on Church he's looking for character that can just be stimulated with what he's revealed he's wanting a word bride that's right and it couldn't happen until this time amen that's right can you say Amen the sons of God could not be manifested in any other age than this age that's right the word could not become flesh in any other age but this age there's been no other time outside Jesus time between jesus' time and now that the son of man has been revealed son of man was not revealed on the day of Pentecost brother Brandon plainly teaches that it was the son of God dispensation amen that's right can you say Amen so there has never been a bride with the same character that Jesus had to Simply do the will of the father that's right now Rebecca's family didn't want her to go and and now they got the gifts just as Rebecca got gifts but there was nothing to excite them about meeting Isaac and they didn't want her to go yeah but they they did say this let the damel speak for herself and Rebecca spoke I will go there was that character I I I'll go can you say Amen now brother random says this he said see uh when elaser found the character that was in the woman Rebecca the beautiful bride of Isaac he told her about Isaac is that not what our messenger has done in this day they want to say you know get people to Christ before the message it shows as Brother Sam would say their ignorance they're showing their ignorance get the get get get the people to Christ before the message see our eler in this day that's what he's doing is telling us all about him about Christ so he says he told her about Isaac and she never questioned one thing never questioned one thing never said well that's just your opinion or that was inspired and that wasn't just never question where she understood everything or not she just never questioned she never questioned one thing she believed the word of the messenger and she made ready to go and they went asked the father and he said just ask her the damils of age ask her let her decision be she said I will go brother Braham says to what what is she going to go to a man she had never seen know nothing about but yet she was ready because she was predestinated and foreordained to that can you say Amen made herself ready now when you think of the these then then we look at Ephesians 4:17 I've got a few scriptures that I want to read to you but it says this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind now notice the scriptures mean something to that Rebecca true don't walk henceforth walk as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feelings have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but you have not so learned Christ if so be that you have heard of him and have been taught by him as the truth in Jes is in Jesus that you put off everybody say put off put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts you you cannot serve God now these scriptures are applicable to us in this age he's found a character that that that says I I'll go whatever it takes and and and others have said I ain't I ain't got to do that I ain't that ain't me I'm God knows who what I am we believe in grace and they make Grace disgrace but here Paul is speak that you put off concerning that the formal conver conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore put away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members of one another can you say Amen uh Philippians 1:27 let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your Affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the Gospel now these scriptures use that word conversation and I looked up that word and from the Strong's Concordance it is behavior let your behavior be as it becometh the gospel can you say Amen there there's a life there there's a way of life there's a there's there's a way of living that a Christian lives that that the world does not live that CH uh uh most Christian don't live this is to the bride of Christ this is to Rebecca put off that old Behavior that's right 1 Timothy 4:12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in word yes don't just be rattling off things hello I you know it it gripes me I guess you have to forgive me but it just gripes me when when you got Elders or supposed to be Elders or whatever that is talking about sports to our young people and talking about the you know the scores that this football team and they're just all excited about it never talking about the Lord to them never encouraging about the things of God but they got they know everything about football they know everything about their team they know everything about sports and and and we can what we can go in movies television we can go about sitcoms and and and whatever you want to say but there has to be somebody that that that that looks at these things be thou an example of the believer in word conversation or behavior in charity in spirit in faith in Purity amen that's good can you say Amen so so what is this that he's looking for a life of conduct this is dealing with a Christian's conduct Behavior lifestyle that we should be an example well I go to church that ought to be a good enough example well that's that's part of it but you defeat your own purpose going to church and living a hypocrite you understand what I'm saying and and if people cannot see us out on the outside if our families can't look at us and say now that's a genuine Christian right there they can't our children can't look at Daddy and and say now that's a real Christian dad Daddy's a Christian Mama's a Christian when we look at one another in in in the church and we could say now there's Christians right there there's something about them they've got a glow about them every every time I'm around them their their atmosphere is is so radiant of the of the presence of the Lord it it just makes people want to be around you and and and and because there there's Purity coming out of your mouth there's Purity coming from your behavior there there there's character that is there can you say Amen it's be thou an example of the Believers you know and and I'm not saying that we all don't go through testings and trials I I ain't saying that at all but God got to mold us amen amen now James 3:11 do the fountain send forth at the same place you know sweet water and bitter can the can the Fig Tree my brethren Bear all of berries either a Vine figs so can no Fountain yield both yield salt waterer and fresh can you say Amen word you you understand what I'm saying saying you you you you can't you can't produce love and bitterness at the same time you you can't produce peace and and distraught at the same time you you can't produce you know worldly things and godly things at the same time you you can't do that see so he says in the 13th verse who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation or good behavior his works with me weakness of wisdom that's right can you say Amen 1 Peter 1:13 wherefore gir up the loens of your mind be sober you understand that see the world ain't they ain't giring up the Lo of their mind they're letting just thoughts just run rapid and they're allowing these thoughts to control them I feel saved one day so I I'm I'm I'm woo praise God don't feel saved the day and and it could go just any way we we allow we feed off the world and we tried to well you know I'm finding out the more you feed off the world the less you feed off of God I find out the more that you get involved in in in the things of the world whether it be on the phone of YouTube and and whatever else and and you're feeding off of those things feeding off of that even in into news and all that then you start letting off that prayer life you start letting off that that Bible reading you start letting off amen listening to the tapes and you start letting your mind wander amen and the things start dictate you've got to G up the loens of your mind Rebecca can you say Amen got to G that up bride see wherefore gir up the loens of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as everybody say as obedient children as obedient children not fashioning yourself according to the former lusts in your ignorance see you're now becoming to know the will of God and when we you know there's things that before we come into the message we allowed there's things that even when we come into the message we allowed but as we begin to grow in God and the knowledge of God's will becomes a revelation to us we start putting those things away that we may put on the new man can you say Amen this is exactly when he finds character then he's going to get her ready that's right can you say man so as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all matter of behavior or lifestyle conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy can you say Amen I'm going to read another one first Peter and then we we'll try Tove move on a little bit but 1 Peter 3:1 this is a little lengthy but it says likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they they also May without the word be won by the conversation or behavior of the wives while they behold your Chase conversation Behavior lifestyle coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward dorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold and putting on of apparel now people get stopped on that and they you know then they want to put on legal things uh you know to where you can't wear a necklace you can't wear this you can't do that can't put your hair up in braids and and all that and we know what a prophet taught so what Paul is trying to tell us is don't don't just look at the beauty on the outside don't f focus on that because that's not what's going to win win that's not going to win people that's not going to win your spouse or whatever what it is is that beauty on the inside a character can you say Amen see they're going to be hold your Chase conversation your lifestyle your behavior Can you say Amen Let It Be fourth verse but let it it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of Meek of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price we're focusing too much on our outside appearance brother brand says that it's all right if you ladies want to be pretty he said that's fine but don't get it carried away now don't start looking like them Jezebels don't start looking like the world out there you worry about that beauty in the heart can you say amen that's right and US husband we shouldn't be wanting beauty queens out like that out in the world we shouldn't put pressure on our wives to feel like they have to compete with that out there you understand what I'm saying you got a wife that is serving God and treating your children right you ought to respect that woman with all your heart and if you don't God's going to judge you for that and that's the truth they ain't your they you know our wives ain't our door matat that we wipe our feet onen right being subjection now he says then that's of of great price ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subject unto their own husbands now we all know good and well that that that's going out the door too can you say Amen it's women's rights it's telling woman the wife telling the husband what to do right right and we're finding out there ain't much Beauty inside they might all be Beauty out here and stuck out everywhere but they're more of a well brother Brown would call him a witch he called him you know he called a lot of things but he said a no good woman is water and a man's blood he said you get a man that get a good woman it's the best thing outside of salvation he could get can you say amen I think God gave me the best thing outside of Salvation when he gave me my wife ain't that right but he said a new a No Good Woman it'll kill a guy he's water in the blood water get water in your blood going to kill you can you say Amen so being subjection unto their own husbands even as Sarah obeyed Abraham am calling him Lord that's right whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel hello don't try to make your husbands the weaker vessel God says you ladies are the weaker vessel and husbands are to treat their wives as being such and not to belittle them and not to tear them down can you say amen that's right see but uh as so he says giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered finally now notice be ye all of One mind are you with me notice having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing other words I'm going to get back at them someday right see not not that but contrarywise blessing knowing that you are there unto called that you should inherit a blessing hello give a blessing whether they deserve it or not for he that will love life and see good day uh days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him assure evil shun evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it can you say amen that's so so we see that a a prophet had to come the word always comes to a prophet Amos 3:7 surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophet and then then we were taught that a prophet must be Vindicated that that Prophet has to be Vindicated by God and it has to be scriptural Vindication can you say Amen now notice brother Brandon would tell us how it pleases God to find his children obedient to his word not on little isms but obedient to the word amen not obedient to the church but obedient to the word see not obedient to what they feel and what they want to do and what they want to say and how they want to handle things but obedient to the word see that is the thing that's going to stand this is the blueprint this is the standard this is the only thing and whosoever shall take away or add to the same will be taken his part from The Book of Life I don't want anything less than this Bible has puts in here and I don't want anything more than what it says can you say amen amen so so you see there is a a a uh a conduct now first John 2 and one we'll read down to the sixth verse but it says my little children these things I write unto you that you sin not everybody say sin not that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments hereby we know that we know him if we keep his Commandments amen he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar right and the truth is not in him but whosoever keepeth his word in him barely is the love of God perfected hereby know we that we are in him he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also also so to walk even as he walked can you say Amen so you see where we're at is we're at the revealing of the son of man and it wasn't just applying to brother brandham it was applying to a Rebecca a bride that we would come up up into a place that that no other age has come to and and Jesus Christ himself can be manifested we we say well yeah we're going to speak mountains and we're going to speak things into existence let's get the character walk as he walked the character that he had was to do the will of the father ain't that right so so then we find that God wants us to keep his Commandments his word which is his word notice 2 Corinthians 10:5 now this is the battle this is the struggles this is this are the things that we are being proven on through the testings notice what we are to do 2 Corinthians 10:5 casting down imaginations who going to do that God going to do that no you're going to do that casting down IM imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God the word can you say Amen the knowledge of the word and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the word ain't that right now we can't go around making everybody Christians we're not called to do that yes it would be nice if we could get Bazookas and all these things and put it to people's heads and empty the bar fill the church up force people to say Amen force people to love God force people to be divine Christians you can't do that you can't do what people do you can't you you can't uh uh uh how people treat you you you can't you you can't take care of that you you can't make people treat you better than and and and and people love you and people this and people that so that's not what Paul is is saying casting down am man you know people got it into their mind casting down you know we're going to just make the world a better place and and and that's that's what I think the Muslims they want everybody to be Muslims and you know every religion wants everybody to be what they are but that's not what we're worried about we can't help politicians and we can't help what they're doing out there we can't help that they drink and that they smoke and that they you know uh rape and they you know they all it's horrible but we can't help them things so then what we've got to do is us the imaginations that come to us we can break that down I can't help what you do but I can help what I do casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God how where we going to cast that down every thought everything that tries to build up within us that is contrary to this cast it down Hallelujah don't let bitterness get in don't let that lust take root don't let envy and and strife come in don't let that Spirit of division take over every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of the word the knowledge of God bringing down bringing into captivity think of that now you have the ability to bring it into captivity prise Lord to The Obedience of the word obedience of Christ can you say Amen now we looking at Christ Hebrews 5'8 speaking of Jesus said though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered brother brand said well then what was he obedient to the word that's right the word he knew that the word spoke of him he knew that the scriptures he was the Messiah don't you get it the same Revelation that came to him is coming to us we know we are that Rebecca we know we are that bride right so he had to bring that body in subjection to this word his flesh didn't want to be despised and rejected his old flesh didn't want to carry that cross up to up to Calvary his flesh didn't want to just go there and lay his life down and let him nail him and stripe his back with you know and his blood re blood running down and all these things no his flesh didn't want to it cried out if it be thy will let this cup but he had a character about him that said even so thy will be done he knew he couldn't pass the book and I say this you cannot pass the book to another generation you're that generation somebody going to make this word live somebody going to flow in unity somebody going to have the power and the ability to lay their life [Music] down for the word's sake can you say Amen somebody going to walk in the will of God see so so you know Jesus he was to fulfill the word for his day and he couldn't do that without becoming obedient to the word amen can you say Amen you know good and well that Satan was offering all kinds of things outside of Calvary sure offering and trying to show good things I you know now now he knew Jesus knew that it took a Calvary for him to inherit amen the kingdoms but what was Satan trying to do I'll give you the kingdoms come on they're in my hands I'll give them to you you don't have to go to Calvary I'll give them to yourself myself but Jesus knew that wasn't the will of the father I know brother Bram said they're trying to make they're trying to make make a millennium without repentance but before Millennium can happen repentance has got to take place can you say Amen they want to make a millennium Amen to where they can live in adultery and they can live with every wife and every woman and every man and man with man and woman with woman and rebel against the word but there's a bride that realizes that's father that's going to be destroyed we must come to an obedience to the word before before the Millennium can take place see so Jesus had the right character for he said my meat is to do the will of the father another place I do nothing but what the father first show me that's it Hebrews 4:15 tells us that he was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin can you say Amen brother Braham said see he was an obedient son every step was for the father everything he done was to glorify God not glorify himself not to brag and say look what I've done and he says and we seen God in Christ that's it we saw God in Christ right why he' done the will of the father his meat was to do the will he done nothing but what the father first showed him he was his whole breath his whole the whole fiber of his being was to glorify God and we saw God in him amen now God wants to be reflected in Us in the same way amen he said see no man has seen the father at any time but the only begotten of the son has declared him the very move the very action everything that Christ did was God working in him well so then notice brother Bram said then when he come to his adoption how many beli Jesus was adopted I know people don't believe that these days but Jesus actually was adopted brother brandham says that and his adoption took place on Mount Transfiguration that's right right and and and so when so we won't get into all that but brother Brandon says when he come into His adoption that's when all powers in Heaven and Earth was given unto him think of that isn't that wonderful now if you go back in that ninth verse Hebrews uh uh uh you know I don't know what it was now but the Hebrews but he says and being made perfect speaking of Jesus and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that oh B him right he become the author of Eternal salvation unto all them who has the same character as him being tested being proven and yet being obedient you see God has a way of doing things and we must follow that way his rules and his rules are not outside of his word I won't keep much longer but according to Daniel 9 and10 God's law are set his laws we'll say his word are they're set before us by his servants the prophets so it isn't that we come into that just anybody can and put rules of dos and don'ts on us because there's a lot of men that have become dictators and they have brought us under legalism and they have beat us bow breed us beat us they've done all kinds of stuff and with just being sheep you don't know what to do and and you just knuckle down to it but then we find that Jesus said but my sheep hear my voice and so when the voice of God come through a prophet all of a sudden we looked at that old Taskmaster and we said I you can't beat me like that no more Prophet didn't say it that way oh you're misinterpreting it because the prophet didn't do it that way right and he brought us into a balance of the word so see God's laws are set before us by his servants the prophets a Vindicated Prophet is God's voice to us amen you believe that now the prophet said the voice of God copes with the scripture if it doesn't then there's some kind of a wrong voice speaking to you but the right voice will tell you to follow the rules of the Bible no sprinkling no point ing no fosle see he says come right straight out and follow the rules of the Bible so then no man is sent to get this bride ready other than our elaser which is a prophet of Malachi 4 that's what's going to get us ready amen I know we've lived in fear of men's rules but you don't have to fear just listen to a voice of a prophet and get [Music] ready in the beginning God required the first man and first woman to obey his word and he has never changed on that am God actually rejected Cain's sacrifice because it wasn't according to the Revelation that had been given brother Bram said when you leave he said you leave Christ when you fail to obey his word he doesn't leave you you leave him yeah amen and you leave him when you fail to obbey his word so then you might have experienced you know we talked about Wednesday night about the three works of Grace you might have experienced the first work of Grace justification and you you might have come on in from there you might have come into the second work of Grace which is sanctification you may have even come further than that and come into that third work of Grace which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and you've got to come into them steps right now now remember a pro the Pentecost is remember the prophet kept telling the you think you've arrived you got the Holy Ghost you think you've arrived you this is it he said you're just beginning you've got to leave there and come on in to that next which is adoption can you say Amen see you you you got to follow on to get ripened and you got to lay in the presence of the Sun and in order for us to lay in the presence of the son that pentec costal Shu had to pull away talking about hard that legalism had to pull away that that that you know acting as children with gifts had to pull away all that unbelief had to pull away everything just had to away from us talking about hard but you got to come to the full manifestation of the promised word Pentecostal did not do that Lutheran didn't do that Wesley didn't do that that's our place we've come out of her my people right we've heard that we've come out we followed we've obeyed to come to the full promise or full manifestation of the promised word can you say Amen now in order to do that brother brah said a man has to come right back to the spot where he left him and he said when you hear the word come right back it's truly the word of God see there's a little buzzer Rings you better listen to it don't walk across that cuz you'll never get any further until you come right back here where you left him can you say Amen if if you're not coming any further in God stop right there and say okay where did I leave him where did I keep following or quit following him what what was was I hanging on to that I shouldn't be hanging on to is that little bitterness is that little gripe is that little is it that little indifference toward my brother is is it is it you know whatever God is trying to get me to do and I'm being so headstrong well God God ain't going to bless you you ain't going to get any further until you come back where you left him amen can you say Amen brother Bram says another place the only way to follow God is obey his word how many wants to follow him that's right well to follow him is to obey his word I'm going to follow you lord well when you say that that means I'm going to obey your word whatever you ask of me can you sayen so to follow his word now then we have to forsake our own thoughts when they are contrary to his word we we have to forsake our friends when they go contrary to the word we have to forsake our own feelings brother this hurts we have to forsake our own feelings when they become contrary to the word we have to forsake our own beliefs when they go contrary to the word of God can you say Amen see so a prophet remember is not God didn't send a prophet just to preach a good message now I'll be honest you know you you go hear you go hear some of these ministers out there and please don't take me wrong by any means but you hear some of these ministers that are just profound profound preachers and I'm talking about in the secular World Christendom I mean they can they they they can have people shouting you know have people on their feet through the whole sermon and I mean eloquent words I mean power but God when when a Prophet come he didn't have a lot of that he even said I don't even have a personality to give to the people that's what he said he said I told my wife I ain't even got a personality why are these people coming amen he' just stand there good evening friends you know and he' just begin to deliver the word and most of the time he was balling people out chewing the denominations he loved the people but he said I'm branded as a woman hater he said I don't hate women he says they're my I love my sister he said but it's the thing that they're doing see so he didn't come just to preach A good sermon but what he was he was God's stonemason and and he come see remember he come to find that character and then to get her ready once he found that character see and he'd come as a stonemason to cut them Stones remember brother Bram said what good is our testimony he said testimony is Stones what good is the testimony if there's no stonemason to cut to shape them testimonies shape them stones into Sons and Daughters of God so this message hurts amen hope you understand brother Braham said now I said to brother sism and brother NES to your an to to your answer question I said now I don't take neither s either sides with you bre I I know as long as you fuss you're both wrong because I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart after all it's your heart's condition now what's he doing he's shaping he's cutting that's a stonemason ameno right he said I made that a practice to know this that if a man no matter what he does and how much he differ and what he says about me if in my heart not from just a duty but from my heart I can't love that man as well as I love anyone else then I know there's something wrong in here what's he doing he's shaping he's cutting him Stones right another place here's how you get into this Fellowship how do you get it brother brandom how do you how do you ever get into this Fellowship through the shedding of the blood not from some experience no sir not from some emotional mental emotion no sir sir not from some bodily exercise no sir them things are all right as good as they may be but yet that's not the foundation truth leave that set over here to one side till you get back right here uh back here till you get to the Altar and all old things pass away a peace that passes all understanding comes in till you can't you can hate no more you can Envy no more until something that makes you love the worst enemy you've ever had not imagination but something that'll keep you from talking about the neighbor that persecutes you something that'll make you love those who despitefully use you it'll make you pray for those who are indifferent and ugly towards you that's the foundation can you say Amen see and so then notice how all this fits with what Jesus said Matthew 5:44 I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you ain't that right see so that's the very words that Jesus has said now look brother Braham said when you go on the street to rub arms with the world tomorrow brother sister have you got the thinking man's filter when when that man calls you a Holy Roller do you have a thinken man's filter when that somebody said something evil against you do you have a thinking man's filter see do good for evil pray for those that despitefully use you and those who persecute you then you're breathing through the thinking man's filter if you love those who just love you as we shook one another's hands as dearly beloved in the Lord that's good but can you also love the unlovable that's the thinking man's filter that's the spirit of Christ in you loving those who don't love you then you have the reward of God but now if you do that as a duty you still haven't got the thinking man see you're only up in the second side but it's from your heart you really love him then you're breathing through the thinking man's filter and it satisfies a holy man's taste that you know from your heart you forgive everybody everything uh no matter what taken place amen and Jesus says in John 13:35 by this all men shall know your my disciples if you have love one to another amen ain't that right amen this is a common quote that that we know but I'm going to read it and I hope this all right this morning it says love one another above everything love one another no matter everybody say no matter no matter no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let it stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness of things quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and because he's ordained of God to do so now do you remember that he asks the enemy will come when he does just cling that much closer together and the one the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you you that's all don't never Clan among one another or talk or make yourself clannish we are one can you say that with me we are one we are one see he says I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at at with one another now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church and how we behave oursel in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home amen you see what he's doing he's shaping amen he's found a a a Rebecca with character now he's going to get ready why is he saying this because we we fight these things Church there's a move going on that people can just stay home listen to the T press play and Obey and they stay home and you can tell them I I I I've asked them what about the Bible when it says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even that more as you see the day approaching totally don't even ask answer the question but see and I'm not saying that they're bad people you know I pray for them and you know I'm somehow believing they're going to make it but I'm just saying here's a prophet saying don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers and if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying can can you say Amen see because we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have L one for another see that's right stay right together now if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me ever have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life see so it's not just that you can you can look at them with an evil eye and you really think you're hurting them but really what you're doing is you're taking the Christ out of your very life see if your own see so that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you do that you just wax that much closer together take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision that buckles on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you and Rebecca says amen amen that's good I'll be honest people tend to lock up when you read that quote or other quotes like that and and and and sometimes it tends to lock a church up because they think they're getting preached at or they think there's something going on in the church and pastors trying to correct it now that's not true that that's not today but brothers and sisters I'm not preaching this for any particular reason except that God's just laid it on my heart and I know as as as the minister of a gospel I know what testings and trials are and this old preacher has had to get alone and shed real just tears crying out to God for Mercy for me that my heart don't get bitter and that I become so full of hurt anger and and so I'm I'm here just laying this before you that these quotes are for me just as well because I I know know sometimes you don't see God in the trials sometimes you just wonder that maybe he's left you alone or that he's just doing it because maybe you've done wrong or you know and you can start holding guilt or you can start whatever but that's not true none of us like trials how many likes trials y'all like trials buddy I don't like trials if I had the opportunity to to pray that God would take them away which I have God please take this away I really don't want it and somehow he doesn't take it away and there's times that I have to just expose my heart and just have to lay before God with I can't even I don't even know what to pray but just God you know my heart amen God help me and and when thoughts be start coming in and you know how it is you start thoughts start coming in and you start forming situations before they've ever happened if I met so and so and all of a sudden just start things start coming and starts getting into a bad shape when them things start taking place I find myself just praying for that individual God please help that individual God helping somehow if they're in the wrong help them if I'm in the wrong please help me because why I I don't want to be bitter I I don't want the spirit of God to be taken from My Life True you understand what I'm saying and and I see that here's these quotes laying there and I realize that he ain't just preaching just to preach I'm that Rebecca and he's come to shape me he's come to take that trimming away I got to be a Son of God I I I'm coming into my inheritance you understand and so the shaping is there it shouldn't take our joy away from us it shouldn't take our peace from us we just got to lay at the altar before him and say God here I am do what you will with me brother Bram said the same thing about him that it it took molding it took shaping it took things to bring his ministry to where he was where it was can you amen you love the Lord am so we all deal with things from time to time and we're tempted in things and the world the pressure of the world is trying to pull on us you young people and things like that to where your marriage becomes just the common uh you know the the common number as as the others and your children become just the mediocre as the others and preachers just become preach the mediocre messages or we all live just a mediocre life and and I and I tell you we can't we can't give up we can't just lay down can you say amen amen I love the Lord so we find that the message is what shapes us if the musicians will come the message is what shapes us into being Sons and Daughters of God it is not something that we just reference make a reference to every now and then but it is something that is pure it is something that we should apply to our lives on a daily basis humble ourselves before the Lord can you say amen amen I love the Lord do you love him I know we could go more but we um used my time up but I maybe we could just sing that song I love him I love [Music] him oh I love [Music] him I love him because because he first loved [Music] me and per just [Music] my on C [Music] tree sing it again oh I love [Music] you I love you because he first loved me [Music] and per just my [Applause] salvation [Music] oh tree Jesus is the sweetest name oh Jesus is the sweetest name I [Music] know and he's just the [Music] same as his lovely oh and that's in the the reason why I love him [Music] so for [Music] Jesus now as they just play softly you know when we talk maybe preached sermon as like today or last Wednesday whatever you know some might some might think that you know coming back under law when we talk about keeping his Commandments and things but I I don't believe that when John tells us or Jesus tells us or whatever to keep keep his Commandments if you love me keep my Commandments and all these things I that's not because John if we read it the scripture that we read but he starts out if any man sin Brethren don't sin that's not our goal but if any man does sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and if you notice that law of Moses it it brought the people under condemnation it had no mercy in it it had no redemption in it it was as the prophet would call it the law of death but the word that we are to follow the Commandments that we are to keep it's the Word of Life the word of life it actually imparts life to the believer it it it protects them it from death and creates what is like in within that believer it's the only thing that can bring Revival it's the only thing that can bring full Redemption it's the only thing that can bring reconciliation it's what's bringing on the Rapture the changing of our body can you say amen and so brother brandham said that God shows the bride his word of life and she receives it and never doubts it that's that's that's what the bride is right how many believes that you're bride he shows us he has showed us by a prophet his Word of Life she receives it we have received it we've never doubted but if you do sin we have an advocate with the father can you say Amen so that that means that that as we're growing we might have Growing Pains we might fall we might fail in in in an area or or whatever but it's brother Bram said if we didn't have an advocate we'd all be gone there there'd be no way that we'd ever make it we would have no hope whatsoever but because we have an advocate brother brand says we are brought under the rich Ru blood of the Son of God and before God we are pure and holy can you say Amen so we're not worried about being saved today lost tomorrow save the next day and lost it's not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not amen because Ephesians 4:30 it says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption and brother Braham says don't that just take the scare out of it now God's with us everybody say God's with us although you sin you got an advocate tell God you're sorry come on back that's the way to do it don't think you're cast off forever as long as you still have enough desire to come to this church come on God's still with you that's right sure he is can you say Amen I'm I'm so glad for that so he's our advocate so I thank God for that as he's calling us up higher and he's seeing that desire to come that we're not making Grace a disgrace but we're looking at our wrongs we're looking at the mirror of the word and we're saying God I I I know I'm not where I need to be God take me up higher and there's that blood that's sprinkling us that's covering us keeping us covered all the time and brother brandom said this you know talking about the Holy Ghost being our advocate he says it has Mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's a propitiation for your sins it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your Resurrection it's all that God has for you he's an advocate he said how we could go into details of that and break that down of how that went and he said it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes we we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into something and the holy spirit's there to make advocate for for us he's our advocator he stands there he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand and makes intercessions for us that's what the Holy Ghost is can you say amen I think that's why we should pray more he said when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fella he said we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything and you say oh I'm afraid to take a Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't be afraid we have an advocate everybody say I've got an advocate he stands by us he's in us and makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an at for us all the time aren't you glad for that the thing of it is don't wallow in sin can you say Amen you fall get up can you say Amen let's stand to our [Music] feet amen there's that little song see uh I'm glad I know who Jesus is oh I'm glad I know who Jesus is yes I'm glad I know who Jesus is oh he's more than just a story he is the king of glory I'm glad I know through Jesus is sing it now oh I'm glad I know through Jesus is I'm so glad I know who Jesus is he is more than just the story he is the king of glory I'm glad I know who Jesus is one more time oh I'm glad I know who Jesus is I'm glad I know who Jesus is oh he's more than just a story he is the king of glory I'm glad I know who Jesus is sing the last lines well he's more than just the story he is the king of glory glor I'm glad I know who Jesus is well glory to God Amen one more song Amen oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever all the Saving Grace on the street let me lift my voice cares all pass home at last forever to Rejoice yes oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever ever of his Saving Grace we will walk the streets of Glory ever lift my [Music] voice cares all pass yeah ever as they just play softly now God bless you is our prayer and I do want to say it good to have sister Amanda uh with us uh we missed her amen and tell the children we miss them and amen and uh uh we uh just love you all and uh may you have a wonderful day today and again uh the Lord willing brother Josh Martin will be ministering for us
