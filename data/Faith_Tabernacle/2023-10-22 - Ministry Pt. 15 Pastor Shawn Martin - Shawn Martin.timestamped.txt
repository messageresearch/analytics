[47:24] chapter we're going to start at the the
[47:26] first verse but it says and in those
[47:29] days
[47:30] when the number of the disciples was
[47:33] multiplied there arose a m murmuring of
[47:36] the grecians against the Hebrews because
[47:39] their widows were
[47:41] neglected in the daily
[47:45] ministration then the 12 called the
[47:47] multitude of the disciples unto them and
[47:49] said it it is not reason that we should
[47:53] leave the word of God and serve table
[47:56] wherefore Brethren look you out among
[47:59] you seven men of honest report full of
[48:02] the Holy
[48:03] Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint

[48:10] ourselves continually to prayer and to
[48:13] the
[48:14] ministry of the
[48:16] word amen let's just bow our hearts and
[48:21] talk to our Lord

[48:51] certainly as your people we want you to
[48:55] have your way way father we're so
[48:57] honored that you would
[48:59] come so many people meeting in different
[49:02] places and don't know you don't don't
[49:05] even know what your presence is like but
[49:10] you had just grace us with your presence
[49:13] here and we're so
[49:15] thankful father we want you to have your
[49:18] way
[49:19] now you be Lord over our lives you be
[49:24] the Creator you be whatever you want to
[49:27] be and whatever you are Lord may you
[49:31] display it here before us today that

[49:36] had been in the presence of the
[49:39] supernatural pray that you'd forgive us
[49:42] of our sins and our failures Lord and
[49:45] may your blood cover us
[49:47] today I pray just a special prayer for
[49:50] the Reagan family the Parker family the
[49:53] church Lord as they go through this time
[49:56] bearing their loved one father I know
[49:58] it's got to be hard but I pray that you
[50:01] would strengthen them now we ask it in
[50:04] Jesus Christ's name
[50:07] amen praise the Lord you can have your
[50:10] seats
[50:12] today and
[50:16] um I want to continue on this subject of
[50:22] ministry and um
[50:27] of course as we said Ministry is the
[50:31] agency in which the purpose in this case
[50:35] the purpose of God is
[50:38] fulfilled
[50:39] and we read there where they said we
[50:43] will give
[50:44] ourselves to the
[50:46] ministry the
[50:48] ministry and of course this is the
[50:50] ministry of the disciples we've been
[50:52] talking of the ministry of the prophets
[50:55] and um namely um the prophet of Malachi
[51:00] 4 but this is the ministry of the
[51:02] disciples and it's not just the original
[51:06] disciples the
[51:08] 11 uh because
[51:11] um uh we read that it the number of
[51:16] disciples multiplied so it wasn't just
[51:19] those that had walked with uh Jesus when
[51:24] he was on Earth but this is showing that
[51:28] the
[51:29] ministry of Christ uh continuing even
[51:35] after he has ascended up into
[51:38] heaven I am glad that God is determined
[51:41] to fulfill his purpose and and
[51:45] not his whole purpose
[51:48] wasn't entirely
[51:50] fulfilled uh when Christ was upon the
[51:53] Earth and so therefore there has to be a
[51:55] Ministry to complete the
[51:58] purpose and I'm glad that there is a
[52:01] people living today on earth that is
[52:05] wanting him to fulfill his
[52:08] purpose and we are
[52:11] praying as Jesus taught us to pray thy
[52:14] will be done thy kingdom
[52:17] come and uh and so uh but if his will is
[52:23] to be done uh then it's got to be done
[52:27] in us and through
[52:30] us uh his will and and I believe that
[52:33] there is a people that the will of God
[52:36] is being
[52:37] accomplished in Earth and
[52:40] vessels and through and
[52:43] by uh these Earth and vessels and so the
[52:48] will of God is being not only done in me
[52:52] but it is uh uh
[52:55] being worked through me as uh as as
[53:00] Ministry Ministry and so uh uh we are we
[53:05] are as the ministry is being
[53:08] affected uh uh we are being affected by
[53:12] the ministry then we are realizing that
[53:15] we are Sons and Daughters of God and
[53:18] we're being placed we are positionally
[53:21] placed in the word of God for this age
[53:25] and and we are heirs and Joint heirs
[53:29] with Jesus Christ and and it's because
[53:33] Ministry that we not only recognize who
[53:37] we are but we're actually able to uh uh
[53:41] enter and and and uh practice or uh
[53:47] participate become active as heirs as
[53:51] Sons and Daughters of God not not just
[53:54] hearing about it but the ministry has
[53:58] actually uh uh put us in action that now
[54:02] we live as Sons and Daughters of God now
[54:05] we live as heirs and Joint HS with Jesus
[54:09] Christ we act upon it we and and this is
[54:12] because the ministry has affected us
[54:16] amen and and that's the way it ought to
[54:18] be amen but then the ministry is being
[54:21] done through me because I'm part of his
[54:24] ministry and that's that's with every
[54:26] one of us uh uh here a a servant what it
[54:30] is it's it's the ministry it's the
[54:33] servant of God uh uh called into action
[54:38] uh about the father's business so we we
[54:41] are not just uh uh recipients
[54:45] beneficiaries uh by the ministry of God
[54:48] but now we are put into action uh uh by
[54:53] uh doing
[54:55] uh the father's business and so again
[54:59] God has a Ministry and it's an agency by
[55:03] which his will is accomplished as I have
[55:07] said that this ministry has uh different
[55:11] offices or different branches if we
[55:13] could say it that way and uh we've
[55:15] talked about the ministry of angels uh
[55:18] for example and and we know that angels
[55:21] are servants and God sends them to help
[55:23] us to protect us to to help us to
[55:27] believe and and they are sent to give us
[55:30] messages from God and and uh even there
[55:34] in Acts 22 it tells how that Cornelius
[55:38] uh Gentile he was a centurion and the
[55:41] Bible says a man that was just and
[55:44] feared God was warned of God by an Holy
[55:47] Angel to send for Peter and to hear his
[55:50] words so so God has Angels uh by us and
[55:56] brother Brown said they never leave us
[55:58] uh uh angels are with us on a daily
[56:01] basis they go home with us and and we're
[56:04] talking about a Believer now and so but
[56:07] then there is the ministry of the Holy
[56:09] Spirit and and the Holy Spirit has
[56:12] always been God's agent from since the
[56:15] beginning uh uh of of creation and and
[56:19] he's still an agent of God today amen
[56:23] and we've seen how he has worked and uh
[56:26] you know the Bible there in even in in
[56:29] the Book of Genesis that the Earth was
[56:31] dark without form and Waters covered the
[56:35] Earth and and and you you know the
[56:37] scripture but the spirit of God moved
[56:40] upon the face of the deep and and
[56:42] brought a transformation so so God would
[56:45] bring this transformation through the
[56:48] agency of his spirit amen but then we
[56:52] see that man is God's agent as well well
[56:55] and and again uh uh prophets uh they
[56:59] they are agents of God um and and they
[57:02] have a Ministry and we we've read it
[57:05] several times now the ministry of the
[57:07] prophets and and there in Hosea and uh
[57:10] you know uh Moses was God's agent Elijah
[57:15] was God's agent um uh Noah uh was God's
[57:19] agent the prophet even said Jesus was
[57:22] God's agent and so the the prophets were
[57:26] called Gods because the word of the Lord
[57:29] uh came to them and and the word they
[57:33] they spoke as thus sayith the Lord see
[57:36] it came to pass and is still coming to
[57:39] pass all this turmoil that we are seeing
[57:41] the things that are happening uh uh well
[57:44] it's it's all prophecy that prophets
[57:48] years and years thousands of years uh
[57:51] ago prophesied would come uh but it's
[57:55] it's coming to pass because it wasn't
[57:57] their word it was the word of the Lord
[58:01] and it's an eternal word ain't that
[58:03] right well then in in Matthew 16 as we
[58:07] know God promised uh to build his church
[58:10] uh Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build
[58:13] my church and the Gates of Hell cannot
[58:15] Prevail against it well then years later
[58:19] in Ephesians
[58:21] 1:23 uh it it tells us Paul tells us
[58:24] that the church that God promised to
[58:26] build is his body the church is the body
[58:31] of Jesus Christ the fullness of him that
[58:34] filth all in all ain't that right so so
[58:38] again the church is the body of Jesus
[58:41] Christ and and it's as Paul would teach
[58:44] us it's a many membered body uh uh uh
[58:49] men and women uh boys and girls uh uh
[58:53] they're part of of this body of of Jesus
[58:57] Christ and and so now the prophet now we
[59:01] thank God for the prophet and and uh I
[59:05] can never overemphasize the the the the
[59:08] appreciation the importance of God
[59:11] sending us a prophet but he was not the
[59:13] member of the body he was just a member
[59:17] of the body he was not the body he was
[59:20] part of the body ain't that right and
[59:23] and so uh just as the prophet said Moses
[59:27] wasn't the children of Israel he was
[59:29] just one of them ain't that right and so
[59:33] but but we know that that that the
[59:35] prophet had a uh important uh uh message
[59:39] to bring and and uh um and and and so uh
[59:44] brother brandham he he was sent as we
[59:47] believe with a Divine message to lead us
[59:50] into the land of promise just as Moses
[59:53] was sent with a message to lead the
[59:55] people into the land of promise so has
[59:58] this message and the prophet's message
[1:00:02] is still leading the church do you
[1:00:04] believe that it's still leading the
[1:00:06] church and and because it it was not
[1:00:10] brother branham's message it was God
[1:00:12] himself it was it was The Headstone it
[1:00:16] it was our headship amen so you'll
[1:00:19] you'll never you'll you'll you you'll
[1:00:22] never surpass the message that God has
[1:00:25] sent to us we will we will never ever
[1:00:28] ever need a new message amen uh to take
[1:00:32] us further in God this message is an
[1:00:35] eternal message and it is taking us home
[1:00:39] it and it's and it's calling us this
[1:00:42] message is calling us to come up higher
[1:00:45] amen and and so it it it it it's so
[1:00:50] important for the body of Believers amen
[1:00:53] this message is
[1:00:55] but the ministry of Christ isn't just to
[1:00:58] lay dormant just because the prophet has
[1:01:01] left the scene but it the ministry of
[1:01:05] God is still in
[1:01:07] operation and and and uh uh and and this
[1:01:11] ministry is in is is working by the
[1:01:15] members of the body of Christ it's it's
[1:01:19] in operation in the members of the body
[1:01:23] uh uh Ephesians 4 and8 uh Paul would
[1:01:27] tell us wherefore he saith when he
[1:01:29] ascended upon on high he led captivity
[1:01:32] captive and gave gifts everybody say
[1:01:34] gave gifts unto men he gave gifts unto
[1:01:39] men so so looking at these gifts uh
[1:01:43] within the body of within the body of
[1:01:47] Christ uh is the fold Ministry uh
[1:01:51] there's the prophets the evangelists
[1:01:53] teachers
[1:01:55] Apostles pastors and evangelists ain't
[1:01:58] that right I believe that there's
[1:02:00] prophets uh that are still upon the
[1:02:02] Earth today I I believe that brother
[1:02:04] brandom told us that there's Major
[1:02:06] Prophets and then there's Minor Prophets
[1:02:09] and uh uh but but even as Paul Paul was
[1:02:13] a prophet he was the church age
[1:02:15] messenger he was an important uh Prophet
[1:02:18] if you know what I mean he's the one
[1:02:19] that would set the church in order and
[1:02:22] and and get it get it going in the right
[1:02:24] Direction and things like that and and
[1:02:27] and and no one no one could preach
[1:02:29] against or or different than what Paul
[1:02:31] preached and here we are thousands of
[1:02:34] years later uh uh hundreds or whatever
[1:02:37] and and down to the seventh Church age
[1:02:39] and the prophet would tell say I
[1:02:41] preached what Paul preached he said I
[1:02:43] never wavered from what he preached
[1:02:45] because Paul laid that foundation so he
[1:02:47] was important but then there was the
[1:02:50] prophet Abus uh that was that was uh
[1:02:53] that the Bible me itions uh uh that was
[1:02:56] in Paul's day and and and and and and so
[1:03:01] so there there are I believe prophets
[1:03:03] within the fful ministry uh uh but they
[1:03:07] they don't have that importance of of
[1:03:10] what brother brandham had to us they are
[1:03:13] not um uh someone that we you know I I
[1:03:18] don't believe that we're just following
[1:03:19] one individual anymore I I in other
[1:03:23] words I don't believe that God raised
[1:03:24] raes up another prophet and so we ignore
[1:03:27] what brother brandham was and we follow
[1:03:28] this guy I I don't believe that amen but
[1:03:32] but there there is a fold Ministry and
[1:03:36] and Prophets are included in that and so
[1:03:39] but then uh uh we find that God himself
[1:03:43] placed that these gifts in into the
[1:03:46] church in his church and and and and
[1:03:50] we'll see that there in Ephesians
[1:03:53] 4:12 that Paul gives the
[1:03:56] description of the purpose of this fful
[1:04:00] ministry and it's for the perfecting of
[1:04:03] the Saints it's for the work of the
[1:04:06] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:04:09] Christ till we all come in the unity of
[1:04:12] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[1:04:15] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:04:18] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:04:20] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[1:04:23] children toss to and fro ain't that
[1:04:26] right and carried about with every wind
[1:04:29] of Doctrine by the Slate of men and
[1:04:31] cunning craftiness and whereby they lie
[1:04:34] and wait to deceive but speaking the
[1:04:36] truth and love may grow up into him in
[1:04:39] all things which is the head even Christ
[1:04:43] ain't that right so so we we uh uh this
[1:04:47] is the purpose of of the five-fold
[1:04:49] ministry that uh and why the five-fold
[1:04:52] ministry is important
[1:04:54] uh uh uh today uh but but then we find
[1:04:59] that in the body of of Christ is the
[1:05:02] ministry of the Saints according to
[1:05:05] first uh Corinthians 16 and5 I believe
[1:05:09] and and uh uh Paul mentions the ministry
[1:05:13] of the Saints so it's not just a fifo
[1:05:18] Ministry but it's a Ministry that
[1:05:22] operates uh through the B
[1:05:25] amen uh uh now brother Bram talked and
[1:05:28] we'll get into it more but how that God
[1:05:31] ordained uh the fivefold ministry these
[1:05:34] a pastor just God just just doesn't come
[1:05:37] and say well I'm going to be a pastor
[1:05:38] today you know they are ordained gifts
[1:05:42] and and predestinated gifts and and so
[1:05:45] but then there's the ministry of the
[1:05:46] Saints so if you are in the body of
[1:05:51] Christ uh then you are part of the
[1:05:55] ministry in some way or another it's
[1:05:58] it's not that anyone in in the body of
[1:06:02] Christ uh any member doesn't just sit on
[1:06:05] the sidelines and watch everybody do the
[1:06:07] work I if you are part of the body you
[1:06:12] are part of ministry in some way or
[1:06:16] another brother Bram said see God has
[1:06:19] put us each one in the body to do
[1:06:24] certain things amen so then that puts a
[1:06:27] responsibility to us all that that no
[1:06:30] man liveth to himself no man dieth to
[1:06:33] himself but but every one of us will be
[1:06:36] held responsible to God for what he's
[1:06:40] called us to do and and so uh um you
[1:06:44] know uh uh we we find here in First
[1:06:48] Corinthians 12 and 27 it says now you
[1:06:52] are the body of Christ and and I'm I'm
[1:06:56] so glad that that that that uh uh God
[1:07:00] has given us an
[1:07:02] identity that it's not Faith Tabernacle
[1:07:05] you know and it's not such and such and
[1:07:07] it's not this one or whatever but we are
[1:07:10] the body of Christ amen anyone can come
[1:07:14] to Faith Tabernacle but not everybody
[1:07:17] can come into the body of Christ and so
[1:07:21] you are the body of Christ and members
[1:07:24] everybody say members in particular see
[1:07:29] God ha set some in the church first
[1:07:33] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[1:07:36] teachers after that Miracles then Gifts
[1:07:39] of healing helps governments diversities
[1:07:43] of tongues see well also in the body now
[1:07:48] God has placed nine spiritual gifts and
[1:07:52] and uh brother Brown said there's nine
[1:07:54] spiritual gifts promised to the body
[1:07:58] that is the body of Believers another
[1:08:02] place they work through the body in
[1:08:05] another place he says it circles through
[1:08:08] the body it it circles notice it's not a
[1:08:12] Praying
[1:08:13] individual uh uh it it it it'll be uh on
[1:08:17] this one here tonight let's let let's
[1:08:20] say it it comes on you know uh uh uh you
[1:08:24] know s Sister Kim weeks it it comes on
[1:08:26] her this morning and and she could give
[1:08:29] a prophecy and and and and or or
[1:08:32] whatever and and then he says then it'll
[1:08:35] be on another one here here you know
[1:08:39] it'll be on this one here and it'll be
[1:08:40] on another one the next night so it
[1:08:43] could it could go from Sister Kim weeks
[1:08:45] to Sister Kim Brumfield or sister Hannah
[1:08:48] or it it it so so it it it circles
[1:08:51] through the body nine spiritual gifts it
[1:08:55] in such so he said see the person can
[1:08:57] pray the prayer of faith tonight or this
[1:09:00] person can pray the prayer of faith
[1:09:02] tonight and maybe it's on this one over
[1:09:06] here the next night over on that see
[1:09:08] it's a gift that's in the body working
[1:09:12] around to all of you Milling through the
[1:09:15] body nine spiritual gifts so this one
[1:09:19] might prophesy tonight now that's where
[1:09:21] we get in trouble he said see one might
[1:09:24] prophesy and tell the truth that doesn't
[1:09:26] make you a prophet see it might never
[1:09:30] come to you again now in in the
[1:09:33] Pentecostals you know it was always
[1:09:36] certain individuals prophesying always
[1:09:38] certain individuals speaking in tongues
[1:09:41] always certain individual but but and so
[1:09:44] so it it was like well if if they ain't
[1:09:46] going to be here well we ain't going to
[1:09:47] have no prophecy tonight you know if if
[1:09:50] they ain't going to be here cuz it
[1:09:51] seemed like they are the gifted one but
[1:09:53] but then the prophet teaches us that's
[1:09:55] not true brother be God could move up on
[1:09:58] you Amen to prophesy and and it would be
[1:10:01] accurate and never use you in that way
[1:10:04] again see and then someone else see and
[1:10:07] and so what that does it it puts us in
[1:10:11] anticipation and and God if you want to
[1:10:13] use me tonight use me you know uh uh uh
[1:10:17] I'm I'm at your bidding ain't that right
[1:10:19] not to say well I ain't got the gift
[1:10:21] they're the one that's the spiritual one
[1:10:22] I'm just sitting here no no no no no if
[1:10:24] you're part of the body then the gifts
[1:10:27] will circulate through the body that's
[1:10:29] why then then no one has a drawing no
[1:10:32] one says well see I'm the spiritual one
[1:10:34] y'all need to come follow me no no no
[1:10:36] it's not that it's a body can you sayen
[1:10:40] it operates see so being being now in
[1:10:44] the body is so important Amen to be in
[1:10:48] the body do you realize the prophet said
[1:10:51] no man has a right to worship has no
[1:10:54] right to worship outside of being in the
[1:10:57] body of the Lord Jesus Christ now you
[1:10:59] think of that worship is only accepted
[1:11:03] before God when a person is in the body
[1:11:08] amen another place he said there is no
[1:11:11] Fellowship outside of the body of Jesus
[1:11:15] Christ you can't have fellowship with
[1:11:18] God Amen no wonder the world is has no
[1:11:23] idea idea that God is present today and
[1:11:27] has no relationship because you have to
[1:11:29] be in the body of Christ to have True
[1:11:33] Fellowship amen so in the body of Christ
[1:11:37] is where the bride uh brother brandham
[1:11:40] said where the bride Church word will
[1:11:43] unite we've been talking you know
[1:11:46] brother Bram talks about the uniting of
[1:11:48] of the word and and the word seeing the
[1:11:51] word the word uniting with the word and
[1:11:53] all that well it does not happen unless
[1:11:56] you're in the body of Christ because it
[1:11:59] is a word body ain't that right it's a
[1:12:02] word body now so brother brand says see
[1:12:05] get Christ in your heart Christ and the
[1:12:08] Holy Spirit is the same thing Holy
[1:12:11] Spirit Christ means the anointed one see
[1:12:14] and the Holy Spirit is that anointing
[1:12:17] and you are the one that's anointed see
[1:12:21] in the body now see and it's Christ in
[1:12:25] you anointing you so don't put limits on
[1:12:29] God if Christ is in you don't put limits
[1:12:32] on God and say well I I really can't do
[1:12:34] that and I don't know I I I just ain't
[1:12:36] I'm nothing oh yes you are if you're
[1:12:38] part of the body if Christ is in you
[1:12:41] then he's got something for you to do
[1:12:43] it's a Ministry ain't that right yes sir
[1:12:47] I mean if you're anything if your body
[1:12:49] goes dead you're going to know it you
[1:12:50] know if your nerve goes dead you know it
[1:12:53] if your feelings go dead you know it if
[1:12:56] if your liver goes dead well you know it
[1:12:59] right if your heart goes dead you go
[1:13:02] dead you know uh uh uh whatever goes
[1:13:05] dead and and if the member of your body
[1:13:08] says well I ain't going to function
[1:13:09] today you know then then the rest of the
[1:13:12] body says what in the world just
[1:13:13] happened to my hand you know I can't get
[1:13:15] it to move I I'm wanting to play the
[1:13:17] guitar but I can't do it I want to play
[1:13:19] drums I can't do it you know the stupid
[1:13:21] thing won't work you know well you going
[1:13:22] to go to the doctor doctor what just
[1:13:24] happened you know uh uh my hand don't
[1:13:26] work it's just you know and and and
[1:13:29] these things well could you imagine the
[1:13:31] body of Christ doing the same thing well
[1:13:34] I'm body but you ain't going to work you
[1:13:36] know uh uh well I'm part of it I know I
[1:13:39] am but I ain't doing that ain't no way
[1:13:41] well then you either are part of the
[1:13:43] body or not and God's body is not a sick
[1:13:46] body can you say man not in this day
[1:13:49] anyways so he said see he said see it's
[1:13:53] it's it's Christ in you anointing you
[1:13:56] then you got the right thing then he can
[1:14:00] use you to anything see he wants to use
[1:14:04] you in because you're in the body and
[1:14:08] subject to any of those
[1:14:11] gifts ain't that right but see to have
[1:14:14] one of the gifts and I want you to
[1:14:16] notice this as we go but to have one of
[1:14:20] the gifts outside the body it wouldn't
[1:14:24] do you any
[1:14:26] good ain't that right though I speak
[1:14:28] with tongues of men and and and angels
[1:14:31] and and have not charity it profit me
[1:14:33] nothing though I have faith and can
[1:14:35] understand all the mysteries of God
[1:14:36] profiteth me nothing though I give my
[1:14:39] body to be burned as a sacrifice give
[1:14:41] all my goods to the poor though I have
[1:14:43] faith to move a mountain I am nothing
[1:14:45] see don't depend on those things the
[1:14:48] spirit the holy spirit is a being it's
[1:14:51] God God in you you the person God that's
[1:14:55] lit your whole entire being you're
[1:14:58] changed you're a new creature and and
[1:15:02] little thing that that that's uh wrong
[1:15:05] he'll tell you that's wrong then quit
[1:15:07] don't do it see then you say father I
[1:15:10] didn't mean to do that see forgive me
[1:15:12] and you you understand what I'm saying
[1:15:14] see uh then it shows that there's
[1:15:16] something working in you well I don't
[1:15:18] have to do that bless God I I don't care
[1:15:20] you know well then it shows that God
[1:15:22] can't deal with you it it shows you know
[1:15:25] you keep holding him grudges well it
[1:15:27] shows God can't deal with you you know
[1:15:29] because if you're in the body then
[1:15:32] there's there there's something there
[1:15:33] that's going to tell you you're wrong
[1:15:35] you shouldn't do that you you shouldn't
[1:15:37] be living half backslid you you you you
[1:15:39] shouldn't be doing these things you
[1:15:41] should be on fire for me you should you
[1:15:43] should be giv more your your all to to
[1:15:46] to to the to the the the message the
[1:15:49] word to the Lord instead of to the world
[1:15:52] you're putting all that and see well
[1:15:53] then if if Christ is in you he begins to
[1:15:56] convict you right amen and not to not to
[1:16:00] condemn anyone that's anyone that brings
[1:16:03] if if if if the gospel brings
[1:16:05] condemnation to a person to where they
[1:16:08] get bitter they get hard and say well I
[1:16:10] ain't doing it I don't you know well
[1:16:12] then it shows that there's something not
[1:16:13] right because if Christ is in you amen
[1:16:17] well the Bible says the spirit of a
[1:16:18] prophet is subject to a prophet amen and
[1:16:21] so the The Same Spirit that is upon a
[1:16:23] prophet is upon a an individual then all
[1:16:27] of a sudden there's a connection there
[1:16:29] and and and and the spirit that's upon
[1:16:31] that fivefold Ministry amen and they
[1:16:34] begin to start just uh uh uh uh dealing
[1:16:36] with things in a man's life a woman's
[1:16:38] life a boy girl's life amen and that
[1:16:41] spirit of God is upon them amen instead
[1:16:44] of bringing a rebellion then then then
[1:16:46] it brings a submission it it brings a a
[1:16:49] contriteness because the same spirit
[1:16:52] that is talking behind the in in in in
[1:16:54] in the ministry of the fivefold ministry
[1:16:57] or the prophet or whatever is the same
[1:17:00] spirit that is upon the
[1:17:03] individual uh uh hope you understand
[1:17:05] what I'm saying now amen see so so but
[1:17:08] but then then you see what what is it
[1:17:11] then God God does these things to bring
[1:17:14] because he wants to work his gifts in
[1:17:16] the church he wants to work himself in
[1:17:20] the church ain't that right so now
[1:17:23] brother brandham said see you receive
[1:17:25] the Holy Spirit and think well that's
[1:17:27] just as that's as much as I can go well
[1:17:30] see you're just ready to go to work for
[1:17:34] God then when you got the baptism of the
[1:17:36] Holy Ghost brother BR said Pentecost
[1:17:38] thought well that's it that's that's as
[1:17:40] far as I got to go brother said that's
[1:17:41] not true when when you get the Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost you're just starting cuz now now
[1:17:48] you're baptized into the body and now
[1:17:50] you're ready to go to work for God then
[1:17:53] ain't that right see he said when you're
[1:17:56] when you receive the Holy Spirit by
[1:17:57] Believing on Jesus Christ and receiving
[1:18:00] the Holy Spirit then you're just a
[1:18:03] candidate to go to work for God then
[1:18:07] notice then go to yielding your members
[1:18:10] to him yield your members to him see
[1:18:13] what he will have you to do he might
[1:18:15] have you to preach sing testify pass out
[1:18:18] tracks talk to people bring someone to
[1:18:20] church all kinds of gifts and helps
[1:18:22] that's in the Body of Christ some are
[1:18:24] called for one thing some for another
[1:18:26] ain't that right but it has to be in the
[1:18:30] body or it does you no good ain't that
[1:18:33] right see and in the body he says in
[1:18:36] another place we are subject to the nine
[1:18:41] spiritual
[1:18:42] gifts in the body ain't that right see
[1:18:47] so now we know that that a person can
[1:18:50] have a Ministry outside of being in the
[1:18:53] body of Christ uh but he is working
[1:18:57] independently on his
[1:18:59] own because he's not joined with the
[1:19:02] members of the body he's not under the
[1:19:05] headship that all the members are in the
[1:19:08] body he's outside the body ain't that
[1:19:11] right yes sir see and so so he's working
[1:19:15] independently he he might be under the
[1:19:17] body of a Baptist or a body of a
[1:19:20] Pentecostal or a body of whatever see
[1:19:23] and and and and and and this might be
[1:19:25] just a little uh different uh of to say
[1:19:28] but but I've got members in my body
[1:19:30] brother Tim you've got members under in
[1:19:31] in your body you you know I don't
[1:19:34] control your members because they're not
[1:19:36] part of they're not part of the body of
[1:19:38] my body and and you don't control my
[1:19:41] members because I that they're not part
[1:19:43] of your body and and so God gave a head
[1:19:46] for this body God gave a head for your
[1:19:48] body and and there's an intelligence
[1:19:50] there that your members come under and
[1:19:52] there's an intelligence that my members
[1:19:54] come under you understand what I'm
[1:19:56] saying and and so it works just that way
[1:19:59] so so a Ministry outside the body of
[1:20:02] Christ is under another intelligence it
[1:20:06] could be a Baptist it could be a
[1:20:07] Pentecostal it could be it could be
[1:20:10] whatever his own inspiration but when
[1:20:12] it's in the body there's only one
[1:20:15] intelligence and that's God ain't that
[1:20:18] right see so then then he's working
[1:20:21] independently on his own
[1:20:23] outside the body so to have one of the
[1:20:26] gifts outside the body it it it it will
[1:20:29] not do you a bit of good see so so the
[1:20:32] ministry of God can you say that with me
[1:20:35] the ministry of God is for the body of
[1:20:39] Christ the ministry of God is for the
[1:20:43] body of Christ see and and so the body
[1:20:47] why because the body Christ's body is
[1:20:50] God's agent here on Earth and that body
[1:20:53] is made up of human beings ain't that
[1:20:57] right see so now notice uh brother
[1:20:59] brandom would tell us in this last day
[1:21:02] there is again another people and I
[1:21:05] believe you and I are the people that he
[1:21:08] was talking about in the land who under
[1:21:11] their messenger see will be the final
[1:21:15] voice to the final age ain't that right
[1:21:18] well see if you're in the body you
[1:21:21] become the final voice us to the final
[1:21:24] age ain't that right see and so he said
[1:21:28] yes sir the church is no longer uh the
[1:21:31] mouthpiece of God denominations and and
[1:21:35] a lot of Independence either you see
[1:21:37] it's its own mouthpiece it has a
[1:21:40] Ministry but it's its own Ministry it
[1:21:42] it's saying things but it's it's it's
[1:21:44] it's under the inspiration of its own
[1:21:47] see and and he says see the the uh it's
[1:21:50] it's its own mouthpiece so God is
[1:21:52] turning on her he will confound her
[1:21:54] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:21:58] the voice of God will be in her the
[1:22:02] voice of God can you say Amen it and you
[1:22:06] don't have to preach to be the voice of
[1:22:08] God you don't have to prophesy to be the
[1:22:10] voice of God Amen brother Brandon
[1:22:12] brought it down to every one of us he
[1:22:13] says how we need thousands of lived
[1:22:17] voices lived voices thundering out the
[1:22:21] voice of God
[1:22:23] can you say Amen so so you you you
[1:22:26] living according to this message and
[1:22:28] walking not according to some legalist
[1:22:30] not according to some calvinist not
[1:22:32] according to some Theology and
[1:22:34] theologian or or uh whatever see but but
[1:22:37] you're living according to the message
[1:22:40] of the hour your life is now becoming a
[1:22:43] thunder a living voice ain't that right
[1:22:47] talking about ministry right and and so
[1:22:50] uh uh now we know the and and thank God
[1:22:53] for the message cuz we wouldn't have
[1:22:54] known it but a man can be absolutely
[1:22:57] anointed of the Holy Ghost and still be
[1:22:59] a
[1:23:00] devil he can prophesy speak in tongues
[1:23:03] interpret tongues see Visions have
[1:23:05] dreams dance shout you know cast out
[1:23:09] Devils perform Miracles and still be a
[1:23:13] devil Matthew
[1:23:15] 7:21 see not everyone that saith unto me
[1:23:18] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:23:20] of heaven but he that doeth my will
[1:23:23] which is in heaven Prophet said his will
[1:23:26] is his word ain't that right his will is
[1:23:30] his word now many will say unto me in
[1:23:32] that day see Lord Lord have we not
[1:23:34] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[1:23:36] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:23:38] done many wonderful Works notice they
[1:23:40] had a Ministry but it was outside the
[1:23:43] body they had a ministry right see and
[1:23:46] so he says then will I profess unto them
[1:23:49] I never knew you depart from me ye that
[1:23:51] work iniquity it therefore whosoever
[1:23:54] heareth these things of mine and do with
[1:23:58] them I will liken him unto a wise man
[1:24:01] which built his house upon a rock now
[1:24:03] now we know that's the bride of Christ
[1:24:06] that's every member that's belongs in
[1:24:08] the body see and the rain descended and
[1:24:10] the floods came and the winds blew and
[1:24:13] beat up on that house and it fell not
[1:24:14] for it was founded up on a rock ain't
[1:24:18] that right so notice what the prophet
[1:24:20] said Jesus never did anything until seen
[1:24:23] of the Father the father first showed
[1:24:26] him see and and Harmony between God and
[1:24:29] Christ see so will the bride he shows
[1:24:33] her his Word of Life notice how the
[1:24:35] ministry functions in the body he shows
[1:24:38] her his word of life he shows her she
[1:24:41] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:24:45] can harm her not even death for if the
[1:24:47] seed be planted the water will raise it
[1:24:49] up again amen he said I got a great big
[1:24:51] Hallelujah here is the secret the word
[1:24:54] is in the bride the word is in the body
[1:24:58] can you say Amen see and the mind of
[1:25:01] Christ and the mind of Christ to know
[1:25:03] what he wants done with the word she
[1:25:06] does it in his name she has thus sayith
[1:25:09] the Lord then it is gerti so the Holy
[1:25:13] Spirit Waters it until it is grown and
[1:25:15] serves its purpose they do only his
[1:25:21] will they prophesy they prophesy in his
[1:25:24] will according to his will ain't that
[1:25:28] right when they preach when they sing
[1:25:30] when they whatever it's in the
[1:25:33] body they do only his will see he says
[1:25:37] amen I believe that no one can persuade
[1:25:39] them different they have this they they
[1:25:41] have thus sayith the Lord or they keep
[1:25:45] still ain't that right see so now we all
[1:25:49] know how do we get into the body 1
[1:25:51] Corinthians uh two I think or 12 13 says
[1:25:55] for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[1:25:57] into one body by one Spirit everybody
[1:26:00] say one
[1:26:02] Spirit we are baptized into one body
[1:26:06] ain't that right whether we be Jews
[1:26:08] Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and
[1:26:11] have all been made to drink into one
[1:26:14] spirit so notice the purpose of this
[1:26:18] body brother Ram says it was God's
[1:26:20] purpose to bring forth a people like un
[1:26:23] to himself that would be a word bright
[1:26:25] so that that's the ministry that that's
[1:26:28] that's why God the Min the purpose of of
[1:26:31] the the the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:33] the purpose of the ministry of the
[1:26:35] prophet in this day the purpose of the
[1:26:37] ministry of the angels and and the
[1:26:39] purpose of is to bring a people forth
[1:26:43] like unto himself that will be a word
[1:26:48] Bride Can you say amen amen now that's
[1:26:52] the focus is a word bride now now we we
[1:26:56] we ain't focusing on our ministry we're
[1:26:59] not focused on well I got to speak in
[1:27:00] tongues I got to do this I got to do
[1:27:02] that and and all these things no no no
[1:27:04] that belongs in the body but the the the
[1:27:07] goal is God's purpose is to bring a word
[1:27:11] bride ain't that right because if you're
[1:27:14] not in that word body if you're not in
[1:27:16] that word bride you can have gifts and
[1:27:18] be a loose cannon with
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:22] can you say
[1:27:24] Amen liking to believe anything say
[1:27:27] anything do anything believe
[1:27:29] anything see so it was God's purpose to
[1:27:33] bring forth a people like un to himself
[1:27:35] that would be a word bride she was
[1:27:37] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:27:39] world in him she was forn and beloved
[1:27:43] before she was ever brought forth during
[1:27:45] the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed
[1:27:48] by his blood and can never come into
[1:27:51] condemnation
[1:27:53] aren't you glad to be part of that body
[1:27:55] she can never be in the Judgment because
[1:27:57] sin cannot be imputed unto her Romans
[1:28:00] 4:8 see blessed is the man to whom the
[1:28:02] Lord will not impute sin but indeed she
[1:28:05] shall be with him in his throne of
[1:28:08] judgment judging the world and even
[1:28:11] angels her name each of her members see
[1:28:16] each of her members was written in the
[1:28:18] section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:28:20] before the foundation of the world world
[1:28:23] so as we we're looking at this body uh
[1:28:26] uh only only the predestinated will go
[1:28:29] into the
[1:28:31] body and and you know several quotes
[1:28:34] here but brother Bram said no man ever
[1:28:36] sought God God sought the man and the
[1:28:39] reason he knowed him he saw it before
[1:28:42] the foundation of the world and
[1:28:45] predestinated it he predestinated you
[1:28:49] here to come into the body of Christ
[1:28:52] he says in another place I'm I'm
[1:28:54] thankful for a church Universal Triumph
[1:28:57] already predestinated called and sealed
[1:29:00] and ordained to the
[1:29:03] body aren't you glad for that there's a
[1:29:06] reason that God would call you into this
[1:29:08] message there's a reason why there's
[1:29:11] something in you that is is just just
[1:29:14] draw to this message and wanting to be
[1:29:16] more like God you were ordained to be
[1:29:20] that amen sir after being born he says
[1:29:25] we are predestinated unto the adoption
[1:29:27] to be placed in the body of Christ
[1:29:31] another place he says Jesus said all the
[1:29:33] father ha given me has has given me to
[1:29:36] redeem all that the father ha given me
[1:29:39] given me to redeem they died with me at
[1:29:42] Calvary they raised with me in the
[1:29:44] resurrection all that he has given me
[1:29:47] will come to me they'll be placed in the
[1:29:50] body where foot arm nose mouth whatever
[1:29:54] it is they'll be placed in there can you
[1:29:57] say Amen yes sir whatever part of the
[1:30:00] body God puts you in and has ordained
[1:30:03] you to be you're still subject to all
[1:30:05] these gifts you're part of the
[1:30:08] ministry take your legs away you can't
[1:30:12] walk so God's got people to be the leg
[1:30:15] part can you say Amen right every part
[1:30:20] of the body every remember to the least
[1:30:23] to the most important whatever that
[1:30:25] seeth to be important to the very seeth
[1:30:28] to be the least whatever you're
[1:30:30] important to God or God would have never
[1:30:32] ordained you for
[1:30:35] this we are ordained to that body notice
[1:30:39] when the last Soul comes into the body
[1:30:42] the door will be closed for the body
[1:30:45] will be
[1:30:48] complete now we're close
[1:30:50] somewhere amen I believe that yes we're
[1:30:56] close when that last member comes into
[1:31:00] the body it's
[1:31:02] over see God the prophet said is not
[1:31:05] going to have a freak body or a freak
[1:31:08] bride right he's not going to have 20
[1:31:12] fingers on the
[1:31:13] hands one
[1:31:15] hand he's ordained that body to be
[1:31:20] perfect ain't that right
[1:31:23] so so if if God's called you to for an
[1:31:25] little bitty part
[1:31:28] Rejoice that you're still part of the
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:34] body sir ain't that
[1:31:37] right you might be the toe that gets
[1:31:39] stepped on all the
[1:31:41] time not the hand not the
[1:31:44] nose but at least you're part of the
[1:31:47] body there's a
[1:31:50] reason Hallelujah brother Braham said
[1:31:52] see the body will just have so many
[1:31:54] members whose names were put on the
[1:31:56] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:31:57] foundation of the world which Jesus come
[1:31:59] to take like Adam walk right out to save
[1:32:03] his wife so God again has ordained gifts
[1:32:07] to the body why because the prophet said
[1:32:11] gifts
[1:32:13] magnify gifts magnify notice he sends
[1:32:18] gifts into the church to make his
[1:32:21] presence
[1:32:23] known it ain't about you it ain't about
[1:32:27] me it ain't about my Ministry this is a
[1:32:31] body Ministry this is a bride
[1:32:33] Ministry and if you're placed in the
[1:32:36] body and subject to gifts it's only to
[1:32:39] make his presence
[1:32:43] known another place he said we don't
[1:32:46] believe these Cults and clans we believe
[1:32:48] God is the word but he embodies himself
[1:32:52] taken your body my body and gives you
[1:32:57] gifts gives me gifts and through these
[1:32:59] gifts He makes himself known so this is
[1:33:04] why gifts are given to the body of
[1:33:06] Christ through that Ministry He makes
[1:33:09] himself known now uh uh brother brandom
[1:33:14] says what is the body of Christ this is
[1:33:17] kind of a lengthy quote but he said some
[1:33:19] are Apostles some are prophets some are
[1:33:21] teachers some are evangelists some are
[1:33:24] pastors is that right see we're called
[1:33:26] to others has Gifts of tongues
[1:33:28] interpretation of tongues wisdom
[1:33:30] knowledge Miracles working of Miracles
[1:33:32] all these different gifts now what what
[1:33:34] what do they do what did they do now
[1:33:36] he's going to talk about uh the
[1:33:38] Pentecostals uh what did they do they
[1:33:41] practiced that a little bit what let it
[1:33:43] run
[1:33:45] loose they let it run loose like I don't
[1:33:48] know why see one raised up speaking
[1:33:51] tongues and the other one go to talking
[1:33:54] so brother brandom IM imitates the sound
[1:33:56] of disorder and confusion preachers a
[1:34:00] preacher will be preaching making altar
[1:34:02] call and and somebody raise up and speak
[1:34:04] in tongues Hallelujah glory to God and
[1:34:07] if the preacher happens to go on with
[1:34:09] his message being anointed then the
[1:34:12] people say oh that
[1:34:13] backslider it's because they're not
[1:34:16] taught in other words the preacher
[1:34:20] ignores that that that one that is
[1:34:22] trying to do the prophesy and speaking
[1:34:23] in tongues he's out of order to begin
[1:34:26] with God does not move upon the minister
[1:34:29] to start preaching and then move up on
[1:34:32] someone else to stop him brother brandom
[1:34:35] said that's an disorder that's
[1:34:39] confusion I'm going to say it's the
[1:34:41] ministry outside the
[1:34:45] body so he says see the Bible said the
[1:34:49] spirit of the prophets is subject to the
[1:34:51] Prophet God is no author of confusion
[1:34:55] when I'm standing here I Minister here
[1:34:58] under the anointing of God no matter how
[1:35:00] much you want to speak with tongues hold
[1:35:02] your peace till God's finished here then
[1:35:07] if you speak with tongues it cannot be
[1:35:09] everybody say it cannot be some
[1:35:11] repeating of
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:16] scripture but you see he says see
[1:35:18] because God said don't use vain
[1:35:21] reputation
[1:35:23] repetition ain't that
[1:35:25] right see but it's a message directly to
[1:35:31] somebody ask me one time put your finger
[1:35:34] on one time that the Holy Spirit ever
[1:35:36] under the discernment told somebody
[1:35:38] repeated a scripture over and
[1:35:42] over we don't need someone to raise up
[1:35:44] in the church and say oh well America is
[1:35:46] finished America is finished God is
[1:35:49] coming come on
[1:35:52] we know
[1:35:55] that
[1:35:57] right see it see it it and we'll get
[1:36:00] more into it but it has to be something
[1:36:03] that it has to be
[1:36:07] judged
[1:36:08] hello so now see asked me one time he
[1:36:12] says see Ever Told repeated a scripture
[1:36:15] over and over see it told him something
[1:36:18] that was wrong with them and something
[1:36:20] that they had had done and something
[1:36:22] that they must do and something had to
[1:36:25] happen or something like that see is
[1:36:27] that right so so is speaking in tongues
[1:36:30] and
[1:36:31] interpretation if there's one in the
[1:36:33] church that speaks with tongues and
[1:36:35] another interpret it let let it say this
[1:36:38] let brother Neville raise up and speak
[1:36:39] with tongues and this brother here give
[1:36:41] the interpretation say tell this man
[1:36:43] that yesterday he went out here and done
[1:36:45] something wrong that that you done see
[1:36:47] and and now the doctor told him he had
[1:36:50] cancer go make that thing right come
[1:36:53] back here and get right with God and
[1:36:55] then the man would say truly that's the
[1:36:59] truth then you know God's with
[1:37:02] you that's what gives her for is to make
[1:37:06] the presence of God
[1:37:09] known then you know well then then when
[1:37:13] it's so precise and so directly then you
[1:37:16] can judge it that's right that's right
[1:37:20] on is that
[1:37:22] right if I you know if if I go you know
[1:37:27] the prophecy Goes Forth and and here's
[1:37:29] the way it should
[1:37:31] be is that the prophecy Goes Forth and
[1:37:34] we just called you know brother Doug for
[1:37:36] example you know and not let you done
[1:37:38] anything okay but but but you go and and
[1:37:41] say you know brother you know brother
[1:37:43] Doug y I say to you that a week ago you
[1:37:46] were out in the bar drinking and you had
[1:37:48] your arms around a uh uh 21 Oney old
[1:37:51] girl and and and You' done this and this
[1:37:54] and this and and you need to go make
[1:37:57] that right now that is so
[1:38:00] precise that he can say yes that that is
[1:38:03] true or that no it
[1:38:05] isn't am it it has to be
[1:38:08] judged ain't that right actually brother
[1:38:11] Brown said it has to be judged before
[1:38:13] even the church receives it
[1:38:16] right but it's in the
[1:38:19] body right why not to magnify the
[1:38:24] individual that's doing the prophecy or
[1:38:27] the interpretation that's right is to
[1:38:30] let the people know that God's with
[1:38:32] them can you say Amen so then a gift
[1:38:36] must not be operated in the wrong way or
[1:38:39] used for the wrong
[1:38:42] purposes for it will cause
[1:38:45] confusion well you know 1 Corinthians
[1:38:48] 14:23 tells us that God is not the the
[1:38:51] author of confusion ain't that right so
[1:38:53] then if a gift is m is to make the
[1:38:56] presence of God known then it must be
[1:38:59] used according to Bible Doctrine so as
[1:39:02] not to bring confusion if it brings
[1:39:06] confusion and God is not the author of
[1:39:08] confusion then you're not declaring the
[1:39:11] presence of God among
[1:39:15] you ain't that right and that that
[1:39:19] that's the same way from from any
[1:39:21] anything any gift see so Babylon is
[1:39:24] confusion ain't that right so when there
[1:39:27] is confusion people don't know what to
[1:39:28] do people don't know what to believe
[1:39:31] people don't know where to go PE PE
[1:39:34] people don't know where you know God is
[1:39:36] really moving see they they don't know
[1:39:39] what signs to believe in they they don't
[1:39:41] know what preacher to listen to they
[1:39:43] they don't know whether they should
[1:39:44] believe in gifts or not they they it's
[1:39:47] it's a mass
[1:39:49] confusion well God did not send this
[1:39:52] message to bring
[1:39:55] confusion can you say Amen it it's not
[1:39:58] and so uh uh when it's in the body there
[1:40:02] should not be that confusion well
[1:40:04] brother BR said Satan throws confusion
[1:40:06] upon the people to keep them from having
[1:40:10] faith to keep them from having faith so
[1:40:14] now we've been chopped out of Babylon
[1:40:16] aren't you glad for that by the word of
[1:40:19] the Lord and and why we been chopped out
[1:40:22] to be part of this body because God
[1:40:25] promised that he would get a people out
[1:40:26] of the Gentiles for his name's sake for
[1:40:28] that bride and it's in this day that God
[1:40:31] has chopped out a people chopped out you
[1:40:33] and I get us away conf from all the
[1:40:36] confusion and and and well he said and
[1:40:39] she said and this said and and and we
[1:40:41] don't know what to believe you know I'm
[1:40:43] so glad the prophets settles
[1:40:46] [Applause]
[1:40:47] it whether we should have a beard or not
[1:40:52] whether we should have open toe shoes or
[1:40:54] not whether whe whether you know he even
[1:40:58] got to settled to where whe whether we
[1:41:00] should have women should have braided
[1:41:01] hair or not if it was okay or not you
[1:41:05] got one one you know here a while back
[1:41:08] that said well you know told his church
[1:41:10] you can't have braided hair that's sign
[1:41:12] of
[1:41:13] prostitution go back to what a prophet
[1:41:15] said he said that don't that that ain't
[1:41:17] anything for today but all of a sudden
[1:41:20] you listening to this you start
[1:41:22] listening to that you start listening to
[1:41:23] that you start listening to that start
[1:41:25] and before you anoint you're back into
[1:41:27] confusion can you say Amen see so so
[1:41:31] then then but God would send a prophet
[1:41:33] to chop us out of Babylon yes sir ain't
[1:41:37] that right to be part of this body and
[1:41:40] then why are we part of this body
[1:41:43] because we are called to show to the
[1:41:45] world that Jesus Christ is here he is
[1:41:49] among the people on this Earth they're
[1:41:52] saying he's dead but God's got a people
[1:41:55] on this earth that is part of his body
[1:41:57] that he has tacing in that body
[1:42:00] declaring that no he's not dead he is
[1:42:03] the same yesterday today and
[1:42:07] forever ain't that right so as members
[1:42:11] of the body of Christ we are messengers
[1:42:14] brother BR said you are a messenger this
[1:42:16] morning you are a messenger of good news
[1:42:18] or a messenger of bad news and he said
[1:42:21] isn't it beautiful to know that we are
[1:42:23] ambassadors that we are angels The
[1:42:25] Messengers of the
[1:42:28] Resurrection what are we messengers of
[1:42:30] the
[1:42:31] Resurrection ain't that right now if you
[1:42:33] got a Ministry outside outside the body
[1:42:36] you'll never Proclaim amen it'll never
[1:42:39] manifest that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:42:41] yesterday today and forever it usually
[1:42:44] exalts the
[1:42:46] individual ain't that right big Ministry
[1:42:49] listen to me it's all about me right big
[1:42:53] name big this big that and usually it's
[1:42:56] a denomination that support in words
[1:42:58] something this and something that and
[1:42:59] they're denying uh uh that God is has
[1:43:02] sent a prophet they're denying the
[1:43:04] resurrection that has happened in this
[1:43:06] age can you say Amen but God has
[1:43:10] preserved a people ordained them to his
[1:43:14] body that he can in Tabernacle with and
[1:43:17] dwell in Amen to show to the world amen
[1:43:21] we are messengers brother Bram said we
[1:43:23] are God's Messengers to the sinful world
[1:43:25] that Christ lives so are we Messengers
[1:43:29] to the world that Christ lived 2,000
[1:43:31] years ago so are we going to give them a
[1:43:33] history lesson of of what happened and
[1:43:36] every Easter is our best sermons because
[1:43:38] we can sure point it and tell the people
[1:43:41] what happened 2,000 years ago and if we
[1:43:44] can't get that over then we'll have
[1:43:45] Easter Plays and and yada yada yada I I
[1:43:48] don't think that God put put us as his
[1:43:52] body for this day to give the world a
[1:43:55] history lesson of what he used to be but
[1:43:58] notice brother brand said we are God's
[1:44:00] Messengers to this sinful world that
[1:44:02] Christ lives in our Spirits he lives in
[1:44:05] our hearts he lives he brings us from
[1:44:08] the low debok life of sin and exalts us
[1:44:12] up and gives us a Hallelujah in our soul
[1:44:15] and makes us new cre uh new creatures we
[1:44:18] are messengers angels of the
[1:44:22] Covenant we are we're part of that
[1:44:28] body Hallelujah now John
[1:44:32] 14:17 we've read this many times but
[1:44:35] it's our scripture even the spirit of
[1:44:37] Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:44:39] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:44:43] him so you you have a total different
[1:44:47] relationship uh with Christ and the the
[1:44:49] church average church
[1:44:51] member because you're part of the
[1:44:54] body he's in the body right you see him
[1:44:58] in a different way than what the world
[1:44:59] sees him as see so so he says see
[1:45:04] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:45:06] he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:45:09] you see he was dwelling with him now but
[1:45:12] he said he'll come and he'll be in you I
[1:45:15] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:45:17] come to you yet a little world the while
[1:45:19] the world see me no more but you see me
[1:45:21] because I live you shall
[1:45:24] live and at that day and we all know the
[1:45:27] prophet said this day you shall know
[1:45:30] that I'm in my father you in me and I in
[1:45:33] you where's he at in his
[1:45:37] [Applause]
[1:45:39] body man he lives forever
[1:45:42] more he lives forever
[1:45:45] more and notice this recognition of him
[1:45:49] being in the father and we in him and he
[1:45:51] and US did not come in the Pentecostal
[1:45:55] age and yet they had the gifts in
[1:45:58] operation they shouted dance wrote on
[1:46:00] the floor prophesied but notice they
[1:46:03] misused the gifts speaking in tongues
[1:46:07] brother brah said and just fly loose any
[1:46:10] time and he says notice and he's talking
[1:46:13] about the gift of healing just healing
[1:46:16] he says healing is a marvelous thing but
[1:46:18] if it's misused placed in the wrong
[1:46:20] position I then it becomes a reproach
[1:46:22] and he said all other gifts are the same
[1:46:26] but put it in its place and let it be
[1:46:29] used exactly everybody say exactly the
[1:46:32] way God intended it to be it'll bring
[1:46:35] down the power and the blessings of God
[1:46:38] but out of place out of place that gift
[1:46:40] out of place that Ministry out of place
[1:46:43] it'll cause
[1:46:46] confusion this is why God sent to us a
[1:46:54] stonemason cuz brother Bram said what
[1:46:56] good is a stone if there isn't a
[1:46:58] stonemason to shape him into a Son of
[1:47:02] God you're just piling a bunch of
[1:47:08] rocks he said is that right it isn't
[1:47:10] doing a bit of good see the water wearth
[1:47:13] away the stone that's right that's the
[1:47:16] people see what good is Stones if you
[1:47:19] haven't got a True Stone Mason with a
[1:47:22] good sharp tool to shape him into The
[1:47:25] Fitting Place in the house of God just
[1:47:28] want to ask you what's good the decision
[1:47:31] what what good you putting your name on
[1:47:33] the book what good is it to come join
[1:47:35] the church if the stone Mason isn't
[1:47:37] there that'll shape that and make them
[1:47:39] quit this and that and cut them and make
[1:47:42] them over this way and square them up
[1:47:44] and make them like Christians that sits
[1:47:46] in the house of God with signs following
[1:47:48] the Believers what what good would it be
[1:47:51] to have gifts and to be a gifted person
[1:47:53] if there wasn't a stonemason to shape
[1:47:56] us we've seen it we've seen guys
[1:48:00] preachers come through great
[1:48:04] gifts but it's just po
[1:48:09] rocks see he said now that's the end
[1:48:12] time evangelism is taking the stones and
[1:48:14] shaping them what good would the stones
[1:48:16] be if you just pile them let them lay
[1:48:19] where they're at might a little better
[1:48:20] out there then they would pile them up
[1:48:24] together see they might be needed out
[1:48:26] there and none of them out out there see
[1:48:28] so that's right he said see stone is no
[1:48:31] good without a stone Mason Jesus counts
[1:48:34] characters not members you know that he
[1:48:37] counts characters God has always tried
[1:48:39] to get one man in his hand that's all he
[1:48:41] needs is one man and he'll do his work
[1:48:44] through the years just think he can only
[1:48:47] find one righteous man in the time of
[1:48:49] Noah the time of Moses he only found one
[1:48:52] righteous man ain't that right and in
[1:48:55] this day in this day when Time and
[1:48:57] Eternity is blending together they're
[1:49:01] they're blending now God has a handful
[1:49:04] of people brother BR said that Bride is
[1:49:07] a
[1:49:07] minority very few but but he's got her
[1:49:11] in his hand and he's able to work his
[1:49:15] ministry still yet through that group of
[1:49:18] people do you believe that yes do you
[1:49:21] love the
[1:49:22] Lord even though mortal people make up
[1:49:26] this body the ministry and the operation
[1:49:29] of this body is the working of the Holy
[1:49:32] Spirit brother Ram says see God doesn't
[1:49:34] fall on denominations he doesn't fall
[1:49:36] upon man uh Mechanical Devices but in
[1:49:40] the form of the Holy Spirit God fell
[1:49:43] upon
[1:49:44] men right so then then then what what
[1:49:49] Ministry is is that not only are you a
[1:49:52] Son of God but now you become a servant
[1:49:56] of God a servant see and you cannot be
[1:50:00] part of ministry without being a servant
[1:50:03] even Jesus says there in Mark 10:43 I
[1:50:06] didn't I don't think I gave this to you
[1:50:08] uh uh brother Matt but uh whosoever will
[1:50:10] be great among you shall be your
[1:50:13] minister and whosoever of you will be
[1:50:16] the chiefest shall be servant of all for
[1:50:19] even the son of of men came not to be
[1:50:21] ministered unto but to minister and to
[1:50:23] give his life a ransom for many ain't
[1:50:27] that right so he's got to be a servant
[1:50:30] amen any any individual that is part of
[1:50:34] the body amen has to be a servant amen
[1:50:37] the heart of a servant a uh uh there and
[1:50:41] and and because you know you can say
[1:50:42] well I'm a son I'm I'm a daughter I'm
[1:50:44] bless God praise the Lord but if you
[1:50:46] ain't got a servant's heart then then
[1:50:48] you'll not be for Ministry ain't that
[1:50:51] right amen and we'll get into it more
[1:50:53] later on but see so so servant amen it's
[1:50:56] it's not a servant of the people but
[1:51:00] it's a servant of God not a servant of
[1:51:04] people a servant of God not yield it to
[1:51:08] the people that's not what God wants in
[1:51:10] a servant not yield it to the people but
[1:51:13] yield it to
[1:51:15] God hello well sure you can do all kinds
[1:51:19] of stuff for people and not be yielded
[1:51:21] of God then everything that you do is no
[1:51:25] good because everything that we're doing
[1:51:27] is counting for
[1:51:29] eternity we want
[1:51:32] eternity we we want people to be brought
[1:51:35] into the kingdom we're working for the
[1:51:37] kingdom can you say Amen so so the
[1:51:41] ministry in the body is Anointed with
[1:51:44] the Holy
[1:51:45] Spirit and and and and again that means
[1:51:48] that every member every member no matter
[1:51:50] how great from the pulpit all the way
[1:51:52] down has to be anointed or under the
[1:51:56] control of the Holy
[1:51:58] Spirit ministers amen Ministry in the
[1:52:02] body right every member now notice 1
[1:52:04] Corinthians 6:19 know ye not that your
[1:52:06] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:08] which is in you which you have of God
[1:52:10] and you are not your own you are bought
[1:52:14] with a price therefore glorify God in
[1:52:16] your body and in your spirit which are
[1:52:19] God's
[1:52:20] ain't that right so so you if you're a
[1:52:23] part of the body amen then then your
[1:52:25] plans don't count it's God's
[1:52:29] plans your dreams don't count it's God's
[1:52:34] dreams can you say Amen your goals don't
[1:52:37] count it's God's
[1:52:40] goals ain't that right notice First
[1:52:43] Corinthians 3:16 know ye not that you
[1:52:45] are the temple of God and that the
[1:52:47] spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man
[1:52:49] defile the temple of God him shall God
[1:52:51] destroy for the temple of God is Holy
[1:52:54] which Temple you are ain't that right so
[1:52:58] here just a few more minutes now but man
[1:53:01] being God's agent does not do away with
[1:53:07] the the ministry of the Holy Spirit and
[1:53:11] and the agency see you know Jesus was
[1:53:14] God's agent as we had said before and
[1:53:16] yet the spirit of God anoint wanted him
[1:53:21] and worked through him do you believe
[1:53:24] that Bible says that as Jesus was coming
[1:53:27] out of the water amen that John saw the
[1:53:30] spirit of God descending upon him as
[1:53:33] like unto a dove ain't that right the
[1:53:35] heavens of God open and Luke 3:20 and
[1:53:38] the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily
[1:53:40] shape uh like a dove upon him and a
[1:53:43] voice Came From Heaven which said Thou
[1:53:46] Art my beloved Son in thee I am well
[1:53:49] pleased
[1:53:50] brother Brown said the original
[1:53:51] translation says in whom I am pleased to
[1:53:55] dwell in so here was Jesus Christ God's
[1:53:59] agent and we think oh he's the
[1:54:01] predestinated to be the Redeemer he's
[1:54:03] predestinated to do what he was oh
[1:54:05] praise God glory to God but he had to be
[1:54:08] anointed for
[1:54:13] this and according to scripture that as
[1:54:17] soon as he left there the holy Spirit
[1:54:20] led him into the Wilderness to be
[1:54:22] tempted of the devil
[1:54:26] LED so he was the son of God and was a
[1:54:30] man human flesh yet he was on Earth to
[1:54:35] do nothing but the will of the father
[1:54:39] ain't that right but he couldn't do it
[1:54:41] on his own notice in in Luke 4:18 the
[1:54:45] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:54:47] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:54:49] the poor Heath sent me to heal the
[1:54:50] brokenhearted he to preach Deliverance
[1:54:52] to the captives recovering of sight to
[1:54:54] the blind to set at Liberty to them that
[1:54:55] are bruised to preach the acceptable of
[1:54:57] the year of the Lord he was he was to do
[1:54:59] these things it was predestinated for
[1:55:01] him to do these things but he had to be
[1:55:04] anointed by the spirit of God to do it
[1:55:07] in Acts 10:38 it says God anointed Jesus
[1:55:10] of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:55:13] power who went about doing good healing
[1:55:16] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[1:55:18] God was with him ain't that right so
[1:55:23] here here he was and and yet yet being
[1:55:26] the Redeemer being predestinated to be
[1:55:28] that lamb before the foundation of the
[1:55:29] world yet he could do absolutely nothing
[1:55:32] unless the father showed him first for
[1:55:35] he says that John 5:19 the son can do
[1:55:38] nothing of himself but what he seeth the
[1:55:40] father do for what things soever he
[1:55:42] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[1:55:46] ain't that right so now not not not
[1:55:49] trying trying to diminish who Jesus
[1:55:51] Christ was in any way amen but just to
[1:55:54] show you what I'm getting at Jesus was a
[1:55:58] man couldn't have died unless he was a
[1:56:01] man he died as a man he hungered as a
[1:56:03] man he cried as a man he wept as a man
[1:56:06] he he and and and weary as a man and as
[1:56:09] a man he was even Limited in his
[1:56:17] knowledge think of it the Bible says
[1:56:19] that when the woman with the issue of
[1:56:20] blood touched
[1:56:22] him he didn't go right to her and say
[1:56:25] ah he said who's touched
[1:56:27] me then he began to look around finding
[1:56:31] out and Peter I think it was Peter that
[1:56:33] rebuked him said what what do you mean
[1:56:35] who touched you we're trying to keep
[1:56:37] everybody off of
[1:56:41] you he wouldn't have even went to
[1:56:43] Lazarus
[1:56:45] grave if the father hadn't showed him
[1:56:48] first that Lazarus was going to raise
[1:56:50] from the
[1:56:51] dead ain't that right even the disciples
[1:56:55] asked him to let let Let Them Sit uh I
[1:56:57] think it was James and John maybe let
[1:57:00] them sit on his right hand one on the
[1:57:02] right and one on his left they wanted to
[1:57:04] sit with him you know and and notice
[1:57:07] what Jesus said it is not mine to give
[1:57:10] but it shall be given to them for whom
[1:57:12] it is prepared of my father so see he
[1:57:17] being God's agent was totally
[1:57:21] dependent upon the
[1:57:25] father can you say Amen had to be led of
[1:57:29] the Father John 8:28 it says then Jesus
[1:57:32] say unto them when you have lifted up
[1:57:35] the son of man then you shall know that
[1:57:37] I am he and that I do nothing of myself
[1:57:40] but as my father hath taught me I speak
[1:57:42] these things and he that sent me is with
[1:57:46] me the father hath not left me alone for
[1:57:49] I always do those things that please him
[1:57:52] and because of this he manifested
[1:57:57] God you with
[1:57:59] me I I I I want to say this as we
[1:58:05] close his life was
[1:58:10] disciplined yes sir he disciplined
[1:58:13] himself to the father's
[1:58:18] will he didn't say well you know the
[1:58:20] spirit of God's on me I now he knew what
[1:58:22] he was brother brand says that he knew
[1:58:25] he knew he was Messiah he knew he he
[1:58:28] even said all all all power in Heaven
[1:58:29] and Earth is given unto me but with that
[1:58:33] he disciplined himself he could have
[1:58:36] said well I'm going to go empty all the
[1:58:37] hospitals in I'm going to go out and do
[1:58:39] this and I'm going to go out and do this
[1:58:41] and and and and in a lot of cases if it
[1:58:43] was like us when when they would have
[1:58:45] came uh uh to to to crucify him I mean
[1:58:48] even him in the garden was asking the
[1:58:50] father to let this thing pass from him
[1:58:53] keep me from this ain't that right but
[1:58:56] nevertheless thy will be done he was
[1:58:58] able to discipline himself to the will
[1:59:01] of the father he said I could have
[1:59:03] called to 12 Legions of angels and the
[1:59:05] father would have heard me he had the
[1:59:07] power to do it but he didn't use that
[1:59:10] power to do that he used that power Amen
[1:59:13] to be disciplined to the father's
[1:59:18] will well that's what the ministry in
[1:59:20] the body is doing it's a discipline
[1:59:23] Ministry there is a people that is
[1:59:25] disciplining
[1:59:28] themselves well I'm a Son of God I'm a
[1:59:30] daughter of God bless God that we just
[1:59:32] go do anything live any old way act any
[1:59:34] old way it ain't
[1:59:36] happening not in the
[1:59:43] body you say
[1:59:47] Amen John 3 and 2 it says the same came
[1:59:50] to Jesus by night and said unto him
[1:59:52] Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher
[1:59:55] come from God for no man no man can do
[1:59:58] these Miracles that thou doest except
[2:00:01] God be with him he was so disciplined
[2:00:05] his life was a life of discipline not
[2:00:09] legalistic
[2:00:11] discipline to walk the father's
[2:00:14] will that's
[2:00:16] right to where that the people could see
[2:00:20] God in
[2:00:23] him you say
[2:00:25] Amen in John 14:14 Jesus said the father
[2:00:29] that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[2:00:32] works so then if you if you look on the
[2:00:37] day of Pentecost God planted a
[2:00:39] Pentecostal
[2:00:41] seed and the Church of the Living God
[2:00:44] was birthed into existence on that day
[2:00:46] there was 120 people that were in in the
[2:00:49] upper room they were scared for their
[2:00:51] lives they were trembling didn't know
[2:00:52] what to
[2:00:53] do and Peter the one that denied Christ
[2:00:58] three times was among them he hadn't
[2:01:01] changed just too
[2:01:03] much and yet he was there he was
[2:01:07] scared and but notice what Jesus would
[2:01:10] tell
[2:01:11] them after he raised from the dead he
[2:01:14] was fixing to ascend into heaven and
[2:01:17] here he talks to his disciples Luke
[2:01:19] 24:49 behold I send the promise of my
[2:01:22] father upon you but T ye in the city of
[2:01:27] Jerusalem T ye in the city of Jerusalem
[2:01:30] till you be endued with power from on
[2:01:33] high ain't that right they were not to
[2:01:37] preach they were not to go out and hold
[2:01:40] revivals they were not to go out and
[2:01:41] hold healing
[2:01:43] campaigns they were not to go out and
[2:01:45] cast out Devils he didn't want them
[2:01:47] going out and prophesying and give an
[2:01:49] interpretation of Prophecy and
[2:01:52] tongues you didn't want them trying to
[2:01:54] be the the deacons and this and that
[2:01:58] everything else he didn't want them to
[2:02:00] have a
[2:02:02] Ministry until they were ued with power
[2:02:06] from on
[2:02:10] high ain't that
[2:02:13] right why why why why did they have to
[2:02:17] wait why because Judas Judas proved that
[2:02:21] a man can do all of that he could cast
[2:02:24] out Devils he could heal the sick he
[2:02:26] could work signs and wonders he could
[2:02:28] perform
[2:02:30] Miracles he he proved it and still
[2:02:33] betray our
[2:02:34] Lord still be a devil can you say amen
[2:02:38] he done it all without having the Holy
[2:02:40] Ghost but Jesus tells them in why in
[2:02:44] Acts 1 and8 you shall receive power
[2:02:47] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:02:49] you and you shall be
[2:02:51] Witnesses unto me can you say Amen see a
[2:02:56] man can hold healing campaigns without
[2:02:59] having the Holy Ghost you can prophesy
[2:03:01] and have the interpretation of tongues
[2:03:03] see dreams Visions preach cast out
[2:03:05] devils and still not be a witness of
[2:03:08] Christ but when a man is baptized into
[2:03:12] the body by the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:14] Ghost he becomes a
[2:03:17] witness of Christ
[2:03:20] ain't that right he becomes a
[2:03:23] witness his life is changed his motives
[2:03:27] are
[2:03:30] different amen you love the
[2:03:32] Lord if the musicians will
[2:03:41] come true
[2:03:45] Ministry Works within the body of
[2:03:53] Christ true
[2:03:55] gifts work within the body are are
[2:04:00] effective and when I say
[2:04:04] effective effective toward God's
[2:04:07] purpose within the body of
[2:04:11] Christ
[2:04:13] amen you glad you're part of that

[2:20:29] if you get to Clay Street you're on

[2:20:50] amen hope you don't get lost but if you
[2:20:52] do it's easy to find call the police
[2:20:56] station 911 might be good get you there

[2:21:04] to the
