um sister Rhonda's not feeling well I guess Britney's probably not feeling well either she's still not here um so we need to keep them in prayer and brother Amos if you would come and take these before the Lord [Music] let's remember these in prayer Our precious Heavenly Father God lord as we approach your throne of grace and mercy we're thankful Lord Jesus every time you heal our bodies oh God and Lord I can it's almost incalculable Lord for me to even come up with a number how many times I have been healed in my lifetime father God there's no way that we could even try to figure it out we've been touched by your hand so many times father God and Lord many times probably we didn't even know it we didn't know it there was a foreign enemy an infection that was uh or disease or something that tried to encroach and sneak into our bodies but dear God you you stopped it dead in its tracks as only you can do we thank you for those things we thank you Lord God for Lord times that we were diagnosed with this or diagnosed with that and you healed us Lord God we don't give you enough of thanks for that I know we don't Lord father God this time we just want to thank you for that we thank you for every broken bone every torn muscle every torn cartilage every God we heal back up again why because you're the Healer every time we cut ourselves Lord for the time we had had brushed knees rolling off that first bicycle accident oh God and Stones hanging out of our skin Lord and pain that we experience Lord you healed it all it all goes back to you Lord we we just we can't thank you enough Lord thank you Jesus thank you Lord people Lord we don't ever want to become callous Lord that we become so technical about things dear God that we can't see your hand of Deliverance of healing Lord whatever in our lives oh God over and over the about you said in your word in the psalmist Lord that day on the day utter a speech Lord there's something to say about every day of our existence on this planet dear God we're grateful for that Lord and you see the ones that's been out sick Lord and sister Lisa my own wife not feeling well today God these others Lord that was mentioned here that are out tonight Lord God not feeling well Lord we've never seen a time when the devil has certainly tried to attack the human body the uh the houses of the Believers to try to distract us to try to get us uh uh sideways or try to get us to not fulfill the perfect will of God lord if there's any of us here Lord he wish he could take our lives oh God so that we couldn't so that God's plan uh per a perfect will could not be would not be performed in our lives he'd do it but dear God we thank you for your protecting hand Lord God we thank you that until our purposes serve we won't leave here so God tonight we want to remember our pastor Lord in prayer remember those in foreign lands I think dear God that brother that told me Lord we we take this heated air conditioned building Lord for granted too many times when people because of the law and the religion of the land they can't even meet in a public place of worship they've got to meet in homes because the religion that's predominant will not allow open Christian worship Lord God we're thankful God that we have that freedom here we pray for those Believers in those lands sometimes have to take secondary jobs dear God because they the the the religious uh majority of that Nation Lord will only allow their people to hold a higher paying jobs and Christians and and others minorities have to take what's left God we pray that you would bless your children Lord in every place in every continent Lord regardless of the political Lord the Demonic uh government that may be in place you can make a way where there seems to be no way we ask for deliverance tonight for those who are oppressed or even possessed of the Devil family members oh God we know that demonic possession Lord and oppression is going on all around us but dear God we are the ambassadors of deliverance we are your hand at work we are your right hand of authority here on this Earth and we bind the powers of the Demon Lord that would try to hinder us it with unbelief Lord and whatever dear God it's just a devil as we always Lord need to realize that it's our not our brother or sister but it's the devil we ask your blessing over the

unending yes never failing and we love the Lord amen uh the musicians can be dismissed and it's uh just good to be in the house of the Lord trust everyone had a u good afternoon amen e e and they have received them and I come to thee Holy Father keep name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that that the scripture might be fulfilled and we know he's speaking of Judas and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in them I have given them Thy word and the world that hated them uh hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but thou that thou shouldest keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is true as thou H has sent me into the world so uh even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou Hast sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou and me that the they may me perfect made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou Hast loved me amen let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus what a prayer that was prayed there Lord on our behalf father Lord you you desire to to bring us into a Oneness and father we're your people and as much as you prayed and and that desire was there so is it that we pray with the same passion the same desire father that you make us one oh God I pray Lord that the word will be effective to us tonight and that you'd give me the words to say father anoint both speaker and hearer may you have preeminence in this place tonight is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen you can have your seats again I'm going to use the title The Oneness of God in the body of Christ and this this prayer that Jesus prayed is is so profound amen when we really think of what what is being said and of course he's praying for a certain group and that that people was the fathers in the beginning and was given to him and he says I've kept them and I've given them Thy word and they have received it and I you know as I've stated before I believe that this prayer is is really a pro prophetic of of our day and uh this Oneness uh existed between Jesus and the father for Jesus said the father and I are are one and the bride of Christ today is to manifest that same Oneness amen now Jesus for one he knew that he and the father were one he he was aware of that there was no questions about it I mean this is what he's saying in the prayer and this prayer is not question marks it's it's statements make them one as I you and I are one and I I think that this bride is not going to be one without her knowing it but she she is becoming fully aware of her relationship uh with with Christ amen and and so this Oneness is to occur in this age for John 14:20 Jesus said at that day you shall know that I am in my father you and me and I in you amen now I wasn't able to give you the scriptures uh uh brother Matthew so you forgive me uh there but brother brandham says that this that that scripture is to be for today at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you and as we said last Sunday night that this kind of Oneness cannot exist outside the body of Christ this Oneness must and can only be had by being baptized into the body of Christ to have this kind of Oneness now brother brandom talks about a person uh being being Having the Holy Ghost and he said this is the evidence of it he said make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way amen he will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost so so that's why there cannot be a Oneness without uh uh being baptized into to the body of Christ as we know as message Believers there was a Oneness uh that existed in the garden man and God was one yes man and his wife was one and because of this Oneness there was a fellowship man had fellowship with God and and what a what an honor that must have been in that time to to have have such a fellowship with God but we're even to have a greater fellowship with God Amen Adam Adam fellowship with God but he never knew God the way we know him never never knew God in in in his Saving Grace never knew God as as one that could pick up and and and fully restore but we are that that people that truly not and and and and and this is just my thoughts about it but I don't know I don't I'll just put it this way I don't know if Adam just truly understood God's mind all the way the way we understand it and and I'm I'm going to say I don't think he did because uh the Mysteries that have been revealed today has been hidden in the mind of God from the foundation of the world so then you know what what uh Oneness that Adam had I I truly believe that we we've come into a greater Oneness than even that but man and God was one and because of this they had the fellowship as we have said before that man was made to achieve for God but but he could only do that when he was one with God and so when he broke that Oneness with God then then he he become a failure and he he just well all of us were were uh born failures because we we were born the wrong way and and and so when we had that that rebirth that new birth then we begin to find our identity not in the world but find our identity in God and and then we find that that that we begin to come to our true purpose and and that's when we begin to really be able to achieve because we come back into fellowship with God but it takes a Oneness in order to achieve and and uh you know brother brandham uses the example of a watch and and how that uh every part of that watch has to to work in Harmony in order to for that watch to to really keep perfect time see uh uh but but when when everything about this watch wants to work uh something contrary to uh and each element or each piece of the watch you know begins to do its own thing then the watch has no reason for existence ain't that right see we got we got to watch to keep time but if the watch won't work if if everything about that watch that makes the watch just wants to do its own thing then why what's the point of having a watch and so is it in in this day like brother Braham said he said no matter how good the jewels are on watch it's got to keep in perfect time or It's Made In Vain and if the church isn't unified then it exists in vain if the church is not achieving what God has ordained it to be then it's not in vain now do you think God will start a church and promise to build a church only for it to be in vain God you know if if if man can make a watch to make it work and all the time pieces work to where we can actually keep time with it then surely God knows how to do a church for it to uh uh uh to to bring it into Oneness you believe that so then brother brand says see God's purpose is for us to unify together and be one but but true oness is only when we become one with the word because what good is Oneness if we have no fellowship with God right amen what what good is Oneness when God doesn't approve of it true and and so now Satan is not against Oneness now now we surely all know that anything that Satan has something to do with one thing he's going to do is he's going to try to bring a Oneness it's just that way uh you get a person disgruntled in a church that person cannot stay disgruntled by himself he just can't he's anointed and so what he does is he tries to bring as many as possible to be disgruntled with him because it's no good standing alone being disgruntled when everybody else is in unity so but that's that's just the way it is he knows the power that Oneness has and but it's it's as we know it's it's a perverted Oneness now we talked about it last uh Sunday evening but the Tower of Babel is a great example of Satan's Oneness Genesis 11:1 the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech the third verse and they said to one another go to let us make brick burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime and had they uh had they for Mortar and they said go to let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth sixth verse it says and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they began to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do so it it it truly is an example of Oneness and what they are was able to achieve by Oneness but it was the wrong Oneness because it was against God's word it God they did not confer with God they they did not seek his will they did not receive instructions from God it was a Oneness that was inspired of the devil and and so uh uh uh this kind of Oneness U was was a carnal man with a carnal mind trying to uh achieve a carnal thing and and and all that Oneness they were against God's plan against God's word against his his uh his uh uh uh purpose so then uh uh it's carnal unregenerate man coming together in Oneness and then we see what happens well if there's ever a time that man is becoming one it's it's in this age brother brandham said the Tower of Babel in that day speaks of this ecclesiastical world in the last days which is now right now and he says they will finally unite under the Antichrist a man-made religion so the world is uniting whether we see it or not it is uniting they're coming together laws are being P things behind the scene uh that you know it's it's happening very rapid and one of these days it's going to happen and it's going to manifest itself and and and it it'll be just like that but it's already happening under cover the man the prophet said the man-made religions will all come into this Antichrist religion there will be two forms of them one form will come from Rome which will be the Beast and there is an image unto the Beast which will be the ecclesiastical head of the Protestant Church Heap up as an image unto the Beast under the denominational world and it'll all everybody say all come under one great dominion and the Antichrist will be the one that's enthroned and seated see anti anti means against see almost exactly alike but yet his teaching isn't from the scriptures enough of the scriptures he's got enough of the scriptures to make it look like it's right but it's wrong amen see and and so uh it's not it's not the people in denominations that we speak against when we talk of denominations and so you must understand that it's the system of denominations that's got the people bound and and blind and and and the people you you I feel sorry for them and I I wish to God that we could reach every individual that we could to show them the truth sure and and because it's it's happening and and the people are being sucked into it left and right and so because it's a great deception but but we see just in this day like the United Nations you know they they they're trying their best to bring all nations together that's this you know that's really why they were established they're trying to bring a Oneness by TR Trying by bringing all the nations into one great big Brotherhood the prophet said it's a Brotherhood under a United power but it's not working is it it it it can't work but yet it's it's it's it's Satan trying to bring everything under a power brother BM talked about Russia we know Russia is a communist country and he said now Russia's got a false Pentecost and he said uh uh in in other words they're trying to force all men to communist they're trying to bring everybody under that that communist uh um uh government or or whatever but it's a work of the devil and so brother brandom called it a false communist and and and see to where every man has all things in common now Isaiah 54:15 uh God saying behold they shall surely gather together but not by me they'll come into a Oneness there'll be an assembly but it won't be by me see and whosoever Shall Gather together against thee so now think of this Gathering it's it's it's the purpose of this Gathering is against God ain't that right you'll either gather for God or you gather against God but you will not you cannot remain in the middle that's right and and so this Gathering they're going to gather but it's not by me but notice the reason whosoever Shall Gather against thee shall fall for thy sake see so so and and he's who who shall ever that the Gathering against the children of God is is is basically what he's talking about whether it was Israel or whether it's the bride or whatever it's it's it's there's always been a bitterness a hatred be uh uh against the the true seed of God but thinking of this Oneness uh a false uh Pentecost and and things there was a Oneness at Pentecost and and Acts 2 and 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all everybody say all with one Accord in one place amen the 44th verse uh of the second chapter and all that believed were together and had all things in common so that's what Russia is trying to do under communism that's what social all these things they're trying to bring everything where all men have things in common but it's under a false Pentecost but this was a true Pentecost and it brought all things in common it brought the people together the elect uh uh acts 4:32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart of one Soul neither said any of them that ought of uh of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common ain't that right so Satan is is trying to have the Oneness that they had at Pentecost without having the Pentecostal experience no wonder brother brandom kept hollering and and and and and telling us and crying out go back to Pentecost go back to Pentecost go back to Pentecost what is he saying not to go back into an upper room you know and and I know the word it's been quoted the Lord knows we believe it that the word at Pentecost don't work for today but you got to go back to Pentecost everybody say you got to go back to Pentecost if you didn't have to go back to Pentecost the prophet wouldn't have said it the same one that said the word won't work at Pentecost for today like it did back is the same one that cried out over and over and over go back to Pentecost why it's the only way you're going to get a Oneness it's the only way that this one between God and and and us and and the church can exist because it's a Pentecostal experience on can you say amen and and so Satan is is got this false Pentecost that he's trying but what is he trying to do he's trying to bring it through force force everything is about Force everything that Satan does force yeah you don't like my way I'll force you to like my way oh if you if you don't live the way I live then I'm going to force you to live the way I live look that the homosexuals ain't happy with us the way we are so what do they want to do they want to make you accept their lifestyle they want to make us teach our children their lifestyle they're not happy with us saying man you're nuts now if they want to F we're nuts we don't go in there and try to make them look you know agree with us you understand you know what I'm saying but Satan will force you to believe the way he wants you to believe they'll take your children away they'll take they're going to they they'll try to close your churches it's it's it's a Oneness through force and Satan has always tried to force the people into a Oneness but God never forces his people together never you see the the people that he's ordained for a Oneness they they were ordained before the foundation of the world and they're the ones that's going to truly unite together and and Pentecost did not come by force but you know how it came them people they God didn't force them together but it come by the life of God quickening the word seed within them the life of God come in them and Quicken that word seed and all of a sudden these people people had all things in common they were together praise the Lord they they come together you understand what I'm saying so this is what God promised through the prophet Joel he says you know acts 2:17 and it shall come to pass in the last day sayith God I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see Visions your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and handmaids I will pour out in those days my of my spirit and they shall prophesy ain't that right but notice Jesus told his disciples beforehand he says now in Luke 24:49 behold I send thee promise now this is what what was promised in Joel in Joel I send the promise of my father upon you but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high ain't that right so they were together in one heart one mind one Accord waiting for this promise to come it was not a force it was a people that wanted to be a part of the promise of God they weren't wrestling with the promise of God they weren't denying the promise of God but but they were earnestly looking for this promise and it and it brought them into one heart one mind one Accord ain't that right see so now denominations are trying to have Unity apart from the word of God and and brother brandom says now the great Harlot of Revelation 17 these balum teachers with their false Doctrine is marrying the church into that kind of a mess see watch when it comes to a showdown at the end time look at the weakness of it now 900 and some different organizations one pulling one way the other pull in this way there's no Unity among them and they're trying to bring Unity but that Unity is not backed by the word of God God's original plan they're taking it in by politics and organization you can't have Oneness among God's people by politics and organization ain't that right amen now just to try to hurry I won't keep you long but we know what broke the Oneness in the Garden of Eden is Eve could not wait we talked about it last Sunday amen God told Eve and Adam Adam told him to multiply replenish the Earth but when Adam came to her he found her with the wrong seed and and she was pregnated corrupted and and things and so she had be been United with something else in in the wrong way and she lusted for knowledge she lusted she wasn't content with the word of God she had the word of God and if she would have stayed with the word of God everything would have worked out just perfect for her but she could not she lusted after knowledge and Satan made sure she got it wrecked her life wrecked wrecked the home wrecked the fellowship wrecked it all ain't that right see she wasn't satisfied with the word the word's got everything that we need it does ain't that right we find out also that Israel was not satisfied with the word and and and that that bride God's Hebrew bride uh uh he found her pregnated with the word and and the prophet said they rejected the leadership of God when they rejected the prophet and wanted a king see so the the word come to a prophet that's how God would rule his people is by the word of God that come to a prophet ain't that right but they rejected God's leadership Samuel thought it was all all about him and he said Lord they rejected me and God says no no no no they didn't reject you they've rejected me that I should not Reign Over them well how would God Reign over them by his word that they wanted to come like everybody else and be United under politics they rejected God's leadership and I I say this that any time a person becomes dissatisfied with the word of God Satan will impregnate them with the wrong seeden do not become s dissatisfied with the word of God ain't that right amen if you are sick tonight be satisfied with the word of God if if you are discouraged and you're at the bottom of the beer be satisfied with the word of God Amen if your marriage has fallen apart be satisfied with the word of God if your children is is gone wavered and and it just seems impossible for them to come back be satisfied with the promise of God be satisfied with the word of God right ain't that right wait wait don't don't get impatient like you did the word will come the word will manifest itself there's power in that word and if he would have just recognized that that there's power oh if she would just waited for that word to come to her but she didn't she got impatient now notice the true bride must be unii unified the prophet said by the word you cannot come in unification outside the word of God ain't that right now that goes for anything if you want your ministry Let It Be unified by the word of God if you want your gifts Let It Be unified by the word of God you you don't want it to prosper when God ain't in it you you you you you don't want something else amen and the glitter and the glamour you don't want promotion of man if God ain't promoting it and I don't want to promote anything if God ain't promoting it you understand what I'm saying the the true bride must be unified by the word of God Amen and the bride of Christ will never unify around anything else but the word of God brother brandham called it assembling together in The Fellowship of the word amen he says the fellowship of the word that's right fellowshipping setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus tonight one Accord one place one Spirit one mind one hope one God one purpose amen there you are every here's the fellowship every time the Bible says anything we say Amen see punctuating every word with amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin we say amen amen can you say Amen see amen everything just amen amen amen right on down see in Fellowship the Lord I'm the god that Health thee of all thy diseases and we say Amen but it may be impossible it may this and the doctor saying this but we stay virtuous to that word come United by the word now now Matthew 24:27 it says for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for where wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together so what brings that Oneness the carcass the revealed word of God the same word that was in the East is now in the west the same son of man the same power the same Jesus Christ in every way is he the same except his Corporal body ain't that right and every elect of God has come in together around this in Oneness it's a Oneness you see then our word the word is our headship now Satan will promote any kind of Oneness when it's apart from the word of God and he's for Oneness so don't don't don't ever think he's not he's for Oneness but he can never bring a pure Oneness but he is for Oneness and and but it's always that Oneness is apart from the word of God uh uh doing something outside the word of God ignoring the word of God half beli in the word of God you know it's it's it's always that way and yet brother brandham said the unity that we're wanting is a spiritual unity and he says see spiritual Unity with his word and with him Unity right so in another place he said the peering of Christ and the coming of Christ see it's two different words altoe Christ is appearing in these last days in his church bringing his church together in unity and faith and Power in the word all together that when he returns he will find the same church amen that's right ain't that right so what is this message doing and remember it's only to the elect now you got all kinds of Isom and schisms in the message you got all kinds of crazy things that that go on in the message it does not take away from the reality of this message because the message is not to bring everyone in unity it's not to bring it all to one great big Brotherhood as as as what they're trying to do in the world Council of churches there's people that's in this message does not want to walk with the word they just don't and how many preachers preach this message like it's a legalist thing forcing the people to operate that's right it's true they can't get them to a real birth so they'll do it they'll do it outwardly then you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this you got to do this and and and in all reality it just brings Hypocrites amen it ain't bringing people into the Fellowship of the word it's not bringing people into fellowship and love to God it's really just bringing hardened heart Hearts where people don't even know how to believe in God they don't even know how to stand in faith on the word of God that's but you talking about holy people you talking about moral people you talk about outward outward appearance people they outshine any day you understand what I'm saying but the Muslims do that you you can't bring people to Christianity by government so this message is a message of grace to the elect amen and and this message see Christ is appearing how many believe that this message is Christ brother bradam he says it he said the message is Christ see why because it's it's Christ manifesting this word right so Christ is appearing in these last days in his church bringing his church his body together in unity and faith and Power in the word all together brother Brandon preached the message leadership I don't know if you've all heard it but if you haven't you really need to listen to it it's not a it's not a in in what we would call a real powerful church service he's I think in a home in there in Prescot he's at a community it's a gan and Leo I think I think that's where it was they had gotten a a a community thing where everybody lived on the the same property and trailers and all that well they've invited brother brandom to come yeah and he's talking to the young people he's talking to a a young generation and and so it sounds like it's just for kids and so he's talking you know but really if if you think of what he's doing he's actually talking to the bride in general and and and so he's speaking that there has to be a leadership come follow me and remember he talks about Christ talking to that Rich Young ruler and and he wanted eternal life how do I get it and he said sell all that thy thou Hast and come and follow me and the Rich Young Ruler could not do that because he had great values and all of this and he couldn't sell all that you know and and so he walked away but there there there was the headship the message the word that that has been restored in this day and now the the the beckoning call was come follow me there is a leadership I know there there's all kinds of men that rises there's all kinds of organizations there's all kinds of things that that draws us to follow and this but now you know I I was talking to uh uh a Judas class online the other day uh uh a Bible study and and I I titled it the the the Vindication has taken away all confusion and and this this leadership the leadership that that we have been given in this day has been it's it's coming from a Vindicated message the message has been so thoroughly Vindicated that there should be not one question about it and here brother Brandon was fixing to go it's it's as it's at the end of his life that he's preaching this message everything all through the years God has Vindicated over and over and over and over now the rest of it is just follow me there is a leadership there is a gathering there is something that we can truly follow and not be misled yes sir the word has been Now set forth It's been thoroughly Vindicated now we are to follow without question can you say amen Amen brother brandham says this in in a couple places but I thought it was profound he said a real believer don't hear nothing everybody say nothing he doesn't hear nothing but the word amen that's that's all he watches the word that's that's that now this is how it's we're coming together now this is what's bringing us in a Unity a gathering that elect is because he watches the word he hears nothing but the word he ain't looking for no loopholes he ain't looking for no gimmicks he just believes God and that settles it and he just keeps going hallu amen that's right yeah amen another place he said the people tried them Pharisees and Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians and all of them tried to cast a shadow in Jesus but then True Believers that was predestinated to hear that message heard it and they seen no fault in it at all he said that's the same now those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see see any heresy they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see Jesus that's all see they're predestinated to eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and stay there you get it that's the only way there can be a Oneness in among the elect is they have come to a place they're not picking this message apart amen yes that's right can you say Amen they're not picking the move of God apart they're not picking God's people apart hello you got quiet on that one but it's the truth you cannot have Oneness until we come to a place that we accept God and his message we we're willing to become one with the message and all these fault finders that are with the people of God that find fault with the people of God hey they find fault with the message too and it's a pure message it it's a perfect message and yet they want to they they they want to tell us all the things that are wrong with it and all that it's nothing but an unbeliever it's just an unbeliever wanting to take us away from the promises of [Applause] God the prophet says they those who believe him love him those who believe him see no fault in him they don't see any her they don't see anything wrong they don't see anything wrong with his word they don't see anything wrong with his people they just see Jesus that's all and see they're predestinated to eternal life so they just take sides with Jesus and and stay there and and you know what people say Well they're just gullible they're just gullible people willing to accept anything no it's not it's been Vindicated we're not following a David Caris you're drinking the Kool-Aid of Jim Jones and we're not drinking anybody else's Kool-Aid we're following Vindication that's right that's right the ones brother Brown said the ones who ought to have loved him the ones who ought to have been for him was his bitterest enemies and he had made up his little group out of a bunch of poor people fishermen tax gatherers uneducated the Bible said some of them was even ignorant and unlearned some could not even sign their name he never went to the churches to get his people he never agreed with any of the church leaders and besides that he followed the very trend of a prophet he condemned everything that they done as the ones before him had because they were a portion of the word and he was the word in its fullness notice but everybody say but in the midst of it all see through every age and every Prophet that had been or would be there is going to be a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message and they will follow it they ignore the crowds they ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they have no argument with them they've got one thing to do and that's to believe and to get every bit of it they can soak it in like Mary who sat at the feet of Jesus prise the Lord last Sunday we read this scripture I'll read it again as we get ready to close Proverbs 311 says who can find a virtuous woman for a price is far above rubies the heart of her husband do safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life I thought of that and what a what a scripture and this isn't just a man writing this about a natural woman even though we're living in a day that there's very uh virtuous women left in the world and but I I think of the heart of God as he's speaking through this this man and the words are being pinned the heart of God looking for someone virtuous who who who who who is there that can just wait upon me until I bring my word to them who is it that could just accept my word and be satisfied with it instead of when something glittery or something greater is something better comes they they get sidetracked and they follow it and you know the Bible says when he came there was no comeliness that we should desire him there there was no beauty that we should desire him there was nothing about him that really was spectacular that that had a drawing card for the world but but the elect was drawn to him because they saw him for what he was he was the promise of life within him was the promise of life ain't that right and and and and so so but but see that that woman that virtuous woman is actually the bride of Christ and I am so glad that we could answer back that there can actually be an answer in this day to say there is that virtuous woman she's here that's right the Lord we are a people that is virtuous unto him what an honor that is amen Hallelujah she'll be the one to go in the Rapture you know because she's virtuous praise the Lord and not not because she's any whatever but it's because there's only one way for for for her to go in a Rapture there's only one way for a person to go in a Rapture and this scripture has been made plain to us in this day 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead and Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord you see before the dead in Christ can rise first and before we which are alive can be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air there has to be something take place and that's the shout The Voice the Trump and in all reality it's the word brother Brown said Christ does all three that's right and why she why is it that she's the only one that goes in the Rapture is because she's a virtuous woman that's right she's not impatient she's not in a hurry she's not going after some Fang dangle thing Satan you realize how many times Satan has offered us the same things that he has Eve and we keep turning him down that's right thank realize how many times that he has tried to get us to get impatient but there's no lust for knowledge we're literally settled in what God has said am am it's quickening something within us am and the prophet said the message is the shout that calls the bride together it brings them together it calls the bride and he brings them together true without this message there could be no Unity without this message there could be no Oneness because Jesus and the father were one with the word he was the word Christ God in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen now it's Christ in his bride amen the word he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never never doubts it amen I hope it's helped you in some way brother brandom said the bride stands virtuous because when she heard the truth she came forth and the blood cleansed her amen you see it when you had a positive response to the message you didn't just sit there and say well I don't know I don't know if it's really right or not you know it saddens me when you got ministers in the message still still at that point they don't know whether it's right or wrong people don't know whether it's right or wrong but this bride will never be deceived she'll never turn from it she is Thoroughly convinced and she has come forth when she's heard the message and the blood has cleansed her amen that's right she's virtuous aren't you glad for that Amen brother Ram said no sin in her at all she's not a defiled woman I'm so glad for that if the musicians will come do you love the Lord God has finally been able to achieve the Oneness that Jesus prayed for that's right in such a way and and as I've said it before that's why you and I are going through so much hell on Earth so to speak trial after trial it seems and it seemed like not just one trial but trials on every hand but you see what it is is God's proven you I go listen to um I think it's um God of this evil age I I think I've been listening to it and um the other night I I couldn't sleep so I was um listening to the sermon yeah the God of this evil age amen and brother brandham said see he's um he's calling people out for his name in this age and he said the reason why is to try her try her to try her amen now you think of that he's calling her out to try her what is it a blessing to be called out then oh yeah cuz then brother brand says the reason why he's trying her is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve she will not do like Eve amen so you're tried on every hand but think it not strange concerning the trials that are to try you can you say Amen it's only working for your good if you only knew that God is bragging on you he's able to finally achieve Oneness amen and that Oneness will not break not not break CU she staying true to the word you love him amen what's song Amazing
