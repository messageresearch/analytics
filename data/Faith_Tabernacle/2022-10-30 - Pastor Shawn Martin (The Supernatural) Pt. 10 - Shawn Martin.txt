hands amen we can make it we're going to make it man it's already written and so we just have that Faith that's what gives us the confidence a man and uh it's uh good to just see everyone back in the house of the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and I'd like to go back to the book of Ephesians the first chapter and um uh we want to remember I forgot to announce it this morning but next Sunday is our Fall Festival and so we'll be having service at Camp Christie at 11 o'clock uh there and then uh the festival following after the service uh brother Diago I don't even know his first name that may even be his first name I don't know uh so we'll have to find that out but brother Diago is uh Lord Willem will be here speaking for us and um I guess most of you have seen him he's been to our meeting a few times and sung and just a good brother and so we're really looking forward to having him and seems to have a good report among the Brethren and so we thank the Lord for that but um the book of Ephesians uh the second chapter and um or the first chapter I should say and I'm going to just start the um 22nd verse it says and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads precious Lord we're so glad to know that we can make it Lord and in the the times that Satan would throw the questions at us we have an answer and it's it's not coming from confusion that it's coming from an absolute and that is we will make it an old father we're so glad that you would open our eyes in this day that by revelation that we can see Lord who we are and who you are and Lord that there's a a relation there between us and father we're just asking now that you would just come and Minister Among Us father commune with us tonight is our prayer we're your sons and daughters Lord and I pray that you would not only anoint me but anoint the hearing of your word we ask it in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen God bless you all as our prayer and uh good to have sister Cindy back with us amen and missed her this morning and uh just everyone um good to have everyone and just hang in there for just a moment praise the Lord I hate spiders so I hope you're not an animal lover in that way but um we I want to continue from this morning and um so the title will be the Supernatural and and I believe that the bride is beginning to recognize who she is and we could only do that by Revelation but it it had to be the Revelation had to come from somewhere and that's the word of God and that's why God would send us a prophet now brother Branham said you were made for an eternal purpose not a temporal purpose it's all this life is temporal what you do in life is temporal uh you may you know go to college thank you uh you may go to college and and learn a degree but that's temporal you may you may invest in in whatever but it's just temporal we're dealing with an eternal purpose so you were made for an eternal purpose because listen you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of to make you a human being thing of that made the Earth to take you out foreign to make you a human being God just has reasons for it all don't he and sin come along and perverted his way you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute not just a human being an expressed attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on I think the way he puts these things is incredible how he makes his statements now so sin temporarily stopped the Eternal purpose of God if if you want to say it that way or at least stopped you because you did not come as uh expressing sonship you did not come expressing as being part of God you express the Fallen nature a carnal nature you express the the expression of sin you were the expression of sin ain't that right of a fallen of the Fallen condition so when I I say that our fallen you know uh uh you know I our fallen state was a part of God's purpose in that he allowed it to happen and you say man he allowed you to be a sinner he allowed you to be a slave to the devil he allowed you to be a victim to have a sinful nature he allowed you to be in the condition uh to where you could be tempted but didn't predestinate you there he allowed it so you were predestinated everybody say but I was predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son and you say man so whatever God allowed to happen in this space of time did not stop or abolish or destroy God's purpose for his purpose is an eternal purpose can you say man amen that's right so God allowed you to come some other way but it did not stop his purpose so so whatever God uh we in this age are living in the age of the manifestation of the sons of God and you say amen that's right no longer a son or daughter of our Earthly parents no longer reflecting our natural family history and you say Amen no longer following the traits of our natural genes now try it yes the body of Christ is made up of natural people right that's right but these people have had a supernatural birth that has broken every natural claim on you death has lost its hold sin has lost its hold your natural lineage has lost its hold all because of a supernatural birth can you say Amen and inside of this natural people resides the supernatural so the fact that we are sons of daughters of God comes from a supernatural work nothing natural ain't that right the second birth our second Birth has nothing to do with the natural it doesn't matter if you were the fur the worst sinner in the country it doesn't matter if you come from the vilest parents or the vilest family tree you could have been you know had your lineage you know from Australia you know where they put all the the vowel sinner or the criminals and all of that uh you know and and you could yeah whatever you you could Chase your your lineage like a lot of people are interested in doing today and you could find out that you know your great great great great grandfather was just uh the cruelest guy and and big bad you know uh uh bill or whatever see but it doesn't matter about that it doesn't matter how low down and degraded you were because that's all coming from a natural lineage can you say Amen so your new birth is Supernatural because God placed his own Jean seed down inside of you now brother Branham says that as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we Eternal think of that he's not even dealing with our natural even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so-called So Not only was he a Son of God we are son of Gods sons of God nor Not only was he in the Eternal thought of God we are an eternal thought of God not only not only did God predestinate that body to live in 2 000 years ago that God would predestinate our body to live in in this age the word became flesh in that body the word is becoming flesh in this body then it took a supernatural thing he was not born by sex he was born by the word ain't that right his birth was Supernatural his conception was Supernatural oh yes you were born by sex but that second birth was born by a supernatural act can you shame man because your natural birth could not produce a spoken word Son of God Amen your natural birth could only produce a rock no down low down sinner that that's Supernatural quickened something down inside of you ain't that right so he said we did not become seed everybody say we did not become seed we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken ain't that right so then another place which I think is powerful it's through his holy blood that we have access to life and our sexual blood is dismissed now uh that's powerful our sexual blood's dismissed all the traits all the genealogy all everything is dismissed something overrode it and it was the supernatural act of God and we have the blood of Jesus Christ that stands for an atonement making an atonement for our sins is that right see this body of Christ is not made up of sinners we're not sinners this body of Christ is made up of people that has been redeemed that right now yeah and I know brother Brandon said we're Sinners saved by grace but then brother Brandon turns around and says how can you be a sinner and saved at the same time so you understand what he's trying to tell you we were low down but to walk as a person low down today you would be you you would be it's a slap in God's face because he took that and dismissed that we had every right to hang our head low but not now can you say man by our natural birth our first birth we had every right to to Faith look at life as full of Doom and Gloom we had every right to live without hope but in our second birth we have every right to lift up our head for a Redemption draws nine so our sexual blood is dismissed now in the natural courts you know uh uh a man is judged by what he did or didn't do ain't that right so if the evidence proves that he committed a crime then he is judged for it I was kind of keeping up on this this man that that ran his car to the Christmas parade uh last Christmas and you know he fired his lawyers and wanted to represent himself and it was a show and and so he's trying to prove his innocence and here's they've got all this evidence stacked up against him every bit of it so the jury they came time for the jury the jury didn't even deliberate maybe two hours three hours 76 counts and they charged him for every single count face and life for every count and plus 800 years that's for bad but see if the evidence proves that the man committed this crime then they judge him for it but we find that in God's court today right we as Believers are not judged by what we did in this life I think that that is that that's that's incredible because we are judged according to his eternal thoughts that's what's happened in this age judged now we read this scripture this morning second Corinthians 5 17. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature creation old things are passed away behold all things all things everybody say all things all things are become new you mean it's it's see it's not an old patched up something It's All Things become new right amen that's right now what happened why why did the the new what what happened The Sinner came to its end that center part of you had come to its end and God put you on a different path ain't that right seek God had a what God had allowed has come to its end your Fallen state has come to its end can you say Amen that was judged that was doomed that was condemned and it had to die can you say Amen but it only died so that another could be reborn ain't that right now do you believe that we are at the end of all things we're at the end of all things now I think this is marvelous because the new we're thinking of that new the heavens and earth are coming to their end the natural kingdoms have come to their end look at them scrambling around trying to save the save save the country to save the world it's come to its end ain't that right natural religions have come to their hand the natural governments have come to their end the Bible even speaks about uh the ends of the Earth and at the ends of the Earth we are commanded to look unto him for salvation ain't that right see so what we're looking at is if it's come to its sin that tells us that what God has allowed for these segment of time has come to its end so that what he had originally thought in his mind would now come to manifestation can you say Amen we have come to the place and everything is now going back to the place where we originally started and that was the Eternal thoughts of God God saved you but not only just saved you he redeemed you then you say Amen if he redeemed you that means there's that Eternal purpose that is still living and God is brought you to where you can now start manifesting his eternal purpose all things are passed away them things have come to an end brother Matt another example is telling me he said you know come to your meeting there in April in he said bro Sean things that I have tried to quit for years and years habits things in my life that I just couldn't get rid of he said I come to your meeting and something happened he said I went home a different person he said even my friends know what I would do they know it and yet they can't understand what's happened because I don't desire it no more I don't want it no more the power of sin is broken I tell you what it is it's an eternal thought now coming to manifestation people have tried for years to break things and they can't but God does it once and it's broken people's tried to quit smoking cigarettes and they just can't but when God gets a hold of them it's over then you say man now that's our testimony we are here as Paul would say I am what I am by the grace of God ain't that right so we've come back to the place where we originally started and that's the Eternal thoughts of God the perfect wheel of God what God allowed is coming to an end what God predestinated is coming to manifestation amen notice I hope it's all right Isaiah 42 and 7. it says behold the former things are come to pass and new things do I declare new things Isaiah 65 17 God says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the formal things shall not be remembered nor come into mind when God does it he just does it Revelations 21 and 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven and first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God notice and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither Sara nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away now we can shout over that because God has already done something new down inside this boy he's done suck new in you to make you a church a body of his can you say Amen now think of it new new Heavens new Earth tears won't be there death won't be there pain won't be there cyride crying murder won't be there Temptations won't be there loneliness won't be there can you say man that's right why he's making something new and whatever it was in the former is going to be done away with ain't that right and no man I don't care what they do can make anything new look at Solomon he says there's nothing new Under the Sun nothing there's not Brandon tells us it's just been a cycle history repeating itself right history repeating itself that's right but when God makes something new when he does it it's over now the body of Christ is a new creation made up of people who are a new creation in Christ Jesus the old habits are gone the old desires are gone all unbelief is gone the old nature is gone the old Fighting is gone why God made something new the Creeds Traditions dogmas a man has no part of this creation the former things are passed away ain't that right now we're coming to what it really means of justification you never did it in the first place brother Brown said this old this old life has passed away never listen now this is incredible never to be remembered by God this old life is passed away never to be remembered by God man can do things new they can start a new Leaf every year turn the new page that God remembers ain't that right and he always seems to go right back to what they tried to leave they start out trying to do something new and it always comes back on them but this when God does something so new is it that God can't even remember your old past did you notice that God promised I am new God promised to give the overcomer a new name a new name he gave you a new life a new beginning and he says I'll give you a new name and you know what it's going to be his new name ain't that right Revelations 3 13 him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go out no more hello not in and out anymore and I will write upon him the name of my God which is Jesus Christ and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of of Heaven from my God can you say Amen so the prophet says he goes ahead and tells what the name of the city is New Jerusalem the church itself is the New Jerusalem ain't that right we can go into a lot of that right there for you but but we'll move on but she is the New Jerusalem now Abraham met the king Melchizedek right now Revelations 21 2. John says and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband ain't that right knows what brother Brown says the new church is the Gentile Church the bride notice it's a new church and that new church is the Gentiles the bride the Bride is a gentile and the Gentile has his name he took out of uh took a people out of the Gentiles for his name's sake so God says I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God and will write upon him my new name now I I think this is powerful look brother Brown would say then which is all the same Jesus Jesus Jesus and you say Amen what's the name he's going to write Jesus ain't that right and so forth see he says see and the bride married to Jesus watch it makes it Miss Jesus and you say Amen foreign how did he accomplish it he overcome death hell in the grave and he purchased you then you say Amen in overcoming he got you for you are his victory ain't that right new church I like that new church not old church not something just carrying the same old same old same old new church and the bride married to Jesus makes it Miss Jesus and so forth there's some mighty fine women in this building tonight mighty fine but there's one of them that's mine she's got my name ain't that right and I hope you got that he says she's bearing my name soul will his bride and did you know the name of Jesus has deity in it the name Jesus Christ has deity that's right see and did you know a name change has something to do with your life sure does God changed Jacob's name which meant uh Jacob men subplanator Deceiver ain't that right and he changed it to Israel which means a prince having power with God God would recognize the change and gave him a name change ain't that right and his name changed when he got his overcoming power and wrestled with the angel what happened he had come to the end of his old life what Jacob was Jacob was no more he changed and God gave him a name change to Bear record that that character that nature had changed that ain't the same Jacob anymore God recognized it Simon the fisherman got his name changed to Peter the prophet said when he overcome by his faith in Jesus something changed in him to where he had never be the same again and you say man brother Brown said see your name has something to do with it your placement in life and it has an impression on your character now you know brother Brown was big in names said if you named your child Ricky change it change it to number one number two but don't leave it Ricky he said it's in this age now Elvis and rickly Ricky has has come that name has come to the Forefront never has it been till this age why it's showing the age that we're living in ain't that right this bride has been changed we've been called out not bearing the old habits and the old Cycles the cycles of religion has been broken over this body Abraham or Abram had to have his Earthly name changed to a name given by God Abraham the prophet said God gave him a part of his own name ain't that right that's right see so he says these names either brought about a change or were given because of a change but the name means something ain't that right listen now only only after Abraham and Sarah had their names Changed by the Lord that they were made ready to receive the coming son I like that God knew what he was doing he changed that name and only after their name was changed could they receive the coming son and you say Amen life entered into them now we know that Abraham and Sarah's story types our story right after Saul received the Lord his name was changed to Paul see and even when Jesus overcome death hell and the grave the Bible says he received a new name now listen the prophet says if the church can overcome she will stop saying I am Methodist I'm Baptist Presbyterian when she can overcome her Creeds and the world that's drawn her in there she'll come back to the Bride of Jesus Christ miss everybody say Miss Jesus Christ and you say Amen Miss Jesus Christ and again there's only one name that holds deity and that is the name of Jesus Christ now notice he says the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on in to the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the self-same persons no other time in the history as the church board the name of Jesus Christ like it does today why they have become United I knew God's done something new he's taken out a bride or out of people out of the Gentiles in this day for his name he said see to go right into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be the same self persons God have mercy God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one think Heaven we've come to a place a people on earth that could actually say he that has seen me has seen the father [Music] they are one he says now you see where we're at I know you know these things but I hope it's refreshing you see you are part of the godhead I've said this for years I just believe it you're part of the godhead there's nothing wrong with that when you really see who you are you can't be part of God and not part of the godhead come on Church and you say man and in the godheads you are Sons and Daughters of God now notice I've read this I think last Sunday in him everybody say in him dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily where we in there where in the godhead are Sons and Daughters to God in God's godhead yes as Sons and Daughters we're in the family if you're in there God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost not three different gods same person three different offices God in the pillar of Fire but when he wanted to become son he created a body right and then he comes as the Holy Spirit but not without a body he'd been working on that body ain't that right he's been working on that body that's right so when he comes as Holy Spirit and then he there's that age you know he was Son of God but then he changes the dispensation to son of man why a body is on Earth you can you say Amen just as much as God couldn't be son without the body of Jesus Christ God couldn't be bride without a many-membered body can you say man it took you to complete God the church is the fullness of God she's the completion of God he was the beginning of the creation if I can say it this way you're the ending the completion the final of the creation Hallelujah Hallelujah man one man one man in this age and not not a created word body a redeemed body stood there and said let there be squirrels it happened and then the prophet says even Jesus in that body did not create he took water and turned it into wine he grabbed dust spit it and put it in the eyes sockets of the blind ain't that right but in this age God in his bride stood there and said let there be and there was it confounds the unbeliever but that's okay I believe it amen I believe it's so can you say man what is it we're coming back to the Eternal thoughts of God no church could produce that no Doctrine no Seminary no Theologian could produce it God himself has come you say man don't doubt it Who You Are don't underestimate Who You Are you say well I ain't spoken squirrels into existence that may not be you but as you receive the word of this message you receive God and that same God in you is just as much as powerful as it was in a prophet and that God that was in that Prophet was in the body of Jesus Christ ain't that right and did he not say Greater Works than these shall you do I know people say that's that's all brother Branham I don't believe that brother Brown never taught that he said that's to the believer to the believer the more you yield to God the more you believe them promises watch it happen don't bemoan your situations don't be moaning the conditions you're in don't look at your lost loved one just yield to him who has taken your vessel and used it for his body amen now in there in there in the godhead see in God's godhead we're sons and daughters of God Church attendance does not make you son or daughter of God Holiness don't make you a son or daughter of God reading praying doesn't make you a son or daughter of God and I'm going to get more into that in in later because brother Brown deals with it but your salvation your Redemption you being placed in the body does not have anything to do with literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life as we read this morning with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved right we could go back and read them quotes but I'm not going to but but I will say brother Brown said you passed into eternity from where you came from you was there to begin with and you say man you was there everybody say I was there to begin with so God ended that sinner life and doesn't hold it to you he allowed it to be an expression to to be able to express himself to you in certain ways but you're sealed now if you've received the Holy Ghost you're sealed you can never come back and be a sinner so you never have to come back to an altar or say the sinner's prayer again Prophet said yes you're going to make mistakes yes you're subject to mistakes but you'll never have to come back to God as a sinner and say a sinner's prayer again there's an atonement right so dealing with sinner today or tomorrow save today Center tomorrow don't know where I stand all that that's got to be gone now we've got to find our establishment can you say man now and I'm I'm not gonna I appreciate your patience I'm not going to keep you much longer but so many times people look to the Natural side of things as a Vindication that they're saved on the on their way to heaven or whatever there have been men rise up claiming you know to have oil or blood running out of their hands the prophet talked about people having blood in the face and they have called these things as the people look on these things as divine as something spiritual as something as a vindication well for number one the scripture doesn't say anything like that the scripture does not prophesy of anything like that so so that is so wrong now the prophet says any these days any man can get a following because people become so gullible ain't that right now what God would do is send us a prophet to keep us from being gullible so those things have nothing to do with being a Son of God they have nothing to do with God but also as I said this morning people have made salvation all about outward demonstration shaken the breacher's hands signing your name citing a Creed of of of of a certain Church then you you have the Pentecostals that have put main emphasis on Sensations emotions speaking in tongues dancing in the spirit prophecy interpreting tongues having dreams seeing visions and brother Brown said they have depended on Sensations or a Psalm and any little sign of something to happen or they won't believe what the word of God says true the preaching come on I'm talking about something Supernatural that is beyond the natural but they have taken the naturalist signs so they depend on some natural thing to be done or said before they even recognize themselves as Christians how many people see others dancing well I've never done that and they feel like they've not gotten anywhere with God well that is no measure well I've never spoken tongues that is no measure well I've never prophesied I I've never felt much that that that that is no measure and you say man that's right see see notice what the prophet said all the natural work everybody say all the natural work was done by the sacrifice of Christ so we don't need natural displays as a Vindication for our salvation can you say man notice John 19 30 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar vinegar he said it is finished three most powerful words one of them it is finished not just for his life for your life Satan's power was finished Satan's claim on you was finished Satan's domain was finished every perversion of Satan over your life was finished the thing that separated man from God was finished it is finished why because of that natural death that natural Act of Jesus Christ Hebrews 10 14 for by one offering everybody say one offering what one offering was that the offering of Jesus Christ God offered his own son on your behalf and by that one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified by one natural Act there's been many natural religious Acts but by this natural Act it was finished by this one natural Act he perfected all once and for all them that are sanctified good Lord Supernatural so you he had perfected you before you were born before you even had a history he perfected you can you say Amen so now where are we at now one natural act finished it so now where are we standing remember in the book of Acts Peter preached a sermon to the people there in Acts 13 48. and said and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the Lord the word of the Lord hello they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed no natural Act just believed they heard the word preached and we're glad rejoiced and they that were ordained to eternal life see that's Supernatural oh so now it comes down to what is in the heart of the individual all of the outward displays that people do and all that don't mean nothing it's what the God by his supernatural act Supernatural power placed in that soul can you say man so the question is were you predestinated to eternal life or not did God place that Gene seed in you before the foundation of the world or not knocked did you dance did you shout did you run around the building or not that's not the question the question is do you have the gene seed in you to believe to Rejoice to receive the word and if you have that gin seed you were ordained to believe and you will believe no matter what skeptic says no matter what the critic says no matter what condition you're in you're coming out because God we're doing that notice Ephesians 2 1 and you hath he quickened who were what dead entrespasses and sins I like that not not this because you ran around the church where you quickened not because you jumped up and done a shot that you were quick no not because you played the music like angels that you were quickened not because you could preach such a sermon that everybody just oohs and alls nope and you hath he Quicken it's a supernatural act where in time past you walked past tense the M came you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now present tense worketh in the children of Disobedience that spirit will continue working in people but not in you the believer hey you believe it among whom also we had all we all had past tense our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but got everybody say but God Supernatural God who is rich in Mercy his Mercy is so Supernatural for his great love Supernatural love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins had nothing to do with you had you not searching God you had nothing to do with it you were dead in your sins hath quickened us together it with Christ for by Grace everybody say by Grace you are saved this body is an attribute of God's grace the grace of God it's a supernatural act and hath raised us up together and made us sit together who did it God did it Christ see so we are coming back to the Eternal thoughts of God of what he thought of you to be he didn't leave you out he loved you listen Ephesians 1 4 is this all right according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy and Without Blame before the Pope before the president nope before our co-worker nope before the preacher no before him now that's what makes a difference the god that can't forget forgets that God within an infinite knowledge that there ain't even a flea that could come up on this Earth without God knowing it and there ain't not one flea that come has come up on this Earth through the whole span of time that God hasn't known Every Beat of every flea of every heartbeat and the measure of breath And yet when God looked upon you notice now he chose you in him before the foundation of the world why that you should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to what because he had to oh no he wasn't forced to save you didn't have to do nothing that he did it according to his pleasure good pleasure of his own will and you say Amen so there was no way to be quickened unless God had placed his Jean seed in you now notice any son the prophet says is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father and the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you see but then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you well and so were you sons of God and Daughters of God before there was even before even was a moon stars or a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for your are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning see it's become flesh see for for there's only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your Earthly father but you are manifested too in His image and in the image of God you are made and you were manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world so again what did God thought of you he didn't think of you as a sinner he didn't think of you as a liar he didn't think you it was a lowed down rock no good individual he's thought of you as holy righteous a son of God oh praise God everything that God is he thought of you [Music] holy righteous clean loving peace and you say Amen and it had nothing to do with you dancing in the spirit had nothing to do with you shouting had nothing to do with you dancing had nothing with you nothing it didn't even have nothing to do with you going to church you come to church because well brother Brown said what I do for God I do because I love him so the genes of the man is in the woman this is what the prophet's saying the genes of the man is in the woman and that's what makes the woman and that's the way the word of God is in the church it is what makes the church the bride so the genes that's in the man that makes the woman the word of God in you is the same way that's what makes you blind you say man so this Bride is a creation of the supernatural the gene of God can you say man so I think as I said this morning that God has to supernaturally create faith in you for you to believe you you can't believe on your own God has to supernaturally you could you could sit under message all you want the whole entire life and if God doesn't create the faith in you hire in you no matter how much elegant words no matter how much the spirit of God Falls it won't work that's why we go back to really what counts and that is the creation what God created in you and the first part of that creation is desire amen so again many times people look to the outward manifestations as the Jew look to the sacrifice of the natural lamb the Jew looked to the Natural lamb natural Act for his salvation and too many people look to the Natural Things just as the Jew did to the lamb so we say well if I just quit this or that then I know I'm a Christian so then we put all the emphasis on don't do this do that don't do this do that red Brown said you do not come to Christ by do's and don'ts right well if I do this or if I do this or don't do that or whatever then I know I'm going to interrupture try it okay so you go a month doing it right oh great because the word to God I'm going in a Rapture and then you fall flat on your face I don't know no I don't know if I'm going I made a mistake right has nothing to do with it I tell you brother Brown said it this way it's the predestinated seed that's going in the rapture so I'm going to be bold the Rapture could come in five seconds and in one second you fall flat on your face and make a mistake one second three seconds in between or four seconds in between the Raptors coming and you fall flat on your face and you make a mistake does God have to say oh my George I don't know what I'm gonna do with them I'm trying to get them all straight where they all live right for at least five minutes so I can bring on a rapture only the predestinated is going in Iraq so remember the seed has to be in the soul right no matter how religious you are in your spirit and what kind of fleshly manifestations you produce it has to be a supernatural act of God in your soul now brother Branham said and I'm trying to close I appreciate your patience man you're thinking man I used to be the most popular preacher in Pawnee because when I started preaching I was only 10 minutes and the children loved me oh yeah I didn't have to give candy like I do now yeah so brother Brian said thousands of signed workers have created a generation of signed Seekers that knows nothing about the true move of God and his word in these last days can you imagine thousands of signed workers have created a generation of signed Seekers give them blood and oil and fleshly demonstrations on the platform and they'll support it whether it's of God or not whether it's the word of God or not whether it's scripture or not see God as I said this morning God never placed signs ahead of his word never never right he never places gifts ahead of his word he never places prophecy ahead of his word he never places dreams and Visions ahead of his word he never places emotions ahead of his word he never places Sensations ahead of his word and I I believe that I can safely say that God never places his anointing ahead of his word yes the word is Anointed but how many times people are anointed and not anointed to the word and people see the anointing and say let's go for it babe right forget about the word but God never places the anointing ahead of his word the word is always before the people right what we want to get to is the words before our eyes I've set your word before my eyes can you say man so I can say that about that anointing because remember Balaam was anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit he prophesied and his prophecy was true but his teaching was wrong his Doctrine was wrong can you say man his teaching was false which the prophet made him a false prophet so the Bible prophesies that in the last day there shall come false prophets not false Jesus false christs men who are anointed but not to the word it's a genuine anointing he says that make people dance shout prophesy speak in tongues can you say amen he said but the word Bears record of itself in other words you can take God at his word without anything else amen because it Bears record of itself prophecies a lot of times don't bear record with the word dreams Visions uh Goosebumps Sensations and and emotions and all of that a lot of times don't bear record with this word but the word Beer's record of itself can you say man so it doesn't need anything else the prophet said for it Bears record to itself has nothing to do with it being prophesied over has nothing to do with it having a dream or a vision has nothing to it someone having a dream or a vision about you has nothing to do with it was raised in that Pentecost where it was always had to be dreams Visions always had to be something prophesying and if if someone didn't get you know if you didn't get prop site over someone else did you just felt let down why didn't they prophesy over me you know you know as a pastor pastor always got this certain woman certain woman always had Visions about for the pastor you know never about anyone else hardly and you're just thinking well why why why would that be why is it always Visions well the pastor always leaned upon that woman it it you know if people are watching you know I just I'm gonna say it you know it's almost become so dependent upon dreams it's almost like going to a soothsayer or a or a hand or a pond read or whatever tell me my fortune tell me my fortune tell me my fortune I'm serious you could have a division oh God's going to prosper give it a month well I ain't had no vision from sister so and so I wonder what's happening you understand what I'm saying well we depended upon them things but what about the word and I'm going to tell you young people same thing I know we got gifts in the in the message which don't bring Revival you say oh so-and-so's coming they got the gifts it don't bring Revival and you start depending on that you're going back to a Pentecostal ideology because I was there I know what it was brother Walker you were there brother Terry and them was there if any of you been in that Pentecostal time you understand what it was all Sensations it was a roller coaster loves me loves me not loves me whoa well why does he love you because he Pro I got prophesied over I I got excited I actually got out and danced give it two months and it's just dry I don't know if he loves me and you say man see so the prophet said see don't have nothing to do with this inside outside has nothing to do with inside now now I hope you understand I hope you're making it I'm making it clear to you you don't let the devil misinterpret things that I'm trying to tell you but but I am telling you the truth unless he says unless that was God's seed his Gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished Prophet say all you want to let them do shindigs all they want to if the seed ain't there it's finished it's over it's done is I don't care how much you shout speak with tongues run shout that has nothing to do with it a cockleberg can count just as much as any of the rest of them I've seen heathens raised shout speaking tongues drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil any of them Sensations and things forget it can I tell you that forget it he said it's your heart in that word get it put your heart in the word put your faith in that word and that's Christ bring him there and watch it make it self-known just as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the age it's living in can you say Amen so notice notice where the predestinated elective God stand he says How can any messenger Sin from God believe only part of the word and deny some of it now I I'd love to read this to them Renegade preachers that are teaching the people that brother Branham only had opinions some hearing this and then you know uh uh what what he said on some doctrines if you can't find in the word ignore it that was just his opinion now here brother branham's answering them critics and tell them how can he messenger Sin from God believe only part of the word and deny some of it the true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the whole word denominations will hate him and people in this own message will hate him his words may be as harsh as John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the rapture the rule Seed of Abraham with the same Faith as Abraham's faith will hold the to the word with him for they are predestinated together then you say Amen do you love him see it's the Deep calling into the deep now I'm closing but I want to hit on this for just a moment even our calling in gifts are Supernatural Ephesians 4 11. says that he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers in the Pentecostal rim preachers were birthed simply because someone prophesied over them and told them they were called to preach but the Bible says God set in his church pastors prophets teachers evangelists Apostles can you say man well at the Burning Bush Moses heard a supernatural voice calling him and commissioning brother Brandon says and no man has a right to preach the gospel until secretly back on the back side of the desert he stood on the ground with him and God Alone there's no intellectual being in the world could explain it away from you that's right you were there you know it happened ain't that right gifts and callings are without repentance and they are ordained before the foundation of the world now we might we might pray over somebody see a gift in their life and pray with them but that does not mean that we put a gift in them that means we the prophet says this he said he's talking about Paul Paul laid hands on Timothy to sanction sanction his ministry and he said and knowing that the gift was in him and they seen it work right they seen it at work and they just give him the right hand of Fellowship to bring him into the service of God now I'm going to read this and I'm closing in question and answers a man asked brother Branham a question he said brother Branham I've heard you uh you should be back he says I've heard you say I should be back in the ministry and that and I have thought upon it myself but have waited upon some definitely word from him about it up to date it hasn't come now since I know the end is so near should I still wait for the Lord to speak to me or would he be pleased to tell you what to tell me since I know you're his spokesman's for the day well now this brother his answer he says I got wrote down here my answer to it God calling this brother a call in his life he said now there's one great thing we could just take as a Texan preach all night on it at one thing a calling make your calling and election sure we don't want to be just wondering if we're called you must be called or you will be defeated were fighting a battle then you say man now our calling is is in anything and if you are positive sure brother that your calling is of God and you've been called of God to do a work he said now there's a great trick there that the enemy can play on you he can make you think you're not called when you're called then he can turn around back around and make you think you're not called or make you yeah you are called when you're not called vice versa either way and you have to watch it now here's the way to do it he said well now this is advice only thing I can only thing I can give on this is advice so now Prophet knows his boundaries right he said I can only give advice he said but make sure that your calling comes from God then check your motives and objectives right now you know what I mean by that what is your motive for preaching he said well see if you think it was an easier job than what you have then you'd better forget it it wasn't a call right he said a call of God burned so in your heart till you can't rest day or night for it you just can't get away from it it's just constantly grinding at you and if you had to preach well now another objective I believe at the job I've got if I could be a successful evangelist or Pastor have a good set salary have a home that I could go into and so forth and live I believe that would be a good thing much easier than what I'm doing now see and really I think it would be he said well see your objective is wrong to begin with it's not right he said and you're wrong there on that and you say Amen I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna put my thing in here for just a moment because I got to thinking the other day we have got churches rising up everywhere it's just churches do you realize how many churches set without pastors today it's incredible you realize that we barely got evangelist on the field I mean in in our message ranks we may have four good evangelists that that are out on the field now I was talking to a brother a while back and it just hit me God is the one that sets the the pastors evangelists prophets teachers all that in the church so my question as I began to think about this is God not been able to supply the demand because it sure seems like it we've got people sitting in churches without pastors for 10 years so what's happening we've got young men that should be on the field yeah they won't just go established churches what's funny to me about this is the established churches right around where churches are when they should be out there preaching with a burden for people hello but you see what's happening but when God says that's what I'm trying to get to you tonight God has to do this thing and when God puts the call there's a real burden there to where God can put you in your place now see you're he says now see if you're just thinking this is going to be an easy job you know why a lot of people here you know why people established in churches these days yeah let's just put it plainly it's because they got mad at the church they get we're at some some preacher thought he was better than the pastor Pastor wasn't doing a good job got egotistic so he found some complainers pulls them away starts a church or some group of people one person money or whatever gets mad can't come under subjection so he just says well I'm leaving the problem with this is he talks to other people in the church and he starts Awakening things up in their lives really I never noticed that before and before you know it he's got a group pulls him away now they're praying for a pastor please God send me a pastor send us a pastor oh God we need a pastor it just blows my mind but this body it has to be God doing it it's a supernatural act now brother Brown would say then you would say well maybe because you know I think that maybe I'd be more popular among the people and you'll find out you're just ready for a big flop but now if your objective is that I don't care if I have to eat soda crackers and drink Branch water I'll preach the gospel anyhow something just tearing into you I'll preach the gospel or die then you'll go somewhere because it's God dealing with you and you say man you don't care if you're preaching on streets you're going to do it because it's God dealing with you right God is making himself known to you because it is God that just won't let you rest and usually a god-called man never wants to do it he said did you ever think of that he said just recently it was asked of Me by some very precious Brethren and said now that we come in the way brother Branham now that we found the Lord and received the Holy Ghost shall we seek gifts for our ministry that we should do he said don't ever do that don't ever never advise people to do something like that because usually a guy that wants to do it is a guy that can't do it it's the guy that tries to run from it is the one that God uses if he's trying to get away from it old brother see I tell you the calling's in me woo man but I'd hate to try it see well there you are that's the one trying to run see amen if he wants to do it so bad the first thing you know he finds himself a stuffed shirt like you say God you give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you if you let me move mountains well he ain't gonna do that he because he can't get him he can't even move himself to the right attitude so he had never moved Mountains for God see just take for instance like Paul you think Paul could have gotten away from his calling oh brother he couldn't do it it was just grinding at him day and night till he left his church he left everything and went down see and I believe it was Asia wasn't it so he stayed three years down there studying the scriptures to find out whether it was right or not to find out whether God had really called him so if God is calling you brother and it keeps digging at your heart then I'd say lay every aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset you but if it's not digging at you then I I wouldn't think too much about it then then you say Amen if the musicians will come I'm going to read one more quote because I it applies to this brother Branham someone asked said brother Brandon do you think that God would speak or he's answering that second part do you think that God would speak to you to tell me notice what his answer is he said I believe that God would speak straight straight to him because you know God see he said we're not too big but what he can speak to us and he'll speak to us all right he'll speak to us and I tell you if he told me then the brother might say well he told Brother Branham so praise God but you see it ain't brother Brown I'm giving you the call it's the Lord Jesus given you the call and if it's the Lord Jesus giving you the call he'll do the speaking I could speak to you to your ears but when Christ calls you to the ministry it's in your heart and that's where the thing has to Anchor and you can't get away from it now if there's any questions to it that a man's call has to be in his heart coming from God he said I know who this is that wrote this and I know a precious brother gracious brother that I truly believe has a call that I wouldn't want him to do it on mine see that's the reason I answered the way I did upon me saying well yes brother so and so ought to go into the ministry see he said now you say well brother Branham told me ought to do that and maybe what if something happened to brother Branham I get killed die or get away see then see your calling is over then but if Jesus calls you Brethren as long as there's an eternity it'll still be ringing out and then you know where you're standing Say Amen then you know so you see it's the supernatural it it takes everything is the supernatural your calling your election comes from Supernatural that way you're saying you ain't gonna say well I got prophesied over 10 years ago well what if that person goes Haywire and what happens to you then you don't know where you're standing can you say man you love him hope it was a help to you tonight amen let's just sing the song I'm in this church this glorious church I appreciate your patience oh I'm in this church this glorious Church I didn't join no I was born I had a new birth so I'm glorious going to sail away it's by his grace not by my works I'm in this church one more time I'm in this church this glorious Church I did not join no I was born I had a new bird

together with them for their son that is in a home but he's got hernia a hernia and he's he's really hurting and he don't understand what's happening and so he can't speak doctors or I get well or the people that's caring for him really can't communicate and so they don't know how because he's just just having a hard time taking care of him handling him they don't know if it's anxiety pain whatever it would be it's going to take four to six weeks for him to get into surgery but we just know that a God can come down and touch and bring peace to that situation how many believers do we have now church I I remember getting metal or copper in my eye when I was doing electrical I had two chunks go in my eye and it was hurting so bad I had to quit I couldn't see I it was just throbbing watering and I remember as I guess it was two hours away from home window drove me home and it was just hurting and I didn't know what to do and I remember a song came across uh in my mind will thou be made whole and and it just kept ringing in my ears without being made whole and I realized it was God's speaking and I said Lord I will be made whole you know instantly the pain left I cleared up and it wasn't and that was years ago maybe when faith in them was like four or five years old and happened to be about five years six years ago that them two pieces came out of my eyelid they were bent in my eye all that time but God made it to where it would never touch my eyes now I just believe that whether it God dissolves the the the the hernia or the or he has to go through surgery but God can take that pain away right now amen and then dissolve it so let's just pray could you just lift your hands and we're just going to pray father God Lord a mother standing in for her son no matter how old our
