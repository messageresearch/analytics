musicians can be dismissed it's good to just see everyone this morning beautiful day today to serve the Lord and to set up a tent and uh uh we uh just thank the Lord for his grace and um um good to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah uh with us today and um and those that have been gone uh out of town or whatever good to have you back amen and um um we're going to uh if you want to turn to the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter but we're going to uh be of course setting the tent up today and and uh going to try to meet at uh 3 uh this afternoon and um uh so if you're able to and would like to help uh we'd certainly appreciate it and um also um just to let you know last you know last year it was a little bit of chaos and um um this this year I put brother Tim in charge and uh so if anything goes wrong no uh uh he's uh you know when we uh left uh last year was Sunday evening that tent was sagging and and the the the man that we bought it from he told told us said now if that tent is sagging it's your fault not ours and so uh we we knew it was our fault somehow and um so brother Tim had um uh he had recorded the the video of the man trying to show or showing us how to set it up and so he got us all straightened out the next night and um so he's been studying it and uh got it all figured out for us and so uh if you have any questions or we're just all going to listen to brother Tim and um uh he'll he'll get us figured out and straightened out and it's going to be a good good day praise the Lord no pressure brother Tim but U all I know is I slept good last night I don't know how he slept but I slept great we appreciate brother Tim very much and uh being willing to uh uh take on the responsibility and to help us and we appreciate it and want to say I appreciate uh the brothers that helped us last night and um uh just really appreciate that very much and uh brother Mark bringing his tractor and helping us get that tent and all that out of the conx and we appreciate that very much and so anyways uh we we love the Lord and and uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to him Lord Jesus truly you are our heart's desire and that longing just just seems to increase within us father we want to be more like you we want to reflect you Lord we we we just want to stay in fellowship with you father Lord May nothing hinder that fellowship and I pray father that you would come in a special way this morning how we need you Lord we're your children father we've gathered here under a promise that where two or three are gathered in your name you would would be here now father May the supernatural take place now father I pray that you'd help me to get myself out of the way and anoint the gift that you placed in my life and may you anoint the people as well feel free father just to move among us we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord uh the scripture I want to read is uh Hebrews 13 and 14 and it says for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen how many seeking amen you can have your seats this morning I pray that something will be said to help you um I I don't plan to get through this my thought and so maybe just more of a foundation and it's something that we all know but I I think it's uh maybe to help uh the young people I I guess and and um maybe just to let us know that we're not here this is this world ain't our home and um we all know as Believers that that in this Mortal life we have no continuing City and therefore as Believers we all seek for a city to continue and uh but not only will this s City uh uh continue but this city will be totally different this Kingdom uh the place that we're going that we're looking looking forward it's it's going to be totally different than anything that we have ever experienced in this life and uh you know the the Bible calls this city uh New Jerusalem and Revelations 21 and 22 talks about it and and uh Jerusalem the prophet said was first called Salem uh and Salem uh is the city of Peace amen and so uh uh uh New Jerusalem this this city that we're looking for and crying after it's it's a city of peace and of course uh we know that Abraham met the king of this city and he was the king of Salem the king of Peace the king of of righteousness and and so and and and this King was MDC uh who had no beginning no ending who had not a father had no mother and no it beginning of days no ending of of life and and these things and and so Paul would call him the God of Peace he's he's the God of Peace and in Romans 16 and2 uh he he would say the God of Peace shall bruise Satan's uh Satan under your feet shortly amen I I thought that's pretty good you know the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet amen now this word peace it it it is rest uh quietness uh no fear Tranquility safety free from Rage and Havoc of War now you you'll never see that in this this world uh that we're living in and and so peace means that the enemy has been conquered it means that you are in agreement and in Fellowship dwelling in safety so peace is a sign that you have been delivered amen and so when when we come to this city of Peace it it it's to the Overcomer it it's it's a it's a place that we have finally uh no fear no no sin no torment no it's it's it's a a place of safety and tranquility and and to think of it that Psalms 5518 says he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me or many against me but yet he has delivered my soul in peace I I think that's our testimony this morning is that there has been a peace in our soul that it it has it has it has finally been delivered from the grip of the devil he can afflict our mind he can afflict our body he can afflict Us in any way but our soul has found peace it's it's at rest because it has been delivered Satan doesn't own us no more he doesn't have dominion over us anymore ain't that right and and to think that we have been appointed to peace we we have been appointed uh Isaiah 26 and12 it says Lord thou will ordain us for peace aren't you glad for that amen being appointed for that um uh in John 14 and 27 Jesus says peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth so our peace is not found in in entainment and and in in the things of of Life uh here for that's all tangible but a pieace that that comes from an eternal it's an eternal peace and he says not as the world give give I unto you let not your hearts be troubled neither let it be afraid there's a peace can you sayen well that peace could be given to us when he defeated Satan and he conquered every demon of hell he conquered sickness he conquered the grave conquered death conquered mortality he conquered it all what a peace can you say Amen that he could give us because he's the Conqueror amen and he's showing us that he done it all for us ain't that right not only did it do it for his sake he done it for our sake amen see and so now he's offering peace uh unto us well peace belongs to the children of God Amen uh 2 Thessalonians 3:16 it says the Lord of Peace himself give you peace Always by all means amen think of that the Lord of Peace the God of Peace himself giveth you peace always ain't that right amen uh uh Psalms 37 And1 but the meek shall inher inherit the earth aren't you glad for that amen stay Meek church be meek amen amen uh the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace amen so so uh peace is our inheritance and amen that's that's what God has that's his whole goal is to give his children peace can you say Amen the Ser uh 37th verse aen of uh 37 says Mark that Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end everybody say the end of that man is peace amen so you're you're not leaving a a world of trouble only to go into torment no that's not that's not your end the end of that man is peace if he's given you peace in your soul then you don't have to fear death You Don't Have To Fear the Future you don't you don't have to fear where you're going for God has determined your end is an end to peace can you say amen amen so it's no wonder that that Believers look for this Eternal City a peace as as even Abraham did the Bible says he looked for a city whose Builder and found uh uh Builder and maker was God and and and and so it's a city of Peace amen uh and and so as Believers we confess with the Old Testament Saints and and those before us that we are pilgrims and and strangers in this land because we're looking for peace can you say amen amen we're looking for peace amen it's there it's there that the bear is going to be gentle it's there that the wolf will be tame it's it's there that the Lion's going to lay down by the lamb it's it's there that the wild beast man will be led by a child and brother Bram said he'll not jump up and rear up and try to kill you he'll walk down the paths with you amen why it's a it's a place of peace peace can you say amen amen I'm so glad for that amen there ain't going to be trying to conquer Devils amen he's already been conquered in this life amen ain't going to be over there being tested and tried amen you've done it in this life and and you've overcome all of that now now the enemy's gone it's it it's a place of peace and you're dwelling in peace and it's an eternal City something that comes and goes tomorrow that ain't it amen it's an eternal something now the world is huling for peace amen the political system is not capable of bringing it um the denominational system the church system religious system they're they're not able to to bring uh uh uh this peace and and and brother Bram says if that will bring about a world peace then what happened to the Prince of Peace that was the word amen see and and so peace can never be done by political uh politics or religious uh things and and things like that actually uh Paul would say in 1 Thessalonians 5 and3 that when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them when they think they've come up with peace then sudden destruction is going to come amen their peace will be disappointed their plans will be totally uh uh uh uh uh upset amen so uh destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not they shall not Escape amen so then that tells us that there is no peace on the earth now we're looking in a time that they're all hollering peace amen and they they're they think they've come up with solutions for peace and they they keep telling us it's peace you know if you vote this one in yeah then then we'll have peace no no more Wars and no no World War II and and and well if you'll do it this way then then we'll come to peace and and all of that but but there will be no peace on this Earth amen and it amazes me to see so-called Christians get so wrapped up in politics as if if that's the answer and and and even in message ranks uh it shows how ignorant they are of the message and what God has brought to us and and what is happening in this day see that they seek peace and and when there is no peace to be found and it's like trying to get blood out of a turnup uh you're looking for the wrong place amen and if you're looking for Trump you're looking for the wrong place if you're looking for Democrats you're looking for the wrong place if you're looking to the pope you're looking for the wrong place amen there's no one that can bring about peace on this Earth can you say amen that's right see and and so the Bible says that in the last days now listen the wise shall understand the wise shall understand it doesn't matter it doesn't mean that everybody in the message is going to be wise amen that's right but their wisdom will come from this message amen those in the message will be wise those outside this message amen ain't going to be wise and and there's a lot that's in the message ain't going to be wise uh uh within the message ring see but notice how this wisdom comes to us the prophet said the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day we are living in can you say Amen so so uh uh uh the wisdom Spirit of wisdom coming in the church amen so this this the the continuing city of of uh and the City of Peace uh that we're seeking for is not controlled by the same spirit that that is is controlling the nations of of today um you know brother brandom tells us that every every nation has a national spirit and and uh uh like he would tell us that German uh Germany has a spirit and it's a military spirit and he says see you you you have to stand straight and walk straight cut your corner see and everything it's military he said well then then you got the French they've got a national spirit and that's uh immorality it's an immoral Spirit women Wine Liquor and everything else Finland has a l or has a a national spirit and it's a loyal Spirit he said everything is honest we must pay everything off you know it must be done it's just got to be just that way no matter how hard they have to work what it cost it must be that way it's it's it's a loyal Spirit Well then America's got a national spirit and it's a spirit of Frolic amen and and I looked up that word Frolic and and it means to amuse oneself to make Merry uh uh to play and run and happily joking entertainment now is that not the spirit that we can see today everybody's got to be entertained everybody's got to be laughing nobody you can't be serious anymore you don't understand what I'm saying everybody cracking up a joke even even if it's the stupidest joke and I'm I'm leaving dad jokes out now you know uh uh uh uh uh dad jokes uh they think my children think my jokes are weird you know but uh I must be getting old you know and and so but but you know it it's just it's just comedy everything is entertainment children's got to be entertained parents got to be entertained churches got to be entertained everybody's got to be entertained today and and it's a it's it's you know I mean comedians or even having getting a place in behind the pulpits anymore uh to where whole services are left over to comedians is because there's so much entertainment it's a spirit of Frolic it's a national Spirit ain't that right amen but every nation is controlled by the devil amen uh for we find Luke 4 and 5 it it says the devil taking him speaking of Jesus into a high mountain show him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment's time and and and the devil said unto him all this power will I give unto thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever will I give it ain't that right so so we know that that that he showed Jesus all the kingdoms not just them current Kingdom that showed him the United States showed him all the all uh uh the superpowers all the way to the end of the world and he says these are mine and I will give them to you ain't that right so so then we know that these nations and and are in his power and and Paul would call him the God of this world he's the god of the Nations he's the he he he's he's it it's the he's It's all under his control so no matter what national spirit amen a nation would have they all are in ired of the devil now just just to say it that way uh brother Brown actually said these National Spirits they're demons amen National Spirits they're demons and and and they get jealous of one another and they cause War see the there's there's one National Spirit over here another National Spirit over there and another one over there and and then they get jealous of one another and Prophet said they just can't get along with one another ain't that right and and what is it each Nation wants to have their own way amen America wants its way and and and it sees it's it's it it just you know wants everything to see it its way you know and and and and Russia doing China everybody wanting to see it their own way and and and and so brother BR said see that's just the spirit of the Nations and now what are we looking at every nation is trying to get an atomic bomb amen and and uh uh even even the small Nations they're they're they're flexing their muscles and it it's just incredible uh uh so but but but Jesus would tell us that there would be wars and rumors of wars and and uh and and this will happen until Jesus comes ain't that right and the prophet said as long as Satan controls it there is going to be Wars and troubles and Wars nations are against Nations and they have fooled through God's Laboratory St until they have got the power to blow one another into Atomic ashes and they're Wicked and they're very unreligious and they're un Christlike and the only motive they have and the objective is to destroy amen how can you find peace amen When people's hearts are anointed to destroy amen you ain't going to find it ain't that right another place brother Brown says they they their power crazy nature is what they are and they're always trying to find something to kill somebody something that will outdo the next thing and beat the next nation and beat the next place and that's what they're trying to do ain't that right brother brandham he had talked about uh hunting I believe or being out in the north west uh uh the territories and uh uh there around Alaska or so and and um uh uh they had to use used dog sleds and and so they had um uh uh chained uh or they had stopped and and and so the guy had gotten his dogs and he was placing them separate keeping them everywhere and brother Bram said well why are you doing that and he he said well he says he they're they're full of the devil he said that's what they are he says they look to kill one another and he says they're all demon possessed and and things like that and and brother Brown said that's exactly right he says that's that's the devil he said he's a killer and and and he says see it's even Devils fighting one another they they just fight and and you look at what call what brings division in the home it's the devil that does that what brings division in the church what brings division in the family what brings division against God's word is the devil amen and then you find Republicans fighting one another it's the devil that does that amen Democrats fighting one another it's the devil that does that you understand what I'm saying amen everything it's it's just a doggy dog it's it's just a uh uh but but they're anointed of the devil and and so the nations are hungry today for power they're looking for a Superman and and and you know brother Bram told us that and and how true we're seeing this like like more reality of this than ever before uh the churches are looking for a Superman that's why they're all getting in politics and involving themselves cuz they're they're hungering for answers they're looking for someone to bring the peace that that that that they're they're needing and and and everything is is looking you know for for a superman but notice what a prophet said I loved it and and he says we've already got it we've already got the Superman amen the what the world is looking for we've already got it he said God gave us to it y'all know what it is it's God's promised word for the hour that's exactly what he said amen but isn't that how different it is that people looking for something that one God has to offer because it's not attractive it's not something that that that you know it takes people that are really hungering for real peace Amen to see the answer right before them it takes God ain't that right it's just like the world was looking for a conqueror they were looking for this they were looking for that and God gave them the answer he gave them a little baby in a Manger ain't that right amen it's so simple but it's right it's the answer to the world's problems and this message is the answer to the world problems you ain't going to get peace without this message just ain't going to happen ain't that right so in studying instead of studying peace they have studied War instead of studying righteousness they have studied uh uh Mischief ain't that right now we we've known for for for ages now that the people want World Peace amen and and but they don't know how to have peace and and so we we've uh uh brother BR said we tried Kings but that didn't work we tried dictators but that didn't work we tried democracy but but we see see it it doesn't work democracy brother Brown said is the best thing that that's ever happened is democracy but it won't work because the it's under Satan's control ain't that right see so he he says one each one seems to get a little bit shallower each time so so we had our first world war and and they thought this is it you know we finally got peace you know the first world war this is it and they organized the League of Nations and and and and they all began to settle down thinking all right now we've we've achieved peace and it wasn't but what 20 years or so after the the first world war we entered the second world war you know and and it just uh uh uh and and brother Bram said it's because of greed and jealousy amen jealousy and and so we we find a man that uh uh uh after uh R said after caser uh left Germany then here come the Australian Austrian named Adolf Adolf Hitler and he said he got the people's mind all scattered which is demon inspired and that they could whip the world you know and there you was it's devil against devil again see and the innocent subjects of those Nations see they just lead one another to war and it's to war and to war and to war now we're approaching World War II and it's going to happen do you believe it yes sir you bet it's going to happen and there ain't no politician going to stop it that's right amen see and and so uh uh you know uh and and and so when we look at this because brother said it's it's it's the cause of greed and jealousy and and jealousy uh uh we we all know it it comes from the devil and and and uh uh Lucifer is the is the one he's he started it there in heaven when he got jealous of God and and and it caused him to come against God and and we we know the division that he caused in heaven and and then it we see it upon earth when Cain uh which is Satan's son he he got uh jealous again of of the righteous Abel and caused him uh to kill Abel ain't that right then we find that Joseph's Brethren got jealous of him and they tried to get rid of him they sought to kill him and ended up uh uh selling him to uh uh to another nation and and then you down the road you you find that balum got jealous of Moses and and and you we all know about about them uh MOS or uh uh uh balum he was just as fundamental religious and right as as Moses was and had the seven altars had the seven Rams had the seven sacrifices and and everything just just as Israel did fundamentally ain't that right and and and Moab uh uh that that was with balum and and they were a great organization very organized and together as as a great nation and and but yet there was Israel SC Ed throughout amen the the the prairies and a bunch of tents and pilgrims and strangers seeking a city the prophet said strictly inter denominational ain't that right and and but they had signs and wonders following them and and and so uh uh uh we we we find that that uh balum and and the moabites they didn't have any of them signs they didn't have the pillar of fire they didn't have amen the Supernatural and it caused them to get jealous against Moses and against Israel and before you know it they sought to get rid of them and to destroy them and and and brother Ram said it was just Deon demonic spirits amen you travel on down and and how that Saul when the spirit of the Lord left Saul there was a spirit that was sent from God to anoint Saul amen and he become insane he he he he become a a a a a wild uh man and and here David was in the presence of Saul and the anointing would drop down amen because of David and Saul got jealous amen Saul got jealous of him and sought to kill him amen then you find that when Jesus come upon the Earth Judas amen sought to uh uh uh got jealous and uh betrayed Jesus ain't that right amen he was the son of predition and and then you see the denominations and how they were jealous of him they saw him doing the works they saw Jesus doing the sign of the Messiah they saw the people being healed and delivered and set free and all of a sudden a jealousy rose up among the church amen and they crucified him ain't that right so you know brother brandham says this the same thing today the Baptist wants to outdo the Methodist the Methodist wants to outdo the Lutheran the Lutheran wants to outdo the Catholic everybody wanting to outdo somebody you understand what I'm saying see and and it shows that they are anointed by an evil spirit now there are only two Powers at work today and we we know that and and I think it really takes the grace of God for us to really understand that that it's it's not the people it's it's it's it's powers and there's only two powers that work and one's a demonic power and one's a supernatural power one's a spiritual power of the Holy Ghost and and the other one is the devil that is working through intellectual power a ain't that right and so brother Brandon said now Satan's power is really not a real power but it's actually a perverted power that he takes God's power and perverts it he takes what God does and he perverts it ain't that right see like God's power takes a man and and makes a saint out of him ain't that right Satan takes that he can take that man and and by his power make him a sinner make him a renegade make him so evil and vile that the world don't want nothing to do with him you know see so God's power brings life Satan's power brings death amen but it's all a perversion God's power sets a man free Satan's power binds a man in in the chains of Darkness I I thought of how that churches ought to be uh uh be a place where Freedom Reigns and and the sound of freedom rings and and yet how many people set Bound in in even in churches today and and yet they're they're claiming to be Christians they're they're claiming to believe the Bible they're claiming but yet there's a power that is binding them maybe that bound them with complexes bound them with insecurities bound them with the past bound them with with lust bound them with all kinds of things amen and that man as long as he's bound he can't have peace amen he's he just can't have peace he's tormented for That's what Satan is is a Tormentor amen you can't get peace from torment ain't that right see so then we find that that these two Powers now you know the again the kingdoms of the world are dominated by the power of Satan and they're going to fight and and the prophet said he is the head of all political power everybody say that he's the head of of all political power I don't care who what side it is Republican Democrat independent or or non-existent I don't care he is the the the ruler of all political power can you say amen amen that's right see and so then we find that that that God now is bringing the prophet said he's bringing in the great Kingdom great civilization that'll be brought down under his own great Dominion oh my so this this city of peace that we're looking for is not under the domain of Satan but it's under the domain of God Amen there will be Never Be Another War Nations won't lift up Spears against Nations they'll all be peace and it will be an eternal peace now we can see by the scriptures just how close we are to this amen um you know I I I thought of uh Daniel in in the the chapter n and verse one it says in the first year of Darius the son of acerus uh of the seed of the M which was made King over the rim of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem now notice as his understanding he understood by the books and then he says and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplication with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes ain't that right why he was earnestly wanting to know where the time was he was diligent ly he wasn't out there just just uh in entertainment and wrapped up with the cares of life but he understood that time was close he understood what that that the there there would be an end to this captivity and and he was Yearning For Freedom he was yearning for these things see and and so therefore he got an understanding of the time he was living in amen he was living in a a country that he was an alien in it wasn't his country he didn't belong in it the prophet said he was OED from his people ousted from his church without uh uh one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be sang uh but what he Sayang himself in the midst of all of this still held on to what that Prophet said I want to ask you are you holding on to what that Prophet said I know that you people are diluting the prophet's words today and and and and they're they're they're misconstruing everything he said and and and putting it down like it was really nothing and and and taken part of it and well it's inspired and other parts ain't inspired and and and and and it's sad but but I guarantee you they wouldn't have done that when he was on the earth amen with his ministry I mean it was challenged all around the world come and Stand By Me and see you know you you let's just stand this and let's try this and not one would stand by him and and dispute it why because they knew that God was with that man they knew that there was an anointing amen that no other man had had Amen in in their denominations and in in in the church ages uh in in in as far as that goes you understand amen but they're doing it today but there was a man and and and just a very few that hung on to that prophet's words and and and by that prophet's words he he would know that time was short he he knew that that something had to give way amen see and so we find that that God showed amen Daniel that there wasn't a lot of time for his people the Jews and and and not only for the 70 weeks uh or or or uh in that time of captivity I think he had two years left or whatever amen but God would tell him he had 70 weeks left for the the the uh determined for thy people uh the Jews ain't that right I ain't going to get into all that but we know that the weeks uh are not considered like we would consider a week amen uh uh seven days in a week it it wasn't that at all but but the point is that I want to make is that God uh the prophet said God alloted them exactly a day an hour and time ain't that right amen he allotted that to them but God never did that to us gentiles he never allotted this and and the only thing he would say Luke 21 and 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive uh into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until everybody say until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled amen so so that leaves a wide margin as to when will that be fulfilled when will F the times of the Gentiles see so the times of the Gentiles is a mystery as to when it will be filled fulfilled but when it is fulfilled then God is finished with the gentile people do you believe that amen when it is fulfilled then God is finished with the gentile people then comes the Fulfillment of Revelations 2211 he that is unjust let him be unjust still let he that is filthy then let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still amen see so there is a time that is coming that that line is drawn amen and only God knows when that time is now but God the prophet said left us a signpost he left us a signpost and I I truly believe today that that God does not leave us ignorant the the scriptures revealed by the prophet of the hour does not leave us ignorant amen as to the day that we're living in ain't that right now uh uh just for a a few more moments and then we will close but the Book of Daniel talks about the Gentile kingdoms um as a as a whole uh uh King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and needed someone to interpret it and so so God showed the Prophet Daniel not only the dream but also the vision or the interpretation of the dream and and so Daniel 231 it says Thou oh King sawest and behold a great image and and this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible and this image's head was a fine gold and his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass and his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay amen so then the SE 37th verse thou oh king art a king of King of Kings and for the god of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the Beast of the field the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the Earth notice and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breth in in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breakthe shall it break in pieces and bruis so that's a a mighty uh uh that fourth kingdom is a mighty thing right aen a conqueror and whereas thou sawest the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided and there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with my Reay and the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with my clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with Clay amen now brother brandham talks about this a lot but but these are four Gentile kingdoms amen and and um uh of course Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar was the head of the gold and then you find that the MS of the Persians amen they came after amen and conquered and and they were the silver uh which is uh brother Bram said now is the Hindu of India uh there and then then after that there come uh the kingdom of the Greece uh which was the the brass uh Alexander the Great and then Rome everybody say Rome which was the fourth Kingdom the iron ain't that right and and it was in the feet and it ran in the toes and which would mean that this fourth Kingdom uh uh would uh uh exist all the way to the end amen of the Gentile dispensation ain't that right now the different Golds or or Metals here uh Gold Silver and and uh uh brass and iron each one it starts with the softest but it ALS it gets harder so gold is is softer and then silver is a little harder than gold and Brass is harder than silver and and iron is the hardest of them all and and notice what iron symbolizes in the Bible it is symbolizes chastisement Affliction uh Deuteronomy 4:20 it also symbolizes slavery uh Deuteronomy 28 and uh 48 it also symbolizes strength um uh job 40 and 18 it it symbolizes political strength uh Daniel 2:33 and and uh symbolizes fortitude uh Jeremiah 1:18 it also symbolizes moral de deterioration Jeremiah 6:28 and and then it did uh uh uh it it it symbolizes destructive power uh found there in Daniel 7:7 and so uh Nebuchadnezzar he thought that the kingdom I mean we all know I guess most of us know his story got lifted up in Pride and as he was looking at his kingdom and he thought man I built all this and he thought it was a great Kingdom and he he actually thought that that nothing could defeat him and and of course in all reality they they probably shouldn't have but we found that someone left the gate open uh and and the enemy come through that gate and I bet it was all planned of God because it was all in Prophecy because no Kingdom can last here we have no continuing City ain't that right and and so we we find that he thought it would be that way but here comes the mes and the Persians and and the prophet said they were just as ruthless and ungodly as Russia and they came in through that gate and conquer ain't that right and so all three of these kingdoms the the the gold silver and and Brass they've been conquered they they are a thing of History amen uh you you read about these nations in history and and the glory of them and all of that because here we have no continuing City so these were not would be not the cities that we are looking for and and and so you you you can study them and and and but yet it doesn't benefit F us to try to resurrect them because God has showed us that these kingdoms no matter how great they would seem to be and no matter how much of a superpower and no matter how much they rule the world and how long they rule the world they have to come to its end can you sayen so then we find that Rome being the fourth Kingdom runs all the way out to the End Amen and and and and I have to say church and and I know you know these things amen but we are living in the in if I could say it this way the day of the tolls we are living at the end how many believes that amen we're living at the end and and it's amazing that even the the prophet would give us he said I'm going to give you let you in on a little secret here and he and he he talked about the the the meeting that uh uh the the Russian president I can't remember his name uh back then and Eisenhower where they met uh what was ITF Cru amen uh the president kusf and and how that they they had this meeting and was it kusf that took off his shoe and beat the table with amen and and brother Brown says see right there is a sign to us in the age that we're living in he said I eisenh means what clay iron Eisenhower meant iron and and uh uh the other one meant clay and and they couldn't mingle they couldn't mix there there there and brother Bram said that's a sign to us in the day that's just one of the signs ain't that right amen see and so iron and Clay what is that it's romanism the prophet said and Protestant mixed together ain't that right he said Protestant and Catholicism under the same Gentile domination and he said that even they would even try to break one another's power and they would intermar with one another just exactly what they are doing today aren't you glad for a prophet amen to let us know where we're at living at in the image of of of of that that had been prophesied years and years and years ago thousands of years ago ain't that right and and the prophet said that hard iron dominated over the other and we're seeing that exactly take place Amen to where the Protestants are now looking and going back to mother a ain't that right these things are Bible is being fulfilled right and left before our eyes you believe that now so so we look now amen that these nations these the had a power behind it and and Daniel 7 And1 it says in the first year of belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed uh then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision By Night amen Behold The Four Winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea and four great Beast came from the up from the sea diverse from one another the first was like a lion and had Eagle wings and I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made uh and and made uh stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it and behold another Beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had uh three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh and after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a foul the Beast had also fourheads and Dominion was given to it ain't that right so here's three Beast uh that Daniel that we've read about that Daniel mentions and of course the prophet tells us that Beast represents what power Beast represents power so each one of these kingdoms dominated the World by their power and and and and and I if I had time I'd go and and and and and compare what Nebuchadnezzar was and and these uh and and how he fit that perfectly uh of the the first like a lion had Eagle's Wings and and things like that and and and things like that but but all these nations they devoured and they conquered ain't that right so Nebuchadnezzar amen his power was again the first was like a lion that had Eagle wings the second like to a bear and it was told to arise and devour much flesh which was the mes and the Persians and the third like a leopard and and Dominion was given to it which was Alexander the Great and and and if you notice each of these animals are animals of of prey they they are Hunters ain't that right and and they it's it's a power of the devil that that was running these kingdoms can you say amen amen and brother Brandon said they are national Powers now in the opening of the seals you'll see that that them the the the the church Powers hello the white horse rider the red hor the red horse rider the black horse rider and the pale horse rider can you say Amen but these are National powers that have been driving the Nations and they are demonic Powers amen ain't that right but see here we have no continuing City so no matter what Satan does and how he can raise up a kingdom and establish it and make it look so secure there will be no peace amen praise the lord we have even been raised as a superpower in this nation it's a superpower and look we're all constantly having to watch our back can you say amen amen see and so therefore Daniel was beholding the nature and characteristics of these kingdoms and the powers that dominated the kingdom now what power is dominating the world today let's look at the fourth power and and in the seventh verse it says after this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly ain't that right and it had great iron teeth it divided and break in pieces and amp the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns amen so we know that this is Rome ain't that right and the power of that iron that fourth Beast that fourth Kingdom this is the power of it the Beast that he saw Dreadful terrible strong exceedingly had great iron teeth it divid fired it break and stamped the residue with the feet of it ain't that right it was this power was diverse from any other power before it ain't that right you can even look at at Titus when he and and just for example but you could take a history of Rome but when Titus took over Jerusalem history says that the blood ran like Rivers ain't that right and notice how how that when when it come over uh Matthew 24:2 Jesus said unto them see see ye not all these things verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down when Titus in Jo Josephus history Titus made them dig all the way down break them Stones I mean they were all stone walls of Jerusalem he made them tear every stone one by one apart and then dig down all the way to the foundation to make sure that nothing was left all right true that's that beast and he starved history says he starved the chill or the people out to where that they ate their own children brother Brown says see they bowled one another's children and eat it and they they ate the bark of uh of off the trees and the grass off the ground and then they finally had to give up see Titus went in there and he utterly destroyed everything in there killed women children babies priests everything else and then burnt the city ain't that right see what was it it was Pagan Rome it was also Pagan Rome that killed all the children to and under in in trying to find uh when Jesus was born ain't that right amen see then it was also uh Rome under Nero that that uh Nero that that persecuted the Christians and history says that he hooked his mother to a single tree of a horse and Drug her through the streets and set the city of fire and while doing that he played his fiddle up on the hill you know and and he say see it's that same kind of a spirit that's dominating the church that sits in the place of pagan ain't that right see so so we we find that in another place Christians were covered with hides of wild beast and bitten to death by dogs nailed to crosses at night time they were burned to serve as a light in in Nero's courty yard and while he played the fiddle see and all of this was a National Power a National Power and and a demonic ain't that right now if you turn uh we look in in Revelations 13:1 John saw that same fourth beast and we'll we'll hurry here uh uh he saw the same Beast that Daniel saw and he says and I stood and and upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads a beast of pray it was a beast of prey and ungodly power the prophet said having 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head uh heads the name of blasphemy and we won't go into all that today but but it's it's the fourth beast and brother Braham said it's a power everybody say it's a power rising up amongst the people ain't that right for Waters represent people ain't that right so so then then we we find that John's Visions here showed that the prophet said showed that it was Powers Nations rising up but notice that fourth Beast that Daniel or that John is seeing and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leper and his feet were as the feet of a bear and the his mouth as the mouth of a lion hello so all the powers before it was wrapped up in this one right true and the dragons which was Satan gave him his power and his seat and great Authority so it had four different characters in this Force beast and this is where we're living today at the beginning of the Gentile dispensation Daniel saw four be separated at the end of the Gentile dispensation John sees it all gather together in that fourth Beast ain't that right so brother Bram said see John seeing it and the end of the Gentile ruling all four of those beasts represented one see the same old Devils demons that possessed each kingdom of the Romans down through the Greeks and so forth down through the Gentile dispensation has come right down and all of them have met up in one Beast talking about the lid of hell being poured out on This Nation can you imagine what we're dealing with what is consuming this world what's causing this thing to fall apart and everything going crazy can you sayen now that was Pagan Rome but then we find that John would go on to say in the third verse 13 chapter and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death which was what we know as paganism Pagan Rome it looks like it died but according to Daniel's prophecy it couldn't die because it had to go all the way to the end of the Gentile dispensation can you say Amen the T toes that's right see so you know brother Brown said see when it died when Pagan Rome died the world thought that it was over that that Rome could not rule anymore anymore and and and and history says that Rome fell you know uh uh The Barbarians and things uh uh uh uh conquered conquered Rome and she Brother Brad said she lost her temporary power notice how he says it this didn't say she lost her power she lost her temporary power he says the nation that ruled by crushing all which became the strongest ow ever known was finally wounded to death her power was physically gone as to control by armies Etc can you say Amen but then Daniel would say or John would say and his deadly wound was healed and brother BR said what was that it was now the Church paple Rome see take them the place joined with Christianity with the Nicol itans and the world and all the world John said wandered after the Beast they marveled after the beast but she lived again she was wounded to death Pagan Rome died but the wound was healed when she become a church can you say Amen so brother Bram would tell us that Nan Council swung the power of political Rome to the church and once it did that same demons same everything but notice once it did that there were no limits to which this First Christian Church would go to No Limits the name Christianity or name Christian which originally brought persecution upon the Christians just to say that you're a Christian it brought persecution now became the name of the persecutors yes amen what a prophet said but under Constantine she came back to life for Papa Rome has infiltrated now it shows that we're at the toes now it's infiltrated through the whole world and her power is absolute she uses Kings and Merchants and in her deadly religious financial and financial strength she is governing as the goddess of this present age amen he says here people look at Rome they look at the nation of Italy and as they as they look they do not realize that Rome with her strict confines where the pope has an actual area as his domain is literally a nation within a nation and she has ambassadors and receives ambassadors and every every president that I've in my lifetime anyway is all as soon as they somewhere soon as they get in in the office they automatically go to Rome Papo false Christian Rome he says she even is even called at the Eternal City think of that her power is so great her influence is so great that she calls herself an eternal City but that's not the city that we're looking for ain't that right right and so she even she is even called The Eternal City city how Blasphemous Now controls by religion even more aily her control is even more able than when Pagan Imperial Rome controlled by the pure iron of force ain't that amazing see so Rome to Rome took on a new lease of life when Constantine joined church and state and back the Union by force the spirit that motivated Pagan Rome is the same spirit that now motivates false Christian Rome can you say Amen now you you you'll begin to understand why we are against denominations amen can you say amen amen see you you can see that it is so because you now know that the fourth Empire never went out of existence but it just changed it in its outer texture ain't that right so now notice what did political Pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success she divided and conquered can you say that with me divided and conquered that's what Pagan Rome did that was her success she divided and conquered see that was the seed of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth uh tore and deved whom she tore and deved could not rise again as when she destroyed Carthage and swed her to Salt see and the same notice the same iron seed remained in her when she arose as the false church and her policy has remained the same divide and coner hello and when she devided the Lutheran they've never Rosen again and when she devoured the wlans they never rose again and when she devoured the Pentecostals they've never risen again they're crying for Revival Revival Revival but they'll never rise again can you say Amen why her influence has got in there amen this nation will never rise again her influence has got into the nation that is true amen ain't that right divide and conquer divide and conquer we've never had so much division in in this land than ever before divide and conquer amen ain't that right and power was given to him remember that set there on to take peace from the earth is that not found in the seals that same spirit that red riter that's right come on now power was given unto him to take peace from the Earth all right is he still not here all them four all them four powers of line are are mixed up in this age can you say Amen that they should kill one another and they would and there was given unto him a great sword ain't that right we could go on and on but notice in that fourth verse uh Revelations 13:4 and they wor worship the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast and notice it's it's in this time that they worship and Satan has become the god of this Earth and we all know that Satan will be incarnate in a man one of these days and it ain't going to be much longer can you say Amen which gave power un the Beast they worshiped the Beast saying who is liken to the Beast amen who is able to make war with him they look at this thing as some Eternal substance who is able to defeat him who is able to survive or or or uh yes to survive when they come against him he seems Immortal brother Ram said there's not one man in the world that's got to say so that the pope of Rome has he says the president iron Heiser can speak in the United States and its law but other nations he can speak into and it's nothing but the but but the Catholic hierarchy can speak in Rome and every Every Nation will holler to it he said there's one one man that's big everywhere and that's the pope yes sir can you say amen he has the power to stop Wars he has the power to stop things amen don't think that he's not behind things that are going on in this world that's right he knows it's he's he's there's something going on can you say Amen yes sir amen but here we are we we we show it shows that we're living in the time of the T toe brother Bri said cath Catholicism has swept into every nation under the heavens ain't that right but as we close we look for a city amen an eternal city of Peace how is this to happen what what what is this and we didn't read the rest of it so we'll read it but Daniel saw a stone when he saw that whole all the Gentile kingdoms and he saw that Rome coming through the end of the toes there he saw a stone that stone was cut out of the mountain without hands amen now we you and I all know who that is that's Christ the Virgin birth the Lord right Born of a virgin had nothing to do man-made had nothing to do about man that's right and this Stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and smok that image upon his feet that's right that were of iron iron and clay and break them to Pieces Lord then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place everybody say no place was found for them amen not going to be inable be able to infiltrate themselves them Spirits through the kingdoms like they did in this fourth Kingdom there is no place found for them and the stone with that smok that image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth Daniel 244 it says in the days of the Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom that which will never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay or the silver and the gold and the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof Shore no wonder Daniel after seeing everything he saw all the end of the he saw the church ages all through it and saw at the end of it and there he was at the in our day he was caught up in the day of the Lord that when he saw it all he could say even so Lord Jesus come amen even so Lord Jesus and all I got to say is we're in the day of the stone the stone has come the stone can you say amen amen do you love him I wish I had more
