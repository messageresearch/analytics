of goes no but uh uh I sure love my wife and appreciate her I don't know what I'd do without her amen I wanted to by the help of help the Lord tonight is I wanted to speak on for a little for for just a few minutes on on step in into division and uh um this thought's been on my heart for uh um a couple months now so um I'm sorry if it seems chopped up I'm I'm feel kind of scattered tonight so you all just have to help me out here um but but I I kind of wanted to take the thought back from uh Michelangelo when he when he's um when he when when he when he um when he scoped the image of of of of Moses and um and if you any if you've heard the message the the the Masterpiece you you you you uh you uh you you know you know all the background will go down from this but Michelangelo had spent a lifetime of of of of of of of of of trying to make this this this statue this image that he had in his head of Moses and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and we noticed that was what was in the back of his mind he he would sit there and he would he he picked out this slab of marble or granite or whatever it was he used and he sat there and studied it and studied it and then he would come up and and uh he would take his hammer and chisel and he would he would knock a little bit off he'd back up again and just study it and then you come back and and and he chose a little bit more he said he said it was a lifetime of of of of of of of of of of an achievement of of of of of of of of his his work and dedication because it was burned in His image in his back his head so hard of what he wanted and and year after year after year he he he he he he um he uh worked on this and and and and and and and and at the end of it all he he step back and he laid down his his Amber in the Chisel and what he's seen while that was in the back of his head now became manifested into him in a physical form of the stone and he got he got so inspired that they took a hammer and he struck the kneecap of that statue and said speak and it's called Michelangelo's to be saying he said it wasn't necessarily just as just the statue that was the Masterpiece but it was the inspiration of him actually striking that kneecap they called it the Masterpiece because of that strike on the knee because he had such an inspiration and such a vision and and what was in the back he said um he became manifested into a physical form and he and and and and in front of his his head and uh and uh um and and brother Brandon what would would go back and he he he he would start he would he he would start speaking about this he would said and how how how did that how that that that that was a perfect type of of Christ and and and all throughout throughout the Old Testament he he he he he he was he was he was protest portrayed throughout the the the the the the the old the Old Testament I'm sorry guys y'all's gonna have to help me out here I'm I don't know why I'm doing this so bad tonight a foreshadow and just an image of what was Christ in the Old Testament he he became he became the Masterpiece in the New Testament where he was just a rock in the wilderness whereas the water coming out of that rock where where he where he he it was just a stone it was it was a stone that had not come in into into its its its Perfection yet but but it was it was a it was a type and and a follow it followed Israel Israel Israel throughout throughout the Wilderness and it would give life and it would give it it would give it would give water to to those that were thirsty in that drying bearing land but he was the he was the Rocky and he was that rock in the wilderness where where he where he he had not been made into a man yet but he was only a type and a shadow what was to come Moses Moses Moses Moses Moses was standing there and he asked God he hey so one thing that I want to do in my flesh he said is I want to see God and and and God told him to go and go and stand over here and and to watch me as I passed by and but when he passed by all he seen was it was the back part of the man but you see you see the great sculpture was was presenting to to to to to to to to Moses the potential image of Christ of what that Great Masterpiece peace peace peace would look like would look like when it was when it was um um um um it wasn't the it wasn't a fully manifested image yet but but it was just a glimpse up of what of of what was to come but but but but but but but see but see but see but see my my Michelangelo who when he got so inspired he could only cry out and smite the image and say speak but how different it was to God when when that great when when him as the master as the master sculpture he went went when he's when he saw when we win winning when that image I was in the back of back of his mind as Christ and it became so perfect and it reflected it was God himself himself coming into man it was a perfect image of Christ and God spoed him and said speak and and slowed him on Calvary why why it was for us as the Bride of Jesus Christ throughout all the history the the um the the the prophets and the and the people of Israel through old they they were not in their full image yet they they they they they they they were all just in their in their in their potential image they he he he he he he um about what they were doing is they were foreshadowing and showing what what was to come but see he started down in the feet and he began working he he began working his way up forming and shaping this masterpiece until until he got to Christ and it was the fullness of that man of that Masterpiece was manifested that was in the back of God's mind it became manifested right there right there as Jesus Christ crisis so what was in the back of his mind all of a sudden the fullness of that manifestation was their anger God and God slowed him and God smoked him for us on on on on on on on Calvary so so see he was the Masterpiece to us he was the gift of God it was the gift of God it was it was eternal life to us throughout throughout the Bible about the Bible it was prophesied that that that that that that that that that that Christ that Christ was coming and and and and God's seen in his mind him sending Christ to die and and and and you know what no no no no no no no no no no no doubts since since um Isaiah since Isaiah prophesied that that that that that that there would be a virgin a virgin a virgin to to conceive no doubt since since Isaiah's time all the way all the way throughout throughout till um sorry since since Christ came that that these um so I'm choking up for some reason these um these these these virgins would would say oh it's going to be me I'm gonna be the one two two two two two half Christ and and and yet but yet but yeah but yeah when it came when it came down to Mary and and and and and and that angel and that angel that angel assists that angel stood stood before her and said fear not four four four four four four four four four four four four four four for you for you for you have been chosen chosen chosen for this thing and and and and even though she said she said she said why me I'm I'm just an insignificant and again insignificance nobody but yet when she seen herself in that word she she was able to she was able to step in into the vision of what God called her her what God called her to be and she said be it unto me according according according to Thy Word so so so so so now for for nearly for nearly two thousand years now now God has been making himself once again another Masterpiece because because because when when when when when when when he when he struck Adam Adam and the Garden of Eden he he uh he uh he uh took a piece off of him and he fashioned another Masterpiece he fashioned Eve and to where she became a perfect uh a perfect help me uh perfect help me and and and and uh brother Branham said that she was perfect and and and and and in every way but yet but but yet but yet but yet she she fell so so so so so God had to make had to make himself another Masterpiece and and when and when he smoked when he smoked Christ on Calvary he he he took that piece that he swung off of him and now he's been now he's been fashioning for the last two thousand years another Masterpiece to where she's coming up and she and he started at the feet in Luther and on up on up into the head and it's become a perfect Masterpiece and we're and she's called The Bride of Jesus Christ said that the Old Testament which was which was the foreshadowing of Christ and the new testament which was the foreshadowing of the Bride he he he said he he said he said she has now become husband or wife it's the old what was or was the old one was to foreshadow his shadow was to us two four shots shadow the the new and Christ come in Christ come the the the the he came out as the Masterpiece the Damascus to to to to fulfill his part but but now the his brother the bride is coming forth and she will fulfill everything that in the New Testament making another Masterpiece it is where another Masterpiece in the making and and just just as it's taken him four thousand years four thousand years to to to make to make to make to make to make this this this masterpiece now now he's been for for another for another two thousand years years he's making he's making this this this this this this other Muhammad Masterpiece as as the body of Jesus Christ and the doing so he he's doing it by his never-changing change changing changing method so so he so if if by his word if if by his word he he created he created the the first the first uh first Masterpiece then by his word he's creating the second Masterpiece and because because his word is perfect it can only be perfect this masterpiece that's coming up she's become a virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ so so any kind of dirt or trash or or injections injections of the denominations it won't fly because why because it has to be pure and perfect in the is standing in the word of God you gotta remember and and when when when we make a diamond he you a diamond won't cut uh are you nothing can can can can can can can cut a diamond at all there's nothing there's no there's nothing else else in the world that can cut it except for another Diamond but see not not just any kind of diamond will do it that diamond has to be has to be perfect weighed in in in in in in in in order in order for it to cut it and where where so that way there that they're the only thing that would ever shape this bride that will ever mold this bride will be the same material that the bride that that this bride is is that this bride is made out of so so if if God's word is a diamond the diamond and the bride and the bright then the bride has to be a diamond why because she's part of it it's the same person we're just taken out of Christ and now he's fashioning us and making us into the into the Bride of Jesus Christ he said I am God and I changed not so he cannot change his his his method who what he did back then he has to do the same thing today and and so so so so so so we noticed that he started out on the day on the day of of of Pentecost just just like what brother Terry was was was preaching this morning on but he started he started on the Day of Dead benecost to to to build another Masterpiece it was the original seed it started it started it started in the first church what was that what was that for sure church it was just a seed that was planted in the ground and it came to come up and grow up and and and and and and and and and and and throughout history it's it's it it's come up and now it's and now it's coming to a full manifestation as a full seed of wheat why why because because it's the Harvest time it's going home time what we what we what what we were what we were in the force out of what we were to be now we're coming forth and we're standing here as a perfect spotless bride of Jesus Christ why it's his Masterpiece or what he spent the last four thousand years doing is now becoming manifested in flesh today on on Earth so so so so so so so we we we we we we we we notice we notice that there are two groups of of of people of people in the world today we we have the world and we have the bride it's just it's just putting it simply and and and and and and and and we know that God sees the world in one light and he sees us in in in in in a totally different light and and so so so so so so so so so so so so so when it was so we went when when when when when he sees the world he sees them as cannon fodder as well as as how brother random as how as our brother Branham put it but yeah well he asked the Bride of Jesus Christ when when he sees us he doesn't see us us us us as as a sinner he doesn't see us as as an alcoholic or as a druggie or or as an addict what he sees it says uh as is sinless we never did Sin in the first place and we can never since this is in afterwards why because God doesn't see God does not see this sins our lives he does not see see our imperfections when we stand before him we stand as a masterpiece who has a masterpiece so so God sees us as a redeemed son and daughter of God he sees us he sees us as his spotless bride but so so so so so so so we are his Masterpiece who win who win and he cries out speak and we go forward for with full Authority and full power knowing that that whatsoever we have we have we that we have have have need of of he is there he is there he is there too too fulfill to fulfill all things and uh Romans chapter 8 8 verse 27 it says hate that searches search at the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because because he maketh because he maketh intercessions intercessions for for intercessions intercessions sessions for this I can't say that right now according according according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are who are called according to his poor purpose and and and and and and and and and here in this here in verse 29 says for whom he did he did he did for no he also did predestinate to to to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among uh firstborn among many many many many Brethren four four whoever whom he did press to be destined then he also called and whom he called them them them he he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so so so so so so so so not only so so before the foundation of the world he he he is set aside brother Amos and and brother Bill and and sister Faith and all the uh and all all these brothers and sisters of this bride of Jesus Christ he's predestinated and he set him aside and set him apart and to to to shape them and conform them into the image of his son and why it was it would be another another Masterpiece why he he's called us and when he called us he justified and when he died and when he in and when he justified us it's as if we never did it did it did it did it it does if we never did it in the in in in in the first place why because why because and so now that he's Justified us he's going glorify this to where we are becoming as the as The Virtue is spotless brought to Jesus Christ but and um brother Branham said he said it says it said it says that he he he he he he he he he said I'm using this in a parable now of the Bible he said the Masterpiece the Masterpiece that that's coming forth as the Masterpiece fell there is a masterpiece Rising the Masterpiece the Beast of the Masterpiece fell at at and I see a Rome he said he said he he said he said after after night after night night see a Rome Rome he said she's come through a process but she's coming right back again to that Masterpiece perfected because she's a part of the word that was spoken by him he'll have a church without spot or wrinkle and and then he keeps on going and and says when he comes who or when he come he was in the fullness of the Kings the the of the fullness of the Kings and Prophets Hallelujah the godhead the godhead bodily rested in him and he and he and he comes to come to redeem out of their bride a masterpiece a masterpiece that says that says that says that says to to Satan that that he said a masterpiece that says to say says to Satan that when he says the days of Miracles have passed there's no such thing as these things that that that no such thing no such thing as these things that that you're talking about yeah and he says he he so he says he says get the get the get thee behind me Satan see see a masterpiece standing and guarding and he says sometimes the Capstone will be turned the head of it all and receive the bride on unto unto unto he himself so so so so so so so so so so now we realize now that that mankind in general is is is is is is a prisoner everything God God said God said that that that a man that a man that a man was a prisoner and so so until until something has happened has happened to the man man man man this was this was before the new birth but after the New Birth whatever whatever happens whatever happens happens happens to the man God God can come down in person and show this man man the the very the the very secrets and the depths and the depths of his heart but that that man can never can never see it he'll never understand it why because because our thoughts are not his thoughts our ways are not his ways him but so so so so uh until the Holy Ghost came came who there's no way there's no way we'd ever we would ever we would ever ever understand it so so we're our prisoner to our own selves but because because it's the human mind our minds can't comprehend the things that God ever but but but so all the so all the schools would go to all the readings all the teachings as good as as good as they may be they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're useless because because without the Holy Ghost the ghost ghost you will never understand God but and but see mankind has to see himself as God sees them otherwise uh otherwise otherwise we'll constantly just beat ourselves up and be constantly dead down down down down down and down the dumps all the time oh always depressed saying I'll never I'll never be worthy I'll never make it up God doesn't love me anymore God doesn't like me anymore why because because of how much of a wretch I am and and and and yet we look at the Pharisees the the Pharisees of that day they had they had the law down to the letter that they were perfect in every way that you could possibly think of but yet but yet God still God he got God God said God said God God said you're nothing but full of Dead Man's Bones why why because because he blinded their eyes their eyes I eyes even though he performed the Miracles he performed the signs and the Wonders they can never catch they can never catch what what what what what what what what what what what God was and and so and it's the same same exact thing thing again again today people will say well that's just brother Brown's opinion he he he didn't real um he or or or or or or or or or or he he made him made a mistake here or or or or or or or or or or or or this is just his opinion there but see the eyes of the car on the mind they will never understand the things of God they will try they will fight against him and fight against it and fight against it but until you get that that Holy Ghost until you get the Holy Ghost down inside you and becomes a revelation on on on on on on on on on on to you you'll just have to spin your wheels although all day every day why because the human mind isn't isn't it it is is is enmity against God why why because you got to get out of your own your your your human mind and in human thoughts and then it's got to be it's got to be it's got to be burned away and you got to be born Born Again Born Again Born Again by the Holy Spirit and get the mind of God the mind of God in you in First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 says but the natural man receiveth not receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness on on on on to him him and it says it says neither neither can't neither can he he know them because they are spiritually they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is Judge of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that we may instruct him but it says we have the mind of Christ so us as the body of Jesus Christ so he will be because because because it has become a personal revelation we have been conformed into into into into into his his into into into his his image and his breathed the Breath of Life uh the Breath of Life of a breath of life in into us now now we can go forth with authority and power and stand and stand and stand on on every Divine promise of God and we can have the mind of God why why why because we see we can look around us we can see the signs of the time we can see what God said about us we can we can see we see ourselves in the vision of what God had for us since since abomination of the world and we can stand stand strong on that promise knowing that that he that that he that he that he who hath promised him is faithful and just to keep that promise um so so in uh in in uh in John Chapter 14 verse 11 it says it says believe me that I am in the father and the father and me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily I say I say uh on on on to to you he he that he he that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it and in Mark in Mark chapter 16 verse 17 it says and these signs shall follow them that that that that that that that that that that that that belief in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and they drink any deadly thing it shall not it shall not it shall not hurt them and and they shall they shall lay hands and hands on the sick and they shall recover and so we notice we can we can look here by the scriptures that says that says those who are called by his name and we've been conformed Into His Image where we can stand strong without my heart on on on on on on on the word of God and we can see what's promised for us in these last days where where where where he said whatsoever things ye shall ask of you speak unto this mountain and and not doubt it shall it shall it shall be cast shall be cast in in into the sea why because because because we become the Masterpiece and we're seeing our place and we're seeing what we're what we're called to be called to be the the the the world the world we we we we we we we look around us in the world is falling apart left and right but but but but but see she's falling into into into her her place whether she sees it or not she's falling in line with the word why because she has to but and she's right now ripe right before the Judgment as as as as brother Randall as as brother random put it but see the bride is also falling in and into into her place but but yet the difference between the Bride of the world is she has her eyes wide open and she sees exactly who and she sees exactly what's what's what's what's what's what's what's what's what's what's what's what she sees exactly what's going on and and and and but and and and so so she can stand on the word of God and and she can speak with full Authority and full power but you know what the bride the bride never goes never goes in into judgment she she she so so as the world is it is is going down into a tribulation and and and and and into a judgment the bride is going up into the Rapture and and and and and and to into into into everlasting life why why because because it's what she's called to be and she's recognizing and recognizing her place and stepping into the vision of what God has and what God has for and she's becoming uh the the the the she has become the Masterpiece that God has has has has has has uh created um so so so so so so but you notice God never never ever had us in the book of judgment he he he's always had us in the Lamb's Book of Life since before the foundation of the world so so so what it's what God sees us as he's never seen us has a sinner he's never seen us he's never seen us as as as as as somebody who who who who was barely getting by or or or or or or or or or um who who struggles to pray or or or or or or or whatever you need you're an issue your issue your issue may may may be and see he he's never seen us as that why because because down in the Lamb's Book of Life says before the foundation of the world all he reads on that book is spotless and he sees my name he sees brother Terry's name he sees brother Walker's name on that Lamb's Buck live and he can't help he can't see anything else about that why because why baby because because it were predestinated to it Hawaii even though even though we may be struggling who we may be fighting our day-to-day battles but but we're coming into a place where where we're realizing that now now we're realizing hold on a second I'm not just I'm not just just I'm not the same as my next-door neighbor I'm not the same as as my co-workers on the job site I am not the same same as the last as the lady as the lady at the at the checkout store why be why because we were realizing that we're predestinated for something different and when we're waking up and we're stepping into that position and we're seeing what we're called to be why we're called we are called to to be The Virtuous spotless Sprite of Jesus Christ and and there's nothing there's nothing in that now now now there's nothing now that can take this bride down but why she she she's coming she stepped into her position and she has the full Authority and power of the word backing her up and and the vision and the vision of of the of of that uh brother random had of uh from from Beyond the carton of time or or well he wasn't a vision necessarily he was actually there and and and and and and when he come back he says he says I've seen all of you there now now no no no no no no no no no no now now we realize now that that he wasn't talking about just the members of that congregation that was sitting there he's seen he's seen all of us on on on the other side he he he's saying he's saying he's saying um um brother shamaya and all these others and while uh others uh others all these others in a in a perfect state in a perfect body body standing there on the other side why and soon very soon now because because we're right for it we're coming into the Fulfillment of of that too we're seeing where we're at and we're stepping in in in and we're stepping in in in and we're stepping into it and one day we're gonna take another step and we're going to be gone why because because it's becoming manifested to us it's becoming such a reality to us to to to wear to where our everyday life is just almost seems fake anymore it's it's not real we look at the world it's just falling apart at the seams it's busting at the seams this is the most it's the most insane age I've ever seen in my life where there's there's there's there's there's satanic and there's demons it's almost like like like like a little like they've actually become a manifested thing on some of the stuff that we see day in and day out but see but see we can step back and when we can look around us and and realize that that hold on this is not my home I'm just passing through and Justin today now we're realizing that that that that we're that we're going Beyond we're going Beyond this is this this whole moral flesh we're going beyond beyond both our human mind can comprehend worldwide is saying soon and soon someday soon God's going to come down and Rapture us out of here we're going back and into that into that Edom condition where where where Adam and Eve were there and they had perfect rain where we're neither death nor sorrow we could go good good good good good good good um um it is random if you've gotten a little chilly one day day hey hey hey hey hey hey hey and Adam won't just speak out wind be still or or if you would say man I wish I had some more Sunshine over here Adam would just take a tree and uproot it and move it and 30 yards to the left where he where he became it became such a perfect a perfect place a perfect Lane and yet and yet when Adam and Eve fell God drove them away from it but now since Calvary and since we have come into this Perfection of the manifested son and daughter of God go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go there's no longer driving man from him but he's turning around and he's placing his bride right in the middle of it again why everybody because we're not we're not coming forth as a week helpless bride we won't be like that for Steve Eve that first Steve who who who fell in because she disbelieved God's word why people are stepping forth as the most powerful Army to ever come whoever come on the face of the planet why we're coming we're coming now into our position hey we're realizing just who we are and we're gonna run without rock that bride the the cry that has gone forth that has gone forth has gone forth from from the bridegroom and says wake up wake up for the bride's gonna cometh and worse now standing in our positions with our limps our lamps trimmed and well now we're going forth to meet the bride's groom why because when we're saying so now we're standing and we're realizing just exactly what's going on I we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're standing with our lamps trimmed and just any day now we're going to go meet our Lord in the air why could she step into the vision of what God has had for her since the foundation of the world is he he he he he he he he doesn't see us as as as the World As the World As the World sees us he the the world might see me and say that's just Josiah he's just a contractor and then and he and he's just a good old boy down the street at least I hope most of them think that but but yeah but yeah he he he he doesn't he he he he he he God doesn't just see me as his Carpenter receiver that Kevin has a carpenter or or or he doesn't see us as that he sees us as Perfection he sees us that has The Perfect sinless Bride of Jesus Christ he's never seen us as Sinners he he he's he he's never seen us as a as a drunk or a druggie or as an addict or as a or as a cussing swearing um um sinner who was so Godless that that that that that that that that you make a savior blush he's never seen us as that he's always seen this that's spotless The Virtue is brought to Jesus Christ but we have to take his mind in order to get anywhere anywhere with God why why his um so this is so be noticed that brother Branham you notice and the Visions that's um that uh that uh in the Visions he would have and he he he told the story and and I never could could could get the significance of it and then it kind of jumped out out to out out at me the other days the other day as as I was studying on this and and and and you notice he he had a vision one time he was he was in his bedroom and he was the boy that was that was screaming and screaming it was like it was like days and um he uh seen a vision and I'm paraphrasing this because because I don't have it written down or nothing so I'm just clarifying this and he had this vision and and he seemed like a grandma sitting there and the mom and dad sitting there and he said the dad was leaning up against the wall and the mother was sitting in the chair cleaning glasses and he walked in and he prayed for the child and the child got well well well well he he told his wife about it and they're sitting there eating breakfast I think it was and then and then and then and then all of a sudden he got this knock on the door and it was when he opened the door he realized it was the dad that he's seen in the vision that morning and and the dad said you know you know we come our turn baby something blue in the face it won't stop crying it's not breathing right so brother Brown says of course so he jumps in and or he he rides with the dad down there and he just walks in grabs the baby and prays for it and he said it got worse and and he realized he didn't wait for that Vision to be fulfilled yet he he jumped ahead ahead of of of the vision and I can't remember how long it was he stayed there but I it was all night long and and it was it was part of into the next morning and he was just sat there and he was praying he said God forgive me you know I'm I'm an idiot or or how how how how however it was that it was it was that that that that he phrased it and he said I'm sorry I was wrong and and and the doubt that I was even going hey um brother man I've got to go to work can you um um you want to go now and he kept saying just wait a minute just wait a minute and he was sitting there and all of a sudden the Grandma comes walking in and she steps down in that chair and she starts cleaning and cleaning her glasses and he said he said he said he said I also have to do is wait for that Dad to go from the doorway to cross onto the other side of the room and he said he said then the vision everything will be in its place at that point and so he sat there and he waited and he waited and that finally crossed through him and and then he stood up because he's seen that the the vision had now been have now been fully fulfilled now and now and now he can act he can act with all confidence and all Authority and he picked up the baby and prayed for and immediately he got well why because because see brother random in these Visions he had to he he had to wait for everything to be fulfilled he he has remembered the the boy that that got raised from from from Finland the other day or not the other day but you know then he he he he he he had a vision and he said there was mountains around he said he said there was a road with the valley and he he said the boy had on some kind of foreign looking clothes and he wrote it all down and the fire leaf of his Bible and he had brother Bank woods and several others to write the right division down and and they said that that that that that it was two or three years that went by and brother Brandon had it written down in his fire leaf because he didn't know when it was going to come to pass but he knew that at some point it was going to come to pass and and so and so and so he told everybody about this what's going to happen you know he it's going to be such going to happen you know you know and it's it's going it's going it's going it's going to be fulfilled well I'm sure the story got he got got got circulated and I'm sure at some point at some point somebody's boy got got got got hit got hit hit by a car so they call him brother random is this the vision so so he might show up there and say no this isn't it but but even though he would pray for them and they may or may not have gotten well I don't know but but but see but see he didn't have the authority that he had and all of a sudden that when he's over there in Finland and he goes this place looks familiar and he kept looking he kept saying I've seen this place before and he turns your brother brother Woods I think it was he said check the filing for your Bible and he started reading off to him you can see yep there's the mountains he said yeah he said yep he said yep he's the valley and he and here's the road he said this is the Fulfillment of that vision and and he walked up to that boy maybe didn't know nobody and and maybe they weren't even Christians but he could walk up there with all authority and all power and he could sit there and say and say if if this boy is raised up in in five minutes time I'm gonna I'm gonna hang a sign on my back and call myself a false prophet he said why but he could stand there and all authority and all power and that boy and that boy raised her life again why him all why because because he's seen his place in the vision he's seen it was this was the Fulfillment of the vision of what was to come to pass and the bride now was standing is standing in in in in her place and she's come up and and she's become this perfect this perfect Masterpiece that God that God that God has as it has has has has has has created and the Capstone has come down the heads hit their heads in its place why she why why and the bride's looking around and saying hey the Fulfillment of the vision is here we are now we are now living in the Fulfillment of what of what since before the foundation of the world that these prophets have prophesied about and men have preached about and brothers have labored over this is something that brother Brown prophesied in and spoke about and preached about and now we as the body Jesus Christ today in 2022 can stand around and see hey this is the Fulfillment of the vision and we can step into our place and you want and you watch what starts to happen why was the the the the the the who we can stand we can stand a full Authority and full power and say Satan get thee behind me and no matter what would happen if someone is going to sick or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or if they're they're dealing they're dealing with these struggles they had day in and day out maybe for years or maybe it's a generational curse but now we as a bride of Jesus Christ can step forth into the vision and we can stand there with all authority and all power and we can claim whatever the need maybe why because we because we've caught ourselves in the vision we've seen our our place and our our spot in Scripture you uh notice in prayer lines that um brother Brown would have he he he would have the individual come up or I think it was on his right or something I think it was and uh and and because he said the angel was always on his left I don't remember exactly now but he he he he but but he would start reading them off like a book just pow pow pow pow and then and then but then all of a sudden all sudden he would stop and he would say he would say a lady out there in the crowd and he would say he would say he he would say you've got you've got cancer and it's in the breast and he started reading off well that lady may not realize he's talking to her because there might be 30 000 people there but then all of a sudden he would go he would go Mrs Smith you're right you're in Lima Ohio and you're in and your address is five six seven eight whatever street and then she would realize hey he's talking about me so he she would catch herself in the vision that that that that that that brother Brenda was having and it would cause her to have the faith that it would cause her to have the faith of what was to happen and and and and and then a couple times I've I've heard the prayer lines they would sit there and say he would sit there and say Mrs Smith Smith he you you're healed a dancer now if you'll rise up and claim it and and he would say he would say don't hesitate you're going to miss it and then she would still says Hector he was in Mrs Smith your address is such and such and she still wouldn't catch it and he would say he and he would say because you because because you have have have have have uh have hesitated now and you didn't catch it it is now it is now on the neighbor next next next next next next next next next next to you and she would rise up and claim the same healing that that lady could have gotten why why because because she couldn't she didn't realize that that that Vision brother Ryan was having was about her and so we when they would sit there and realize that hey the prophet of God who has been Vindicated hundreds and thousands of times is talking about me say hey I am now I am now I am now I am now in the vision of Jesus of what that prophet's having so they could stand there and they could claim say no that healing is mine now because they saw themselves in the vision and and if we could catch the vision division tonight that that healing is the children's bread that that that Christ said whatsoever you have that whatsoever that you have have have need of that that whatsoever you have needed I will give it to you if we ask the broader Jesus Christ could realize that Deliverance is ours that the the overcoming power is ours and all authority over anything the devil could throw away as ours why be it's not that and yes the prophet taught us but it but but but but again he's not here in person to sit there and say sister so-and-so your deliverance is here but we as of Jesus right of Jesus Christ can realize this is the children's bread and what's the same attributes that Christ died for on Calvary is the same attributes that says I am healed this when he died when he died when he when he went win win he died on Calvary it was for our sins but but yet at that same day he he was he was beaten he was beaten for for our our sins are not our sins but our healing and our and our transgressions it's the same attribute that says as it says that says that that says I'm saved it's the same attribute that says I can have the Holy Ghost it's our bread why would god sister and give and give and give one one one child a piece a cone of ice cream and another child that says some asparagus that that's that that would not be right of a dad to do that but but us as surprised as children of God we can stand there and say hold on hold on a second here someone saw God his ice cream where's my ice cream and all you have to do is hold your hand out and it's yours it's the children's bed Hawaii it's everything that that we ever have need of is now ours but what we have to do is we have to see ourselves we have to see ourselves in that word and realize hey hold on I'm not just any any Joe flow down the street I am the Bride of Jesus Christ no no I want to be healed but you already were healed God can no more do anything for you you just have to open up and it holds your hand out and say God where's my ice cream where's my healing at oh it's it's mine can I have it now why because it's ours it's it's it's the children's bread why the prison bars have been opened up and we as a body of Jesus Christ who have the mind of God now are realizing the prison bars are open we just have to step out of those uh how we have to step out of those bars and and step into the Open Arms of Jesus Christ in Christ when he had that vision of all those people that I was in those bars he said he said I can't I can't heal them I can't help them but he said House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ he said all the creaking and the popping in the in the and the thing falling apart the hinges why be it why because because he's way the the the Bride of Jesus Christ has been set free from from every kind of power that that might be holding us down Deliverance is ours salvation is ours healing is ours the prison bars are open to Hawaii because to speak onto the mountain whatsoever that you have whatsoever that you have have have need of it is yours it is it is yours to take and why that same spirit that was in Jesus is now on us that that makes us an heir and a joint Heir with Christ that means that means that means if if I think I know I've explained this before but I like to explain it because it it makes it easy it makes it simple for dummies like like like me let's say brother Amos and I was Brothers In the Flesh and our daddy was a big Rancher and and he dies well now in his will and testament we're both heirs now now he gets the the ranch and the Fancy's truck and and and and and everything else but he gives me a goat so brother Amos is driving his brand spanking new fancy trucks to church and I'm riding my goat you know man you know but but but but but see see even though I'm still in there but see a joint Heir means if our daddy that died it died it says you are a joint Heir ahead with me a brother if brother Amos owns that ranch I own that ranch he owns that truck I own that truck he he he owns that thought that that he owns that that those those he owns us a thousand dollars that thousand head catalog a thousand-headed cattle out there on the Hills I own those thousand head of cattle out there on them Hills why were joint heirs were Heirs of the same blessings the same promise that Christ that Christ had we as the body to Jesus Christ have white because we're heirs and we're doing heirs with Christ so this is so so so so so so if Christ could stand forth and all authority and all power and say and say you are healed or or or or or or or or or or or or or thy sins be forgiven thee we as the Bride of Jesus Christ can stand there and say the same thing why because we have the same Authority and the same power that Christ had had on Calvary as Christ as Christ well it was the Masterpiece in his day we have come forth as a masterpiece as the Masterpiece in our day where we can stand here and and and and claim every god-given promise and right that we are that that we have so so so so so so so so so so so we need to let a vision breakouts break out over our lives and and we need to sear ourselves not as the world sees us but as Christ as Christ but as Christ as Christ sees us as son and daughter of God that has stepped out of those out of those out of those prison bars with full of poor Authority and power and we can look that devil in the eye and say hey and say get the hints you are now powerless is is is is quit is is quit soft soft footing around the devil and does and his hope and and hope and hope that that that that that that that that that that that that that that he that he that he ignores you and his hand just hopes that well I hope I don't be tried today or or I hope my arthritis ain't gonna ain't gonna ain't gonna ain't gonna kick up uh today or I'm sure hope this isn't gonna happen today what we need to do is stand in full Authority and a full power and see yourself as God sees us and we need to step into the vision of what God has called us to be and we need to look at that devil in the eye and say get the hint Satan hope I'm not repeating myself to to to to to to to do much here this is this message did not come did did not come to to just to just to just two justices to just sit on a shelf and and get Dusty or just stay on the tapes and say just play the tapes only it's come to live and dwell in The Bride of Jesus Christ and so so brother Brandon brother Brown was just a forerunner of what was to come he he he he he he he was a he he he was a sheath wave offering showing of what's to come in the in the near in the near in the near future why is this um um um so so that message is just to stay in them tapes is to come and live in the bride and Jesus the bride you you take an architect he how he how he um how he he Visions a home and and and and and and and and he'll he'll sit there and and build this home and and and and and are not built at home but he what he sees in his mind he'll start drawing it out on paper on a set of blueprints and what he sees in his mind he he he relays it to the contractor and then the contractor in turn builds the home and and and so what without with that architect already Visions in his mind in the back or in the back of his mind or whatever he might see this home in a in a perfected State and the contractor might be a little extra his head going why in the world do you want to do that here but see but see he if if if if if you build according to the blueprints of what the architect has drawn what because what becomes not in the architect's mind has then becomes um becomes manifested and manifested in person as a beautiful home that someone that someone that somebody will enjoy for years and so so it's so so so and so so it's kind of funny because I used to work for a company and the foreman my uh my uh my uh Foreman um he he he he had the architect's phone number and it was it was a multi-million dollar company and and there was there was two or three superintendents and you had the contractors and he had you know but he he he he he he he somehow wrangled his way around and he got the architect's phone number and and so what she wasn't really wasn't technically supposed to have it because the architect's a busy man but he he sat there and say hey I'm not seeing what you're trying what you're trying to to to to to to accomplish her he said I can't grasp grasp why you want to do something here and and then the architect would sit there and lay it out and explain everything to him and show him hey this is why we're doing this and I'm wanting to do this here for that and then when that foreman could get in the architect's mind and figure out what exactly what exactly that architect was was was trying was was trying to accomplish the foreman could could then relay it to the rest of us guys we'd build what what the architect had in mind since this is since since since since since however long the architecture the architect has dreamed of this home and so we as the body of Jesus Christ when if we could ever get into the mind of Christ and realize just exactly what what God has in mind for us us has the body of Christ we can stand there and with all confidence and an all authority go and go no this is what the architect wants so we're building it this way and so when when someone Satan May when Satan when Satan may come in like a flood flood we ask the bride that Christ can stand there in all authority in all power and raise up that standard of the message and say no sir this is what the architect wants and we can go forward with it with it with all confidence and all boldness knowing that that that what that architect wanted he's going to back us up with them brother Byron said he said that they said that that same power that same Christ Hallelujah he said let the fundamentalists and let the people who deny the power of God say it's wrong but that same people that spoke the world that same sorry power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost he said that's right man and woman it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back until you tell you that you're some little taught down down something you're not your sons and daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you he says hallelujah I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give you Zoe the life of God is in is in the human being and then he says he he says he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life and frogs and all these ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made by him but what was made by him who he said Christ the deity he brought down he he brought down he brought down the plagues and everything in the days of Egypt who Christ he stopped the mouse Lions he quits the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword they had raised they raised the desert they'd raised the Dead from the grave who Christ he's all mine he he said he said what would it be who is it Christ the deity he's saying brother sister I deities in you a little while in the world in the world and the world and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the age Christ in the manger no sir Christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping Christ to the manger he's about World War should be in Christ in you the Holy Ghost the hope of Life Hallelujah the Creator God himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but but we shall see him as he is for will be made like him so so we we are that we are we are missing Jesus Christ standing forth with the full power and full Authority and the most powerful Army to ever walk the face of the earth is deity standing here in flesh again again in these last days but what we have to do is we have to get out of our head that we that we're just a failure that we're just we're just a sinner we're just a worthless scum that we're nothing we have to get in our head that we are Mrs Jesus Christ and we are deity that we are deity standing in flesh again today and in these last days why you have to step into the vision of what Christ had for us amen the musicians can come I only met about halfway through I didn't realize how long this is going to take but but but Moses heard that voice in The Burning Bush that said I am that I am has sent you heard that voice and he seen himself in that vision and that enabled him that enabled him to he had enabled him to deliver the children of Israel get in get it get in get in get in get in at the angel of the Lord hell Lord when he was thrushing weep behind the wine press and he and and and that that angel said the almighty man of Valor and he's like who me I'm just a farmer and he said I'm the least of my father's home but yet but yeah but yet when he realized that that that that it wasn't it wasn't just him he wasn't just him standing there but but God seen him as a mighty man of Valor and it gave him it gave him it gave him the energy or the and the authority and the power and the boldness to sit there and take on a whole army with 300 men all it takes is one person to surrender to to surrender to God to surrender to his word amen um I'll haunt you thankful for what God has done for us in these last days aren't you thankful that that we can stand there in all boldness and authority and press forward toward the mark of the price of the high calling in Christ Jesus amen just any day now we get to go home aren't you looking forward to that day amen talk we've got the power in the name of Jesus we've
