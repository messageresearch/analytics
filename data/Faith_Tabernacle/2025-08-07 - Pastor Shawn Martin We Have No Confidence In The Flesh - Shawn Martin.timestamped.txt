[18:12] Oh, we can face it with a smile

[36:29] Well, is that your prayer this evening?
[36:33] Amen. Our faith
[36:36] looks up to him.
[36:38] Amen. And um I'm so glad that we can
[36:42] look up to him and have a faith in him,
[36:45] a confidence in him. Praise the Lord.
[36:48] And uh it's certainly good to be here in
[36:51] the house of the Lord with you. Amen.
[36:54] And trust you had a good day today. And
[36:57] uh certainly enjoying the the weather.
[37:00] Amen. And uh um if you have your Bibles,
[37:07] we'll um just turn to the scriptures for
[37:11] just a a few moments. Amen. Um and we
[37:16] want to look maybe
[37:18] uh the book of Philippians.
[37:24] Amen. Uh the third chapter. And
[37:30] you're going to want to remember all
[37:31] those that are sick and not feeling
[37:34] well. Amen. And if you've noticed, we
[37:38] took out a couple pews, a pew on each
[37:42] side of the uh church, and that's to to
[37:45] make room uh more room. Amen. I kind of
[37:50] like it. Um that way u you know we had
[37:54] Sister Py in the back in the hallway all
[37:57] that time for for a long time and Sister
[38:00] Kim was back in the back Sunday with her
[38:04] leg. And so we decided to um to change
[38:09] things and so um uh bring you all closer
[38:14] up this way so you're closer to the back
[38:16] and to the front at the same time. But
[38:19] um uh of course if if when we need it uh
[38:24] u more chairs, we we we're able to do
[38:28] that. So um anyway, so not all is lost.
[38:33] Amen. And um you know, I think as I said
[38:36] before, uh we're going to be changing
[38:39] things as we go uh in here. I'm going to
[38:42] be uh when we get the money and the
[38:45] chance going to change the pews and
[38:48] we're going to put regular chairs in and
[38:50] make make it look a little nicer and um
[38:54] so anyways uh hope that doesn't affect
[38:58] anybody's worship u and your love for
[39:01] the Lord and your love for me. Praise
[39:04] the Lord. Uh but uh uh we just uh
[39:09] thought we'd kind of update things a
[39:11] little bit and um uh just get um
[39:16] refresh. Amen. So uh hope that'll be all
[39:20] right with everybody. Uh but let's look
[39:23] at the book of Philippians for just a
[39:26] few moments
[39:29] and um
[39:31] the third chapter
[39:35] and um we're going to start at the first
[39:38] verse
[39:40] um and read to the 14th.
[39:43] But it says, "Finally, my brethren,
[39:45] rejoice in the Lord.
[39:48] To write the same things to you, to me
[39:52] indeed is not grievious,
[39:54] but for you it is safe." Now, think of
[39:57] that. Paul writing words that would be
[40:01] safe for the church.
[40:05] Beware of dogs.
[40:07] Beware of evil workers.
[40:10] Um,
[40:12] beware of the concision,
[40:15] for we are the circumcision, which
[40:18] worship God in the spirit, and rejoice
[40:22] in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
[40:25] in the flesh.
[40:28] Though I might also have confidence in
[40:31] the flesh, if any other man thinkketh
[40:34] that he hath whereof he might trust in
[40:38] the flesh, I more
[40:41] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[40:44] of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, and
[40:46] Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the
[40:49] law, a Pharisee,
[40:51] concerning zeal, persecuting the church,
[40:56] touching the righteousness which is in
[40:58] the law, blameless.
[41:01] But what things were gained to me, those
[41:04] I counted loss for Christ?
[41:07] Yay doubtless I count all things but
[41:10] loss for the excellency of the knowledge
[41:12] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[41:16] suffered loss of all things and do count
[41:19] them but dung that I may win Christ and
[41:23] be found in him not having mine own
[41:26] righteousness which is of the law but
[41:28] that which is through the faith of
[41:30] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[41:33] by faith
[41:35] that I may know him and the power of his
[41:39] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[41:41] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[41:44] his death, if by any means I might
[41:48] attain unto the re resurrection of the
[41:50] dead, not as though I'd already
[41:52] attained, either were already perfect,
[41:54] but I follow after, if that I may
[41:58] apprehend that for which also I am
[42:00] apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I
[42:05] count not myself to have apprehended,
[42:07] but this one thing I do, forgetting
[42:09] those things which are behind, and
[42:12] reaching forth unto those things which
[42:14] are before, I press toward the mark for
[42:18] the prize of the high calling of God in
[42:21] Christ. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[42:25] in a word of prayer. Father,
[42:29] as we have gathered here this evening
[42:33] under a promise that you would be here
[42:35] with us
[42:37] and Lord, we're trusting that tonight.
[42:40] And we just ask that you would help us,
[42:45] that you would anoint both speaker and
[42:47] hearer. I pray, Father, that you would
[42:50] help me to get myself out of the way and
[42:53] that you can use me to speak to someone,
[42:56] to speak to your people today. Father,
[42:59] as you see, Lord, I uh may not have much
[43:04] Lord, but if you could just take the
[43:07] simple words and as you did the the
[43:10] loaves and fish and just multiply it,
[43:13] Lord, I pray, Father, that you would do
[43:15] it tonight. Lord, asking that you would
[43:18] forgive us of all of our sins and our
[43:20] failures. And Father, cover us with your
[43:23] blood this evening. We ask it in Jesus
[43:26] Christ's name. Amen. And amen. You can
[43:31] have your seats this evening.
[43:34] And um
[43:37] I um
[43:39] honestly wasn't um I was uh expecting
[43:43] another minister to come and uh so I
[43:46] have just enjoyed myself all day
[43:49] relaxing, taking it easy. And on our way
[43:52] to church, I found out that I'm
[43:53] preaching. And so, u
[43:57] um I trust that it'll be a help to you
[43:59] tonight. And uh it's just going to be
[44:02] something simple, but um if I would have
[44:06] a title, it would be we have no
[44:08] confidence in the flesh.
[44:11] And um taking from what Paul said there
[44:16] and I I think that was is a powerful
[44:18] statement and how true it is for every
[44:22] believer is to
[44:26] not look at ourselves and have
[44:27] confidence because what what would we
[44:30] have confidence in? Now the things that
[44:33] stand out to me that Paul would say in
[44:35] this uh chapter
[44:39] uh first of all he said we are the
[44:40] circumcision. We are the true
[44:43] circumcision.
[44:45] And we know that uh there were the Jews.
[44:50] God had required them in the Old
[44:52] Testament to every male to be
[44:55] circumcised and it was the cutting away
[44:58] of flesh.
[44:59] And uh it was a natural thing. And so um
[45:05] when God turned to the Gentiles
[45:09] uh well the the Jews, they felt like the
[45:15] Gentiles ought to be circumcised too.
[45:19] and uh that they couldn't be saved
[45:20] without it. And so, of course, uh it
[45:25] became a battle. And and so here is Paul
[45:28] addressing this and he's telling them we
[45:32] are the true circumcision
[45:34] &gt;&gt; because the natural only type the
[45:37] spiritual
[45:39] of of as we have talked about uh uh I
[45:43] think last Sunday a little bit of how
[45:45] that uh the the Holy Ghost is our
[45:49] circumcision
[45:51] uh and it's not dealing with natural
[45:54] flesh but it is dealing with the
[45:56] circumcision of the heart
[45:59] &gt;&gt; that it it it cuts out the desires of
[46:02] the world. It cuts us away from the
[46:05] things uh that would hinder us and and
[46:09] and these things. And so Paul is telling
[46:12] them we have we have no confidence in
[46:15] the flesh. You know, uh the the Jewish,
[46:19] you know, they they they wanted a law.
[46:22] They wanted something that they could do
[46:24] for themselves and and it become a merit
[46:28] system uh to gain God's favor and and um
[46:33] uh these things and and basically to
[46:37] have their own righteousness and and so
[46:40] Paul is telling them, hey, you know, th
[46:42] this ain't this isn't the gospel. We
[46:45] we're we we're not to have confidence in
[46:48] what we do and and these things. And
[46:51] then he goes on, "And what things were
[46:53] gained to me, I counted loss for
[46:56] Christ."
[46:57] Now that that's a big statement in
[47:00] itself because uh everybody you know
[47:04] wants wants more and more and uh uh it
[47:08] it seems to be you know um uh something
[47:13] that keeps a man superior as as we read
[47:17] where Paul says if you want to boast in
[47:20] the flesh all right let's go there and
[47:23] and he begins to give his resume of
[47:26] everything that he was in the flesh.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And he had quite a resume. And yet he
[47:32] says, "Everything that I've was gained
[47:35] to me, everything that I was, everything
[47:38] that I, you know, in in that in the
[47:41] past, I counted all but done that I may
[47:45] win Christ."
[47:47] And so the the the the works of the
[47:50] flesh faded away
[47:53] uh when Calvary came into view,
[47:57] &gt;&gt; when Christ came. Um and and and that's
[48:01] what it was. And so he goes on and says,
[48:03] "I count all things but loss for the
[48:06] excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[48:09] Jesus my Lord. I'm not here to learn
[48:12] about me. I'm not here to learn about my
[48:15] works and and and what I'm capable of or
[48:19] or all these things. I I want to gain
[48:22] the knowledge of him.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; I want to know who he is.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; I want to know all about him. Ain't that
[48:31] right? And he says, "For whom I have
[48:34] suffered the loss of all things and do
[48:36] count them but done that I may win
[48:41] Christ.
[48:43] Then another point he says that I may be
[48:45] found in him
[48:47] not having mine own righteousness which
[48:51] is of the law but having the
[48:53] righteousness which is of God which
[48:56] comes through faith in Christ. Ain't
[48:59] that right? So nothing that I've done is
[49:03] just simply I've got righteousness, the
[49:06] righteousness of God simply through the
[49:09] works of Christ, believing in in Christ,
[49:14] uh my substitute. Ain't that right?
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And and so he he goes on and and he's
[49:20] talking, you know, I've I my goal is to
[49:24] apprehend that for which I have been
[49:27] apprehended for. If I'm going to spend
[49:30] my life, I'm going to spend it
[49:32] everything to gain Christ. What I've
[49:36] been chosen for, what I have been
[49:38] ordained for, what I have been
[49:40] predestinated for. I'm not I'm not
[49:43] worried about everything else. I'm just
[49:46] here to apprehend Christ. And I'm
[49:49] reaching for those things which are
[49:52] before. Ain't that right? Amen. and I
[49:55] press toward the mark of the the prize
[49:58] of the high calling of Jesus Christ. So
[50:01] Paul is clearly letting us know that
[50:05] there is nothing nothing good in
[50:08] ourselves. Ain't that right?
[50:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You know, people think that they have to
[50:13] be good in order to come to Christ.
[50:16] uh you know, if I could just clean up
[50:18] this and if I could just, you know, make
[50:21] this better and if I could quit that,
[50:23] then then, you know, I'll come to church
[50:25] and I'll give my heart to the Lord or uh
[50:28] you know, all these things. But that
[50:30] that's that that's pointless.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; If if we could do anything good, then
[50:35] there's there's no point in Christ dying
[50:37] for us. Ain't that right? as as and we
[50:42] know these things, but you know, I I I
[50:45] pray that we could get so established in
[50:48] the grace of God that that it takes all
[50:52] fear away from us,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; takes all anxiety to where we can just
[50:57] fully rest upon God's promises.
[51:01] Amen. See, and so we we have nothing to
[51:04] bring to God. we uh that will get God to
[51:08] accept us more today than he did
[51:10] yesterday.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; There there's nothing if as the prophet
[51:13] said, you know, if you didn't do
[51:15] nothing, if you didn't tell a lie, if
[51:17] you didn't smoke, drink, if you didn't
[51:19] think a bad thought or whatever, if you
[51:22] didn't do any of those things, you're
[51:24] still lost
[51:26] &gt;&gt; without God. Ain't that right?
[51:28] &gt;&gt; And so we we find that that none of us
[51:32] can bring to the table. You couldn't do
[51:35] it as a sinner and you still can't do it
[51:37] today to to gain God's favor towards
[51:42] you.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; You just can't do it. Ain't that right?
[51:46] And so we all deserve to stand at the
[51:49] white throne judgment. How many believes
[51:50] that?
[51:51] &gt;&gt; We all do. Every one of us. We all
[51:55] deserve to go through the tribulation.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; We all deserve to go to hell. There's
[52:01] not there's not one of us here that that
[52:03] that doesn't deserve that. We we all
[52:06] deserve that from from the least to the
[52:09] the uh to the greatest. It it's just
[52:12] that way. But why why aren't we afraid
[52:16] of these things?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Why why aren't we afraid to have to that
[52:21] that that you know to that to have to
[52:24] stand before the uh uh uh white throne
[52:28] judgment? Why why aren't we um uh full
[52:32] of anxiety and and all that when the
[52:35] world is headed to tribulation?
[52:38] Everything's about to blow any time. I
[52:40] know they're calling peace peace, but
[52:42] the the the Bible already says when they
[52:44] begin to do that, sudden destruction's
[52:47] going to come.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; We we we're we're we're seeing the
[52:50] earthquakes like never before. We're
[52:52] we're seeing warnings of tsunamis and
[52:55] we're we're uh planes falling out of the
[52:58] sky. We're we're we're seeing trouble in
[53:00] the land. It's it's just chaos after
[53:04] chaos and men and women and boys and
[53:07] girls full of hate and bitterness and
[53:11] anger and and and and nobody has the
[53:14] answers and and marriages falling apart
[53:18] and schools falling apart, churches
[53:21] falling apart, people Amen just falling
[53:24] apart. But why are we at peace tonight?
[53:27] Is because God provided a blood to cover
[53:33] us from all of these things.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[53:37] &gt;&gt; The blood is God's provided way to
[53:42] reconcile us back to him. Aren't you
[53:44] glad for that?
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. To think of that. Amen. That God
[53:50] so long Amen. to to for us to come in
[53:55] company with him and to fellowship with
[53:59] him and it's it's God's pardoning grace
[54:04] to us. Do you believe that?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Now that's uh that that's important. You
[54:09] know, I um you know, the prophet uh
[54:11] preached the message uh uh uh pardon and
[54:15] and he talks about pardon a lot and that
[54:19] that that should mean something so much
[54:22] to us. A pardon is a release. Everybody
[54:25] say a release from guilt.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Now, think of that. Amen. In our own
[54:30] mind, we know we've done it. We know
[54:33] we're undeserving. But there is a
[54:35] release from guilt.
[54:38] Amen. And it goes on, pardon is the act
[54:42] of forgiving or releasing someone from
[54:45] the consequences of a fault or crime or
[54:50] the remission of a penalty. It can also
[54:53] be seen as excusing an offense or
[54:56] allowing it to pass without punishment.
[54:59] In in a legal context, a pardon is a
[55:02] release from the legal penalties of an
[55:05] offense, often granted by a government
[55:08] official. Ain't that right? It means to
[55:11] exact neither punishment nor redress. It
[55:15] cannot be brought up again in the court
[55:17] of law. It's a pardon. You're free. It's
[55:21] over. The It silences the accuser. It
[55:25] breaks the power of of the accuser. No
[55:29] matter what anybody thinks, they may
[55:32] think you deserve it. They may say you
[55:34] ought to go to jail. But if there has
[55:36] been a pardon granted, then you're free
[55:40] from all guilt, free from condemnation,
[55:44] free from anything like that. Aren't you
[55:46] glad for that? And so God provided a
[55:50] blood not just to forgive you, but to
[55:54] pardon you. Amen. And and to where you
[55:57] don't have to bear the punishment. You
[56:00] don't have to bear the guilty of a load
[56:03] of condemnation. Why? It's not that God
[56:06] just says, "Well, I'm going to excuse
[56:09] the sin and the wrong and and let him
[56:12] get by." But Christ produced uh took our
[56:16] punishment. Christ bore our sins. Christ
[56:20] became sin. Amen. He became us that we
[56:24] might become him. He came from the the
[56:27] the the top and came all the way to the
[56:30] lowest of bottom that we could come from
[56:33] the lowest of bottom to go all the way
[56:36] up to the top and be just like him. Can
[56:39] you say amen? See, so God would produce,
[56:44] amen, a a remedy, a a substitute. And so
[56:49] Christ would take our punishment that we
[56:51] could go free without any condemnation.
[56:54] Now, as the prophet said, we have to
[56:57] accept that.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And I think that is the biggest thing is
[57:02] accepting what God has done.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; We know what we've done, but we ought to
[57:07] know what he's done. You could either
[57:10] accept what you are as undeserving,
[57:13] amen, and live that way. Or you could
[57:16] accept his pardoning grace, amen, and
[57:20] live the way he sees you as.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us living in fear and
[57:28] dread.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want us living in
[57:35] condemnation.
[57:37] Now, the only way a Christian should uh
[57:41] well, I say should,
[57:43] uh, the only way a Christian will live
[57:46] in condemnation, if I could say it that
[57:48] way, or however uh Paul would say it, is
[57:52] that if our heart condemn us, if we've
[57:55] done something wrong that's not under
[57:57] the blood, our heart will condemn us.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[58:03] &gt;&gt; There is something that will tell you,
[58:05] now you're wrong. you shouldn't have
[58:08] done that. Now, I want to just say this,
[58:10] you know, because the prophet says that
[58:13] a person can grieve themselves, grieve
[58:15] their soul away, you know, he says just
[58:18] like a child, you know, maybe he got
[58:21] caught in the cookies, you know, he ate
[58:23] the cookie, he ate the last cookie, and
[58:25] he knew he shouldn't have done that. You
[58:27] know, mama told him don't do that, but
[58:29] he did it anyways. And so mama sees that
[58:33] the cookiey's gone and she'll ask him,
[58:35] "Did you did you take that cookie?" Now,
[58:38] now the prophet says, and I'm sure we
[58:41] all experienced it, is there something
[58:43] down inside you that tells you, you
[58:46] know, you did it? Now, you can't, you
[58:49] know, or at least I couldn't have a
[58:51] poker face. As much as I tried to tell
[58:54] him I couldn't do it or didn't do it, I
[58:56] always had a guilty look. And and you
[58:59] know I uh all my children had a guilty
[59:03] look. You could you you could just tell
[59:06] it on written in their face. No matter
[59:08] even if they did say no, they got it on
[59:10] that look. They got that look, you know.
[59:13] Well, the prophet says there's something
[59:15] that tells you. Tell the truth.
[59:19] Tell the truth. You know you did it. And
[59:22] then something will say, "Well, but I'll
[59:24] get in trouble if I do that.
[59:27] you know, I ain't gonna do that. So, you
[59:30] got the the the the little devil over on
[59:33] your shoulder. Then you got the angel
[59:35] over your shoulder, whatever, you know,
[59:37] and and they're tell one's telling you,
[59:39] "Tell the truth." The other one says,
[59:40] "No, no, no, don't do that." You know,
[59:42] you'll get in trouble. And and so there
[59:45] becomes a war. So then the child says,
[59:47] "No, I I didn't do that. It was it was
[59:50] it was Billy Bob, you know, that did
[59:52] that, you know, and and you know, Billy
[59:56] Bob, did you I didn't do that, you know,
[59:59] that that that was that was, you know,
[1:00:02] goofy and he's the one that done that,
[1:00:04] you know, and so then he goes back and
[1:00:06] forth, but but he knows that he's
[1:00:08] guilty. There's something that tells him
[1:00:10] he's guilty, but he pushes that aside
[1:00:14] and he gets away with it. Well, then the
[1:00:17] prophet says, see, now he knows he got
[1:00:18] away with telling a lie. So now it
[1:00:21] becomes starting to get easier to tell
[1:00:23] lies and it becomes easier to tell lies
[1:00:26] to where then he starts not feeling
[1:00:29] guilty about telling those lies. He
[1:00:31] actually starts believing those lies and
[1:00:34] and the more he does it, well, the
[1:00:36] prophet says he's starting to grieve his
[1:00:38] soul away from him, right? See, and and
[1:00:42] so yeah, uh then he, you know, maybe he
[1:00:45] gets older and maybe the the teacher
[1:00:48] will ask him, you know, did you did you
[1:00:49] slap did you slap, you know, uh uh you
[1:00:53] know, uh Joe, you know, no, I didn't
[1:00:56] slap him. He just he just come to school
[1:00:58] like that with the handmark on his face,
[1:01:01] you know. Uh uh but I didn't do that,
[1:01:03] you know. Okay. Well, I hope you didn't.
[1:01:06] Oh, I didn't do that at all. And it
[1:01:08] became easy, you know. And and and then
[1:01:11] he gets older, he breaks the law with
[1:01:12] the policeman. You know, policeman says,
[1:01:14] "Ah, did you do that?" Ain't no way.
[1:01:17] I'll tell you the truth if I did that.
[1:01:20] You know, he knows he's lying through
[1:01:22] his teeth. You know, but it just becomes
[1:01:25] so much easier. Ain't that right? Easier
[1:01:29] to lie. And before you know it, he's
[1:01:32] getting away with murder. and and and
[1:01:34] and and he's grieved his soul to where
[1:01:38] there's nothing that condemns him. But a
[1:01:42] Christian now, a a Christian, when he
[1:01:46] does something wrong, there's something
[1:01:48] that just automatically lets him know
[1:01:51] you done wrong. And and and if he's a
[1:01:54] Christian, a prophet says there just
[1:01:57] something the minute he realizes he's
[1:01:59] wrong, he repents of it. So the prophet
[1:02:02] said it's not even sin yet because the
[1:02:05] moment he realizes he's wrong, he
[1:02:07] repents.
[1:02:08] Ain't that right? But the prophet said
[1:02:10] if your heart condemns you, then you're
[1:02:13] putting yourself right back as a sinner
[1:02:15] again. You put yourself as a sinner in
[1:02:18] the sense you're under condemnation.
[1:02:22] But we know there's a blood there that
[1:02:24] you don't have to live under
[1:02:26] condemnation. You don't have to stay
[1:02:28] that way. God doesn't want Christians,
[1:02:31] Amen, uh uh staying under condemnation.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want us coming to church and
[1:02:38] and and people can't lift their hands
[1:02:41] when they're under condemnation.
[1:02:43] They can't worship God freely when
[1:02:45] they're under in condemnation.
[1:02:48] So God would provide a blood and the
[1:02:51] prophet said it's always been the way of
[1:02:54] the blood. blood. The streak of blood
[1:02:56] runs from Genesis to Revelation. And the
[1:02:59] pathway of a Christian is the way of the
[1:03:03] of the blood. A ain't that right. Amen.
[1:03:06] See, and so Christ, he took our
[1:03:10] punishment so that we could go free and
[1:03:13] and and so now we have to accept it.
[1:03:16] Amen. Our worship should be without any
[1:03:19] condemnation. Not because our conscience
[1:03:22] is seared, but because there is a blood
[1:03:27] and we've been able to put everything
[1:03:29] under the blood and we're resting in his
[1:03:34] provision.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We're not resting in our provision.
[1:03:38] We're resting in what God has done for
[1:03:41] us. We ought to be the most joyful
[1:03:43] people on the face of the earth. It
[1:03:46] shouldn't be too hard for us to worship
[1:03:48] him. Even if we're tired, even if we're
[1:03:51] discouraged, even if we're, you know,
[1:03:54] fighting our battles, amen, to remember
[1:03:57] that it's his righteousness. And no
[1:03:59] matter what I feel, no matter how low I
[1:04:02] am, amen, I'm on my way to heaven, amen,
[1:04:05] because he provided a way, amen, of
[1:04:09] escape.
[1:04:13] So often
[1:04:15] people find themselves professing
[1:04:17] Christianity and yet living under a law
[1:04:22] and the word becomes law to them.
[1:04:26] It becomes a thing of dos and don'ts.
[1:04:32] Churches have made it about dos and
[1:04:34] don'ts. Preachers have made it dos and
[1:04:36] don'ts.
[1:04:39] And I understand, you know, as maybe as
[1:04:42] as as you young people, you got a
[1:04:46] Christian dad and a Christian mom. They
[1:04:49] got dos and don'ts. Can't do this. Can't
[1:04:52] do that. You got to do this. You got to
[1:04:54] do that. And at that point, you're
[1:04:56] living under a law. I don't want to make
[1:04:58] my bed. Well, you're going to make your
[1:05:00] bed. You got to make your bed or you're
[1:05:01] in trouble. You know, you got to clean
[1:05:03] your room or or you got to go to school.
[1:05:06] You got to do all of these things,
[1:05:07] right? Gotta go to church. You got to
[1:05:10] live right. Got to dress right. Gotta
[1:05:12] got to act right. Amen. And it may be
[1:05:15] seem like young people have to play that
[1:05:17] part. But what we're we're we're hoping
[1:05:20] and and praying and believing is that
[1:05:23] God will strike that soul to where it's
[1:05:26] no longer a law that you're living
[1:05:28] under, but it's God's grace
[1:05:32] that comes and circumcises that heart
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; to get you away from the world, to get
[1:05:38] you away from the unbelief, to get you
[1:05:41] away from desiring the filth and the
[1:05:43] trash that is out there and all the
[1:05:46] ungodly things to where your heart and
[1:05:50] mind and soul is centered upon Christ.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It's not fun living under a law.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's not fun. Amen. When everything
[1:06:03] becomes law, Christianity becomes law.
[1:06:07] Amen. Where's the joy in that? When
[1:06:10] you're wanting to go out there and do
[1:06:11] those things and yet you know that if
[1:06:13] you do it, you go to hell. So, you don't
[1:06:16] want to do those things. Well, you don't
[1:06:17] serve God because you're afraid of going
[1:06:20] to hell.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. That's not why
[1:06:25] you're serving God. Amen. You serve him
[1:06:27] because you love him.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; You serve him not because you have
[1:06:31] confidence in your flesh. Amen. But you
[1:06:34] have confidence in every work that he
[1:06:36] has done at Calvary. That's right.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; The people sad to say they live under a
[1:06:45] law yet claim to be Christians. The word
[1:06:48] becomes a law to them. Christianity
[1:06:51] becomes a fleshly thing to them.
[1:06:55] Thou shalt thou shalt not.
[1:06:59] Don't touch this. Do this. You know, and
[1:07:03] so again, it's just like the Jews having
[1:07:05] the circumcision in the flesh.
[1:07:08] They thought the Jews or Gentiles ought
[1:07:10] to come just like they are and and these
[1:07:13] things, but they didn't realize Calvary
[1:07:16] had come.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that something
[1:07:20] greater has come.
[1:07:23] A greater circumcision. Can you say
[1:07:25] amen?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; A greater lamb, a greater blood, a
[1:07:30] greater high priest.
[1:07:32] Ain't that right? A greater work.
[1:07:36] Now, but here
[1:07:38] the prophet said Jesus Christ was God
[1:07:41] manifested in the fullness did to
[1:07:44] himself standing on the earth.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; God in his fullness to die for the sin
[1:07:49] of the people
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; that he might bring his church to his
[1:07:54] church a sanctified life
[1:07:58] that he might have the preeminence and
[1:08:00] fullness in his church. Can you say
[1:08:02] amen? how different it was for the for
[1:08:06] uh uh for the Mosak laws and and and the
[1:08:09] ministry of condemnation.
[1:08:12] Amen. It was all about their works. Thou
[1:08:14] shalt not do this. Thou shalt do this.
[1:08:16] And okay, you know, and and and they
[1:08:19] were perfecting themselves in their own
[1:08:22] righteousness by their own works. Can
[1:08:25] you say amen? But Christ died that we
[1:08:29] wouldn't have to do that. Christ died
[1:08:31] that we wouldn't have to try to perfect
[1:08:33] ourselves because every time you try to
[1:08:35] perfect yourself in the flesh,
[1:08:37] condemnation is going to strike you. Can
[1:08:40] you say amen? Amen. But see, Calvary
[1:08:43] came not for us to have this up and down
[1:08:46] experience. He loved me. He loved me
[1:08:47] not. He loved me. He loved me not. I'm
[1:08:49] on my way to heaven. Oh no, I just blew
[1:08:51] it. I don't even know if I'm going to
[1:08:53] heaven or not. No. Christ settled it
[1:08:56] all. Having no confidence in the flesh,
[1:08:59] he died that he might have the
[1:09:03] preeminence in his church.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; To bring to his church a sanctified
[1:09:11] life.
[1:09:12] There's only one life sanctified and
[1:09:14] that's his life.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; There's only one holy life and that's
[1:09:18] his holy life. Ain't that right? so that
[1:09:22] he might have the preeminence in
[1:09:24] fullness in his church. Watch to
[1:09:29] manifest every promise in these last
[1:09:31] days that he promised for the last days.
[1:09:34] Now, that's a promise. Amen. That he
[1:09:37] that's what God wants to do is to
[1:09:40] manifest every promise that he made for
[1:09:42] these last days to manifest them in your
[1:09:44] life.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And yet, we don't need a struggle
[1:09:50] to make that happen. We don't have to
[1:09:52] say, "Oh, man. I've got to do something
[1:09:54] to make this happen." We ain't got no
[1:09:56] confidence in the flesh.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Let him take over. Prophet said, "The
[1:10:02] more you die to yourself," Amen. the
[1:10:04] more he has his way in us.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It's just dying out to
[1:10:10] our flesh. Amen. Now, God, you know, the
[1:10:13] prophet told us God had the three-fold
[1:10:15] purpose. The first was that he wanted to
[1:10:18] express himself, identify himself with
[1:10:21] human beings to reveal himself in
[1:10:23] Christ. Secondly, he wanted to live in
[1:10:27] his bride body to have the preeminence
[1:10:29] in them. Now, think of it. How's he
[1:10:32] going to have a preeminence? Now, you
[1:10:34] know, he knew that man was going to
[1:10:36] fall. He knew that. Ain't that right?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He he if he didn't, then he wouldn't
[1:10:41] have had a lamb slain before the
[1:10:43] foundation of the world. But he knew man
[1:10:45] was going to fall. He knew what the
[1:10:47] condition that man would be in. And yet
[1:10:49] he chose that man. He chose you and I to
[1:10:53] have preeminence in.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't wipe when he saw a man fall.
[1:10:58] Well, you know, aren't you glad that he
[1:11:01] didn't just say, "Well, I'm going to
[1:11:02] wipe them off the face of the earth and
[1:11:03] I'll make someone else. I can't have the
[1:11:06] preeminence in someone like that." Amen.
[1:11:09] But he knew he could have preeminence in
[1:11:10] you, Brother Tim.
[1:11:13] Come on.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; He knew he would be able to have the
[1:11:18] preeminence in us because of the work of
[1:11:21] Calvary.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have preeminence in a sinful,
[1:11:30] ungodly
[1:11:32] people that was born with a vile nature,
[1:11:36] unholy. Ain't that right?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And yet that people he chose for
[1:11:41] himself.
[1:11:42] Ain't that right?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says we are his creation.
[1:11:47] How many's glad for that?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; We are his creation. And it's not a by a
[1:11:53] sexual desire of our parents. 2
[1:11:57] Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if any man
[1:11:59] be in Christ, he is a new creature, new
[1:12:03] creation.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Ain't that
[1:12:07] right?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Quit dragging the old things with you.
[1:12:11] That's right.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Quit dragging the past with you.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll never be able to make
[1:12:20] something because I've always been that
[1:12:22] way. Quit dragging that with you.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Hello, church.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Why? You are a new creation.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You're not just reformed.
[1:12:41] You are created new, a new creation.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, all
[1:12:48] things are become new.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; We did not have a good outlook,
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; but now we do have a good outlook.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; We didn't have a promise of a great
[1:13:00] future, but now we do.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; We were bound for hell, but now we're
[1:13:07] bound for heaven.
[1:13:10] why he did it.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:23,
[1:13:23] Paul says, "And be renewed in the spirit
[1:13:25] of your mind, that ye put on the new
[1:13:29] man, which after God is created in
[1:13:32] righteousness and true holiness." Think
[1:13:34] of that. You put on the new man
[1:13:39] not walk after the old, but you're
[1:13:42] walking after the new. It's a new life,
[1:13:44] a new thought, a new hope, a new
[1:13:48] promise.
[1:13:50] You're putting on that new man
[1:13:53] which is after God created in
[1:13:56] righteousness and true holiness. Amen.
[1:14:00] You know, we've talked about holiness
[1:14:02] and things and for years people have
[1:14:05] understood holiness to mean, you know,
[1:14:07] women wearing long hair and long
[1:14:09] dresses, long sleeves, men having short
[1:14:12] hair and long sleeves and and and and a
[1:14:16] bunch of other rules,
[1:14:18] no no wearing of jewelry of any kind.
[1:14:21] And I've even met some, you know, women
[1:14:25] that
[1:14:26] didn't believe in shaving their legs.
[1:14:29] and you know and they have all kinds of
[1:14:32] rules
[1:14:34] and and these things and and it's got to
[1:14:37] the place that people base their whole
[1:14:40] eternal destination
[1:14:42] on what they do and what they don't do.
[1:14:45] Ain't that right? But that's not true
[1:14:48] holiness
[1:14:49] because it's not how moral we are that
[1:14:53] gets us to heaven. Brother Bram said,
[1:14:55] you know, you could keep all the Ten
[1:14:57] Commandments and still not be a
[1:14:58] Christian. See, because God didn't send
[1:15:01] the Ten Commandments to save his people.
[1:15:03] He sent his son
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; to offer up a blood sacrifice for you
[1:15:09] and I. Can you say amen?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And so, here we find, and I I really
[1:15:15] like what Paul said here in Second
[1:15:18] Timothy. I was reading it this morning
[1:15:20] and it just, you know, it it spoke to my
[1:15:23] heart, but 2 Timothy 1:7
[1:15:27] uh through 10, but it says, "For God
[1:15:28] hath not given us the spirit of fear."
[1:15:32] For one, if there's ever a time that we
[1:15:34] need to get rid of fear, it's now. It's
[1:15:37] in this age. It's in this time to get
[1:15:39] rid of fear. You know, uh, Brother Brham
[1:15:43] says that's the biggest thing in the
[1:15:44] church, uh, is fear. Yeah.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Afraid that God won't keep his promise.
[1:15:50] Afraid, you know, of of of of so many
[1:15:53] things and that God has not given us the
[1:15:56] spirit of fear, but of power, of love,
[1:15:58] and of sound mind.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; He goes on, "Be not thou therefore
[1:16:03] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
[1:16:05] nor of me, his prisoner. But be thou
[1:16:08] partaker of the afflictions of the
[1:16:10] gospel, according to the power of God,
[1:16:14] who hath saved us,
[1:16:17] and called us with an holy calling, not
[1:16:21] according to our works.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; But according to his own purpose and
[1:16:31] grace.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Because if and
[1:16:36] I know Satan takes us down memory lane
[1:16:38] sometimes and our memory our that lane
[1:16:41] isn't good.
[1:16:43] We can always find our problems and of
[1:16:47] our past and and then he always brings
[1:16:50] it. Well, see, it's this is going wrong
[1:16:53] today because of you've done this and
[1:16:55] you've done that and and and boy, and if
[1:16:59] he gets us going down that lane, there's
[1:17:02] not good things about it cuz he loves to
[1:17:06] bring up the the past and it's usually
[1:17:08] pretty bleak.
[1:17:12] But here Paul is saying God saved us. He
[1:17:16] called us with an holy calling not
[1:17:19] according to our works.
[1:17:21] Whether it's bad works, good works,
[1:17:24] whatever.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; That had not your calling, your
[1:17:27] salvation had nothing to do with that.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:17:32] but according to his own purpose and
[1:17:34] grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:17:38] before the world begun.
[1:17:42] But now is made manifest by the
[1:17:45] appearing of our savior Jesus Christ
[1:17:49] who hath abolished death. And I really
[1:17:51] like this part. And hath brought life
[1:17:54] and immortality to light through the
[1:17:59] gospel.
[1:18:01] That's powerful.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; What is the gospel? I mean I mean he
[1:18:06] just showed us what the gospel is.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; It's bringing life and immortality to
[1:18:14] light
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; through the gospel.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Now Paul in the beginning of that he
[1:18:21] called it the promise of life.
[1:18:26] So it's not a sexual life. It's not that
[1:18:29] old nature that's that's that's not what
[1:18:33] the gospel's bringing up,
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; but it's the promise of life
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; that God has given before the foundation
[1:18:43] of the world. Did you know that you're
[1:18:46] predestinated to life?
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to eternal life.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; It's a promise of life. Yeah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Christ abolished death and hath brought
[1:19:02] life and immortality to light through
[1:19:05] the gospel.
[1:19:08] See, Satan has promised to destroy our
[1:19:11] soul. He set out to destroy us. But God
[1:19:14] made a promise of life.
[1:19:18] Ain't that right?
[1:19:19] And this promise has been brought to
[1:19:22] light through the gospel. You see, the
[1:19:25] gospel, it's the gospel of grace. Paul
[1:19:28] said, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:19:30] Jesus Christ, for it is the power of God
[1:19:34] unto salvation to them that believe." Do
[1:19:37] you believe it?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Think of that now. God would even
[1:19:41] provide a gospel
[1:19:43] to declare unto us that there is a
[1:19:46] promise of life and immortality.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; You may be scarred. You may be wary. You
[1:19:52] may be going through the the the
[1:19:54] greatest battle of your life, but there
[1:19:57] is a promise of life and immortality.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Satan may be saying, "I'll destroy their
[1:20:03] soul. I'll take them down." But there is
[1:20:06] a promise of life and immortality.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; That's what the gospel's all about.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; If you're really declaring the real
[1:20:16] gospel. I want to declare the real
[1:20:18] gospel.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. To bring to light this this
[1:20:23] promise of life and immortality.
[1:20:26] Church, we're getting ready to go home.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It ain't time to weep. It ain't time to
[1:20:32] mourn. It's time to rejoice.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We've heard the gospel. Ain't
[1:20:38] that right?
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not ashamed of the gospel,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; church. We shouldn't be ashamed of the
[1:20:44] gospel of Jesus Christ because it is the
[1:20:47] power of God unto salvation.
[1:20:50] Do you realize that how simple the
[1:20:52] gospel is and yet how powerful it is?
[1:20:55] I've seen it save the drunks. I see to
[1:20:58] deliver them. I have seen drunks come in
[1:21:01] drunk and leave sober.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; We've seen the power of God touch
[1:21:11] people.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Just simple preaching the gospel,
[1:21:14] Sister Kim. That's all it is. And and
[1:21:16] and the people that can just believe it.
[1:21:19] What changed your life?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Because of your willpower. No, the
[1:21:24] gospel was preached
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and you believed it. And there was a
[1:21:28] power in that gospel that had the power
[1:21:30] to save you, to to deliver you, to set
[1:21:33] you free. And I say it's still setting
[1:21:35] us free.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; It's still making us whole.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not defeated. We're stronger
[1:21:41] than ever.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And we have no confidence in the flesh.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's ever a desire in our
[1:21:48] hearts, that's to win Christ. I want to
[1:21:51] be so full of Christ, so full of his
[1:21:53] power, so full of his life.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said Moses, Noah's
[1:22:02] message was a message of grace to the
[1:22:05] people. Think of that. Just a simple man
[1:22:08] preaching the gospel.
[1:22:10] Amen. And yet, it was a message of
[1:22:12] grace, not law to them. It was grace.
[1:22:17] He was warning them. That was the grace
[1:22:20] of God before judgment ever struck. It
[1:22:23] was the grace of God to send a message
[1:22:25] to warn them that judgment was coming.
[1:22:28] God's wrath was getting ready to be
[1:22:30] poured upon the earth. But there was a
[1:22:32] provision.
[1:22:34] And brother Brandham said, "See God
[1:22:36] making his way and giving the people his
[1:22:39] covenant, how they could escape." That's
[1:22:41] what Noah's message was about. Amen. It
[1:22:44] wasn't just about uh judgment coming,
[1:22:46] but it was God making a way, giving the
[1:22:49] people, Amen. his covenant of how they
[1:22:52] could escape. It had salvation in it.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; The message of Noah had salvation in it.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Salvation was a place to escape. That
[1:23:07] ark was a place of salvation to them
[1:23:10] people in that day. That's right. There
[1:23:13] was no need for them to have confidence
[1:23:15] in their flesh.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; There was no need for them to try to
[1:23:19] build their own refuge when God had sent
[1:23:22] a message to be their refuge.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? They didn't need to do
[1:23:28] anything. Amen. The prophet said they
[1:23:30] was over there building their own boats,
[1:23:32] but they didn't need to build their own
[1:23:34] boats. God had provided an ark, a way of
[1:23:38] safety.
[1:23:42] All they needed to do was act upon what
[1:23:44] they had heard.
[1:23:46] The message that Lot re received was a
[1:23:48] message of grace. They didn't need to
[1:23:51] refine it. They didn't need to get in a
[1:23:54] theologian to to interpret for them. God
[1:23:57] made it so clear to them, get out of
[1:23:59] here.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before destruction ever hit, get
[1:24:02] out of here and don't turn back and
[1:24:06] look.
[1:24:08] It was a message of grace to them
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; so they could escape the judgment. Can
[1:24:14] you say amen? Church, we too have
[1:24:16] received a message of grace. It ain't
[1:24:19] nothing about what we do. It's not about
[1:24:21] us leaning on our own flesh and our own
[1:24:23] works. It's simply a message of grace
[1:24:26] for us to believe and act upon it.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:24:35] Brother Brandham said his son, God sent
[1:24:38] his son to die and became a a
[1:24:41] propitiation for our sins and that he
[1:24:43] could forgive our sins, that he could
[1:24:45] cleanse his tabernacle, and that he
[1:24:47] could live in us. Oh, wow. What a what a
[1:24:51] way of escape. Amen. That God didn't
[1:24:55] build a natural ark. Amen. He didn't
[1:24:58] produce something natural, but now he's
[1:25:01] looking into living within us, claiming
[1:25:05] us as his own to where he's able to have
[1:25:08] the preeminence. Can you say amen? We
[1:25:10] talk about having the perfect faith.
[1:25:12] Brother Bram said only there it it
[1:25:15] there's going to require more faith
[1:25:17] today than there ever has in any age.
[1:25:19] And if you're looking at that, you're
[1:25:21] thinking, "Oh my god, I've got this
[1:25:22] fault and I've got that fault. How in
[1:25:24] the world could I have it?" Amen. How in
[1:25:27] the world can this happen? But he comes
[1:25:29] inside of us and he begins to believe
[1:25:31] his own word. The more the word is
[1:25:34] preached, that word God inside of us,
[1:25:36] that Holy Ghost inside of us begins to
[1:25:38] believe through us. Amen. And I promise
[1:25:41] you, Amen. There is a faith that is in
[1:25:44] you that will be expressed.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I I believe it
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; because we're not leaning. We're not
[1:25:50] having confidence in the flesh. God once
[1:25:53] lived in man. Then sin drove him away.
[1:25:55] Then God killed his own son and then let
[1:25:58] God come back and live in his people
[1:26:00] again. Another place he says God the
[1:26:02] father dwelt in him that he might use
[1:26:04] his blood for sanctification and cleanse
[1:26:07] his church with that same spirit to live
[1:26:10] in his church to perform the works and
[1:26:12] the signs and fulfill the scripture that
[1:26:14] he promised in the last days. As it was
[1:26:17] in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in
[1:26:20] the coming of the son of man. Can you
[1:26:22] say amen? So, he didn't save us for us
[1:26:24] to establish go, you know, to establish
[1:26:27] our own righteousness as Paul said. How
[1:26:29] how is it? You've begun in the spirit
[1:26:32] and now you're being made perfect in the
[1:26:33] flesh. H how how h how did that start?
[1:26:36] How did that end up that way? Amen.
[1:26:38] Because someone started steering them
[1:26:40] into the law and they started depending
[1:26:43] upon works of c uh the works of their
[1:26:45] own righteousness instead of just
[1:26:47] dependent upon the works of God, the
[1:26:50] grace of God. Can you say amen?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Now, the word is what separates us in
[1:26:55] closing. It separates us from our sins
[1:26:57] and sickness. And we believe unto
[1:27:01] salvation.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; It brings to light eternal life
[1:27:06] and immortality.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; It brings to light the gospel that is
[1:27:14] preached in this age.
[1:27:17] It it it's not it's not bringing creed
[1:27:19] to us. It's not it's it's this message
[1:27:22] is a pure gospel
[1:27:26] that is bringing to light eternal life,
[1:27:28] the promise of life
[1:27:31] and immortality. And all we do is just
[1:27:35] accept it.
[1:27:37] You believe that?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do is just accept
[1:27:40] it. Just believe it.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We believe under salvation. We've
[1:27:46] talked about it. You know, brother Bram
[1:27:47] preached uh a few sermons on it. Uh you
[1:27:52] know about the waters of separation in
[1:27:54] the Old Testament. God established the
[1:27:56] water of separation. And brother
[1:27:58] Brandham said, "If any man had done
[1:28:00] wrong or anything, these ashes of this
[1:28:03] heer was placed upon him. It had to be a
[1:28:07] red hepher which spoke of Christ.
[1:28:12] He was separated. The ashes of this
[1:28:14] hepher was placed upon the worshipper.
[1:28:18] You had done wrong or whatever and he
[1:28:21] was separated from his guilt.
[1:28:26] If he was unclean in this water of
[1:28:28] separation
[1:28:30] as a memorial through all their
[1:28:31] generations to know that this heer, a
[1:28:34] selected hepher, a special hepher, a and
[1:28:37] the blood stood between him and the
[1:28:39] church and that ashes of it made a
[1:28:43] separation between him and his guilt.
[1:28:47] When you see that and place it on Christ
[1:28:49] Jesus, how that when we do guilt, we
[1:28:53] look at the separation.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He who stood at the
[1:29:02] judgment there, his blood was dipped
[1:29:04] from his body, sprinkled across the
[1:29:06] earth between that and God's holy
[1:29:08] tabernacle that every believer coming
[1:29:11] into his presence, breaking through the
[1:29:13] veil of the flesh, putting away the
[1:29:15] things of the world knows that the blood
[1:29:18] makes an atonement the waters of
[1:29:20] separation. And God through his mercy
[1:29:23] has washed us and separated us by the
[1:29:27] washing of the word by the water and
[1:29:31] separated his church from the things of
[1:29:33] the world unto a separated consecrated
[1:29:36] life to live for him walking in this
[1:29:40] present world without condemnation.
[1:29:44] Aren't you glad for that? There is
[1:29:46] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:29:48] that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not
[1:29:51] after the flesh, but has been separated
[1:29:53] by the water through the word, has
[1:29:56] anointed them by the Holy Ghost, and the
[1:29:59] ashes of separation has been sprinkled
[1:30:01] upon the individual, and he walks in
[1:30:04] this present world free from
[1:30:06] condemnation by the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:10] Oh, do you love him? If the musicians
[1:30:13] will come, not our righteousness, it's
[1:30:16] his righteousness.
[1:30:18] How could we separate from our sins?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; But God provided a way.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; How could we separate so that we
[1:30:30] wouldn't have to stand at the white
[1:30:32] throne judgment? We wouldn't have to go
[1:30:34] and face God's wrath that is fixing to
[1:30:37] come upon the earth. that we could
[1:30:39] believe and stand true with peace in our
[1:30:43] heart because God provided
[1:30:47] a way to separate us
[1:30:50] from the world. Aren't you glad for
[1:30:52] that?
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; And all of our past, all of our works,
[1:30:56] all of our goodness, everything that we
[1:30:58] thought we just counted all but dunk.
[1:31:02] That mean we may win him.
[1:31:05] Amen. I hope it's helped you tonight. I
[1:31:09] want to I I want to be in found in his
[1:31:13] righteousness.
[1:31:15] It's not my perfection. It's his
[1:31:17] perfection. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:31:20] You love him. Amen. Amen. What's on?
[1:31:26] Chains are gone.
[1:31:29] I've been set free.
[1:31:33] My God, my Savior
[1:31:38] has ransomed me.
[1:31:42] And like of love
[1:31:46] his mercy reign,
[1:31:50] unending love,
[1:31:55] amazing
[1:31:56] grace. Sing it again. My chains are
[1:32:00] gone.
[1:32:03] I've been set free.
[1:32:07] My God, my Savior
[1:32:12] ransom me.
[1:32:15] And like a flood
[1:32:19] his mercy reigns.
[1:32:24] Unending love.
[1:32:28] Can we go up a key?
[1:32:32] Oh, the Lord has promised
[1:32:37] good to me.
[1:32:41] His word,
[1:32:43] my hope it secures.
[1:32:48] Oh, he will.
[1:32:51] my shield
[1:32:53] and portion
[1:32:57] as long as life.
[1:33:02] Sing it now. All my chains are gone.
[1:33:08] I've been set free.
[1:33:12] My God, my Savior,
[1:33:16] answer me.
[1:33:20] And like a flood,
[1:33:24] his mercy reigns,
[1:33:28] unending love,
[1:33:32] amazing
[1:33:33] grace.
[1:33:36] All the earth
[1:33:38] shall soon
[1:33:41] dissolve
[1:33:42] like snow.
[1:33:44] The sun
[1:33:47] forbear to shine.
[1:33:52] But God who called me here
[1:33:58] below
[1:34:00] will be
[1:34:02] forever.
[1:34:05] Aren't you glad for that? All my chains
[1:34:08] are gone.
[1:34:11] I've been set free.
[1:34:15] My God, my Savior,
[1:34:19] ransom me.
[1:34:23] And like a flood,
[1:34:27] his mercy reigns.
[1:34:31] Unending love. Amazing
[1:34:36] grace. Sing it now. All my chains are
[1:34:40] gone.
[1:34:42] I've been set free.
[1:34:46] My God, my Savior,
[1:34:51] ransom me.
[1:34:54] And like a flood,
[1:34:58] his mercy reigns.
[1:35:02] Unending love,
[1:35:06] amazing
[1:35:08] grace. Oh, unending love,
[1:35:14] amazing
[1:35:15] grace.
[1:35:20] Here's that song. Uh, where would I be?
[1:35:27] God only knows.
[1:35:31] I'm glad to see
[1:35:35] through the eyes of love
[1:35:40] a hopeless case
[1:35:43] an empty place
[1:35:47] if it wasn't for grace.
[1:35:51] Amazing grace.
[1:35:55] How sweet the sound. Aren't you glad for
[1:35:58] grace? I once was lost,
[1:36:03] but now I'm found.
[1:36:06] I was a hopeless case.
[1:36:12] Oh, an empty place.
[1:36:14] If not for grace,
[1:36:18] where would I be?
[1:36:22] Lord, you only know.
[1:36:26] I'm glad you see
[1:36:30] through the eyes of love
[1:36:34] as a hopeless case
[1:36:38] an empty place
[1:36:42] if not for grace. last lines. A hopeless
[1:36:47] case,
[1:36:50] an empty place
[1:36:53] if not for grace.
[1:36:58] Oh, what can wash away my sins?
[1:37:06] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:37:14] What can make
[1:37:17] us whole again?
[1:37:21] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:37:27] Sing it now. Oh,
[1:37:31] precious
[1:37:33] is the flow
[1:37:36] that
[1:37:38] makes us
[1:37:41] white as snow

[1:37:45] other
[1:37:48] found time. No,
[1:37:51] it's nothing but the blood
[1:37:55] of Jesus.

[1:38:03] This I see.
[1:38:06] Nothing but the blood. Is that all you
[1:38:10] can say? Hallelujah.
[1:38:13] All for my pardon.
[1:38:17] This my plea.
[1:38:21] It's nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:38:27] Oh,
[1:38:31] precious
[1:38:32] is that flow
[1:38:36] that
[1:38:38] makes me
[1:38:41] white as snow.
[1:38:44] No
[1:38:45] other
[1:38:47] found by no
[1:38:51] nothing but the blood of Jes. The last
[1:38:56] lines. Oh, nothing but the blood of Jes.
[1:39:03] One more time I say it's nothing but the
[1:39:07] blood
[1:39:09] of Jesus.
[1:39:14] God bless you is our prayer.
[1:39:17] Love you.
[1:39:19] Appreciate each and every one of you.
[1:39:22] I am so glad that we have a pardoning
[1:39:26] grace.
[1:39:28] May that forever be with us
[1:39:33] and never have any confidence in the
[1:39:35] flesh. Amen.
