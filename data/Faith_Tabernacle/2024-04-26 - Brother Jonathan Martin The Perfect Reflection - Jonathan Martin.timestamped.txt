[35:21] good to to be uh acquainted with people
[35:25] that are on their way to heaven
[35:28] and they've made their Journey lighter
[35:31] and getting lighter all the time amen
[35:34] we're under great expectation for God to
[35:36] come for us amen and uh you can be
[35:39] seated for just a few moments I I want
[35:42] to welcome just
[35:43] everyone uh that has come in today and
[35:48] um uh certainly appreciate all of you
[35:50] that have uh made the effort to come and
[35:53] to be part of our meeting and uh we've
[35:55] just uh really been excited to have you
[35:57] and uh looking forward to a wonderful
[35:59] time in the Lord and um you know there's
[36:03] something about when Believers get
[36:04] together they they just expect and um
[36:07] you know I I believe that's what we're
[36:09] going to have this uh this week amen is
[36:12] not just a gathering of human beings
[36:15] it's uh deity God coming Among Us and um
[36:20] he has met with us throughout the years
[36:22] and and uh here and um you know we had
[36:26] uh just I'd heard a and last year I
[36:28] believe it was and the Lord healed her
[36:30] of a eating disorder and uh she's I
[36:33] believe telling brother Andrew she said
[36:35] now I can eat my Chick-fil-A without
[36:38] throwing up and uh you know that's just
[36:41] the way God is he he there's nothing too
[36:44] hard for our Lord nothing and as
[36:47] Believers we just throws at us there's
[36:50] nothing impossible to them that believe
[36:53] ain't that right you know um the prophet
[36:56] said every
[36:58] man that's born of the spirit of God
[37:00] will have to believe in the Supernatural
[37:03] because he is a part of God and he is an
[37:06] offspring of God ain't that right and
[37:10] we're not and uh I I I I love the the
[37:14] brothers that are preaching and they've
[37:16] got tremendous Ministries great gifts
[37:19] that God has placed in their life amen
[37:22] but more than anything we're here to see
[37:24] God God to come and and move among H us
[37:28] and you know uh we see the value of
[37:31] coming together and putting our licks of
[37:34] fire uh uh together and uh we we've come
[37:38] under a promise that Jesus gave us that
[37:40] where two or three are gathered in my
[37:42] name there will I be in their midst and
[37:46] I believe God is here do you believe
[37:48] that not only have we been in under
[37:51] expectation but God has been under
[37:53] expectation I truly believe that I
[37:55] believe that these meetings are ordained
[37:57] of God before the foundation of the
[37:58] world and he ordained it for this week
[38:01] this time and says I will be there I
[38:05] will be there every service and and uh
[38:08] you know uh we we uh we we've had a lot
[38:11] of rain a lot of wind and it's been
[38:15] really cold and uh but we we set up the
[38:18] date to set this tin up and we knew we
[38:20] could put up with the cold but the rain
[38:22] and the wind we just and that day that
[38:26] uh we decided to do this and the day
[38:29] come God gave us perfect weather no rain
[38:33] no
[38:34] wind
[38:37] beautiful and
[38:39] uh that may be something small to you
[38:42] but it was something significant to
[38:44] me and it stood the test amen and here
[38:48] we are tonight and uh so I I I certainly
[38:52] love the Lord and uh the Bible talks of
[38:56] uh King uh joab
[38:58] when he had heard of the Prophet Elisha
[39:01] uh that was sick and he had went to
[39:04] visit him and the prophet uh brother
[39:07] bradam says when he went to visit him he
[39:09] didn't come irreverent but he come with
[39:13] respect he walked up so he had enough
[39:16] God about him to know that he must visit
[39:19] this Prophet with respect and he said
[39:22] that's the way you want to get something
[39:24] from God don't come around a meeting
[39:26] like this to make fun don't come around
[39:28] to pack some kind of a tail from one
[39:31] place to another he said if you do that
[39:33] you'll never get nowhere with God he
[39:36] said don't read the Bible to fuss about
[39:38] it read the Bible to live it he said
[39:41] that's right he said and when he went
[39:43] down there he seen him and he respected
[39:45] him and he said my father my father the
[39:48] Chariots of Israel and the horse he said
[39:50] in other words my father you're worth
[39:52] more than all the Chariots of Israel and
[39:55] all the horsemen thereof he said how
[39:57] true that is I say tonight that though
[40:00] Elijah was considered a Holy Roller and
[40:02] a fanatic by the modern world yet his
[40:06] presence in that nation was worth more
[40:08] than all the horses and the Chariots
[40:11] profit our way did you enjoy the service
[40:14] last
[40:16] night
[40:19] wow and we we got a got off to a great
[40:24] start uh last night and and uh
[40:28] uh way I believe it it was pure message
[40:32] what we heard last night and everything
[40:35] that brother Brandon preached about
[40:38] adoption uh we heard it last night
[40:41] things that brother Brandon taught about
[40:43] the third pull and Perfection we heard
[40:45] it last night and I can truly believe
[40:48] with all of my heart that God was
[40:50] pleased amen and uh it's something that
[40:53] I could say Amen 1,000% to it amen do

[44:57] scripture to us we'll read Luke
[45:07] 17:30 John 14 and verse 6 Jesus saith
[45:11] unto him I am the way the truth and the
[45:17] life no man cometh unto the father but
[45:22] by me if ye had known me ye should have
[45:26] known my father also and from him unto
[45:29] him Lord show us the father and it
[45:33] sufficeth us Jesus saith unto him have I
[45:37] been so long time with you and yet hast
[45:41] thou not known me philli he that hath
[45:44] seen me hath seen the father and how
[45:48] sayest thou then and the father in me
[45:52] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[45:55] not of myself
[45:57] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[46:00] doeth The Works believe me that I am in
[46:04] the father and the father in me or else
[46:08] believe me for the very Works sake The
[46:11] Works that I do shall he do also and
[46:15] Greater Works than these shall he do
[46:18] because I go unto my father and
[46:22] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[46:24] will I do that the the father may be
[46:28] glorified in the son now St John I am
[46:33] the vine ye are the
[46:36] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[46:41] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[46:44] for without me ye can do nothing if a
[46:48] man abide not in me he is cast forth as
[46:51] a branch and is withered and Men gather
[46:55] them and cast them Into the Fire and
[46:58] they are burned if ye abide in me and my
[47:02] words abide in you you shall ask what
[47:05] you will and it shall be done unto you
[47:10] herein is my father
[47:12] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[47:16] shall ye be my
[47:19] disciples now Luke
[47:22] 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day
[47:27] when the son of man is
[47:29] revealed now if we could just bow our
[47:33] heads for a word of prayer and maybe
[47:36] you've brought uh a need a request on
[47:39] your heart why don't you just lift that
[47:41] up before the throne of grace and I know
[47:44] that God sees it God hears the heart's
[47:47] cry
[47:48] father Lord we come before you as your
[47:52] children Lord Sons and Daughters of the
[47:56] Living God God and Lord we just ask that
[47:59] you would move by your spirit Among Us
[48:02] hide us beneath your blood Lord I pray
[48:06] that you would just discern every heart
[48:09] and every life and I pray that you would
[48:12] Minister to the in such a wave of the
[48:15] supernatural Holy Spirit and just touch
[48:18] every heart and life oh God lord move us
[48:22] out of the way and I pray father that
[48:25] you would anoint the word and Lord let
[48:28] it just hit the mark we ask in the name
[48:31] of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless
[48:35] you you can be
[48:37] seated uh I would like to uh just take
[48:41] for a uh text uh the perfect
[48:46] reflection and uh we know that according
[48:50] to Ephesians uh this the first
[48:53] chapter uh that Paul said said that this
[48:57] is the
[48:59] dispensation of the fullness of time
[49:02] that he might gather together in one all
[49:06] things in Christ now uh the the prophet
[49:10] of God in adoption uh part three when he
[49:15] was reading this the this is the
[49:17] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[49:20] says now this is now is the dispensation
[49:25] of adoption read Ephesians uh the first
[49:29] chapter and uh brother Wayne just
[49:32] brought these things out so beautiful
[49:34] and we just pray that we can build upon
[49:38] uh what he was speaking on but Ephesians
[49:42] the first chapter uh the 7th to the 9th
[49:46] verse it says in whom to The Riches of
[49:50] his grace wherein he hath abounded
[49:54] toward us in all wisdom and Prudence
[49:58] having made known unto us the mystery of
[50:02] his will according to his good pleasure
[50:05] which he hath purposed in himself now
[50:09] the prophet of God is reading this and
[50:13] he comes to this and he says having made
[50:15] known unto us the mystery of his will to
[50:20] adopt us and he would say he purposed
[50:24] this himself before the the foundation
[50:27] of the world how many understands it
[50:30] amen so the mystery of his will is to
[50:35] adopt us now what we have received in
[50:38] this hour in this age or this
[50:41] dispensation of adoption is a message of
[50:45] adoption how many believes that amen as
[50:48] the prophet of God would say in
[50:50] recognizing your day and its message he
[50:53] would say the spirit of God which is the
[50:56] word of God my word is spirit and life
[51:00] will put the bride in her place she'll
[51:05] recognize her position in the word and
[51:10] you see H you know Satan has done
[51:13] everything he can to put fear
[51:15] surrounding the promises of God Amen to
[51:19] get us to looking at our our flaws and
[51:22] we looked at ourselves uh we would see
[51:25] flawed human beings
[51:27] amen but we heard last night amen that
[51:30] Perfection comes by the perfect
[51:34] sacrifice of the Lamb amen it is the
[51:37] blood of Jesus Christ that perfects us
[51:41] that makes us holy that fulfills the
[51:44] very commandment of God be ye therefore
[51:48] perfect even as Our Father which is in
[51:52] heaven is perfect amen but you see Satan
[51:55] is always trying
[51:57] to bring a fear a fear of failure amen a
[52:01] fear of mistakes and past mistakes and
[52:06] future mistakes and what if I believe
[52:09] this what if I confess this and begin to
[52:12] identify with this message and actually
[52:14] say that this is who I am and this is
[52:17] what the message has identified that I
[52:21] am what what if I fall short of the
[52:24] glory of God well let's just go go ahead
[52:26] and declare that All Flesh has fallen
[52:29] short of the glory of God Amen but that
[52:33] is not where our Perfection lies our
[52:36] Perfection lies in the finished work of
[52:39] Calvary that when the Lamb of God which
[52:42] was taking your place was nailed on
[52:44] Calvary and he cried it is finished he
[52:49] forever settled the sin question you are
[52:53] not guilty you are no longer it is no
[52:57] longer held against you it is no longer
[53:01] held against your charge but you are the
[53:04] perfect sinless uh Justified Bride of
[53:08] the Lord Jesus Christ we're not
[53:10] preaching a Luther's message uh we are
[53:12] not preaching uh a message of a closed
[53:15] book uh we are preaching a message
[53:18] through the revealing of the son of man
[53:21] that you are the blood bought you are
[53:23] the redeemed you never sinned the first
[53:26] place uh I didn't say it he said it uh
[53:30] he Vindicated Calvary he proclaimed the
[53:34] good news uh that because I live you
[53:37] live also he's not dead uh he's alive uh
[53:42] and this message is not a dead Christ uh
[53:45] it's a living resurrected Christ uh that
[53:48] is waving the good news uh over a people
[53:51] that is predestinated to the adoption of
[53:55] sons
[53:56] come to your
[53:58] position come to your identity of who
[54:01] you
[54:03] are oh how Satan hates it
[54:06] though you see he'll he'll he'll He
[54:10] he'll keep
[54:11] barking amen he'll keep talking he'll
[54:15] keep Whispering all of his
[54:16] lies amen he'll keep telling you you're
[54:19] not able you're not worthy it's not for
[54:24] you amen but just see the prophet of God
[54:28] actually would say I have found the weak
[54:32] spot of Pentecostal people by God's help
[54:35] now this is a prophet amen this this is
[54:39] a prophet that is Discerning the problem
[54:42] of the Pentecostal people and he says I
[54:45] have found the weak spot by God's help
[54:49] that is your
[54:51] scared that's right that's true you're
[54:54] just scared to take God God at his word
[54:58] and you don't know who you are if you
[55:02] only realize what position you are in
[55:06] heaven tonight there would be something
[55:09] take place here well I just simply
[55:12] believe uh that there is a people under
[55:16] their message is coming to their place
[55:19] uh and they realize who they are and
[55:23] there is something that can take place
[55:27] I tell you there's something greater
[55:29] amen than just being the blind eyes
[55:31] being open there's something even
[55:33] greater than just a shout or an
[55:35] emotional service but there's a people
[55:38] that are manifesting the word
[55:41] manifesting the very thoughts of God
[55:43] Amen momies and daddies families uh that
[55:46] are coming under the headship of Christ
[55:49] uh realizing there's something here that
[55:53] can take
[55:54] place something here that is bringing a
[55:57] rise in faith it's all that is taking
[56:01] place in this age accumulating in our
[56:05] hearts and we are in the
[56:09] Rapture something taking
[56:13] place you see I believe the message has
[56:17] so dealt with the fear and scare that
[56:21] Satan has put on the church
[56:27] to utterly conquer and subdue
[56:31] fear you see he did it by revealing who
[56:34] you
[56:35] are that you're not going to be but
[56:40] now say with me
[56:43] now I am the sons of
[56:46] God you see Ephesians the 1 chapter the
[56:49] 4th verse says according as he had
[56:53] chosen Us in him before to the
[56:56] foundation of the world that we now the
[56:59] prophet of God would let us know amen
[57:02] that a good day is not a sign of God's
[57:05] approval neither a bad day is a sign of
[57:09] God's disapproval but we but what we've
[57:12] got to know is God's love is elective
[57:16] love and we know he loved us because he
[57:20] it is God that
[57:23] justifies and nothing can say separate
[57:26] us from the love of God again God's love
[57:30] is election when did God choose you
[57:34] before you made one
[57:36] mistake when you ever had a good day or
[57:38] a bad day before you had he
[57:42] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[57:45] image of his son the word Christ uh and
[57:48] there is nothing that is going to
[57:50] separate that
[57:51] purpose God has swore by an oath that
[57:55] he's going to have the bride in the last
[57:57] days uh that is spotless white uh that
[58:00] is going to come under the reflection of
[58:03] the son of man the word for this day to
[58:07] Manifest this portion of the
[58:10] word absolutely Romans 8:30 moreover
[58:15] whom he did
[58:18] predestinate them he also called and
[58:21] Lumi called them he also Justified and
[58:26] whom he justified them he also glorified
[58:31] the prophet of God would say notice this
[58:34] is an unconditional Covenant this has
[58:37] nothing to do with you this has nothing
[58:39] to do amen well if you do this I'll do
[58:43] this and well I've got to you know I
[58:45] feel good and I feel like a Christian so
[58:48] I'm I must be glorified amen or well you
[58:51] wake up tomorrow and you're in a bad
[58:53] you're having a bad day well I must not
[58:55] be called I must not be glorified the
[58:59] prophet of God said this is an
[59:00] unconditional Covenant he swore by
[59:03] himself amen hallelujah the prophet of
[59:07] God says God has already glorified his
[59:11] church those who he justified he also
[59:15] glorified in the church in Christ if
[59:18] you're justified in Christ you're
[59:20] glorified in Christ already as far as
[59:23] God is concerned
[59:26] aren't you glad to know what how God's
[59:29] concerned with
[59:31] you amen Jesus said there and Jesus said
[59:35] be therefore perfect even as your father
[59:37] in Heaven is perfect how could you ever
[59:40] be perfect but in the sight of Christ
[59:43] tonight every born again Christian is
[59:47] perfect I'm just as perfect in God as
[59:51] Christ was you are too every other
[59:54] believer it's not my Holiness is his
[59:57] Holiness God cannot accept mine I have
[1:00:00] none but
