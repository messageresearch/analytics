The Lord and able to make it this evening. And um if you have your Bibles, we're going to just go right on into the word. Matthew the 9th chapter. And um uh brother John's surgery went good today. And so we're thankful to the Lord for that and able to go home and um good to have brother Mark and sister Crystal back with us. Amen. Gone over the weekend and brother Terry uh uh decided to stay home tonight due to the weather and I think that was a smart thing. He they drive a long ways and u and so we uh want to just keep them in prayer. Amen. And uh I'm sure they're streaming today and this evening. But uh before we go into the word, may we bow our heads and talk to our Lord. Father, truly you are lovely. And Lord, there's just no words to describe what you are, who you are, and Father, but we certainly make a feeble attempt to let you know just what you mean to us. And Father, we just asking that you would come and you would uh feel at home just to fellowship with us, commune with us. Father, the worship has been done, the songs sung, the music played, but now Lord, may you speak through us, to us, through your word. Anoint me, Lord, just help me to get myself out of the way. And Lord, and may the people get themselves out of the way. And Lord, may just be a supernatural happening tonight. You know the needs that are present, Father. That we may not even know the needs, our own needs, but Lord, you know them. For you know every part about us, Father. I pray that you would meet them tonight, Lord. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, uh we want to look uh Matthew the 9th chapter and um uh the 3th verse I guess and uh we've read this a couple services now but says and Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. Then if you'll turn to the book of John. Amen. John the 20th chapter. Amen. Now Judy if you could give me some volume in my ear. Deal. um John chapter 20 and um we'll look at verse 21. Says, "Then said Jesus unto them again, peace be unto you, as my father hath sent me, even so send I you." As my father has sent me, even so send I you. Amen. You can have your seats this evening. And um I want to again use the title doing our best for the Lord. And um I think that's all that God requires. And so we realize that it's not human ability that God is after. Um, brother Bram said we got to to master the thought of human ability. We got to get away from that human element, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And um but yet it's it's human beings that um that God is working for or uh through. I believe that God has sent us as uh laborers in his vineyard. And I like how the prophet said it. He said, "Now he sends us the same way he send the father sent him." Which we just read that. And he said the the the way that the father sent him is that the father went with him even in him. And so this is where Jesus said that the father dwelleth in me and he doeth the works. &gt;&gt; So this is u um how God the the father sent sent Christ and we find that the bible says that Christ was the uh image of the invisible God. Uh the prophet would tell us he was he said it this way he was the visible image of the invisible God. &gt;&gt; So Jesus says he that hath seen me hath seen the father. So we see that God bottled himself up into one man. all that God was in the uh throughout the Old Testament and everything that he had uh revealed himself as, he bottled it all up himself into uh one human being and that was Jesus Christ. And and so uh as the prophet would use the word immorph, God immorphed himself into Jesus Christ and became a man. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Paul would tell us there in uh Philippians 2 and 7, it says that he took upon him the form of a man or form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. So this is God. God took on the form of a man. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and this word amorpha uh means that he changed himself. Amen. So the prophet said the only thing that God did when he became a man was he changed his mask. &gt;&gt; He didn't change his power. He didn't change his character. He didn't change who he was. um uh it didn't degrade God or make God any less by uh going with Christ and becoming man. &gt;&gt; Of course, we know that that um uh Jesus uh is the uh human name of God. Amen. And and so God becoming man, he he changed himself as the prophet said uh from the pillar of fire and he became man. &gt;&gt; You you wouldn't see the pillar of fire uh uh there because it it was all God in in uh as a human being, &gt;&gt; right? But then he changed himself back into spirit form &gt;&gt; uh the pillar of fire for a reason and that was the prophet said that he might dwell in men. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; humans. &gt;&gt; So not just one man Jesus Christ. Amen. But that he would dwell in human beings. And the reason why he would dwell in human beings is to carry on his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's what uh um uh God would do. Not everything was fulfilled in Christ in the sense that uh all prophecy now Christ fulfilled all prophecy concerning Messiah for that day. But there's still scripture being fulfilled today that God determined not to do in that body, but he would do it in the body of other men. Amen. the body of men and women, boys and girls. And so the prophet said he returned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work, reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these future days. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to be a part of that. So this is why Jesus would say, "The works that I do shall you do also." &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just me that's going to do the works, but I'm showing you what works, but you're going to do them. The works that I'm showing you, the works that I'm doing, you're going to do them. &gt;&gt; Even greater than these shall you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so uh uh through through throughout the Bible, yes, God uh had prophesied of Messiah and prophesied of what he would do and what he would become. But he also prophesied uh of a people to come. He prophesied of what he would do. And and and and even in the Old Testament uh speaks of our day and and age in in in many scriptures, but Joel 2:28, "And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh." So, it isn't just going to be one man, Jesus Christ, that that has the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But now, he God has promised that he would pour out his spirit and and it would be upon men. It'd be upon women. It would be upon uh boys and girls. It would be upon uh white people, black people, uh uh brown people, yellow people, uh uh men of all colors, and of every race. Amen. That he would pour out his spirit up upon Amen. And and so uh this was a prophecy that was laying there. Amen. And and so when Jesus was saying, "As the father sent me, so I send out send you." &gt;&gt; He he wasn't speaking out of turn, but it was actually uh in in in accordance to the prophecies that had been laying there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he knew there would come a time that the spirit of God would that was in him would now come upon men and women. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it wouldn't just make it wouldn't make them church members. It it it it wouldn't be just to learn about the the word and but it would put them into action. It would put them in as laborers and and in the in the the ministry &gt;&gt; and and so uh so here uh the the Bible says I'll pour out of my spirit upon all flesh. Now uh the prophet says when it says here that he emptied himself or poured out. Now uh we would think like this that he vomit up the English word of empty or pour out from him. Um something that went out of him. So you know this cup got water and and to pour it it it it would be pouring coming out of of of the cup. Amen. That that's the way we would say pour out. &gt;&gt; You know, something went out of him that was different from him. But the word kenos in the Greek does not mean that he vomit up or his arm went off or his eye went out another person. But it it means that he changed himself. I pour out my spirit. Not something different from him. It's just that he changes himself by pouring himself into the human being. Amen. Into another mask, into another form. Not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit. But it was he himself that he promised to pour into the people. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so we we find he himself poured himself into the people. Christ, everybody say Christ in you. &gt;&gt; That's that's what it is. That's what that means. Christ in you is that God poured himself into you. not not just another something of God or uh uh a little part of God or whatever, but he poured himself into you. And he says, see how beautiful, how wonderful to think God pouring himself into the human being into the believer. It was part of his drama to do so. Ain't that right? So then we we can look if if the same God that that came into that body of Jesus Christ and then then and that God dwells in us today. Then we can look and at at the scriptures and and look at his ministry, look at his works, look at what he was and see a comparison of of that supernatural God living in us. So it's just like in Luke 4:18, Jesus tells us why he was sent. &gt;&gt; He was sent with a purpose. uh uh for a purpose and that was he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Amen. So he knew why he was anointed. He knew why he was sent. Amen. This is why not not just to build a not to build a program, but but to set at liberty them that are bruised. &gt;&gt; To preach the gospel to them that are poor, &gt;&gt; to open the blinded eyes. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, not only was he sent, but he was anointed. The spirit of the Lord hath anointed me. Ain't that right? Acts 10:38 it says how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. Everybody say, "And with power." &gt;&gt; Who went about doing good, healing all that were oppressed of the devil. For God was with him. &gt;&gt; That's how God sent him. God sent him by going with him and being in him. And he was anointed of God. And he w he healed the sick. He raised the dead. Amen. Because God was with him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so his ministry wasn't a natural ministry. Amen. But it was a supernatural ministry. Even Nicodemus came to Jesus by night. Amen. and and and said, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher from God, for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So So even the the religious teachers knew the the the religious church, they knew that that Jesus was different from the rest. &gt;&gt; And they knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that God was with them. They wouldn't admit it. Amen. That's why he would he went to him at night and he would tell him these things. Amen. He was telling him exactly what they were all talking about. Amen. At at the table, you know, when the ministers all met, they were talking about how God was with that man and and all that and they hated him for it. Amen. Because he wasn't part of their organization. But Nicodemus was admitting it that there's something different about you. Amen. Other preachers have come. Other men have come. But something's different about you. And and and we have to come to this conclusion, amen, that that no man can do these things except God be with him. &gt;&gt; See, so God would show, Amen. how he sent Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And and Christ was anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power. Ain't that right? So the Holy Ghost and power go hand in hand. Amen. That's right. This is why Jesus said in Acts 18, "And you shall receive power after that the holy uh the Holy Ghost has come upon you." You shall receive power, not just receive the Holy Ghost and and and waiting for something else to happen. You shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. So you cannot have the Holy Ghost and not be anointed and not have power. Amen. See, so if you've got the Holy Ghost here tonight, you have the power of God. Amen. The same power that was in Christ, you have and you're anointed just as with the anointing that he was anointed with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, Pentecostals have they tend to uh uh associate um the power of God with dancing and with shouting and running over the you know running around the church and and uh all these things and that's fine. But the prophet tells us that's not the power of God. &gt;&gt; That's the blessings of God. &gt;&gt; And and God promised that he would put for his blessings upon the just and the unjust. Amen. and and so uh you see people getting emotions and and they shout and they dance and and all that but but but that's not that's not the power of God. Brother Bram said you can do all of that and still not have enough faith to heal a toothache. See, so that's just blessings of God. And he says there there's a lot of difference between blessings and power. God makes his blessings upon the the righteous and unrighteous. See, but the blessings is not what uh is not the thing that breaks the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus didn't just go running all over around, you know, uh the and and and the blind man was saw. Amen. He didn't run around the casket and the and and and the dead man rose. Amen. Uh raised from the dead. Amen. There was something about him. He was anointed. Amen. With the spirit of God and with power. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Many people, I've seen it throughout time. Amen. Many people, Amen. They dance, they shout, and they they run around and and uh I think Brother Bram even called it, you know, bubble dancing. And and and and they do the cartwheels, and they're really into it, you know. They're really feeling something about this, you know, and and we we've seen it, you know, rolling on the floor and and and seen them shaking on the floor. And nothing against those things. Amen. Uh uh but but just trying to tell us, Amen. That's not the power of God. I've seen him do that. And yet still, when it's all said and done, Amen. Many people are still bound by oppression and uh by pornography and and and bound by by malice and hate and bitterness and and and envy and and all of these things after all of that's done. I've seen it, you know, uh remember preaching, you know, at a a meeting and and pastor was really big on people dancing and shouting and so so uh uh uh you know the service probably wasn't going as the way he wanted it at the end. And so he he just took the mic from me. Amen. He says now now because people started lining up for prayer and starting to pray for people and he he finally took it from me. He said, "Brother, that's not how we do things around here, you know." And he says uh he says the way we do it is is I want all the sisters over here, all the brothers over here. And and so you know he starts quoting you know let everything that hath breath praise the Lord and praise him on the drums. Praise him on this, praise him on that. So, I just kind of wandered off over there on the side there and and and uh uh before you know it, he was getting the crowd, the people going and finally they started breaking out and the fast song and and uh everybody was dancing and shouting and so you know, we were over there clapping us guys. It's mainly the sisters that were that were doing the shouting and screaming and uh you know, so finally, you know, the pastor came over and said, "You okay, little brother?" I said, "Yes, sir. I'm I'm doing just fine. He said, "Well, I just want you to know the these people that are dancing got the Holy Ghost. They're really into it." I said, "Well, great. That's fine." I said, "I have no problem. I mean, that's your church, you know, you know." Well, all that time while that was happening, the piano player and one of these girls that was out there dancing was having an affair. And it wasn't but a week later that she ended up pregnant. and and uh well it's it split the church. Uh uh so you can dance and you can shout and you can all that stuff but it doesn't mean your life's changed. See that that's just blessings. Ain't that right? But what we're talking about is an anointing. Jesus was anointed. He was sent anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power to break the power of Satan. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. The blind received their sight. The prostitutes were delivered. Amen. The condemned were set free. The dead were raised. And the blind, amen, uh saw, the lame walked. And first John 3:8, it says, "For this purpose the son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? That's why he was sent. That's why he was manifest. that he might destroy the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil could have heyday in the churches of that day, but he couldn't have heyday with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so this wasn't just a manifestation of a man. Right. &gt;&gt; This wasn't just human human flesh, human works being exalted and and and and uh uh manifested or whatever. Amen. But Paul says without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness, God was manifest in the flesh. &gt;&gt; God was manifested. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; This power, this anointing that Jesus had upon him, it was God in him. God anointed him. God was manifested. God was tabernacling in that body. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's how God sent him. God went with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, so the denominations of that day were trying to do the work of God. Amen. Through human effort. Amen. That's right. See, and God had nothing to do with what they were doing. All their programs, God had nothing to do with it. All their charities, God had nothing to do with it. Everything that they were doing, God had nothing to do with it. God was in a body. Amen. Manifesting himself doing the works of God. The churches of that day, they were a uh uh the body of an organization. Amen. But Christ was the body of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? and the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily in him. So then what about the church today? As the father sent me, so shall I send you. I send you the same way the father sent me. Amen. Well, churches, you know, that are part of the harlot system, we know that they are nothing but a habitation of devils. It's true that that's what the Bible says. It's just a habitation of unclean things, habitation of devils, things like that. But the church of the living God is the body of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the body of Jesus Christ? Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul says about the church, it's the fullness of him that dwelleth all in all, that fleth all in all. So today Christ has come to his full manifestation in his body today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now how is this possible? Well, it was made possible through the work of of of redemption. Amen. Christ's work of redemption. When Christ came, he came through a virgin. And the prophet said God made his promise sure. He stuck with his word. every word of it had to be. So he made it perfect because he was God and couldn't do nothing else. He had to stay with it. But he says, notice the next thing he had to do. The church had to be anointed and sent out. So Christ life, he he while he was walking the earth, he was doing the works of God. He was showing the works of God. Prophet says he was manifested to show God, amen, to the people. So the people saw God in Christ. They saw that he was anointed to do what he was doing. He He had a supernatural ministry, but at the same time, he was making way for a church to be sent out. He knew, amen, that through this work of redemption that he would do, there would be a people that he would send out, amen, with himself in them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he had to to to the church had to be anointed and sent out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before he could keep his promise, he had to make a way for this church to be anointed. And the church after walking with Jesus and knowing Jesus and had received power to heal the sick and do everything, all these ups and downs and things they had had, and yet walked with Jesus, he knew that he had to make a way to send his church out anointed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, so again, he sends us the same way the father sent him. Amen. Now, think of it. Paul after Christ's ascension and and and uh uh these things 2 Corinthians 5:16 says, "Henceforth uh uh no uh wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh. Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more." &gt;&gt; We don't know him after the flesh. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Christ is not to be known in an intellectual way. &gt;&gt; Christ isn't to be made known by natural understanding. Amen. But he is to be known by spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So the prophet said, "This same one who was known as Jesus after the flesh went back to the pillar of fire, but he promised he would come again and dwell amongst his people by the spirit. And on the day of Pentecost, that pillar of fire came down, and it separated itself in tongues of fire upon each one of them." See, what was God doing? He was separating himself into the church. giving all those men and women a part of himself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, we don't know him after the flesh. I can't point you to a the the corporal physical body of Jesus Christ today that once walked the earth, but we are not to know him after that. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, prophet says now we know him after the power of his resurrection. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. We know him now after the power of his resurrection. How do we know? Because his life that was in that body is now in us as the church of the living God. That's how I know of Christ. Amen. That's how I know him. Amen. See, so Paul would say go on in in 2 Corinthians 5:1 17, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new." A ain't that right? Amen. I'm not looking at a at a sinner smoking cigarettes and doing drugs and alcohol and living in adultery and and and living as a sinner. That's not how Christ is made known. that Christ has now come and saved a people, redeemed them, filled them with the Holy Ghost and has come now. Amen. And that person has been changed. That person has been quickened. Can you say amen? Amen. We what we once done, we don't do them anymore. Amen. The things we once enjoyed, we don't enjoy them anymore. The things we once desired, we don't desire to do them anymore. Why? We become a new creature. &gt;&gt; Christ is now got a body that he can make himself known in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God. Notice, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation. Think of that. To which that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we speak for Christ. &gt;&gt; We represent Christ. &gt;&gt; Our move is of Christ. &gt;&gt; Our actions is of Christ. &gt;&gt; Our motivation is of Christ. Everything Christ now is being made known through us. For we are ambassadors. &gt;&gt; His ambassadors. &gt;&gt; So now then, we are ambassadors for Christ. As though God did beseech you by us. We pray you in Christstead. Why? Because we're standing in Christstead. &gt;&gt; We are standing in Christstead, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. That that's that's that's sobering to think that I can't point my children. I can't point the church. You can't point anybody to a physical physical uh uh uh uh uh body of Christ that he was once 2,000 years ago. But they don't need that. I'm his body. You're his body. We are the ambassadors for Christ. We are the representative of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then how should we act that way? Right? &gt;&gt; So we read the book of Acts and see what the church did just after it was established on the day of Pentecost. And God come into them, poured himself into them and and that was just that was just an infant stage of the church. That was the church in seed form. What they done on the days in the days of acts was just done in infant stage. But instead of growing into a complete mature seed uh ripening uh we find that the seed had to go into the ground and die. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the prophet has talked about church ages, the seals and and the different things. But in the feast of the trumpet uh trumpets in in 64, he tells us that for about 2,000 years now, the Holy Spirit has been bound up by these denominational rivers, these demons. The demon powers have kept the Holy Spirit bound up &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; for nearly 2,000 years because they've added to the word they taken away from the word &gt;&gt; till that even the prophet says in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people. People didn't even know what the word said. And it was just enough light, the prophet says down through those ages just to know, you know, to repent or that, you know, that uh uh just just uh enough light for for just a little bit of a thing. But in this age, God promised to send a prophet of Malachi 4 to restore. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Turn our hearts back to the word. &gt;&gt; Take us back. Restore the word back unto us. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Prophet said it that that's the ministry of Elijah was to restore the word. &gt;&gt; Bring back that word. &gt;&gt; Every all and that was even the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished. all those loose ends and people probing at this and men probing at that. Had a lot of scholars and had a lot of literature written about the word and and all of these things and all that learning and all that knowledge and and and fine words and educated words that they used and definitions and all of those things. It was only men probing. &gt;&gt; Probing at the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet. God said it would be a prophet that would come and restore prophet Elijah. And the prophet says now, and it's because of his ministry, we we have no doubt that he has come. I truly believe that brother Brandham's ministry was that that of Malachi 4 that was promised. See, and today the prophet says we have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, what what what does that have to do with what we're talking about? Well, the prophet said this, with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of power. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; With the restoration of the word comes a bride into form. With the restoration of the word comes a church, a mighty church that they become the super race. They become an invincible army. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now we know that God had visited Abraham uh in the form of a of a body a man called Melchz Melzdc. Abraham said it was God and it was God. It's amazing how a prophet he tells us that when God appeared in a form of a man to me uh to Abraham that elected seed, God had this age in mind of he was doing that way before Christ even come to the earth and was born of a virgin. God appeared in a as a man. He ate the food. He drank the the drink that Abraham prepared. &gt;&gt; He had dust on his feet, his clothes, &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; as a man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And yet God looking into this day, showing by that what he would do. The prophet said, "See Lord, the Lord God Elohim was standing there in human flesh, showing that he would so anoint his church in this last day that it would be God working in human flesh again." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So God had his had us in mind. I I think that's just wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. See now because of the message the Holy Spirit has been loosed on &gt;&gt; been loosed back into the church again by this evening time message. &gt;&gt; Prophet says it &gt;&gt; Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time. &gt;&gt; That's right. Another place the prophet said the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls. &gt;&gt; Now church that's happening now. &gt;&gt; Don't don't look at that happening in in the wild blue yonder. It's happening now. &gt;&gt; His ministry showed that Christ is here. &gt;&gt; He even said it. He said, "My ministry is to declare he is here." &gt;&gt; He's here where? In his church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We saw that fullness. Amen. We saw the revealing of the son of man to show us it wasn't just a gam. It wasn't just some feeling. It was he himself &gt;&gt; has come in the church to anoint the church. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Prophet said the pillar of fire has come now to anoint sons of man, sons to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together. See, so again, when when Christ was on the earth, the entire fullness of the godhead bodily rested in him. Prophet said, "Now it's God in men, &gt;&gt; God in women, boys and girls. God, the fullness of God in the Godhead bodily in his entire church." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Manifesting himself, fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Brother Brandham in his prayer he said, "As the wise man saw the three stars line up to be one." And as we see today, Lord, the three attributes of God, Father, Son, Holy Spirit has finally come into the channel. We know they are one. We see all these great signs upon the earth that's appearing and the identification of the son of God dealing in the flesh of his church to carry on his work. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God has got a people, got a church in this age that he can show himself, manifest himself upon the earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. that we don't have to take them somewhere to see God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything that God is has been poured into you. &gt;&gt; The church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Prophet said if he is with the church, he promised to work through the church the same way that God worked through him, the body of Jesus. that God would work through the church by the same spirit, the Holy Spirit. So the mystery of God is being made known to the church. How that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world. The mystery is being made known that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world. How that he and the father were one. How that the great mysteries of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing him bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and in the stream of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifested in the day in the eastern rising of the sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the west to make himself manifested in a bride church, the word made manifest. That's who we are. I think that's that's that's incredible. I think God that God would make that known to us in this age. Now, not to keep you much longer, but we know that spirits are real. Our enemy is real. And Satan is fighting on every hand. We are, as the prophet said, we're we're we're we're crossing, I believe how he said it, sailing uh over waters. And again, we're not wrestling against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The weapons of our warfare are not carnal. &gt;&gt; We're not out there picketing. We're not out there, you know, with guns and bazookas and, you know, trying to defeat a natural enemy. Our enemy is is not natural. &gt;&gt; It it's a spiritual warfare. &gt;&gt; It's demonic. It's and and and you know the prophet said you know the the our denominations and our theology and our training of schools and seminary it has not got us equipped to meet the enemy. The church the natural church is not equipped to meet the enemy. Yeah, &gt;&gt; their programs is not enough to meet the enemy with their professional choirs and their trained uh uh uh ministers and and and all their psychology and it's not enough to meet the enemy with. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. Let's see now what what what tries to hinder you as you fulfill your purpose in in what God has called you to do? What what is it that tries to hinder you to do that? Satan &gt;&gt; Satan tries to hinder every one of us. Right. It it just is. &gt;&gt; What tries to discourage you from pressing on with God? &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's it's the enemy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who who tries to convince you that you're you're worthless and that God doesn't love you and and that there's no use to even trying. It's the enemy. what what what tries to get us to to look at one another and and you know sometimes you know uh maybe Satan comes in in in through the tries to disrupt the family parents can look at the children say man I don't know what to do with that guy I don't know what to do with her you know she's just a grouch and she's just a rebellious ding-dong and you know I don't and and parent, you know, children can look at the parents and man, they're idiots, you know, they they don't love us, they don't this, and they don't that, and they just, you know, and and and and and all of a sudden there's a war affair. There's a struggle there. There's something going on. Maybe it's the husband with the wife, wife with the husband, and all these say, and all it is is a spirit. &gt;&gt; You understand? That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, it's Satan that tries to get us, get you, get me to listen to him and to obey him. &gt;&gt; It's Satan that tries to get us to fall in the line with the natural setting, the natural pattern of humanity. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, it's a spirit that we're fighting. It's not flesh and blood. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; As parents, we must realize this. And you know, the Lord just dealing with me this morning about it, how that Satan will move and cause a commotion within the home to get us to respond in a negative way. And we may look at it, well that's my child and they shouldn't do that or that's, you know, my wife or my husband or whatever. They shouldn't. But but what we've got to understand, it's more than that. It's a spirit that is trying to work and trying to move and trying to it it happens in a church. It happens in a marriage. It happens anywhere. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; To get us to respond in a negative way. Well, what's he doing? What What's he trying to do? He's trying to upset God's program. Isn't that what Satan always wants to do? Is upset God's program. &gt;&gt; He wants us to get out of God's will. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. He did that to Jesus. Jesus had to fight him on every in every hand had to meet him every time Jesus is doing the will of God. Look look look look when Jesus got in the ship. Uh uh Matthew 8 and 23 says and when and when he was entered into the a ship his disciples followed him. He entered into a ship and his disciples followed him. Well why did he get in that boat in the first place? He was going somewhere. to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I was listening to brother Brandham in that um the maniac of Geria. That's where he was headed. He was headed to Geria. He said the reason why he was headed there, there was one soul that was calling for him. &gt;&gt; Not too many souls are calling for him today, but there was one soul &gt;&gt; out of that whole city of Gileia or nation. I don't know what it was. city or nation, one soul that was calling for him. And he got in that ship to go to that one soul. &gt;&gt; That one soul was in need. Right. &gt;&gt; He was not in need for water. He was not in need for money. He was not in need for a car or a house. He was not in need for materialistic things. He was not even in need for a good buddy pal. He was in need for somebody to release him from the devil. &gt;&gt; He was in need for somebody, a man, that could look at that spirit that had him bound and command that spirit to leave him. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Church couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; Religions of that day couldn't do it. But there was one man &gt;&gt; that was sent from God. He was anointed of God. He was filled with God. The fullness of God was in him. He was going to meet that challenge. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And notice in the 24th verse, and behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, &gt;&gt; in so much that the ship was covered with waves, but he was asleep. Now, so in other words, the ship was sinking. The fisherman Peter was a great fisherman. A lot of them were good fishermanmen and they they you know brother Brandham describes it how that wind started picking up the wave start picking up and oh Peter and them say ah don't worry about that we've done this before we can do it again. And they were relying upon their human ability. &gt;&gt; They were relying upon their human experience. Ah don't wake him up. We got this. we'll get him on the other side. But what they didn't realize was the enemy, Satan had got in them winds. Satan had gotten in them waves. Satan was determined to stop that ministry of Christ from going over there and and delivering that man. And Satan was saying, "We'll drown him. We got him in the middle of this thing. We're going to drown him." Amen. And that disciples realized that the it was beyond their human ability. They couldn't do it. the ship was seeking and they had to wake him up. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the waves, the winds and all that rising and the hurricane or whatever was happening, it wasn't by coincidence. This wasn't just a happen chance of nature. &gt;&gt; The enemy was trying to hinder the work. &gt;&gt; But Jesus wasn't scared. Satan knew he was coming and Jesus wasn't scared. Instead, instead he was ready. He was ready to meet Satan. &gt;&gt; He was ready to meet his enemy. He didn't fall apart. He didn't say, "Oh, you disciples, why didn't you tell me these things would happen?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What's going on? I thought you knew what to do. &gt;&gt; No. Jesus recognized the enemy &gt;&gt; and he got on that bow of the ship as that winds was a rocking and the the waves going every which way and he says peace be still and the winds calmed. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A man anointed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A man sent from God. A man who was the creator. A man had now stood on that boat and by the words something that no human being could ever do but God was with him. This was a man. Amen. That was there to show God. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And the prophet said when you are sent of God, you're ready to meet the enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't fall apart. You're ready to meet the enemy. You are sent of God to do the work of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, we know as as matured Christians, as matured believers, and I say God mature us more that we can recognize the enemy when he tries to come in. I I don't care what he he'll come in any form. He'll he'll try to get you depressed. He'll try to get you uh with anxiety or he'll move through someone else. &gt;&gt; He He'll try to work in the home. He'll try to work in the marriage. And if you're not careful, you'll end up fussing with your wife and your wife will end up fussing with you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you're not careful, you'll start, you know, uh uh there'll be a wall start being built between the the parents and the child. &gt;&gt; Come on. Well, church, that's the common thing today. There are so many divorce rates are rising. &gt;&gt; Homes are being just torn apart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when it comes to our home, &gt;&gt; we've been anointed of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We've been sent of God and anointed to deal with this thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ready to meet the challenge. I hope you understand. &gt;&gt; So, we we find that when he got onto the other side, this demonic man of 2,000 demons come running and felt and worshiped him. And and you know, brother Brown was talking. says, "You know, people think, well, how in the world how in the world could a man full of demons fall down and worship him, worship worship Christ?" He said, "Because he had a religious devil in him." He said, "There's a lot of demon-possessed people that come to church and worship God and all it is is a religious devil &gt;&gt; because they ain't got an experience with God. They they've not gone into the depths of God to really get down and get the Holy Ghost to deliver them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So Jesus did what he was sent to do and that was to set that man free. Listen church, Jesus didn't run from his problem. Jesus didn't run from the challenge. Jesus didn't just shy away from the enemy. He met that enemy head on &gt;&gt; cuz he was sin of God to do so. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't run from the challenges. David didn't run away. David actually ran to the enemy. Why? He was anointed to do it. He knew he was anointed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He may have not felt the power of God. He may have not been running all over the building shouting glory to God. And he may have not felt nothing, but he knew this one thing. He was anointed to meet that challenge of the enemy. Amen. I like how brother Brandham in his prayer at the end of the service, he said, "Father, we go now to meet the enemy, to meet the lion, to meet the devil on every form that he's called that he's in called cancer, tuberculosis, Hodinson's disease, heart trouble, any other disease. We've come to meet him, not shy away from it, to to meet him. We've come to bind him and bring in this lamb back to the house of God again. Can you say amen? You're going to meet your enemy. Remember the prophet already told us that. And and and and you're going to meet your enemy. And you got to realize it's it's whatever front he's coming in. It's not natural. It's not a natural thing. It's not a natural warfare for you to struggle and you to and fall apart and and take nerve pills and and I'm just about to lose my mind and and all these things. It's for you to stand there as anointed son and daughter of God &gt;&gt; and meet the challenge. &gt;&gt; Not in your own self. Can you say amen? You're going to have to overcome that enemy. That's right. And Jesus was tempted in all points as we are. But he overcome, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking. He was tempted by women. He was tempted by by the pleasures of life. He was tempted with pride. He was tempted with everything that is known to man to be tempted by. He was tempted and he overcome. &gt;&gt; Now notice, I get very close that brother said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and and I I'll tell you the message of the hour helps us to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks. &gt;&gt; A lot of people say there is no devil. It's just a thought. Don't you believe that? There is a real devil. He's just as real as you are or anybody. A real devil. And you must recognize him real, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't just play it off. &gt;&gt; You know, there there was uh uh things going on in a in a church and uh just turmoil, just just a mess. and being uh another brother uh well, brother Wayne, we were talking about it and and how how just it just seemed like it just uh uh uh I don't know just just on every every front. Brother Wayne said he went back to the hotel. He said he got he woke up in the middle of the night just a weird feeling and he saw something move above the door and he looked and he there was a dark dark something there just in a form and it was looking at him and he got scared and a voice told him says don't be scared it's just a spirit that's all it is it's just a spirit spirit. He said when it come to him and he really understood that that couldn't hurt him, it was just the spirit. That thing left him left in the room. And that's the trouble with a lot of things that go on, whether it's in the home, whether it's in a church, or whether it's in an individual. It's just a spirit. &gt;&gt; We panic. We're looking at this. It's just the spirit. The thing is, you've been anointed to meet that spirit. &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus did, every front the enemy came to him at, he was anointed. The church couldn't do it. They couldn't meet it. Not in that day. The people couldn't do it. The minister couldn't do it. But in this age, there's a people, a redeemed, the body of Christ that have the fullness of God, right? And and now we're we're we're we're coming to being able to recognize no matter where he comes in at, it's just a spirit. If it comes in the form of a physical, whether it's a cancer, tuberculosis, heart troubles, arthritis, Parkinson's, it's just a spirit. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Whether he's coming in a mental to where it just seemed like it's a breakdown and and we don't It's just a spirit. &gt;&gt; Whether he's coming and he's attacking my wife or or my children or uh coming at me in a personal way or what, it's just a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; I've been anointed for this. You've been anointed for this. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God reserved the best for the last. He put you in this age, most evil age, the most deceptive age, the most worst age, but you're here anointed, sent from God to meet the challenge. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, Brother Bram said, "See, you recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you. Then to overcome, you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier than he is. That the one that's in you has already overcome him. And by his grace, you're more than a match for him." There's real overcoming when you recognize you don't have to dance anymore. You don't have to fast anymore. You don't have to whatever anymore. Just recognize him. Recognize the devil and recognize that the God in you is greater than that devil and you're more than a match for that thing. &gt;&gt; Then you overcome him &gt;&gt; because that's what you were sent to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Often times we don't see the value of our position and it's easier to look at someone else and how they're being used of God and maybe they're they're greatly anointed of God and and it just seems like they're doing great things for God and if you're not careful you you get discontent with where you're at and with what you're doing and feel like it's just you know it's it's just kind again like the man with that one talent. &gt;&gt; I I just got this. The others are doing great. This is all I got. &gt;&gt; And and and by this we get discontent with what God's called us to do, the position that God's called us and and and all these things. And we can even let people steer us into doing something that's not of God. We become so discontent and dissatisfied that someone knew it wouldn't even have to have a prophecy. Just, hey, you ought to do this. Okay, let's do that. And it can be a worldly influence that we come under or a religious spirit that we let influences. How many people, good people, leave leave their position because they don't think they're doing any good with what they're at, with where they're at, with what they're doing, and and all that. I'll tell you, it's your enemy that's coming at you. &gt;&gt; So many women walk away from their position in the home to go out and work. God didn't call them to work. God called them to raise their babies. God called them to be a a housewife. More women are becoming complainers about having to stay at home and be a housewife and a mother. And and that's because Hollywood has glamorized this. They they have devalued home life. They have devalued traditional family. They have devalued the importance of a a a mother, a housewife, uh uh uh all of these things. and they've glamorized women in the workplace. So, women feel like they're missing out on life. And then we see that the roles are changing to where men are becoming more sisified because the role of a man, the character of a man have been so devalued and belittled by Hollywood and other things. But I uh but what a prophet told us is God put motherhood in the home for a reason. Motherhood is the backbone. When you break motherhood, you break the nation. &gt;&gt; Is that not what a prophet said? That's right. &gt;&gt; So then you you've got a position and it may not seem like you're running, you know, uh, chariot races like everybody else is, but you're staying with what God's called you. There's a position that God's called you to do. thought about, you know, Rebecca Smith talking about her mom, Ma, and how other ministers, their wives were traveling with them all the time, being put in the forefront and and these things. But her mother, she asked her mom, "Why why don't you why don't you go with dad? Why don't you do all that?" She says, "I'm not called to do that. That's not me. That's not my ministry." And she said, "Well, man," she said, 'You know, she says, "I hate iron." She, you know, she Rebecca was said, she goes, "Man, I hate iron. I don't see how you love to iron." She said, "Becca, I never said I love to iron." She I hate it, but that's my place. And she said, you know, she one time I was just wondering why why why can't I be out like that? Why why can't I be out like these other women? Why do I have to be here? And then she realized, she goes, "I'm not doing anything here." And all that, but then she said, 'You know, it just come to me that I could be praying for your daddy. I could be praying for and and so she says that I determined that every clothes I ironed of his, every shirt, every pants, every whatever, I'd be praying, "God help Bill, God use him, God keep him, God protect him." And and you remember, Brother Brandham says, "My ministry is because of her. the success of my ministry is because of what she was doing. She was a prayer. She recognized that it wasn't she didn't have to be out there to be be somebody. She didn't have to do be out there. Amen. To do something for God. What God had called her, she took to heart. &gt;&gt; You love him. And I I I want to say that for you mothers, you housewives, it's not just the minister that has anointed you, you men that are workers and and things, but God has come to anoint every member of his body. He's come to anoint the housewife. He's come to anoint the the electrician, the computer technician. He's he's come to anoint the carpenter. He's come. So don't let the devil devalue your position in Christ. And I say that again, your position in Christ, don't let the devil devalue that. Because see, it's not it's not your position as husband or housewife or electrician or whatever that brings the power, even though God's called you for that, but it's your position in Christ. Right. &gt;&gt; So there there's other housewives, there's others plumbers, there's other men that go and work, there's other employees, employers, and and and and things like that. But the difference is your position in Christ. You have been sent and anointed of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's your position. See, uh in Christ, so your place in Christ matters. And in your position, you're sent. You're called to stop the devil in his tracks. In your position, if the musicians will come, I pray that God helps us to be more aware of that. Brother Brandham talking to the housewife, he said, "You got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost. You're just as much David as the rest of them was." Can you say amen? So, here you are. Satan may be Satan's got traps. He Satan plans for these things, man. This isn't just something he just comes up with. He plans these things and he's looking and he's he's trying his best. He works it step by step. And if he gets you out of your position, well, maybe he's got something for your child, thinking, man, I can I can destroy that girl. I can make her a lesbian. I I I could really warp that child. I can't do it because mom, she's a prayer warrior. She's the one that keeping the house clean. How am I going to do that? I've tried. I'm trying, but I have to get through her. So then he starts fighting mama, discouraging mama. Get her away from prayer. get her away from. Well, then Satan said, "hm, maybe I can't get a hold of mama because of dad standing right there in the forefront, keeping the trash out of the home, keeping life clean, keeping dedicated, consecrated." So then he starts working on daddy. And if we're not careful, we think it's just a private war. We just feel the emotions. We just feel, "I'm not doing nothing. Oh, I'm just so discouraged. I I just don't know. I'm just barely hanging. You don't realize you're the one standing in the position to keep Satan from getting old over here, wrecking havoc in your home. And if we get sidetracked to where we're fighting this and fighting that and getting discontent and looking at everything else, Satan's behind us, working on our children, working on this. And And you see, there's a position. There's a position. You are sent. You may not be sent to have prayer lines for millions of people like brother Brandham did, but you're sent there. Wherever you're sent, there's the called to be a housewife, called to be a a pastor of a local church, called to be a deacon, called to be a trustee, whatever you're sent for, you're anointed of God to stand there in the battle. That's just as important as anything else. Can you say amen? I hope it's helped you today. Because if we don't recognize spirits, we we'll handle things wrong. We'll handle it wrong because we're looking at, well, that's just so and so. Well, I'm going to tell him a thing or two. How many times have we done that? and we've had the power to break that spirit. Instead, we caused scars. We've caused horror. We've caused things. We built walls. We've let the walls come up instead of breaking them down because we handle things wrong. And and brothers and sisters, this preacher's had to learn a lot just by response. how you respond. This parent has had to learn and I'm still learning. But I thought today as I just sat there, I couldn't sleep. So I just got up, I you know, and I just just all this coming to me, how you'd handle things, how you handle things, you can either you you're you're standing in a position, you're anointed to to cast that devil out. Sometimes you cast it out by love. Sometimes you cast it out by just a good response. Sometimes it's just how you handle things. And I thought, "Oh, God, help me." There's ever a time I want my children to see Christ in daddy. I want my wife, I want my church to see Christ in in their preacher. Can you say amen? Hallelujah. We're anointed. So, I don't know what you're going through. I'm telling you, don't panic. Don't fall apart. Don't let the devil work you out to where you just remember, you get out of your position that God can't use you. You allow your heart to get hard. You allow your heart to get bitter. You allow your heart to get so carnal. God can't use you. Can't use you. Stay in a place that you can be used of God. I I've got quotes. I I'll read them later, but brother Bram said, "Stay in a position. Stay in your position. Stay live such a life, consecrated life that when God needs you, he knows exactly where you're at and he can just move up on you. You don't have to go and repent. You don't have to go be, oh, God, you know, let me throw away my television. Let me throw away this. Let me throw away this. Let me get all cleaned up again so you can use me. Stand in your position that God can use you. You love him. Amen. Master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm, make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. First verse. My boat of life sails on the troubled seas. whenever there's a wind in myself. But I have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into again. Sing it now.

Do you know him tonight? I know the master of the will. Glory to God. I know the maker of the rain. Oh, he can calm the storms, make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. He can calm the storm. Oh, and he can calm the storm. Make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. Daniel, can you come up and sing that? There's nothing u impossible or nothing. Whatever that new song we sing. Amen. It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Hey God, do I may worry. Hold my breath till my face turns blue. It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. The children had their backs at Red Sea. And old Pharaoh looked like he had the victory. But the waters roll on back with the wind you do. And it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing.

It ain't nothing for you. And oh Joshua, he took a walk around Jero. And you told him, Lord, you told him that the wall would go and he crumbled at the shout when the trumpet flew.

It ain't nothing for you. How this body is slowly dying without within. Oh, I ain't worried though. The skin worms eat my skin. God, you'll open heaven's doors and I'll walk you right in a nothing. It ain't nothing for you. It ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. I may fall to some everything I do. And I may wor everything I do. I work for my friend, but it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Nothing. It's nothing for him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God bless you is our prayer.

Lord Jesus, we're so thankful that you still reign and that you're supreme in your power. You're supreme.
