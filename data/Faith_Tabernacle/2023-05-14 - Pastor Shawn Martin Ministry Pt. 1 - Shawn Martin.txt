can compare to him and as we go to the Lord in prayer this morning ask brother Terry if you would get ready we want to continue keep brother and sister Walker in prayer we'll just give them encouragement them strength in their bodies amen also we want to pray for the church in Albion they're growing going through some really heavy trials pray that the Lord would help them through these things that they're going through straighten out the situations I want to remember brother Amos this morning Preacher from Brother Steve propolis with Josiah is up in Pennsylvania preaching this morning Andrews down at brother Joe greens pray for our Minister and brothers that the Lord would just use them in a mighty way today unless their services amen how many have a request [Music] remember our pastors he comes to minister this morning that the Lord would just use him in a mighty way [Music] as well as being a lovely day of Mother's Day today is also another special day May the 14th this is Israel's 75th anniversary and of course you know Israel is our timepiece of course they actually celebrated it on the 28th which is a Hebrew calendar they didn't go by the Roman Calendar but Israel's always been a something that we've always like to look to because in the natural the natural types of spirit but spiritual but one thing I always thought was interesting I remember from several years ago Israel become a nation May the 14th 1948 recognized by the U.N but brother Ram says when he got his Commission in 1946 and said the very same hour that Israel became a nation is when he got his commission from the Lord but that was 1946 so you got a two-year discrepancy my brother Perry green did some research and I remember this from years of probably 40 years ago what happened was according to what his research said David bedgerion which was the first Prime Minister Israel actually made a declaration on that time of 1946 that Israel is a nation and he carried that little piece of paper around his pocket for two years and then in 1948 they was actually recognized by the United Nations so you know God's Prophet don't make those mistakes if God shows them something there's a reason for it like the bridge or anything else there's a reason for it we may not understand it but it's true it's right so the Bible does say pray for the Peace of Jerusalem that's that will be our future home one day so pay for it pray for Israel and this by our hands Lord Jesus how thankful we are to be back in the house of God lord we're thankful Lord because we have seen in the natural what you have how you have blessed Israel the desert has blossomed like a rose the blessings in the Homeland and Israel is back in her home run the bride is in her Homeland the message of the hour how thankful you are to be associated with this great end time message we're thankful to be a part of it under it Lord and in it we thank you Lord for the wonderful gifts that you've given the fivefold ministry I pray Lord for our brothers three of them out ministering this morning did you give them Grace understanding Revelation to speak to the people Lord God we we thank you for that also

service all that's done and said we pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we pray for that Homeland Lord after after they become a nation 1948 the next day the very next day the five Arab Nations declared

to just wish all you mothers Happy Mother's Day today and just pray that the Lord will just richly bless you and that you feel his presence near you today amen I we certainly salute every every one of you amen today in the if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Hebrews the I believe it's the fourth chapter or sixth chapter I should say but as it's been mentioned we want to pray for the there are ministers that are out ministering amen and brother Andrew asked me to greet you all and so uh visited with brother and sister Walker this morning and they both asked me to greet you all today and uh they're they're sure missing uh being here at church and uh they have moved uh brother Walker to uh Highland Ridge rehab center there in in Dublin and also Sister Walker is residing there and um uh brother Walker's room number is 103 and sister Walkers is 207 and so but she's able to uh go down the hall and uh see see him and so uh it's you know gonna take some time getting used to and so we want to just keep them in in prayer and I think from what it looks like he's in definitely in a better facility than he was there at the other place and and they weren't too kind and so uh but anyway we're we're glad that he's been in a in a better in another place there and we're just praying it's going to be a better place for him and um so just pray the Lord will just give him his strength and I courage I encourage you I I don't know how they've got it set up but uh if you can take some time to go visit them I know they would appreciate that and the only complaint they had today was the uh the food's just not the greatest you know and and I don't blame them and so uh if you uh you know you go and you want to take a little food with you to uh of course they don't eat a lot but maybe something that they could enjoy I know they would appreciate that uh much and so anyway we we certainly want to keep them in our prayer and we want to wish sister Hannah Abate right is it your birthday today that's what I heard amen well happy birthday amen and appreciate sister Hannah very much and she's been a a just a fine sister but we got to know her more and and certainly appreciate her loyalty to Christ and love for the the message of the hour and her she's just a great blessing there at uh during the meeting and so we we just wish her a happy birthday and may God's blessings be upon her amen and her family praise the Lord but before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we're here to worship you father to honor you there's so many gods in the in the day father that have been erected by man father and lord they're worshiping some football they're worshiping some sports star movie star many worship their job car whatever it would be father but all of that is Vanity all of that will disappear it's just full of corruption the Lord we here to worship the one true God The Incorruptible God that'll never change and that answers our prayers that watches over us that protects us Keeps Us preserves this father leads us and we're so thankful to Know You Lord in a personal way and to be acquainted with your ways and Lord as were your people here we humbly ask that you would just now speak to every one of us God speak to our hearts Lord may you feel at home here this morning in any any spirit that would try to Hinder the service we pray that you would just drive it away father and Lord may we just feel your presence and be edified and draw closer to you bless our ministers that are preaching Lord to your bride around other places father keep them anoint them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord and want to say it's good to have Dad and Mom here and able dad able to come this morning get some strength and and certainly appreciate their life and testimony amen that they have lived before us amen and good to have brother Enoch with this amen be missing you praise the Lord and he's accomplished uh the year of school I guess you're done with school for now for this year so uh anyway we appreciate him amen but Hebrews the sixth chapter and um praise the Lord I I want to read the 10th verse but it says for God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name in that you have ministered to the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them through faith and patience inherit uh of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen you can have your seats this morning amen good to have brother Joe Carter amen back amen we missed you brother Joel Wednesday amen and um uh now this this is a Mother's Day and uh and but but my title is actually just one word and that's Ministry and this may be a little unusual uh for a A Mother's Day um occasion but um yet when I think of ministry um I I or think of mother I think of ministry and uh but my my subject today is not only directed to you mothers but it's it'll be directed to all of us and and I pray that it will help us but I do want to say that uh all of you mothers are invaluable I wished I could express my heart and and in words to um just to express just how I feel and I believe God feels the same but you are invaluable you are you are priceless um proverbs 31 and 10 it talks about the virtuous woman and says who can find a virtuous woman and I I think that if there's any a time that that question is applied it would be applied to the age that we're living in who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies in other words she's Priceless there's there's there's no price that you could put on a virtuous woman um uh it's there and each of you mothers you you play a tremendous role within the home the family and you know I I know the the world is full of women now we're getting more uh we're the women don't aren't really mothers they don't want to take care of their children they they throwing them in the trash cans killing them getting rid of them whatever it's it's and that is becoming more common but but there are women who have children and I believe that they love their children uh but but they raised their children to be sports players they they raised their children to uh you know to be businessmen they they push them in in um in worldly things and and uh uh in in whatever they they can and if their children can become famous that success to them if they can if they can be on a a ball team that's success if they could be on um you know what whatever uh and if the child wants to be that then they push them but all their energy put all their money their time into supporting that child in into whatever and they take care of their children make sure that they're closed and have food and have things in life and and I I think that's a mother should um uh be that in in that way but that is yet that's still not really what God is is made a woman to be um even though she is to take care of her children she is the lover child she is to uh protect them and and things like that but I believe that today You christian mothers are fulfilling exactly God's purpose in in why he made mother in the first place and that is to raise your children in the in the way of the Lord uh to raise them um you know uh the for the Bible there in Proverbs 22 and 6 it says train up a child in the way he should go and and we now as Christians we know the way he should go and that is in the way of the Lord uh uh you know now now everybody's got their own opinions when it comes out in the world totally things you know if you'd asked just a woman off the street and in in which way her child should go well it's even becoming you know more that they should have the right to choose if if they want to be if if their boy wants to be a girl or if their girl wants to be a guy a boy you know and and and they support these things they they support all kinds of things but according to the Bible there there is one way that a a child should go and that's and and that's the way of the Lord and so therefore as as as as as parents uh we are obligated to to to raise our children in the the way of God uh Abraham Lincoln said that he was what he was he attributes his success or whatever uh to to uh him having a Godly mother who who taught him to pray and to know Jesus as his Savior and so the prophet said your family is what you are so that that's very important because your family reflects you and and so uh brother Branham says in another place you raise your family in a certain environment it's got a 98 percent better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way so then it it's it's that responsibility um whereas as a worldly woman even though she loves her children but she don't she don't look at at maybe consider the friends that they hang around don't consider the environment that they're around every day don't consider they don't consider what kind of literature they read they don't consider the movies they watch they don't consider uh uh maybe what is influencing outside the whole home and and even though they love their children but but yet they they they a lot of women don't have that knowledge and understanding that they there is a a protection there there has to be an environment for children to be in ain't that right now brother Brown said to teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school and and so uh that that's that's what mother it's it's a Ministry uh brother Brown said mother is the Fifth Gospel we've got the four gospels here in in the Bible Matthew Mark Luke John but mother is the Fifth Gospel that's what mother is so that's the kind of ministry that Mama has and and he says that you break motherhood then you've broken the back of the nation ain't that right so then mother is a Ministry that God has given to women for their children and and ever it may be so insignificant but uh uh yet or it it it seems It's not insignificant but yet it may seem the least uh uh my uh wife showed me a a saying says when you see a woman that says that that that that that says something and no one responds then then her name is mon uh because that's just about the way it is you know uh she can holler and and hardly no one answers her but uh uh mom goes through so much uh every day she's got a 24-hour uh job and um I I certainly salute uh uh you mothers uh but we not only look at motherhood as being a Ministry uh you know and and a role to play but uh uh you know so the it it it it it it it I want to look at it as that we all we we all have a Ministry to play in no matter what role it is and I I think it's very important that we understand that uh uh because the role that has been given to us it's been given to us by God and so therefore we will be held accountable to God alone for the role that we play whether we do good whether we don't whether we abandon it or whether we whatever we will answer to God for God is the one that gave us the role now what what the problem is today is there is so much discontentment uh in in the world today and people the majority of people are becoming discontent with the role that God has given them to play everyone seems to want to take and I say everyone the majority of of people today seem to want to take the other person's role and someone else's place well brother Branham tells us that in God's economy you can't take another man's place and and another person can't take your place that's how special you are ain't that rhyme when we want to take another person's place then what happens is we lose the value of God's choosing we we lose the value of his choosing and purpose for our lives when we do that God didn't call us to be discontent God called us to be content in the role that we are to play and and to accept it it's it's the devil that tries to that gets us discontent you know that it it's not God it's not the holy spirit it's it's it's it's the devil that that gets us this way and so we we when when we tried to take someone else's place then we lose our value everybody say our value in God's Kingdom because you'll never be successful taking somebody else's place as long as you try to take take the other man's place you you'll never be successful uh you'll only be blessed or have success in God when you fulfill the role that God has called you to fulfill ain't that right and so therefore uh uh uh people to be discontent and unsatisfied they're always wanting to be something different than what God called them to be now the reason for this now brother Brandon would tell us this and and he says the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontentment in the church is not because that Jesus isn't there but it's because that Jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go ain't that right so that's what causes discontent when God can't have preeminence in him in a person's life then it becomes it causes discontentment within that individual because they're getting burnt out when they're trying to do something outside of what God has called them to be it doesn't matter what it is no matter how much talented they are how energetic they are and how much ability they have and and whatever it's just like again you know brother Brown talks about the businessman and yes in their place they can make a business go they can make it successful that God never called them to be behind a Pulpit God never called them to try to run a church they will fail every time it's because it's not the role that they are to play ain't that right so we see a lot of families failing we see churches failing we see people failing we see marriage is failing and and the number one I believe is discontentment is and and again is because we're switching rows everybody doesn't wants to take the other person's Place everybody wants to tell the other person how to do their job and how this and how that but see God wants us to be settled do you believe that God wants his church to be settled and this word settled is to become fixed resolved or established I I think uh you know uh in the Bible you know after Solomon had built the temple for the Lord I believe he expressed God's desire uh uh you know you you go there and and the Bible talks about after the he had he had he had sacrificed and made all these sacrifices and had everything in order then the glory of God came down and and filled the temple even so much that the priest could not Minister and and and these things and and he had built the Tabernacle for the presence of God right and so the First Kings 8 and 12 it says then then after the the the the the the presence of God come in the Tabernacle there then spake Solomon and said uh the Lord said that he would dwell in the thick Darkness I have surely built thee and house to dwell in a saddled place place for thee to abide in Forever ain't that right well we understand that that Temple really wasn't a settled place for that place is now gone it it it was destroyed it it it is no longer in existence and and and and and then we find that God didn't his yes it it was a type of a temple that was to come ain't that right but but if we follow that amen that that the Bible says that we are the Temple of the Holy Spirit do you believe that we are that Dwelling Place of Jesus Christ and and so therefore uh uh uh what what Solomon was saying I have built thee a place for for a a a a a a saddled place for thee to abide in forever I honestly believe that was he was speaking God's desire to look for a settled Place ain't that right not a place going to and fro not a place just just running it but a saddled place and I think that is the body of Christ today is is that we to become settled saddle rooted a man you know uh uh uh Paul the Apostle Paul teaches us to continue in the faith and to be grounded and and settled ain't that right so so then each of us are important in God's plan for we make up the body of Christ and the body is is the Temple of the Holy Ghost right so each of us have a lick of fire each of us are and we are fitly framed joined together in this body separate members but as as a whole we make up the temple of Jesus Christ amen and and so uh uh uh then then each of us as as being a part of the body of Christ Christ the bride of Christ then we are part of God's plan we are we are part of his economy or he would not have chose us ain't that right now how many is glad he chose you aren't you glad he chose you well then then you know if if he chose us then he had a greater he had a deeper meaning a deeper cause to choose you than just coming to an altar and making you a a message believer a church goer a you understand what I'm saying he's got a place for you he he's got a specific thing for you to do a specific role for you to do ain't that right so when we say I'm glad that God chose me then then what we're saying that has a deeper meaning because then we're accepting his choosing we're accepting that role that he has chosen for us ain't that right we are accepting the ministry that he has called us to too and nobody can take your place ain't that right I don't care how insignificant you feel you are no one can take your place that's how important it is a man to understand this and to be faithful in the call that God has chosen you to to to to to fulfill so now it's the wisdom of God that ordained you to where you belong it's it's the wisdom of God uh God doesn't do things I have hardly he doesn't do things without thought but it was all by pre-thought it was all by wisdom ain't that right it's just like God didn't just create the heavens and earth we we read that in the beginning God created the heavens and earth but if you'll keep on reading you find out how he created them heavens and earth he created it by his word but before it was a word it was a thought ain't that right and we find out as you read along in the Bible a man that this God that did create in heavens and earth easy all wise God ain't that right so then we understand see the Bible tells us that by wisdom everybody say by wisdom he made the heavens by wisdom he made the heavens Proverbs 3 19 the Lord by wisdom hath founded the Earth by understanding hath he established the heavens so there was no confusion there wasn't just God saying let there be and then all of a sudden the mass confusion and all these things it was by understanding that he did it it was by wisdom that he did it everything belongs where they go everything he put every placed everything where they go and where they belong ain't that right so then we find Psalms 104 24 O Lord how manifold are thy Works in wisdom everybody's saying wisdom thou Hast made them all ain't that right so then it gives us a deeper understanding that when we read in the beginning God created heavens and earth we say well why is that star there by wisdom God put it there why is the sun right there by wisdom God put it there why is it so million million miles away from the earth by wisdom God put it there ain't that right amen so it's in its place you we look at the Moon God set the moon in its place ain't that right by his wisdom it's not just hanging there floating free it's there in place by the wisdom of God Amen and yet in its place or by say in its place it controls the tide it affects the Earth ain't that right in a good way right see in its place amen the prophet said if it ever get out of order the whole Earth would be flooded with water so the moon in its place has a Ministry in its place ain't that right amen and and so there we look at the star God said every Star in his place the Bible says he counts them all a man and he has named them all a man see so he has done this and yet if one of them were to get out of line out of its place do you realize it would affect us it would affect the Earth it would see brother Brown said if there's a moving anywhere of them for it's for a cause and will affect this Earth and then he calls it God's Great Army ain't that right see God created the heavens and earth by his wisdom and by that he made an army and every one of them in its place whether it's the brighter star the smaller star amen stars that we can't even see with our naked eye they're in its place ain't that right and it's God's Great Army and what God done by his wisdom is what did he do he made his first Bible by the solar system ain't that right he made his first Bible men lived off that and got Revelation amen from from the Stars Enoch was was one that got the Revelation by the Stars then we find that it was it in there it in the stars that tells of the Virgin birth and it tells of the second coming of of Messiah and and all of these things then we find out god's second Bible is the Great Pyramid and then his third Bible is this written word and it's all in its place do you believe that that's why we're not to take anything add to it or take away from it it's by the wisdom of God we don't need another book of Maccabees we don't need a another book of this we don't need just Joseph Smith's book we don't need this we don't need that amen everything is placed by the wisdom of God if we needed to know more it God would have put it in the book ain't that right but then we find that what God is doing today God has a people on earth a man who has become the book do you believe that they become the word that's right and you know how they're doing it by the wisdom of God God is strategically placing a group of people in their place now second Corinthians 3 and 2 you are are written our epistle written in our hearts read and own of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us not and man having to look at the stars not man happen to go to the to to Egypt to see the Great Pyramid not man even having to look at this come on Church Amen brother Brown said there's people that won't even read their Bibles but they'll see the Bible through you you are the Bible can you say man in your place that's right see so but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and brother random says what did he say the word is in the bride ain't that right and the mind of Christ the wisdom of Christ the revelation of Christ is in the bride to know what he once done with the word ain't that right now now what well the beauty of it the beauty of it in my opinion is is that that the Stars don't have a mind of Their Own they just hung there by the word of God the the pyramid it has not a mind of its own it's there it's been there for years and years thousands of years it's there right and and then you find the word of God here and and and uh uh it it don't have a mind of its own in in that way it man has tried to burn it and all that but it still Remains the Same it's tried to destroy it but it can't destroy it but then God is able to take people that have a mind of their own that have a self-will that that that that that that is in a a flesh of humanity that that is walking in this this this this this Valley of the shadow of death that having all these mind battles and having all these Temptations and and and and and have you you a man and and woman boy and girl that that is is automatically by birth by Nature pulled to the world ain't that right and yet he's able to take a group of the them people not having to change their bodies not having to take them out of the world but he places in them in the world a man with a full of Temptations and and and and and and trials and and all of these things and he's able to place them in his word to where they're settled and unmovable in a world of shifting sand amen that shows that God has been able to have preeminence he's able to show his mighty power through Humanity by giving them a self-will and yet placing them in the word to where their unmovable settled but when one brother random he says if that great Heavenly Host the the universe Stars Sun Moon he says they have to keep their place in order to make everything run in order what about the disorder of the Earthly host if if if they the Stars Sun Moon if they get out of their place how it affects the Earth what about the Earthly host when one he says gets out of order it throws the whole thing out of cater it's kind of like the gifts that God placed in the church when a gift gets out of its place what happens it causes confusion we believe in speaking in tongues but it's got to be kept in its place we believe in Divine Healing but you got to put it in its place ain't that right all the nine spiritual gifts that God put in the church they must be kept in their place we believe in shouting but it has its place can you say Amen we we believe in these things but but there is an order to it there we we there is a place I'm quoting Prophet now he said they have to be put in its place ain't that right yes sir see so now we we find that that and and God puts it in its place God gave it to the church but now it's in this age that the church has the wisdom and has the knowledge of his mind and Revelation to know what is to be done with it all right right yes that's right Psalms 127 and 1 it says accept the Lord build the house everybody say accept the Lord build the house why do we need the Lord to build the house because he's the one he's the all-wise god he does it with wisdom he establishes it by understanding except the Lord build the house they that labor labor in vain that build it ain't that right so we've had denominations tried to build it can't it's falling apart we we've the foolish man right the Bible talks about the wise man and the foolish man right and and so the Seminary can't build it it's falling apart amen people have school since and and and and and politics everybody has tried to build a an invincible army they have tried to build a a place that that can be a power and and a super you know we we become a super Nation by our by our uh technology and by this and by that and our weaponry and our our wisdom and our might and our knowledge and all of these things but it's never been able to produce an invincible Army but when God builds the church he knows how to do it ain't that right so now we're we're not building a man where we're not building a man by by the instructions of a seminary we're not building by the instructions of some psychology we're not building our family we're not Building a Church we're not building our lives amen uh by the instructions of theology we're building it by the Lord wisdom notice it takes the Lord to build it because Proverbs 24 3 says through wisdom everybody say through wisdom through wisdom is a house build it and by understanding it is established so therefore only God has the wisdom and understanding as to how the house should be built and be established in in you can use that word house for a lot of things but but I looked it up and and the word house means family and we are God's family do you believe that we are God's family uh Ephesians 2 19 You Are No More Strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and everybody say and of the household of God of the family of God do you believe you're part of the family of God Amen a family of God and are built everybody say I am built see your bill you're not just thrown in there now he's going to build you brother shalom to be part of this family you're part of the family by birth but now you're going to be built God's going to place you where you need to be right you don't put the shingles on the root of the roof on the floor everybody's got its place when this is it when it's in its place it becomes a sanctuary right and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all everybody say all in whom all the building you you you you you all the building fitly framed together grow with unto and holy Temple in the Lord in whom you are building together why for an habitation of God through the spirit so we see what God's desire has been now Satan has always been one to disrupt God's program started started it in the in in in Genesis and he has continued on throughout time and he has done this by sowing seeds of Discord and the word Discord is lack of agreement or Harmony ain't that right discontent and another place brother Brown said he wanted fair in in Genesis because Eve was looking for new light she was already discontent she wasn't just satisfied with her role she wasn't just satisfied to what God Said for her ain't that Ryan and so Abe now three it was through deception of course that that Satan was able to to Cole's Discord in the home he broke up the harmony that existed between Adam and Eve did it through deception and he was able you know uh uh to to break up that Harmony not only between the relationship of Adam and Eve but between them and God Harmony was broken because seeds of Discord ain't that right now God was able to bring this harmony between him and man again by Christ you believe it that's right and and and and when Christ was on Earth you saw Harmony again the harmony that Adam had I think it was even a greater Harmony because God was in Christ and Jesus said he that has seen me has seen the father ain't that right and Jesus didn't pray that God would make us one as he and Adam was one but he said make them one as you and I are one a Oneness that is even stronger now brother Brown said speaking of this harmony notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until Cena the father or the father showed him first see it was a Harmony between God and Christ and Satan could not disrupt that Harmony did he try it yes try deception try Temptation try to misconstrue the scriptures try to get him out of his place ain't that right try to get him to fulfill scripture that did not pertain for that hour sure did see but Jesus being the word oh my him being the word would not move off that word he knew what the word was for him therefore he would not be tempted by it he could not be deceived from it he stayed right in his place now that because of that God was able to reconcile you and I man back to himself and when God first established his church on the day of Pentecost it was the beginning of another Masterpiece and your brother Brown talks about it in the bright tree right and and so we we find that first church was in perfect harmony with God that's what the prophet said perfect harmony with God they were full of the Holy Ghost he said they walked on water they'd done great Miracles and so forth A man was so charged talking to Paul was so charged with the Holy Ghost a man that when that deadly serpent a man bit him that deadly uh uh poison could not hurt Paul could not harming why they were in harmony he was in his place right in his place you know where Paul was headed Jerusalem I think it was Jerusalem to answer the questions to be to be beheaded but yet he knew it was the will of God where he says I go Bound in the spirit it just shows that if a man is in his place a person is in their place God is obligated to them now Satan had he he disrupted that Harmony As We Know he showed up as the Antichrist began to work Paul warned them that the spirit now worketh ain't that right I think it was Peter that talked Brethren coming in unawares they were there the people called them brethren but Paul being a a messenger and these men being full of the Holy Ghost they they knew that these these men that were called brethren were there for the sole purpose to disrupt that Harmony and they brought in nicolaitanism and such you understand what I'm saying brother Brown says the whole program of God is upset when one member gets out of order we should continually to strive to keep the order of the spirit ain't that right so as they as as this happened we understand that when the harmony was broke against God's word then then Satan was able to come and strip the Church of the bark of this doctrine of its Fellowship of its life its stripped the Church of its Joy stripped the Church of everything but God promised he would restore he promised to restore you believe that and he'd have to restore that Harmony between him and and man again now notice brother Brown said Christ has now taken himself a bride to be pregnated with his own seed word in her womb Spirit womb in her mind and won't mix with any of the denominational trash with it she is a virgin to him now I believe that's who I'm speaking to this morning is a people that is a virgin to Christ this end time message one of the the main purposes of it that God has sent to us it's a Joshua Ministry ain't that right and and Joshua positionally placed the people where God had ordained them to be and by this message of the hour God is placing his people exactly where he ordained them to be the role that they ordered he ordained them to play the place that he ordained them to be in you say Amen he's placing each member and so the the harmony that was between God and Christ is now and I say now existing between God and his people you say well I'm looking for it I'm looking for harmony that Harmony is here I I just believe it you may not see it a lot of it but it's here if the world is coming in harmony with the prophecy spoken of their of their if America is coming in line with the every prophecy that the Bible spoke of if Russia is coming in line a man with the prophecies that God spoke of her then this bride is coming in line with the prophecy spoke of her you can't tell me that a heathen ungodly communistic Nation can come in line more quicker than a Spirit-filled bride under the message of the hour now this harmony brother Robin said Jesus never did anything until the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ so will the bride everybody say so will the bride and he shows her his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again he said amen then I got a great big Hallelujah here is the secret what is the secret the word is in the bride what's the secret to this harmony the word is in the bride what's the secret to all of this the word is in the bride what's making her settled the secret is the where is in the bride right right she has received it she's believed it she's received it the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he once done with the word and everybody say and she does it in his name for she has the saith the Lord they only they do only his will he said he may not believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill so then for this kind of Harmony to exist between God and man there has to be a new birth that the people receive ain't that right it's the work of the new birth to bring us brother Brown said to bring to us the Redemption power of his resurrection taken away all Shadows of doubt and unbelief and destroying all skepticism that the church might move on in perfect perfect harmony with the will of God as presented by the Bible in the Holy Spirit now how many believes he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence I believe he has and and Ephesians 1 8 which is I believe applied applicable to us he hath abound it toward us in all wisdom and Prudence when Revelations 10 1 the mighty angel coming having made known unto us the mystery of his will ain't that right according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him again believe it or not there are people on this Earth that have come into harmony with God Walking In Harmony in their plates the mystery of his will has been made known to them they are walking in compliance to his will they are here to carry out his will and his will alone ain't that right when their will struggles against his will they do exactly the way Jesus did it not my father not my will but thine will be done and every one of us has our Garden of Gethsemane every one of us has to come to that time where we say father knock my will but thine be done that's right why it's headship it's the word that has come to have preeminence and to place us exactly where he wants us to be then only then do we become successful in our Ministries and I want to say this the people that God has given you to influence they need you to stay in your place they need you could you imagine if the moon had a mind of its own and we heard it complaining he said I'm tired of hanging right here I I think I'm going to go on the north side maybe on the North side maybe this is the South Side I don't know and how many of us if if I know this is maybe two maybe too dramatic but and if we heard that Moon saying this how many of us be petitioning writing letters sending email whatever convincing that Moon stay in your place because it'll affect us if you don't but I'm so glad it ain't got a mind of its own right but here I'm talking to a people that's got a mind of Their Own submit your will to Christ's will stay in your place so there's people that is fulfilling the will they're not resisting nor are they in Rebellion to what God requires of them first Peter 4 1 for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with these same mind for he that has suffered In the Flesh has ceased from sin that he should he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God now I have said all this as as a foundation to get to to another thing and and I'll try to hurry that God is again called every one of us to Ministry you have a Ministry Ministry is the meaning of it is an agent or instrument a person or thing through which something is accomplished God could all done himself he could have chose the wind to preach the gospel but he chose man he chose he could have chose some other way than motherhood but he chose motherhood he chose he could have chose some other way than fatherhood but he chose fatherhood he chose he could have chose some other way than the fivefold ministry but he chose the five-fold ministry he ordained because he uses man you with me and Ministry involves service to another in other words it's serving when you serve another you are ministering this nation has ministers brother Matthew you're a minister as a firefighter you Minister Aid policemen ministers emergency workers their ministers why they are public servants to those who are in need that right we have the office of Senator Congressman president they are ministers to the American people because they are servants they are public servants to the American people ain't that right they're here to serve God has his own ministers we look at if if a nation has to have ministers and God will have his ministers in his kingdom is that right the man who preaches the gospel is commonly known as a minister brother Brown said the reason why I Minister studies and meditates in the scripture and seeks for inspiration is because he is a public servant to God's people so where is this call study meditate in the word right because he's a minister he's a public servant to God's people and he's trying to find something uh that will that God would have to say to his people something that will help them maybe it might can be condemn them in their sins but would be a help to raise them up that they might forsake their sins and then raise up to serve the Lord and ministers should seek these things then what what is it then the people that hear that minister undertake what that Minister says and practices it put it to practice in their life put it to practice in their home put it to practice Deuteronomy 4 and 1. says now therefore hearken o Israel unto the statues and judge the judgments which I teach you for to do them that they that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall you diminish ought from it that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you ain't that right now you might say well that was the prophet Moses he's the one that God gave him the word to so we follow that and that's true that that's very true well let's look we read in Exodus 18 12 is a little lengthy but we're going to read it anyways and Jethro Moses father-in-law took a burnt offering and sacrifice for God and Aaron came and all the elders deep bred with Moses father-in-law before God and it came to pass on the mara that Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by Moses from morning unto evening and when Moses father-in-law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why satis thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee for mourning unto even and Moses said unto his father-in-law because the people come unto me to inquire of God when they have a matter they come unto me and I judge between one and another and I do make them know the statutes of God and his laws and Moses father-in-law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good thou Wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee Thou Art not able to perform in thyself alone heart and now unto my voice I will give thee counsel and God shall be with thee be thou for the people the God's word that thou mayest bring the causes unto God and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shall show them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do moreover Thou shalt provide out of all the people Abel men such as fear God men of Truth hating covetness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of these rulers of tens and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so it shall be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee if Thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so then Thou shalt be able to endure and all these people shall also go to their place in peace so Morrow's Moses hearken to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said and Moses chose Abel man out of all Israel and made them heads over uh the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds of fifties of of tens and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto Moses but every small matter they judged themselves ain't that right so here the prophet said see Moses when he was tired his father-in-law said unto him you're wearing yourself out pray God to take your spirit and put it on others and he prayed he took the spirit God took the spirit and put it on Seventy others and 70 began to prophesy they didn't have any more power they had more machinery that's all they just had more Machinery that's the way it is today one man can't do it God's got his Machinery working everywhere but it's the same power same holy spirit it's the same Jesus ain't that right now we know that in the Bible the the Apostle Paul being the first church age Messenger to the Gentile he said this uh Ephesians 4 11 he gave he God gave some Apostles prophets Apostles some evangelists some pastors and teachers why for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of man unto a perfect unto the perfect measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftness whereby they lie in Wake to deceive so that's why God gives the ministry to the church ain't that right and we could go more and more but but I I do say this because Satan is doing his best to discredit God's Ministry take him out of the pulpit them all you need to do is play tapes there's not one time that the prophet said just play tapes and you say Amen amen God gave the church the fight for Ministry the prophet of this hour condoned it and he said I preached what Paul preached and Paul preached a five-fold Ministry and you say Amen but notice where the faithful Ministry and I I pray you're listening now but but notice where the fivefold ministry fits in coordination with the prophet we find that the second and third chapters of Revelations takes the entire time with God dealing with the the Gentile uh Church unto salvation and when God addresses each age he says the same exact thing in the opening and in the closing ain't that right he begins with unto the messenger of Ephesus then he begins unto the messenger of Sardis under the messenger of laodicea Unto the messenger of Philadelphia ain't that right and then he ends the message to each age by saying he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church ain't that right now notice what the prophet says he says here see Jesus by by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church do the true church he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the messages then brought Christ to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger those who hear uh those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is the group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God and Iran now Paul said this this this pattern uh under the hand of God for he alone had the full revelation of his day for his day and the you go read the Bible the other Apostles admitted that Paul had that revelation and they all supported Paul and and they would establish Paul's uh uh credentials and and and lift him up and I'm not saying magnifying the man you know what I'm saying but anybody that would come against the message that Paul preached they defended it and you say Amen now the prophet said in every age we have this same exact pattern he said that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger their spreads Delight through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught then he says but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken and we find that even in the message of the hour not every Minister you can trust that preaches the message there's others adding their own ideas their own theology they they ain't come out of Babylon all the way they ain't listening to the tapes they'll tell you that it's brother branham's opinion it'll tell you this they'll tell you that they tell you well he got this Revelation or he leaned this way because it was Baptist teaching or it was because of this no it was because he received a revelation from God ain't that right so then Satan uses these men to try to disrupt God's program like in the beginning but I tell you this their efforts are futile they'll never succeed and you say man why the word everybody say the word is already in the bride the word is already in you can you say man now notice what Paul would or brother Brown would tell us remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said First Corinthians 14 37 If any man thank himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what came the word out of God out from you or came it unto you only see they add here take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God but if you'll notice Satan cannot get to this Bride for this age remember he said remember we are now as his bride with the spirit how many is pregnated with the spirit oh my the church bearing children pregnated by his spirit with his name bear in his name bear in his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminances evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but He's Alive forevermore this is eternal life and Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him he said how do you know because you're because you're a church member no because Christ is living through you so pregnated with the spirit that you're a prisoner day anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you bring can bring forth is that right you can't bring forth foolish virgin and say they're children hello there's only one Ministry that a message preacher should have and that's for this elect that's right so brother Bram goes on and says you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated you believe it you're pregnant with the word of God you're already pregnated well some of you are are you pregnant with word of God see you're already pregnant Satan cannot take a hold the womb of life is close to everything else you're already his by predestination that seed has to come to life no world can get in it oh I would like to stay on that for an hour he says I'm sure you understand Christ and he is alone already finished the seed was there the seed was already when was it put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the life-giving flow that seed laying there other seeds that would just come in wouldn't take hold it just can't do it but when that seed word seed predestinated seed came in quickly it stopped up the womb and all the rest of the seed was drove out like that now we're living in a in an age that Jesus called wicked and adulterous right not only in the natural but also in the spiritual but brother Brown said you can't do it you can't you can't commit adult the seed is already there your wounds already closed up you already pregnated with the word of God is that right so the bride cannot be deceived so therefore we see the position of the fivefold ministry the genuine Ministry brother brand or Hebrews 13 13 says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they must give in an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you is that right brother Ram said it's the word that rules us not men the word another place he says amen as a a man as a husband is the head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word Jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress now you name me one church that hasn't given up the word for traditions and creeds so here we are a virtuous woman priceless rare and you say man now notice not only does the the preacher have a Ministry but now it's to be carried down to the parents Deuteronomy 6 6 and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart I want to I want to say this do you you need to take every service seriously take every message that you listen to on tape seriously because it's got to be put in your heart that was the order that the word be put in your heart things that have been commanded and things that have been taught put it in your heart see it ain't gonna be the preacher responsible it'll be you responsible for rejecting these things well I don't need to go to church I'll go do something else and it could be that God wanted you to be there to hear something but you put it off for whatever and you you'll you'll be responsible for that you know that because see that's the only way your ministry works now if you want to just be a worldly parent and just go be a worldly parent it'd be better for you to just be a worldly parent than to come in here playing with God and teaching your children that just to be half half lukewarm because we know what well be lukewarm because the prophet you know what Jesus gives for this age is because Thou Art neither hot nor cold I'll spew you out of my mouth so to to play with God and to come to be the judge of the preacher instead of the word judging you too many people come to church to judge the preacher and they take what they want they take what they and and leave what they don't want and it don't matter to me it don't matter to even to the prophet it didn't matter we'd preach it anyways and then you're responsible for it right so so then the address to the parents is these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt you're obligated now shall teach them diligently everybody say diligently diligently unto thy children and thou shall talk of them when thou sit us in thine house and when thou walk is by the way and when thou lie is down and when thou Rises up I hope we understand the ministry so parents are ministers in that they Echo this message to their children outside of that everybody say outside of that outside of that is chaos and disorder Satan disrupts the program of God will bring in movies where man and wife or man or woman is kissing and the prophet tells us that it's it's it's the sex it's it's actually committing adultery when a man and a woman outside of marriage kisses so see there's things that's got to be in our heart we have to put it in our heart before before our ministry is effective right we get it to the place that will you you ain't gonna tell me what to do well I'm not I'll tell you what God tells you to do then that's up to you what you want to do with it but but here's the thing we're not playing Church no more God sent a message I mean what what what we see that that that pillar fire but that Cloud's coming that's the judge he's having preeminence he's setting it all straight in his law amen and you say man so now every one of us who is part of the body of Christ Our ministers if you take and look at your mother's you'll find out what a real minister is as she's in her role now notice I hope this is okay I'll try to hurry God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God see Satan was able to disrupt the program then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became living Epistles and read and known of all men for their generation when the methodists failed God raised up others and so has it gone on through the years until in this last day there is again again that's us another people in the land who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the Prophet The Bride for the voice of God will be in her well he's not he's not saying that every one of us are going to be preachers in behind the pulpit be saying that we all will be the voice of God to end the role that we are playing that he's ordained us because notice how we need in Jeffersonville Blacksburg Christiansburg the world thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's the Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how loud you can jump and how much you can do this or shout what hurts but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil so we understand that that it's more than just just just a a a preaching behind a Pulpit the ministers called for that the preachers called for that but every one of us is just as important hope I get that clear to you Romans 14 7 for none of us live to himself or no man dieth to himself so then every member of us every one of us members of the Bride has an influence you believe it outside of your role your influence will destroy your influence will break a church apart will break a marriage apart we'll break a home apart people's use their influence instead of bringing together they brought in to destroy people's lives but in your role you have an influence by God by his wisdom has given each of us a road to play you mothers have a role you fathers have a role every one of you husbands you have a role in your home you are to be the head of your home you believe that you are to give honor to your wife as Paul would say for she's the weaker vessel or as she is the weaker vessel ain't that right in other words respect her in the role that she is in her role in the family respect her as the weaker vessel and lead your family don't give that responsible to her that's not her role you know the prophet said about Abraham and said Abraham couldn't tell Sarah everything that God told him quiet but it's true I know that's totally contradictory to the age we live in but brother Ram said God couldn't do that Abraham couldn't tell Sarah everything because she was the weaker vessel she was weak in faith so he had to act he had to be the leader he had to show he had to be strong the Bible says he was strong in faith and say she was strong in faith now she had faith and she's named in the book of Faith the Hall of Fame but the prophet said she was weak in faith and so he says see Sarah never was too strong anyhow in faith because she lacked she disbelieved the promise but Abraham held her because the man and woman are one it was the woman that was deceived not man ain't that right down Through the Ages Satan has always worked through woman he's been able to find a woman and work through her and that's not to just degrade anything but I will say he's sure using women today woman has become the god of the age worshiped they can her role in leading the home trying to lead our nation leading churches got deaconesses right and so then if we can understand that then it shows that every one of us brethren we have a Ministry to our home don't let her Lead You by the nose don't let her you know like brother Brandon said yeah you're the head but she turns your head she's The Knack don't let her do that see you got to stay in the role now if you sisters understand the role you'll appreciate it brother Brown says that we're not to use our wives as a doormat right she's not your slave but yet at the same time you wives have a role really random says as you serve your husband you serve the Lord is that right you have something that God gave you to help your husband to help your man said you you know where he said it he said man could come home after a long day fighting you know Spirits or whatever he's tired and he comes home and says sets there or even one place says his wife greets him hugs and gives him a kiss sets him down sits on his lap begins to rub her fingers through his head hair is that it charges him something about the connection something that a woman a rule the woman has but the roles are being switched today women are ruling the house men are scared to death to stand up to them and to take a stand mainly because they just don't want trouble maybe he's afraid she'll leave if we find brother Brian set a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world and speaking of the church and speaking of the natural but we can find our place if we can find our role whether it be you deacons whether it be trustees whether it be whatever you're called to minister whether it be to the employee employer whatever see you you affect your family you affect your children you have that influence you affect your husband your wife Matthew 5 13 says you are the soul of the earth if the salt has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted it is then's forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden underfoot of men you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid so then we know what Jesus is doing don't you he's setting us forth as an influence you don't just stay in the world without influence your influence will be effective for good or for bad can you say Amen you love the Lord you may not be called to influence the whole world but strive to be that influence to the people that God gives you to influence and that number one is your family if the musicians will come you say well my my children growed up they're out of the house they're serving the devil they're but I'm going to tell you this stay in your place stay in your place that's the only way it's the only way you have power remember brother Brown said if you have faith you mothers if you have faith enough for yourself and have faith for that wayward child no matter how Wayward they are no matter how waver they are stay in your place stay in your place your children need you to stay in your place stay faithful to God stay faithful to the house of God stay faithful to his word stay faithful to the message clean out your homes then you say Amen I hope this has been okay all I know is Satan's doing everything he can to disrupt the program of God and his Target is on you you if I could say it this way we're the last man standing we're the last stage we're we're the last don't falter in it don't don't give up stay on the firing line stay with God and I and I and I I want to even say to you husbands fathers [Music] don't don't just leave your wife and and I'm just going to say it for myself okay [Music] don't just leave your wife at home all the time and you're out just running around doing all your thing and she's right there with the children all the time [Music] you got to understand something Satan fights that little lady fights her just as much in her mind you need to be there for that woman you need to be there for that child [Music] you need to have an influence in that home you can be a man of prayer a man that reads the Bible a man that listens these messages you need to be a man of conviction [Music] be a man that can bring your family together and protect them be involved in their lives [Music] she's not just one that cleans your house and watches your children while you get to go have fun and I'm saying that because that poor old woman [Music] I read you that quote Wednesday night that you sisters with long hair and wanted everybody else brother Brown said he said Satan's you're a target for the devil I I and can I say it really Brown tells us me and how to choose our wives he said if you want you know if you want just uh just the old whatever woman I can't even remember the name he called her but just I'll say it a No Good Woman it just runs around and in the bars and dressing sexy and all of that nonsense sad to say that tries to creep in this message any guy that wants that needs to get saved you get attracted by it these tight skirts tight blouses and all that something wrong [Music] brother Brown said you shouldn't want that you want a woman that'll build your house take care of your children be faithful to you what you establishing at home she's gonna carry out you ain't gonna want a woman now when you go off to work that woman says I don't matter what Dad says you can wear that makeup it doesn't matter what daddy says you can watch that movie you ain't gonna hurt he just don't know no better you ain't gonna want a woman like that so you choose a woman with character and a woman chooses a man with character [Music] it's all right for a man to work it's all right for a man to provide for his family but that's all he lives for something wrong he ain't got spiritual things in his life to drive his family to God I'd rather bless the Paul as brother Brown said rather live under a bridge and eat soda drink Branch water and soda crackers what is money if you ain't got God [Music] so you want a man that'll that'll that'll that'll lead you into God's ways but you Brethren if you've got a woman that'll be faithful to you and teach your children [Music] ought to respect her [Music] you ought to cherish her knowing that Satan's going to do everything he can to break her up she's the weaker vessel then you say man you ain't that's brethren we ain't got time to listen to the garbage don't put your family into it either don't bring things in your home that's going to discourage don't bring things for your children watch what voices they're listening to you've got a Ministry we've all got a Ministry you got to be faithful to it [Music] and you say Amen [Music] you know I guess it's the first time my mom's been here for mother's day but I say it often but I really appreciate my mom I'm not a Godly woman [Music] told her the other days the more I live the more I love her the more she shines to me she was a woman that she's a woman that wasn't raised in the era of phones foreign first thing they get up there on their phones constantly on their phones looking at this looking at that looking at everything else but I remember many many many many if not every day many mornings same mom in her Bible [Music] say Mom pray every time she comes up to our house wake up in the morning there she is in the sun room got her Bible not on a phone got her Bible she praying I remember the times you know when I lost my wife first wife and [Music] just going through so much [Music] moments I'm praying for you Sean talking about means so much for a mom because I knew that woman meant it if she's praying she she tell me she praying she praying you just ain't words I'm almost 50. and yet my mom has such an impact on my life even to this day and I want to say it with you mothers you may be gray-haired you may even got grandchildren that your children still need you I thought of brother Branham saying that Mom was the old piepost to our family you hear they were all growned up got all their children she said we don't know what we're going to do now because Mom was the mom was the time post for a song God bless you mothers God bless your faithfulness [Music] give your mom a hug let her know you love her [Music] thank you so much for just being true to God to the message amen let's stand to our feet what's all over every situation give me the word I don't want it watered down sugar coated or profound give me basic truths and last
