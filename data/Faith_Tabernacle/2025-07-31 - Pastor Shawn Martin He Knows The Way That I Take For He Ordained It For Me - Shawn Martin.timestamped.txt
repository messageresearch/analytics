[39:41] welcome, be free, Lord, to do whatever
[39:46] you would want to do. For we are a
[39:49] people that believe in the supernatural.
[39:52] We are a people that believe that all
[39:54] things are possible,
[39:57] Lord, to them that believe and that
[39:59] there's nothing, Lord, that you cannot
[40:02] do. and you've given us a a Bible full
[40:07] of promises that would cause our hearts
[40:10] to come under expectation.
[40:13] Even so, Lord, do it, Lord. And I pray
[40:17] that you would anoint both speaker and
[40:19] hearer. Help me to get myself out of the
[40:22] way. And may you speak through me, Lord,
[40:24] to your people. We ask it in Jesus
[40:28] Christ's name. Amen. And amen.
[40:32] I uh have forgotten my glasses today and
[40:35] my eyes kind of hurting. So I've asked
[40:38] Daniel to read for us. Um so we're going
[40:42] to read Job 1
[40:45] uh through 6 and then Job chapter 2
[40:50] um or Job uh chapter 1 6-12
[40:55] and Job 2 1-6.
[40:58] Amen. Now there was a day when the sons
[41:01] of God came to present themselves before
[41:04] the Lord, and Satan came along uh came
[41:08] also among them. And the Lord said unto
[41:11] Satan, "Which comest thou?" Then Satan
[41:13] answered the Lord, and said, "From going
[41:15] to and fro in the earth, and from
[41:17] walking up and down in it?" And the Lord
[41:20] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[41:22] my servant Job, that there is none like
[41:25] him in the earth, a perfect and an
[41:27] upright man, one that fearth God, and uh
[41:31] it cheweth evil." Then Satan answered
[41:34] the Lord, and said, "Does Job fear God
[41:37] for for not? Hast thou not made a hedge
[41:40] about him, about his house, and about
[41:44] all that he hath on every side? Thou
[41:47] hast blessed the work of his hands, and
[41:49] his substance is increased in the land.
[41:52] But put forth thy hand now, and uh touch
[41:56] all that he hath um and he will curse
[41:59] thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto
[42:02] Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
[42:05] thine power, only upon himself put not
[42:08] forth thine hand. So Satan went forth
[42:11] from the presence of the Lord. Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Job chapter 2 and verse 1-6.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Again, there was a day when the sons of
[42:23] God came to present themselves before
[42:25] the Lord. And Satan came also among them
[42:29] to present himself before the Lord. And
[42:32] the Lord said unto Satan, "From whence
[42:34] thou with from whence comest thou?" And
[42:37] Satan answered the Lord and said, "From
[42:40] going to and fro in the earth, and from
[42:42] walking up and down in it." And the Lord
[42:44] said unto Satan, "Hast thou considered
[42:46] my servant Job, that there is none like
[42:49] him in the earth, a perfect and an
[42:50] upright man, one that fearth God, and
[42:52] cheweth evil?" And still he holdeth fast
[42:56] his integ uh integ
[42:59] in integ uh
[43:02] yes, I can say integrity.
[43:06] Yes. Amen. As a twist of my tongue.
[43:10] Although thou hast moved me against him
[43:12] to destroy him without cause. And Satan
[43:16] answered the Lord and said skin for
[43:18] skin. Yeah. All that a man will uh hath
[43:22] will he give for his life. And put forth
[43:25] thine hand now and touch his touch his
[43:27] bone and his flesh and he will curse
[43:29] thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto
[43:32] Satan, "Behold, he is in thine hand, but
[43:36] save his life."
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can um have your seats
[43:42] this evening.
[43:44] And if I were to uh use the title, it
[43:49] would be He knows the way that I take
[43:52] for he ordained it for me.
[43:56] Um
[43:57] what I have to say this evening uh is
[44:00] nothing new. Um but I I do pray it'll
[44:04] encourage you. And u before I get
[44:09] started, I um
[44:13] uh uh want to say that that God has a
[44:17] way. How many believes that?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; God has a way. And um
[44:25] just if you look through the Bible,
[44:27] you'll you'll see that it's the way of
[44:29] truth. So there's no perversion in it.
[44:33] No lie.
[44:35] It's a way that is perfect. For the
[44:37] Bible says, "As for God, his way is
[44:39] perfect."
[44:41] It's the way of God. It's the way of
[44:44] righteousness.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible also tells us that this way is
[44:49] the way of life.
[44:51] And there is no death in it.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; There's no destruction in it. There's
[44:59] no
[45:01] um
[45:02] uh defeat in it.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; It's it's a way of life.
[45:08] And brother Brandham in praying for a
[45:11] woman who was having a nervous breakdown
[45:15] said, "Father,
[45:17] here a salvation woman stands here this
[45:21] afternoon.
[45:22] Oh, I pray that you'll heal her and make
[45:25] her strong."
[45:27] She's nervous and breaking down.
[45:31] After a while, Satan will have her
[45:33] sitting in a padded cell if he had his
[45:36] way.
[45:38] But your way is different.
[45:42] Your way is the way of health. May she
[45:46] walk in that path from now on in the
[45:49] path of health.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; What a path.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; What a way. A way of health. A way of
[45:57] victory. A way of triumph.
[46:00] a way that
[46:04] uh Satan's
[46:06] effect
[46:08] uh loses its power. Satan has no power
[46:11] in this way.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And so I I can't help but believe that
[46:16] Job was walking in this way of God. He
[46:21] knoweth the way I take.
[46:24] Now it it would seem that the the trial
[46:28] that Job was going through
[46:31] uh would destroy him
[46:34] &gt;&gt; and that is certainly the intention of
[46:36] the devil.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; But yet Job had this consolation
[46:42] that he would come forth.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he knew the way he had taken
[46:48] and God knew. Now you know when we talk
[46:52] about tri the trials that we go through,
[46:54] we we have to talk about Job. Uh because
[46:59] um Job um
[47:02] is is the example for all of us
[47:05] believers. All every believer goes
[47:08] through trials and tribulations.
[47:10] There's not one of us that will be
[47:12] exempt from it.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:14] And uh uh and so uh we can relate to the
[47:18] pain, the suffering,
[47:21] the maybe the anxieties,
[47:24] the anguish that Job went through. And I
[47:28] I believe that God purposefully gave uh
[47:32] a detailed account of what happened
[47:37] before
[47:38] and during and after Job's trial
[47:44] &gt;&gt; and and God uh uh also gave us Job's
[47:50] attitude
[47:52] in the trial. Yeah.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; God wanted us to make sure that we knew
[47:57] that what Job was before the trial.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; After the or during the trial and after
[48:03] the trial,
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Romans 15:4, Paul would tell us that for
[48:08] whatsoever things were written before
[48:11] time were written for our learning.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; So God purposefully puts Job's story in
[48:18] scriptures for our learning.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we through patience and
[48:23] comfort of the scriptures might have
[48:26] hope. Ain't that right?
[48:28] &gt;&gt; We going to go through things, but we
[48:30] got scriptures
[48:32] &gt;&gt; that we can find comfort and have hope.
[48:36] Job didn't have scriptures that he could
[48:39] look to and say, "Oh, this one, you
[48:43] know, uh, made it and God brought took
[48:47] him through trials and he made it and
[48:50] all these things." But we do have
[48:53] scriptures that we can find comfort and
[48:55] hope. Can you say amen? Amen.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; So, one thing that uh we learn from
[49:01] Job's story is that God knows what we're
[49:05] going through. How many believes that
[49:07] &gt;&gt; God knows? And and and God wanted us to
[49:10] make sure uh that that uh we could read
[49:15] this that God knew what Job was going
[49:18] through. And this this is important to
[49:21] us because Satan uh does his best to try
[49:24] to convince us that God uh doesn't know
[49:27] where we're at. That uh God has forsaken
[49:30] us and and he isn't concerned. But we we
[49:35] find in the book of Psalms 37:18,
[49:39] it says, "The Lord knoweth the days of
[49:42] the upright."
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; He knows every day that you live.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh Psalms 16, the Lord knoweth the
[49:52] way of the righteous. Ain't that right?
[49:55] So he has a knowledge. He has a
[49:57] knowledge and understanding of the way
[50:00] of of the righteous. He comprehends the
[50:04] way of the righteous.
[50:07] And and we find again going back to Job
[50:11] is that the way of the righteous is not
[50:13] one uh that is a flower flower flowery
[50:18] bed of ease, but it's a way of hardship.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; How many believes that
[50:24] &gt;&gt; it it it's a way of suffering, a way of
[50:27] trials,
[50:29] uh uh a way of tribulation.
[50:32] 2 Timothy 3:12, it it says, "All that
[50:36] live godly or all that will live godly
[50:40] in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[50:43] persecution."
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Not some, but all.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um, uh, you know, Brother
[50:52] Brandon would say it this way. Sometimes
[50:55] we have more troubles when we become a
[50:58] Christian than we did when we were
[51:01] sinners.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Now think of that. Ain't that contrary
[51:03] to the way we think and the way uh uh
[51:06] the the Christianom wants to paint the
[51:09] the life of Christianity today?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; But but think of that. We we have
[51:15] sometime more trials as a Christian than
[51:18] we do uh uh a a as a sinner. Uh uh
[51:22] Psalms 34:19, "Many," everybody say,
[51:25] "Many, many are the afflictions of the
[51:29] righteous, but the Lord deliverth them."
[51:31] Say, "The Lord deliverth him
[51:34] &gt;&gt; out of them all." See, and so I I'm
[51:37] reminded of what Paul told the elect in
[51:40] in First Thessalonians
[51:43] uh 3 and2. He says, "We sent
[51:46] Timoththeus, our brother and minister of
[51:49] God and our fellow laborer in the gospel
[51:52] of Christ to establish you and to
[51:55] comfort you concerning your faith that
[51:59] no man should be moved by these
[52:02] afflictions."
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; No man should be moved by these
[52:07] afflictions, for yourselves know that we
[52:11] are appointed there unto. So Paul was
[52:15] not bemoning the afflictions. He was not
[52:18] saying, "Look, this has come to me as a
[52:20] surprise. I I really don't know what to
[52:22] do. I I don't know what's happening."
[52:25] But but yet Paul was telling them, I
[52:27] I've come we've sent someone to see that
[52:31] that that you're not moved by these
[52:32] afflictions.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; We we've told you that these things are
[52:36] to happen. Ain't that right?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; And and were appointed there unto. For
[52:42] verily, when we were with you, we told
[52:44] you before that we should suffer
[52:47] tribulation
[52:49] even as it came to pass. And you know,
[52:52] ain't that right?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; So, and and and to think now even us
[52:56] ministers, I I I want to read a
[52:59] scripture that um uh uh maybe comfort
[53:03] the ministry. Um, and I'm I'm not just
[53:06] talking about ministers, but I'm talking
[53:08] about anyone that's in ministry doing
[53:10] something for the Lord. Uh, because Paul
[53:14] would tell us that there's things that
[53:17] ministers
[53:19] uh have to endure. He said, "We then as
[53:23] workers together with him beseech you
[53:26] also that you receive not the grace of
[53:29] God in vain. For he saith, I have heard
[53:32] thee, in a time accepted, and in the day
[53:34] of salvation have I secured thee.
[53:36] Behold, now is the accepted time.
[53:38] Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[53:40] giving no offense in anything, that the
[53:43] ministry be not blamed, but in all
[53:47] things approving ourselves as the
[53:49] ministers of God, in much patience,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; in afflictions,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; in necessities,
[53:59] in distresses,
[54:01] in stripes,
[54:03] &gt;&gt; beaten, right? imprisonments, in other
[54:07] words, being uh uh thrown in jail, in
[54:10] tomb, tumults,
[54:13] uh uh turmoil, I guess, in laborers, in
[54:17] watchings, in fastings,
[54:20] by puress, by knowledge, by
[54:22] longsuffering,
[54:24] by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love
[54:27] unfeigned.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the word of truth, by the power
[54:31] of God, by the armor of righteousness on
[54:35] the right hand and on the left, by honor
[54:38] and dishonor, by evil report and good
[54:42] report, as deceivers and yet true. As
[54:46] unknown and yet well-known, as dying and
[54:49] behold, we live. As chastened and not
[54:52] killed, as sorrowful yet always
[54:55] rejoicing. as poor yet making many rich,
[54:59] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[55:02] things.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; What a ministry. What what a what a a
[55:08] time. I mean, what what what things we
[55:12] go through. So to to expect that, you
[55:16] know, as ministers, we we well, you
[55:18] know, we want every life to be good. We
[55:22] want everything. And and yet Paul is
[55:24] telling us that's not the way of
[55:25] ministry.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; There's always going to be afflictions.
[55:29] There's always going to be the ups and
[55:31] downs. There's always going to be the
[55:33] troubles. There's always going to be the
[55:35] testings and the challenges. Ain't that
[55:37] right?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we we all go through these things.
[55:41] You know, Brother Brandham says,
[55:42] "Sometimes I think we ministers make it
[55:44] a little too much flowers for the
[55:47] convert. Oh, come to Christ. Everything
[55:49] is lovely." But you see, it isn't like
[55:52] that. Everybody says it isn't like that.
[55:54] If you've lived uh uh uh for Christ just
[55:58] just barely uh uh a few days, you you
[56:02] know that that that it isn't like that.
[56:05] It's not a flowery bed of ease. Oh, come
[56:08] to Christ. See, he said it isn't that
[56:10] way. See, in the way that that saying
[56:13] that everything is a flowery bed of ease
[56:17] because he says, see, if you're not
[56:19] suffering persecutions for Christ's
[56:21] sake, then there is something wrong.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; If you're not going through things,
[56:27] there's something wrong. Can you say
[56:28] amen?
[56:29] &gt;&gt; I I'm not advocating that you go seek
[56:32] trouble. I'm not advocating that you go
[56:34] seek to be poor. God will bring it upon
[56:37] you. Uh can you say amen? I'm not saying
[56:40] that you pray for afflictions or seek
[56:43] afflictions and and all of these things.
[56:45] I'm just saying whatever God leads you
[56:49] or brings you to, just take it as no
[56:52] surprise.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the the prophet goes on,
[56:57] if the devil ain't after you, then he's
[56:59] got you.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; That's all. Because as long as he's
[57:03] after you, that's a sign he hasn't got
[57:06] you yet.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:09] See, but if he isn't a few, it's a sign
[57:12] that he's got you. Yeah. So, just
[57:14] remember, as long as he's blasting at
[57:17] you, you're a few jumps ahead of him.
[57:20] Yet, just keep on going.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; So, Job had this revelation that God
[57:28] knows the way that I take.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; I think that's a a a a comfort that we
[57:33] all should have in the trials. uh uh is
[57:37] is is he knows the way that I take.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Even David wrote in Psalms 139
[57:45] uh 1-3, "Oh Lord, thou hast searched me
[57:48] and known me. Thou knowest my
[57:51] downsitting, my uprisings. Thou
[57:53] understandest my thought a far off. Thou
[57:56] compasseth my past and my lying path and
[57:59] my lying down, and art acquainted with
[58:03] all my ways."
[58:05] Ain't that right? Amen. So, so there was
[58:08] nothing about David that was hid from
[58:12] God.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and the scriptures pertain
[58:15] to us that if God was acquainted with
[58:18] all of David's ways, he's acquainted
[58:20] with all of our ways.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us. He knows
[58:24] our ups and downs. He knows our valleys,
[58:26] our mountains. He knows every experience
[58:29] that we go through. He knows all the
[58:30] seasons that we go through. Amen. and
[58:33] and he's acquainted with all of these.
[58:35] Ain't that right?
[58:36] &gt;&gt; See, so now it it's the way of humanity
[58:40] uh uh to think that God only knows the
[58:43] good things that happen to us that that
[58:46] he's only concerned about the good
[58:48] things and he's only uh blessing us with
[58:51] good things and and anything else is
[58:54] just uh God's not in it at all. uh it's
[58:57] the devil and and uh uh but but that's
[59:01] that's not really true. And and and we
[59:04] readily in in this day see the good
[59:06] times uh as as uh times of blessings uh
[59:11] of God. Amen. and and uh but when we go
[59:15] through the suffering and experience
[59:16] loss and loneliness and and the
[59:19] hardships, we tend to believe that God
[59:21] is no longer interested and and somehow
[59:24] Satan is able to cut us off from the
[59:27] blessings of God and and that God may be
[59:30] over here and and there's a big gap and
[59:33] Satan's got us over here and God's
[59:36] trying to reach and trying to trying to
[59:39] get to us and we just don't know what
[59:42] we're going to do. Amen. Well, that's
[59:44] not that's not the case at all.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if you look in um uh
[59:49] Revelations 2:9, God speaks to the
[59:52] church saying, "I know thy works and
[59:56] tribulation and poverty." And we know,
[59:59] Brother Brown deals with this in the
[1:00:01] church age book. Amen. And he says,
[1:00:03] "Remember, he's walking in the midst of
[1:00:07] his people.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; He's present among them." Ain't that
[1:00:11] right? Amen. And and yet they are going
[1:00:14] through the worst time that the church
[1:00:16] has gone through up to that point. And
[1:00:19] and and and he's not standing there
[1:00:23] looking helpless as he watches them go
[1:00:27] through all of this trouble and
[1:00:29] tribulations and the poverty that
[1:00:31] they're going through. He's not saying,
[1:00:34] "I know there, but I I can't help you
[1:00:38] because I can't reach you." No. He's
[1:00:40] standing in the midst of the church. A
[1:00:43] ain't that right?
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; So So then he's he's not standing there
[1:00:47] helpless. Amen. For the prophet said
[1:00:50] he's the chief shepherd of the flock. A
[1:00:53] shepherd is a is a guide. A shepherd is
[1:00:57] protector. It's I I it's the uh uh uh uh
[1:01:02] provider of his flock, the deliverer of
[1:01:05] his flock. Ain't that right? as David
[1:01:08] which was a type of Christ when when the
[1:01:10] lion come after his flock. Amen. David
[1:01:14] anointed went and and and slew that lion
[1:01:17] and rescued that sheep and and and when
[1:01:20] the bear come to do the same thing.
[1:01:22] David under the anointing he ran after
[1:01:25] that bear and slew the bear. Ain't that
[1:01:27] right? So here is Christ as the chief
[1:01:31] shepherd
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; amongst his flock. And yet it just seems
[1:01:36] like Satan as the wolf is devouring the
[1:01:40] sheep, devouring the church, devouring
[1:01:43] the elect. And God is helpless to do
[1:01:46] anything about it.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; That's the picture we paint.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; But that's not the truth.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. He is the chief shepherd and
[1:01:56] there's nothing that the devil can do to
[1:01:59] us to destroy us.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So God simply tells them, I know you're
[1:02:06] suffering and your tribulation
[1:02:09] and he lets them know that he is not at
[1:02:12] all unmindful of what they are going
[1:02:15] through. He sees, he knows, he's aware
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; of the way that they've taken. Ain't
[1:02:22] that right? Now, brother Bram would say
[1:02:24] this is a stumbling block to so many
[1:02:27] people. He said it's just like Israel,
[1:02:30] you know, they wondered if if God really
[1:02:32] loved them. How can God be just and
[1:02:36] loving if he stands by and watches his
[1:02:39] people suffer? And and this is exactly
[1:02:42] what they they asked there in Malachi 1
[1:02:45] uh and one the burden of the word of the
[1:02:47] Lord to Israel by Malachi, I have loved
[1:02:50] you, sayith the Lord. Yet you say,
[1:02:53] "Wherein hast thou loved us?" What was
[1:02:56] not Esau's Jacob brother? Sayeth the
[1:02:59] Lord. Yet I loved Jacob and I hated
[1:03:01] Esau. I laid his mountains and his
[1:03:04] heritage waste for the dragons of the
[1:03:07] wilderness. Ain't that right? So the
[1:03:09] prophet says, "See, Israel could not
[1:03:11] understand God's love. Neither can we
[1:03:14] understand God's love." A lot of times,
[1:03:17] especially when we're going through the
[1:03:18] trials, we we feel the love of God when
[1:03:21] everything is going great. We feel the
[1:03:23] love of God when when, you know, the the
[1:03:26] stock market is high and and we're
[1:03:28] making great bank, you know, in in our
[1:03:30] investments and and and the jobs are
[1:03:33] looking good and everything is just
[1:03:34] great. No troubles. Amen. But then we
[1:03:37] start questioning the love of God when
[1:03:40] we go through the sufferings.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:45] But you know uh uh people feel that
[1:03:49] somehow if if God truly loved them then
[1:03:51] they wouldn't have to go through
[1:03:53] sufferings
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; and and you know they think that God
[1:03:57] proves his love to them by caring for
[1:04:00] them the way a mother would her infant
[1:04:04] child.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But the prophet said God's love is
[1:04:08] elective love.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody say God's love
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; is elective love. Now notice the proof
[1:04:15] of his love is election.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh God, I just wish you had
[1:04:21] proved your love for me." He's proved it
[1:04:23] by electing you.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; He proved it by choosing you.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; He proved it by ordaining you. Can you
[1:04:30] say amen?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And and and so his the proof of his love
[1:04:34] is election. that no matter what
[1:04:37] happened, his love was proven truly by
[1:04:41] the fact they were chosen under
[1:04:44] salvation because God hath chosen you to
[1:04:47] salvation through the sanctification of
[1:04:49] the spirit and belief of the truth.
[1:04:52] Aren't you glad for election?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. We couldn't even come to God. We
[1:04:57] couldn't even desire God if there was
[1:05:00] not an election upon our lives. That God
[1:05:04] chose us. Therefore, it is proof that he
[1:05:08] loves us. So no matter what happens, no
[1:05:11] matter what we go through, we can ass be
[1:05:14] assured that God loves us.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. So the prophet said, "God
[1:05:23] may commit you to death as he did Paul."
[1:05:26] He may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:05:29] Job.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's his prerogative.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; For he is the one that is sovereign.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; So then therefore it it would behoove us
[1:05:40] and I I pray God just helps us more and
[1:05:42] more to know the God that we really
[1:05:44] serve.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; We believe he's How many believes he's
[1:05:47] God?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's almighty?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I believe he's almighty. I believe he's
[1:05:52] greater than anything. But I also
[1:05:54] believe he's sovereign.
[1:05:56] And if he's sovereign, he doesn't get
[1:05:58] have to get permission. Amen. From me,
[1:06:01] from you, from the pope. He doesn't have
[1:06:03] to get permiss permission from anybody.
[1:06:05] He didn't have to get permission to save
[1:06:07] you, to choose you, to ordain you. He
[1:06:11] didn't have to get permission to give
[1:06:12] you the promises. And he doesn't have to
[1:06:15] get permission in the way he deals with
[1:06:17] us.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible says he's an
[1:06:24] all- wise and all- knowing God. So he he
[1:06:28] is the one who works all things
[1:06:31] according to his purpose.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; The sovereign God is able to work all
[1:06:37] things according to his purpose.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; So what looks like it would be a
[1:06:41] detriment to you, what looks like it
[1:06:44] would be a a something that would
[1:06:46] destroy us, Amen. God uses these things
[1:06:51] to produce his plan.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; So he isn't performing according to our
[1:07:00] pleasure and our wants. It is not him
[1:07:04] that looks to us and says, "Well, what
[1:07:07] would you want me to do today?" But it
[1:07:09] is us who prays to him, "Thy will be
[1:07:13] done."
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now to think of that
[1:07:18] when we say thy will be done, we are
[1:07:22] actually by our own free moral agency
[1:07:25] asking him or we could even say it
[1:07:28] giving him the permission.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And not only saying, "Well, God, you can
[1:07:35] have your way in my life." But there is
[1:07:38] the desire for God to have his way in
[1:07:40] our life.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; This is the problem. We got people
[1:07:44] proclaiming Christianity, but the Bible
[1:07:47] says that in this day they would deny
[1:07:49] the Lord that bought them. In other
[1:07:52] words, they would deny him lordship,
[1:07:55] rulership. They would deny him the right
[1:07:58] to rule over them.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; See, and and and and so but but the
[1:08:05] elect looks to God and we're
[1:08:08] understanding that God, you're
[1:08:10] sovereign. You are the great shepherd.
[1:08:14] And without you, I'm nothing.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to lead me. I want you to
[1:08:18] have your divine way and your purpose in
[1:08:22] my life.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Now, he knows the way I take because he
[1:08:26] has ordained it. Psalms 37:23, "The
[1:08:30] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:08:32] Lord,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and he delightth in his way. Though he
[1:08:35] fall, he shall not utterly be destroyed
[1:08:39] or cast down." Why? It's a way of life.
[1:08:43] Can you say amen?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Though he fall, he shall not utterly uh
[1:08:49] be cast down for the Lord upholdeth him
[1:08:52] with his hand.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Now, he is the one God is the one as we
[1:09:00] read that he asked Satan, "Hast thou
[1:09:03] considered my servant Job?"
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, God wanted us to understand
[1:09:08] this
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; that before one trial hit Job,
[1:09:14] God was having a conversation.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; God is the one that brought Job's name
[1:09:20] up.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Satan didn't even think he had a chance
[1:09:24] with Job
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; because he said, "Thou hast a hedge
[1:09:29] around him and his house.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I can't touch him."
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hello. That's right. He said to the
[1:09:37] Lord, "You have made an hedge about him
[1:09:39] and about his house and about all that
[1:09:41] he hath on every side."
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; You have blessed the work of his hands
[1:09:45] and his substance is increased in the
[1:09:47] land.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And you're asking me, "Have I considered
[1:09:51] Job?
[1:09:53] I can't do nothing."
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; But you you just let your hedge down a
[1:09:58] little bit. You allow me to get to him.
[1:10:02] I'll be able to do something with him.
[1:10:04] Right?
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; So then then we find the Lord says unto
[1:10:09] Satan, "Behold, all that he hath is in
[1:10:12] thine power. Only upon himself put not
[1:10:15] forth thine hand."
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; So Satan goes from the presence of the
[1:10:20] Lord with the authority and the power to
[1:10:24] touch everything that Job owns.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:31] God wants us to make sure that we
[1:10:34] understand that
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; true
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; that it wasn't just
[1:10:40] men coming and taking Job's stuff.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It was God giving Satan the authority to
[1:10:47] do such
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Now, so God allowed Job to go through
[1:10:54] this trial. It was not because Job
[1:10:58] sinned.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] It wasn't because Job disobeyed God.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; For Job was a righteous man.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; He was walking in the way of
[1:11:10] righteousness.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; For Job says, "He knoweth the way I
[1:11:14] take."
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; It was a way of blood. It was a way of a
[1:11:19] sacrifice.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; It was a way of an atonement.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Job knew that he was perfect before God.
[1:11:29] not by himself, but by a blood
[1:11:31] sacrifice.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And his heart was perfect before God.
[1:11:38] And still God allowed him to go through
[1:11:42] hell.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Job couldn't get away from it.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; He couldn't run from it. He couldn't
[1:11:49] sidestep it. He couldn't prophesy his
[1:11:53] way out of it.
[1:11:55] Come on now.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; He couldn't fast enough to get out of
[1:11:58] it.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Couldn't pray enough to get out of it.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; It was totally out of his hands.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 11:5 says, "The Lord tryth
[1:12:14] the righteous." Can you say that with
[1:12:17] me? The Lord tryth the righteous. The
[1:12:20] Lord tryth the righteous. It's not the
[1:12:24] wicked that he just tries. He tryth the
[1:12:28] righteous.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So then Job acknowledged that God had a
[1:12:34] hand in the trial that he was going
[1:12:37] through and he says, "And when he hath
[1:12:41] tried me,
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I shall come forth as gold."
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Job's story, we learn two
[1:12:52] things that are going on
[1:12:57] when we go through trials. When we go
[1:13:00] through trials, by reading Job's story,
[1:13:04] we understand that there's two things
[1:13:06] that are going on.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; For one, that the trials are a contest
[1:13:10] between God and Satan.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; It's a contest. Now, the the one thing
[1:13:18] that's going on is Satan is trying to
[1:13:21] get Job to curse God.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; He's trying to get you to curse God
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; through your trials that you go through.
[1:13:30] He's trying to get you to curse God.
[1:13:32] He's trying to get us to quit on God and
[1:13:35] give up. That's exactly what happened to
[1:13:37] Job. Even his wife turned against him
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; and told him to curse God and die. Ain't
[1:13:46] that right?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I personally believe that it was
[1:13:49] Satan speaking through that woman,
[1:13:51] trying to get to Job.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe Job really loved that woman. It
[1:13:56] was his wife, helpmate. It was his
[1:13:58] companion. And yet Satan to not not to
[1:14:03] get to her, but to try to get to Job, he
[1:14:06] was speaking through her, which was his
[1:14:09] heart.
[1:14:11] and and and she even tells him, "Honey,
[1:14:14] won't you just give up, curse God, and
[1:14:18] die?"
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; See, I believe that Satan also spoke
[1:14:23] through uh Job's friends and accused him
[1:14:28] of being a sinner. I I I I believe that,
[1:14:32] you know, Satan will affect us, you
[1:14:34] know, he will affect us in our body.
[1:14:36] He'll affect us in our spirit, in our
[1:14:39] mind.
[1:14:40] He will affect us in the things that
[1:14:43] maybe we own or have, we love dearly,
[1:14:47] whatever. And then he will speak to us
[1:14:52] in whatever form. He will bring thoughts
[1:14:55] in our mind. Maybe he'll use people,
[1:14:57] maybe use what whatever. But but he's
[1:15:01] good at putting thoughts in our mind.
[1:15:02] And he brings accusations towards us.
[1:15:06] And he tells us, see, we're not worthy.
[1:15:09] you you you you've done this and you've
[1:15:12] done that and and and and oh, he's he's
[1:15:15] just good at what he's doing. And and
[1:15:18] and his purpose is is to get you to lose
[1:15:21] faith in God,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; to get you to turn and to believe that
[1:15:25] God has turned against you. Why not turn
[1:15:28] against him?
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Is that not the way it is with with
[1:15:32] humanity? is you turn against me, I turn
[1:15:34] against you, you say something against
[1:15:37] me, I say something against you, you do
[1:15:39] something harmful to me, I seek revenge.
[1:15:42] And now he is trying to get us to think
[1:15:45] that God is seeking revenge from us from
[1:15:49] our sins, our failures, and and he's
[1:15:52] after us and all of the there's no hope.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and and and and
[1:15:59] so so we we all experience these things.
[1:16:02] Amen. Of of and and sometimes we can
[1:16:06] even feel, you know, the depths of
[1:16:08] despair and and and the depths of
[1:16:11] darkness. It it goes so long and it and
[1:16:14] the trial is so hot and it just seemed
[1:16:17] like we ain't we just don't know where
[1:16:19] to turn and who to go to and and all of
[1:16:22] these things. Well, you know, his job's
[1:16:24] friends, he had these three friends and
[1:16:28] uh you know, Brother Brandham says they
[1:16:30] were church folks.
[1:16:33] I can't help but believe that they were
[1:16:35] a littleistic, legalistic in their
[1:16:37] doctrines and their ways. And I just
[1:16:40] can't help but believe that they were
[1:16:42] righteous, but they had some
[1:16:43] self-righteous
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; their self-righteousness.
[1:16:47] And maybe maybe they saw things about
[1:16:49] Job that they really didn't approve of
[1:16:53] and had never approved of and you know
[1:16:56] he was a good boy, but they saw things
[1:16:58] that maybe through their legalistic eyes
[1:17:01] uh wasn't just quite right and and all
[1:17:04] these things. And so now that Job has
[1:17:07] lost everything and Job's going through
[1:17:09] the trials and he's got boils and and
[1:17:12] and and he just suffering and it seemed
[1:17:15] like God ain't answering his prayers and
[1:17:18] all that. Now it' be a good time that
[1:17:20] maybe they begin to think that maybe God
[1:17:23] is now starting to see the way they saw
[1:17:25] all along
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; and they start accusing Job of being a
[1:17:29] secret sinner. They they they they start
[1:17:31] finding faults and and start finding
[1:17:34] things that well, any man, any woman
[1:17:37] that really wants to serve God, they're
[1:17:39] going to get hit really hard on them
[1:17:41] things. Well, you've done this and
[1:17:42] you've done that. And maybe maybe you
[1:17:45] know uh uh maybe the you know uh you you
[1:17:48] everything going wrong because you've
[1:17:50] you've disobeyed or you haven't done
[1:17:53] things right and and maybe that's the
[1:17:55] way they people can start thinking about
[1:17:57] a church or maybe they start looking at
[1:17:59] a family and and everybody wants to be
[1:18:02] vindicated and and they feel more
[1:18:04] vindicated when someone else is going
[1:18:06] through the trials and say see I told
[1:18:08] them I I I knew that they were wrong. I
[1:18:10] knew that this was right uh not the way
[1:18:13] that you know and they shouldn't have
[1:18:14] left and they shouldn't have done that
[1:18:15] and they shouldn't done that. Now look
[1:18:17] at their problems.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; But you know
[1:18:24] Job knew he was righteous again because
[1:18:26] of the blood sacrifice.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said God was dealing
[1:18:32] with the saint
[1:18:35] in Job's trials. God was dealing with
[1:18:39] the saint.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; So he was not in agreement with Job's
[1:18:43] accusers.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Now, so, so Satan was using this trial
[1:18:57] to get Job to curse God. That was the
[1:19:00] bet. You let me have him and I'll get
[1:19:04] him to curse you.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:06] Take off everything. Take off the hedge.
[1:19:09] Break all that down. Let me in in on it.
[1:19:12] I'll take his family. I'll take
[1:19:14] everything that he's got. I'll even
[1:19:16] Well, you you know that he came back. He
[1:19:19] wasn't able to get Job that way. So, he
[1:19:21] said, "You let me have him. Let me just
[1:19:23] let me put sickness on him. Let let me
[1:19:27] inflict him in his body." And you know
[1:19:30] how it is when you're inflicted in your
[1:19:31] body, then it starts working in your
[1:19:33] mind.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You're not feeling good. you're running
[1:19:35] fever and you're just starting to get
[1:19:37] weak and and all that. Then it starts
[1:19:39] working in your mind and Satan starts
[1:19:42] talking and he starts knocking and he
[1:19:44] starts all these things. So So that
[1:19:47] trial, Satan was using the trial to get
[1:19:50] Job to turn against God, but yet God was
[1:19:53] using the trial to reveal himself to
[1:19:57] Job.
[1:20:00] the Lord.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Now, Romans 8:28, it Paul would tell us,
[1:20:04] "We know that all things work together
[1:20:06] for good to them that love God, to them
[1:20:10] who are the called according to his
[1:20:12] purpose."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what a prophet said. God
[1:20:16] promised. Everybody say, "God promised."
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; You love the promises of God.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Always love to see what God promised me.
[1:20:25] Yeah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; How many wants to know what God promised
[1:20:27] you?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. Well, I want to tell you what
[1:20:31] God promised. God promised many
[1:20:34] afflictions.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; You still want to know what he promised
[1:20:38] you?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Strange feelings,
[1:20:43] strange things that would be beyond our
[1:20:48] understanding.
[1:20:50] But it's always, everybody say, it's
[1:20:52] always
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; done for our good.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So, so he has established his love to us
[1:21:04] by election.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; It's the best way for him to establish
[1:21:12] his love. Not by giving you a candy bar
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; because tomorrow he might not give you
[1:21:16] that candy bar.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Not by answering a prayer
[1:21:20] of yours because tomorrow you may not
[1:21:22] just get your prayer answered the way
[1:21:24] you want it
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; and as fast as you want it.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; He established his love to us by
[1:21:33] election
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; all together.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Then he has his sovereign way with us.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; But it's done for our good. just can't
[1:21:46] understand it because if we did then it
[1:21:48] would not be a faith to us.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; If we understood everything of God's
[1:21:55] plan, if if we understood if he'd come
[1:21:58] in flesh and he just broke it all down
[1:22:01] for us and broke down our future and
[1:22:04] broke down, we wouldn't have to pray a
[1:22:05] prayer of faith. We wouldn't have to
[1:22:07] preach a sermon of faith. We wouldn't
[1:22:09] have to sing a song by faith. We
[1:22:12] wouldn't have to worship God by faith
[1:22:14] because we'd have it all written down.
[1:22:17] Explain to us that God does things
[1:22:19] beyond our human understanding that we
[1:22:22] would worship him, serve him by faith
[1:22:26] and faith alone.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; He said, see, but we do it. We do it and
[1:22:36] we have it and believe. We believe by
[1:22:39] faith, his word, that it's going to work
[1:22:42] some good thing for us. If we could
[1:22:45] grasp that today, uh uh if we could
[1:22:48] grasp that all of our troubles, there is
[1:22:51] none of us immune from them. And if we
[1:22:55] could realize that those things are for
[1:22:58] our good.
[1:23:03] Every
[1:23:05] every believer is in God's hands for we
[1:23:09] are an eternal thought of God. Brother
[1:23:12] Brandham has labored on that the last
[1:23:14] part of his sermons
[1:23:17] laboring to tell us that we are an
[1:23:20] eternal thought of God.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; God thought of us as his sons and
[1:23:25] daughters. Amen.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; God thought of us as the bride for
[1:23:29] Christ, the bride of Christ. God thought
[1:23:32] of us as word children.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; God thought of us as the pure, sinless,
[1:23:37] virtuous bride of Christ. Ain't that
[1:23:39] right?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; God saved us. Uh we were saved before
[1:23:43] the foundation of the world. Everything
[1:23:45] that God had thought of us to be was in
[1:23:49] God's mind. And that is the reality of
[1:23:52] it. We did not come that way. But the
[1:23:55] reality is is that you're not a sinner.
[1:23:58] You're a son.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Now you have to go through the you the
[1:24:03] process of blood sanctification, the
[1:24:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost coming to
[1:24:07] adoption that God already thought of
[1:24:10] this be in the in the in his mind before
[1:24:12] the foundation of the world. Ain't that
[1:24:14] right? So brother Brown says now you
[1:24:16] were made for an eternal purpose. So God
[1:24:19] is not you you just stumble through here
[1:24:21] and you're parting and drinking and
[1:24:23] lying and acting like an idiot and then
[1:24:25] all of a sudden you you think, "Oh my, I
[1:24:28] need to get saved." You know, and you
[1:24:30] get saved and then God all all of a
[1:24:32] sudden gives you a purpose. No, God had
[1:24:34] a purpose for you before the foundation
[1:24:37] of the world.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so therefore,
[1:24:41] you were made
[1:24:43] even when you were conceived in sin,
[1:24:46] born in iniquity, all of that stuff. You
[1:24:49] were made for an eternal purpose because
[1:24:52] you was the manifestation of an
[1:24:54] attribute that was in God that thought
[1:24:57] of you and expressed you. And he made an
[1:24:59] earth to take you out of and to make you
[1:25:03] a human being. Can you say amen? He did
[1:25:05] not make you for this earth. He made
[1:25:07] this earth for you. That's true.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; For you would be an expression uh uh
[1:25:16] laying there in the dust and God would
[1:25:18] take that dust. Amen. And put you in
[1:25:21] that body, amen, to express his
[1:25:24] thoughts.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; So he made an earth to take you out of
[1:25:29] to make you a human being. Sin come
[1:25:32] along, perverted his way. You come
[1:25:34] anyhow, but you was lost with the world.
[1:25:36] So he came and redeemed you.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; The expressed attribute. Can you say
[1:25:44] amen?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; So now he says in the future home, all
[1:25:47] the curse of sin is gone when the Holy
[1:25:51] Ghost accepts you.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You don't accept the Holy Ghost. The
[1:25:55] Holy Ghost accepts you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? you you ain't just
[1:25:59] coming and you know just walking down
[1:26:01] through life and and God who
[1:26:04] there might be something special about
[1:26:06] him.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; I think I'll just try and give him the
[1:26:09] Holy Ghost. See what happens.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; No, you were an eternal thought.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost accepted you
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; because you were in his mind.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You didn't accept the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg for it and plead
[1:26:25] for it. The Holy Ghost comes and accepts
[1:26:29] you.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Now watch he says now if it's the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost means God's spirit is the
[1:26:40] attribute the thought of God has
[1:26:42] accepted you because uh that you were
[1:26:46] ordain ordained for that purpose. Yet
[1:26:49] you was born in sin but God had that
[1:26:51] attribute and here you expressed
[1:26:53] yourself here on the earth. He comes
[1:26:55] down and gets you.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; He comes down and get you.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Satan thought he had you.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Satan thought he had you. And that
[1:27:08] stupid devil thinks he still got you
[1:27:10] when you're going through your trials.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; But God come and broke that power. Satan
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; loose you. He came to get you.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? comes down and gets
[1:27:24] you. You're back here. Here is where you
[1:27:27] belong. You're back here. Sin has lost
[1:27:29] its power. That's right. The desire of
[1:27:32] sin has done gone from your heart. When
[1:27:34] the Holy Ghost comes in, you are a
[1:27:37] restored person.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I'm as glad you're a restored person.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Now, you have that token, right?
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But in order to become the clear
[1:27:48] or full expression or whatever you want
[1:27:50] to call it of God's thoughts, we must be
[1:27:53] molded into his image, word image.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; So there now has to be a molding.
[1:28:03] Doesn't mean you lost the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:06] God's put that in the scripture and the
[1:28:08] prophet laid that clear. And if you ever
[1:28:12] got the Holy Ghost, you're sealed.
[1:28:15] Amen.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; You're sealed to the day of your
[1:28:19] redemption.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Not when you lost the victory. When even
[1:28:22] when you lose the victory, you've got
[1:28:24] the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Even when you have fallen flat on your
[1:28:28] nose, you still got the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Even in your darkest moments, you've got
[1:28:34] the Holy Ghost. There's nothing that can
[1:28:37] take that. You're sealed.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; But there's a molding.
[1:28:43] Yeah,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; there's a shaping,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; there's a trimming,
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I liked um what
[1:28:53] one
[1:28:55] uh brother said. He was talking about
[1:28:57] Moses and um
[1:29:00] Michelangelo.
[1:29:03] And if I it's going to be paraphrasing,
[1:29:06] but basically he said he took that rock
[1:29:10] and he wasn't he wasn't mo he wasn't
[1:29:13] shaping Moses out of that. He already
[1:29:16] saw Moses.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; He saw Moses in that rock.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He just chipped away all the stuff that
[1:29:23] wasn't Moses.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's true.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; He already saw Moses in that rock. Now
[1:29:31] he just started chipping away things
[1:29:32] that wasn't Moses, that wasn't a part of
[1:29:35] Moses.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; What you always was a son of God. You
[1:29:38] was always a daughter of God. You was
[1:29:40] always there. That God has to take all
[1:29:43] of that stuff that is not part of that.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; It's not part of your original life.
[1:29:49] It's not part of the original thoughts
[1:29:50] of God.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; So there has to be this molding and and
[1:29:57] the prophet Jeremiah speaks of it.
[1:29:58] Jeremiah 18:1, the word which came to
[1:30:02] Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, "Arise,
[1:30:04] go down to the potter's house, and there
[1:30:06] I will cause thee to hear my words."
[1:30:09] Then I went down to the potter's house,
[1:30:12] and behold, he wrought a work on the
[1:30:14] wheels.
[1:30:16] And the vessel that he made of clay was
[1:30:18] marred in the hand of the potter,
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; still in the hands of the potter.
[1:30:23] So he made it again another vessel
[1:30:27] as seemed good to the potter to make it.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Now Job 23:13,
[1:30:37] this is Job in his trials.
[1:30:41] He said he is of in one mind speaking of
[1:30:44] God who can turn him. Aren't you glad
[1:30:47] for that?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Now that's comforting when you're in the
[1:30:50] trial.
[1:30:52] It's comforting when you're out of the
[1:30:54] trial, but it's very comforting in the
[1:30:56] trial.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He is in one mind. Who can turn him? Can
[1:31:00] I turn him? Nope. Can my accusers to
[1:31:03] turn him? Nope.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Is there anything to turn him? Nope.
[1:31:08] He's in one mind. Who can turn him?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; And what his soul desireth, even that he
[1:31:14] doeth.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; For he perforth the thing that is
[1:31:19] appointed for me. Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; And many such things are with him. Ain't
[1:31:25] that right?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So the prophet prayed this prayer. He
[1:31:29] said, "Great sculptor,
[1:31:31] great God who made man and molded him
[1:31:34] and fashioned him in your image, your
[1:31:36] own image. I pray thee, Lord, that
[1:31:38] you'll take us tonight. May this be a
[1:31:41] memorial night real me memorable to us
[1:31:45] that tonight Lord tonight here right
[1:31:48] here in the Stardust Motel. May you mold
[1:31:51] men into the image of the sons of God.
[1:31:54] Granite Lord great sculptor. You're the
[1:31:57] only one can do it. Take your word Lord.
[1:32:00] Mode it right into the hearts of all of
[1:32:03] us that we might be masterpiece
[1:32:06] in the last days and be called the bride
[1:32:08] of Christ. Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; So, see, there's a molding. There's a
[1:32:12] shaping.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, he called us to be the the bride of
[1:32:17] Christ. Yes, he called us to be sons and
[1:32:19] daughters of God. But now, there's a
[1:32:21] molding. And he does it by his word.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; We find out that the Bible says the word
[1:32:32] of the Lord tried Joseph
[1:32:34] until the time that his word came. So
[1:32:37] don't don't think for a moment that you
[1:32:39] can accept the word of the Lord and not
[1:32:42] be tried by it.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:32 says, "But called to
[1:32:49] remembrance the former days in which
[1:32:51] after you were illuminated,
[1:32:55] you endured a great fight of
[1:32:57] inflections."
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; True. After you were illuminated, after
[1:33:02] you had received revelation,
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; you then endured a great fight of
[1:33:09] affliction.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Even when John ate the book, he said,
[1:33:14] "It was in my mouth, sweet as honey, and
[1:33:17] as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was
[1:33:19] bitter."
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says, "See, in his lips,
[1:33:23] it was sweet." See, when you have to
[1:33:25] digest it, digest this word.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? Then it gets
[1:33:30] bitter.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody's against you.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody's saying you're a holy roller.
[1:33:37] You're this, that, or the other. You're
[1:33:39] off on your head. You're off your head.
[1:33:41] See, so it's hard to digest it. But when
[1:33:44] you're testifying of his glory, it's
[1:33:47] sweet in your lips.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Have you ever just been discouraged and
[1:33:51] you're going through the battles and you
[1:33:53] just start talking about the Lord?
[1:33:55] something just begins to happen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; That's true, the Lord.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; You just get excited. You get pumped up.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Because it it it now it's in your lips
[1:34:08] and it becomes sweet to you.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; but when you digest it, it becomes
[1:34:13] bitter.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; See, so so it it it it's sweet in your
[1:34:20] lip. That's all. When you stand up in a
[1:34:22] meeting and you say, "Glory to God." Oh,
[1:34:25] hallelujah. When you're going through
[1:34:27] that great siege, it's hard. But then
[1:34:30] when you're out of that great siege and
[1:34:32] you can testify of it, then it's sweet
[1:34:35] in the lips. That's his book of
[1:34:38] redemption.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Now, God knows what it's going to take
[1:34:43] to get me to where he wants me to be.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; He knows what it's going to take to get
[1:34:49] you to where he wants and ordained you
[1:34:52] to be.
[1:34:54] Ain't that right? He He sees the bigger
[1:34:56] picture. He knows we may not see the big
[1:34:59] picture, but he sees the bigger picture.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; And and and so therefore, he's not
[1:35:04] wasting his time with me or he's not
[1:35:07] wasting his time with you. Uh uh Job's
[1:35:10] trial was not a waste of God's time.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Did you know that God already knew that
[1:35:18] Job wouldn't curse him? Right?
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; So, the trial wasn't the fact that,
[1:35:22] well, I'm going to see if Job will curse
[1:35:24] me or not.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; God knew that Job wouldn't curse him.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Satan didn't know. So, Satan thought he
[1:35:32] had a winning hand.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; And God says, "Okay, you do whatever you
[1:35:39] want to. Don't take his life, but do
[1:35:41] everything else."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; But God already knew.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Already knew. But God was going to use
[1:35:46] this trial to to to to teach Job
[1:35:49] something.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; So, so we find that that God used the
[1:35:57] the trial to bring Job closer to him.
[1:36:00] God used it to give Job a better
[1:36:02] experience of him that one he had known
[1:36:05] before. For Job 42:5 says, "I have heard
[1:36:08] of thee went by the hearing of the ear,
[1:36:10] but now my eye seeth thee."
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It did not destroy Job.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; It didn't make his faith weaker in God.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; God used the trial to show himself to
[1:36:27] Job.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Job says in Job 19:25, "I know that my
[1:36:39] redeemer liveth." Now, you know, he
[1:36:41] didn't know that. He didn't know that
[1:36:43] when before the trial.
[1:36:46] He didn't know that. But something
[1:36:48] happened to Job.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; In the trial,
[1:36:52] God began to give him a revelation. And
[1:36:55] he stands up and says, "I know my
[1:36:56] redeemer liveth. And he shall stand at
[1:36:59] the latter day upon this earth." Can you
[1:37:02] say amen? And though after my skin worms
[1:37:05] destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall
[1:37:07] I see God. for whom I shall see for
[1:37:09] myself. My eyes shall behold not another
[1:37:13] though my reigns be consumed within me.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; God used the trial to take all take in
[1:37:19] purity out of Job. For Job says when he
[1:37:22] have tried me I shall come forth as pure
[1:37:24] gold. See so trials are for our benefit.
[1:37:27] How many believes it?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Trials are for our benefit.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 1:7 says, "The trial of your
[1:37:38] faith, being much more precious than of
[1:37:41] gold that perisheth, though it be tried
[1:37:44] with fire, might be found under praise
[1:37:46] and honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:37:48] Jesus Christ." Brother Brown said, "It's
[1:37:50] it is God giving us these trials."
[1:37:53] Everybody say, "It's God giving it."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; God given us these trials. After we
[1:37:58] become his property, our confession, our
[1:38:01] baptism, our promise to walk in life for
[1:38:03] him, then every trial that comes upon us
[1:38:06] is to perfect us for his glory. Is to
[1:38:10] bring us to a place where God can make
[1:38:12] himself more real to us than he was
[1:38:14] before the trial came.
[1:38:17] Another place he says, why does God let
[1:38:19] troubles come? God harnesses trouble,
[1:38:22] puts bits in its mouth, and makes it
[1:38:24] obey him. And those troubles bring us
[1:38:26] into a closer fellowship with God. There
[1:38:29] had been no rainbow until the flood
[1:38:31] came. But after Noah was pressed into
[1:38:33] that condition that he was in to float
[1:38:36] 40 days and nights in a storm and the
[1:38:38] little ark pitching up and down in the
[1:38:41] water, it was after the flood was over
[1:38:43] that he saw the rainbow for its first
[1:38:45] time. The covenant of hope, the covenant
[1:38:47] of promise. After he had went through
[1:38:49] the tribulation, then he saw the
[1:38:51] promise. And that's the way you see the
[1:38:53] promise. after you've gone through the
[1:38:56] tribulation.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Tribulation does not
[1:39:00] take away the promise. It does not take
[1:39:02] away the covenant. It just allows you to
[1:39:05] see it more clearly.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; after Abraham went through his trial,
[1:39:12] the prophet said he spoke face to face
[1:39:14] with Elohim under the oak that day. It
[1:39:16] was after he had suffered his trials,
[1:39:18] after he had went through the troubles
[1:39:20] that he had went through that God
[1:39:22] appeared to him in the form of a man and
[1:39:24] sat there and told him he was married
[1:39:26] and his wife's name was Sarah and said,
[1:39:29] she laughed at him in the tent behind
[1:39:31] him. It was there that Abraham called
[1:39:33] him Elohim. It was after the trial and
[1:39:36] tribulation. It wasn't until the Hebrew
[1:39:39] children was forced into the fiery
[1:39:41] furnace on one of their most outstanding
[1:39:44] trials that they seen one like the son
[1:39:46] of God standing among them. Their
[1:39:49] troubles produced the son of God
[1:39:51] standing among them in the breezes to
[1:39:53] wave away the heat wave. But not until
[1:39:56] they went into the fire did that
[1:39:58] comforter appear.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; It was after Daniel was forced to go
[1:40:02] through a trial. He saw the angel of the
[1:40:05] Lord standing in the midst of him, that
[1:40:07] great pill of fire standing between him
[1:40:10] and the lions. And the lions could not
[1:40:11] get him because he had went through the
[1:40:14] trial and tribulation and troubles.
[1:40:18] Oh, if the church could only wake to
[1:40:21] itself today to find out that after the
[1:40:24] troubles and trials and laughs and made
[1:40:27] fun of the things that the church has
[1:40:30] been through, the Pentecostal church,
[1:40:32] that we see God in our midst, doing
[1:40:34] great signs and wonders.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; It's only God bringing something to us,
[1:40:44] making himself more real to us. Praise
[1:40:47] the Lord.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to know God by the book
[1:40:50] and by intellectual knowledge, but it's
[1:40:53] one thing to go through the experience
[1:40:55] of knowing him
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; and seeing him. Paul says in 2
[1:41:00] Corinthians 4:13, "Our light
[1:41:03] affliction,"
[1:41:05] can you say that with me? Our light
[1:41:06] affliction
[1:41:08] light. He calls your affliction, my
[1:41:10] affliction light.
[1:41:14] Our light affliction which is but for a
[1:41:18] moment
[1:41:19] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:41:23] eternal weight of glory.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Now one thing the prophet says in all
[1:41:28] these things Satan tries to make us
[1:41:31] nervous
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and upset us
[1:41:37] to get us to think oh why did this
[1:41:39] happen? Why? Why couldn't I have been
[1:41:42] made this way? Have you ever just
[1:41:44] thought of those things?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Well, why? Why did I do it that? Why?
[1:41:48] Why? Why? Why couldn't I be someone
[1:41:50] else? Why do I have to go through these
[1:41:52] things?
[1:41:54] It is Satan trying to get you to get
[1:41:57] nervous.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to get all anxiety and
[1:42:04] full of nervousness to where you can't
[1:42:07] rest in the promises of God.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; God made you the way you are.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; He knows the way you take.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; For he ordained it.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; He ordained that you would receive the
[1:42:21] message of the hour. Yeah.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; He ordained it that you would take the
[1:42:26] book and you would eat it.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; And he knew the sufferings that would
[1:42:30] follow. He knew the afflictions that
[1:42:32] would come.
[1:42:34] But be assured, the Lord deliverth every
[1:42:37] one of us.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Out of them. Can you say amen?
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. He said
[1:42:45] God curs or Job cursed the day he was
[1:42:48] born.
[1:42:50] So he did curse.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; He cursed the day he was born.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "May the stars not shine at
[1:42:59] night, nor the sun by the day,
[1:43:02] but he wouldn't curse God."
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Got him to curse the day he was born,
[1:43:10] but he wouldn't curse God.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] He said, "And there, Satan got him right
[1:43:18] down to the very threadbear moment."
[1:43:23] The very moment that it just seemed like
[1:43:26] Job was going to break.
[1:43:31] And the only thing that Job did was
[1:43:33] curse the day he was born.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we find that it's after that we
[1:43:43] have suffered a while
[1:43:45] that Paul would tell us that we would be
[1:43:48] made perfect. We'd be established,
[1:43:51] strengthened, and settled. Can you say
[1:43:54] amen?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; We want to stand, don't we?
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; I um
[1:44:07] I think there was um brother Brandham he
[1:44:11] says you know uh he says those crucial
[1:44:14] hours that press us onto those sacred
[1:44:18] sands. It was in the Bible. He said and
[1:44:21] you remember no matter how great the
[1:44:23] distress is, Satan cannot take your life
[1:44:26] until God is finished with you. And
[1:44:28] there's nothing that can happen to you
[1:44:30] unless God permits it. There is no evil
[1:44:33] that can come unless God permits it. And
[1:44:36] it's for your good
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; that he's working that.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; It's for your good. Everybody say, "It's
[1:44:43] for my good."
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; My good.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; So don't be downhearted.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; It's for your good.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; You love him?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; So he says this. He says, "And if the
[1:44:57] musicians will come,"
[1:45:02] he said, "When your faith is put to a
[1:45:04] test, then don't fail.
[1:45:07] Stay right with what you believe."
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Don't alter. Don't get discouraged.
[1:45:16] Don't say, "Well, maybe I'm just
[1:45:17] believing it in vain." Stay right with
[1:45:21] what you believe.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; God's revealed it to you. This message
[1:45:24] is right. That's right.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; And if you notice that none of the
[1:45:32] trials
[1:45:33] that the saints went through in the
[1:45:35] Bible throughout history,
[1:45:39] Satan was never able to get them to quit
[1:45:42] God.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Never able to get them
[1:45:48] to give up.
[1:45:50] Job 23:11,
[1:45:52] he says, "My foot hath held his steps.
[1:45:56] His way have I kept and not declined.
[1:46:01] Neither have I gone back from the
[1:46:03] commandment of his lips. I have esteemed
[1:46:06] the words of his mouth more than my
[1:46:09] necessary food."
[1:46:12] Yep. Satan couldn't get him to curse
[1:46:14] God.
[1:46:16] The words of God became life to Joel. It
[1:46:19] became more dearer and dearer. Can you
[1:46:23] say amen? I thought of David and the and
[1:46:26] the troubles and the trials that that
[1:46:27] man went through
[1:46:30] and buddy he went through them.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; But Jo or Psalms 42:5 or 42 and1 David
[1:46:38] said, "As the heart panth after the
[1:46:39] waterbrook, so penneth my soul after
[1:46:42] thee, oh God." You didn't find him
[1:46:44] getting discouraged. You didn't find him
[1:46:46] wanting to quit. You didn't find him
[1:46:48] just wanting to get away from everything
[1:46:49] and just leave God and curse God and
[1:46:52] deny God. The hunger for God became
[1:46:56] greater.
[1:47:00] My soul thirsteth for God, for the
[1:47:02] living God. When shall I come and appear
[1:47:06] before God? My tears have been my meat
[1:47:08] day and night, while they continually
[1:47:11] say unto me, "Where is thy God?"
[1:47:14] When I remember these things, I pour out
[1:47:16] my soul in me.
[1:47:19] For I had gone with a multitude. I had
[1:47:21] went with them to the house of God with
[1:47:24] the voice of joy and praise with the
[1:47:26] multitude that kept holy day. Why art
[1:47:29] thou cast down, oh my soul? Why art thou
[1:47:31] disqued in me? Hope thou in God, for I
[1:47:35] shall yet praise him for the help of his
[1:47:39] countenance.
[1:47:40] Do you have it within you to praise him?
[1:47:43] Can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[1:47:45] and praise him?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is greater than the
[1:47:50] storms. God is greater than my trials.
[1:47:53] God is greater. Satan ain't going to get
[1:47:56] me to curse God. I'm becoming more
[1:47:59] hungry. I I'm becoming more desirous of
[1:48:02] him. His word is becoming more precious
[1:48:06] to me. The promises are becoming more
[1:48:08] dear to me.
[1:48:11] The stronger the the the winds come, the
[1:48:15] the the hotter the fire gets,
[1:48:18] the more precious God becomes to me.
[1:48:22] Hallelujah. He knows the way I take.
[1:48:25] It's a way of life.
[1:48:27] It's not a way of destruction.
[1:48:30] It's the way of the righteous.
[1:48:33] Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah. What song?
[1:48:39] Something keeps holding me
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] every day. I see.
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:51] Helping me faithfully
[1:48:55] to overcome
[1:48:57] my trial.
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:03] constantly guiding me,
[1:49:09] giving me victory.
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:15] He's a reality.
[1:49:19] Jesus is holding me.
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:26] All the trials of this world was getting
[1:49:33] closer.
[1:49:38] Oh, the pull I felt was more than I can
[1:49:45] bear.
[1:49:47] Oh, yes it was.
[1:49:50] And I was on the verge of just giving
[1:49:57] over.
[1:49:58] [Laughter]
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] Oh, of justice within myself. It just
[1:50:07] wasn't.
[1:50:10] But as Job said, he gives me strength.
[1:50:14] Something keeps holding me.
[1:50:18] Oh, every day I see
[1:50:24] he's helping me faithfully. It ain't you
[1:50:27] overcoming yourself.
[1:50:30] It's not you standing by your own
[1:50:32] desire, your own will. It's God there
[1:50:35] that's with you.
[1:50:37] It's God showing he's there to comfort
[1:50:40] you. He's there feeding faith in you.
[1:50:44] He's there sustaining you, preserving
[1:50:47] you.
[1:50:49] [Music]
[1:50:50] Hallelujah. It's a reality.
[1:50:53] Jesus is holding me.
[1:50:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:50:59] Oh,
[1:51:01] Satan laid before me his temptation.
[1:51:11] Oh, it was his desire
[1:51:15] to steal away my faith.
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:23] Oh, but I have found in time
[1:51:28] the revelation.
[1:51:35] Oh, the strength I need to keep me in
[1:51:40] his grace. Aren't you glad for the
[1:51:43] strength of God? Oh, something keeps
[1:51:46] holding me.
[1:51:50] He's worthy of our praise, church.
[1:51:53] Hallelujah. He's worthy.
[1:51:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:52:02] We're going to come through.
[1:52:05] We're going to come through.
[1:52:07] Satan will not keep us from the rapture.
[1:52:11] Satan will not keep us from the promises
[1:52:13] of God.
[1:52:16] Hallelujah. I've got a resolve to serve
[1:52:19] him. I've got a faith that's stronger
[1:52:23] than yesterday.
[1:52:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Sing it
[1:52:28] again. Oh, something keeps holding me.
[1:52:36] Every day I see,
[1:52:41] helping me faithfully
[1:52:45] to overcome
[1:52:47] my trial.
[1:52:52] Oh, constantly guiding me,
[1:52:58] keeping.
[1:53:00] Oh, yes, yes, yes.
[1:53:04] It's a reality
[1:53:07] that Jesus is whole. Sing the second
[1:53:11] verse, shall we?
[1:53:13] Oh, now
[1:53:16] Satan laid before me.
[1:53:21] What a temptation.
[1:53:23] He laid it before Jesus. He laid it
[1:53:25] before Eve. He laid it through all the
[1:53:28] time.
[1:53:31] Trying to steal away my faith.
[1:53:35] Hallelujah.
[1:53:37] Oh, but I have found in time
[1:53:42] the revel. What are we doing? We're
[1:53:44] proving we're not like Eve.
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:48] All the strength I need to keep me in
[1:53:54] his grace.
[1:53:58] Oh, something keeps holding me.
[1:54:04] Every day I see
[1:54:09] helping me faithfully
[1:54:13] to overcome my trial.
[1:54:20] constantly constantly
[1:54:26] giving me victory.
[1:54:29] [Music]
[1:54:31] He's a reality.
[1:54:35] Jesus is holding
[1:54:38] me.
[1:54:40] [Music]
[1:54:43] I'm reminded I I think me and brother
[1:54:46] Tim talking yesterday and I was telling
[1:54:49] reminded of that story of brother
[1:54:51] Brandham talking about Billy Paul
[1:54:55] when Billy just a little baby child
[1:55:00] and he had it was in the middle of the
[1:55:02] night sometime and he had to go to the
[1:55:04] bathroom. He said, "Daddy, I got to go
[1:55:06] bathroom."
[1:55:08] He said, ' Okay, just just go down the
[1:55:10] hall.
[1:55:12] He said, 'Well, why don't you come with
[1:55:13] me?
[1:55:15] He said, 'By, he says, it's baby, it's
[1:55:18] just right down the hall. You you'll be
[1:55:21] fine. You're you're okay. He said, I was
[1:55:23] so tired and weary. And
[1:55:26] he said, "Oh, Daddy, come on. Come come
[1:55:28] come with me."
[1:55:30] So, he Oh, okay. So he got up and
[1:55:35] Billy grabbed a hold of his hand and
[1:55:37] they're walking through the dark
[1:55:40] he stumbled on a toy or something and he
[1:55:42] fell. I believe that's the way the story
[1:55:45] went.
[1:55:49] He got brother Brandham helped him get
[1:55:51] back up and he looked at at brother
[1:55:53] Brandham said, "Daddy, why won't you
[1:55:54] just hold my hand?"
[1:55:57] And he said, "That's the way it is. We
[1:55:58] just want God to hold our hand." When
[1:56:01] we're going through the times of
[1:56:03] darkness and the times of trouble, God's
[1:56:06] there just to hold our hand, isn't he?
[1:56:09] Oh,
[1:56:10] beholding me.
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:38] eternal.
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:46] Jesus is holy.
[1:56:53] Oh, the trial of this world
[1:56:58] was getting closer.
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:04] The pull I felt was more than I could
[1:57:10] bear.
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:14] Oh, and I was on the verge of just
[1:57:20] giving over.
[1:57:25] The strength within myself
[1:57:30] just wasn't there.
[1:57:34] Oh, but something keeps holding me.
[1:57:41] Every day I see.
[1:57:45] Oh, he's helping me faithfully
[1:57:49] to overcome my trials,
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:56] guiding me constantly,
[1:57:59] [Music]
[1:58:01] giving me victory.
[1:58:07] He's a reality.
[1:58:11] Jesus is holding
[1:58:14] me.
[1:58:16] Oh, something keeps holding me.
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:23] Every day I see
[1:58:28] he's helping me faithfully
[1:58:32] to overcome my trials.
[1:58:37] [Music]
[1:58:38] Oh, guiding me constantly,
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:44] giving me victory.
[1:58:49] Oh,
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; it's a reality
[1:58:53] for Jesus is holding me.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; As they play softly, I very thankful of
[1:59:02] what God is doing in Sister Martha's
[1:59:04] life.
[1:59:06] and um
[1:59:10] um
[1:59:13] something that seemed to be horrendous
[1:59:19] I believe by the hand of God that it's
[1:59:22] brought it down and
[1:59:24] and into a mild form
[1:59:28] of uh what they I guess they would call
[1:59:30] it cancer a mild form just a just tumor.
[1:59:34] her.
[1:59:35] Uh they said that she's had it for years
[1:59:39] and u so now she's they're wanting her
[1:59:44] to have this surgery as soon as possible
[1:59:47] to get this out and um so we want to
[1:59:51] just keep praying for sister Martha.
[1:59:53] She's lost a lot of weight and uh very
[1:59:57] weak and u uh just having to force
[2:00:02] herself to drink, have to force herself
[2:00:04] to eat and um it's u
[2:00:09] it's attached itself to different
[2:00:11] things, but uh it looked like they're
[2:00:13] going to have to take part of her colon
[2:00:15] and they're saying that she'll have to
[2:00:16] wear a bag possibly.
[2:00:20] uh you know and and but it's it's I
[2:00:24] think it's kind of funny that the doctor
[2:00:27] would say that the devil trying to bring
[2:00:29] fear
[2:00:31] but I remind the devil brother David
[2:00:34] Gadman just had surgery
[2:00:37] I think yesterday
[2:00:40] or today I think maybe yesterday where
[2:00:43] they cut a big part of his colon out the
[2:00:46] doctor said that they would he would
[2:00:48] have to have a bag and and uh if not
[2:00:52] permanently, temporarily, but it looked
[2:00:55] all doom and gloom and all that. But he
[2:00:58] gave the testimony today, you don't have
[2:01:00] to have a bag at all.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So take that, devil.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; We will not fear the doctor's report.
[2:01:10] The doctor knows what he knows, but we
[2:01:13] know better. We know greater. I was
[2:01:16] telling brother Andrew, we was talking
[2:01:17] today. I said, 'You know, it's amazing.
[2:01:19] This message is the answer.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; It It has the answers to everything. He
[2:01:24] sent me a quote the other day and you
[2:01:27] know, we planes falling out of the skies
[2:01:30] all the time here lately. You know,
[2:01:32] Brother Brandham talks about that and he
[2:01:35] says the reason why the planes, he gives
[2:01:37] the answer as to why the planes are
[2:01:39] falling out of the sky. I wished I had
[2:01:41] the quote with me. I'd read it to you.
[2:01:43] Look it up, though.
[2:01:46] He gives the answer as to why planes are
[2:01:48] falling out of the sky.
[2:01:51] I thought while they're looking all
[2:01:52] over, people are getting fired left and
[2:01:55] right. But we got the answer.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, we got answers.
[2:02:02] Whether it's in the world, whether it's
[2:02:04] to our bodies, whether it's in our mind,
[2:02:06] to our minds, to our trial, whatever, we
[2:02:09] have the answer.
[2:02:11] You know, and and you know, I know I've
[2:02:13] hit psychologists, and I'm sure
[2:02:15] psychologist does good for other people,
[2:02:18] but we don't need no psychologist. We
[2:02:20] got answers.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad to live in a day that we got
[2:02:26] answers. Thank God for the message of
[2:02:29] the hour.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:33] Well, God bless you as our prayer. We
[2:02:35] want to just keep Sister Martha in our
[2:02:37] prayer. Keep Steve in our prayer.
[2:02:40] keep uh Sister Alice. Is she doing good?
[2:02:45] Well, we we certainly want to keep
[2:02:47] Sister Alice in our prayer and um
[2:02:52] um
[2:02:53] keep Brother Amos, Sister Lisa as
[2:02:56] they're going to be traveling for a few
[2:02:57] weeks,
[2:02:59] uh ministering at different churches.
[2:03:01] And so we want to always keep them in
[2:03:04] our heart as they are and that God would
[2:03:08] just bless their trip. You know, we
[2:03:12] ain't got time to waste.
[2:03:15] We want to do everything that we can for
[2:03:17] the kingdom of God, don't we? I mean, we
[2:03:20] ain't got much time. Y'all heard about
[2:03:22] the tsunamis. I mean, they're predicting
[2:03:25] the whole West Coast. I don't know if
[2:03:26] that's over. I hadn't looked at the news
[2:03:28] yet or here lately, but they're
[2:03:31] predicting a tsunami from to Alaska,
[2:03:34] Hawaii, to the whole west coast of
[2:03:36] America.
[2:03:38] An 8.8 earthquake, I think that's what
[2:03:41] they said, off of Russia. Church, we're
[2:03:45] close.
[2:03:47] We're close.
[2:03:49] Stay in prayer.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Stay with God.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Not time to get discouraged. do all you
[2:03:55] can for the kingdom of God. Can you say
[2:03:58] amen?
[2:03:59] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Brother
[2:04:02] Terry, do you want to dismiss us in
[2:04:04] prayer?
[2:04:12] Father God, we have the answer to the
[2:04:14] devil's question. Thank you, Lord.
