I remember I was somewhere recently and um with a group of I think there were quite a few um nominal Christians there and they they were really nice people but we were talking about something and um I remember like when they said something I was like oh yeah brother Branham talked about that you know like that was the first thing I wanted to say because I was thinking well they'll know what I'm talking about but I was thinking but they don't it is a different language that we speak and um I think I still ended up you know I I kind of tried to still fit it in there that I could but I was like you just can't say it in the same capacity when you're with a different group of people and uh anyway I'm thankful that we've been able to we've been blessed to learn that language you know and revelated to it hmm I never said that I would give you silver gold or that you would never feel the fire or shiver in the cold but I did say you'd never Walk Through This World alone and I did say

that you can hold on to this is the promise this is the promise I've made to you I never said that friends would never turn their backs on you or that the world around you wouldn't see you as a fool but I did say like me you'll surely be despised [Music] and I did say my ways confound the wise [Music] I didn't say you'd never taste the bitter kiss of death or have to walk through chili Jordan to enter into rest but I did say I'd be waiting right on the other side laughs and I did same I'll dry every tear you cried cause you know I made a promise that I prepare to place and someday sooner than

that worked yesterday hope you're not too sore but I really appreciate everyone that was able to come brothers and sisters and uh work and we had just a good time of fellowship and got a lot done so I really appreciate the uh you coming and um you know it lets us know that you're in in and I'm not saying there's you know uh those of you that couldn't come we understand but uh when you see the body coming together and it's not just a pastor's church it's it's the People's Church and we all interested in in God's what God is doing and and so we certainly appreciate those that were able to come and and I know no doubt everyone wanted to come and couldn't come but um some couldn't but anyway it's it's just good when Brothers can come together and sisters and good to have brother Jordan amen God bless you and always good to have him and uh that little Luke man you've done a good job man yeah I've done good singing right there buddy so we uh uh always good to see these young people uh entering into service and I said always always but this message produces the best young people you know we when I was a kid you know in the Pentecostal uh now my dad except my dad and you know my dad made us sit on that front row we couldn't pass nodes we couldn't do nothing so we didn't get to have that you know fun that all of my friends buddy they were all in the back passing notes cutting up and all that stuff and and you know I guess every one of them are out of church today and um but you you get on you know I've gone to Pentecostal churches just to visit and and it's the same way young people don't care but our young people I tell you uh you get the young people together whether it's in this church or any any place uh most places in the message our young people are on the front they're interested in God listening to the services taking notes and I just say God bless you young people you have that desire to serve the Lord and we sure love and appreciate you and glad to hear the just you got touched and blessed and had a wonderful time at camp they're in Oklahoma and um like to say it's just good to have my precious daughter back amen she was gone for a couple weeks and flew back yesterday and so glad to have her and also I was asked to announce to you sisters that there is a sign up sheet in the back for desserts for the upcoming meeting so we asked that uh if you want to do something uh for the Lord this would be a good way to start and let's make a dessert because it will be much needed and you you will need to sign by April 16th and so just keep that in mind and also brother Sherman Davis I guess all of us know brother Sherman but he is in need of our prayer as he's going through just a really rough time right now uh yes first of all I had surgery yesterday and his gallbladder I believe and it was a doctor went in there and it was gangrene had set in so he's uh he's you know recovering from that but also his brother Donnie passed away Wednesday and so there to be having the memorial service uh today at two and so you know um and and so I I know that's got to be hard for brother Sherman and the family and so we want to just keep them in our prayer at the Lord will just strengthen him help him and the family as they go through this this uh this time and um also uh uh uh asked to announce there are CDs in the back singing CDs of that if you want to take one or all of them home with you or whatever but I think there's uh brother Matt Morris had a CD sister Vanessa Morris had a CD brother Sherman I think their CDs are in the back and so if you want one you're welcome to take them and that I know you'd be blessed I'm sure also brother Andrew is in New Mexico preaching for brother Manuel today and so we want to just keep him in our prayers and he's asked me to greet you all him and sister Mariah really hated uh that they weren't able to make it yesterday for the the work day and he said just to greet you missing the church and you know we certainly missed the when they're gone and um you know but he's got a a job to do and and so he's he's doing that as an evangelist and so we want to always keep him in our prayer and that is a task I've done it for several years evangelizing and and there's there's always the pros and cons to it just as there is to pastoring or whatever we do um but we we want to do what the Lord has called us to do and do it with all that's within us amen and I believe brother Andrew is doing that and we certainly appreciate him and and his family if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Proverbs the first chapter and those that are sick the Sister Crystal uh sick Brother Sam uh sick and so we want to keep them in our prayer and it's good to have sister Hannah with us amen and always miss her when she's gone good to see brother shamaya and sister Bethany feeling better there and good to have them back in service with us and just everyone that is able to come today we want to just keep brother Walker in our prayer and always continuing to pray for him amen the Lord will just be with him praise the Lord but before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we come to you this morning realizing our need for thee Lord we we don't want to ever get to the place that we're self-sufficient and Lord there's times that even we don't even realize it but we go throughout the day not even acknowledging you and just asking your help in the simple things and Lord but we want to take the time today just to ask you Lord to be with us and to help us father as the song says we can't even walk without you holding our hand and Lord if it wasn't for your grace if it wasn't for your hedge built around us Satan would be able to to destroy us Satan would be able to to have his way with this but Lord we are as what Paul would say we are what we are by the grace of God and father we pray that your our worship the songs that have been sung are pleasing in your sight Lord that you would feel welcome here I pray that you would just take over now Lord and annoying both speaker and hearer is our prayer and let it be just a divine Divine saying Lord that only can come by you Lord and your Prophet said that we'll never leave a service the same I pray that every one of us will leave better this morning father and let it be because of you we ask it Lord bless the church here God bless the congregation is our prayer Lord grant the desires of their heart those that are sick God pray that you had just touched them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen we look at Proverbs the first chapter but it says the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive instruction of wisdom Justice and judgment and equity to give sub septility to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion a wise man will hear and will increase in learning a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsel to understand the proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge can you say that with me the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction may the Lord just add in his Blessing to the word you can have your seats this morning and and I guess the the title that I would use I'm going to continue with this thought but uh the title I guess I would use is the the fear of the Lord begins with knowledge a few weeks ago this um this phrase came to me the fear of the Lord and so I I went to search what the Bible and said about it what the prophet had to say and I found out that having the fear of the Lord is is really important for us and um and I also discovered that it is a rare thing today and that really only the elect will have it the fear of the Lord the whole world as we've talked about we know it is possessed with fear but this is what the prophet would call this kind of fear is the devil's fear and it it has torment and we see that God delivers his people from this type of fear and that this fear does not come from God for the Bible says that the Lord hath not given us the spirit of fear but but we find that he does give his people fear and it is the fear of the Lord and we talked about it but the fear of the Lord brings a respect a reverence and all towards God and to his word now there's people that have fear of a they they respect maybe a a basketball player an athlete of some sort or the president or and and and and you should always well when it comes to an office like the president we should we should respect that office as best as we can but but there's a greater fear that the Lord would give us and that is for him and his word it's a holy fear that uh brings about a faith in God a trust in God a a confidence a love for God and it's all wrapped up in the fear of the Lord to have this confidence in God it takes the fear of the Lord to have a love for God it takes the fear of the Lord it to have this trust in God it takes the fear of the Lord and and it it doesn't mean that you're afraid of him we we should be beyond that and and when I say that I'm not saying that we don't deal with with things that Satan tries to put on our mind uh but but really down in our soul there should be this confidence that that come hell or high water God is always faithful to me yeah and well that that that that that would have to start with the fear of the Lord You Have To in order to have that you have to have the fear of the Lord because you you can't you can't have confidence in something you don't respect you you can't have trust and and uh love for something that you just don't you don't reverence but but see so it starts with respect and reverence uh to him and so we we find that the the fear uh uh uh of the Lord brings a a uh you're not afraid of him but but what it does is you want to honor him in all that you do and all that you say and and uh uh it causes an individual to want to please God to to walk softly and humbly before him you you you wouldn't want to act arrogant not not when you have the fear of the Lord because you you have a knowledge of him you you so so it brings a reverence and a respect you respect his counsel you respect his wisdom you respect you understand what I'm saying it's just like when you have respect for your Elder then you ain't gonna sit there and tell that Elder what to do uh if you have respect for a man that that has gone through you you've seen it you know maybe your your uh uh a soldier If he if you're just a a young uh punk you know and and you you've come into this in into uh to the Army but you've seen this guy that's gone through battles and and he's he's Brave and he's uh he's you know you've seen him go through things and well it should develop a respect and so then then you start looking at that individual like wow you know so then when he gives you an advice you ain't like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no you respect that individual so then you start taking his vice seriously because you know he's been through it so now he's teaching teaching you how to how to be brave he's teaching you amen how to avoid certain traps of the enemy because you've seen what he's done and and so you've developed this ain't that right and and and so it it that that goes with young men that's starting a business or whatever you've seen a guy that that that has started a business and he's ran that business he's successful with that business and then he tries to tell you advice and then you say yeah yeah yeah yeah and then you go start trying to do your own thing well I think you're a punk you know what I'm saying you're just what the Bible would call a fool if you can't take advice if you can't take wisdom if you can but when you see and you see this man is successful and he is trying to impart knowledge to you good to have you sis I overlooked you but uh good to have you amen but he's trying to impart knowledge to you he's trying to impart wisdom he's trying to part uh to save you from failure well if you reverence him and you respect his experience then then you will take his knowledge and you'll take his advice you'll take amen because there is a reverence there is a respect well how much is it with God then if you have the fear of the Lord ain't that right and and so then then we we begin to take notice of God we begin to take notice of what he wants we uh what he desires what he he he is after and and so therefore the fear of the Lord uh causes individuals who have it to be careful how they act to be careful in what they say to be careful in what they listen to and to look at you know what they look at and all these things because they don't want to displease the Lord in any way ain't that right so Proverbs 8 13 says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil well why because God hates evil and so if you have the fear of the Lord and your reverence him and you're in all of him well then wouldn't that bring the same attitude towards you that if God hates it whatever pleases God pleases me whatever he ate then I hate whatever you see and so Proverbs 16 6 tells us that men depart from Evil when they have the fear of the Lord ain't that right see so then the fear of the Lord brings an about an action upon our part now we are living in an age where people instead of departing from Evil they are calling evil good and good evil ain't that right and they're fulfilling the prophecy where Isaiah 5 20 says woe unto them that call evil call good uh evil good and good evil that put forth put Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter see they don't understand the difference between good and evil so they're calling that which is evil good and that which is good evil ain't that right so what is good well Psalms 34 8 would tell us oh taste and see that the Lord he is good ain't that right but we're living in a day amen that they call that which is good evil and that which is evil good ain't that right well then they don't understand the difference between light and darkness because they're putting forth uh uh they consider Darkness to be light and light to considered to be Darkness but then we find First John 1 and 5. this then is the message that we've heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all but they call that which is light darkness and that which is Darkness they call light ain't that right well then they we're living in age they don't cons they don't understand the difference between sweet and bitter amen and here yet Psalms 119 and 103 it tells us how sweet are thy words unto my days yay sweeter than honey to my mouth ain't that right and Psalms 141 and 6 when their judges are overthrown in Stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweet ain't that right but yet we find that the Bible says for this age they will call uh uh this that which is sweet they'll call it bitter and that which is bitter they will call it sweet see see so there's no understanding uh uh in in this age at all a man and so therefore the Bible tells us that we are to serve God having the fear of the Lord ain't that right amen not to use our own judgment but the fear of the Lord brings about a judgment that is right amen because now to have the fear of the Lord you can't re you can't reverence the basketball player more than God hey man what is that basketball player going to do for you ain't that right you have to play you you have to pay 200 and some dollars just for a ticket or more then and then you don't even know if they're going to win or lose and even if they do win what did it do for you you got to go back to your own miserable life you got to go back to work you didn't bring your retirement it didn't bring you uh uh uh you know uh uh the jackpot did nothing for you at all and yet people reverence the that a man but when it comes to God they don't want nothing to do with it and he's your joy he's your life he's your peace he's your anchor he's your salvation he becomes your Refuge amen but they call that which is good evil and they call that which is evil good and yet that basketball that basketball players probably you know a lot of them uh they produce many more children than that they need you understand what I'm saying ain't a father to them you know and uh and and they have children by so many women and and this and that and this and their life is corrupt but we put them as a God and we honor that instead of honoring God can you say Amen we'll go to that instead of the house of God hot well it just it's just it's mixed up it takes the fear of the Lord can you say man so so we are to serve God not just serve him because if you don't have the fear of the Lord you'll serve him any old way but you serve him having the fear of the Lord ain't that right so then in other words our service to him is to be done in reverence and respect to him our obedience to his word is to be done with reverence and respect to his word not saying well I just I guess I got to do it you know I'm a Christian you know let's let's just get it over with the preacher's gonna you know he he gonna preach at me sometime you know if I don't do it that that ain't it you've got to do it with respect you got to do it with reverence how you run your house that's your problem that's your business but it needs to be done with respect it needs to be done with rev with reverence unto the Lord can you say man how you live your life that's up to you amen but if you're going to serve God do it with reverence and respect ain't that right so now the scriptures tell us the importance of having the fear of the Lord look at Proverbs and we've read this before but Proverbs 23 17 it says let not thine heart Envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long for surely there is an end don't forget that there's an end ain't that right there's an end to those that are rebellious to God there's an end to those that are prospering out in the world and ignore God there's an end to that basketball player there's an end to that golf player there's an end to the pornography guys out there there's an end to the just the ones that are playing Church there's an end to everything can you say Amen so don't live life thinking that there's not an end [Music] they may be enjoying the prosperity now they meet me amen being blessed and and prospering in their business and ignoring God Amen but there's an end to that so don't forget there's an end ain't that right whatever you're doing today young people there's an end to it you're if you want to live for fun and all that remember there's an end to that so what you want to do is live all your days in the fear of the Lord amen can you say amen he says seed for surely don't don't let nothing heart Envy Sinners but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long for surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be cut off can you say Amen well how many is looking for a coming of the Lord that means looking for a body change how many is looking for a millennium well don't let that expectation be cut off can you say Amen there's a lot of people that are preaching behind Pulpit saying the Lord is coming but they they don't reverence God the people don't reverence God they just come to church when they want to come to church they just live their life well however they want to without regards to God and say we're going to make it but remember their expectation will be cut off you've got to serve God in the fear of the Lord so your expectation don't be cut off because there is an end to life there's an end to life as you know it and we're coming to that end do you believe that as we talked about it the wrath of God is coming upon this earth and the fear the fear is gripping the people's hearts amen but you've been delivered by that from from that type of fear you've been delivered to where you're not afraid of Tamara you've been delivered for the fact that you're not afraid of what laws they pass it doesn't matter what the government does it doesn't matter what people do let them walk away from this message but I will fear the lord I'm gonna reverence God Proverbs 14 26. in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence when when you have the fear of the Lord because you're not serving God God is not an icon to you God is something personal ain't that right and his children shall have a place of Refuge and the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death ain't that right so the spirit of life then if the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life then the spirit of life Works where the fear of the Lord is you believe that now brother Brown says the reason that the spirit is not operating in the church the way it is uh among these people is because a lot of it is irreverence it's because of irreverence they don't respect it see you've got to respect anything God sins no matter what it is you've got to respect it to get the good from it you believe that you got to respect it that's right that's why we got to I'm just gonna get off for a moment but that's why we got to respect one another it's not just oh oh Amos you got to bring respect to that brother Amos ain't that right yeah well it's it's just well whole Brenda no it's sister Brenda what what is it it's because there's a respect there if there's no respect how can they help yeah ain't that right if if if we too busy cutting the body down that's why brother Branham said you got to respect the pastor if he's going to help you you you just can't walk up and chew him out and then expect him to be able to help you it takes a reverence well that's the same way with God you just can't just walk any away before God and expect his help The Refuge comes to those that fear the lord reverence him respect him you understand what I'm saying see it's constantly always respect reverence if if if a church usually if people get disgruntled with the church it's because somewhere they begin to listen they listen to negativity and so long they listen to it and allow that to enter into their soul into their heart to their thoughts and then they begin to devalue the things of the church they begin to devalue worship they begin to devalue the whereas when they you know used to first come everything was new he's like oh wow this is awesome well then let Trials come and let things go and let let let us rub shoulders then we get to know one another and and we see all the upsets and all of that then you get to hearing the disgruntled then you hear this and you hear that and you hear that and if you're not careful you lose respect then you don't want to come to church then it just who cares you know what I'm saying that then you look at the musicians as well well they're not helping you anymore where they used to just be able to help you you just hear the musicians and wow just so bless your soul but if you lose the respect if you lose that reverence you understand what I'm saying well that that's the same way with anything amen and this is why we've got to keep that respect and that reverence and and and and then we want to live right so that we people can reverence people can respect but the problem is today is people got so Twisted that they call evil good and good evil so they respect the wrong things and disrespect the wrong things so now Hebrews 2 and 1 Paul would tell us we ought to give the more Earnest Heat to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip ain't that right see so so then we we find that the natural church has let it slip they've let what God has done in this age let it slip can you say Amen Why by not respecting it like they should God has sent the greatest Revival here on the earth that has ever been known in this age but they've let it slip every time that God would send a Revival in each age they've let it slip by them Luther let it slip Wesley let it slip Pentecost let it slip can you say man what happens they've left the supernatural slit by them they've let the move of God slit by them they've let everything that God is slit by them with because they didn't respect it they didn't reverence amen it become common to them look at the healing campaigns it becomes so common to the people today that they've let it slip and you say Amen brother Branham even says that we've seen so much of the goodness of God till it's become common to us we just don't respect it like we should church I want to tell you don't let this message become common to you it's the greatest thing it's the thing that's going to get you in a Rapture it's the thing that you need for a body change don't let every service become common to you don't let the message become common don't let the quotes become common now it's to the point that the preacher's the same well we don't need to read quotes anymore you know we got God and it's just all you know it's just whatever church I would rather read you quotes and let you know where it come from and let you know I'm smack dab in the message of the hour then you don't even wonder where I'm standing at can you say Amen why because I want your faith to be angered in what God has said in this day and we've got to respect it can you say man we got to respect it and so now notice our opening scripture says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so look at knowledge it's the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity gain through experience or Association the fact or condition of being aware of something that's what knowledge is is you become aware of something the range of one's information or understanding the circumstance or condition of apprehending Truth ain't that right the act or state of knowing see so so that I I hope it's getting to you amen but our understanding see of Truth brings the fear of the Lord ain't that right are being aware of of something brings see it's a knowledge that's what knowledge is see the act of knowing having a clear perception of fact truth or Duty certain apprehension so this is what the fear of the Lord comes by knowledge ain't that right now if if uh I know here lately I've been having you turn but if you'd like to turn with me uh uh to Isaiah 6 and 1 and and I'm going to try to hurry uh uh but but I would like for you to read this with me um and you could read the rest of the the the chapter when you get home but Isaiah 6 and 1. when you're there Say Amen most of us so in in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple what a knowledge of God man he didn't see his knowledge of God his perception of God the knowledge that came to him was that he was he reigned that he was over all that he was a conqueror that he was mighty can you say Amen and and he's sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his faith with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory amen now notice these seraphims amen uh uh uh what what were they doing they had wings at the two Wings they covered their face in the presence of God and two Wings they covered their feet in the presence of God Amen see they knew they were in his presence can you say Amen they were in his presence now Isaiah is now having this knowledge that he is in the presence of God Amen and so notice and see they had the knowledge of being in his presence and it caused them to cover their faces it caused them to cover their feet can you say man these creatures that did not know what sin was that they ain't sinners and and yet standing in the presence of holy deity a God that reigned Over All sinless creatures and yet they would cover their face and their feet and the prophet says what was it they were doing it in humility in reverence to him respect unto him can you say man the prophet said see we don't have anything to cover it's all we've got we don't have wings to cover ourselves but he said we got the blood and it covers Us that we could come into His presence oh my it's greater than just Wings it's the thing that makes us holy in his presence it makes us able to come into His presence and then he says see we ain't got those wings he said but we bow our head at his feet we bow our heads and pray in reverence and respect can you say Amen everything we do it's in reverence and respect humbly bowing before him why we have this knowledge that he's not dead he's not a god of history but he's now made known to us and this is what Isaiah said when he come into the presence and he acknowledged this all of a sudden it brought a response whoa it's me for I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips can you say amen amen see and so that's what happened when he come when his knowledge came to him that he was in the presence of all almighty God when Moses had the knowledge that he was standing in the presence of God he took off his shoes for he knew that he was standing on Holy Ground brother Brown said see it just showed you got to do something when you're in his presence you just can't stay this way people can't stare again people can't stay mad people can't stay bitter amen when they really can acknowledge that he's in their pres his presence when they're in his presence and they know it they they really have that understanding that knowledge it brings a reverence it brings an awe it brings a something there can you say man I thought when the light a man which was none other than Jesus admit Paul when he was on his way to the smash Damascus Paul fell on the ground amen and he fell on his face amen uh in respects to God the prophet said amen because he realized he wasn't just in the presence of something mighty man amen he was in the presence of almighty God when John the Baptist recognized amen that who was standing in his presence Amen to think of that now to recognize that Jesus was God Amen the Lamb of God and there he was standing in his presence John would even say I'm not even worthy to touch his feet I'm not even worthy to loosen the sushu latch off of his feet amen and yet the feet is is is as we know is the dirtiest part amen uh uh cause it because they would walk and the dust would be on his feet and and and and and and and and the dung and and all this stuff you know how it is it'd be like your shoe you know walking into a men's bathroom and there's you know you don't know what you're going to you know it's just the uh the stench and the and and all that nasty stuff well and yet John would look at that and say but I'm not even worthy to touch his feet something that's dirty something that is you understand what I'm saying amen and brother Brown said it showed a reverence that John toward him it showed a humility that God that John would show it showed that he had a knowledge of who was standing before him can you say Amen it was that John says who no no I ain't gonna touch this feet no he says I'm not worthy to touch it amen Hallelujah brother Branham he said be conscious of your littleness if you want to get somewhere with God make yourself real little don't make yourself big like King Uzziah remember he started out small and God blessed him but then he got big in his own mind he'd become a legend in his own mind to where he tried to take The Minister's place and brother Bram talked about that these businessmen that tried to take a Minister's place they're so big they're so successful in business that they think they can run a church tell the pastor what to do tell a preacher what to do you happen that happens a lot hello but don't make yourself big brother the Brian said he uziah thought he was too important to listen to the the minister brother Brown said you correct people about something or tell them about their wrongdoing they'll leave the church and isn't that about the way it is today you tell them you rebuke it you you talk about the situation you correct it and they'll just flat leave it's become a smorgasbord today and and so brother Brown says see they won't go tell somebody tell tell women they shouldn't you know wear short hair well I'll just go somewhere where they can where I can wear it see no respect no reverence right brother Brown said a big man humbles himself so he said make yourself little can you say that with me make yourself little and God will exalt you see but he that exalts himself shall be made a base will be brought low ain't that right so brother Brown said always be little ain't that Ryan he said don't be the big shot be the little fella right be the little fella now you have to do this to serve the Lord because you you don't serve God for gain I don't Pastor here for popularity I don't I don't don't you don't you when you sing you you shouldn't sing to get Praises of the people right and when we clap we're not praising you at all we're praising God for sending a talent to us to be a blessing to us you understand what I'm saying we're not here to just say oh Ben our band is great no no even though I I think everyone should play their be their best if you're going to be on the platform be your best I mean work together be be your best because that's what God made us to be right if you're going if you're going to do your job do do your job right be your best I think Billy Paul says the dad told him so if you're gonna if you if you know if you if you if you're gonna be a bum then be the best bum that that ever was and never work a day in your life be the best bum so you know if you're going to be a uh if you're going to be a good be a husband be the best you're gonna be a wife be the best if you're going to be a child well you can't help but be a child but be the best right we won't be the best preachers we want to be the best day manners we want to be the best Christians we want to be the best deacons we want to be whatever we are let's be the best but be little be little can you say Amen be the little guy amen that's what brother Brown said he said God is the only one that's big anyhow ain't that right but now notice now and it takes the fear of the Lord to do this now see so this age is fulfilling the prophecy in second Timothy 3 2 for men shall be lovers of their own selves so then it's not in this age it's not in the people of this age to be lit to be the little fella because they're lovers of their own selves they and and and here in the fourth verse lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so that they're actually everything that is appeasing to them that's what is good that that is what they worship amen they ain't got time to reverence God they ain't got time amen uh for the things of God and and to put the the priorities in in in their right perspective ain't that right amen see and and and it's coming to the point and we're here where there's so many excuses and Jesus said it would come that the invitation would begin given out but everybody would have an excuse as to why they couldn't come I've got this I've got that I got to do that why it fits what it is lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God lovers of their own self more than lovers of God ain't that right but in the middle of all of this there is a people that's willing to bear his reproach there is a people that's willing to belittle amen and that's the only way that you can really serve God is because service to God is doing what he wants you to do not what the people want you to do not what your wife not what your husband not what your children not what anybody else wants to do you and God and God Alone ain't that right you're willing to sacrifice your time you're willing to sacrifice your pride you're willing to sacrifice your own ideas about it you're willing to sacrifice everything there is Amen to please God and then you have to have the fear of the Lord to do such is this all right but see today there's no reverence to God brother Brown said it seems that it seems to be that people can just do anything in the name of the Lord and get by with it and boy ain't that the truth and and what happens and brother Brown says it and while they're doing this they'll split a church and keep strong influence they'll keep their influence strong among the people no matter what they do why because people don't have the fear of the Lord anymore true he said they keep a strong influence no matter what they do against the principles of God he said we just take the name of God and use it any use it anyway prophesy in it when means when it means nothing but some kind of carnal influence and so forth and say things that never happen and act and and and act like it you know he says we we never pay attention people never pay attention I've thought of all the prophecies that go forth in in the world today that don't mean a squat that ain't got no bearing whatsoever on anything but because people don't have the fear of the Lord to say hold it you represent my God that way my God that has an infinite knowledge that don't have to guess they don't have to beat around the bush amen hello that is so accurate he can tell you your name your address tell you what you just prayed this morning right but then because some guy gets up and says oh someone's got heart problem someone going through a trial here this morning hello I could do that I could call every one of you young people out and say you got issues in your life you're struggling with things let me no one holds it responsible well anyone can do that hello just a small group right here there's illnesses there's things you're struggling with there's discouragements there's nothing you can pick that stuff up right but brother Bill if I told you well you know you you went to the heart doctor uh uh Friday at one o'clock and the doctor told you you're gonna die by Tuesday well now that's either facts or what is it right so now he would have it was him you know now now if I was a real bold I'd say raise your hand up and let the people know that that's right isn't that what brother Brandon done raise your hand let everybody know that that's right he wanted them to witness that what was just said was the truth ain't that right but now if I really don't know that and I'm just running and just just just whatever I ain't gonna ask you for nothing to witness but I guarantee you somebody should you older brother Bill afterward and say was that right why because it was so descriptive that it was either right or wrong ain't that right so so we find that he says we can just take the name of God and use it in any way prophesy in it when it means nothing but just some kind of carnal influence and so forth and say things that never happen and act like he'd never he said never pay attention any attention to it see now another place he says see these no reverence no respects the people today they don't respect God they have no reverence they take his name in vain they tell the dirty jokes and even ministers do that you hear a joke I guess you know would be all right but the minister should be examples I think of what righteousness and Holiness is see that's the reason I think maybe we don't get no further than what we do see uh uh we're not don't come this well that with sincerity that we ought to have in it when you're carrying on and going on you lose that little grain of sincerity you know see there's something about that see you must remember that God is watching you every hour he watches you when you're asleep now I think the reason that people do those things is because they're not conscience of his presence are you with me now they're not conscience of his presence that's why they allow things to go on that's why they'll watch television and allow things to come into there out of that television that's against God and there's nothing there to condemn them is because they're not conscience of God's presence no more hey that's watching on on the on the YouTube or anything else and you say Amen see they're not conscience of his presence but yet he is there where where whether you think he is or not he looks at he he sees every look that you make every move that you make he knows all about it but we ought to realize that you're with me now we ought to realize this see we used to have a little song when I first come among the Pentecostals they sang All Along the road to the soul true Souls true Abode there's an eye watching you I sing in a sister Hannah a man haven't seen that I miss her singing uh that song every step that you take this great eye is awake there is an eye watching you he said see he says now that is true God's omnipresence knows what you're doing and even your thoughts one time he says while I was in a vision I was speaking to a being standing by me and he said back he said your thoughts are louder in the heaven than your voice is on Earth he knows what you're thinking you might say uh you you might say you do this and you do that and it see but you see down in your heart if you thinking different you're doing something wrong see you should be he said you should just uh uh you should be just what you are see the heart the mouth should speak what's in the heart and so we find that the people doesn't realize the presence of God he said you know they ought to be like David the man uh was after God's Own Heart and he said the Lord is always before me can you say that with me the Lord is always before me that's why we should pray on our business that's why we should pray and what we're going to do tomorrow that's why we should ask God's blessings upon what we do can you say Amen the Lord is always before me wherever he goes he remembers God is always before him he is on my right hand and I'll not be moved because God is on my on his right hand ain't that right see so then the world today now is not conscience of the presence of the Lord but we find that God wants to teach knowledge how many believes that God wants the people to have his knowledge or to have knowledge Isaiah 28-9 he asked the question Whom Shall he teach knowledge ain't that right amen so that means there's going to be a scarce people people that would be scarcely amen that he can teach knowledge to ain't that right why the prophet said because they got their own theological experiences and things to rely on they won't go back to the word of God see the knowledge that God teaches is from the word of God it doesn't come from a textbook it doesn't come from some Theory it doesn't come from some Theologian or seminary it comes from the word of God now we find Proverbs 1 29 uh tells us of a people that hated knowledge they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord ain't that right so to reject knowledge is to not choose the fear of the Lord now if if you allow me just a little bit more time it's not that people today hate all knowledge they they don't hate all knowledge it's just a certain kind of knowledge they hate uh uh this knowledge and and and and yet the knowledge that they hate is what brings the fear of the Lord uh uh but let's look at it Daniel 12 and 4 for foretold of this day say be increased when at the time of the end how many believes we're here we're at the time of the end and he says knowledge shall be increased amen but see this knowledge comes from the the tree of knowledge uh which Adam and Eve partook of in the Garden of Eden ain't that right brother Brown said it's a worldly knowledge and not a Godly knowledge ain't that right now in second Timothy three and seven Paul foretold of this day saying that the people would be ever learning ain't that right and yet never able to come to the knowledge of Truth ain't that right so they're getting a knowledge they're learning they're ever learning amen but they're not able to come to the knowledge of Truth in this age we got more seminaries than ever before we got more colleges than ever before universities than ever before we got Christian and secular schools colleges uh uh universities and all that then education is being promoted amen like never before amen it's it's this age and then we got you know the seminaries that that are everywhere and yet their knowledge is a Baptist knowledge a Pentecostal knowledge a presbyterian knowledge it's a knowledge that they're gaining amen but yet in this age of ever learning they're never able to come to the knowledge of Truth can you say man so it's not just any knowledge that we're after we want the knowledge of Truth and if you can get the knowledge of truth it's a grace to you ain't that right now so this this layout of sin Church age is filled with Pentecostal knowledge but if you notice none of their knowledge brings the fear of the Lord that's right if they get if they had the fear of the Lord they'd depart from them denominations can you say man if they had the fear of the Lord they would they would take a prophet's message of what the prophet said in this age that's right if they had the fear of the Lord they'd come to the knowledge of Truth it would show that they would come to the knowledge of Truth and they wouldn't preach uh tongues as the evidence of the Holy Ghost can you say man they wouldn't be baptizing in Father Son and Holy Ghost they they they they would they would look at what the truth is and acknowledge that truth and uh and say yes I'm aware of that and it would bring the fear of the Lord to them ain't that right that how many women are preachers today because they're ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of Truth yet the Bible Still Remains the Same that a woman is not to preach can you say man and we've got it all in our Pentecostal ranks Amen in the Pentecostal ranks uh uh uh where the women are allowed to preach but the Bible says the knowledge of Truth says don't do it and if a woman had that knowledge of Truth it would bring the fear of the Lord in reverence and respect ain't that right now look at look at this what what is the knowledge that God has been trying to teach the people in Jesus day he had three pools the first pull of his ministry was Healing The Sick second pull of his ministry was the prophecy that went forth Prophet said when he revealed the secrets of the uh that was in the people's hearts ain't that right now these two first two pools everybody loved everybody followed everybody amen gathered around ain't that right amen see so brother Brown said the first the first pull was Healing The Sick the second pool was rebuking the organizations and prophesying what they had done what they were what was coming what is what what what will come what was see and all these things that's what he'd done but then he began his third pull and what was the third pull him revealing himself as to who he was see healing was for one thing amen but we find out that Satan can impersonate that that a man knowledge is is or or uh uh the the the second pull was another thing a man that even Satan has a lot of impersonations through with all of that as well but then that third pull God would get in part to them a knowledge that was a mystery remember they had he asked him you know he asked him who do men say that I have the son of man and there were people all around guessing as to who he was ain't that right he was a mystery he was a mystery to the people we know that thou are a man come from God for no man can do these things but they could not point the fact that he was God so now he began to that third pull to reveal to give and impart a knowledge that God was not in heaven God was among them he that has seen me has seen the father oh man ain't that right he was imparting a knowledge to them uh Prophet said Jesus was wonderful and when he went in the church and healed the people and everything but when he sat down one day and said I am my father a one oh that did it lest you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he didn't explain it he wanted to see who would stand by him now that's where the fear of the Lord would come right who those who would take that knowledge and understand that knowledge and apprehend that knowledge it would bring the fear of the Lord oh John the Baptist had it right he said I ain't even worthy to losing his shoe latch touch his feet right but look look look look look at what the soldiers done they spit on him slapped him why two different knowledges see now notice another place brother Brown said see he didn't explain it they had already seen the manifestation the Vindication of the word of God for his age made real and proved to them that he was that messenger of the age he had done it he had done the signs he had showed that he was the Messiah by his word now he's going to tell them I am he right and guess what everyone left but his disciples and he didn't begged them to stay he just said will you go also but what did Peter say where could we go why he had already had a revelation that he was the Christ and he's saying where could we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life there was something that brought a fear of the Lord to them they didn't understand everything but the knowledge that they had of him being God what else did Jesus teach them Matthew 12 42 the queen of the South Jesus said shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solemn Solomon and behold a greater then Solomon is here ain't that right now I got to tell you church he that is greater than Solomon has come in this age do you believe that what a knowledge it wasn't a preacher that just called me it wasn't just a teacher that just come he that is greater than Solomon has come to us in this age and this same knowledge that Jesus imparted to them has been imparted to you and I ain't that right brother Brown said see when I'm standing here see my Ministry is different is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher for my Ministry is to declare him that he is here then you say man see it wasn't just to give you a little Bible Lesson his ministry was to declare he is here and every person that preaches this message is the same Ministry to declare that he's still here among the people can you say Amen see we have the knowledge it's a knowledge that he is here we weren't just given a Bible lesson it's a knowledge that would bring the fear of the Lord to us ain't that right see we have seen the Messiah sign we have seen his presence being Vindicated here even science vindicates it their technology and God didn't have his own elect take that picture he had his enemy take that picture [Music] ain't that right so see we we find that when Jesus was here on Earth what did he drive what knowledge did he try to impart God was in flesh he was God in flesh he declared that he and the father were one ain't that right he showed them the Messiah sign he fulfilled every scripture that spoke of the Messiah brother Bradham says see uh uh if I can see he says Jesus brought God to human lives God was made human you believe that see when Jesus was born God became man that he might become fellowship with man and in man to achieve one purpose and that is to bring man uh uh to what God is say that again to bring man to what God is ain't that right now what did we do when we see Jesus we saw the supernatural God made manifest who else could walk on water who else could turn water into wine who else amen could could uh uh tell a person where they were and what they had done and what the what was in their past life and all of these things who else could do that but God Jesus brought God to man ain't that right what a knowledge he said see Jesus was born God became man that he might become fellowship with man and in man to achieve one purpose and that is to bring man to what uh bring to man what God is not what a church is but what God is get your eyes off of a church get your eyes off the denomination get your eyes off of some theory of man get your eyes on God can you say Amen well that's what he wanted that's why Jesus came amen and revealed the supernatural among them people was to get their eyes off their Fellowship card and their Creeds and their dogmas and their formalism to where they could see a supernatural God again among them you believe that what a knowledge amen not what a church is but what God is Jesus came that he might present God to man and man didn't want it they hate that knowledge ain't that right now notice John 10 and 32 I'm going to wrap it up but you bear with me now and Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me and the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because thou being a man make us thyself God they hated the knowledge that he was trying to give them and they crucified him for it ain't that right now today this same God that lived in a human being Jesus Christ has come again today you believe that where is he at he's made one everybody say one with his church today one who's this church it's a many-membered body he's become one in you one in me one amen same Oneness God's is able to achieve it to Calvary do you believe it so if he come one again in the church is it not our responsibility to bring God to man to get the world's eyes off of their Creeds back to him gone again hello do you know what the world hates this knowledge yes brother Brown said see it's usually in the nights just maybe the Holy Spirit come right Among Us and go to manifesting himself making himself known among us and then by that I think it's real he said when he can maybe in sovereignty I can't say now this man or this woman or that child seat the holy spirit moves out in the building on the building and speaks to whomsoever he will speak that's Sovereign and then that brings the knowledge see because it's a promise of God and that brings the knowledge of the god Sovereign right and also brings his presence down among us we should see it and rejoice you see where our rejoicing is I know the Pentecostals they got their emotions and all that this is not an emotional High I know people say we're Pentecostal and call Brandis Pentecostal it just shows ain't seeing what we're excited about we've seen the Messiah we've seen the vision we've got a knowledge that is not imparted to the Pentecostals Presbyterians Baptist or whatever there's a knowledge that has been imparted that deity is no longer in heaven it's in you praise the lord it's true brother Brown said see Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ this isn't you just becoming well you know I've been in here 15 50 years you know I know that Bible back and forth I've read it a thousand times will be if there's not a message to build you to the full stature of Jesus Christ that's what the message is for him now notice he said God never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build the individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word see by his word build up the individual to that place ain't that right another place brother Brown said this is the age of life it's the personal life of Christ the chemical of his body what was in him is now present today he is the sake brother Brown says it he is the same in every aspect but his Corporal body do you believe that now he didn't leave when brother Branham left now I understand brother Brenner had a special gift and all that and that Ministry was to pull us you remember that you remember the fishing you know the the first pull and and he got that little old fish in the second pool there was a little old fish he said but it'll be that third pool that would catch it and it caught the the the rainbow trout the world record remember that the big old rainbow trout it was the third pool that caught you you understand what I'm saying what was that the revealing of himself the revealing of the word now we're seeing he is the where it's his life in you the mystery that was in the mind of God is now imparted to you and it's brought the fear of the Lord to us our worship is now and under the fear of the Lord in reverence and respect our service to him is now in the fear of the Lord because we realize we're not just just ah church members no we're Sons and Daughters of God that deity lives in can you say Amen his presence is always abiding with us do you believe that I don't care where you're at he says though I walk through the valley of the Shadow over death thou art with me wherever I am thou art with me why you're his Dwelling Place dynamics of the Holy Ghost is in you brother Bill you're you're not just uh just an individual that lives on his watch Ever Street and your neighbors just look at you as old Bill Papa Bill Grandpa Bill Uncle Bill you know and and Father Bill or whatever you know and and these things no you're a Son of God and God has recognized you in this age by him he himself coming inside of you now what a knowledge that is to and it brings the fear of the Lord it brings a reverence amen that we want to please him in everything we do amen we want that we his purpose to be fulfilled in our lives in our body we're not just here just doing our own thing and and if we don't like it we just don't like it we just go do something else no we're here to do the will of the father we're not here for the Pauls of men we're not here for the Praises we're not here for the accolades we're here for the will of God can you say amen and it brings the god to the people again praise the Lord bless the Lord and the world hates that knowledge because this knowledge comes by experience and you say man if you allow me five more minutes this tells us that they are anointed with the Demonic spirit for Satan hates the knowledge of God which is the knowledge of Truth when you have the knowledge of God see then you come to the knowledge of Truth right see and Satan hates this knowledge because then he cannot deceive the people with his lies because the knowledge that they've received is truth how when you know truth how can you be deceived by lies ain't that right they see God for who he is they see God for what he is they see that God is not dead He's Alive so they don't see him as a god of history of what he did they see what he's doing it even brings it more to the knowledge that I am a Son of God that he lives in me his grace is with me his anointing is with me whether I feel it or not it comes by knowledge of Truth right then what does Satan what can Satan do to you he tries to put the thoughts in discourages ah this message ain't good you know you're going to hell anyways and like a water on a duck's back what we've got knowledge of Truth we're living in the most deceitful age ever and yet we have the knowledge of Truth which brings the fear of the Lord just imagine what God has really done for you if that could be a real knowledge of truth that God has really saved your soul what a reverence it brings to us right that he's the one that's carrying you brother Branson it's not your own ability it's not your own power it's not your own talents that God has kept you it brings the fear of the Lord in reverence to him God give us it amen Satan has sought to be like God Isaiah 14 13 it says for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the Stars I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most time second Thessalonians 2 4 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he has God sitteth in the temple of God showing that he is God right this is Satan's agenda jinda this is his goal has he not done it Matthew 24 23 then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not don't go following can I say this in respect don't go chasing revivals I'm I'm for revivals I'm For You Youth you young people going to youth camp but don't think that you got to have that to be a Christian don't think that you have to have that to have an experience with God is with you at all times if there's a new birth God is with you and you have to expect the trials to come I I feel sorry for you young people but at the same time I won't be blunt with you you're going to go through trials so don't just sit there and pity yourself woe is me I'm just I just don't know God please her up for Youth Camp you don't that's not your high that's like a guy on drugs you know he just needs a high all the time then when he gets down he's facing his problems again please give me another high no no you come home stick it out you're gonna face troubles you're going to have your mind bottles you're going to have your things that you're going to go through can you say Amen so so don't be a chaser of things and this is what Jesus is saying because remember it's in this day that there's going to be many false anointed ones there's going to be many false Christ there's and I'm not saying Lord I hope you understand what I'm saying I'm for youth camps I'm for these things hello that's right but you're going to have to stick it out too just like I as a pastor like any of us adults you see your parents struggling you see your parents going through it but they're sticking it out well you got to do the same thing you got to get your roots in this message why because we need Faithful Men we need faithful women hello can't use people that just so soft that when the trial comes they just gonna blow away we need people that are faithful solid people that know how it is that when the Trials come you're like yeah I'm going through praise God why they got the fear of the Lord they got more respect and more reverence to God that when Satan comes and slaps them up the head I don't care what you do to me Satan I'm still serving the lord we'll see well this is what you say see if any man shall say unto you here's Christ here's an anointing there's a Revival over here there's a Revival there boy this church is in Revival look at what they're doing they're prospering amen believe it or not for this shall arise false Christ false anointed false teachers false prophets and they shall shoot signs and wonders great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they would deceive the very elect ain't that right see so this is what Satan's agenda is okay second Corinthians 11 13 for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works ain't that right so they they're I'm just reading Satan's agenda he started out I will be as God I will arise above the stars or sons of God I will do this thing and how's he doing it he said in his preachers out he's deceiving if so it's a great age of deception it's the greatest things to Prophet said that it would deceive the elect if it were possible ain't that right notice II Corinthians four and three if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the God of this world everybody say the God of this world well who is the God of this world the devil so he's accomplished it right he's accomplished it being the God of this world in other words God is object of worship he is the object of worship in this world whether they're at a basketball game or they're sitting in a church under their Creeds and dogmas under their tradition of men their he has become the god of this world blinded see the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the Glorious Gospel Light of the gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine in unto them ain't that right now notice what the prophet said the God of this world today the worship person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church as the church they worship Satan thinking that they're worshiping God through the church but it's the way Satan has done it all you say but wait a minute we preached the word but look back here at my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word to e first God hath said but see it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day isn't that right he's all got all kinds of knowledge of God that he'll teach you a little Bible lesson but when it comes to recognizing God for today uh he ain't gonna tell you that why he wants to be the god right he wants to be God see so he'll let you know all that Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know that wall that Moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day and then that was applied to another age he says see well see that's all he has to do is to get the plea people to believe it that way that's all see you cannot take one word away from it and add one word to it but that's what he does and the people ignorantly worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God can you say Amen see so they have a knowledge and by that knowledge they are worshiping but yet it hasn't brought the fear of the Lord thank God that we have a knowledge that surpasses all understanding of man can you say man do you love him I love him or we could go more and more but if the musicians will come see the knowledge that Satan has given the people has caused him to explain the realities of God today away they've done away with the supernatural they've done away you know uh uh with uh well they they just explain away the the operation of the gifts they don't believe in miracle and healing they don't believe in the genuine outpouring of the Holy Ghost anymore they don't believe in them things so what do they do they they go without an experience or brother Brown says Satan Works two ways he pushes the people into form of formality where there's no Spirit whatsoever they don't believe in healing Miracles they don't believe in gifts they don't believe in nothing so you just sit there feel your time out hear a well-educated preacher just ease your mind just treat it like a little old Seminary take your pen and paper and you just all write little things it's got to where the people don't even say man anymore see and then they do their little lesson and they go out not no enthusiasm in the church far be it from that now you can go to a rock concert and get enthused but don't go to church why because they have more experience out in the world than they do with God in the church well then brother Brown says then Satan works the other way too he'll push another people this way to where they become so radical in in worship and it's all based upon emotions now that's that's where we were in a lot I remember dad preaching for an Apostolic Church one time and they danced every service I have never seen my dad dance even to this day and but they would have him preach but finally the pastor came to him and said Brother Martin we love your preaching we just love it but we know she don't dance and we just kind of draw the line that if you if if you don't dance in the service then we we don't need your preaching but that was their that was their standard of a move of God what knowledge but then the prophet says that the bride is right in the middle of the road can you say man she's right in the in the middle of the road see and and so the world is gaining in knowledge but not coming to the knowledge of Truth and Jesus said in John 17 17 Thy word is truth right and brother Brown said Jesus is the word the truth made manifest so then another place John 14 6 Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life meant that right so the word is truth Jesus says I am the truth so then he was the word made flesh and every time the word becomes flesh that becomes the truth amen so we find that the Bible is God's truth and letter form right but but I want to say this as I close you don't just find the truth in letter form how many people today are reading from this Bible behind pulpits everywhere reading the scriptures and never coming to knowledge of Truth right because you don't find you just don't find truth in the letter of the word actually second Corinthians 3 6 Paul says the letter killeth but the spirit gives life so Millions churches have the Bible millions of sermons are being preached this morning from the Bible but they take those very scriptures and they misinterpret them to the people and they take these scriptures and explain God away the realities of God the life of God everything that God is they explain it away from the people and avert the people's attention from a reality of God to a lesson little Bible lesson to where God is so far from their minds and the world is ever present there [Music] you say man so the knowledge of God isn't getting to the people so then let's ask the question how do you respect something you don't know how can a person Reverend something they cannot understand how can people stand in awe of God when they don't see him in action and you say man so it goes back to the point they're not aware of his presence reading a Bible and yet they're not aware that he's here in this age because it took a prophet in this age to announce he's here just as much as it took John the Baptist to announce to that age he's here he's on Earth Behold the Lamb of God right Behold the Lamb of God aren't you glad for a message aren't you glad you've heard the voice you've been given a knowledge he's here he's on Earth and where is he in his bride she is him what a knowledge and it brings such a fear a reverence of respect oh God I want it more and more I want to be so conscious of him and that's what the message is to do is to bring us a conscience of him so when the devil tells you you're just some little insignificant nobody don't don't let the devil do that to you because all he's wanting to do is get your attention averted from the reality of God in you and get you on some idea to where you actually worshiping him Satan amen I hope it's helped you today thank you for your patience what song oh I'm [Music] oh you care Through Your Precious Blood I
