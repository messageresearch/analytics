[49:58] anoint the hearts to to receive the ears
[50:01] to hear we ask it father we commit this
[50:05] service into your hands now in Jesus
[50:08] Christ's name
[50:10] amen praise the Lord Ephesians the the
[50:15] fourth chapter and the fourth
[50:17] verse it says there is one body and one
[50:21] Spirit even as you are called in one
[50:24] hope of your
[50:26] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[50:30] one God and Father of all who is above
[50:33] all and through all and in you
[50:37] all but unto every one of us is given
[50:41] Grace
[50:42] unto uh according to the measure of the
[50:45] gift of Christ wherefore he saith when
[50:49] he ascended upon on high he led
[50:51] captivity captive and gave gifts unto to
[50:55] men amen you can have your seats this
[50:59] morning
[51:00] and um I want to
[51:04] continue on the thought the ministry of
[51:06] God in the body of Christ
[51:12] and um there is one body that represents
[51:16] the Lord Jesus Christ and and that
[51:22] body uh prays for his will to be done
[51:26] yes there's only one body that knows the
[51:29] will of God and only one body that can
[51:31] submit to the will of God and that's the
[51:35] body of Jesus
[51:36] Christ and I uh looked it up and the
[51:40] body is something that embodies or gives
[51:44] concrete reality to a thing amen and I I
[51:49] really like that because that's that's
[51:51] exactly what the body of Christ is it
[51:54] embodies God
[51:55] and gives the reality of God it's the
[51:58] only thing that can there's no
[51:59] denomination
[52:01] religion it's it's the body of Christ
[52:04] that gives concrete reality to him and
[52:09] so within this body God has placed
[52:13] gifts uh for the working of the ministry
[52:16] such as the fful ministry and and I
[52:20] believe that that that is important or
[52:24] God wouldn't have put that in his body
[52:28] and they are God's gift to the body and
[52:30] so brother Braham said you've got to
[52:32] approach God's gifts in the right way
[52:34] and that's with
[52:36] reverence and Ministry is Minister gifts
[52:40] they're gifts in the body five-fold uh
[52:43] five spiritual gifts that's
[52:44] predestinated for ordained of God to the
[52:46] church he said I know there's nine local
[52:49] gifts in the body but these are God's
[52:51] office gifts the office Apostle prophets
[52:55] teach teachers pastors evangelists and
[52:56] we must respect them if we expect
[52:59] something from God and so that is a gift
[53:03] but then we we find that God W has put
[53:07] gifted people within his body and each
[53:12] one of those gifts the prophet said are
[53:14] a Ministry of their own other place he
[53:18] said they they are gifts just like
[53:20] preaching is a gift like healing is a
[53:22] gift like other things are gifts these
[53:24] are gifts they are ministries of their
[53:27] own and each man is commanded to wait on
[53:30] his own
[53:31] Ministry and so I believe that this is
[53:34] what the Bible calls the ministry of the
[53:37] Saints Amen in other words it's it's
[53:41] it's something that we've all are called
[53:43] to do anyone that is in the body of
[53:46] Christ God put you in the body and and
[53:48] you have to remember God is the one that
[53:50] puts us in the body no man can put you
[53:52] in the body it has to be God only the
[53:55] day of Pentecost when he started his
[53:57] church the Bible says the Lord added to
[53:59] the church daily and so it has to be God
[54:02] and and God has to put the gift uh uh no
[54:06] man can lay hands on you to get you a
[54:09] gift uh um uh the only reason why we
[54:12] would lay hands on a a minister uh uh
[54:16] when he's starting to preach or whatever
[54:18] is not because to put the gift there but
[54:20] it's because we recognize that gift we
[54:23] recognize that there is a gift and we
[54:26] want God to use that gift and uh uh
[54:31] there and so uh um uh just I I as you
[54:36] know I I read a lot of quotes because I
[54:39] I want you to know where I'm getting
[54:40] this at but uh Christ sets members in
[54:44] the body the prophet said and he endows
[54:47] them with their Ministries and he puts G
[54:51] the gifts at her disposal amen and so
[54:56] then these nine spiritual gifts are in
[54:59] the body and I believe that they are in
[55:01] operation and they should be in
[55:03] operation because God would put them we
[55:06] know that God put them in the body but
[55:09] but it's never in the word where God
[55:11] took them out of the body and so uh Paul
[55:15] the prophet said set the church in order
[55:18] and taught the proper use of the gifts
[55:21] of the Spirit and confirmed that they
[55:24] were to remain in the church till Jesus
[55:27] came ain't that right so then then
[55:30] Ministry Ministry is meant to operate in
[55:34] the body of Christ no matter what it is
[55:36] whether it's the fifo ministry or that
[55:38] we know that there's G helps and
[55:40] governments in the body which are gifts
[55:43] we know as we talked about last Sunday
[55:45] that uh uh Paul had his helpers Aquilla
[55:50] Priscilla Mary and and so on and so
[55:53] forth that were helps to him and to the
[55:57] the the Gentile church and and so they
[55:59] were gifts uh that were put in the body
[56:03] of Christ at that time uh for for that
[56:06] that time and and so is it in this age
[56:09] that that we all have something to do
[56:12] not because necessarily that you're in
[56:15] the local body of the local church but
[56:18] you're in the body of Christ amen in the
[56:22] body of Christ and so but the ministry
[56:25] is is to fulfill the will of God and to
[56:28] carry out God's purpose and plan amen
[56:32] and I I think that's something that we
[56:34] we must uh it must resonate within us is
[56:37] that I am here to fulfill God's purpose
[56:41] and plan that's what I'm here for that's
[56:44] what you are here for and and so then
[56:47] then uh the ministry that God has given
[56:50] us in the body of Christ is not for us
[56:54] to to do with whatever we see fit uh uh
[56:58] and to use them in any way that we want
[57:02] uh but but it's it's it's to fulfill his
[57:06] plan and so then the prophet said you've
[57:09] got to surrender everybody say I've got
[57:11] to surrender you you've got to surrender
[57:14] soul body Spirit strength everything you
[57:17] are to the will of God Amen and and and
[57:21] uh to to become a prisoner to him and
[57:25] and so that's that's the that's what we
[57:28] are called to do amen is not to worry
[57:30] about our gifts per se but yield
[57:33] ourselves and become a prisoner to the
[57:36] will of God Amen and as we said so many
[57:39] times that Jesus taught us to pray amen
[57:42] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[57:46] earth as it is in heaven and and so
[57:49] every member that is part of the body of
[57:51] Christ that that is their desire that is
[57:54] their goal is God let your will be done
[57:57] in earth as it is in heaven amen you see
[58:02] we should never pray to change God's
[58:04] mind about things but rather we pray for
[58:07] him to change our mind ain't that right
[58:10] amen our mind and so God's mind doesn't
[58:13] need changing we're not here to tell God
[58:17] what to do and so the prophet would tell
[58:19] us prayer should be Lord change me to
[58:22] fit your word amen not let me change
[58:25] your mind but you change my mind you
[58:28] change my mind to your will and your
[58:31] will is written here in the book and so
[58:34] and Lord don't let me go till You've Got
[58:37] My Mind Set just like your mind and then
[58:40] when my mind is set like your mind then
[58:42] I'll believe every word that you've
[58:44] wrote can you say amen amen and so I I
[58:48] find that that so many people are
[58:51] discontented with who they are and what
[58:53] they have and they're they're just not
[58:56] satisfied and and so and this is where
[58:59] you get so many impersonations and or we
[59:02] we could even call it actors amen is is
[59:05] they're wanting to be something that God
[59:07] never called them to be they're wanting
[59:10] to do something that God's never called
[59:12] them to be and you know the Greek word
[59:15] for Pharisee is actor it's it's a
[59:17] someone that is pretending and and
[59:20] acting and trying to be something that
[59:23] they're not ain't that right and and to
[59:25] me that is a spirit of of the devil and
[59:29] and to to to bring in impersonation and
[59:32] I'll tell you why is because he's the
[59:34] first one that started it he's the one
[59:37] that said I'm going to be like God
[59:38] remember that amen God had created him
[59:42] uh uh to be the the top Angel amen next
[59:46] to God and and and he didn't want that
[59:49] position he was discontent with that and
[59:52] and so he wanted to be like God he
[59:54] wanted to have have a kingdom like God
[59:55] he wanted to be a Creator like God he he
[59:58] wanted to be worshiped like God and and
[1:00:01] so uh uh he's he he he sets out to be
[1:00:04] God to act like God to look like God
[1:00:07] everything is is to be like God he's not
[1:00:11] content with what God had made him a
[1:00:14] ain't that right amen and so uh uh then
[1:00:18] he becomes competitive with God Amen and
[1:00:22] and instead of rejoicing like like the
[1:00:24] other angels and and just saying
[1:00:27] satisfied in his position now he becomes
[1:00:29] the competitor amen with God ain't that
[1:00:33] right amen so he's not satisfied with
[1:00:35] the will of God he wasn't satisfied with
[1:00:38] the way God created his Eden he wasn't
[1:00:40] satisfied a man with God uh the way God
[1:00:44] had his son and and and and and and his
[1:00:47] his uh daughter and and uh Adam's wife
[1:00:51] and and these things and he thought he
[1:00:52] could he he could do better and so then
[1:00:55] then we can understand that he's the one
[1:00:58] that has this
[1:00:59] discontentment amen and and and so then
[1:01:02] we see that he's he causes men and women
[1:01:05] amen not to be satisfied with who they
[1:01:08] are look look where we're at today men
[1:01:10] ain't satisfied with being a man they
[1:01:12] want to be a woman woman is not
[1:01:14] satisfied with god making them the way
[1:01:16] they are they want to be a man and and
[1:01:19] and it started with with women cutting
[1:01:21] their hair then wearing their britches
[1:01:23] and and and things like that and they
[1:01:25] were trying to cross over it was a
[1:01:27] spirit slowly bringing women Crossing
[1:01:30] them over and then men started having
[1:01:32] their long hair and and and and acting
[1:01:34] like a a girl and their bangs remember
[1:01:37] brother Bram talked about the the the
[1:01:39] haircuts with the bangs and all that he
[1:01:41] called them sissies and and all that it
[1:01:43] was a slow crossover Amen to where we
[1:01:46] are today that did you realize that that
[1:01:50] uh uh in the beauty pageant uh my wife
[1:01:53] was telling me the uh Miss Universe or
[1:01:56] whatever that they had that a man
[1:01:58] transgender won that thing over all them
[1:02:01] women amen and she showed me a picture
[1:02:04] of of of of the individual that want it
[1:02:06] that you know and you couldn't tell it
[1:02:08] was a man at all it it was a you know
[1:02:12] and and but they won that thing over all
[1:02:15] the women now you you think of that it's
[1:02:18] because Satan has put it in the minds
[1:02:21] because this is his eating you
[1:02:22] understand what I'm saying so everything
[1:02:24] is becoming a crossover it's it's so
[1:02:27] much discontentment so much uh uh uh
[1:02:31] confusion and dis satisfying and and all
[1:02:34] of these things well there should be no
[1:02:36] competition in the church either can you
[1:02:40] say amen God doesn't want competition in
[1:02:43] the church and and and we shouldn't put
[1:02:45] ourselves one against the other I
[1:02:48] thought of like Paul where he says in 1
[1:02:50] Corinthians 12 and 15 if the foot shall
[1:02:53] say well well because I'm not the hand I
[1:02:55] am not the body is it therefore not of
[1:02:58] the body if the ear shall say well
[1:03:01] because I'm not the eye I'm not the body
[1:03:04] see or of the body is it therefore not
[1:03:07] of the body in other words does that
[1:03:09] change God Amen I know they want us that
[1:03:12] you know uh if you call a transgender
[1:03:15] you know a man that has now switched
[1:03:17] over to try to be a woman I will not
[1:03:19] call that person a woman you know uh uh
[1:03:22] I I'll say yes sir yes sir you know and
[1:03:25] and and they get mad about that you know
[1:03:28] but it doesn't matter if they if if if
[1:03:30] they had us all saying yes ma'am yes
[1:03:33] ma'am she you know all these things and
[1:03:35] and all that but to God is still a man
[1:03:37] you you can never change that and that's
[1:03:39] one uh if God has called you to be
[1:03:43] something you you can do whatever you
[1:03:45] want to and switch and and and and do
[1:03:48] something else but God will never change
[1:03:51] his mind about what he's called you to
[1:03:54] be if he called you to be the foot be
[1:03:56] the foot amen and you stand there trying
[1:03:58] to be the hand well you can't be the
[1:04:00] hand in God's eyes it won't work God
[1:04:04] will never change his mind so he says if
[1:04:07] the whole body were an eye then where
[1:04:09] were the hearing if the whole were
[1:04:11] hearing where would the smelling see but
[1:04:14] now hath God set the members every one
[1:04:18] of them in the body as it hath pleased
[1:04:21] us no it didn't say that did it
[1:04:24] as it as please sea Martin oh God please
[1:04:27] set me where I want to be please put me
[1:04:29] in a Hawaii man let me be the Evangelist
[1:04:31] in the Bahamas oh God please please
[1:04:33] please please and and he so he says okay
[1:04:36] Sean you you're you're my bright one you
[1:04:38] know and so I'm going to place you there
[1:04:40] but that's not the way it worked he set
[1:04:42] Shawn Martin in the body as it pleased
[1:04:45] him and and he set every one of us as it
[1:04:49] pleased him can you say amen and then he
[1:04:52] gives us gifts not not to work the way
[1:04:55] we want to work but as it has pleased
[1:04:58] him so then our prayer must be father
[1:05:02] thy will be
[1:05:04] done ain't that right so now brother Bri
[1:05:08] says see when you get to a place that
[1:05:10] you're willing to be nothing that's
[1:05:12] right then God can make something out of
[1:05:15] you but as long as you're trying to be
[1:05:18] big and a lot of Flowery advertising and
[1:05:22] all this stuff and going on in my
[1:05:25] opinion something has
[1:05:28] happened see so we want to become a
[1:05:31] nobody and he said see God will take
[1:05:34] something that there's nothing to and
[1:05:37] make something out of it and it proves
[1:05:40] that he is God so no matter how
[1:05:43] insignificant you feel stay that way no
[1:05:47] matter how of nothing you might seem to
[1:05:50] be stay that way because then God God
[1:05:54] can use you and it proves that he's God
[1:05:58] can you say Amen not that we offer
[1:06:01] talents not that we offer say God now if
[1:06:03] you'll just choose me I got a lot to
[1:06:05] offer here we have nothing to offer and
[1:06:08] we don't want to bring to God everything
[1:06:10] that we have we have nothing in his
[1:06:12] sight if we have anything it's because
[1:06:15] we built it up in our own
[1:06:19] mind sir Philippians
[1:06:23] 2:7 says that Jesus made no of no
[1:06:27] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:06:29] a servant what a difference that is
[1:06:32] between him and and and and
[1:06:35] Mankind brother brah says the man that
[1:06:38] made an artificial artificial tooth made
[1:06:41] a reputation for himself but the one who
[1:06:43] made the real tooth made of himself no
[1:06:46] reputation the man that made an
[1:06:48] artificial arm made a reputation for
[1:06:50] himself but the man who made the real
[1:06:51] arm made of himself no reput a see the
[1:06:55] Way Up Is Down always remember that be
[1:06:57] humble be sweet and kind be creative and
[1:07:00] let Christ be in you ain't that right so
[1:07:04] Jesus Took the lowest job that there was
[1:07:06] on on Earth and that was washing the
[1:07:09] feet of the people see but he was there
[1:07:12] everybody say he was there to do the
[1:07:15] father's will he could have called
[1:07:17] Legions of angels to come down to rescue
[1:07:19] him but he was there to do the father's
[1:07:22] will a ain't that right
[1:07:24] amen he he he had come to a point in his
[1:07:27] life that he was handled by men in any
[1:07:30] way they wanted to handle him they spit
[1:07:32] upon him they hit him they bruised him
[1:07:35] they beat him they done whatever they
[1:07:37] want to he was in their hands but he was
[1:07:40] there to do the father's will ain't that
[1:07:43] right and so there is a will of the
[1:07:47] father for the supernatural or spiritual
[1:07:51] body of Christ today a man there is a
[1:07:54] will of the father for uh a woman as to
[1:07:58] how she is supposed to act and how she
[1:08:00] is supposed to dress and the role that
[1:08:03] she is to play in the home there is the
[1:08:05] will of the father for a man amen as to
[1:08:08] how he should act and conduct himself
[1:08:11] there's the will of the father for every
[1:08:13] church and for every gift and and and
[1:08:16] and Ministry within the body of Christ
[1:08:19] ain't that right and I want to say it
[1:08:21] this way the church should not compete
[1:08:23] against the world Amen uh uh God put the
[1:08:27] church the way they are supposed to be
[1:08:29] and the world is what they are to be
[1:08:31] ain't that right and there should not be
[1:08:33] any competition and this is what even
[1:08:35] brother brandham talked about how
[1:08:37] preachers are becoming Hollywood
[1:08:38] preachers and everything in the church
[1:08:40] becoming Hollywood and and and and all
[1:08:43] of these things God did not call us to
[1:08:46] be
[1:08:48] entertainers can you say man God didn't
[1:08:51] call us to be entertainers God called us
[1:08:54] to be a Powerhouse for his Spirit to
[1:08:56] come into and deliver people to set
[1:08:59] people
[1:09:00] free ain't that
[1:09:03] right Christian sisters shouldn't try to
[1:09:06] compete against the women of the
[1:09:08] world and brothers we should not make
[1:09:10] our wives feel that they have to compete
[1:09:14] with these so-called beauty queens in
[1:09:16] order to get our attention on can you
[1:09:19] say amen and sisters you shouldn't make
[1:09:22] your husband feel as though he has to
[1:09:24] conform to the men of the world for him
[1:09:26] to be feel like he's a
[1:09:29] man ain't that right amen see and so so
[1:09:34] in the Old Testament God's will was for
[1:09:37] Israel to come out of Egypt and go into
[1:09:40] the promised land that that was that was
[1:09:42] the goal uh uh of of of God and so as we
[1:09:47] know brother brandom told us there's two
[1:09:49] parts of redemption the first one is the
[1:09:51] coming out of and second part is going
[1:09:55] into the coming out was a separation of
[1:09:58] the believer uh God's Promised Land
[1:10:01] people separating them from the
[1:10:04] unbeliever separating their habits and
[1:10:07] and these things and he was going to
[1:10:09] deal with Israel now once he gets them
[1:10:11] separated ain't that right going to take
[1:10:13] them into their own Promised Land Amen
[1:10:16] to where they could be a people of of
[1:10:19] and govern and and all of these things
[1:10:21] as as a nation and so brother Brown says
[1:10:24] to be sure that they would not be mixed
[1:10:27] up in some kind of an ism what did he do
[1:10:31] he sent them a prophet he sent a prophet
[1:10:35] to them Moses with a message identifying
[1:10:40] God's word what was Moses's message to
[1:10:43] identify God's word and then to identify
[1:10:48] Moses he sent a pillar of fire that hung
[1:10:51] over him and you say Amen am and notice
[1:10:55] and then to give them a perfect
[1:10:58] Assurance he required a token see and so
[1:11:02] it's a perfect type of the church today
[1:11:05] we know that that we have we've been
[1:11:09] called out can you say amen amen
[1:11:12] Revelations 18 and4 amen which is is is
[1:11:16] applies to this age I heard another
[1:11:19] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:11:21] my people that you be not part partakers
[1:11:24] of her sins and and that you receive not
[1:11:27] of her plagues well what are we coming
[1:11:29] out of we're coming out of the world
[1:11:31] we're coming out of Babylon we're coming
[1:11:32] out of confusion and and chaos and all
[1:11:35] the mixup and all of these things God C
[1:11:39] us out of that Amen to be a separated
[1:11:43] people can you say amen amen now but our
[1:11:47] coming our coming has to out has to be
[1:11:50] scriptural everything the thing that
[1:11:52] calls us out has to be be scriptural it
[1:11:54] has to fit in line with scripture can
[1:11:56] you say amen amen we believe that we're
[1:11:59] in that Third Exodus and all that so
[1:12:01] then we could not come out Israel could
[1:12:03] not come out except God sent them a
[1:12:06] prophet and we could not come out except
[1:12:09] God would send us a prophet ain't that
[1:12:12] right thank God for a prophet in this
[1:12:14] day amen you can never overemphasize the
[1:12:17] message of the hour amen because that's
[1:12:20] the only way that you can come out I
[1:12:22] don't care if they were smart preacher I
[1:12:24] don't care how good they could take this
[1:12:26] Bible and explain it it had to take a
[1:12:29] prophet to call us out can you say amen
[1:12:33] and then that Prophet would have to have
[1:12:35] a message that identified God's word to
[1:12:38] us amen for the age that we're living in
[1:12:41] you know I I I wonder why that you we
[1:12:44] hear uh uh often and and it's becoming
[1:12:47] seems to becoming more uh uh prominent
[1:12:50] and and uh uh of ministers you know uh
[1:12:54] um uh telling us to get back to the
[1:12:57] Bible and and they they seem to think
[1:13:00] that we study the message more than we
[1:13:02] do the Bible and we know more about the
[1:13:04] message than we do the Bible and and all
[1:13:06] these things but you know I I personally
[1:13:09] believe if I study the message then I
[1:13:11] understand the Bible I I don't think
[1:13:14] that Moses took the people away from
[1:13:16] God's word but his message identified
[1:13:19] the word for their day and I think our
[1:13:22] prophet in coming bringing us out
[1:13:24] identified the scriptures in this word
[1:13:27] for our day and age we've had the Bible
[1:13:30] for years but we could never understand
[1:13:32] this Bible there's a lot of pulpits say
[1:13:35] men standing behind the pulpits
[1:13:36] preaching this Bible without an
[1:13:39] understanding of this word amen that God
[1:13:41] would send us a prophet Amen to separate
[1:13:44] us from Babylon to separate us from the
[1:13:47] confusion that we could be identified
[1:13:51] with the word of God can you say amen
[1:13:55] amen see so the prophet's message does
[1:13:57] not take us further away from the word
[1:14:00] but uh uh uh it identifies the word of
[1:14:04] God but then to identify the prophet now
[1:14:08] then God would send a pillar of fire can
[1:14:11] you say Amen to identify him there's a
[1:14:15] lot of false prophets in the land
[1:14:17] there's a lot of prophets people saying
[1:14:19] that they're prophets and and Men rising
[1:14:21] up and all that and still to this day
[1:14:23] they're doing these things and and and
[1:14:25] I'll be honest can can can they uh can
[1:14:28] they discern yes they can they you know
[1:14:31] it's been witnessed that they've done it
[1:14:32] you know in the Pentecostal Rim uh uh uh
[1:14:36] there were so-called prophets and things
[1:14:38] that uh that come to our church and
[1:14:40] they'd call you out they'd discern you
[1:14:42] now I'm going to be honest it wasn't all
[1:14:44] accurate amen but we didn't mind all
[1:14:46] that you know if he called us out and if
[1:14:48] it was accurate then he had to be a
[1:14:49] prophet you know and there was no
[1:14:51] questions uh you know to to whether you
[1:14:54] know well he missed that one five times
[1:14:55] but he got that one right you know uh uh
[1:14:58] and all these things but but but see we
[1:15:00] it was it was a mass confusion but but
[1:15:03] when God would have his picture taken
[1:15:06] with that man it it was the same to
[1:15:10] Israel as it is to us can you say amen
[1:15:13] God identifying him you know as I said
[1:15:16] the other night God has never had his
[1:15:18] picture taken with any man outside of
[1:15:21] brother Brandon amen and you will never
[1:15:24] find it you you'll never find it and and
[1:15:28] uh uh he he hasn't had his picture taken
[1:15:31] with Shawn Martin he hasn't had his
[1:15:33] picture taken with brother Wayne Lawson
[1:15:36] he hadn't had his picture taken with
[1:15:37] brother Barry coffee hadn't had his
[1:15:39] picture taken with brother Ron Spencer
[1:15:41] Andrew Spencer brother Tim PR you know
[1:15:44] brother Ray Ericson brother W Martin
[1:15:46] brother SE Jonathan Martin hadn't had
[1:15:48] his picture taken with brother Terry
[1:15:50] Horn brother Amos you know he's he's not
[1:15:52] had his picture taken with Brother
[1:15:54] Joseph brandham he has not had his
[1:15:56] picture taken with anything like that
[1:15:58] ain't that right I'm not saying that the
[1:16:00] pillar of fire ain't with these brothers
[1:16:02] and and and these things uh uh uh but
[1:16:05] but I will tell you if you believe the
[1:16:07] message the pillar fire is with you as
[1:16:09] well amen I I just believe that but
[1:16:12] there's only one that he's had his
[1:16:13] picture taken and and that ain't by
[1:16:15] accident and and it was taken by God's
[1:16:18] own enemy that was trying to prove
[1:16:20] brother Brandon was a fraud and that is
[1:16:23] healing was a fraud and all of that and
[1:16:26] remember the that man that stuck his
[1:16:27] fist be under under FF Bosworth's nose
[1:16:31] and none of them come out none of them
[1:16:33] they they all turned out blank except
[1:16:35] that picture right there amen because
[1:16:38] God was sending a message to you and I
[1:16:40] amen and the further we get away from
[1:16:42] the prophet uh of the years amen it's
[1:16:45] been what 60 years or so since the
[1:16:47] prophet's been gone we've had more
[1:16:49] people rise up and discount this message
[1:16:52] and act like this message ain't nothing
[1:16:54] and and and and and trying to tell us
[1:16:57] don't read the quotes reading the quotes
[1:16:58] too much and and and pick brother
[1:17:00] Brandon to aart and this is his opinion
[1:17:03] and that's his and all of that amen and
[1:17:05] I thank God that we still have a picture
[1:17:08] that we can look to and say God did it
[1:17:10] God backed that man up and if God can
[1:17:12] back that man up I'm okay with believing
[1:17:15] what he
[1:17:17] said can you say amen amen now the
[1:17:20] prophet said the angel of the Lord
[1:17:22] accompanies the message
[1:17:25] always do you believe that amen see so
[1:17:29] God had his picture taken with brother
[1:17:31] Brandon to identify him as being the
[1:17:34] prophet that he sent amen yes sir if God
[1:17:38] just wanted his picture taken he could
[1:17:40] have just had a photographer to take a
[1:17:41] picture of the of the room and he would
[1:17:44] make sure he was in that camera amen he
[1:17:46] could have had his picture taken you
[1:17:48] know uh uh uh uh 20 ft above brother
[1:17:51] Brandon's head but he made sure that he
[1:17:52] was in the picture of that picture right
[1:17:55] there with brother brandham amen so that
[1:17:57] he would identify and so therefore God's
[1:18:01] elect comes out of her out of the the
[1:18:04] world out of out of Babylon out of all
[1:18:07] this by this
[1:18:10] message and you say amen and you know
[1:18:13] what to see that Pillar of Fire is a
[1:18:16] comfort to the
[1:18:17] Believers yes sir the prophet said
[1:18:20] notice he says he was a comfort to
[1:18:23] Israel when they could look up and see
[1:18:25] the pillar of fire and hear the prophet
[1:18:27] speak the words that was true and God
[1:18:30] Vindicated that was their
[1:18:35] comfort
[1:18:37] Hallelujah so we don't need movies to
[1:18:39] comfort us we don't need comedians to
[1:18:42] comfort us we don't need uh uh the
[1:18:45] seminaries to comfort us we don't need
[1:18:47] the fancy choirs to comfort us we don't
[1:18:50] need money to be our comfort that is
[1:18:52] comfort enough for God's children
[1:18:54] because we know the the the the trouble
[1:18:56] is coming we know tribulation is coming
[1:18:59] we know that we're coming into more of a
[1:19:01] Sodom and gomorah but we're comforted by
[1:19:03] one thing we see the pillar of fire amen
[1:19:06] and we hear the words of a prophet can
[1:19:08] you say Amen yes sir he says it was a
[1:19:12] consolation you knew that it was right
[1:19:16] you was at peace see we at peace with
[1:19:19] God through our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:19:21] that Pillar of Fire
[1:19:23] was the
[1:19:24] consolation can you say Amen now notice
[1:19:28] so he's bringing us out bringing us out
[1:19:30] but why why has he brought us out and
[1:19:32] he's put us into now brother Braham said
[1:19:36] see he's got one got his Oneness his
[1:19:39] true Oneness showing himself among them
[1:19:42] out of every denomination bringing his
[1:19:45] elect together from all kinds of
[1:19:46] churches from everywhere bringing out
[1:19:49] his children falling right in line with
[1:19:53] his
[1:19:54] word hallelujah so there's no
[1:19:57] discontentment God would send a
[1:20:01] prophet and confirm him with a pillar of
[1:20:04] fire to be our comfort yes sir amen so
[1:20:08] we won't be
[1:20:10] dissatisfied so we won't be
[1:20:12] discontent we know that he's bringing us
[1:20:14] together that we could fall right in
[1:20:16] line with his word which is his
[1:20:20] will ain't that right notice he's
[1:20:23] calling his elected together in Oneness
[1:20:26] with himself with the same kind of
[1:20:29] ministry he
[1:20:32] had oh do you love him and he says what
[1:20:35] has he done he has placed them with a
[1:20:38] true teacher true prophets who stay with
[1:20:43] his word the Bible so the prophet never
[1:20:47] strayed from the word of God right amen
[1:20:51] ain't that right
[1:20:53] so now the coming into was the second
[1:20:56] part of
[1:20:57] redemption but notice God didn't just
[1:21:00] bring them into the land and say all
[1:21:02] right have at it kind of like the
[1:21:05] Oklahoma Land
[1:21:07] Rush if you've ever read that you know
[1:21:11] the the government allotted Parcels of
[1:21:14] land and they you know drove Stakes down
[1:21:17] in there so then they had a land run
[1:21:20] everybody lined up on a certain day
[1:21:23] and they they they gave the goal and
[1:21:26] everybody got on their teams of horses
[1:21:28] and whatever they had walking or or just
[1:21:30] to riding a horse and they took off and
[1:21:32] they trying to get the the the piece of
[1:21:34] property that they wanted well God
[1:21:37] doesn't bring us into the body and then
[1:21:39] say
[1:21:41] okay go for
[1:21:44] it and we're just
[1:21:47] a you know bang
[1:21:50] bang amen I got here first oh no you
[1:21:55] didn't
[1:21:56] no and he didn't do that to
[1:22:00] Israel but he brought them in by a
[1:22:03] prophet Lord and that Prophet by divine
[1:22:06] revelation knew where each one
[1:22:09] belonged ain't that right see he had
[1:22:12] predestinated each tribe to a place see
[1:22:16] and the prophet said Ruben meant sheep
[1:22:17] herder Gad meant cattle raiser Ephraim
[1:22:20] meant corn raiser so if you switch to up
[1:22:22] then they'd be totally out of
[1:22:24] place ain't that right see and so there
[1:22:27] had to be a prophetic Ministry to
[1:22:29] positionally place them in the land and
[1:22:33] the prophet said by spiritual
[1:22:34] discernment Joshua see amen uh the new
[1:22:37] leader by spiritual discernment placed
[1:22:39] each one where he belonged and divided
[1:22:41] the land just exactly he said the
[1:22:44] trouble today when we are coming to our
[1:22:46] Promised Land God wants to raise uh
[1:22:49] sheep like Ephraim see he wants to raise
[1:22:52] something like the other and every man
[1:22:55] wants to be the same see let God give
[1:22:57] one man a gift of healing and every man
[1:23:00] wants to a gift of healing Ephraim and
[1:23:02] Gad all of them see wants to mix all up
[1:23:05] and come as one but we are divided in
[1:23:08] our
[1:23:09] positions can you say Amen so God's
[1:23:12] Oneness doesn't mean that we're all
[1:23:14] preachers God's Oneness doesn't mean
[1:23:16] that we're all singers God's Oneness
[1:23:18] does not mean that we're all
[1:23:23] ain't that right see so in our position
[1:23:26] we're
[1:23:29] divided that's right he said see all
[1:23:32] don't have the gift of wisdom all don't
[1:23:34] prophesy all don't speak in tongues all
[1:23:37] are not prophets but God has set in the
[1:23:40] church some that prophesy some that
[1:23:42] speak with tongues see and we want to
[1:23:45] make them all speaking in tongues how
[1:23:47] confusion is that see see he says then
[1:23:50] you get you can get nowhere why the
[1:23:52] Philistines would take them over in a
[1:23:55] little bit but when each Man by a by a
[1:23:58] leader see separated them by spiritual
[1:24:02] discernment and placed them into the
[1:24:05] body where they remained and become the
[1:24:07] cream of the earth God give us a Joshua
[1:24:12] he says God give us back a Joshua
[1:24:15] that'll hold the commission with the
[1:24:17] word aren't you glad we've had our
[1:24:20] Joshua yes sir see so Joshua in Hebrew
[1:24:24] means Savior and represents the promised
[1:24:27] end time leader to take the church over
[1:24:31] and Caleb represents the True Believer
[1:24:34] who stayed with Joshua so how many
[1:24:36] calebs do we have hallelujah amen there
[1:24:40] there's some calebs that are going to
[1:24:42] stay with this
[1:24:44] message yes sir now every every member
[1:24:49] in the body is important
[1:24:54] Prophet said many times we Overlook the
[1:24:57] the value of little
[1:25:01] things and he say sometimes a minister
[1:25:04] that's got just a little group of people
[1:25:05] back in some Mission he feels like maybe
[1:25:08] well I I can't be a Billy Graham or an
[1:25:10] or Robert so I'm not very much in the
[1:25:13] picture but notice what he
[1:25:16] says but he doesn't realize that he's
[1:25:19] just as important right as Billy grandar
[1:25:22] Roberts if everybody say if he's in the
[1:25:26] will of God doing his
[1:25:30] place when a person is in the will of
[1:25:33] God doing his place he's just as
[1:25:37] important
[1:25:41] amen see another place he says God has
[1:25:44] made you a place can you say that with
[1:25:46] me God has made me a
[1:25:48] place aren't you glad for that God knew
[1:25:52] you coming in the body so he
[1:25:53] predestinated you a place he made you a
[1:25:56] place
[1:25:58] Lord don't try to take somebody else's
[1:26:01] place that's carnal
[1:26:03] impersonations and that shows that
[1:26:05] there's something wrong with you amen
[1:26:08] see when we realize our position in
[1:26:10] Christ then abide in
[1:26:13] that if it's just a little housewife
[1:26:16] stay right there right there that's what
[1:26:19] God wants you to do just be what you
[1:26:24] are don't don't
[1:26:27] complain God help us not to complain
[1:26:30] amen no matter how hard the task may be
[1:26:33] if God's put you there stay there and
[1:26:35] don't complain am yes sir don't complain
[1:26:38] to be a
[1:26:39] housewife don't complain that you have
[1:26:41] to get out and go work for your your
[1:26:44] husbands don't complain about your
[1:26:46] children yeah that's right everybody's
[1:26:49] complaining it seem like they're unhappy
[1:26:52] that's right unhappy preachers
[1:26:55] unhappy people unhappy musicians unhappy
[1:27:00] everybody just unhappy unhappy husbands
[1:27:04] unhappy fathers unhappy
[1:27:08] mothers and then they feel like they
[1:27:10] deserve
[1:27:13] something we've all got our reward
[1:27:18] coming just stay in your position amen
[1:27:23] amen can you say amen
[1:27:25] amen you might say well I don't know
[1:27:27] what God wants me to
[1:27:29] do then the best answer I could get to
[1:27:32] you is stay in his presence
[1:27:35] then get your nose out television get
[1:27:38] your nose out of the comics get your
[1:27:40] nose off YouTube Facebook and WhatsApp
[1:27:43] and wherever else I don't know all them
[1:27:45] things just say get your nose out of
[1:27:48] social
[1:27:49] media get in the presence of God
[1:27:53] get your mind off of everything else
[1:27:56] quit entertaining all this other stuff
[1:27:58] get into the presence of God can you say
[1:28:01] Amen the prophet said God Moses knew
[1:28:04] more about the will of God for his life
[1:28:07] in five minutes in the presence of God
[1:28:10] than he did a 40 years of
[1:28:14] training right and what the church needs
[1:28:17] tonight is not some fantastic not some
[1:28:20] new denomination but to be be alone with
[1:28:25] God ain't that right young people be
[1:28:27] alone with God get alone with God that's
[1:28:30] right parents get along with God
[1:28:32] preachers get along with God every one
[1:28:33] of us get along with
[1:28:36] God all selfishness all malice all fear
[1:28:39] all unbelief just Fades away and God
[1:28:41] becomes
[1:28:44] preeminent
[1:28:46] that's now if you notice it's it's not
[1:28:49] having gifts that
[1:28:51] counts
[1:28:52] and it's not being anointed that
[1:28:56] counts but it's being in the body that
[1:29:00] counts because a man can have a gift and
[1:29:02] be anointed and yet not be in the body
[1:29:04] of Christ
[1:29:06] true that's true and when he isn't in
[1:29:09] the body of Christ and he isn't under
[1:29:11] the headship of Christ
[1:29:13] that's I said you know last Sunday that
[1:29:16] a a gift can be used by the carnal
[1:29:20] mind which is is dangerous when it's
[1:29:22] used by a carnal mind because it's a
[1:29:25] carnal nature amen
[1:29:27] amen and the carnal mind is not subject
[1:29:30] this is what Paul said in Romans is the
[1:29:32] carnal mind is not subject to the law or
[1:29:34] word of God and neither indeed can
[1:29:37] be so he can hold an office in the
[1:29:40] church he can he can be used in the
[1:29:42] church in in whatever and be Anointed
[1:29:45] with it that if he's not a part of the
[1:29:48] body and he's operating it by a carnal
[1:29:51] mind he will never become subject to the
[1:29:53] will of God the word of
[1:29:56] God Amen ain't that
[1:29:59] right see so therefore the colel man
[1:30:02] uses the gift to edify himself to point
[1:30:05] people to himself look what a job I'm
[1:30:07] doing look what I'm I'm capable of hello
[1:30:10] it's
[1:30:11] me amen right that's right brother BR
[1:30:14] said you know a man can prophesy and it
[1:30:17] comes out true you know and if he's not
[1:30:19] carefully he go well see I'm the one
[1:30:20] that prophesied that oh my I say that
[1:30:23] very humbly
[1:30:26] oh brother prach but what happen he
[1:30:30] tries to establish his own name before
[1:30:32] the people right see so the individual
[1:30:35] may be anointed but not anointed to the
[1:30:37] word amen and that's that's what the
[1:30:40] prophet said that that that people are
[1:30:42] being anointed but they're not anointed
[1:30:43] to the
[1:30:44] word so it's coming to a time where now
[1:30:48] notice what he says this is important
[1:30:50] it's coming to A time where
[1:30:52] impersonations and carnal thinking is
[1:30:55] going to be circumcised from the real
[1:30:57] true Body of Christ right praise the
[1:30:59] carnal minds and the impersonators are
[1:31:01] going to be cut away from the body of
[1:31:04] Christ talking about a separation it's
[1:31:07] going on can you say amen and he's going
[1:31:11] to have a body that's pure everybody say
[1:31:14] pure holy and filled with his spirit
[1:31:18] with his walking in his spirit and doing
[1:31:22] the works that he
[1:31:23] did be faithful to
[1:31:28] that amen ain't that right that's what
[1:31:30] he said be faithful to that another
[1:31:33] place he says listen to your
[1:31:37] gifts and keep them in the
[1:31:42] Bible don't take a substitute when the
[1:31:45] skies are full of the real
[1:31:47] ones let's keep the real ones let's keep
[1:31:50] the real or don't have any at all
[1:31:54] amen can you say Amen see to the to the
[1:31:58] to the the bride of Christ in this day
[1:32:00] it doesn't matter what kind of gift a
[1:32:02] man has that's not too
[1:32:05] impressive as I've said before we're not
[1:32:07] in the Pentecostal age where we were all
[1:32:10] gullible right and vulnerable yeah if a
[1:32:14] man claimed to be a prophet man you
[1:32:16] talking about we just gushed all over
[1:32:18] him if a man had a certain gift we just
[1:32:22] gushed all over him if a man could
[1:32:25] preach he could preach the house down we
[1:32:27] just gushed all over him I mean it was
[1:32:31] just come on bro and we were so
[1:32:34] vulnerable yeah right you could walk in
[1:32:38] no there ain't no telling how many
[1:32:39] people of ministers came in our day and
[1:32:42] split CH our
[1:32:43] church cuz people dissatisfied with the
[1:32:46] pastor so you get a new face a new
[1:32:48] ministry a new whatever hum Danger
[1:32:52] yeah sweet talking and this and that
[1:32:56] understanding the gripes of the people
[1:32:57] and this and this and that and
[1:33:00] every after him and before you know it
[1:33:02] he's starting a church some down the
[1:33:05] road people were vulnerable but
[1:33:08] Believers aren't
[1:33:10] vulnerable we keep the gifts in the
[1:33:13] word can you say Amen where's this thing
[1:33:16] going to lead us that's right amen
[1:33:18] where's it going to take
[1:33:20] us Yello
[1:33:23] sir amen so let's keep the real or don't
[1:33:27] have any at all now this body of Christ
[1:33:30] I hope this is okay this morning but the
[1:33:32] body of Christ has a head as we know and
[1:33:35] the prophet says the head guides the
[1:33:37] body take your head off and see how far
[1:33:41] you
[1:33:42] go come on well you go somewhere in the
[1:33:46] unknown but your body sure won't
[1:33:49] cooperate amen so it's the intelligence
[1:33:52] that controls every movement of the
[1:33:55] body there isn't a preacher outside or
[1:33:58] inside this message that's the head of
[1:34:00] the
[1:34:01] body on do you know that yes sir amen
[1:34:04] that's right and as much as I love
[1:34:05] brother brandom and believe that he was
[1:34:06] a word Prophet he's not the head of the
[1:34:08] body right brother Joseph brandham ain't
[1:34:12] the head of the body John Martin ain't
[1:34:14] the head of the body we could go
[1:34:16] preacher after preacher after preacher
[1:34:17] in the message outside the message
[1:34:19] they're not the head of the body amen
[1:34:21] and you say amen that's right Colossians
[1:34:24] 1:18 Christ he is the head of the body
[1:34:27] the church amen ain't that right who is
[1:34:29] the beginning and the firstborn from the
[1:34:31] dead and that in all things everybody
[1:34:33] say in all things he might have the
[1:34:37] preeminence that in all things he might
[1:34:39] have the
[1:34:41] preeminence he wants preeminence over
[1:34:43] the fivefold ministry he wants
[1:34:44] preeminence over the church he wants
[1:34:46] preeminence over the musicians he wants
[1:34:48] preeminence over the deacons he wants
[1:34:50] preeminence over for whatever Ministry
[1:34:52] he's given you he's the head of the body
[1:34:55] and he wants the
[1:34:58] preeminence and when does he get
[1:35:00] preeminence when he falls upon your
[1:35:01] spirit
[1:35:03] nope when he gets into your
[1:35:07] soul amen then he's able to control
[1:35:09] every part of
[1:35:12] you that's right hallelu
[1:35:16] so
[1:35:18] Christ is the head of the church and as
[1:35:21] the Prophet would tell us over and over
[1:35:23] he is the word so then the word is our
[1:35:28] headship and the word comes to AET
[1:35:35] Prophet
[1:35:37] Amen brother Brandon made mistakes one
[1:35:40] thing I loved about him is he was very
[1:35:43] transparent amen and willing to confess
[1:35:45] them right that's right but that doesn't
[1:35:47] mean that this message is
[1:35:50] wrong hello amen people want to pick
[1:35:54] flaws in the message then they they pick
[1:35:56] him apart pick him apart all you want to
[1:36:00] but you can't pick the message
[1:36:02] apart the message is real the message is
[1:36:06] our
[1:36:08] headship God didn't vindicate that man
[1:36:11] in all of his faults and failures that's
[1:36:13] not why God done that he had a message
[1:36:16] to
[1:36:17] bring that's right can you say Amen so
[1:36:20] as they say that you know that brings
[1:36:22] idolatry when you have that picture no
[1:36:23] it doesn't it does not bring idolatry to
[1:36:26] us not a Believer it sets us right
[1:36:30] brother brandham is just a man he's not
[1:36:32] our Lord Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ amen so Christ being the head has
[1:36:37] the preeminence over all the gifts that
[1:36:39] he has placed in within the body he has
[1:36:42] the preeminence over all branches of
[1:36:44] ministry that operates within his body
[1:36:48] he has the preeminence over all the
[1:36:50] members right in his body so now notice
[1:36:54] we're not to come together to talk about
[1:36:56] the message we are uh uh come together
[1:37:00] to get in the message and the message is
[1:37:04] Christ he is the word can you say
[1:37:09] Amen see and so I believe that that the
[1:37:13] True
[1:37:14] Believer in the message is more
[1:37:16] connected with the
[1:37:18] word and this Bible than anyone else in
[1:37:22] the world is true message
[1:37:26] Believers is because the word came to a
[1:37:29] profit amen amen so then every gift and
[1:37:32] every Ministry in the body of
[1:37:35] Christ is disciplined everybody say
[1:37:38] disciplined every Ministry Ministry
[1:37:42] every
[1:37:43] gift is disciplined every operation of
[1:37:47] these gifts and Ministry is disciplined
[1:37:49] because now we have our
[1:37:54] headship discipline to the word remember
[1:37:58] discipline means to show restraint
[1:38:00] controlled temperent ain't that right
[1:38:04] see so now notice what the prophet said
[1:38:06] about the Pentecostal people he says the
[1:38:09] gifts and callings are in the church but
[1:38:11] the people don't know how to control
[1:38:13] themselves that's
[1:38:14] right yes they don't know how to take
[1:38:17] hold of God another place the gifts are
[1:38:20] in the church but the po little children
[1:38:22] get those gifts and they don't have the
[1:38:23] teaching to know how to control it if
[1:38:26] you'd mcontrol it see you'll do more
[1:38:29] damage than you will good amen about it
[1:38:34] another place what the church needs
[1:38:35] tonight is to know how to control these
[1:38:38] gifts for evil spirits can come in and
[1:38:41] speak just the same as good spirits can
[1:38:45] speak you know that see he says now and
[1:38:49] you must have the spirit of discernment
[1:38:51] to know that that they had it in the
[1:38:54] Bible time see and if they didn't do it
[1:38:57] see why if they didn't do a then why
[1:38:59] Paul says let uh why did Paul say Let
[1:39:03] One judge and the people judge and so
[1:39:05] forth see see those gifts of Prophecy
[1:39:09] everything is supposed to be correctly
[1:39:11] put in
[1:39:14] order for Satan can intim imitate every
[1:39:18] gift that God's got every gift he can in
[1:39:22] imitate it and you must know the right
[1:39:25] and wrong and by their fruits you know
[1:39:27] it see watch whether it comes to pass
[1:39:30] and whether it's truth or not and that's
[1:39:33] the way you know the spirit yes see so
[1:39:37] we are now under a
[1:39:40] headship are you with me now so then
[1:39:44] every gift every Minister comes under
[1:39:46] the headship how do we discern the gift
[1:39:50] how do we discern discern the ministry
[1:39:52] you don't discern the man you discern
[1:39:54] the spirit the prophet said remember go
[1:39:57] listen to discernment of spirit discern
[1:40:00] his motives discern his intentions what
[1:40:03] is he trying to do with that
[1:40:05] gift amen well then how do we judge
[1:40:08] there is a message that's right that has
[1:40:12] brought us back to the
[1:40:17] word praise the Lord is this all right
[1:40:22] he said I think we need to what we need
[1:40:24] is to get ourselves in control and just
[1:40:27] quit scattering and jumping and respect
[1:40:30] the gifts of God and things and put them
[1:40:33] in their places like that and let the
[1:40:35] Holy Spirit operate the church and then
[1:40:39] them other people will go to hungering
[1:40:40] and thirring for it see now see so
[1:40:43] you've got the extremes youve got those
[1:40:45] that do not believe in gifts at all they
[1:40:47] don't believe in no an on they don't
[1:40:48] believe in nothing so they're just
[1:40:50] intellectual
[1:40:51] in their Church in their speeches draws
[1:40:54] the intellectual crowds then you've got
[1:40:56] those that are
[1:40:57] Fanatics they've gone into fanaticism
[1:41:00] with
[1:41:00] everything
[1:41:02] hello but as as we've taught that that
[1:41:05] brother Brandon was a balanced man this
[1:41:08] message is balanced the way of Holiness
[1:41:11] the the the way of Holiness is a
[1:41:13] balanced way
[1:41:15] amen he said see but as long he said but
[1:41:18] as long as you let it run loose see and
[1:41:21] this one this way and that one that one
[1:41:24] and no control they just think it's
[1:41:27] babbling they talk better than that in
[1:41:29] the Bible see it's not the gifts that
[1:41:33] they've got against it's the way you
[1:41:36] Loosely use
[1:41:41] them you know the prophet said a man can
[1:41:44] send his soul to hell with a Divine
[1:41:47] gift ain't that right that's another
[1:41:50] place he says this he said if God has
[1:41:53] really given something and give it to
[1:41:55] your
[1:41:56] charge now we're going to wind it down
[1:41:58] but he says if God has given you
[1:42:01] something and put it into your charge I
[1:42:04] want you to listen now every Minister
[1:42:07] every Deacon every trustee every singer
[1:42:11] whatever you are whatever gift you've
[1:42:13] got listen if he's given you this and
[1:42:16] he's put it in your charge you've got to
[1:42:19] use that with the wisdom of
[1:42:23] God
[1:42:24] Amen can you say
[1:42:27] Amen brother Brown talks you know about
[1:42:30] adoption and we know that we're in
[1:42:32] adoption this is the adoption
[1:42:37] age and he talks about it in in many
[1:42:41] places of the obedient son versus the
[1:42:45] disobedient we know that the father
[1:42:47] could not put any confidence in the son
[1:42:50] that was
[1:42:52] disobedient so then therefore that son
[1:42:55] would never fall heir to any of the
[1:42:57] possession that the father had because
[1:43:00] the father couldn't trust him yet he
[1:43:03] remained a son but if the son was
[1:43:05] obedient then the father could trust him
[1:43:08] then the father would set he a certain
[1:43:11] day aside and would then adopt him
[1:43:15] publicly right amen he would place a
[1:43:18] robe on him and have a ceremony and what
[1:43:21] is
[1:43:22] adoption we we would apply that adoption
[1:43:25] today is taking someone outside the
[1:43:27] family and bringing him to our family
[1:43:28] making him part of our family and that's
[1:43:30] not true not not as far as biblical
[1:43:34] adoption adoption in the Bible is that a
[1:43:37] son was always the son but it it
[1:43:40] depended on whether he was worthy for
[1:43:42] the business the father might have had a
[1:43:43] business a farm or or whatever and he
[1:43:47] wanted to hand that over to his son and
[1:43:50] so he'd take take that son and put him
[1:43:51] under a tutor and that tutor the father
[1:43:53] could trust that tutor and and they they
[1:43:56] were intimate friends and and these
[1:43:58] things and and and so the the tutor knew
[1:44:01] exactly what the father wanted what his
[1:44:03] character was how he controlled his
[1:44:05] business how he done it all and he would
[1:44:07] try to relay this to the son he would
[1:44:09] try to teach him he would try to build
[1:44:10] the character of the father in the son
[1:44:12] he would try to put the knowledge of the
[1:44:14] father in the sun he would try to do it
[1:44:15] all to where that when that sun got
[1:44:18] ready amen then the sun could take over
[1:44:20] the bus business but then the tutor
[1:44:22] would would come back and Report
[1:44:24] occasionally to the father well the
[1:44:26] father said well how's he doing now
[1:44:28] how's he doing cuz he wants to hear that
[1:44:29] good report right well I I don't know
[1:44:34] what to do with this guy you know I I
[1:44:36] hate tell you you know uh Jim I you know
[1:44:41] Billy Bobby
[1:44:44] just I I try to give him some lessons
[1:44:46] and he just totally does it Opposite
[1:44:49] constantly like brother Brandon would
[1:44:51] say it this way tutor come to him and
[1:44:53] said well I gave him a flat tire you
[1:44:56] know when they getting ready to go to
[1:44:57] church they got outside and there was a
[1:44:58] flat tire and they you know they just
[1:45:00] went back inside and sat
[1:45:07] down or he'd say he'd come to them and
[1:45:09] say you know what I I caused them to
[1:45:11] have a flat tire and you know what they
[1:45:13] done they they went and called somebody
[1:45:15] else to get a ride for church
[1:45:17] really wow pretty good
[1:45:21] yeah you know what I'm saying see God
[1:45:23] allows things to happen to just see
[1:45:25] where we're at amen he allows situations
[1:45:29] ain't that right so now notice see God
[1:45:31] wants to put us in a position of
[1:45:34] authority that when you say you're not
[1:45:36] just sitting there rambling your words
[1:45:39] ain't that right that's right that's
[1:45:42] right so he said see if we can only get
[1:45:44] quietened down away from our differences
[1:45:47] and become a one great United body God
[1:45:50] God would Place those gifts exactly
[1:45:52] where they belong then you'd see
[1:45:53] Miracles done signs and wonders done
[1:45:56] these gifts like speaking with tongues
[1:45:58] how we misuse that see just fly loose
[1:46:01] any time did you realize that that's
[1:46:03] wrong can you say that with me that's
[1:46:07] wrong certainly is but put it in its
[1:46:10] place and let it be used exactly the way
[1:46:13] God intended it to be used it'll bring
[1:46:16] down the power and blessings of God but
[1:46:19] out of place it'll CA
[1:46:21] confusion just like healing healing is a
[1:46:24] great thing but if it's placed and used
[1:46:27] in in wrongly and it's placed in the
[1:46:30] wrong position misused then the prophet
[1:46:32] said it becomes a reproach and all gifts
[1:46:35] are all other gifts are the same see if
[1:46:38] everything was operating perfect in
[1:46:41] harmony with God this Pentecostal group
[1:46:44] would be one great big Pentecostal
[1:46:46] Church of the Living God see that's
[1:46:49] right but the way we misuse it see the
[1:46:52] gifts are here so God would call us out
[1:46:56] of that
[1:46:58] babyon we're not part of that
[1:47:00] Pentecostal
[1:47:03] Babylon we are now under a
[1:47:07] headship
[1:47:11] sir the
[1:47:13] Pentecostals consider speaking in
[1:47:15] tongues to be a great thing oh
[1:47:18] yeah but that's the last and least of
[1:47:20] the
[1:47:22] gifts every True Believer believes in
[1:47:27] them but as the prophet taught us the
[1:47:29] first gift is wisdom the second gift is
[1:47:31] knowledge and he said what good is it
[1:47:34] going to do to have knowledge if you
[1:47:35] haven't got wisdom to know how to take
[1:47:37] care of your knowledge that's right what
[1:47:39] good does it do to speak with tongues if
[1:47:41] you haven't got the wisdom to know when
[1:47:42] and how to place it the same with
[1:47:44] healing or with any of the other gifts
[1:47:47] can you say Amen see so so then then you
[1:47:51] you know Paul Paul would talk about it
[1:47:53] and how that Heath abounded toward us in
[1:47:56] all wisdom and in
[1:47:58] Prudence when did that happen in this
[1:48:02] messag I I believe that when the seals
[1:48:05] were open there came a wisdom to the
[1:48:08] church
[1:48:10] amen a discernment within the
[1:48:13] church
[1:48:15] hello every one of us in the message and
[1:48:18] in the body should have discernment Amen
[1:48:21] to the youngest to the oldest uh uh if
[1:48:25] you're placed in the body of Christ and
[1:48:27] we all know by one Spirit we're all
[1:48:29] baptized into one
[1:48:32] body and if we're placed in that body
[1:48:35] then now we're under a headship and that
[1:48:38] headship is our intelligence that
[1:48:40] operates the
[1:48:41] body then we have this wisdom because
[1:48:44] the wisdom is coming from the headship
[1:48:47] right you say amen amen that's
[1:48:51] right and so then you
[1:48:55] know with all of the confusion that has
[1:48:58] happened in in in the Pentecostal and
[1:49:01] brother brandham he held the ministers
[1:49:04] responsible he held the ministers
[1:49:06] responsible for bringing such confusion
[1:49:08] he says because they are so confused
[1:49:10] with their
[1:49:11] organizations and I have to be honest
[1:49:14] the confusion has drifted over within
[1:49:16] the message ranks and and the reason why
[1:49:19] is because men will not let go of their
[1:49:23] organizational
[1:49:25] teachings and they want to bring this
[1:49:27] into the message and mix it with the
[1:49:29] message you
[1:49:31] cannot
[1:49:34] cannot you can't do
[1:49:37] it you got to come out of her my people
[1:49:40] come out of her my people the headship
[1:49:43] is not
[1:49:47] organization you love the Lord am amen
[1:49:50] I got a lot more but if the musicians
[1:49:52] will
[1:49:55] come we have been positionally placed in
[1:49:58] the body of Christ under one headship
[1:50:03] amen it is the only body that is subject
[1:50:07] to the
[1:50:08] word proving that it is a word body we
[1:50:11] are a word
[1:50:16] body so if a man has been baptized by
[1:50:19] one spirit in into one body of Jesus
[1:50:22] Christ then he will be disciplined to
[1:50:24] the word of
[1:50:26] God can you say amen Amen brother Braham
[1:50:29] said you can sit in the same church
[1:50:31] Shout by the same gospel but if your
[1:50:33] nature isn't tempered you'll never be
[1:50:36] recognized as a genuine
[1:50:39] son it's got to be tempered amen can you
[1:50:42] amen do you love the Lord hallu praise
[1:50:46] God there's a meaning and a real
[1:50:50] purpose for being in the body of Christ
[1:50:53] God putting us
[1:50:55] there it changes the nature changes
[1:50:58] changes who we are changes our
[1:51:01] way second Corinthians 5:17 If any man
[1:51:05] be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:51:06] Creation The Prophet would tell us
[1:51:09] creation old things are passed away and
[1:51:11] behold all things are become
[1:51:13] new ain't that right amen Romans 6 and3
[1:51:17] know ye not that so many of us us as
[1:51:20] were're baptized in Jesus Christ we're
[1:51:22] baptized into his death therefore we are
[1:51:24] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:51:27] that like as Christ was raised from the
[1:51:29] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:51:32] we also should walk in newness of
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:38] life one place says brother Braham says
[1:51:42] I'm I'm going to have you know I'm going
[1:51:43] to have to cut just a little bit here
[1:51:45] you know get the Briars out of the way
[1:51:48] but he said men and women that won't
[1:51:49] follow God's word and his teaching after
[1:51:52] they claim to be born again there's
[1:51:54] something
[1:51:58] wrong say that again men and women that
[1:52:00] won't follow God's word and his teaching
[1:52:02] after they claim to be born again
[1:52:04] there's something wrong can you say
[1:52:08] amen amen why because we cannot be in
[1:52:11] disagreement with the
[1:52:13] word and fulfill the will of God at the
[1:52:15] same
[1:52:16] time can you say
[1:52:18] Amen
[1:52:21] oh do you love the
[1:52:24] Lord God just didn't give us
[1:52:27] gifts we made it to where we would be
[1:52:29] pliable to him his
[1:52:33] leadership here John 1613 it says how be
[1:52:37] it when he the spirit of Truth has come
[1:52:39] he will guide you into all all
[1:52:43] truth can you say Amen all truth I love
