just good serving the lord amen and um trust everyone had a good day today and uh the musicians can be dismissed and uh um believe trust your staying warm amen during this cold amen but um uh it's good to have brother bu back with us amen and uh he's been sick for a little while but uh just good to see he's recovering and I heard it's your birthday today is that right 7 7 years young amen and um so we uh uh just want to wish uh wish you happy birthday brother Bill and uh we uh truly uh thankful for him and the testimony that he has and what the Lord has done for him amen and uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 46th chapter amen and um Psalms uh 46 and we've been um reading this for an opening scripture but it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore we uh will we uh therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Sal there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father it is so good to be in your house gathered with the redeemed father that you have purchased with your own blood and I pray father that you would just move among us this evening show your s to be real lord for we are believers and we know Lord that nothing is impossible with you father I pray that it would become a reality to us that nothing is impossible with us either oh God we love you and we just Commit This service into your hands and Lord just have the preeminence in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening amen so the Lord is our our present help in time of trouble uh what a promise that we have aen today a man to know that God does work and he he is present and um but as as we are taught that God works by faith for that's his law there has to be somebody to believe him there has to be someone to take him at his word uh brother branam he he said to a woman sitting in a wheelchair he said now if your faith can't go to action cannot can't go to action he said you'll you will always be in the wheelchair but when your faith can take action to a place that down in your soul that says so not not reasoning but something in here says so then brother something's going to take place and You Begin moving ain't that right see so the the Bible tells us of of course that faith without works is dead amen so there's got to be works that come with faith and and brother Brandon would tell us God sees your faith the world sees your action God sees your faith the world sees your action so faith and and action or Works go hand in hand and and so but this is what makes us unusual to the world Amen uh and and this this word unusual it it means definitely out of the ordinary unexpected odd uh weird and and brother Brandon preached the message Oddball and how that we are odd we're we're oddballs to the world and at the same time the world is odd to us there there's there's really a um uh uh we're just different like oil and and water it it just can't mix amen we're either OD to the world or uh um and the world odd to us or uh uh so so anyways but God uh God is is also unusual amen and uh he's always been that way and in every age he's he's just been unusual his way of doing things is unusual his characteristics is unusual the way he helps amen is is unusual and and so that when God says I'm a present help in time of trouble how unusual amen it is to to to the world but it shouldn't be unusual because God has fortold Us in his word of what he would do amen and what he is the uh his word speaks of him and tells of who he is uh if you want to know about God and and of God and and get acquainted with God in in the sense of his description and things uh it's in the word of God Amen the the Bible does not present a a different God uh uh than than the god that is present to help us a amen and and so uh uh uh the Bible tells us that nothing is impossible with him how many believes that nothing is impossible with him the Bible tells us that he is the Mighty God and and that he is Sovereign it it tells us that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen the Bible also tells us of God's desire to heal our bodies and his desire to save our soul and and and the desire that he has to to set the the captive free but when he comes on the scene amen he's unusual amen when he does Amen come to help then then it's it's unusual to the world Amen you see God is is Supernatural amen as we have said and his actions are Supernatural and and so the prophet said wherever God is wherever he is present the supernatural takes place amen and and so we we we must uh uh uh uh uh uh be able to to draw that distinction between God and man man's help is a natural help and and that help is a limited help and and that help can't can't do the things that God desires to do that that help ain't going to get you anywhere in in in in in God if I could say it that way amen but but God's help is a supernatural help at which is unlimited it it's all powerful it it it that help works miracles that help does the impossible a amen and and so so wherever God is amen the supernatural takes place amen uh um uh he always manifests himself in a supernatural way wherever he is amen and and and this is why amen that that there there there's a supernatural it it should be a supernatural element to every one of our lives that has God Amen living within us amen e even to invite God into our services well we're inviting a supernatural element that that go is far superior than just our natural Gathering can you say Amen if it if if if he just provided another natural thing then then we don't need him we've got enough natural ability here amen that could do something but but we desire something greater than our natural strength and our natural ability our natural talents amen see there there's needs that that that that require the supernatural amen and and so uh according to the Bible amen he is here how many believes he's here he is here the mighty Angel which is the Lord himself the son of man revealed is here amen see and and we know beyond the shadow of a doubt at least I hope it's a it's no uh Shadow of Doubt in you amen is is that that he came uh uh with power amen and great glory in a cloud amen and and and and and so uh uh he's here amen he did not leave with the prophet amen the you know it's just like when John left the scene Jesus didn't leave the scene amen John said I must decrease that he may increase and and so uh uh uh brother brandom amen his ministry was that of John the Baptist amen as John the Baptist uh introduced the coming first coming of Christ so has has this message forun the second coming of Christ amen and it's brought him amen it's brought him to Earth amen amen not in a physical body of course as we know but at the same time Jesus Christ is here in every way that he was in the days of when he walked the Earth outside of his Corporal body can you say amen amen see and so now notice what the Bible says they that know their God shall do exploits amen I believe the prophet would call it Grace exploits Supernatural exploits it isn't uh uh like like going to a circus and and watching man do all kinds of stuff or or or going to the U uh Ripley Believe It or Not and seeing the accomplishments of man and and we stand in awe this is a greater accomplishment than any man could ever have is a people that know their God shall do great exploits amen Supernatural explo poets notice what the prophet said and they will show supern Supernatural signs a people Abraham seed uh a sign of the supernatural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally that's what a people will show amen when they know their God the people that know their God in a supernatural way not trying to make him a a natural man not trying to make him uh uh just like a four-footed Beast or or or whatever like like uh uh Paul talked about in Romans and how they made The Incorruptible God into a corruptible image and all of these things see but they that truly know their God the way he is they will do great exploits amen and they'll show the sign of a supernatural Christ risen from the dead supernaturally see so they know their God Amen how many knows your God Amen well it's talking about you Church he's here he's here a prophet introduced him and the people that know him shall do great exploits see you don't know God through a textbook amen you know him by seeing him who is invisible amen see amen so h a teacher you know didn't come and paint a to us a picture of him to where we can see him in the way of imagination amen there there's Great Men amen theologians and Scholars that can stand behind the pulpit and they can take a subject and they can paint it so well Amen to where we you can just imagine it in your mind and and these things but but that's not the way Christ did he didn't bring up a theologian Amen to paint a picture so we'd have an imagination of him amen but God has come and revealed himself in a Supernatural way amen this is why the prophet said in this great hour that we're now living we and we see yearly it gets darker and darker to the world and the coming notice the coming of the Lord gets brighter and brighter as he reveals himself in his word and in his manifestation amen see so but but what makes him unusual amen see because the prophet talked the the Bible talks about this coming amen the the Bible talks about the the days that we're living in but what makes it so unusual is because the people don't believe in the Supernatural amen the churches have gotten away from the Supernatural and the ministry has taught the people Amen to be against the supernatural amen see they don't believe that that Jesus Christ is the same as he was back then uh today can you say amen amen that's right and and it it's kind of like in blind bame's day amen the prophet said the priest taught that there is no such thing in no more no such thing as Miracles no such thing as Divine Healing no such thing as that Supernatural he said we don't have that see that's what the priest said taught in that day Jehovah doesn't heal by his power no more we have doctors and things that does that isn't that way we stand today amen people rely more on doctors than they do the word of God Amen the doctor's word becomes their absolute than the word of God does he says see that's what a priest taught we have doctors and things uh uh that does that and we don't need that no more so Jehovah doesn't heal that was of the day gone by we just keep the law and we get sick and die and go to heaven and that's all that's all we need ain't that right see and and and so but but really that isn't as bad as it is today amen today is the worst day that we could ever uh imagine and and and and the Bible again talks about it Paul would tell us that that that perilous times will come in the last days perilous times that word perilous is dangerous dangerous times are going to come amen and and you think well oh yeah right murder and and uh you know uh rape and and and uh human trafficking but notice what brother Brandon would tie this to perilous times shall come and he said the faith will be pretty slow then amen that's the danger amen is faith will be pretty slow then amen see if God moves on the scene by faith then the people are left without hope because their faith is slow see we're living in the day of modern science amen and and Divine Healing has practically been placed on the Shelf amen we've got psychologist we've got you know we we've got uh all kinds of hospitals and and and and you know that's all okay that that's all fine and dandy whatever the world wants amen but a prophet told us God never told us to go build hospitals God never told us Amen to do all of these things he told us to lay hands on the sick cast out devils and in my name amen you you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall be healed you'll cast out Devils you'll you'll drink any deadly thing and it shall not hurt you why because it's in a supernatural Rim can you say amen that's right see amen I I don't you know the doctors are limited and we expect that to happen but the church should not be limited amen it's true but the prophet said the church has turned the people over to the doctors especially the psychiatrist see but so what did Jesus say about this day Matthew 24 and 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together so if you see what he's saying the son of man is the carcass can you say Amen the son of man is the carcass wherever the son of man is revealed there's where the Eagles are going to be gathered now so what is the carcass what is the son of man well John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God 14th verse and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us ain't that right see but the carcass the carcass that word revealed is where the Supernatural is demonstrated can you say amen and that's where amen the Eagles are gathered notice what a prophet said he says now through the age it has been that way men walk in Slumber of life and they hear their teaching and their philosophy and so forth that teach us theologies but that still doesn't satisy y the human heart I guarantee it doesn't satisfy the elect of this day see and when the supernatural comes into view like it did in the days of our Lord Jesus when the word became flesh God took on flesh God the word became flesh ain't that right see he says see like it was in that day after their fine priest and so forth that they had their Scholars and their philosophies when Jesus came on the scene when that word god became flesh see when he came on the scene with the power and the manifestation of God the people flock to hear him because it's something in the rims Beyond can you say Amen so wherever the Supernatural is displayed and the supernatural manifestations of God Amen is is is on displ that's where the carcass is and that's where the elect of God will be gathered can you say Amen now some amen call call the supernatural work of God they called it a devil amen when Jesus done the supernatural they said Ah that's the devil right but then there was others that recognized something different amen and the prophet said and those who believed in it in that Supernatural work amen they were saved and they were healed think of that they were saved because they believed in it they were healed because they didn't look at it as a devil amen they saw it as God doing something Supernatural God was there Amen to help them oh do you love him another thing that makes God unusual his people have gotten away from the word of God Amen and they don't know what God has promised to do in his word so when he does something when he does do something amen they don't believe it amen Prophet said they're so steeped in Dogma so steeped in their Creeds and Theology and they're so comfortable amen just going to church for you know and timing it and everything is just perfect it's all a program see amen and and they're just satisfied with that amen see and and and so uh uh but but we find that God does nothing everybody say God does nothing God does nothing outside of his own word God does nothing outside of his own word you take away the word you take away God a ain't that right so the people have gotten away from the word they've gotten away from God Amen when they rejected the message of this hour they rejected Jesus Christ amen see so the prophet says see God always manifest himself in Supernatural but always everybody say always according to his word see another place anybody that really takes God's word at face value is considered a little off at the head little unusual a little mental little something a little wrong with him little CRA just an oddball when someone truly takes God at his word takes his word at face value see it's so Supernatural the natural world doesn't know nothing about it it's foolish to the carnal mind so you'll never understand it but Abraham believed it if we could go down through the Bible of of this of the pages of this Bible the word was so odd to the world but no Noah believed it can you say Amen we could say but but David believed it but Rahab believed it but Moses believed it there's got to be somebody that believes it and because there was somebody that believed it God was able to be a help Amen in a present time can you say amen amen you see we could say Mary believed it see she didn't fuss amen the prophet said she didn't fuss at that angel like Zechariah uh uh did she didn't try to figure it all out she simply believed the word of the Lord do you believe that amen so when the word came to her now think of it she had already been meditating upon Isaiah 9 or uh uh 96 maybe or when when Behold a virgin shall conceive amen she had all the prophet said she had been meditating it they just got back from church the day before amen and and uh the the the the priest was up there telling them all that God isn't the same amen he he doesn't do Miracles there's no such thing as them things that he did back there amen and and the prophet gives that story of how her and Joseph after service began to talk about it and and and something be to prick upon in her heart amen and she was directed to the promise amen Behold a virgin shall conceive amen and it wouldn't leave her mind amen and the next morning as she went out uh had there appeared an angel and begin to tell her you're that Virgin Mary amen and she didn't question it it wasn't it wasn't so un unusual and out of the out of the way to where she just couldn't grasp it but she would say be it unto me according to Thy word now brother Bram said now how many of you sick people is expected to be healed tonight all right you're going to get it you have to see you believe it and are expecting it it's got to happen I just believe God don't you certainly see what he says is the truth don't try to figure it out just believe another place he says oh the blessedness of believing the blessing blessing of not trying to figure it out the blessing of just resting on God's word and say it's true and go on it's life can you say Amen how many can say that today it's true the word of God is true and you just move on you're not trying to figure it out it's just true GL he says if God makes a promise in the Bible then if you receive that the supernatural promise will make a supernatural manifestation because God will vindicate his word I think that's worth reading again if God makes a promise in the Bible any promise if he makes that promise and then if you receive that the pro Supernatural promise will make a supernatural manifestation because God will vindicate his word brother brandham talked about the time his mother-in-law uh her clock quit working she told Brother brand she said I needed that clock and and and she said I didn't have the money to go to go get a clock and and so she says I I just got down and I said God make that clock run for me will you and she looked up and it started running just perfectly why amen it wasn't too unusual to her to ask God to do something amen it wasn't too unusual amen well what if I pray and it doesn't happen it wasn't too unusual she just took God at face valow you regardless it it wasn't trying to figure it out it wasn't trying to amen whatever she just believed god brother Bram said later a few days later her refrigerator went out she didn't have the money to get a refrigerator so she said God will you be merciful to me again you know me he says she said just start my refrigerator to freezing again will you she got up went and looked in her refrigerator and it was running perfectly amen I'm just thinking of uh of these things and and and and brother Dell Smith you know uh he had put on a a testimony of his uh uh that he had uh uh on a Minister's chat today and I thought it would be fitting but he's talking about how he was frying chicken uh Wings in a deep fryer and and you know when he had finished the uh the The Last One Wing he he he went and got it and he was going to move it out of the way and when he got there and let put his hands on it or get ready to put his hands to it the leg went out and it dumped uh grease on his hand and he said immediately he thought oh my I got to preach tonight you know and and but he says as he as he sat there he realized there was no pain there was no bubbling there there there there was nothing there he said he just went and uh uh shook the grease off wiped it off and went inside and ate ate his wings and just thinking God God Amen for healing or for protecting see he's a present help in the time of your trouble can you say Amen now see that that that shouldn't be too unusual for us amen if we believe in a supernatural God so brother Bram said see be simple just ask be simple just ask don't try to figure it out don't try to study it just believe it don't mentally try to figure it out just believe believe it with your soul can you say Amen now he's telling us what we have got to do Amen in in in in this be simple just ask don't try to figure it out and just believe it in your soul can you say Amen see so then we find that the supernatural worked Amen in accordance to what God had promised amen with for brother Dale and and for uh brother bram's uh mother-in-law and and for so many the supernatural worked in accordance to God's promised word see because Philippians 4:19 it says but my God is he your God I like how Paul would put that my God Amen not just God but my God Amen he he he's showing that he knew God in a personal way God Amen he had that relationship with God he had such a confidence in God that God became his God Amen God become his provider God became his way maker God became his Redeemer that's the way it should be with all of us but he says but my God shall supply all your needs not not your wants your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus can you say amen amen so the prophet said in all ages it's been the supernatural manifestation of his word now think of that it's it's been in all ages the supernatural manifestation of his word oh my amen see now the Pentecostals and the charismatics they they accept any kind of Supernatural manifestation outside of the word of God Amen and and the prophet talked about it amen blood in the hands you know oil in the forehead or vice vers amen speaking in tongues and prophesying amen you can go up on in YouTube and they've got they've got what they call the revivals and of of laughing hysterically and people howling like dogs and people shaking uncontrollably amen these things are believed uh uh to be a supernatural manifestation of God but I say this if it's it's not of God if it does not line up with the word of God amen if the supernatural manifestation does not line up with this word it's not of God are you with me now amen see amen see so so now in in Isaiah 5511 God said the word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish everybody say it shall accomplish well well well what's going to make that accomp who's going to make sure it's accomplished God is a present help in the time of trouble amen it shall accomplish you say well that's his word but his word concerns you have you ever just thought of that it was by his word that he decreed you to Salvation it's by his word that he said by my stripes you are healed or we were healed amen every promise of God pertains to his children amen so it shall go forth out of my mouth or that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it so the prophet said see God works right through that word right through to make it come to pass in this generation that we live in he's here everybody say he's here he's here amen not to tickle your fancy he's here not to make you roll on the floor he's here not for you to shake up and down and and run all over the place he's here to make that word come to pass in this generation in your life yes sir you see when the word of God is foreign to the people then God is unusual to them when he fulfills it when the supernatural is foreign to the people then it is unusual Amen to them when it takes place see so being that God does nothing outside of his word then we have to know what he promised to do in order to recognize him amen we have to know amen we have to know by his word what he promised to do if we're going to truly our expectation is going to be genuine then we have to know what he promised to do in his word in order for our expectation to be right can you amen amen God never did say that there would be blood coming out of our hands and oil coming out of the forehead I don't expect that hello amen see but so we have to know what he promised to do in order to recognize him see his word is his promise as the prophet has taught us and he allotted his word to every age to each age that's important amen he lotted his word to each age amen see a portion of his word to the age therefore he cannot do any more or any less than what he promised to do in the age that he put his word in can you say Amen so to se God in Noah day a person would have to know what God promised to do in that day amen to see God in Moses day aen would have to know what God promised to do in that day amen for a man to see God in Jesus day then he would have to know what God promised for that day he'd have to know what God promised for the Messiah to be that's why when Jesus went to that woman at the well and he began to do the sign of Messiah she said sir we know when the Messiah cometh he'll do these things she had already been taught no matter how low she was and degraded and and a low life something had been taught to her that when the Messiah come this is something that you going to have to look for and when he appeared to her she recognized him by the supernatural sign in the day of Isaiah the prophet for told of Messiah being born of a virgin girl when it came time for the Messiah to be born the priest had been teaching the people that God doesn't work miracles anymore as we said therefore the people didn't believe in the Supernatural the the the church and the organizations and all of that they they they' gotten away from the word that gotten away from the supernatural so then when the the spirit of God overshadowed Mary it was too unusual they couldn't accept it they couldn't accept her testimony amen that that uh what was born of her was of the Holy Ghost they they couldn't accept it so so Jesus had to Bear the the reproach of being born of illegitimacy ain't that right he was of a illegitimate birth a conception and and these things see and and when Jesus declared that he came from God and when and going back to God Amen it was too unusual amen for them to accept that and they walked away from him amen when when when he says I and my father are one it was too unusual and they crucified him you you understand too too unusual here he had become now notice what a prophet said God had sent them Deliverance God had come to be a help to them to send them a Deliverance but it didn't come just the way that they were used to receiving religion see it was too unusual for them that's why they couldn't get their Deliverance amen see so this is why only uh two of the original people that left Egypt were the only ones to go into the promised land because the rest of them didn't understand that God was there to fulfill what he had already promised God God had had said what he was going to do and there he was see they should have known that God was fulfilling his word amen why because God always uh Works amen according to his word that he allotted for that day and fulfills it amen see and this was exactly what he was doing in Moses's day in Noah's day in Jesus day amen and this is exactly what he's doing in our day can you say Amen see so then we we find amen as the prophet said see God had alloted his portion of word amen for That season of time talking of Moses see and God was ready to F makeing ready to fulfill his Divine promised word that he gave to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob now brother brandom says in the in the token in or the Third Exodus he said see ye years hundreds of years had passed but yet God never forgets his promise how many believes that God never forgets his promise in the season the due time God always makes his promise right therefore you can rest assure that what God has promised in this Bible he's going to do just no need of trying to think anything else and say well the prophet was maybe was wrong or or that couldn't happen in this day see it looked almost impossible then more impossible than it does now but God did it anyhow because he promised he would do it now look at the scriptures acts 7 and6 and God spake on this wise that his seed Abraham's seed s should sojourn in a Strange Land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge God's saying this I will judge them and and uh said God and after that they shall come forth and serve me in this place see so so that was the promise Exodus 2:24 and God heard their groaning and remembered his Covenant with Abraham Isaac and with Jacob see in in Exodus 3 and8 God said to Moses I am come down to deliver them he's come to be a present help in their time of trouble see I've come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land a large unto a land uh flowing with milk and honey so God notice God came not only just to judge that Nation he come to judge that Nation but he also came to deliver his elect ain't that right so God is telling Moses I remember the Covenant I've heard their groaning amen now in that 10th verse now come now therefore I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt now brother brandom as he's reading that he says what was God doing he said God God was going in the form of a man amen his way is so unusual but God was going in a form of a man amen see so Moses went down not just to do something Supernatural in the way of Performing Miracles but he came with the word of the Lord and notice what a prophet says a true voice of God only brings back that real living Supernatural god with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true word then we know that it's the voice of God can you say Amen the true voice of God brings back only brings back the supernatural uh uh Living God with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation see so I hope you understand why this message message is so important to us you know I I we appreciate what the brothers uh done and preached it in the ages you know the the other Church ages and uh we we certainly appreciate that but those men weren't prophets come on Church they they the prophets said they were part of the reformer age see and and they only they they could only preach under that light what little old life they've got and brother Brown said we we've had just enough life amen to accept Christ as our savior and and these say just enough lot just a little bit see amen but see a Vindicated Prophet is the voice of God can you say Amen a Vindicated Prophet is the voice of God for the word of God comes to him amen see so this white brother brand would tell us now I'm just your brother by the grace of God when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might have been resented but I am God's voice to you I say that again that time was under inspiration I felt bad about it the first time but it repeated it amen so God wanted us to understand that this message was not just an a reformer message amen this this message was not a a message that coming from a theology or just some man trying to put something together this message is God's voice to us which brought back the supernatural manifestation it brought back to us the reality of a living God Supernatural can you say amen amen and under this message we understand that he is a present help in the time of our trouble no question can you amen so God in this age has come in the form of a man and manifested himself in a supernatural way amen how many believes that amen see and the prophet said that's why today the message blinds the people so much is because they're not used to seeing the supernatural they're used for a theologian they're used for educated man to be able to put everything together amen and they're not used Amen to the supernatural but when God come they should have known because God promised to send us a prophet of Malachi 4 he promised Amen to come down himself with an open book He's promised all these things amen now I want to say this we have a responsibility to keep this voice of God alive we have a responsibility to keep keep this message of God alive can you say Amen as long as the voice of God is sounding there is the supernatural you believe it so now God is in Bride form made up of men women boys girls God is now present in the form of his bride the prophet said the voice of God is in her oh man the voice of God what is that amen the is it a different voice than what a prophet preached nope for she he the prophet said the the spirit of God the the bride and the prophet will be saying the same thing amen can you say Amen which tells us that God is still manifesting himself in a Supernatural way don't become the voice for a theologian don't become a voice for Dr so and so don't become the voice amen even your own voice amen don't become the voice of of Science and and and education all that become the voice of God Supernatural Lord now notice the voice of God Amen this is why Jesus said in Matthew 18 verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven Can you say amen amen listen Church you see the connection you and God God in a bride God in you Amen to where you don't have to beg you don't have to plead you don't have to amen fall apart that God that Supernatural God is in you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven how many believes that amen John 14:13 whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it amen that's right see I I can I say it this way don't let that be too unusual for you this is a promise this speaks for us in the age of adoption when the sons of God are being placed back in their position amen this scripture applies to you and I God doesn't ex expect us just to accept every manifestation that comes along but he does want us to believe and he expects us to believe in what he promised to do am right you believe that so as Believers we should pray according to what David prayed give me understanding give me understanding in in in Psalms 1191 169 he prayed to the Lord saying give me understanding according to Thy word ain't that right so now we we can I think we can all say that the spirit of of of wisdom and Revelation and understanding has come to us through the sounding of the seventh Angel's messag I I can truly I truly believe that the eyes of our understanding is being enlightened that this day Paul's prayer is being fulfilled ain't that right now listen it it had to be but why because now we're seeing what God promised to do we seeing that God is not dead we're seeing that God is Not amen a god of History he's alive and well he is present amen here to help us time of trouble second Corinthians 169 the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong did he not do that in this message yes sir I don't I don't I don't see how anyone could hear the message study the message and leave away with the thought that God is weak that God is limited he's looking to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him that's it now the prophet said God is waiting to find somebody it's not too unusual to that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to be a Shining Light to Blind the eyes of the unbeliever God's looking for somebody in this age to where that that that his actions the he himself the Supernatural is not so unusual right that's right that's right can you say Amen yes you're going to go through hard times yes you're living in a in worst a je yes the devils are fighting on every hand but somebody's got to take God at his word to where when they look at it it's not too unusual amen they can say I know God's going to help I know God's going to deliver I know I know that God's going to move on the scene Prophet said God has never sent a message in any day but what he Vindicated it with the supernatural so what we need today is preachers that believe in the Supernatural to build the people's faith in the Supernatural what we need is is daddies and to believe in the Supernatural to build their families Faith up into the supernatural can you say Amen we don't have to give you every reason why it don't work won't work why you're this and why you're that you got every negative in the world can tell you all the bad we need somebody that just believes in the Supernatural that can say hey God promised it don't put a limit to the supernatural God let let your faith go and as much as you can believe him is how much power God will be in your life or however brother brandom said that how much powerful God will be see as as much as you let your faith go can you say Amen so brother Bram said when people's Faith get up into a place they'll get the blessings to realize it's theirs then then the same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church just like it did back there just the same can you say Amen see just the same see when people's Faith get up into a place they'll get the blessings to realize it's theirs then the oper same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church just like it did back there the same can you say Amen so then why why would we think it's so unusual for God the supernatural God to work within us hello God always everybody say God always God always sends down the Supernatural on the natural amen it's not too unusual did not the supernatural fall on a brass serpent that was made out of natural material and the people were told to look on it and if they looked on it amen they would live just something natural but the supernatural had come upon the natural did not the supernatural fall upon a pool of water called the pool of Bethesda there was no healing virtue in that water but when the supernatural came up on the natural amen it then became a healing water to the people now that's why the people gathered around it they were not looking to the Natural they they were not saying oh look at the natural what what a beautiful thing and and all that we just hang out here no they were looking for the supernatural to come upon the natural can you say amen amen see did not the spirit of God Rest Upon Jesus there he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me he hath anointed me to to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen you know the prophet said that Jesus never claimed credit for healing anybody the Bible even says that amen Jesus never amen uh claimed the credit see amen he he never wanted it for in John 14:10 he said the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works he sat in another place I can do nothing of myself but what he was is he believed in the Supernatural he believed in the scriptures he believed what the scriptures said about him amen that's right can you say Amen so we are to watch for the Supernatural and not the natural amen can you say Amen we are to rest in the Supernatural not in the natural I get ready to close but Abraham looked for the supernatural to take place because he believed in it he believed in the Supernatural 25 long years he testified he clung to it can you say amen he had been given a promise of a son the Bible says he who against hope believed in hope he considered not the deadness of Sarah's womb nor his own body now dead he counted God Faithful that promised see he wasn't just wishing for it to happen God had given him a promise and he believed in it can you say amen he knew what the word of the Lord was ain't that right and he also knew that it would take the supernatural to perform it amen they they him and Sarah couldn't have that child the doctors couldn't produce it help him amen there was nobody I mean it they was standing there no hope whatsoever in the natural but he knew that God promised it and he believed in the Supernatural God so then it wasn't unusual to Abraham Lord when God appeared in human flesh before him hello but in Genesis 18:14 God told him at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen he didn't think that was unusual he had been expecting it he had been believing in it he knew that God would be on the scene God would honor that word can you say man the Bible says he endured seeing him who is invisible amen or Moses endured but Abraham did too Amen brother BR said he didn't have to look at the natural he's seen the supernatural all the time what are you looking at today yeah that's right he didn't have to look to the Natural he seen the supernatural all the time that's the way we want to do said is look at the Unseen and the Bible says that Sarah receiv received strength to conceive seed aren't you glad for that what was it the supernatural had come upon the natural and fulfilled his word to them he was a help in the time of trouble amen last week uh brother Terry reminded me of this quote and I wanted to read it to you but notice what brother Bram said about the church he said we've lived the time out at the time of rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it some Supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in can you say amen amen don't look to the Natural Keep Your Eyes Upon the supernatural that's right if you look to the Natural you'll faint you'll get faint-hearted fear will grip you but if you can know that God is Supernatural and he's here he's here to give you that Supernatural strength the very God that performed a supernatural sign to Sarah and Abraham to show that it was him in flesh is the same God that done it again today to let you know he's here can you say amen amen if you look at it there in the Feast of the trumpets brother Bram said you know the National Force but Israel in her Homeland political power see was what it was National Force but Israel in her Homeland he said a national force is going to put the carinal church put the church that carinal church in the world Council of churches that's right but the supernatural power of God I I put that in the power of God will put the people in The Bride the world forces this way and that way but God forces upward and he said the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and Life we'll put the bride in her place cuz she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ we'll put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it aren't you glad for that and he's here to do it and I say he is doing it the voice of God has come to bring a living God back and the supernatural manifestation it's the voice of God that does it so I say to you is there anything too hard for God come on church is there anything too hard for God Amen I is is is it too hard for God to heal a headache is it too God to heal a a a virus is it too hard for God to to heal uh uh the ears and make the deaf amen here again no no it's not too hard for God there's nothing too hard he's here as a present help can you say Amen oh I love the Lord do you love him God is present here to fulfill his word for as it was in the days of lot so shall it be when the son of man is revealed we know that the son of man has been revealed we have seen the supernatural sign done in this age brother Bram said and when we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back back to life again and present him before us when we see a God who can take a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow and raise him up to a strong healthy man that ought to give rapturing Faith to the people that see that when that light flashes from the sky and the trumpet sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into the heavens can you say Amen that God that you have trusted to to to Supply your needs that God that you trust Amen to heal your babies that God that you trust Amen to deliver you out of the situations that God is going to change your body one of these days it's the same God and and it's happening to the same believer that has trusted him and believed him all the way through the Journey of time can you say Amen nothing's too hard for God nothing it's why we don't worry Why Should I Worry why should I fret if the musicians will come my God is greater my God is greater can you say man oh I love him brother BR said there today there are people good men fine men good character men fine ministers many of them priests and so forth are good man but the supernatural Vindication of the promise of this day is so unusual it throws them off their balance it does that because it's displaying the characteristic of God man the Supernatural is displaying the characteristics of God and it's so unusual to most people but don't let it be unusual to you don't let the supernatural be so unusual that you can't look for his help Amen in the time of trouble can you say amen amen yeah we're exercising our faith we're exercising what we believe in God to be it's not that we just sit here laying dormant and questioning and wondering if God could do this and this and this and then all of a sudden he changes us no we're believing him we're exercising our faith and putting it into action God is able God is able God's going to come through brother B God's going to come through amen hallelujah and that same power that we have confessed and we believe in that same power that we water with our Praises you don't have to be on the mountain top to water it you don't have to just fill all the chill bumps to water the power with your Praises but you realize what it is you realize that it's a supernatural God in our midst and you just begin to glorify him that same power that you're watering with your praise is going to take you home I'm so glad for that can you say amen I love the Lord do
