[40:04] little bit tonight um the Lord willing
[40:06] on possessing all
[40:08] things um and and a and also about about
[40:14] the the confession of our mouth for just
[40:17] for just a few minutes but I I was
[40:19] looking at this
[40:20] word con confession and the definition
[40:23] of it is is that to Ascent that is
[40:26] covenant acknowledged or or profess
[40:30] confession is made give thanks unto
[40:33] promise it also means confess profess a
[40:36] promise to give thanks confession is
[40:39] made and acknowledge so in other words
[40:41] an agreement that a promise or or yeah
[40:45] it's an agreement that A promise is
[40:47] acknowledged a and the and the Bible
[40:50] says that uh that where where we just
[40:52] read that he is the high priest of of of
[40:55] of our of of our confession
[40:57] God and so but but but we also find that
[41:00] where brother bam has taught us many
[41:01] times where that God can't do nothing
[41:03] nothing with you until until first we
[41:06] confess that that that he is and that he
[41:09] is able to do it and then and then and
[41:11] then and then and then when he confess
[41:13] it then you believe it and act upon it
[41:15] and stay with it and God will bring you
[41:17] out Lord Brother brandom said said
[41:21] said brother bandam said and my brother
[41:24] sister it isn't how much graceful you
[41:25] can pray or how much or how much much
[41:27] Penance Penance or how much Penance you
[41:29] can do it's your faith to believe that
[41:31] that he's done it for you that brings
[41:33] that brings you forth that's right every
[41:35] sinner is saved tonight in the sight of
[41:37] Jehovah God but it'll never do you any
[41:40] good until you accept it and believe it
[41:42] and confess it and then he's the high
[41:44] priest of your confession to make it
[41:46] right be be be and he's the high priest
[41:49] of your confession to make it right
[41:50] before God and any Redemptive blessings
[41:54] if if if you're weary he was wounded for
[41:56] our transgression bruised for our
[41:58] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[42:00] is upon him and with his stripes we're
[42:02] healed it's already done you just accept
[42:05] it amen and this is going to be really
[42:07] simple tonight so so you guys will have
[42:09] to have to have to have to bear with me
[42:12] but but so so a man so so so a man a man
[42:15] a man and any old sinner could he could
[42:17] come he could come up here he could come
[42:19] up he could come up here here here here
[42:22] to The Altar and he and he could pray
[42:23] all night he could cry he could beg he
[42:26] could plead he could walk walk up and
[42:27] down the floors he but he could sit
[42:30] there and SOB weep and and weep at the
[42:32] altar but until he has believed and he
[42:35] accepted he he he's he's still just a
[42:38] sinner Jesus Christ is the high priest
[42:40] of our confession in in other words our
[42:43] he's the high priest or he's the high
[42:44] priest of our profession but the
[42:46] translation of that is is the same word
[42:48] it's the high priest of our confession
[42:50] right and therefore he can't do nothing
[42:52] for us at all he he he he cannot heal us
[42:55] he cannot he cannot he cannot set us
[42:56] free he cannot he cannot save our souls
[42:59] he cannot he cannot deliver us or
[43:01] anything
[43:02] until until we confess that that that
[43:06] that and confess that he has already
[43:07] done
[43:08] it and and then he goes to work as as as
[43:11] our as our our our our our high priest
[43:15] PR and because the Bible says he was
[43:17] wounded for our transgressions he was
[43:19] bruised he was bruised for for for for
[43:21] for our our our iniquity the
[43:23] chastisement of our pieces upon him and
[43:25] brought his stripes we were healed not
[43:30] not not not not not that not that not
[43:34] that not that not that we will be or or
[43:37] or or that we ought we ought we ought we
[43:39] ought to to have been healed healed but
[43:42] but but when we were it was a past tense
[43:45] already healed God did it back there at
[43:47] Calvary already 2000 2000
[43:51] 2,000 years years ago but until you
[43:54] profess it and confess it
[43:58] that's it it it will do it it will it
[44:00] will do nothing nothing nothing no
[44:02] nothing nothing for you you have to to
[44:05] to to to to to confess it and and and
[44:08] and believe it so and um and uh we know
[44:13] that that Abraham had waited in faith
[44:15] for the promise of Isaac for 25 five
[44:18] five years it was day after day he would
[44:20] say you feel any
[44:22] different any different honey she said
[44:25] not today and and the next thing he'd
[44:28] ask her you feel any different not today
[44:30] and he'd say praise God we're going to
[44:32] have that baby
[44:33] anyways why why why why why because God
[44:38] or because because because Abraham
[44:40] through faith claimed he he he claim
[44:43] that that that that that that promise
[44:47] and he confessed it daily that that he
[44:49] would have that child and and and so we
[44:52] find that um Abraham and lot had they
[44:54] had
[44:55] separated them themselves when when um
[44:58] Abraham was called out lot lot lot lot
[45:02] lot lot lot went with him he toward
[45:04] toward toward where they were they were
[45:06] searching for a city whose Builder maker
[45:07] was God but but we find that that
[45:11] further on down Abraham God told Abraham
[45:13] to separate himself himself from from
[45:17] from from lot to to where to where God
[45:20] God um God caused a a an argument to
[45:23] break out to break out with the herdsman
[45:25] and and towards where they had to ser
[45:27] themselves but but
[45:29] but but he finally got the place but the
[45:31] were because Abraham realized that that
[45:34] that that that that that that that
[45:36] inheritance that that wherever that his
[45:39] feet will walk is it was was was his
[45:41] inheritance so so he was no longer
[45:43] looking at at at where he was at at um
[45:47] um um o on the day-to-day day-to-day
[45:50] basis he was looking at he was looking
[45:52] at at at that Eternal at that Eternal
[45:54] City whose Builder and maker was God and
[45:57] and and so so so when they separated
[45:59] themselves Abra um lot lot took lot took
[46:02] that that Sodom and Gomorrah and Abraham
[46:04] and Abraham took the desert right so so
[46:08] so so so but we find that before Abraham
[46:10] could ever obtain the promise of Isaac
[46:13] he had they had to separate themselves
[46:15] but but but yet but but but yet but yet
[46:18] but yet he continually he continually um
[46:22] confess that that that promise on a on a
[46:25] daily basis I will have have a son wake
[46:27] up the next morning I will have a son
[46:29] and he woke up the next morning said I
[46:30] will have a son son and and and and and
[46:35] yet and and brother R said said he he
[46:39] said he so T night we may not be rich in
[46:41] this world's Goods but we possess all
[46:43] things the church itself possesses all
[46:45] things yet poor yet or yet poor yet rich
[46:48] and possess all things I like that he
[46:50] said here we are that old song we used
[46:52] to sing we used to
[46:54] sing years ago my father is and and with
[46:58] houses and lands he holdeth the wealth
[46:59] of the world in his hands rubies and
[47:01] diamonds and silver and gold his coffers
[47:03] are full he has riches Untold and and we
[47:06] are a possessor of it because we are a
[47:09] child of the king amen the child always
[47:12] falls there we know all right he say he
[47:15] he he said Abraham could could could lay
[47:17] could lay a hold of it on it yet poor
[47:19] his cattle was starving and yet lot took
[47:21] the best ground his water was short hot
[47:24] days and the herdsman had had had been
[47:26] had had been in trouble and and
[47:28] everything looked like was gone wrong
[47:30] and yet he owned the whole thing and and
[47:34] in another place he um he he says
[47:37] Abraham could possess could could could
[47:39] possess that land because because and
[47:42] and he could possess that land of what
[47:44] was on it God had given it had given it
[47:47] had give it to had give it to him and
[47:49] lot was a part of that land so Abraham
[47:52] had a right had a right had a right to
[47:54] it he could call he could call or lay or
[47:56] or or lay or lay or lay hold on it he
[47:59] said now God you may you made me you
[48:01] made me this this this this promise that
[48:05] what was this land and all that and all
[48:08] in it was mine and you made the promise
[48:10] he he he he he he said he said now My
[48:12] Kinsman My Kinsman ha ha My Kinsman has
[48:16] been taken and all he's got and all he's
[48:19] got is gone and another words he he said
[48:21] if I if if I would apply it today I'd
[48:24] say the church the the church could say
[48:25] Lord God here's my brother he's laying
[48:27] here stricken with cancer he's got to he
[48:30] he he's stricken with with with with
[48:32] with with with tuberculosis he's got so
[48:35] and so and I lay a hold I lay hold of
[48:39] the promise it's my possession you told
[48:41] me so amen there you are then you can go
[48:44] after the enemy that devil and Slaughter
[48:46] it just the same as Abraham slaughtered
[48:48] slaughtered the Kings and brought back
[48:50] and brought back his his his his his and
[48:54] brought back his possession amen I like
[48:57] that it's to the believer so
[49:00] so so now we can look at and see and and
[49:03] see and see and and in order for Abraham
[49:06] in order for him to go to to go against
[49:08] I I believe it was uh seven Kings I
[49:10] think it was and in order for Abraham in
[49:12] order for Abraham in order for Abraham
[49:14] hamam to to to do this he had to lay his
[49:21] faith upon the upon the promise of
[49:24] God he had to lay lay his faith upon
[49:27] that solid rock rock Foundation of God's
[49:30] word and God's promises see see see now
[49:34] we can notice though that Abraham he he
[49:36] didn't have an army with him he he he
[49:39] was a herdsman and he probably had some
[49:41] Ranchers with him some some some um
[49:44] sheep herters some um cattle some some
[49:48] some some cattle some some cattle
[49:50] harders and and
[49:52] and and and handsome servants he he he
[49:56] he he he he he didn't he didn't have an
[49:59] army he and and and and brother brandom
[50:02] said this said that he he only had about
[50:03] a dozen men and but but but but we
[50:06] notice now that even though that that
[50:09] that even though all the opposition was
[50:10] against him all the pressure was on him
[50:14] and and and yet it seemed like it seemed
[50:16] like when it was an impossible task task
[50:18] he he he said this is my possession this
[50:21] is my my inheritance and and he and and
[50:24] he stood up and he claimed went he went
[50:27] and claimed it and and claimed what what
[50:30] was right what was rightfully his why
[50:32] because because because because he stood
[50:34] fast
[50:36] fast upon
[50:39] faith and and and and Abraham he he
[50:43] wasn't looking at at the at the couple
[50:45] of men he had he wasn't looking at at
[50:46] the maybe there was thousands and
[50:48] thousands of men against him he he
[50:50] wasn't looking at that he was looking at
[50:51] the promise of what God
[50:54] had had promised that's a wherever The
[50:57] Souls of your feet shall shall shall
[50:59] shall tread upon that I have given unto
[51:02] you why it's not it's not up to it's not
[51:04] up to it it wasn't up to him it's not up
[51:06] to me it's not up to
[51:09] you it's it's up to God and it depends
[51:13] on the faith of what God said it's mine
[51:15] and I'm going after it of what belongs
[51:17] of what belongs of what belongs to me a
[51:22] amen and so we look at we look at at at
[51:26] the word at the word confession it's
[51:28] repeating of what God has already said
[51:31] when he said that that that that you are
[51:34] delivered you are sealed you are filled
[51:36] with the Holy Ghost and and and we can
[51:39] stand in that promise in all confidence
[51:41] say and say I am delivered I am sealed I
[51:44] am set
[51:46] free I am an air of of of of all things
[51:50] I am I have the baptism of the Holy
[51:52] Ghost I am the part of the body of
[51:53] Christ because it's just repeating what
[51:55] he has already said about us right so
[51:58] now it's time that where where where we
[52:00] can get where where where we can stand
[52:02] up in all confidence and in all
[52:04] assurance and get mad at the Devil a
[52:05] little bit and confess what God has
[52:08] already said about him that he is a
[52:10] defeated enemy he was defeated at
[52:12] Calvary 2000 2,000
[52:15] years year years ago we are fighting a
[52:18] defeated
[52:20] Enemy enemy we're accepting what has
[52:22] already been been been done been done
[52:26] for us in these what what has already
[52:28] been done for us for us two two two 2000
[52:32] 2,000
[52:33] 2,000 ye years ago we when God said I am
[52:37] healed I am sealed I am a child of God
[52:40] whose report are we going to going to
[52:43] believe are we going to believe the
[52:45] doctor the doctor's report when he said
[52:47] there's just no way when he said that
[52:49] arthritis is going to is going to eat
[52:50] you up eat you up the the the the the
[52:54] the rest of your life or or or or or or
[52:57] or or whatever problem that that that
[53:01] that whatever problem that you may have
[53:03] or or if your child has gone astray or
[53:06] or or or or or or whatever the the
[53:10] situation may may may may be are we
[53:14] going to believe that report or are we
[53:16] going to to believe the report of the
[53:17] Lord why CU we have our our faith is
[53:20] resting upon the Eternal Promises of
[53:23] God and and and they and they
[53:26] and there Abraham had marched had had
[53:29] had had gather had gathered his couple
[53:31] of men around him and marched forward
[53:32] and took back and took back and took
[53:34] back what was his why because he L his
[53:37] faith resting upon the Eternal Promises
[53:39] of God brother bandam said and when you
[53:41] come forth to be to be prayed for if you
[53:44] want a Salvation if you want a Divine a
[53:46] Divi a if you want Divine Healing no
[53:48] matter what it is if you are a Believer
[53:51] you an heir of every promise so lay your
[53:53] faith upon the promise and March forward
[53:55] and tell Satan give it back give it back
[53:58] it's mine don't let him Bluff you stand
[54:00] right there right there stand right
[54:02] there stand right there on the line and
[54:03] he'll give it back God said he would so
[54:06] he has he has he he has to do it that's
[54:09] it that's your Authority that's right
[54:12] air of all
[54:13] things and in in uh in uh Deuteronomy
[54:18] chapter 2 and and verse three it says ye
[54:20] have Compass this mountain long enough
[54:23] turn ye northward and so and and and so
[54:26] those children of Israel if you look
[54:28] back at
[54:29] that at that they they they circle
[54:31] around year after year after year for
[54:34] for 40 years all because they
[54:35] disbelieved one one one word of God and
[54:38] and and yet and and and yet and yet
[54:41] Joshua and Caleb had brought back the
[54:42] evidence God God had said had said and
[54:45] and go Joshua and Caleb had brought
[54:47] forth the evidence with with the grapes
[54:49] the the the bushel of grapes on the
[54:52] staff and and and they had brought back
[54:54] a good report uh to saying saying that
[54:57] that that the land surely floweth
[54:59] floweth with the milk with with with
[55:01] milk and honey it is everything that God
[55:04] had promised and more it is it is the
[55:07] land that that Abraham had tread upon
[55:10] why could it it is it is our inheritance
[55:13] and and yet those those those those
[55:15] other spies came back and they brought
[55:17] the evil report and said and said
[55:18] there's Giants in the land and there's
[55:21] and and and and and and there's there's
[55:23] wal cities and and we look as
[55:25] grasshoppers as grasshoppers as
[55:27] grasshoppers in the site and Joshua
[55:29] stood up amongst the people and said and
[55:32] said we are more than able why why why
[55:35] because Joshua Joshua Joshua was not
[55:37] looking at the opposition he he was not
[55:39] looking at the Giants he was not looking
[55:42] at looking at the wall cities he was
[55:45] looking at the
[55:47] promis he was looking at the promises of
[55:49] God God God and he said we are more than
[55:52] able to to to to to go forth and take
[55:54] the country
[55:56] God had given them had given them that
[55:59] that that that that promise that that
[56:01] that whatsoever your your your feet
[56:04] shall shall shall shall shall tread upon
[56:07] that is your inheritance and Joshua was
[56:09] standing upon that upon that promise
[56:12] standing in all confidence and in all
[56:14] Assurance knowing knowing that he was
[56:16] more than able to take it
[56:20] but but but but but but the rest of the
[56:23] children they they begin to doubt and
[56:25] they begin they begin to question God
[56:27] and because that God had made them
[56:28] circle around that mountain year in and
[56:31] year out and year in and year out and
[56:33] year in and year out and it was the same
[56:35] old habits it was the same old it was
[56:37] the same old problems that they had it
[56:38] was the same old it was the same old
[56:39] trial that they kept they kept tripping
[56:41] over the same log BBE and they kept and
[56:43] they kept circling round and round so
[56:45] God finally said you have circled this
[56:47] mountain long enough and and and I can
[56:50] and we can stand here we can stand here
[56:53] here here here tonight and all
[56:56] confidence and all Assurance when we had
[56:58] a prophet go forth and tell us and tell
[57:00] us exactly and tell us exactly what what
[57:04] what what was in that in that in in what
[57:07] was in that Promised Land we can stand
[57:08] here as a bride of Christ and we can sit
[57:11] there and claim every s every single
[57:14] promise and we can see that it is surely
[57:16] a land flowing with milk and honey and
[57:18] if we ever have any questions about
[57:21] about whether it's true or or or or or
[57:23] or if I'm if we're doing the right thing
[57:25] or or for wondering about this all we
[57:27] have to do is reach out and grab and
[57:29] grab and grab some of that fruit uh and
[57:32] some of that fruit and start eating on
[57:33] it and realize that God's promises are
[57:37] are true we we can realize that that
[57:40] whatsoever God said it is ours it is our
[57:42] inheritance it is the children's bread
[57:45] and so so so we could we can stand there
[57:48] like Caleb in all confidence and all
[57:50] assurance and say give me my Mountain it

[57:56] has has God has has has given it has
[58:00] given it on on onto me give me my
[58:04] Mountain just just like what Joshua did
[58:06] for the children of Israel the word
[58:08] Joshua means Savior and the and that's
[58:11] the same thing that Jesus had done for
[58:12] us on Calvary when the when
[58:15] the when they when when they killed him
[58:18] he conquered death he conquered hell he
[58:20] conquered the grave and he rose up again
[58:22] with with the
[58:24] evidence with with the evidence of the
[58:27] baptism of the baptism the baptism of of
[58:29] the Holy Ghost that there is a land
[58:31] beyond the river and that they call the
[58:33] sweet forever and and he come back and

[1:01:14] that says that says I am saved is the
[1:01:16] same attributes that that that that
[1:01:19] carries us the rest of the way brother
[1:01:21] bam said

[1:01:53] his children we're Heirs of it
[1:01:55] everything that that everything that he
[1:01:57] died for so we can look at um so many
[1:02:01] different examples examples in the Bible
[1:02:02] you can look at you know you can look at
[1:02:04] you can look at Moses where where when
[1:02:06] when when he was just a stick he he
[1:02:08] leted out the children of of of of
[1:02:11] Israel we we we we've we've looked at
[1:02:13] Abraham a little bit you can look at
[1:02:14] Noah when when when when when when when
[1:02:18] when when when he was saved to the flood
[1:02:20] all because all because all because all
[1:02:22] because he he believed God you can look
[1:02:24] at you can look at David when he went
[1:02:26] when when when when when he when he took
[1:02:28] God's
[1:02:30] promis and he slayed the children of
[1:02:32] isra or not sorry he slayed the the um
[1:02:35] um
[1:02:36] Goliath and he became the king you you
[1:02:39] can look at you can look at all these
[1:02:41] examples all these examples through
[1:02:43] through throughout the
[1:02:45] Bible when when they stood there upon
[1:02:49] God upon upon upon upon upon go God
[1:02:53] God's word and yet they didn't have they
[1:02:55] did not have the fulfillment of the of
[1:02:57] of of of the promise they all they seen
[1:03:00] was the shadows and types and and and
[1:03:02] types of what was to come but yet but
[1:03:05] yet you know one guy that that that that
[1:03:08] that we can look at at at tonight is
[1:03:11] would would be shamgar he he he was just
[1:03:14] a ordinary man he was just a farmer and
[1:03:16] year in and year out those Philistines
[1:03:18] would come and he'd raise up a crop just
[1:03:21] enough to enough to feed his family and
[1:03:22] pay his bills and the Philistines would
[1:03:24] come and take it all and just enough
[1:03:26] leave just enough for for for him to
[1:03:28] barely live the next year and this
[1:03:30] happened year in and year out and maybe
[1:03:33] and maybe maybe one year shamgar shamgar
[1:03:36] had had had had had had had had just
[1:03:39] maybe he just he had just he had just
[1:03:40] harvested his crop and said and said
[1:03:43] this year we're going to be okay we're
[1:03:44] going to make it and the and the next
[1:03:45] thing you know you heard this you
[1:03:48] you and in the distance maybe maybe
[1:03:51] maybe maybe maybe maybe he heard a bugle
[1:03:54] play and and next thing you know a trump
[1:03:56] Trump trump and up the road he he he can
[1:04:00] see him all these all those all those
[1:04:02] swords and the spears sticking up
[1:04:03] everywhere and those and those Shields
[1:04:06] and you heard it Trump Trump trump
[1:04:09] and and and maybe a fear just began to
[1:04:12] to to come a hold of him again and said
[1:04:14] not again lord I can't survive another
[1:04:16] year this and maybe he looked over at
[1:04:17] his wife and his wife was was half
[1:04:19] starved and and he looked at his
[1:04:21] children and his children were half
[1:04:23] starved and they were like how in the
[1:04:25] world are we going to survive to to to
[1:04:27] to survive the the the the the the the
[1:04:32] winner and and yet you came closer he
[1:04:34] was just like a Trump trump Trump trump
[1:04:37] all the way up and all the way up to
[1:04:40] where to where to where to
[1:04:43] where where maybe was just about to he
[1:04:46] was just about to overcome him but then
[1:04:48] it but then but then he got to thinking
[1:04:49] about it and said and said I am a
[1:04:52] circumcised child of God these are these
[1:04:55] uncircumcised
[1:04:56] these are the uncircumcised Philistines
[1:04:58] and Joshua promised me promised me back
[1:05:02] a long
[1:05:03] time time time time ago that that if I
[1:05:06] will stay in my land and if I will serve
[1:05:10] serve God then nothing can stand before
[1:05:12] me all my
[1:05:16] days and and yet maybe as that as that
[1:05:18] troop of soldiers was marching was
[1:05:20] Marching
[1:05:22] In in his yard he began to look around
[1:05:24] for a weapon to fight with
[1:05:26] and and yet and yet he had no sword he
[1:05:30] didn't have time to go to Walmart and
[1:05:31] buy a sword and and get a book on on on
[1:05:34] sword fighting for dummies he didn't
[1:05:35] have time time he he didn't have have
[1:05:40] have time have time for any of that he
[1:05:42] grabbed something that he was familiar
[1:05:43] with he grabbed he grabbed an ox code
[1:05:46] and and if us today can get something
[1:05:48] that we are familiar with without the
[1:05:50] bride of Christ when we can take a hold
[1:05:52] of this word
[1:05:56] and and yet and yet and yet shamgar
[1:05:58] grabbed that Ox code and be
[1:06:01] to he began to fight he began to swing
[1:06:03] at left and he began to swing at right
[1:06:05] and and before you know it he had slew
[1:06:07] all six all six hund hund hund hund of
[1:06:13] of those uncircumcised Philistines why
[1:06:15] because he stood in all confidence and
[1:06:17] in all Assurance knowing knowing KN
[1:06:20] knowing just just exactly who he was he
[1:06:22] said I am a circumcised size size size
[1:06:25] size child of the Living God and who are
[1:06:27] these uncircumcised sized size these
[1:06:30] uncircumcised Philistines that's that
[1:06:33] that's coming up against me why he be
[1:06:35] why why why why he he he stood upon the
[1:06:40] word of God and all confidence and in
[1:06:42] all Assurance he possessed what was his
[1:06:45] why and when Satan when Satan when Satan
[1:06:47] will will will come up against us us us
[1:06:50] us us us us us when Satan comes up when
[1:06:55] Satan comes up up against us like a
[1:06:56] flood we have nothing to turn to we have
[1:06:59] nothing to do the doctors can long can
[1:07:01] can can can can can can can can can can
[1:07:05] no longer help when it seems like our
[1:07:07] child has just gone astray and there's
[1:07:08] nothing and there's nothing else and
[1:07:10] there's nothing else to do when it seems
[1:07:12] like all were having is vehicle problems
[1:07:14] left and right and the bank's calling
[1:07:16] and wondering where their money's at and
[1:07:18] and and and maybe your accounts
[1:07:19] overdraft and you and your and your and
[1:07:21] your and you're and you're laid on rent
[1:07:23] yeah you can stand in all confidence and
[1:07:25] in all Assurance knowing just who just
[1:07:28] who just who who who who God is why why
[1:07:31] because I've seen him do it Time After
[1:07:33] Time After Time when me and my wife had
[1:07:36] first got had had had we had we had just
[1:07:38] got married I was working three jobs at
[1:07:40] the time and and Mindy had had come to
[1:07:43] me it was the night it was the night
[1:07:44] before the first and she said just I we
[1:07:46] $400

[1:08:12] still don't know what happened we have
[1:08:14] no idea how it got there God had come on
[1:08:16] the scene and we p and we paid all and
[1:08:19] and he moved in such a mighty spiritual
[1:08:20] way why because I've seen it I've seen
[1:08:23] it Time After Time After Time
[1:08:26] why because God looks after after after
[1:08:29] God looks after God looks after after
[1:08:31] after after he is own just just just
[1:08:34] just the other day actually this is this
[1:08:36] is like well it's about four or five
[1:08:37] months ago now I we we had we were
[1:08:40] supposed to I was supposed to do this
[1:08:41] job and you know I'm a contractor now
[1:08:43] and I've I've got I've got I've got um
[1:08:45] three guys that that I'm responsible for
[1:08:47] all the time and the my supper had had
[1:08:50] told me that that my sighing would be
[1:08:53] here we were starting a siding job and
[1:08:55] they told me that when you order it
[1:08:56] it'll be it'll be here within a week so
[1:08:58] week before we supposed to shop the job
[1:08:59] I went to order it and they said 6
[1:09:01] months and I'm going what do I do
[1:09:04] because now all of a sudden I had lined
[1:09:06] out these jobs for the next four or five
[1:09:08] months and I didn't know what to do and
[1:09:09] I had just paid out 15 grand for all the
[1:09:11] siding so all my money was depleted
[1:09:14] because I just I just sourced out all my
[1:09:15] money to the siding and yet they now
[1:09:17] they're telling me it's going to be a
[1:09:18] six-month weight well I didn't know what
[1:09:21] to do because now all of a sudden I'm
[1:09:22] responsible for two guys I not only have
[1:09:24] to pay my rent I have to pay their rent
[1:09:26] too so now I'm going what do I do Lord
[1:09:28] and I literally I had I had $40 I had
[1:09:33] $40 left left in my account and I didn't
[1:09:37] know what I was going to do I I put that
[1:09:39] $40 in my tank of fuel cuz I was like
[1:09:42] this is going to last me this is going
[1:09:43] to last me a couple more days I don't
[1:09:44] know what else to do and a lady I had I
[1:09:47] I prayed about I said Lord you got to
[1:09:48] help me out I don't know what to do a
[1:09:50] lady I had quoted a job for two years
[1:09:53] prior called me that day and she
[1:09:56] accepted my quote and wanted me to start
[1:09:58] on it immediately now you cannot tell me
[1:10:01] that a God who who who sees every
[1:10:04] situation and sees every hurt that we're
[1:10:06] going through does not care about us in
[1:10:08] every little tiny tiny faucet of our
[1:10:10] life well I didn't know what else to do
[1:10:12] I I told my guys I said we might have to
[1:10:14] take off I might have to let y'all go
[1:10:16] cuz I didn't know what to do cuz I cuz
[1:10:18] cuz cuz I had no more money to sat there
[1:10:20] and dump into this into another job she
[1:10:22] called me and accepted it and paid me a
[1:10:25] deposit that afternoon and we went and
[1:10:26] we went and and and and and and done the
[1:10:29] job why because God looks looks after
[1:10:31] looks after those
[1:10:33] those th those those those God looks
[1:10:36] after God looks after he his bride
[1:10:40] brother B said said said said now now
[1:10:43] everyone that has those same senses
[1:10:45] would know the same thing he said now
[1:10:46] what is faith faith is the substance of
[1:10:49] things hoped for the evidence of things
[1:10:51] not the things of things you do not see
[1:10:53] taste feel smell or hear but but it's
[1:10:55] just as real as the sense of feeling or
[1:10:57] seeing is you know what I mean he said
[1:10:59] he said he said he how many here how
[1:11:01] many here he he how many here with good
[1:11:03] sight says says says that I I got I got
[1:11:06] on that I got on a white shirt he says
[1:11:09] he says he says H how how how many how
[1:11:12] how many how how how many believes that
[1:11:14] he said he you believe that it's white
[1:11:16] shirt he said what if I told you it was
[1:11:18] red would you believe it no sir you'd
[1:11:20] say that that that that shirt was white
[1:11:21] now how many believes how many believes
[1:11:24] in in divine and divine and divine and
[1:11:26] Divine Healing how many believe that
[1:11:28] Christ he healed you back through 19
[1:11:31] 190000
[1:11:33] 1900 100 years ago when he died for you
[1:11:36] if you believe that if your faith
[1:11:37] declares that then you're healed right
[1:11:39] now just as much as the sense a sense of
[1:11:42] sight says that that's white it's over
[1:11:44] there is see it's a reality it's not
[1:11:47] just a myth it's something it's not
[1:11:49] something it's not something it's not
[1:11:51] something imagine it's actually you know
[1:11:53] it there is no doubt nowhere it's all
[1:11:56] wiped out it's
[1:11:58] gone amen so so so so so now see can see
[1:12:01] that Faith goes beyond all our five
[1:12:02] senses that taste feel uh smell hear and
[1:12:06] see they declare to you your senses
[1:12:08] declare to you what is happening what is
[1:12:10] what is happening around you your sins
[1:12:12] but but yet but yet even though with
[1:12:13] these senses that that God has given us
[1:12:15] these senses can fail us sometimes you
[1:12:17] can be pretty sure that you see
[1:12:19] something I don't know if uh any of
[1:12:22] y'all have um have have have have ever
[1:12:27] have if you you all have have have ever
[1:12:30] hunted but you you s you sat there in
[1:12:33] your tree stand and you see something
[1:12:35] move and you're you're pretty sure
[1:12:37] that's a deer and yet and and then you
[1:12:38] hear something that's that's that's that
[1:12:41] walks across the leaves and you're
[1:12:42] pretty sure that you're hearing a deer
[1:12:44] you know and so you get all excited you
[1:12:46] might grab your gone and and get ready
[1:12:47] cuz you know it's a deer and two minutes
[1:12:49] later a scroll steps out why because
[1:12:51] because because because because because
[1:12:53] because you're pretty sure that that
[1:12:54] that's what seen but yet your senses can
[1:12:57] can fail you how many
[1:13:00] times have you men H have you men men
[1:13:04] have have your men W walked in the house
[1:13:08] after a long day of work and you smell
[1:13:09] something you say that smells like fried
[1:13:11] chicken and he walk in the kitchen and
[1:13:13] his meatloaf why because because your
[1:13:15] senses it can fail you even though you
[1:13:17] might be 100% sure that that's what it
[1:13:19] is it can still fail
[1:13:23] you but yet but but yet when but but but
[1:13:26] yet when you see something that's 100%
[1:13:29] sure just as sure as my shirt's white
[1:13:31] white why why why why here tonight and
[1:13:35] yet and yet you through faith can step
[1:13:37] out and and you and you and you see that
[1:13:40] the same attributes that Christ died for
[1:13:41] 2,000 years ago is the same as as
[1:13:44] salvation is the same as as as as as as
[1:13:49] as your as you're healing tonight it's
[1:13:50] the same is the same senses the same
[1:13:52] attributes that says that and says by my
[1:13:54] strife I am healed yet are that ye were
[1:13:57] that ye were that ye were that ye were
[1:13:59] healed why why and you can you can you
[1:14:03] can set set there set there and watch
[1:14:06] and watch your healing your healing take
[1:14:07] place watch watch watch your deliverance
[1:14:10] take place we may not have need a need
[1:14:12] of healing tonight you may not have a
[1:14:14] need or
[1:14:17] or you you you you may not have a need
[1:14:20] for healing tonight but you may have a
[1:14:22] need to overcome you may need a
[1:14:24] Deliverance you may need a family member
[1:14:26] that needs salvation you may have
[1:14:27] financial problems but Faith declares
[1:14:30] that it's over faith says 2,000 years
[1:14:32] ago Christ died on on Calvary and we are
[1:14:35] right now we are hirs and we are joint
[1:14:38] heirs
[1:14:39] with we are joint HS with Christ we can
[1:14:42] sign the check and take it to the
[1:14:44] bank why in all confidence and in all
[1:14:47] Assurance knowing that that Christ will
[1:14:50] fulfill every promise fulfill every
[1:14:52] promise that he has spoken faith is an
[1:14:54] individ idual sense besides be be be be
[1:14:57] besides besides anything else brother
[1:14:59] Bown called it a sixth sense that's the
[1:15:01] outside man and God put him him and and
[1:15:05] and and and and when when when when when
[1:15:10] God when God created man and put put him
[1:15:12] in in a human flesh here and and he he
[1:15:15] given us these five senses to contact to
[1:15:17] contact our our our our our our home
[1:15:22] but but yet the Inside Man the Spirit
[1:15:25] has two senses and and that is unbelief
[1:15:27] and it's faith and and and when your
[1:15:30] faith says that you're going to be
[1:15:31] healed the same the same as you site
[1:15:33] says that I have on a white suit or a
[1:15:37] white shirt and a and a blue suit on
[1:15:39] it's over for faith is the substance of
[1:15:42] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[1:15:44] things that you do not see taste feel
[1:15:46] smell or hear why
[1:15:49] why yeah we cannot accept our healing we
[1:15:52] cannot accept our Salvation or or or
[1:15:55] or the Deliverance until until until
[1:15:58] until we believe
[1:16:00] that and and you've got and you've got
[1:16:03] to believe on it and you got to stand on
[1:16:05] that on that promise and and take God
[1:16:07] and take
[1:16:08] God at his word at his word at his word
[1:16:12] at his word before before before
[1:16:16] before it lack it can't happen until you
[1:16:20] first believe it accept it and confess
[1:16:22] it right and brother random said said he
[1:16:25] he he said take a woman he said come
[1:16:27] here come to the altar here or a man and
[1:16:29] and let them be ever so vile that they
[1:16:31] could scream and cry and walk up and
[1:16:33] down the altar saying God forgive me
[1:16:35] forgive me forgive me day in and day out
[1:16:37] and they just keep on pacing Lord I've
[1:16:38] repented I've done everything I can do
[1:16:41] he he said they'll keep pacing pacing
[1:16:44] until the hour when in their hearts they
[1:16:47] believe it and and and then confess it
[1:16:49] and when they confess it he go he he he
[1:16:52] goes he goes he goes he goes he goes to
[1:16:54] work on it and he cannot intercede for
[1:16:56] you until first you confess that it is
[1:16:59] already done by faith for he is the high
[1:17:01] priest of your
[1:17:02] confession and and and and so we we can
