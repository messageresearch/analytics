Jesus Christ thank you musicians God bless you I'm humbled to be here tonight and be with you with my wife we just happen to be in the area and and uh called wanted to be with brother Sean and just maybe have a cup of coffee with him he said well we're having service tonight so we thought we'd sneak in and sit in the back brother Sean and now I'm up here I'm not used to using a handheld but we'll figure that all out too so all this is kind of new to me and new to you but the Lord knows all things amen I just say want to say what an honor it is to be here with brother Sean I appreciate him I've always appreciated the Martin family and what they mean to to us and our walk with the Lord amen God he the Bible says God ascended up on high and he gave gifts unto men and I believe brother Sean is a gift Amen to the world and sister Heather we go way way back in Prescott when sister Heather was there with her sister and your man brother Josiah and Daniel and so many of our friends here God bless you all it's just a pleasure and an honor to be with you I think this was youth night right and all the young people there who was our drummer was it where's that little guy at amen was that your son was that well God bless him amen God is good amen has the Lord done great things for you in your in your life where would we be without the Lord Jesus you know sometimes we don't appreciate and it's sometimes you have to go my wife and I were talking the other day about Samson how did he didn't know what it was not to have the power he just always when the you know the the lion come out he tore him apart when when they trapped him in Gaza he just picked up the gates and so he started playing with Delilah he didn't know what it was brother Sean did not have the power until he had forfeited it Eve didn't know what death was amen it would be a shame that we would walk without the Lord or somewhere have to backslide to appreciate being in the house of the Lord amen have the presence of the Lord the freedom of the Holy Spirit we have a sister in our church she visits China her parents her mother's in China and they don't have the ability to to meet together they kind of have to meet in an apartment meant they can't sing brother Sean they just whisper they can't worship they can't and we have the ability in America to praise God to shout and scream and glorify him he would be a shame brother Daniel we'd have to go to a communist Nation before we'd ever appreciate being able to Worship the Lord amen I believe uh there in the Psalms he said let everything that hath breath praise the Lord so I don't know what God's will is for my life well I know one thing if you're breathing God's will is for you to praise the Lord and Worship the Lord and lift up holy hands in the house of the Lord I want to lift my hands to the Lord Jesus let's just pray together Heavenly Father Lord we lift our hands to you tonight Lord father we need you Lord Jesus father we pray in this dark and evil world that we live in that you would feel Lord welcome to come Among Us Lord we invite you in your presence we've sung about you Lord and now we open the word of God and pray Lord that you would come Among Us in a supernatural way Lord I believe in a supernatural God lord I believe you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord I believe you want to touch Our Lives I believe you want to heal our bodies I believe you want to show yourself this the the almighty God come Among Us Lord in a special way and help us Lord you know each need father Lord I this was not orchestrated by man but you've just brought these things together and I pray that you would speak to us you would help us Lord you would encourage us along the way Lord maybe something would be said to encourage us along this road that we're walking father bless us today blessed brother Sean and sister Heather there and the ministers Lord and the deacons and trustees may you just bless the service we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles I want to read in two places Saint John chapter 15 and also in Colossians don't you love your Bible amen people say well hey people have a lot of experiences with God and we had a message that came in our day and said if your experience doesn't match the word of God Amen you better put the word of God first and I appreciate that about brother Sean and the Martin family they've always loved the Bible and loved the word of God I love a church that believes in the message of the hour you all don't seem to be ashamed of putting a prophet's message up there and most people think well that's just picture brother Brandon well you missed the main part was the pillar of fire the pillar fire came down and Vindicated a Ministry in our day there's all kinds of voices all kinds of Ministries all kinds of podcasts and videos and all of those things but God come down and said I'm going to vindicate a man amen that you might know what message to listen to in the last day and I'm just here not to bring a message God already Vindicated a message I'm here to tell you it's the truth I'm here to tell you that God you're doing the right thing you're doing the right thing by believing this message and going to a church that believes the message of the hour Saint John chapter 15 just one verse here in Saint John verse chapter 15 verse 16. ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you is that in red in your Bible how many have a Red Letter Bible Jesus didn't speak and read letters but somebody had this idea like let's take the letter the words of Jesus and put them in red and Jesus said to you you haven't chosen me but I've chosen you now I ask you we could just take right there we could just take that and say God chose me Jesus chose me he told me he chose me amen but he had a reason for that and he chose you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain what is your fruit it's your testimony it's your life he said I want your fruit and your testimony to remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it thee we got to read verse 17 don't we these things have I commanded you that you love one another that's not one of the 10 suggestions that's a commandment I've commanded you must love one another now he didn't say you got to agree with one another so many times we have this in America if I can't say I love you because we disagree on something well I'm here to tell you we're probably not always going to see things eye to eye but one thing we have a commandment we got to love one another amen go back to Colossians behind that Colossians chapter 1. this Bible is God in letter form it's God in letter form holy men of God were moved by the Holy Ghost which is the eternal spirit of God and they wrote this Bible Colossians 1 verse 15. who is the end of Isabel let's back up to verse 13. who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth invisible visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him by him and for him so if he chose you he created you the Bible says all things were created by Him but they were also created for him so if God created you you were created for Jesus Christ that you might bring forth fruit verse 17. he is before all things and by him all things consist all things are held together wouldn't that mean a nation that we have is held together by Christ so when you ask Christ to leave your schools to leave your church he's the word right so when you ask the word to leave your church then the churches don't consist they're not held together our society we had a President Obama that went 20 times around the world and said America is no longer a Christian Nation and so when we've asked him to leave and not be our god it doesn't consist and we see it falling apart or educational system our military our financial system because the Bible says by Jesus Christ everything is held together and I'm going to preach right through this all right this is my savior this is Jesus Christ this is the this man here is Mount the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 that Jesus sent behold I send you Elijah the prophet that would bring us a message and turn our hearts back to Jesus Christ not to William Branham to Jesus Christ and he was before all things all things were created by Him and for him he is my savior he is my redeemer I'm trying to get you to Jesus Christ any true man of God is trying to get you to Jesus Christ as our Savior by him all things consist he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell amen may God add his Blessing to the word you may be seated amen I might read two more verses there if you still have your Bibles keep your Bibles close I'm a Bible believer that's the name of our church back home Bible Believers so we believe the Bible what we believe comes from the Bible Brandon brought a message it wasn't a new message from a cloud out here it was the already written word revealed they told Brother Randolph said brother bam you could write the 23rd chapter of Revelation you could do it with all the Miracles and signs and wonders he said no no I can't do it because the Bible says if you add to the book or you take away from the book your part will be taken from the book of light for the plagues will be added to you so what we believe has to come from the scripture so if I teach you something that's not in the scripture you don't have to believe it but if I breathe if I bring something from the word of God then you have to believe it man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and I know you have a pastor that believes this amen I know he believes the word of God verse number 26 let's go down Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make no one what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory it was a mystery before but now it's been revealed in this day what is it it's Christ inside of you Christ in you the hope of glory a great Revelation brother and preaches a message called the token amen he tells us as the holy spirit is not not a sensation it's not an emotion it brings a sensation it brings an emotion but it's the very literal life of Jesus Christ Living inside of an individual now that's just not something we just say or a tingle up the spine but it's something a very sober seriousness to say I have the life of Jesus Christ Living inside of me I tell you that's a sober Revelation it'll cure road rage it'll cure it's an anger management cure when you're like Daddy is that really the Life of Christ so they asked brother Branham in questions and answers they said I've got a temper and how do I he said sweeten your temper with prayer so when that little boy says daddy daddy you need to go pray whatever's coming out of you isn't the Life of Christ you need to go swim Sweden you see how serious it is when you say I've got the Holy Ghost you say I have the token I have the life of Jesus Christ oh may God help us it's more than just amen running and shouting Niles which we all believe in that because that Life of Christ will produce an emotion anything that doesn't have any motion we better bury it right amen so it should have an emotion we got too much dead religion laying around even around our message I said Lord bring me alive amen you hath he quickened who are Once Dead and sin and trespasses it should Quicken us way away from a life of sin and evil amen and bring it to us a life that's a living amen that's the thought I want to bring tonight if we would take chosen to bring forth fruit chosen to bring forth fruit as we read here in the scripture Christ is the image of the invisible God and brother Rand preaches this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he tells us that all of the Psalms and all of the scriptures portrayed Jesus Christ amen the invisible God and now God became flesh yeah we were talking the other day and and my wife and I've portrayed the Trinity and I I was raised um I was talking to brother Sean in the back room brother Wendell had posted uh had just mentioned something just the the background of where he'd been and his his father I appreciated their father wonderfully and the path that they journeyed through the denominations and the Pentecost and into a great message and the the power of this message and how it brought such a depth and stability to our lives how's the one man said I got tired of going to church every day to prove to myself that I was saved and to prove to everybody else that I would say because of some emotion amen and it went deeper than that that I was an attribute in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Galatians says because you were Sons he sent forth the spirit of his sons to find you all that the father hath given me they will come to me amen and so what what is it it's yielding to the Holy Spirit that's drawing at our heart I say Lord Here I Am Lord and I yield all all of my life to you Lord and receiving the holy spirit is as easy as yielding to God and say Lord Here I Am Lord take anything that's not like you Lord take it out on me and fill me with the Holy Spirit how many would like to be filled with the Holy Spirit tonight say Lord just baptize me from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet Lord you've chosen me and you've not just chosen me to say I'm chosen but you've chosen me to thou I might bear fruit that I might bear fruit and there's something about it I see our brother here how old are you brother 75 years old now they get a little older the devil tell you look you're all washed up you're nothing but I'm here to tell you there's this magic is all right if I just share a few things from my heart you know that there's a there's this come a magical age and I don't know where it is brother Sean but you can say anything and people just they don't persecute you you don't lose your job you don't lose Social Security you can just say anything so when the devil tells you washed up you say no I'm getting close to that age where I can witness for the Lord and and the barbershop I can win sir the Lord on an airplane I can witness for the Lord in the grocery store and it came as a revelation to me one day we were flying on an airplane and this lady said Merry Christmas and I'm too old to care if I offend anybody and I thought you know that is you get to that age the devil says look you can but you can just say anything you say Jesus Christ is my savior the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from all sins this world in our nation is held together by Jesus Christ what are they going to do to you step on your oxygen and hoes oh we're going to live and be a light for the Lord and shine a light as long as we can when we sing that little song This Little Light of Mine I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna let it shine I'm gonna let it shine in the darker and the darker it gets the greater and greater the light shines you can be in this room and maybe turn on a little light and it doesn't do much but I tell you you turn all the lights out here you can take this light on this on this pack right here this little green light and you could take that little green light and shine in here and it'll illuminate you can almost find your way and we're living in such a dark hour whatever little light you got just shine it just shine it amen we sing that little song Take the name of Jesus with you when you get in trouble just say the name of Jesus Jesus amen because there's power in the name of Jesus when you say Jesus the devil flees he hates the name of Jesus I learned that years ago there's two things the devil hates he hates the name of Jesus Christ and he hates the blood of Jesus Christ because we read it we're made nigh by the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ not by some Revelation in our mind but amen by the blood of Jesus Christ and faith in Jesus Christ now we don't realize it but we're living by faith we just talk about it they talk about these movies that all the movies now have uh have some type of magic or or witchcraft in them and the devil's just catching up that that the devil and his perversion but you know what we've been walking around shaking people's hand and saying God bless you I put a blessing on you I put a blessing if we've been doing that for years have we not we should have been and they're coming around and cursing people and cursing people and cursing people amen they're just really late you know they come out with these movies called zombies walking or whatever the people but the Bible you go away back in the Bible the Bible says she that is dead and she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she yet lives so the devil is just making movies about what God has told us many many years ago oh I love the word of God I love being a part of it I I'm there's great power brother Sean and knowing that he chose us and he didn't choose us on a particular night amen he chose us before the foundation of the world and he made a list and he put our names on it amen putting names on it on that list and you say I don't remember those verses well this is the way you remember I got a bad memory so I got all these crutches you know so people like oh I gotta crutch I'm trying to get along like we all have crutches I've got contacts in my eyes and I can't drive I can barely get around my house without my my vision so bad brother Sean I put these contacts in and it helps me and maybe you've got a little crutch and maybe take a little medicine or something it helps you get through life right maybe we can all sing Perfect Pitch and we have a piano or a keyboard it helps us get through our song service right so we have these little things but our goal is to bear fruit if I need a little crutch along the way I'll get a little crutch along the way to to lead me and help me through this life I'm just you know we we start at zero over here a little timeline you children we start at zero and Bible says by reason of you know it's three score and ten which is 70 and by reason of strength 80 years old and I call them bonus years after that you get those bonus years 100 and 110 you know we're all just trying to make it from the Cradle to the Grave right we're just trying to make it if somewhere in there the Lord comes in a Rapture we're going in a Rapture I need all the help that I can to get me through this life can you say Amen to that something somebody sings a little song like and we get to this little mind and say like I don't agree with them so I'm going to throw that out no no no no no no if it helps us along the way I think brother Brown said it he said it's a selfish uh jealousy spirit that won't acknowledge a chiropractor or the surgeon or or somebody that helps uh make life a little easier for somebody hey man I think that's what we ought to do is just make life a little easier for somebody try to help them along the way there's enough hurting people in this world true I got this sign on my wallet says people are fighting a battle that you know nothing nothing about how many times brother Sean we've come to services and have a prayer and people come up pray and say this was my last service I was done I was going out but God has a way of catching us amen the God has a way of finding you wherever you go Psalms 139 he says if I had to send down into hell Thou Art there if I go up to heaven Thou Art there amen wherever I go he's there he knows how to find us amen he knows where we are he's got our number as we say he's got our number and he knows where to find us even he brings a guy from Indiana comes down and speaks something maybe we don't know anything about but God I don't know you you don't need me know me but God knows you he knows all about us he knows every tear we've cried he knows every heartache he knows every pain that we've suffered amen he come to bind up the brokenhearted tonight maybe you're bearing a heavy burden in your heart but he knows all about it amen he knows every tear that you've cried every heartache every pain that you're going through he's a high priest that can be touched by our feelings of our infirmative this we preach so much against feelings but the Bible uses that word he said he's a high priest who can be touched by our feelings Lord I feel lonely tonight Lord I feel afraid tonight Lord I don't know what I'm going to do about social security Lord I don't know what I'm going to do about this situation oh it just doesn't come to lay people it comes to ministers away Lord I don't know what I'm going to do about that I don't have all the answers Lord I need you Lord no papa God will you hold my hand will you strengthen me will you help me and if God be for us who could ever be against us greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world do you believe that tonight I believe it because it's the word of God even when I don't believe it I believe the word of God I believe God's word is true and everybody that believed God's word they came out all right in the end I don't know any of the names of the people that were outside the ark but I know him sham and japon amen I know the name of Noah I don't know any of those people that died when the Red Sea closed up I know Pharaoh's name is just in a disgrace that God raised him up and hardened his heart but I know Moses I know Jude I know Levi I know Miriam I know are you with me tonight I say let's just believe God's word hey man I'm not really smart but there's one thing better than learning from your mistakes is learn from somebody else's mistakes like it didn't come out well for those that stood against the message of the hour it didn't come out well for those people Nathan and Cora they withstood Moses and God just opened up the Earth that's that that's a sign of worldliness the world worldliness opens up and swallows people up how many people you try to see they try to withstand the ministry of God's Prophet don't don't you don't have to defend it God will defend himself in their day the World opened up and pretty soon uh immorality and unholiness and and shorts and all the filth of the world to just swallows them up and then you say where's they thin Cora they're they're not what something swallow the Earth worldliness swallowed them up oh may God help us to stay with the message of the hour howdy said who who is on the Lord's Side let him come to me how do you say who is on the side of this revealed word let him come to the word and stand by it amen was it a was it Rebecca that he was she came there and was watering that Camel amen she was watering a power a beast is a power she was watering a power and that was the power that took her to meet her bridegroom and we're watering a power of the word of God and the Holy Spirit can you say Amen coming to church on a Saturday night Sunday night and raising our hands and worshiping and feeding the power of God and that power Hallelujah is going to carry us one day to meet our bridegroom Jesus Christ and you'll be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye caught up to meet the Lord in the air oh amen I believe it's three kinds of Believers brother random said no matter how old the story gets there is a literal Jesus Christ that will come someday and take a people home he said that's what Believers believe I say that's what Believers believe you I know there's a lot of revelation we believe he came as the son of man who revealed himself as a word amen but it's no different and people get caught up between the you know the the the the shout the voice and the trumpet I tell you let me just explain it this way when the shout come it was such a great thing after 2000 years if not the shout was such a powerful manifestation of God there was ministers and preachers like wow this this is it there's nothing else there this is so this is a and it was the coming of the Lord in in Revelation of the word but the second part about the the voice that raises the dead is going to be another great great part when they raise in the dead and Grandpa and Grandma and they come and they they're sitting there that'll be a just as great as the shout do you believe it it's the Bible listen to the Revelation the message the Rapture I know when we're caught up and we meet the Lord in the air amen and brother around said that's something that you feel in your heart that delivered you from drugs and alcohol and evil desires and that feeling that whatever that was he said someday you'll you'll feel it come into the room and you look into it'll be Jesus Christ oh blessed be the name of the Lord I'm looking for that day brother Sean amen the Bible tells us amen he'll come he'll wipe every tear from our eye amen he said all the old things will pass away all things will be new amen he'll wipe the tears he said there'll be no more sorrow there'll be no more tears ain't no mother may no more pain there'll be no more suffering how do you know brother Daniel because it says it in the book amen it says it in the book I I got to tell you I read the back of the book I did I read the back of the book and we win brother Sean we win why are you preaching tonight brother Daniel because I read the back of the book and those that are with Christ they win in the end don't go to the way little lady you see it don't go to the world and the Fashions of the world if you love the world the things of the world the love of God's not even in you well stay with the author of the book he chose us and ordained us to bring forth fruit to bring forth a testimony say Lord I'm gonna stay with you blessed be the name of the Lord I my things timing out here I don't know praise the Lord amen many scriptures if you have your Bibles Luke keep them Close to You Luke chapter 10 read a few scriptures here Luke chapter 10 I love ministry that's in the Bible amen too much Ministry sometimes gets outside of the Bible but we need to stay in the Bible amen sometimes like I said some people want to get a great Revelations outside the Bible they forget that this message all came from the Bible brother random said now another Revelation because the opening of The Seven Seals and he said now turn in your Bible amen the word of God is a seed and so the prophet of God came and he took the revelation of serpent seed or predestination or the son of man or all these great future homes the God of this evil age and he'd say turn in your Bible and then the word of God became manifest it began to grow and grow and he preached a three-hour sermon and the other day I listened to spoken word as the Original Seed a six-hour message and it's such a powerful powerful thing I've been studying the Ministries because brother randoms wasn't the only Healing Ministry there was A.A Allen and Jack Cole and Oral Roberts and so I went back and thought wow what does brother random listen in 1962 if you'll go back and read it it's it's interesting if you take Jesus ministry with three and a half years right the son of man and so if you take from 1962 it kind of started there in the in in uh in around March or April Berlin preaches the spoken word his Original Seed he said I'm gonna I owe it to you all to show you why my Ministry is on the decline he preaches a six-hour message he said there's three kinds of seeds that have been sown one is the denominational C he said that's Billy Graham he said one is the Pentecostal charismatic movement which is Oral Roberts isn't it amazing that oral means from your voice and oral something that spoke or Oral Roberts it was the Pentecostal movie where they believed speaking in tongues was the evidence the Holy Spirit and he said the third seed is the word of God and he said now all these seeds have been sown he said now we're going to wait for a crop to come up and we see the denominations begin to rise up and then we saw the the Pentecostal movement all went to a charismatic Jesus only movement a glossiola that I don't have time to preach the whole thing and he said but there's a word bride there's a word that's been sown as well there's a people that believe that everything we believe has got to come from the Bible and he said now these two seeds the denomination and the Pentecostal he said they'll merge together amen all together but he said show me where they're in the scripture show me water baptism in Jesus name show me Holiness in there a woman to cut her hair when Paul's all that she just a woman Paul was a woman hater Paul said If any man think himself to be spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of God so he had a prophet amen he preached the word of God and said everything we preach and believe has to come from the scripture amen oh no don't you love doesn't that give you a strength to know that what I believe comes from the Bible we were just in Salt Lake City I had to go up to see um we were up on vacation there in Utah and I thought well we'll just go to salta Lake City and I've seen the whole Joseph Smith and heard the whole story and he got an amazing story but what as I think brother Raymond said this evening he said I don't doubt that an angel came to Joseph Smith he said but what the angel said to Joseph Smith was contrary to the scripture and they had to write another Bible to vindicate their message we didn't have to write a Bible amen the prophet of God said go back and read your Bible the Bible says I will put enmity between your seed and the serpent seed the prophet of God just said read it serpent seed didn't come from William random it came from the Bible he just said go back and read it there's no place in the Bible that anybody was baptized in the titles of Father Son and Holy Spirit he said go back and read your Bible again everywhere they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and if there is wisdom I'm just preaching the Bible okay and if there was somebody that was baptized any other way than in the name of Jesus Christ Acts chapter 19 they had to go back and be re-baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that they would receive the Holy Spirit oh isn't that wonderful to know what you believe comes right from the Bible and say oh well you all are long hair long skirts Prophet y'all are a cult well I don't care what you call me Paul has said in the way that's called heresy so worshiped by the god of our fathers amen we worship Jesus Christ amen Luke chapter 10 verse 21. the Bible says in this hour in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank thee Oh Lord oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemeth good in thy sight you mean that God would actually hide something and say it was be good yes that's what the Bible says but in another place he said blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear I ask you tonight what are you doing in this building we make this thing so complicated amen the Bible says no man can come except the father draws him but something has drawn you to come to church tonight can you say Amen to that unless you're five years old and Mommy and Daddy brought you because they know in the presence of God every seed will manifest what it is and we keep and that's the thing if kids get out and they date and this and that or whatever but you know the Bible says what is it um Hebrews chapter 4 12 everything is naked and bare in the sight of God so you bring into the presence of God and it'll manifest whatever seed is there it just meant it doesn't change the seed it just manifests what's is inside of it I mean there's something about the presence of God Amen it's the water there's something about the sunlight which is the word of God and it shines and every seed begins to manifest amen manifest what it is that we got around our message and my wife and I were listening to it this morning uh brother random when he first got among the Pentecostal people he said I was standing there and they were speaking in tongues he said I didn't I'd never he said that was the first time I encountered he tells it in his life story man speaking in tongues and another one interpreting he said I had a gift I got close to him found out one was a real man of God the other one was living in adultery brother bam said I didn't understand that he said I just kind of got away from him he didn't speak against it he just kind of got away from it a little bit but then later on he realized that the rain falls on the just and it falls on the unjust now he preached a message called The False anointed ones at the end time actually and it was the anointed ones that took down and so we we around our message we get so worried about the false annoying ones at the end time we don't want any rain to fall but I can tell you the predestinated sea will never grow if they don't get the rain I said send down the rain Lord send down the rain Lord I need the rain Lord I want to grow I want to be manifested I want to grow and produce fruit you'll never produce fruit without the rain I got a message called let it rain let it rain we need the rain Lord and let's stop worrying about if that brother's a terror that sister's a terror and everything about their life that's okay if they're not right God will lead them and guide them into all truth that's the evidence the Holy Spirit when he the spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all truth oh what a rest that is to every one of them say well this brother isn't right or that's that church is this but if they are children of God and they have the Holy Spirit it will lead them it will guide them into all truth now you may be up in ninth grade or tenth grade spiritually I might just be in third grade but you have patience with me and you believe that I got the spirit of God and if I don't see it just right just like brother manham didn't understand he walked away and then God revealed it to him oh the rain falls on the just and it falls on the unjust alike we just got to stay in the rain we got to stay in the rain too many times we see somebody I mean they like well I know that brother or that sister they're not living right and then they well I'm just going to stop going to church I'm I'm not going to go to those meetings anymore I'm not because I've seen a tearing but you don't realize it's the rain we need the rain send down the rain Lord Brother around says this in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed if a man says he's born again and try to place these promises of God and some in these last days in some other age making him Christ yesterday but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by Satan so Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen if that man says he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself through him Jesus said Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe into all the world in every age casting out Devils speaking with tongues and all the great manifestations of the gifts that would follow that they shall not they may or they ought to but they will heavens and earth will pass away but my word want won't brother Branham goes on to say if you have your Bibles let's go to Saint John chapter 14. I bring greetings from Brother Brad Burgess back home in Louisville actually I said Louisville the other day we just God blessed us we moved to Indiana God blessed us with the church so we moved back across the back into Indiana so I bring greetings from Brother Brad and I know brother Sean's been there been a great blessing brother Sean's Ministry has had such an impact on our life I remember a few Easters ago he preached on the prodigal son and just to come down to the close talking about the prodigal son and it's amazing how these Ministries how how the Bible says in in Isaiah that line upon line word upon word service upon service sermon upon sermon God is adding and building amen a spiritual habitation for God to dwell in you have a physical body but you also have a spiritual body if I would ask you hey who taught you that the third letter of the alphabet was C I don't remember but I just know it right so we have these things it's like mixing the ingredients to make bread and then you say okay where's the flour where's the eggs no it's all mixed up together and God has put Ministries in our lives I mean maybe you come to church and God uses a little drummer boy was it you Drummond all right he's beating on something over and making Rhythm amen and God adds and this and this and this and it's all ministering to make us alive and make us a Christian today are you alive today can you raise your hand hey yeah we've all got Sorrows we've all been through hard things and Paul said forgetting those things that are behind let's press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ I'm alive tonight can you say that I'm Alive Tonight I'm a Christian tonight I've got heartaches and pains and sufferings have been through church problems on all kinds of problems but I'm Alive Tonight I'm a Christian tonight what's that that's got to mean something that's got to be worth something I don't know about tomorrow's I got problems tomorrow's got some big problems but that's not how's the Bible say sufficient unto the day is the evil of a and as the day is social your strength be your strength whatever happens tomorrow God will give us strength you believe that whatever happens tomorrow God's going to be there for you God never opened the Red Sea till Moses got to the Red Sea we want to is it in Egypt and say I want to see all the way to the promised land and then I'll leave Egypt no just take one step at a time amen footsteps mean possession foot accepts me in possession say brother Dan I'm so low I feel like I'm the soul of the bottom of the body of Christ but you're still a part of the body of Christ you're still a part of the body of Christ I might be the least of the least but when this body makes a step amen I'm a part of it amen when it takes another step I'm a part of it and man we're not living back in the 60s we're not living in the 70s anymore some of you have been around a long time this is 2000 2023 and by now we should start seeing fruit we should start seeing mature Christians amen that are not blowing about with every wind of Doctrine can you say Amen to that some churches are tied to their Pastor come on somebody say Amen Pastor makes a mistake and backside the whole church backslide you weren't tied to Christ my job as a minister is to get you so tied to Jesus Christ amen that you will no matter what happens to me you'll be tied to Jesus Christ I don't have a church age book around here but there's a last paragraph in the church age book brother M said I have no desire to start a church or a fellowship or an organization he said I have one desire and he said that is to see a relationship between God and man I believe he had a pure desire amen he had a pure desire that you would have a relationship with God you get down on your knees and say Lord I love you Lord forgive me of my sins Lord God would send back the witness of the Holy Ghost that you'd feel the power of God can you say Amen you feel the witness the same as Simpson felt a witness oh he made mistakes and he was grinding at the Mill but there's one thing the devil forgot his hair began to grow back amen he began to be restored back to almighty God and his hair grew back and when he grew back he said you lead me to the pillars lead me to the Strong place what was he saying Lord lead me back to the place of what I'm supposed to do I'm supposed to destroy these Philistines amen and what did he do he started praying he's put his hands on the pillars they said Lord remember me Lord remember me is that your desire tonight like Samson he might have made mistakes we all made mistakes we can get back like Samson Lord get me in the presence of God get me to where I'm supposed to be and say Lord Remember Me Lord strengthen me Lord avenge me of my enemies and he pushed the pillars down and it fell in his in his death he killed more than he did in his whole life oh may God strengthen us tonight may he avenge us amen of our enemies no matter how old we are to what we're going through say Lord avenge me let me rise and bear fruit you say brother Daniel I've been stinted in my growth and things have deformed me I'm going to preach God's power of transformation right here is that okay brother random said as long as that seed stays in the channel it'll grow and mature but some things lean against it and it gets deformed and it grows out of the way but there's something about it when you cut away that thing that's deformed it will always grow back to the sun it will always point back toward the Sun I've got this little devious thing about my nature my wife has these plants and they all grow towards the window toward the Sun and I do this little thing I take it and I turn it all the way around and it's this way then you come back in the room a few days later and it's completely turned back towards the sun you can take a knock down a Son of God you can let something deform them or or kind of push them a different way can you say Amen to that I guess we're all living in a day where we've encountered technology in our life and I wish it was all good but the Bible says it's a tree of Good and Evil and so sometimes those things deform us and turn us away from the Sun and we find ourselves but there's something about a son and daughter of God when they find themselves turned away from the Sun amen there's something in them that causes them to look back towards the Sun and then grow towards the Son of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord I want to grow towards the Son of God tonight if there's something that's pulling you away say Lord speak to me Lord I've got turned aside I got turned away but Lord turn me back that I can grow towards the Son of God oh blessed be the name of the Lord my son used to sing a song it's called you probably heard it called Take Me To The Cross take me into the cross it's a little story about a man that had a little child and he said look this is a little Country Town and he said but down in this Valley you all got these valleys over in in West Virginia and West Virginia and Rural down in the valley he said Son now when you get down here if you ever get lost he said the highest thing in this city is this cross and it's on top of this church if you ever get lost you tell whoever's there say take me to the cross then the song goes on to say how many times we've got lost in our life maybe feel like a snowball that's rolling down the hill and then you just stop somewhere and the song says no matter where you find yourself just say take me to the cross take me to the cross of Jesus Christ where if I confess my sins he's faithful and just to forgive me of my sins and cleanse me from all righteousness say brother Daniel you're living in a snowball and all of a sudden it doesn't matter just take me to the Cross take me to the presence of God take me to the witness of the Holy Spirit when I can cry in his presence and cry oh Abba Father Lord I didn't ask to come into this thing you came and came looking for me amen he said how the the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost am I quoting scripture tonight seeking to save that which was lost these people they have the idea that Jesus died on the cross he ascended up told a bunch of disciples tried to go tell this sob story and then God comes down at the end and okay all the people that believe the story about me get nails in my hand you're my kids come on that's that's a nice denominational idea but that's not Bible the Bible says the son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost there's a group of names that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life Hebrews chapter 13 8 that's what I was getting too early Hebrews 13 8 the way you remember that is Revelations 13 8 all will be deceived whose names are not written on the Lamb's Book of Life mentions it again in Revelations chapter 17 verse 8 the same as Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever it's Revelations 13 8 there was a group of names before the foundational world that were written down and he said the son of man came and said oh I need Sean Martin I think I'll go find Sean and any Daniel Daniel Andes what's your name Levi that's a really good name Levi and I believe Levi's name is on the Lamb's Book of Life and so the son of man is coming and seeking to save him and dealing with Levi's heart and touching his heart and touching and he's beginning to manifest some kind of fruit he's not in a bar somewhere tonight and playing like oh look at that little guy playing the drums on no he's manifesting a Godly fruit how old are you Levi eight years old in a few years he'll be 12 years old like Jesus was and they turned him loose that's an amazing thing to see what kind of life since I just turned something loose does it meow like a cat or does it raise its tail and spray you like a skunk and whatever it manifests buy their fruits we'll know what they are so they turn Jesus loose I think it was three days they turned his 12 year old kid loose where'd they find him back in the synagogue back in the church said I must be about my father's business at 12 years old he's about his father's business amen blessed be the name of the Lord I want to go back because this just comes to mind I was studying those thoughts about the the different Ministries and so this man I forget where we were and and I saw this man he was ministering he was talking about the trinity and I had given this illustration before and this and this man got up and he spoken and he said it and he said basically the father comes to the son and said son we got a sin problem down there on Earth I need you to go down and there's only one person that can take care of that and that's you and sometimes we don't realize that maybe we're raised hero is with the Lord your God is one God scriptures and Timothy there great is the mystery of Godless God was manifested in the flesh right was it Saint John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Saint John 1 14 and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us that's what we believe from the Bible but go on the other side and realize how complex it is if you're a trinitarian even to pray a prayer because if you believe there's three equal part Persons Of God you can't acknowledge the sun without the great father or the father without acknowledging you got to remember this when you're praying and father we and then you're like the son the Holy Spirit and so when you think about this idea of this old man that come up with this idea of the earth and a perfect Earth and children on it and just right off the bat the thing went astray and it all fell and it got all messed up and he looked over and said son I made a mess down there um will you go down and and and and and die for those people I made a mess but you go down and die and let and clean that up and I know it's going to be difficult but I'll send this little Dove he'll flop around you this little Holy Spirit he'll help you on encouragement doesn't that just sound no no no but great is a mystery of God's God the great Eternal God had a plan in his mind amen he had an attribute to be a redeemer and when something fell he had a desire to redeem it back so God the word became flesh and dwelt God became flesh and dwelt Among Us and died on the cross for your sins and my sins that he could express this attribute to be a redeemer these attributes to be a Healer but there was nothing there was nothing sick they had an attribute to be a father but there was no children so God Amen developed this great plan so I say this tonight if you're sick in your body let God Express his attribute as being a Healer don't suffer on with your your pain and oh God this no he he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity and by his stripes you can be healed the Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and God will have an opportunity to express his great attribute of healer and restore your health back maybe you've fallen into sin and you've done something is wrong don't commiserate in your sin let God Express his great attribute of Redeemer and redeem you back to fellowship with God can you say Amen to that once I see it from the scripture say Lord I'm not going to sit here in condemnation Lord I'm going to let you redeem me back to fellowship with almighty God and we've all been there right amen we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity and God reached down his hand I didn't go looking for God he came looking for me I believe that's what Peter meant when he said work out your own salvation realize I just didn't get you know wrapped up or married into this great movement called the message but God came looking for me and He restored me back and then he placed the power of the Holy Ghost inside of me give me a power to be a witness and give me a power to bear fruit for God because it takes the Holy Spirit you can't live good enough you can't you know we say well if we could handcuff ourselves to brother Sean Martin if I could just handcuff myself I would never do wrong and some of us would like to do it just I'll Never back talk my husband as long as brother Sean's in the room but you gotta remember Peter was handcuffed to Jesus for three and a half years Peter walked on water Peter had five thousand Peter was right there and he still I don't even know the man I I don't even know him and the Bible says he cussed he cursed and said he said oh you gotta he's a cussing preacher so it's not being with Jesus this is a this is an amazing thing that just a few days before this Jesus gives him the keys to the kingdom so Peter whatever you buying on Earth I'll bind it in heaven whatever you're buying on Earth and then Jesus knowing a couple days later he's going to deny he even knows him and then you just think about that in in just businesses maybe a brother works and he gets a little business and he said look I'm going to give you everything that bank account and the the keys to the success and here it is and then a couple days later this man is going to deny that he even knows you or anything about you think you wouldn't even do that in your natural mind would you I wouldn't do it but Jesus had such confidence in the Holy Spirit he said I'm going to go away and there's going to be something that comes inside of you Peter and this power it's actually my own life is going to leave live inside of you I mean he said I must go away or this comforter can't come because I will be with you even in you now the body of Jesus Christ didn't come inside of Peter it was the spirit of almighty God not the third person of the Trinity it was God himself that lived inside of him I'll tell you if you ever want inspiration the Holy Ghost just go to witness to somebody and say the very same God that created the heavens and earth he all things were created and by him and for him and by him everything exists and that God lives inside lie to me and watch the Holy Spirit just stands well up inside of you amen because it's not you it's him it's all about him it's all about Jesus Christ it's not about the bride it's about the bridegroom amen he chose us I'm just glad to be a part of it I'm glad that he came and he found me one day brother Sean that day on Calvary said it doesn't make a stuffed shirt it makes you just real humble to say he chose me blessed are your eyes that they see you realize I got family that's better than I am they're not Believers in the world and and and and and people and they're better people than I am these citizens and my just better but God chose you he chose me I said oh thank you Lord now Lord let me bear the right kind of fruit Lord Lord let me bear the right kind of fruit don't let me I always be reading something the other day brother Brown said we should try to reflect Christ in everything that we do and if you don't do it just because you just remember when you got baptized and they put you down in the water and they brought you up you came up as a Christian they called them Christians because they were like Christ and they were from Antioch isn't that the book of Acts and they were Christians remember people are watching your life don't bring a reproach on Jesus Christ don't bring a reproach on Jesus Christ blessed be the name of the Lord so many things are trying to get back you all are pulling me in so many different directions Ephesians chapter one well uh read a couple scriptures here I don't want to be long tonight Ephesians chapter 1 verse 3. Hallelujah called and chosen to bear fruit Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ aren't you glad you're in Heavenly places you feel like you're in Heavenly places amen that's where that's what going to church is about that's why people walk away they never get in Heavenly places they just sit in a critical like oh they sing Out Of Tune and I know the third string on that guy's guitar was out like hey I'm glad you got something out of the service yeah people are solar interior decorators you see this shouldn't be setting here this should be sitting like this to be symmetrical with the one that's sitting over there and that's all they get out of the service you get the musicians like oh this is like and I was a deacon for many years I go out like it was hot in there I said I'm glad you got something out of the service brother Shawna I believe and I've quoted this many wasn't it your wedding where somebody fainted wasn't it something was it Daniel it was Daniel I tell this example I might as well bring it home here we are I tell them you can preach a perfect sermon with perfect verses and and quotes and illustrations and people don't even remember their serving but you can make one mistake and say yeah you came out and you tripped over your thing and that's all they remember you can have a perfect wedding and just have the music and the violins and the dresses and all that and nobody ever remembers it and you can have Daniel faint at a wedding many years ago in Prescott and everybody remembers when Daniel fainted everybody written what a wedding like he fainted up there he just smacked that right on his face and I was like man the way to get people to remember your wedding is you do two or three stage things that look like accidents and then everybody remembers your wedding right but it's the way people get they get if you know they go to church and so you know and you so you gotta I like to misquote a scripture here and there in my preaching Souls you misquoted it I'm glad you got something out of the service because I preached the perfect sermon you wouldn't got anything the critics wouldn't have got anything they're going like man I didn't get anything out of that that was perfect so we want everybody to get something out of the service even the critics amen we're not perfect the last perfect man we hung on the cross hung him on the cross and amen called him a devil amen we're humans ministers were humans and deacons and I've been a Sunday school teacher my wife's assistant we're humans brother Ram said this he said if you get somebody lifted up too high God will allow that person to make a mistake so that your eyes stop looking to them for your salvation and you look over on Jesus Christ amen my job and brother Sean we're pointing you to Jesus Christ say I want to be a signpost sometimes my signing might get a little it might get uh you know dingy we live in a life you drive down the road and mud gets splashed up on the signpost but I'm trying to clean my son off so I'll be a better signpost for Jesus Christ amen so we make mistakes I make mistakes I'm human don't make a list I already got the list made I'll give you the list save you the time they have all kinds of problems we battle the devil just like you the Devil comes like look you got this in your life you're never gonna does he come to you that way he comes to me all like you're never gonna make it then you start saying it's because of this and because of this and this is hereditary you never and I am so thankful that they don't have all those tests ADHD and and I don't know I can't even remember I am so glad they didn't have him when I was young because I am I I probably got at least three maybe four of them I know I do and they just and that's what people do they get those little things a little and they start petting that devil and petting that devil and petting everyone I say Lord I don't care what handicap I have I'm gonna be a Christian Lord Jesus I don't care what thing the devil has tried to have struck my life I'm gonna be the best Christian that I have amen my eyes may be dim but I'm gonna get up every morning and put my contacts in my crutches in and I'm going to preach the best sermon that I can preach can you say Amen to that I might have some handicap in my life but I'm gonna be the best Christian that I can even with my handicaps because that's all God requires of us is that we do our best for Jesus Christ sometimes as a minister brother Sean I look at the mirror and say God I'm doing the best that I know how to do and if there was something I could do better you know how we'd be doing it and aren't you glad God looks at your heart Sam remember they brought all the sons of Jesse I'm just preaching tonight we haven't got to anything and all they bring all the sons to Jesse and even the prophet said surely this is the one surely this is the one and God pulls the prophet aside and says look I want to teach you something Samuel I wanted even a prophet a man of God he has all this Vindication says Samuel come over here I don't look on the outside I look at the heart oh really Sam oh is that okay God yeah I get it okay and it goes back hey it's not it may not be you and it comes all the way down and he was so sure he said wait we went through all your don't you have another one he said I got another one but he's a little Ruddy he said we're not sitting down do you go get Mr ready the little guy that's everybody thinks he's nothing but a sheep herder and they brought him up and they and there David comes in like hey what's going on he's and Jesse says I don't know David everything's gonna just kneel down so he kneels down and all of a sudden Samuel takes the oil and starts pouring his on his head and oil is running down over his face he said Daddy what what does this mean ever been in the presence of God and the anointing of a god you say what does that mean I don't know what it means but just stay there the anointing of God is falling something's happen in your life amen greater is he that is inside of you than he that is in the world and David's there and he says what was all that all about he said God has chosen you to be the king so he gets up and he says what do I do go be king no go back and take care of sheep brother randoms on the river 1933. Angel the Lord comes down and said is John the Baptist 4run my first coming you will go and forerun my second coming did he run around the world and no he went back to his church until 1946 13 years later David back out there and God is teaching him amen he kills a bear and then then a lion comes out he gets the lion and but somehow that anointing that thing when he had this experience with God are you with me today he had had an experience of God he was in the presence he was anointed by God's prophet and the anointing he was there when it happened he ought to know and something came over him and the word of God came to him you're going to be the King David you can't die because you're going to be the king so when this bear comes out to try to destroy him it can't destroy me because I'm going to be the King by a prophecy amen the Bible has shown us there is a bride that's without spot or wrinkle amen God has chosen you to bear fruit you have not chosen God God chose you and revealed this message to you Ellie's your message go get me a bride and somewhere you heard about the message and it's drawing you back and then remember David he was just a little bitty guy he's going he was just like a um a GrubHub driver he was taking meat and cheese to his brothers right they were fighting the battle he was just Uber he was like hey here's your meat and cheese all of a sudden this big man come out about 10 foot tall and he's gone who will come and fight me there's no reason we all die or you die who will come and fight me and the Bible makes this amazing thing it says and David heard it and David heard it and something came back and David that experience that he had with God Amen that experience that he had of God you're going to be the king why isn't Saul fighting because God has chosen you David David said I'll go fight him and he said look you need this and you need this and you need a degree and you need to go learn this and you need to learn all these quotes in the message and you need to get a computer and you may be able to search them all this what about just preaching the gospel what about doing I mean Peter couldn't run an iPad he couldn't sign his own name he didn't know how to log in and put that stuff in her he was ignorant and unlearned amen what about just going and taking what you got your little sling your faith in Jesus Christ amen and David heard it and David starts going he said you come to me with the sword and spirit but I come to you in the name of the Lord and David picks up five smooth Stones I like what the brother said at Camp he didn't pick up four extra ones because he thought he might miss David he picked up four extra ones because he thought Goliath had four brothers he was going to kill them too amen God we are more than conquerors through Jesus Christ we are not defeated we're Sons and Daughters of almighty God not because we said we were because God chose us amen and ordain just that you would see water baptism in Jesus name and you'd come back and say I'm not ashamed to be identified with Christ I'll lay down my old maiden name I'm gonna preach invisible Union right here amen that old nature that had us bound that old law amen that old husband amen is dead our old nature and we rise and newness with Jesus Christ and be married to Christ the word not man's ideas and traditions not brother Daniel's ideas not brother Sean's amen but Christ the word of God and brother Daniel showed me from the scripture that I had to be baptized in Jesus name brother Daniel showed me from the scripture serpency brother did you show me from the scripture predestination oh Hallelujah bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh here a little there little God is changing us from glory to glory he's changing us let the mind that was in Christ let it be inside of you too many people in our generation they're they say things we don't realize with our words we we create atmospheres the Bible says by your words you're Justified and by your words you're condemned you're a creator in the beginning God created heavens of the earth it was that without Earth without form and it was void and the Bible says the spirit of the Lord began to move over it just like people they get in a meeting and the spirit of God moves over it but it takes more than the spirit of God moving over because the spirit of the Lord moved over the Earth but nothing happened until God said something which was let there be light and then there was light so when God begins to speak to you there's power in the word if you're a son and daughter of God you have power in the words that you say so you should never say I'm a weak Christian I'll never make it I'll never amount anything I'm losing my mind no no we are Sons and Daughters of God and can you imagine here the father he's he's building remember what is it Saint John 14 I go and prepare a place for you if I go and prepare a place I will come and yeah anybody anybody ever build a house here it takes a long time doesn't it it takes longer and so it's been a little while more than what we thought it would be around this message but it's going to be really nice when he gets done with it right but he's over there working all of a sudden he hears something like Father father what is it oh yeah I'll just keep this up I'm gonna go my son so son of her I'll never make it like hey that's not the way we talk we're Sons and Daughters of God all my children make it All My Children make it there's no such thing as a wedding supper and like oh yeah they didn't make it tonight they didn't make it my grace wasn't sufficient for them no no his grace is sufficient for all of us there's no plan B With God all that the father hath given me will come to me they will come to me now we make a decision like so like well you know Samuel was uh young six eight ten years he's in the temple of God he hears the voice of God he doesn't even know what it is he goes to some backslidden preacher and the preacher's like I just just go back to bed and after a while the backslidden preacher said you know that's probably God speaking that boy you just say here's your here's your servant uh Lord what would you have me and so God be Samuel is learning the voice of God to him so he could do it at a young age or like Samson you could go your whole head pig headed and just butt against the things of God but God's going to get you we can do this the easy way or the hard way we're better off as a Young Man Levi right amen is eight years old to be drumming for the Lord amen rather than out in the world this backslidden man told these people one time said look you need to go to the world and learn to play rock and roll and then come to the church and and play it in the church somebody around this message we don't need the world we just need Jesus Christ amen the Bible says Praise Him upon the symbols the loud sounding symbols when God will give you Rhythm amen God will give you Rhythm we don't need the world's Rhythm we need God's rhythm in our life we need God's spirit in our life oh praise be to God and so David he goes down there and he hears the anointing and he runs to Goliath hey man he slings this I could he believe he could have slung it that way and the Holy Spirit would have got him brought it right to his head Amen to hit Goliath and he fell down and he cut his head off amen because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world praise the Lord where's your clock at brother son you know don't knock clocks oh my goodness may the Lord help us he's chosen us amen before the foundation of the world amen we need the mind of Christ got so many things here this might be a little too does the devil get out this far does he get up here in the mountains he does okay his sister said well sometimes they get out there like the devil may get out here I was up in Canada it was 30 below zero I said I know the devil doesn't make it up this call he just goes down he's a snowbird he runs like we were talking about this the other day in our in one of the libraries they brought a they're teaching these kids the alphabet and they talk about this lgbtq question mark excellent people don't even know what gender they are my I think it was my daughter-in-law sent me a picture of one of these books and it had B and I said B is for bye you can shout out loud I like more than one gender and gender and it makes me proud that's what the public schools and the libraries are teaching these kids that they can be two different Sexes the Bible says in Genesis that God made them male and female there was only two genders so let the world get confused God is not the author of confusion amen God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and a love and of a sound mind Amen Let don't let your mind waffle don't let your mind go into experimentation stay right with the word of God you'll save yourself a lot of trouble these people that go out into that the the suicide rate between people that go trans and then try to get back to suicide rate is twice what the normal suicide rate is I was reading an article is this okay you can get up and straighten me out if you had a person that went and they they used them as their um poster child and got the the agendas pushed out it's like Satan the devil will pull you out there and make you and use you even Judas came back and said hey here's the money back said hey we didn't want your money we wanted something to push this agenda through we got what we want even the man that went to the military was a homosexual he went into the military and then he came back and said no you all have ruined my life he said no so too late we already got the agenda pass that we wanted to you see that Judas spirit amen may God help us to keep a sound mind in this day amen don't let the devil pull you aside as the one person said the other day I was reading an article they said uh child City because they give them those hormone blockers where a child doesn't develop and then they have to as they grow older they had in chronic pain and they said this person said look they made me a a a medical patient for the rest of my life I have to take their injections to for the pain and all these things they've messed up my body and it's actually the the mutilation of children who was it the other day I seen was it Donald Trump they did an interview and he said I absolutely will stand up against this who would ever thought 10 years ago we would had legislation that would legislate that we need to stop mutilating our teenagers but that's what it is allowing them its insanity is what it is may God give us a sound mind say oh y'all just a bunch of people up in the hills no we got a sound mind we got the mind of Christ that God made a male and he made it a female and we need the holy ghost that will Empower us to say God made me a man I'm a man I'm a man and a sister say I'm a sister I don't need the world to come and try to influence me and young people say hey this is what God made me and how I have said it like this the young people this is the youngest people's service right there's some decisions that are in two two important for you to make so God makes them for you like who your parents are going to be or what gender you are God makes those decisions for you so you don't have that's too important because we I remember one time my dad it was great wisdom he he told us he said now I've done never done this before raised kids and he said there's no manual for it I'm just doing the best that I can there's there's something about humility to say you know I'm not perfect and there's something about a minister hey I'm not perfect I'm doing the best that I can I probably make some mistakes along the way so my dad said now if there's something in that I'm doing that you don't understand you come to me because I'm trying to figure this out too and I said so a little while later I went to him and said yeah Dad Dad Dad um I want to change my name to mark because there was this man that was a hero and I looked at him I just the power of influence he stood in the back of the church and he raised his hand a certain way wow I went to my dad said hey I want to change my name to Mark like that man my dad said we're not changing your name to Mark I've already chose that and God chose a past for all of us we can't choose who our parents were sometimes people make decisions that affect us that there's nothing we can do about it think back through your life like I maybe it's a separation of marriage like I had no choice somebody else made that decision and it affects my life and get up and walk on with God and amen you think about brother banham and all the things and you know his father was a you know uh he he didn't even just today it would be like a drug dealer he wasn't just doing drugs he was doing he was making the drugs and and he was he sold moonshine and brother random uh was was carrying the water for this drug the drug of his day was moonshine and so he was are you with me today and here's the problem of God yeah my dad was this and I had to drop out of school and they put carbolic acid on my head when you remember he said he was at church one of the brothers from his church he was there and they were talking about hunting a man breaks back gets a bottle and dumpster on the head and pretty soon all brother Brown's hair is gone and and you think of the complex he could just sat down yeah I got all this thing I got ADHD and PSD and all these things I just can't do no he just stood up and said I'm going to be the best Christian that I can for the Lord Jesus Christ God has given me the power of the Holy Spirit I'm gonna be a Christian can you say Amen to that I say Amen the Bible says they were in the upper room and the Holy Spirit fell on all of them and they walked out and spoke the word of God with boldness I know there was other times they spoke in tongues and glorified God but there is one place in Acts chapter 4 that they walked out and the Bible says they spake the word of God with boldness maybe this being acts for a reinvention brother Sean we walk out and say you know what I'm a man I'm a woman if you're a woman and you know I believe this message is the truth let's speak the word of God with boldness we're coming up to the holidays and everybody likes to get around go over to other people's house and we hide our Christianity like hey no this is a Christian home we read the Bible at Thanksgiving somebody hand me a Bible don't make your wife do it you do it get your Bibles look go around in a circle and say everybody here we got something to be thankful for and let's be thankful it doesn't matter if you're a Christian the Bible says every good and perfect gift comes from above good and perfect gift comes from the body above he said I'm the Lord that heals all of your sicknesses and all of your diseases I have the quotes right here I can't find them very quick on my iPad I'm really kind of new at this so I would try to find them and I'd get lost somewhere in between there so I'm not going to go to that but brother Brown said God does Miracles through surgeons a miracle through a surgeons or through medicine but the Bible says I'm the Lord that heals all of your sicknesses now you might smash your car up and come on oh God will you heal my car will you hear my God could do it he could do a miracle and all that tin can that got wrinkled up you ever take a tin can of wrinkle and never comes straight again right but God could do a miracle and make it straight but he probably while you're praying say you know what I got a man called a body shop and you just keep praying don't tell me how to do it just say God I need my car fixed and maybe 30 days from now maybe six weeks from now your car will come back and God has healed your car not the way you thought it should be healed but God answered your prayer and healed your car Lord I'm sick in my body God will you hear my body yes and brother bam says 90 of healing is Divine Healing which is life inside of you the power that works in you overcomes the bad sales and you become well ten percent of his miracles we know that but God is healing us God heals by music God heals by a doctor he heals my surgeon I really don't care how it comes Lord You're the god that heals all of my sicknesses and all of my diseases now that's a crippleness in our body but I can tell you I know more crippled people in their Spirit than I do in their body you know we're a complex person we got see taste feel smelling here on the outside man then inside of that you've got conscience memory affection and reason inside of that you got a soul I'm preaching greatest battle ever fought and and things that are to be or not things and knoweth it not those are those three sermons you can go back and listen to it but so we have people that are have their hand or their eyes or something and that's one kind of healing but there's another healing down inside their imagination or their conscience or their memory and we become crippled can you say Amen to that we become crippled how many people you know who want to just take the sheets and pull them up over their head and say I just want to stay in bed when God's called you to be a witness for him God's called you to be a witness I say Lord will you fill us again with the Holy Spirit Lord I need to get these covers off of me because I got to be a witness for you today and be a testimony for you today we don't need more medicine we need more of the Holy Ghost Power inside of us to heal us and say I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Lord I can't do it in myself but off go the covers Lord I'm gonna be a testimony for you today I'm going to be a witness for you today I know there's a lot of positive mental attitudes we're going to go out here and kill some devils and that all sounds so good and it all you know but my wife and I were talking about that this morning I said you know the prophet of God tells us that Spirits don't die I know it sounds good we're gonna go kill some devils but you're not gonna kill any devils all right that's at the Lake of the fire remember the 2000 demons that came out and said don't destroy us before our time and they went into the pigs right but you can't kill the devil you might cast out a devil but Spirits don't die they're alive that there'll come at times they'll be cast in the Lake of Fire so we're not killing the Devils we're just casting them away from us so I'm not here to destroy to Kill Devils but I am here by the preaching of the Gospel that are cast out Devils evil spirit into our mind and say I am conquer through Jesus Christ who loved me he called me and ordained me to bear fruit and I'm gonna bear fruit I'm going to Bear it in my family come Thanksgiving I might not even wait till Thanksgiving I'm going to get my family around us and tell us we're here because of Jesus Christ you don't know where our family was in denomination and God sent a mighty message in this day the message by a prophet and we are what we are today because God sent a prophet in this day and he sent the Holy Spirit to Vindicated in our life and look at what a wonderful thing God's done with our families amen we are a miracle you are a miracle people are looking for a miracle but if you have a sound mind today you are a miracle if you're married today I say you're a miracle if you're a man and you know you're a man you're a miracle if you're a woman and you know you're a woman you're a miracle because this world is perverted it's all messed up so when you see something that's straight and something that's right it's a miracle the Bible says acts with Acts chapter 2 save yourself from this on toward this crooked generation what are y'all doing at church on Sunday night we're saving ourselves we're saving ourselves from this Cricket crooked generation Psalms chapter one let's go there and then I'll close I don't know where time I'm not one of those Revelation 10 6 and time shall be no more I'm not one of those kind of preachers [Laughter] Psalms chapter one let's let's hit Psalms chapter one I haven't got to my notes so we'll not try to start now Psalms the first chapter this is David the Bible says blessed is the man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seed of the scoring spool but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water aren't you so glad for people in your life that are consistent you may not even like them you may not even like their mannerisms but there's something about a tree it's just there and every time I go to church he's just there he just stands there I don't like the way he dresses and he Parks his car in the wrong place but he's there he shall be like a tree planted by the re he's not up and down and then moves over there and today he believes the message of the hour and tomorrow he doesn't believe no his roots go down deep where does his roots go down into the word of God Jesus said I'm going to build a church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against this church so when you see people that are blowing about with every wind of doctors saying look your roots didn't go deep enough into the Bible somewhere you might have heard about a prophet and all these Miracles but they didn't go deep enough into Malachi 4 5 Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 3 as Amos 3 7 Zachariah in the evening time at Shelby are you with me today my job is to get you to see what you believe comes from the scripture because Jesus said I'm building a church and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against this church that's built on a rock of Revelation I have a rock of Revelation amen by the word of God and the Bible says this man is going to be like a tree you can put a swing set on it little swing put a tree house in it man you can get the fruit Planet get another tree out of it the words his words hey man let's go on to read the rest of he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever whatsoever he'd doeth shall prosper do you believe the Bible whatsoever Sons and Daughters of God they do it prospers I was telling my son that the other day the Bible says in all labor there's profit say but brother Daniel I don't understand I started that business and I was trying to build a house and I hit my finger on a nail and I bet you won't do that again will you hit your finger with the hammer like that like so in all labor there's profit and so whatsoever he does he'll profit from it he'll learn from it are you with me today bet you'll never make the cake like that again laugh I gotta tell this story we had you all have little get-togethers and things like that so one day we were having a little get-together and my wife she was just trying to get everything together for this little potluck get together and she put some cornbread in and she went about getting everything ready and she came back and it posed in too long and it was black just total black so well I got enough time since he pulled it out put it in the trash can went back and made another thing it was going about and cooking the other well I just happened to be going out of the garage and I looked down man there's a nice thing of cornbread round cornbread in the trash and it's black and my little mind started turning um so I got this little piece of cornbread and I stuck it in the back of our vehicle brother Sean and when they came to the little potluck thing and everybody set their food out I got that little black because everybody went who made that who made that who made that I got this little black piece of cornbread and I set it up there on the top right there my wife said she's going down the line all of a sudden she looked and she saw her burnt cornbread sitting on the thing how did that Daniel and whatsoever you do will prosper you think she'll ever do that again no she's gonna break that thing up and bury it underneath of it everything that a son and daughter God does they Prosper it's all right to laugh Jesus told say go tell her that fox you know it'd be good for us to smile a little bit you know amen be happy the Bible says it's like a medicine I mean it's being Mary is like a medicine it makes the heart good sometimes brother man I think Rebecca uh Smith Rebecca Brandon brother man's daughter said when they lost their temper brother Branham took him at him and he made them laugh at themselves and they made them laugh there's something spiritual about laughing you don't need to take more medicine just laugh a little bit laugh a little bit be happy in the Lord and joyful the joy of the Lord is our strength amen he's our comforter he's our guide he's everything to us amen we need as we read over there in Ephesians chapter one we're caught up together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen Jesus said I come from God I'm going back to God can you say Amen to that is that the way you feel I was an attribute in the mind of God I came from God I'm going back to to God and when I go to church I forget about my problems I forget about my bad neighbors and my motor and the sickness in my body because I came from God I'm going back to God I'm just on this earth going through brother being said you're put here to make a decision for Jesus Christ and I've made my decision for Jesus Christ and we're in Heavenly places right I said I tell you I can already be there I can see my name right there my name written by the table and they say look here we got your place right down here and this is where you're supposed to sit we're in Heavenly places are you with me today in a few minutes we'll go back to that bad thing called Earth they'll say the dismissing prayer and we'll go out and get in our cars and we need to rotate the tires and we got to make that bread next week and our bills are coming down we got taxes and all that stuff but right now we're in Heavenly places I mean everything's okay in Heavenly places all my problems seem so far away that's why the devil only has perversion remember the day of Pentecost they came out these are not drunk as you suppose there's something about the intoxication of the Holy Spirit and the alcohol of the world and the Bible says be not drunk with wine but be filled with this holy spirit amen when your troubles seem so far away and you just love everybody how do you know when somebody's drunk they just love everybody they just want to love everybody we need some of that around the message a little bit start loving everybody you need to start with the preachers right see when the people see the preachers loving each other then they'll love each other blessed be the name of the Lord what so here you do it shall prosper this verse number four is so powerful especially young people who start looking at the world and the glamor of the world the ungodly or not so but are like the chaff which the Wind Drive at the way therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous amen we were talking about that the other day as a preacher it's my job to preach hell hot enough that the sinner doesn't want to come in and just sit and be comfortable in the house of the Lord he says I want to repent amen can you say Amen to that that's what's happened the church has let down their bar and the world's come in and pretty soon we got the church in the world sitting right together we forget the word church means Ecclesia that called out from the world we need to stop being like the world say we're called out we are different we believe in holding us we believe in it and filling of the Holy Spirit we believe in a prophet we believe in the Bible say well we don't want your Bible remember they told Brother random you come to the place he said look Billy you can come here but we don't want your God and brother bear made this amazing thing I'm going to say something right here we'll go right down to Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat and Instagram and all of it because remember there's no new thing under the sun the devil just changes the way he presents it he was at the garage they were having lunch and brother Brandon go in there and testify and say look Billy we love you and you're welcome here but we don't want your Jesus brother random made this amazing statement he said where Jesus Christ isn't welcome I'm not welcome brother random said he walked out of the place and he said that man he was his icy day his man walked got on the curb and he slipped on the curb and fell down in a big dual axle truck went and ran right over the man brother man said I wonder if he wanted Jesus Christ then and I tell you in this social media when the power goes out and you have no way to charge your cell phone to get Snapchat and Twitter and Instagram I wonder if they'll want Jesus Christ in Snapchat and Twitter and then and Facebook then I said brother you can't be a part of that you can't be preachy you just kind of got to be love everybody and lovey-dovey well I'm sorry God called me to be a witness and if I can't be a Christian where I am I probably don't need to be there if I can't be a witness for Jesus Christ I probably don't need to be there if I say something wrong brother Sean you can correct me here but I found Facebook in the Bible it's first what is it James uh a 4-4 he that is a friend of the world friendship with the world is enmity with God so when you see somebody dressed immoral a girl and moral or man out in the bar somewhere and got a pair of shirts on and you click like my friend you have just become an enemy of God there should be something rise up inside of you amen it says that's sinful that's evil you were once in the house of God and you backslid I don't like that I like you when you're in the presence of God but I don't like this backslid and said oh may God help us amen Sinners won't stand in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the heat of the ungodly Shall Perish the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen I didn't finish that over in Ephesians we got to that one part but not the second party Ephesians we read the first verse Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy now I know in the message we love to preach predestination I love it it's amazing scripture comes from the Bible but the Bible says he's predestinous and chosen us before the foundation of the world to be holy not Unholy and sinful and evil but he ordained us chose us to be holy is that what the Bible says that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love verse 5 Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children he didn't ordained us just to be packages in the seed a seed in a package I want to just say this in this then I'm close we heard this and we've said this for years I'm a predestinated seed and I'm a predestinated seed well that was probably okay in the 60s and 70s because the message was just coming out but at some point we should have stopped being a seed and should have got in the ground got in a good church where the Holy Spirit was falling down where the sunlight was falling on us and now we're not just a seed but we're a manifested seed that is growing through adulthood and growing up in Jesus Christ and we should have been putting out leaves and fruit and now there should be fruit that people don't have to ask you if you're predestinated see people should say hey buy their fruit they will know that your predestinated sea is that fair enough amen we're talking about chosen Amen to be to bear fruit he said I've chosen you that you might bear fruit I say Lord I want to bear fruit set your desire today say Lord I want to bear fruit hey man sometimes there's things that come in our lives that deform us all of us they push us aside whatever that is say Lord would you just cut it away Ephesians chapter 4 said the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and I haven't preached about a lot of things I don't know you you don't know me but the holy spirit is a discerner today and that law goes the pillar of fire that was over brother Brandon that's the word of God the word of God became flesh the word took on flesh and dwelt among us and that Pillar of Fire we believe is in this room right now and that Pillar of Fire is a discerner I don't have to know your life but he the Holy Spirit knows your life so he'll discern he'll go right in your closet he'll go right in your history on your on your uh your history on your whatever browser you're in you go into your phone he'll go into your likes and just he needs a discerner of the thoughts and the intents when you get a little phone number like what are you going to do with that and the Holy Spirit discerns what that is aren't you glad for that God I'll serve a God Like That we're not serving God because we're chained to brother Sean but we're chained to a church or a Creed oh the message said no we're chained to Christ the Bible says in he the Holy Spirit when he come he'll reprove the world of sin so when you get the Holy Spirit and you do wrong the holy spirit says look we don't talk like that we don't do that we're Sons and Daughters of God but you don't understand what she did she stole my recipe and she did it at the thing no but if you forgive don't forgive your brother their trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses so somewhere you forgive even if it's for a selfish reason I really don't want to forgive you but I got a selfish reason God's not going to forgive
