[40:56] and if you have your Bibles I'd like to
[40:59] turn to Joshua the fifth chapter
[41:02] brother Sean called me the other day and
[41:05] he was apologizing that kind of
[41:07] unexpectedly he's ended up going out of
[41:10] town and and I told him you know I was
[41:14] like I would have been good to see your
[41:15] brother but you know it it's all right
[41:18] I'm kind of scared of you anyway
[41:21] you know you're one of the greatest
[41:23] Ministers of the gospel I've ever ever
[41:25] met you know and just somebody that will
[41:28] stand on this message and preach it
[41:30] without fear or favor and just uh just a
[41:34] giant of a man in my side and and so I
[41:37] was a little bit okay with him not being
[41:40] here because it's pretty intimidating to
[41:42] preach to one of your Heroes but uh
[41:45] but we just believe the Lord orders
[41:47] things exactly the way they're supposed
[41:49] to be I'm just going to trust him to
[41:52] give us what we have need of today
[41:54] Joshua the fifth chapter and the 13th
[41:57] verse
[41:59] says and it came to pass when Joshua was
[42:01] by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes
[42:04] and looked and behold there stood a man
[42:06] over against him with his sword drawn in
[42:09] his hand and Joshua went unto him and
[42:12] said unto him art thou for us or for our
[42:15] adversaries and he said nay but as
[42:19] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[42:23] come and Joshua fell on his face to the
[42:26] Earth and did worship and said unto him
[42:28] what saith my Lord unto his servant
[42:32] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[42:34] unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[42:37] foot for the place where I'll now
[42:38] standest is Holy and Joshua did so
[42:42] if we would look into this a little more
[42:45] we would see that this is where Joshua
[42:47] received his his directions on how to
[42:51] take Jericho this is where he received
[42:53] his his marching orders and how to be
[42:56] Victorious and it wasn't Joshua's idea
[42:58] it wasn't Joshua's plan it was directly
[43:01] from the captain of the Lord's host
[43:05] now in Matthew 17
[43:08] and verse 20 I will read one more verse
[43:11] there
[43:12] for a text today I want to
[43:15] take Faith to walk
[43:19] and as kind of a subtitle I want to say
[43:22] just keep walking
[43:25] Matthew 17
[43:27] and 20 this is where the
[43:30] man was brought before Jesus with his
[43:32] son and he asked Jesus if there was
[43:34] anything Jesus could do for him and
[43:37] and Jesus said if you'll believe
[43:39] and
[43:40] hear the disciples come to him in
[43:43] Matthew 17 20 and Jesus said unto them
[43:45] because of your unbelief they're asking
[43:47] why couldn't we cast out this this
[43:50] spirit and he says because of your
[43:52] unbelief for verily I say unto you if
[43:54] you have faith as a grain of mustard
[43:56] seed ye shall say unto this mountain
[43:59] remove hints to Yonder place and it
[44:02] shall remove and nothing shall be
[44:06] impossible unto you may be seated this
[44:09] morning
[44:11] so I want to just preach on that Faith
[44:13] to walk
[44:15] focusing on uh just keeping on walking
[44:18] and this uh this this here thought about
[44:22] the Mustard Seed
[44:24] um I I always in my mind had understood
[44:27] this scripture in this in this context I
[44:30] thought of of Faith the size of a
[44:32] mustard seed and I thought okay if you
[44:35] can get Faith
[44:36] and you know you all are familiar with
[44:38] me I build paper airplanes in church so
[44:40] I bring mustard seeds too and uh
[44:44] Faith the size of a mustard seed is a
[44:47] very small quantity there's not a lot to
[44:49] this
[44:50] and I've got I've just got a a whole
[44:53] probably a half dozen of them there
[44:55] between my my fingers and that's not you
[44:58] know one of those mustard seeds that's
[45:00] not a whole lot
[45:01] and in my mind I always thought that it
[45:04] meant that Faith was so incredibly
[45:06] powerful that if you could just have
[45:08] that much faith if you spoke suddenly
[45:11] that mountain would just vanish
[45:13] that was my thought I mean you can't
[45:14] even see that probably in the palm of my
[45:16] hand there it's so small
[45:19] and I thought in my mind well if you
[45:20] could just have that Faith the size of a
[45:23] mustard seed then you know that mountain
[45:25] would just vanish and so it made me feel
[45:28] like I must have an incredibly small
[45:30] amount of faith if I'm struggling with
[45:32] you know this this matter over here or
[45:34] this matter over here
[45:36] but you know I started looking into the
[45:38] message and that's not really the way
[45:39] brother Branham taught it and uh I'll
[45:43] just go through a few of these here
[45:45] brother man says a Mustard Seed Faith
[45:47] won't perform a miracle
[45:52] but if you'll hold on to it it'll bring
[45:54] you out all right
[45:56] so this little Mustard Seed of faith
[45:59] it will not perform a miracle
[46:03] and that really struck me because I'm
[46:05] always thinking about you know like if I
[46:07] could just get enough Faith as a mustard
[46:09] seed and then he tells me that a Mustard
[46:12] Seed Faith won't perform a miracle
[46:14] again he says here uh that was in 62
[46:17] here in 58 he says and you might not
[46:19] have faith enough to have a miracle
[46:20] performed on you and if you've got if
[46:22] you've just got Mustard Seed Faith stay
[46:25] with it it'll lead you to the light and
[46:29] it won't mix with nothing else
[46:31] again he says uh you know some people
[46:33] has great big Faith like that and they
[46:36] can be healed in a moment that would be
[46:39] a miracle some has faith that that much
[46:41] can be healed in a week some has Mustard
[46:45] Seed Faith takes them a long time but
[46:49] just follow it it's genuine it'll bring
[46:52] you to the light just hold on to it and
[46:54] keep moving and it'll bring you out you
[46:57] just keep holding to that Faith it'll
[46:59] bring you through if it's real mustard
[47:01] seed you know Mustard Seed don't mix
[47:03] with nothing it's genuine
[47:07] you know it just it makes me think of
[47:09] that that mountain and how the prophet
[47:10] says you know you speak to that mountain
[47:12] and maybe nothing would happen but maybe
[47:14] a little grain of sand on the back of
[47:16] that mountain would trickle off and and
[47:17] be removed in the back of the sea and
[47:19] I'm wondering if you know that little
[47:21] grain of sand might not be about the
[47:23] size of the Mustard Seed Faith you've
[47:24] had you had Faith Like a mustard seed
[47:27] and that's Faith Like a mustard seed
[47:28] move that grain of sand and the next day
[47:31] it's going to move maybe two grains of
[47:32] sand and as your faith if you'll hold on
[47:34] to that faith that mountain will be gone
[47:40] and again he says here uh and maybe you
[47:43] have Mustard Seed Faith you can look
[47:45] this up just type in Mustard Seed Faith
[47:47] he talks about it quite a few times he
[47:49] says just a little bit but if you've got
[47:51] Mustard Seed Faith just hold on to it
[47:54] Mustard Seed won't mix with nothing else
[47:55] and if you've got real faith it won't
[47:58] mix with no unbelief hold on to it and
[48:00] it'll wind you around the curve and find
[48:03] you're not in a cave but in the light
[48:06] just hold on to it
[48:12] Mustard Seed Faith will not perform a
[48:15] miracle but if you'll keep that Mustard
[48:17] Seed Faith and you just keep holding on
[48:19] to it and keep walking with it it will
[48:20] take you out of the darkness it will
[48:22] take you out of sickness it will move a
[48:24] mountain there is nothing that is
[48:26] impossible if you'll hold on to that
[48:28] little Mustard Seed of Faith because
[48:31] that little Mustard Seed is putting you
[48:33] in contact with omnipotence
[48:37] and the other thing this is just my
[48:39] thought on this that I thought about is
[48:41] if you take this little Mustard Seed and
[48:43] you plant it
[48:44] and you just give it some time
[48:46] it's going to grow and it's going to
[48:49] grow and it's gonna grow and one place
[48:51] Jesus says you plant that seed and that
[48:53] Mustard Seed grows until it's one of the
[48:54] biggest plants in the garden and the
[48:55] birds are all coming down and and it's a
[48:58] great big big a tree-like plant
[49:03] if you'll hold on to that Mustard Seed
[49:05] but here's the thing that that I'm
[49:07] really getting at today friends is is
[49:09] many times
[49:10] we have that Mustard Seed Faith
[49:13] but then we don't see the instant result
[49:16] and we begin to question
[49:17] we begin to wander and here we see uh
[49:20] Joshua met with that captain of the host
[49:22] of the Lord and he meets with him and
[49:24] and you'll see uh let me go to Joshua
[49:28] chapter six just flip over there with me
[49:30] Joshua chapter 6. verse 11 and they were
[49:35] given a commandment on how to be
[49:37] victorious in this battle
[49:39] and so they they gather around and verse
[49:43] 11 it says so the Ark of the Lord can
[49:45] pass the city going about it once and
[49:47] they came into the camp and lodged in
[49:49] the camp verse 14 and the second day
[49:52] they can pass the city once and return
[49:55] into the camp so they did six days
[49:58] Time After Time After Time they're doing
[50:02] the same thing they're going to the same
[50:03] church service they're believing the
[50:05] same promise and it just feels like
[50:07] they're going in circles
[50:09] and they were they were literally
[50:12] walking around in circles and they
[50:14] didn't see one bit of change day after
[50:17] day after day they'd say well I've
[50:20] walked this way before I've believed
[50:21] this promise before the prophet said to
[50:23] do this we're doing this but I don't see
[50:25] any change I don't see any difference
[50:29] you know if they'd got to day six and
[50:31] just said what in the world are we doing
[50:33] let's elect a new leader let's get rid
[50:35] of this Joshua this guy's obviously not
[50:37] a military leader
[50:40] this guy obviously doesn't know how to
[50:42] handle these situations we need to be
[50:43] building battering rams we need to be
[50:45] building catapults we need to be you
[50:46] know building ladders to scale the walls
[50:48] we've got to be doing something besides
[50:49] running around in circles and not
[50:52] getting anywhere we've done this day
[50:53] after day after day nothing has changed
[50:56] yes
[50:59] it wasn't reasonable friends
[51:02] it didn't make any sense
[51:06] but they were following
[51:08] a prophet's word
[51:11] they were following a message that came
[51:13] straight from almighty God that told him
[51:16] if you'll just obey my word if you'll
[51:19] just do what I'm telling you to do
[51:20] you're going to see those strongholds
[51:22] come down that land is going to be given
[51:24] to you you won't even have to fight for
[51:26] it you won't have to swing a battering
[51:28] ram those walls are going to fall down
[51:29] just obey my word
[51:32] and it got to feeling boring and it got
[51:35] to feeling mundane because it felt so
[51:38] human
[51:39] foreign
[51:40] it felt so human to walk around that
[51:43] City again and again and again they
[51:46] walked around that City 13 times but
[51:48] every footstep was a footstep of Victory
[51:51] because it was according to the word of
[51:54] God
[51:57] and you know what happened
[52:00] they simply obeyed that word day after
[52:03] day after day until suddenly the power
[52:06] of God came down they shouted a shout of
[52:08] Victory the walls begin to tremble the
[52:10] walls begin to shake the whole
[52:12] stronghill fell to pieces
[52:14] why because every day normal people were
[52:19] following the leadership of the word of
[52:21] God
[52:23] and it felt natural it felt human and it
[52:26] didn't make a lot of sense
[52:29] but if you'll stay with that word of God
[52:32] you'll watch The Impossible
[52:35] become reality
[52:37] so do you have the faith to take another
[52:40] step Prince do you have the faith to
[52:43] walk according to the word if the word
[52:45] says to walk around the city then walk
[52:47] around the city if the word says that
[52:48] believe and you and your household shall
[52:50] be see us be saved then you hold on to
[52:52] that promise there is not enough devils
[52:54] in hell to stop that from coming into
[52:56] reality if you'll hold with it but if
[52:58] you hold with it for six weeks and then
[53:00] the seventh week you don't see your
[53:01] family suddenly saved and then you say
[53:03] well I guess it's just not going to
[53:04] happen don't you dare do that you hold
[53:08] on to that Mustard Seed Faith you hold
[53:10] on to that cup full of Faith whatever
[53:12] Faith you have you hold on to that and
[53:14] you keep holding on to that and you obey
[53:16] that word
[53:17] everything will come into subjection to
[53:21] that word
[53:22] just walk with God according to his word
[53:27] you know one of the greatest examples of
[53:29] that is a real man of Faith by the name
[53:31] of Enoch and he walked with God Plumbing
[53:35] to a rapture
[53:37] and I believe that's the exact same
[53:38] thing we're going to do in our Humanity
[53:41] we're going to feel human we're going to
[53:43] feel like we're just getting up and
[53:45] we're tired and we're trying to drink
[53:46] our coffee and get our shoes on and get
[53:48] back to church
[53:51] and then we get there and
[53:54] find out that it's Resurrection morning
[53:58] it's not about how your flesh feels
[54:00] friends
[54:01] it's what your soul believes
[54:03] Enoch Genesis 5 22 walked with God after
[54:06] he began Methuselah three weeks no
[54:13] 300 years
[54:15] year after year after year but every
[54:19] year he was walking with God another
[54:21] year came he says one more year to walk
[54:23] with my God and he walked with him for
[54:25] 300 years and Enoch walked with God and
[54:28] he was not for God took him
[54:32] that's the exact same position we're in
[54:34] here friends if I have to live 300 years
[54:36] let me walk with God every single year
[54:39] let me walk with him every single day
[54:41] because I know where this is going I'm
[54:44] nowhere the end of this road is because
[54:46] I have heard a message that has told me
[54:48] that if I'll walk with God he'll take me
[54:51] into the eternities
[54:53] in the sermon he swore by himself
[54:56] brother Graham says this and and it's
[54:58] just I'm sure you've heard it because
[54:59] it's just so beautiful a lot of
[55:01] preachers are gonna gonna remember it
[55:02] but he says listen I'm going to say
[55:04] something look faith is unconscious you
[55:07] believe it I've learned that in the
[55:09] years of travel around the world and
[55:11] meeting the people of all different
[55:12] walks but faith is unconscious you got
[55:15] faith and you don't even know it that's
[55:18] right Jesus Christ no matter if he was
[55:20] in a storm and The gales knocking the
[55:22] boat from one side of the other he was
[55:24] standing in the face of a mess of demons
[55:26] if he was hanging anywhere it never
[55:29] moved him he walked right along just as
[55:32] calm and as quiet as he could be why he
[55:35] was simply unconscious of fear anything
[55:38] around him that's right whether it was
[55:40] going to happen or whether it was not
[55:42] going to happen he knowed it was going
[55:44] to happen because God said so he didn't
[55:47] say oh I wonder if I prayed through
[55:48] wonder if I fasted long enough
[55:51] you ever ask those questions
[55:54] but what did the word say
[55:57] I wonder if I did this he just walked
[55:59] right on unconscious that's right he
[56:02] believed what God Said was the truth the
[56:04] word must be fulfilled and he knowed
[56:07] that what his life was to fulfill them
[56:14] yeah and you're here to fulfill it too
[56:19] just walk unconscious of fear walk
[56:22] unconscious of criticism walk
[56:24] unconscious of the world walk as you
[56:27] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[56:29] any attention to the right hand or the
[56:30] left just keep moving on if something
[56:33] comes up in the church walk with God if
[56:35] sickness strikes you walk with God if
[56:38] the neighbor don't like you walk with
[56:40] God just keep on Walking with God Enoch
[56:43] one day walked like that you know what
[56:45] he done he walked all the way home with
[56:48] God got so far up the road he didn't
[56:50] want to come back anymore walk with God
[56:52] doctor says you're going to die walk
[56:55] with God yeah doctor says you can't well
[56:57] walk with God just walk with God that's
[57:00] all for God has promised you I'll never
[57:03] leave you or forsake you I'll be with
[57:05] you to the end of the world and he took
[57:07] an oath by that Covenant that he give
[57:10] you and he confirmed it just walk with
[57:14] God then
[57:15] you'll have to go ups and downs don't
[57:17] worry you got to go through Briar
[57:19] patches over sharp rocks over Bluffs
[57:21] down the hillsides up through the
[57:22] mountains over Waters but walk with God
[57:28] oh isn't that just encouraging friends
[57:31] you know there's going to be many
[57:33] different situations that are going to
[57:34] come up there's going to be many
[57:35] different things that will happen in
[57:37] your life
[57:38] just keep walking
[57:40] just keep moving forward can you take
[57:42] take one more step
[57:46] can you take another step then take that
[57:48] step can you take another step take that
[57:50] step prophet of God says he would get to
[57:52] a place where there was absolutely
[57:53] nowhere to go but just you know hardly
[57:55] take one inch farther he says I just
[57:58] take that one more inch and I stand
[57:59] there and watch God move that mountain
[58:02] or make a way through it
[58:05] just keep moving forward don't stop
[58:08] don't hesitate do you have the faith to
[58:12] take one more step then take it
[58:14] you got the faith to make it one more
[58:15] day through that one more day
[58:18] because God is going to bring his
[58:22] promise into reality and it's usually
[58:25] longer than you want but sooner than you
[58:27] really think
[58:29] Galatians chapter 6 and 9 it says and
[58:34] let us not be weary in well-doing for in
[58:37] due season we shall reap if we faint not
[58:42] and that's something I really want to
[58:44] get across to us is is don't stop
[58:47] in the middle of a supernatural event
[58:51] don't stop right when you know you're
[58:54] just one more day's March from Jericho
[58:56] Fallen flat
[58:58] and you get tired you get weary you stub
[59:00] your toe or you know the guy next to you
[59:03] has bad Bo so you don't want to come
[59:04] back to church or whatever it is
[59:07] why would you let that stop you from
[59:10] seeing one of the most Supernatural
[59:11] things that could ever happen take place
[59:13] the next day
[59:16] just keep walking
[59:18] now I want to get into a little bit of
[59:21] what faith is what is faith
[59:24] and
[59:25] it's not what you imagine
[59:28] faith is a substance it's just as real
[59:31] as any sense in your body will declare
[59:33] anything else it's just as real as as my
[59:36] eyes saying that you know this is a cup
[59:38] of water right here
[59:40] it's just that real it's just as as real
[59:42] as as to say that that is a light right
[59:44] there it's it's reality you're not going
[59:47] to You could argue with me and I like to
[59:50] argue unfortunately and we could argue
[59:52] whether or not that's light or not and
[59:54] we could go one side and up the other
[59:56] but at the end of the day I still know
[59:58] what it's like I really don't care what
[1:00:01] kind of a crazy argument you came up
[1:00:03] with
[1:00:03] that's a light I know it's a light
[1:00:06] there's just no real discussion on that
[1:00:09] point
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:11] I feel this coat right here
[1:00:14] I don't care what kind of a theory you'd
[1:00:16] come up with I don't care what kind of
[1:00:18] scientific evidence you would have
[1:00:20] I have every confidence
[1:00:22] this is a coat I'm wearing
[1:00:24] I can feel it I can see it
[1:00:28] it's reality faith is no different
[1:00:30] friends Faith isn't a hope so Faith
[1:00:33] isn't a maybe so Faith isn't I think it
[1:00:35] might be it's a reality faith is a
[1:00:38] substance
[1:00:40] it's a real substance of things hoped
[1:00:43] for it's the proof it's the evidence of
[1:00:45] things you cannot see with your natural
[1:00:48] eye
[1:00:50] now if you had somebody playing an
[1:00:53] instrument here playing the music faith
[1:00:55] is just that real you can hear it you
[1:00:58] take something in your mouth you taste
[1:00:59] it it's a reality
[1:01:01] because you know you've gone through so
[1:01:04] many years of your senses showing you
[1:01:06] and declaring you what these things are
[1:01:07] and you're you're confident of those
[1:01:09] things
[1:01:12] now
[1:01:13] the thing is is that those senses can be
[1:01:16] wrong
[1:01:18] but that Sixth Sense
[1:01:21] my eyes might tell me something that
[1:01:23] isn't true my ears might hear something
[1:01:25] and it might get it wrong I might taste
[1:01:27] something and I might think it's one
[1:01:29] thing and it's another my senses can get
[1:01:32] things wrong but that Sixth Sense does
[1:01:35] not if it declares the things of God
[1:01:38] it's not wrong it's a greater reality
[1:01:41] than all of this so why would we ever
[1:01:44] trust
[1:01:46] how I feel
[1:01:48] versus what my faith declares
[1:01:51] why would you ever trust your senses
[1:01:53] your reasoning your your human
[1:01:55] understanding against something
[1:01:58] that's of Greater
[1:02:00] Authority greater accuracy and cannot
[1:02:03] fail
[1:02:04] faith in the word of God will not fail
[1:02:07] never has never will
[1:02:11] now
[1:02:13] program says and works as Faith
[1:02:14] expressed he says
[1:02:16] and he promised you the same thing that
[1:02:18] is if you could believe that it would
[1:02:20] happen if you can't believe it it just
[1:02:23] won't happen now I can't make you
[1:02:25] believe it's the prophet of God if the
[1:02:27] prophet of God was right here preaching
[1:02:29] you to this morning he could not make
[1:02:32] you believe
[1:02:34] and then it takes it a little bit
[1:02:36] farther and he says neither can you make
[1:02:38] yourself believe
[1:02:40] God has got to give it to you it's a
[1:02:43] gift of God to believe not your faith
[1:02:47] God's faith your intellectual Faith
[1:02:50] might believe it fine but unless the
[1:02:53] faith of God is down in your heart your
[1:02:54] intellectual faith can accept it do that
[1:02:57] that's true and just keep believing it
[1:02:59] with all your heart until God does
[1:03:02] reveal it to you just keep believing it
[1:03:04] until God does reveal it to you and so
[1:03:07] we can look in the scriptures we can
[1:03:09] turn brother Amos right
[1:03:10] all right God bless you Ramos uh you
[1:03:13] have a Bible here turn with me to uh
[1:03:15] Isaiah 53 all right we're going to use
[1:03:18] your your reasoning we're going to use
[1:03:19] your your your eyesight and we're going
[1:03:22] to look at Isaiah 53 and uh and see if
[1:03:25] what the word of God says and this is
[1:03:27] approaching it intellectually this is
[1:03:29] approaching it through the human senses
[1:03:31] we can come here we can see it and we
[1:03:34] know what it says uh well your senses
[1:03:37] are gonna need a little help aren't they
[1:03:38] all right got them glasses uh Isaiah 53
[1:03:43] yeah where are we at there you know
[1:03:46] where I'm looking for
[1:03:47] [Music]
[1:03:48] right here right here verse five good
[1:03:52] and loud you got a good voice right
[1:03:54] but he was wounded for our
[1:03:56] transgressions
[1:03:57] he was bruised for our iniquities
[1:04:00] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:04:03] him
[1:04:03] and with his stripes we are healed all
[1:04:07] right is that the word of God brother
[1:04:08] Amos amen it's the word of God Amen is
[1:04:11] it true amen it's the truth that's right
[1:04:14] all right so we can we can agree this is
[1:04:17] the word of God this is truth does it
[1:04:19] say that we're already healed is that
[1:04:21] what it's telling us yes so do you have
[1:04:24] is there any you know issues in your
[1:04:27] life with sickness I just showed you in
[1:04:29] the word of God that you're already
[1:04:30] healed do you struggle with peace in
[1:04:33] your life and the devil brings the
[1:04:35] oppression and the torment of the minds
[1:04:36] right here I'm telling you by the word
[1:04:39] he already bore that chastisement for
[1:04:42] your peace do you deal with condemnation
[1:04:45] or guilt or or something in your heart
[1:04:47] when the devil is just really tearing
[1:04:49] you apart right here he already paid the
[1:04:51] price for your transgressions it's
[1:04:53] settled now you as people intellectually
[1:04:56] as reasonable human beings you can say
[1:04:59] that is the word of God we've seen it in
[1:05:01] the word of God we've read it in the
[1:05:02] word of God
[1:05:03] but if it stays right there you will
[1:05:06] never see the supernatural released
[1:05:07] that's right now
[1:05:10] this is a good start
[1:05:12] you start with saying that is true and I
[1:05:14] believe it but this right here won't
[1:05:17] perform the supernatural but you keep
[1:05:18] holding on to that Lord I believe your
[1:05:20] word Lord I believe your word praise the
[1:05:22] Lord for healing me like oh John blind
[1:05:24] John Ryan praise the Lord for healing me
[1:05:26] it was 30 days later he was still
[1:05:28] testifying praise the Lord for healing
[1:05:30] me praise the Lord for healing me and
[1:05:32] all of a sudden one day after about 30
[1:05:34] days that word that had been given him
[1:05:36] dropped from his mind down into his
[1:05:38] heart and sitting in that barber chair
[1:05:39] he testified one more time praise the
[1:05:42] Lord for healing me and it struck home
[1:05:44] it made it made contact and he leaped
[1:05:46] out of that chair ran out the door with
[1:05:48] his eyes wide open because it had become
[1:05:51] a reality in his heart he didn't know
[1:05:53] how to take hold of Faith that's what
[1:05:56] the prophet tells him he didn't know how
[1:05:57] to take a hold of Faith so he just told
[1:05:59] him you just keep testifying you keep
[1:06:00] confessing the word you just keep saying
[1:06:02] it and one of these days it's going to
[1:06:05] drop down on the inside now I I've
[1:06:08] looked into a little bit of like
[1:06:09] Business Development stuff like that and
[1:06:11] and one of the things they get into is
[1:06:13] is this self-help program where they
[1:06:15] talk about affirmations all right and
[1:06:17] this is a is dealing with psychology and
[1:06:19] things like this and and they get in
[1:06:21] there and they stand in front of the
[1:06:22] mirror and they say I am a successful
[1:06:25] businessman I am this I am this and they
[1:06:27] start saying all of these positive
[1:06:29] things about them because they have
[1:06:30] found in-depth studies that prove if
[1:06:33] you'll stand there and you'll confess
[1:06:35] something
[1:06:36] it starts to do something in your life
[1:06:38] amen it starts to make something happen
[1:06:40] they don't really know how it works but
[1:06:43] they know something happens and so they
[1:06:44] tell people you just stand there and you
[1:06:46] start telling yourself positive things
[1:06:47] and you start speaking positive things
[1:06:49] because there's a power in it well they
[1:06:51] might not know how it works
[1:06:52] but we do know how this works we know
[1:06:55] that when you confess something with
[1:06:57] your mouth there is a power in your
[1:06:59] spoken word never let your confession be
[1:07:02] negative never let a negative word come
[1:07:04] out of your mouth let it always be
[1:07:05] positive because there is a Power
[1:07:07] released when you speak
[1:07:10] and if you will speak and confess this
[1:07:12] word of God you will begin to see the
[1:07:14] word of God coming into reality because
[1:07:17] when you speak something
[1:07:18] there's a party that begins to believe
[1:07:20] it
[1:07:21] if you'll say it again a little bit more
[1:07:23] of you begin to believe it and these
[1:07:24] people they'll just say these
[1:07:25] affirmations in front of the mirror
[1:07:27] until finally they really believe what
[1:07:29] they're saying now that might get you
[1:07:31] only so far in business
[1:07:34] but if you confess this word of God and
[1:07:37] believe it with all your heart it'll
[1:07:38] take you into eternity friends
[1:07:45] not your faith it's God's faith
[1:07:49] God comes down and he places in you
[1:07:52] faith is a is a confidence you have
[1:07:56] faith in your wife your husband you have
[1:07:58] confidence in them you trust them
[1:08:00] there's a trust there's a confidence in
[1:08:02] a person that you have faith in them you
[1:08:05] have an assurance in that individual
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:08] and when you have this Faith this
[1:08:11] confidence not in your neighbor not in
[1:08:13] your friend not in your government but
[1:08:15] faith and a confidence and almighty God
[1:08:19] it releases the power of God into your
[1:08:22] life
[1:08:23] here uh in red ramp says this was a
[1:08:26] living faith I live by the faith of the
[1:08:28] Son of God Paul did not say that he
[1:08:30] lived by faith in the Son of God it was
[1:08:33] the faith of the Son of God that had
[1:08:34] given him life and kept him living in
[1:08:38] Christian victory
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:41] faith is a revelation all right now
[1:08:45] I'd really like some more Revelation can
[1:08:47] you give me some
[1:08:49] you know you can give me an idea you can
[1:08:51] explain something intellectually but you
[1:08:54] can't give me a revelation I can't give
[1:08:56] you revelation
[1:08:58] where does revelation come from
[1:09:01] God Alone
[1:09:02] and so friends we should pray for
[1:09:05] revelation
[1:09:06] more than anything else
[1:09:09] faith is a revelation from God that's
[1:09:11] what I want to stay there just a moment
[1:09:13] it's a revelation he has revealed it to
[1:09:15] you by his grace it's nothing you did
[1:09:19] you didn't work yourself up into Faith
[1:09:21] you ever have faith it's give to you by
[1:09:24] the grace of God
[1:09:27] God reveals it to you through faith
[1:09:30] therefore faith is a revelation and the
[1:09:32] whole Church of God is built upon the
[1:09:35] revelation
[1:09:37] you can't understand it you can't
[1:09:39] explain it it is a divine revelation
[1:09:41] that is given to you by God because
[1:09:44] you've been such a faithful church
[1:09:45] member is that what he was saying no
[1:09:48] because you know you you wear modest
[1:09:50] apparel therefore God gives you Faith
[1:09:51] because no
[1:09:53] it's Grace
[1:09:55] it's Grace that gives you faith not your
[1:09:59] merits not how good you've been it's the
[1:10:02] grace of God that comes down and Reveals
[1:10:04] His word into your heart and gives you a
[1:10:07] confidence and Assurance of faith in
[1:10:10] that word that will bring it into a
[1:10:12] reality
[1:10:14] some time ago I was out uh in Arizona
[1:10:16] and uh I was out for an afternoon or an
[1:10:19] evening walk I was preaching the next
[1:10:21] day and so I really like to just go
[1:10:23] walking out in the in the hills and just
[1:10:26] meditate on the things of the Lord and
[1:10:27] just look up at the the stars and and it
[1:10:30] was a full moon it was just a beautiful
[1:10:31] beautiful night out there so I went out
[1:10:33] in the Hills there and there happened to
[1:10:35] be a a bit of a storm that was coming up
[1:10:37] and so all these clouds came blowing in
[1:10:39] and now I was marching there through the
[1:10:42] woods and or the cactuses in the dark
[1:10:45] and uh I didn't have any light and when
[1:10:49] you're in the middle of nowhere
[1:10:51] without a light at night with a bunch of
[1:10:54] cactuses and rocks around
[1:10:57] it can be a little challenging and so
[1:10:59] there's a particular way you have to
[1:11:01] walk if you're in a place like that and
[1:11:02] you do these high steps where you're
[1:11:04] you're feeling each footstep you're
[1:11:06] feeling your way along and it's very
[1:11:08] slow it's very painstaking trying to
[1:11:10] make sure I wasn't gonna hit something
[1:11:11] you're watching out of your peripheral
[1:11:13] vision because it picks up light a
[1:11:14] little bit better that way and and
[1:11:16] you're just really working your way
[1:11:17] through and every now and again there'd
[1:11:18] be a little Gap in the clouds and a
[1:11:20] little bit of Starlight would come
[1:11:21] through and you could make better time
[1:11:22] and but it was really challenging now in
[1:11:24] my pocket I had my cell phone which had
[1:11:26] a flashlight on it
[1:11:28] but my phone was at like two percent
[1:11:30] battery and so I was saving that for you
[1:11:34] know
[1:11:34] an extra special moment and and so I was
[1:11:38] just waiting trying to find my way along
[1:11:40] and
[1:11:41] and eventually I started to hear this
[1:11:43] Creek flowing I'm like there's no Creek
[1:11:46] out here what what is that you know and
[1:11:48] I could hear it was like
[1:11:50] flowing so I'm working my way along and
[1:11:52] so I'm like I'm just gonna cut down on
[1:11:54] the edge of this hill here and see if I
[1:11:55] can find out what that was and I started
[1:11:57] looking and I seen up against the the
[1:11:59] skyline was this high transmission power
[1:12:02] lines
[1:12:03] and uh there was these this these power
[1:12:07] lines there's so much energy flowing
[1:12:08] through there it was actually bursting
[1:12:10] with electricity there was Sparks that
[1:12:12] would pop off of there and it was just
[1:12:13] there was like a a static a humming
[1:12:16] sound but I thought it was water flowing
[1:12:17] it's how much as power was there in
[1:12:20] those high transmission power lines
[1:12:21] there's something like 300 000 volts of
[1:12:24] electricity flowing through there it's
[1:12:27] extremely charged
[1:12:29] and yet my phone was still going dead
[1:12:33] I was next to enough power to light up
[1:12:36] the entire state
[1:12:40] and I was still in darkness
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:44] my phone had you know technology on it
[1:12:46] that could turn on a flashlight
[1:12:49] and I'm right there next to thousands
[1:12:52] hundreds of thousands of volts
[1:12:53] electricity that could you know more
[1:12:55] than charge my phone it was plenty of
[1:12:57] power there
[1:12:59] and yet I still was in darkness
[1:13:02] why
[1:13:05] because
[1:13:06] I mean well is it because that
[1:13:08] electricity just had stopped working
[1:13:11] no the power was there it was there and
[1:13:16] it was looking for an opportunity to
[1:13:18] release itself if there gets you can
[1:13:20] even have a fire if you'll have a fire
[1:13:22] underneath those areas the smoke will
[1:13:23] come up and it'll make just enough of a
[1:13:25] connection that you'll have a bolt of
[1:13:27] lightning come out of those high
[1:13:28] transmission power lines and make
[1:13:29] contact with the ground it's looking for
[1:13:32] any opportunity to release that power
[1:13:35] but it operates under a law
[1:13:39] and if you don't operate according to
[1:13:41] that law you won't get one you won't
[1:13:45] even get the tiniest little spark out of
[1:13:47] that electrical system you have to
[1:13:49] operate with that power according to the
[1:13:52] law that governs it
[1:13:55] faith is exactly the same way that
[1:13:58] electricity will light up if you'll work
[1:14:00] according to the law of electricity but
[1:14:02] I could stand there and I could shout
[1:14:04] and I could jump and I could scream and
[1:14:06] I could yell at that power system
[1:14:08] it was not going to do a thing
[1:14:11] but if I'll operate according to the law
[1:14:13] of that electricity
[1:14:16] it's just about unlimited friends and
[1:14:18] the potential
[1:14:20] and so I had to stumble along and feel
[1:14:23] my way until I finally got back to a
[1:14:25] pathway and I got on that path when I
[1:14:27] went to the house and I went to the
[1:14:29] house and I took a a charger
[1:14:33] and I plugged it into the wall and I
[1:14:34] plugged the cord into my phone and that
[1:14:36] charger went into the wall it went to
[1:14:37] the electrical lines it went through the
[1:14:39] electrical lines to the to the meter at
[1:14:41] the house and went from there to a
[1:14:42] transfer station where it's been the
[1:14:43] energy is converted down because there's
[1:14:45] so much power there it would destroy my
[1:14:47] phone if it was connected to it it
[1:14:49] couldn't handle that amount of power it
[1:14:51] there you couldn't you couldn't contain
[1:14:53] it it would destroy you
[1:14:55] but there's a law that operates it that
[1:14:57] comes it down brings it down brings it
[1:14:59] through a Transformer until I was
[1:15:01] actually able to access and tap into the
[1:15:03] very same power that was over there and
[1:15:06] get it on my phone so I could turn on my
[1:15:09] light
[1:15:10] and you know you have you'll have needs
[1:15:13] in your life
[1:15:14] but if you try and approach it just
[1:15:16] through you know emotion or or Screaming
[1:15:19] or yelling or jumping around that's not
[1:15:21] going to release that power now once you
[1:15:23] make contact with that power
[1:15:25] there might be some emotion that comes
[1:15:27] with it you know
[1:15:28] um
[1:15:29] like uh if I had that shot caller right
[1:15:32] Hudson you know the kids were having
[1:15:34] some fun with this little shock collar
[1:15:36] you know and and uh you you put your
[1:15:38] fingers on it and then you push the
[1:15:39] button and it zaps you you know and
[1:15:41] they're raising the level up a little
[1:15:43] higher and a little higher and feeling
[1:15:44] it and you know and if we put that on
[1:15:46] brother Amos this morning and suddenly
[1:15:48] in church we just hit the button I'm
[1:15:50] expecting a reaction friends he might
[1:15:52] jump in the air he might let out a shout
[1:15:54] he might let out a holler something
[1:15:55] might happen everybody else might look
[1:15:57] at him like what is wrong with brother
[1:15:58] Amos today
[1:16:00] well the answer to that is friends if
[1:16:02] you were experiencing what he was
[1:16:03] experiencing you'd probably have a
[1:16:05] similar reaction because he came in
[1:16:07] contact with a power and that power had
[1:16:09] about a nine volt battery in it and you
[1:16:11] can't tell me that when you come into
[1:16:12] contact with my omnipotent God and you
[1:16:15] get a connection with him that there's
[1:16:16] not going to be a reaction there's not
[1:16:18] going to be something that takes place
[1:16:20] there is going to be a reaction there's
[1:16:22] going to be a Power released and you
[1:16:24] might look a little funny you might look
[1:16:25] a little bit strange but if they were
[1:16:28] experiencing what you were experiencing
[1:16:30] they might be doing the exact same thing
[1:16:32] that you're doing
[1:16:36] now the only way that a church can be
[1:16:39] built and the only way that a man can
[1:16:40] have faith is not by his denomination
[1:16:42] not by his affiliation but his faith
[1:16:45] rests upon not the Theology of some
[1:16:47] man's ideas because it's more or less
[1:16:49] altogether man but the only way faith
[1:16:52] can find its solemn resting places upon
[1:16:54] the immovable and unchangeable word of
[1:16:58] God
[1:16:59] the word of God is where you find your
[1:17:01] anchoring place that is where Faith
[1:17:03] makes that connection and it's not faith
[1:17:05] in a man it's not faith in in in in you
[1:17:08] know your own ideas your own thinking
[1:17:10] it's faith in the word that is where
[1:17:13] Faith Finds Its resting place nothing
[1:17:16] can ever change that Faith think of that
[1:17:17] you're anchored and you're no more for
[1:17:19] change for Time and Eternity you're
[1:17:22] anchored forever
[1:17:24] now
[1:17:26] faith is subconscious faith is something
[1:17:29] that you don't actually think about
[1:17:33] somewhere down in here the same way that
[1:17:35] you don't think about blinking your eyes
[1:17:37] or taking a breath
[1:17:39] it's the same way faith is it's in that
[1:17:41] subconscious realm something you don't
[1:17:43] have to think about
[1:17:45] um if if you didn't have the faith you
[1:17:49] couldn't get up out of your chair right
[1:17:50] now
[1:17:50] if you didn't have the faith you
[1:17:52] couldn't take a step
[1:17:54] you couldn't do it
[1:17:56] and that might sound strange but you
[1:17:58] know I was in a situation one time where
[1:18:01] uh we were with some friends and I went
[1:18:04] to this this Creek out in Arizona on
[1:18:06] this this Gorge and about a 20-foot drop
[1:18:09] off of some rocks into the water and uh
[1:18:11] so everybody's jumping off the rocks and
[1:18:13] diving into the water you know and so
[1:18:15] you know I've done it before and it's
[1:18:16] really fun so I was like oh I'm gonna do
[1:18:18] that too and I'm like and I go over and
[1:18:19] look at that I'm like that's kind of a
[1:18:21] long ways down so I I'm like okay I'm
[1:18:23] gonna do it I'm gonna do it I told
[1:18:24] myself I'm gonna do it I said I'm gonna
[1:18:26] do it and I'd run up to that and my feet
[1:18:28] would literally stop
[1:18:30] why
[1:18:32] why I couldn't do it I'm like I get
[1:18:34] there and and I couldn't take one measly
[1:18:37] little step why
[1:18:40] I just didn't have the confidence
[1:18:43] I didn't have the Faith No it's not
[1:18:44] common sense I didn't have the I didn't
[1:18:46] have the faith to take a step and I'm
[1:18:49] like I'm looking I see my friends
[1:18:50] jumping off it looks fun I've done stuff
[1:18:52] like this before I know it's going to be
[1:18:53] great
[1:18:54] but until I got that faith it took me
[1:18:56] like 15 minutes of sitting there before
[1:18:58] I finally had enough faith
[1:19:01] to pick up my foot in Step six inches
[1:19:03] and then I screamed all the way down and
[1:19:07] went up and did it again but if you
[1:19:09] don't have the faith or something
[1:19:11] you can tell yourself I'm going to do
[1:19:12] this I'm going to take this step if you
[1:19:14] don't have faith that won't happen
[1:19:17] yeah this light switch right here
[1:19:20] when you turn on a light switch
[1:19:22] it's an Act of Faith
[1:19:24] you don't think about it you just say I
[1:19:26] need light and so you uh
[1:19:31] see okay this one controls right here
[1:19:33] great just finding out about this church
[1:19:35] so and you need lights up here you just
[1:19:37] walk over and you flip that switch you
[1:19:38] don't think about it you'll just walk by
[1:19:40] in passing just make a swipe at those
[1:19:41] switches and you turn them on
[1:19:43] and you expect it to work you have total
[1:19:45] confidence that it'll work have you ever
[1:19:47] turned on a light switch and a light
[1:19:49] didn't turn on
[1:19:50] anybody had that happen
[1:19:52] did you decide that the days of Miracles
[1:19:55] were passed
[1:19:57] you know I got a little something here
[1:20:00] um
[1:20:01] so
[1:20:05] you know if
[1:20:10] you take a power source and you plug it
[1:20:13] in to this promise of God it's going to
[1:20:16] produce
[1:20:17] if you'll take Faith and the faith is
[1:20:21] that that switch all right so right here
[1:20:23] on the back of this light there's a
[1:20:24] switch right here
[1:20:25] and that makes the connection between
[1:20:28] this
[1:20:31] the individual
[1:20:34] and the power source and now God has a
[1:20:37] way he has a law he has things in order
[1:20:39] there there's a there's an established
[1:20:41] way these things have to be done
[1:20:43] and so if we come over here
[1:20:47] and we make this connection
[1:20:50] you know we get that one lined up maybe
[1:20:52] your motives and objectives are right
[1:20:53] you start getting things lined up
[1:20:55] according to the word of God you start
[1:20:57] getting these things there now if you
[1:20:59] take this and you're like okay you know
[1:21:01] I've got Faith Lord and I'm going to
[1:21:02] plug it into this man
[1:21:05] no
[1:21:07] that's not going to work
[1:21:09] this is not the source there might be
[1:21:13] power in there but it's not going to
[1:21:14] work I can hear right now this speaker's
[1:21:16] running I can hear it I can hear the
[1:21:18] volume I know there's power here but if
[1:21:21] I try and plug into this speaker I will
[1:21:23] get absolutely nothing
[1:21:25] even though it has power in it it's not
[1:21:27] the source
[1:21:28] that's right that's right
[1:21:30] you can't you can't place your faith
[1:21:33] in a pastor you should have confidence
[1:21:35] in the man but he is not the answer he
[1:21:39] is not the one you are placing your
[1:21:41] confidence in but if you'll go to the
[1:21:43] source there's power in that Pastor
[1:21:45] because he's connected to the source at
[1:21:47] least ways in this church there's there
[1:21:49] is a connection to the source in that
[1:21:50] man of God but that is not where you
[1:21:53] plug in that's not where you get your
[1:21:55] faith you take the faith and you take it
[1:21:58] and you plug it into well we'll put it
[1:22:00] in this one because there's another
[1:22:01] chord there you know that's a good thing
[1:22:03] to do is
[1:22:05] see how it worked for someone else
[1:22:10] now we have the power here we've made
[1:22:12] the connection we know what the word
[1:22:14] says we've got it all here now it comes
[1:22:16] down to one little flick of the finger
[1:22:19] in which we turn that switch of faith
[1:22:22] now what do you think is going to happen
[1:22:26] I hope so I really don't know how this
[1:22:29] chord works I don't know if that
[1:22:30] Outlet's a live Outlet sometimes you run
[1:22:32] into dead Outlets but you know what if I
[1:22:34] flip that switch and it doesn't turn on
[1:22:37] I'm not going to repent of this message
[1:22:40] no way I'm gonna say there's something
[1:22:44] wrong with the outlet
[1:22:45] I'm going to say there's something wrong
[1:22:47] with that breaker I'm going to go on and
[1:22:49] check that breaker because I know
[1:22:53] oh I know friends that there is power
[1:22:55] there and I that you know you can have a
[1:22:57] break in the line you can have a break
[1:22:59] at the break the breaker box it might
[1:23:01] break the connection there you might
[1:23:02] have your meter and you might not have
[1:23:03] paid your bill and that meter might be
[1:23:05] turned off but I know there is power at
[1:23:07] the source I know there is power at the
[1:23:10] main station and if I can get a
[1:23:11] connection from right here all the way
[1:23:13] to that main station I will have that
[1:23:15] release of power for my desire right
[1:23:18] here this morning
[1:23:20] and so if I flip this switch and it did
[1:23:22] not produce the results I would say
[1:23:24] let's go to the breaker let's find the
[1:23:26] brake where's that sin where's that
[1:23:28] separation what's causing this
[1:23:29] disconnect because I know this power
[1:23:32] works
[1:23:35] and so this morning
[1:23:37] we're gonna flip that switch
[1:23:40] and yeah it turns on
[1:23:43] the power is here
[1:23:45] I have not the slightest shadow of a
[1:23:48] doubt that we have met the requirements
[1:23:51] to bring electricity into this room
[1:23:54] foreign
[1:23:55] oh you're not plugging this power source
[1:23:57] into a denominational system you're not
[1:23:59] plugging it into your human reasoning
[1:24:01] you're not you could sit here and you
[1:24:02] could reason all day about how good
[1:24:04] electricity is but if you don't plug it
[1:24:06] in you will never get the results
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:10] oh friends
[1:24:13] how confident are you
[1:24:15] that if I flip this switch
[1:24:17] it's going to turn on
[1:24:21] I mean your confidence level gets really
[1:24:25] high because we've proved that it's from
[1:24:28] here to here to here and if it's getting
[1:24:30] to there why wouldn't it hit there
[1:24:33] you know for several years my wife
[1:24:36] struggled with postpartum depression
[1:24:39] she got into a place of just darkness
[1:24:41] over her suicidal Spirits just troubling
[1:24:44] her just fear and torment of the Mind
[1:24:48] it was a very very dark place
[1:24:56] those things are real friends
[1:24:58] depression
[1:25:02] come to a place
[1:25:03] to see where brother ran him
[1:25:05] tried to commit suicide twice
[1:25:08] because of the darkness he was feeling
[1:25:10] the depression he was under
[1:25:14] and Satan came and he just began to
[1:25:16] torment her mind
[1:25:18] until she was just lost in the Darkness
[1:25:22] but one day
[1:25:25] my rod came down
[1:25:27] he set her free
[1:25:31] and God led her out of that darkness and
[1:25:34] brought her into the light
[1:25:39] and if he did it for this one
[1:25:41] he'd do it for the next one
[1:25:45] and I had a my friend my brother-in-law
[1:25:47] now Nathan Eric we were at a gathering
[1:25:50] of young people we were just sitting
[1:25:51] around fellowshipping about the Lord and
[1:25:53] talking about how wonderful he was and
[1:25:55] about his promises I was probably 18 or
[1:25:57] 19 years old and as we were felishing
[1:25:59] about these things we with somebody said
[1:26:01] well why don't you pray for what will
[1:26:02] you pray for my needs and they said my
[1:26:04] parents they aren't serving the lord
[1:26:06] they haven't been to church in I don't
[1:26:07] know like 15 years she says I've been
[1:26:09] going to church by myself and and so we
[1:26:11] said we're going to pray for you and we
[1:26:12] we gathered around and we just prayed a
[1:26:14] prayer with our sister that God would
[1:26:16] give her her chill her her family her
[1:26:18] mom and dad she said sometimes I have to
[1:26:20] stand at the door of my house and or my
[1:26:22] bedroom and I say Satan you might be
[1:26:24] able to have that place out there but
[1:26:25] this is my room and I tell you you
[1:26:27] cannot come in here
[1:26:31] we prayed with her and a prophecy went
[1:26:33] out through tongues and interpretations
[1:26:34] that God would give her her family
[1:26:38] I think it was close to maybe nine or
[1:26:40] ten years
[1:26:42] for that family walked into the church
[1:26:47] and God answered that prayer well when
[1:26:49] that when that word came forth there was
[1:26:51] such an anointing of faith and of love
[1:26:53] friends that that was the most
[1:26:55] Supernatural experience of love I've
[1:26:57] ever been in
[1:26:58] and through that I seen the most
[1:27:01] Supernatural things take place that
[1:27:02] night we began to gather around and pray
[1:27:04] for one another and there was about 10
[1:27:07] or 12 of us in that little room and
[1:27:08] there was about 40 other people at the
[1:27:10] rest of the building and when they heard
[1:27:11] that shouting and screaming and speaking
[1:27:13] in tongues happening in that room they
[1:27:14] says everybody get quiet and start
[1:27:15] praying we want to get into what's going
[1:27:17] on in there and so after a while they
[1:27:19] opened up a big sliding door and and my
[1:27:21] brother Nathan brother-in-law Nathan he
[1:27:23] was the first one he says brothers and
[1:27:25] sisters I have a need and and we just
[1:27:26] poured out of that little room and we
[1:27:28] came out and we gathered around him and
[1:27:30] we began to say what would you desire
[1:27:31] brother and he says well I've got this
[1:27:33] this injury in my wrists she says I I
[1:27:35] played the piano and Something's
[1:27:36] Happened it was like a carpal tunnel
[1:27:38] type thing he says I can't play anymore
[1:27:40] he says I'm just passing into pray for
[1:27:42] me and we laid our hands on him and
[1:27:43] while we were there praying a vibration
[1:27:45] is began to pulsate up and down his
[1:27:47] wrists and he's never been troubled with
[1:27:49] that before again
[1:27:51] I had we had friends there that this
[1:27:54] this prayer meeting went on for I don't
[1:27:56] know four or five hours
[1:27:59] a group of young people
[1:28:00] Supernatural after Supernatural after
[1:28:02] Supernatural took place I had one friend
[1:28:04] he was just Bound by a depression and
[1:28:07] arthritis he had arthritis all through
[1:28:09] his body and he was just bound down but
[1:28:10] the thing that was really holding was
[1:28:12] that depression and he was he was
[1:28:14] literally on the ground like this trying
[1:28:15] to stand up and it was like he was under
[1:28:17] 100 pound weight and he's just
[1:28:18] struggling to stand up and he finally
[1:28:20] stands up and he's just like please
[1:28:22] for me and
[1:28:25] Satan was trying to hold him down for
[1:28:27] everything he was worth to keep him from
[1:28:29] standing up and calling on the children
[1:28:30] of God to pray for his need and finally
[1:28:33] he pushed through that he pressed
[1:28:35] through that he says pray for me we
[1:28:37] gather around and we prayed over him and
[1:28:39] God broke that power of depression off
[1:28:41] of his life he has never been troubled
[1:28:42] by arthritis again from that day God he
[1:28:45] healed him God set him free testimony
[1:28:47] after testimony of the supernatural God
[1:28:49] and there was just in that atmosphere of
[1:28:51] that love that was there for one another
[1:28:53] in that atmosphere of faith it was just
[1:28:55] like whatever you want if you have need
[1:28:57] of something just ask the power is here
[1:29:00] we just seen this brother who was
[1:29:02] hurting the ax in a car accident with
[1:29:03] his back pain for years and he just
[1:29:05] testified a couple of minutes ago that
[1:29:06] back pain just left his back we know
[1:29:08] God's here we know the Supernatural is
[1:29:11] happening so why wouldn't you ask for
[1:29:14] something
[1:29:15] hey so friends we asked and we asked and
[1:29:17] we asked until many of us couldn't walk
[1:29:19] anymore we were you know there's a
[1:29:21] virtue that goes with that and we were
[1:29:23] just just gathered around and just
[1:29:25] incredible the things that God did
[1:29:28] that night was the night I began to
[1:29:29] recognize the voice of God speaking to
[1:29:31] my heart he would he would give me a
[1:29:33] prayer to pray for someone and I could
[1:29:34] not get away from that voice until I
[1:29:36] would answer that prayer and pray over
[1:29:38] that person that particular way and just
[1:29:40] began to be sensitive and things and and
[1:29:42] I got home from that I was driving back
[1:29:44] from the airport
[1:29:45] and all of a sudden I realized I've been
[1:29:48] so busy praying for everybody that night
[1:29:50] that
[1:29:51] I never asked for anything myself
[1:29:54] I was just like
[1:29:57] I mean
[1:29:59] I could have had anything
[1:30:00] absolutely anything no no bars hold like
[1:30:03] anything was possible
[1:30:06] I was like man
[1:30:07] what an opportunity and I missed that
[1:30:10] opportunity
[1:30:11] and so as I was there I'd been in a
[1:30:15] snowboarding accident and I made a
[1:30:19] mistake and and hit my edge of my board
[1:30:21] into the ground probably 30 40 miles an
[1:30:23] hour and just slammed right into my
[1:30:25] shoulder very high speed and it had just
[1:30:28] it injured my shoulders severely I I
[1:30:31] think were you there Daniel
[1:30:33] Were You There When I had that injured
[1:30:34] shoulder up there in Arizona when we
[1:30:36] went skiing I remember you were pulling
[1:30:37] on my shoulder in the car I think trying
[1:30:39] to pop it back in the socket or whatever
[1:30:40] was wrong with it it was painful and it
[1:30:43] got to where I could only raise my
[1:30:44] shoulder up about this far and and it
[1:30:46] would just bind and the pain would be
[1:30:48] there and and that was all I could do
[1:30:50] and I was like
[1:30:51] man what could I have asked for and I
[1:30:53] thought of that injury I was like I
[1:30:54] could have been healed of that shoulder
[1:30:56] could have been healed if I'd had just
[1:30:58] asked
[1:30:59] as I was driving down the road passing
[1:31:02] by Carefree exit in Phoenix Arizona a
[1:31:05] voice came to that car instead I am
[1:31:07] still the same God
[1:31:09] [Music]
[1:31:11] and I said then I accept my healing
[1:31:13] right now in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:31:15] and you know what friends I went
[1:31:17] everywhere I testified I told about what
[1:31:19] God had done there and what God had done
[1:31:20] for me and I felt not one tiny bit
[1:31:22] different
[1:31:24] but there wasn't it wasn't a hope so
[1:31:26] France it wasn't a maybe so I knew
[1:31:29] beyond a shadow of a doubt that if he
[1:31:31] said I could have it then I had it and I
[1:31:33] testified for months and finally one
[1:31:35] time I was up in Canada and I was
[1:31:36] testifying up there and I also didn't
[1:31:38] realize that shoulder hasn't bothered me
[1:31:40] in a long time and that word had become
[1:31:42] a reality in my life
[1:31:44] but friends if God would do that for my
[1:31:47] wife if he'd do that for a group of
[1:31:48] young people if he would do that for me
[1:31:50] if he would do that why wouldn't he do
[1:31:53] it for you
[1:31:54] he's the god of the supernatural how
[1:31:56] many of you here could raise a hand and
[1:31:58] say I was healed of this or this or this
[1:32:01] raise your hand how many of you have
[1:32:03] made contact with that God and seen him
[1:32:05] heal you and do Supernatural seeing you
[1:32:08] deliver you from things you couldn't get
[1:32:09] out of seeing you do
[1:32:11] you know what I'm talking about
[1:32:13] and I'm telling you if he would do it
[1:32:15] for one
[1:32:17] the power's here we've made contact all
[1:32:20] you've got to do is switch that little
[1:32:22] switch right here
[1:32:24] and we'll release the power to you
[1:32:26] it's not a maybe so it's not a hope so
[1:32:28] if God will do it for you if he did it
[1:32:31] for this one if he did it for that one
[1:32:33] why wouldn't he do it again
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:36] absolutely he will
[1:32:41] praise the Lord
[1:32:42] you know
[1:32:43] when you begin to share those
[1:32:45] testimonies you begin to feel that Faith
[1:32:47] just beginning to pulsate you begin to
[1:32:49] realize we serve a God that's real we
[1:32:52] serve a god that is is present we serve
[1:32:55] a god that is a a living reality here in
[1:32:58] our midst
[1:33:00] you recognize
[1:33:02] that thing that's bothering me it might
[1:33:04] not be here at the end of service
[1:33:06] you recognize that promise I've been
[1:33:08] holding on to it could be the day that
[1:33:10] that's going to be released and I'm
[1:33:12] going to be free from that thing
[1:33:15] but Rams speaking to this people in
[1:33:17] Chicago he starts says you know there's
[1:33:18] a what's the matter with your people
[1:33:20] here he says you really have wonderful
[1:33:22] Faith he says I can feel it but here's
[1:33:24] what you're afraid of you're afraid to
[1:33:26] turn that Faith loose
[1:33:30] since you're afraid to turn that face
[1:33:32] lewd you lose you're afraid to act your
[1:33:35] faith don't do that faith without works
[1:33:39] is dead
[1:33:41] don't be that feeling of Faith that's
[1:33:43] pulsating through this room right now
[1:33:45] don't be afraid of that don't be afraid
[1:33:47] of that pulsation of faith in your heart
[1:33:49] you act on that Faith you give you you
[1:33:52] let that just have its way in you and
[1:33:54] you let God come down and make himself
[1:33:56] real
[1:33:58] the Rams in a prayer line and this woman
[1:34:00] comes up and she's got deafness and he
[1:34:02] says the woman coming to me prayed for
[1:34:03] this deafness she's deaf I could feel
[1:34:05] that there's a deaf Spirit on the woman
[1:34:06] and you listen very closely what he says
[1:34:08] here there's a deaf Spirit on that woman
[1:34:10] right here setting before me now and it
[1:34:13] knows
[1:34:14] what's the it
[1:34:16] that deaf spirit that demonic Spirit
[1:34:19] that's holding that woman captive it
[1:34:21] knows something
[1:34:22] it knows that woman has Faith also it's
[1:34:27] perhaps going to have to leave just in a
[1:34:30] moment
[1:34:33] you know why those Devils began
[1:34:34] screaming you know why when that Faith
[1:34:37] would begin to raise and they begin to
[1:34:38] see the supernatural God present those
[1:34:40] demons will begin screaming out for help
[1:34:42] because they realize the possibility
[1:34:45] they recognize you know what Branson
[1:34:47] bright Ransom right Branson's got faith
[1:34:49] in his heart there is a possibility that
[1:34:51] I'm gonna lose my hold on him just any
[1:34:53] moment because there's a possibility
[1:34:55] that he might make contact with the
[1:34:57] supernatural God right now
[1:35:00] do you realize the devil realizes
[1:35:02] friends the possibility of this meeting
[1:35:04] this morning but do you
[1:35:07] do you realize the possibility the devil
[1:35:10] has a there's a fear on the devil there
[1:35:13] is a nervousness on the devil he is
[1:35:15] afraid of the possibility of what could
[1:35:17] happen here this morning and so he's
[1:35:19] doing everything he can he's calling out
[1:35:21] to this Spirit over here and that Spirit
[1:35:22] over there don't let him break loose
[1:35:26] Devil's screaming for help trying not to
[1:35:29] lose control because if that Faith
[1:35:31] Breaks Loose every person could walk out
[1:35:34] of here healed set free and receiving
[1:35:36] the promise of God walking in Victory
[1:35:39] because faith is the victory
[1:35:47] you know Mom I'm running longer than I
[1:35:49] thought
[1:35:50] you know some time ago I had a dream
[1:35:52] maybe a couple weeks ago and uh I
[1:35:55] wouldn't call it a spiritual dream
[1:35:57] although it had a spiritual principle
[1:35:58] that I just really enjoyed
[1:36:01] um I kind of dream is kind of like a I
[1:36:03] don't know it's like an adventure dream
[1:36:05] or something like that you know things
[1:36:07] are always very entertaining in there
[1:36:08] and and so we were going along in this
[1:36:11] particular dream and and there was a
[1:36:13] group of people and we were trying to
[1:36:15] get through all these like obstacles and
[1:36:17] they were kind of like maybe if you've
[1:36:19] ever been in an escape room something
[1:36:20] like that like all these puzzles and
[1:36:22] trying to break through these barriers
[1:36:23] and trying to get through and and there
[1:36:25] was this guy this guy that was there
[1:36:26] that was kind of like holding us captive
[1:36:28] in a way and we were like breaking
[1:36:29] through all the barriers and we're
[1:36:30] getting through and finally we get
[1:36:32] through to the to the main Central Area
[1:36:34] we we got through everything and we get
[1:36:36] there and uh there was this being
[1:36:39] sitting on a throne there and he was a
[1:36:41] being of Darkness he had uh he was a
[1:36:44] mentor I think or something like that a
[1:36:47] very ugly creature and so this devil was
[1:36:50] there and we're looking at them we're
[1:36:52] like so you're the one that's been
[1:36:53] causing all these obstacles you're the
[1:36:55] one that's been trying to place all
[1:36:56] these barriers here and so we kind of
[1:36:58] made the connection here and it's like
[1:36:59] oh man you know this is not a good guy
[1:37:01] and uh and he begins to speak and he
[1:37:04] says there was a sister uh standing next
[1:37:07] to me a younger girl and and he says you
[1:37:11] used to serve me he says You Belong To
[1:37:14] Me
[1:37:15] he says you can never escape from me
[1:37:18] and I looked over and I said you know
[1:37:19] sister Diana you've accepted Jesus
[1:37:21] Christ as your savior right she's like
[1:37:23] yes I says you believe the Lord Jesus
[1:37:26] Christ and you've given your heart to
[1:37:27] him he says yes I have
[1:37:29] and so I stepped in between that devil
[1:37:33] there on on that throne and that girl
[1:37:35] and I said Satan
[1:37:37] he says you listen to me you have no
[1:37:40] power or authority over her she does not
[1:37:44] belong to you she is a daughter of God
[1:37:48] and then I I spoke those words I rebuke
[1:37:52] you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:37:54] something happened that I can't explain
[1:37:55] it but it was like a million tons of
[1:37:58] bricks struck onto that that creature on
[1:38:01] his throne and it completely obliterated
[1:38:03] into a giant hole in the ground there
[1:38:05] was nothing left it was just an
[1:38:07] Unstoppable force that came striking
[1:38:09] down with those words of rebuke in the
[1:38:11] name of Jesus Christ and I woke up and I
[1:38:13] was just like that's awesome
[1:38:15] that's what it does like I got to see
[1:38:18] the impact of the word of the faith in
[1:38:21] the name of Jesus Christ I got to see
[1:38:23] the impact of what that does to the
[1:38:25] devil why don't we use that a little
[1:38:27] more often friends why don't we release
[1:38:29] that blast word that will just
[1:38:30] disintegrate Satan
[1:38:33] and then the other day I found this
[1:38:34] quote and I just couldn't couldn't uh I
[1:38:36] got pretty excited about it brother
[1:38:38] Branham says here demons will tremble
[1:38:40] and sinners awake faith in Jehovah makes
[1:38:43] anything Shake amen makes the kingdom of
[1:38:46] the devil crumble and fall turn them big
[1:38:49] blast words on thus saith the Lord that
[1:38:53] Atomic word of God flies out there and
[1:38:56] just disintegrates Satan's kingdom
[1:39:03] we have been given an atomic blast words
[1:39:06] we have been given a word that is a sure
[1:39:09] word and we need to be using it friends
[1:39:12] when you come up against an enemy when
[1:39:14] you come up against the devil don't just
[1:39:15] sit there and say well I'm sorry I
[1:39:17] Disturbed you no
[1:39:21] rebuke him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:39:25] we have been given Atomic blast words
[1:39:30] you've got different situations I've got
[1:39:32] different situations but the word has an
[1:39:35] answer for that situation and you go to
[1:39:37] that word and you say thus saith the
[1:39:40] Lord the doctor says I'm going to die
[1:39:42] but God says I'm going to live the
[1:39:44] doctor says this but the word says this
[1:39:46] you begin to take and you find the word
[1:39:48] for your situation and you release those
[1:39:51] atomic blast words
[1:39:53] we'll disintegrate Satan his kingdom
[1:39:58] we can have a perfect faith in a perfect
[1:40:02] word
[1:40:05] sermon perfect faith I really encourage
[1:40:07] you to go home and listen to that it's
[1:40:09] powerful he says for the word of God is
[1:40:12] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:40:14] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:40:15] dividing Ascender of the Soul and Spirit
[1:40:17] of the joints and of the marrow and it
[1:40:19] is a discerner of their thoughts and
[1:40:20] intents of the heart the word made flesh
[1:40:26] now
[1:40:27] right here I'm hearing him speaking of
[1:40:29] that son of man Ministry that
[1:40:31] Vindication that it was God himself that
[1:40:34] was coming here to give us a word the
[1:40:36] word operating in human flesh by
[1:40:39] physical signs by Mysterio Signs by
[1:40:41] scriptural signs perfectly to bring you
[1:40:44] a perfect faith for a perfect rapture
[1:40:49] a perfect faith for a perfect Rapture
[1:40:51] now you can't have confidence
[1:40:54] if we had an imperfect word
[1:40:57] but we don't
[1:40:59] we have a perfect word and thereby we
[1:41:02] can have a perfect faith for a perfect
[1:41:04] rapture now
[1:41:06] I don't know if if your church is like
[1:41:08] this but I reckon it probably is do you
[1:41:10] hear a lot about vindication about a
[1:41:13] Vindicated word about a Vindicated
[1:41:15] Prophet you know some people get to be
[1:41:17] like well we've heard that we've heard
[1:41:18] that yeah
[1:41:19] well it's there's a reason you're
[1:41:21] hearing it it's because it's really
[1:41:23] important
[1:41:24] that you recognize the Vindication of
[1:41:27] the word for the hour that you're in
[1:41:30] Satan has had great success in exalting
[1:41:33] himself above the sons of God in each
[1:41:35] age by getting the people of that age
[1:41:37] not to Value the promised word for their
[1:41:41] age
[1:41:43] now
[1:41:45] Vindication uh
[1:41:48] if anybody here been skydiving

[1:44:05] for telling you to jump out of a plane
[1:44:07] and fall for thousands of feet yeah
[1:44:11] you're going to want a Vindicated
[1:44:12] parachute and you're going to want a
[1:44:14] Vindicated parachute instructor friends
[1:44:21] and you know what that's just for your
[1:44:22] natural life
[1:44:25] what we're talking about is your soul
[1:44:28] God didn't just throw us something and
[1:44:31] say here put this on and
[1:44:34] not give us any confidence in whether or
[1:44:35] not it worked
[1:44:38] he sent us a Vindicated message by a
[1:44:40] Vindicated prophet he says and if you
[1:44:43] will rest your soul on this it will
[1:44:45] bring you into eternity it will take you
[1:44:48] into a Rapture it'll change the very
[1:44:50] fibers of your body if you'll hold on to
[1:44:52] this Vindicated word
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:44:56] we have a Vindicated message by a
[1:44:59] Vindicated Prophet it's not a hope so
[1:45:01] it's not a maybe so it's not a might be
[1:45:03] and God took painstaking efforts to
[1:45:06] vindicate this Prophet so you could have
[1:45:08] a perfect faith in this perfect word for
[1:45:13] a perfect rapture
[1:45:17] Abraham says here who then will have the
[1:45:20] power of infallibility you know what
[1:45:22] infallibility means
[1:45:24] never wrong
[1:45:26] who then will have the power of
[1:45:29] infallibility it's a parachute that
[1:45:30] doesn't just work 50 of the time France
[1:45:33] the power of infallibility which is to
[1:45:35] be restored in this last stage for this
[1:45:38] last stage is going to go back to
[1:45:40] manifesting the peer word bride that
[1:45:44] means we will have the word once again
[1:45:46] as it was perfectly given and perfectly
[1:45:48] understood in the days of Paul I will
[1:45:50] tell you who will have it it will be a
[1:45:52] prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even
[1:45:54] more thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[1:45:56] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:45:59] this day because this man will of
[1:46:01] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[1:46:04] Ministry and God will show him forth he
[1:46:06] won't need to speak for himself God will
[1:46:08] speak for him by the voice of the sign
[1:46:12] we can have a real faith we can have a
[1:46:16] confidence that goes beyond any mortal
[1:46:19] realm we can have an assurance that goes
[1:46:21] beyond because we can see Vindication
[1:46:23] thousands of vindications of this
[1:46:26] prophetic ministry again and again and
[1:46:28] again so that there is no excuse there's
[1:46:30] not the slightest shadow of a doubt we
[1:46:32] know we have received a Vindicated
[1:46:34] message by a Vindicated prophet thank
[1:46:37] you
[1:46:38] and as he said in perfect faith and so
[1:46:41] when a man lives by faith we we have the
[1:46:43] opportunity now to access substance
[1:46:46] Faith reality faith we have the
[1:46:49] opportunity right now to access a faith
[1:46:51] like has never been seen before
[1:46:54] it's a rapturing faith and so when a man
[1:46:57] lives by faith and walks by faith I mean
[1:47:00] substance Faith he is isolated from the
[1:47:03] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:47:05] in Christ there now you're getting into
[1:47:08] bride material you'll see you're getting
[1:47:10] into rapturing condition now
[1:47:14] what's what's he say about the rapturing
[1:47:16] condition
[1:47:17] substance Faith
[1:47:19] reality faith not a hope so not a maybe
[1:47:22] so but a no-so
[1:47:24] not something that you think might work
[1:47:26] you have been thoroughly satisfied
[1:47:30] I'm not getting on that plane until I'm
[1:47:33] thoroughly satisfied
[1:47:36] that it's a Vindicated
[1:47:40] parachute
[1:47:41] it's a Vindicated instructor
[1:47:44] until I'm satisfied I'm not getting on
[1:47:48] but friends
[1:47:49] I have been satisfied
[1:47:52] I have been satisfied about the
[1:47:55] authority of this word in this hour I
[1:47:57] have been satisfied that it is the saith
[1:48:00] the Lord and I have taken flight already
[1:48:02] I'm already up there friends and just
[1:48:04] any minute now when they push me out
[1:48:06] that door I'm not going down I'm going
[1:48:09] up this is a rapturing message I have
[1:48:12] received a rapturing faith it is
[1:48:14] coursing through my heart and I know
[1:48:16] beyond a shadow of a doubt that it will
[1:48:18] produce what it said it will do if I'll
[1:48:21] just keep on walking if I'll just stay
[1:48:23] faithful I'll just keep walking with the
[1:48:25] word I'm gonna it might feel natural it
[1:48:27] might feel human but if the prophet said
[1:48:30] for me to live this way then that's the
[1:48:31] way I'm going to live if the prophet
[1:48:33] said to walk around Jericho one more
[1:48:35] time then that's what I'm going to do
[1:48:36] because I have been thoroughly satisfied
[1:48:39] that it is under the Divine word of God
[1:48:41] We are following a Vindicated message
[1:48:44] that was given directly by the captain
[1:48:46] of the host of the Lord and that Captain
[1:48:48] has never lost a battle
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:56] I am satisfied
[1:49:00] if my wife would come to the piano here
[1:49:03] this morning
[1:49:04] I want to look at one last
[1:49:07] last thing here
[1:49:09] been talking about faith to walk
[1:49:13] do you have that face to walk
[1:49:16] maybe you got a Mustard Seed Faith
[1:49:20] maybe you got
[1:49:22] quite a few mustard seeds worth of faith
[1:49:25] maybe you got a whole barrel full
[1:49:28] I don't know
[1:49:30] I don't see your heart I can tell your
[1:49:32] faith is in this room though
[1:49:37] hey
[1:49:38] you know one day
[1:49:40] there was a man
[1:49:42] who broke every scientific law
[1:49:45] he broke through the barriers of science
[1:49:48] because the word
[1:49:51] told him he could do it
[1:49:53] Ram says Peter he was doing all right
[1:49:56] until he got scared
[1:49:58] the word told him he could walk on the
[1:50:01] water
[1:50:03] the word told him you can walk on the
[1:50:06] water you can walk through the fire you
[1:50:08] can go through this sickness you can
[1:50:10] make it through this situation the word
[1:50:12] told him to walk
[1:50:15] and he walked
[1:50:19] anybody here ever walked on H2O before
[1:50:24] we have no record of anybody ever doing
[1:50:27] this again
[1:50:29] nobody ever doing this before
[1:50:31] this is unprecedented
[1:50:34] but a man hears a word
[1:50:37] that came from the mouth of somebody
[1:50:39] that had been Vindicated
[1:50:42] and he jumped out of that boat and he
[1:50:45] walked on the water
[1:50:47] that's impossible you can't do that but
[1:50:51] he did that
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:56] and he stepped out of that boat and he
[1:50:57] went walking and and says here
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:07] he was scared at first
[1:51:10] he thought it was a ghost He said Lord
[1:51:12] if it's you bid me come to you on the
[1:51:14] water
[1:51:14] he said come on
[1:51:16] now that's just the same as James 5 14
[1:51:19] the same as Mark 16 the same God said it
[1:51:23] come on
[1:51:26] so he started walking and he done all
[1:51:29] right got down out of the ship and
[1:51:30] started walking on
[1:51:33] there was a storm there white caps
[1:51:37] terrifying experience and he allowed
[1:51:39] fear to slip in
[1:51:42] Jesus said come on he stepped down and
[1:51:44] he said it's the Lord I'll just walk but
[1:51:46] when he got his eyes on the waves he got
[1:51:49] scared what come in his mind first thing
[1:51:51] I'm going to walk because the word said
[1:51:54] for me to walk and the next thing he
[1:51:56] looked at well he looked at his symptoms
[1:51:59] he looked out there and he seen them big
[1:52:00] waves and he got scared
[1:52:02] and what what when he did down he went
[1:52:05] what he feared happened what he believed
[1:52:08] happened when he believed he could walk
[1:52:10] he walked when he believed got scared of
[1:52:13] his belief then his substance left him
[1:52:16] he still professed his faith but he
[1:52:18] didn't have the substance
[1:52:20] substance would have went right over the
[1:52:22] top of that y cap and went right on to
[1:52:25] him
[1:52:27] if he has the perfect Faith see but he
[1:52:30] didn't have it he thought he did he did
[1:52:33] at first that's what I want to focus on
[1:52:35] right there
[1:52:36] he did at first he was willing to
[1:52:39] venture right out why the Lord told me
[1:52:42] to do it it's got to happen so he just
[1:52:45] stepped right out of the boat and takes
[1:52:46] off he never thought about the ways how
[1:52:48] contrary there was he never got that in
[1:52:50] his mind
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] hey he walked on the water at first
[1:52:56] because he had perfect Faith at first
[1:53:02] then he got into his mind
[1:53:04] this isn't reasonable the doctor said
[1:53:07] this this isn't reasonable the situation
[1:53:09] is beyond control there's no way that
[1:53:11] this is ever going to change
[1:53:13] he started to get into his mind
[1:53:19] down he went
[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:24] friends
[1:53:26] I believe there's many different times
[1:53:27] in our life
[1:53:29] we've been in the presence of God
[1:53:32] we've been in the atmosphere of of the
[1:53:36] presence of God and something comes down
[1:53:38] and God speaks into our heart I pray
[1:53:40] today God spoke something into your
[1:53:42] heart and it hits you and something
[1:53:44] inside of you just rose up and said Lord
[1:53:45] I believe when you do that you're
[1:53:48] stepping out of the boat
[1:53:50] and you're walking on the water you have
[1:53:52] a perfect Faith you have a perfect
[1:53:53] assurance and you begin to walk on that
[1:53:55] water you begin to make steps one step
[1:53:58] at a time straight towards the Lord
[1:54:00] Jesus Christ you're moving and you're in
[1:54:03] the middle of a supernatural event
[1:54:04] you're in the middle of an absolutely
[1:54:06] miraculous thing
[1:54:08] it's just walking but it's absolutely
[1:54:10] Supernatural
[1:54:12] but then how long did Peter Walk On The
[1:54:15] Water France how long did he have
[1:54:17] perfect faith
[1:54:18] 10 seconds
[1:54:20] 30 seconds
[1:54:22] I mean it wasn't that long
[1:54:24] [Music]
[1:54:27] you had that perfect Faith at first
[1:54:30] and then he allowed that question to
[1:54:32] become in
[1:54:33] down he went
[1:54:37] I know I believe so many times we're in
[1:54:40] the middle of something God's doing God
[1:54:42] speaks to our heart Brother Sam right he
[1:54:45] speaks throughout our heart and he tells
[1:54:46] us something and that Faith just engages
[1:54:49] and it connects and maybe it's that
[1:54:50] Mustard Seed Faith maybe it's a great
[1:54:52] big perfect faith and them Supernatural
[1:54:54] begins to take place you step out of
[1:54:56] that boat and you start walking
[1:54:58] don't stop don't think about anything
[1:55:01] else you're already in the middle of a
[1:55:03] miracle friend you're already in the
[1:55:05] middle of a supernatural God doing
[1:55:07] Supernatural things you are doing what
[1:55:09] is impossible and you're there don't
[1:55:11] stop don't question don't look to the
[1:55:13] right hand don't look to the left you
[1:55:15] are in the middle of a miracle right
[1:55:17] then just keep walking just keep walking
[1:55:20] don't look at the wave don't look at the
[1:55:22] storm look at Jesus Christ the one who
[1:55:25] told you to walk look at Jesus Christ
[1:55:28] the one who gave you the promise and
[1:55:30] keep on walking just keep on walking
