sister Elizabeth's friends God bless you all good to have you and sister Alice good to have you back and feeling better amen and sister Martha back with us amen and I um I'm glad to be here I hadn't been feeling good the past few days and had a sore throat really bad and and I thought nah we're gonna we're coming anyway so we're here and I don't want to scare you but I will say I am doing better amen by the grace of God and so if you have your Bibles we're going to turn first of all to the Book of Proverbs and um got our meeting coming up and uh getting excited about it and we've already just seen the Lord moving yeah here and making way in in different areas and so just lets us know that the Lord Is With Us amen and so and I just really appreciate those of you that just excited about it amen and looking forward to what God has in store amen and got people just excited all over looking forward to great things and also we had uh talking to Brother Sam this morning and it was suggested and I think it was a good suggestion that brother Walker you know he's um been there in the nursing home and um it would be nice if if different ones of this could coordinate to see him every day just to cheer him up make sure that he is being taken care of and I know it is a lot on their daughter uh Carla having to take care of uh Sister Walker and sister Walker's pretty feeble herself and having to take her to different appointments and things and so there are days that she's not able to come and and um and so but if you would like to do that just to uh to help out just to visit you know um sometime in the week and 30 minutes or whatever any would be great and I know he would he would appreciate it and and just just to make sure that he's been taken care of you know and fed and whatever and I know I went there the other day and and someone's giving him you know he loves him pecan pies people giving him pecan a little pecan pies and there's a stack of them there was ants all over them and certainly don't want him eating ants you know and so um so you know I don't know how well you know he's taken care of I'm going to just believe that they're trying their best to take care of him but brother Walker is is part of us been here for many years and when the church was in a uh needing a pastor in a slump a lot of things going on brother Walker took it upon himself to try to help the church and he put us all into it and he actually developed shingles from it just a lot of pressure and but he was willing to do that for the sake of the church and I know he is he has been a tremendous support to me through through the thick and thin all the battles that this church has gone through and uh Walker always call me I got your back you know and and I'm with you so and that just meant so much to me and we want to have his back amen and help him and so we love brother and sister Walker and appreciate all that they've done for us amen and so you can talk with Brother Sam about that if you want to get with him and and say hey I'd like to come on a certain day or whatever and I think it'd be great um before we go into the word let's just bow our heads and talk to our father Lord Jesus as we approach your word now Father which is we believe to be the most important part of the service Lord for it's in your word that we find healing power we find The Virtue we find everything that we would have need of Lord is when you speak the word Lord and your spirit goes from that Lord upon the congregation I have seen eyes come open just through the preaching of the Gospel seen the lame walk seen things happen father and I know there's power in the word I've seen people get the Holy Ghost just through the preaching of the word Lord there's nothing impossible and I pray father that your anointing would just drop in now and Lord that you would anoint not only me but anoint the hearer of the word and may you have the preeminence in every heart this morning any spirit that would try to uh hinder the service that would take our thoughts away Lord I pray that you would just your angels would just stand by every Pew father and drive every demonic power away from this place we ask it father we love you we praise you and father as we would set up the tent this afternoon I pray that you would be with us give us help the grace father and let everything just go okay father and we're just looking forward to a wonderful time Lord in the meetings coming up we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and everyone says amen The Book of Proverbs we want to look first of all we've been reading this um and and I would start at the first verse the Proverbs of Solomon the son of David king of Israel to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding to receive the instruction of wisdom Justice and judgment and equity to give subtility to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion a wise man will hear and will increase learning in a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels to understand the proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings the seventh verse here to focus on is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction then I'm going to go to a familiar scripture and that's in Ephesians chapter 1. we've talked on it here in the past but the book of Ephesians and if I can find it here when I do I'll say Amen um praise the Lord amen got it so Ephesians 1 and um we're going to look um start at the 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body everybody say which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all and that's the knowledge that Paul is praying that you have amen and then Romans 18 11 familiar scripture that We Know by heart I guess that uh Romans 8 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen you can have your seats this morning and as it's been mentioned we're you know this is the day of Easter then we have come just for many as a memorial and um but um we know that Easter is something special to us maybe in a different way um Easter of course speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so many are gathered this morning in their churches to um to honor the resurrection or to hold it as a memorial and um no doubt there are many that are giving an Easter play um and and that is to take us back in into time and give us a history lesson as to uh what happened two thousand years ago to let us know that he did rise from the grave and and that he is alive but but that that that gives us a knowledge but it's only a knowledge of History and you know don't don't get me wrong history is good it's it's good to know history it's needed because history helps us to identify uh with the past of what happened it by history we understand uh uh our day uh by certain events that took place in in the past and uh it helps us to understand the pattern of world events National events Church events um and and these things we find that there is a pattern of the rise and fall of Nations there is a pattern of the rise and fall of churches there is a pattern of Revival igniting and dying there is a pattern as to how the devil Works um so so with that we can can look back to history and understand uh really get a great better understanding of what is taking place in the age that we're living in and and even jesus takes things back into history and and he would tell us now as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in in the coming of the son of man or the revealing as it was in the days of lot so he's given us a history lesson and and letting us know that you can go back in history and see what that was and then know the day that you're living in so we thank God for the history uh by history of the Bible we can identify as the prophet would tell us we can identify our present condition as individuals as a church Nation whatever with and and and with the characters of The Bible and of other ages so so again we can look at the characters that uh of past history in this Bible and we we can identify ourselves our character our actions and everything uh and and we can we can know as to what we are and uh by by that uh like like someone would say well if if I could just uh been back in when Jesus was alive and uh when he walked the Earth boy I would love him I I would oh man I wouldn't be no I wouldn't I wouldn't be no Judas that's for sure I I wouldn't be those people looking around saying well who is this as he's riding down fulfilling scriptures riding on the donkey and he's fulfilling what Isaiah said I sure wouldn't be that I'd be the one throwing the branches and all of that I'd be the one to recognize him well you know as as we find though that we have that opportunity just as they did in this age here because he's alive and so how we react to the to to him today would let us know what we would be back then uh uh and these things so uh uh but but having a knowledge of his resurrection of just uh 2 000 years ago it does not bring the fear of the Lord and this is what we had been talking about is that knowledge uh uh begins with the fear of the Lord um uh if any man has knowledge then then the beginning of that knowledge is the fear of the Lord and so then we find there's a certain knowledge that we must have and that's not a knowledge of what God was ain't that right amen because you know if he did rise 2 000 years ago and we say that he is alive today then we must ask where is he today ain't that right where is he today uh uh it's one thing to say he's alive but then while we're saying that we've never experienced his reality of being alive we've in and so therefore he just becomes a figment of our imagination and then if he's a figment of our imagination if we then all of our ritual religious rituals it means nothing it's just it's being done out of Duty if we're doing it all and never experience a living God today then then it's it's just a god of history and we everything we're doing is in honor of a god of yesterday and and these things but according uh to Hebrews 13 and 8 amen the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ the same yesterday so if he is the same and if he is alive then what he was yesterday he is today he is his character his nature his power his attributes his love his his his his intimal uh innermost heart uh what he is what he he still is today do you believe that amen if he created back then he can do it today if he spoke the uh the word back then and the word had results it can happen today do you believe that amen if he walked on the water back then he can walk on the water today if he turned the water into wine he can do it again today if he calls the blind eyes to see back then he could do it today amen why he is the same person do you believe that amen now that's why we say he's alive and and if we really believe he's alive then it then we believe in the impossibility I don't care if the doctor says and and and uh that you're going to die tomorrow amen if we believe is a lie then we'll never listen to what that doctor says we'll look at the word of God and and say well you know what he raised Lazarus from the dead that had been four days from the dead so there's nothing impossible with God can you say amen amen so then we find that we're looking at this Resurrection amen and we find that Resurrection is not a replacement amen it's not a replacement but it means to bring the same thing amen back a man to life again that that which was bring that back to to reality or to life a man that which went down to be raised back up that which went away to bring it back again so we're not talking about a the Lutheran Church a man coming back to life we're not talking about the Pentecostal age coming back to life we're not talking about some Revival of yesterday coming back to life we're talking about his resurrection there is no Resurrection in some denomination there there there is no Resurrection in a Lutheran Revival there there is no rev uh Resurrection in a Pentecostal Revival you understand what I'm saying amen people say oh if we could go back to 1906 and uh to what they had back then there's no Resurrection for that amen we're talking about a different Resurrection can you say amen amen we're talking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so we're not wanting to know a church we're not wanting to to have an experience with the denomination we're not wanting to have an experience in some thing dangled way what we want to know is we want to know him he's the one that we declare to be alive he's the one that we need to declare that he has risen now this word to know is to have a a knowledge to know have a knowledge and so now the Bible just doesn't declare to us what he was two thousand years ago and it doesn't declare to us just what he is to be a man in the future but the Bible declares to us what He is today and I'll declare to you there are more scriptures that speak of this day than any other age amen that's that's right amen this speaks of his second coming a man more than his first coming ain't that right amen that's right and so it declares a man what he is today amen and and so you know the prophet told us that people always praise God for what he has done amen and that's good I'm glad what he did amen but we can put our focus on that amen and and and come up short amen and then man always praises God for what he's going to do amen which is good amen because we got a bright future amen but they failed to see what he's doing today a man is because a man they have a knowledge of what he has done and they have this knowledge in some form of what he's going to do amen but they don't have the knowledge of what he is doing present tense today ain't that right amen but we see we've got to have a knowledge for for the Bible says to know Christ is life he that hath the son has life ain't that right amen so we want to know Christ not as and yesterday not amen uh there's there's I'm gonna just say it there's not life in knowing Christ of what he was 2 000 years ago amen there's not life in what he's doing in in the future but to know him today is life to know what he is today to know what he's doing today is life ain't that right to know where he is today wherever he is there is life amen that's right and there's only one way to know him do you believe that only one way to know him is not by book learning not by reading the Bible amen every year through from Genesis to Revelation that's not the way to know him amen but here it is in Philippians 3 and 10. Paul says that I may know him and the power of his resurrection ain't that right that's the only way to know him and this word no now listen the word no means to perceive to understand to have a knowledge of to become acquainted with so not know of him Paul Paul didn't say I want to know of his resurrection a man I want to know about him his resurrection that he says I want to know him and the power of his resurrection now notice how brother Branham interprets the scripture of what Paul is saying I want to know him in the power of his resurrection can you say Amen now that's the only way to know him is when you know him in the power of his resurrection I can tell you that for 2 000 years I could tell you A Hundred Years or or for an eternity all about God that if you don't know him in his power of the Resurrection then you'll never know him can you say man so Easter is is is is is not just about 2 000 years ago that Easter it means something personal to us can you say man as Believers now the prophet said the only thing you have to know everybody say the only thing I have to know the only thing you have to know is the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ he said let me go with that that saved me from sin what saved you the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ what redeemed you the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ what delivered you the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ what changed you from a sinner to a saint the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen now we're not talking about these old uh so-called Christians that still smoking their cigarettes and drinking her beer and having all these kinds of party and said I'm a Christian oh no no no no you got to know him in the power of his resurrection well what happened in his resurrection corruption tried to set in but there was a power that stopped that corruption and raised him into newness of life ain't that right and that same corruption amen sin is nothing but the power of Darkness sin is nothing but the power of corruption in your soul can you say Amen but let that power of Resurrection come into that Soul it'll stop that corruption right there amen and them cuss words amen will flee from you amen them evil thoughts them evil actions improversion amen can you say Amen it'll change you from a homosexual to a right person that you're supposed to be it'll change you from a transgender back to way God created you to be you've got to know him in the power of his resurrection know him it saved me from sin it'll heal my sickness and see that's all you have to know everybody say that's all I have to know is no hymn In The Power of his resurrection ain't that right so then what we're saying then is your knowledge then comes by experience your knowledge comes by experience not by book learning but now I know him that he's risen not because I saw an Easter play I know that he is risen not because my preacher told me he has risen I know that he has risen not because Mom and Dad just comes to church and tells me amen every day of my life that that he has risen but now I know him in the very power of his resurrection amen and when you know him in the power of his resurrection then then no one can convince you that he didn't raise you know that he rose you believe it with all your heart because you have experienced the same power [Applause] ain't that right so now your knowledge comes by experience experience it means this the fact or state of having been affected by or gained knowledge through direct observation or participation something personally encountered undergone or lived through that's that's what your knowledge is now it's an experience you personally have witnessed it you personally have gone through it you personally have have they experienced this and undergone and lived through this the act or process of directly perceiving events or reality so I know him by experience and that's the knowledge that we want to have amen amen now we we find that Bible scholars and theologians constantly ridicule brother Branham for not knowing how to to to talk right and to how to pronounce his his words correctly and things like that and his reply to them was this I wished I did no better words and grammar but if it's taking anything away from Jesus I'd rather know Jesus anytime and know him in the power of his resurrection can you say amen and I don't I don't want Pulpit manners if it's going to take me from the reality of Jesus Christ amen I I don't want Church manners if we don't know you know in other words get so formal to where we we know what to do and and how many songs to sing and well we can't go over the 15-minute Mark you know what I'm saying amen if that's going to take away from us knowing him in the resurrection power of his resurrection to where God can't move upon the sinner anymore that God can't feel with the Holy Ghost anymore and God can't do nothing because we've got a time schedule amen I'd rather take all of that away that I may know him and the power of his resurrection ain't that right amen so many young people this Young Generation amen they're they're missing out upon the experience of Jesus Christ amen because they got church orders and church this and church that Church format do away with your formality and get so loosed in God till God can have his way in your life amen to where God can get some time and to change you can you say amen that's right amen well it you know it's true anyway I'd rather know Jesus anytime a lot of time we make our church services so short amen that God you know it takes a lot longer time these days I really think amen for God to break through these these mind battles and that God to break through Amen to them heart hearts that God can break through Amen to the carnalism amen that we just put a time to God Amen and said and saying God we need you more than anything my children need you amen my neighbor needs you we need a move of God Amen and we need to know you in the power of your Resurrection ain't that right now so now listen it's not it's not to know him by his word Ram said that's a long way from being sufficient it's not know him by deed we got to know him by person of his resurrection now look look with me uh uh they'll put it on the screen I guess but second Corinthians 5 14. For the Love of Christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which should live not henceforth uh unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth we know no man after the flesh yea though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now have since his resurrection we know him no more after the flesh the resurrection changed something did it not we thank God for the resurrection amen see Paul now the Apostle Paul was writing this we we no longer know Christ after the flesh not since he's risen from the dead amen and and and and so now the the Apostle Paul never knew Jesus in his physical manner in his physical form amen the only way he knew him was by a revelation by a vision amen and brother Brown said see Paul only knew Jesus by the Revelation just like Peter did amen now remember the Revelation is greater knowing him and the power of his resurrection is greater than even knowing him if he was sitting here in flesh and you were shaking his hand amen see amen because Jesus asked Peter he says whom do men say that I the son of man am or asked his disciples well everybody was guessing they saw him they ate with him they they they they slept maybe in the same area that that he was in they ate breakfast with him they prayed Amen to together amen whatever they done they watched him even do the Miracles and things but when he gave them the test and said who do men say that I am oh a lot of guesses well you're a good prophet and you're this one you're that and you're that but whom do you say that I am amen and Peter said Thou Art the Christ amen the son of the Living God Amen now listen now amen see he he had seen him in the flesh but now he knew him not after the flesh ain't that right he knew him in a greater way amen and notice amen Jesus said this he said Matthew 16 and and and uh uh we'll go to 17 in Matthew 16 17 and Jesus said unto him Peter blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto you now think of it amen he could have set here in flesh and he could have lived with them and stayed with them and done all kinds of signs and wonders with them amen and before them and yet it could not give them a greater Revelation because he couldn't know them after the flesh amen but he said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee amen but my Father which is in heaven ain't that right amen so the prophet said even Jesus's own life amen there on Earth his works and all that did not reveal this to Peter amen Peter had walked with him talked with him touched him but he didn't know Christ by those things that's right see and so uh Paul had something greater amen uh than any of the uh uh the the apostles amen because even though he didn't walk with him excuse me even though he didn't walk with him and even though he didn't lay hands amen or or his physical Eyes Upon that physical being amen he knew him in a greater way amen the prophet said the the disciples could have said to Paul we have more of a revelation because we ate with him we sat by him amen we we've done all these things see we watched him perform but Prophet said that Paul saw him after he was dead buried and rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel can you say Amen so Paul Paul Paul uh had the same Revelation that Moses had Paul had the same Revelation all the way down Through the Ages saw him for what he was ain't that right didn't just build a memorial to a man as the people are doing today building a memorial to a man of 2000 years ago amen but here we're finding out that we've seen Christ not after the flesh we're not knowing him after the flesh we're new with him by revelation [Music] because Jesus promised to build his church upon Revelation Upon This Rock I'll build my church amen not upon an Easter play not on on an Easter egg not on a Memorial Day of Memorial unto me will I build my church but Upon This Rock upon this revelation of who I am will I build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it now brother Brown says now scholar can sit down and read that word till he can just tie your mind up in any way if he wants to do it because he's smart and Brilliant thank you yeah uh because he's smart and brilliant get a Catholic priest or not so much as that as a good trained Theologian in the Bible brother of Baptist or Presbyterian or something he'll make you think that you don't know nothing when it comes to talk what it's because that he has known him in the flesh his word ain't that right see the word so so brother Branham is telling us that you can take this Bible and you can read it over and over and be so skilled in this Bible a man but you can oh you're only knowing him in the flesh you understand what I'm saying and and that's what the scholars have done they've studied the Bible brother Brown even said he could take the Presbyterian Doctrine and tie the Pentecostals till they wouldn't know what to do he could take the Baptist Doctrine and show the Pentecostals a million things that they know nothing of he said but that's not it that's not his church can you say amen amen scholarly that's not his church dignified that's not his church that that that being all of these things Amen brother Brown said his church is himself revealed why because you're the body of the Lord Jesus Christ upon this Earth his church is himself revealed and expressed by the word itself that he is God I hope it's okay I hope it's making sense to you see so the only way that you can know him is by Revelation and he is the word of God Amen he is the word so it's the word revealed to you by revelation we're going to get to more into in just a moment the word revealed to you by Revelation now brother Branham asked the question then how do you know it's revealed to you notice what he says it lives itself and expresses himself through you now that's how we know that it's not just mental learning but it's actually by Revelation that we have received is because it lives the word lives through you oh my then see then it it makes us more than just a church member then it it makes this it makes us Stand Out than just the average Church goer no wonder church is so boring to many people is because they've never experienced the God Amen that the church talks about amen the church is not this building it's something that we have dedicated that that we could come together but we're the Church of the Living God we're the one that has the pillar fire living within us do you believe that amen see and so when we come together like this then the pillar of fire every one of us has brought a lick of fire together amen and deity is made known Amen in this place and church God should be able to do anything impossible in this place we should come with such an expectation because we know beyond a shot of Adele that he has risen he is alive because I brought him with how many he's brought him with you this morning I brought him with me amen that's why we could look at the challenges that we face and say I know God's going to make a way I know God is going to save I know that God is going to deliver I know he is alive he's alive and I've witnessed it I know him in the power of his resurrection if he saved me he can save you if he delivered me he can deliver you because I look at myself as the chief sinner of you amen if he can reach down and save a rotten ratchet Center like me I know he can save you I know he can do it can you say man see and so it's revealed how do we know it's living itself it's expressing God expressing himself through you now if you notice when John received the revelation of Jesus Christ he wasn't given a history lesson ain't that right this revelation of Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelations it was John receiving the revelation of Jesus Christ but he wasn't given a history lesson he didn't go back through memory lane and reminisce of all the experience he had with Jesus and what Jesus done and Jesus this and Jesus that no this is a greater revelation a greater revelation ain't that right well what was revealed to John then that Jesus Christ that was dead is now alive notice in Revelations 1 17 John said when I saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen can you see man and notice now so he's not reminiscing of what he was before his resurrection he is seeing him as alive after his resurrection because why he says I have the keys of hell and of death he did not have that when John walked with him but now in this Revelation when John sees that he is alive he sees something he possesses the keys of death and of Hell amen that Resurrection meant something to us can you say amen amen now know this now notice John talked about his shoulder he saw his shoulder he saw his feet he saw his eyes he talked about it right amen he talked about his hair ain't that Brian talked about his voice but John wasn't describing Jesus in his physical body as to what when he he he was when John walked and talked with him John the prophet said John was given the revelation of the Sevenfold glory of the person of Jesus Christ in his resurrection foreign in his resurrection now I'm not against I'm not against the plays and all that we went and watched uh one the other night you know and and enjoyed it you know and they they put in a good a play uh so we're not against that but but but we but we do see but we do see that all they can show us a man is just a a replica of what Jesus was before he he raised you understand what I'm saying amen but hear what John is seeing and what John is is showing what is being shown to John is not a play but he's showing what Christ is after this Resurrection oh my ah God's showing that to the world today amen praise the Lord I go okay I gotta be careful so so it was a revelation of his glorious being okay so what does John sing Christ in his church why amen because it's after his resurrection he saw him in his church which is his body the fullness everybody say the fullness fullness Perfection completion of him ain't that right so this is what Paul what is what Paul was saying in Colossians 1 27 to whom God I didn't give this to you and but to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory notice now this is a knowledge that we needed and he would he would make this knowledge he would give us this knowledge God would make known to us ain't that right what is the riches of this mystery among the Gentiles not the Jews among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory now in in in in what I believe is that mystery that Paul just spoke of is being made known today do you believe that it's being made known in this age now Jesus it goes to fulfill what Jesus said because I live you shall live also ain't that right now brother Branham in speaking of this day said this is the age of life the personal life of Christ what was in him the life that was in him is now to be made known Christ in you everybody say Christ in me the hope of glory amen see the same life The Same Spirit the same quickening power that was in him see now this is the age for Tolkien ain't that right it's the evening time this is what the token is amen is is the life a man see it's the age of life amen so then this is the age to know him in the power of his resurrection this is where this is where we're at amen see raised again see so now what are we then living in the Fulfillment of ezekiel's vision which was prophetic a man of the of the dry bones Ezekiel I didn't give this to you either but Ezekiel 37 and one I uh uh just got this down in my office there the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and calls me to pass by them round about and behold there were many in the open Valley and low they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live it was a desolate uh picture it was it was horrible and I answer oh Lord God thou knowest again he saith unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them O ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live now if you'll notice in the following verses now God chose the four stages of restoration and I will lay sin you upon you first stage and will bring up flesh upon you second stage and cover you with skin the third stage brother Brown said see first stage Luther second stage Wesley amen for the third stage Pentecost ain't that right and put breath in you and you shall live for stage and you shall know when at the time that you live at the time that you breathe that life comes into your blood Your Vessel you shall know a knowledge a knowledge you'll know that I am the Lord yeah so I prophesied and as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld uh uh Lo the sinew and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them amen now think of a we had come through Wesley or Luther Wesley and the Pentecostal age but there was no breath man can you say man amen there was no breath amen see he says uh that then he says unto me prophesy unto the wind be prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breathe and breathe upon this a breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live see the fourth stage amen and the prophet identified this stage as his message can you say amen God would identify this age amen what was it it was the revealing of the Mysteries amen no longer was it a theologian standing there amen no longer was it just a teacher standing there or a preacher standing there preaching all kinds of traditions and ideas amen there was a prophet of God Amen that was bringing the restoration of these Mysteries it was the Breath of God that was breathing upon the body of Christ can you say amen and all I can say is I thank God that he has revealed the Mysteries unto us I'm so glad amen that God has come himself through a prophet come from the Four Winds and breathe so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived what is it a resurrection they lived oh my we find what it is it's the Breath of God amen and he stood up on their feet they stood up on their feet in an exceeding great Army ain't that right you love him now notice as it was in the days of Jesus first coming so is it in this day someone had to be on earth at the time of this coming his coming to Earth to introduce him to the people there had to be an introduction to the Messiah because the people didn't know he was among them it took a prophet to bring the knowledge ain't that right so in John 1 26 John the Baptist said their standeth one among you whom you know not now it was John that was sent to introduce the Messiah at that first coming here it was Jesus was there but the people didn't know it took a profit amen it took a profit a man uh uh and I say a word Prophet a man to introduce the word Messiah ain't that right they're standing one among you whom you not know and it wasn't until the next day that John introduced him to the people saying Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world so he was standing there among them and they didn't know it Amen brother Brown said before he was recognized by anybody come to the prophet he was the word and John was a prophet ain't that right so theologians cannot recognize him yeah that's you know theologians are fine but they're not not they're they're not showing me Christ now this again this is why brother Brandon would say we're getting the people to church not to Christ because it took a profit to do it come on now they're having church church Revival Revival Revival bride bride bride bride bride he's saying there's got to come one ain't that right but there was nothing there that the theologians had to introduce him the scholars and all their teaching amen it was not called to introduce but there would be a prophet that would come and introduce now for people to say that message people ain't getting people to Christ they're ignorant and unlearned I know Mrs preachers constantly blasting message people it just bothers me message Pete for the cream of the crop yeah now I'm not saying that they're they're you know I mean there's Hypocrites among everybody but there's genuine there and that's where you're only going to find genuine people that are ready for a bride people that's going on in the Rapture is is it sitting there in message churches so don't throw the whole lump out just preach promises hello so we find now John John introduced him because that's what the Bible says he would do prepare the way of the Lord so then to prove that John was right Jesus performed a sign of Messiah now the prophet said in in the presence of God unrecognized that he come Jesus come in his right sign he come according to the promise and he performed the Messiah signed Andrew believed it he performed assigned to Peter he believed it he performed that same Messiah sign a man to the woman at the well she believed it he ain't ain't that right wow they were predestinated seed just just have to say it that way and notice look at the woman at the well she said sir I know that when the Messiah cometh he will tell us these things or all things in other words he will reveal the secrets of the heart ain't that right and then Jesus turns around says I am he that speaks to you oh my see so he proved that John was right in his introduction that he was the Messiah amen but then also did he just say it's dormant after after John introduced him as the Messiah absolutely not and and this is where the church cannot just set dormant Christ will not just set dormant because the prophet left the scene John fully declared I must decrease that he may increase he knew that two could not stand on Earth at the same time so don't just look and depend on a prophet and say well Prophet needs to come back you're against the scriptures when you say that then you say amen for if you are Miss Jesus Christ then that was what the prophet was to introduce was Jesus Christ in your flesh if you're the body of Jesus Christ the prophet came to introduce Christ among the world today in your flesh so he didn't just set dormant after the introduction no sir he did exactly what the scripture said he would do he healed the sick raised the dead calls the blind to see he said at Liberty them that were bruised ain't that right now notice the prophet said we've got to come to a place again to something that's going to introduce the Messiah now Church we're not reading that quote as though we're looking for something to come we we're reading this quote and declaring it had to come and it has come the introduction has been made ain't that right amen now Christ was not introduced to us though as a traditional thought you know see the the the tradition there's a traditional thought about Jesus coming foreign and and the tradition has him coming in clouds in the sky and all the world looking at him and they're looking to see him in his physical form the Bible says that we will not see him in his physical form on Earth he never promised to come in his physical body on Earth and you say man but now they're looking to see him in his physical form and we believe that we will see him in his physical form a man but the world will not see him ain't that right not everybody is going to see him in his physical body not not not at this not at the rat in time of rapture the Bible says we'll be caught up to meet him in the air and there's only going to be a certain few that's going to meet him in the air amen now notice first Thessalonians 5 and 1 but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety are they not saying that then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief can you say Amen so there's going to be people the coming of the Lord a man will be as a thief in the night he comes as a thief and what does the thief do come to get the jewels well in the night while everybody's asleep he sneaks in there he picks what he wants and he take and he's gone before they wake up and they realize he came and gone ain't that right sometimes it takes it takes a week sometimes it takes days before they realize what just happened but the valuables are gone yeah now Church there's valuables on this Earth that's his body now brother Brown said the first thing you know you're going to say well I thought there was supposed to be a Rapture before the tribulation see the tribulation is going to strike and what it would be uh what would it be awful if you heard say well it's already been and you didn't know it see there will be one in the field I'll take one and leave one just somebody come up missing there'll be just a very very few in that Rapture that'll be changed see the sleeping bride the bride that's been taken Through the Ages see she will come forth first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them just one here one there one over here and and this thing see at least every day across the world there is as many as 500 people missing and people don't even know about you never hear about it see what if there was a thousand they would say oh well this woman she just run off with somebody this preacher he just took some other man's wife and is gone he went to the Bahamas or something like that we just can't find him he's about what's happened he's gone to glory in the Rapture and they won't know it and you say Amen see so here's the traditional thought that he will be introduced is that we all look at him in the in the clouds and everybody's rejoicing The Sinner the saint those that despised him church people that didn't like church they don't like the word that's ready to get out at a certain time they just suspect everybody's going to sit there and glorify him that ain't the way it's going to be he's coming as a thief for his valuables in other words he's coming for those that's got his own life in them ain't that right that's what's valuable so Luke 17 30 tells us that he's going to be revealed or introduced as the son of man so then God would send us a prophet and his ministry was to introduce the Messiah now I want to ask you did he introduce a messiah that's dead did he introduce a messiah that is a historical figure did he introduce to us some fairy tale absolutely not now notice in the Book of Revelations we see that John was caught up into the Lord's Day and I have to say it's this day it's the day that Messiah was to be introduced can you say Amen it was in this day that he was caught up in and when he saw him he saw him as being alive and Alive forevermore can you say Amen church he saw him walking in the midst of the candlesticks he heard him speaking and his voice was the sound of many Waters now I'm getting ready to close but you know good and well for 1500 years the church has had him sealed away the Holy Spirit the prophet said has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's in this day the day that John was caught up in the day that the Messiah was to be introduced it is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time message no other message but the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time we read this last Sunday but the ministry brother Brown said is to make known the Lord Jesus his presence our objective mainly is for you to see the presence of Jesus Christ and to know that he is here oh do you love him I love him now our knowledge of Christ must first of all come by the scripture that's where the problem lies today people don't know what the Bible has said about him people don't know or what he is to be in this day and age and they have misplaced the scriptures by their theology and work doctrines until the presence of Jesus Christ is not recognized now brother Brown said how will the people that's believing him know it unless they're constantly in the word to know what he is just like the woman at the well when he he he performed the Messiah sign to her she said sir I know that when the Messiah cometh he'll do these things well how did she know she had read it from the word so this introduction of Messiah is not going to be all in the hands people rolling on the floor doing somersaults hello amen having all these kinds of things that's not Messiah a man see I'm not saying people won't do them things I'm just saying that's not that's not sign of Messiah because we know Satan does them things as well ain't that right yes sir see I'll just tell you one time uh a while back about the preach that got caught up in that that that that started practicing the Witchcraft the pastor in his church started passing practicing Witchcraft and had a man lay on the floor and then raised him up in the air and he was floating in the air by witchcraft now Church that's not the sign of Messiah ain't that right so so your recognition of Messiah must come from scriptures ain't that right see her knowledge the woman at the well her knowledge was based upon scripture see the two disciples that walked on the road to Emmaus didn't know the scripture the prophet said that's the reason they didn't know him see now he is here tonight we read this the other morning Sunday morning he is here tonight identifying his presence by the prophecies foretold for this age he is the same yesterday today and forever do you believe it the church has Twisted up the scriptures so much down Through the Ages till they can't make heads or Tales of it we couldn't I couldn't make heads or tails of it see and Satan has designed it that way amen because when Jesus Christ is not recognized the prophet said his power is not revealed I'll say that again when Jesus is not recognized in the presence of Jesus Christ he is not recognized the power of God is Not revealed brother Brown said no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it like the woman with the issue of blood see all them people passing by all them standing up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all such as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if I could only touch His Garment is that right and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith that saved you what did it her faith understanding there might have you know been sicker than she was but you see she recognized his presence and she knowed that that was her opportunity my what an opportunity we have been given in this age not just to be church members not just to go to church and do a religious duty but we have been privileged to recognize his presence and everything that you have need of is granted to you if you need Deliverance just recognize his presence is here and you can have that Deliverance his power and it's gone even to the place that his rapturing power is being released unto us transformation power is being released unto the people that has recognized him he said if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose and that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and how now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promised word of Moses age or any of any other ages but the promise of the the word for this age can you say Amen so let's look at a promise for this age shall we a man Luke 2 11 29 this is an evil generation and they seek a sign now another place he called it an adulterous and wicked generation amen and there shall no sign be given ungiven it but the sign of Jonas the prophet for as Jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation now run uh the presence of God unrecognized brother Branham said Jesus was actually prophesying of this age there is not a man there's never been an evil age like this age today there has never been an adulterous age as this age today can you say amen and yet Jesus told them that there will be one sign and only one that will be given to this unbelieving generation and that'll be the sign of his resurrection for as Jonas Rose amen from that that that that that that that uh body of water and come out of that uh uh uh that that whale amen that would be the sign a man that would come would be Messiah would be rise again would raise again and what is that brother Brown said he would raise amen from the Creeds of man he would raise from the traditions of men he would raise from the unbelief of men through all the ages and he would rise and show himself alive to this generation and that would be the sign that he that this generation would get and you say man it's the sign of his resurrection he is see is the show in this age he is the show that he is alive in this age he is to show that he is alive now church amen as much as I enjoy you know the the the plays and all of these things I'm you know I'm I'm not against that until you know I enjoy it I I you know you enjoy them saying amen but we don't need that to know that he's alive hey man I'm not here to tell you that he's alive of what happened to 2000 years ago I'm telling you you're living in age where God promised he would be alive he would show himself and he has shown himself alive and if you can recognize his presence his power will be released to you see he's going to show himself alive it will not be a church replacing him it won't be a denomination replacing him it won't be a theologian replacing him we're not to receive a sign of his replacement we are to receive a sign of his resurrection can you say Amen amen what he was then he'll be today what he did back then he'll do today can you say Amen oh do you love him isn't he wonderful amen that's right see so we have been given the sign that he promised to give to this generation now if I'm gonna I'm gonna close but what was he back then John 1 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the 14th verse and the Word was made flesh every prophecy that spoke of Messiah became flesh in Messiah right everything every type every shadow you read about the natural lamb how they they sacrifice and offer to Natural lamb in the Old Testament it only spoke of him he was the the ultimate sacrifice he was the high priest oh he was the temple the Shekinah Glory came in for it was God in Christ when God was in Christ no longer did the Shekinah Glory come into the the the natural Tabernacle the glory departed from that because he was now in the true Tabernacle can you say Amen oh we could go on and on and on the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and the Bible says in him was life and the life was the light of men we could go on and on about that light in life but in him was the life and the life was the light of men now he was the word now notice Hebrews 4 and 12 the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the deciding dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the Johnson Mara and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now you think of what that word is what a powerful thing that word is think of it now on the day of judgment man's going to stand at that judgment throne on Judgment Day and they're going to be judged by only one thing and that's by the word of God and he is the word the Bible says that every creature will stand us naked before him the word Hebrews 4 13 for there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight you can cover it up by television you can cover it up by Hollywood you can cover it up by makeup you can cover it up by wearing wigs you get even cover it up by changing your gender if you can you can cover it up by digging digging the biggest biggest deepest cave in the ground you can cover it up with comedy you can cover it up by hardening your heart you can cover it up with your smile on your face you can cover any it all up but when it comes to the word you will stand his naked before him for he says all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him which is the word when Nathaniel stood before him and Jesus told him who he was Nathaniel saith unto me unto him when snow is thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee what was it it was the word discerning for it was him the word brother Brown says when he comes that word will come against all nations and all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as he did with net Nathaniel the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man and why he did them it will divide asunder Romans 2 and 3 says and thank us thou o man that that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou shall escape the Judgment of God brother Brown said the the hard impenent in penitent heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged there will not be any respect before God and all is going to be judged by the word and no one shall Escape it those who heard and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested in it saying they believed it and didn't live it will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the house stops oh we will really understand history then there won't be a mystery left from all the ages why because the word is the discerner the word is the one that opens no one will stand a man covered up amen no matter what excuse you have amen when you come by that word the word will expose every heart every motive everything and the excuses that we have and buried and covered ourselves and used to hide and pretend Amen in all these things it'll all be made open it's going to be true judgment why because the word is a discerner but what has he done in this age see the word became flesh and there was nothing that could be hid from him he knew the thoughts he knew what they deserved in their heart he knew what that Pharisee was where he said you're of your father the devil only the word could known that ain't that right you see it's the word that reveals and so has the word come in this age Messiah the sign of Messiah has happened again the hearts of men have been revealed right night after night as brother Brandon would stand on that platform and discern the hearts tell them what their address was tell them what their name was tell them what was wrong even when the doctors couldn't know and just tell what was wrong the doctors would say well it's this and the prophet would stand there and by that word would discern and say no it's not that it's this ain't that right what was it it was the word revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age that we're living in showing that the Messiah is on the Earth again you say Amen brother Brahm said it is the word it is performing where unto it was sent for it the word is full of power it is the same spirit that was in Jesus the word that is present again in the church in this last age as a last sign trying to head the people off from judgment for they that reject him the word are now already come into judgment crucifying him afresh ain't that right now not only have we seen the word Discerning but it's still discerning do you believe that listen now as I get ready to close but I want you to listen Hebrews 5 and 12 for when for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not a strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full of a a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern everybody say to discern both good and evil now church we have come the church has come to the place of full age do you believe that adoption time this is adoption time and the church has ripened in the presence of the Sun you all know it but read the re read it I mean we'll listen to the messages she is the only one this bride the Church of the Living God is the only one that has the ability to discern between right and wrong Good and Evil therefore she is showing forth the resurrection of Jesus Christ by her discernment why because he is the only one that could discern can you say Amen now we may not be Discerning the hearts and all these things in in the sense of what brother Branham done but but the word has been made known to us that has given us a knowledge hello goes why we're in and live in an age of mixing colors everything wants to mix everything is a Christian everybody is is saved everybody wants to be religious everybody is now we're living in a time of melting pot Don't Preach hard don't you condemn me don't you talk to me about hell I've been in the message I've been in the church for 50 some years how dare you tell me how to live I don't care if you've been in it a hundred years we still have a discernment of the word ain't that right so here we find what is discernment it's Revelation that's that's what discernment is it's Revelation and that's what the true church is built upon so now now the prophet said only he Christ the word can discern ain't that right and he's the spirit of truth that was promised to come in this age the Bible never promised to introduce to us a psychologist brother Graham said psychology is a shot in the dark hello but he promised that he would be introduced as the spirit of Truth so now look at the age that we're living in this is the age we're living now Isaiah 5 and 20 we've read it before but woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put forth put light for Darkness then uh or Darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and pruded in their own sight woe unto them that are Mighty to drink wine and Men of string to mingle strong drink now you can use that in in a spiritual application of how in Revelation she has made all men to drink of the wine of her fornication and and on and on and on which justify the wicked for reward in other words they reward the wicked for their evil doings and their their wrong doing an unrighteous doings and and all that and they take away the righteousness of the righteous from him so this is prophesying of the people of this age that would have no discernment between good and evil right and wrong no wonder it's the most deceptive age ever and Jesus would tell us amen that it would be so close of a deception that it would deceive the very elect if it wasn't if it was possible and you say Amen but in this time of deception there is a people that's been given a discernment to no right wrong why he is alive he the word is quickening the word to us he's alive notice the word is in the bride do you believe it not not how you gonna get that you're going to eat that no the word The Living Word the spirit of Truth is in the bride that same word that that that that that discern the hearts of men and women that same word is in this bride and we have that spirit of discernment to know what between good and evil between right and wrong and we know I have to keep that balance Amen in the word because it's a spirit of discernment now notice the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know or to discern what he once done with the word they do only his will they're not mixed up they're not mixed up and saying everything is his will they're not looking at every Christian out here and everybody just all this and and said oh that must please God Amen looking at the rock and roll and everybody dancing with their little lights up in the church and and and the women with their little short sleazy dresses and all these things and then we said oh that must be pleasing to God they say they're Christian there is a discernment to the will of God to where we know what pleases God and what doesn't please God the word is in the bride when this age is alive the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know to discern what he once done with the word they do only his will he says amen I believe that no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord they keep still I don't care how right it looks and how real it seems I don't care how they don't know how much of an anointing it has I don't care how sincere it is there's any discernment to know the difference they have the Sith Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it it is himself in them what the word himself in them continuing his word to fulfill can you say man so that discernment is still here because the word has once again taken on the flesh in broad form he's alive he's alive do you believe he's alive he's alive and well not not because I'm up here dancing and shouting that don't mean nothing not because you come to an altar and you cry that don't mean he's alive hello he the word is showing himself in a body of Believers today that's why we just don't accept anything as Christian he's alive in us you love him see why ain't the elect going to be deceived well Brian said here's the secret the word is in the bride the word is in the bride he's alive and well in her in you amen listen the reason the elected won't be deceived you know why he says is because they are the word flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him Church what an introduction all I know is I'm glad to be part of it he says they can't be nothing else they can't hear nothing else they don't know nothing else why they are the word they are his body can you say Amen no other knowledge can come to them because their knowledge has come by experience you love him isn't he wonderful yet the musicians will come we find second Timothy 3 and 8 says now as Jammers Janice and Chambers withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but what was janison Chambers impersonators but the prophet said Moses wasn't carried away with all their impersonations for Moses was the word for that day and because the word was given to him for that day amen so this word bride ain't carried away with impersonators she can discern between real and fake she can discern between Good and Evil ain't that right now notice this discernment First Corinthians 4 and 4 for I know nothing by myself yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judges me is the Lord therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come now do you realize that all the church ages Satan was able to ride and never be discerned for what he really was [Music] cover form of a church [Music] that it would be in this day when the Lord shall come who both will bring Delight the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the heart then shall every man have Praise of God Say Amen what's happened Christ has come not in the way that the church thinks he should but he is here [Music] and he's shown forth the Messiah sign the sign of his resurrection and you say Amen now we're not looking [Music] at things blindly but now we can see Satan because Satan has been exposed in every every way every trick everything because brother Brown said the only way to overcome is to know him and every one of his tricks Satan has been exposed can you say man at this coming and I'll tell you Satan hates it Satan seeks to destroy and he's doing everything he can to destroy brother Brown said if he he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand that Spirit Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely forwarded today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our heart the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will everybody say we will prevail over them can you say Amen you love him I could go on and on and I'll close God bless you is our prayer I'm so glad to know he's alive [Music] he's living he's living hallelujah amen Jesus is Alive and well oh can you sing it now and well living in me to take the world that he is [Music] today and forever and well the whole singing now and well living in me to tell the world that he is the same [Music] day today and forever Jesus is Alive and well I'm gonna sing it again he's alive [Music] and well living in me to tell the Lord he's the same yesterday today Jesus is Alive [Music] as they just play softly you know thinking of all this what we're saying today [Music] brother Bram talks about them Chinese laundromen that first came to America and they couldn't start the business of about doing laundry for people [Music] but they didn't know how to speak their language American so when a person come to give their laundry how would they communicate where the person says hey I couldn't get my laundry how are they going to get it back [Music] so they came up with a way to take a piece of paper and they would rip it and however that paper was you know it could have ripped you know all kinds of ways but they put them pieces to see so then the Chinese laundromen he would keep one piece and his customer would keep another piece it's all the customer you know he'd go and the laundromen do his thing and customers come back in a couple days to claim what was rightfully his but he couldn't claim it if the pieces didn't match he had to come with the same thing that the Chinese man had [Music] and when they came they would match them papers together and that Chinese laundroman would know yours well you see Jesus is coming for his own first he had give us his spirit the bride the church had to come up into a fullness and stature of Jesus Christ to where all the powers that Jesus had is now in the church all the authority that Jesus had is now in the church it has to be in the church for that's the only thing that Jesus will come for is going to come for a people that is unlike him that has the same attributes The Same Spirit the same power the same word the same Authority she must be like him [Music] say well I go to church I've been religious that don't mean anything unless we know him in the power of his resurrection that's the only ones he's coming for that's the jewels that he's coming to claim so Church let's be ready let's make sure that everything and it's not like him get it out May Our Lives conform to the word not only just by by rules that ain't gonna get it but by knowing him in the power of his resurrection can we stand to our feet he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus yeah alive and well if you believe it sing it with me now it's a lie well living in me to tell the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Jesus is Alive and Well let's sing this song in closing he set me free how many's been set free oh once like a bird in prison I
