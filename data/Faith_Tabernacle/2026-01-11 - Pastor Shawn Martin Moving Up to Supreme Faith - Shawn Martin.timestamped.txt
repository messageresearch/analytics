[34:26] The voice of God speaking to my soul.
[34:33] [Music]
[34:35] But in my quiet time alone, when I
[34:40] approach his holy throne, his tender
[34:45] words fall gently on my ear.
[34:51] He still speaks.

[35:38] rejoice.
[35:40] He still speaks.
[35:45] I know his voice.
[35:51] [Music]
[35:55] There are so many who still doubt that
[36:00] God can speak today.
[36:03] They laugh and mock when we say we've
[36:06] heard from God.
[36:08] [Music]
[36:11] Yet the still small voice of God is
[36:14] heard above the doubters of this world.
[36:19] His timeless words ring out with hope
[36:23] today.
[36:27] He still speaks.

[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. and um
[46:10] appreciate the musicians and
[46:16] &gt;&gt; their dedication
[46:18] to um to the church to the Lord. Amen.
[46:23] To play for him. Amen. And we're
[46:27] certainly blessed by it. Amen.
[46:30] If you'd like to turn the book of
[46:32] Revelations, the 18th chapter
[46:37] and um
[46:43] before we go into the word, may we just
[46:46] uh bow our heads and and talk to the
[46:49] Lord, ask for his help. Father, we uh
[46:53] just come to you today
[46:56] in need of you,
[46:58] Lord, today more than we ever have
[47:01] before. As we see the times that we're
[47:04] living in and that our hearts are
[47:08] yearning, Lord, just for more of you to
[47:12] to have a greater revelation of you,
[47:15] Father, and a greater fellowship with
[47:19] you. And Father, I just pray that it
[47:22] would uh happen today that Lord that we
[47:27] would just be lifted up into higher
[47:30] places. And
[47:32] Father, with you and we just ask that
[47:35] your anointing will be here today as we
[47:38] endeavor to minister your word. I pray
[47:42] that you'd help me to get myself out of
[47:44] the way. And Father, bless your people
[47:46] today. And maybe those that are
[47:49] listening online, may may you go into
[47:51] their homes as well. And may they feel
[47:54] your presence, Father, and whatever the
[47:57] need would be here in the assembly this
[48:00] morning or out in the home, we pray,
[48:04] Father, that you would meet the need. We
[48:06] ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[48:10] Amen. And amen.
[48:12] So we want to look at the 18th chapter
[48:16] and um
[48:20] uh going to read the first four verses
[48:25] says and after these things I saw
[48:27] another angel come down from heaven
[48:30] having great power and the earth was
[48:33] lightened with his glory
[48:37] and he cried mightily with a strong
[48:39] voice saying Babylon the great is fallen
[48:42] En is fallen
[48:44] and has become the habitation of devils
[48:47] and the hold of every foul clean or out
[48:50] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[48:54] unclean and hateful bird. For all
[48:57] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[49:00] wrath of her fornication, and the kings
[49:01] of the earth have committed fornication
[49:04] with her. The emergence of the earth are
[49:07] waxed rich through her, the abundance of
[49:10] her delicacies.
[49:12] And I heard another voice from heaven
[49:14] saying, "Come out of her, my people,
[49:17] that you be not partakers of her sins,
[49:20] and that ye receive not of her plagues."
[49:24] Amen. So, you can have your seats this
[49:27] morning.
[49:29] And um
[49:31] uh if if I have a title, it would be
[49:34] moving up to a supreme faith.
[49:37] And um
[49:39] I'd like to read a quote that stood out
[49:42] to me uh the other day. And brother Bram
[49:46] talks about this uh faith. Um
[49:50] he said the one thing that we have to
[49:53] move up to now is a supreme faith to
[49:58] what we have had.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; So I say that again. The one thing that
[50:03] we have have to move up to now is a
[50:07] supreme faith to what we had.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot have that faith until you
[50:14] know perfectly what you're doing. Right?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "When you understand like you
[50:21] walk and you just say,"Well, I'm going
[50:24] home. I'm going out and start the car."
[50:28] How many's ever said that, you know, um
[50:31] you know, I'm I'm going to uh see you at
[50:34] work tomorrow. you know, we got church,
[50:36] so we make ready, you know, uh my wife
[50:40] irons the clothes and things on Saturday
[50:43] night cuz we're going to church Sunday
[50:46] morning, you know, and and so it says,
[50:50] see, it's it's all an act of faith.
[50:53] Tomorrow, I'll meet you at a certain
[50:55] place. That's all an act of faith
[50:57] because you've just done it so much
[51:02] &gt;&gt; because it's a regular routine with you.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's the way the
[51:09] things of God are after you have trusted
[51:12] him and watched him do so many things
[51:16] &gt;&gt; till it just becomes like a regular
[51:20] routine."
[51:21] And that's the condition I think the
[51:25] church will be in just before the coming
[51:28] of the Lord.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Nothing's going, In other words, it
[51:32] ain't going to be caught off guard.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be a surprise. I'm not
[51:37] surprised I came to church today.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; It's Sunday. We always go to church on
[51:41] Sunday. I wasn't surprised that, you
[51:43] know, the the the the family got up and
[51:46] started getting ready for church. not
[51:48] surprised that uh uh we all just got in
[51:52] in the vehicle at a at the certain time
[51:55] and we all come. It it's it's a thing to
[51:58] I'd be surprised if they didn't, you
[52:00] know, I and and and I know my family and
[52:03] you all would be surprised if I didn't
[52:04] show up, right? And where where's
[52:07] where's the pastor at? He's home. You
[52:09] know, he didn't want to get up this
[52:11] morning and I really didn't. But uh I'm
[52:14] here.
[52:15] Uh, and I woke up at 4 this morning. So,
[52:19] uh, uh, it's just one of those long
[52:21] days, you know. But, uh, uh, but it's a
[52:24] regular routine.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And so, so, Brother Brandham is saying
[52:28] that's the way the things of God are
[52:32] after you've trusted him and watched him
[52:36] do so many things till it becomes just a
[52:40] regular routine. That's the condition I
[52:44] think the church will be in just before
[52:46] the coming of the Lord. Listen. So, the
[52:49] rapture will just go right on that way.
[52:53] It'll be just a regular routine of
[52:56] following scriptures and the plans of
[52:59] God.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; I think that's powerful. So, the rapture
[53:04] isn't going to be a surprise to us.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be just some like,
[53:08] "Wow, I made it." No, it's just another
[53:11] event.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; It's just another prophecy that I'm
[53:14] fulfilling.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; We're fulfilling prophecies all the
[53:18] time.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; We're living with the word all the time,
[53:21] right? So, it's it's just a routine.
[53:23] See, it would be it would be odd uh uh
[53:28] to to Well, it would be a shock to see
[53:31] you sisters out cutting your hair. But,
[53:33] see, it's a routine that you just keep
[53:36] yourself clean. It'd be a shock if if if
[53:40] uh one of you brothers out uh sleeping
[53:42] with another woman, it it would just be
[53:44] a surprise because the routine at we're
[53:47] we're following the word of God. Now, if
[53:50] you was a sinner and you went and done
[53:52] all that stuff, that's one thing. But
[53:54] we're in a routine of things. We're in a
[53:57] routine of serving God. It's a routine
[54:00] of worshiping. It's a routine. Can you
[54:03] say amen? You see, it ain't going to be
[54:05] a surprise on that day when we all get
[54:07] around the throne and we're all
[54:08] worshiping because that's just part of
[54:10] the routine that we're doing here on
[54:13] this earth.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So to me, this statement is is profound.
[54:20] Uh because that's how he says the
[54:22] rapture is going to happen. It ain't
[54:26] going to be a surprise not to the not to
[54:29] the church, not to the bride, but to the
[54:31] world. It'll be a total surprise because
[54:34] they're not in the routine of following
[54:36] the promises of God, the word of God,
[54:39] THE THE PLAN OF GOD. Ain't that right?
[54:42] So, so now again, he says this, it isn't
[54:45] going to be a surprise the rapture to
[54:48] those who are who are in a routine of
[54:51] following the scriptures and the plans
[54:54] of God. Now, we we can only do this by
[55:00] the prophet's message.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; I think that is that's the the powerful
[55:04] the beauty of having a prophet in this
[55:07] age more than just a prophet. Amen. This
[55:11] was a word prophet restoring the word to
[55:15] us. Can you say amen? Amen. See, uh uh
[55:20] the word of the Lord only comes to a
[55:22] prophet. Ain't that right? And the
[55:24] prophet says, "We do have today by God's
[55:28] help the perfect interpretation."
[55:31] Everybody say, "The perfect
[55:32] interpretation
[55:34] of the word with divine vindication." So
[55:38] I I say this, this message is the
[55:42] perfect interpretation
[55:44] of God's word. It's been divinely
[55:47] vindicated. Amen. So we're not looking
[55:51] for a perfect interpretation. I say to
[55:54] you, no other man, no other ministry has
[55:56] the perfect interpretation
[55:58] outside this message of the hour. Amen.
[56:02] See, now every true believer in this
[56:06] age, Amen, has the ability and is now
[56:11] moving up to a supreme faith to what we
[56:16] have had. Say that again. Every true
[56:19] believer in this age has the ability.
[56:23] Hasn't been in the other ages, but it is
[56:26] today. We have the ability. And I
[56:30] believe we are moving up to that supreme
[56:33] faith than than what we've had. Ain't
[56:36] that right? Now notice, brother Brandham
[56:40] says, "You cannot have that faith until
[56:44] you know perfectly
[56:47] what you are doing."
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Not stumbling in the dark.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Not wondering about it, not guessing at
[56:55] it, presuming. Can you say amen? Uh uh
[57:00] no question in your mind. You know
[57:03] perfectly what you are doing. Amen.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[57:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning this message.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning why I'm here.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning all the things that
[57:16] that that we're believing. Well, we're
[57:18] just not questioning. We know exactly
[57:20] what we're doing.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I trust that's the way
[57:24] you are. Amen. You trust that you
[57:27] sisters aren't Well, I don't know why
[57:28] I've got to have long hair. I wished I
[57:30] could cut it. I just wish this. I don't
[57:32] know why I've got I can't wear makeup.
[57:34] And I I you young people I I just don't
[57:36] know why we just can't go out there and
[57:38] just have fun and and and all these
[57:40] things. You know exactly you know
[57:43] perfectly what you're doing. You know
[57:45] that that that the that in the world
[57:48] there's trouble.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; The world is death.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; But there is a RAPTURE THAT'S ABOUT TO
[57:55] TAKE PLACE. Can you say amen?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so so we've heard the voice.
[58:01] I I uh uh thinking of that. Come out of
[58:04] her, my people, saith the Lord. Ain't
[58:07] that right? Amen. Come out of her. Amen.
[58:10] Babylon is fallen. Amen. I and and and I
[58:14] I'll be honest, Babylon has had a hold
[58:18] all the way down through the ages. It's
[58:20] uh uh uh it started and we know you you
[58:24] listen to the church ages and the seals
[58:26] and and and the uh uh uh you know how
[58:30] much of a strangle hold that Babylon has
[58:34] had upon the people and the world and
[58:37] all of that. But there was a mighty
[58:39] angel that come. There was a message
[58:42] that came. Can you say amen? And has
[58:46] declared that Babylon has fallen. A
[58:49] ain't that right? SO SO COME OUT OF HER,
[58:52] MY PEOPLE. Her power has been broken
[58:56] over the the bride of JESUS CHRIST. FOR
[58:59] GOD had determined to call a people out
[59:02] in this age of the Gentiles for his
[59:05] name.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now, so the message has
[59:12] called us out of her for a rapture.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Because we must know
[59:20] perfectly what we are doing.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must know perfectly. Now, we
[59:29] know that Babylon is is uh the Bible
[59:32] calls a woman. Uh uh so it's a church.
[59:36] church uh woman represents church in the
[59:38] Bible. And so it is a woman that we are
[59:42] uh called out of. Come out of her, my
[59:45] people. Ain't that right? And and in
[59:48] Revelation 17:5,
[59:51] uh this woman is called mystery Babylon.
[59:55] Amen. Mystery. A mystery is something
[59:59] not understood
[1:00:01] beyond understanding. a religious truth
[1:00:04] that no one can know only by revelation
[1:00:09] and cannot fully understand. Can you say
[1:00:12] amen? That's that's from Webster. A
[1:00:16] mystery is something that uh is not
[1:00:19] understood and and beyond understanding
[1:00:23] a religious truth that no one can know
[1:00:25] only by revelation and cannot fully
[1:00:27] understand. So this revelation, you
[1:00:30] might know uh uh God may give you a
[1:00:32] revelation about a scripture or about
[1:00:34] something and yet that can still keep on
[1:00:37] unfolding and unfolding and unfolding. A
[1:00:40] ain't that right? In other words, you'll
[1:00:42] never arrive, Amen. to where you just
[1:00:45] know everything. Amen. As long as you
[1:00:48] keep walking with God, it'll just
[1:00:50] constantly be unfolding to you and
[1:00:52] unfolding. You can listen to uh uh uh
[1:00:56] you know invisible union of the bride a
[1:00:58] thousand times and it'll still uh be
[1:01:00] unfolding and unfolding. Uh uh the
[1:01:04] message of the hour is just constantly a
[1:01:06] revelation unfolding. Ain't that right?
[1:01:10] But here is this mystery Babylon. It's
[1:01:12] not just Babylon. Amen. If if it was
[1:01:15] just Bablin, maybe uh uh the historians
[1:01:18] could understand it and and and and the
[1:01:21] archaeologist and they could dig up
[1:01:23] things and and piece everything
[1:01:25] together. But this is mystery Babylon.
[1:01:28] Amen. It cannot be understood except it
[1:01:32] be revealed to us. Ain't that right? And
[1:01:36] and this church called mystery Babylon.
[1:01:39] And we know Babylon represents
[1:01:41] confusion. that that's what it is. So So
[1:01:45] when we were called out of of of
[1:01:48] Babylon, we were called out of confusion
[1:01:52] that we might know perfectly
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; perfectly what we're doing. Ain't that
[1:01:57] right? Amen. Sad to say, a lot of people
[1:02:00] going to church and they don't know what
[1:02:01] they're going for. Amen. They're they're
[1:02:04] claiming Christianity and have no idea
[1:02:06] the God that they're serving and have no
[1:02:08] idea what the Bible is really about. and
[1:02:11] and and and these things. See, man. But
[1:02:15] uh so this woman church, this mystery
[1:02:18] Babylon, she's a and she's a
[1:02:20] mother of harlots, a mother of churches
[1:02:24] and and and so that that whole system,
[1:02:28] religious system is is is is of whoredom
[1:02:33] and and abomination. And she's the
[1:02:35] mother of harlots uh uh of all
[1:02:38] denominations and abominations of the
[1:02:41] earth. Ain't that right? The
[1:02:43] abominations of the earth come from her.
[1:02:45] Amen. And and we know it's the Catholic
[1:02:48] Church and and and the harlots are the
[1:02:51] denominations and and all of these
[1:02:54] things. But she is also, the Bible says,
[1:02:56] we read it, the habitation of devils and
[1:02:59] the hold of every foul spirit and a cage
[1:03:03] of every unclean and hateful bird. Ain't
[1:03:05] that right? So, so in her is confusion.
[1:03:09] In this is confusion. Amen. And and
[1:03:14] confusion comes from her, out of her.
[1:03:17] Amen. And so confusion is caused by a
[1:03:20] mixture of things. things being mixed
[1:03:23] up. It's nothing pure. It's nothing uh
[1:03:27] one thing. It's it's it's it's all mixed
[1:03:30] up in a confusion. Ain't that right? So,
[1:03:34] she claims to be the church of Christ
[1:03:37] and yet her doctrines and traditions are
[1:03:41] antirist.
[1:03:42] Confusion. Ain't that right? Amen. You'd
[1:03:45] think someone Amen. claiming to be a
[1:03:47] Christian. Amen. They they'd be hot on
[1:03:50] fire for God all the way. See, but but
[1:03:53] this is a confusion cuz she's a church.
[1:03:56] She claims to be religious. She claims
[1:03:58] to be the the mother church and yet
[1:04:00] she's anti in everything she does.
[1:04:03] Antichrist. See? And and so she claiming
[1:04:07] to be the true church, but she's not. So
[1:04:10] this Catholic Church is an impersonator.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This mystery Babylon
[1:04:17] is a a uh uh impersonator and every
[1:04:21] denomination is an impersonation of the
[1:04:24] real church. And brother Brandham says
[1:04:27] imitation only causes confusion.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so we know
[1:04:33] that harlot and is the same thing.
[1:04:36] See, and so uh a prophet would say both
[1:04:40] mother and daughters are committing
[1:04:42] adultery, spiritual adultery, committing
[1:04:46] fornications,
[1:04:47] accepting false things because of the
[1:04:50] mind and intellectuals of men. So many
[1:04:55] doctrines that people are holding today
[1:04:57] that are not scripture-based, but they
[1:05:00] are uh influenced of mankind of way way
[1:05:05] back in in Na I guess uh uh uh Rome and
[1:05:10] they started infiltrating doctrines of
[1:05:13] men and creeds and and things. And today
[1:05:17] people are living by that. FOR THE BIBLE
[1:05:20] SAYS THE WHOLE WORLD IS DRUNK BY THE
[1:05:23] WINE of her fornications. Ain't that
[1:05:25] right? Amen. See, you've got holiness
[1:05:28] people that are uh baptizing in Father,
[1:05:31] Son, and Holy Ghost. You've got, you
[1:05:32] know, you've got uh uh just your nominal
[1:05:35] people baptizing in Father, Son, and
[1:05:37] Holy Ghost. And and and most of the
[1:05:39] world baptizes that way. AND THEY'LL
[1:05:41] FIGHT you over that. Amen. And they get
[1:05:44] mad at you when you're saying that's of
[1:05:46] the devil. Well, brother Brandham said
[1:05:48] devils travel in father, son, and holy
[1:05:50] ghost. They travel in trinity. Ain't
[1:05:53] that right? See, so the prophet says the
[1:05:56] old mother and her daughters
[1:05:59] mystery Babylon. It's all mystery
[1:06:02] Babylon. It looks pretty. It looks great
[1:06:04] on the outside. Even John said he
[1:06:07] marveled when he saw this woman sitting
[1:06:09] on a a scarlet colored beast and and
[1:06:13] things. He marveled at her. And yet she
[1:06:16] was drunk with the blood of the saints.
[1:06:18] Yet she was an evil woman. But he looked
[1:06:22] at her with admiration. Ain't that
[1:06:25] right? Amen. See, so so it's not some
[1:06:28] evil thing that you're looking at. It's
[1:06:30] it's some maybe majestic thing, some uh
[1:06:34] great grand thing and uh SEEM LIKE IT
[1:06:38] IT'S ALL PUT together and seem like
[1:06:40] pleasing unto God. And yet it's mystery
[1:06:43] Babylon. And within her is nothing but
[1:06:46] confusion.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and and so the
[1:06:52] prophet said, see the old mother uh
[1:06:54] and her daughter's mystery
[1:06:56] babbling. See, the Bible said here that
[1:06:59] that uh uh would be one of them
[1:07:02] mysteries that would be unfolded.
[1:07:04] Protestant protest pro prostitutes
[1:07:07] committing spiritual fornications
[1:07:10] leading people by denominations
[1:07:14] with their cup of iniquity of man-made
[1:07:17] doctrine. And notice what they're doing.
[1:07:20] Pulling them pulling the people away
[1:07:23] from the fountain filled with blood
[1:07:26] where the power of almighty God flows
[1:07:29] freely to manifest Jesus Christ. Can you
[1:07:33] say amen? We've got we, you know, the
[1:07:36] churches have become professionalism,
[1:07:38] professional preachers, professional
[1:07:40] singers, professional musicians,
[1:07:42] professional everything's professional.
[1:07:45] Amen. BUT CHRIST IS NOT THERE. IT'S not
[1:07:49] manifesting Christ. Formality to A TEA,
[1:07:53] BUT IT'S NOT manifesting Christ. Why?
[1:07:56] They have pulled the PEOPLE AWAY FROM
[1:07:59] THE FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD that
[1:08:02] would make way for Christ to be
[1:08:04] manifested.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; we know that God is not the author of
[1:08:11] confusion. Satan is the author of
[1:08:13] confusion.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he's the one that caused Eve
[1:08:17] to be confused in the beginning. Amen.
[1:08:20] See, and and this what the prophet said,
[1:08:23] Adam's bride believed every bit of the
[1:08:26] word all but confused on one promise.
[1:08:30] Now think of that become confused ON ONE
[1:08:33] PROMISE. HOW DID SHE GET CONFUSED? She
[1:08:35] stopped to listen to that serpent.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan incarnated. Amen. Himself in
[1:08:44] that serpent. and she become confused on
[1:08:47] one promise that he's the same
[1:08:49] yesterday, today and forever. Failed on
[1:08:52] one promise under the temptation of the
[1:08:54] enemy face to face. Can you say amen? So
[1:08:58] that spirit of confusion is still
[1:09:01] working today very very strong. Uh uh so
[1:09:05] much that Jesus said that the elect uh
[1:09:08] it would deceive the elect if it were
[1:09:10] possible. And the prophet said that
[1:09:12] we're living in the greatest age of
[1:09:14] deception. It is very great of
[1:09:17] deception. Amen. And the Bible talks
[1:09:20] about false brethren uh brought in
[1:09:22] unawares, false prophets, false Christs,
[1:09:26] which is false anointed ones, false
[1:09:29] apostles. Ain't that right? And and the
[1:09:31] prophet even says it'd be so close. See,
[1:09:34] he says now uh uh you go to a
[1:09:36] denomination Baptist or uh Presbyterian,
[1:09:39] that that ain't close. That ain't the
[1:09:42] deception. Amen. THEY THEY ARE SO far
[1:09:45] away removed from the spirit of God in
[1:09:48] in these days. EVEN EVEN PENTECOSTALS
[1:09:52] ARE SO FAR removed that their women are
[1:09:55] are wearing miniskirts and and and
[1:09:58] they've got preacher women preachers and
[1:10:00] and and all kinds OF THINGS. SO FAR
[1:10:04] REMOVED that that that's not the
[1:10:07] deceiving type. Amen. It's moved on up
[1:10:10] so close the prophet said the devil
[1:10:13] associates himself with the real thing.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. So it's no
[1:10:20] wonder we can't just look and say,
[1:10:22] "Well, I message their Pentecostal. Oo,
[1:10:25] that's deceiving." No. No. It's so close
[1:10:28] to the real thing. Brother Brandham, I I
[1:10:31] believe typed that the Pharisees and the
[1:10:33] Sadducees as the Pentecostals and and
[1:10:36] and they hated Christ and they hated
[1:10:38] that. But then here come that that one
[1:10:41] of Judas that sat among them. Amen. So
[1:10:46] much so that when Jesus says, "One of
[1:10:48] you shall betray me." They all didn't
[1:10:51] look at Judas AND SAY, "YOU LITTLE
[1:10:52] TURKEY, I KNEW IT WAS YOU." THEY all
[1:10:55] looked and said, "Yeah, is it I? Is it
[1:10:57] me?" And there was the deceiver all that
[1:11:00] time. And the only one that knew who he
[1:11:03] was WAS JESUS. FOR THE BIBLE says he
[1:11:06] knew FROM THE BEGINNING. He was the son
[1:11:09] of predition. He was the son of the
[1:11:12] devil. Can you say amen? And yet he
[1:11:14] worked miracles. He he he uh UH SLEPT
[1:11:18] WITH THEM, ATE with them, PARTTOOK OF
[1:11:21] THE THINGS WITH THEM, WENT OUT AMONG uh
[1:11:24] wi with THOSE THAT JESUS SENT OUT to do
[1:11:27] works and all that. And yet all along he
[1:11:30] was of the devil. Can you say amen?
[1:11:33] Amen. See? Amen. So, so we find that
[1:11:37] there is that deceiving type. Amen. And
[1:11:40] and and I'm going to just be honest. I
[1:11:42] they're part of mystery Babylon.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Not Not everyone that comes into this
[1:11:48] message has come out of Babylon.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It's just the truth.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For only the bride has
[1:11:58] come out of Babylon.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; See, and so we got false prophets and
[1:12:06] false teachers out in the world today
[1:12:08] and and brethren coming in unawares.
[1:12:11] Amen. Uh uh as as deceivers and and and
[1:12:15] and Paul would talk about it all and and
[1:12:18] talking about, you know, coming in in
[1:12:20] sheep wolves, coming in sheep's clothing
[1:12:23] and AND ALL THAT'S a mystery Babylon.
[1:12:26] See, and they're teaching for doctrine
[1:12:28] the commandments of men. Ain't that
[1:12:31] right?
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrine the commandments
[1:12:35] of men, NOT STAYING WITH WHAT A PROPHET
[1:12:38] TAUGHT.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. and they make the word of
[1:12:42] God of no effect to the people. So,
[1:12:45] brother Ram said, "So many prophets
[1:12:46] today telling so many different things
[1:12:49] and it's getting it gets the people
[1:12:52] confused."
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Well, see, this is
[1:12:56] what causes people not to know where
[1:12:58] they stand is the confusion.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; When we come into the message, we, you
[1:13:05] know, I realize right quick there's a
[1:13:07] lot of confusion. Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Lot of confusion. You got men taking and
[1:13:13] preaching Peruia doctrine.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; They'll take the thing that's right and
[1:13:18] then they'll make it a total mess
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; to where if you would stand up and
[1:13:22] preach perusia today, people would get
[1:13:25] THEIR HACKLES UP SAY YOU'RE OFF THE
[1:13:27] DOCTRINE. You're off. But if you'll
[1:13:28] teach it right, it's right there.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT TO PREACH BRIDEAGE. THEY
[1:13:34] DON'T WANT TO PREACH UH uh you know
[1:13:35] THESE THINGS. AND YOU KNOW, YOU GOT SOME
[1:13:37] THAT IF YOU EVER MENTION bride age and
[1:13:39] all, oh, you're part of this one and
[1:13:41] you're part of that one. SEE, SO IT'S
[1:13:43] GOT TO THE PLACE THAT IF YOU EVEN READ
[1:13:45] QUOTES OUT ON THE FIELD, YOU HAVE TO
[1:13:47] DEFEND IT.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE SHEBANG
[1:13:51] OF EXPLAINING THAT YOU'RE NOT PART OF
[1:13:53] THAT.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST SAYING WHAT A PROPHET SAID.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TEACHING IT THE WAY A PROPHET
[1:14:00] TAUGHT IT. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE GOES OFF
[1:14:03] THE off the wall awall, you know, uh on
[1:14:06] on bride age and and bride time and and
[1:14:10] all of that, that doesn't mean that we
[1:14:11] CAN'T PREACH IT.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; WE WOULDN'T even know ABOUT A BRIDE AGE
[1:14:15] IF A PROPHET HADN'T TAUGHT IT.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; But see, now notice this is what causes
[1:14:26] people not to know where to stand. Now
[1:14:29] listen, you know, uh uh and I I'm not
[1:14:32] I'm not meaning about any certain
[1:14:34] people. I'm just saying it's getting out
[1:14:36] there so much that even our young people
[1:14:39] are becoming fewu confused on things
[1:14:42] whether whether it is right to speak in
[1:14:44] tongues and and you know, right to do
[1:14:47] this and right to do that and and and
[1:14:50] and they just don't know where to stand.
[1:14:53] Amen. But listen, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
[1:14:55] perfectly what you're doing if you're
[1:14:57] going to make it in A RAPTURE.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; WE AIN'T GOT TIME TO TO BE DISSECTING
[1:15:04] EVERYTHING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[1:15:05] WHAT'S TRUE. GOD SENT US A message
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; and it's vindicated
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; now. Brother Brandaman, speaking of the
[1:15:15] American people, he said poor the poor
[1:15:17] American people is so scrupled up in
[1:15:20] their mind,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; they don't know what to believe. One
[1:15:23] says this, one says that, one says this.
[1:15:27] See, isn't that the truth? Well, the
[1:15:29] poor people. He said, 'N no wonder I'm
[1:15:32] going to preach in a few nights on
[1:15:33] something like that when I get my
[1:15:35] opportunity to use the preaching service
[1:15:37] or maybe Sunday afternoon or on on these
[1:15:40] things. And the American people is the
[1:15:43] worst confused people I know of in the
[1:15:46] world, religiously speaking. Can you say
[1:15:49] amen? I wonder why that is. I wonder why
[1:15:53] that that that the people by the time
[1:15:55] the message got here that people were so
[1:15:59] messed up in their minds, so confused at
[1:16:02] what is the truth. It it I just believe
[1:16:05] it had to been the devil know that the
[1:16:07] message would be coming out of America.
[1:16:10] Amen. And he was doing everything he
[1:16:12] can. Amen. To get the people so mentally
[1:16:16] whacked, Amen. TO WHERE THEY GET THEY
[1:16:19] DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. WELL, we
[1:16:21] don't need to be in that condition
[1:16:23] today.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE HAVE NO EXCUSE to
[1:16:27] be in that condition. I DON'T CARE WHAT
[1:16:29] THIS SAYS AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THAT
[1:16:31] SAYS.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; SO, he says now, you know, he he brother
[1:16:38] Brand talked of of of the results he get
[1:16:41] got when he went overseas
[1:16:45] uh when they saw the discernment at
[1:16:47] work. And he says, "The first thing you
[1:16:50] know, they pile up the wheelchairs,
[1:16:52] cotss, clubs, and everything else. And
[1:16:54] they've walked on happy, rejoicing,
[1:16:56] shaking hands, and hugging one another.
[1:16:58] What's the matter? Jesus Christ has
[1:17:01] manifested himself in their midst. And
[1:17:04] they believe it."
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Talking about overseas. See, they
[1:17:09] believe it. No doubt in their heart.
[1:17:11] They just believe it.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They just believe it.
[1:17:17] And how many arguments? How many PEOPLE
[1:17:20] STILL ARGUING ABOUT the message
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; today?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; So much going on. Well, it's got to be
[1:17:29] this AND GOT TO SO MUCH THAT THEY fight
[1:17:31] over the music. They fight over the
[1:17:33] songs.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; THEY THEY THEY FIGHT they just want to
[1:17:37] pick and tear and just shred everything.
[1:17:42] And and what they want to do is take the
[1:17:44] liberty away from the people to where
[1:17:46] they don't know what to do.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And it just all depends what church you
[1:17:52] go to on what you can believe and what
[1:17:54] you can't believe. I think if you go to
[1:17:56] a message church, you ought to just be
[1:17:58] able to believe what a prophet said.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; I I I I mean that that's the one we're
[1:18:05] following. If I go to a message church,
[1:18:07] if you come here or whether you go
[1:18:09] somewhere else, you ought to be able to
[1:18:10] worship. You ought to BE ABLE TO SHOUT.
[1:18:12] YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SAY AMEN TO
[1:18:14] EVERY QUOTE.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; So he says, see, he says, see, so he
[1:18:26] said, what's the matter? Jesus Christ
[1:18:28] manifested himself in their midst and
[1:18:31] they believe it. They believe it. No
[1:18:32] doubt in their heart. They just believe
[1:18:34] it. But we, speaking of Americans, we
[1:18:37] say, "Well, now let's see. Dr. So and so
[1:18:41] said that might be mental telepathy."
[1:18:45] Well, another fellow said that might be
[1:18:47] the devil. Another one says it's
[1:18:48] fanaticism. This one says it's wildfire.
[1:18:51] I don't know what to believe. That's
[1:18:54] just where the devil's got you.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Just where he has got you. Just where he
[1:19:00] wants you. See, turn loose. Everybody
[1:19:04] say, "Turn loose."
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Turn loose. Read the Bible. God's word
[1:19:09] be true. And every other man's word a
[1:19:12] lie.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; So, Americans have been taught so much
[1:19:16] theology. And he says, you know, one
[1:19:19] says, "Oh, well, it's this." The other
[1:19:21] one says it's this. And you've got that
[1:19:24] you you've got so indocated till you
[1:19:27] hardly know what to believe. So, see,
[1:19:30] he's pointing out a major problem in the
[1:19:33] church among the people. And it's the
[1:19:36] preacher's fault.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Because they're all looking for a
[1:19:43] hierarchy. They're all looking to
[1:19:44] themselves. They're all looking to be
[1:19:46] the absolute. They're all looking for
[1:19:48] the people to come unto them.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So they've all got
[1:19:53] their petty doctrines and their petty
[1:19:55] this and their petty that till when a
[1:19:58] real true MANIFESTATION OF OF CHRIST
[1:20:01] COMES IN IN in in the age. Amen. THAT'S
[1:20:05] OF THE DEVIL. THAT'S OF THE DE WHAT THEY
[1:20:08] were lo they they were fearful of losing
[1:20:10] their congregation.
[1:20:12] They were fearful amen of losing their
[1:20:15] MEAL TICKET. THEY THEY COULDN'T FOLLOW
[1:20:17] THAT. THEY COULDN'T FOLLOW THE TRUTH AND
[1:20:20] STILL LIVE IN A FINE house and have good
[1:20:22] retirement and and all of these things.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; So they began to attack it. See, so he
[1:20:32] says now he said, "You've got so
[1:20:34] documented till you hardly know what to
[1:20:36] believe." Brother, listen. And my
[1:20:38] sister, listen tonight. Jesus Christ was
[1:20:41] always truth.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? Jesus Christ
[1:20:45] is always truth. This message is Christ.
[1:20:50] That's what your prophet said. This
[1:20:52] message is Christ. So this message is
[1:20:55] the truth. And Jesus says, "I'm the way.
[1:20:58] I am the truth. I'm the life. This
[1:21:01] message is the way. This message is the
[1:21:04] truth. THIS MESSAGE IS THE LIFE."
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; So he said, "See, Jesus Christ was
[1:21:14] always truth. his manifestation, his
[1:21:16] resurrection, HIS POWER HAS ALWAYS been
[1:21:19] the same. So don't don't LET SOMEONE
[1:21:22] TALK YOU OUT OF THE POWER OF GOD TILL
[1:21:24] YOU SIT THERE SO DEAD AND YOU DON'T KNOW
[1:21:26] WHAT TO DO TO WHERE THE WORLD HAS MORE
[1:21:30] INFLUENCE on you THAN THE CHURCH has
[1:21:32] influence to that WHERE THE SPIRIT OF
[1:21:36] GOD CAN'T EVEN have influence. See, we
[1:21:40] sit so so dried up and so dead and so
[1:21:43] Amen. because we we we've we've let
[1:21:46] ourselves become confused. Brother
[1:21:49] Brandham in speaking to the Germans in
[1:21:51] Germany he says now you people one of
[1:21:54] the smartest nations in the world surely
[1:21:56] you can believe you know why our
[1:21:59] education hinders us lots of times we've
[1:22:04] been taught everything one teaches this
[1:22:06] one this it's contrary one to the other
[1:22:09] and the poor white people and the people
[1:22:11] who lives in civilization has uh uh GOT
[1:22:15] SO MIXED UP TILL they just don't know
[1:22:17] what to believe. Yeah,
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; that's what civilization does, right?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Education and all these things.
[1:22:24] Now, Amos 8 and 11, it says, "Behold,
[1:22:28] the days come, sayeth the Lord God, that
[1:22:31] I will send a famine in the land, not a
[1:22:33] famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,
[1:22:36] but of hearing the words of the Lord."
[1:22:39] Hearing, understanding the words of the
[1:22:42] Lord. And they shall wander from sea to
[1:22:44] sea and from the north even to the east.
[1:22:47] They shall run to and fro to seek the
[1:22:50] word of the Lord and shall not find it.
[1:22:52] Now we know this is prophetic of this
[1:22:54] day. How many believes that this is
[1:22:56] prophetic of this day. Amen. See,
[1:23:00] brother Brad said we don't need bread.
[1:23:02] We got plenty of it. We got plenty to
[1:23:04] eat, plenty clothes to wear, nice homes
[1:23:06] to live in and everything. But there's a
[1:23:08] famine. There is a famine for the
[1:23:10] hearing of the word of God. A man won't
[1:23:13] know what to believe.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He's in a famine.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're all confused. ONE SAYS
[1:23:21] THIS, ONE SAYS THAT, ONE SAYS THIS, ONE
[1:23:24] SAYS SOMETHING ELSE." BASE YOUR THOUGHTS
[1:23:27] ON THUS SAYETH THE LORD, AND GOD WILL
[1:23:31] CONFIRM IT. Another
[1:23:35] place he said, "We have been drugged
[1:23:37] through this and drugged through that
[1:23:39] and drugged through everything until
[1:23:42] honest the poor little people can't
[1:23:44] understand what to believe."
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; And that's sad because it's happening in
[1:23:50] the message.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You'd think every message preacher would
[1:23:57] just point you to the message and say,
[1:23:58] "Just believe the message." Right?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; But that ain't the case.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; They want to steer you away from certain
[1:24:05] quotes.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; They want to steer you away from certain
[1:24:09] years. Well, it's only 63 on that you
[1:24:13] need to really listen to. Everything
[1:24:15] else was just Brother Brandham's
[1:24:16] opinion.
[1:24:18] Where's that at?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; You know, God, that picture was taken in
[1:24:24] what? 56
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; 50
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; 50.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It's earlier than that. That was not in
[1:24:29] 63,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; in 50 to let the people know this is
[1:24:34] what I sent to you.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MESSAGE I SENT TO YOU.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; AND and it's not to be UH UH DISSECTED.
[1:24:42] I you know, and you just have to forgive
[1:24:45] me. It's just kind of a burden on my
[1:24:46] heart today. Um but you know, I remember
[1:24:50] when I first come into the message, and
[1:24:51] I I believe I've told you before, we
[1:24:53] went and heard a certain brother give
[1:24:55] his testimony. He was with brother
[1:24:57] Brandham and stuff but in in in one he
[1:25:00] made a statement about the church age
[1:25:02] book that brother Brandham told him
[1:25:05] personally now we didn't understand
[1:25:07] everything at that time but brother Bram
[1:25:09] told him personally that the church age
[1:25:11] ought to be burned
[1:25:14] and so he said well brother Bram you
[1:25:17] want me go get them and burn them no you
[1:25:20] know well what that done is it planted a
[1:25:23] seed in my mind
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; right And so I'll be honest, I had a
[1:25:28] hard time for ye for years really
[1:25:30] getting into the church age book
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; because that was always in my mind.
[1:25:34] Brother Bram said it needed to be
[1:25:35] burned. Brother Bram said it needed to
[1:25:36] be burned. So when I was actually up in
[1:25:38] Erie, Pennsylvania pastoring up there,
[1:25:41] uh brother had been in a church for
[1:25:43] years and they him and his family left
[1:25:45] and started coming here uh to our church
[1:25:48] and after a little bit he said you know
[1:25:51] he and I never told the people anything.
[1:25:53] I always promoted the book, but I'm just
[1:25:55] telling you it was always in my mind.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And and so, uh, he came to me. He said,
[1:26:01] you know, brother Johnny, he says, you
[1:26:03] know, our way we've been taught for
[1:26:05] years is that the the church age book a
[1:26:09] ain't inspired. It's Lee Vale's book.
[1:26:12] Like, well, really? So, that's that's
[1:26:13] odd, you know. So, I kind of told him my
[1:26:16] story and um I said, you know, I've
[1:26:19] always struggled with it, you know, uh
[1:26:22] not even when I'd read it, you know, it
[1:26:25] was always there in my mind, it ought to
[1:26:26] be burned. It ought to be burned. And uh
[1:26:29] so we were uh that weekend we were
[1:26:32] having Brother Wayne Lawson up to to
[1:26:35] preach and I said, "I tell you what,
[1:26:38] brother." I said, uh, you know, Brother
[1:26:40] Wayne's will be coming and, uh, let's
[1:26:43] not say a word to no one. I'm not going
[1:26:45] to say a word to anyone. And, um, we'll
[1:26:49] see what God has to say about it, you
[1:26:52] know, cuz I said, I want to be right.
[1:26:54] And he said, well, I do, too. So, I
[1:26:56] said, "All right." So, I said, "I won't
[1:26:58] mention nothing." And uh so one one of
[1:27:01] them services, Brother Wayne's up there
[1:27:03] preaching and he just just flipped, man.
[1:27:07] You know, totally out of his context of
[1:27:10] his sermon. And he said, you know, he
[1:27:13] says, "Some people say that this church
[1:27:16] age book is Lev's book or that it ought
[1:27:19] to be burned and that it ain't nothing."
[1:27:22] He says, "That is a lie of the devil."
[1:27:24] Right.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And buddy, he starts, you know, he's got
[1:27:26] a mind on him and he starts quoting
[1:27:29] quotes, you know, and right then that
[1:27:33] spirit left.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; That thing left and it did that other
[1:27:39] bro. I've never had a problem since.
[1:27:41] Never had that even in my mind that this
[1:27:44] thing ought to be burned or whatever.
[1:27:46] and and it was a spirit, but it it was a
[1:27:50] spirit by somebody putting just saying
[1:27:52] words and it put it on me. You
[1:27:55] understand what I'm saying? See, and and
[1:27:58] then I realized, no wonder brother Brown
[1:28:00] say what I say on tapes. Say what I say
[1:28:03] on tape. I don't want to hear anyone
[1:28:05] else's uh version of what brother
[1:28:07] Brandham told them. IF HE TOLD THEM
[1:28:10] SOMETHING AND IF IT'S NOT WHAT he lived
[1:28:12] and NOT WHAT HE SAID, I I ain't
[1:28:15] listening to it. You understand what I'm
[1:28:17] saying? It's got to be. Why? There's too
[1:28:19] many confusion out here. And the only
[1:28:22] way we're going to get in a RAPTURE IS
[1:28:24] MOVE UP TO SUPREME FAITH. And that's the
[1:28:27] only way we can do it is we know
[1:28:29] perfectly what we ARE DOING. WE AIN'T
[1:28:33] GOT TIME to listen to voices. WE AIN'T
[1:28:35] GOT TIME TO LISTEN TO WHAT THIS has to
[1:28:37] say and this HAS TO SAY AND THEN REASON
[1:28:40] IT ALL TOGETHER. JUST GIVE ME WHAT
[1:28:41] BROTHER BAM SAID, WHAT HE TAUGHT and let
[1:28:44] it stay there.
[1:28:46] You know, one man said, "Well, HE
[1:28:48] CONTRADICTS HIMSELF." YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:28:50] THERE THE BIBLE CONTRADICTS. If you
[1:28:52] really want to look at it, Peter uh uh
[1:28:55] the four gospels, IF YOU GO JUST READ
[1:28:57] THE FOUR GOSPELS, THEY GOT DIFFERENT
[1:28:59] ACCOUNTS on on it all.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT FOUR DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT
[1:29:03] WHAT Jesus did. And in some places, it's
[1:29:06] a totally different story. They're
[1:29:07] talking of the same story and totally
[1:29:10] two different stories.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Does that make the Bible the word of God
[1:29:14] of none effect? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THERE'S
[1:29:17] A MESSAGE THERE.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; And and and that's what I want to bring
[1:29:21] to you today IS THE MESSAGE. AMEN. You
[1:29:24] can look at brother Brand's words and
[1:29:25] he'll say this and he may say that and
[1:29:28] he may say that. But the message,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; there is a message from beginning to
[1:29:33] end. Amen. That's clicked together. It
[1:29:37] all comes together.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Even God seems to contradict himself.
[1:29:42] Thank you.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; HE TELLS ISRAEL NOT to have any image
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; and then he tells Moses to raise up an
[1:29:49] image,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; a brazen serpent.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I mean, THERE'S THERE'S ALL KINDS OF
[1:29:58] THINGS. BUT IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, THE
[1:30:00] CARNAL MIND WILL JUST MAKE IT AND SAY,
[1:30:02] "THIS IS A CONFUSING BOOK."
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT'S REVEALED, BROTHER BRAND
[1:30:08] SAID, YOU'LL SEE CHRIST IN EVERY BIT OF
[1:30:10] IT. AMEN.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It's not to be read LIKE A NEWSPAPER.
[1:30:14] IT'S NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE CARNAL
[1:30:16] MIND. AND THIS MESSAGE IS NOT TO BE CAR
[1:30:20] UH IT WASN'T A CARNAL MIND THAT CAME AND
[1:30:23] SAID COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE. IT WAS A
[1:30:26] revelated word that came to us.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Understand. That's right.
[1:30:37] You know how many people have lived in
[1:30:40] that that have well you it's manifested
[1:30:44] now there's been people that preached
[1:30:46] this message guys that preached this
[1:30:47] message for years
[1:30:50] and now walking away from it cuz they
[1:30:52] never understood in the first place.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; They tried to follow it by a carnal
[1:30:57] mind.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; You can't do that.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; How many people have walked away Amen.
[1:31:05] uh and and they totally walk away from
[1:31:07] it because of the carnal mind. They
[1:31:10] tried to look at this thing through a
[1:31:12] carnal mind, through a carnal
[1:31:13] understanding. There ain't no way you're
[1:31:15] going to look at the Bible or this
[1:31:17] message by a carnal understanding. Jesus
[1:31:19] wasn't worried about an intellectual
[1:31:21] message or he would have had an
[1:31:23] intellectual man preach. BUT HE HAD A
[1:31:25] SEVENTH GRADE educated Kuckian
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; bring this MESSAGE THAT COULDN'T GIVE
[1:31:32] ALL THE INTELLECTUAL WORDS THAT ALL
[1:31:34] THESE OTHER INTELLECTUAL PREACHERS COULD
[1:31:36] GIVE.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T ABOUT INTELLECTUAL. IT WAS
[1:31:40] ABOUT A REVELATION.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Come out of her my people. See, so a man
[1:31:48] can't come higher into that supreme
[1:31:51] faith if he doesn't know perfectly where
[1:31:54] he stands.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; I believe it was brother Brandham. I'm
[1:32:03] pretty sure I read it, but he said
[1:32:04] confusion just paralyzes faith.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; It just paralyzes faith because if
[1:32:10] you're if you're in a state of
[1:32:12] confusion,
[1:32:14] you don't know what to believe.
[1:32:16] You don't know who to believe. You don't
[1:32:18] know. You know where you're going.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Well, see, uh, the rapture is is it's
[1:32:23] going to it's going to take the greatest
[1:32:25] faith, more faith ever
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; to get in a rapture.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; more faith ever, more faith, perfect
[1:32:32] faith? He says in one place, I know one
[1:32:34] brother and I I'm I'm sure he meant
[1:32:36] well, but he's told convin, you know, a
[1:32:39] few months ago told me that brother Bram
[1:32:40] did not have perfect faith. I'm like, oh
[1:32:43] my word. Now, I never heard that one
[1:32:45] before, but I thought, my God, if he
[1:32:48] didn't have perfect faith, where do I
[1:32:49] stand?
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; But he believed this message so much.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He had that perfect faith.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He stood on this message regardless of
[1:33:01] what everybody else said.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; He believed it come from an angel. He
[1:33:05] believed THAT HE WAS HE WASN'T OUT OF
[1:33:07] HIS MIND. HE BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS THE
[1:33:10] PILLAR OF FIRE, THAT HE WASN'T JUST
[1:33:11] SEEING THINGS. He believed it. CAN YOU
[1:33:14] SAY AMEN? EVERY PROMISE HE BELIEVED IT
[1:33:17] AND HE EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE IT. GOD
[1:33:19] EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE THE
[1:33:22] WAY THE PROPHET believed this message.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; A perfect faith. Can you say amen?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Now when God sends a message messenger
[1:33:30] with a message, see he thoroughly
[1:33:33] thoroughly vindicates his man and his
[1:33:36] message.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Why would God vindicate it? Now
[1:33:40] this message has this message is the
[1:33:43] most thoroughly vindicated message.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; More vindicated than any other message
[1:33:48] that's come to this earth.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Bible never talks about how Moses Noah
[1:34:00] was vindicated.
[1:34:02] Never talks about him. You know, he
[1:34:05] didn't have sign of Messiah.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't have discernment. He it didn't
[1:34:09] tell doesn't even say him working any
[1:34:11] kind of miracles.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; But the people would perish if they
[1:34:16] didn't believe him.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; He's the one with the message.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; But in this age, it's been so thoroughly
[1:34:27] vindicated. Even science took a picture
[1:34:30] of it.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; It's been scientifically vindicated.
[1:34:35] Right.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Scripturally vindicated,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; supernaturally vindicated.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; VINDICATED IN SO MANY WAYS.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't want his people to be
[1:34:47] confused.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And notice, he's going to judge the
[1:34:53] world. God's going to judge the world by
[1:34:55] his what? His word.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet said. His word.
[1:35:01] But it'll be the word that he sent by
[1:35:02] his prophets.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; The people in Noah's day will be judged
[1:35:06] by the word of that prophet.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; The people in Moses day will be judged
[1:35:15] by the word that Moses the prophet
[1:35:17] brought.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; The people in Elijah's day will be
[1:35:21] judged by his message
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; which was the word of God sent to them.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; So anytime that God sends a prophet
[1:35:32] thoroughly vindicates them to where the
[1:35:34] people who refuse to listen to him, they
[1:35:38] perish for rejecting the prophet's
[1:35:42] message
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; and they will be judged by that message
[1:35:47] and their actions to it.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Now, God didn't just send another
[1:35:54] prophet on the scene to us in this day.
[1:35:57] H
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; he sent to us the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; scripturally
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; spoken of this day and he never promised
[1:36:08] to send another prophet after that.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; How many people wanted to be a prophet
[1:36:16] after brother Brandham?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; So many people want to be another
[1:36:20] prophet, another minister, another
[1:36:22] messenger.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; God never vindicated it and God never
[1:36:26] promised it. Can you say amen? God
[1:36:28] didn't promise to send another earthly
[1:36:30] messenger to the earth after the seventh
[1:36:33] angel messenger came with his message.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; According to the scriptures, THERE'S
[1:36:40] ONLY SEVEN EARTHLY messengers sent to
[1:36:42] THE GENTILE DISPENSATION. CAN YOU SAY
[1:36:45] AMEN?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; AND THAT SEVENTH ANGEL IS THE PROPHET OF
[1:36:50] MALACHI 4.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How many believes
[1:36:56] that?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's just now going around that
[1:36:59] brother just said and y'all know him.
[1:37:01] Brother just just said that the Holy
[1:37:04] Spirit led him and told him that that
[1:37:06] that brother Brandham is not the seventh
[1:37:09] angel messenger.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, uh someone someone asked
[1:37:15] brother Brandham this question. Is the
[1:37:17] seventh angel as spoken of of
[1:37:19] Revelations 10 the same person as Elijah
[1:37:22] of Malachi 4? Now there they
[1:37:24] specifically ask him this question. He
[1:37:27] says yes it's the same person.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 is the se angel's message
[1:37:34] uh which the seventh angel messenger of
[1:37:37] the seventh an uh ch seventh church age
[1:37:40] is Malachi 4.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; So when a man is telling you that
[1:37:46] brother Brandham is not the seventh
[1:37:47] angel, he's also telling you brother
[1:37:50] Brandham is not the prophet of Malachi
[1:37:52] 4.
[1:37:54] NOW, YOU GOT TO COME OUT OF THE
[1:37:56] CONFUSION.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I guarantee you your p,"
[1:38:02] you know, he's talking to visitors in
[1:38:03] his church. He says, "I guarantee you
[1:38:05] your pastor would never teach you this."
[1:38:07] He said, "But if you understand what I'm
[1:38:09] telling you, it's the Holy Ghost that
[1:38:11] have led you this or spoke this to you.
[1:38:13] I'd say it's a spirit of confusion."
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know, we wouldn't even
[1:38:22] know what the seventh angel was outside
[1:38:24] this message.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; It's the message, brother Brandham's
[1:38:28] message telling us who he was.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He he, you know, and that's what his
[1:38:34] critics criticized him of. Oh, they they
[1:38:36] loved his ministry. They they said he
[1:38:38] was anointed. He was meek. He was all
[1:38:40] humble and all these things. Nothing no
[1:38:42] ministry like him. But he kind of just
[1:38:45] felt like he was that Malachi 4 prophet.
[1:38:48] Well, of course he did. You know who
[1:38:51] told him? An angel.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; And with perfect faith, HE WOULD TELL
[1:38:56] THE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT THIS IS
[1:39:00] MALACHI 4.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; When they asked him that question, he
[1:39:10] didn't have to say, "Well, I don't know.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I I'll give you, you
[1:39:14] know, I I don't know."
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; No. He had perfect faith.
[1:39:18] because an angel put them scriptures
[1:39:20] together for him.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; The angel of God put Revelations 10 and
[1:39:26] Malachi 4 and connected it for him.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a carnal mind putting
[1:39:32] scriptures together.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Hope this all right.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Bram said, "The seventh
[1:39:42] angel is a man."
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And he is to bring a message from God.
[1:39:48] And his message and ministry is going to
[1:39:51] finish the mystery of God as declared to
[1:39:54] his servant, the prophets. God is going
[1:39:56] to treat this last messenger as a
[1:39:59] prophet because he is a prophet.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:08] You know, brother Brandham goes to show
[1:40:11] us and he he goes to Jezebel.
[1:40:15] Now, Jezebel, who prophesied uh uh
[1:40:19] Jezebel's doom? Elijah.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; And he says, Elijah said, "In the
[1:40:26] portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat
[1:40:29] Jezebel, the prophet Elijah did, the
[1:40:32] first Elijah." And that's exactly what
[1:40:35] happened when Elijah went off the scene.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; You can read about it in 2 Kings 9,
[1:40:42] chapter 9, and talks talks about it. And
[1:40:47] and so uh
[1:40:50] there in the 35th verses, and and they
[1:40:52] went to bury her, but they found no more
[1:40:55] of her than the skull, the feet, and the
[1:40:57] palms of her hands.
[1:41:00] Wherefore they came again and told him,
[1:41:02] and he said, "This is the word of the
[1:41:04] Lord, which he spake by his servant
[1:41:06] Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the
[1:41:07] portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat
[1:41:10] the flesh of Jezebel,
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as
[1:41:14] dung upon the face of the field in the
[1:41:17] portion of Jezrael, so that they shall
[1:41:19] not say, "This is Jezebel."
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; So then you go in Revelations 2 and 20.
[1:41:28] God likens the harlot church system, the
[1:41:32] her harlots, uh, uh, her
[1:41:35] daughters, all that to that of Jezebel.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And, and the same
[1:41:41] time, you can read about it. Revelations
[1:41:42] 2:18 through 23
[1:41:46] there. See, and and so this Jezebel
[1:41:49] spirit now is in the church. Same same
[1:41:52] thing. It was it was in the natural
[1:41:55] Jezebel in the days of Elijah the
[1:41:57] Tishbite. But now this Jezebel spirit is
[1:42:01] in the church in a spiritual form. Yeah.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And Revelations 19:17, notice, "And I
[1:42:08] saw uh an angel standing in the sun, and
[1:42:11] he cried with a loud voice, saying to
[1:42:13] all the fowls that fly in the midst of
[1:42:16] heaven, come and gather yourselves
[1:42:17] together unto the supper of the great
[1:42:20] God, that you may eat the flesh of
[1:42:23] kings, and the flesh of captains, and
[1:42:25] the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of
[1:42:27] horses, and of them that sit on them,
[1:42:30] and the flesh of all men, both free and
[1:42:32] bond, both small and great. I saw the
[1:42:35] beast and the kings of the earth and
[1:42:37] their armies gathered together to make
[1:42:39] war against him that sat on the horse
[1:42:41] and against his army. And the beast was
[1:42:44] taken and with him the false prophet and
[1:42:47] wrought miracles before or that wrought
[1:42:49] miracles before him with which he
[1:42:52] deceived them that had the mark received
[1:42:55] the mark of the beast and them that
[1:42:57] worshiped the image his image. These
[1:43:00] both were cast alive into a lake of fire
[1:43:02] burning with brimstone. And the remnant
[1:43:05] were slain with the sword of him that
[1:43:07] sat upon the horse, which sword
[1:43:10] proceeded out of his mouth, and all the
[1:43:13] fowls were filled with their flesh.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; In other words, devoured them.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; See? So, so now Brother Brian's saying
[1:43:21] this is exactly the same Jezebel spirit
[1:43:26] upon these people. It's that that's
[1:43:29] going to be the end of them just like it
[1:43:31] was the that that that first Jezebel.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; For he says to those who do not believe
[1:43:36] that this last messenger to the church
[1:43:38] age is Elijah the prophet, a man
[1:43:40] anointed in that line. Watch after death
[1:43:44] of this last church age. You notice what
[1:43:47] happens after death their dead bodies
[1:43:50] are destroyed by wild beasts. You know
[1:43:53] that that's true. like theirs had the
[1:43:56] type of Jezebel. He feeds them to the
[1:44:00] beast and birds. He said watch over here
[1:44:02] see of uh in in book of revelations kill
[1:44:06] with the sword and death and beast of
[1:44:08] the earth. The Jezebel church her
[1:44:11] actually body is to be eaten by fowls
[1:44:15] and beasts of the earth. Just exactly
[1:44:17] like Ahab and Jezebel was in the
[1:44:20] natural. So are they to be in the
[1:44:22] spiritual form of a church.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and it comes
[1:44:28] after the last messenger, which is
[1:44:31] Elijah the prophet.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; See, and so, Brother Brandon would tell
[1:44:40] us this last messenger, the seventh
[1:44:42] angel, uh, the prophet of Malachi 4 is
[1:44:46] the messenger of truth. Everybody say
[1:44:49] the messenger of truth.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; To the elect
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and wordbornne brideorn
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; may not be the MESSENGER OF TRUTH TO THE
[1:44:59] WORLD but it IS THE MESSENGER OF TRUTH
[1:45:02] TO THE elect and the wordborn bride.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; No other man will or has ever had a
[1:45:11] ministry like brother Brandhams.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; And he'll never be vindicated like
[1:45:17] brother Brandhams.
[1:45:18] Can you say amen?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Now notice, and I won't keep you too
[1:45:22] much longer, but those who are going in
[1:45:25] the rapture, the us we're going in a
[1:45:28] rapture are getting in the routine.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Of following the scriptures and the
[1:45:35] plans of God.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; We've come out of confusion.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Babylon no longer has a hold on us.
[1:45:45] That's right.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE'RE FOLLOWING IN step routine
[1:45:55] following the scriptures and the plans
[1:45:58] of God.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; It reminds me of of what Elijah told his
[1:46:04] servant there in 2 Kings 4:29.
[1:46:08] He said, "Go gird up thy loins and take
[1:46:11] my staff in thy hand and go thy way."
[1:46:13] talking about, you know, when that woman
[1:46:14] came up and had that dead son.
[1:46:17] If thou meet any man, salute him not. If
[1:46:21] any man salute thee, answer him not
[1:46:23] again and lay my staff on the face of
[1:46:26] that child. Now, Brother Brandham, in
[1:46:29] several different in places, he's he's
[1:46:32] reading after reading this scripture or
[1:46:34] talking about it, he said, "That's the
[1:46:35] trouble with the church today with this
[1:46:37] message. They're stopping, chatting
[1:46:40] along the road, little gatherings,
[1:46:43] social parties, card parties, picnics,
[1:46:46] want to, you know,
[1:46:49] what? Just want to love everybody.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Sewing circles, just just rub shoulders
[1:46:56] with everybody. I mean, after all,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; go ahead.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; God is love and we must be the people of
[1:47:02] love.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; What about standing against the
[1:47:04] persecution?
[1:47:07] Yeah.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; What about standing for what's right
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; and not being a jellyfish
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; or not being one of those uh uh ch one
[1:47:15] of those things that you get it on the
[1:47:17] grass, it turns green. You get it on a
[1:47:19] rock, it turns the color of the rock,
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; a chameleon.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; We're not to be chameleons.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; We're to run the race.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, he says, "Too
[1:47:32] much of the world has entered in." He
[1:47:35] said, 'We haven't got no time to fool
[1:47:36] around. The message is urgent. PEOPLE
[1:47:39] ARE DYING.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; LET'S GO FORWARD.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Another place it says, if anybody
[1:47:47] speaks, you don't even speak to them. If
[1:47:49] the devil says, "Hey, you know what
[1:47:51] you're feeling?" DON'T EVEN SPEAK to
[1:47:53] him. Just keep going. The devil, you
[1:47:55] know, the devil says, "Well, but you
[1:47:57] know what? You know, so and so when they
[1:47:59] got the Holy Ghost, you remember they
[1:48:01] almost LOST THEIR MIND. DON'T EVEN SPEAK
[1:48:03] TO HIM.
[1:48:04] Don't that devil, RIGHT? JUST KEEP
[1:48:06] GOING. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO AND SO.
[1:48:09] IT'S YOU AND GOD.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; JUST keep going.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest. When I first come in the
[1:48:18] message, you know, I had I had ministers
[1:48:20] even tell me now, you don't want to get
[1:48:22] too deep
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; because, you know, everybody seems to go
[1:48:26] off the deep end when you start really
[1:48:28] studying the message. So, again, there
[1:48:30] become a fear.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; All right. like, "Oh no."
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm kind of scared. You
[1:48:37] know what, brother Brandham? And and
[1:48:38] this is all paraphrased here because I I
[1:48:40] wished I had the quote before me, but
[1:48:42] Brother Terry, you would know what I'm
[1:48:44] talking about. But you know, Brother
[1:48:46] Brandham says, "You don't have to worry
[1:48:47] about going off the deep end. If you've
[1:48:49] got a hunger to know more about God, God
[1:48:51] will show it to you."
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; I heard one brother say uh actually I
[1:48:59] was listening to his sermon this morning
[1:49:01] and it was just really good. But he he
[1:49:04] uh he said, "If you don't study this
[1:49:06] message and you don't stay in this
[1:49:08] message, you're going to be left
[1:49:09] behind."
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; And and that don't mean more of the
[1:49:14] rapture. It just means God's
[1:49:16] progressing.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; We're progressing. Amen.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; And and as we've said before and and and
[1:49:24] brother Terry, you would know more than
[1:49:26] I would. Uh you you and and you elders
[1:49:28] have been in in the mess way more than I
[1:49:30] have, longer than I have. But but you
[1:49:33] know, I heard you know that when right
[1:49:35] when brother Brandham left the scene,
[1:49:37] everybody was just happy that God sent a
[1:49:39] prophet.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; And they would just tell the stories,
[1:49:41] you know, God sent a prophet. God sent a
[1:49:43] prophet. They didn't even have a clue of
[1:49:44] what really that he taught.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That's true. And then one brother
[1:49:48] started really getting into the
[1:49:49] medicine. Then he got into the thunders
[1:49:50] and he got into all this stuff. And so
[1:49:53] so one elder brother uh Ed uh um Ed
[1:49:56] Hunter he told me he says you know he
[1:49:58] says we just we he was there and he said
[1:50:01] we just didn't really know what the
[1:50:03] message was about. He said but when they
[1:50:06] started teaching the thunders and all
[1:50:07] that we knew that just couldn't be all
[1:50:09] right. So it got us to really start
[1:50:13] searching the message for ourselves.
[1:50:15] And and now we're looking at it. We've
[1:50:18] come a long ways from what they were.
[1:50:20] And and I pray to God that my children
[1:50:23] will if God would terry that they'll
[1:50:26] come along more. BRING THIS MESSAGE on
[1:50:28] further. And it ain't going to be BY
[1:50:30] INTELLECTS. IT'S GOING TO BE BY A
[1:50:32] REVELATION OF WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; YOU don't have TO GO OFF OUT IN THE DEEP
[1:50:38] END. JUST STAY WITH THE MESSAGE. GOD
[1:50:41] WILL TAKE YOU FURTHER THAN YOU'LL EVER
[1:50:44] DREAMED. Can you say amen? I have found
[1:50:47] that, you know, there there's time, you
[1:50:49] know, I I have studied the message. I've
[1:50:51] read the books and I've read that and
[1:50:53] then I'll pick up a book or I'll turn on
[1:50:55] a tape and and I'll hear BROTHER RAM SAY
[1:50:57] SOMETHING. I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THAT
[1:51:00] BEFORE.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAPPENED? IT JUST STICKS OUT IN
[1:51:04] MY MIND.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; GOD'S TAKING ME FURTHER down the road.
[1:51:08] Right.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; See, so we're not JUST FOLLOWING A MAN.
[1:51:15] WE'RE NOT IN CONFUSION.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; We're advancing NOT BY INTELLECT. WE'RE
[1:51:20] ADVANCING BY REVELATION.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; And it's becoming a routine. You know
[1:51:27] what the Bible says? They that are led
[1:51:29] by the spirit of God are the sons of
[1:51:30] God.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Led by the spirit. Led
[1:51:34] by the spirit. Amen. When you're playing
[1:51:36] them, let God Amen. LET THE SPIRIT OF
[1:51:39] GOD START leading you. Start bringing
[1:51:41] you into greener pastures. Can you say
[1:51:43] amen? Amen. And not he can lead you to
[1:51:46] se someone to talk to someone. If you
[1:51:48] get so sensitive to God, get out of the
[1:51:51] carnal. I I've just been praying for
[1:51:53] myself. God, get me get out of my stupid
[1:51:56] carnal ways.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I want to just be so godlike, so
[1:52:00] Christlike. I want to be so close to
[1:52:02] God.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? that that when God
[1:52:05] wants me to do something, I'll be just
[1:52:06] right there to hear it
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; and I can do it.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; When he when you can't go to sleep, have
[1:52:14] you ever been there?
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I'm there a lot. You can't, you know,
[1:52:17] you wake up, you only get four hours
[1:52:19] sleep or whatever, but but you know,
[1:52:21] like the other day, I I just I I I woke
[1:52:25] up, I don't know, 3, 4 in the morning,
[1:52:30] and I really was trying to go back to
[1:52:31] sleep, but something just come on my
[1:52:33] heart and people just started coming on
[1:52:36] my heart, and I I just got out of bed
[1:52:39] and went down in the living room and
[1:52:41] just started praying for these, well,
[1:52:43] for the church here and for different
[1:52:45] ones And you know, I thought, well, God,
[1:52:48] if that's why you woke me up for, I'll
[1:52:50] be glad to stay awake.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; God God can lead us. God God can direct
[1:52:58] us.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And and God, you know, we're so close to
[1:53:01] the the coming of the Lord that that
[1:53:03] that we want to make every minute of our
[1:53:06] time count.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; We want everything that we do count for
[1:53:10] the kingdom of God. And if we'd be so
[1:53:13] sensitive to his spirit, God God could
[1:53:15] put us on the path. You know, you hear
[1:53:17] what brother Bram says, you know, when
[1:53:19] he in the message being led by the
[1:53:21] spirit, you know, talking about how that
[1:53:23] God would lead him and and he's at a
[1:53:26] restaurant, you know, and they're there
[1:53:27] at a certain time and someone comes up
[1:53:29] says, "Oh, brother Brandham, I was told
[1:53:31] God told me to come to this restaurant.
[1:53:33] I thought I was going to miss you." and
[1:53:35] and and here you are, you know, and and
[1:53:38] they're I think they're eating and
[1:53:39] brother Brandham just gets up and he
[1:53:41] just takes off and one of the ladies
[1:53:43] that was there asked me where's he going
[1:53:45] just be he knows what he's doing you
[1:53:48] know he goes out to a certain street
[1:53:50] corner and as he's there some ladies or
[1:53:53] some man brother Brandham you know so
[1:53:56] nice to meet you know says well I've got
[1:53:59] this problem I got that problem and God
[1:54:01] just told me to start walking well God
[1:54:03] what was it brother Brandham said it's
[1:54:05] people being led by the spirit and
[1:54:07] before you know it, they had a policeman
[1:54:09] out there holding back traffic because
[1:54:10] they're having a prayer line in the
[1:54:12] middle of a street because people are
[1:54:15] led by the spirit. And we ought to be
[1:54:18] led by the spirit.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING
[1:54:24] TO TAPES, LET THAT SPIRIT OF GOD LEAD
[1:54:27] YOU INTO GREATER UNDERSTANDING, GREATER
[1:54:30] REVELATION.
[1:54:33] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BECAUSE IT'S A
[1:54:35] ROUTINELY
[1:54:37] OF FOLLOWING GOD'S REVEALED WORD, GOD'S
[1:54:40] SCRIPTURES AND AND HIS PLAN.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; That's how the raptures are going to be.
[1:54:46] It's just a well Enoch walked with God
[1:54:49] till he was not for God took him.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; 500 years walking with God. Walking with
[1:54:56] God. AND THAT DAY WAS NO DIFFERENT.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; PRAISE the Lord.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Just walking with God. Yeah.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; And that's the way the rapture is going
[1:55:05] to be. Ain't going to be anything
[1:55:06] different.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to go from one carnal
[1:55:09] nutad all of a sudden spiritual and and
[1:55:12] I'm ready.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; No. Routine day following scriptures.
[1:55:17] Following the plan of God. Getting more
[1:55:20] godlike. Getting more God in your
[1:55:22] thought thinking. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:55:25] CASTING DOWN REASONINGS. CASTING DOWN
[1:55:28] THOUGHTS THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THIS
[1:55:30] WORD.
[1:55:33] ARE YOU with me?
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; So we see see now people are listening
[1:55:42] to too much negativity,
[1:55:45] listening to too many other voices,
[1:55:49] listening to voice of discouragement,
[1:55:51] voice of pleasure, voice of deception.
[1:55:55] Now you know what prophet said. The
[1:55:57] voices are drowning out the voice of
[1:55:59] God. Can you say amen? So there's only
[1:56:02] one voice. Everybody say one voice.
[1:56:05] There's only one voice that we are to
[1:56:06] listen to. And Jesus said, "My sheep
[1:56:08] know my voice, and a stranger they will
[1:56:11] not follow."
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; If you notice, the spirit speaks to each
[1:56:15] age, saying that he that hath an ear,
[1:56:18] let him hear what the spirit saith to
[1:56:20] the church.
[1:56:23] Now, I'm going to hurry up here, but
[1:56:28] well, I'm just going to move on because
[1:56:29] I know you know these things, but I do
[1:56:33] want to get into a point. Brother Brand
[1:56:35] talked about the symphony.
[1:56:39] And if you've ever been to a symphony,
[1:56:41] it's u I've only been once
[1:56:45] and uh there in Tulsa and uh we had
[1:56:49] gotten we had just before we moved up
[1:56:52] here actually uh we had gotten Faith um
[1:56:56] in touch with a violinist
[1:56:59] and this lady played in the Philarmonic
[1:57:03] uh symphony and so she gave us we got
[1:57:06] free pass to go to the symphony. never
[1:57:08] been to one. And so when you're there,
[1:57:11] you know, and you get there early,
[1:57:13] everybody's practicing and it's it's it
[1:57:15] hurts your ears if you're if you you
[1:57:18] know, I this is rough, you know, and I
[1:57:22] told uh my wife said, "Man, this is
[1:57:24] horrible,
[1:57:26] you know, cuz they're all playing their
[1:57:28] own part and it's it's all whack."
[1:57:31] And uh
[1:57:34] well then you see the director,
[1:57:38] he opens the door and here he comes and
[1:57:40] and just everybody
[1:57:43] hushes
[1:57:46] and they all put their, you know, they
[1:57:48] all line up, you know, whatever, getting
[1:57:50] posture and he stands on that podium
[1:57:55] and he looks at him and they're all
[1:57:56] looking at him
[1:57:58] and then he has his little stick and he
[1:58:00] starts doing this and before you know
[1:58:02] it, you starting hearing the sweetest
[1:58:04] sound.
[1:58:06] Well, Brother Bram describes this
[1:58:09] symphony that in the symphony they're
[1:58:11] telling a story.
[1:58:13] It's a it's a story that they're telling
[1:58:16] and he talks about Peter and whatever
[1:58:20] uh Peter and the wolf
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; and he describes that as all being told
[1:58:26] in a story when you know like when the
[1:58:29] uh when the wolf is growling they've got
[1:58:31] some instrument there to kind of depict
[1:58:34] that and when you know the wood pecker
[1:58:37] maybe uh or whatever then the drummer
[1:58:40] you know he's got little thing to make
[1:58:41] it sound like a woodpecker or whatever,
[1:58:43] but they're all telling the story. And
[1:58:46] and and now, Brother Brandham would tell
[1:58:49] us and and he says, "Now, anyone who
[1:58:51] knows the story that's reading it off of
[1:58:54] a paper can hear that symphony and how
[1:58:57] it's acting out that out, the drama
[1:59:00] playing it out. They know every change.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; They can look at it here and see the
[1:59:07] change." came down. See, now he says,
[1:59:11] "And those though WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE
[1:59:13] STORY LINE, THEY JUST SHOW UP and and
[1:59:16] and they just got there and and they
[1:59:19] don't know. They just hearing this, they
[1:59:21] just think it's all racket. See, it's
[1:59:24] racket to them. See?" Well, Jesus's
[1:59:27] ministry was nothing but a bunch of
[1:59:29] racket to the Pharisees and Sadducees.
[1:59:33] But those that had known what was going
[1:59:36] TO HAPPEN, THEY KNEW THEY THEY COULD
[1:59:39] LOOK AT THE SCRIPT AND LOOK AND SEE THAT
[1:59:42] SOMETHING'S CHANGED
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; in the symphony.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Nathaniel knew what the music sheet was
[1:59:52] saying for he said, "Thou art the king
[1:59:54] of Israel." See, I know it. I know who
[1:59:57] you are. REBRAHAM SAID, "HOW DID HE KNOW
[1:59:59] IT?" He was elected. The Alexi knows it
[2:00:02] always through every age. They know it.
[2:00:06] The woman at the well recognized the
[2:00:08] change in the music FOR SHE SAID, "COME
[2:00:10] AND SEE A MAN WHO'S TOLD ME EVERYTHING
[2:00:12] I'VE EVER DID. ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH?"
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; SO, Brother Brown said, "You've got to
[2:00:21] understand what it is. It's all done by
[2:00:24] signs and motions, but it's it acts out
[2:00:26] a drama in this symphony." He said, "We
[2:00:29] notice the the only one that understands
[2:00:31] a symphony is the composer. And those
[2:00:34] who are interested in knowing it, knows
[2:00:37] it changes, knows what takes place. The
[2:00:41] composer knows every move from the end
[2:00:43] to the beginning, from the beginning to
[2:00:45] the end." He said, "Did you know that
[2:00:47] the one who wrote it up, he composes
[2:00:50] this? He knows every little junction. He
[2:00:53] knows every junction. So does the
[2:00:55] director have to do. He he because he
[2:00:58] directs it. Ain't that right? So he says
[2:01:00] the director and the composer has to be
[2:01:03] in the same spirit.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; If the director isn't in the same spirit
[2:01:07] of the composer, he cannot act it out
[2:01:10] because it's all done by signs. And if
[2:01:13] the SIGN DOESN'T VINDICATE IT, HOW IS
[2:01:15] THE MUSICIANS GOING TO PLAY IT?
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; He said that's why the minister in the
[2:01:21] word of God, God's great symphony, he
[2:01:24] said he has been playing since the dawn
[2:01:26] of time. The minister at the word has to
[2:01:28] not look over here and say, "Well, I
[2:01:31] believe this ought to be and and you
[2:01:33] ought to make it this way." SEE, HE'S
[2:01:36] GOT TO go the way the sheet music says
[2:01:39] it.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THE GOSPEL HAS GOT TO BE
[2:01:42] PREACHED, THE WAY THE WORD says it.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; So, we can see that that you know that
[2:01:51] the bride, this is where the bride is
[2:01:53] coming to. She's getting in symphony.
[2:01:56] She's She's starting to play her part.
[2:01:58] This is where we're at. We know what
[2:02:00] we're doing.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; So, here
[2:02:06] 1963, Brother Bram said, "If we would
[2:02:08] only know what day we're living in,
[2:02:09] there wouldn't be so much confusion
[2:02:11] about this message and about the
[2:02:13] scriptures that we're trying to bring to
[2:02:14] the people. If the people only
[2:02:16] understand that we are at the end time,
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE WORD AND SEE WHERE WE'RE
[2:02:22] LIVING. THEN YOU SEE then you can see
[2:02:25] pennies what they do but you can see
[2:02:29] those who are glistening watching and
[2:02:32] knows the word and watching for these
[2:02:34] signs to happen.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So you get you get you become part of
[2:02:41] that symphony. Amen. Through the baptism
[2:02:44] of the Holy Ghost. How many believes
[2:02:46] that?
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; You receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:48] Ghost. You're not going to become
[2:02:49] against the word. You're going to fall
[2:02:51] in line with that word. See, it becomes
[2:02:54] a routine to you. Every day is a routine
[2:02:57] of following the scriptures and the
[2:02:58] plans of God. You believe that?
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:03:04] brother Brandham in this and I thought
[2:03:06] it was important that I do want to bring
[2:03:10] and I'm skipping a lot, but he says,
[2:03:12] "Stay in the symphony. Stay in God's
[2:03:15] word no matter how hard it is."
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters.
[2:03:23] Life is hard.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; And the way we have taken is a hard way.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said to to to brother
[2:03:34] Brandon? Because thou hast chosen the
[2:03:36] hard path.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; The harder way.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; This is the harder way that we've
[2:03:41] chosen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to be miserable.
[2:03:44] I That's If you're miserable, you've not
[2:03:47] caught the revelation of the message.
[2:03:50] See, but it is a hard time, a hard way.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; But he says, NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS,
[2:03:56] STAY right with it. Wherever God is
[2:04:00] beating.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he causes trouble to break the
[2:04:05] bands to set you free. He does that. You
[2:04:08] say, "Well, I don't know what what what
[2:04:10] I do." He does.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; What difference? See, you're just
[2:04:15] playing the part. He is the one that's
[2:04:17] got you in his hand. He directs you.
[2:04:19] Right. Another place he says many people
[2:04:23] ask me why must these things happen and
[2:04:26] and maybe you're in this situation in
[2:04:29] the you know I know you know different
[2:04:31] ones struggling in your physical body
[2:04:34] others are struggling maybe in
[2:04:37] discouragement and maybe in just in life
[2:04:41] trying to you younger couples maybe
[2:04:44] trying to find your way and and and
[2:04:47] you're working hard and just seems like
[2:04:50] it just you you know you're beating not
[2:04:52] getting anywhere.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says you know many people
[2:04:58] ask me why must these things happen? Why
[2:05:00] did this happened to me? Why did I start
[2:05:03] and this happened? I had this trouble
[2:05:05] and this upset me here and I lost this
[2:05:07] here. He says sometimes I've asked why.
[2:05:12] Why? When I was just a young minister,
[2:05:14] first started out, why did God take my
[2:05:17] wife right out from under me and take my
[2:05:19] baby right from beneath me, right
[2:05:21] beneath my heart,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; why did he do that? Well, I didn't know
[2:05:25] then, but I do now.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; I just held my hand in his and kept
[2:05:31] trusting.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's what you've got to do. Every one
[2:05:35] of you.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; This preacher's got to do this.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Sometime we don't know tomorrow. I I
[2:05:40] don't know. I wished I had answers for
[2:05:42] you.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; I wished I had answers for my own
[2:05:45] complications.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; I wished I did. I you know, and I I know
[2:05:50] we got answers in the message and all
[2:05:52] that, but you understand. I in other
[2:05:53] words, I WISHED I COULD SAY be done with
[2:05:56] it and you're all okay and and we're
[2:05:59] all, you know, troublefree and trial
[2:06:01] free. AND
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; I I WISH I COULD
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; I wish they could just go by the hand
[2:06:08] physically and grab your children and
[2:06:09] bring them in to the message
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; and say, "Stay there."
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Start living for God.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; I can't.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; I I wished I had the answers or the
[2:06:21] capability
[2:06:23] of of of these things.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Making life easier.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:06:28] But
[2:06:30] brother Brandham says, "See, I just held
[2:06:33] my hand in his and kept trusting." And
[2:06:36] that's what you got to do.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; That's what you GOT TO DO.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EVERY JUNCTION.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE rhythm
[2:06:44] and when it must take place.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD YOU.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; He knows what kind of material he's
[2:06:54] going to use.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. See the backside of the desert
[2:06:58] sometimes where God molds righteous men
[2:07:01] into sages and prophets.
[2:07:05] That's where men are beat out. Men are
[2:07:07] beat out in the word
[2:07:11] when they got all kind of creed and
[2:07:13] stuff in them. Let them come to THE WORD
[2:07:15] AND GOD BEATS IT RIGHT OUT OF THEM and
[2:07:17] molds it right into this into the great
[2:07:21] symphony of his word. Then they see the
[2:07:25] word moving on. Can you say amen?
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; God knows when the rhythm of it has to
[2:07:31] change.
[2:07:33] HE KNOWS HOW THE RHYTHM GOES. I DON'T
[2:07:36] KNOW HOW IT GOES, BUT HE KNOWS.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HOW IT GOES. I DON'T. But I
[2:07:41] look at it here and I say, "Well, it's
[2:07:44] just coming."
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; And I got to tell you, the rhythm's
[2:07:47] going to change for you.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; You just got to stay steady. That's
[2:07:52] right.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Many are the afflictions of
[2:08:01] the righteous, but God deliverth them
[2:08:03] out him out of them all."
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; See, God has moved through history with
[2:08:07] the rhythm of the promise of his word in
[2:08:09] each age. In the same rhythm, making his
[2:08:13] word and that's how God moved through
[2:08:15] the h THROUGH HISTORY FROM ALL THE way
[2:08:18] from Genesis to Revelation. He has moved
[2:08:20] through history with his word. That's
[2:08:23] right. WITH THE RHYTHM OF THE POWER OF
[2:08:26] THE HOLY SPIRIT, vindicating his word to
[2:08:29] the elected. Remember, he's never been
[2:08:31] able to touch the outside church. It's
[2:08:34] only the elected.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Now, he says, remember, it's all done by
[2:08:42] a sign. We see the time we're living in
[2:08:44] by the by the sign we're living in. So,
[2:08:48] we know what si the symphony does today.
[2:08:50] It's separating time. Everybody say it's
[2:08:52] separating time.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; TAKING THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; He says, let's say it together so you
[2:08:59] won't forget. It's taking the light from
[2:09:03] the darkness.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He says, let's say it again. It's taking
[2:09:07] the light from the darkness.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[2:09:17] Amen.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I wish I thought I had
[2:09:21] the quote here, but apparently I don't.
[2:09:27] But he said it's like in the symphony,
[2:09:31] if you notice and you're hearing that
[2:09:33] symphony, sometimes it
[2:09:35] comes loud and then it drops back
[2:09:40] slow, soft,
[2:09:42] he said, but it's all part of the story,
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; he said. And that's the way it is with
[2:09:46] your life.
[2:09:49] Your life has its ups and its downs.
[2:09:53] It has its high moments and it has its
[2:09:56] low moments.
[2:09:58] But it's God working something out in
[2:10:01] your life through this for the symphony.
[2:10:03] It's your life beating with the rhythm.
[2:10:05] Not everything is high high volume.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYTHING OF YOUR LIFE IS JUST A
[2:10:11] FORCEFUL THING.
[2:10:13] Sometimes you're laidback and you don't
[2:10:16] know what to do. And maybe you're not
[2:10:19] getting much in life. And maybe it to
[2:10:21] you it may seem like you're not being
[2:10:22] much of an influence to others and God's
[2:10:25] got you kind of hit back and you don't
[2:10:27] know. You just you kind of question
[2:10:29] about your ministry. You're wondering
[2:10:31] about your life and you're wondering
[2:10:32] about if God's but no, it's it's part of
[2:10:36] the symphony.
[2:10:37] It's God just just doing something. But
[2:10:40] remember, the rhythm's going to change.
[2:10:41] Every the THE MUSIC'S GOT TO CHANGE in
[2:10:44] your life as it has the church through
[2:10:46] all these years.
[2:10:48] You just got to hold his hand.
[2:10:52] Hold his hand and trust him.
[2:10:55] Keep following the scriptures. Let your
[2:10:57] life be routine. FOLLOWING THE
[2:11:00] SCRIPTURES, FOLLOWING HIS PLAN.
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:04] He knows what he's doing with your life.
[2:11:06] He knows what to do.
[2:11:09] I don't, but he does.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:11:17] And I know Satan would love for us to
[2:11:19] get discouraged and just throw up our
[2:11:20] hands and say, "Why?"
[2:11:23] He can't. You just got to keep pressing
[2:11:25] on. I'm part of the symphony.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; I'm part of the symphony.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; And I may be used just a little part,
[2:11:32] but that's okay. It's got to go. It's
[2:11:35] got to be part of it. They can't do it
[2:11:37] without me. And and the prophet said,
[2:11:39] you know, Paul would even say it and the
[2:11:41] prophet used it for our age. They
[2:11:43] without us cannot be made perfect.
[2:11:47] [Music]
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Just let your life be part of the
[2:11:54] symphony routinely yielding to God.
[2:11:59] Don't listen to the devil. Don't listen
[2:12:01] to all the confusion.
[2:12:03] Just be meek and be humble before the
[2:12:06] Lord. Say, "Father, I love you.
[2:12:10] I know you got it all worked out. I
[2:12:12] trust you.
[2:12:15] I may not see beyond the end of my nose,
[2:12:19] but I trust you.
[2:12:22] You're faithful.
[2:12:24] I will not allow myself to get into a
[2:12:26] whirlwind of confusion."
[2:12:30] Hallelujah.

[2:21:24] how wonderful you are.
[2:21:27] How your word just comes and sets us
[2:21:30] free.
[2:21:33] We see ourselves in the book, Lord.
[2:21:40] You've given us that liberty, Lord, just
[2:21:43] to fall in routine,
[2:21:47] obedience of your scriptures, and
[2:21:49] following your plan. And
[2:21:53] oh, the world is so blind
[2:21:56] to see what you have done in this day.
[2:22:00] And we certainly don't want to take it
[2:22:02] for granted. It's just your grace to us.
[2:22:05] And
[2:22:06] thank you. Thank you, Lord, for bringing
[2:22:10] us
[2:22:12] to the message and opening our eyes of
[2:22:15] understanding.
[2:22:18] Thank you for helping us through our ups
[2:22:20] and downs.
[2:22:24] We know it's just grace that's going to
[2:22:26] lead us through. It's grace. It's all
[2:22:29] grace.
[2:22:30] And we thank you for it. And I pray that
[2:22:32] you just bless the this church. Bless
[2:22:36] your people,
[2:22:40] Lord, in all their struggles,
[2:22:42] things they're going through
[2:22:45] physically, mentally, spiritually,
[2:22:50] Father, that they're steadfast,
[2:22:53] routinely following the scriptures
[2:22:58] and your plan.
[2:23:00] Father, the rapture isn't going to be
[2:23:02] nothing for us.
[2:23:04] It's just going to be something that we
[2:23:06] just do and we're so thankful and we're
[2:23:09] looking forward to that. I pray that you
[2:23:12] would grant the heart desire of every
[2:23:14] heart here today
[2:23:17] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:23:20] Amen.
[2:23:23] Amen.
[2:23:24] God bless you saints. You're dismissed.
[2:23:27] The fear of the Lord.
[2:23:30] Oh yes. Holy, holy,
[2:23:34] holy are you Lord.
