[20:18] Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood
[20:24] applied.
[20:26] Thank you Jesus.
[20:29] It has washed me white.
[20:34] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.

[21:23] Oh, I
[21:25] was a wretch.
[21:27] I remember who I was.
[21:30] I was lost. I was blind. I was running
[21:36] out of time.
[21:38] For sin
[21:40] separated,
[21:42] the breach was far too wide.
[21:46] But from the far side of the chasm,
[21:50] you held me in your side.
[21:53] So you
[21:55] made a way
[21:57] across the great divide.
[22:01] Left behind heaven's throne
[22:05] to build it here inside.
[22:08] And there at the cross
[22:13] you paid the debt I owe. You broke my
[22:17] chains, freed my soul.
[22:20] For the first time I had hope.
[22:24] Thank you Jesus for the blood
[22:30] of

[22:47] You brought me from the darkness
[22:50] into glorious
[22:52] light.
[22:56] Now you took my place, laid inside my
[23:01] tomb of sin.
[23:03] You were buried for 3 days, but then you
[23:08] walked right out again.
[23:11] Now death has no stain and life has no
[23:17] end.
[23:18] For I have been transformed
[23:22] by the blood of the lamb.

[24:18] life.
[24:20] You brought me from the darkness
[24:23] into glorious
[24:26] light as they would just play softly.
[24:28] Now, we've got a a written prayer
[24:31] request we want to make known. Amen. But
[24:34] first of all, we've got a testimony.
[24:36] Amen. is uh put in by sister Kim
[24:39] Brunumfield says, "I want to thank the
[24:41] Lord and give him praise for protecting
[24:43] my grandson." Uh, brother Levi Beach, he
[24:47] had totaled his vehicle last night,
[24:49] flipped it twice, and ended up in the
[24:51] creek upside down. Uh, his seat belt
[24:54] jammed, but he was finally able to uh
[24:58] get free and he swam back to the vehicle
[25:01] or to the back of the vehicle and uh got
[25:04] out that way. Amen. Is uh she said, "God
[25:07] was so merciful." Amen. We thank the
[25:09] Lord for what he did. Amen. Can you give
[25:11] the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[25:15] Amen.
[25:17] We also want to thank the Lord for
[25:18] touching Sister Lisa uh Acres. Good to
[25:21] have her back in church with us tonight.
[25:23] Amen. But let's just uh says, "Please
[25:26] pray for Wanda Smith. She had a stroke
[25:29] last Thursday.
[25:30] uh her and uh Robert Robera Poff will
[25:34] most likely uh be placed in a nursing
[25:36] home soon. So, let's just remember uh uh
[25:40] these people here tonight that the Lord
[25:42] would just uh comfort them. Amen. How
[25:45] many has an unspoken request but lift
[25:47] your hands? Amen. We want to keep
[25:50] Brother Zachary and uh Brother Jonathan
[25:53] Martin. Uh they're overseas. Amen. So,
[25:56] let's just pray that the Lord would just
[25:58] use them in a special way, but also
[26:00] bring them back safely. Amen. Maybe we
[26:03] could ask brother Terry if he would come
[26:05] and lead us in prayer tonight. Let's
[26:07] remember our pastor. Amen. That the Lord
[26:10] would just move in a special way. Amen.
[26:12] How many can say, "Lord, I need a touch
[26:14] from you." Amen.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; So, so good to be in his presence again.
[26:24] Bow heads. you just pray in your way as
[26:27] I lead in prayer.
[26:30] Heavenly Father, what a glorious hour
[26:32] that we're living in.
[26:34] We understand that we're living in
[26:36] Satan's kingdom, Satan's paradise. This
[26:39] is his hour that he's exalted, wanted to
[26:42] exalt himself like he said in Isaiah 14,
[26:45] and he's pretty much done it in this
[26:46] world as the God of all the kingdoms.
[26:49] But father, what a paradox it is that in
[26:51] this last day, not only has Satan uh
[26:53] become exalted, but God, you have chosen
[26:55] a bride and you sent a message and a
[26:57] word to bring her to a state of
[27:00] perfection, even innocence, even to uh a
[27:03] condition of adoption. What a paradox
[27:05] where you have the worst and then you
[27:07] have your chosen, oh God. But it's not
[27:09] anything we did, but it's all that you
[27:11] have done. We're thankful that you sent
[27:13] us a message. You sent us a prophet. You
[27:15] sent us guidance and certainly a light
[27:17] in this dark hour to show us how to
[27:19] walk. And truly, you're a lamp into our
[27:22] feet, a light into our pathway. And
[27:24] we're so thankful. I pray, Lord, for
[27:26] this request for Wanda, you know, her
[27:28] condition, all that is facing there. I
[27:31] pray that you would touch and undertake
[27:33] in her behalf. Lord, we're thankful for
[27:35] the two testimonies given in because we
[27:37] know that you are our healer. Whether it
[27:39] come by a miracle, instantaneous divine
[27:42] healing, it doesn't matter, Lord. But
[27:44] you promise to heal and by your stripes,
[27:46] we are already healed. We thank you for
[27:48] that great promise that we have. You
[27:50] said, "Whatsoever things you desire when
[27:52] you pray, believe that you shall receive
[27:53] them and you shall have them." And we
[27:55] believe that. Thank you for the little
[27:57] church here, the congregation, each one
[27:59] assembled tonight. Lord, as you uh give
[28:03] the words to our pastor to preach, Lord,
[28:05] anoint him to speak those things and may
[28:07] they be edification to our soul. Whether
[28:09] it be uh encouragement, whether it be a
[28:12] sharp sword, whatever it might be, Lord,
[28:14] that you have for us, we just want your
[28:17] divine will tonight. Bless us, we pray.
[28:19] We thank you for the all that you've
[28:21] done for us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[28:23] Amen.
[28:27] Oh, thank you Jesus
[28:30] for the blood applied.
[28:35] Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white.
[28:41] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[28:47] life.
[28:49] You brought me from the darkness
[28:52] into glorious light. You can be seated.
[28:57] [Music]
[28:58] Oh, I was a wretch. I remember who I
[29:04] was.
[29:05] I was lost. I was blind. I was running
[29:10] out of time.
[29:13] Oh, sin
[29:15] separated.
[29:17] The breach was far too wide.
[29:20] But from the far side of the chasm,
[29:24] you held me in your sight.
[29:28] So you made a way
[29:31] across the great divide.
[29:35] Left behind heaven's throne
[29:39] to build it here inside.
[29:42] And there at the cross,
[29:46] you paid the debt I owe.
[29:49] broke my chains, freed my soul.
[29:53] For the first time I had hope.
[29:58] Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood
[30:04] of
[30:07] Thank you Jesus. It has washed me wine.
[30:13] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[30:19] life.
[30:21] You brought me from the darkness into
[30:25] glory. As mom gets ready to come, let's
[30:27] sing it again. Thank you, Jesus, for the
[30:32] blood applied.
[30:36] Thank you, Jesus. It has washed me
[30:41] white.
[30:42] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[30:48] life.
[30:50] You brought me from the darkness into
[30:54] glorious
[30:56] light.
[30:58] Amen.
[31:04] I just want to testify of my healing,
[31:07] too. So, I've been dealing with
[31:08] something in my body and um
[31:14] um that sermon that Sean preached the
[31:16] other day. Um
[31:18] I can't remember exactly. I think it was
[31:21] just before we went to Oklahoma or
[31:23] something. and it's just really helped
[31:24] solidify things in my heart. But you
[31:27] know, when say when God comes, then of
[31:29] course the devil wants to try to come
[31:30] behind it
[31:32] &gt;&gt; and just feed you with fear or these
[31:34] different things and um just I've been,
[31:38] you know, just sometimes playing a
[31:39] message and you're not necessarily
[31:41] paying attention right at the moment.
[31:42] I'm doing things around the house, but
[31:44] it just seems like the Lord keeps just
[31:46] drawing my attention at just certain
[31:48] times to just keep anchoring my faith
[31:51] and and just to reject that fear.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And so I just I want to testify it
[31:57] beforehand. I still may be dealing with
[31:58] symptoms, but I believe that it's done.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm just like brother Ram said, I
[32:03] guess, devil, if you want to stick
[32:04] around and keep hearing me testify, then
[32:06] that's up to you. But it's going to go.
[32:09] So I just thank him for that.

[38:03] A hopeless case,
[38:05] [Music]
[38:07] an empty place.
[38:11] If not for grace.
[38:15] Amazing grace,
[38:19] how sweet the sound.
[38:24] I once was lost,
[38:28] but now I'm found.
[38:32] I was a hopeless case.
[38:36] an empty place
[38:40] if not for grace.
[38:42] Precious Lord, oh precious Lord,
[38:48] please take my hand.
[38:52] Lead me all
[38:56] and let me stand.
[39:00] A hopeless case,
[39:04] an empty place.
[39:08] If not for grace, where would I be?
[39:12] Where would I be?
[39:17] [Music]
[39:25] [Music]
[39:30] case
[39:32] an empty
[39:35] place
[39:36] if not for grace.
[39:40] Oh precious Lord,
[39:44] please take my hand
[39:48] and lead me on
[39:52] and let me stand.
[39:56] A hopeless case,
[40:00] an empty
[40:02] space
[40:04] if not for grace.
[40:07] [Music]
[40:09] Well, aren't you glad for the grace of
[40:11] God?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's with us every day of our
[40:16] lives. And a lot of times we don't
[40:20] realize just I think of, you know, his
[40:23] grace that is with us every day. and
[40:26] keeping us safe. And amen. I think it's
[40:29] the grace of God that we're here
[40:31] tonight. Amen. To worship him. And uh
[40:35] it's good to see everyone in the house
[40:37] of the Lord. Trust you had a good day
[40:39] today. And uh the musicians can be
[40:44] dismissed.
[40:45] And if you have your Bibles, we're just
[40:47] going to go right on into the word uh
[40:49] the book of Zechariah.
[40:52] And while you're turning, um
[40:56] I um
[40:58] glad to hear that the Lord kept Levi
[41:01] safe there. Amen. And um
[41:05] um
[41:07] we uh got to know him a little bit and
[41:10] he's just a fine young man. But um also
[41:15] um brother Hunter uh let me know this
[41:18] evening about their meeting coming up
[41:21] next week. And um so it's going to be
[41:24] starting actually a week from today uh
[41:27] November um or November October 8th
[41:33] through the 12th.
[41:36] And um so um the service time will be at
[41:40] 7:00
[41:43] uh through Friday
[41:45] and um and then Saturday evening we'll
[41:49] start at 6 and um so the Lord's blessed
[41:53] them with a new building and u I've seen
[41:57] some pictures of it and it's looks just
[41:59] a beautiful place and uh so we're really
[42:02] happy for them and Um, so they're going
[42:06] to be dedicating it um uh during this uh
[42:10] time. I don't know who will be
[42:11] ministering
[42:13] uh but uh I'm sure you will be blessed
[42:16] if you're able to go and um uh we just
[42:21] be uh praying that God just blesses them
[42:23] abundantly.
[42:25] Also, uh brother Andrew asked me to
[42:28] greet you all and uh he's there in
[42:30] Alabama with brother Homer this evening.
[42:33] And so, um, anyways, I, uh, I guess most
[42:38] everyone know they've just had their
[42:39] baby, uh,
[42:42] girl. And so, uh, she's a a cutie. And,
[42:46] and then, um,
[42:49] um, the little Malachi, he was, you
[42:54] know, kicking a ball in the house. He
[42:56] fell,
[42:58] broke a, uh, broke his leg. Um, I think
[43:01] his femur or something. So he's in a
[43:04] cast. The whole leg, one's whole leg is
[43:06] in the cast and then the other leg is
[43:10] part in the cast. So he's in bad shape.
[43:13] And so u I'm sure they'll appreciate
[43:16] your prayers for that. And it all
[43:19] happened at the same time around u uh
[43:22] the birth and and so uh sister Mariah's
[43:26] got her hands full. Amen. and and so we
[43:29] want to keep them in our prayer that the
[43:31] Lord will help them. Let's just bow our
[43:35] heads in a word of prayer as we talk to
[43:38] our Lord. Father,
[43:41] we just thankful, Lord, that you've had
[43:43] your hand upon us.
[43:46] Lord, even in times that we don't even
[43:49] know, you've kept us from danger.
[43:52] We thank you, Lord, for keeping our
[43:56] young brother Levi and uh keeping him
[44:00] safe. And Father, we just so indebted to
[44:04] you of your mercy. And we're just asking
[44:07] that you would be with us this evening
[44:10] and that you would just move among us,
[44:13] Father. that you would just take our the
[44:17] simple thought that I believe you've
[44:19] laid on my heart and that you would just
[44:23] uh uh multiply it to us. And Father,
[44:27] give us an a greater understanding.
[44:31] Father, we need you tonight. And pray
[44:34] that you would anoint both speaker and
[44:35] hearer. Bless brother Andrew as he would
[44:38] be ministering tonight. Father, I pray
[44:41] that you just bless the bride around the
[44:43] world. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[44:47] Amen.
[44:49] Praise the Lord. Uh so um Zechariah
[44:54] and um
[44:57] we're going to look at the fourth
[44:59] chapter
[45:01] and um the um
[45:05] first verse will start there. But it
[45:08] says, "And the angel that talked with me
[45:11] came again and wake me as a man that is
[45:15] wakened out of his sleep and said unto
[45:18] me, what seeest thou?" And I said, I
[45:20] have looked, and behold, a candlestick
[45:22] of all of gold, with a bowl on up on top
[45:26] of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and
[45:30] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[45:33] upon the top thereof,
[45:36] and two olive trees by it, one upon the
[45:38] right side of the bowl, and the other
[45:41] upon the left side thereof. And so I
[45:45] answered and spake to the angel that
[45:47] talked with me, saying, "What are these,
[45:49] my Lord?" And the angel that talked with
[45:52] me answered and said unto me, "Knowest
[45:55] thou not what these be?" And I said,
[45:57] "No, my Lord." Then he answered and
[46:00] spake unto me, saying, "This is the word
[46:03] of the Lord unto Zerubabel, saying, Not
[46:06] by might, nor by power, but by my
[46:09] spirit, saith the Lord of hosts." Amen.
[46:13] Then if you'll turn to Zechariah the
[46:17] 12th chapter
[46:20] and just read one
[46:24] uh verse there. Zechariah 12 and 10.
[46:31] And I will pour upon the house of David
[46:33] and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[46:36] the spirit of grace and of
[46:39] supplications.
[46:42] And they shall look upon me whom they
[46:44] have pierced.
[46:46] And they shall mourn for him as one
[46:49] mourneth for his only son and shall be
[46:53] in bitterness for him as one that is in
[46:55] bitterness for his firstborn.
[46:59] Amen. You can have your seats this
[47:01] evening.
[47:03] And if I were to use a title,
[47:06] it would be the uh spirit of grace is
[47:09] upon us.
[47:12] And uh
[47:14] we know that grace is and uh it's the
[47:18] unmmerited favor
[47:21] that is shown to someone who doesn't
[47:25] deserve it. Right.
[47:27] And uh so
[47:29] every Christian should kn know what what
[47:32] this this means.
[47:35] Grace is as old as the world is. And we
[47:39] first see the display of God's grace in
[47:43] the beginning um when it was displayed
[47:46] to the human race in the Garden of Eden
[47:50] and God had given his law to man and
[47:55] told man, you know, not to do a certain
[47:58] thing and uh that if he were to do it,
[48:02] then he would die in the day that he
[48:04] would eat thereof.
[48:07] And so we find that everything was going
[48:10] good and then Eve stepped across the uh
[48:15] separating line the prophet would say by
[48:18] transgressing against God's law
[48:22] &gt;&gt; and she enticed her husband to do the
[48:26] same uh there and and um and so you know
[48:33] uh as we know that a law isn't a law
[48:37] unless there's a penalty to that law.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Um, you know, if if it says don't run
[48:44] the stop line and there's no penalty,
[48:46] then there's no law uh uh to that. But
[48:50] but God had a law.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; And so
[48:55] that day, God would come down as he
[48:58] always did in the cool of the evening to
[49:01] fellowship with Adam and Eve. and and uh
[49:05] but uh when when he came down, he knew
[49:08] that something was wrong um because they
[49:12] weren't there. Uh and it was a darkness.
[49:15] Brother Bram said there was just a dark
[49:17] mist hanging over the garden and the
[49:22] birds weren't singing that day. The the
[49:25] the wind wasn't blowing. There was
[49:29] nothing to stare. The the leaves weren't
[49:31] even moving. It was just a darkness and
[49:35] prophet said there no doubt there there
[49:37] there wasn't a star that was shining
[49:41] um uh that that evening uh because sin
[49:46] had blotted out the light
[49:49] &gt;&gt; and God came down as the prophet would
[49:53] describe it. He he came down roaring
[49:56] like a thunder.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; And he would go calling out, "Adam,
[50:01] where art thou?"
[50:03] And we know that Adam, he realized that
[50:06] he was uh unclothed and and so he tried
[50:11] to cover himself up so to meet God.
[50:15] And when God come to meet with him and
[50:19] Adam come into his presence, Amen. Uh
[50:24] God found him hiding.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; And which tells us that no matter what
[50:32] covering that man comes up with uh it's
[50:36] not good enough for God's presence.
[50:38] Ain't that right?
[50:40] And and so brother Brandham would tell
[50:43] us that this covering was man's
[50:46] religion.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Man tries to cover himself up with
[50:51] his own religion. And and so Adam had
[50:54] nowhere to go. He had nowhere to turn.
[50:58] Uh
[51:00] he and his wife, they they had no way
[51:02] out. Uh because they they they were
[51:07] guilty. They were unc in condemnation,
[51:10] under condemnation.
[51:12] Uh, brother Ram said that the holy image
[51:15] of God left them. Uh, the sinful nature,
[51:20] countenance, and and all of these
[51:22] things. It it must have been quite a
[51:25] change
[51:27] &gt;&gt; uh for them to experience
[51:30] peace and then all of a sudden fear
[51:34] &gt;&gt; to have this fellowship and
[51:36] understanding of God and and all of a
[51:39] sudden it it loses its its uh uh there's
[51:44] no understanding as what he had and
[51:47] there's no fellowship and and all of
[51:49] that. But when it was all bleak and it
[51:53] looked like it was just uh no way out,
[51:57] grace provided a way out.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And the prophet would tell us that God
[52:02] killed some sheep, took the skins, and
[52:05] it it showed that something had to die
[52:08] to cover sin.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Church joining will never cover sin. No
[52:12] driedyed confession will ever cover sin.
[52:17] It takes sorrow and repentance and the
[52:21] grace of God to cover sin for the blood
[52:24] of Jesus Christ, the one that God killed
[52:27] at Calvary to cover sin. Ain't that
[52:30] right?
[52:31] &gt;&gt; So, uh um you know, to believe that
[52:34] anyone can be a Christian
[52:38] uh uh would would would be wrong. or to
[52:42] think that anyone can believe this
[52:45] message
[52:46] uh it it w would be a wrong thought
[52:50] because it's the grace of God
[52:54] &gt;&gt; that that does this. You know a person
[52:56] can't even be a Christian without the
[52:58] grace of God. How many believes that?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't even be a Christian without
[53:03] the grace of God. Amen. People can go to
[53:06] church. They can worship. They can get
[53:09] involved with the music and hear the
[53:12] word of God being preached, but no man
[53:15] can be saved without grace. That's
[53:19] right.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for grace
[53:21] &gt;&gt; cuz you're not saved by your desire.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; You're not saved by good will.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; You're not saved by your determination.
[53:30] You're not saved by your smart and and
[53:33] education and all of that. Ain't that
[53:35] right? And so uh something that uh we
[53:40] see is that grace cannot be bought and
[53:44] it cannot be sold.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[53:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot bargain for it by saying God
[53:52] if you'll do this then I'll do this or
[53:54] if I do this then then then I expect you
[53:57] to do this and uh there there's no
[54:00] bargaining for grace.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Grace is unmmerited.
[54:05] Ain't that right?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet says with grace, you
[54:09] cannot pull nothing out of God.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Now think of that. You cannot pull
[54:16] nothing out of God. God gives it to you
[54:20] by his grace.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; So you cannot merit God's grace. And
[54:26] this, you know, by doing good deeds and
[54:30] and and this may be simple, but just to
[54:34] remind us of really why we're here
[54:37] tonight.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 2:8, it says, "For by
[54:42] grace you are saved through faith, and
[54:46] that not of yourselves, it is the gift
[54:49] of God."
[54:50] So even if we have the faith to believe,
[54:54] that's not of ourselves, that's by
[54:57] grace. For it is the gift of God that
[55:01] has been given to us, not of works, lest
[55:04] any man should boast. Ain't that right?
[55:07] So if God is dealing with you, if if if
[55:12] God brings conviction to you, that's the
[55:16] grace of God that has come to you.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; If um you know uh uh Jesus said in John
[55:25] 6:44, "No man, everybody say no man
[55:28] &gt;&gt; can come to me except the father
[55:33] &gt;&gt; which hath sent me draw him." no man.
[55:37] Ain't that right?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; And and and so when you really think of
[55:41] that, you couldn't come even to Christ.
[55:45] You couldn't come to the knowledge of
[55:47] believing in God and believing in
[55:50] knowing what you know and being sold out
[55:54] to this without grace.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; The father had to call you and in invite
[56:01] you uh uh to this. Ain't that right? The
[56:05] prophet said, "Grace has to save you."
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Grace has to save you. So if if
[56:14] you have an understanding of what God
[56:16] has done in this day and is doing uh in
[56:21] this age, it's the grace of God that has
[56:24] come to you.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Luke 10:22, "And all
[56:29] things are delivered to me of my Father,
[56:32] and no man knoweth who the Son is."
[56:35] Everybody say, "No man knoweth." No man
[56:38] knoweth who the Son is. Amen.
[56:41] Everybody's just guessing who the Son
[56:42] is. They They've got their idea of who
[56:45] the Son is. They say they're worshiping
[56:48] the Son, but but but it it's through an
[56:51] idea of who the Son is. For no man
[56:54] knoweth who the Son is, but the Father,
[56:57] and who the Father is, but the Son, and
[57:01] he to whom the Son will reveal him.
[57:04] Ain't that right? And he turned him unto
[57:07] his disciples, and said privately,
[57:10] Blessed are the eyes which see the
[57:14] things that you see. Can you say amen?
[57:17] They they were in a world of of of
[57:20] millions of people that that could not
[57:23] see what they were seeing. Ain't ain't
[57:27] that right? But it was it was grace unto
[57:30] them. Amen. Upon their lives according
[57:35] to the Bible that uh uh there's going to
[57:38] be an overcomer. And the only comer the
[57:41] the only the overcomer is going to go in
[57:45] the rapture. Amen. And so who is the
[57:49] overcomer? Amen. The prophet said the
[57:51] overcomer is the one who has overcome
[57:54] the temptation of the age that he lived
[57:56] in. Ain't that right? See, he's overcome
[58:00] every denominational critic. He's
[58:02] overcomes all po the popular sins of the
[58:06] age in which he lives. Overcomes all the
[58:09] worldly things of this age. Ain't that
[58:12] right? But yet if you have the ability
[58:16] to overcome, it's only by the grace of
[58:20] God that is brought to you. Amen. I no,
[58:25] no matter how determined you are, no
[58:28] matter how new uh uh much New Year's
[58:31] leaf uh uh new, you know, resolutions
[58:34] you make, it takes the grace of God for
[58:39] man to overcome. Can you say amen?
[58:42] People are living uh you know today and
[58:46] who just can't seem to overcome and yet
[58:50] there's others that are overcoming. Now
[58:53] I want to just say this church we we are
[58:55] in a battle. We are in a real battle. Uh
[59:00] Christian life is not a makebelie.
[59:02] Christian life isn't a mind over matter.
[59:06] It it is something that is real. It's
[59:09] something that is um you know, we're
[59:11] really dealing with demonic spirits.
[59:14] Ain't that right? And the prophet told
[59:16] us that the lid of hell has been uh uh
[59:20] lifted off and demons are pouring in.
[59:24] That is a literal happening.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It literally happened that demons, amen,
[59:30] were poured in, amen, in this uh in this
[59:34] rim of mortality.
[59:36] Amen. in and is able to have its effect.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. People don't know why. Amen. The
[59:43] things that are going on as they're, you
[59:46] know, uh uh coming into churches now and
[59:49] shooting up as y'all just saw that uh
[59:52] Mormon uh what happened to the Mormons
[59:55] uh there at that church in Michigan and
[59:57] it it's happening more prominent and and
[1:00:00] shootings every day and murders and and
[1:00:04] uh just all kinds of chaos. Amen. It's
[1:00:07] It's simply because demon power is at
[1:00:12] work.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; People say, "Well, they're good boys.
[1:00:17] They they that was a good girl and and
[1:00:19] and all these things and they just don't
[1:00:21] know what happened." Well, we know what
[1:00:23] happened is demonic powers is is
[1:00:27] controlling.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And these powers uh of of these
[1:00:31] spirits cannot be broken without the
[1:00:34] grace of God. Don't turn me down. I
[1:00:37] don't know what's happened. Oh, my my
[1:00:38] microphone fell. Sorry. Uh uh the uh and
[1:00:43] so we the power of these spirits cannot
[1:00:46] be broken without the grace of God.
[1:00:49] Ain't that right? You know, Brother
[1:00:51] Brandham talks about these cigarettes
[1:00:53] and and and and he said he was talking
[1:00:56] to some folks uh about it and and and
[1:00:59] and uh one one man said, you know, um uh
[1:01:04] you know, cigarettes um uh they're
[1:01:07] they're hard uh hard to overcome. And
[1:01:10] and brother Ram said, "Well, it's it's
[1:01:13] because it's a devil." Amen. And he
[1:01:16] talks about how there are people that
[1:01:18] come through the line and got healed of
[1:01:20] cancer and and before you know it, they
[1:01:22] go right back to smoking cigarettes
[1:01:25] again.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Ram said, "You cannot
[1:01:28] stop smoking cigarettes unless the power
[1:01:32] of God is upon you."
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; No matter. I've seen it. I've seen kin
[1:01:38] folk that that tried to quit that, you
[1:01:40] know, and it's just only a little old a
[1:01:43] stick. Amen. And you got a, you know,
[1:01:45] 200 and some pound guy that's just a
[1:01:49] muscle or whatever and yet that little
[1:01:52] thing seems to control him. But it's
[1:01:54] just a spirit.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; It's a power of the devil. Ain't that
[1:01:58] right?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And so you can't stop it unless the
[1:02:02] power of God is upon you.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talks of two men that he
[1:02:06] knew and they smoked. And he said both
[1:02:08] of them wanted to be men of God. One of
[1:02:11] them, as soon as I led him to Christ, he
[1:02:13] started to light up a cigarette. He
[1:02:15] smoked five to six packs a day and just
[1:02:18] sat and just light one after another all
[1:02:20] day long. And he tried to light another
[1:02:23] cigarette and something just wouldn't
[1:02:25] let him. He walked over to the stove,
[1:02:27] not knowing that the scriptures
[1:02:29] condemned those things, and opened up
[1:02:32] the stove and shoved the pack in the
[1:02:34] stove and that settled it. And where
[1:02:37] another fella that wanted to become a
[1:02:39] Christian, he tried his best. He cried
[1:02:41] out to the Lord. He quit them for two or
[1:02:44] three weeks. And when he come to himself
[1:02:46] in that condition, he went out of his
[1:02:48] mind. See, he come to himself and found
[1:02:52] himself out in the backyard beating on a
[1:02:54] piece of tin out of his head. He run in
[1:02:57] the house real quick, grabbed his
[1:02:59] cigarettes, and smoked a pack before he
[1:03:01] left the house that evening, just one
[1:03:04] right after the other. He said, "See,
[1:03:06] one was called for no man can come to
[1:03:09] the father except the father draws him
[1:03:12] and all the father has given me will
[1:03:15] come to me." Can you say amen? Well,
[1:03:18] what did the warning mean? It was to
[1:03:20] life to one. He saw it. You can't see it
[1:03:24] unless God reveals it. For it's hid from
[1:03:27] the eyes of the wise and prudent and
[1:03:30] revealed to babes such as we'll learn.
[1:03:33] Can you say amen?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; We think of another that's an addiction
[1:03:37] and that's pornography. Pornography is
[1:03:40] it's an addiction.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that cannot be broken
[1:03:46] without the grace of God. Amen. I I
[1:03:49] looked up a um uh just uh the research
[1:03:53] and and in 2023 the popular site Pornhub
[1:03:58] reported that it has more than a 100
[1:04:01] million daily visits.
[1:04:04] a 100 million daily visits. And And it's
[1:04:08] it's many many I and it's not just men.
[1:04:11] It's it's women that are under a a
[1:04:15] bondage to pornography.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Research shows that the addiction to
[1:04:21] pornography is just the same as the
[1:04:24] addiction is to drugs. It's the same. It
[1:04:28] works the same way. They say it works on
[1:04:30] the on a person the same way drugs uh uh
[1:04:34] do and and these things and and so uh uh
[1:04:39] uh uh you know so that there are there
[1:04:42] are those who uh just declare they they
[1:04:45] can't quit. And so the excuse is well
[1:04:48] God knows just who I am and and and and
[1:04:51] and knows that you know we're just men
[1:04:54] and and humans and all that. But then
[1:04:56] there's those that have that ability to
[1:04:59] walk away from it. I don't think we have
[1:05:01] to make excuses. I just believe that
[1:05:04] there's a power that can break the
[1:05:07] chains of the devil.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes grace. It's a it's
[1:05:14] grace unto us. If if you're able to walk
[1:05:16] away from your habits, that's grace. If
[1:05:19] you're able just to leave things behind,
[1:05:22] that's grace. Can you say amen? I
[1:05:25] understand there's maturity and I
[1:05:27] understand there's growth and and all of
[1:05:29] these things, but as you see grace in a
[1:05:32] man's life and and and what is it? He's
[1:05:35] able to walk away from the past. He's
[1:05:38] able to walk away, amen, from those
[1:05:40] things that would try to bind him down.
[1:05:43] I I I just believe that. Can you say
[1:05:45] amen?
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Romans 9:15,
[1:05:50] it says, "For he saith to Moses, I will
[1:05:52] have mercy on him, I will have mercy,
[1:05:55] and I will have compassion, on whom I
[1:05:58] will have compassion." So then it is not
[1:06:01] of him that willth, nor of him that
[1:06:04] runth, but of God that showeth mercy.
[1:06:08] Can you say amen? Now, I want to say, if
[1:06:10] you have the least desire to serve God,
[1:06:13] that's the grace of God upon your life.
[1:06:15] That's right.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? If you have the
[1:06:18] ability to repent of your uh wrongs and
[1:06:22] your mistakes, that's the grace of God.
[1:06:25] Amen. If you have the ability to
[1:06:27] overcome, that's only by the grace of
[1:06:30] God. If you have the ability to believe
[1:06:32] and to keep pressing on, Amen.
[1:06:35] regardless of everything that goes on,
[1:06:38] that's the grace of God upon your life.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Philippians 2:13,
[1:06:47] it says, "For it is God which workketh
[1:06:50] in you." It's God. Amen. The spirit of
[1:06:54] grace that workketh in you both to will
[1:06:57] and to do of his good pleasure.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe that it's just uh
[1:07:05] uh God working to will. Amen. in us to
[1:07:09] will I want to. I desire and then that's
[1:07:12] as far as we go with it. I believe that
[1:07:16] this bride is moving on into action.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Not only willing to do it, but doing it.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:27] Revelations 19:7
[1:07:30] it says, "Let us be glad and rejoice
[1:07:33] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:07:36] of the lamb has come." And notice his
[1:07:39] wife. Everybody say his wife.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; A man hath made herself ready.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Now we're not looking at some woman over
[1:07:48] there. We are part of this.
[1:07:51] his wife, me,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; you
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; have made herself ready.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; So, what is she? What does it mean? She
[1:08:01] is standing as an overcomer.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; She is the spotless, sinless bride of
[1:08:08] Jesus Christ. All right.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And don't think for a moment, a man,
[1:08:13] that this bride hath made herself ready
[1:08:15] by her own will, by her own desires, by
[1:08:19] her own effort, and by her own talent
[1:08:22] and her strength. So, how does she make
[1:08:25] get into this condition of being ready?
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; As as the scripture saith, it's not by
[1:08:31] might nor by power, but by my spirit,
[1:08:35] saith the Lord. Do you believe that? Now
[1:08:39] notice what was foretold in Zechariah
[1:08:41] 4:7. Who art thou, oh great mountain
[1:08:45] before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a
[1:08:47] plain. You know, I I thought of this and
[1:08:51] and and we know we there's a lot of
[1:08:53] mountains. We have mountains. I don't
[1:08:56] care what it is. Whether it's a mountain
[1:08:58] of of habits and mountains of
[1:09:01] traditions, mountains of sickness,
[1:09:03] whatever it is. Amen. There comes a time
[1:09:07] that God said that mountain shall become
[1:09:10] a plain
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; and he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:09:16] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[1:09:20] grace unto it. Now, brother Brandham
[1:09:24] talks about that scripture and he says,
[1:09:26] "Now, this is foretelling, of course, of
[1:09:29] when the seventh angel would come to
[1:09:31] restore the faith of the children back
[1:09:34] to the father." In other words, rebuild
[1:09:37] the church again under the power of the
[1:09:41] spirit.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so this when this
[1:09:46] mountain shall become a plain is when
[1:09:50] the the uh the message amen of Malachi 4
[1:09:55] would come. Amen. And and of course the
[1:09:59] message of Malachi 4 fits with uh the
[1:10:02] seventh angel of Revelations 10:7. It's
[1:10:04] the one and the same. Ain't that right?
[1:10:07] Amen. And he begins the sound and he
[1:10:10] begins to restore a church
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; back
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; to the faith.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; He restores the church back by the power
[1:10:22] of God. Can you say amen? Rebuilding the
[1:10:26] church. Amen. Brother Brown says God by
[1:10:29] the Holy Spirit will bring forth the
[1:10:32] church in these last days. Do you
[1:10:36] believe that? Amen. The worst age ever.
[1:10:39] Amen. The most difficult age ever, the
[1:10:42] darkest times ever. And yet God by his
[1:10:46] holy spirit is going to bring forth a
[1:10:49] church in these last days.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; How is he going to do it? By his grace.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; If you look at the church, the prophet
[1:11:00] said that this church is called the
[1:11:02] called the elect lady misgrace.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's the elect lady. Misgrace.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That's what you are.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Misgrace.
[1:11:16] You're not You're not identified with
[1:11:18] with what the Baptist are doing. The
[1:11:20] apostolic and the Presbyterians and all
[1:11:23] of these things. You're not identified
[1:11:26] with the works of man. You are misgrace.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; You're identified with the power of
[1:11:32] grace.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? She is an elected
[1:11:37] woman. Now, Brother Bram speaks of us as
[1:11:40] the bride. He says, "He, the bridegroom,
[1:11:43] took away your shame." Well, aren't you
[1:11:45] glad for that? There's no way that he
[1:11:48] you could have your shame taken off
[1:11:50] away. You couldn't be good enough to
[1:11:52] take away your shame. But he by grace
[1:11:56] took away your shame. Amen. and put it
[1:12:00] in the sea of forgetfulness by the
[1:12:02] washing of the water of the word and the
[1:12:05] blood of life. Your first wedding was
[1:12:07] analled. It was you never done it in the
[1:12:11] first place.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Another place he said you were trapped
[1:12:15] into it.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? God made sure that
[1:12:19] your enemy could not bring up your
[1:12:22] accusations and your past and remind him
[1:12:25] of it. Every time the devil reminds God
[1:12:28] of your past, he can't remember it.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even know what that devil's
[1:12:34] talking about.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And when you remind God of your past,
[1:12:38] Amen. He doesn't even know what you're
[1:12:40] talking about because it's under the
[1:12:42] blood.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says, "You're pure,
[1:12:47] unadulterated." Oh, hallelujah. Leaving
[1:12:50] soon for the skies. Amen. Standing
[1:12:53] ready. Think your garments washed by the
[1:12:56] water of the bleeding word.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; The word become blood. The word bled for
[1:13:02] you. And you're washed in the bleeding
[1:13:04] word. The word bleeding. The life of God
[1:13:07] in the word. The word was bled for you
[1:13:10] that you might be washed.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; God provided a way out.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; God provided a way out. If he hadn't
[1:13:20] provided a way out, all of our covering
[1:13:22] of religion would not work. We couldn't
[1:13:25] stand before God spotless and and and
[1:13:28] justified. Amen. But God provided a
[1:13:31] blood. And the word bled that you might
[1:13:35] be washed from the filth of these
[1:13:37] prostitutes and be clean and and
[1:13:40] sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:13:43] of the word. that makes your mind and
[1:13:45] heart stayed on God and on his word.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Now, not notice what he says. This is it
[1:13:53] from the invisible union. He says, "And
[1:13:55] you're not only that,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; but you're going to the wedding
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; in the sky."
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Going to that wedding supper as we know
[1:14:05] the invisible union is taking place on
[1:14:07] the earth now. And you are wearing,
[1:14:10] everybody say, I am wearing
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; the wedding band of predestinated
[1:14:16] unmarited grace,
[1:14:19] a wedding band of grace, unmarited of
[1:14:23] your own. God did it himself.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:34] He knew you before the foundation of the
[1:14:36] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[1:14:38] you. There put your name on a book.
[1:14:43] I think of what David said. It is he
[1:14:45] that hath made us and not we ourselves.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; We are the making of God's grace.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; You believe it? Praise the Lord.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible,
[1:15:01] God has exerted his grace towards men
[1:15:04] and women
[1:15:06] as an example to us of what his grace
[1:15:10] can do.
[1:15:12] And we know these stories, but
[1:15:16] it's it's it fits us. But we look at
[1:15:19] Rahab.
[1:15:22] She of course was a harlot.
[1:15:26] But she was a gentile, a prostitute.
[1:15:30] Ain't that right?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; She was a heathen.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; She was not in the lineage of Abraham
[1:15:36] in the natural seed. That's right.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; She had no rights to the covenant that
[1:15:41] God made Abraham.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; She had no right to the blessings of
[1:15:45] God. She wasn't considered as one of
[1:15:48] God's chosen people.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. She was actually part of the enemy
[1:15:56] that God told Joshua to destroy.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And Joshua was coming to destroy her,
[1:16:07] her people, and her city.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. everything that she was known
[1:16:14] uh used to and her surroundings and her
[1:16:17] upbringings and and all of those things
[1:16:20] Joshua was coming to destroy.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; But notice what she asked there in
[1:16:27] Joshua 2:12. I pray you swear unto me by
[1:16:31] the Lord since I have showed you
[1:16:32] kindness that you will also show
[1:16:35] kindness unto my father's house and give
[1:16:37] me a true token and that you will save
[1:16:40] alive my father my mother. Notice not
[1:16:43] just praying for herself.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; But now she's asking for a family.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll save the life my father, my
[1:16:51] mother, my brethren, my sisters, and all
[1:16:54] that they have and deliver our lives
[1:16:57] from death.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Now, church, she didn't deserve the
[1:17:01] grace of God.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; She had no right to ask these two spies
[1:17:06] for mercy. There was no literature that
[1:17:09] she could read of grace. Amen. And mercy
[1:17:12] being promised to her.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; As far as she knew, there was nothing
[1:17:16] promised to her. back distraction.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But see, God knew her before the
[1:17:25] foundation of the world.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And God placed her in that time for such
[1:17:31] a time as that.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He poured upon her the
[1:17:38] spirit of grace. She was given a token
[1:17:42] by grace.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? She was given a
[1:17:47] promise that was not part of the
[1:17:49] Abrahamic covenant.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But God by grace gave her a promise.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Now, this promise is found in Joshua
[1:18:05] 2:18. Behold, the spies says, "When we
[1:18:09] come into the land,
[1:18:12] thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
[1:18:14] thread in the window which thou didest,
[1:18:17] let us down by, and thou shalt bring thy
[1:18:20] father, mother, and brethren, and and
[1:18:22] all thy father's household home unto
[1:18:25] thee." Ain't that right?
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Now, notice she believed the promise.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; She didn't have to say, "Well, I wonder
[1:18:33] if it's going to work. I better just see
[1:18:34] and just see if they're not see maybe
[1:18:36] they're lying to me. Maybe they're just
[1:18:38] teasing me or whatever. She went to work
[1:18:41] immediately.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. To go get her family. She went
[1:18:47] through that city wherever they were
[1:18:50] compelling them to come in where the
[1:18:53] token was. And when the death angel came
[1:18:57] uh Joshua with his army, she did not
[1:19:01] have to worry one bit for the token was
[1:19:05] on display.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; We find that grace not only delivered
[1:19:10] her from death, but she become part of
[1:19:14] Israel by marrying an officer in the
[1:19:16] army.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And through Ahab come the lineage of
[1:19:22] Christ.
[1:19:24] Can you say amen?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; It was a lineage of grace.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that Rahab bore a son by
[1:19:32] the name of Boaz,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; which Boaz was a type of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:37] Ain't that right? And Boaz married who?
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Well, some of us is awake.
[1:19:46] Boaz married Ruth.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Now, we look at Ruth.
[1:19:51] She was undeserving of God's grace.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Ruth was a Moabitete, not an Israelite.
[1:19:59] And her ancestry started, Amen. Uh uh
[1:20:02] from incest. Amen. Which was an evil act
[1:20:06] before God. She had no covenant with
[1:20:09] God.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; She had no promise like the children of
[1:20:12] Israel had.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? She didn't deserve
[1:20:17] God's grace.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. She she had no right to expect
[1:20:21] God's grace.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was no covenant of
[1:20:24] grace to her. Amen. But God rich in
[1:20:28] mercy poured out his spirit of grace
[1:20:33] upon her.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; She left her land and all that she knew.
[1:20:38] We know that her uh the other one op uh
[1:20:42] uh Orpa a man wanted to leave. Said that
[1:20:46] she was going to go as well. But when
[1:20:48] Naomi discouraged them, amen, and told
[1:20:52] him to stay behind, Amen. Or kissed uh
[1:20:56] Naomi and she turned back to what she
[1:20:59] was born in.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But Ruth would not be discouraged.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; God knew her before the foundation of
[1:21:05] the world. I say these things because
[1:21:08] God raised these women up to show us and
[1:21:12] where we could be identified in the
[1:21:14] scriptures for this last day. Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Ruth uh 1:15. And she
[1:21:20] Naomi said, "Behold, thy sister-in-law
[1:21:23] is gone back unto her people, and unto
[1:21:26] her gods, return thou after thy
[1:21:29] sister-in-law."
[1:21:30] And Ruth says, "Entreat me not to leave,
[1:21:33] or to return from following after thee.
[1:21:37] For whether thou goest, I will go.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Where thou lodest, I will lodge. Thy
[1:21:42] people shall be my people. Thy God, my
[1:21:46] God. Where thou dest will I die, and
[1:21:50] there will I be buried. The Lord do so
[1:21:53] to me, and more also if ought but death
[1:21:56] part thee and me. And when she Naomi saw
[1:22:00] that she, Ruth, was steadfastly minded
[1:22:03] to go with her, then she left, speaking
[1:22:06] unto her. Amen. In other words, she
[1:22:09] tried no more to discourage her. See,
[1:22:12] God gave grace unto Ruth.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And I I want to say this. Don't blame
[1:22:18] people for walking away from this
[1:22:20] message.
[1:22:21] Don't Don't Don't blame people, Amen.
[1:22:24] when they don't see what you see. See,
[1:22:27] the only way you see it is by God's
[1:22:29] grace.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; The only way you have a desire for this
[1:22:33] is by God's grace. The only way you're
[1:22:36] pressing on is by God's grace. Can you
[1:22:39] say amen? And God would have an orpa to
[1:22:43] to to type out those that just oh well
[1:22:46] they say I'm going to go they maybe
[1:22:48] start out to go but then they turn back
[1:22:51] over any little old discouragement.
[1:22:53] Amen. But there is a Ruth in this age
[1:22:56] that says no. Thy God will be my God.
[1:23:00] Thy thy people be my people. Can you say
[1:23:03] amen?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God brought Ruth to Boaz.
[1:23:11] And I like what brother Biscoll said one
[1:23:14] time. Her marriage to Boaz did not
[1:23:16] degrade Boaz.
[1:23:19] It did not make Boaz any lesser.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; It only elevated Ruth's position.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; It changed Ruth.
[1:23:31] It changed her life
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; because she was in marriage in union
[1:23:37] with Boaz. Can you say amen?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; See, and it tied her to the covenant
[1:23:44] that God made to Israel.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; It made her reputation better than ever.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And through her come
[1:23:54] the lineage of Christ. You see, God
[1:23:57] shows us that his grace elevates us to a
[1:24:01] place where we couldn't have come
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; without it.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; You here we are promised adoption of
[1:24:14] sons. Here we're coming into such a
[1:24:17] place that no other age has come to.
[1:24:21] We're coming to the manifestation of
[1:24:23] sunship
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; that no other age has come to.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; But God's grace has been given to us.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; God also shows that his grace not only
[1:24:41] comes to us in the beginning, but it
[1:24:44] stays with us throughout our walk with
[1:24:47] God.
[1:24:50] Take Abraham for example.
[1:24:53] He was a heathen, an idoltor.
[1:24:56] He's just like everyone else around him.
[1:24:59] Nothing special about him, just an
[1:25:01] ordinary man.
[1:25:03] But God had predestinated him before the
[1:25:07] foundation of the world.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] And
[1:25:12] when God came to him,
[1:25:15] called him, grace,
[1:25:19] his the calling was by grace.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And grace empowered Abraham
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; to leave his country. to leave
[1:25:32] everything that he had known, to leave
[1:25:35] the past behind,
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; and to look for another city.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; The rest of the people stayed behind.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:25:54] God didn't call them out,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? It was just Abraham.
[1:26:01] Abraham had the call.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham had the grace.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Abraham had the promise.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; See, and so, you know, this this is
[1:26:13] where I think uh that that well, we know
[1:26:17] that when God extended grace to Abraham,
[1:26:21] God required obedience from Abraham.
[1:26:25] Yeah.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I think this is where people get it get
[1:26:28] it wrong when they think that God
[1:26:30] doesn't require of them to do anything
[1:26:33] because of his grace. That's that's
[1:26:35] that's a lie.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you look that when grace
[1:26:40] comes to a person, God gives them
[1:26:44] something to do.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that Noah found grace
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of the Lord
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; and he built an ark.
[1:26:56] He prepared an ark for the salvation of
[1:26:59] his household.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; He had grace to do that.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He had grace to know the will of God.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; He had grace to know what God was going
[1:27:10] to do.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; God extended grace to Abraham,
[1:27:17] but he had to re or to to Jacob, but he
[1:27:20] had to wrestle it out with an angel.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:23] till he became changed.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; God's grace was with Israel. Amen. God
[1:27:33] sent them a prophet when they were in
[1:27:35] Egypt. God sent him a prophet with the
[1:27:37] message of deliverance, but they had to
[1:27:40] apply the blood.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Over the door of their house.
[1:27:49] Ain't that right?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; They had to do something. But it was
[1:27:53] grace with them.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; The message of grace, the prophet said,
[1:27:58] has been tramped under the feet of men
[1:28:00] until it's become a disgrace.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Some of them runs out into eternal
[1:28:04] security. Some runs out into well, oh,
[1:28:08] everything, but the true message of
[1:28:10] grace remains the same. And there's
[1:28:13] where Satan tries to knock it out from
[1:28:16] the church. Ain't that right?
[1:28:20] But look, Abraham obeyed God and and
[1:28:24] left most everything behind.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't fully obey God as we
[1:28:29] know. He he brought Lot with him and he
[1:28:31] brought his dad with him and and all
[1:28:33] that, but he started out.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brandham says, "But in
[1:28:39] in the journey,
[1:28:41] Abraham's journey, Abraham tested God's
[1:28:46] patience."
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:28:49] God told him, he said, "You stay in the
[1:28:51] land that I brought you into. Stay
[1:28:53] there. Don't get out of it."
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This land of promise.
[1:28:58] Don't don't don't leave it. And as soon
[1:29:01] as famine hit, Abraham runs.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; He goes into the Philistine country.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where it just seemed like
[1:29:14] everything was just smooth and going
[1:29:17] good.
[1:29:18] See, and he did exactly what God told
[1:29:22] him not to do.
[1:29:25] But the grace of God was with him.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And grace kept Pharaoh
[1:29:33] from taking uh uh Abraham's wife.
[1:29:38] Remember Abraham lied to the king about
[1:29:40] Sarah,
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; telling him it was it it's my sister.
[1:29:44] See, and yet the prophet says, "But the
[1:29:47] grace of God held him because he
[1:29:50] repented." He was willing to repent. And
[1:29:53] anybody that's willing to repent, the
[1:29:55] grace of God still goes for you.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; See, so he says God saved Abraham
[1:30:03] because of his grace, not because of his
[1:30:08] behavior.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Talking about grace now. Another place
[1:30:15] Abraham spoke of us. Amen. Uh he said
[1:30:19] God took Abraham by grace and saved him.
[1:30:23] And that's how he takes you is by grace.
[1:30:26] And you know and how do we test his
[1:30:28] patience? Today we're up, tomorrow we're
[1:30:31] down. One day we believe, the next day
[1:30:34] we're wandering. Today we're Methodists,
[1:30:37] tomorrow we're Baptist, today we believe
[1:30:39] in divine healing, you know. tomorrow
[1:30:41] this tummy ache, you know, comes and we
[1:30:44] don't know whether we believe it or not.
[1:30:46] But yet in the midst of all of that, God
[1:30:49] wants us to stay put.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Don't leave the land. But he saves us
[1:30:58] anyhow. If it wasn't the grace of God,
[1:31:02] we'd all be gone.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:31:09] we'd all be gone.
[1:31:12] God showed grace to David there in in uh
[1:31:16] 1 Chronicles 17 and 7
[1:31:21] says, "Now therefore, thus shall thou
[1:31:24] say unto my servant David, thus sayith
[1:31:26] the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the
[1:31:29] sheep coat sheep coat, even from
[1:31:32] following the sheep, that thou shouldest
[1:31:34] be ruler over my people Israel."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Think of that. It was the grace of God.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; David started out in humble beginnings
[1:31:41] and then ended up reigning as a king.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; God did that by grace.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I have been with thee
[1:31:49] wherever whethersoever thou hast walked
[1:31:51] and have cut off all thine enemies from
[1:31:54] before thee, and hath made thee a name
[1:31:57] like the name of the great men that are
[1:31:59] in the earth. Also I will adorn ordain a
[1:32:02] place for my people Israel and will
[1:32:04] plant them and they shall dwell in their
[1:32:07] place and shall be moved no more.
[1:32:10] Neither shall the children of wickedness
[1:32:12] waste them anymore as at the beginning.
[1:32:16] What is it? It's grace. Yeah,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; we know that David fell in sin and he
[1:32:22] saw Beth Sheeba
[1:32:24] uh
[1:32:26] taking a bath and he committed adultery
[1:32:29] with her as we know and she become
[1:32:31] expectant with a child and
[1:32:35] then David to try to hide that sin. He
[1:32:37] had Basheba's husband Uriah killed. He
[1:32:41] thought everything was taken care of and
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; but God saw everything that he did.
[1:32:49] God sent a prophet by the name of Nathan
[1:32:52] to David and David Nathan began to, you
[1:32:56] know, talk to to David.
[1:32:59] And he told him a parable of a rich man
[1:33:04] who had many lambs.
[1:33:06] And his neighbor by him had only one
[1:33:09] lamb, just a a poor guy, but he only had
[1:33:12] just one lamb. and and this rich man
[1:33:14] had, you know, was going to have a party
[1:33:17] and invited guests and was going to make
[1:33:19] a feast for them. And so he needed a
[1:33:23] lamb and and so instead of getting a
[1:33:26] lamb of his own, he goes to his
[1:33:27] neighbor's house and gets the only lamb
[1:33:30] that his neighbor had. And and and so a
[1:33:33] as he's telling this, Amen. uh uh you of
[1:33:37] course Nathan was speaking of David's
[1:33:40] actions and for David had 500 wives
[1:33:43] Uriah had only one and and so uh uh we
[1:33:50] we find that as as Nathan is telling
[1:33:52] this parable uh to David uh David you
[1:33:57] know he he didn't realize it was about
[1:33:59] him and and so he thought it was
[1:34:02] somebody in the kingdom he thought it
[1:34:03] was a real story and and and David
[1:34:07] passed the judgment and said, "This man,
[1:34:10] you know, is going to die and he's going
[1:34:13] to pay for it four-fold, I believe, and
[1:34:15] and all of these things." And and and so
[1:34:19] Nathan told David, he said, "David, thou
[1:34:22] art the man."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; And David said unto Nathan, he says, "I
[1:34:27] have sinned against the Lord." And
[1:34:30] Nathan said unto David, "The Lord also
[1:34:33] hath put away thy sin. Thou shalt not
[1:34:37] die." Praise God.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; David passed judgment upon his own life.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; But grace,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; God's grace spared him.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "See, watch how grace
[1:34:52] went to work right quick. The spirit
[1:34:55] struck the prophet and saved David's
[1:34:58] life." Grace, surely you'll not die, but
[1:35:02] the sword will not leave your house till
[1:35:04] it's thoroughly purged your heart, for
[1:35:07] you are that rich man.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; So, David by grace was saved from his
[1:35:11] own judgment. Ain't that right?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You see, the grace of God, it it takes
[1:35:18] grace to hold us together.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; As you know, God would told Israel, you
[1:35:25] know, he gave them a lot of things.
[1:35:27] don't commit adultery and and don't
[1:35:29] don't worship idols and if you won't do
[1:35:31] this and if you'll do this and all of
[1:35:33] these things then I will then then then
[1:35:36] I will be a god unto you. You'll be my
[1:35:39] people and and I'll do these things. And
[1:35:42] brother Brown said it's it's like a
[1:35:43] marriage between a man and a wife. And
[1:35:46] he's, you know, the the the the man
[1:35:48] says, "If you'll be a good woman, if
[1:35:50] you'll take care of the house, if you'll
[1:35:52] be true to me, if you'll keep my clothes
[1:35:54] clean, and if we have children, if
[1:35:56] you'll be a mother to them, if you'll do
[1:35:57] things uh uh do things that I'll work
[1:36:01] till my hands bleed to make you a
[1:36:03] living, if you'll do it." Ain't that
[1:36:04] right? Brother Brandham says, "But then
[1:36:06] what if that woman turns wrong and lives
[1:36:10] lazy, won't work, won't do nothing." He
[1:36:13] said, "Then it takes grace."
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; It takes grace to keep that family
[1:36:22] together.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; It took the grace of God
[1:36:30] to keep us together.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; To think the value of grace. A lot of
[1:36:39] times we take take things for granted.
[1:36:44] How many times we've griped and how many
[1:36:46] times we've complained.
[1:36:49] How many times God has done things and
[1:36:51] then you know the next trial comes and
[1:36:54] then we wondering if God's able to bring
[1:36:58] us out
[1:37:00] and yet we're still here.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; We're still serving him. Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; And what we don't know, it's grace.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; How many times that we've gone without
[1:37:18] prayer,
[1:37:20] gone without reading?
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; How many times we put our hours
[1:37:28] into other things?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Praise God.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; But the grace of God
[1:37:36] has kept us together.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; The family of God. Can you say amen?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; See, so we wouldn't be here if not for
[1:37:45] God's grace.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Now, just to to think of this and to let
[1:37:51] you go,
[1:37:53] but brother Bram said, God wants
[1:37:55] somebody that'll obey him.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:01] God wants somebody that's going to obey
[1:38:03] him. If it's not in the scriptures, if
[1:38:05] it's just man-made doctrine, not Bible
[1:38:07] doctrine. So regardless of what the
[1:38:09] church is, how wrong you've been, what
[1:38:11] difference does it make, it's it's how
[1:38:14] right you can be now. God's grace has
[1:38:17] showed it to you, then walk in it.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I thought of this and praise the Lord.
[1:38:27] I've get you got got more. But I thought
[1:38:30] of how that we read that scripture where
[1:38:33] God says, "I'll pour out the spirit of
[1:38:35] grace on the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
[1:38:39] We look at Israel and
[1:38:42] you can look in the Old Testament and
[1:38:44] see their ups and downs. Look at the
[1:38:46] book of Judges
[1:38:49] and how constantly
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; God would bring them out of bondage
[1:38:56] and then they'd go right back into it
[1:38:58] because of their disobedience.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; And then God would bring them back out
[1:39:04] and they'd serve God for a little bit,
[1:39:05] then they'd go right back into it just
[1:39:08] constantly up and down, up and down.
[1:39:11] Now, Brother Bram said, you know, now
[1:39:13] they didn't fully come into the promised
[1:39:15] land.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Uh but God never forgot Israel.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; God never forgot Israel. Their biggest
[1:39:25] failure
[1:39:26] was when they rejected Christ.
[1:39:30] They had him slain.
[1:39:32] But I thought of that. The only reason
[1:39:35] why that they crucified him is because
[1:39:38] God blinded their eyes. for us.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; We had no rights to the covenant.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; We We had no hope for mercy. We had
[1:39:50] nothing.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; But God desired a bride and he promised
[1:39:56] that he would take a bride out of the
[1:39:57] Gentiles.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Not out of Israel,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; out of the Gentiles.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; So God had to blind that natural people.
[1:40:09] Yes, he did
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; blind them
[1:40:13] to where he wasn't crucified by the
[1:40:17] Gentiles. He wasn't crucified by
[1:40:19] sinners. It was his own people that did
[1:40:22] it.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; It was Israel that crucified.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; We know the Romans nailed him to the
[1:40:29] cross or whatever, you know, through the
[1:40:31] government, but it was Israel that
[1:40:33] offered him up.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; It was Israel that said, "Crucify him."
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:39] We'll take Barabus over him.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; But they did it because they were
[1:40:43] blinded.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; For our sakes,
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; the grace of God.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; For sure.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Since that rejection, we know that it
[1:40:55] was not long after the day of Pentecost
[1:40:58] that
[1:41:00] Paul would say, "Lo, we turn to the
[1:41:02] Gentiles." And at that time grace was
[1:41:05] over for the Jews nation Israel. And
[1:41:09] Titus come in in some point and destroy
[1:41:13] Jerusalem.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Bro, tore down every stone.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Their blood. The history says that blood
[1:41:22] run in the streets like a river.
[1:41:26] It it was such a a horrible thing
[1:41:32] because the grace of God had lifted off
[1:41:34] of them people
[1:41:37] down through the years.
[1:41:40] Um, Israel has been so persecuted. The
[1:41:44] Jews have been persecuted
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; for what they have done. And even you
[1:41:49] know Martin Luther history tells us
[1:41:51] Martin Luther thought that the Jews
[1:41:53] should be killed and because of they
[1:41:56] were anti
[1:41:58] and he but he just didn't uh uh
[1:42:03] understand what what the Jews were.
[1:42:08] We, my dad, come out of a group of um
[1:42:13] people that believe that there is no
[1:42:15] hope for the Jews or at least they used
[1:42:18] to. Israel is no longer a people. It's
[1:42:20] over with and because they've rejected
[1:42:23] Israel or rejected their Messiah. We
[1:42:27] look today, we look at the Holocaust, we
[1:42:29] look at all of these things. It was a
[1:42:31] hatred toward the Jews and and you know,
[1:42:34] it's still happening. I you know it's
[1:42:36] amazing that what we're seeing rise up a
[1:42:39] hatred toward the Jews. Usually the
[1:42:41] Republicans are are people that that are
[1:42:44] for the Jews and now you're seeing
[1:42:46] Republicans rise up and these these
[1:42:48] commentators and and all this and
[1:42:50] they're turning against Israel and and
[1:42:53] they're speaking against Israel. They
[1:42:54] said, you know, that that the majority
[1:42:57] of young people, I think under 30 years
[1:42:59] old has turned against Israel is against
[1:43:01] Israel and and and and all these things.
[1:43:04] So, we see what's happening
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; and and you know, but God promised
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; that he would pour the spirit of grace
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; upon Israel.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And and they've been blinded as to who
[1:43:21] their their their uh Messiah is. that
[1:43:24] once God gives them that grace,
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; the Bible says their eyes will be open
[1:43:31] and they'll see him
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; and they will ask, "Where did you get
[1:43:35] these scars? What what happened to you?"
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I got him in the house of
[1:43:42] my friends."
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And they will mourn for days. They will
[1:43:47] lament for days because of what they've
[1:43:50] done.
[1:43:52] But I thought, "Oh, what the spirit of
[1:43:54] grace will do."
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And and and we see that grace is being
[1:44:00] lifted off of America and the Gentiles
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; to where no one seems to be having a
[1:44:08] heart of repentance anymore.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; No one seems to have this conviction
[1:44:14] hardly anymore.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's blinding.
[1:44:22] But the prophet said it, what Paul says
[1:44:25] is it's not Christ that's blinding them.
[1:44:27] It's the God of the world that's
[1:44:29] blinding them.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And they have willfully become ignorant.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And and what I'm saying tonight is that
[1:44:38] that if you having this this this
[1:44:41] uncction to keep pressing, don't take it
[1:44:44] for granted.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] If you got the conviction, if you got a
[1:44:49] love in your heart, if you got a desire
[1:44:52] to walk in truth,
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; don't don't take that for granted.
[1:44:59] That's grace.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; That's grace. Can you say amen?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; grace, God, by grace, he puts up with
[1:45:12] us, don't he?
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; By grace, he keeps us together. He's
[1:45:16] holding us. And by grace, there's going
[1:45:19] to be a rapture. Brother Brandham called
[1:45:22] it rapturing grace.
[1:45:24] It's a grace that we don't deserve, but
[1:45:27] yet God has promised it to us. And I'm
[1:45:31] so glad for that. Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that spirit of grace
[1:45:35] that he's going to pour out on onto the
[1:45:38] Jews is the same grace that's been
[1:45:42] poured out to you and I today upon the
[1:45:46] Gentiles.
[1:45:47] Thank God for grace.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God.
[1:45:56] Where would I be?
[1:46:01] God only knows.
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:06] I'm glad to see
[1:46:10] through the eyes of love.
[1:46:16] A hopeless case,
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:46:20] an empty space.
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:25] If not for grace,
[1:46:30] amazing grace,
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:34] how sweet the sound.
[1:46:39] I once was lost,
[1:46:44] but now I'm found.
[1:46:49] A hopeless case,
[1:46:53] an empty
[1:46:55] place
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] if not for grace.
[1:47:02] Oh precious Lord,
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:07] please take Do you want him to take your
[1:47:10] hand?
[1:47:11] Oh, and lead me on.
[1:47:15] [Music]
[1:47:17] And let me stand
[1:47:22] a hopeless case.
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:27] An empty space.
[1:47:31] If not
[1:47:34] to think
[1:47:36] that brother Brandon, he would call
[1:47:37] grace sovereign. It's sovereign grace.
[1:47:42] He said in order for it to be sovereign
[1:47:44] grace, it has to come from one that is
[1:47:46] sovereign.
[1:47:48] It be a sovereign one that gives it.
[1:47:54] And only God is sovereign. Ain't that
[1:47:56] right?
[1:47:59] And being that grace is sovereign.
[1:48:03] You don't have to ask
[1:48:06] can I do this or shall I do this or can
[1:48:10] I must I will I doesn't do that. It does
[1:48:14] it itself.
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:18] Grace doesn't have to get permission.
[1:48:20] That's right.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; It's sovereign.
[1:48:23] Can you say amen?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet said, "See, grace
[1:48:28] is sovereign. Therefore, he can save the
[1:48:30] vilest.
[1:48:32] He can save the worst. He can save the
[1:48:35] impurst.
[1:48:37] He can save the immoralist, the most
[1:48:41] downgraded immoral person. Grace can
[1:48:44] save.
[1:48:46] He can heal the sickest
[1:48:49] because grace is sovereign." Oh, aren't
[1:48:53] you glad for that?
[1:48:55] That's how I was picked up. That's how I
[1:48:58] was shown mercy. That's how I'm here
[1:49:00] today. Because grace is sovereign.
[1:49:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:49:07] Oh, if not for grace.
[1:49:12] Oh, amazing grace.
[1:49:15] [Applause]
[1:49:17] How sweet the sound.
[1:49:22] I once was lost,
[1:49:27] but now I'm found.
[1:49:31] I was a hopeless case,
[1:49:36] an empty place
[1:49:40] if not for grace. There is a fountain
[1:49:43] filled with blood.
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:49] There is
[1:49:51] a fountain
[1:49:54] filled
[1:49:56] with blood drawing from
[1:50:01] Emmanuel's
[1:50:03] vein
[1:50:07] and

[1:50:40] Stay.
[1:50:43] Oh, and sin
[1:50:46] whose lives beneath
[1:50:50] the flood lose all
[1:50:55] their guilty
[1:50:58] days.
[1:51:01] The dying
[1:51:04] thief
[1:51:06] rejoice
[1:51:08] to see that fountain
[1:51:13] in
[1:51:14] his day.
[1:51:19] And there
[1:51:21] may I though vow
[1:51:26] of the sea wash all
[1:51:30] my sins
[1:51:32] away.
[1:51:36] Oh wash all
[1:51:40] my sins away.
[1:51:45] wash
[1:51:46] all my sins
[1:51:50] away.
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:54] And there
[1:51:56] may I

[1:52:10] Behold thou dying
[1:52:14] lamb,
[1:52:15] thy preious
[1:52:18] blood shall never
[1:52:22] lose
[1:52:24] its power. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:52:28] Kill all
[1:52:31] the wrath.

[1:54:01] It shall
[1:54:06] bless the name of the Lord.

[1:54:42] Redeeing
[1:54:45] love

[1:54:53] be till I die.
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:55:01] Oh, isn't the Lord wonderful?
[1:55:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can we just
[1:55:06] stand to our feet? Amen. Amen.
[1:55:11] Let's just sing this little song as we
[1:55:13] get ready to close. I want to thank you,
[1:55:17] Lord, for saving my soul.
[1:55:20] Just to that little chorus.
[1:55:23] I want to thank
[1:55:26] you, Lord,
[1:55:29] for saving
[1:55:32] my soul.
[1:55:36] Thank
[1:55:38] you Lord
[1:55:40] for making
[1:55:44] me holy.
[1:55:46] Yes. Thank
[1:55:49] you Lord
[1:55:52] for giving
[1:55:55] to me
[1:55:58] thy great salvation
[1:56:03] so
[1:56:06] and free. Now as they just place
[1:56:10] softly
[1:56:12] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:56:15] prayer. We want to remember as was said,
[1:56:18] brother Jonathan,
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:21] brother Zachary, they're
[1:56:24] in a I guess a country that is Muslim,
[1:56:28] mostly Muslim.
[1:56:30] So right now it's a
[1:56:33] scary time
[1:56:35] and um but they're there to help a small
[1:56:40] church in that area. And so we really
[1:56:43] want to keep them in our prayer that God
[1:56:46] will just really protect them, guide
[1:56:48] them, bring them home safely to us and
[1:56:51] that he would help them to be able to
[1:56:54] help the people there and that nation.
[1:56:58] Amen. Remember those that maybe are sick
[1:57:00] or uh wasn't able to make it this
[1:57:03] evening. Amen. Father,
[1:57:09] you have been so good to us, Lord. We
[1:57:11] have tasted of the Lord and we can truly
[1:57:16] say he is good.
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:20] We're thankful for your grace that you
[1:57:22] have
[1:57:24] shed upon our lives. you poured upon us.
