[34:46] right
[34:49] we survived
[34:53] well we see some different faces and
[34:55] that we'll just have to start over okay
[35:02] Genesis the first chapter
[35:06] we'll just start at the first verse here
[35:10] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[35:12] and the Earth and in and the Earth was
[35:15] without form and void and darkness was
[35:17] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[35:19] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[35:22] 26 verse was saying God said let us make
[35:26] man in our image after our likeness and
[35:28] let them have dominion over the fish of
[35:30] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[35:32] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[35:34] and over every creeping thing that
[35:36] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[35:38] man in his own image in the image of God
[35:40] created he him male and female created
[35:43] he them and God saw everything that he
[35:46] had made and behold he said it was very
[35:48] good
[35:49] somebody say very good
[35:52] he saw everything that he had made
[35:54] and he said it was very good amen for
[35:57] just a few moments tonight want to speak
[35:59] on the the image will speak for itself
[36:02] amen father we love you Lord tonight we
[36:04] thank you for another opportunity to
[36:06] come and to hear from your your word
[36:08] tonight father and Lord we just ask that
[36:10] we'd be able to check our our thoughts
[36:12] Lord we'd be able to just check our
[36:14] burdens at the door father Lord and we
[36:17] just lay aside these few minutes Lord as
[36:19] we dedicate Our Lives to you one more
[36:21] time father Lord we ask that you would
[36:23] just
[36:24] Lord be in our midst tonight father
[36:27] Lord come once more in our in our midst
[36:30] father tonight Lord we don't just come
[36:32] out of tradition Lord and many have
[36:34] drove miles and
[36:36] put aside other things and obligations
[36:38] to be here tonight Lord and we don't
[36:40] want it just to be a an occasion where
[36:42] we came but Lord we want it to be a
[36:44] moment with you father
[36:46] Lord I pray that you take this word and
[36:49] make it a revelation unto us Lord make
[36:51] life to cause to come into it father and
[36:54] Lord it would come out of the pages of
[36:56] of this word and become such a such a
[36:59] tangible reality to us father that we
[37:01] could see you in your glory tonight
[37:03] father and Lord I give you all my
[37:06] strength father the Lord circumcise our
[37:08] lips and circumcise our ears father that
[37:10] we could hear from you alone father we
[37:13] give you ourselves in the name of Jesus
[37:15] Christ amen amen you may be seated
[37:17] tonight so we know this portion of
[37:19] scripture is very familiar to us that
[37:21] God created man in His image and there
[37:25] it's a hard thing to Fathom it's a hard
[37:27] thing to put your mind there that in the
[37:29] beginning
[37:31] was God
[37:32] and to go back that far in your mind to
[37:35] before there was any trial or
[37:37] circumstance or there was an earth to
[37:39] stand on there was Waters or there was
[37:41] there was something before all that
[37:43] and even before this this is where this
[37:46] is where Moses would be hearing from God
[37:48] I want you to start writing right here
[37:51] and Moses would be hearing from the
[37:54] mouth of God this is what I want you to
[37:56] transcribe this is how my book of
[37:58] generations is going to start I want you
[38:00] to start writing it right here and in
[38:01] the beginning was God because God is an
[38:04] object of worship right God is an object
[38:06] that is worshiped so before this there
[38:08] was an existence of Elohim right before
[38:10] there was a god there was uh there was a
[38:13] being there was a power that we would
[38:15] call Elohim and it is God right and then
[38:18] he put himself in an object of worship
[38:19] and in the beginning was God but before
[38:21] there was a beginning there was a
[38:23] beginning before this beginning there
[38:26] was a something there was a reality
[38:28] there was a there was there was an
[38:30] existence that never did have a
[38:31] beginning right it never where did this
[38:33] where did this object of worship come
[38:35] from but he had to have come from
[38:36] somewhere out of out of Eternity and
[38:40] placed himself in an object of worship
[38:42] that would have a name on it and it
[38:43] would have a reality to it and it would
[38:45] have something that you could you could
[38:47] relate to it but before that there was
[38:49] an existence right there was an eternal
[38:51] there so as we're as we're as we're
[38:54] looking at this thing God is creating
[38:56] creating something in his own image
[38:59] right something to pattern after himself
[39:02] and I heard Ed biscals say it like this
[39:04] one time that science tells us it took
[39:06] it takes 50 million or 300 million years
[39:08] to make the Earth to have enough salt
[39:10] and enough calcium and enough iron in it
[39:13] that life could exist and where your
[39:15] bodies could exist and there'd be food
[39:16] sources and and science tells us it took
[39:19] this long and that's fine because I
[39:20] don't care how long it took God it might
[39:22] have taken him millions or billions of
[39:24] years he's not in time he's he's
[39:26] creating in his own realm and his own
[39:28] eternity and Adam and Eve were in this
[39:31] this capsule out of time and there was
[39:33] time going on around them but yet they
[39:35] were caught out of that time in the
[39:36] garden right and things were happening
[39:38] and cosmosis were coming together and
[39:40] and things were moving into position and
[39:43] God God has this so perfectly
[39:45] orchestrated in his mind that there
[39:47] would be a place there would be a little
[39:49] a little blue dot in the middle of this
[39:51] black base and he would spend 300
[39:53] million years to to design this place
[39:56] with enough salt and enough enough
[39:58] calcium in the dirt and and all the
[40:00] layers of the earth and to have all of
[40:02] the right elements that if we were just
[40:04] a few degrees off we'd burn up but we
[40:06] were a few degrees that way we'd be too
[40:07] cold and you know but just have
[40:09] something right in the middle just right
[40:11] in Perfection and I heard brother Ed say
[40:13] it like this if God spent hundreds of
[40:15] millions of years designing a place that
[40:17] we're going to spend 75 years on how
[40:19] much time did he spend on you
[40:22] how much time did he spend designing you
[40:24] that would be the image of his creation
[40:26] this is just a place that we're going to
[40:28] spend a few minutes on and he put all
[40:31] that time into that how much time did he
[40:33] spend on you the apple of his eye the
[40:36] image of his creation and God created
[40:38] man in his own image and he looked at
[40:40] the man and he said it's very good I
[40:43] like what I've made I like what I see
[40:45] it's very good I like this here I I like
[40:49] that I've made something that looks like
[40:51] me and you think about yourself and you
[40:53] think well I'm nothing like God but God
[40:55] looked at you and he said what I have
[40:58] made it is very good now to think about
[41:01] the artist's expression of this now I'm
[41:03] not an artist by by any means I can
[41:05] barely draw just a stick figure or
[41:07] something like that it's just not how my
[41:08] I can't get this to transfer to this and
[41:11] I can maybe see something but I can't
[41:13] get the shadowing there and it comes out
[41:14] looking you know what is this but
[41:17] there's how many artists are in the
[41:18] building how many draws or paints or
[41:19] okay so you have an artistic mind right
[41:22] now now being an artist is kind of a
[41:24] vulnerable thing right
[41:27] because you're exposing what's on the
[41:28] inside of you
[41:30] you are portraying a thought
[41:33] now that artist will take a canvas and
[41:35] she'll take some paint and some brushes
[41:37] and there'll be an empty canvas there
[41:38] let's just say this acoustic board was
[41:40] an empty canvas and you're sitting there
[41:42] with painting that now you know if you
[41:43] give me paint you're going to end up
[41:45] with some stick figures and some crew
[41:46] drawings but if you give her paint and a
[41:49] paintbrush she's going to create a
[41:51] thought that she already sees within her
[41:53] mind she already sees that there's going
[41:56] to be a flower pot there and the flower
[41:57] is going to be yellow and it's going to
[41:58] have this red outline and it's going to
[42:00] have to be on this Terrace and there's
[42:01] going to be the ocean view out behind
[42:03] the you see there's this whole view of a
[42:05] picture in her mind that she's going to
[42:07] create on this canvas it's the thought
[42:10] of the artist right so if we can look at
[42:12] maybe the Mona Lisa picture right I
[42:14] think it was Da Vinci that painted that
[42:15] and that was something that was in the
[42:17] mind of Da Vinci that he would put onto
[42:19] canvas right he saw a lady and she would
[42:21] look just like that and she would she
[42:23] would have just this characteristic and
[42:24] she would have this This Magnificent
[42:27] stare and he wouldn't settle or he
[42:29] wouldn't stop until it got to to that
[42:32] what he saw in his mind God
[42:34] didn't just throw some paint on the wall
[42:36] and say good enough but he wouldn't
[42:38] settle until he got to the Perfection of
[42:41] what was in his mind the thought that
[42:43] was in the back part of his mind he
[42:45] would have to work in labor until that
[42:47] would come into a reality that he could
[42:49] see it and he could behold it he could
[42:51] stand back and say there's my creation I
[42:54] imagine Da Vinci did all that work and
[42:56] he took a step back from the Mona Lisa
[42:58] and he said there's my work there's my
[43:01] creation and you know what he did when
[43:02] he got finished with it he signed it he
[43:05] put his signature on the bottom of it
[43:07] and he said I'll put my name next to
[43:09] this this is the this is the reality of
[43:11] my thought now God is the great artist
[43:14] and he's not just throwing paint on a
[43:16] campus he's not just throwing life out
[43:18] there but he is a he's the great artist
[43:20] portraying what is in his mind right we
[43:23] went over that this morning at the
[43:25] prophet of God pulled the thoughts out
[43:27] of the heart of God and brought him into
[43:29] view and now we see them in plain view
[43:31] once we beheld them Darkly as shadows
[43:33] and figures but now we can see them in
[43:36] plain sight
[43:37] I'm looking at the expressed attributes
[43:40] of God the thoughts of God that were in
[43:42] the back part of his mind but now
[43:43] they've been cast into the Earth in this
[43:46] age for this time for a purpose and God
[43:49] had designed this and he looked at it
[43:51] and he takes a step back and he said
[43:53] what I've created it's very good I like
[43:56] that it's very good now if God has put a
[43:58] stamp on you that you're very good I
[44:00] just take what God says about you I
[44:02] would just take this word and say
[44:03] despite what I think or despite what I
[44:05] look like in the mirror this morning God
[44:07] has already said I am very good he has
[44:10] created me in his own image and I'll
[44:13] settle for that I'm not gonna just I'm
[44:15] not just gonna take it at face value but
[44:17] I'm going to recognize there's an
[44:18] eternal work in here
[44:20] now it would be something for the Mona
[44:22] Lisa to look back at Da Vinci and be
[44:24] upset with how he painted her
[44:26] well I wish you would have made me like
[44:27] this
[44:28] or I wish you would have made me just
[44:30] this color hair or that or this color
[44:32] eyes or I wish that I would have had a
[44:34] smaller nose or I wish that and can you
[44:36] imagine this this this piece of art
[44:38] speaking back to the artist upset with
[44:41] how the artist has drawn you but it was
[44:43] created in the mind of the artist I
[44:45] wonder what Mona Lisa would say if she
[44:47] could speak
[44:49] but she was trapped in the mind of Da
[44:51] Vinci until he got paint brother will
[44:54] and he began to go to work
[44:56] and she began to get released
[45:00] if she could speak what would she say to
[45:02] him
[45:04] you might not think that you're a great
[45:06] piece of clay to work with
[45:09] but God's the great artist
[45:11] and he's got a vision of what he wants
[45:13] to see in the end he's got a vision of
[45:16] of what's in the it's it's already a
[45:18] thought in his mind and he's not just
[45:20] gonna stop if we're good enough but he's
[45:23] going to work and he's going to labor
[45:25] and he's going to chip away until he
[45:27] gets the Perfection that he's looking
[45:30] for
[45:31] Hallelujah he's not going to stop short
[45:34] but he's going to go all the way until
[45:36] he gets that Perfection and John 1 would
[45:38] say this
[45:39] in the beginning was the word
[45:41] and the Word was with God and the Word
[45:44] was God and the 12 verse would say but
[45:47] as many as received him to them he gave
[45:50] he power to become the sons of God even
[45:53] to them that believe on his name which
[45:55] were born not of blood nor of the will
[45:57] of the flesh nor of the will of man but
[45:59] of God
[46:00] they were born of God
[46:04] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[46:07] among us and we beheld his glory and the
[46:09] glory as of the only begotten of the
[46:11] father full of grace and truth the word
[46:14] became flesh and he caused his word to
[46:18] come into a flesh body and he looked at
[46:19] that creation he said it is very good
[46:22] but they were not born of blood or of
[46:24] water or of man or of dad or a mom but
[46:27] they were born of God so you really
[46:29] didn't come from your Earthly parents or
[46:31] your parents might have been named David
[46:33] or Bob or Jim and it really doesn't
[46:35] matter but you didn't really come from
[46:36] him you came from another father and you
[46:39] came from another genealogy where this
[46:42] genealogy it does not have a right over
[46:44] that one because that one was there
[46:46] first does that make sense right you
[46:48] were a child of God before you were ever
[46:49] a child of Chris long or you were ever a
[46:51] child of of Matt McLaren you were you
[46:54] were already a child of God before you
[46:56] ever were that child so that trumps this
[46:58] genealogy is that right you were already
[47:01] the expression of that
[47:03] God didn't just watch over your your
[47:05] your your recent heritage
[47:08] to watch over your grandma and your
[47:10] grandpa and your great grandpa think
[47:11] about all the connections that came
[47:13] together to make you who you are and we
[47:16] want to look back at the artist the the
[47:18] that painted us and say well I wish you
[47:21] didn't make me that way I wish I didn't
[47:23] have this this year I wish I didn't have
[47:24] this but he knows what he's doing and
[47:27] he's put everything in our life for a
[47:29] purpose and he's causing us to come to
[47:31] this point where the image can speak
[47:34] what what he put inside of it the image
[47:37] will speak for itself the image has a
[47:40] voice right now I sent the brother some
[47:42] pictures here I don't want to take too
[47:44] long so we'll we'll try to go through
[47:45] this but I sent him a picture here if
[47:47] they can get it up and in in in in in in
[47:50] in uh in uh in reality since I look at
[47:53] this and I think that that just looks
[47:54] like work
[47:57] I mean I'm in construction right so I
[48:00] know that this shows up on the job site
[48:01] I've got to get it somewhere I've got to
[48:03] move it
[48:04] and it just looks like work I need some
[48:07] piano dollies I need some I need a crane
[48:09] I need something I need to get this from
[48:11] A to B and it just looks like work to me
[48:12] but if you put this in the hands of the
[48:14] right person it's it's it's a
[48:17] masterpiece
[48:18] if you put this this block of granite in
[48:21] the hands of the right person it's a
[48:23] masterpiece but you put it in the hands
[48:25] of me or anybody else that doesn't have
[48:26] a vision for it and they'll destroy it
[48:28] they'll just they'll ruin it it'll just
[48:30] become a coffee table somewhere that's
[48:31] really heavy it'll never have a purpose
[48:33] but if you put that in the hands of
[48:35] somebody that can use it then they can
[48:38] release the potential that's already in
[48:40] it right so give me the next slide there
[48:42] brother this came from that
[48:44] this came from that same Stone now I did
[48:47] not did you see that when you saw that
[48:49] block there I didn't see that
[48:52] I just saw work but if you put that
[48:54] block in the hands of the right person
[48:56] this is what will come out of it because
[48:58] it's in the hand of the master they know
[49:01] how to get the value of what's already
[49:03] in there that was in that block the
[49:05] whole time Michelangelo made this Moses
[49:07] over years of his life and he said his
[49:11] famous quote was this was Moses was in
[49:13] the block I just needed to release him I
[49:16] just had to let him out
[49:19] a a free child of God is already in your
[49:22] clay you've just gotta get in the right
[49:25] hands of the master that knows how to
[49:27] activate it that can open it up and say
[49:29] I see the value within you it doesn't
[49:31] matter what I see or what he sees or
[49:34] what he sees but God sees the value
[49:35] within you that nobody else can see and
[49:38] he knows how to get the value out of his
[49:41] creation he knows the the elements that
[49:43] it takes and the situations that drove
[49:46] you here and the heartaches that you had
[49:48] to go through and the questions that you
[49:50] battled in your mind and the defeats
[49:52] that you've had to go how else would you
[49:53] be in this room tonight but God Almighty
[49:55] has created a way for you to express the
[49:59] value that's on the inside of you he
[50:01] knows what you look like on the inside
[50:03] because you're the thought of his
[50:05] expression he knows what he has thought
[50:07] of in his mind and he's not going to
[50:09] stop until it comes into full
[50:11] expectation of the way he saw it he's
[50:15] not going to just settle for good enough
[50:16] and you think God I can't go through
[50:18] another trial he's not going to settle
[50:20] for good enough he's got to have have a
[50:23] perfect work that he could take a step
[50:25] back and he could say what I've done is
[50:27] very good I see it and it's very good
[50:29] now to think about this that
[50:31] Michelangelo would take this block and
[50:33] he would go to work with a hammer and a
[50:34] chisel
[50:36] he began to work away on that because he
[50:38] would see something in there and Moses
[50:40] is sitting like this and he's holding
[50:42] the the Commandments and he's looking
[50:44] just this way and he would take the time
[50:46] and you imagine
[50:49] all of the effort that would go into
[50:51] that years and years and years and years
[50:54] and years
[50:55] and years
[50:57] brother Kevin years
[50:59] to master an art
[51:02] but he saw it
[51:04] he saw what it could be and he knew the
[51:08] potential that was laying within that
[51:10] block and he wasn't just going to stop
[51:12] for good enough he wasn't going to have
[51:13] it turned into a coffee table somewhere
[51:15] but he knew the value that was already
[51:18] within there and he just had to go to
[51:20] work on it now what if Moses the statue
[51:23] could speak
[51:24] what if he could talk do you think he
[51:25] would have said ow
[51:29] I mean he's getting whacked with a
[51:30] chisel and a hammer for 20 years
[51:34] if he could talk
[51:35] I imagine you say ow
[51:38] ouch ouch ouch now think about how big
[51:40] that block was and what's left all that
[51:42] came out of one block so what's left out
[51:44] of that block not much all that's left
[51:47] is the perfect vision of what the artist
[51:49] saw he's not there's no fluff left in
[51:51] there there's no world left in there
[51:53] there's there's no Humanity left in
[51:55] there but all that's left is what the
[51:57] artist saw in his mind and that's what
[52:00] he's going to strive for that's what
[52:02] he's going for because he knows what you
[52:04] can hold he knows the value that's on
[52:06] the inside of you and you might not ever
[52:08] receive that value from anybody else
[52:10] your Daddy might have never said he
[52:12] loved you or he might have ever cared
[52:14] for you but there's a value within there
[52:15] that God Alone can see and he is going
[52:18] to refine you and refine you and refine
[52:21] you until that value comes out and it's
[52:24] in plain view that value will show
[52:26] itself God will not settle until his
[52:29] word comes full
[52:33] such attention to detail
[52:36] that's not just thrown you into this age
[52:38] of laodicea just hoping that you make it
[52:40] out but he's Pace if he can pay so much
[52:42] attention to detail that he could have
[52:44] an entire ecosystem
[52:46] for a place that you're going to spend a
[52:47] few years
[52:49] how much did he spend on you
[52:52] you're not just here by chance
[52:54] so if Michelangelo a man that we don't
[52:56] even know if he had a real relationship
[52:58] with the Lord but somehow he had a
[53:00] god-given gift as an artist to portray a
[53:02] masterpiece to put a masterpiece on
[53:05] display would take the time to take that
[53:07] much attention to detail that he's
[53:10] showing us something here that God is a
[53:12] god of detail God is a God that knows
[53:15] every end from the out he knows every
[53:17] thought that's in your mind he knows
[53:19] every direction you would have gone he
[53:20] knows every mistake you would have made
[53:22] he knows everything you've been through
[53:23] but yet even through all those mistakes
[53:25] he looks at his creation and he says
[53:28] it's very good he says I like what I've
[53:30] done it's very very good
[53:34] give me that next slide brother
[53:36] you see this picture here maybe some of
[53:38] you know this and have seen this but I
[53:40] thought this was pretty special so the
[53:41] arrow there is pointing at this tendon
[53:43] in in the in the statue's arm and this
[53:46] tendon is flexed because the pinky uh
[53:49] finger is moved in like that and when
[53:50] you do that your your tendon moves in
[53:52] your arm
[53:54] that tendon flexes when you move that
[53:56] finger so the artist's attention to
[53:57] detail was so great that when when he
[54:00] said it's got to look just that way and
[54:01] if you can see this without a blurry
[54:03] picture there maybe you could see in
[54:04] real life sometime and see the intricate
[54:06] work of the veins and and almost the
[54:09] real-like texture of the skin now he did
[54:11] this out of that block that I showed you
[54:13] the same block but had such attention to
[54:17] detail that he knew that when this pinky
[54:19] moves this tendon moves and it's got to
[54:21] be so lifelike it's got to be so real
[54:24] I'm not just gonna settle for an arm
[54:26] I've got to have a super detailed arm
[54:28] now look at the muscle shape in that arm
[54:30] now this was just a man with a chisel
[54:32] and think about if a man with a chisel
[54:34] can do that how much could God Almighty
[54:36] with every resource imaginable available
[54:39] could go to work on you to make sure
[54:42] that you come out the perfect work that
[54:45] he saw in his mind this is the
[54:46] expression of an artist right you're
[54:49] seeing Michelangelo's thought on display
[54:51] here and I am seeing God's thought on
[54:54] display here he's not just throwing you
[54:56] into this world with no hell but he's
[54:58] designed everything perfectly that you
[55:01] can come out with the maximum value
[55:03] which is within you and there's nothing
[55:05] higher than to be a child of God
[55:08] who has more Authority in heaven
[55:12] child of God there's no higher Authority
[55:15] in the land and to be the design thought
[55:17] of God cast into this age and thoughts
[55:20] begin to come out of that Elohim mind
[55:23] and thoughts begin to come into creation
[55:25] and and he would say I need thoughts for
[55:27] this for this age and I need thoughts
[55:29] for the martyrs age where they would be
[55:30] able to have an anointing so strong that
[55:32] they would be able to watch their
[55:34] children killed in front of them and
[55:35] they would walk into a lion's den and
[55:37] they would burn it at a stake and they
[55:39] would do all but but they would profess
[55:41] Christianity in the Lord Jesus Christ as
[55:43] their savior above all I need some
[55:46] thoughts there and he began to think of
[55:47] these individuals that would come out
[55:49] and they would spawn out of the the mind
[55:51] of Elohim before the beginning
[55:54] I have a I have a thought of a man who
[55:57] would come up in the systems of religion
[55:58] he will learn nine languages he will be
[56:00] such a such a walking Pharisee but yet
[56:03] I'll strike him off his horse and he'll
[56:05] come down into humility and he'll come
[56:07] the way of the beggar you know come the
[56:09] way of the of the mud dauber and he'll
[56:11] come under the religion that nobody
[56:13] thought was worth anything and he
[56:15] thought of Paul in his mind the thought
[56:17] of Paul began to come out from the ages
[56:20] great he had a thought for every age and
[56:24] he's had a thought for this age I need
[56:26] some people who will come into the
[56:28] darkest age that there's ever been in
[56:30] the darkest hour when it seems like
[56:31] there's no hope and there's no living
[56:33] God and everybody's forsaking him and
[56:36] everybody's walked away but there will
[56:38] be a people that will be in that time
[56:40] that will be the Fulfillment of what
[56:42] I've seen in my mind and we begin to
[56:44] come out of the mind of Elohim back in
[56:47] the eternities back in the mind of God
[56:49] that's why we don't feel like we had any
[56:51] beginning or we don't have any and we're
[56:52] not supposed to fit in here
[56:54] we're not supposed to fit in with the
[56:56] Walmarts we were made before before
[56:59] there ever was we've just got to come to
[57:01] a place of remembrance to remember who
[57:04] we really are it takes some trials to
[57:07] remember who you are it takes some
[57:09] struggles to remember who you really are
[57:11] we could turn to the Book of Job and
[57:13] read it all the way through and we see
[57:15] that it by that job remembered all right
[57:18] amen right it wasn't just for no purpose
[57:21] job was already a godly man have you
[57:25] considered my servant job have you
[57:27] considered job and he was Godly enough
[57:29] that God would Point him out by name and
[57:30] say look at job's life you can't touch
[57:33] it because there's a seed in there
[57:34] there's a gene seed in there and I know
[57:37] the value that's within job and he
[57:39] caused the devil to go to work on job
[57:41] and take the hammer in the Chisel and
[57:44] begin to carve away job and begin to
[57:46] Define job's life out but they he God
[57:49] knew the value that was in job and he
[57:51] said go to work on job do anything but
[57:54] take his life
[57:55] and he took he took children he took
[57:57] lands he took riches he took his health
[58:00] he took everything that he could touch
[58:01] except for his life but it was all to
[58:04] bring Perfection to job
[58:08] and what did it cause job to do where
[58:10] were you job where were you before the
[58:13] beginning before in the beginning was
[58:15] God where were you before that and job
[58:18] had an Amnesia check and he come back to
[58:20] reality that was within him and said I
[58:23] remember where I was I remember who I
[58:25] was I remember that I wasn't always this
[58:28] way I remember that I'd always walk and
[58:30] defeat and walk and woe with me I
[58:32] remember I was in Victory and I'm going
[58:34] back there
[58:35] hey job had a had a memory check
[58:39] and it was by the hand of the master
[58:41] that put him under the fire that took
[58:44] off everything but the image
[58:47] he's not going to stop short of the
[58:49] perfect image and when it came time for
[58:52] job to speak back to the artist he said
[58:55] I was there I was there when the morning
[58:58] star sang in the sons of God shouted for
[59:00] Glory I was there he had a he had a
[59:03] memory
[59:05] come back into him
[59:07] all things in remembrance to realize
[59:09] that we didn't just come here we're not
[59:10] just spending 70 or 80 or 90 years here
[59:13] but we came here to be the expressed
[59:15] image of God
[59:18] he saw the value in you
[59:21] when you didn't feel like there was any
[59:23] value in you he saw the reality in you
[59:25] when you you didn't feel like you didn't
[59:28] feel like it was you
[59:32] he says watch carefully now before there
[59:34] ever was a speck of Stardust before God
[59:36] was God
[59:38] and he was known only as an eternal
[59:40] spirit the bride was already
[59:43] somebody say already
[59:45] in his mind yes she was she was existing
[59:48] in his thoughts and what about those
[59:50] thoughts of God they're Eternal are they
[59:52] not
[59:53] that's what he's asking his church and
[59:55] then he asks them again the Eternal
[59:56] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[59:58] thoughts of God Eternal remember I
[1:00:01] quoted this this morning if you can see
[1:00:02] this you will see many things God is
[1:00:07] unchangeable in both Essence and
[1:00:08] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:00:10] that already God is infinite in his
[1:00:12] ability so therefore he as God must be
[1:00:15] omniscient
[1:00:16] he if he is omniscient he is not now
[1:00:18] learning nor is he taking counsel even
[1:00:20] within himself nor is it anytime adding
[1:00:22] knowledge if he can add knowledge then
[1:00:24] he's not omniscient
[1:00:27] he has never had a new thought about
[1:00:30] anything
[1:00:32] that's preaching material buddy he's
[1:00:34] never had a new thought you're not a new
[1:00:37] thought God you've always been a part of
[1:00:39] God you've always been an offspring of
[1:00:42] God you've always been in the mind of
[1:00:43] God you've always been in the heart of
[1:00:45] God even when you didn't realize it you
[1:00:47] were there
[1:00:48] he has always had and always will have
[1:00:51] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:00:53] because he is God thus the thoughts of
[1:00:55] God are Eternal and they are real not
[1:00:58] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:01:00] blueprint he has drawn up in which one
[1:01:01] day you'll be translated into substance
[1:01:03] form but they are already real
[1:01:07] already real
[1:01:09] you're unborn children already real
[1:01:12] there are already real thoughts before
[1:01:13] you ever stepped afoot on this Earth you
[1:01:16] were already real in the mind of God you
[1:01:19] already came from behind that David
[1:01:20] would pick this up and say for thou Hast
[1:01:22] possessed my Reigns thou has covered me
[1:01:25] in my mother's womb I will praise thee
[1:01:26] for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:01:28] marvelous are thy works and that thy
[1:01:30] Soul knoweth right well my substance was
[1:01:32] not hid from thee when I was made in
[1:01:34] secret and curiously wrought in the
[1:01:36] lowest parts of the year if that eyes
[1:01:38] did see my substance yet being unperfect
[1:01:40] and in that book where all my members
[1:01:42] were written which in continuance were
[1:01:44] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:01:46] them how precious also are they thoughts
[1:01:49] unto me oh God how great is the sum of
[1:01:51] them if I should count them they are
[1:01:53] more in number than the sand when I
[1:01:55] awake I'm still with thee
[1:01:58] the Amplified would break this down and
[1:02:00] say in the depths of the earth your eyes
[1:02:02] have seen my unformed substance
[1:02:07] he already saw you
[1:02:09] before you ever came into this being you
[1:02:12] already were and if you can establish
[1:02:15] this brother Brown said if you can see
[1:02:16] this
[1:02:18] if you can see that you didn't just come
[1:02:20] into this body here for this moment in
[1:02:22] time but if you can see that you always
[1:02:24] were then you can see that you always
[1:02:26] will be if you can see that Revelation
[1:02:29] to know that I didn't just come in here
[1:02:31] but I've always been here
[1:02:33] we're just in the development stage of
[1:02:35] this
[1:02:36] how many knows what a dark room is
[1:02:39] right okay I don't I'm not an expert
[1:02:41] here but I think this is how it works
[1:02:43] Daniel
[1:02:44] so somebody takes this picture now we
[1:02:46] live in the age of instinct right where
[1:02:47] they can take a picture on the phone
[1:02:48] they can look at no I don't like that
[1:02:50] one take another one no I don't know but
[1:02:52] back in the day when they when they
[1:02:53] would first take the pictures you didn't
[1:02:55] know if you were smiling blinking you
[1:02:57] didn't know if you were staring at a
[1:02:58] bird you didn't know anything until that
[1:02:59] picture was developed it took time to
[1:03:02] develop the picture and the only one who
[1:03:05] knew what the picture looked like was
[1:03:06] the one who took it and they used to get
[1:03:09] underneath this big thing you know
[1:03:11] umbrella thing and they get in there and
[1:03:12] they boom and the light bulb would flash
[1:03:14] and it would take a picture and
[1:03:15] everybody would be stunned exactly
[1:03:17] Frozen in Time where they were and that
[1:03:19] image would strike the magnetic film and
[1:03:21] it would cast that light there right I
[1:03:23] believe that's how it works and then
[1:03:24] they would take that magnetic film into
[1:03:25] a dark room right they couldn't expose
[1:03:27] it to any light because all that light
[1:03:29] would just saturate the image that was
[1:03:30] already on there right and they would
[1:03:32] have to take it in there and they would
[1:03:34] have to bring it into a dark room now
[1:03:35] the way a dark room works is you can't
[1:03:37] have one of these lights in there but
[1:03:38] you can only have a red light and that
[1:03:40] red light will not over saturate the
[1:03:42] picture but it will bring it to its
[1:03:44] development so you can see what you're
[1:03:45] doing in there and the way I understand
[1:03:47] it is there's three different tubs of
[1:03:49] chemicals that the way this dark room
[1:03:50] works right and you put it in the first
[1:03:52] one
[1:03:53] and it brings it to resolution right
[1:03:55] and you put it in the second one and it
[1:03:57] it really brings the clarity what's on
[1:04:00] the on the image there and the third one
[1:04:02] seals the image there so then after that
[1:04:04] seal is dry you can turn on the light is
[1:04:06] that right I think that's how it works
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] it's close I know it's I know it's three
[1:04:13] elements I'm pretty sure that's how they
[1:04:15] work right so you take the first one and
[1:04:18] you put it into and you put it into
[1:04:20] justification
[1:04:21] and you and you work on it until it
[1:04:23] begins to express the image of what's on
[1:04:25] that paper and it begins to come out and
[1:04:28] take away all this and all that and it
[1:04:29] begins to take away all the outside and
[1:04:31] it begins to let that image come into
[1:04:33] fold you there and the only way that
[1:04:35] that artist can check what's on the
[1:04:37] picture is to hold it up to the red
[1:04:39] light and let the blood show it what's
[1:04:41] going on in the development process and
[1:04:44] it holds it up to the blood and it says
[1:04:45] yeah I like the way that's coming out
[1:04:47] but I need to wash it a little more
[1:04:48] sometimes just gotta get washed a little
[1:04:51] more because we're not going to settle
[1:04:52] for good enough
[1:04:53] but brother Branham told us that God
[1:04:56] took a perfect picture of you before the
[1:04:59] foundation of the world now I used to
[1:05:01] worry about this and think well when I'm
[1:05:03] 19 I've got to have abs and I've got to
[1:05:05] be in shape because that's going to be
[1:05:07] my Eternal Body but God didn't take a
[1:05:09] picture of you at 19 here on Earth
[1:05:10] because at 19 I already had scars on my
[1:05:13] hands I already had I was already
[1:05:14] balding I was already you know it didn't
[1:05:16] take a picture of you here at that age
[1:05:19] she took a picture of you in perfection
[1:05:21] in the back part of his mind and that's
[1:05:24] what he's carving away to achieve he
[1:05:27] sees the image he knows what it's
[1:05:29] supposed to look like he knows the value
[1:05:31] of it and he's not making you go through
[1:05:33] these trials in vain but he is not
[1:05:35] stopping until Perfection strikes Glory
[1:05:40] thank you that's why Peter said we're
[1:05:42] thankful for the trials we're thankful
[1:05:44] for this because it's through this he
[1:05:46] worketh Perfection he's working
[1:05:48] perfection in your life and he's dunking
[1:05:51] you in the tank and you think I don't
[1:05:52] want to go back
[1:05:54] yeah he's not gonna stop short of
[1:05:57] perfection and he holds that image up to
[1:06:00] the blood and says yeah it's coming
[1:06:01] along nicely and the Holy Ghost reports
[1:06:04] back and says yeah they're coming along
[1:06:05] nicely I think it'll come out to the
[1:06:07] perfect image that you saw in them ah
[1:06:10] maybe maybe not everybody saw it and the
[1:06:12] preacher didn't see it in the and the
[1:06:13] Evangelist didn't seen your mom didn't
[1:06:15] see it and your daddy didn't see it but
[1:06:16] God saw something within you
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] he saw a value within you that that
[1:06:24] didn't just show up one day but he put
[1:06:27] it there because you were a thought of
[1:06:28] his before there ever was an earth to
[1:06:31] stand on before there ever was a a trial
[1:06:33] before there ever was a circumstance a
[1:06:35] sickness a cold a birth you were there
[1:06:41] if you can see this
[1:06:44] you'll see many things that's right
[1:06:47] I was there
[1:06:50] we've just got to remember where we came
[1:06:52] from
[1:06:54] and we're all in different stages of
[1:06:55] this development some in this first tank
[1:06:58] some in the second tank
[1:07:01] but they don't put you in the third tank
[1:07:03] until you're ready
[1:07:06] to be sealed
[1:07:10] you don't get put in that last tank
[1:07:12] until you're done in the first two
[1:07:15] and then when he puts you in the sealer
[1:07:16] that's the finished work that's the
[1:07:18] finished product and as that sealer
[1:07:20] begins to dry on there and he holds it
[1:07:21] up yeah everything's checking out nice
[1:07:23] all the imperfections are gone I've got
[1:07:25] all the all the fading out of there I've
[1:07:27] got all the shadowing out of there I've
[1:07:29] got everything at the resolution is
[1:07:30] perfect on this and he puts it in the
[1:07:32] sealer to sign off on it the last thing
[1:07:35] that the artist does is sign it
[1:07:41] it's wearing my name
[1:07:43] it's got my brand
[1:07:45] it's wearing my signature my reputation
[1:07:48] is in that picture an artist doesn't
[1:07:51] just sign any work but he's only signing
[1:07:53] that which he's proud of and he's come
[1:07:55] down in this age and he is signed off on
[1:07:58] this church to say this is the finishing
[1:08:00] Church these are the ones that will take
[1:08:03] what I've said and they will take it all
[1:08:05] the way and they will overcome by the
[1:08:08] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[1:08:10] testimony hey somebody say they they
[1:08:12] will overcome
[1:08:15] we've already overcome the mind of God
[1:08:18] we already are victorious in the mind of
[1:08:20] God we're just going through the
[1:08:22] development stage of this and we have a
[1:08:25] voice to this right the whole thing
[1:08:26] about Michelangelo made him famous is
[1:08:28] after he spent all that time on that he
[1:08:31] was so he thought there would be he
[1:08:32] thought there would be a life in there
[1:08:34] he spent so much of his lifetime
[1:08:36] creating that image he said this thing
[1:08:38] should be alive this should be Moses he
[1:08:42] should speak and he said speak speak and
[1:08:45] he got so welled up with him he struck
[1:08:47] it with his hammer
[1:08:49] speak
[1:08:50] if the image could speak
[1:08:53] what would Moses have said
[1:08:56] oh my
[1:08:57] I was once with no value I was once
[1:09:01] stuck in a block I was once just a
[1:09:03] granted piece in the middle of nowhere
[1:09:05] nothing to me no name no value I was
[1:09:08] just an Abram Idol worshiping somewhere
[1:09:11] I was just another somebody out there
[1:09:13] somewhere but when the master went to
[1:09:15] work on me
[1:09:17] when the master touched me everything
[1:09:20] became different my mentality became
[1:09:23] different my thinking became different
[1:09:25] my goals became different my vision
[1:09:27] became different everything about me
[1:09:30] changed why because I was touched by the
[1:09:33] master who knew the value that was
[1:09:34] Within Me
[1:09:36] he took something unlovable and loved it
[1:09:40] he took something ugly and made it
[1:09:42] beautiful he took something broken and
[1:09:44] restored it if you could see me where I
[1:09:46] was and see how the master came down to
[1:09:49] me
[1:09:52] he sees the value within you church he
[1:09:55] knows what's on the inside he knows what
[1:09:58] you're capable of
[1:09:59] anybody in here in management and work
[1:10:01] have you ever been any kind of boss or
[1:10:03] management position sometimes an
[1:10:05] individual comes to work for you and you
[1:10:07] know there's some something more than
[1:10:09] what they're giving you know that
[1:10:11] there's something more inside that
[1:10:13] person than what they're doing it
[1:10:14] frustrates you because you know it and
[1:10:16] they're just being lazy or they're not
[1:10:17] aware of how talented they are and so as
[1:10:20] they're as their manager or boss you try
[1:10:22] to force them
[1:10:24] then why are you being mean to me
[1:10:25] because
[1:10:26] potential I see the value on the inside
[1:10:30] if you would just get dedicated to this
[1:10:32] and if you would just give it your all
[1:10:33] you could be the greatest master of this
[1:10:35] craft
[1:10:37] because you see the value in there
[1:10:39] brother Kevin and be like somebody
[1:10:41] coming to you and how can you teach them
[1:10:42] how to play the guitar and instantly
[1:10:44] they're just shredding the chords you
[1:10:46] think man the potential in there
[1:10:49] but then they come and they haven't
[1:10:50] practiced once since the last time they
[1:10:52] came and visited you and it frustrates
[1:10:54] you you're like why aren't you
[1:10:55] practicing you've got the talent you've
[1:10:58] got the gift you've just got to work it
[1:11:02] so I as a preacher feel coming into the
[1:11:04] house of God and seeing potential
[1:11:06] potential potential potential potential
[1:11:09] potential potential and all we've got to
[1:11:11] do is apply all that we are and come
[1:11:14] into this fully and we will be
[1:11:16] underneath the hands of the master and
[1:11:19] he will take us from what we were into
[1:11:21] what he wants us to be the Perfection of
[1:11:24] that picture our whole goal in this is
[1:11:26] to get back to that picture of what he
[1:11:28] took of us before there ever was a sin
[1:11:30] or a scar or a wrinkle or an upset
[1:11:33] there's a picture of you
[1:11:39] but what's happened is
[1:11:42] you imagine if somebody broke into the
[1:11:45] to the Louvre or wherever they've got
[1:11:46] the Mona Lisa and spray painted over it
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:52] and you walk in there and you've taken
[1:11:54] your life savings to go on vacation to
[1:11:56] Perry and you walk in there and there's
[1:11:58] there's the the art piece you wanted to
[1:12:00] see and it's got spray paint all over it
[1:12:04] well who would do that
[1:12:06] somebody that was trying to devalue
[1:12:09] what was there exactly
[1:12:14] you know the funny thing about spray
[1:12:15] paint is
[1:12:17] it washes off
[1:12:19] if you spray paint over an oil picture
[1:12:22] it'll just wipe right off but that oil
[1:12:24] base
[1:12:26] that perfect picture was was there
[1:12:29] before
[1:12:31] there was any graffiti written over this
[1:12:33] there was an original picture before
[1:12:36] graffiti was sprayed all over this there
[1:12:37] was an original message before men got a
[1:12:39] hold of it and began to spray paint
[1:12:41] their own Doctrine and their own ideas
[1:12:43] and their own Theology and they begin to
[1:12:45] take this rattle can and go to work on
[1:12:47] the message but underneath that there's
[1:12:49] an original message that is Untouched by
[1:12:52] man that has just been covered with some
[1:12:54] temporary writing and I think it's time
[1:12:56] we take the blood and we begin to wash
[1:12:59] off what somebody has painted over our
[1:13:01] life to say we're this or we're that or
[1:13:03] we're never going to be this or we're
[1:13:04] never going to be that I say it's time
[1:13:06] you duck the hot sip in the blood and
[1:13:08] begin to wash your picture clean and say
[1:13:11] I want to be restored back to where I
[1:13:14] was before there ever was an upset in
[1:13:16] this life I'm going back Beyond this
[1:13:19] not back to the beginning of my life
[1:13:20] here Way Beyond that back into the
[1:13:23] eternities I had a voice
[1:13:27] where were you
[1:13:28] when the sons of God
[1:13:30] shouted
[1:13:32] so we had a voice
[1:13:37] and her
[1:13:38] under her messenger
[1:13:41] will be the final voice
[1:13:44] to the final age he has struck the image
[1:13:48] speak
[1:13:50] speak
[1:13:51] why are you crying under me speak why
[1:13:54] are you lamenting under me speak
[1:13:55] he struck the image of your life and
[1:13:57] he's saying go on
[1:13:59] don't settle for what you've been given
[1:14:01] Church move Beyond this
[1:14:03] move Beyond this just this temporary
[1:14:05] world that we're in and see the way God
[1:14:08] sees you
[1:14:10] he says but remember the bride will be a
[1:14:13] called out separated different filled
[1:14:15] with the Holy Ghost born washed in the
[1:14:17] blood of the Lamb shall abstain from
[1:14:19] everything that's filthy around her she
[1:14:21] is the chase virgin pure by the word the
[1:14:23] word and her are the same
[1:14:26] somebody say same
[1:14:28] as a man
[1:14:31] as a man and his wife becomes one in
[1:14:33] Union so does the real genuine Church of
[1:14:35] God when he becomes in Christ the Bible
[1:14:37] is punctuated with an amen every promise
[1:14:40] don't make any difference what the
[1:14:42] denomination says the soul that's in The
[1:14:44] Believer will punctuate it because it is
[1:14:47] the word in him speaking out
[1:14:52] it's the word in you
[1:14:54] he sent his word into this age that is
[1:14:58] what's in you giving you the power to
[1:15:00] become sons of God and the Word was made
[1:15:03] flesh and dwelt among them and that
[1:15:06] power gave them the ability to become
[1:15:08] the sons of God it's the it's the word
[1:15:11] living in you
[1:15:15] talk about untapped resources
[1:15:20] that's right well I don't feel like it
[1:15:22] I'm tired and I'm tired well I'm tired I
[1:15:23] preached this morning
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:27] but it's not about how I feel it's not
[1:15:29] about how I I feel like well you should
[1:15:31] be preaching me happy and I'm just going
[1:15:33] to sit here and tell you excite me
[1:15:36] praise the Lord
[1:15:39] God's not an Entertainer
[1:15:40] God didn't come into this house tonight
[1:15:42] to entertain us to to to say I'm going
[1:15:46] to excite you with emotion God came into
[1:15:48] this house tonight to show us the value
[1:15:50] of what's on the inside of us that is
[1:15:52] greater than any temporary high it's
[1:15:54] greater than any temporary blessing the
[1:15:57] value that's on the inside of you cannot
[1:15:59] be reproduced it cannot be replaced it
[1:16:01] cannot be taken away but the value
[1:16:04] within you came from before I think
[1:16:07] we've got the point now right so we came
[1:16:09] from before
[1:16:13] so how long have you been a Christian
[1:16:18] where did you come from
[1:16:23] what's in you that's greater brother
[1:16:25] Branham says it's Christ
[1:16:27] the Anointed God that was in Christ is
[1:16:30] in you greater is he that's in you than
[1:16:32] he that's in the world then if he is in
[1:16:35] you it's not you anymore living it's him
[1:16:37] living
[1:16:39] in your thinking what you would think
[1:16:41] about this is what he said about this
[1:16:44] that if he is in you he absolutely would
[1:16:47] not deny what he said he couldn't do it
[1:16:49] but he would keep that what he has said
[1:16:51] and he is trying to find I I think this
[1:16:54] is powerful brother Terry God is trying
[1:16:56] to find he's seeking trying to find that
[1:17:01] person that he can vindicate himself
[1:17:03] through
[1:17:04] I say it's me friend I don't know about
[1:17:07] you but I say if God is looking for
[1:17:09] somebody to vindicate his word through
[1:17:11] here I am yeah I'm a man of unclean lips
[1:17:14] I don't deserve it I'm not worthy of it
[1:17:16] but Here I Am Lord vindicate yourself
[1:17:18] through me I'll give everything that I
[1:17:21] am to let your word be Vindicated in my
[1:17:23] life it doesn't matter what these 75
[1:17:25] years hold here just be the Vindicated
[1:17:28] word of the hour it wasn't just for the
[1:17:30] prophet to be the Vindicated word
[1:17:32] there's a bride on the earth that will
[1:17:34] be the Vindicated word of the hour they
[1:17:37] will fulfill every line every promise
[1:17:40] every amen every Victory they are the
[1:17:44] value of the word
[1:17:46] the artist has seen what's on the inside
[1:17:48] of you and he's refining it get in the
[1:17:51] hands of the Potter he knows what your
[1:17:54] potential is he knows what you're
[1:17:56] capable of I think about that story
[1:17:58] where the man would tell about that
[1:17:59] violin there at the auction right you
[1:18:01] all know it and they would say they
[1:18:03] couldn't give the thing away what do I
[1:18:04] have for this whole violin
[1:18:06] a dollar
[1:18:07] two bits
[1:18:09] five cents what do you anybody anybody
[1:18:12] never just getting ready give that thing
[1:18:13] away shamaya oh my
[1:18:19] if we could see us
[1:18:21] the way that God sees us
[1:18:24] Brother Sam we're probably not worth
[1:18:26] anything to anybody on this Earth they'd
[1:18:28] probably gladly give us up because they
[1:18:30] don't know the potential that's within
[1:18:31] there they don't know the reality of the
[1:18:34] value that's on the inside of the heart
[1:18:36] of a of a son or daughter of God and
[1:18:39] they'll just throw it away they'll just
[1:18:40] let that relationship go they'll just go
[1:18:43] ahead and say what you weren't worth
[1:18:44] anything anyway just be be gone see you
[1:18:46] bye later
[1:18:48] right you've been there how many
[1:18:50] relationships you've gone through in
[1:18:51] your life where they never recognize the
[1:18:53] value
[1:18:55] they never realized they were
[1:18:58] entertaining
[1:18:59] a son or daughter of God in their
[1:19:01] presence
[1:19:02] and you were thrown out of houses you
[1:19:03] were through I've been thrown out of the
[1:19:04] same church twice in my life
[1:19:08] true story
[1:19:11] I can't help it that they don't see the
[1:19:13] value on here
[1:19:15] that's the story for another time it's
[1:19:17] too long
[1:19:18] I can't help it that they don't see this
[1:19:21] but I know that I've been in the hands
[1:19:24] of the master and whatever his potential
[1:19:27] is for me I want to live to that
[1:19:29] potential and this violin sat there
[1:19:32] Dusty and old and tarnished and you
[1:19:34] might have never been you might have
[1:19:35] never been used by the Lord in your life
[1:19:37] and you sat there wondering if there was
[1:19:39] anything in you that was of value and
[1:19:41] you thought what's the point of
[1:19:42] continuing on you thought what am I even
[1:19:44] doing here but if you could just get in
[1:19:46] the hands of the master for a few
[1:19:48] moments and that old man came from the
[1:19:50] back of the of the building and he took
[1:19:52] the violin in his hand he said give that
[1:19:54] thing to me let me play it and he began
[1:19:56] to say there is a fountain
[1:19:59] and he began to play the sweetest medley
[1:20:02] filled with blood
[1:20:04] drawn from Emmanuel's veins where
[1:20:07] Sinners plunge beneath the flood the
[1:20:10] same violin
[1:20:11] it didn't change it was the same violin
[1:20:15] but in the hands of the master it became
[1:20:18] innumerable in value and they didn't
[1:20:20] know what to give for and everybody in
[1:20:22] the room was crying and the auctioneer
[1:20:23] was crying and the man sets down the bow
[1:20:25] and he walks away and they say well I
[1:20:28] have five thousand ten thousand fifteen
[1:20:30] thousand and they begin to see the value
[1:20:32] increased when it got in the hands of
[1:20:34] the master so if you feel like you're
[1:20:36] not great in value or you don't have
[1:20:38] anything to give to this cause just get
[1:20:40] into the presence of the master and
[1:20:42] watch him go to work in your life you
[1:20:44] might not have much but what you do have
[1:20:46] put it in his hands and watch him
[1:20:48] multiply it what do we have to eat we
[1:20:51] better send these people away we can't
[1:20:52] feed them Jesus said what do you have
[1:20:55] well we've got a couple pieces of bread
[1:20:57] and a couple of fish
[1:21:00] brother will we might just have a little
[1:21:03] bit of Faith but put it in his hands and
[1:21:06] watch him go to work on it put what you
[1:21:08] do have in his hand and watch it
[1:21:11] multiply and multiply and multiply watch
[1:21:14] the value come out in that because he
[1:21:16] knows how to get the value out of his
[1:21:19] creation he looked at it and he said
[1:21:21] it's very good
[1:21:23] praise God I like what I see I like what
[1:21:27] I've created
[1:21:29] Hallelujah
[1:21:30] to finish this quote brother man would
[1:21:32] say
[1:21:33] he's trying to find someone he can
[1:21:34] vindicate himself through and that
[1:21:36] doesn't mean he has to do it to
[1:21:37] everybody in the time that Moses let the
[1:21:40] children of Israel there was one that
[1:21:42] was Moses the rest of them just followed
[1:21:44] the message some of them tried to raise
[1:21:46] up an impersonating God said separate
[1:21:48] yourself and just swallow them up see
[1:21:50] now but that's that he that's in you
[1:21:53] then he that's in the world is greater
[1:21:56] but God in you like he was in Jesus
[1:21:59] Christ because what all God was he
[1:22:01] poured into Christ somebody say all with
[1:22:03] me just we're on the same page
[1:22:06] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:22:09] and all Christ was he poured into the
[1:22:12] church see that's God in you he that's
[1:22:15] in you no wonder winds and waves obey
[1:22:18] him obeyed his words obeyed obeyed him
[1:22:20] because it's God's word through him he
[1:22:23] was a man but he was the word made flesh
[1:22:25] and when he spoke it was God speaking
[1:22:27] through human lips no wonder the wind
[1:22:30] and waves the very creator that created
[1:22:32] the winds and the ways was in him now
[1:22:34] think of it think deep now he says
[1:22:37] for I come to this moment of closing no
[1:22:39] wonder demons paralyzed at his word it
[1:22:42] was God in him it was God in Christ the
[1:22:45] demons was paralyzed no wonder the dead
[1:22:47] that was that was turning back to the
[1:22:49] dust could not lay there at his word for
[1:22:51] he was the word
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] get it
[1:22:57] it's the word in flesh
[1:23:00] we're not detailed in the way that that
[1:23:02] statue of Moses was detailed
[1:23:04] but yet even in that example the body
[1:23:07] moves
[1:23:09] on its own
[1:23:10] it moves for itself
[1:23:13] that you didn't have to you move your
[1:23:14] pinky she might move your pinky like
[1:23:16] this
[1:23:17] you didn't have to tell your tendon down
[1:23:18] there to move
[1:23:19] it moved on its own
[1:23:22] why because it's part of the body I take
[1:23:25] this step and my toes automatically go
[1:23:26] out why because it's balanced they're
[1:23:29] part of the body
[1:23:32] we don't have to tell you how to operate
[1:23:33] under the unction of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:35] you're part of the body we do what we do
[1:23:38] Under the inspiration of the spirit for
[1:23:41] We Are The Bride Church in this age and
[1:23:43] for somebody to come in here and tell me
[1:23:45] that I'm not I can't do that I can't
[1:23:47] have a prayer line I can't lay my hands
[1:23:49] on somebody I can't shout I can't dance
[1:23:52] I can't I can do whatever I feel to do
[1:23:54] you know why because I'm free and as
[1:23:56] long as it's in the order of the church
[1:23:57] I'm free to operate under the unction of
[1:23:59] the holy spirit for who is writing the
[1:24:01] last book of Acts
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:03] I can't speak for anybody else but I am
[1:24:06] writing a chapter in the last book of
[1:24:09] Acts so I would be the one to know how
[1:24:11] the bride of Christ acts she acts like I
[1:24:14] do she acts like you do she acts like
[1:24:16] you do she responds like you do she gets
[1:24:19] she gets a little emotional like I do
[1:24:21] why because we are the bride and we are
[1:24:24] the ones right in the last book we are
[1:24:27] the final voice to the final age
[1:24:30] and I don't care how many critics come
[1:24:32] into the house of God and say that you
[1:24:33] shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do
[1:24:35] that and you shouldn't act like this
[1:24:37] well you should go back and read your
[1:24:38] Bible
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:40] because every man operated under the
[1:24:43] unction of the Holy Ghost in that day
[1:24:45] and they did the ax
[1:24:47] of those that were filled with the
[1:24:49] spirit of God that's what we're doing in
[1:24:52] this age
[1:24:53] friends we're not bound we're not
[1:24:54] chained we're not defeated the chain
[1:24:57] that you think's holding you is an
[1:24:58] imaginary chain it's not real there's
[1:25:01] nothing real to it he's a bluff he's a
[1:25:03] liar he's a fake I don't know how to put
[1:25:05] it
[1:25:08] he's he's defeated
[1:25:11] he doesn't have the keys to his own
[1:25:12] house
[1:25:13] in it
[1:25:15] and to think that we would sit there in
[1:25:17] a in a jail cell
[1:25:19] when the door is wide open
[1:25:24] on Emancipation Proclamation day there
[1:25:27] was a slave who got the news before
[1:25:28] everybody else and he came to the other
[1:25:30] slaves he said we're free yeah I said
[1:25:32] hey you better be quiet man
[1:25:36] you know what
[1:25:37] to hear you
[1:25:39] oh you better not say that Devil's got a
[1:25:41] Punch coming
[1:25:43] buddy he's got a Punch coming but I've
[1:25:45] already made it on the other side
[1:25:48] Monday morning's coming but I've already
[1:25:50] made it on the other side he's got a
[1:25:53] blow coming to you but I've already
[1:25:55] defeated him I already know who wins I
[1:25:58] already know I'm the Victor in this I
[1:26:00] already know that he's defeated and I
[1:26:01] win so I'm not scared to attack him
[1:26:03] toe-to-toe I'm not scared to go right to
[1:26:06] his door because he doesn't even have
[1:26:07] the keys to it kick in the door and said
[1:26:09] I'm taking back what you have taken from
[1:26:11] me I think it's a time in this age where
[1:26:13] we've got to take back what the devil
[1:26:15] stole from us
[1:26:20] was there ever a time in your life where
[1:26:22] you had joy unspeakable and full of
[1:26:24] Glory why not now I think it's time to
[1:26:27] take it back go back to the devil's
[1:26:29] house kicking his door and say I want it
[1:26:31] back it's yours to have it's got your
[1:26:34] name on it it's your possession do you
[1:26:36] remember a time when you weren't always
[1:26:37] tired and fatigued and sick and Afraid
[1:26:40] come on take it back
[1:26:44] how about the night we first got the
[1:26:46] Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] you remember what it was like brother
[1:26:48] Amos I didn't care what anybody thought
[1:26:50] about me I didn't care who was looking
[1:26:52] what was happening I didn't care what
[1:26:54] song was being sung I didn't care the
[1:26:56] trouble in the offices in the church I
[1:26:58] didn't care that this was on tune or not
[1:26:59] on tune I didn't care about anything
[1:27:04] all I know is that something happened in
[1:27:06] me and when you first walk out of that
[1:27:08] cell and you're free for the first time
[1:27:10] in your life
[1:27:12] whoo
[1:27:14] [Applause]
[1:27:15] hallelujah oh my and everybody's your
[1:27:19] buddy everybody's your friend now you

[1:27:31] take it back take back the unity and
[1:27:35] fellowship take back a smile on your
[1:27:38] face take back being able to enjoy your
[1:27:41] salvation
[1:27:42] go back and take it say I'm not you've
[1:27:45] had it too long devil you've had my
[1:27:48] victory too long you've had my dance too
[1:27:50] long you've had my shout too long I'm
[1:27:52] going to your camp and I'm taking back
[1:27:54] what rightfully belongs to me it's my
[1:27:57] voice in the end and I'm going to take
[1:27:59] it back
[1:28:00] the authority of the position of the
[1:28:03] believer in this age there is nothing
[1:28:04] that we cannot claim in this word every
[1:28:07] promise is in fulfillment right now
[1:28:09] every promise the spoken word authority
[1:28:12] to be healed under while Peter yet spec
[1:28:14] these words
[1:28:16] I'm just gonna deal with this for a
[1:28:18] second okay Peter was not teaching some
[1:28:21] dry intellectual sermon go back and read
[1:28:23] acts 10 Peter was preaching the power of
[1:28:25] the Holy Ghost and while Peter preached
[1:28:27] these words the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:28:30] them so you're not going to get away
[1:28:31] with just saying having a dry lecture
[1:28:33] and expecting the Holy Ghost to come in
[1:28:35] will you preach the word under an
[1:28:37] anointing where lies could be changed
[1:28:39] under the preaching of the word and I'll
[1:28:40] get behind you but don't try to use it
[1:28:43] as a crutch to say well we can just
[1:28:44] speak and it'll work no you've got to
[1:28:46] preach an anointing like Peter preached
[1:28:48] where the Holy Ghost can move in Liberty
[1:28:50] and change hearts and change lives and
[1:28:53] if it happens that way I'm under that
[1:28:55] Covenant
[1:28:57] if it happens through a prayer line and
[1:28:59] the laying of it on of hands I'm also
[1:29:01] under that Covenant I don't care how it
[1:29:04] happens just let it happen
[1:29:07] well you're going to get too fanatical
[1:29:09] they're going to call me a fanatic
[1:29:11] anyway
[1:29:12] I'm too far gone into this
[1:29:16] but the BAM said it like this they call
[1:29:17] me a Holy Roller he said well I guess if
[1:29:19] the Lord asked me to roll I would
[1:29:21] that's about how I feel right now if the
[1:29:24] Lord told me to roll I'd roll if the
[1:29:26] Lord told me to to run to the back and
[1:29:28] the friend I do it whatever the Lord
[1:29:29] tells me to do because he's seeking
[1:29:31] worshipers that will worship Him in
[1:29:34] spirit and in truth that will do only
[1:29:37] what he says do
[1:29:39] oh my God
[1:29:43] Jesus thank you Jesus we're not we're
[1:29:45] not guessing at this
[1:29:46] but we have word for this
[1:29:50] you have to try so hard
[1:29:53] to cut out the moving of God in the word
[1:29:55] to line up with a Doctrine you've got to
[1:29:57] really try
[1:29:58] because it's just everywhere in there
[1:30:00] and the spirit of God in the beginning
[1:30:02] the spirit of God what
[1:30:05] oh
[1:30:10] he moved
[1:30:12] well we're not for the moving of The
[1:30:13] Spirit Well God was
[1:30:15] let me say this the angel of the Lord is
[1:30:18] pleased with the moving of the spirit
[1:30:20] because one time there in Indiana
[1:30:21] brother random was preaching and a
[1:30:23] little dunker girl got so caught up
[1:30:25] under the anointing because a crippled
[1:30:27] baby began to run across the aisle there
[1:30:29] that she knew I think it was her niece
[1:30:31] or nephew or something and she was there
[1:30:33] playing the piano and the age of the
[1:30:35] Lord was so pleased by the moving of the
[1:30:37] spirit that when she got up to praise
[1:30:38] the Lord the angel continued playing the
[1:30:41] piano don't tell me that God's not in
[1:30:43] the moving of the spirit don't tell me
[1:30:45] that God's not an emotion he absolutely
[1:30:47] is an emotion he absolutely isn't is in
[1:30:50] is in is in Praise In Worship and the
[1:30:53] dance he's in all that
[1:30:56] amen but let me say what's happened is
[1:30:58] somebody has come and put a label over
[1:31:00] that
[1:31:01] you feel guilty for doing it oh my well
[1:31:04] I don't know about is this okay are we
[1:31:06] okay but Sean you come correct me if you
[1:31:08] need to but this is the way I see it
[1:31:10] somebody's put a label over the church
[1:31:12] and now we're afraid to enter into a
[1:31:15] greater a greater realm of worship
[1:31:17] because of what somebody might say about
[1:31:19] us or what we might think about us now I
[1:31:21] know how this works friends because I've
[1:31:23] been here and you do a victory dance at
[1:31:25] camp and then the next week you're
[1:31:26] feeling solo
[1:31:28] oh my
[1:31:30] maybe it was just emotion
[1:31:32] maybe nothing really happened that day
[1:31:35] and then the devil is with his label
[1:31:36] maker
[1:31:41] before you know it he's put label over
[1:31:44] label over label
[1:31:49] remember we were talking about earlier
[1:31:50] about the books how it only had we only
[1:31:53] had books and tapes and nobody had the
[1:31:54] table and
[1:31:56] the Terry you remember the red volume
[1:31:57] sets my dad had a red volume said and
[1:32:00] man he wore them things out right he had
[1:32:01] the front and back he had red duct tape
[1:32:03] on him and he had highlights and riding
[1:32:05] in there and every well one day
[1:32:08] his steelbook went missing
[1:32:10] he was devastated
[1:32:12] oh my and he had some printed out quotes
[1:32:15] and but those days not everybody had a
[1:32:17] computer and you had to go find somebody
[1:32:19] that had a computer search out the quote
[1:32:20] to print it out and you know and then he
[1:32:22] would just you know borrow some of these
[1:32:23] red book here and you know get this
[1:32:25] quote and then write it down and go on
[1:32:26] you know but he didn't have one
[1:32:30] well one day we find ourselves visiting
[1:32:32] with this brother
[1:32:33] and he's got a whole set on this shelf
[1:32:34] and my dad said oh yeah yeah and grabs
[1:32:37] up and grabs the seal book he said I was
[1:32:38] looking for this quote do you mind him
[1:32:39] no no go ahead flipping through it yeah
[1:32:41] there it is
[1:32:42] man
[1:32:44] that looks like my handwriting
[1:32:49] man I made that same note there
[1:32:52] that's incredible and it began I was
[1:32:54] just a little little it got weird
[1:32:57] it got really weird in the room and he
[1:33:00] flipped over to another and he flipped
[1:33:01] to the back of the book no no no sure
[1:33:03] enough it said the guy's name you know
[1:33:04] Reverend so and so
[1:33:07] he flips back and I was gonna look for
[1:33:09] this quote
[1:33:13] I made the same no I drew the drew the
[1:33:15] same little
[1:33:16] of the Statue of a perfect man next to
[1:33:18] that quote that you drew and it looks
[1:33:20] just like my handwriting weird
[1:33:24] they began to get really weird in there
[1:33:26] and he flips to the back of the book
[1:33:28] but he notices there's a little curl
[1:33:32] on the edge of that label
[1:33:34] he thought no
[1:33:36] surely not
[1:33:38] brother will he just
[1:33:39] rips off that label and his name is
[1:33:42] underneath that label and he said this
[1:33:44] is my volume this is my shield book oh I
[1:33:46] don't know how that happened I'm not
[1:33:48] sure how that label got over there well
[1:33:49] I think it's time that we the Church of
[1:33:51] the Living God recognize that we are the
[1:33:54] Church of the Living God and take the
[1:33:55] label off of whatever some enemy some
[1:33:58] some dried up old traditional preacher
[1:34:00] put over the church to say we can't we
[1:34:03] can't we can't I say I can I say I will
[1:34:07] I say I do believe rip the label off the
[1:34:11] church and let God be God in the
[1:34:13] building let God do as he willeth in
[1:34:15] your life let God activate something
[1:34:17] within you that you can release an
[1:34:19] atmosphere of worship and of joy and a
[1:34:22] praise that you've never known before
[1:34:24] rip the label off of that you'll not
[1:34:26] find anywhere in this word where it's
[1:34:28] not allowed for you to praise the Lord
[1:34:34] don't Worship the Lord you will not find
[1:34:36] it you will not find a scripture but to
[1:34:39] the contrary you will find David said
[1:34:42] let everything that half breath praise
[1:34:45] ye the lord it's our commission if the
[1:34:48] image were to speak it would say thank
[1:34:50] you it would say ah you Release Me From
[1:34:53] The Bondage that I was in it would have
[1:34:55] an expression of thanks to give
[1:34:58] I who was once trapped in sin am now
[1:35:02] free to worship been called and exalted
[1:35:05] on high a son and daughter of God I'll
[1:35:08] never have an end I'll never cease to
[1:35:11] exist for I am Eternal and the thoughts
[1:35:14] of God never will have an end I've got
[1:35:17] reason to praise him I've got reason to
[1:35:20] shout I've got reason to have joy
[1:35:22] unspeakable and full of Glory because I
[1:35:25] know where I come from
[1:35:29] Hallelujah I know why I'm here I know
[1:35:33] why I've been sent here in this age to
[1:35:35] become the Fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:35:37] of God himself
[1:35:39] the image
[1:35:41] and he looked at it and he said it's
[1:35:43] very good brother Branham says when you
[1:35:45] worship uninhibited I have the quote for
[1:35:47] you it pleases him wow
[1:35:51] oh my God it pleases the father when we
[1:35:55] worship without reserve it pleases the
[1:35:58] father when we're able to rip off every
[1:35:59] label every band every bondage Every
[1:36:02] Chain every shackle and we recognize
[1:36:05] that he's supreme authority in the land
[1:36:07] he can do anything all things are
[1:36:10] possible through him it doesn't matter
[1:36:12] how great the chain or the years that
[1:36:14] have gone by it doesn't matter the
[1:36:16] damage that's been done but all things
[1:36:19] are possible
[1:36:21] Glory why wouldn't we let our voice ring
[1:36:24] out
[1:36:27] who
[1:36:28] if our piano player could come why
[1:36:30] wouldn't we
[1:36:32] why would we use it to backbite somebody
[1:36:35] why we use our voice to talk negative
[1:36:37] about somebody or negative about
[1:36:39] ourselves or to say well I wish I could
[1:36:40] or maybe it's for me or maybe it's not
[1:36:42] for me why would we use our voice for so
[1:36:44] many other things than what our voice
[1:36:46] was intended to be used for
[1:36:51] it's an honest question
[1:36:53] why
[1:36:55] because we don't recognize the potential
[1:36:58] that's in true worship
[1:37:04] the band would say it's What God Says
[1:37:07] the bride
[1:37:09] is the word they're one
[1:37:12] when that word that's wrote in there
[1:37:13] becomes in you and make you the word
[1:37:16] becomes one that's exactly what he
[1:37:18] promised
[1:37:20] then interpret it
[1:37:22] God don't need
[1:37:24] an interpreter
[1:37:30] they say well we interpret it like this
[1:37:32] you've got no right to interpret nothing
[1:37:34] God does his own interpretation God said
[1:37:37] let there be light and there was light
[1:37:39] who interprets that you don't need an
[1:37:42] interpretation he said a virgin shall
[1:37:44] conceive and she did that don't need any
[1:37:47] interpreter it's already interpreted God
[1:37:49] said these things would happen in this
[1:37:51] day and it is it don't need no
[1:37:54] interpreter it interprets itself
[1:37:58] amen and God made man in his own image
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:05] interprets itself
[1:38:10] we're the people of a prophecy are we
[1:38:12] not
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] we're not doing manufacturing it we're
[1:38:17] just walking in perfect step with the
[1:38:19] word
[1:38:23] no nothing you couldn't work up to a
[1:38:25] true worship if you wanted to
[1:38:28] a false label that the devil's put over
[1:38:30] the church without a bunch of work up
[1:38:32] and emotion sure there's Pentecostal
[1:38:33] churches that are working up but you
[1:38:35] could not come under true worship if you
[1:38:37] worked up with all your might and all
[1:38:39] that within you but it only comes by
[1:38:41] revelation
[1:38:43] true worship only comes by the
[1:38:45] revelation of what he is to you who you
[1:38:48] are in him the thankfulness that's
[1:38:50] within your heart to cry out and how
[1:38:52] dare some preacher try to say that you
[1:38:55] can't release a praise in the house of
[1:38:57] God I defy that spirit that would try to
[1:39:00] bind the children of God from worshiping
[1:39:01] him as he deserves to be worshiped
[1:39:04] that's our purpose here on this Earth to
[1:39:07] worship him and he's seeking somebody
[1:39:12] his own words the father seeketh
[1:39:16] looking searching is there anybody
[1:39:20] is there anybody
[1:39:22] that'll worship me in spirit and in
[1:39:24] truth is there anybody that'll take the
[1:39:26] reality of the word that I brought and
[1:39:28] see the truth of the matter and then
[1:39:30] give back Worship in the spirit is there
[1:39:33] anybody that will move within both
[1:39:34] Realms at the same time in the middle of
[1:39:36] the road to be perfectly balanced in
[1:39:38] spirit and in truth is there anybody in
[1:39:41] this age that recognizes why we're here
[1:39:43] why we've been given this word why we've
[1:39:46] been given this Revelation it does no
[1:39:48] good to be taught everything from
[1:39:49] Genesis to Revelation if you don't apply
[1:39:52] it to your life
[1:39:54] though I know all the Mysteries though I
[1:39:56] know I can speak with tongue of men and
[1:39:58] angels
[1:40:00] but I don't have the love for God's word
[1:40:03] which is shown by the way we worship
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:40:15] keep it
[1:40:18] so he cleaned me up inside he thought I
[1:40:23] was too tired

[1:42:15] forever because I am free because I am
[1:42:20] home and
[1:42:22] everyone I know Hallelujah you know
[1:42:25] that's just the way God operates
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:28] how many remembers the story of how
[1:42:30] brother Branham got the baptism of the
[1:42:31] Holy Ghost
[1:42:32] we talk about how he came to the Lord
[1:42:34] behind the Coal Shed right but you know
[1:42:36] how he got the baptism the Holy Ghost he
[1:42:37] was on a date with a girl and he was
[1:42:39] walking in downtown and all of a sudden
[1:42:41] he realized he was walking in the middle
[1:42:43] of a vision that he'd been there before
[1:42:45] and he was walking by this old converted
[1:42:47] Saloon in the basement of this downtown
[1:42:49] building with a bunch of negroes
[1:42:51] worshiping the Lord and getting carried
[1:42:53] away in charismatics what we would call
[1:42:55] Azusa Street Pentecost and he was
[1:42:57] walking by that building and the Lord
[1:42:59] spoke to him and said you you need what
[1:43:02] they have
[1:43:04] now you go back and read this I got
[1:43:06] seven or eight quotes on this without
[1:43:08] money or without price you can go read
[1:43:09] it in your time and he says in the in
[1:43:11] the most unlikely place in the most
[1:43:14] illegitimate people the worst people the
[1:43:16] most illegitimate place you'd ever think
[1:43:18] of on the earth God came down and we
[1:43:21] don't know the brother's name we don't
[1:43:22] know what he preached we don't know what
[1:43:23] he was saying but he preached an
[1:43:25] atmosphere of an anointing so great when
[1:43:27] brother Branham had to turn into the
[1:43:29] building that little lady he was with
[1:43:30] said if you go in there Bill Branham
[1:43:32] you'll never have it never date with me
[1:43:34] again and he said bye
[1:43:37] foreign
[1:43:39] you might have to give up a few
[1:43:40] relationships you might have to give up
[1:43:42] a few things you might have to say bye
[1:43:44] to a few a few things holding you down
[1:43:46] but the prophet of God led by example
[1:43:48] and he said bye Felicia I got a mission
[1:43:51] in here I've got somewhere to be in here
[1:43:54] they have what I need and without money
[1:43:57] or without pricing brother Brandon said
[1:43:59] this they're on the floor I received the
[1:44:03] Holy Ghost if it was good enough for the
[1:44:05] prophet it's good enough for me you see
[1:44:08] a man won't read that quote when he's
[1:44:09] trying to keep you in a dry atmosphere
[1:44:11] but read the entire message and find out
[1:44:14] what the reality of the matter is
[1:44:16] they're on the floor the prophet of God
[1:44:19] received the Holy Ghost and he said they
[1:44:21] had what I needed
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:26] it's good enough for him it's good
[1:44:28] enough for me I think we ought to praise
[1:44:31] him unreserved
