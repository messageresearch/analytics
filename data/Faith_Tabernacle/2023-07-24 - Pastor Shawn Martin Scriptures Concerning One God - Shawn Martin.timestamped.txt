[19:26] brother Sean preached brother Walker's
[19:28] funeral which
[19:29] I've been to a lot of funerals but that
[19:32] was one of the most excellent messages
[19:33] they talked about all the different
[19:34] chains taking place in brother Walker's
[19:37] life you know and from the beginning
[19:38] down to his life and and then this last
[19:41] change they talked about you know First

[20:05] change after a while
[20:08] where are we now where frown we'll wear
[20:11] a smile oh we may suffer pain or loss
[20:16] but Jesus died upon the cross that we
[20:20] might have a change after a while
[20:24] in the Bible we are told of an Angel to
[20:29] behold yes a prophet sent to change the
[20:32] course of man in a lowly place of Earth
[20:37] came a light down to the Earth for it
[20:41] was proof a mighty gift had blessed our
[20:44] lands now the time of change is here and
[20:48] the sign he said was clear that when a
[20:51] steak was driven down into the ground

[20:59] people might be blessed was a season
[21:02] that the Thunders was to sound I'm

[21:14] wear a smile oh we may suffer pain or
[21:18] loss but Jesus died upon the cross that
[21:22] we might have a chain after a while the

[32:32] praise the lord well the musicians can
[32:36] be dismissed and um
[32:40] if you'd like to turn I'm going to turn
[32:43] to two scriptures here to start off with
[32:45] first Peter the third chapter
[32:49] and um
[32:55] we quoted them this morning but I'm
[32:57] going to read them
[33:00] here and
[33:07] first Peter the third chapter
[33:11] and the 15th verse
[33:15] it says but sanctify the Lord God in
[33:17] your hearts
[33:19] and be ready always to give an answer to
[33:21] every man that asketh you a reason of
[33:23] the hope that is in you with meekness
[33:27] and fear
[33:29] amen
[33:31] then if you'll go with me second Timothy
[33:36] 2 14.
[33:42] II Timothy second chapter
[33:46] and we're going to start at the 14th
[33:48] verse 14 and 15.
[33:52] but it says of these things put them in
[33:54] remembrance charging them before the
[33:56] Lord that they strive not about words to
[34:00] no prophet
[34:01] but to the subverting of the hearers
[34:06] studied to show thyself approved unto
[34:08] God a Workman that needeth not to be
[34:11] ashamed rightly dividing
[34:14] the word of Truth
[34:17] and in news 16th verse but Shan shun
[34:20] profane and vain babblings
[34:23] for they will increase unto more
[34:24] ungodliness amen let's just bow our
[34:29] heads talk to our Lord father
[34:32] we ask that you would just be with us
[34:34] this evening and Lord may your presence
[34:38] just
[34:39] be here Lord and
[34:42] pray that you would just give us all a
[34:45] better understanding Lord and
[34:48] father we just Commit This service into
[34:51] your hands now in Jesus Christ's name
[34:54] amen
[34:56] you can have your seeds
[34:59] um
[35:01] we we believe that there is only one God
[35:06] and um and I guess I wanted to deal uh
[35:10] with this just for
[35:14] um
[35:15] the sake of the young people or just
[35:17] anyone
[35:19] and I guess most of you young people
[35:23] have been raised in the message
[35:25] and so as I said this morning you have a
[35:28] general idea as to what we believe as
[35:32] message Believers but
[35:35] um it it
[35:37] I I think all of adults here desire that
[35:42] you not just have an understanding as
[35:45] far as what you've been taught by your
[35:47] parents but
[35:49] that you'd be grounded in the scriptures
[35:52] to where you know that what we believe
[35:54] is the absolute truth
[35:56] and I know I desire that for my children
[35:59] and for all of us here that you don't
[36:02] just go by because of what Mom and Dad
[36:05] said or the preacher said or whatever
[36:07] but that you can actually be be grounded
[36:10] in knowing that what you believe is not
[36:13] a fairy tale it but it is it is the
[36:16] truth and and then that way you can base
[36:20] your convictions upon the word of God uh
[36:24] and not upon how you were raised
[36:27] um of course uh it's important that you
[36:31] are raised in the truth but it it it
[36:34] comes to a time that that it's it it's
[36:38] it switches from dead and Mom's
[36:40] convictions to your convictions and uh
[36:43] because you're going to be tested you're
[36:46] going to be tried you're going to go
[36:47] through the uh there's going to be
[36:49] people wanting to know what you believe
[36:50] and they're they're going to ask you
[36:52] they're going to want they're going to
[36:53] want proof and and it's not that you're
[36:56] going to change everybody's mind it's
[36:58] not that you're going to convince
[36:59] everybody
[37:00] but you need to know where you stand be
[37:04] uh I I think it's uh as it's been said
[37:07] before that if someone can talk you into
[37:09] it someone else can talk you out of it
[37:11] and so it's it's got to be something
[37:14] based your your convictions your beliefs
[37:17] have got to be founded up on the word of
[37:20] God
[37:21] and so uh um and I I think that um some
[37:26] of you are finding out that not the
[37:30] majority believe the way we believe and
[37:33] uh and they do not believe the way the
[37:36] Bible teaches and such as the belief
[37:39] that God sent a prophet in this age and
[37:43] uh the idea of a prophet scares so many
[37:45] people and uh and that's and and that's
[37:48] fine and and true it's it's because
[37:51] we've had men that claim to be prophets
[37:54] and and they've LED people into weird
[37:56] ways and uh but but that doesn't do away
[38:01] with the fact that God promised to send
[38:03] a prophet in this day
[38:05] uh and and so uh we're just going to
[38:08] read scriptures uh tonight
[38:11] um being that we have communion and uh
[38:14] so
[38:15] um I got my two boys here
[38:18] um we're going to have them to pass the
[38:20] mic around
[38:21] and um I just told no preaching and just
[38:26] just
[38:26] um okay and then David you can come over
[38:29] here and then uh
[38:33] they've been really excited about this I
[38:36] mean this is something they're really
[38:37] excited about especially with Levi at
[38:39] least I I guess David's excited too but
[38:43] uh so uh David was or Levi was concerned
[38:47] do we do we just put it up on their
[38:49] mouth or do they hold it and it probably
[38:52] best you hold it
[38:53] or you'll be eating it but um
[38:56] so
[38:58] um
[38:59] uh anyways we're we're gonna you you
[39:02] they're going to give you the mic and so
[39:05] you can read them and then re read aloud
[39:08] so everyone can hear and write these
[39:12] scriptures down and we're probably not
[39:15] going to get all the scriptures but
[39:16] we're going to try to get as many as we
[39:18] can the Bible only speaks of one God and
[39:22] that's that's my point of these
[39:24] scriptures uh because
[39:26] people think that they got this idea
[39:29] that there's either one God in three
[39:31] persons or there's three gods and and
[39:34] Etc
[39:35] but there is only one God and no matter
[39:40] what the majority says the Bible's right
[39:43] right and so uh I do want to start off
[39:47] if you'd like to turn with me to Genesis
[39:50] 1 1 and maybe we could just start right
[39:53] there
[39:54] um Genesis 1 1 and you know it but we're
[39:59] going to read it anyways okay
[40:01] um
[40:07] Genesis
[40:09] buying Vine Genesis okay
[40:11] 1-1 it says and you can read it with me
[40:16] in the beginning
[40:17] God created the Heaven and the Earth in
[40:22] the beginning God created so uh uh we at
[40:26] this point there is only one god
[40:28] mentioned right at the beginning of the
[40:30] Bible God created the Heavenly Earth
[40:32] ain't that right so if a person just had
[40:35] that one scripture just that just start
[40:37] with that one scripture uh that God not
[40:41] God's as in plural but one God God
[40:45] created the Heaven and the Earth ain't
[40:48] that right and as we talked about that
[40:50] this God and that word god means Elohim
[40:54] the self-existent one ain't that right
[40:56] so uh uh we're going to have uh uh let's
[41:02] see uh brother Mark you want to start
[41:04] this off okay Malachi at 2 10. and um
[41:09] and read it uh out loud so that
[41:13] everybody can
[41:14] see what we're doing
[41:18] and and if you want to turn to these
[41:20] scriptures you can as well
[41:24] Malachi 2 10.
[41:29] have we not all one father hath not one
[41:32] God created us why do we deal
[41:34] treacherously every man against his
[41:37] brother by profaning the Covenant of our
[41:40] fathers
[41:41] amen so again have we not all one father
[41:47] hath not one God everybody say one God
[41:50] created us so not two or more Gods but
[41:54] one God
[41:55] amen we give brother Amos you want to go
[41:59] to Colossians 1 12.
[42:01] through 17.
[42:13] Colossians 1 12.
[42:17] and read through 17.
[42:31] giving thanks unto the father
[42:34] which hath made us meet to be partakers
[42:38] of the inheritance
[42:41] of the Saints
[42:43] in light
[42:45] who had delivered us from the power of
[42:47] Darkness
[42:48] it translated us into the kingdom
[42:52] of his dear son
[42:54] in whom we have Redemption through his
[42:57] blood
[42:58] even the Forgiveness of sins
[43:01] who is the image of the invisible God
[43:05] the firstborn of every creature
[43:08] who by him were all things created
[43:12] that are in heaven
[43:14] and that are in Earth visible and
[43:17] invisible
[43:18] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[43:22] principalities or powers
[43:24] all things were created by Him
[43:27] for him
[43:29] and he is before all things by him all
[43:33] things consist
[43:35] amen so his dear son who is the image of
[43:41] the invisible God
[43:44] the firstborn of ever creature for by
[43:46] him were all things created amen now uh
[43:53] we'll just keep on but we we look at the
[43:56] scriptures and it tells us that there is
[43:58] one Lord
[44:00] and uh
[44:02] we'll look uh sister Becky you want to
[44:05] read Deuteronomy 6 and 4.
[44:14] Deuteronomy 6 and 4.
[44:28] hear o Israel the Lord our God is one
[44:32] Lord
[44:34] amen
[44:35] so the Lord our what
[44:39] God is one Lord
[44:44] and we'll go uh Mark sister Anna you
[44:49] want to read a few scriptures mark 12.
[44:54] 29-30
[44:57] and also verse 32.
[45:00] mark 12.
[45:02] 29-30
[45:06] as well as 32.
[45:09] and Jesus answered him
[45:11] first of all
[45:14] God is one Lord and thou shalt love the
[45:17] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[45:19] all thy soul and with all thy mind and
[45:21] with all thy strength this is the first
[45:22] commandment
[45:24] and the Scribe said unto him well
[45:25] mastered thou has said the truth for
[45:27] there is one God and there is none other
[45:29] but he
[45:30] amen
[45:32] one God and there's none other
[45:35] and that God is Lord ain't that right
[45:39] the Lord and so we're not he's not com
[45:43] asking us to love two Gods three Gods
[45:46] he's asking us to love the Lord thy God
[45:49] one God ain't that right and that Lord
[45:53] is our creator
[45:55] Romans 3 29
[46:00] um
[46:02] um
[46:03] sister Alice you want to read that for
[46:06] us
[46:07] Romans 3 29
[46:12] through 30.
[46:17] is he the god of the Jews only or is he
[46:21] not also of the Gentiles yes of the
[46:25] Gentiles also seeing it is one God which
[46:29] shall justify the circumcision by faith
[46:32] and uncircumcision through faith amen
[46:36] amen amen so it's not only just the Jews
[46:39] that have one God
[46:40] but the same God of the Jews is the god
[46:42] of the Gentiles
[46:44] ain't that right and you cannot get no
[46:47] Orthodox Jew a real Jew to believe that
[46:49] there's more than one God
[46:52] amen and a True Believer of a gentile
[46:55] will only believe there's one God
[46:57] ain't that right so uh uh Ephesians the
[47:02] fourth chapter and uh brother will do
[47:05] you want to read that Ephesians 4 4.
[47:08] through six
[47:12] Ephesians chapter 4 verse 4.
[47:15] through 6.
[47:18] there is one body and one Spirit even as
[47:22] ye are called in one hope of your
[47:25] calling the Lord One Faith one baptism
[47:28] one God and Father of all who is above
[47:31] all and through all and in you all amen
[47:36] so one body one Spirit one Lord one God
[47:44] and Father
[47:47] of all ain't that right who is above all
[47:51] through all and
[47:54] in you all amen so uh uh now we uh
[48:02] uh you have to take these scriptures and
[48:04] study when you get home because we could
[48:07] go through a lot of them but if you want
[48:09] to say that with me there is one God
[48:12] and father of all
[48:16] who is above all
[48:18] through all and in you all can I ask you
[48:22] did you quote scripture
[48:24] or did you quote some man
[48:27] in that scripture
[48:29] all right okay so the god that is in you
[48:33] all is the father of all
[48:36] who is above all and through all not the
[48:40] third person in the godhead
[48:42] right not the third person it's not God
[48:46] the Father God the son and God the Holy
[48:48] Ghost
[48:49] the one God that's in you is father of
[48:52] all
[48:53] above all
[48:55] through all in you all ain't that right
[48:59] amen so uh um John 14 uh Sister Crystal
[49:05] do you want to read for us John 14 26.
[49:18] and I want to just point this out that
[49:21] when it says in you all it's it's uh uh
[49:25] again it's not in in as far as every
[49:28] human being he's talking about sons of
[49:31] God Sons and Daughters of God ain't that
[49:34] right
[49:34] amen so John 14 and 26.
[49:39] Twitter which is the Holy Ghost whom the
[49:42] father will send in my name he shall
[49:45] teach you all things and bring all
[49:47] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[49:49] have said unto you
[49:51] amen so the comforter which is the Holy
[49:55] Ghost right and these are Jesus's words
[49:58] brother Branson you want to read uh John
[50:01] 14 16-17
[50:07] John 14 16-17
[50:21] Saint John 14
[50:24] and 16.
[50:27] in in 17. Sister Crystal just read where
[50:30] Jesus said about the comforter which is
[50:32] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[50:34] in my name
[50:39] another comforter that he may abide with
[50:42] you forever
[50:43] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[50:45] cannot receive because it seeth and not
[50:47] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[50:50] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[50:52] amen
[50:53] so again the spirit of Truth is the
[50:57] comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[51:00] whom whom Jesus said the father will
[51:02] send in my name ain't that right
[51:05] now we just read that he what Jesus says
[51:08] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[51:13] you ain't that right so here he's saying
[51:16] he dwellers with you uh uh which there
[51:19] he was there in body he was dwelling
[51:22] with them but he says he would dwell in
[51:25] you and we just read there is one God
[51:28] and Father of all who is above all
[51:31] through all and
[51:33] in you all ain't that right so he's not
[51:37] talking about two Gods coming in you
[51:39] it's the one God
[51:42] ain't that right
[51:44] one God so uh um we can look and um
[51:50] let's see here uh we we find that Jesus
[51:55] identified the Holy Ghost as being the
[51:57] comforter that will come
[51:59] and he said that he was dwelling with
[52:02] them then for he dwelleth with you
[52:05] and how did he dwell with them
[52:07] by living in a human body
[52:10] called Jesus Christ right he dwelt with
[52:13] them
[52:14] living in a human body
[52:16] so he was dwelling with them but he says
[52:19] he shall be in you and that happened
[52:22] when
[52:24] on the day of Pentecost that's right and
[52:28] after after the day of Pentecost we we
[52:31] read where where we we just read it he
[52:34] Ephesians 4 and 6 where Paul tells us
[52:37] who is the one inside of us the one God
[52:40] and Father of us all
[52:44] can you say man so the comforter is the
[52:47] one God and Father of us all and the
[52:51] comforter is the Holy Ghost
[52:53] ain't that right so if this is correct
[52:55] if all these scriptures are correct the
[52:57] Holy Ghost which is the comforter the
[53:00] spirit of Truth is the one God and
[53:04] Father of all and he is above all
[53:07] through all and in you all ain't that
[53:11] right so uh Jesus goes on to say in John
[53:16] 14 and 18 and uh let's see sister Lee
[53:21] said you want to read no don't want to
[53:23] read uh let's see sister Jane you want
[53:26] to read all right we'll I might have
[53:29] skipped Levi but we'll get you in a
[53:30] minute
[53:32] um
[53:33] John 14 and 18.
[53:39] through 20.
[53:44] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[53:46] come to you now just stop there what is
[53:49] he saying now
[53:50] he's the one
[53:54] that's going to be the comforter ain't
[53:56] that right amen so he the Holy Ghost
[54:00] he's the one he said I'm coming I'm the
[54:02] one that's going to come to you ain't
[54:04] that right I will not leave you
[54:06] comfortless but notice he Comforts us in
[54:09] a different way
[54:11] than just being with us
[54:13] ain't that right he comforted the
[54:16] disciples by being with them when the
[54:18] storms come he walked on the water he
[54:21] rode the boat and said peace be still
[54:23] when the sick was was uh uh died he's
[54:29] the one that come he was with them ain't
[54:31] that right but he doesn't come to us or
[54:34] Comfort Us by coming to us in his
[54:38] physical body in the physical body of
[54:41] Jesus Christ ain't that right all right
[54:43] sister Jane 19th verse 20. yet a little
[54:47] while in the world seeth me no more that
[54:51] ye see me because I live you shall live
[54:54] also at that day you shall know that I
[54:59] am in the father and ye in me and I in
[55:03] you amen so Jesus is saying he is the
[55:07] comforter and it's in this day that the
[55:10] revelation
[55:12] strikes home
[55:14] that is not three Gods it's one God
[55:17] living in US
[55:20] ain't that right the same God that lived
[55:24] in Jesus Christ in that body now lives
[55:27] in us uh Colossians 1 27 Heather do you
[55:30] want to read that
[55:32] Colossians 1 27
[55:36] this is Paul writing here
[55:52] to whom God would make known what is the
[55:55] riches of the glory of this mystery
[55:57] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[55:59] you the hope of glory amen so who is it
[56:03] Christ in you
[56:06] well Jesus said that the the Holy Ghost
[56:08] which is the comforter will come and
[56:10] come to you
[56:11] right well then Paul is saying it's
[56:14] Christ in you
[56:15] so what is Christ Christ in you is the
[56:20] one God and Father of all
[56:23] above all through all and
[56:27] in you all ain't that right
[56:30] uh uh First Timothy 2 5 and
[56:36] um let's see sister hope you want to
[56:38] read this one first Timothy 2 and 5.
[56:48] for there is one God and one mediator
[56:51] between God and Men the man Christ Jesus
[56:54] so it identifies who that one God is
[56:58] ain't that right there is one God
[57:00] everybody say one God
[57:02] one mediator
[57:04] between God and man
[57:06] now I know that just throws everybody up
[57:09] for a loop there's one God and one
[57:12] mediator between God and man
[57:15] the man Jesus Christ ain't that right
[57:19] now it's not saying he's another God
[57:21] we've already been talking that there's
[57:23] only one God
[57:24] and there's none else besides him ain't
[57:27] that right so God takes on another role
[57:32] and he becomes the mediator
[57:34] he takes on the judge and he takes on
[57:37] the lawyer
[57:39] he becomes judge he becomes a lawyer
[57:41] well it's the same thing he can become a
[57:43] lamb he can become the high priest he
[57:45] can become the Tabernacle he can become
[57:48] whatever he wants to become and if you
[57:50] look it's all this whole Bible the theme
[57:53] of it is Jesus Christ can you say Amen
[57:56] it's God taken on different roles
[58:00] amen so James 2 19
[58:04] and uh
[58:07] uh brother Kevin you want to read this
[58:09] James 2 19.
[58:21] they'll believe us that there is one God
[58:23] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[58:26] and tremble so the devil's got a greater
[58:30] Revelation than a lot of these people
[58:32] around here
[58:33] not in just in the world general for it
[58:37] says the Devils believe that there's one
[58:39] God he's met him
[58:42] he was in heaven
[58:44] he didn't see no three gods
[58:46] he only dealt with one
[58:49] and that God kicked him out
[58:52] ain't that right so there is only one
[58:55] God it's the people that get confused
[58:58] the devil blinds them
[59:00] infuses them James
[59:03] um uh let's see here
[59:05] um Deuteronomy 4 and 39
[59:13] Deuteronomy 4
[59:16] and 39 and uh brother John do you want
[59:21] to read the scripture
[59:23] yeah John Deuteronomy 4
[59:26] 35 and 39.
[59:30] I hope this is okay tonight uh
[59:33] Deuteronomy 4 35
[59:35] and 39.
[59:38] or hath God saved to go and take him a
[59:41] nation from the midst it's Deuteronomy 4
[59:45] 35 is it do you have that I might have
[59:48] wrote it down wrong
[59:51] unto thee it will show that the
[59:54] mightiest know that the Lord he is God
[59:56] and there is none else beside him
[59:59] and then the 39th verse
[1:00:02] note therefore this day and considered
[1:00:04] it in thy heart that the Lord he is God
[1:00:07] in heaven above and above the Earth
[1:00:10] beneath and there is none else amen
[1:00:14] so think of that now the Lord everybody
[1:00:16] say the Lord
[1:00:17] he is God
[1:00:20] there's only we've already read it
[1:00:22] there's only one Lord
[1:00:24] ain't that right the Lord he is God and
[1:00:28] there is none else see why you don't
[1:00:32] need to go Seminary
[1:00:34] somehow they produces more than one God
[1:00:37] know therefore this day and consider it
[1:00:40] in thine heart that the Lord he is God
[1:00:43] in
[1:00:45] heaven
[1:00:46] right and upon the Earth beneath
[1:00:52] there is none else
[1:00:55] amen and you say man now this was in
[1:00:57] this was in Deuteronomy and he's saying
[1:01:00] the Lord is God in heaven and upon Earth
[1:01:02] could this before be foretelling of
[1:01:04] Jesus Christ coming upon the Earth amen
[1:01:07] amen that there's one God Amen in heaven
[1:01:11] and on upon the Earth beneath amen so so
[1:01:17] he's not changed for whatever he is in
[1:01:19] the heavens
[1:01:21] it ain't changed when it comes to the
[1:01:23] Earth
[1:01:24] ain't that right somehow people just get
[1:01:26] it all confused amen but if he's God in
[1:01:29] heaven
[1:01:30] when he comes to this earth and
[1:01:32] manifests himself he doesn't come in
[1:01:34] another person
[1:01:35] he comes as the same God
[1:01:37] one God ain't that right the Lord he is
[1:01:41] God acts 9
[1:01:44] and 1 and Sister Kim Brumfield
[1:01:51] you want to read this
[1:01:52] amen acts 9 1-6
[1:02:11] say one through six yes Acts 9 1 through
[1:02:14] 6.
[1:02:16] and so yet breathing out threatening us
[1:02:19] and Slaughter against the Disciples of
[1:02:21] the Lord went unto the high priest now
[1:02:23] just stop there who now notice this Paul
[1:02:28] is breathing out threatenings and
[1:02:31] Slaughter against the Disciples of who
[1:02:35] the Lord one Lord right
[1:02:39] Okay so
[1:02:41] uh
[1:02:43] uh go ahead uh second verse and desire
[1:02:46] to him letters to Damascus to the
[1:02:48] synagogues that if he found any of this
[1:02:51] way whether they were men or women he
[1:02:54] might bring them bound into Jerusalem
[1:02:56] and as he journeyed he came near
[1:02:58] Damascus and suddenly there shined round
[1:03:00] about him a light from heaven and he
[1:03:03] fell to the Earth and heard a voice
[1:03:05] saying unto him Saul Saul why persecuted
[1:03:09] found me now right there now he he's the
[1:03:12] Bible just says he's going after the
[1:03:14] Lord right after the Disciples of the
[1:03:16] Lord and yet the voice is saying you're
[1:03:19] persecuting me ain't that right
[1:03:22] okay fifth verse and he said
[1:03:26] he said Lord and the Lord said I am
[1:03:28] Jesus and now persecute us it is hard
[1:03:31] for thee to kick against the Pricks and
[1:03:33] he trembling and astonished said Lord
[1:03:36] what will they'll have me to do and the
[1:03:38] Lord said unto him arise and go into the
[1:03:41] City and it shall be told thee with thou
[1:03:44] must too now he's talking to the the
[1:03:47] person that he's com that he is
[1:03:49] persecuting
[1:03:50] ain't that right and he says who art
[1:03:53] thou Lord is he talking to a different
[1:03:55] to a different Lord than what was of the
[1:03:57] of of the Old Testament we read that
[1:04:00] there was that there's only one Lord and
[1:04:02] there's none else besides him
[1:04:04] well Paul is is he's a scholar in the
[1:04:07] Old Testament uh teachings so he knows
[1:04:10] what Lord he's not saying Lords or which
[1:04:14] Lord are you he's addressing as there's
[1:04:17] only one Lord who art thou Lord he's
[1:04:20] he's not worried about okay now which
[1:04:22] one which Lord are you now so I can get
[1:04:24] this right no he only knows one Lord and
[1:04:27] he's approaching him as the one that he
[1:04:29] knows who art thou Lord and so this one
[1:04:33] Lord introduces himself to Paul as Jesus
[1:04:37] I am Jesus can you say Amen so now we
[1:04:42] know who the Lord really is he's the god
[1:04:44] of the Old Testament and there is none
[1:04:47] else and as we've been taught that
[1:04:50] Jehovah of the old is John Jesus of the
[1:04:54] new
[1:04:54] ain't that right uh First Kings 8 and 59
[1:05:01] um my guy oh you can get the microphone
[1:05:05] now and uh First Kings 8 and 59 and
[1:05:10] um
[1:05:11] Mark Smith you want to read
[1:05:16] First Kings 8 and 59.
[1:05:26] through 60. 59 and 60.
[1:05:48] so now Paul is is is talking to the Lord
[1:05:54] he's persecuting the Disciples of the
[1:05:57] Lord
[1:05:58] and
[1:05:59] we find out that he's not just
[1:06:01] persecuting you see when you touch the
[1:06:03] children of God you're touching God
[1:06:04] himself
[1:06:06] and so he's he's uh after the disciples
[1:06:10] of the Lord ain't that right that's what
[1:06:13] the Bible says here breathing out
[1:06:15] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[1:06:17] Disciples of the Lord but we found out
[1:06:19] he was persecuting Jesus Christ by
[1:06:22] persecuting them and are you ready all
[1:06:25] right First Kings 8 59 and 60. and let
[1:06:28] these my words wherewith I have made
[1:06:30] supplication before the Lord be nigh
[1:06:32] unto the Lord Our God day and night that
[1:06:35] he maintained the cause of his servant
[1:06:37] and the cause of his people Israel at
[1:06:39] all times as the matter shall require
[1:06:41] that all the people of the earth may
[1:06:43] know that the Lord is God and that there
[1:06:46] is none else amen
[1:06:48] so that's Bible right so does the bible
[1:06:51] contradict itself or can we actually
[1:06:54] rest upon the Bible
[1:06:56] Old and New Testament you we should be
[1:06:59] able to rest upon the Bible on thus
[1:07:02] saith the Lord
[1:07:03] amen so so the Lord is God and there is
[1:07:08] none else ain't that right and Jesus as
[1:07:14] the Bible says was the in was the image
[1:07:16] of the invisible God the visible image
[1:07:20] of the invisible God that human body was
[1:07:23] the Tabernacle of God himself
[1:07:26] ain't that right amen so uh Isaiah 45
[1:07:32] and 5 and uh brother Enoch you want to
[1:07:37] read
[1:07:39] uh all right Isaiah 45 and 5 through 7.
[1:07:45] amen
[1:08:02] this is a different
[1:08:04] um lesson
[1:08:06] it's not the King James version so
[1:08:12] well you you you you read it and then
[1:08:14] I'll give the uh King James translation
[1:08:17] oh okay so Isaiah 5 7 I create both
[1:08:21] light and darkness
[1:08:23] I bring both blessing and disaster
[1:08:27] I the Lord do all these things I will
[1:08:31] send Victory from the sky like rain
[1:08:34] the Earth will open to receive it and
[1:08:38] will Blossom with freedom and Justice I
[1:08:41] the Lord will make this happen
[1:08:43] amen so so here uh
[1:08:48] Isaiah 45 and 5 through 7. it says I'm
[1:08:52] going to read the King James translation
[1:08:54] I am the Lord everybody say I am the
[1:08:57] Lord
[1:08:57] and there is none else
[1:09:00] ain't that right now this is the Old
[1:09:02] Testament now so what Paul was
[1:09:04] persecuting was the same word of that of
[1:09:08] that Isaiah is talking about
[1:09:11] there is none else there is no God
[1:09:14] beside me I girded thee though thou Hast
[1:09:17] not known me
[1:09:19] that they may know from the rising of
[1:09:22] the Sun and from the West that there is
[1:09:24] none beside me I mean he's really making
[1:09:28] that clear there's none besides him
[1:09:31] I am the lord and there is none else
[1:09:36] I form the light and create Darkness so
[1:09:39] he's the Creator I make peace and create
[1:09:42] evil I the Lord do all these things
[1:09:48] ain't that right so in the beginning God
[1:09:51] created heavens and earth so we now know
[1:09:53] it's the Lord that created the heavens
[1:09:56] and earth the same God that Paul or that
[1:09:59] Saul persecuted in the New Testament
[1:10:02] and was introduced as Jesus ain't that
[1:10:04] right
[1:10:05] Isaiah 45 and 18.
[1:10:10] praise the Lord
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:14] brother Bill do you want to read this
[1:10:16] one as well
[1:10:18] Isaiah 45 and 18.
[1:10:35] for thus saith the Lord that created the
[1:10:39] heavens
[1:10:40] God himself that formed the Earth and
[1:10:42] made it
[1:10:44] he hath established it he created it not
[1:10:47] in vain
[1:10:48] he formed it to be inhabited I am the
[1:10:52] lord and there is none else none else
[1:10:55] none else aren't you glad for that
[1:10:59] so again we'd read in Ephesians 4 5 it
[1:11:03] tells us that there is one Lord
[1:11:05] amen so Genesis
[1:11:09] 2 and 4 I'm just going to skip through
[1:11:12] this because Genesis 2 and 4 tells us
[1:11:15] that the Lord God made the earth and the
[1:11:19] heavens
[1:11:20] the seventh verse of Genesis 2 tells us
[1:11:24] that the Lord God
[1:11:26] formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground
[1:11:30] the eighth verse and the Lord God
[1:11:33] planted a garden Eastward in the uh in
[1:11:39] the garden ain't that right so all
[1:11:41] throughout the second chapter of Genesis
[1:11:44] tells us that it was the Lord God Amen
[1:11:48] the Lord God and then from there your
[1:11:51] your you read scriptures after
[1:11:53] scriptures that tells us there's only
[1:11:55] one Lord there's only one God and it's
[1:11:58] not just in the Old Testament it's in
[1:12:00] the New Testament as well ain't that
[1:12:02] right Isaiah 40 and 1 through 3. brother
[1:12:07] Terry do you want to read that one for
[1:12:09] us
[1:12:10] Isaiah 41 and 1 through 3.
[1:12:16] Isaiah 41-3 40 and one yes sir
[1:12:22] 40 verse 1. yes not 41. right right
[1:12:25] sorry my fault okay Comfort ye Comfort
[1:12:29] ye my people saith your God speak ye
[1:12:32] comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto
[1:12:34] her
[1:12:36] that her Warfare is accomplished that
[1:12:39] her iniquity is pardoned for she hath
[1:12:42] received of the Lord's hand double for
[1:12:44] her sins
[1:12:47] through
[1:12:48] and then third verse the voice of him
[1:12:51] that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye
[1:12:53] the way of the Lord make straight in the
[1:12:57] desert a highway for our God Amen so
[1:13:01] here there's a voice that's crying
[1:13:04] prepare ye the way
[1:13:06] of who
[1:13:08] the Lord which Lord
[1:13:11] one Lord the Lord that created the
[1:13:13] heavens and the Earth ain't that right
[1:13:16] now there's going to be somebody come on
[1:13:18] the scene to prepare the way for him
[1:13:21] amen that's right same Lord now Malachi
[1:13:25] 3 1
[1:13:27] and brother Amos you want to read that
[1:13:29] for us Malachi 3 1.
[1:13:45] behold I will send my messenger
[1:13:48] and he shall prepare the way before me
[1:13:52] in the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly
[1:13:54] come to his Temple
[1:13:56] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[1:13:58] you Delight in behold he shall come
[1:14:01] saith the Lord of hosts
[1:14:04] so what is the scripture prophesying of
[1:14:07] the coming Messiah
[1:14:09] ain't that right and who was the Messiah
[1:14:12] Jesus
[1:14:13] the Lord shall suddenly the Lord shall
[1:14:17] suddenly come to his Temple amen so the
[1:14:21] Lord is prophesying of his own coming
[1:14:23] and John the Baptist was the messenger
[1:14:27] to prepare the way you believe that well
[1:14:30] let's look John 1 19.
[1:14:34] amen John 1 19
[1:14:37] uh let's see I didn't even get brother
[1:14:39] Jr or sister Brooke praise the Lord bro
[1:14:41] June you want to read this one
[1:14:43] amen John 1 19 through 23.
[1:14:55] and this is the record of John when the
[1:14:57] Jews sent priests and Levites from
[1:15:00] Jerusalem to ask him who art thou
[1:15:03] and he confessed and denied not but
[1:15:05] confessed I am not the Christ and they
[1:15:09] asked him what then art thou Elias and
[1:15:11] he saith I am not
[1:15:13] art thou that prophet and he answered no
[1:15:17] then said they unto him who art thou
[1:15:20] that we may give an answer to them that
[1:15:22] send us what sayeth thou of thyself he
[1:15:26] said I am the voice of one crying in the
[1:15:27] wilderness make straight the way of the
[1:15:30] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah's amen
[1:15:33] so
[1:15:35] he wasn't that Prophet which they they
[1:15:37] were referring to the Messiah or thou
[1:15:40] the Messiah that Prophet for the Messiah
[1:15:42] was to be a prophet ain't that right but
[1:15:44] he says no I am the voice I am that
[1:15:47] voice of one in the wilderness crying
[1:15:51] out prepare ye the way of the Lord make
[1:15:54] straight the way of the Lord amen so
[1:15:58] Luke 1 76 and sister Jane you want to
[1:16:04] read this one
[1:16:05] Luke 1 76
[1:16:34] and thou shalt be called the prophet of
[1:16:37] the highest for Thou shalt go before the
[1:16:39] face of the Lord and prepare his ways
[1:16:43] amen so here and thou child speaking of
[1:16:47] John the Baptist shall be called the
[1:16:49] prophet of the highest for Thou shalt go
[1:16:52] before what
[1:16:54] the face of the Lord to prepare
[1:16:59] his ways ain't that right
[1:17:02] now if you want to go to Philippians 2
[1:17:06] and 9 and uh sister Brooke do you want
[1:17:10] to read that one
[1:17:11] through 11 Philippians 2 9 through 11
[1:17:15] this is speaking of Jesus
[1:17:19] thank you
[1:17:23] amen wherefore God also hath highly
[1:17:28] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:17:30] is above every name that at the name of
[1:17:33] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[1:17:36] heaven and things in Earth and things
[1:17:38] under the Earth
[1:17:40] and that every tongue should confess
[1:17:42] that the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord to
[1:17:45] the glory of God the Father amen so who
[1:17:49] is Lord
[1:17:50] Jesus Christ who did John prepare the
[1:17:53] face of
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ he prepared the way
[1:17:57] was Jesus Christ ain't that right
[1:18:00] amen so uh then you look at Romans 14
[1:18:05] 11.
[1:18:07] and uh Josiah you want to read this one
[1:18:10] Romans 14 11.
[1:18:12] oops I forgot Mindy too he's hiding back
[1:18:15] there is what you're doing
[1:18:17] so Romans 14 11
[1:18:26] . so we just read that Jesus Christ is
[1:18:29] Lord
[1:18:33] for it is written as I live as I live as
[1:18:37] I live as I live saith the Lord every
[1:18:40] knee shall bow to me and every tongue
[1:18:42] shall confess to God Amen so who's going
[1:18:45] to ever need is going to bow to who
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ
[1:18:50] now it says as I live saith the Lord
[1:18:52] ever and he shall bow to me and we just
[1:18:53] read that Jesus Christ is Lord and
[1:18:57] there's only one Lord ain't that right
[1:18:59] so we look as well as Zechariah 14 and
[1:19:04] 9. and I hope this is a help to you
[1:19:07] someone anyways but Zechariah 14 and 9
[1:19:11] and uh don't see Brittany back there
[1:19:14] she's really hiding uh

[1:19:25] plain sight you want to read this uh
[1:19:27] Zechariah
[1:19:29] 14 and 9.
[1:19:35] thought she'd get out of it
[1:19:38] and the Lord shall be king over all the
[1:19:41] Earth in that day shall there be one
[1:19:44] Lord at his name one
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:47] and the Lord shall be what
[1:19:51] King over all the Earth and in that day
[1:19:55] there shall be one Lord and his name one
[1:20:00] you know that Revelation is going to
[1:20:02] strike home and everybody's going to
[1:20:05] know
[1:20:06] will be one
[1:20:07] one can you say Amen John 1 29 and
[1:20:13] sister Mindy you want to read this John
[1:20:15] 1 29 and 36.
[1:20:28] John 1 29 and also 36.
[1:20:39] the next day John seeth Jesus coming
[1:20:42] unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of
[1:20:46] God which taketh away the sin of the
[1:20:48] world
[1:20:51] and this 36th verse
[1:20:53] and looking Upon Jesus as he walked to
[1:20:56] seeth Behold the Lamb of God Amen so
[1:20:59] who's the Lamb of God
[1:21:01] Jesus that's right so I think we could
[1:21:03] all agree to that Revelation 17 14.
[1:21:09] Amen brother Kevin you want to read this
[1:21:11] one Revelation 17 and 14.
[1:21:28] these shall make war with the lamb and
[1:21:30] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:21:32] Lord of lords and king of kings and they
[1:21:34] that are with him are called and chosen
[1:21:36] and faithful amen so we John introduced
[1:21:40] the lamb to us Jesus Christ ain't that
[1:21:44] right
[1:21:45] and these are going to make war with the
[1:21:47] lamb amen and the lamb shall overcome
[1:21:50] them why for he is Lord of lords
[1:21:55] he's King of Kings ain't that right
[1:22:00] above all
[1:22:02] through all
[1:22:04] and in all Amen in you all that's what
[1:22:08] he says in you all ain't that right
[1:22:10] so so the father was in the son John 14
[1:22:14] 7 if you want to turn there and brother
[1:22:19] John you want to read this
[1:22:21] uh John 14 7 through 11.

[1:22:39] excited look and
[1:22:41] you're in the next
[1:22:46] if you had no if he had known me you
[1:22:49] should have known my father also and
[1:22:51] from henceforth you know him have seen
[1:22:55] him
[1:22:55] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[1:22:58] father and it's a sufficient us suffice
[1:23:02] the sufficeiveness she just said unto
[1:23:04] him have I been so long time with you
[1:23:06] and yet has thou not know me Philip he
[1:23:10] said that has seen me has seen the
[1:23:12] father and how saith thou then show us
[1:23:15] the father
[1:23:18] I believe it's thou amount that I am
[1:23:20] in the father and the father in me and
[1:23:23] the words I'm speaking to you I speak
[1:23:25] not to myself but the father that
[1:23:27] dwelleth in me he doeth thee Works
[1:23:29] believe me that I am in the father and
[1:23:32] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:23:35] he he the very Works sake amen so who
[1:23:39] was in the Sun
[1:23:41] the father amen
[1:23:44] one God and Father above all through all
[1:23:47] and in you all amen
[1:23:51] Faith second Corinthians 5 19.
[1:24:04] to with that God was in Christ
[1:24:07] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:24:10] in putting their
[1:24:12] trespasses unto them and had committed
[1:24:14] unto us the word of reconciliation
[1:24:18] amen so God was in Christ
[1:24:22] reconciling the world to himself first
[1:24:25] Timothy 3 16 and Judah
[1:24:32] I know I couldn't see your head but I
[1:24:34] knew he was back there
[1:24:36] First Timothy 3 16.
[1:24:43] and without controversy great is the
[1:24:46] mystery of godliness God was manifested
[1:24:49] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[1:24:51] seeing of angels preached unto the
[1:24:53] Gentiles
[1:24:55] believed on in the world received it
[1:24:59] into Glory
[1:25:00] amen so without controversy everybody
[1:25:03] say without controversy great
[1:25:06] is the mystery of godliness
[1:25:09] God was manifested in the flesh God was
[1:25:14] justified in the spirit God was seen of
[1:25:18] angels God preached unto the Gentiles
[1:25:22] God believed on in the world and God
[1:25:26] received up
[1:25:28] into Glory
[1:25:30] can you say Amen
[1:25:32] amen see so Jesus said the father was in
[1:25:37] him
[1:25:38] Paul says it was God that was in Christ
[1:25:40] he also said God manifested In the Flesh
[1:25:43] and received up into glory and great is
[1:25:48] the mystery of godliness ain't that
[1:25:51] right if we just a few more scriptures
[1:25:54] and then we'll close Isaiah 43 and 3 and
[1:26:01] um
[1:26:02] um Heather you want to read this Isaiah
[1:26:05] 43 3 and 11.
[1:26:11] for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One
[1:26:14] of Israel thy savior I gave Egypt for
[1:26:17] thy Ransom Ethiopia and siba for the
[1:26:22] I even I am the Lord and beside me there
[1:26:25] is no savior
[1:26:27] so who is he
[1:26:29] he's our savior
[1:26:31] he's the Lord
[1:26:33] he's our savior and there's none other
[1:26:35] ain't that right for he said beside me
[1:26:38] there is no savior
[1:26:42] all right Isaiah 45 and 21 brother
[1:26:45] Branson you want to read this 45 Isaiah
[1:26:48] 45 21-23
[1:26:55] here yay let them take counsel together
[1:26:58] who hath declared this from ancient time
[1:27:00] who had told it from that time who not
[1:27:03] have not I the lord and there is no God
[1:27:06] else besides me a just God and a savior
[1:27:09] there's none beside me
[1:27:13] 22 and 23. look unto me and be saved all
[1:27:17] the ends of the Earth for I am God and
[1:27:19] there is none else I've sworn by myself
[1:27:21] the word has gone out of my mouth and
[1:27:23] righteousness and shall not return that
[1:27:25] that unto me every knee shall bow every
[1:27:27] tongue shall answer or shall swear amen
[1:27:30] so every knee is going to bow
[1:27:35] to God
[1:27:37] and savior
[1:27:39] and his name is
[1:27:41] Jesus Christ
[1:27:42] Jesus said I come in my father's name
[1:27:44] ain't that right
[1:27:46] all right Isaiah 49 and 26 uh and
[1:27:55] everybody wanted to make sure you got in
[1:27:57] this thing so Isaiah 49 and 26
[1:28:01] .
[1:28:06] and I will feed them that oppressed thee
[1:28:09] with their own flesh and they that shall
[1:28:11] be drunken with their own blood as with
[1:28:13] sweet wine and All Flesh shall know that
[1:28:16] I the Lord and thy Savior and thy
[1:28:18] Redeemer the mighty one of Jacob amen
[1:28:21] All Flesh
[1:28:23] All Flesh shall know ain't that right
[1:28:26] there's going to come a time that
[1:28:28] everyone's going to recognize what we
[1:28:30] know already and I am so glad that we
[1:28:33] know it now and we don't have to wait
[1:28:35] until some other time amen when it's too
[1:28:37] late but all flesh is going to know he
[1:28:40] says that I am the Lord
[1:28:43] am I the Lord am thy Savior and thy
[1:28:46] Redeemer all right Hosea 13 and 4 Daniel
[1:28:52] you want to read this Hosea 13 and 4.
[1:29:04] man these boys are doing a good job
[1:29:09] they think so too
[1:29:14] Hosea 13 and 4. yet I am the Lord thy
[1:29:18] God from the land of Egypt and thou
[1:29:20] shalt know no God but me
[1:29:22] for there is no savior beside me amen
[1:29:26] so God had established himself in in the
[1:29:31] Old Testament to Israel that there is no
[1:29:33] other God
[1:29:35] and that's what he's been drawn to do
[1:29:37] for the Gentiles is to know there is no
[1:29:40] other God
[1:29:41] besides him and there's no other savior
[1:29:43] ain't that right
[1:29:45] now acts 5 and 30 uh sister Anna you
[1:29:50] want to read this acts 5 30 through 31.
[1:30:02] the god of our fathers raised up Jesus
[1:30:04] whom you slew and hanged on a tree him
[1:30:07] that God exalted with his right hand to
[1:30:09] be a prince and a savior for to give
[1:30:11] repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
[1:30:13] sins amen so it tells us who's the
[1:30:16] savior the god of our fathers raised up
[1:30:20] who
[1:30:21] Jesus whom you slew and hanged on a tree
[1:30:24] him hath God exalted with his right hand
[1:30:28] to be a prince and a savior
[1:30:34] what was it God in Christ
[1:30:38] reconciling the world to himself ain't

[1:31:12] Lord Jesus Christ so who's who's the one
[1:31:15] we're looking forward to
[1:31:17] the Lord Jesus Christ amen now we've
[1:31:21] been blessed because the Jews only know
[1:31:24] one God one Savior and they're still
[1:31:27] looking for him
[1:31:28] right they don't believe that Jesus
[1:31:31] Christ is the savior
[1:31:33] they don't believe that he that that he
[1:31:34] he was God they believe good man or
[1:31:36] whatever but we've been given that
[1:31:38] revelation of who he is so now we're not

[1:38:16] serving divers lust and Pleasures living
[1:38:19] in Malice and in the hateful and hating
[1:38:23] one another but after the kind after
[1:38:26] that the kindness and the love of God
[1:38:28] our savior
[1:38:30] uh toward a man appeared not by works of
[1:38:35] righteousness which we have done but
[1:38:36] according to his Mercy he saved us by
[1:38:40] the washing of regeneration and renewing
[1:38:42] of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us
[1:38:44] abundantly through Jesus Christ Our

[1:40:42] my breath my sunshine
[1:40:48] my all in all
[1:40:52] all
[1:40:53] the great creator
[1:41:00] became my savior

[1:41:08] fullness
[1:41:11] dwell is in him
[1:41:16] amen he is so wonderful
[1:41:20] if you'd like to turn with me to First
[1:41:23] Corinthians we could just stand to our
[1:41:25] feet and as we get ready to take
[1:41:30] communion
[1:41:32] communion is a a sacred thing an
[1:41:36] honorable
[1:41:38] thing that we would take by commandment
[1:41:41] of Our Lord
[1:41:42] and
[1:41:45] we know and realize that only those that
[1:41:51] are filled with the Holy Ghost you must
[1:41:54] as the the scriptures require
[1:41:58] and the prophet has taught us that the
[1:42:01] Holy Ghost demand needs to have the Holy
[1:42:03] Ghost in order to take this
[1:42:06] because it's it's a partaking
[1:42:10] uh it's a symbol a partaking of our Lord
[1:42:14] and
[1:42:15] his word his spirit
[1:42:18] and of course we know what the wine
[1:42:21] represents it's his blood we do not take
[1:42:24] juice
[1:42:26] um
[1:42:27] uh as maybe others do they they use
[1:42:33] grape juice or whatever but we know that
[1:42:35] that's that can sour that can spoil but
[1:42:40] wine
[1:42:41] is a representation because it does not
[1:42:44] spoil and
[1:42:47] um and so we we use wine Jesus used wine
[1:42:51] uh but it represents his blood it is not
[1:42:54] the blood of the Lord as some would
[1:42:58] think it they can have the power to
[1:43:01] change it into the blood but it is
[1:43:03] symbolic of the blood
[1:43:05] and we take the bread as in symbolic to
[1:43:09] the word of God
[1:43:11] but it is not the body of Christ but it
[1:43:14] is symbolic amen so First Corinthians
[1:43:17] the 11th chapter and the 23rd verse
[1:43:21] we'll start there
[1:43:24] but it says for I have received of the
[1:43:26] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:43:29] you
[1:43:30] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:43:33] which he was betrayed it took bread
[1:43:35] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:43:38] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:43:41] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:43:44] of me
[1:43:46] and after the same manner he also took
[1:43:49] the cup when he had suped saying this
[1:43:52] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:43:57] this do ye as oft as you drink it in
[1:44:00] remembrance of me
[1:44:02] for as often as you drink or as you eat
[1:44:05] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:44:08] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:44:12] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:44:14] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:44:16] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:44:19] and blood of the Lord
[1:44:20] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:44:23] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:44:25] cup
[1:44:26] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:44:28] unworthily eat us and drinketh Damnation
[1:44:30] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:44:33] body
[1:44:34] for this calls many are weak and sickly
[1:44:37] among you and many sleep for if we would
[1:44:41] be judged or if we would judge ourselves
[1:44:44] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:44:47] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:44:49] we should not be condemned with the
[1:44:51] world
[1:44:52] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:44:54] together to eat Terry one for another
[1:44:56] and if you any man hunger let him eat at
[1:44:59] home
[1:45:00] that ye come not together unto
[1:45:02] condemnation and I the rest well I said
[1:45:05] in order when I come
[1:45:08] and so
[1:45:10] we know that Isaiah believed the prophet
[1:45:13] talked about uh
[1:45:15] the tables being full of vomit
[1:45:18] and and uh these things and here you
[1:45:23] know uh with all of their man-made
[1:45:27] doctrines and people living just any way
[1:45:30] they want to live and and not according
[1:45:34] to the word of God and you know uh
[1:45:37] they're holding on to traditions and
[1:45:40] Creeds and you got people smoking and
[1:45:43] drinking and gambling and swearing and
[1:45:46] committing adultery and
[1:45:48] uh just so wrapped up in Hollywood and
[1:45:52] and all of these things and then they
[1:45:54] come taking the Lord's supper and it has
[1:45:57] no meaning no value in what they're
[1:46:00] doing but we are to to do this in
[1:46:02] remembrance of the Lord remembrance of
[1:46:05] what he has done remembrance of what he
[1:46:07] is and who he is and what he is to us a
[1:46:11] man he saved us he redeemed us he he
[1:46:14] bought us with the price ain't that
[1:46:16] right and and we're partaking of this uh
[1:46:20] as a symbol that we're partaking in
[1:46:23] fellowship with Jesus Christ and you
[1:46:26] know of course we we're all Sinners and
[1:46:29] when I say that we we're failures we we
[1:46:32] make mistakes and all of these things
[1:46:34] but it's it's something that we've read
[1:46:37] and many times where we don't do it and
[1:46:39] if we do sin we have a covenant we have
[1:46:41] a uh uh an intercessor an atonement a
[1:46:46] man that that when we repent of these
[1:46:48] sins the blood is there to cover a saint
[1:46:51] that Ryan and so we come boldly uh not
[1:46:55] not irreverently but we come boldly
[1:46:57] partaking of these things knowing in our
[1:47:00] hearts that that all of our sins are
[1:47:03] under the blood and and that we're not
[1:47:05] doing this in a mockery in in spite but
[1:47:08] we're really taking God in a serious way
[1:47:11] amen so uh if there's anything in your
[1:47:15] heart that that needs to be made right
[1:47:17] amen I I think it this is this is the
[1:47:20] time to do it if we never if we ever
[1:47:23] need to get sincere this is the time to
[1:47:27] say Lord I I want to be more sincere
[1:47:29] than I ever have if you've been playing
[1:47:32] games don't play games with God Amen so
[1:47:36] let's just bow our heads and you you
[1:47:38] just talk to the Lord in your own heart
[1:47:40] and then we'll pray
[1:47:50] father
[1:47:52] as we approach this sacred time
[1:47:57] lord it's an honor to be able to take
[1:48:00] these Lords
[1:48:03] as our heart is yearning for you Lord
[1:48:05] and how we love just to sit at your feet
[1:48:10] Lord and just to partake of your words
[1:48:13] for your words are life

[1:48:23] father we're living off of you Lord for
[1:48:27] your spirit and life
[1:48:29] and Lord we're doing this in remembrance
[1:48:32] of what you've done at Calvary
[1:48:34] Lord You're our savior Our Redeemer
[1:48:38] we have fallen in love with you no
[1:48:40] matter how long ago it was that we gave
[1:48:42] our hearts to you lord it's a continual
[1:48:44] thing with this
[1:48:46] father
[1:48:48] every day we just want to fall in love
[1:48:50] with you over and over
[1:48:52] if there's any sins Lord that is not
[1:48:55] covered by your blood we pray
[1:48:57] that you'd forgive us of them Lord
[1:49:00] that your blood would atone for us
[1:49:02] father
[1:49:03] help us Lord to be more sincere than we
[1:49:06] ever have
[1:49:08] help us Lord to deny the world
[1:49:11] Lord our habits father things Lord that
[1:49:14] has been trying and testing us and
[1:49:17] whatever it would be help us just to
[1:49:19] deny them and cut it all off that we may
[1:49:23] serve you holy
[1:49:24] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[1:49:28] amen and amen praise the Lord you can be
[1:49:33] seated here and
