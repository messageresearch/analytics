can be dismissed it's good to be here Amen in the house of the Lord and good to see everyone good to have brother Tim sister Martha back and with us and uh brother John Sister Kim and um back with us amen and uh well just everyone and always uh good to have brother Eli with us amen and amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to first of all the the book of Acts amen and um we want to keep uh brother Amos Sister Lisa uh in our prayers they're in Canada there and um I guess most heard brother Christian lost his father Friday evening and um a sudden thing there uh sitting in his chair and uh went uh just passed out and time they got him into the hospital uh he was deceased and so the family is just really really struggling right now and um so we really want to keep them in our prayer and um you know if you uh have brother Christian's number uh I think it would be good just to keep him encouraged and um you know keeping contact with him and uh I I'm sure it would be a help uh to him and um amen I that's I think that's what the body of Christ is for is when one suffers we all suffer when one rejoices we all Rejoice we want to pray for the homes family as well as uh the uh the um was his name brother William Holmes Nathaniel Nathaniel Amen brother Nathaniel had passed away and and um that family just really needs our prayer as well and just a tragic thing and uh but they'll be having the funeral tomorrow and so I I know they're going to need your prayers uh brother Christian uh father the funeral uh for the father will be um uh Thursday morning and so um Judah and I are going to try to go up uh there sometime tomorrow afternoon and visit with the family and so we just cover your prayers amen and uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads unto the Lord and talk to him father this is a troubled world that we live in and Lord we're no strangers to heartache and sadness and troubles and because of that we can feel for others Lord that are in need and father just asking that you would touch both families here the uh brother Christian's family his mom M his brother Him Father give them strength give them comfort as the days ahead is going to be tough father I know they're probably just in shock of what's happened such a sudden thing but Lord you knew before the foundation of the world this would happen and you laid in the scripture your promise that you would be our comforter in these times and that you wouldd never leave us nor forsake us father may they see you in this Lord and may they may not understand it but may they trust you knowing that you have it all worked out Lord pray that you would help the homes family fathers they're just going through such a tragic time such a loss such a a thing Lord and I know Satan is there working on their minds but I pray that you'd give them strength in this Lord and help them tomorrow as they would bury their loved one and father I pray that just silence the enemy that would come to their mind and try to get them just to lay down and quit father give them strength Lord and I pray Lord that you would just move father in the service this morning as we have felt your presence here through the songs the worship father and how we thankful for that but now we just ask that you would just move in the ministering of your word anoint Lord father not only me but anoint your people Lord help me to speak what you would want me to speak and nothing else Lord father we give it to you now we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen the book of Acts the first chapter uh we're going to just read a u familiar scripture we had read it last Sunday but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and then if you'll turn with me to the Book of John the first chapter the um John 1 and uh we'll start at the uh 10th verse he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of will the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God Amen aren't you glad for that amen you can have your seats this morning and um uh sure thank the Lord for watching over brother Mark amen and just hearing the testimony there and uh we also want to remember um Fellowship after the service for those that would like to going to just meet I guess be up the road at what they call the Frog Pond and uh so uh if you're able to make it there uh we'd love to have you and um last Sunday we had taken up uh an offering for those that were affected by the hurricane Helen and um you know just uh as you all know just a real Devastation there and from what I hear they're still finding uh bodies and different things and uh it's just a a sad deal and um but uh we we had taken up about $500 and and so uh I do appreciate um you giving uh there and then also brother Daniel and sister Britany took some clothing and other articles or whatever there to brother Reagan's as they are uh kind of involved in the operation of dispersing or Distributing things out and um and and so it it is uh deeply appreciated um we will probably be taking up uh another offering next week uh for those that would like to give and and things and um we have decided instead of just giving cash uh we'll probably uh just go buy stuff they they've got a list of things that they need uh flashlights um coats um uh you know um I don't know other things to Charcoal there's a lot of folks that are without houses uh been their houses destroyed and also um you know uh they didn't have flood insurance so many of them are going to have to rebuild on their own and uh so we we had thought about trying to talk to some of these stores here and see if they'd be willing to give it in bulk or or whatever see if they will help and um I think that would be better than just giving cash uh there so uh we we do want to remember them in our prayer and um as one said uh you know uh there on the news um said you know it's so easy to look at it now and see the need but we always it's so easy to forget uh down the road and and these people are going to be needing help for a long time and um and so and I know they're going to need our prayer so uh anyways we just want to remember that uh because it could be us it could be us without homes it could be us in trouble and uh we would certainly appreciate all the help people can give uh also I do want to thank you for the the gift card uh I didn't know it was pastor's appreciation day uh I guess that's uh today and uh brother Mark uh sent thank you and things and and so I I certainly appreciate it and then I found a uh gift card there on my desk this morning and from the church and uh so thank you very much and we we love and appreciate each and everyone amen and um I'm just glad to be a part of you amen and uh uh you know uh it's it's it's almost going home time I you know can't stress that enough but uh we're we're just about ready to cross the finish line and um I I I want to cross it with you I want to to to make it amen and not only me but you and we all just be around the Throne of God together amen and uh so anyway the the uh the thing here uh that we've read uh first of all Jesus said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and the title I guess that I would have is the the church has the same Authority as Christ and then it says uh as many as received him gave he the power to become Sons and we've talked about it before of course we dealt with it last Sunday but the word power means Authority it's not it's not necessarily muscle it's it's uh but it's an authority it's it's a government it's something that uh this this word Authority I looked it up it's it's legal power or a right to command or to act amen a warrant an order or permission so so I I thought that was pretty powerful uh that's what we have we have the legal right to be sons of God we have the right to command or to act uh and we have the permission and and we have been given an order amen I like that it been given an order it's not just a wish that God had it's it's a command it's a in order this is this is what you are are in in uh uh in the age that we're living in you are sons of God Amen and so only the sons of God have the authority to be what they are and to do what they do in line with the scriptures amen and that's what sons of God are they they act they do they live within line of the scriptures amen and and so who who are the sons of God it is they are the gene seed of God it's a literal it's it's something that it's not a make belief it's not something that we imagine it is it you are literally Sons and Daughters of God it's it's just that's that's powerful when we can really think of it that way we're not trying to be the bill we we're not trying to be this we are sons of God and and so sons of God they they are an attribute of God's thinking um and and it's they are an eternal thought for uh uh God's thoughts are Eternal and they are real so it's not just a passing thought it's an eternal thought and once that thought was conceived in God's mind it it's forever it that's that's just way it is and so uh we we come sons of God come from the premeditated thoughts of God Amen and so as as Jesus was the predestinated son of God so are we the predestinated Sons and Daughters of God and and uh uh of course you know the Bible uses the word Sons but uh uh that that uh that includes all of us here so we're all Sons or and daughters we put it that way but uh so so Jesus was predestinated to be the Son of God he was predestinated to be the Lamb of God he was predestinated to be uh uh the the the sacrifice he was predestinated to be the word made flesh the son of man he was predestinated to be the the the the the priest uh the king the uh the the intercessor uh uh the prophet he he was predestinated to be what he was and to do what he did he was predestinated to be crucified to be buried and and to rise again amen 1 Peter 1:20 tells us that he was foreordained before the foundation of the world not that he should just exist in life but his his life was already foreordained everything that he was to be and and to do was foreordained by God Amen and and so therefore uh uh he was for ordained before the foundation of the world he didn't just become the lamb and he was for ordained to be the lamb he he just didn't stumble into things in life he he was for or ordained to be that before the foundation of the world and the scriptures forto of him of what he would do and and and what he would be and and John uh 5:39 Jesus would say search the scriptures for they testify of me the scriptures testified of of him and so this shows that he was predestinated because this is God's thoughts in seed form the word is God's thoughts and Seed form and so therefore if he was in the thinking of God then he had to be in the written uh word of God Amen and and so no wonder the scriptures would tell of him and foretell of what he would be and and so this this word predestinate to predestinate means to for orain to an Earthly or Eternal lot or destiny by Divine decree Amen to appoint to limit in advance to ordain to PR uh to predetermine so even even his resurrection and his his suffering and and his death was all predetermined of God and and and and and the time of his death and the length of his death was already predetermined so there was a limit to to that death uh uh for he said in Psalms I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption or leave his soul in hell so so then Jesus knew that that scripture pertained of him so he knew he would rise within that three-day period because corruption had it had already been spoken that corruption would not set in can you say amen and and so the script was written of him before he ever came to the Earth and and then the prophet would say he said he came to fulfill the word of God what the prophets had said see he came to fulfill the prophecy of the Old Testament Jesus came to fulfill it that's why he was on Earth to fulfill everything that was written of him ain't ain't that right see so therefore he was the word made flesh he was the word made flesh notice Jesus did not spend his life presuming presuming about things well I just presume I am the Messiah I presume that that I am I'm to do this and I am to do that no no no uh uh uh uh see presuming means to Adventure without Authority amen but Jesus had authority to do what he did he didn't pursue he wasn't just adventuring out and not knowing uh uh see and and so there were men who came on the scene uh before Christ came claiming to be Messiah and uh but but they didn't have that authority to be Messiah see they they were just presuming to be Messiah but there was no scriptures written of them uh to be the Messiah there was only one Messiah that the scriptures pertained to and and that Messiah had the authority to fulfill the scriptures amen but these men that claim to be that adventured without Authority just presuming their Ministry their influence came to not and they perish see and and and you remember a a Pharisee by the name of G and uh he reminded the Jews that had determined to kill Peter and and the other disciples or Apostles and they had determined to kill them and and and so G stopped him and said hold it hold it you know uh uh and uh in acts acts 5:35 he says unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men for before these days uh rose up theodus uh boasting to be himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who was slain and all as many obeyed him were scattered and brought to not see this man claimed to be something and yet it was brought T not cuz he had no Authority in it see to do what he did after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxon and Drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed now I say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it'll come to not ain't that right but if it be of God he says then you cannot overthrow it l happily you be found even to fight against God ain't that right so he knew that these these Apostles had the authority uh to do what they were doing they they they weren't just like these other men and if they are like these other men then they're going to come to not because they have no Authority behind this amen and and it's just the same way David keshes and the and the Jim Jones and and and well you just got them all all kinds all over the place see people presuming to be but they they come to not ain't that right but but see Jesus had the authority to fulfill uh uh the word of God to do what he did to be what he was and it wasn't government Authority it wasn't denominational Authority uh that he had it was scriptural Authority amen scriptural Authority It Was Written of him ain't that right and so that the the the Gentiles and Centurion he recognized the authority that Jesus had but also the Jews recognized this Authority that he had Matthew uh 21:23 it tells us that the chief priest and the Elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what Authority does uh uh thou these things and who gave thee this Authority so he he was he was doing this and they recognized that there was an authority behind his actions there was an authority amen behind his words and his life amen see they prided themselves in having Authority they boasted in their Authority amen but they didn't have this kind of authority their Authority that was exercised over men and and and and and status and they they had a status and they had all of these things I'm better than you and I'm this and so they were above the people that was their Authority but Jesus had a different Authority he he could be with the common people he could speak their language and and and he could uh uh uh uh um uh you know he he could be with those uh the Sinners and and these things and and uh uh eat with him and where whereas the scribes and Pharisees they could not do that you know they were above all that see but Jesus he could do this and and live so simple and so humble but there was an authority behind his life he wasn't seeking gain he wasn't seeking position he had an authority above all men amen see so so uh uh uh their Authority uh uh they might have had that Authority but yet they couldn't do the things that he did amen mark 1:22 and it says they were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one that had Authority and not as the scribes see amen see yet uh teaching amen taught them but as one that had Authority see and not only did he teach as one having Authority but he also had authority over demonic spirits amen Mark 1:27 they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him ain't that right so where did this Authority come from well it come from God for he was God made flesh God that that spirit being that that Eternal being had come down in time in a body of Flesh amen and the Bible says the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in him ain't that right amen see and so so the the men that that came before him and came after him and claiming to be Messiah and trying to do what he did and and all of these things see they failed because they were not predestinated to it ain't that right their Ministries crumbled because they were not predestinated to be exactly to be what he was amen you know when you look at nature amen you you can tell amen that God gives us a a uh contrast he gives us a a witness of these things uh take take the Buzzard for example versus an eagle amen and and uh uh the Buzzard you know it cannot do what an eagle does it it cannot be what an eagle is it it it just ain't it can't because it's not made to be that way it's it's not predestinated it don't have the authority to be an eagle you understand what I'm saying amen just like a peacock it it ain't got the Authority or uh uh you know or to or a buzzard I think brother brandham called it a crow amen um uh you know trying to be the uh uh the the peacock he says you can't do it you know you you can put you can put peacock feathers all in and but but it's still not it it's still not a peacock you understand what I'm saying see so this Buzzard it it's not built to go where the eagle goes it's not it's not built to see what an eagle sees it it it has a different appetite it his eyesight is different and if you'll notice he's limited by Nature not by circumstance can you say amen amen a buzzard is limited amen by nature and not by circumstance but you know if an eagle cannot soar in the in in the heavenlies it's because he has become a slave to something you can't blame it on his nature you can't say well you know he wasn't made to be that way well we all know he was made to be that way because there's been Eagles like him that are soar into the heavenlies and and so if an eagle if you see an eagle that is not up there in the heavenlies and can't fly then you know there's something wrong there's a circumstance there that is holding him but it ain't his nature that's binding him ain't that right amen a prophet the prophet talked about being at a zoo and seeing an eagle in the cage and and and and he had once soared in the heavenlies but somehow he had been enslaved he had been captured and thrown into this cage and brother BR says I watched him he'd be sitting there looking looking in the in the heavenlies and and and looking up there and then he' take off aen trying to fly because it was his nature to fly it was his nature to live up there amen but the uh uh he had hit that them bars and just fall back he said he was a bloody and and bruised and all that see it wasn't his nature that was holding him back it was that he had been captured and thrown into a cave amen uh by by his captors Amen brother BR said see the poor fell was so out of place amen that he would jump with all that was within him against the big bars flopping his wings only to find himself to fall on his back and that poor Eagle had beat himself against those bars until all the feathers was beat from his wings his head and his face was bruised he says and I watched him you know as I watched him again proudly walked back and with all that he had he poured himself against the bars to only find himself knocked backwards again amen and as he laay there on that floor and his weary eyes soared the skies amen see amen and and see he was not made to be in a cage he was not made to be in an Earthbound uh uh Rim he was made a Heavenly bird to soar in the heavens he was designed to take it he was designed Amen to go against the winds and and use the adversity of winds to take him up high amen he was that way amen and I thought of so many times sons of God are living just like that amen living in bars they want to be free they say I'll get closer amen and when they get closer or when they try when they jump when they fly amen they're only knocked back down by circumstances and things like that it's not that you're not made to fly it's not M that you're not made to be these things God Made You Amen to soar into the heavenlies God Made You to soar in the Revelation and in the power of His might of this day amen see brother Brown says about that eagle his whole makeup was to live in the blue way above the haunts and cares of this world Amen see if you if if you ever study an eagle amen see uh he holds a law within him amen and and and and he's designed see amen then and and if you know that if you know the kind of law that he has and and what he's designed for then then you know amen that living in a cage is not what God intended for him to be amen that's why God would send a message to let you know what you're designed to do what you're made to do and and to let you know that if you're not there you're in a cage this Eagle swar until he become enslaved ain't that right and so yet even though as he sat in the cage and though he was he was he was enslaved yet they couldn't take what God made him to be they couldn't take that away from him they couldn't change his design amen of what God designed him to be even though he was in that cage he was still what he was because he was predestinated to be that can you say man if only that little that eagle could have been set free amen see but if you look at that if you look at the crow it's not that he's enslaved in that way a lot of times it's just his nature his nature keeps him from flying as high as the eal he has no desire to go there he doesn't have the ability to go up there see so so it's not by by circumstance that keeps him it's by his nature can you say amen amen oh yeah he may talk about privileges you know uh he may talk about privileges that he has but he don't have the Privileges that an eagle has amen yeah he can gloat about his privileges like a lot of folks today they brag about their American Rights and they brag about their gay rights and they brag about this and they brag about that and all the rights that they have and you just have to laugh at it you know because that's all they brag about but here we are we've got a a greater privilege and that is to be soned and Daughters of God to soar above the heavenlies amen amen it's greater than American Privileges and American rights they it's greater than even denominational rights and privileges and and all of these things those privileges don't compare to the Privileges that the sons and daughters have of this age it's a privilege to know that I'm going in a Rapture it's a privilege to know that I'm headed for a body change it's a privilege to know that I have an authority I have an authority over every devil of hell that's a privilege it's a privilege yes sir and if you notice not only did Jesus have authority over unclean spirits that denom that dominated other people but he had the authority over every spirit that tried to dominate him as well when he is tempted of the devil he had he had an authority over that Spirit of unbelief amen that tried that tried to qu make him question as to who he was and tried to get him to prove amen that he was what he said he was if thou be the Son of God if thou be isn't that something that old unbelieving spirit always throws the questions out if you are forgiven if you are this if you are saved if you really are amen a child of God then then do this and do that and do this see it's a spirit of unbelief that tries to take over but see he had an authority over that he had authority over that evil spirit that tried to get him to do something outside of what was written of him to do yes sir he had the authority Amen to place the scriptures exactly in line oh yeah Satan was PL quoting the scriptures but he was misplacing them scriptures ain't that right now if you think of it many people have an authority they're able to to cast out Devils to heal the sick and we can see J Judas had the same thing casting Devils out Healing The Sick and and all of these things but they don't have the authority over the devil in their own life to where they can do the will of the father now notice that's the key now is to do the will of the father amen Matthew 7:21 not everyone that sayth unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will everybody say say doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven see many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not profesi in thy name in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity amen now Jesus shows us that that in in on later on down he shows us that it's not the man that builds the house that counts go ahead ain't that right it's not the one that labors for the Lord that counts you can do God a service without it being his will that's ain't that right see but it's the man whose house is still standing after the test comes test is going to come your way you'll never beg your way out of it you'll never cry your way out of it you'll never be so sport in life to where he doesn't come your way trials are going to come your way disappointments are going to come your way things are going to hell is going to break loose upon your life it's going to come can you say Amen now so notice Jesus talks about the two men that built their house right now the real difference between the two is one heard the word and didn't do it and his house fell the other one built his house he heard the word received a revelation of it and he did it he was able to not just hear it but do it can you say Amen therefore his house stood so it's not it's not the Min it's not the man who builds his ministry that count it's not the man who has great influence in the community that counts it's it's not he that says well God s a prophet in this age that counts it's not even he that that says Amen to the prophet that counts amen you go listen to the Token in Jeffersonville brother Braham says you know you can say well I just believe every word brother Bram he said if you believe it you'll follow the message you it's it's not just believing it's not just saying I believe it there's got to be a token inside a life that is on display now so so here brother brandham or or Jesus said Matthew 7:24 whosoever heareth these things of mine and doeth him I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock the rains descended the floods came notice the same rains that fell upon the uh uh that that came upon the man the the foolish man is the same that that fell upon the one that that the wise man the rains descended the floods came the winds blew and beat up on that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock can you say man that is the man that only hear the word but he done the word he was a doer of the word ain't that right so Jesus had an authority over his own life to do the will of the father I think that's important now Amen to do the will of the Father John 4:34 my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work that's what Jesus said another place he said John 5:30 I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which hath sent me John 6:38 he says I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me ain't that right Philippians 2 and8 being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross amen see John 10:17 therefore Jesus said do my father love me because I laid down my life and that I might take it again no man taketh it from me oh you say well they they crucified him but he gave his life to them he gave himself to them can you say amen amen see no man taketh from me but I lay it down of myself I have power I have that authority to lay it down and I have power to take it again can you say Amen because this commandment have I received of my father It Was Written of him not only to cast out devils and not only to heal the Blind and and and cause the lame to walk it was written of him that he would go to Calvary It Was Written of him that he would be buried amen and he would raise again but notice as much as he had the authority to open blind eyes and and caus the dead to raise he had the authority to go into the Garden of Gethsemane he had the authority Amen to carry that cross and walk up Calvary and lay his life down in the Garden of Gethsemane he said father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done you see one might think that Jesus didn't have much opposition and that he just lived a Carefree life and his life was just a cakewalk but I beg to differ with you amen Satan was hounding him all the time Satan was you're hounded just you're hounded you're fought well can imagine he was fought because if he truly was the Messiah Satan knew if he truly was that Messiah amen you know I got to get rid of him am ain't that right amen because I he's he's he's doing damage to my kingdom but he he didn't realize amen that putting him to death done the greatest damage ever it it actually broke his power can you say Amen but Jesus had to do this see amen but now notice in John 16:33 Jesus said these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation so so so don't don't think this is going to be easy for you to be a Christian oh no no no you're not on a picnic amen just kind of like Paul God just broke Paul in he didn't tell him well Paul now now you're just a new Christian so I'm just going to baby you for a little bit and let you grow up no he just told him like it was you're going to suffer for me you're going to be persecuted for me you're going to you're going to go through many things Paul amen but I'll be with you ain't that right and I just tell you Church you're going to go through a lot of disappointments it it may come from family it may come from Friends it may come from the world it may come from the church it may come from from from uh uh work it may come it doesn't matter where it's going to come but you're just going to go through these things you're going to go through disappointment you're going to shed your tears you're going to be heartbroken amen you're going to fight bitterness you're going to fight hate you're going to fight divisiveness you're going to fight amen a uh loneliness you're going to fight a uh uh fight the the the the the uh Satan trying to call you and and get you away from the church and get you away from things and you know you're just going to fight that's that's just the way it is that's what Jesus did he fought he went through things and he says in the world you shall have tribulation but everybody say but be of good cheer I have overcome the world I have overcome the world now you all know the if you if you listen to the message brother Bram says if God takes things from you you know people say well if if God would just take this from me Lord if you just take this habit and You' take this he says well you know if God done all that you'd have nothing to overcome he just took it away from you God ain't going to push you through the pipe you don't push you amen and then you get on the other side and he say blessed is he that overcome he said you had nothing to overcome so if Jesus said I have overcome the world then you know good and well he was tempted he was tried every devil of hell was after him but he says be of good cheer I have overcome the world and if I have overcome the world you shall overcome the world you may have to shed your tears that's fine but get get up people get mad at God for so much I'd say the reason why they get mad at God is because they they don't even serve God like they should they want to go live a selfish life indulge in everything that they want to and then when something bad comes then they want to blame God for it listen he had opposition he had disappointments he had loneliness he he fought things but he had that authority to overcome them praise the Lord can you say Amen you may see a Believer going down not going down but going through the fire you may see that believer shedding tears you may see that believer perplexed you may see that believer sometime not knowing what to do but don't you hold that keep that believer out don't you count him out yet cuz he's got an authority hlu now what did Jesus fulfill that which was written of him in the scriptures Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God he lived by that word the word of God so mattered to him Amen brother Bram said said he lived by the word of the father he live he so lived by the word till he became the word so he wasn't a loose cannon his ministry wasn't a loose cannon his life wasn't a loose cannon his testimony wasn't a loose cannon hello and no other Son of God is either brother Bram said God in ended for man to express his words God intended for us to express his words by our life and he says a life lived by the word would be the word expressed amen you may have ideas about things you may have opinions and all of these things but that isn't the way we live we live by this word that's right and a life lived by the word is the word expressed now Adam was given the word to live by Brother Bram said he was he was to live by every word and he failed to take keed to every word Moses failed to live by every word he failed in his anger David failed to live by every word he failed by adultery Abraham failed to live by every word Joseph failed to live by every word amen then he says but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even Jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God then was Satan f for here was one who lived by it is written it is written it is written can you say Amen every time that Satan would come at him it was written it is written Satan couldn't enti him Satan couldn't deceive him Satan couldn't trap him he was so with the word that the word became preeminent in his life see he lived he says see here was one that lived by it is written and that Masterpiece of God overcame by reflecting God's word then was this manifested perfect one given to the Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God so you see how he overcome you see how he expressed the word of God he so lived by the word till he became the word amen every time Satan would come at him it is written Satan it is written Satan it is written Satan now you know how you're going to over come it is written it is written it is written that's right now watch Hebrews 2 and9 we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons on to Glory other words the prophet said to bring in many sons that's predestinated to eternal life to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings for both he that sanctifieth and they that are Sanctified are of all one are all of one ain't that right see so God gave His only begotten son born of a woman but not by sex by a spoken word god God created that blood cell in the womb of Mary can you say amen and in in in Revelations 3:14 he is revealed as the beginning of the creation of God can you say that with me the beginning of the creation of God Jesus Christ was ain't that right he was Jehovah made manifest now notice the prophet said God in creation god with the Liv little part of the creation that God was living in himself he was the beginning of that creation of God and from him begat many sons ain't that right see he he he had the ability to multiply the fish and the loaves but that that Authority just didn't stop there he had the power to multiply himself praise the lord we sure he did God look he said he used the flesh that created himself in order to create through him and to bring many bring through him many sons into the world that he might show himself alive today God ain't showing himself alive through government politicians denominations just religion he's showing himself alive in the sons that he has brought forth that's right that's right see another place this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed with this same logos you're Anointed with that same logos not the different Spirit not some other Spirit on the day of Pentecost in another place he says it come down that Pillar of Fire and broke apart like that and tongues of fire licks of fire set upon each of them see not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon each of them a elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire showing that God had separated himself in the man do you get it God the lust separating himself in two men God not in one person now he's in his church Universal same God in many members many sons ain't that right God came in one son died on the cross and through him he produced many sons you are a multiplication of him amen hallu glory amen you're part of that new creation that's right God didn't start the creation with you he started the creation with him he's the beginning of the creation of God so Jesus died the prophet said the only begotten Son of God that he might make us adopted children that he might work his will through us right how shameful we should be of claiming to be children of God and letting the devil push us around like he does we've got the rights how many believes that church you've got the rights you're the one with the rights as many as received him to them gave he the power to be sons of God you've got a legal right to be a Son of God yes sir it's a shame that we would let Satan beat knock us around push us around it's a shame that we had accept what the devil gives us as though it belongs to us you don't have to accept nothing of the devil amen live by the word amen problem said we got the rights we're already risen with him can you say amen I hope this all right this morning Lord I tell you what now we all know we all know that we're living in the most evil age ever you've heard it now you experiencing it it's the most evil age ever it's the darkest age it's the most chaotic age it's a it's an age of Le oysa it's Le oysan age which is a lukewarm age lukewarm remember God speaks to this age Revelations 3:15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot now notice what he's saying here this is and and you know good and well this is where we're at I wish you just a outrank sinner just if you're going to be it just be it or just be a solid Christian on fire for God but he looks at the age that we're in and he says but you're lukewarm you got one foot out in the world and one foot in the church on this hand you're looking at the world and you're you're being enticed and you're indulging in the worldly things and on this side you you're you're claiming to be a Christian you're claiming to be message you're claiming to be whatever hello now you know good and well people you work with most of them claim to be Christians in some form or another that's true you can't tell them that they need God they got him you can't tell them anything that's right you try it then they want to know what you believe and then you tell oh you're a cult never mind the fact that they're living a double life smoking drinking and it's a perfect example today uh there's gentleman the other day I got in my room and he you know he claiming to be in the message you know for years and uh but I got him a room and she told me she says now we don't have smoking we just got nonsmoking I said oh that's just fine so so I said yeah just just non-smoking so I go out and I told him I said now listen I got you a non-smoking room but that should be fine because you're in the message and I know good and well you don't smoke oh now I just can't lie preacher you know I I know I am in the message but the Lord told me cuz I've gone through so much that I just need to relax and I need to do my body good I said well tonight you don't smoke do you but see it's just so common because people are indulging in the world and they yet they're claiming to be something you understand what I'm saying and this is the hardest age ever that's right and these are the type of spirits that we're facing Satan trying to rock us to sleep Satan trying to get us so involved in in the things of the world and yet make us feel like we're okay because cuz we believe in a message we believe that we're going to heaven all of these things and yet the world's hanging on it's true people can't get rid of their pornographies they can't get rid of their TV oh I know I know we got rid of the TVs but what do you do on the other am watching all that secular junk you understand what I'm saying you got you got preachers that that smoking pulpits and and that's that's just everywhere that's in about every not maybe not in every denomination but close to it everybody just so wrapped up in the world I guarantee you you know and I'm not trying to bring condemnation but how many times do we pray how many times do we read how many times do we just sit with our families and listen to a message that's right you understand what I'm saying it's the worst age ever amen brother Bram said this this last generation that will be on the earth is sinful adulterous and full of putrid putrified sores everything that has been decent has become indecent that's right it's in our churches it's in our po politics it's in our schools it's at our homes everything is immoral everything is indecent everything is ungodly it is totally anti- word and brother Bram said this leot toy and age goes into chaos he talks about he says way back in the jungles of Africa on Safari Hunters he said they had to take high-powered radios to hear elus Presley Pat Boon and and and them guys with that rock and roll that in twist and the natives trying to see them act along jerking their heads and act like that the natives stood and looked at them see but you see they're not Americans like Pat Boon and Elvis Presley and Ricky Nelson and them guys are they're not judases of that type see it's a spirit and we can even go into our Modern Age you know and I've talked about it to Randy Travis to The Isaacs to Bill Gaither and all them guy singing they'll sing Christian and then they'll go around uh uh uh singing country and promoting country and and and and all these things it it they're just a modern Elvis you know you know it's the truth if you believe the message you believe that see he says and and they're they're not judases of that type see it's a spirit and the spirit is not only in America it has spread itself out over the world to bring them to the Battle of armagedon they act like that whether they he said whatever Nation they come from Africa India uh wherever it is that vulgar and stuff has spread all over the Earth by just one man starting it but notice what he says so has the gospel and the power of almighty God has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place when God is calling a bride and the devil is calling a church let me be part of that bride how many wants to be part of that bride I don't want to be part of that church I want to be part of a bride the devil's calling his and God is calling his can you say Amen see we receive Paul would tell us we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken you know what is it if we have a kingdom then there's a king Christ is our King the Bible calls him king of saints brother brah said our kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world system see even as we are not of this world do you believe that we are not of this world they may legalize things but that does not mean it's right your life should be judged by this word and not by what they allow can you say Amen it's true that's right you say well so and so does it and this one does it and this one does it and they go to church they go to messes church that don't mean nothing that don't mean nothing just because they're doing it don't mean it's right word see it's not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world we act different from the world do you believe that we act different we treat our husbands we treat our wives like Queens we don't treat them like the world does hello amen wives you treat your your men as Lords of your home head of your home you don't treat them like the world does theirs amen well if you're message Believers you can say Amen to them things okay well it said anyways see our citizenship is in heaven how many believes that you're not just an American you're a citizen from heaven we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king that is why our women does not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things like the World likes so much that is why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin amen can you say Amen notice what brother BM says our Dominion everybody say our Dominion our Dominion I know everybody's getting into politics trying to make the world greater amen don't you get it that's not your Dominion that is not your domain our Dominion is the dominion over sin amen politics ain't going to fix your sins that's where the Dominion is that's where your Dominion is oh things will get better you know what they want it better for so they can live Easier no trouble no heartaches God forbid that we go through things God forbid that we go through things that makes us pray makes us trust God and no one's worried about the sin no one's worried about the sin that Creeps in the church Creeps in their home no one's worried about the sin that's no one's identifying it get better politicians right we'll fix that abortion no you won't get better politicians and you will fix America no you won't that's not your domain our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us and every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain that's the truth you love him you may not like it but it's just the truth anyhow you may say well that's my American privilege you go right on with that American privilege but I've got a privilege as a Son of God I'd rather exercise my privilege as a Son of God and tell the devil where to go and that's under my feet can you say Amen I'd rather tell that sin amen you have no rights over me anymore that's my Dominion am you see we've got a dominion over sin but that does not mean that you ain't going to have to fight that doesn't mean that you're not going to have to overcome amen sin can you say Amen doesn't mean that you're not going to have to overcome those lusts amen and it ain't just lust for women it's it it it could be lust for money it could be lust for materialistic things it could be lust lust lust lust lust of the world the pride of life can you say am man it could be lust for anything lust means desire craving and you've got to overcome them things Satan trying to entice you brother B called it enticing Spirits these Devils ain't just got little horns on their heads and all that like the world they are enticing Spirits that's right and you're going to have to overcome I hope is all right God gave Israel her land do you believe that how many believes God gave Israel her land you believe that that land belongs to her do you believe that they're right where God gave them they ain't in no other land if they were in America trying to be Israel in America that'd be different or if they were in Africa but they were in a land that God gave them way back amen absolutely but have you noticed they're fighting for their life that's right they're fighting for their existence right God didn't make it easy for them they're fighting on fronts I mean four four battles at one time the Bible says the world will turn against them in one point it will but they'll never be able to destroy her but she's got to fight for it she's had to fight for that land do you believe that well I'm going to tell you this this bride is in a fight for her life you're in a fight brother fight with everything you've got you can't just lay down and say well it was predestinated for me so it'll just happen no it won't you fight it amen you've got an assurance that if Israel is going to keep her land you're going to keep your promises God will fight you with you God will fight for you but youve got to fight yourself how do I fight but it is written it is written abstaining from the things of the world abstaining from these things quit floating your mind with the trash and garbage God help us all that's right you understand don't you amen that's right we become so in tune with the things of the world to when the word of God has come it just it just don't have an effect like it should and what happens is the world is coming in and the fire is dying out that's right it dies out Church you understand what I'm saying but this is the time to Fight for Your Existence is a son and you've got the authority Israel's got the authority trust me God's behind her that's right absolutely sons of God are fighting for their life you love the Lord the Lord if you allow me just a few more minutes if you remember John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have eternal life and you know what the prophet said the world that world that he died for was his offspring his children can you say amen he died for you to secure you see what is a son of God sons of God is a Heavenly being see we always were Sons and Daughters of God you believe that you believe that we were soaring into the heavenlies way before we become Earthbound well we were we were free before we ever become captive by the devil see in God's mind we were above the Earthbound things of this world in God's mind we were saved we were free we were Eagles we were Sons and Daughters of God living our potential bless his name we existed in God's mind the Bible says we did Ephesians 1:4 according as he ha chosen us not just some people not another race not another people not another us according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love God ordained it God Ed it that's it that's your Authority amen yes sir Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he called and whom he called he justified and them he justified he or so glorified then that means we were not Sinners back then we were not Vagabond Beggars and unfit people back then amen we were sons of God you know according to Job 38 we sang together and shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world Amen trying to tell you where your Authority is coming from who you are amen job 38:4 where was thou when I laid the foundations of the Earth the seventh verse when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy amen you know what brother Bram said shouting religion existed millions of years before the world began and they did shout just to shout like a lot of folks do today brother Bram said they shouted for Joy when they seen that someday they would Tabernacle here on Earth and King MDC would come in the righteousness of God and give his life to redeem us to God back again and outshine the Stars forever and ever we were shouting he says at the same time the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world the morning Stars sand together in the sons of God shattered for Joy when they seen the Plan of Salvation God putting your name on The Book of Life before the foundation of the world we are not creatures of time we are creatures of Eternity amen we were there in the mind of God can you say Amen think of it we were shouting that's right praising worshiping not a sin sons of God he never called us sinners he said they were sons of God we were there bless his name and we're not preaching the pre-existence of souls but notice brother Brown said God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing and then that old formal devil tell us we can't do that stuff no more hogwash I'm a Son of God God already saw me I got an authority to do it God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus Christ he's seen it through Adam we were born Sinners condemned were captive and come into the world manifesting what we were in the mind of God we weren't rejoicing over the work of redemption we weren't excited about the things of God we weren't exercising our rights as sons of God we weren't worshiping him in spirit and Truth as sons of God as what he saw us we were in a cage we we were Sinners vagabonds hopeless wretched we were living under our privileges as [Music] Sons slaves to the devil and you know what you might look at the people out here laughing and celebrating and enjoying life Satan a while back he would he would really get me to look at that I'd see them drinking their little deals and they're just laughing I thought but they're having joy and he' get me to look at that see they got joy you're going through your trib they got joy and he'd get me to look at at at these other little things or parties or or or people that living so ungodly in their Lifestyles and all that but they were laughing and just really and he say see they got joy look at you you're suffering you're going through your trials you know and I think it was the prophet I'd heard when somewhere where he said see they they they have that because this is what they are they're content this is where this is the world is of they're of the world but he said the world is not your home amen you're just passing through and you're pressing to another kingdom you're pressing to another place you're pressing can you sayen church I want to say you're pressing you may be going through your trials today but you're pressing keep pressing you've got an authority to press and to overcome as he overcome so shall you overcome amen can you say amen that's good you know brother brandham didn't have the authority he said if I had the authority to set that ego free I would have but he didn't but Jesus Christ come to set us free Amen brother Braham said Jesus Christ shed his blood to make every word of God a reality to every person that would believe John 8:36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed do you believe that amen you love the Lord amen hallelujah I don't even know what time it is but if the musicians will come Hallelujah I want to say to you today don't focus on your American rights focus on your Redemptive rights America has no future this world has no future politics has no future amen the governments of the world has no future the stock market has no future democracy has no future this layot of c and age has no future we have come to what the Bible called the ends of the Earth it's over the world is truly falling apart that's right now you're blessed to hear a prophet preach that sermon and tell us them things amen why so that you wouldn't get wrapped up in the world and wrapped up on all these things you know what brother brah said he said this message is the sign that the world is finished it's a sign to us to get in to make sure you have that token in your hand because we're leaving this [Music] place so whatever privileges you have as an American as a human being they're fighting for human rights and yes you might have a lot of Human Rights don't dwell on that dwell upon your Redemptive rights because you them Redemptive right you're going to receive a body change you're going to receive something that's going to Quicken this old body you love him brother Brian said we are now at the end of the history of the world there will be no use of writing it because there won't be anybody to read it it's at the end of time and the whole world has succumbed to the demonic spirits that have poured in into this age and they're dominating this age but the sons of God have the authority over every foul Spirit do you believe that you have the authority of God over every foul spirit every unclean spirit amen is true brother brah said the holy spirit is here to fulfill the prophecy of the New Testament he fulfilled the prophecy of the Old Testament now he's here to fulfill it in you the prophecy of the New Testament and any disciple of Christ who has come in contact with him in Redemption and salvation has come into his heart he is a possessor of God and what kind of life should we we live how should we walk and how should we talk if God is representing himself through our own mortal bodies can you say Amen do you love him you know it looked like it looked like that the Holy Spirit would have no future in the church it looked like it just had no future if you go look at the Feast of the trumpets brother brandham said for nearly 2,000 years the the Holy Spirit has been bound under modum martyrdom back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the r river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems see it so so it just looked hopeless it looked like it would be forever bound it looked like it would be forever imprisoned by the Creeds and dogmas but then he would tell us but it is to be loosed and I say to you it has been loosed in this evening time by this evening time message brother Brandon may have not been had that authority to loose that eagle but he had the authority to loose that the holy spirit in this age by bringing back the word of God to us to where the Holy Spirit brother Braham said is back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time aren't you glad for that he said and the badge of authority is not a name of a den denomination but it's the power of the resurrection of Christ in each individual the life that's within us is not only a creative life but it's part of his own life and that's the reason we have the authority to speak to a devil because it's God's Own creative life if you're anointed see it's not you that speaketh but the father that dwelleth in you oh itn't be wonderful can you lift your hands unto the Lord and aren't you glad to be sons of God Daughters of God with the authority you don't have to knut down to the devil you don't have to give in to that Old Slew Foot hallelujah we're sons of God with the authority in this age he's identified us as Sons by pouring his Spirit upon us and giving us the authority how we're so thankful father father for it we love you we glorify you what I'm going to keep pressing on going to

you in things that sucks you into to to vanity or to to to sin and and to where it becomes sin lay it aside those things are so appealing so many so many men have fallen over the [Music] website CU there's so many things used to you could it was just always in a store you'd have to turn into the parking lot walk into the store and get in these things but now it's just right at the fingertips right on the internet and so many men have been enticed sad to say women too been have been enticed by the filth upon of them things church it's time to lay aside those things if if you're you're

it oh yeah you can go through the forms of it you can go through the form of preaching you can go through the form of playing music you can go through the form of saying amen you can go through the form of singing a special or whatever but that's not the point the point is you want to be anointed in it you you want God to be pleased with your life you want God to back your life up and if there's sins if there sins there don't don't make them excuses don't don't just live in it and and make that your Norm look at it and say I'm a Son of God with the authority over this I I'm I'm not going to
