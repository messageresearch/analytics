[42:21] heads and and talk to the Lord father
[42:27] we're thankful Lord that you have
[42:29] redeemed us Lord and brought us together
[42:32] in this age
[42:35] by a supernatural message
[42:40] father no man could have done it Lord it
[42:44] it took you to to do it father and
[42:47] it was something that you had put within
[42:50] our hearts before the foundation of the
[42:53] world and
[42:55] and you would use the message to call us
[42:58] out Lord from all kinds of
[43:02] Dark Places
[43:04] that we could come together not just in
[43:07] a building but our hearts be United and
[43:09] knitted together
[43:11] Lord and we serving one Lord
[43:15] having one hope one faith
[43:18] one expectation
[43:21] and Lord it's it's all of our desire
[43:24] Lord and anticipation is just to see you
[43:28] face to face
[43:30] that Lord until that time I pray that
[43:34] you would just come in your special way
[43:36] here
[43:38] father and just move across the building
[43:41] and just speak to every heart
[43:44] Lord were your children and we need you
[43:49] and I pray Lord if there's anything that
[43:51] would hinder us this morning
[43:54] I pray Lord that you would just take
[43:57] every spirit that ain't like you out of
[44:00] our lives or out of this building
[44:03] father and may Faith come alive this
[44:05] morning is our prayer
[44:07] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[44:11] amen praise the Lord and the book of
[44:15] Ephesians
[44:17] um
[44:18] the first chapter 15th verse
[44:22] wherefore
[44:24] I also after I heard of your faith in
[44:27] the Lord Jesus and love unto all the
[44:30] saints cease not to give thanks for you
[44:33] making mention of you in my prayers
[44:37] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[44:39] the father of Glory
[44:41] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[44:44] and Revelation and the knowledge of him
[44:47] in the eyes of your understanding been
[44:50] enlightened that you may know what is
[44:53] the hope of his calling and what the
[44:55] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[44:57] in the Saints
[45:00] praise the Lord you can have your seats
[45:05] that I also want to look here in the
[45:08] 22nd verse and says and hath put all
[45:11] things under his feet
[45:14] and gave him Christ to be the head over
[45:18] all things to the church which is his
[45:21] body
[45:22] the fullness of him
[45:24] that filleth all in all
[45:28] I'm going to again speak on the
[45:30] supernatural he said it'll be my title
[45:33] and I hope trust that this series
[45:37] has been of some help to you sometimes
[45:43] I find it really difficult to express
[45:47] what is on my heart
[45:50] and
[45:52] so my prayer is is that the Lord would
[45:55] just be merciful and and reveal it to us
[45:58] even in a greater way show it to us and
[46:03] um but I do believe that we're
[46:06] were part of something
[46:09] that is far greater than ourselves
[46:13] or that is far greater than anything in
[46:17] this natural world
[46:20] and and and I pray that God will really
[46:25] show us that more than just
[46:27] uh by learning it or intellectually but
[46:31] but really become a revelation in our
[46:34] heart
[46:35] but we are we are part of God we we are
[46:40] part of God
[46:42] and God is Supernatural
[46:46] and where God is the supernatural always
[46:51] takes place for that's what the prophet
[46:53] said
[46:54] and
[46:56] the supernatural has nothing to do with
[47:00] the the efforts of man
[47:03] it it goes beyond the intelligence of
[47:06] man it goes beyond science it goes
[47:09] beyond politics or
[47:11] education or civilization or whatever it
[47:16] is superior to anything that man can
[47:20] come up with
[47:23] and
[47:24] we could take like creation
[47:28] creation is a supernatural happening
[47:33] you'd be surprised that man doesn't look
[47:36] at it that way it's kind of a humorous
[47:40] little uh thing I'm just you know I was
[47:44] reading you know that some scientists
[47:46] approached God
[47:48] and they told themselves you know God we
[47:50] don't need you anymore this is uh we've
[47:53] we've discovered that we're equal with
[47:56] you now and so
[47:58] God says oh yeah how how was that you
[48:01] know and so they say well we we've now
[48:04] been able to to form a body uh of man uh
[48:11] you know out of Out of the Dust just
[48:13] like you did so we don't need you and so
[48:17] God said well yeah well we'll go ahead
[48:18] and prove it so they take you know they
[48:21] they took a handful of dust and God says
[48:23] oh no no no no no no don't you do that
[48:25] says you got to go get your own dust you
[48:29] know
[48:29] and so man you know they
[48:35] they can only take what is created
[48:39] and do whatever they want to do and and
[48:42] man gets lifted up in that and he thinks
[48:44] we've really accomplished something
[48:47] and yet they they forget that it was
[48:52] what created it
[48:54] whatever they take to to to use to make
[48:59] rubber or to to make the car to make the
[49:02] house or to whatever how did that get
[49:05] here of course you know they'll explain
[49:07] it you know and say it was Evolution and
[49:09] da da da but you know uh they're just
[49:12] out of their heads and but we we we look
[49:17] and and this is this is where we we are
[49:20] coming to a man has arrived in his
[49:25] thinking and and it's getting more
[49:27] prominent and I know that there have
[49:30] always been nuts out there that you know
[49:34] they're atheists but I there's a certain
[49:37] man that's going around giving lectures
[49:41] in the United States and probably the
[49:45] world and I heard him say the other day
[49:48] and things that he's saying is very
[49:50] sobering
[49:51] to to think of the achievements that man
[49:54] has come up with in science
[49:57] but he says we are now seriously in the
[50:01] business of acquiring the traditional
[50:05] Divine abilities and qualities he's
[50:09] talking of man
[50:10] and he's actually in a church
[50:13] and and the church is full and and he
[50:16] says now you take this church he said
[50:19] for years and years and years
[50:22] the church has has described of God and
[50:27] and has told of all the Divine qualities
[50:29] of God and it's been it's been preached
[50:32] about talked about he says but now we
[50:36] are seriously uh in the business of
[50:39] acquiring the traditional Divine
[50:42] abilities
[50:43] and qualities now this man is supported
[50:46] by Barack Obama uh uh Bill Gates Mark
[50:51] Zuckerberg and many other wealthy men
[50:54] and and so you you see where they're
[50:57] trying to push uh uh in science and
[51:01] education and all these things
[51:03] but he said he said the goal that
[51:06] science has is to find the key
[51:09] the secret to happiness and to basically
[51:13] upgrade the human into gods
[51:16] God men
[51:19] now he's trying this there this is what
[51:21] they're pushing for the agenda through
[51:23] science
[51:25] and and now I I I'm not going into
[51:28] everything he said but it's it's really
[51:32] incredible where they're headed
[51:34] uh but he says I I don't mean it as kind
[51:39] of a literally metaphor
[51:41] I mean it in the literal sense
[51:45] he goes to say that men for thousands of
[51:48] years have subscribed particular
[51:50] abilities and qualities to God
[51:54] then he says we are now seriously
[51:57] in the business of acquiring these
[52:01] traditional Divine abilities and
[52:02] qualities to ourselves whether it's
[52:05] trying to overcome death and gain
[52:07] immortality or whether it's the ability
[52:10] to create and design life
[52:14] so they know there's something out there
[52:17] and they know that man was created for
[52:21] something
[52:23] and yet
[52:25] and and notice the direction that
[52:28] they're headed and that is to make man
[52:30] into gods
[52:34] and now of course you know he goes on to
[52:37] talk about his he'll be the those that
[52:39] are computers in the computer age and
[52:42] how that they're tracking everything
[52:45] about you your feet they know your
[52:47] desire they know your your wants they
[52:50] they know uh by by what you look at what
[52:53] you shop for or what you this they know
[52:55] all about you
[52:57] and he says and now we're getting into
[53:00] the brain
[53:01] to where we control
[53:04] we can control everything about them and
[53:07] we become gods
[53:09] so there's be a there their purpose is
[53:12] that some will rise to godship and
[53:15] others will be their little pawns
[53:17] minions
[53:19] but what a perversion that is right
[53:24] trying to achieve god-like qualities
[53:27] without the supernatural
[53:31] now the only place that god-like
[53:34] qualities will be expressed in and
[53:36] through
[53:37] is the body of Jesus Christ
[53:41] do you believe that
[53:43] no matter what or no matter what they
[53:46] come up with
[53:47] it will always be a source of the devil
[53:52] it it'll be in it's inspired of the
[53:55] devil right because that's isn't that
[53:57] what what the whole purpose is is that
[54:00] Satan's agenda wanted to be as God show
[54:04] himself to be as God and yeah all of
[54:07] these things and so man man will have
[54:11] nothing to do with such qualities as
[54:16] this because man can never produce
[54:19] god-like qualities
[54:21] you believe that never now so so you
[54:25] know as I just reading uh uh uh some of
[54:29] the prophet and and he says this he said
[54:31] God is not going to deliver his people
[54:33] by education
[54:35] God is not going to deliver his people
[54:38] by science God is not going to deliver
[54:41] his people by denomination
[54:43] and I'll tell you this God ain't
[54:45] building his body by science God is Not
[54:49] projecting his qualities in demand
[54:52] through education science or anything
[54:55] that man has I don't care how smart they
[54:59] are and what they can do with computers
[55:00] and and these things and how controlling
[55:03] they can be it'll never be Godlike
[55:05] qualities
[55:06] can you say man see and and so science
[55:10] has never yet been able to come up with
[55:13] and create things
[55:15] ain't that right so the prophet says he
[55:18] will deliver them talking about his
[55:20] people he'll deliver them by the power
[55:23] the supernatural power of changing their
[55:28] lives and molding them into children of
[55:32] God
[55:33] that's how it's going to deliver us can
[55:35] you say man now that Deliverance has
[55:38] taken place now you believe that so
[55:41] healing of both spiritual and physical
[55:44] is is a supernatural happening Miracles
[55:48] salvation is a a supernatural happening
[55:52] you being a new creation is a a
[55:56] supernatural happening ain't that right
[55:59] amen as we know the whole armor of God
[56:02] is Supernatural amen Joy Faith uh
[56:06] Temperance godliness meekness
[56:09] long-suffering and peace and gentleness
[56:12] and and all of these things see it it
[56:14] you you it's supernatural you you take
[56:17] the man that was filled with hate and
[56:20] and Malice and and now is love is
[56:24] flowing through that man what is it it's
[56:27] a supernatural happening you you take a
[56:30] a an individual that was filled with
[56:33] fear and on the urge of having a nervous
[56:35] breakdown and anxieties and and all of
[56:39] these things and now a man a peace has
[56:42] has taken over well what's happened
[56:45] there uh us it's supernatural uh
[56:49] happening we we didn't see anything
[56:51] enter into them you know I've seen where
[56:55] you know drunk men
[56:57] um uh be staggering drunk come to the
[57:00] The Altar and and and and and and God so
[57:03] get a hold of that individual and and
[57:06] before you know it they get up and
[57:07] they're sober and never to drink again
[57:10] well we we didn't see you know something
[57:13] come into them we we we didn't
[57:16] physically give them a shot of some
[57:19] medication can you say man amen see
[57:23] they're not taking some pill that
[57:25] science has invented but God took over
[57:29] it was a it was something Supernatural
[57:33] that they themselves didn't have they a
[57:37] couldn't give it to them uh uh
[57:40] counseling couldn't give it to them it
[57:42] was it was a supernatural God that came
[57:47] and done a supernatural work ain't that
[57:49] right so here the prophet says the fruit
[57:52] of the spirit is love joy peace
[57:55] long-suffering goodness patience
[57:57] meekness he said there's not one visible
[58:00] evidence not one fleshly see it's all in
[58:06] the Supernatural realm that's right it's
[58:09] the hidden Force that's in you can you
[58:12] say man see something came in you beyond
[58:17] the powers of man beyond the abilities
[58:20] of man and it's a hidden Force inside of
[58:25] you hidden then he says it's the life of
[58:28] Jesus Christ coming back on you the
[58:32] worshiper can you save man as you laid
[58:35] your hands upon his head and confessed
[58:38] that you was wrong now we we said it
[58:41] before but brother Brown said the
[58:43] greatest curse that that the church
[58:45] that's on the church today now I believe
[58:48] that was years ago of course you know so
[58:51] so we're looking at it in a different
[58:53] light today but back then he said the
[58:56] greatest curse that's on the church
[58:58] today is not knowing what they are amen
[59:02] that's the greatest curse upon the
[59:04] church is the church don't know what
[59:07] they are can you say man so what is the
[59:10] church it's the body of Jesus Christ it
[59:13] is the body amen amen talking about
[59:15] literal God it's the literal body amen I
[59:20] understand or you know of course when I
[59:22] say literal I I I I I mean your hands
[59:26] are his hands yes there is a physical
[59:28] body up in heaven that I'm talking about
[59:31] right now here on this Earth it's a it's
[59:33] a a spiritual body but it's your hands
[59:36] that are his hands your feet that's his
[59:39] feet ain't that right amen and and so
[59:42] Paul would tell us that the church is
[59:45] the body of Christ and it's the fullness
[59:48] of him that fill us all in all it's the
[59:51] completion it's the Perfection of him
[59:54] that fill us all in all can you say man
[59:57] amen that's right so that's what the
[1:00:00] church is and as Jesus was the veil of
[1:00:04] God so is the church God's veiled today
[1:00:09] so much so that the prophet would tell
[1:00:11] us she is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:00:15] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:00:19] she is him and you say Amen even the
[1:00:24] scriptures identify her as being him a
[1:00:27] man and and brother Bradham would it
[1:00:29] took a prophet again to bring this out
[1:00:31] II Thessalonians 2 7 for the mystery of
[1:00:34] the iniquity does already work only he
[1:00:38] God who let us now let us will let until
[1:00:42] he the bride be taken out can you say
[1:00:45] Amen take it out of the way the prophet
[1:00:48] said that's the bride amen you see when
[1:00:50] God lifts his Spirit off this Earth the
[1:00:52] bride goes with him because she's the
[1:00:55] body
[1:00:56] he said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:00:59] you can you say Amen so if he's leaves
[1:01:03] this bride's leaving too amen that's
[1:01:06] right so the spirit of God has become
[1:01:10] incarnate in the Church of the Living
[1:01:12] God today
[1:01:14] amen uh the church the prophet said
[1:01:17] comes out of that Dark Age
[1:01:19] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:01:23] of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] Incarnate Word that's where we're at
[1:01:27] today Incarnate Word can you say man a
[1:01:31] man say so how is this happening now how
[1:01:35] how is this word become incarnate in US
[1:01:40] it it's beyond anything natural
[1:01:44] and you say man you go to church every
[1:01:47] day of your life and it still ain't
[1:01:49] going to happen to you
[1:01:51] you can set under the best teachings and
[1:01:53] it ain't going to happen
[1:01:55] so how's this happening 5 John 5 24
[1:01:58] verily verily Jesus says verily verily I
[1:02:01] say unto you he that heareth everybody
[1:02:03] say heareth that's the important thing
[1:02:06] right there he that heareth my word and
[1:02:09] believeth on him a man that sent me hath
[1:02:13] the everlasting life and shall not come
[1:02:15] into condemnation but his past from
[1:02:17] Death unto life now brother Branham
[1:02:20] takes that word hearing and he says now
[1:02:23] the Hebrew definition is receiveth he
[1:02:26] that heareth or he that receiveth my
[1:02:29] word ain't that right he that receiveth
[1:02:32] so he receives my word says anyone can
[1:02:35] hear it Sinners and everything else but
[1:02:38] he that receiveth my word he that can
[1:02:42] take it all
[1:02:43] not just part of it
[1:02:46] he that can believe it all and and and
[1:02:48] and and receive it into himself the
[1:02:52] prophet said when you receive the word
[1:02:54] you receive him
[1:02:57] and you say man
[1:02:59] amen when you receive the word you
[1:03:01] receive him and so that's that's how the
[1:03:05] church becomes his body
[1:03:08] and it was important for a prophet to
[1:03:10] come
[1:03:12] then you say man
[1:03:14] to bring a bride into existence but the
[1:03:18] word had to be restored back to its
[1:03:20] perfection
[1:03:23] can you say amen amen we believe dogma's
[1:03:26] and it didn't make anything out of us
[1:03:27] except Methodist Baptist denominational
[1:03:30] children
[1:03:32] can you say man it didn't produce
[1:03:35] anything
[1:03:37] but honorary no good church members
[1:03:42] but the word came
[1:03:45] and when the word was perfected
[1:03:48] that that Divine interpretation of the
[1:03:50] word was revealed to us we received it
[1:03:56] and you say man now look at the flip
[1:03:58] side of the coin
[1:04:01] brother Brown says by by the worldly
[1:04:03] Church rejecting the word
[1:04:05] makes a perfect way for Satan to come
[1:04:08] into her and incarnate himself right
[1:04:11] into her
[1:04:13] right
[1:04:14] receiving the word makes way
[1:04:18] for God to come in you
[1:04:21] rejecting the word makes a perfect way
[1:04:25] for Satan to become incarnate in the
[1:04:28] church
[1:04:29] in that nominal church denomination a
[1:04:32] worldly church can you say man incarnate
[1:04:35] himself right in her see again he is
[1:04:38] able to Incarnate himself into that
[1:04:41] church because she has rejected the
[1:04:44] Vindicated word of God
[1:04:47] it gives the devil a place to come right
[1:04:50] in and incarnate himself and he will
[1:04:54] make an image unto the beast when both
[1:04:56] the Protestant and Catholic Church come
[1:04:58] together and they're doing it right now
[1:05:03] you believe it
[1:05:04] yes sir they're doing it right now
[1:05:07] so the Church of the Living God
[1:05:11] a man is the body of God by believing
[1:05:15] the word
[1:05:16] now don't don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:05:18] doing away with the baptism of all the
[1:05:20] ghost by one Spirit you're all baptized
[1:05:22] into one body
[1:05:24] can you say Amen but let's just face it
[1:05:26] brother bran told us God don't give a
[1:05:29] person the Holy Ghost until he's
[1:05:31] recognized their faith
[1:05:33] he recognizes that there's a gene seed
[1:05:36] that's in them
[1:05:40] ain't that right
[1:05:42] you don't have to beg for the Holy Ghost
[1:05:43] you don't have to plead for the Holy
[1:05:46] Ghost
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:52] I don't think you've got a fast for the
[1:05:55] Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] if you're a real believer you'll receive
[1:05:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] so the Church of the Living God is made
[1:06:07] up of individuals
[1:06:09] that's been born of the spirit of God
[1:06:11] and it all makes up the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:14] Christ you believe that
[1:06:16] so God is still hiding behind skin
[1:06:19] and it's your skin that he's hiding
[1:06:22] behind your skin
[1:06:24] amen praise the Lord your skin
[1:06:27] no no scientific stuff
[1:06:30] this is this is the mystery
[1:06:32] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:06:35] they're trying to bring it through
[1:06:36] science but it'll never happen they're
[1:06:38] trying to bring it through education
[1:06:39] it'll never happen they're even trying
[1:06:41] to through religion it'll never happen
[1:06:43] but great is the mystery of godliness
[1:06:45] God was manifested in the flesh how in
[1:06:49] the world can that invisible God become
[1:06:51] visible in a body of today I'll tell you
[1:06:55] they received the where and they receive
[1:06:57] him
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:02] so he's hiding behind you your skin
[1:07:06] if you're in the church remember the
[1:07:08] mystery is Christ in you the hope of
[1:07:11] glory
[1:07:12] now brother Brandon says the Holy Spirit
[1:07:14] presses it the life
[1:07:16] see in there until the Life of Christ is
[1:07:19] formed in you becomes deity
[1:07:24] I know we might know all these things
[1:07:25] but I'm going to just preach it anyways
[1:07:29] the Holy Spirit presses it the life in
[1:07:33] there until the Life of Christ is formed
[1:07:37] in you becomes deity
[1:07:41] don't don't just say I've got the Holy
[1:07:44] Ghost and then you just sit and
[1:07:45] twiddling your thumbs all defeated the
[1:07:48] Holy Ghost is just going to keep
[1:07:49] pressing that life pressing that life
[1:07:51] pressing that life and as he's pressing
[1:07:54] he's getting all that junk out of you
[1:07:56] Taurus nothing but the life of Jesus
[1:07:59] Christ the deity of God flowing in you
[1:08:05] believe it
[1:08:07] this is the age of recognition
[1:08:10] in John 14 18.
[1:08:13] I read it a lot
[1:08:15] it says I will not leave you comfortable
[1:08:17] as Jesus speaking I will come to you
[1:08:20] in a little while the world seeth me no
[1:08:22] more but you see me
[1:08:24] why because the mystery is going to be
[1:08:26] opened up to you
[1:08:27] because I live you shall live also
[1:08:30] you're going to have that same
[1:08:31] quickening power living in you and at
[1:08:34] that day this day the prophet would tell
[1:08:36] us you shall know you shall recognize
[1:08:40] that I'm in my father you and me and I
[1:08:44] in you
[1:08:46] you're not going to look at him as the
[1:08:48] third person of the godhead
[1:08:50] you're going to look at him as the same
[1:08:53] God dwelling in your body
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:01] this is the day that Jesus was speaking
[1:09:03] of that we would recognize
[1:09:06] now I read this our opening scripture
[1:09:09] to hear
[1:09:11] Paul would tell us that that he's
[1:09:13] praying
[1:09:15] that that
[1:09:16] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:19] the father of Glory may give unto you
[1:09:21] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:09:24] the knowledge of him
[1:09:25] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:09:28] enlightened being open that you may know
[1:09:30] can you say man
[1:09:32] this day that prayer has been fulfilled
[1:09:39] you say man this day
[1:09:42] he was looking for this day to happen
[1:09:45] this is the day
[1:09:47] that our eyes are being opened
[1:09:50] not by a natural thing
[1:09:55] but the same way that Jesus opened the
[1:09:58] eyes of the two on their way to Emmaus
[1:10:03] it wasn't anything natural that opened
[1:10:05] their eyes
[1:10:07] can you say Amen
[1:10:09] it was Christ that opened their eyes
[1:10:13] and he did something among them
[1:10:17] science could not produce
[1:10:19] he did something among them that no
[1:10:22] intelligent man could produce but
[1:10:25] whatever he did he's still done it today
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:30] and it's Opening Our Eyes
[1:10:34] this is the day
[1:10:35] that our eyes are becoming open like the
[1:10:38] servant
[1:10:40] that was with Elisha
[1:10:43] right
[1:10:44] remember the Army surrounded the city
[1:10:47] the enemy
[1:10:48] surrounding the city and when he that
[1:10:51] servant got up oh my he was in panic
[1:10:55] because all he saw was the enemy
[1:10:57] surrounding the city
[1:10:59] Elias should come out servant is just
[1:11:03] bemoaning and and and and and and and
[1:11:05] and being all full of doubt
[1:11:08] and yet Elisha said but more are they
[1:11:11] with us than they are with him
[1:11:13] How could a man say that
[1:11:16] he wasn't depending on anything natural
[1:11:19] can you say Amen
[1:11:21] amen seen and he says the angels of God
[1:11:25] see he knew Elisha knew that the angels
[1:11:28] of God were with him ain't that right
[1:11:30] more are they that are with us than they
[1:11:33] that are with them he couldn't see them
[1:11:35] he couldn't smell them he couldn't taste
[1:11:38] them he couldn't hear of them he
[1:11:40] couldn't feel them but he knew they were
[1:11:43] there
[1:11:45] can you say man not one of his senses
[1:11:48] declared that they were there but he had
[1:11:50] believed what the prophet said
[1:11:56] if a prophet would believe in other
[1:11:57] prophet's words
[1:11:59] that was Vindicated why can't the people
[1:12:01] of God just simply believe it
[1:12:03] well I will tell you the people of God
[1:12:05] will believe it
[1:12:12] will
[1:12:14] remember in Psalms the angel of the Lord
[1:12:16] accompany them
[1:12:18] that fear Him
[1:12:20] and he delivereth them
[1:12:22] so he didn't have to fill them
[1:12:25] he didn't have to see them
[1:12:28] he didn't have to sense them
[1:12:30] can you say man
[1:12:32] he just simply believed it
[1:12:35] why he was looking to the Unseen that
[1:12:38] Supernatural element
[1:12:41] that's right he just rested in what the
[1:12:43] prophet's word said
[1:12:46] and when when the eyes of the servant
[1:12:49] came open he saw the angels all around
[1:12:52] the prophet
[1:12:54] brother Brown said the presence of God
[1:12:56] is always everybody say is always
[1:12:59] the presence of God is always with his
[1:13:02] believing children
[1:13:04] you believe that
[1:13:06] you don't have to feel him
[1:13:09] you don't have to seem
[1:13:11] s you don't have to sense him
[1:13:13] you don't have to hear him
[1:13:15] but if you can take what the prophet
[1:13:17] just said you can rest in it it's a
[1:13:20] supernatural happening our faith is not
[1:13:24] in our senses our faith is in the
[1:13:26] Supernatural
[1:13:29] God don't have to be seen for us to
[1:13:31] believe
[1:13:32] the prophet said he's always with his
[1:13:35] believing children and I believe it
[1:13:39] I believe it
[1:13:41] this day
[1:13:42] that curse is being lifted off
[1:13:47] of the Church of the Living God
[1:13:49] to where she can recognize who she is
[1:13:53] amen
[1:13:54] now I'm going to go on notice in Matthew
[1:13:57] 17 14.
[1:13:59] it says and when they were come to the
[1:14:02] multitude there came to him speaking of
[1:14:05] Jesus a certain man kneeling down to him
[1:14:07] and saying Lord have mercy on my son for
[1:14:10] he's a lunatic
[1:14:12] and sore vexed for all times he
[1:14:15] followeth Into the Fire and off into the
[1:14:17] water
[1:14:18] and I brought him to thy disciples and
[1:14:20] they could not cure him
[1:14:22] now that sounds pathetic that and and
[1:14:24] and and to be honest when you're looking
[1:14:26] at it and you say well duh
[1:14:30] they're just humans
[1:14:32] Jesus Is God hello
[1:14:37] why in the world would he take him to
[1:14:39] the disciples in the first place
[1:14:41] I need you just take him to Jesus
[1:14:45] so many mental people or people have
[1:14:48] that mental capacity today
[1:14:52] that Jesus ain't doing nothing because
[1:14:55] he ain't here in the physical body he
[1:14:57] can't heal no more he doesn't save no
[1:14:58] more he doesn't this any of the
[1:15:01] supernatural like the prophet said
[1:15:02] they've taken all the supernatural out
[1:15:03] of the Bible
[1:15:06] but here we find the prophet would tell
[1:15:09] us and the Bible even tells us that
[1:15:11] these men
[1:15:12] was given power
[1:15:16] they should have been able to cast that
[1:15:18] devil out
[1:15:20] ain't that right
[1:15:24] the prophet said these men had the word
[1:15:27] and the Word was made flesh then
[1:15:30] and the word said to them I give unto
[1:15:33] you power
[1:15:35] if it was a scientist okay yeah you can
[1:15:38] doubt that
[1:15:40] it was just an educated idiot you could
[1:15:43] doubt that
[1:15:45] this was the word telling them
[1:15:50] this wasn't some physician doctor
[1:15:54] this was the word
[1:15:56] this wasn't a seminary giving them their
[1:15:59] license
[1:16:03] this was the word
[1:16:06] so they had the power
[1:16:09] notice they had the power but they
[1:16:12] didn't have the faith to operate the
[1:16:13] power
[1:16:15] or brother Brown would tell it this way
[1:16:16] they didn't have the faith to operate
[1:16:18] the word that was in them
[1:16:21] ain't that right
[1:16:23] now now this is very critical to us
[1:16:26] because if you do not have the faith to
[1:16:30] operate the word that's in you he'll be
[1:16:33] defeated every time you'll meet the
[1:16:36] devil
[1:16:38] ain't that right
[1:16:40] you can say well I'm bride bride bride
[1:16:42] bride then you've got to have faith with
[1:16:44] that that matches that
[1:16:48] right
[1:16:49] we can read where the word says that we
[1:16:51] are the body of Jesus Christ on the
[1:16:54] earth that we've got to have faith to
[1:16:56] match that
[1:16:58] operate it
[1:17:00] now the word of God is a sword Hebrews 4
[1:17:04] and 12 says it is
[1:17:06] and the only saying that can handle the
[1:17:08] sword the prophet says is a hand of
[1:17:10] faith
[1:17:11] strong hand of faith Faith holds and
[1:17:15] grips it
[1:17:16] ain't that right
[1:17:18] you know remember I'm talking about how
[1:17:20] two people do you know and you've
[1:17:22] probably seen you know seen them you
[1:17:24] know some way of dueling two people and
[1:17:28] and and brother Brandon says well that's
[1:17:30] you and the devil
[1:17:32] amen don't you think that this is a
[1:17:34] picnic
[1:17:36] you're on playground
[1:17:38] that you're going to Coast into heaven
[1:17:40] just just on Easy Street
[1:17:43] you're fighting the devil
[1:17:46] can you say Amen
[1:17:48] amen no matter what God says about you
[1:17:51] you've got to stand Toe to Toe with the
[1:17:53] devil and believe it
[1:17:57] it's true
[1:17:59] now what is the devil why are we
[1:18:01] fighting the devil
[1:18:03] because he's trying to get you to doubt
[1:18:06] trying to get me to doubt
[1:18:08] hello
[1:18:09] that's what the prophet says he's trying
[1:18:11] to get you to doubt and so he comes to
[1:18:14] you the word comes you receive it you're
[1:18:18] excited about it but don't you think
[1:18:20] you're going to be left alone
[1:18:22] because now it's the devil's job to get
[1:18:25] you to doubt it
[1:18:27] ain't that right
[1:18:28] so listen now brother Brian says now
[1:18:31] you're sworn that you've got May ever be
[1:18:33] so good
[1:18:35] it's a million times better than his
[1:18:41] the weapon that God gave you
[1:18:44] is a million times greater
[1:18:47] than anything that the devil has to
[1:18:49] offer you
[1:18:51] whatever he comes at you with
[1:18:53] which we know he comes at us with doubt
[1:18:58] is that right
[1:19:00] so he says it's it's a million times
[1:19:02] better he's I'm going to tell you he his
[1:19:05] is not even a sword
[1:19:07] it's a stick
[1:19:09] so you've got the sword
[1:19:12] and he's got a little stick
[1:19:15] right
[1:19:16] so so don't even think that he's a match
[1:19:20] oh yeah fleshly naturally you're he's
[1:19:23] more than a match
[1:19:25] but with your weapon
[1:19:28] hello
[1:19:30] with your weapon you are way more than a
[1:19:34] match
[1:19:35] see yours is a sword but if the hand
[1:19:38] that holds that sword is weak the stick
[1:19:41] can overcome it but no matter how little
[1:19:44] this hand is if it holds the word of God
[1:19:47] with faith there's nothing going to do
[1:19:50] it it can put anything down
[1:19:55] I hope you're listening everybody say my
[1:19:58] sword can put anything
[1:20:02] down why there's deity living in you
[1:20:07] there's a supernatural element that's a
[1:20:10] part of you
[1:20:12] yes sir
[1:20:14] that's right see now notice the prophet
[1:20:17] says now when you lock with the devil he
[1:20:20] puts questions in your mind
[1:20:22] that's what prophet says that's why I
[1:20:24] tell you stay away from questions do not
[1:20:27] entertain questions
[1:20:30] can you say Amen
[1:20:33] if I listen to questions buddy I'd be
[1:20:35] defeated every day
[1:20:38] I wouldn't be here preaching to you this
[1:20:40] morning if I listen to questions
[1:20:42] hello
[1:20:44] questions constantly questions
[1:20:49] you'll question you
[1:20:50] I'm going to challenge you
[1:20:54] as to whether you're a Son of God or not
[1:20:57] and and usually where does it where does
[1:21:00] Them Questions enter
[1:21:02] in the mind
[1:21:04] thank God for your Prophet I don't think
[1:21:06] there's ever another Minister outside
[1:21:08] this message that tells us that the
[1:21:09] battlefield is in the mind
[1:21:13] all right man
[1:21:15] that God would send us a prophet to
[1:21:18] prepare us for this age
[1:21:21] this battle that is now at hand
[1:21:25] can you say Amen
[1:21:26] so he puts questions in your mind is a
[1:21:29] soul
[1:21:30] or is it not so see questions
[1:21:33] brother Brown says he's pressing you
[1:21:36] saying say it's wrong
[1:21:40] see it's wrong you mustn't believe it
[1:21:43] what's he talking about this Bible
[1:21:45] this message
[1:21:52] what is it and it's sad to say we got
[1:21:55] preachers that are putting questions in
[1:21:56] the people's mind
[1:21:58] they'll get up and say well this message
[1:21:59] is just becoming a a cult
[1:22:03] that's all they see is the negative
[1:22:06] what they're looking at is something
[1:22:08] negative and I'll just tell you that's
[1:22:10] an unbelieving spirit
[1:22:16] and I I challenge you young people and
[1:22:19] you parents be careful who you send your
[1:22:21] children what camps you send your
[1:22:23] children to
[1:22:25] be careful as to what programs you go to
[1:22:29] I'm telling you amen because everybody's
[1:22:32] saying message don't mean that they're
[1:22:34] all right with the word
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:39] there's many people many ministers that
[1:22:41] are promoting their own agendas
[1:22:43] they're so caught up in these other
[1:22:45] things and they're putting questions out
[1:22:47] before the people
[1:22:51] that's of the devil
[1:22:53] can you say Amen
[1:22:55] that's right
[1:22:56] so the prophet is telling us see
[1:23:01] that it's the devil
[1:23:03] that putting questions in your mind
[1:23:08] the prophet says don't listen to him
[1:23:12] just believe the word
[1:23:15] didn't you say Amen
[1:23:18] and when you just believe that word he
[1:23:21] says then you will direct that sword
[1:23:23] right straight into the devil's heart
[1:23:30] hello
[1:23:32] you know
[1:23:33] the prophet said a man can live in such
[1:23:35] a place
[1:23:36] condition that the devil don't know what
[1:23:38] to do with them
[1:23:39] now that's where this bride's headed and
[1:23:42] I believe she's here
[1:23:45] he'll come at her on all fronts
[1:23:48] and she's still standing
[1:23:51] hello
[1:23:52] I know you know you may not like the
[1:23:54] battle that's raging and you say my god
[1:23:57] when can I have peace your peace is just
[1:23:59] beyond the river
[1:24:01] but you just keep pressing on because
[1:24:03] every time you say Amen to that word
[1:24:05] you're defeating the devil every time
[1:24:08] you're lifting your hands glorifying God
[1:24:10] you're defeating the devil every time
[1:24:13] you confess the word and say salvation
[1:24:15] is mine Deliverance is mine Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] is mine the Rapture is mine you're
[1:24:20] defeating the Devil Keep defeating him
[1:24:27] can you say man
[1:24:29] you're a body of believers
[1:24:32] Supernatural
[1:24:35] y'all brother Brown said then when I'm
[1:24:37] pressing with faith with the word saying
[1:24:40] everybody say sang confessing
[1:24:46] don't just sit there and be silent let
[1:24:49] the devil beat you up in your mind
[1:24:51] you start speaking the word
[1:25:00] so now
[1:25:02] brother Branham
[1:25:04] you know indirectly he lets us know the
[1:25:06] battles he goes through
[1:25:08] he said see now he's going to make it
[1:25:10] personal for him then when I am pressing
[1:25:13] with faith with the word saying Satan
[1:25:16] Jesus Christ commissioned me to do this
[1:25:21] and we lock
[1:25:23] many times brother bran will talk about
[1:25:25] his stories
[1:25:27] of how the angel met him and all that
[1:25:29] you know why I I don't believe it was
[1:25:31] just for the people's sake I believe it
[1:25:33] was to let the devil know that he still
[1:25:36] believed it
[1:25:38] Ten Years Later he's still telling about
[1:25:40] that angel 20 years later he's still
[1:25:43] telling about the angel
[1:25:46] can you say man
[1:25:48] brother Brandon was just human just like
[1:25:50] you and I
[1:25:51] he even told his wife says I don't even
[1:25:53] know if I'm called to preach
[1:25:55] where in the world would that come from
[1:25:59] the devil
[1:26:00] and thank God he had a wife to tell him
[1:26:03] to stop babying around
[1:26:05] don't you listen to that
[1:26:13] I think that's one good thing you've got
[1:26:15] good
[1:26:17] good Christian
[1:26:19] spouses
[1:26:20] and when you start bellyaching they can
[1:26:22] look at you and say shut up
[1:26:25] maybe not in that way but it's directly
[1:26:27] what they want to say
[1:26:28] quit belly aching around
[1:26:31] God's called you
[1:26:33] when I start bellyaching my wife just
[1:26:35] just tells me but Sean
[1:26:37] you got to quit listen to that devil
[1:26:40] and you know what she'll she'll she'll
[1:26:42] do and it's it's it's humbling sometimes
[1:26:44] for me but she'll say remember what you
[1:26:46] preached
[1:26:49] yeah
[1:26:50] you gotta use it on yourself too
[1:26:53] that shuts me up
[1:26:58] I thank God for my wife
[1:27:00] I'll tell you how it is sometimes
[1:27:03] can you say man we don't need to call
[1:27:06] each other for pity parties
[1:27:08] we need to call each other to to hear
[1:27:11] truth
[1:27:12] not say oh you poor little thing but say
[1:27:15] no get up get up
[1:27:17] you can fight this thing
[1:27:19] you can endure this thing we're backing
[1:27:22] you God's behind you
[1:27:27] hello
[1:27:28] see so he says see I I he says Satan
[1:27:32] Jesus Christ commissioned me to do this
[1:27:34] thing and we lock and raise up with that
[1:27:37] hand of faith and say an angel of God
[1:27:40] met me Yonder and set it so and the
[1:27:43] first thing you know it throws the
[1:27:45] swords right straight in and he's
[1:27:47] conquered it says and I come to
[1:27:50] challenge you and thus saith the Lord
[1:27:52] that's the believer when he has Faith to
[1:27:55] handle the word
[1:27:57] brothers and sisters you've already got
[1:27:59] the saith the Lord you don't need
[1:28:01] somebody to say thus saith the Lord your
[1:28:03] bride you need to take what the prophet
[1:28:06] said
[1:28:08] the prophet is thus saith the Lord and
[1:28:10] if the prophet said you can make it you
[1:28:12] can make it if the prophet said take God
[1:28:15] at his word then take God at his word if
[1:28:18] the prophet said your sword which is the
[1:28:21] word is a million times greater than
[1:28:23] that saith the Lord to you
[1:28:26] believe it
[1:28:28] that's right that's right
[1:28:32] now notice
[1:28:36] Satan's got a stick
[1:28:38] all right
[1:28:39] so remember that it's just a stick
[1:28:42] so what is Satan's weapon to you now
[1:28:45] there's what brother Brown's asking now
[1:28:47] in another place
[1:28:50] he with that stick
[1:28:52] his weapon to you is is to try to get
[1:28:56] you to disbelieve your weapon
[1:28:59] foreign
[1:29:03] now what a knucklehead
[1:29:05] could you imagine
[1:29:07] you got this sharp razor edge sword it's
[1:29:10] there it's glisten it's sharp you know
[1:29:12] what it can do
[1:29:13] you cut tomatoes with it
[1:29:18] and then some old guy
[1:29:21] has a little old twig
[1:29:24] and he said I'm going to beat your head
[1:29:26] off
[1:29:27] you know what
[1:29:30] try it
[1:29:37] that he just start staying he just
[1:29:39] stands there
[1:29:40] he ain't gonna approaching with that
[1:29:42] stick
[1:29:43] then he starts talking to you
[1:29:49] I don't know why you're willing that
[1:29:50] thing
[1:29:52] you know that thing only Cuts tomatoes
[1:29:56] I bet you anything if you ever try to
[1:29:58] hit that thing it'll tickle me
[1:30:02] just yeah just swing it it'll just
[1:30:04] tickle me
[1:30:09] and the goofball that has the sword
[1:30:12] starts listening
[1:30:17] I'm really feeling foolish with this
[1:30:18] thing
[1:30:20] I probably shouldn't even brought it out
[1:30:23] forgive me
[1:30:24] puts it down
[1:30:26] and now the devil says all right now I
[1:30:28] got you poof
[1:30:31] right
[1:30:32] but what happens
[1:30:35] that's the same thing we do
[1:30:37] when the Devil comes at us
[1:30:40] he gets us to disbelieve this
[1:30:44] you're only standing by this
[1:30:48] that's the only way you can defeat the
[1:30:49] Devil is by this
[1:30:58] so he says if he can get you to
[1:30:59] disbelieve your weapon is equivalent
[1:31:02] if he gets you to believe that your
[1:31:04] weapon is not strong enough he's he's
[1:31:06] disarmed you
[1:31:08] how many Christians are disarmed
[1:31:11] going to church disarmed
[1:31:13] trying to be a father disarmed trying to
[1:31:16] be a mother disarmed trying to be a
[1:31:18] parent trying to be a Godly young person
[1:31:21] disarmed
[1:31:23] hello
[1:31:24] now just imagine young people going to
[1:31:26] schools these days disarmed
[1:31:29] just imagine trying to go to work
[1:31:30] disarmed trying to come to church even
[1:31:33] disarmed
[1:31:34] trying trying to trying to just you know
[1:31:37] bring peace you know having a a loving
[1:31:40] marriage disarmed trying to have you
[1:31:43] raise your children in the in the
[1:31:45] admonition of the Lord and yet disarmed
[1:31:48] you can't do it in this age
[1:31:56] amen
[1:31:58] so the prophet goes on Jesus had faith
[1:32:02] with his power
[1:32:06] and he said in John 5 19 I want to
[1:32:09] listen how this Faith worked
[1:32:11] Jesus said I can do nothing
[1:32:13] of myself
[1:32:16] he wasn't trying to do it in himself
[1:32:19] he wasn't trying to be a Christian in
[1:32:21] himself
[1:32:23] he wasn't trying to work the works of
[1:32:25] God by himself
[1:32:27] he wasn't trying to cast out Devils by
[1:32:29] himself can you say Amen it wasn't
[1:32:32] leaning to a natural source he was
[1:32:36] leading to the supernatural
[1:32:38] I can do nothing of myself
[1:32:42] it's the father
[1:32:45] right
[1:32:47] so the prophet says see he relied
[1:32:49] everybody say he relied on what he was
[1:32:54] ain't that right well what was he he was
[1:32:57] the veil of God
[1:33:01] he was the fleshly Veil
[1:33:03] the human Tabernacle of God
[1:33:06] and he so believed it
[1:33:08] oh my
[1:33:10] God that he relied upon it
[1:33:12] Satan you can come at me but there's
[1:33:15] something greater in me
[1:33:17] yes I'm just Flesh and Bones just like
[1:33:21] anyone else yachting out and don't get
[1:33:23] me wrong but but listen he was subject
[1:33:25] to things just Temptations just like you
[1:33:28] were mind battles just like you were
[1:33:30] sickness just like you were
[1:33:34] can you say man yes I know he was virgin
[1:33:37] born but think of it if you're born
[1:33:39] again you are redeemed born
[1:33:48] is knowing that he was the word
[1:33:50] notice he had faith in God who made him
[1:33:53] the word
[1:33:55] he was God the word and they was in him
[1:33:58] and that gave him Faith because he
[1:34:01] understood everybody say he understood
[1:34:03] his position
[1:34:05] he knowed what he was because the
[1:34:08] scripture had said uh uh he was this and
[1:34:11] here every scripture tied in to prove
[1:34:14] that he was exactly what the scripture
[1:34:16] said he would be and he knew what he was
[1:34:22] he wasn't relying
[1:34:26] he wasn't reliant on his own abilities
[1:34:28] and I'll be honest he wasn't relying on
[1:34:30] the church's abilities
[1:34:31] he didn't have to be prophesied over
[1:34:35] he didn't have to be called out by
[1:34:37] somebody
[1:34:38] he didn't have to have someone to have a
[1:34:40] vision about him and a dream about him
[1:34:42] he didn't have to have somebody you know
[1:34:44] say yeah I say Unity
[1:34:45] a man for him to recognize who he was he
[1:34:50] knew who he was by what the word said
[1:34:53] can you say amen and yet the word did
[1:34:56] not call him by name the word did not
[1:34:58] say uh behold you know uh uh uh uh I'll
[1:35:02] not see Jesus my Holy One uh us let him
[1:35:06] see corruption right it didn't mention
[1:35:10] his name he said it just said I'll not
[1:35:12] let uh see my holy one seed let my Holy
[1:35:14] One see corruption see I'll not leave
[1:35:17] him in that in that condition ain't that
[1:35:18] right I can't uh you you know the
[1:35:21] scripture I'm referring to he didn't
[1:35:23] have to have and literally see his name
[1:35:25] in that scripture but by faith he knew
[1:35:28] who it was
[1:35:32] amen amen that's why before even died
[1:35:35] and rose again he told him to destroy
[1:35:36] this temple in three days I'm going to
[1:35:37] raise it up again
[1:35:39] and brother Brown said he based that
[1:35:40] quote on the scripture
[1:35:46] he believed what the word said about him
[1:35:49] so he didn't look for signs
[1:35:52] to give him faith in what he was
[1:35:56] remember Jesus said this wicked and
[1:35:58] adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:36:01] signs
[1:36:02] ain't that right they're seeking after
[1:36:05] signs Jesus said that to the believer
[1:36:09] the signs would follow the believer
[1:36:12] but notice what goes before the believer
[1:36:15] the where the word goes before the
[1:36:18] believer the believer is following the
[1:36:20] word the believer is looking to the word
[1:36:22] and the signs are following that
[1:36:25] believer
[1:36:28] can you say Amen
[1:36:34] so notice Jesus was God
[1:36:38] not giving Faith because he understood
[1:36:40] his position
[1:36:42] he said he knew what he was therefore he
[1:36:45] relied upon what God had made him
[1:36:49] you understand that church
[1:36:53] if if you just excuse me but
[1:36:56] you know your natural birth made you one
[1:36:58] way
[1:36:59] your spiritual birth made you another
[1:37:01] way
[1:37:03] don't rely on your natural
[1:37:07] right rely up on what God made you to be
[1:37:10] can you say Amen
[1:37:12] because what your rebirth is it's
[1:37:13] according to the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:37:18] ain't that right
[1:37:19] so that give him Faith see so he said he
[1:37:22] relied upon what God made him and if he
[1:37:25] did that then can't we rely upon what
[1:37:27] God made us as Believers these signs
[1:37:30] shall follow them that believe he had
[1:37:32] faith in what he was and if you are a
[1:37:33] Believer you have faith in what you are
[1:37:35] you are a believer
[1:37:39] and if you've got faith in God the Bible
[1:37:41] says over here if our heart condemns us
[1:37:44] then we can't have faith but if our
[1:37:46] heart condemns us don't condemn us then
[1:37:49] then we have faith we have confidence
[1:37:51] towards God can you say amen amen in
[1:37:54] other words if your heart's condemning
[1:37:55] you over a sin that you've committed and
[1:37:57] it's not under the blood get that sin
[1:37:59] under the blood because you ain't going
[1:38:01] any further
[1:38:04] get it confessed
[1:38:07] and we know what the prophet says
[1:38:09] if you cheated on your wife confess to
[1:38:11] your wife don't go to God
[1:38:17] right
[1:38:18] you know our brothers got a ill ill
[1:38:21] towards you
[1:38:23] the Bible says don't even come to this
[1:38:25] Altar and start praying to God said
[1:38:28] leave your gift at that altar you go to
[1:38:30] your brother you make that right
[1:38:35] so many people forget all that right
[1:38:39] you can't go any further with God until
[1:38:40] you do that
[1:38:42] you got to repent get everything right
[1:38:45] then when you make it right
[1:38:48] then you've got you've got a foundation
[1:38:50] to stand on
[1:38:52] because Satan's going to tell you all
[1:38:53] kinds of nonsense he'll even bring up
[1:38:56] your past
[1:38:57] because he works on that memory
[1:39:00] works on affections
[1:39:02] right
[1:39:03] true
[1:39:07] I remember as just 16 year old boy 15
[1:39:10] year old boy going to votech learning
[1:39:12] electricity they played him love songs
[1:39:14] and all that rock and roll and all that
[1:39:16] every season just about then songs start
[1:39:18] popping up in my head
[1:39:21] years later
[1:39:23] I don't know why memories
[1:39:26] it just it's just constantly Satan
[1:39:28] bringing trying to bring them up trying
[1:39:30] to bring them up
[1:39:32] hello certain things in your life
[1:39:34] certain seasons
[1:39:37] he's all the time trying to bring it up
[1:39:39] he said well I thought I was forgiven I
[1:39:41] thought I was over all that I saw that
[1:39:42] hey Satan uses anything
[1:39:45] hello
[1:39:46] because this flesh is still subject to
[1:39:49] Temptations
[1:39:51] this flesh is still weak
[1:39:54] we're talking about the soul
[1:39:58] can you say man so if your heart
[1:40:00] condemns just not then we have
[1:40:03] confidence towards God but as long as
[1:40:05] you're doing things that's wrong you
[1:40:06] can't have confidence towards God you'll
[1:40:09] automatically know listen you'll
[1:40:12] automatically know you're wrong
[1:40:15] hello
[1:40:17] and notice notice what he says now if
[1:40:20] your heart's condemning you and you know
[1:40:22] you're wrong he said you automatically
[1:40:24] put yourself back there a sinner by
[1:40:26] knowing that you're wrong
[1:40:31] Sinners don't get nowhere with God
[1:40:34] people living in sin don't live don't
[1:40:36] get anywhere with God
[1:40:39] ain't that right
[1:40:40] remember the prophet that was called to
[1:40:42] pray for the sick he lied to that lawyer
[1:40:47] try to go pray for that baby nothing
[1:40:49] would happen
[1:40:50] and his heart was condemning him all the
[1:40:52] time
[1:40:53] what about that lie you told
[1:40:55] but when he went and made that right
[1:40:58] not to God to the lawyer
[1:41:02] then he repented to God
[1:41:04] that baby was made whole
[1:41:07] is that right
[1:41:09] so you automatically put yourself back
[1:41:11] there a sinner not in the sense that you
[1:41:15] are a sinner
[1:41:16] but you lose power
[1:41:23] you don't have to get saved all over
[1:41:24] again don't have to get baptized all
[1:41:27] over again
[1:41:29] hello
[1:41:30] but when your heart don't condemn you
[1:41:32] you know you're a Believer and there's
[1:41:34] nothing between you and God you can ask
[1:41:36] what you will and know that it'll be
[1:41:38] given because it's the word that's given
[1:41:40] to you just like it was given to those
[1:41:42] disciples
[1:41:44] now notice we're super race of people
[1:41:47] are we not
[1:41:50] why because we have Supernatural power
[1:41:53] with Supernatural signs through a
[1:41:56] supernatural belief in a supernatural
[1:41:58] word coming from a supernatural God
[1:42:02] that's what the prophet says
[1:42:05] it's a supernatural God in a
[1:42:07] supernatural body living in a natural
[1:42:09] people
[1:42:13] and they he says they that know their
[1:42:16] God shall do exploits great exploits and
[1:42:19] show Supernatural signs a people
[1:42:22] Abraham's seed a sign of the
[1:42:25] supernatural Christ risen from the dead
[1:42:28] supernaturally
[1:42:30] they're not going to reflect a church
[1:42:32] doctrine they're not going to return
[1:42:33] reflect something natural they're going
[1:42:36] to reflect the supernatural Christ that
[1:42:39] he's risen supernaturally from the dead
[1:42:44] living in them
[1:42:48] now listen there's nothing natural
[1:42:52] there's nothing
[1:42:54] in the natural it makes us a super race
[1:42:59] I'm going to go on I hope I ain't born
[1:43:01] yet but
[1:43:02] I hope we'll help you
[1:43:03] every Shield of the believer is
[1:43:05] Supernatural the prophet says
[1:43:07] everything that belongs in the realm of
[1:43:10] Christianity is worked by Supernatural
[1:43:14] then another place he said God is
[1:43:17] calling a church in the Realms of
[1:43:19] Supernatural
[1:43:21] can you say man on the day of Pentecost
[1:43:24] the church was birthed by the
[1:43:26] supernatural
[1:43:27] ain't that right so outside of being in
[1:43:30] that body of Christ you're in the
[1:43:33] natural everything all religions are
[1:43:35] man-made all denominations are man-made
[1:43:38] all Creeds and traditions are man-made
[1:43:41] most of non-denominations are man-made
[1:43:45] all seminaries are man-made can you say
[1:43:48] man why they are inspired by man they
[1:43:51] are directed by man controlled by man
[1:43:54] taught by man psychology comes from man
[1:43:58] Theologian theology comes from man
[1:44:00] legalism is the works of man formalism
[1:44:03] is the product of man they've made it
[1:44:06] all about man man made altar calls you
[1:44:10] know good and well brother Brown wasn't
[1:44:12] against alter calls what he was against
[1:44:15] is men making them alter calls men
[1:44:18] dragging the people up people dragging
[1:44:20] other people up or or using the you know
[1:44:23] Grandma loved you your Mama Prayed For
[1:44:25] You years ago and da da working on that
[1:44:27] memory
[1:44:30] man-made
[1:44:32] can you say Amen shake hands with the
[1:44:35] preacher to be accepted in the church
[1:44:36] put your name on the roll
[1:44:39] to be belonged to the church but to be
[1:44:41] in God's Church it takes the
[1:44:43] supernatural to put you in
[1:44:47] this is a supernatural body
[1:44:53] notice II Corinthians 5 17 therefore If
[1:44:56] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:44:58] creature or creation
[1:45:00] listen old things are passed away
[1:45:04] behold all things are become new
[1:45:06] now listen to me now we know what the
[1:45:09] prophet said passed away that word
[1:45:11] passed away means change to another
[1:45:15] Hallelujah brother around talks about it
[1:45:18] in in the future home and and he talked
[1:45:21] about the new Heaven and the new Earth
[1:45:24] right the old Heaven the old Earth
[1:45:26] passed away the new Heaven and the new
[1:45:29] Earth comes and brother Bradham takes
[1:45:31] that scripture in Leviticus and begins
[1:45:33] to speak on the eighth day
[1:45:36] ain't that rack and he tells us that the
[1:45:39] new heavens and the new Earth starts on
[1:45:42] the new Eighth Day on the eighth day can
[1:45:44] you say Amen the Millennium is on the
[1:45:46] seventh day
[1:45:48] ain't that right then he says the Eighth
[1:45:51] Day speaks of Eternal things
[1:45:55] it speaks of Eternity as she rolls
[1:45:58] around without a stopping place
[1:46:03] new he said it's beyond time it's beyond
[1:46:07] see it's beyond man-made things
[1:46:10] he said seven days only has to do with
[1:46:13] the old creation world time
[1:46:17] but the Eighth Day deals with new
[1:46:21] creation
[1:46:22] not old creation
[1:46:25] not your sex-born life
[1:46:30] not dealing with you as a sinner
[1:46:32] not dealing with your natural history
[1:46:35] not dealing with your natural family
[1:46:37] tree
[1:46:38] can you say amen that's right see it
[1:46:42] deals with New Creation God even tell
[1:46:45] the people that on the eighth day don't
[1:46:47] work
[1:46:48] don't do any severe work on that day can
[1:46:51] you say Amen brother Brandon would tell
[1:46:53] us Jesus raised from the dead on the
[1:46:57] eighth day
[1:47:00] no scientists raised him up
[1:47:03] no education raised him up
[1:47:06] no man-made scheme raised him up no
[1:47:08] Theologian raised him up it was
[1:47:10] Supernatural
[1:47:14] hello Church
[1:47:16] something Supernatural that was living
[1:47:19] in him raise that body up
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:25] the church was inaugurated or birthed on
[1:47:29] the eighth day on the day of Pentecost
[1:47:31] and man had nothing to do with it
[1:47:34] it came from on high
[1:47:36] that same spirit that was in Christ Came
[1:47:39] Upon them in a pillar of Fire
[1:47:42] hello
[1:47:44] notice where is the bride standing today
[1:47:49] she's been called out she has nothing to
[1:47:52] do with denominations
[1:47:54] denomination has nothing to do with her
[1:47:58] she's been called out of the
[1:47:59] denominational ages we are not part of
[1:48:02] the seventh age
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:05] brother Brown said the seventh Church
[1:48:07] age is the Pentecostal laodicean age
[1:48:11] but we have been called out of that age
[1:48:15] can you say man
[1:48:17] that church has reflected every other
[1:48:20] Church age Pentecostal age reflected
[1:48:22] every other Church age and look where
[1:48:25] they are they're worse than any other
[1:48:26] age
[1:48:28] can you say man that we as we said last
[1:48:31] Sunday we've been called out we've been
[1:48:33] hewed out chopped out for his name
[1:48:39] ain't that right and every believer that
[1:48:42] goes into the body of Christ is a new
[1:48:46] creation
[1:48:49] oh
[1:48:51] God has brought a new beginning in your
[1:48:54] life
[1:48:57] aren't you glad for that
[1:48:59] he did it with the token for Israel
[1:49:02] it was New Beginnings for them
[1:49:05] he even gave him a new time
[1:49:08] a new calendar
[1:49:10] a new beginning
[1:49:13] you know Israel has their own time clock
[1:49:17] their own calendars
[1:49:20] God gave it to them under that token
[1:49:26] praise the Lord
[1:49:28] old things are passed away behold all
[1:49:31] things are become new
[1:49:34] notice brother Brown said it does not
[1:49:37] have anything to do with the literal
[1:49:38] things
[1:49:39] it's beyond that it's into the kingdom
[1:49:42] of God with eternal life
[1:49:44] with the predestinated that never did
[1:49:47] start
[1:49:50] rolling back around
[1:49:53] back to Eternity
[1:49:55] it never started on any other day or any
[1:49:58] day you wasn't saved on any day you was
[1:50:02] always saved
[1:50:04] you were trapped in this dimension of
[1:50:07] time in this body of time
[1:50:10] hello
[1:50:13] but we ain't talking about your natural
[1:50:15] origin
[1:50:16] we're talking of what you were in the
[1:50:18] mind of God
[1:50:20] this church is not reflecting a natural
[1:50:22] origin
[1:50:24] tell us who began this church in this
[1:50:27] natural what teacher began this church
[1:50:29] it wasn't brother Branham
[1:50:34] but that pillar fire did
[1:50:38] God did can you say Amen that church was
[1:50:41] started by God and it'll never be able
[1:50:43] to be defeated by any man
[1:50:47] bless the Lord
[1:50:50] see Jesus just come to redeem that but
[1:50:53] you were safe from the beginning because
[1:50:56] you had eternal life to begin with
[1:50:58] a trout fish can never be a gar or a
[1:51:01] tadpole he might be in the same water
[1:51:03] with him but he was from the beginning a
[1:51:06] trout
[1:51:07] the net only caught him but he was that
[1:51:09] from the beginning
[1:51:11] see you enter into life not keeping a
[1:51:15] day or Shadow Paul said over there see
[1:51:18] you in the fourth Hebrews 4 you keep
[1:51:21] days and shadows and things like that
[1:51:23] I'm scared of your experience we don't
[1:51:26] pass into certain days and orders you
[1:51:29] pass from Death unto eternal life not
[1:51:33] days and times you pass into
[1:51:36] eternity that's the holy convocation
[1:51:39] see you're done he said it has passed
[1:51:42] through time and dropped into eternity
[1:51:44] again not keeping of days keeping of
[1:51:46] sabbaths and new moons and things like
[1:51:48] that but have passed changed your form
[1:51:51] not annihilated but passed from Death
[1:51:54] unto life eternal oh what the Bible does
[1:51:57] teach us pass from one to another
[1:52:02] it's all right
[1:52:04] another place eight cannot be counted
[1:52:06] with the weak see the the weak cannot be
[1:52:10] counted eight days in a week you can't
[1:52:12] do it because there's only seven days in
[1:52:14] a week count it any way you want to
[1:52:16] Sunday is the first day of the week you
[1:52:19] count seven then you've got to go back
[1:52:21] in and start all over again
[1:52:25] that's what this body of Believers is
[1:52:33] he said and we lived all through these
[1:52:35] types in here but when you hit the
[1:52:37] eighth you go into eternity
[1:52:39] you don't come by laws and rituals
[1:52:45] and orders
[1:52:47] you come by predestination
[1:52:50] I hope you understand nothing natural
[1:52:57] there is a genuine holy convocation
[1:53:00] we're ending the seventh Church age the
[1:53:03] Pentecostal age do you see it we're
[1:53:05] entering that Holy convocation we are
[1:53:08] entering into that real genuine eternity
[1:53:10] where the church is called not to some
[1:53:13] station Sunday nomination but in to
[1:53:16] Eternity with their Eternal King you've
[1:53:20] passed into eternity where you came from
[1:53:24] you was there to begin with here you are
[1:53:29] now
[1:53:30] back
[1:53:32] and we're and and your whole journey is
[1:53:35] going back
[1:53:36] back back
[1:53:38] can you say man
[1:53:42] that's why we're not into politics
[1:53:46] that's why we're not trying to hold up
[1:53:47] the world system
[1:53:50] we're going back
[1:53:53] so you're not a product of some man-made
[1:53:55] Creed you're not a product of some
[1:53:56] church doctrine you're not a product of
[1:53:59] some good deed that you've done
[1:54:01] we are now realizing more and more that
[1:54:05] we are an attribute of God
[1:54:09] we are if we're or we're a fallen
[1:54:12] thought of God
[1:54:13] so we had a form of eternal life within
[1:54:17] us in seed form
[1:54:19] and we are an expressed attribute of God
[1:54:22] on Earth as to what he thought us to be
[1:54:26] in the beginning
[1:54:29] and you say man and if you're not that
[1:54:32] the prophet says
[1:54:35] then you'll never be there to begin with
[1:54:38] no matter what you do
[1:54:41] so we are Beyond man-made things
[1:54:44] so notice you cannot believe
[1:54:47] unless God gives you the ability to
[1:54:49] believe
[1:54:50] It's Supernatural
[1:54:52] you cannot see or understand the things
[1:54:54] of God unless God supernaturally opens
[1:54:57] the eyes of your understanding
[1:55:00] it's supernaturally revealed
[1:55:03] the pull that we feel towards God
[1:55:06] is nothing worked up by man
[1:55:10] It's Supernatural
[1:55:12] for John 6 44 says no man can come to me
[1:55:16] except the Father which hath sent me
[1:55:19] draw him
[1:55:21] if you've got a desire to serve God with
[1:55:24] all your heart
[1:55:27] don't you count that as something small
[1:55:32] don't you think oh I just got excited
[1:55:35] watch it as it stays with you
[1:55:39] then you know that's God
[1:55:43] see that's why we don't beg people to
[1:55:46] come to the altar
[1:55:48] we we don't need to beg people to come
[1:55:51] to church we don't need to beg people to
[1:55:53] get you know it's it's got to be in the
[1:55:56] heart
[1:55:58] can you say man
[1:56:00] it has to come from the supernatural now
[1:56:03] as I get ready to close
[1:56:05] brother Branham talked about a man
[1:56:08] who thought he had crossed the line of
[1:56:10] Mercy
[1:56:15] oh
[1:56:18] this man had spent years trying to get
[1:56:22] saved
[1:56:24] his wife had gone to a meeting and got
[1:56:26] saved and received the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:28] here he was trying to get saved and he
[1:56:29] he couldn't
[1:56:32] so he came to brother Branham and told
[1:56:34] him
[1:56:36] that he had crossed the line to where he
[1:56:39] couldn't get saved and
[1:56:42] the old man the prophet
[1:56:46] looks at him and says oh I don't know
[1:56:49] about that
[1:56:52] I'm so glad brother Brown wasn't a
[1:56:54] legalist
[1:56:59] this man had went to Billy Graham's
[1:57:01] meeting and at the end of the service
[1:57:02] they asked those that to raise their
[1:57:05] hand who wanted to be saved so he raised
[1:57:07] his hand
[1:57:08] went down to the altar they took him
[1:57:10] into a room and told him he needed to
[1:57:12] accept Jesus he got down on his knees
[1:57:14] and prayed
[1:57:16] they asked him you believe in Jesus
[1:57:18] Christ and he said he did and that he
[1:57:21] accepted him as his personal savior they
[1:57:24] told him well then you're saved
[1:57:27] but this man told Brother Brown and said
[1:57:29] nothing had happened nothing's happened
[1:57:32] so
[1:57:33] a couple years later he went to the
[1:57:35] three free
[1:57:37] not the three free Methodist people
[1:57:41] and they told him you know that he had
[1:57:43] to get happy enough to shout
[1:57:45] so he says you know ah they begin to
[1:57:48] pray
[1:57:48] over me and he said I got I got happy to
[1:57:51] where I started shouting
[1:57:53] they told me I got it see yachten got it
[1:57:57] and sanctification all he said but when
[1:57:59] I left he said I just I still didn't
[1:58:02] have it he said I
[1:58:04] you know and so then he goes to a
[1:58:06] Robert's meeting so he take him into
[1:58:09] another room
[1:58:11] and they tell him well you know if you
[1:58:14] to receive the Holy Ghost you got to
[1:58:16] speak in tongues
[1:58:18] or he ain't got it so they prayed over
[1:58:20] him until he spoke in tongues they said
[1:58:23] oh you got it now
[1:58:24] he said but when I left the meeting he
[1:58:26] said I didn't have it
[1:58:28] right you know
[1:58:29] and and so he says I don't know what to
[1:58:32] do now he's coming to brother Branham
[1:58:35] he said I've been to Shreveport down to
[1:58:37] Shreveport the voice of healing they
[1:58:39] told me that you was a prophet to come
[1:58:40] up here and you'd be able to reveal to
[1:58:43] me when the spirit come on you what was
[1:58:45] my trouble now listen to what brother
[1:58:47] Brown's saying
[1:58:49] he says he said see this man's telling
[1:58:52] him well you're a prophet so now
[1:58:54] you can reveal to me my trouble
[1:58:58] and brother Branham notice the answer
[1:59:00] brother you don't have to be a prophet
[1:59:04] to do that
[1:59:07] the word of God settles that
[1:59:10] sometimes we think we need a prophet oh
[1:59:12] brother Brandon was here
[1:59:14] you know then I'd know no
[1:59:17] I mean here is a man that is expressing
[1:59:20] to brother Brown I've crossed the line
[1:59:23] I can't get help but here's your Prophet
[1:59:25] could you tell me red Brown says you
[1:59:28] don't need me
[1:59:29] the word tells you
[1:59:32] and and so he says you don't have to be
[1:59:35] a prophet of that I it don't need a
[1:59:37] prophecy
[1:59:39] the only thing is you're just confused
[1:59:44] how many confused people are today
[1:59:48] by all kinds of nonsense that's been in
[1:59:51] the past and
[1:59:53] you know teachers preachers whatever and
[1:59:57] they just confuse the people
[2:00:00] notice what brother Brandon starts doing
[2:00:02] brother Branham asking did you always
[2:00:05] love the Lord Jesus the man said well
[2:00:07] I've always belonged to the Presbyterian
[2:00:10] Church
[2:00:12] brother Branham asked him what happened
[2:00:14] what took place then that you changed
[2:00:17] your mind all at once
[2:00:20] he said well my wife went down to the
[2:00:22] Pentecostals and she got the spirit and
[2:00:24] she come back up and said she was happy
[2:00:28] brother Branham asked him said well what
[2:00:29] did you think about that did you
[2:00:31] criticize it
[2:00:32] he said no
[2:00:34] he said I just thought well I'll see how
[2:00:37] it lasts
[2:00:38] and said it went on and she seemed to
[2:00:41] have it
[2:00:42] the man said one day I was coming in for
[2:00:45] making a cell out in the yard and I
[2:00:46] happened to reach in my pocket and
[2:00:48] somebody had given me a little track and
[2:00:51] said I sit down in the office begin to
[2:00:53] read this track and said the awfullest
[2:00:55] feeling come over me that I ought to get
[2:00:57] right with God
[2:00:58] and he said I've been searching ever
[2:01:00] since
[2:01:01] brother Branham asked him when this
[2:01:03] feeling came over you you've never been
[2:01:05] able to get out of it he said no sir I
[2:01:07] haven't
[2:01:08] notice the answer
[2:01:10] well that's when
[2:01:12] you receive Christ
[2:01:15] what
[2:01:17] when Christ knocking at your door
[2:01:21] and you yielded to it
[2:01:25] that's when you found him
[2:01:27] that's when you received him
[2:01:30] he said see it doesn't mean raising up
[2:01:32] your hands
[2:01:34] that's all right speaking in tongues
[2:01:37] that's all right shouting that's all
[2:01:39] right but that's the attributes of
[2:01:41] Christ after he comes in
[2:01:44] to receive Christ is to receive the
[2:01:47] person Christ Jesus to receive him is
[2:01:50] alive
[2:01:52] outing speaking in tongues all these
[2:01:53] things they're all just demonstrations
[2:01:55] that's the attributes that follows this
[2:01:59] but first is to receive Christ
[2:02:02] the man said then brother Branham
[2:02:04] I've been saved all the time
[2:02:07] remember the brown said sure
[2:02:10] do you love him he said with all my
[2:02:12] heart run around and said well one time
[2:02:14] you didn't love him that's right now you
[2:02:16] love him yes that's true well you had
[2:02:20] him all the time then
[2:02:21] and the man jumped off the porch began
[2:02:24] crying holding brother Branham in his
[2:02:25] arms said oh God
[2:02:27] I've been a Christian all this time
[2:02:32] not the natural
[2:02:35] It's Supernatural
[2:02:38] nothing that a man can work up
[2:02:41] it's what God does
[2:02:44] your new creation
[2:02:46] can you say man
[2:02:48] do you love him
[2:02:50] this body of Believers no church puts
[2:02:53] you in and no church puts you out
[2:02:55] no family put you in
[2:02:58] no family can put you out no prophecy
[2:03:01] can put you in and no prophecy can put
[2:03:03] you out
[2:03:05] remember that little lady on that vision
[2:03:07] of the uh
[2:03:09] of the video red Brown said then they
[2:03:12] calling you a witch
[2:03:14] didn't a preacher even call her that or
[2:03:16] something like that prophesied over her
[2:03:18] and hear all them years she was so
[2:03:21] messed up in her mind
[2:03:23] because that preacher
[2:03:25] and then called her a witch
[2:03:27] where the Prophet said oh no that's not
[2:03:29] it don't you even worry about all that
[2:03:31] that's a lie
[2:03:34] is that all it is your nerves messed up
[2:03:38] thank God for a prophet
[2:03:41] to give us the correct interpretation
[2:03:44] of God's mind
[2:03:46] you love him
[2:03:49] if the musicians will come
[2:04:06] we just sing that little song without
[2:04:08] him I can do nothing

[2:10:13] a lot on my own
[2:10:19] I thought I could
