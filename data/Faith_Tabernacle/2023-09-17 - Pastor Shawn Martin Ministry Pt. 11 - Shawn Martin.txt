amen today and um in the house of the Lord and and just to serve the Lord and with the people of God Amen the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of

and uh had um good meeting there in in Pennsylvania as well as in Oklahoma and um thank the Lord for uh moving Among Us and Trust the people were helped and um edified praise the Lord if um Hosea the 12th chapter and um uh we'll read the 10th verse but it says I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and you similitudes um by the ministry of the prophets amen let's just uh bow our heads and talk to our Lord precious Lord how we have just found a delight to come to your house this morning realizing that we could be anywhere Lord um but it was you it was a Divine calling that would bring us to the house of God this morning and to magnify you to glorify you but Lord also to hear from you father we're asking Lord that you would speak now through these mortal lips father and you know what you would have to say and help me to get myself out of the way Lord and may your people be edified draw us all closer Lord if there's anything in our lives that's not pleasing to you I pray Lord that you would just cut it out of us father and may we be more molded into you and your likeness father for we see that's your purpose that's your goal and father we are the people there's no other people on the Earth uh in in time we see that time is is winding up father father there's no other age there's no other messenger we we at Lord And may we do all that we can Lord uh for your kingdom and Lord and may we surrender more than ever to your word we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ amen and amen you can have your seats this morning I enjoyed the songs and the worship uh today and the um you know the song service is to create an atmosphere sure um for the word to um have an effect the spirit comes upon the word and ministers it to the congregation and so song service is important and it's not just coming up and singing but it's it's there's you know as it's been said there's a difference in a song leader and a worship leader uh to lead the people into worship that's right uh is is uh important and so uh we we find that the word is of utmost importance more than anything it's it's the word of God cuz you you you've got to build your life upon the word nothing nothing else you you you can't build it upon Sensations you can't build it upon a gift you can't build it upon anything your faith must be anchored in the word I want to continue on this subject of of ministry and um uh probably just go over things that we already know uh but it's good to be reminded of of what God has done in this day and why he has done it and uh here in our opening scripture we we the Lord talks about the ministry of prophets the ministry and and we the more I study the message and uh the more I see what God has done it's it's just leaves me um Spellbound that God would choose me uh for this age and to be able to to hear the voice of a prophet and to believe it there are a lot of things that I could say about prophets and uh but I won't be able to cover everything today uh but in the Book of Genesis we we read where God spoke uh using his own mouth and there in Genesis 1 and one through three and and you can read the the whole chapter but in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light there was no Prophet there was nothing there for him to speak he spoke it himself let there be light and there was light and you you look in Hebrews the 11 th chapter the third verse it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word or the voice of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so the word of God that he spoke out of his mouth it was a creation and not a multiplication so God spoke his word and things came into existence by creation and and the word creation is the action or process of bringing something into existence so at one time it wasn't but now it is what caused it the word of God God would speak and and and bring it to pass he did not need something to multiply like Jesus Took the the Loaves and the fish and he created by multiplication he would take what he had and he multiplied it but in the beginning there was no multiplication because he had nothing to work with he just spoke his word and so God created the Earth and like the prophet would say the the the the the the chairs and the the pews that you're setting on is is uh uh the creation of God um this this pulpit and and everything that you see around you it's it's it come by a creation and and so the prophet said his spoken word brought the material into the Earth the word of God Amen the word of God brought the material into the Earth and so he says in another place how little it is to disbelieve God's word amen it's insulting to disbelieve God's word it's little to disbelieve God's word when everything we see was made by his spoken word he just spoke it into existence that's how powerful the word of God is and and when God speaks something it's when and that word is direct amen it's going to happen it's going to produce it does not matter how how strange it looks it does not matter how impossible it doesn't matter if there's no sign positive for it to happen God will create it and he can and he has and so of course a word is a thought expressed it all originated before God would speak his word it all originated in in his mind and so the prophet said if he said he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world well that's the very moment that God perceived the thought and the thought was created by God himself amen so they're creative thoughts amen and every time God makes a thought it's a creation and when he speaks it it becomes a reality so every word of this Bible is God spoken creative thought and every time it's taken into the right ground it'll be made manifest ain't that right so another place he says how great God does in his word how that even before the world was formed God In His Infinite mercy and in his infiny uh uh infancy he said see he foresaw all things he foresaw it before he even spoke it he already forsaw it and the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and now the word becomes part of himself and then a word is a thought expressed so when God saw where his fellow worker with him Satan which was the son of the morning had deceived him in a way now now he he already saw it would happen he it was already done before Satan actually done it but had deceived him in a way see that he had entrusted him with great things and he had perverted what God had created to make evil out of it see God thought the whole thing in his mind and then when he spoke it it become true and become it become part of him and can never fail it's him he is the word so God before the foundation of the world knew that you would be here right it's it's it it was a creative thought in his mind so it already happened then and now it's just now becoming a reality in time but he he said see he knew you by name before the foundation of the world think of it many times we sing the song new name written down in glory tonight see well it was an error it was written down before there ever was a human being on the earth your names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life can you say amen amen there is a name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and it's mine it's mine can you say Amen so he said see the Bible said that Jesus was the Lamb of God slang before the foundation of the world it took 4,000 years for that to materialize but 4,000 years later he was actually slain but when God spoke the word in the beginning he was slain right then because God's word cannot fail so acts 15 and 18 it says known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world so there is nothing new there is nothing out of cater there is there there everything is right on time and he thought it before the foundation of the world ain't that right so God in the creation created the world first by his thought amen then spoke it and the thought became uh the thought expressed became material so again God in the creation created the world by his thought first then spoke it and the thought expressed became material amen see so that that's what made you Sons is his thinking that's what made you what you are is his thinking he he had that in his thoughts ain't that right amen so God created the heavens and the Earth by by the thoughts of his mind and by the word of his mouth amen he created it by the thoughts of his mind and by the word of his mouth amen another place he was God the L God the word that went out of God when he began to brood upon the Earth and brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the word which God said let there be and there went the Loos which is the word amen and the word began to he said see because all this was in the logos see the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age and as the lust began to breathe upon the Earth there come Marine uh marine life and building up the bird life and on up to animal life and finally there comes something in the representation or look like the thing that was brooding it or Brewing it and uh brooding over it God a man in the very image of God ain't that right so so God would create it all by his word it it was brought into existence by his word God would speak it because there was nothing else to to speak it but him amen and so God in the beginning the prophet would tell us that when he thought of you and thought of others like that he thought of himself of being tangible ain't that right amen think of that when he thought of you he thought of himself being tangible amen not separate from you but one with you amen he he he now now we we look at him as as being the lamb and thinking of himself in in Jesus Christ and he was God in Christ ain't that right amen but now he you were part of that thought that he would think of himself being tangible amen not in that day but this day I'm so glad for that amen see and and so he thought of himself being tangible that was his thoughts he expressed his thoughts by word let there be let there be and there was let there be and there was a a't that right so God kept saying let there be amen until the uh a People Israel on the earth said don't speak to us no more amen we we don't want God to speak amen so then God adhered to that he he heard what they were saying and he says okay I ain't going to speak that way I won't speak to you but I will raise up a prophet amen and I will take that man and I will speak amen the very same words of Life the same power the same omnipotent the same Authority amen it'll be the same word but it'll now be spoke through mortal lips ain't that right and so the prophet would tell us and the prophet said there shall come and there will be and it was and it was and it was and it was just like that ain't that right amen God didn't have to say thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord but now a prophet would rise up thus sayith the Lord and it was and thus say the Lord this shall happen and it did ain't that right so God would raise up a Ministry of prophets that would be his agents Amen to speak the word of the Lord to his people amen for as we know the word of the Lord comes to the prophet ain't that right prophets are predestinated to be what they are they they don't eventually come into a gift amen uh uh it it's like the spirit of Prophecy someone can prophesy amen and the prophet said he could they they could prophesy one time and never be used again to prophesy amen that's that's just the way it is amen uh uh there's gifts and there's things that work in the church but a prophet is predestinated to be a prophet he's born with that gift amen even at 2 years old brother Brandon was seeing visions amen and and and he he didn't even know anything about it he said he was packing moonshine from a steel uh for for his daddy you see and but yet the gift was there because they were predestinated to be that amen so then then the coming of a prophet is a sign that God is ready to speak if there's a prophet on the earth is because God is ready to speak now I'm going to tell you amen see that's different than even a gift of Prophecy and all that a prophet is greater than the gift of Prophecy a prophet is greater amen than even a dream or a vision or or whatever amen speaking in tongues is fine but a prophet is greater ain't that right amen see so amen it's it's not the coming of a dream that God is ready to speak to his people it's not the coming of a prophecy that God is ready to speak to his people it's the coming of a prophet amen that is a sign that God is ready to speak Amos 3:7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets ain't that right amen so God will not reveal God will not do anything without uh it it being first through a prophet so when God wanted to speak to the children of Israel what did he do send him a prophet that's right amen now we we understand that dream uh is secondary from a prophet uh just like in Joseph and Mary's uh situation Joseph was troubled about Mary's uh uh what she had said and and these things about the angel of the Lord and her conceiving and and these things and he was troubled by it well there was no prophet in the land so God gave him a dream but notice the dream did not need to be interpreted it did not leave Joseph in a mess when he woke up and said I don't know what this dream is about I need someone to interpret it I I I just don't know brother Brown said the dream was scriptural ain't that right it was scriptural it it didn't need no interpretation the dream took him to the scriptures Behold a virgin shall conceive and when he woke up he had his answer ain't that right and it was a scriptural answer so when when God wanted to forewarn Israel of coming danger a prophet would come on the scene if a man needed to hear from God he would go to the prophet of God if there was one at at at that time see on Earth amen see so there there again there is what the Bible calls the gift of Prophecy amen and but that is different from being a prophet again a prophet is predestinated and for ordained for the hour do you believe that well you you have to believe that if you're a message believer cuz the prophet just said it amen a prophet is predestinated and for ordained for the hour he doesn't come by chance he didn't come out of mistake God ordained it to be sold now a prophecy has to be judged by two or three Witnesses before the church is even to receive it that's what the Paul says and that's what brother Brandon backs it up see that's what he said see uh they it is to be judged by two or three Witnesses them Witnesses must be credible uh uh tried proven to be right amen and and and uh uh to see whether it's true or not that the dream the whatever prophecy or whatever before the church can receive it but nobody everybody say nobody set before a prophet because he was the ABS he was absolutely the word of God he has thus sayith the Lord who has thus sayith the Lord a prophet has thus sayth the Lord amen and see and yet brother Brandon would tell us a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time God would send a prophet with thus SI the Lord and in that within that Ministry of the Prophet is such power that it can create such power it's omnipotent power it's supreme power why he's got thus say the Lord the same power that brought nothing amen the world out of nothing is now being uh spoken through a prophet amen see so God has a way of doing things and has never changed it so a prophet is always everybody say always Amen brother BR said a prophet is always God's way of making his voice known to his people he is God's mouthpiece amen so then if if he's God's mouthpiece a prophet cannot say his own thoughts amen uh uh that's why if he didn't know any an answer to something he wouldn't tell you amen if if he couldn't see it in the word then he wouldn't give it to you he he he'd say I I can't see it in the word see amen so he just and I thank God for a prophet ain't that right see so a prophet cannot say his own thoughts he is a reflector of God's word and can only speak what God reveals so so uh uh even the prophet balam now of course we know what he was but uh uh he sold out for for money and popularity and all these things but yet he was a prophet and and he even said I must take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth is that right amen and even when he did try to curse Israel he couldn't do it every time he opened his mouth he was blessing Israel amen because that was God's people and and and and the prophet he couldn't speak anything but what God had said amen see so uh uh and I like what brother Braham said you know uh balum was a false prophet amen but his his prophecy was true amen his prophecy was true so so uh uh or his teaching was wrong his prophecy was true so so uh uh John 10:35 tells us that they were called Gods this Jesus refers to it they were called Gods unto whom the word of God came ain't that right amen see and the scriptures cannot be broken we find second Timo uh uh 2 Peter 1 and 20 it tells us that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but uh holy men of God prophets spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost ain't that right so now so so this Bible is the mind of God do you believe that why because it was the word of God it was spake and written by prophets amen this is not it uh uh King uh you know the the king uh James you know he translated it and things like that but this is proven to be the the the word of God Amen why how do we know that because we see the scriptures in this Bible being fulfilled uh uh uh left and right ain't that right amen so the Bible is God's thoughts that he had before the world began and and so the reason that God could say what would uh what will be on this printed word amen is is because he saw it uh uh before the world began in his thoughts and he knew just what would be and he spoke it out ain't that right see a prophet is not picking up the mind of a theologian he's not speak picking up the mind of a politician he's picking up the mind of God that them thoughts that were already preconceived before the foundation of the world and so this is the in the thoughts of God made known in written word amen see and so God handed down his knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it out so year by year the prophet said Century by Century we see it all coming to pass just exactly ain't that right so the whole plan of God was already laid out not now in his mind but prophets would pick up that mind and they would put it all right here in the word of God we don't need new translations we don't need other Bibles we don't need whatever else uh the book of the macbes and and all of these things everything you have need of is right here in the word of God Amen because it's the mind of God and so the prophet would tell us nothing has been put uh uh predicted or put in the scripture but what God already spoke it before the foundation of the world Amen so we look at a scripture we're well known John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God ain't that right so the Bible is God before the foundation of the world Amen God back then this is the expression of God this is God this is the intent of God this is the motive of God this is the person of God this everything about God is written right here and it was written by prophets can you say amen that's right amen see so the bi brother brandham said the only reason it's written in here is prophets receiving from God for knowledge of his predestinated plan of the ages so so brother Brown said it's like a lawyer that that he wants to help his client and give all the information that he can to his clients so he'll study books and books and and get it all together uh gather up all this knowledge to help his client out well then brother Brown says see that's the prophets amen they are dedicated to the word of God they are dedicated to the mind of God they are dedicated these are dedicated channels that God could reveal himself and reveal his mind and reveal his intent amen it's it's by the way of prophets ain't that right so so the the the brother Brown said first the prophet goes to God and the word comes down and he wrote it in the Bible and now that was God's foreordained plan the prophet Saul and he wrote it in word so that the people following would be warned of situation and things to come aren't you glad you're warned amen why it's written right here in the word of God it's already been made known amen everything that's why we're not troubled about this world we're not troubled by America and the and Russia we're not troubled by politics we're not at least I'm not amen amen uh we're not troubled at what the prophet said you can put Abraham Lincoln in every County and still ain't going to help amen it just ain't going to do it amen people go to the bo voting booths and and and they're hoping they're they're praying they're rubbing the you know it's almost like rubbing the rabbit's foot and all that but whatever you do it ain't going to help go to go to the pope and let him sprinkle holy water on you I don't care what you do it ain't going to help amen we've already know the book can you sayen it already tells us why because this is not written by theologians this is not written by just great smart men God would take uneducated men and he would hold rise them up into the sphere to where they could catch his mind and then write it down this will happen and it will happen this and we're seeing it happen left and right in this age can you say amen amen so by inspiration that word amen was spoke by God and by inspiration the prophets brought it and by inspiration everybody say by inspiration we must receive it amen it was by inspiration that God spoke it was by inspiration that the prophets brought it to the people and it's by inspiration that we have to receive it we have to receive it ain't that right that's why you must get into through the spirit amen I think this is why the prophet taught us how to come to church and how to create an atmosphere and and and don't come to church tired amen so many people they stay up late on Saturday nights and and and wasting their time on all kinds of nonsense and then they come dragging in amen how you going to get in the spirit like that amen you got to get ready for the church you got to get ready for service you you got to come prepared why because God is wanting to say something and and and you cannot amen receive it it's just your old carnal mind you have to get into the spirit the inspiration to receive it can you say Amen it has to be received by inspiration this is why the carnal mind knows nothing about about it they know nothing about the Bible they know nothing about end time prophecy they know nothing about the restoration of the word they know nothing about the bride's Revival they know nothing about the headship of the word they see the world falling apart they see the marriages falling apart then their marriages may be falling apart amen they see that their homes are being Fallen apart their churches are falling apart amen the uh uh uh people's minds are falling apart and look what they're doing they're producing more literature amen than ever before and they're coming up with these more conferences than ever before but notice what the prophet said it's not a natural thing a natural thing ain't going to fix it your psychology ain't going to fix it your Bible training ain't going to fix it amen all these things ain't going to fix it Fellowship even amen ain't going to fix it if you ain't got the right channel it's not a natural thing and the prophet said or a material thing can you say Amen see but a man in his carnal conditions can never understand it no way at all it's impossible you cannot understand a what a prophet brings by carnal thinking can you say Amen you you just can amen why spiritual things are carnal uh are foolish to the carnal mind spiritual things are foolish to the carnal mind amen the prophet said see the man who sees the Visions or hears the voice of God never understood it now you think of that even a prophet didn't understand a lot of things he said didn't understand understand a lot of things that he saw I don't think that Isaiah could explain how a virgin was going to conceive all he but he was caught in the mind of God and was fully surrendered to God to speak a word that would cost him his [Music] life man didn't write the Bible see God wrote the Bible it's not a man's book it's God's book it is God's thoughts expressed through human lips that's what makes it the Bible a thought expressed is a word and in the beginning was God's thinking he expressed it through the lips of His prophets and confirmed it by his servants ain't that right so it's always at the end of the age that that the church turns uh to the world the prophet says and and sin and leans upon man's interpretation of the word now is that not what's happening today say that again the prophet says it's always at the End of the Age the church turns to the world and sin and leans upon man's interpretation of the word man cannot help this bride amen no matter how educated they are intellectual Minds cannot help this bride that's right he says they always get in such a mess by their the theologians and Priests until it's always a mess up ain't that right and their interpretation of the word is always everybody say always always wrong that's why you cannot bring now now you just have to excuse me I'm passionate about the message all right but you cannot preach a biligram message to this bride and find results that God is looking for you you you cannot that's that you cannot study the TD Jakes and the Benny hens and the and and and all of these commentaries and all that and try to bring the bride to a restoration it ain't going to happen it can't happen he can you say am men that's why we call ourselves message preachers we study the message we don't study the psychology to fix our marriages we don't study what these other guys are saying about how to how to how to redeem families and how to fix our children all that God sent a prophet [Music] amen so don't think for a moment that the devil won't try and hasn't been trying to infiltrate intellectual giants into this message to teach things contrary to what the prophet has taught us mark 13:21 If any man shall say to you Lo here is Christ or Lo he is there believe him not for false Christ and false prophets shall rise and show signs and wers to seduce if it were possible even the elect ain't that right and I I I I I want to maybe just for you young people sake but don't don't don't think that you got to go to every every Revival don't try to live on the highs cuz you'll never grow in the highs I believe in youth meetings I I believe in you know I believe in them things I believe in it but don't if your experience is going that way if that's what you're looking for it's almost like a a man that's hooked on drugs he's got to have it he's got to have it so in in other words to C with his problems and what he don't realize that is his problem am amen he becomes addicted to it so then they can't stand the test of time they can't just focus that's right hello it's true and we're finding that is more we're finding it more and more amen if you live just after Revival after Revival after Revival after Revival you'll become soft and Doty you won't be able to stand it's it's in The Valleys that you're going to grow it's it's in the pressures that you're going to grow it's in them times that you don't feel God that you're going to grow or at least you're that's where God put you to grow it's not always on the mountain tops can you say Amen so so don't be so gullible that we find well there's there's anointing and this is a Revival and this is happening and that's happening and and and you're looking and and and then the grass becomes greener on the other side hello where he says see Lo here is Christ and believe believe him not can you say man now now this bride is in a Revival ain't that right but it's it's not a church it's not a religion it's it's individuals individually amen can you say Amen individuals are are are in the Revival it's they're the Revival because that's the individuals are making up the bride now the bride cannot fall do you believe that the bride cannot fall for she is what predestinated not to fall so this is part of what God had in his mind ain't that right so the Bible is a book of mystery to the world and to the church this Bible is a book of mystery I you know there's so many people that reading this Bible over and over and through and through a year you know once a year and and all that but it don't matter how much you read it now we're not against reading it you must read your Bible you must the Bible is no good without a prophet and without you coming in the inspiration of the spirit of that Prophet The Spirit of the Prophet is God he's the prophet it's just a man ain't that right the prophet ain't God the prophet is uh or or the man ain't God God is the prophet brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is the prophet ain't that right so the Bible is a book of mystery it's it's a book of mystery you'll not be able to understand it and I I you just have to forgive me but we got so much entertainment in this age that that that that no wonder people ain't understanding nothing no wonder even the message ain't helping a lot of folks is because they're they're too busy with life entertainment all that they ain't got time to get in the spirit of God Amen and and and and but but but so the Bible is a book of ministry and yet brother said yet to the believer it's the revelation of God being revealed in the age we are living in the Bible is a mystery to the church natural to the world and and and even the message is see but to the True Believer it's the revelation of God being revealed in the age that we are living in that Jesus said my spirit or my word is spirit and life he also said that the word is a a seed that is s sold ain't that right so brother brand said it's God in word form and can only be interpreted by himself that's right so here and and I hope this making sense to you today but Hebrews 1 and one uh Paul would tell us God who at Sund Dr times and in diverse manner spake in times pass unto the fathers by the prophets brother Brandon reads this and he says it didn't say Mortals of old as they stro across the Earth in Su times and divers manners but it God in suy times and divers manner revealed himself to His prophets God gave a revelation of himself to His prophets his Bible is all God can you say Amen Christ brother BR said if you read this Bible all the way through and don't see Christ in every part of it you've missed it y'all go back and read it again can you say man it isn't it isn't about the personality of a man it's of God the Revelation that came to them is God revealed to them written down in in word form so the human mind now is not capable of interpreting the mind of God it it's not it it's it's totally impossible we we can't interpret one another's mind let alone tried to interpret God's mind how how how can our fin mind interpreted in infinite mind ain't that right amen so now notice now Luke 10 and 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight say say it again thou Hast hid these things from the wise and the approv it and revealed them unto babes and Propet would say such as will learn such as will learn revealed it to people that want to learn Desiring to learn hungering if you hunger to know God God is obligated to F to fill it blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled ain't that right if you're hungering for the right thing you'll be filled all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him see so the Revelation belongs to God and he is Sovereign in his Revelation he hides it from whoever he will and he reveals it to whoever he will but notice when the Revelation is made known it comes to a prophet the Lord come on now ain't that right now notice what a prophet the prophet said The only person everybody say the only only person that has a right to say thus sayth the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet don't forget it that's what a prophet just said that's what our Prophet just said The only person that has a right to say thus sayth the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet you never saw seen anybody judging Isaiah or Jeremiah or those people they were prophets for ordained and born in the world to be prophets they foresaw The Thing by a vision and then said thus sayeth the Lord for the Lord had already spoken it ain't that right so then when a man when a man says thus say the Lord see it's not it's not man speaking it's God speaking ain't that right then if it's thus say the Lord then it cannot fail a ain't that right it it cannot fail so you see what a prophet is doing he's taking the place of God that's right amen hello he's taken the place of God see now uh again if you notice the prophet in one sense of the word in the Old Testament when he said thus say the Lord now watch him he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of God Amen you notice when he placed out before him thus say the Lord he fell right into God and acted as God then he gave his m message which was God speaking through him thus sayith the Lord can you say Amen even the prophet said the prophet and his messenger is is and his message is one you cannot put the prophet apart from his message can't do it pick the message apart you're picking a prophet apart pick a prophet apart you're picking his message apart ain't that right it doesn't take a genius to know that that brother Brandon was just a man it takes a spiritual Revelation to know he was a prophet for this age and that it was more than just a man it was God in that [Applause] man ain't that right so when he when he said thus sayth the Lord he goes right into the phrase of taking the place of God now notice brother Brown said you are taking the place of God to pronounce something and he says see and before I would do that it had to come an answer from God see before he would say thus say the Lord he had had to hear from God first and he had to come down and he visibly showed himself and gave the Revelation it was not brother bram's Revelation as not much as it was in ezekiel's Revelation Moses Revel or anybody else's Revelation it was God's revelation because he would send a prophet and he would speak through that Prophet can you say Amen so people need to having discernment to know the difference between between thus sayth the Lord and impression right impression and and we're getting so many of this going on in this day uh uh uh where everybody's got thus sayith the Lord thus say the Lord thus say the Lord thus say the Lord and and and and uh you know and whatever is fine but but it's coming to a point where the people are dependent upon that on that than they are the message hello and and for for a person when when a again when a man says thus say the Lord it better happen amen but if he says thus say the Lord it ain't going to be vague that's right you can give the time it's going to happen you can give the color it's going to be you can give the day why it's God it's an infinite mind speaking I can say right now I can say some of you not feeling good all right come on I can say you know that's right some of you got going through some real battles but it's going to be okay the Bible already tells you it's going to be okay thank you hello amen see so you don't need someone to tell you thus sayith the Lord you don't need a prophecy you don't need a vision for that just take it by what the word says now we now I'm going to make it plain I know Skeptics that may be watching or whatever thinking I'm leaning some way I'm not I believe in gifts I believe in Prophecy Believe In Dreams believe in all them things but we don't take it to an extreme to where we forget that the word has already laid it there amen amen amen can you say Amen now brother Brad says how careful we must be that we remain remain True to this word and not take from it or add to it for he who would speak where God has not spoken makes him a liar yes so if we're going to represent God then we must represent his infinite mind that's why a Prophet come the Lord I'm satisfied with a prophet I'm satisfied with this message I don't have to guess whether it was of God or [Music] not other people I might have to guess sir and wonder and question but a prophet is taking all the questions [Music] away cuz the prophet didn't make God a liar amen brother Braham says I cannot tell the interpretation of a dream until I see exactly by Vision what the dream was and many of you know that you told me your dream and would not even tell it all and when I saw the dream come back to me I turned around and told you that there was much of it you left out and then tell you uh what you left out of it you know that's right if that's right say Amen congre says amen see the things that you didn't tell me there therefore you see if like Nebuchadnezzar said if you can't tell me what I dreamed then how will I know you got the interpretation of it but all these Impressions we mustn't take them and say thus sayth the Lord amen we mustn't do that we must have a direct voice an answer from God before we can say it's God not an impression not a sensation no matter how much it's pulsating can you say Amen you might say I believe it could be this way but when you speak thus say the lord it's not you watch on the platform have you ever seen it fail thus say the Lord is perfect never has failed as long as it is thus sayth the Lord it cannot fail so far he's protected me because I've waited on him I haven't tried to seek popularity or vain Glory of men I've tried my best to live humble to live the kind of a life that I think a Christian should live I haven't been able to to do that within myself but he has done it until this day see as I say he is the one that's led me aren't you glad a prophet could be led yes sir see so now again God wrote his his the Bible by his own chosen way and that was by the prophets brother Brown said he chose the way his word would come and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained being a part of God's word declaring the revelation of his word to that age at that time never does it come to a theologian never does it come to a philosopher never does it come to an intellectual never does it come to a psychologist never does it come to the pope it comes to a prophet praise the Lord I believe God wrote the Bible by his own chosen method and his chosen method his Chosen and his own chosen prophets say that again God wrote the Bible by his chosen method and his own chosen prophets not the prophets man has chosen but the prophets God had chose we know that God chose him right had his picture taken with him I ain't seen no other man that's had his picture taken with him that God has Ministry whatever but God took his picture with a prophet Amen to tell us that I Vindicated this man his message ain't that right so so the prophet of our day God's chosen man is Malachi 4 notice then its Believers watch for the Fulfillment of what their Prophet said and that's identification that they are God's prophets because first they're inspired next they stay exactly with the word of the hour then that's his credentials ain't that right now what what is the ministry of a prophet to do we we talked about it uh the uh past few times amen and that is to chop out God's people praise the Lord and you say amen amen and I know I'm reading a lot of quotes but but I I guess that's fine with you it's fine with me uh but God said through Hosea I have hued see now watch Israel he's talking to I have hued or other words words I have chopped Cho them out through the prophets that's how God does his people he chopped them out from the rest of the Nations by what his two-edged sword his word he chopped them his Nation from the Nations he chopped his Nation from the Nations by the prophets his Vindicated words so has he chopped his bride from the denominations by his word promised by Malachi 4 not not by anybody else but by Malachi 4 can you say Amen in the last days chopped out his bride hewed her from the rest of the churches hewed out his bride can you say Amen now notice uh uh uh Second Corinthians actually go with me if you want to turn with me to 2 Corinthians 6 and4 um 2 Corinthians uh 6 and 14 yes sir praise the Lord you love the Lord amen 6:14 um be not unequally Yol together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with b or what part has he that believeth with an Infidel see and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them think of that I will dwell in them and walk in them and will I will be their God and they shall be my people they shall be ain't that right wherefore this is the intent that God has and the motive and the passion is that God could be a God to them people and them people would be uh uh uh uh for him is can you say Amen they they will be his people and that I will be their God wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters sayth the Lord Almighty can you say Amen now think of it now then how are we we see the the passion the the the the the desire of God is that God could have people that would be his and he would be their God he would be their father they would be Sons and Daughters unto him come out and how do we come out by by a prophet a Prophet The Prophet's Ministry Cuts us out for such a thing to se of God would bless you and give you the grace that you could hear a prophet believe a prophet that God could be your God Amen Hallelujah hallu God could be your God Revelations 18:4 that's right and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues amen you realize that voice from Heaven Is God speaking you believe that but what's he speaking through now a Vindicated Prophet it's not an Earthly voice it's a Heavenly voice it's more than just a voice of a man that is speaking these things it's God that is speaking come out come out can you say Amen why because there's an omnipotent power in that voice that would create a people when there's not a people create a bride when there's not a bride yes you believe it you cannot be what God wants you to be the way the world teaches it can you say Amen you cannot be God didn't call us I I say it this way God God didn't call us to be parents the way the world trying to teach us to be parents God didn't call us to have our marriages the way the world wants us to have our marriages God God God doesn't want you to be in a churchgoer the way everybody else is being a churchgoer can you say Amen come out of her my people come out of my her my people can you say amen amen that's why we don't need books of psychology Amen to to to figure out our marriages and to figure out our how to handle our children and and how to be children and perfect children and all that amen away with all of that we got a [Applause] profit when a man rises up you can say Amen to that church it's true when a man raises up with a sign the same old school of thought right there's something wrong it isn't coming from God am can you say amen that's why you cannot mix this message up with other material of unconverted men educated men that has just the same old pattern that has been going through the ages it's just true now you cannot mix this message that's why preachers cannot have this you know I think it was brother Brandon um somewhere you you can bring them out of you can bring them out of the world but now you got to get the world out of them bring them out of the Pentecost now you got to get the Pentecostal ideas out of them bring them out of the Baptist now you got to get the Baptist ideas out of them cuz if not they'll take this message and start preaching their Pentecostal ideas and their Baptist ideas their legalism and their everything else out of this message it ain't going to work it's not the same school of thought you have to die out to this thing die out to the world die out to your teachings die out die out to everything else the the thing that this message will do you have to surrender you want a better marriage surrender to this message you want a better Church surrender to the message you want to be a better Christian surrender to this message you want to be a better parent surrender to this message you want to be a better child surrender to this message can you say Amen why the message will drop you out hallelujah amen yes sir the truth when a man raises up with a sign the same old school of thought there's something wrong it isn't coming from God another place he says every true godsent sign has a voice amen and that voice must speak according to the word that's given for that day just exactly if the voice comes the same old voice of the same old he said you see a sign rather and the sign that the man is doing is the the same old school of thought then you can say right then that didn't come from God if it keeps identifying the same old school of thought it never did it never has it would be against God's program it's got to be something new it's got to be something that the people don't understand hello that's right it don't need to be sent if the same old school of thought if it's the same old School of Theology it's got to be something different yet it's got to be identified in the word that it is for that day see the positives of God's word it has to be that there's no slip UPS to it it's got to be the truth got to be Vindicated by God the truth and the man who speaks it has to be Vindicated of God to be a Seer from God or it's wrong amen they don't see it at all don't even believe it another place it must be a sign from God and if it is there's a scriptural voice behind it for the promise of that day not the same old school the the rabbis and things had been going through the schools and everything all along all along the priest and so forth but this is something new and it's scriptural and it's a promise stay with what God promised amen amen if a man gives a sign in a country or any time and that voice that he speaks behind isn't the word of God then want it don't believe it if some old school if a man gets up and says he shows a sign from God and then the man's teaching is the same old theology that you've had all these years God never sent that sign amen look back in the scripture and see if it was search the scripture the guy comes back and says now we all want to join this it's been an old established Affair don't you believe it God always vindicates his signs sign from God always speaks God's voice and if it's the same old school you've had why why why would he give a sign you're already in it that's right amen if if if what they are telling us how to fix everything our marriages our churches our our families our home ourselves our schools if if politics let's just take Pol if politics is the answer you're already in it come on then God wouldn't need to vindicate it brother Amos right you're already there true if denomination is the answer if psychology and all of them things is the answer we've already got it so when God sends something it's it's so mindboggling because it's against the mainstream that's right and people don't want to just surrender you know good and well you know good and well it's hard to break traditions you know good and well it's hard to break ruts it's it's hard to go places that we're uncomfortable with right and and and you know as they say it's it's you can't teaching old dog new tricks and how many times have we been trained in in our childhood to do certain things and then if you come into your marriage or whatever and then you fall right back into that old training oh yeah it's just hard it's it's hard to break some things but see when it comes to the word of God You' got to break iten it's it's got to be broken and it's not necessary that you understand it to where you now you can you can do all the formula of it in class that's not it it's believing it it's believing no wonder Satan is trying to take this absolute away from us yeah no wonder he's trying to take the the the confidence away from us from this message to say that this message is an absolute you get you there's a lot of message folks that'll blast you to kingom come but I'm not ashamed to say this message is an absolute it's an absolute not only for the church it's not just an absolute for me to just sit here and say Amen to it it's such an absolute that I can surrender to it and not worry about being lost ain't that right so he said see if it's the same old school you've had why would he give a sign you're already in it he's trying to get you to turn that corner stop sign slow up see look where you're going you'll dump yourself off at the corner if you don't watch there's a sharp curve and it's always a sign there before you make this curve to keep you from Wrecking up and before this world become totally insane God would send a profet the Lord not with the same old Trend not with the same old school of thought of theology that's thank you Jesus but to let you know things are changing and you cannot you cannot amen go in a Rapture with the same old theology oh my you can't raise your children with the same old theology not in this age amen Luther's age might have been fine first age or whatever might have been fine but you can't do it in this age we're turning the corner and this corent this this corner is sharp there's a famine in the land there's spiritual death in the land you got to have something to sustain you the Lord thank Jes doson fine but it ain't for this bride we turned the corner yes sir look where you're going you'll dump yourself off at the corner if you don't watch there's a sharp curve and it's always a sign there before you make this curve to keep you from Wrecking up a good road Builder gives signs and we are traveling a road to glory and if the son speaks the same old of the same old thing it wasn't from God that's right bless the name of the Lord amen Malachi 4:5 behold I send you Elijah the prophet a sign before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and what's he going to do he going to turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse do you know what the prophet said about Malachi for he will change the thoughts of the people Glory Glory Glory Glory get them out of this Earthly thought frame into a Heavenly can you say Amen get their minds out of that same old school of thought into a new thought another thing that's God is doing can you say Amen we are becoming more Heavenly minded we are becoming more restored than any any other people on the face of this Earth man this this this message is a message of restoration to bring you back to where God thought in the beginning this message has the to restore a marriage and bring it back the way God wants it not the way a psychology wants it the way God wants it he'll make you young people live just the way God wants you to live not the way some other uh uh uh uh uh intellectual mind wants you to live and how he sees you ought to be the way God wants you to be because a Prophet come to restore us back to what God thought thank you Lord God has his thoughts of what a marriage should be God has his thoughts of way a church ought to be God has his own thinking than the way we ought to be be as Christians and Believers can you say Amen he'll change the thoughts of the people that's the ministry of a prophet praise the Lord Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets so this seventh angel we know would have to be a prophet a prophet means the correct divver the one that the word of the Lord came to the Revelation came to him the word Prophet means a divver of the Divine word yes sir ain't that right so notice brother BR said all those Mysteries that the prophet spoke of will be revealed right here in this last hour and when this seventh angel rises in the lay Odyssey and age and begins to sound forth the true trumpet because it'll be uh contrary they won't believe it they sure won't believe it but it'll be an inspired Prophet because there's no way to figure it out amen no way way no way to figure this word out no way to figure God's mind out but by a Vindicated Prophet the Lord men try to figure out the Trinity and go gray-headed and go crazy no one can understand it they still believe Eve ate an apple and all those things because it's tradition that men has held on to just like Jesus found the church but it'll have to be a divin Le Prophet for the word of God to come to him with the true interpretation of the revelation of Jesus Christ see then it's got to be that way ain't that right another place remember the message is Promised how many believes that the message is just didn't come on its own the message was promised thoughts of God in the in the beginning he said I'm going to turn to people I mean just think what was in God's mind I'm going to turn to people I'm going to change their thinking amen I'm going to call them out of of the of of the same school of thought I'm I'm going to change them all that call them out of there and I'm going to be their God they're going to be my people I'll be a father unto them there will be Sons and Daughters of mine is this not what is happening the thoughts of God is being made manifest by us the message is promised and when all these Mysteries has has been all so bundled up by a bunch of Ecclesiastes see it will take a direct Prophet from God to reveal it and that's exactly what he promised to do now remember the word of the Lord comes to the prophet not the Theologian ain't that right so the voice of the Angel the seventh angel is not just the voice of a man but it's the voice of God on Earth because the word of the Lord comes to him now notice in in uh Hebrews 12:24 and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refuse him not that speaketh for they escaped not who Escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not Escape if we turn from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he ha promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven see so the Earth The Voice shakes not only the Earth but the heavens also and the voice of God comes by way of a prophet that you refuse that not the voice that speaketh can you say Amen see nothing nothing now I i' we've said it and I say it again we're seeing a shaking all over why because the voice of God has spoke through a prophet that scripture is fulfilled the lord it's it's here politics are shaking Nations culture civiliz everything's shaking yes it but also things that are shaking is things in your life that's temporary that God doesn't want in your life and it's because of this message that the shaking is going on to think of that if God hadn't sent a prophet and God not had brought you into this message you would still be carrying the same old Trend You' still be just the average Church goer thank you God wanted to be your father amen God wanted you to be his son his daughter and it's been Grace remember the prophet said it's Grace it's Grace that God sends a prophet when God sends a prophet it's Grace to a people it's Grace yes sir I'm so glad as a parent that I'm not teaching my children under the same school of thought aren't you I might have a long ways to go but I'm headed somewhere praise the Lord so nothing in your life could be shaken outside the prophet's message and this message is not bringing on another Reformation but it's actually bringing forth a new creation praise the Lord yes just as God did when he spoke the word in the beginning Hallelujah it wasn't a Reformation it was a creation and what is being done today is a creation what denomination what teaching what literature what psychologist what program has been able to make the people a word bride there's been nothing but a prophet's Ministry am it takes a prophet now brother brandham says many false prophets will rise and we give the illustrations of how that balam and Moses both of them Anointed with the same Spirit one of them said we're all one let's come join put our girls and all together we got pretty girls over here and you boys come over and you take a nice wife that's all right we're all wanting people anyhow the same race God never did forgive them for that might as stay figure out what teaching you're under what prophet you listen to amen true can you say amen I know we got all kinds of prophets in this age claiming to be the Eighth Day and claiming this brother brand laid his hands on me and brother brand did this brother BR that never did the Bible ever promise an eighth day Pro another Prophet amen they listen to that and see the world see the people are watching for some little Outlet some little bypass some little shortcut but there is no shortcuts in the word of God there's one pattern and you must cut yourself and fit that pattern not try to cut the pattern to fit you everybody must do that that's the only way God has of doing it can you say amen amen see so you cannot use again the same techniques that the carnal church is using and and and bring a word bride you you can that you you can't do that ain't that right you want a home that fits with the word surrender to the message amen the Lord if we want a church that fits with the word surrender to the message if you want an experience that fits with the word surrender to the message if you want a ref relationship with God that fits with the word surrender to the message ain't that right yes brother Braham said see the church we tried to send our boys to school to learn psychology and so forth like that to know how to put over a program in the pulpit and to arrange our he said see the message is so enticing that it'll catch the people and catch their attention and many of great psychologists go out as teachers like that and dramatize and put on a whole lot of something and I just wonder see we're always telling of the Beauty and the attraction of the church but we fail to tell them he that will follow me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me I wonder if we haven't made the beauty of the church too pretty for the fell that comes in can you say Amen so the voice the voice is made known to the elect by a Vindicated Prophet praise the Lord God so designed it that he could hide himself from smart and wise he can hide himself in the scriptures the prophet said from the smartest Theologian yeah many many many men study this Bible back and forward back and forward back and forward reading all kinds of literature going to schools to learn this Bible and yet God hides himself from them yes sir amen cuz God can do so brother Bram said he can just hide himself and sit right there in the scripture and you look all day long and never see it look a lifetime and never see it he can just hide himself sitting there now please everywhere let that soak in that God in the word can hide himself so in the word that there isn't a theologian or a school in the world could ever find him and yet he's setting right there amen see why it takes a prophet to bring the re re ation of Jesus Christ God does his own choosing by predestination chose the prophets for every age notice it he fixes the nature of that Prophet to fit that age see he fits his style whatever he does he fits him whether he's educated or Not educated he fits the gifts the manner that he'll preach in the gifts he'll have and the message for that certain age God's predestinated that certain thing to happen and there's not another thing can take its place amen care what it is how many man-made achievements nothing can take its place he predestinated the man you now you think of that no matter how much educated it is no matter how fine the program is and not it'll never take the place of God's chosen way and that's a prophet he predestinated the man maybe an ignorant man he might have predestinated him another kind of a man whatever he is he gives him his class his gift give him his nature his style and whatever it is how he expresses himself and whatever does notice he makes the man of the hour to catch the people of the hour he does it you love him the Lord aren't you glad God sent a prophet am Hallelujah you think of it now as as we get ready close the Jews have been scattered throughout the world for what nearly 2,000 years or so so uh all over the Nations but the thing is that they don't realize that by God's grace we have been able to realize and that is there's promises in this scripture yes that the prophet caught in the mind of God and he began to write it down it begins to talk about the restoration of Israel amen begins to talk yes they rejected him he says there's a Remnant right that I'm going I'm going to come for amen ain't that right yes but in order for him to deal with them they have to be in their Homeland for as the message has taught us that God can only deal with Israel as a nation he deals with us Gentiles as individuals but for Israel they have to be a nation absolutely and brother brandham gives the illustration of how that God wanted to deal with Israel in the Old Testament but here they all were in Egypt so God had to harden Pharaoh's heart to get them out drive them to the Homeland Drive them yes sir to Palestine and he says and liken un that day God hardened Hitler and musolini heart right to drive and to force the Jews into Palestine amen National Force put Israel in their Homeland that's true Israel is sitting there in their Homeland because of God's desire Amen to once again deal with them now you think of that Nation after Nation after nation has tried to come against them has tried to destroy them yes sir they have been the the little guy U Underdog in every war yeah but God has saw them through amen amen sure because there was something in the back part of his mind for them ain't that right and God promised that there would be 144,000 Jews 12,000 out of each tribe from what I hear that they don't even know the tribes that they've come out of that's right they they have no records so from what I've heard you ask a Jew what tribe are you from he'd probably look at you like what in the world are you talking about but God knows he knows amen because he's in the back of his mind and so God God knows and he promised that there would be he'd give this 144,000 of each tribe they would receive the Holy Ghost and John actually talks about it in Revelation 7 and4 but the prop is that it's been a bitter persecution against Israel but this is the time right this is the time that God is calling him back to the atonement yes now we we those of you that have studied the Holocaust and what has what happened 6 million I believe Jews were murdered and the horrific things that happened right to them amen such ungodly things and it would take a prophet to say it was the tender hand of Jehovah it was the tender hand of Jehovah God bringing them back into Homeland we don't understand God's ways but I can tell you it's the tender hand of Jehovah amen you may not even understand the ways that you go through and the trials and the testings but I can tell you this it's the tender hand of Jehovah God bringing you to what he's wanted you to be prise the Lord if there's ever a people that go through trouble and tribulations and testings and hardships it's people who truly believe this message because it's not just saying I believe but now God sends things there to shake the things that he doesn't like about it out of your life molds you and shapes you and to where you're conformed to His Image prise the Lord and so it's been a bitter persecution on natural people but it's all fulfilling God's word god preparing to deal with them the angel Mighty Angel has come time shall be no more denominational ages are over you can't find hardly anybody that just really dedicate anymore to God and sell out and really even get an altar I mean fill an altar up with the Sinners and and all that everybody seems to be a Christian smokers and druggies and prostitutes and all that somehow they seem to be Christian and and all these things and and just to be honest it's because the Gentile days are over we're just gleaning now just here and there but we must not stop gleaning we must not lose our burden for people but regardless you cannot get discouraged it's just that way true and so the Jew is still under the at woman of a natural lamb and it's because he rejected the Lamb of God the real lamb uh which was the atonement and he rejected Christ and when he did that the blood of Christ has been on their hands ever since and so but the reason the Jews rejected him was they were blinded yes sir they they and and the Bible says here God blinded them for our sake Romans 11:11 Paul would say I say then have they stumbled speaking of Israel that they should fall God forbid but rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles amen for to provoke them to jealousy then the 25th verse for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until everybody say until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and so all Israel shall be saved and now we know what all Israel is it's the remnant elect as it is written there shall come out of Zion uh the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob aren't you glad for that amen for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for their the father's sake so the prophet would tell us God had to harden Pharaoh's heart to run them out of Egypt and he hardened Stalin and musolini and all that to get them back into the promised land where the 144,000 is supposed to be and now for the first time for thousands of years 2500 years that Israel is a nation with its own flag own Army and all and it considered in the UN first time it's been the oldest flag that ever flew on Earth at this time see flies again six-point star of David and he said he had lift that ins sign in the last days and when she'd be coming back and we're at the end there's no doubt about it we're here but notice what he said Israel is going to be called to the Feast of the atonement what to recognize the atonement not no more chickens and geese and what they've been doing but the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world Israel is going to know that think of this now they've been blinded for 200 years but God's going to open their eyes and turn them to the true atonement but notice it will take a prophet to do it absolutely ain't that right two to be exact brother BR said be Moses and Elijah ain't that right see so in in Revelations 11 and 3-10 talks about the two prophets that are to come and and and according to the message their ministry will start after the Rapture of the Gentile bride now the Israel's starting to wake up over there right so brother BR said it will be by these two prophets that the Jews are caught out of Judaism to Christ the atonement Israel and Elijah see will will call Israel out of that Jewish Traditions out of the old atonement of the sheep and goat sacrifice to the real living sacrifice to the word another place one of these days some Divine holy anointed prophet of God will go over there with signs and wonders those Jews will say that's what I'm looking for yes sir and God will baptize 144,000 Jews ain't that right but then a gentile bride was to have a prophet amen I speak in past tense because I believe he's already come and which is the prophet of Malachi 4 and his message is the seventh Angel's message in Revelation 71:7 and what is his message the prophet said in the Feast of the trumpets his message is to call the bride out of the Pentecostal tradition the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures the church knows it the world around we firmly know it for he's never told us one thing in thus say the Lord but what's been the truth ain't that right see so it takes a prophet God did not send the church World a prophet God did not send amen a prophet to the foolish virgin God didn't send a prophet to the entire world for the entire world he sent a prophet to the elect of God to take them out pull them out of the Pentecostal traditions and the world traditions and and all of these things it would be by a prophet what power the prophet has to the elect of God Amen what a Ministry amen the world they have their politicians their theologians their psychologists their Educators philosophers and intellectual Giants they have that that's for them they write their books and they you know everybody studies all that trying to make the world better trying to make the home better trying to make the family better trying to make the church better trying to make the politics better trying to bring peace to the world bring peace to the church bring peace to the home bring peace to whatever but you know what God would send a prophet thank God for the elect and everything they're looking forj we have it the answers that they're studying to have the remedy we have it brother brah said God has a certain Prophet ready for that age to call his electing by his Vindicated word of signs and wonders and confirmation of his word confirming the word with signs following as he promised he gives the true interpretation after the prophet himself has been Vindicated all but those the elected to whom he is sent hate him now examine every instant and see if that's right or not only the ones that he is sent to he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as did receive him to them gave he the power to become sons of God all do you love him if you mus positions will come the Lord Jesus brah said he is sending a Vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that is John the Baptist and the Elijah of old he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of this last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works so what the world is looking for the True Believer Has It by listening to a prophet we don't have to come up with gimmicks we we don't have to come up with things to to entertain we don't have to be educated we don't have to be anything all we have to do is just believe it and surrender and say Lord I Surrender it it's a headship this message is a headship it's the headship it's the answer for everything that we have need of amen that's why I've said told both places there in Pennsylvania and Oklahoma when we were in the Pentecostal we were people are so Gable man if a man had a dream yeah that's right we went after it yeah if something Shin diing you know we we went prophecy went we went yeah man had a great ministry we went man said he had D say the Lord or a word from the Lord we [Music] went and we constantly question our own experience does he love me does he not Church goes through Seasons well is God With Us or is he not homes go through Seasons well does he love us or not is she really the right one for me is he really the right one I don't know Lord if you just then someone rise up with something then we get discouraged well he didn't call me out he didn't have a word Over Me Oh Lord what do I do even our own Pastor loving to death there's a woman that supposedly had a gift of Visions dreams and and it didn't matter if she was she was in and out all the time didn't matter if she was backslid cut hair and wearing her britches and whatever she was doing call her up you have a word from the Lord for me you have a dream you have have a vision that's Pentecostal we we were so wrapped up in that stuff it was so emotions and and all of these things that's the truth but God would send a prophet to settle us down down to where we wouldn't so be so gullible we wouldn't be so vulnerable it's not that we don't believe in gifts it's not that we don't believe in things but it was hard to find pillars in in a Pentecostal church it was hard to find real rooted people this is what the message is doing it's it's rooting people it's it's establishing that elect it doesn't matter with the winds remember talking about that Jesus talked about the foolish man that built his house upon the Sands and the the wise man that built his house on the Rocks they both went to the trials they both went through the storms they both went where there was no emotions and Sensations and they were on the highs and they were the lows and they were this and they were that just speaking about us they they went through the testings they you know and all these things but one stood and one didn't one's testimony stood and one didn't than one experience stood and the other's experience didn't because one was founded upon a rock the other was founded on shifting Sands well brothers and sisters God would come in this day to build our life upon a [Music] message that no other denomination no other teaching no none other can give us God would found us upon a rock amen the revelation of Jesus Christ now if you can receive that the same way it's giving it was given by inspiration and we must receive it by inspiration it'll be the thing to hold you it'll be the thing to keep you it'll be thing to tie you down where no matter what comes what goes you're still standing when it's all said and done aren't you glad for that amen what song amen all sing it now oh can't you [Music] see AC accepted the work of the Lord the revealed word that was spoken by a prophet of M all sing it again oh can't you see why I'm [Music] happy I've accepted the work of the Lord the revealed work Spen by [Music] theet as they just play softly I want to make it clear today and this is one of the reason why don't like talking on the Internet is is because when you're talking to your church people listening in or whatever say well you're you're talking about so and so and all that I want you to know right now we're not talking about anybody we're not attacking I God forbid that we attack and and things and so if you anyone here in this in the church here today that would think that or that are May listen just know that we're not not it's just my convictions it's something that I'm just trying to teach my church and I believe it's according to the message and it's not it's not to attack it's not for any reasons you know whether I don't know what side you know I I don't know I know there's just a lot of things that go on out out the doors here and and um so I don't want anyone to take me wrong to think that I'm studying to attack cuz God forbid that we would do that I love the Lord I love the message I love the people of God Amen I love the ministering Brothers I love the people I I've always said you know and and to make this clear again I've always told you and you know it that no one has to come to my church to make it in a bride I don't believe that I I wherever God leads someone then you know if they can't be fail here if they can't be helped here I yeah hey I'll be the first one to say I cried tears many times you know and question you know why I can't help people but more than anything I would rather someone go where they can get helped and to try to keep them here and so I you know so we're not in any any way if Satan ever tries to make you think well he's attacking or he's saying this and he's saying that it's not true you know we're just preaching the message preaching what I believe and um I love you all very much and um anyone that has left her church we love them dearly pray that God just blesses them I pray God blesses the churches around this area that God blesses them gives them uh uh a church full and you know God blesses their Ministry uh all in all we're we just want to go home every day I live I want to go home I think God makes it that way for me just I want to go home and even John at the end of Revelation did he not say that even so Lord Jesus come and I I I think maybe if he's represent of the Bride maybe that's that's where we're all coming to is just even so Lord Jesus just come amen go home amen but until we are at home we want to do all that we know to do stay true to this message lean from the message man don't don't be turned one way or the other don't don't there's nothing to go to just stay with the message stay true and let the message just conform your life to what God wants you to be amen you love the Lord Lord sorry for being long winded um well not sorry but uh but thank you I should say it that way thank you for listening to me and uh putting up with us and u i I just feel an urgency uh and the more I look into the word the more I just love to talk about it so I hope it's been a help to you today um I do say that the family and I are going to go on a camping trip either tonight or in the morning and uh just to get away so um we won't be here Wednesday for sure uh or at least that's the thought and um but we will be here Lord willing uh Sunday so uh so just remember that uh I've asked Daniel to to take the service Wednesday night and um so uh keep us in prayer uh we're really going to try to rough it sleep in tents and all that except we are bringing our mattress so got one luxury of home but uh we actually thought about bringing a coffee pot but I don't know if we' do that but anyway anyway we are going to try to rough it though and U anyway we're really looking forward to a wonderful time so uh God bless you love you and uh we can do anything for you let us know remember brother Bob in our prayer that God will just give him strength Grace as he's going through these tests in that heart calf on Thursday and uh procedure there and so I think that's it anyway let's just bow our heads talk to the Lord Brother Matthew do you want to dismiss us in prayer
