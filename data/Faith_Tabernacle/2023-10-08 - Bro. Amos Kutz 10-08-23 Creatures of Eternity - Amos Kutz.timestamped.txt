[36:40] God this morning and so good to have
[36:43] each and everyone and glad brother
[36:44] Daniel is all right and uh these things
[36:48] happen we're not immune to these
[36:51] things and uh this morning he's feeling
[36:55] sore and so some people feel that way
[36:57] all the
[37:00] time well I'm certainly not I'm not
[37:04] gloring gloring pain or anything like
[37:06] that but I certainly know is the older
[37:09] that we all get our bodies begin to feel
[37:12] wear and tear and I'm not here to preach
[37:15] uh anything that's negative this morning
[37:17] but you know uh many times we need to
[37:20] put ourselves in other people's shoes
[37:22] then once we do that we'll know how to
[37:24] pray for them amen some times God will
[37:27] let a pain strike me that'll remind me
[37:30] that so and so is putting up with that
[37:32] every single day and don't get much
[37:34] relief from it so I certainly I think
[37:38] that's where the body of Christ is
[37:40] sympathetic not that we're looking for
[37:42] sympathies or anything like that but we
[37:45] are understanding of one another and uh
[37:49] that's why the Bible even says about uh
[37:51] bear ye one another's burdens that don't
[37:53] mean well I ain't going to Bear her
[37:55] burden or I ain't going to bear his
[37:56] burden but the Bible said bear you one
[37:58] another's burden so it just makes it
[38:01] easier for that other person to bear
[38:04] that burden amen and uh enter into the
[38:07] fellowship of their sufferings you see
[38:09] that's it's easy to stand back from a
[38:12] distance and say well God bless you
[38:14] brother I hope you get the feeling
[38:15] better and all of that that's that
[38:17] anybody can say that but to enter into
[38:20] the fellowship of your sufferings
[38:22] because Christ is touched with the
[38:24] feelings of our infirmities so we should
[38:27] therefore act the same way if not then
[38:29] we we just need to get more love in our
[38:31] heart amen praise God so this morning I
[38:34] want to go straight to our text this
[38:37] morning before we do that let's ask the
[38:39] Lord to uh bless the word Heavenly
[38:42] Father God as we are opening your word
[38:44] this morning and Lord before us lays a a
[38:48] topic of Lord a a tremendous topic Lord
[38:52] and there's not enough hours in the day
[38:54] father to really speak about all of
[38:57] these things father God this morning but
[38:59] I pray dear Lord that you would enable
[39:01] us and Empower us Lord God and give us
[39:04] Lord uh any disturbance Lord exterior
[39:07] Lord or somebody gets uh this thought or
[39:10] that thought help us Lord God to stay
[39:12] with our thought Lord God Lord God may
[39:14] you open our our mouth to speak the
[39:17] words of Life dear God to bring
[39:19] Deliverance to bring healing to bring
[39:22] joy to bring freedom for the captive
[39:24] Lord father God that's what we want Lord
[39:27] is that lifting up dear God in our soul
[39:30] lord God we know that that's the the
[39:32] problem once that problem is solved it's
[39:35] kind of like the micro many many many
[39:38] many problems the micro but if we can
[39:40] ever get the micro taken care of the big
[39:42] problem it just takes care of all the
[39:45] little micro problems God help us this
[39:48] morning to approach it Lord God and see
[39:50] ourselves in your grace I pray bless
[39:53] this word oh God give us strength in our
[39:54] body we pray and give us a heart to
[39:58] understand and listen to your voice and
[40:00] follow your leading I pray this morning
[40:02] in Jesus Christ's name be with our
[40:04] pastor and his family Lord God as
[40:06] they'll be traveling here in a few days
[40:09] we ask it in Christ's name amen tur in
[40:12] your Bibles with me to the book of
[40:14] Hebrews chapter 9 beginning at Hebrews
[40:16] chapter 9 and starting at verse
[40:24] 8 Hebrews
[40:27] 9 beginning at verse
[40:33] 8-4 and we'll even read Hebrews chapter
[40:36] 10 and
[40:44] 2 praise the Lord you love the Lord this
[40:47] morning
[40:50] amen he says this Paul says this in
[40:53] verse 8 the Holy Ghost is signifying
[40:56] that the way into the holiest of all was
[40:58] not yet made manifest while as the first
[41:01] Tabernacle was yet
[41:03] standing which was a figure for the time
[41:06] then present in which were both offered
[41:09] both gifts and sacrifices that could not
[41:11] make him that did the service perfect as
[41:14] pertaining to the conscience neither by
[41:17] the blood of goats and caves but by his
[41:20] own blood he entered in once into the
[41:23] holy Place having obtained eternal
[41:26] Redemption for us for if the blood of
[41:28] bulls and of goats and in the ices of an
[41:30] hepher sprinkle the unclean sanctify to
[41:33] the purifying of the flesh how much more
[41:37] shall the blood of Christ who through
[41:40] the eternal spirit offered himself
[41:42] without spot to God Purge your
[41:46] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[41:49] Living
[41:50] God Hebrews 10 and2 says
[41:55] this Hebrews 10
[41:57] and2 for then would they not have ceased
[42:00] to be offered because that the
[42:02] worshippers once
[42:04] purged should have had no more
[42:08] conscience of
[42:10] sins I'll read that one more time for
[42:13] then would they not have ceased to be
[42:15] offered because that the worshippers
[42:18] once purged should have had no more
[42:22] conscience of sins I want you to turn
[42:25] over toook Book of
[42:28] Revelation chapter
[42:33] 10 Revelation chapter
[42:35] 10 we all know this scripture this
[42:38] chapter very well probably some of us
[42:41] got it even
[42:42] memorized and that's good we should
[42:44] always be familiar with the
[42:48] scriptures Revelation chapter 10 and I
[42:51] I'll just start at the uh well we'll
[42:54] start at verse one and I saw saw another
[42:56] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[42:58] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[43:01] upon his head his face was as it were
[43:04] the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire
[43:07] and he had in his hand a little book
[43:08] open and he set his right foot upon the
[43:11] sea and his left foot on the earth and
[43:14] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[43:16] Roth and when he had cried seven
[43:18] Thunders utter their voices and when the
[43:20] seven Thunders had uttered their voices
[43:22] I was about to write and I Heard a Voice
[43:24] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[43:28] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[43:30] and write them not and the angel which I
[43:32] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[43:35] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[43:38] swear by him that liveth forever and
[43:40] ever who created heaven and the things
[43:42] that are therein and the earth and the
[43:44] things that are therein are and the Sea
[43:47] and the things which are therein that
[43:50] there should be
[43:51] time
[43:53] no longer
[43:56] in verse 7 but in the days of the voice
[43:59] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[44:01] to sound the mystery of God should be
[44:07] finished as he had
[44:10] declared to his servants the prophets
[44:13] I'll just stop reading right there and
[44:14] I'll remind you how he says over there I
[44:17] believe it's in one of the final
[44:18] chapters of Revelation he says this
[44:21] phrase it is done Glory praise God Amen
[44:27] you can be seated this morning now this
[44:30] morning I'd like to speak to you on a
[44:31] subject of creatures of
[44:34] Eternity creatures of Eternity I want to
[44:37] say on what Sister Lisa I ask her to
[44:40] sing that song this morning what
[44:43] sin God has literally obliterated
[44:48] annihilated your pass inallah that
[44:52] blood we we have complet ly it's been
[44:58] destroyed there's no trace of it for
[45:02] every single Holy Ghost Phil believer
[45:04] here this morning that's received the
[45:08] new birth there is absolutely nothing
[45:11] against
[45:12] you now you in this flesh now we're
[45:16] talking about your soul where you stand
[45:19] with God and we know I think brother
[45:23] Terry and I were talking about this
[45:24] lately and it really released something
[45:27] in my heart after church one time we
[45:29] were talking about it he mentioned how
[45:31] that we receive the literal there's not
[45:35] two forms of righteousness there's not
[45:38] two standards of Holiness there's not
[45:41] two standards of of the word and so
[45:44] forth one for God one for you but we
[45:47] receive the righteousness of God and
[45:51] you're as pure as God is
[45:54] pure I don't don't care if you're living
[45:57] in a Time
[45:59] body now what I want to just back up
[46:03] here a little bit
[46:05] because this struck me when I was up in
[46:09] Baltimore and I was kind of speaking on
[46:11] this
[46:12] thought and Lord just it just struck me
[46:15] in such a powerful
[46:17] way and I realized that there's many
[46:20] things that you've got to do as a
[46:23] Believer first of all you just can't lay
[46:26] around the prophet said if you lay
[46:29] around you're going to become soft and
[46:31] Doty you're going to become rotten and
[46:34] yes you can get spiritually cold that
[46:36] doesn't mean you're lost that don't mean
[46:40] your status is changed in the mind of
[46:42] God your status Remains the Same but you
[46:46] got chastisement coming to you you're
[46:48] going to get your hi burned you're going
[46:51] to get rebuked and there's one thing
[46:54] about it when a Son of God Rec
[46:55] recognizes the rebuke the chasing of the
[46:58] Lord he doesn't bucket like a goat he's
[47:01] a sheep and he accepts the correction
[47:04] cuz he knows it's good for him that's
[47:06] why you can walk out these stor think
[47:09] thank God for a
[47:12] whipping
[47:14] absolutely because it's to bring you and
[47:16] I closer to God and sometimes
[47:20] chastisement doesn't feel good but it's
[47:23] good for us it shows that God l us and
[47:26] we're not bastard born children
[47:29] spiritually
[47:31] Hallelujah I'm thankful for that now the
[47:37] worshipper once purged has no more
[47:39] consciousness of
[47:41] sins all
[47:44] right now let's
[47:47] really look at that thought really
[47:50] close brother random talks
[47:53] about I'm trying to recall the name of
[47:56] the sermon I can't recall if somebody
[47:57] knows it you can speak it out but
[48:00] brother randam talks about a woman who
[48:02] was a Sunday school
[48:04] teacher she was a supposed to be either
[48:06] Methodist or something like that and she
[48:09] had a pastor who didn't really care for
[48:11] her soul he didn't preach the gospel he
[48:14] didn't preach repentance he didn't
[48:17] preach a holy
[48:18] life so this woman went along in life
[48:21] and think she was doing pretty good she
[48:24] was doing a god of service by teach in
[48:26] Sunday school and we find out that her
[48:28] life begin to wither
[48:30] away and she went on and on and got
[48:33] involved in adultery she left her first
[48:35] husband went went with some other man
[48:37] the first thing you know she's out here
[48:39] living like a
[48:42] and so she's going on and on
[48:44] thinking she's all right and brother
[48:46] Rand said her soul her conscience went
[48:49] away from
[48:50] her but then when she begin to die of a
[48:53] venial disease that she'd left go tooo
[48:56] long I don't know what the you know what
[48:58] the situation was but she apparently
[49:01] ignored it and it got to the point where
[49:04] it was lifethreatening and they couldn't
[49:06] do anything for
[49:09] her and and we find out
[49:12] that she brother bam said that when she
[49:16] begin to the blood begin to stop flowing
[49:19] her heart started slowing down he said
[49:23] her soul caught up with her
[49:27] and her conscience of sin returned and
[49:31] she went out of this world with a
[49:33] conscience of sin because she was not
[49:37] under the blood she didn't even believe
[49:39] on the
[49:40] blood she wasn't even
[49:43] saved that's the conscience and no doubt
[49:47] everything she'd ever
[49:49] did her sins of unbelief all came before
[49:53] her at that time and she cried I I'm
[49:57] lost she pointed her finger at that
[50:00] Pastor said you deceive
[50:04] her he failed to point her to the
[50:08] blood that could take it away could took
[50:12] away that conscience of sin she could
[50:16] have walked in newness of
[50:18] life but her
[50:20] conscience
[50:22] returned and so at the day of judgment
[50:25] Sinners
[50:27] ungodly Christ
[50:30] rejectors they'll stand
[50:32] there with their
[50:34] consciousness of
[50:36] sins with no covering in the presence of
[50:42] a holy
[50:44] God if not for the grace of God there
[50:46] would you and I be
[50:48] also but because of God's plan and
[50:52] Redemption no person needs to even go to
[50:55] that place place no person needs to die
[50:58] with a conscience of sin and go into
[51:01] that other dimension nobody because
[51:04] their blood atonement is across the
[51:09] board sure it
[51:12] is even people out there who's not elect
[51:16] or predestinated can be saved for God so
[51:20] loved the
[51:21] world whosoever believeth in him shall
[51:25] not
[51:26] perish but have everlasting life when we
[51:28] know that there's names on that book
[51:31] that'll stay on the
[51:33] book we I know we don't mention that
[51:36] very
[51:37] often but I'm
[51:39] glad there's going to be millions of
[51:42] people whose names will remain on the
[51:45] book but some like Judas the
[51:48] rejectors will have their name taken off
[51:52] the page of the book of life but now the
[51:55] Lamb's Book your life if your name was
[51:58] in that book it'll never come off of
[52:03] there but there's grace and mercy for
[52:07] all and I don't know the mind of God
[52:11] but God forew all things
[52:16] amen but there's some
[52:19] people that was way back
[52:23] there with him
[52:25] in eternity Before Time
[52:28] began and a church age book says that we
[52:31] are one of those Eternal thoughts of God
[52:35] and if you're an eternal thought of God
[52:37] now I can't explain God even the
[52:40] children young folks here I'm my mind my
[52:44] finite mind can't comprehend God in
[52:48] eternity without an end it's a circle
[52:51] brother R said without Corners it just
[52:53] goes on and on and on and on and on own
[52:56] Brother Sam God bless you I thought you
[52:57] were going to be in
[52:59] Colorado but you're here anyway God
[53:02] bless you I appreciate
[53:03] you but it goes on and on and
[53:06] on now
[53:08] notice we're talking about that
[53:11] conscience the
[53:13] woman her conscience come back to her
[53:15] much like people do today they're
[53:17] they're they're dying every
[53:19] minute there's some people how sad it is
[53:23] but God knew
[53:25] from the very
[53:27] beginning who would and who wouldn't
[53:30] some people he could actually put their
[53:32] name on The Book of Life and he knew
[53:34] they would reject it and he'd have to
[53:35] take their name off the book but he also
[53:37] knows that there's people who's got
[53:39] their he put their name on The Book of
[53:42] Life but their name won't come off he
[53:45] knows that he absolutely knows
[53:51] it now I'm not going to spend all my
[53:54] time speaking on that this
[53:56] morning but there's one thing about the
[54:02] stimulation I'm so thankful for the
[54:06] gospel there is only one
[54:09] gospel now people out there have a
[54:13] portion portion portion portion portion
[54:16] Portion by their own ignorance and even
[54:19] by
[54:21] rejection they got a bunch of loose ends
[54:23] that they can't tie it together
[54:27] now I've read read many of these
[54:30] scriptures when I was back there without
[54:35] understanding I I I believed him but I
[54:39] didn't even know what eternal life
[54:41] was I just thought it was well you got
[54:45] eternal life you just God gives it to
[54:47] you and there you go you're God eternal
[54:49] life but that's really not the
[54:53] case I eternally existed by the by the
[54:57] bringing forth and opening of the word I
[54:59] eternally existed in the thoughts of
[55:02] God he say how do you know that God
[55:06] asked me to believe it and something in
[55:07] my heart says I believe
[55:09] it and that's the way it is with
[55:12] you I can't preach you in it I can't
[55:15] preach a revelation into you that
[55:17] Revelation comes down says that's me I
[55:20] can register with that and I believe it
[55:23] and then you see the fruit
[55:26] the fruit of that belief begin to
[55:28] manifest in your
[55:33] life
[55:35] now that all
[55:37] past is done
[55:40] away he
[55:43] says I will be merciful to their
[55:46] unrighteousness their sins and
[55:48] iniquities Hebrews 8:2 I will remember
[55:52] no
[55:54] more he doesn't put him up on a shelf or
[55:58] back in a little stories room just in
[56:01] case I need to pull it back down just in
[56:06] case I got a I got Angels W watch him
[56:10] really
[56:11] close God isn't like that I don't care
[56:15] if God sent us examples like Jacob who
[56:18] was a sh before you could say before he
[56:21] was really shall we say converted
[56:26] you know not having the Holy Ghost but
[56:28] coming to a
[56:30] recognization when he wrestled With God
[56:32] all night
[56:34] long then he had an
[56:36] experience then the old Jacob died sure
[56:40] was not a holy ghost
[56:43] filling but his life changed at that
[56:47] point
[56:51] now when that
[56:53] happened
[56:55] Jacob's a changed
[56:57] person and from that point on and he had
[57:01] a
[57:02] limp so God put a seal a
[57:06] stamp on him and it's forever he walked
[57:10] around and he had a mark on him so are
[57:13] you you're
[57:16] marked by the Lord he he's got his seal
[57:20] his seal of divine
[57:22] approval on your life this is my son
[57:26] this is my daughter and I'm not ashamed
[57:29] of
[57:29] them he doesn't save you to lose you one
[57:32] day you were always saved
[57:34] really Prophet says you just recognized
[57:38] it amen and you got to have that
[57:42] recognized
[57:44] today
[57:50] okay let me read some of these things I
[57:54] have up here
[57:55] brother R says about your conversion in
[57:58] conflict between
[57:59] God and
[58:03] Satan he says I can't explain to
[58:07] you how that the greatest miracle I can
[58:11] think of and I'm just breaking his
[58:13] thoughts here what he's H he's saying it
[58:17] the greatest miracle I can think of is a
[58:19] man just like a pig tell that pig you're
[58:21] no more a pig you're a lamb he becomes a
[58:24] lamb am that' be hard to believe why is
[58:27] it the same thing takes place when you
[58:30] become converted to a sinner to a
[58:32] Christian see it changes your opinions
[58:35] it changes your own will it changes
[58:38] everything that's in you it brings you
[58:40] into another
[58:42] life so in other words your old book is
[58:46] done away with but it's bringing you to
[58:48] another another
[58:50] life you were in a fake life you were in
[58:53] a death walk you were in a you thought
[58:55] you were alive yes you were alive and
[58:58] you were in a Twilight Zone so to speak
[59:01] but you weren't in the opening of the
[59:04] word you were not into full light in the
[59:07] evening time it shall be light you
[59:09] hadn't yet come to your evening time
[59:11] experience you hadn't yet come to your
[59:13] evening light experience
[59:17] amen he said it changes everything
[59:19] that's in you it brings you into another
[59:21] life it gives you another spirit that
[59:23] bears for forth another record Oh
[59:27] Glory woo this is in conflict between
[59:31] God and Satan he says I'll read that
[59:33] again this is good I didn't actually see
[59:35] that
[59:36] before but he said that' be hard to
[59:39] believe wait a minute see it changes
[59:41] your own opinions it changes your own
[59:43] will it changes everything that's in you
[59:45] and it brings you into another life amen
[59:50] so in other words you're not a
[59:52] stalemated you know the evil spirit C C
[59:54] out and you remain garnished but you're
[59:57] filled with God he says and another

[1:01:02] the Lord there is the soul that's what
[1:01:05] we're speaking
[1:01:06] of Amen rising of the

[1:01:21] to bring it to life no more than today
[1:01:24] when sons of God is upon the Earth it
[1:01:26] take the s o n light to bring them to
[1:01:30] eternal life his chosen ones that he
[1:01:32] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:01:34] he had chosen them in himself before the
[1:01:38] foundation of the world and on Easter
[1:01:39] morning then in this dirt somewhere laid
[1:01:42] our bodies at that time for we are the
[1:01:44] dust of the earth and In Heaven There
[1:01:47] was a book of memory oh Hallelujah and
[1:01:51] his attributes was in him knowing that
[1:01:53] because the son of God raised it would
[1:01:56] also raise to life every son that was
[1:01:58] for ordained to this great time he knew
[1:02:02] it would be and what a more glorious
[1:02:05] Sunrise than that was than it was at the
[1:02:10] beginning
[1:02:12] Hallelujah and again in another quote
[1:02:15] here in his
[1:02:18] presence that's the name of the sermon
[1:02:20] in his presence if we are confess that
[1:02:23] he is we've been in his presence and we
[1:02:26] have confessed your sins they are
[1:02:27] blotted out the book of his memory
[1:02:30] there's nobody but God could do that now
[1:02:33] you could do anything to me and I'll
[1:02:34] forgive you but I'll remember it if I do
[1:02:36] anything to you you'd forgive me but
[1:02:38] you'll remember it but God can forgive
[1:02:41] and forget it think of that don't even
[1:02:44] remember it that makes me feel good
[1:02:46] Hallelujah when it's not even remembered
[1:02:48] anymore nothing can do it but God
[1:02:52] nothing but God can do that he's said he
[1:02:54] would blot out of his book of
[1:02:56] memory I can't do it you can't do it
[1:02:59] because we've only got these little
[1:03:01] finite senses remember
[1:03:03] that you can't do it I can't do it
[1:03:06] because we've got these finite senses
[1:03:08] but he's an infinite God he can
[1:03:11] absolutely forget that it was ever done
[1:03:14] and he says
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:18] amen and show us the father brother Ram

[1:20:15] loosed brother randam says in this
[1:20:17] story we told us the last time when we
[1:20:21] spoke that
[1:20:23] that you know he was having this Holy
[1:20:26] Ghost meeting goes down the street it's
[1:20:29] a Sunday morning or something little
[1:20:31] Christian place is closed so he has to
[1:20:33] go to a bar you know the conditions
[1:20:36] going on in the bar what was going
[1:20:38] on and he
[1:20:40] starts he's a Son of
[1:20:43] God he starts to see the filth and the
[1:20:46] iniquity of sin around him he's seen
[1:20:50] people waiting for hours to get into a
[1:20:52] meal eating and here's a couple of men
[1:20:56] at a table with a woman that ain't
[1:20:58] dressed right and they're all
[1:21:00] drunk and carrying
[1:21:03] on there's one interest in mine and
[1:21:05] that's that
[1:21:08] woman Lord you know he's starting to
[1:21:11] think you know what happened he said I
[1:21:13] think I have to raise my family up and
[1:21:14] something like this why don't you just
[1:21:16] the Lord pulled him
[1:21:18] aside said I'm the God that was down
[1:21:20] there Healing The Sick delivering the
[1:21:24] oppressed having Sinners come to me
[1:21:27] people being filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:21:29] and now you're standing here condemning
[1:21:32] this
[1:21:34] woman boy God knows how to get our
[1:21:36] attention brother Ram says he like
[1:21:39] entered into I know was like a
[1:21:41] vision the Lord pulled him behind the
[1:21:44] door and he said he like the blood was
[1:21:47] around the earth we know the story and
[1:21:50] every time she sinned
[1:21:53] no every time William brandham sinned
[1:21:57] his sins went up and would have went
[1:22:00] right into the presence of God and the
[1:22:02] righteousness and Holiness and the fire
[1:22:04] of God would have consumed him but the
[1:22:06] blood of Jesus
[1:22:08] Christ and he said he's seeing the Lord
[1:22:10] and every time he would sin if feel a
[1:22:14] Lord oh
[1:22:18] oh but his
[1:22:20] love and he said did my sins do that to
[1:22:23] you lord said the Lord Jesus
[1:22:27] nodded and he said he had in his hand a
[1:22:31] little
[1:22:33] book but it wasn't the book of
[1:22:36] life it was a book of life it was the
[1:22:39] book of William brandham like you and I
[1:22:42] have had but what did we say about that
[1:22:45] old book just hang on now that book's
[1:22:49] open let me tell you something every
[1:22:51] single person has an open book is called
[1:22:55] their life the record the Bible says
[1:22:59] that the great white Throne judgment Not
[1:23:01] only was a book of life open the Lamb's
[1:23:04] Book but there was the
[1:23:06] books the books the temporary
[1:23:10] books temporary books
[1:23:16] yeah every single person that walked the
[1:23:21] face of the Earth starting back at Cain
[1:23:25] that did not repent will have an open
[1:23:27] book and the books were opened there was
[1:23:31] nowh someone were not even found in the
[1:23:33] book of life but don't be
[1:23:38] judged oh God think of that think of
[1:23:42] that the terror the
[1:23:44] horror not so much the fear of that one
[1:23:47] but the fear of your filthy life your
[1:23:50] filthy Soul coming to the presence of a
[1:23:53] holy God that's why people sometimes
[1:23:55] won't come through these doors they
[1:23:57] sense the presence of God they get so
[1:24:01] uncomfortable well I pray for them I
[1:24:04] pray that they'll feel uncomfortable
[1:24:06] enough to do something about
[1:24:07] it get under
[1:24:11] conviction but he said he had an open
[1:24:14] book and his name was wrote on
[1:24:19] it oh he started calling out to the
[1:24:23] Lord and he said he nodded his head to
[1:24:25] me said God forgive me I wouldn't want
[1:24:27] to hurt you like that Lord I love you
[1:24:30] with all my heart he took his side
[1:24:32] patted with his hand took his finger
[1:24:34] like
[1:24:36] this and rote on my old dirty
[1:24:41] book you think you had such a maybe a
[1:24:45] cleaner book than somebody else let me
[1:24:47] just let me just give you a rude
[1:24:50] awakening this morning we were all born
[1:24:52] in sin and shaper in iniquities all have
[1:24:54] sin and come short of the glory of
[1:24:58] God he wrote on my old dirty book in his
[1:25:01] own blood
[1:25:04] pardoned hlu what did he do with it he
[1:25:09] chucked
[1:25:11] it once he wrote pardon over it it
[1:25:15] didn't matter where that thing landed
[1:25:17] didn't matter what happened to it
[1:25:21] pardoned
[1:25:23] he pardoned and he completely
[1:25:26] annihilated the record of
[1:25:27] it he didn't put it somewhere where he
[1:25:30] could find it you don't have to a
[1:25:32] foolish virgin she still got something
[1:25:34] to deal
[1:25:35] with but the bride has nothing it's
[1:25:38] already taken care of
[1:25:45] for and he
[1:25:49] says
[1:25:51] then
[1:25:53] he to throwed it over behind him like
[1:25:54] this and into that sea of
[1:25:57] forgetfulness and laid
[1:26:00] out a new
[1:26:02] book oh that's where we're just getting
[1:26:05] started
[1:26:07] now he laid out a new
[1:26:11] book and when the lamb had opened the
[1:26:13] book they sung a new
[1:26:17] song you're new creatures in Christ
[1:26:20] Jesus singing a new song and
[1:26:23] especially now you're really singing a
[1:26:26] new song you
[1:26:28] notice the song that these people when
[1:26:31] the lamb had opened whatever song they
[1:26:34] maybe had been
[1:26:36] singing now when the lamb opened the
[1:26:39] book they're singing a new song when
[1:26:42] John wrote this and painn it in there
[1:26:44] and God was sure to make it it was a new
[1:26:50] book the new book of Acts of the Holy
[1:26:55] Ghost and brother will the Lord sister
[1:27:00] Melissa a new book of thoughts and plans
[1:27:06] that God had before the world ever
[1:27:10] began that he could look way down
[1:27:14] Through the Ages and the Winds of time
[1:27:17] the change of the seasons when your mom
[1:27:19] and daddy grandma grandpa great great
[1:27:21] great great great great great great and
[1:27:23] he seen you coming down and he started
[1:27:26] ordaining this one and that one no doubt
[1:27:29] some strange things happened they didn't
[1:27:30] know why but it was God protecting you
[1:27:34] and your parents could have suffered
[1:27:35] from the Bubonic plague that wiped out
[1:27:38] entire fam that there's no living seed
[1:27:41] of that family anymore but God protected
[1:27:44] those certain ones down to the wars and
[1:27:47] so forth as that God was protecting the
[1:27:50] seed you look at what's happening in
[1:27:53] Israel right now what is it it's a devil
[1:27:55] trying to destroy that
[1:27:57] seed the devil is trying to thr the plan
[1:28:00] of God by attacking and killing them
[1:28:03] people taking captives it made me also
[1:28:06] think how
[1:28:08] David I don't remember the full story I
[1:28:10] don't remember the name of it but David
[1:28:12] came back and he found out they done
[1:28:14] carried off their wives and
[1:28:17] [Music]
[1:28:18] children Devil's in for a root Awakening
[1:28:21] on this one
[1:28:25] yes
[1:28:26] sir yes sir it's a wakeup call he might
[1:28:29] have caught just like the rest of us
[1:28:31] sometimes the devil will catch us off
[1:28:33] guard but we've got to we've got to
[1:28:35] catch up we've got to catch up and
[1:28:37] there's one thing about it the devil's
[1:28:39] not going to win anything on
[1:28:41] it he might have pulled a fast one but
[1:28:45] God knew already knew it was going to
[1:28:47] happen is prepared for it and has
[1:28:49] prepared his children for it you don't
[1:28:52] realize what really lays within you you
[1:28:55] have the ability to recoup
[1:28:58] regroup re-energized
[1:29:00] restricted that's
[1:29:03] right David what did he
[1:29:05] do I heard remember he encouraged
[1:29:09] himself with the
[1:29:13] Lord
[1:29:15] amen a new
[1:29:17] book they sung a new
[1:29:20] song brother br says and God keeps his
[1:29:24] word
[1:29:26] Phoenix and listen to what he says here
[1:29:29] that around this altar Lord healing in a
[1:29:31] greater measure in a more higher measure
[1:29:35] in the highest plane what is he
[1:29:38] plane a plane is like a higher level on
[1:29:43] the ladder it's going up in the
[1:29:45] mountains and you reach a a new level a
[1:29:49] higher level from Roll Oak to Christian
[1:29:52] B Christianburg is like a higher level
[1:29:56] he says then around this altar Lord
[1:29:58] healing in a greater measure in a more
[1:30:00] higher measure in the highest plane that
[1:30:03] there is an eternal healing eternal
[1:30:05] spirit making Eternal
[1:30:09] creatures out of creatures of Time how
[1:30:13] wonderful these men and women raise
[1:30:15] their hands they were grateful that you
[1:30:17] did offer them eternal life but they've
[1:30:19] come here to make a public confession
[1:30:22] that they believe you and are repenting
[1:30:24] of their sins let me just stop and say
[1:30:26] something right
[1:30:27] here those of you who know this
[1:30:31] message this was
[1:30:33] 1957 and in 19 I think it was either
[1:30:36] 1953 or the early 50s brother R preached
[1:30:39] on the deity of Jesus
[1:30:41] Christ now I I have not I've not done a
[1:30:45] thorough or a
[1:30:47] complete uh
[1:30:50] research on a different Ministries that
[1:30:52] existed back then but I'm going to tell
[1:30:55] you what I just read to you was not
[1:30:57] being preached by too many people if
[1:30:59] anybody at all that was a higher level
[1:31:02] of preaching that was a different kind
[1:31:05] of preaching when he preached the deity
[1:31:06] of Jesus Christ and he said de lives in
[1:31:09] you now brother R probably didn't even
[1:31:12] realize some of those things he was
[1:31:14] talking about because later on he as he
[1:31:16] matures in his ministry matures in the
[1:31:18] opening of the word he makes it more
[1:31:20] clear but God was speaking out of him
[1:31:24] amen you're Eternal creatures out of
[1:31:28] creatures of Time how
[1:31:31] wonderful I've got to got to move on
[1:31:34] with this he says in the uniting time
[1:31:35] and sign the thing I've been teaching
[1:31:38] you is telling you these signs different
[1:31:40] things are happening I haven't got time
[1:31:42] to do it now I will in another message
[1:31:44] Lord willing but there's one little
[1:31:46] thing yet lacking in the church we want
[1:31:48] to get to that and I'm right on the edge
[1:31:50] of it now we want to get to that you got
[1:31:53] to do it if you don't do it that's just
[1:31:55] all you must do it for looky the uniting
[1:31:57] time is at hand God is getting the
[1:32:00] church together to be a Rapture to go to
[1:32:02] the wedding for the great Union when God
[1:32:05] and man will unite for
[1:32:06] eternity when creatures of time Unite
[1:32:10] with the
[1:32:14] Eternal
[1:32:16] okay I am looking for another quote up
[1:32:20] here okay
[1:32:23] serpent
[1:32:24] seed brother Ram
[1:32:26] says I want to ask you who is this job
[1:32:29] 27 where was you when I laid the
[1:32:32] foundation of the Earth when the morning
[1:32:33] Stars sang together the sons of God

[1:32:39] those sons of God that was shouting for
[1:32:40] Joy Jesus told them I had Joy with you
[1:32:43] before the foundation of the world we're
[1:32:46] not creatures of time we're creatures of
[1:32:49] Eternity 19

[1:32:55] preaching back then mean there was some
[1:32:57] good God called Ministry back then but
[1:33:00] they weren't getting into that cuz only
[1:33:02] the prophet God Reveals His secrets to a
[1:33:05] prophet to break these things
[1:33:09] loose
[1:33:10] amen my creatures of Eternity yes
[1:33:18] sir thank you Jesus brother R says and
[1:33:21] lifting him out of history as long as we
[1:33:24] live in the Glorious setting of mortal
[1:33:26] son mortal son he says remember the
[1:33:29] Mortal son and the breaking of the
[1:33:31] eternal life I do feel that we're living
[1:33:33] in some of the grandest ages that every
[1:33:36] man has been permitted to live in
[1:33:37] because it's the closing out of
[1:33:39] time the closing out of time it's time
[1:33:42] for those memories to
[1:33:44] stop don't dig him up again don't dig up
[1:33:48] that old
[1:33:49] husband leave it be yes yes
[1:33:53] sir see ending a
[1:33:59] time in this SES that every man has been
[1:34:02] permitted to live in because it's a
[1:34:03] closing out of time blending in of
[1:34:06] Eternity and how can I
[1:34:08] overcome he says this this Le to see in
[1:34:11] church age is the grandest of all ages
[1:34:13] because it's the ending of time the
[1:34:15] blending of
[1:34:17] Eternity it's the greatest sinful age
[1:34:19] yeah we know that
[1:34:22] there's more there's more sin in this
[1:34:25] age than it's ever been in the powers of
[1:34:27] Satan is many times harder to fight
[1:34:29] against that it was in any age but God
[1:34:32] has a
[1:34:34] determination and his power his light
[1:34:37] cannot be
[1:34:38] darkened his life will not be stuffed
[1:34:42] out he has a bride in the midst of this
[1:34:45] filthy wretched godforsaken
[1:34:48] age who's been indicted
[1:34:52] denomination's been indicted
[1:34:55] amen it's a blending of Eternity when
[1:34:58] God has chosen this very
[1:35:01] age I believe it's in Ephesians chapter
[1:35:03] 1 it talks about the fullness of God the
[1:35:07] fullness of times excuse me we'll go to
[1:35:10] that right
[1:35:13] quick
[1:35:15] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 10 that in
[1:35:18] the dispensation the fullness of times
[1:35:20] he might got GA together in one all
[1:35:23] things in Christ both which are in
[1:35:25] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:35:27] him when is that happening if happening
[1:35:30] right now it is absolutely happening
[1:35:33] right now time shall be no

[1:35:58] at right but the real you is standing up
[1:36:03] inside you the real you is a butterfly
[1:36:06] that's forming on the inside that soul
[1:36:08] is maturing in the word of
[1:36:10] God now the fullness of time has come
[1:36:14] and what does he
[1:36:16] say that he might gather together in one
[1:36:19] all things in Christ for which are in
[1:36:21] heaven and which are on the earth even
[1:36:24] in him he's absolutely accomplishing his
[1:36:28] will right now and every single elect
[1:36:33] Pride member will go out of this world
[1:36:35] not defeated but absolutely Victorious
[1:36:38] over every personal demon people talk
[1:36:41] about their demons we've had them and we
[1:36:43] still fight them but they're going to be
[1:36:46] they'll be the devil will find that
[1:36:49] demon will say I don't know what to do
[1:36:51] anymore Satan Commander I don't know
[1:36:54] what to do with
[1:36:56] him but then had to bring some sort of
[1:36:58] governmental Force against them Bible B

[1:40:55] God you were in God's TR before the
[1:40:58] world began the Lord that's the holy
[1:41:01] convocation now you're made manifest now
[1:41:04] you've come to the manifesting time now
[1:41:07] you've come to the Day of Reckoning the
[1:41:09] day of
[1:41:10] recognization of who you really are who
[1:41:13] we really
[1:41:15] are let come what me let come what me on
[1:41:21] this rock I'll build my church and the
[1:41:24] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[1:41:28] it you can't Prevail against God we're
[1:41:31] not operating just under an anointing
[1:41:33] we're operating under the literal life
[1:41:36] of
[1:41:37] God you can no more be defeated that God
[1:41:40] could be
[1:41:42] defeated and don't let your slip
[1:41:45] UPS you have an advocate don't let those
[1:41:49] little slip UPS fault you don't let them
[1:41:51] be like little ticks that suck your
[1:41:53] blood out of you mosquitoes and so forth
[1:41:55] trying to give you lime disease don't
[1:41:57] let those things give you that youve you
[1:42:00] been inoculated by the blood if you
[1:42:03] either shut the door or open it my womb
[1:42:07] is only open to the word of God it's
[1:42:09] closed to everything else knowing our
[1:42:11] spirits of veneral as the prophet
[1:42:14] said back then brother Terry people
[1:42:17] didn't preach those kinds of things that
[1:42:18] won't even mention from the pulpit
[1:42:25] brother R preached The Book of Proverbs
[1:42:27] he preached The Book of Solomon in
[1:42:29] figurative and a type and I know he did
[1:42:31] preach on the S Song of Solomon and so
[1:42:33] forth but he brought it out in such a
[1:42:35] way that people
[1:42:38] just even even I believe that even
[1:42:42] theologians what did he
[1:42:46] say those things weren't even mentioned
[1:42:49] from the pope and yet they're in the
[1:42:50] scripture
[1:42:51] why was it he had a holy he was in a
[1:42:53] holy convocation and he could break that
[1:42:56] word without being an offense to
[1:42:59] people Lord even though it shocked
[1:43:01] people spiritual to neural oh my
[1:43:06] goodness I expect you to get quiet on
[1:43:08] that one I
[1:43:11] guess the opening of the word amen you
[1:43:14] see a prophet tells it like it
[1:43:17] is said California is going into the sea
[1:43:20] repent Los
[1:43:22] Angeles I wonder how many of them
[1:43:24] actually did
[1:43:25] repent I trust that some did I hope they
[1:43:29] did repent Los
[1:43:31] Angeles and he spoke like it was already
[1:43:34] in the
[1:43:35] sea that's a prophet that may be un
[1:43:39] years back but it's still going to
[1:43:43] happen that's sayith the Lord a prophet
[1:43:46] has
[1:43:48] spoke he's talking about the Eighth Day
[1:43:51] I'm going to have to ask musicians to
[1:43:57] come notice after 50 days in the future
[1:44:00] home he says there seven sabbaths from
[1:44:01] there there come another holy
[1:44:03] convocation the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:44:05] day of Pentecost on the seventh day or
[1:44:07] on the Eighth Day rather Eighth Day fell
[1:44:09] on the eighth day was seven sabbaths
[1:44:11] later exactly after his resurrection so
[1:44:15] it'll be seven times that again bring
[1:44:17] you right back around to the first day
[1:44:19] of the week again amen
[1:44:22] the bride
[1:44:24] age he says there's your holy
[1:44:27] convocation not have anything to do with
[1:44:29] the literal thing it's beyond that think
[1:44:32] of it think of that he says it's
[1:44:35] literally beyond that the literal
[1:44:38] thing that's what he's saying right
[1:44:41] here it's beyond that it's into the
[1:44:44] kingdom of God with eternal
[1:44:48] life now you don't make let me tell you
[1:44:51] something some of you know me real
[1:44:55] good I love beautiful
[1:44:58] scenery because this sin cursed world
[1:45:02] there's still some beautiful things I
[1:45:04] know some of these mountains were
[1:45:05] created After the
[1:45:07] flood but God put a little bit of icing
[1:45:10] on the cake he made the mountains be
[1:45:12] snow covered beautiful turning Fall
[1:45:15] Foliage and so forth like
[1:45:17] that I like I like those kinds of things
[1:45:19] it's head
[1:45:22] he's in his Sunrise I see you in the
[1:45:25] morning
[1:45:26] morning I see you in the morning God's
[1:45:30] love letter painted in the
[1:45:34] sky he says it's the kingdom of God with
[1:45:37] eternal life with a predestinated that
[1:45:39] never did start never started on any day
[1:45:42] you wasn't saved on any day you was
[1:45:44] always saved Jesus come to redeem that
[1:45:47] but you were saved from the beginning
[1:45:50] because because you had eternal life to
[1:45:53] begin
[1:45:57] with and all God's people said
[1:46:00] amen some of you said it some of you is
[1:46:02] afraid to say it I wonder why I wonder
[1:46:05] why God give you opportunity to believe
[1:46:07] it say it say it I want you to say it
[1:46:09] again I believe
[1:46:10] it say it
[1:46:12] again say it again all right now it
[1:46:15] needs to get down there in the in the
[1:46:16] control room of your heart say it
[1:46:19] again all right now some of you got it
[1:46:21] down in the control room in your heart
[1:46:22] but it needs to get up to the to the
[1:46:24] steer guy at the steering say it again I
[1:46:26] believe it I believe all right send the
[1:46:29] message back up there I'm no more
[1:46:31] conscious of my
[1:46:33] sin let me tell you
[1:46:36] something when that word seed awoke in
[1:46:40] that Samaritan
[1:46:42] woman let me tell you something I look
[1:46:45] every one of you in the eye right now
[1:46:47] but I'm not going to do
[1:46:48] that I look if I can have some way to
[1:46:51] look at myself in the mirror right now
[1:46:53] I'd say you know there's people that I
[1:46:56] wronged there's people that I sinned
[1:46:57] against there's people that I done
[1:47:00] wrong that if I walked into the presence
[1:47:03] right
[1:47:03] now there would be a
[1:47:07] stigma there would be a memory that
[1:47:09] would pop up when I was with them and I
[1:47:12] did this and I did that and I did this
[1:47:14] and I done
[1:47:15] that there was a woman like that called
[1:47:17] a Samaritan woman but when that word see
[1:47:20] brother Terry woke woke up at that point
[1:47:23] and that's what brother brandom is
[1:47:25] trying to point us to that stimulation
[1:47:27] and Revelation that's what the word will
[1:47:29] do for you when you go into your secret
[1:47:32] closet and you have that meeting with
[1:47:34] God and he lifts you up in your
[1:47:37] spirit sometimes you don't even get no
[1:47:39] feeling with it but you get a Blessed
[1:47:44] Assurance but that woman was like a
[1:47:46] brother R said like a house on fire on a
[1:47:48] windy day
[1:47:52] she goes back in the
[1:47:54] city
[1:47:57] remember let say she's a woman
[1:48:02] preacher not really she was a woman
[1:48:07] testifier brother
[1:48:10] Terry she runs to that City who's the
[1:48:12] first person she meets one of her
[1:48:17] [Music]
[1:48:18] clients I think all just quitting
[1:48:22] going no no she was so energized that
[1:48:27] seed had awakened there was no Stigma
[1:48:31] she looked at that man she looked at all
[1:48:33] St no doubt were her clients what
[1:48:35] happened to the stigma it disappeared
[1:48:37] and I tell you once you get charged by
[1:48:40] the word of
[1:48:41] God the devil will have a hard time
[1:48:44] resurrecting pulling up that old memory
[1:48:47] God don't remember it it's just your ACC
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:53] if it so energized her and charged
[1:48:56] her that it
[1:48:58] made
[1:49:00] say you and her
[1:49:03] class I need to go he that
[1:49:06] guy if it'll do that for
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:12] her she had a stick that's why she
[1:49:15] showed up at the well in the middle of
[1:49:16] the day not the early
[1:49:19] morning
[1:49:23] remember Jesus had not yet gone to
[1:49:25] Calvary it woman was taken in the ACT to
[1:49:30] adultery there is God standing in human
[1:49:33] skin God Tabernacle in a fail of Flesh
[1:49:37] tell us here
[1:49:39] woman where are your
[1:49:43] accusers what voice what
[1:49:47] voice was greater than that voice
[1:49:51] what voice there is no other
[1:49:53] voice there is no other voice it was a
[1:49:55] voice of God and he turned to her she
[1:49:59] says I have none you can say I have none
[1:50:03] this morning she didn't even receive the
[1:50:06] blood sacrifice had not yet been
[1:50:09] made
[1:50:10] W she had the same Revelation that
[1:50:14] Abraham and all the rest of those
[1:50:16] Hebrews Warriors of
[1:50:19] faith
[1:50:24] she dropped her water
[1:50:28] poot I'd say till the day of
[1:50:31] Pentecost she probably lived a pretty
[1:50:34] good Sanctified life no it was not
[1:50:36] complete it was not complete she had to
[1:50:39] go into the eighth day but something had
[1:50:42] been resurrected on the inside of her
[1:50:46] already and he said to the other woman
[1:50:49] taking in the very
[1:50:51] act
[1:50:53] neither the one who gave the law the one
[1:50:56] who actually saw the law being
[1:51:00] implemented people were taken in
[1:51:02] adultery and
[1:51:04] stoned the very God who looked down was
[1:51:07] now standing there his mercy and Grace
[1:51:11] says neither do I condemn it
[1:51:16] go and sit no more
[1:51:21] that's before Calvary that's before the
[1:51:23] blood atonement can fully come into its
[1:51:26] total
[1:51:29] manifestation that's recorded word if
[1:51:31] that would do that for them what should
[1:51:33] it do with
[1:51:35] you who have the Holy
[1:51:37] Ghost
[1:51:39] stand stand with
[1:51:43] me holy
[1:51:45] convocation it's already there I I I
[1:51:48] know ministry here could do a far better
[1:51:51] job and I I just barely cracked the door
[1:51:55] open on that
[1:51:58] one where are you now you are the sons
[1:52:02] of God now you are the Tabernacle the
[1:52:06] whole tabernacling the holy
[1:52:08] righteousness of
[1:52:10] God Spirit would Jesus put his Spirit
[1:52:14] into an old
[1:52:16] vessel new wine put into new
[1:52:20] [Music]
[1:52:26] botles the wealth The Riches of Christ
[1:52:30] that's why Paul said forgetting those
[1:52:31] things which are behind and pressing

[1:52:47] where God's at are you there yet are you
[1:52:50] there yet that anything is possible to
[1:52:53] you why did Paul say that that he is
[1:52:56] capable above beyond what we could even
[1:52:58] ask or think do you have that kind of
[1:53:01] thinking that's God thinking brother

[1:53:06] beginning what was the key have the
[1:53:08] faith of God yes you can have your own
[1:53:11] faith but you've got to have his Fai
