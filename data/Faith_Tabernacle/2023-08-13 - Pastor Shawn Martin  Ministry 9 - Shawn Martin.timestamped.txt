[49:18] Lord we're so thankful that we're your
[49:22] children
[49:23] and we've been brought here by Grace
[49:25] father it's been your grace all along in
[49:28] our lives
[49:30] and Lord we we want to share that
[49:35] to others father we want to share our
[49:39] experience of what you have done for us
[49:41] and the hope that lies within us
[49:45] that there is a future
[49:47] Lord that is so bright for your people
[49:51] no God we're just asking now that you
[49:55] would speak to our hearts
[49:57] Lord let it just anchor in our soul that
[50:00] when we leave this place and we go out
[50:04] and talk to others that we could share
[50:07] what you have done with this to us this
[50:10] morning
[50:11] and I pray father that you are just so
[50:15] saturated by your presence Lord and if
[50:18] there's any spirit that would try to
[50:21] hinder your people I pray that you would
[50:24] drive it from this place Lord we're
[50:27] thankful for what you're doing there in
[50:28] Ohio for the young people
[50:30] oh God you're still alive and well
[50:34] we're so thankful father and we love you
[50:37] in Jesus Christ's name
[50:40] amen praise the Lord
[50:44] Hebrews or Hosea the 12th chapter
[50:47] and we've read this before but the 10th
[50:50] verse
[50:52] it says I have
[50:54] also spoken by the prophets and I have
[50:57] multiplied visions
[50:59] and use similitude by the ministry of
[51:04] the prophets
[51:06] amen you can have your seats this
[51:10] morning and I'm going to turn on these
[51:12] lights here
[51:14] but we um
[51:17] want to just continue with the these
[51:21] thought of ministry
[51:24] and
[51:26] Ministry is a powerful thing
[51:28] and when you think of of it being God's
[51:33] Ministry and what it's for and of course
[51:36] Ministry is the agent in which God
[51:40] accomplishes his purpose
[51:43] and it's an eternal purpose that God has
[51:47] and you see God's not continuing to come
[51:51] up with a plan as time as time goes but
[51:57] um he's uh
[52:00] he's infinite and so he has this
[52:03] infinite knowledge he knew the end from
[52:05] the beginning
[52:06] and so uh
[52:09] and according to Isaiah 46 10 we've
[52:13] quoted it many time read it but he's
[52:16] declared the end from the beginning
[52:20] and so uh there there were a people that
[52:25] was in his thinking that was a a seed
[52:30] germ and uh we know uh brother Branham
[52:36] talked heavily on it especially in the
[52:38] latter part of his ministry that uh God
[52:42] would write these people's names
[52:47] uh in the Lamb's Book of Life and and so
[52:52] I believe that this morning sitting here
[52:56] or maybe even listening in uh
[53:00] that uh there are people that are
[53:04] represented in the Lamb's Book of Life
[53:07] and they have their names there and God
[53:11] wrote our name in that book and that is
[53:14] that nothing can take that away nothing
[53:19] can erase it take it out it's there to
[53:23] stay
[53:24] and I I thank the Lord for that and I I
[53:28] pray that all of us here today have
[53:31] have our names written in that book the
[53:35] Lamb's Book and this shows that we were
[53:39] in his thinking before the foundation of
[53:42] the world that God thought of us and he
[53:45] had us in his mind and and so therefore
[53:49] as the prophet taught us this makes us
[53:52] an attribute of his thinking and
[53:56] um his thoughts are Eternal they are
[53:59] real and therefore uh we are as an
[54:04] attribute of his thinking we are Eternal
[54:07] and
[54:09] um and so uh and and I could say it this
[54:12] way we are real uh this being Sons and
[54:15] Daughters of God is not a figment of our
[54:18] imagination being a Christian is
[54:20] something that we just don't imagine but
[54:22] it's a reality and it all stems from the
[54:26] mind of God and so uh now just reading
[54:31] several quotes but brother Brian said
[54:34] there was one time before the foundation
[54:36] of the world I was eternal when God
[54:39] thought of me I was thought of before
[54:41] the foundation of the world my name was
[54:44] put in the Lamb's Book of Life and so
[54:47] was yours before there was even one
[54:50] grain of sand
[54:51] he says how many knows that that's the
[54:54] Bible he said see how many know that God
[54:57] put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[54:59] before the foundation of the world
[55:01] then in God's thinking we were born
[55:05] right into his kingdom then right then
[55:10] we were born into his kingdom and one
[55:14] day there came a body through holy
[55:16] wedlock my mother my father see and they
[55:20] sired me and here I come William Branham
[55:23] represented in a body of Flesh now you
[55:26] know me as William Branham a man God
[55:30] knowed me as William Branham a thought
[55:32] in his own mind and an expression ain't
[55:36] that right so so we we were we want to
[55:40] know what God thought of us now we can
[55:43] think of each other as as as one thing
[55:46] but God's God's thoughts are higher than
[55:49] our thoughts and so we we want to know
[55:53] what he thought of us and so he thinks
[55:56] of you not as a man a woman boy girl he
[56:00] thinks of you as an eternal a lot of his
[56:02] and so he said you in his mind existed
[56:06] before there was a world that's the
[56:08] reason he said he chose you before the
[56:10] foundation of the world it isn't what we
[56:12] think or what somebody else thinks it's
[56:15] what God Eternal see you always was in
[56:19] his thinking it was in him to be man
[56:22] that's the reason Christ was expressed
[56:25] the expressed image now he was to be
[56:28] father he was to be son he was to be
[56:30] savior he was to be healer see there was
[56:34] there was nothing there wasn't even an
[56:36] angel or nothing so then he created the
[56:39] Angels then he become God and he was
[56:41] worshiped then these are the
[56:45] manifestations of his thinking there's
[56:48] nothing wrong everything is going to
[56:50] turn out all right don't be scared God's
[56:53] big timepiece is ticking right along
[56:55] it'll be there it'll have a church
[56:58] without spot or wrinkle for it was in
[57:01] his thinking thank you
[57:03] everything that was in his thinking that
[57:05] was eternal is going to end up just
[57:08] being what he thought it to be it may
[57:11] have not started out to be that way but
[57:13] it will end up that way ain't that right
[57:15] and when I say start it out I'm talking
[57:17] about your natural birth
[57:19] and so it was in his thinking now
[57:22] Jeremiah 29 11 it's it's a scripture
[57:25] we've read here a little bit uh but it
[57:28] says God's saying for I know the
[57:30] thoughts that I think towards you
[57:32] Eternal thoughts saith the Lord thoughts
[57:35] of Peace not of evil and to give you an
[57:38] expected end so that's in his thinking
[57:41] there is an expected end at according to
[57:45] what he thought of you ain't that right
[57:47] so what is our expected end the Bible
[57:50] says in Ephesians 5 25 husbands love
[57:53] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[57:56] church and gave himself for it that he
[57:59] might sanctify it and cleanse it with
[58:02] the washing of Water by the word that he
[58:06] might present it to himself a glorious
[58:10] Church everybody say glorious church not
[58:13] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[58:17] but that it should be holy and without
[58:21] blemish so that's that is a unexpected
[58:26] end that we have Ephesians 1 3 blessed
[58:31] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[58:33] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[58:35] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[58:37] in Christ according as he hath chosen Us
[58:41] in him before the foundation of the
[58:44] world what that we should be sinners
[58:48] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[58:52] before him in love
[58:54] having predestinated us unto the
[58:58] adoption of children or Sons by Jesus
[59:01] Christ to himself according to the good
[59:04] pleasure of his will that's an expected
[59:07] end that we have Romans 8 29 whom he did
[59:10] for no he also did predestinate to be
[59:13] conformed to the image of his son that's
[59:15] an expected end that he has amen and
[59:19] that he might be the firstborn among
[59:21] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[59:24] predestinate them he also called past
[59:26] tense when before the foundation of the
[59:28] world it's all in his thinking and whom
[59:31] he called them he also justified in whom
[59:33] he justified then he also glorified see
[59:38] he knows amen the thoughts that he
[59:40] thinks toward us and he's had it all
[59:43] along in this book right here ain't that
[59:45] right amen so we we look again Romans 8
[59:49] 16 the spirit itself beareth witness
[59:51] with our spirit that we are children of
[59:53] God and if children then heirs and if
[59:57] and then then heirs Heirs of God and
[1:00:01] Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ with Jesus
[1:00:04] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:00:07] that we may also be glorified together
[1:00:09] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:00:12] present time are not worthy to be
[1:00:13] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:00:16] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:00:18] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:00:21] the manifestation of the sons of God why
[1:00:23] are they waiting for it why are they
[1:00:25] groaning for it because that's an
[1:00:27] expected end that God had for you and I
[1:00:30] for the creature was made subject to
[1:00:32] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:00:35] him who has subjected the very same in
[1:00:38] Hope ain't that right so he didn't just
[1:00:41] subject you into this world of sin and
[1:00:43] Corruption but now he also subjected you
[1:00:47] to Hope which was in his thinking ain't
[1:00:49] that right so that's what we're coming
[1:00:51] to because the creature itself also
[1:00:55] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:00:58] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:01:01] the children of God so to come to that
[1:01:03] expected end there has to be and
[1:01:06] deliverance a man that takes place
[1:01:08] within every thought of a man and woman
[1:01:12] boy or a girl a man that was in God's
[1:01:14] thinking ain't that right for we know
[1:01:17] that the whole creation groaneth uh and
[1:01:19] travail Us in pain together until now
[1:01:22] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:01:24] which have the first fruits of the
[1:01:25] spirit even we everybody say I amen even
[1:01:30] we ourselves groaning we're groaning why
[1:01:34] because we were the Eternal thoughts of
[1:01:36] God Amen and you cannot be anything but
[1:01:39] what God thought you to be this you your
[1:01:42] condition tonight amen or today is not
[1:01:45] Eternal your sickness is not Eternal
[1:01:48] amen your mind battles is not Eternal
[1:01:50] your discouragement is not Eternal amen
[1:01:53] you have you're you're a sin and
[1:01:56] and and all of these things is not
[1:01:58] Eternal can you say Amen them things
[1:02:01] have got to pass away and there's
[1:02:03] something within us that is groaning
[1:02:04] it's like the the little chicken uh
[1:02:07] that's that's not been hatched out of
[1:02:09] that egg but if there's life in that egg
[1:02:11] if there's life there and then and then
[1:02:14] at a certain time that chicken was not
[1:02:17] made to be in that egg all the time
[1:02:19] ain't that right it was there for a
[1:02:21] season but it has to break away and it
[1:02:24] starts pecking and pecking it you can't
[1:02:26] crack the egg for it it has to it has to
[1:02:29] do it with the end and if there's
[1:02:31] something within it that's groaning to
[1:02:33] be delivered to be set free and it
[1:02:35] starts working its way until it finally
[1:02:38] breaks that shell ain't that right well
[1:02:40] every trial that you go through
[1:02:42] everything that you go through either
[1:02:45] there's a life that's in you and if
[1:02:46] there's a life in you then there's a
[1:02:48] pecking that's going on there's
[1:02:50] something that is causing you Amen to
[1:02:53] push to break pass this thing you're
[1:02:56] breaking past your trials you're
[1:02:57] breaking past the habits you're breaking
[1:02:59] past the sins and all of these things
[1:03:01] one these days you're going to break
[1:03:03] this Old Shell of Flesh amen into
[1:03:06] another can you say Amen that we
[1:03:08] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:03:10] for the adoption to wit the Redemption
[1:03:13] of our body now so these are these are
[1:03:16] the Eternal thoughts this is unexpected
[1:03:18] end that God has for every thought of
[1:03:21] his eternal thought uh uh those whose
[1:03:25] names were in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:03:26] now we talk about becoming the word
[1:03:29] brother Branham in many places and and
[1:03:31] to be honest we we uh didn't know what
[1:03:35] becoming the word was until we began to
[1:03:38] look into the message and as the prophet
[1:03:40] that began to tell us a man that it's
[1:03:43] not a church it's the word it's not
[1:03:45] denomination it's the word it's it's you
[1:03:48] say well I'm In Love With Jesus well
[1:03:50] what are you what Jesus are you in love
[1:03:51] with your own imagination of him or is
[1:03:54] it the word ain't that right see it all
[1:03:56] comes back to the word the word the word
[1:03:58] the word well we're becoming the word
[1:04:00] and he says the word becomes you and you
[1:04:03] become the word see and then another
[1:04:05] place you become the word as you receive
[1:04:08] the word ain't that right amen another
[1:04:11] place he says the word assures us of the
[1:04:14] promise us because it is the promise it
[1:04:17] is the promise see this is God's
[1:04:19] thoughts and Seed form ain't that right
[1:04:21] it's the word of God it's an expression
[1:04:23] of God's thoughts and this is the
[1:04:25] promise not what the doctor told you not
[1:04:28] what you feel not your feelings and not
[1:04:30] not your mind amen but this is the
[1:04:33] promise that comes from the thoughts of
[1:04:35] God concerning you amen so the word
[1:04:38] assures us of the promise because it is
[1:04:40] the promise the word is the promise and
[1:04:43] the word is the God and the word is ours
[1:04:46] do you believe that and we become the
[1:04:50] word and the word becomes us if you
[1:04:53] abide in me and my word up in you and
[1:04:56] see then it just becomes one great big
[1:04:59] family ain't that right so who is part
[1:05:02] of this one great big family those
[1:05:06] Eternal thoughts can you say man and
[1:05:09] they are becoming the word in this age
[1:05:12] well see so we talk about the word
[1:05:16] becoming the word well you cannot become
[1:05:18] the word unless you were a thought
[1:05:20] because the word is only the expression
[1:05:23] of a thought can you say amen amen and
[1:05:27] then we're taking it even a further step
[1:05:29] is that we're becoming the manifestation
[1:05:32] of the word so it's it but we start it
[1:05:35] as a thought which was in God's mind and
[1:05:38] if you were a thought then you take the
[1:05:40] process of becoming the word and being a
[1:05:43] manifested word ain't that right amen
[1:05:46] you can't be word here today and not and
[1:05:49] and live and be contrary to the thoughts
[1:05:52] of God it's all the same channel it's
[1:05:54] all the same thing it's just uh uh
[1:05:57] coming in different forms so so a word
[1:06:00] is a thought expressed and so you cannot
[1:06:03] become the word amen without being a
[1:06:06] thought first ain't that right so the
[1:06:09] Eternal Word is only the expression of
[1:06:12] God's Eternal thoughts amen Jesus was
[1:06:16] the word which means that God's thoughts
[1:06:19] was expressed the prophet said in a
[1:06:21] human body amen we call it he called him
[1:06:24] the word he was the word amen but what
[1:06:27] he was was God's thoughts expressed in a
[1:06:31] human body ain't that right amen that's
[1:06:34] why Jesus was his his he said my meat is
[1:06:38] to do the will of him that sent me what
[1:06:40] was he going to do express the thoughts
[1:06:42] of God Amen and that's exactly what
[1:06:44] we're doing here that's why we're here
[1:06:46] is we're coming to do the will of the
[1:06:48] Father which is only what he had thought
[1:06:51] of us to do and to be before the
[1:06:54] foundation of the world he thought of a
[1:06:57] bride amen and that's what we're here to
[1:06:59] be ain't that right he thought of of a
[1:07:02] bride that was spotless uh without
[1:07:04] wrinkle blemish and and all these things
[1:07:06] he thought of a powerful church he
[1:07:08] thought of a a church that that was
[1:07:11] separated from the world and separated
[1:07:13] from all these things well that's what
[1:07:15] we're here Amen to do and to be we're
[1:07:19] here to do the will of him that sent us
[1:07:23] because it's only God's thoughts
[1:07:25] expressed in our human body
[1:07:28] so in the message the Mighty God
[1:07:30] unveiled before us in 64. uh brother
[1:07:35] Branham tells us that Jesus came into
[1:07:39] this world
[1:07:40] and he expressed exactly what the Old
[1:07:43] Testament said he would
[1:07:45] then all those
[1:07:48] who was redeemable believed it because
[1:07:51] they themselves were the thoughts of God
[1:07:55] the attributes of him at the beginning
[1:07:57] was made flesh and redeemable and was
[1:08:02] brought back to God
[1:08:04] and you say Amen amen see so he was the
[1:08:10] thoughts of God the expressed thoughts
[1:08:12] made flesh and all of those thoughts
[1:08:16] that were in that age that believed him
[1:08:19] they were redeemable
[1:08:22] ain't that right others live by the law
[1:08:25] others lived by whatever amen they lived
[1:08:28] by a word of day past and and and and
[1:08:30] these things and and that when he came
[1:08:33] they rejected him and he told them
[1:08:37] that's the sign that you're of your
[1:08:38] father the devil
[1:08:40] ain't that right now John 1 12
[1:08:44] Jesus uh or it says here as many as
[1:08:48] received him to them gave he power to
[1:08:52] become the sons of God ain't that right
[1:08:54] now brother brannerman reading that says
[1:08:57] this he gave them power to become the
[1:08:59] sons of God because they were redeemable
[1:09:03] ain't that right they were redeemable
[1:09:04] they were from the beginning in the
[1:09:07] expression from the beginning and notice
[1:09:11] what he says then he says the message of
[1:09:14] the hour is the expressed thoughts of
[1:09:18] Jehovah
[1:09:20] do you believe that
[1:09:21] the message of the hour is the expressed
[1:09:25] thoughts of Jehovah now you know uh uh
[1:09:29] sometime you know we we might think and
[1:09:32] maybe or before especially before we
[1:09:35] come into the messages is I I wished I
[1:09:37] could have been there in the days of
[1:09:39] Jesus and and and and and got to touch
[1:09:42] him got to hear him got to got to
[1:09:45] fellowship with him and and and these
[1:09:47] things it'd been nice to be there with
[1:09:49] like Nathaniel and and stand before him
[1:09:52] or like Peter and and you know the woman
[1:09:55] at the well and all these things and and
[1:09:57] and and and and and how we would have
[1:09:59] loved to been there but you realize you
[1:10:01] have the same opportunity to accept the
[1:10:04] same person in this age that they did
[1:10:07] back then you have the same opportunity
[1:10:09] to reject as the Rich Young Ruler did or
[1:10:13] you have that opportunity to accept it
[1:10:15] because as he was the expressed thoughts
[1:10:19] of God in a human body so is this
[1:10:22] message the express thoughts of Jehovah
[1:10:26] God for this age here in in in in in in
[1:10:29] this time and I say those who are
[1:10:33] redeemable will believe this message
[1:10:36] those who are redeemable a man will
[1:10:39] believe this message amen it's all set
[1:10:42] again it's it's the same thing he's the
[1:10:45] same brother Brown said he's the same in
[1:10:46] every every way except his Corporal body
[1:10:49] ain't that right now so so now this is
[1:10:54] Brother branham's explanation as to why
[1:10:57] uh uh that that one he says is odd to
[1:11:01] the other it must be that way it it was
[1:11:04] always it always has been that way and
[1:11:08] it always will be that way why because
[1:11:10] those that are redeemable believe this
[1:11:14] message with all that's within them see
[1:11:17] because it is the expressed thoughts of
[1:11:21] Jehovah that's the way we see this
[1:11:23] message we don't see it as a seventh
[1:11:25] grade Kentuckian coming and trying to
[1:11:28] explain to us the mysteries of God Amen
[1:11:30] that we see it amen a prophet that
[1:11:33] caught up in the mind of God Amen and
[1:11:36] become I'm the expression of God Amen to
[1:11:39] reveal the expressed thoughts of of you
[1:11:41] and I see amen even brother Branham
[1:11:43] didn't even tell her couldn't even tell
[1:11:45] us amen that we were the germ seed of
[1:11:48] God do you realize that it look in his
[1:11:50] his early Ministry he never even talked
[1:11:52] about being a germ seed of God he never
[1:11:54] even talked about that stuff amen but
[1:11:56] after the lamb come and open that book
[1:11:58] amen and the lamb brought this book down
[1:12:01] to earth and gave it to that seventh
[1:12:03] angel amen the message began to take
[1:12:05] place and become personal then Amen to
[1:12:08] let you know you've never done it in the
[1:12:10] first place you've always been Justified
[1:12:12] you are a gene seed of God to Justified
[1:12:15] amen and not only that he's already saw
[1:12:18] you over there amen see it's all a man
[1:12:21] uh uh uh it's God it becomes the
[1:12:25] expressed thoughts of God and that's how
[1:12:27] we take this message
[1:12:29] a man is the express Parts Express see
[1:12:32] people people want to dissect it and
[1:12:34] they want to tear it apart and they and
[1:12:36] and it sickens my stomach when when
[1:12:38] people do that and they start now you
[1:12:40] know uh brother branham's opinion and
[1:12:42] brother Brandon says I'll take his
[1:12:43] opinion as we said so many times I'll
[1:12:45] take his opinion over anybody's opinion
[1:12:47] any day I I'll I'll take his opinion
[1:12:51] over scientific facts
[1:12:53] any day
[1:12:55] you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:12:57] because he lived in the presence of that
[1:12:59] Pillar of Fire he was there constantly
[1:13:02] under that presence
[1:13:06] so but this brother Bram says this is
[1:13:09] why we're ought to one and uh what what
[1:13:12] ought to the other ought to the world
[1:13:13] odd see now if you if you go listen to
[1:13:17] that sermon the Mighty God unveiled
[1:13:19] before us
[1:13:21] at the beginning you will hear Brother
[1:13:23] Brown's sight now many people has
[1:13:25] wondered why we are so odd and so noisy
[1:13:28] you know this kind of a different type
[1:13:31] of convention then this is a different
[1:13:34] kind of type of convention that what
[1:13:37] people are used to seeing and usually
[1:13:39] everything is kind of cut and dried form
[1:13:43] but when you come to these conventions
[1:13:45] which has been my privilege now for
[1:13:47] several years since they first started
[1:13:50] uh uh and we don't know Harley what
[1:13:53] we're going to do we just come and
[1:13:55] surrender ourselves and that's the only
[1:13:56] thing we know to do and God does the
[1:13:59] rest so that makes us a very peculiar
[1:14:03] acting people
[1:14:05] and you say Amen it makes us a very
[1:14:09] peculiar acting now that was that was in
[1:14:12] the beginning of his sermon and then he
[1:14:14] goes on and he's talking see about about
[1:14:17] these things and he says and the message
[1:14:19] of the hour is to express thoughts of
[1:14:21] Jehovah and that's why we are odd one to
[1:14:24] the other
[1:14:26] that's why we're odd to the other is
[1:14:28] because there's a people that actually
[1:14:30] believe this
[1:14:32] that's what made the the people in in in
[1:14:36] Jesus's day so odd to the church so odd
[1:14:40] to the world is because they realize
[1:14:43] this is the one that God promised
[1:14:47] can you say Amen so see now then he goes
[1:14:51] and says see the world gets in such a
[1:14:53] rut till something different makes it so
[1:14:56] odd tell the people think that it's
[1:14:59] something it's some something that is
[1:15:01] wrong
[1:15:03] people get in such a rut that when God
[1:15:05] does something outside of that then they
[1:15:08] look at it and say that has to be
[1:15:09] something wrong and so we're considered
[1:15:12] an occult we're considered odd for and
[1:15:15] and they always you're following a man
[1:15:17] you're following a man we don't follow a
[1:15:19] man you know and and and they are so
[1:15:21] they're so warped in their thinking
[1:15:23] because this was written amen now I know
[1:15:26] we all say written by the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:28] who pinned it you know you understand
[1:15:30] now God wrote words on the wall amen God
[1:15:33] wrote the The Ten Commandments amen
[1:15:35] ain't that right that he took men and he
[1:15:38] wrote These Pages these words were
[1:15:40] written by men that God used ain't that
[1:15:44] right they were under the unction of the
[1:15:46] Holy Ghost but still it was a man's hand
[1:15:49] that took a pen and began to scribble
[1:15:52] the words in in on the pages ain't that
[1:15:55] right amen well if God can use them men
[1:15:57] to do that then cannot God raise up a
[1:16:00] man in this day amen and anoint him and
[1:16:02] so feel him and use him to where he
[1:16:06] could express his very thoughts amen
[1:16:08] we're not following a man we're
[1:16:09] following the pillar of fire that was
[1:16:12] over that man in that man that worked
[1:16:14] through that man
[1:16:15] ain't that right but see the world gets
[1:16:18] in such a rut
[1:16:20] tell something different makes it so odd
[1:16:23] till the people think that there's
[1:16:25] something wrong
[1:16:26] see and so people in this day or Through
[1:16:29] the Ages that got in the Rut
[1:16:31] of denominational thinking and
[1:16:34] traditions of men to where when God sent
[1:16:37] the message which is God's thoughts amen
[1:16:41] or the express thoughts of Jehovah's
[1:16:43] brother bran would say then they think
[1:16:46] that there's something wrong with it
[1:16:47] amen because it's out of denominational
[1:16:51] thinking this message came out of the
[1:16:53] box it's not in the box as they would
[1:16:56] say ain't that right see so people have
[1:16:59] gotten so formal to where they just have
[1:17:02] a form of religion and the Bible already
[1:17:04] told us that the people of this age
[1:17:06] would have a form of godliness and would
[1:17:09] deny the power of God Amen so when the
[1:17:12] people amen that accept the power of God
[1:17:15] and they're not following the trend of
[1:17:17] just having a form of church having a
[1:17:20] form of worship having traditional
[1:17:22] things and and and and their their
[1:17:24] worship is out of the box their worship
[1:17:26] is under inspiration their Worship Is by
[1:17:28] Revelation when we run around the church
[1:17:31] there's something there that is behind
[1:17:33] that when we get up and shout and scream
[1:17:35] there's something behind that and they
[1:17:37] will say oh that's fanaticism oh they're
[1:17:40] in the flesh oh they're this see they're
[1:17:42] so carnal they can't tell the difference
[1:17:44] between a carnal Pentecostal and a true
[1:17:47] revelated message believer
[1:17:50] ain't that right but they've gotten it
[1:17:53] so there see into such a form that when
[1:17:57] those who are the redeemable thoughts of
[1:17:59] God begin to shout and to Rejoice
[1:18:02] they're considered odd
[1:18:04] they're considered working up a crowd
[1:18:07] can you say man but really what it is
[1:18:10] they're really shouting amen because
[1:18:13] they see what the message is really
[1:18:15] about amen see the redeemable thoughts
[1:18:18] of God are people who lived and are
[1:18:22] living in their appointed day and age
[1:18:25] All Through the Ages there has been a
[1:18:28] people that have lived in the in an age
[1:18:31] and they are currently living today in
[1:18:34] uh uh uh uh in this age who are the
[1:18:38] people of the Living God the Eternal
[1:18:40] thoughts of God
[1:18:42] can you say Amen
[1:18:44] and what they are is they're the sons of
[1:18:47] God
[1:18:48] who in God's mind shouted for joy
[1:18:52] a man before the foundation of the world
[1:18:55] you shouted for joy
[1:18:57] can you say it with me I shouted for joy
[1:19:00] yeah I shouted for joy where in the mind
[1:19:03] of God
[1:19:05] amen that's right see so this is why
[1:19:08] brother Brown says shouting this the
[1:19:10] shouting religions the oldest religion
[1:19:12] there ever is was because it started in
[1:19:15] the mind of God
[1:19:16] amen so notice in the beginning of the
[1:19:19] sermon again the Mighty God unveiled
[1:19:21] before us brother bran said I thought
[1:19:23] tonight if the Lord was willing I would
[1:19:26] try to read some scriptures pertaining
[1:19:27] to this and would speak to you in just a
[1:19:30] few moments and tried to show you why we
[1:19:33] are such an odd people
[1:19:36] we're not people
[1:19:39] do you believe that
[1:19:41] we're odd
[1:19:42] because we see and believe that this
[1:19:47] message of the hour is the express
[1:19:49] thoughts of Jehovah and we received it
[1:19:52] well there there there is a result in
[1:19:57] receiving it as many as received him to
[1:20:01] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:20:04] God
[1:20:05] amen and you say man
[1:20:08] that's right so this message is the
[1:20:12] perfect word can you say that with me
[1:20:14] perfect word
[1:20:15] expressing the perfect thoughts
[1:20:18] of God
[1:20:21] now
[1:20:22] brother Brown says when Satan tempts us
[1:20:25] we are to resist him in a perfect faith
[1:20:29] in a perfect word like Jesus did
[1:20:33] the word of God is perfect we're to have
[1:20:36] perfect faith in this perfect word and
[1:20:40] resists Satan
[1:20:42] ain't that right
[1:20:44] so so now just bear with me as we
[1:20:46] continue now as we know we are the
[1:20:49] Fallen thoughts of God we fail from
[1:20:53] God's thinking that's what brother
[1:20:54] Branham said about the woman at the well
[1:20:56] she she had fallen from God's thoughts
[1:20:58] and we all did if you were a thought of
[1:21:01] God in the beginning you came as a
[1:21:03] fallen thought of God but then Jesus
[1:21:06] came to be a redeemer and we know what
[1:21:08] that word is brother Branham showed us
[1:21:10] and told us that redeem is to pick up
[1:21:12] that which is falling amen something
[1:21:15] that had fallen ain't that right so then
[1:21:17] your Fallen condition did not change you
[1:21:21] a man uh uh change you in the mind of
[1:21:24] God what God thought of you has always
[1:21:27] been because it's an eternal thought so
[1:21:30] so whether you were in the gutter
[1:21:31] whether you lived as a prostitute as a
[1:21:33] drunk as a druggie as a just a religious
[1:21:36] churchgoer uh or whatever it was a man
[1:21:40] that you as a fallen thought it did not
[1:21:43] change change what God saw in you and
[1:21:46] what God thought you to be ain't that
[1:21:48] right see so now you may not know what
[1:21:51] you're to be I may not know what I was
[1:21:53] to be but God knew God knew from the
[1:21:55] beginning amen of what you and I were to
[1:21:58] be second Timothy 2 and 19 the
[1:22:02] foundation of God stand to sure having
[1:22:04] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:22:07] his ain't that right he knows us so he
[1:22:10] never got lost you never got lost in the
[1:22:13] crowd God knows you amen he knew where
[1:22:16] you've been all alone you might have
[1:22:17] moved to 50 states in in in 10 years
[1:22:20] amen but God still knows exactly where
[1:22:23] you are he knows your number that that's
[1:22:25] why he would send a prophet and and that
[1:22:27] Prophet it didn't matter where they were
[1:22:28] or whatever amen when God would show
[1:22:30] that Prophet where that man lived that
[1:22:32] woman lived he would begin to tell their
[1:22:34] address and you live in a I see a lake
[1:22:36] and I see this and I see mountains and I
[1:22:38] see that well you live in such and such
[1:22:40] Town what was it it was God letting us
[1:22:43] know that he knows his exactly where we
[1:22:45] live he knows when you visit the doctor
[1:22:47] he knows what the doctor looks like he
[1:22:48] knows what the doctor has told you he
[1:22:51] knows what you just thought about he
[1:22:52] knows everything about you can you say
[1:22:54] amen amen and so uh infinite is his
[1:22:58] thinking amen that that you cannot get
[1:23:01] lost in the crowd and you cannot sin
[1:23:04] solo you cannot be such a scumbag that
[1:23:07] God don't know what you were in his mind
[1:23:10] in the beginning
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:14] thank you
[1:23:17] the scars in your life cannot disfigure
[1:23:20] your disfig you your whatever
[1:23:26] enough
[1:23:28] to hide you from God
[1:23:29] [Music]
[1:23:33] the message identification 64
[1:23:38] to redeem back
[1:23:42] to a place where it was at the beginning
[1:23:46] so that none will so none will be picked
[1:23:50] up but them that was in his thoughts at
[1:23:52] the beginning
[1:23:54] he come to redeem not this cannon fodder
[1:23:57] that we see a rig see around professing
[1:23:59] to be Christians
[1:24:01] but that he came to redeem that was in
[1:24:04] God's thinking at the beginning
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:07] this other is just something that mixed
[1:24:10] around to show the stature
[1:24:12] see it it's a garden a flower garden
[1:24:15] that plays its part but the stature is
[1:24:18] what you want to see the statue of
[1:24:20] Christ
[1:24:21] which was God projected in the earth in
[1:24:24] the form of a man that's the stature you
[1:24:27] want to see that's the one this other is
[1:24:30] just makeup parts
[1:24:32] another place God in the beginning was
[1:24:34] life the Eternal one
[1:24:36] in him was attributes and those
[1:24:38] attributes became words and the word
[1:24:41] became flesh and Jesus was the Redeemer
[1:24:44] and to redeem means to bring back if he
[1:24:47] has to bring it back it had to be
[1:24:49] somewhere to be brought back to so you
[1:24:52] see all people will never be able to see
[1:24:54] it because all people wasn't in the
[1:24:57] beginning in God's thoughts
[1:24:59] can you say man this message means
[1:25:02] nothing to anyone nothing to no one else
[1:25:04] but but those thoughts of God
[1:25:08] amen the real Ministry of God means
[1:25:12] nothing to no one else but it does to
[1:25:15] the Fallen thoughts of God
[1:25:17] can you say amen that's right and I'm
[1:25:20] talking about real Ministry the one I'm
[1:25:22] part of and that's the message of the
[1:25:23] hour
[1:25:24] amen that's right amen say Melchizedek
[1:25:27] come to to to Abraham not to lot not not
[1:25:31] the bat not not lot uh brother Branham
[1:25:34] typed him as the foolish virgin in one
[1:25:36] place I think and then another place the
[1:25:38] lukewarm believer and and all these
[1:25:40] things but lot received a totally
[1:25:42] different message uh uh God sent Billy
[1:25:45] Graham or Robert's messages and all them
[1:25:47] under that that message goes for them
[1:25:50] that anyone with the message of the hour
[1:25:52] goes for the bride
[1:25:55] brother Branham did it we do it right
[1:25:57] Jesus did it we do it
[1:26:00] same Ministry the message of the hour
[1:26:01] you cannot water this message down
[1:26:04] this message is the message of Jesus
[1:26:06] Christ it's the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:26:10] right so now brother Branham said see
[1:26:14] the foolish virgin has to suffer for her
[1:26:16] Deeds
[1:26:17] but the bride who has become the word
[1:26:20] a complete atonement was made of Christ
[1:26:23] calls he is the word that body was
[1:26:26] rendered and when that body was rendered
[1:26:28] the bride was in that body because it's
[1:26:31] all everybody say all the word the bride
[1:26:35] is all of the word ain't that right so
[1:26:37] now God knows uh uh who is to make up
[1:26:40] his word bride
[1:26:42] the Bible talks about the marriage
[1:26:44] supper of the Lamb God knows who is
[1:26:47] going to sit at that that table and
[1:26:50] who's going to partake of that supper
[1:26:52] ain't that right the Bible talks about
[1:26:54] the Millennium God knows who is going to
[1:26:57] be there
[1:26:59] the Bible talks about the new city God
[1:27:02] knows who is going to live in it yeah uh
[1:27:06] Hebrews 11 16 it says he hath prepared
[1:27:09] for them for them a city
[1:27:12] for them
[1:27:14] it was them the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:27:17] can you say man for they are the ones
[1:27:19] that's going to live in the city
[1:27:21] ain't that right and they're the ones
[1:27:23] that make up the bride so he hath
[1:27:25] prepared for them a city
[1:27:28] Hallelujah he knows you're coming
[1:27:31] he knows that he's under you you think
[1:27:33] about you being under expectation he's
[1:27:35] he's under greater expectation because
[1:27:38] it's his thoughts his thoughts they came
[1:27:41] from him
[1:27:42] he's the one that's been dwelling on
[1:27:43] them we're just now beginning to come
[1:27:45] into line with him thoughts and we begin
[1:27:47] we start now to come into a stock
[1:27:49] pattern but he's always had them
[1:27:52] can you say Amen John 14 and 2 in My
[1:27:56] Father's House Jesus said our many
[1:27:58] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:28:00] told you but I go to prepare everybody
[1:28:03] say prepare a place for you
[1:28:07] you who
[1:28:09] Eternal thoughts of God
[1:28:11] it's just the truth can you say man now
[1:28:14] we know others are going to make it but
[1:28:16] but I'm talking about him preparing amen
[1:28:18] he prepared that this city is prepared
[1:28:21] amen for his thoughts
[1:28:23] sure this this this place is prepared
[1:28:27] amen for those that were in his thinking
[1:28:30] before the foundation of the world
[1:28:33] and you say Amen
[1:28:34] amen he's preparing a place for his
[1:28:36] bride
[1:28:40] so he's speaking to every predestinated
[1:28:42] seed see so he knows exactly who he's
[1:28:46] preparing uh uh uh for and and and knows
[1:28:50] that they're going to be there now if he
[1:28:53] is gone to prepare a place for his elect
[1:28:56] then also he is preparing his elect for
[1:29:01] that place
[1:29:04] notice the prophet said she is a
[1:29:06] prepared uh she is a city prepared for a
[1:29:10] prepared people
[1:29:11] she awaits only for her inhabitants and
[1:29:15] soon they will throng her streets with
[1:29:18] joy
[1:29:19] Church it ain't gonna be too much longer
[1:29:22] can you say man he's been there
[1:29:25] preparing but he's also been doing
[1:29:27] something on this Earth to prepare his
[1:29:30] elect for it amen
[1:29:33] our opening scripture talks about the
[1:29:37] ministry of the prophets
[1:29:39] throughout the ages he has seen His
[1:29:42] prophets
[1:29:43] to cut his people out
[1:29:46] God the prophet said God chopped his
[1:29:49] people out of the rest of the Nations he
[1:29:51] chopped his Nation out of a nation and
[1:29:54] he chops his church out of the churches
[1:29:57] Revelations 18 4 I heard another voice
[1:30:00] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[1:30:01] people come out why it's got to be a
[1:30:04] preparation time
[1:30:06] come out of hurt my people that you be
[1:30:07] not partaker of her sins and that you
[1:30:10] received none of her plagues
[1:30:11] now how do you come out
[1:30:14] how how does a man a woman boy girl come
[1:30:18] out of her
[1:30:19] now you talking about such a drawing uh
[1:30:23] drawing card that she's got a power a
[1:30:26] suction power that she has that she is
[1:30:29] calls on the World to come right back to
[1:30:32] her
[1:30:33] how do we come out of that
[1:30:35] well
[1:30:37] Malachi 4 5 says behold I'll send you
[1:30:40] Elijah the prophet
[1:30:42] before the coming of the great and
[1:30:43] Dreadful day and he
[1:30:45] I'll put it this way and he shall chop
[1:30:47] you out
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:51] that's the way he's done it with all the
[1:30:52] uh all his people he's chopped him out
[1:30:55] he shall cue you out
[1:30:57] can you say man so he's got a Ministry
[1:31:00] this Prophet that has come has got a
[1:31:02] Ministry
[1:31:03] Isaiah 51 and 1 hearken to me ye that
[1:31:07] follow after righteousness ye that seek
[1:31:09] the Lord look unto the Rock
[1:31:13] when you are hewn and to the whole of
[1:31:15] the pit which you are digged
[1:31:18] now this word hewn or huge is to cut to
[1:31:21] carve out of something and according to
[1:31:24] Hosea 6 5 they are hewed out by the
[1:31:28] prophets
[1:31:29] ain't that right
[1:31:31] so again God took Israel and chopped him
[1:31:34] out
[1:31:34] By His prophets
[1:31:36] brother Brandon said he chopped his
[1:31:38] Nation from the Nations by the prophets
[1:31:40] his Vindicated word
[1:31:44] so it has to be a Vindicated prophet
[1:31:47] not just anyone running around saying
[1:31:48] I'm a prophet
[1:31:51] is to to have authority over you
[1:31:54] is to have power over you
[1:31:56] because they may cut you up but they may
[1:31:58] not cut you out
[1:32:00] we need someone to cut us out
[1:32:04] ain't that right so brother Brown says
[1:32:07] see he has chopped his bride from the
[1:32:09] denominations by his word promised by
[1:32:11] Malachi 4 in the last days chopped out
[1:32:14] his bride hewed her from the rest of the
[1:32:16] churches hewed out his bride so I say to
[1:32:20] you today the elect isn't meant to be
[1:32:22] like the world
[1:32:24] that's what makes us odd
[1:32:27] and you say man and it's it's it's
[1:32:29] impossible to truly follow a man a
[1:32:33] Vindicated prophet in his message and
[1:32:35] still be conformed to this world ain't
[1:32:37] that right a Vindicated Prophet The
[1:32:40] Prophet said coming to a people is a
[1:32:43] sign to that people that God cares for
[1:32:46] them
[1:32:47] you'll listen to the message he cares do
[1:32:49] you care
[1:32:51] amen God showed that he cared for the
[1:32:53] people
[1:32:55] by sending them a prophet
[1:32:57] ain't that right see what good would it
[1:33:00] be to talk about heaven
[1:33:03] what good see we we people all around
[1:33:06] the world for ages have written about
[1:33:08] songs about heaven talked about heaven
[1:33:11] how beautiful Heaven Must Be You know uh
[1:33:15] I can only imagine and and on and on all
[1:33:18] about heaven amen and and that's great
[1:33:21] that's wonderful
[1:33:23] but see Heaven is so far Out Of Reach if
[1:33:26] you ain't got a prophet to chop you out
[1:33:29] and prepare you for that place
[1:33:34] it's true
[1:33:37] because what good would it be to talk
[1:33:39] about heaven the Millennium and the
[1:33:40] Rapture if there wasn't a preparation
[1:33:43] made
[1:33:44] there has to be a preparation made
[1:33:47] ain't that right how could we rejoice in
[1:33:50] the fact that that we are not going in
[1:33:52] the tribulation and that we are going to
[1:33:54] escape the the wrath of God if there
[1:33:58] wasn't a way prepared for our Escape
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:04] in the days of Noah the prophet said God
[1:34:06] cared for those who cared to escape the
[1:34:09] Judgment of God
[1:34:10] and he showed that he cared by sending
[1:34:12] them a prophet they cared
[1:34:14] to to escape
[1:34:16] not too many did but but there were some
[1:34:19] we didn't know who it was until the
[1:34:21] message came Noah's message came and and
[1:34:25] hewed them out and found out there was
[1:34:27] only eight
[1:34:30] but it took a message
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] to bring a separation
[1:34:36] to call them out
[1:34:37] ain't that right
[1:34:39] now the this Prophet uh brother Brown
[1:34:41] said this Prophet directed them to God's
[1:34:43] provided way see that's that's God's way
[1:34:46] of doing things God spoke to Noah which
[1:34:48] was the word it wasn't the written word
[1:34:50] then and God told and told Noah to
[1:34:53] prepare an ark for the saving of the
[1:34:56] people and to warn all the people that
[1:34:58] he had one way everybody say one way of
[1:35:02] salvation
[1:35:03] one way of Salvation and this man was a
[1:35:07] Vindicated prophet and proved them the
[1:35:09] way of Escape see and notice the humble
[1:35:13] and sincere heard this man and believed
[1:35:16] him and they escaped what did they
[1:35:20] escape they escaped the death of the
[1:35:23] world of sin that was being destroyed in
[1:35:25] that day they accept the days death root
[1:35:28] that was laying upon the whole world
[1:35:30] ain't that right so God sent that
[1:35:33] prophet and that Prophet showed the way
[1:35:36] of provision amen and today the ark is
[1:35:39] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:35:41] do you believe that well that's what
[1:35:43] brother Branham said so he cared he so
[1:35:46] cared for them until he prepared a way
[1:35:50] that they could come into and would be
[1:35:53] free from all the judgments that was
[1:35:55] coming he did that to the elect now we
[1:35:59] know that see he did that to the elect
[1:36:01] only to the elected now they was the one
[1:36:04] who had accepted this germ of Life they
[1:36:07] were the one who was predestinated to
[1:36:10] see it ain't that right now God we know
[1:36:12] that the judgment's coming we know all
[1:36:14] this is happening but in this day
[1:36:16] there's been a way that has been
[1:36:18] preached unto us that only those
[1:36:21] irredeemable thoughts will accept that
[1:36:24] it's been prepared
[1:36:27] in the in in the first Exodus God sent
[1:36:31] the people a prophet to show that he
[1:36:33] cared for them
[1:36:37] destruction was coming upon the land
[1:36:39] God's going to destroy Egypt so God sent
[1:36:42] a prophet to them to prepare them
[1:36:45] to show them away of Escape
[1:36:48] ain't that right
[1:36:50] God had told Abraham years before that
[1:36:53] he would deal with Egypt when the cup of
[1:36:55] iniquity got sealed up
[1:36:57] Egypt had heaped their sins so high
[1:36:59] until God had to send judgment
[1:37:01] but the prophet said God didn't want to
[1:37:03] pour out his wrath upon all the people
[1:37:06] now if you could really understand that
[1:37:08] God doesn't want to pour His wrath out
[1:37:10] upon you
[1:37:13] have you ever just wondered why God
[1:37:15] opened your eyes about a prophet in this
[1:37:17] age
[1:37:18] allowed you to come into the message of
[1:37:21] the hour and just wholly believe it
[1:37:24] it's a sign to you
[1:37:26] God doesn't want to pour His wrath upon
[1:37:28] you
[1:37:30] and you say Amen
[1:37:32] so we we find a man by that prophet's
[1:37:36] message brother Brown says God separated
[1:37:39] his people from the unbelieving world
[1:37:41] and from the coming Judgment of that day
[1:37:45] see the prophet's message separated them
[1:37:47] another place he said he sent them his
[1:37:50] prophet and they separated themselves
[1:37:52] from unbelief that's the kind that come
[1:37:55] out that's the kind that believed it
[1:37:57] they believed Moses's message it's not
[1:38:00] just saying I believe it but it's
[1:38:02] actually coming out amen and that shows
[1:38:05] you believe the message
[1:38:08] they didn't wander up in Egypt they and
[1:38:10] so when the darkness came they weren't
[1:38:13] there
[1:38:14] when when the plagues come they weren't
[1:38:17] there
[1:38:19] they believe the message of the hour
[1:38:22] now in the eyes of pharaoh
[1:38:25] Moses was a fanatic
[1:38:27] Moses was a magician
[1:38:30] just just a a a hypocrite you know
[1:38:34] that's what brother Britton said Pharaoh
[1:38:35] looked at him as as something terrible
[1:38:38] but to the people that was elected that
[1:38:41] come out according to God's word I'll
[1:38:43] bring them out he was a prophet to them
[1:38:46] he was God's provided way for them
[1:38:50] laughs
[1:38:51] how do you look at the prophet
[1:38:55] amen that's why we don't we don't we
[1:38:58] don't go around well this is Brother
[1:39:00] Brown's opinion and this is this and
[1:39:01] this is this for for me it's God's
[1:39:04] provided way
[1:39:06] I've been in the mess of confusion
[1:39:08] I've been in the place I didn't know who
[1:39:10] to believe and what to believe and
[1:39:12] everybody pulling me one way or the
[1:39:14] other amen and and and and so gullible
[1:39:16] that you'd you'd go this way and you'd
[1:39:18] get burnt go that way and you still
[1:39:19] don't know you're just all confused and
[1:39:21] everything else but now I believe that
[1:39:24] God gave me a provided way
[1:39:27] that's through the prophet of this hour
[1:39:29] and you say man so it was through the
[1:39:32] ministry of Noah that God made
[1:39:34] preparations it was through the ministry
[1:39:35] of Moses that God made preparation
[1:39:38] through the ministry of Moses god
[1:39:40] prepared the people amen for the March
[1:39:42] to the land of promise and brother Brown
[1:39:45] says see what was it omnipotence spoke
[1:39:49] the miraculous took place amen it was
[1:39:52] through the ministry of Joshua that God
[1:39:55] prepared amen Joshua was a prophet you
[1:39:57] know amen and and through that Ministry
[1:40:00] God prepared the people to come over
[1:40:02] into the promised land it was through
[1:40:05] the ministry of the Prophet Elijah that
[1:40:08] God prepared the elect and turned their
[1:40:11] hearts back to a living God
[1:40:13] and you say man and how did he do it he
[1:40:16] repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:40:21] yes sir and the Lord answered by fire
[1:40:23] and consumed the sacrifice consumed this
[1:40:27] the altar consumed the water it consumed
[1:40:30] it all and that that fire amen was not a
[1:40:33] literal fire it was a holy fire Pillar
[1:40:36] of Fire can you say amen and by that God
[1:40:40] prepared the people and turned them back
[1:40:45] Elijah didn't keep the people on
[1:40:47] idolatry but he brought them out by
[1:40:49] repairing the altar of the Lord
[1:40:51] it was through the ministry of John the
[1:40:53] Baptist that God prepared the heart of
[1:40:55] the people
[1:40:56] a man to receive the coming of Jesus
[1:41:00] now we're living in a time of Exodus as
[1:41:03] we all know we're living in a in the day
[1:41:05] when God's Wrath is going to be poured
[1:41:07] out we're living at what the Bible calls
[1:41:10] the ends of the Earth amen we're living
[1:41:14] in the day of the greatest deception
[1:41:15] ever to come to the Earth we are living
[1:41:18] also in the day when the lamb has come
[1:41:21] to claim what he has redeemed aren't you
[1:41:24] glad for that now church we ought to we
[1:41:26] ought to we ought to give God glory due
[1:41:28] to the fact that we know that the lamb
[1:41:30] has opened the book and why he opened
[1:41:33] that book was to reclaim those names
[1:41:35] that he had written before the
[1:41:36] foundation of the world that you would
[1:41:38] not be left Amen in the in the Wrath
[1:41:41] that is to come
[1:41:44] it's a time of rapture
[1:41:46] it's a time for the body change it's a
[1:41:49] time for death to lose its power it's a
[1:41:52] time for sickness to lose its power it's
[1:41:54] a time for corruption to lose its hold
[1:41:56] can you say man and and for that to
[1:41:59] happen God had to send a prophet to show
[1:42:02] us a provided way
[1:42:07] notice what brother Branham here in
[1:42:10] praying he said may your spirit fall
[1:42:13] upon us the and anoint the word to our
[1:42:15] heart
[1:42:17] say that again may your spirit fall upon
[1:42:20] us and anoint the word to our heart why
[1:42:23] that we might go from here this evening
[1:42:25] better people than we are now
[1:42:28] two that we might have a closer Insight
[1:42:31] on Jesus Christ Grant it Lord that we
[1:42:34] might three understand the day that
[1:42:37] we're living in and the preparation of
[1:42:39] God for his people in this hour
[1:42:42] don't just look at it as God said on the
[1:42:44] prophet look at it at his God's
[1:42:46] preparation for this hour
[1:42:49] can you say Amen this message is a
[1:42:52] preparation
[1:42:54] yeah
[1:42:56] I wished I had time to preach and I
[1:42:58] wished I was just a preacher I could
[1:42:59] just preach
[1:43:00] it's a time for preparation
[1:43:03] why because God had you he saw you
[1:43:06] before the world began and this
[1:43:08] preparation is to take you back for you
[1:43:10] before you your first mind Battle Before
[1:43:12] The Devil and first was able to lay his
[1:43:15] hands upon you amen and before you
[1:43:17] breathe your first breath as a sinner
[1:43:19] God had already had plans for you and
[1:43:22] now he's come to prepare you for them
[1:43:25] plans
[1:43:26] this message that our ought to show you
[1:43:28] and give you hope that God never gave up
[1:43:30] on you man gives up on you man will say
[1:43:32] the devil will tell you you cross the
[1:43:34] line but if your heart is beating up
[1:43:36] this message and saying God I need you
[1:43:38] more there's a preparation made for you
[1:43:46] what we need him to do is his Spirit
[1:43:48] Fall Upon Us anoint the word to our
[1:43:50] heart
[1:43:52] amen
[1:43:54] that we might understand the preparation
[1:43:57] of God for his people
[1:44:00] for the past several years
[1:44:03] we have been living in the hour of
[1:44:05] preparation
[1:44:07] god brother Branham said in another
[1:44:10] prayer he said Lord we believe that
[1:44:12] you're you're preparing your people
[1:44:17] uh uh to believe all things
[1:44:20] we're living in the hour
[1:44:22] where you're preparing the people to
[1:44:25] believe all things
[1:44:27] he's preparing
[1:44:29] amen
[1:44:30] and well here it is I didn't know I'd
[1:44:33] put it but he says our heavenly father I
[1:44:35] thank thee tonight because that we're
[1:44:36] living in the hour of preparation
[1:44:38] we're living when you're preparing the
[1:44:40] people to believe all things we believe
[1:44:42] that's the message of the day the
[1:44:44] preparation time
[1:44:46] right the message is here to prepare you
[1:44:52] you know why the devil fights you so
[1:44:54] hard and tell you you're gonna miss the
[1:44:55] Rapture ain't he stupid
[1:44:58] you're you're living your smack dab
[1:45:01] living in in in in in God's preparation
[1:45:05] for you
[1:45:06] if you was in a Baptist I could
[1:45:08] understand that if you was in a
[1:45:09] Pentecostal I could understand that even
[1:45:11] if he was Apostolic I could understand
[1:45:12] that
[1:45:14] stand there
[1:45:17] hour
[1:45:19] there's no better way to be prepared for
[1:45:21] a Rapture there's no better way to get
[1:45:24] rapturing Faith there's no other way to
[1:45:27] you can't miss the Rapture if you'll
[1:45:30] accept the message of the hour and look
[1:45:32] at it as your way out of here
[1:45:36] you ought to look at it as you're way
[1:45:38] out here no wonder the devil fights our
[1:45:39] young people
[1:45:41] man but you ain't he ain't gonna win
[1:45:46] he ain't winning
[1:45:49] you believe that
[1:45:52] yeah
[1:45:54] he says you're calling the people and
[1:45:56] giving them the Holy Ghost and now
[1:45:58] you're trying to call out that group out
[1:46:01] of that group of sons to adopt them
[1:46:04] see so the preparation is not for you to
[1:46:06] go to church I mean all the other
[1:46:08] denominations they'll make you where you
[1:46:09] go Church they reform you they get you
[1:46:12] to make a confession
[1:46:14] we're beyond that
[1:46:17] and then then they try to get in the
[1:46:19] Holy Ghost and all that and then then
[1:46:21] brother Brown says they they think that
[1:46:23] once you get the Holy Ghost it's over
[1:46:25] you can settle down
[1:46:27] but for for for a real true message
[1:46:31] believer this message ain't gonna let
[1:46:33] you settle down
[1:46:36] that's the problem with the churches
[1:46:37] today they just sit and get formal and
[1:46:40] die they don't know why they're message
[1:46:42] believer they don't know what they're
[1:46:43] doing and and the devil uses them to try
[1:46:46] to make us a denomination and make us
[1:46:48] known better than that
[1:46:50] but I'm telling you this message will
[1:46:53] not let a True Believer settle down
[1:46:55] you may have gotten the Holy Ghost but
[1:46:57] the message will tell you there's more
[1:46:58] for you can you say man we will never be
[1:47:02] satisfied until we come into His
[1:47:04] presence a totally changed the
[1:47:07] individual and come back to being the
[1:47:09] original father of God the way God saw
[1:47:11] us to be
[1:47:13] you could have the adoption look at
[1:47:14] brother Branham even I mean he he was
[1:47:16] there and spoke squirrels into existence
[1:47:18] and all that and that's fine amen but
[1:47:21] there was still something groaning
[1:47:22] why because he was doing all of that in
[1:47:25] this whole body of Flesh full of aches
[1:47:27] and the pains and all that but that's
[1:47:29] not God's intention for us that's not
[1:47:31] God's Eternal thoughts for us we're to
[1:47:33] live in a body where death has no hold
[1:47:35] on us a body of no sickness a body of no
[1:47:38] pain of no travail a man to where there
[1:47:40] be just Everlasting joy and peace amen
[1:47:44] and worship
[1:47:47] so this message is preparing it's called
[1:47:51] you out
[1:47:54] Revelations 19 7 let us be glad and
[1:47:56] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:47:59] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:48:01] what
[1:48:02] his wife
[1:48:04] not his sidekick
[1:48:07] beloved wife
[1:48:10] who is bone of his bone who come from
[1:48:13] him she has made herself ready
[1:48:17] ain't that right
[1:48:19] notice how did she do it and to her was
[1:48:21] granted given
[1:48:23] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:48:26] clean and white for the LA fine linen is
[1:48:28] the righteousness of the Saints now
[1:48:30] brother Brown says we know that though
[1:48:32] that those that are going to make up the
[1:48:34] bride is going to be his church and
[1:48:36] they're going to appear before him
[1:48:38] without spotter wrinkle and they have
[1:48:40] everybody say they have the material on
[1:48:44] earth now to make themselves ready
[1:48:48] you have the material what material amen
[1:48:51] the word of God
[1:48:53] the message of the hour it's only God's
[1:48:56] provided way to where you won't appear
[1:48:58] before God Amen in in a naked condition
[1:49:01] amen but you'll be clothed in the
[1:49:04] garments of his righteousness
[1:49:07] and it's been provided to you by the
[1:49:09] message of this hour
[1:49:12] that's what I believe
[1:49:15] how did God prepare the people for the
[1:49:17] Exodus first Exodus brother Brown said
[1:49:20] first
[1:49:21] he sent a prophet
[1:49:23] with a sign which was Moses
[1:49:26] so what was the sign Moses was the sign
[1:49:30] amen
[1:49:32] and the sign to us is the prophet of
[1:49:34] Malachi 4.
[1:49:36] so many people missed the sign
[1:49:40] sure they do
[1:49:42] and then he says and the son had a
[1:49:44] message
[1:49:45] and the message was to get ready they
[1:49:48] were going out to the land that was
[1:49:49] promised
[1:49:51] then he had identification of this
[1:49:54] Prophet that a light
[1:49:56] same light
[1:49:57] was over the top of him
[1:50:00] knows how to say things without just
[1:50:02] really coming out and saying it right
[1:50:05] a pill or fire followed this Prophet we
[1:50:08] know that went through the Wilderness
[1:50:10] with Moses
[1:50:12] we realize that
[1:50:14] and then he gave them the people a token
[1:50:19] for the assurance that they wouldn't
[1:50:21] have to be scared all upset and nervous
[1:50:23] where he said when I see that token I'll
[1:50:25] pass over you now fear is all in the
[1:50:28] land today
[1:50:29] the Bible says men's Hearts failing them
[1:50:31] for fear but God sent us a prophet
[1:50:33] aren't you glad for that
[1:50:35] God sent us a token aren't you glad for
[1:50:37] that amen how did it happen by way of a
[1:50:40] prophet to show us the real token that
[1:50:43] death was coming so that you wouldn't
[1:50:45] have to be scared you wouldn't have to
[1:50:47] be all trembly and shaky and and
[1:50:50] worrying about this and worrying about
[1:50:52] fat and worrying about your children and
[1:50:53] worrying about this and all of that you
[1:50:55] got a token to apply with your prayer
[1:51:00] see so he says see the identification of
[1:51:03] the messenger a token for the assurance
[1:51:04] that the way was paid
[1:51:07] they are headed for the promised land
[1:51:09] the same thing he has done today what
[1:51:11] did he do he sent us the Holy Ghost the
[1:51:14] Holy Ghost is the messenger and the
[1:51:16] scriptural identification of himself
[1:51:18] identifies him Among Us the same
[1:51:20] yesterday today and forever and the
[1:51:22] token is the Assurance what are we
[1:51:24] scared about
[1:51:25] Our Fair is already paid and we are
[1:51:28] identified with our sacrifice he cannot
[1:51:31] turn you down
[1:51:34] he promised it we're identified
[1:51:39] see Israel coming out of Egypt as I said
[1:51:42] is like the bride coming out of the
[1:51:43] church when Moses began his ministry
[1:51:46] Israel all gathered together in Goshen
[1:51:48] for prayer and worship exactly come from
[1:51:51] all parts of the of of the of Egypt
[1:51:53] that's the bright the way the bride will
[1:51:55] do it'll come out of all the Oneness
[1:51:57] twoness threateness and all other other
[1:52:00] kinds it'll come out and we've done that
[1:52:02] see we've now the first thing we must
[1:52:05] think of is come from All Parts come out
[1:52:07] from amongst belief see now the Holy
[1:52:10] Spirit promised to call back in the last
[1:52:13] days come out from among the unbelievers
[1:52:19] ain't that right
[1:52:22] so in the end time message
[1:52:26] and I'll start winding it down but in
[1:52:29] the end time message
[1:52:30] uh or the message in time evangelism
[1:52:34] brother Brown said the end time message
[1:52:36] is to get the bride ready
[1:52:38] and prepared for the rapture
[1:52:42] aren't you glad there's a Ministry of a
[1:52:43] prophet
[1:52:45] so in the message Paradox 61 brother
[1:52:49] Brandon gave us the reason as to why we
[1:52:51] see the handwriting on the wall today
[1:52:54] he said God has prepared his church
[1:52:57] he's prepared his people he's prepared
[1:53:00] his place
[1:53:01] and they're waiting for him to come
[1:53:04] and that's why
[1:53:06] he says the handwriting is on the wall
[1:53:09] what is it it's a sign that judgment is
[1:53:11] here now coming
[1:53:13] it's a sign that Mercy is lifting it's a
[1:53:16] sign that Grace is about done
[1:53:20] hello
[1:53:23] now this bride what are we seeing her as
[1:53:25] a finished product she is a word bride
[1:53:28] not a denominational bride a word bride
[1:53:31] and see now now and and now listen to me
[1:53:35] and you can agree or not but this is
[1:53:37] where I am with it the Bible without a
[1:53:39] prophet could not produce a word bride
[1:53:44] the Bible without a prophet could not
[1:53:48] produce a word bride
[1:53:50] we've had the Bible for years and years
[1:53:53] how many agreed to that
[1:53:55] from the Bible we've had two extreme
[1:53:58] doctrines
[1:54:00] in in the ages and that is calvinistic
[1:54:04] teaching
[1:54:06] and uh which calvinistic teaching the
[1:54:10] prophet said came from the Bible
[1:54:13] they leaned hard on predestination hard
[1:54:17] on predestination and they took it out
[1:54:19] so far out in the left field
[1:54:22] to where they didn't even believe in
[1:54:23] revivals no more
[1:54:25] they they they you know but yet brother
[1:54:28] Brown said predestination is a good
[1:54:30] thing and is biblical it was used in the
[1:54:33] days of the martyrs because they
[1:54:34] certainly believed it ain't that right
[1:54:37] and then by the time that
[1:54:41] John Wesley came on the scene
[1:54:44] they had taken this calvinistic Doctrine
[1:54:47] so to the extreme
[1:54:49] that they didn't even represent
[1:54:51] Christians in Christianity and and all
[1:54:55] that so God
[1:54:56] sent John Wesley to preach the other
[1:54:59] Doctrine and that was armenianism
[1:55:03] so to bring a balance to Calvinism and
[1:55:07] you say man
[1:55:08] now brother Brahman said Armenian
[1:55:10] teaching comes from the Bible just as
[1:55:13] well as calvinist did
[1:55:15] ain't that right but notice what he says
[1:55:18] now it's got so far away talking about
[1:55:21] Armenian Doctrine it's got so far away
[1:55:24] from the the word now to the legalist
[1:55:27] ideas the legalist teaching in the
[1:55:29] church
[1:55:31] so what we have to contend with now now
[1:55:34] that we contend with is you've got one
[1:55:36] side that is calvinistic in their
[1:55:39] teaching and the other one that is
[1:55:40] Armenian in their teaching and they're
[1:55:43] they're both extremes this way and that
[1:55:46] way
[1:55:48] can you say Amen
[1:55:49] and it's funny that both of these arrive
[1:55:52] or it got their Source from the Bible
[1:55:55] they're they're actually founded from
[1:55:57] Biblical
[1:55:59] teachings scripturally ain't that right
[1:56:02] and yet the calvinist teaching and the
[1:56:05] Armenian teaching contradicts so so much
[1:56:08] with one another they're like night and
[1:56:10] day
[1:56:12] and yet they both have scriptures to
[1:56:15] stand on the prophet says they both run
[1:56:17] out and ride on limbs broke off Made
[1:56:19] issues now notice what he says because I
[1:56:23] think this is important God just brought
[1:56:25] the whole thing back and stuck it in the
[1:56:29] book of Ephesians and straightened it
[1:56:31] out
[1:56:32] yeah
[1:56:34] yeah sir
[1:56:37] he takes he takes both sides
[1:56:40] and puts it all back into balance
[1:56:44] in the book of Ephesians
[1:56:48] can you say man and straightens it out
[1:56:50] notice so it's where we're at
[1:56:55] one runs this way one runs this way one
[1:56:58] runs radical this way one runs radical
[1:57:01] that way that's the way the church is
[1:57:04] always gone
[1:57:06] now but if you will know this and I'm
[1:57:09] talking about preparation of the of the
[1:57:11] Bride
[1:57:12] if you'll notice the book of Ephesians
[1:57:16] is addressed to those that are in Christ
[1:57:21] Jesus
[1:57:24] the Saints
[1:57:25] can you say man brother Brown said see
[1:57:28] it's addressed to the faithful in Christ
[1:57:30] the ones that Paul had preached to and
[1:57:34] brought up matured with the gospel
[1:57:39] how did they mature under Paul's
[1:57:42] Ministry
[1:57:43] and how does this elect mature under
[1:57:46] brother branham's Ministry
[1:57:49] that's what brother Graham said we're
[1:57:50] laying right in the in the presence of
[1:57:52] the son
[1:57:54] it's the rising of the Sun and he ties
[1:57:57] his ministry to that Rising
[1:58:00] ain't that right now again brother
[1:58:03] Branham I believe in Paradox he says I
[1:58:05] think that we are living in the
[1:58:08] Ephesians again
[1:58:10] what is he talking about to wear that we
[1:58:13] don't have to run out on this limb and
[1:58:16] run out on that limb and run out into
[1:58:18] this left it's over you cannot do that
[1:58:21] and be a word bride
[1:58:23] a lot of doctrines come from the word
[1:58:27] but they're so far out of balance
[1:58:30] I think we're living in the Ephesians
[1:58:32] again back again we are promised that
[1:58:35] what was left off during those Seven
[1:58:37] Ages
[1:58:38] now he says you cannot add it nothing to
[1:58:41] the book nor take it nothing from it
[1:58:43] Revelations 22 18 says so who who will
[1:58:46] ever uh will add one word take one word
[1:58:49] his part will be taken from the book of
[1:58:50] life now we cannot add or take so
[1:58:53] therefore we know that Luther could not
[1:58:55] get to it Wesley and so forth the
[1:58:58] reformers knocks Finney Calvin so now on
[1:59:01] down so forth they didn't get it all but
[1:59:04] what they had was the Gospel truth but
[1:59:07] now everybody say now in the last days
[1:59:10] we are giving the understanding by the
[1:59:14] word that we are going to understand it
[1:59:17] because it'll come and efficientates to
[1:59:20] it and we're here
[1:59:22] so see we are a bride that is being
[1:59:25] prepared for the rapture we are being a
[1:59:29] bride a man being prepared to go back to
[1:59:33] the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:59:36] original thoughts of God
[1:59:39] so with that where do we stand as the
[1:59:42] bride of Christ we are back
[1:59:45] we are back to where the word Has Its
[1:59:49] Right balance
[1:59:50] everybody say it has its right balance
[1:59:53] it has its right balance now the bride
[1:59:55] of Christ is a word bride do you believe
[1:59:57] that
[1:59:58] okay so she's a word bride but she is
[2:00:01] not made up of calvinistic teaching
[2:00:05] she is not made up of Armenian teaching
[2:00:09] that's not what makes the word bride so
[2:00:11] you can sit under a calvinistic teaching
[2:00:13] amen calvinist calvinist calvinist teach
[2:00:15] and ain't going to make a word bride you
[2:00:18] can sit under armenianism holy holy holy
[2:00:21] holy a sin not this this this this and
[2:00:24] ain't going to make a word bride
[2:00:26] can you say Amen she is a word Bride
[2:00:30] made up by the perfect word
[2:00:34] can you say Amen now what is the perfect
[2:00:37] word it's a balanced word everybody say
[2:00:39] it's a balanced word
[2:00:41] and it's produced a balanced bride
[2:00:46] aren't you glad for the ministry
[2:00:48] God's Ministry the perfect word is a
[2:00:51] balanced word and has produced a
[2:00:53] balanced bride amen see so it's a
[2:00:56] balanced word that is restoring the
[2:00:59] bride back to the original thoughts of
[2:01:02] God
[2:01:03] amen
[2:01:06] if it was calvinistic teaching God
[2:01:07] witness sent a prophet if if it was if
[2:01:09] it was it was Armenian teaching
[2:01:12] legalistic teaching God witnessing a
[2:01:13] prophet
[2:01:15] can you say Amen
[2:01:17] that's right see so this bride has
[2:01:20] become the manifested thoughts of God by
[2:01:23] the perfect word which is a balanced
[2:01:26] word
[2:01:27] now brother Branham Likens the word
[2:01:31] with the message of the hour
[2:01:34] to that of a prescription that the
[2:01:37] doctor gives his patient so to make them
[2:01:39] well
[2:01:41] the prescription has to be balanced
[2:01:45] or it'll kill the patient
[2:01:48] brother Bram said see people don't like
[2:01:50] to take the doctor's prescription
[2:01:52] if he's got a remedy that'll cure your
[2:01:54] sickness
[2:01:55] and you refuse to take it it ain't the
[2:01:58] doctor's fault that you die
[2:02:03] and and I'll say it this way it's not
[2:02:05] it's not the it's not God's fault it's
[2:02:07] not the prophet's fault that people miss
[2:02:09] the rapture
[2:02:13] see it's your fault because you refuse
[2:02:15] to take it now if the doctor writes a
[2:02:17] prescription and you take that
[2:02:19] prescription to a quiet druggist and he
[2:02:22] put something in there that ought and be
[2:02:24] in there it'll kill you
[2:02:26] that doctor has studied that till he
[2:02:29] knows that there's so much of that
[2:02:31] prescription that's poison
[2:02:34] right
[2:02:38] to kill them bugs that's in your body
[2:02:43] there's enough Armenian in it
[2:02:47] to kill the sin
[2:02:51] and there's enough antidote
[2:02:54] in there enough Calvinism
[2:02:57] in there to upset the poison that it
[2:03:00] won't kill you
[2:03:02] right come on now now that's me putting
[2:03:05] that in there
[2:03:06] there's enough antidote
[2:03:09] let's put in there that the poison won't
[2:03:11] kill you
[2:03:12] the Poison's in there just enough
[2:03:15] to kill it out
[2:03:18] because the doctor wants to make you
[2:03:19] well
[2:03:21] the prophet of God will not send a
[2:03:23] message that kills the people
[2:03:26] it's the legalist that comes in the
[2:03:28] church with them and under the messes
[2:03:30] that won't re that refuses to come under
[2:03:32] the headship
[2:03:34] they kill the people
[2:03:37] it's the Calvinists that come in and and
[2:03:40] and and and come under and won't
[2:03:41] surrender to the the headship of the
[2:03:43] message and they that message message
[2:03:45] but they take the Calvinism amen and
[2:03:48] destroy the church
[2:03:51] to where there's nothing left
[2:03:54] Holiness is gone the dresses are coming
[2:03:56] up shorter
[2:03:59] hello
[2:04:05] so there's enough antidote in there to
[2:04:08] upset the poison that it won't kill you
[2:04:10] it's got to be level
[2:04:13] if you put too much antidote it won't
[2:04:15] help the man the patient put too much
[2:04:17] poison it'll kill the patients it's got
[2:04:20] to be balanced
[2:04:23] [Music]
[2:04:24] well so is it the words got to be
[2:04:26] balanced so how many believes the
[2:04:27] prophet brought a balanced word
[2:04:29] a balanced word brother Andrew preached
[2:04:31] two powerful sermons last Sunday and
[2:04:33] while he was preaching he said let the
[2:04:35] word do the correcting and I I really
[2:04:37] like that amen but what he was saying is
[2:04:40] let the balanced word everybody say the
[2:04:42] balanced word let the balanced word do
[2:04:44] the correcting
[2:04:48] why because it's God that is making a
[2:04:52] bride
[2:04:54] through the ministry
[2:04:56] God is going to shape a bride and
[2:04:58] prepare her
[2:05:01] and you say Amen you you don't want a
[2:05:03] you don't want a calvinist to take the
[2:05:05] word and to do the correcting
[2:05:07] you don't want a legalist Armenian to
[2:05:10] take the word and do the correcting
[2:05:12] look where you end up
[2:05:14] ain't that right
[2:05:16] so when we study what the prophet taught
[2:05:18] and how he lived he went against the
[2:05:21] grain of both calvinist and Armenian
[2:05:25] he went against the grain of all of them
[2:05:29] can you say Amen
[2:05:30] see so now then we find out then when a
[2:05:34] calvinist takes the word and he starts
[2:05:36] doing the correct and you know what he
[2:05:37] always ends up doing he always ends up
[2:05:39] correcting the prophet
[2:05:42] when the Armenian takes the word and
[2:05:44] starts doing the correct and what does
[2:05:46] he always do he'll end up always
[2:05:48] correcting the prophet
[2:05:50] because the prophet never lined up all
[2:05:52] the way with Armenian teaching and he
[2:05:54] didn't line up well all the way with
[2:05:56] calvinist teaching
[2:05:58] he had a balance in what he brought
[2:06:03] because the prophet taught in the loud
[2:06:06] things in his church and whom that both
[2:06:09] disagree with
[2:06:10] so therefore
[2:06:13] you get them doing the correct and
[2:06:14] taking that word and doing the
[2:06:15] correcting
[2:06:17] and the prophet's going to be among them
[2:06:18] all
[2:06:20] of being corrected
[2:06:21] they make brother Branham out to be a
[2:06:23] hypocrite they basically say he couldn't
[2:06:25] live what he preached they make it
[2:06:27] though that he didn't have the
[2:06:28] capability to lead the his own family
[2:06:31] they insinuate that brother Branham was
[2:06:33] an idolater because of the things he
[2:06:35] allowed in his home
[2:06:37] they have all of these reasons as to why
[2:06:41] brother Branham didn't comply with the
[2:06:43] way they see things
[2:06:47] now
[2:06:49] I think I think we can all agree that
[2:06:53] brother branham's message was
[2:06:56] the Fulfillment of Revelations 18 4 come
[2:06:59] out of her my people
[2:07:00] help me agree with that I mean that that
[2:07:03] is total brother Branham says that right
[2:07:05] 18 4. come out of her my people well
[2:07:08] this heard that we are called to come
[2:07:10] out of what is she she's the
[2:07:14] and her daughters are harlots it's the
[2:07:17] Catholic church it's the denominational
[2:07:19] system do you believe that brother
[2:07:21] Branham says now listen now brother
[2:07:23] Brown says the Bible calls the Catholic
[2:07:25] Church a and calls the Protestant
[2:07:27] Church harlots said that the was
[2:07:30] the mother of harlots and that and and
[2:07:32] that is people that's an ill-famed woman
[2:07:36] who doesn't live true to her marriage
[2:07:37] vows and we all claim to be the bride of
[2:07:40] Christ and yet so untrue what would make
[2:07:42] the intrus by living everybody say by
[2:07:45] living contrary living contrary not just
[2:07:48] preaching contrary living contrary to
[2:07:51] the discipline that God has laid out for
[2:07:54] his bride to live by he said that's my
[2:07:56] own opinion the Bible and it is the
[2:07:59] infallible word of God I believe ain't
[2:08:01] that right so see being entwined with
[2:08:04] the and the Harlot uh Protestant
[2:08:06] daughters calls to us to live contrary
[2:08:10] Amen to the discipline that God has laid
[2:08:13] out for his wife to live by so brother
[2:08:16] Branham in in calling us out he just
[2:08:19] didn't tell us well the Catholics are
[2:08:21] wrong the Catholics are wrong
[2:08:22] denominations are wrong Protestant all
[2:08:25] this Creed and dog that's wrong but he
[2:08:27] taught us a new way of living
[2:08:30] yeah
[2:08:31] do you believe that so that our lives
[2:08:34] wouldn't be so entwined in the Harlot
[2:08:36] system to where we become harlots
[2:08:39] ourself
[2:08:40] in our own living to where our homes
[2:08:43] ain't patterned after the Harlot system
[2:08:45] that that that that that it's not our
[2:08:48] churches ain't patterned after a man the
[2:08:51] Catholic system and the denominations in
[2:08:53] this age not only did he tell us it's
[2:08:56] wrong but he gave us a new way of living
[2:09:01] ain't that right brother Branham
[2:09:04] see he says this way he says life is
[2:09:07] what controls us we are known hereby say
[2:09:10] we are known by the life we live
[2:09:13] not really by the sermon you live by the
[2:09:15] life you live
[2:09:17] and yet say it been said that your life
[2:09:19] speaks so loud that I can't hear your
[2:09:21] testimony so therefore to live a sermon
[2:09:23] would be much better than to preach one
[2:09:26] so you cannot tell me that God would
[2:09:29] send a prophet to preach a Divine
[2:09:30] message and the man couldn't live it
[2:09:33] it ain't so
[2:09:34] when a prophet says it's better to live
[2:09:36] one than to preach one you knew that he
[2:09:38] knew how to live it
[2:09:40] just as much
[2:09:41] if he told us to us men that we ought to
[2:09:44] run our families and live our families
[2:09:46] and and control our homes and all that
[2:09:48] then you can you you good and well know
[2:09:50] that he knew how to do such
[2:09:52] can you say Amen why because if he was
[2:09:55] going to bring us out of the Harlot
[2:09:57] system he had to come out of that Harlot
[2:09:59] system
[2:10:03] so the life you live shows what
[2:10:05] character you are because your life
[2:10:07] always builds your character
[2:10:10] so of course what do they do they want
[2:10:12] to attack the character
[2:10:14] his life
[2:10:16] now Jesus said by the fruit you shall
[2:10:18] know them
[2:10:19] so no matter what we would say now
[2:10:22] listen to this now no matter what we
[2:10:24] would say and how much we would testify
[2:10:27] if our lives doesn't coincide with that
[2:10:29] testimony we are doing the kingdom of
[2:10:31] God and indebtment by giving that
[2:10:34] testimony because people know what we
[2:10:37] are
[2:10:38] so did brother was brother Branham an
[2:10:41] indentment to the message that he
[2:10:42] preached because he couldn't live what
[2:10:44] he preached
[2:10:46] far be it for me to judge a prophet
[2:10:53] first Peter 2 5 tells us that we are
[2:10:56] Lively stones
[2:10:58] well brother Brown says what good does a
[2:11:00] stone do if you haven't got a stone
[2:11:02] Mason there with a sharp word to cut
[2:11:05] that stone into a place stone for the
[2:11:07] building
[2:11:08] what good does it do to make decisions
[2:11:11] if you still let the women and the man
[2:11:13] remain as they were and just join the
[2:11:16] church it's a pile of stones that's not
[2:11:19] shaped into nothing what we need is a
[2:11:22] stone Mason a man with the word of God a
[2:11:25] Vindicated power to prove that God sent
[2:11:28] him to shape that church and to cut off
[2:11:31] the worldly things and shape them into
[2:11:34] the stones of the Sons and Daughters of
[2:11:36] God that go into his building now Church
[2:11:40] we're not looking for a stone Mason God
[2:11:42] is sitting one to us and is Vindicated
[2:11:44] his message and his life
[2:11:51] not just to come out but to place Us in
[2:11:54] the body
[2:11:55] preparing us can you say man
[2:11:58] so if he's going to do that if he's
[2:12:00] going to shape us
[2:12:02] If the message if if God is going to
[2:12:04] take that man and to shape us then he's
[2:12:07] got to be delivered first of all
[2:12:10] cannot tell me that he's sitting there
[2:12:12] bound
[2:12:14] can't get away from these traditions and
[2:12:17] all of these things
[2:12:22] brother brannerman speaking of Moses
[2:12:25] said he was completely in the hands of
[2:12:26] God totally delivered from sheep herding
[2:12:28] to hurt God's sheep and I'm hurrying he
[2:12:31] was delivered himself but the people
[2:12:33] wasn't delivered because there was still
[2:12:34] murmuring among them
[2:12:36] can you say man I think when we get
[2:12:39] really delivered we'll accept the
[2:12:41] message as it is
[2:12:43] just accept it
[2:12:45] I don't have to explain it don't have to
[2:12:47] argue with it don't have to do nothing
[2:12:48] just accept it the way God sent it
[2:12:51] can you say Amen
[2:12:52] now
[2:12:54] I'm going to say this and I'll let you
[2:12:55] go
[2:12:56] but if he gave us an explanation as to
[2:12:58] why he did things and allowed things
[2:13:00] then let's stay with that explanation
[2:13:04] and I'm gonna bring this now
[2:13:07] but brother Branham said this he said I
[2:13:10] want to take this time to express each
[2:13:12] and every one of you how I am grateful
[2:13:15] to you for your Christmas cards and
[2:13:17] gifts and things that was received at
[2:13:18] our house
[2:13:20] I certainly thank you with all of my
[2:13:22] heart it certainly did US good this
[2:13:24] morning
[2:13:24] he said I got a little boy small enough
[2:13:26] yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and
[2:13:28] we had it in the room
[2:13:31] that's an explanation
[2:13:33] as to why he had it
[2:13:36] right
[2:13:37] so what what I'm saying is we don't need
[2:13:39] another explanation
[2:13:41] brother Branham explained it right there
[2:13:43] he gave us the reason he gave us the
[2:13:45] explanation I can't understand
[2:13:46] everything that he said but I just know
[2:13:48] that this is the explanation that I'm
[2:13:50] going to stick with it's on tape
[2:13:53] so I'm gonna say what brother Bram says
[2:13:55] this is the explanation right so then we
[2:13:59] we find that I'm we're we're this so now
[2:14:03] if his children were like mine
[2:14:06] and yours
[2:14:08] if they were anything like me
[2:14:11] when I was a kid
[2:14:12] mom and dad didn't allow TVs
[2:14:16] if it was my personal preference I would
[2:14:19] have had one
[2:14:23] I know that surprises you your children
[2:14:26] probably never did
[2:14:28] but I did
[2:14:30] and I would have taken it in a heartbeat
[2:14:32] if my dad would have said John you on
[2:14:34] television sure
[2:14:36] do it
[2:14:40] and if you just take notice of your
[2:14:42] little kid it's
[2:14:44] most the time since they ain't got one
[2:14:47] in the home
[2:14:48] you go to a restaurant
[2:14:51] and they're glued
[2:14:52] to the television
[2:14:54] we if we ever got a chance
[2:14:59] we would ask Dad when we went to Grandpa
[2:15:01] and Grandma's of course uh grandma
[2:15:04] always they had a television and dad
[2:15:06] would always tell us now you children
[2:15:08] don't ask me to watch television yes sir
[2:15:12] so we went to Grandma
[2:15:17] could you ask dad
[2:15:20] and don't tell him just ask him if he
[2:15:22] wants to stick around we could watch
[2:15:24] Charlie Chan or something
[2:15:28] we we knew how to do it
[2:15:31] Kmart was up the road from from Grandpa
[2:15:35] and Grandma
[2:15:36] back then kids could walk without being
[2:15:38] scared of
[2:15:39] so we had always asked Dad you know and
[2:15:41] US cousins all of us wanted me can we go
[2:15:44] up to Walmart or KMart look around sure
[2:15:47] okay
[2:15:48] every time you'd find us right there in
[2:15:51] the TV section
[2:15:53] all the Martin kids lined up
[2:15:59] we didn't hear the dinner bell
[2:16:02] we didn't hear nothing
[2:16:06] so now I'm saying all of this because
[2:16:08] I'm sure brother branham's children was
[2:16:10] just the same way
[2:16:14] but you know what brother Brown said
[2:16:18] I'll never have one of my own
[2:16:20] and if I had one I'd get a shotgun and
[2:16:24] blow it out the window
[2:16:25] door whatever
[2:16:27] you see they're part of the layout of
[2:16:29] cnh and all of this layout to see his
[2:16:31] stuff was coming in
[2:16:35] but because they had them desires
[2:16:39] broad Brown says no you're not going to
[2:16:40] do that I'm not going to have it in my
[2:16:42] home
[2:16:43] right but he did allow a Christmas tree
[2:16:46] not because they were laodicea
[2:16:48] not because of he was immature not
[2:16:51] because he couldn't live the message
[2:16:53] but because he had a little boy
[2:16:54] five-year-old boy at wanted one
[2:16:57] that's what he said just stay with the
[2:16:59] explanation
[2:17:00] you don't have to like it you don't have
[2:17:03] to want one
[2:17:04] I'm not pushing it on you to want one
[2:17:08] just don't explain any other give any
[2:17:10] other explanation than what he gave
[2:17:14] can you say man
[2:17:16] it's a balanced word
[2:17:19] so brother Brown said see we rent from a
[2:17:21] woman that has the television or home I
[2:17:23] never intend to have one in my house I
[2:17:25] don't want that thing in my house even
[2:17:27] though his children having that
[2:17:28] unconverted desires being in laodicea
[2:17:31] wanted one but he says I'll never have
[2:17:34] it in my home
[2:17:36] I'd blow it out with a shotgun because I
[2:17:38] don't want nothing to do with that evil
[2:17:40] thing
[2:17:40] ain't that right so lay ought to see her
[2:17:43] or not that thing wasn't coming in his
[2:17:45] home
[2:17:45] also remember on tape that brother
[2:17:48] Branham talks about his unconverted
[2:17:50] daughter Rebecca remember that she
[2:17:52] wanted to play that Boogie Woogie
[2:17:55] and he says you ain't playing it at my
[2:17:57] home
[2:17:58] right so what did he do what did she do
[2:18:00] she goes to the neighbor's house that
[2:18:03] has a piano so she can play the Boogie
[2:18:04] Woogie
[2:18:06] that unconverted girl having them lay
[2:18:08] Odyssey I mean come on now Boogie Woogie
[2:18:10] was coming into this layout of cnh
[2:18:13] and she had all that in her to want to
[2:18:16] play but he says you ain't playing that
[2:18:18] in this home
[2:18:19] ain't that right
[2:18:21] okay
[2:18:23] see so now brother Branham says this the
[2:18:25] true Prophet stands with the true word
[2:18:28] and doesn't compromise on it anyway in
[2:18:31] on it in any way ain't that right so
[2:18:34] either brother Branham said this he was
[2:18:36] either the true word Prophet or he
[2:18:37] wasn't
[2:18:40] if the musicians will come
[2:18:43] brother Branham in this day
[2:18:46] where he says this he said in the day
[2:18:49] that we're living in in a nation where
[2:18:51] it's been gleaned over and over and over
[2:18:54] and over by all kinds of everything well
[2:18:57] it's hard to get people to really just
[2:19:00] grasp it talk about the message
[2:19:02] like it is in a Virgin Territory you
[2:19:05] tell them they believe it and that's the
[2:19:07] way it goes on
[2:19:08] but now one will come along with this
[2:19:11] idea and one will come along with this
[2:19:12] idea and we got about it 900 and
[2:19:15] something different denominational
[2:19:16] churches and each one contrary see his
[2:19:19] teaching to the other there's got to be
[2:19:21] somebody wrong and somebody right
[2:19:24] so now the only proof of it is is bring
[2:19:27] it back to the Bible and let the Bible
[2:19:30] see now many times people put their own
[2:19:33] interpretation but we tried the very
[2:19:36] best that we can not to put any human
[2:19:39] interpretation to it just read it like
[2:19:42] it is and say that's the way it is then
[2:19:45] I've always noticed if you just take
[2:19:47] what he says it'll make everything
[2:19:48] dovetail just exactly right in the
[2:19:51] scripture it's almost like putting a
[2:19:53] jigsaw puzzle together you have to look
[2:19:56] at the pattern before you can get the
[2:19:58] puzzle right together right if you don't
[2:20:00] I've always said you'll have in your
[2:20:03] scene you'll you'll have a cow picking
[2:20:05] grass on the top of a tree it just
[2:20:07] wouldn't look right
[2:20:09] so brother Branham did not have the cowl
[2:20:11] on top of the tree
[2:20:14] he had the picture just right
[2:20:15] [Music]
[2:20:17] and when God comes
[2:20:19] everyone that has truly taken this
[2:20:22] message to heart and believed it with
[2:20:24] everything that's within them the scene
[2:20:27] is going to be the most beautiful thing
[2:20:28] because it'll be what God had in his
[2:20:31] mind it'll be the manifestation of his
[2:20:33] thoughts right there
[2:20:36] do you love the Lord
[2:20:37] for this message has come to prepare us
