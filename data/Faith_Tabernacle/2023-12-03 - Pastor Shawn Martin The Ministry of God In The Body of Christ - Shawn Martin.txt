hallelujah what an opportunity a privilege it is to be able to come into His presence amen and to to think that we couldn't come unless he bid us to come that as the Bible says blessed is he whom thou choosest and CES Amen to come unto thee amen and we're so glad to be part of that group that people and we should never let that uh become common to us but should always be aware of him um constantly praise the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and certainly enjoyed the songs and the specials and amen and just glad to be in the house of the Lord and uh it's good to have um brother Josiah back and Little David with us and hate to hear that the girls are sick but uh we just be praying for them and um and uh those that were gone and um over the weekend some still gone on I guess and but um just good to be back in the house of the Lord uh the book of Ephesians the fourth chapter praise the Lord and good to see sister Alice doing better amen and uh good to have Sister Mariah back amen and skner the other day he said did y'all move but uh they're still around so amen but we do miss them when they're gone and um so um the Lord's been good to us amen um Ephesians the 4th chapter and I'm going to start at the first verse it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness and with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling amen then if you'll turn with me to First Corinthians the 12th chapter amen Corinthians chapter 12 and um going to read there the 12th verse it says for as the body is one and hath many members and um and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ then the 28th verse um or the 27th verse I should say now you are the body of Christ and members in particular amen let's bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly it is good just to Know You Lord Lord not just to hear of you and know of you but to know you in a personal intimate way and Lord as we understand the position that we're in as your people father we've been under great expectation for you to come Among Us and Lord uh just to meet with us and we're just asking that you would feel at home now and that you would uh Minister your word to us and father anything that is lacking in our lives we pray that you would convict us Lord over the things that would be wrong and disagreeable to your word and we would ask Lord that things that are needed in our lives that you would Supply it father for we realize Lord that we ain't got much time left and you're coming after a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish you're coming for a bride Lord that is matured in your word and father that's our heart's desire Lord so we pray that you would have your way now anoint both speaker and hearer in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to continue on our subject the ministry of God in the body of Christ and um of course Ministry uh in involves us all in one way or another and uh and it's the agency by which God fulfills or accomplishes his purpose his will and the word of God is his will and that's uh something important for us is to know and to understand is the word of God being his will that is why we're here is to accomplish what he wants brother brandom said God wants to fulfill his word and he don't have any hands but mine and yours he don't have any eyes but mine and yours he has no tongue but mine and yours I am the vine you are the branches the branches bear the fruit the vine energizes the branch so the body is energized by the spirit of God brother brandham another place he energizes us and we bring forth his life as he brings it through us whether it's preaching the gospel by lip or it's seeing Vision by eye or whatever uh or whether it's whatever it is laying hands on the sick where whatever it is it's Christ working through the branches of his church or members of his body see every office literally everybody say literally every office literally electrified by his presence now that's everyone that's in the body is El terrified by his presence that that just blows my mind because to be part of the members of his body and his life coming in that body electrifying us quickening us it's in the it's it's for his purpose God made man for the purpose of achieving and and throughout time uh man has always tried to achieve he's full of goals he's full of vision he's full of motives he's full of ambition a man that don't have ambition something wrong uh and and but he was designed to achieve uh so this is why he would be full of ambition and things and but but the problem is is man has has tried to achieve it on his own he he wanted to do it within himself and the prophet said that's where he makes his mistake is he leaves God out of the picture when he does that and and so and and and so this is what happened in the beginning uh and uh and what caused the fall and and it continues to happen and and and so it it it uh uh you know after the fall man and uh Adam and Eve it wasn't too long that we read where man had had just become so ambitious he was achieving he was but but in in his achievement he polluted the Earth and and so much so that God repented it it it grieved God that he would even make man and and because uh man had gotten in such a condition uh uh and and God uh finally uh determined to destroy the the the Earth destroy man and but but see man Man was created in the image of God and he was made in the image of God and so God give him that Dominion not just to sit here on Earth without achieving anything but he gave him something whereby he could achieve and and and and so he was given dominion and authority over the earth and the prophet said he was made to do something for God it it wasn't that man was just left alone for his own Ambitions he was made to do something for God and and so but he when he lost his fellowship with God and then the prophet said he then became a unit of his own without God so he makes his cities he makes his technology all the inventions and yet it's without God and and and again uh it's it's just coming to to uh um well it's becoming a mess is what it is and so man he didn't depend on God anymore wanted to think on himself and then then what does man do he began to have selfish motives he still had motives he still had agenda he still had purposes he still had goals but they became selfish he became selfish so selfish motives selfish desires selfish Vision selfish motiv selfish everything and and and so when well then then what happens is man is a failure in himself to begin with right without God we nothing and and that's what Jesus said without me you can do nothing and and and he wasn't saying that you're just become a zombie amen but he said it without me no matter how religious you are you'll never be able to come and arrive to what what I've made you to be without me you you'll never come to eternal life uh yes they're trying to look young they're trying to sustain life but you'll never be able to do it without him they've been trying to make a millennium but they'll never be able to do it without him they they've been trying forever amen to reconcile man with God it'll never happen without him can you say man so man is a failure to begin with and and so we can see all all throughout the Bible that without God man is a failure look at David for for example when he did God a service outside of God's Will and what happened he failed in in what he done he should have consulted God but he had this great idea good idea and he was actually going to do God a service and and yet it was out side of God's will consider Moses when he tried on his own to deliver God's people he found out that he was a he was a failure he was called to deliver he was called to do it but he done it outside of God's help and when he done it he become a failure and see so what makes us a failure is when we do things outside of God's will then then we become failures and and it it even may be achievements that we consider great but if God doesn't consider it great if God doesn't see it as something if it's not according to God's will then we're failures to begin with you understand what I'm saying amen this is why people live so they they find themselves successful if they have their name that the world looks to if if they they they they become the NBA uh basketball star you know or the football star if they win the Super Bowl and they're the one that led it or they were part of that they consider that success but when it comes all down to it it's not success without God you know and and Men strive for money and money money money money and then they put God on the back burner they put everything about God on the back burner now they're rich and they're driving these nice cars and nice homes nice clothes and they think they've achieved something well in this world they may have but God would consider it a failure it ain't going to get you nowhere in the end so you know it it what really it makes us a failure when we're not in the will of God now man turned to all of his strengths the prophet said and his power over the selfish desire years and achievements so so when he left God and and through the fall amen then then he turned all of his strengths all of his Ambitions all over all all of his powers everything that he was over to selfish desires and achievements amen and so in in the days of Noah uh uh God said you know the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the Earth amen see well then you know then man comes back through uh uh on the other side of the flood and then they start it all over again and then we read about Sodom and gomorah and and and in the days of lot amen the Bible says the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly and and there in Genesis 24 or 1924 then the Lord reigned upon Sodom and upon go gamarra and brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the city uh and that which grew up on the ground then in the 27th verse he says and Abraham get up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace God destroyed it all they they had become ambitious in them own selves and before you know it so perverted that that they that men were sleeping with men women with women and even when the two angels went down uh uh the men tried to grab the uh uh them angels to have sex acts and and all of that it it was such a feel and and notice brother brandham says all the time these things are going on the spirit of the Living God is driving with flesh trying to get man away from his own achievements trying to get man away from his own selfish motives and objectives to a plan which God has laid down see to a plan that God has laid down and as long as man Works in his own plan he will be a failure you understand that young people you you young couples just starting out and and these things as long as you work in your own plan you're a failure that's is true see man can only achieve right when he comes back with the right objective and the right motive and that is according to God's plan for him can you say amen amen that's why marriages are failing homes are falling apart the the world is falling apart and all of that because it's not built upon God's plan for their lives and so now in this day Jesus prophesied that there would be a day just like in the days of Noah and just like in the days of lot and and we know we know that beyond the shadow of we're living in that day how many believes that amen we're living in that day amen and and so uh as which means as God destroyed uh uh the world in Noah's day and as God uh destroyed Sodom and gamarra in lot's day amen he he's going to he's going to destroy the world in this day except this time there will be a total Annihilation uh uh uh in other words the sin would be totally gone with the the wickedness will be totally annihilated the devil The Sinner the a his angels and all of that he's God's going to totally annihilate uh the sickness and diseases and germs and and uh the thistles and all that and there's going to be a complete renovation can you say Amen a complete renovation of the heavens and the Earth amen the Bible says old things will pass away and all things will become new so this isn't going to be just like like the flood and then wickedness starts After the flood and and it ain't going to be like Sodom and gomor and then we have a repeat as we are today of what Sodom and Gomorrah there'll be no other repeat again it'll be a new eeden a restored Eden and there will be no sin no sickness no sorrow no loneliness no heartbreak there will be no tempter Amen to deal with like Adam and Eve did think of that am praise the Lord he'll be gone God's going to restore his Eden but before this happens before this happens and we know we're right in the milliseconds of time then then God uh uh has has come in this day to claim a group of people that he himself has redeemed amen now you think of the power of that Redemption so much is the Power that God never looks at that group of people as Sinners again once they're baptized in the body of Christ once they're sealed in he never considers them a sinner never looks at you brother Bill as a sinner again hallelu Lord that's why you must look in the word as a mirror and not just your regular mirror and don't let the devil show you the mirror of your past there is no past under the blood so we find that God predestinated this people though to fulfill his word yes something that he failed to do something that Adam fail to do God has now ordained Us in this day to fulfill his word in this age but in order to do this he had to redeem this group of people and I'm saying us here this morning and people around this world Universal amen that he had to redeem us in order to bring us into fellowship with him come back to being united with him come back to a dependency on him come back to True motives true Ambitions to where all of our strength is not uh uh uh uh uh directed to a selfish motives but to God's motive God's will everything about us is consumed to do his will now this group of people he wrote their names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he promised to take out a people take a people out of the Gentiles for his name and they are to be his bride and as we know that it's in this day that they bear the name Miss Jesus Christ now think of that and so brother brandom talks about it uh there has been churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides but there has got to come one now he knew you coming he knew it he knew this message would produce you you know some i' I've heard that you know some parents say that their children need to go out in the world and all that to really experience the grace of God what hog was what a lie of the devil I think it's powerful that God could take young people that have never experienced these things amen and they're a product of the message of the hour they don't have to go be Baptist to experience the preciousness of this message they they don't have to go to the Pentecost like I did we raised in the Pentecostal era amen and and traditions and all that to appreciate the message of the hour you can appreciate the fact that God called you not to be part of that and and you don't have to go through all the junk and detox and all of these things but you can take the message of the hour and find it really precious in your in in your heart there has to come one Hallelujah says there has to come a real bride a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it this ministry is not about mechanics it's Dynam Dynamics mechanics and Dynamics coming together and he says see it makes the church makes that church live move in the power of his resurrection did you realize the prophet called this bride the bride coming of Christ can you say that with me the bride coming of Christ that's the truth think of that she's not just a little bride she's the bride coming of Christ people talking about Christ coming you might ought to look all right cuz he'll he's never promised he's never promised that his Corporal body his physical body will will come to the Earth and and and and and talk with us like now he he promised though that we would meet him in the air now I know people don't believe even in that but the Bible says it now somehow they say brother brandham uh changed all that I don't believe that no I believe these these so-called intellectual preachers have changed it you ain't going to find that in the word of God now I don't know how that's going to happen I don't know where I don't know how the Bible says we're going to meet him in the air can you say Amen so it ain't up to me to figure it out it's just up to me to believe it ain't that right but and until he does the son of man is revealed on the Earth right now and he is the same in every way same in Attitude same in desire same in motive same in power same in everything but his physical body who is it it's his bride he is living in his bride and is the bride coming of Christ can you say Amen amen I love it now we being predestinated are the members of the body of Christ so brother Braham says he has sent forth his holy spirit remember the prophet said in the Feast of trumpets that for 2,000 years the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers but is to be loosed in the evening time by the evening time messenger so he has sent forth his holy SP Spirit to continue his ministry in the church until he returns in a physical body ain't that right see so he's not going to reveal himself to the world as everybody thinks he's going to be the traditional thought of the Rapture is the the literal graves are going to open literally there's going to be holes all in the earth people's going to stop what they're doing and they're all going to look and seem that's not the way it's going to be now he promised to reveal himself to the Jews [Music] right the Lord that's right but you know what he's revealing himself right now revealing himself right now you're the only Bible that people will ever read you're the only God that people will ever see you are the body of Jesus Jesus Christ you are his bride there is a literal uh reality to that statement the bride coming of Christ that is true so he sent forth his holy spirit to continue his ministry in the church until he returns in a physical body notice again what the prophet says if the Church of the Living God is Not achieving what God purposed for them to do there's something wrong with that system somewhere it's just got to be all right come on now if the Church of the Living God is Not achieving what God purposed for them to do now we've read this before but brother Brown said Christ set the members in the body he endows them with their Ministries he puts the gifts at her disposal preaching is a gift healing is a gift singing is a gift music playing music is a gift speaking in tongues is a gift prophesying is a gift so brother Bram says they are all Ministry they are ministries of their own and notice here's the real key each man is commanded to wait everybody say to wait on his own Ministry amen again each man is commanded to wait on his own Ministry now is this not what happened to Eve didn't she could not wait hello God told them to replenish multiply and replenish the Earth that's right God had a plan for this to happen is that right she was Mary done what Eve was supposed to do be it unto me according to Thy word sir it was to be by Spoken Word but Eve could not wait Amen brother Bram said it was an oncoming thing it was a promise but Adam's bride couldn't wait see when Adam come to his wife she was pregnant she had done something she was pregnant with the corrupt seed from the serpent amen she was pregnated with the wrong seed amen through the wrong act can you amen every man is to wait commanded to wait on his own Ministry the Lord Proverbs 18:16 says a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before Great Men in ain't that right so your gift makes room for you you don't have to make it happen you don't have to force it you don't have to be jealous because God's using somebody else your gift will make room for youlu and you will fit the gift that's true amen see so every member inside the Body of Christ that's part of the body is commanded to wait sometimes I I wonder what motivates some of these young ministers that wants to be full-time evangelists and you know they they'll go quit their jobs you know and and before you know it then they get jealous because God's using someone else another young man and wondering why they can't be that you got to be wait you got to wait for your gift God may have not called you to be that he may have called you to be a minister but he may have not called you to be full-time evangelist but sometimes you wonder what the motive is you you wonder what motivates these young men to want to be pastors when they can't sit under one you understand what I'm saying see God sets gifts in the body and even though Moses was trained even though Moses was told for since a young man a young child child that he was to be called to be the leader to deliver the people he had to wait on the gift ain't that right amen he made a mess of himself did he not see so God sets these gifts in the body it's it's kind of like we could take this room here and and as as though it's the body of Christ and you come into this come in and and then you see what what what's in in the room there's pews that are in the room that's a gift there there's a Pulpit for me to put my Bible and that's a gift there there's the Pian that we could worship with that that's a gift the drums are a gift the organ get to our base gifts right God God's put gifts right in in the church we got sound system gifts to some and and and we got the projectors and now we don't have to have s books or gifts we got pictures I I consider these gifts valuable gifts he and and and they're gifts right so the prophet say see but by one Spirit we can't just act now we can all come in here that's fine anyone's welcome to come in here as long as they behave themselves and be a brother but but but you not just anybody can come into the body they have to be elected called blessed is the man whom thou choosest Ain ain't that right and and the only way you can come into the body is by being baptized by one one Spirit there ain't no other doors into this into the body you have to come in by one Spirit into one body it's a spiritual baptism can you say amen and then when when we come into the body by that one Spirit we are subject to any gift that's what the prophet said to any of these gifts the nine spiritual gifts amen and these things see but now don't make the gift all about the Christian Life right can you say Amen because you got to remember not only did Rebecca receive gifts but her family received gifts true the only deal with Rebecca she got the bridegroom amen Rebecca was called for the bridegroom the family wasn't even though they all got gifts that's true ain't that right see so you know Martin Luther the prophet said Martin Luther was so filled with the Holy Ghost till he spoke in tongues but in his diary he said if I taught that to the people they'll seek the gift instead of The Giver yeah yeah that's what Martin Luther felt now if we were part of the Corinthian Church then I'm sure brother Brandon would have felt the same we can't do this because they're Corinthians they're babies now he considered the Pentecostals babies what did they do just as the Corinthian Church went after the gifts centered on the gifts focused on the gifts instead of The Giver ain't that right but we are not the Corinthian Church we are the Ephesian Church am can you say Amen what was the Ephesians Paul would place them positionally Joshua would place them positionally in the land no one trying to take another one's place no one being jealous of another guy hello brother brand how you even get on to these businessmen trying to take the place of the preacher right felt like they were better they can run a business but you don't run a church like you do a business that's right ain't that right so Joshua could place the people in the promised land which was the second part of redemption so did God with send our Joshua this end time lead the Holy Ghost working through a prophet amen hello so this message is to place Us in the body didn't do away with gifts didn't take the pictures out of the body didn't take the pews out could you imagine we still wanting to have church but we take the pews out we take the pulpit out we take the music out we take the sound system out we take this everything out thank God for Windows but now we don't need them anymore take them out we take everything out then what do we have just the building nothing to work with but God placed gifts in the body can you say Amen because in that body there is a Ministry amen ain't that right yeah so in us being that we are an Ephesian Church we're not going after gifts we're going after The Giver can you say Amen we realize that gifts do not make a man spiritual the prophet said you can actually send your soul to hell with a Divine gift right ain't that right yes sir now we know that there are Ministries that operate outside the body of Christ there are people who are not in the body of Christ and and you know they they they operate genuine gifts sure not even filled with the Holy Ghost if you're not in the body you're not filled with the Holy Ghost yes and you sayen and yet they're operating genuine gifts Judah Judas was a a example of that balum was an example of that can you say men and and many others in the Bible so brother Bram said we know everybody say we know that in the last days there's going to be a Revival of Supernatural That's not going to be of God there's going to be a Revival of the Supernatural That's not not everybody say it's not going to be of God that's true that doesn't mean that the devil is going to work the supernatural hello amen for Jesus told us how it's going to happen the the father make in heaven maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust ain't that right the same rain that falls on your crop that you planted is the same rain that fall falls upon the concrete that falls upon the W the the thorns and the Fizzles is the same rain that could not just causes your crop of corn your crop of beans or whatever to grow it also causes the the the weeds to grow that you have to keep plucking out to keep your garden [Music] clean hello that's right now Matthew 7 and22 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity they they prophesied in his name they cast out devils in his name they they done Miracles and signs in his name and used that as a great resume come on now and the Lord didn't say oh you are something else I didn't even know you existed in there no I'm so glad no not God no he says depart from me never knew you in other words I never had intimate relationship with you that's right I never induced you with my power I never filled you hello that's right had gifts so the rain comes from the same Source but it falls on two different seeds amen now notice the difference between the two seeds brother Bri said man has gifts and things but watch everybody say but watch but watch so what do we watch watch what's behind it Satan can't impersonate anything almost he is an impersonator he can impersonate but watch the kind of a voice that it is okay what's it saying what's it leading you to what's it pointing to amen and you say Amen see so God has set gifts in his body in his body in his church for the work of the ministry and these gifts in that body are under a headship amen ain't that right so the the ministry is under the headship Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body the church and what is he the word the word Vindicated the Vindicated word the manifested word is the head of the body praise the Lord come on now amen so we're controlled by one head do you believe that not two heads to a body right said be a freak body so notice now you are baptized in the domain of that Kingdom one spiritual baptism Lord no matter how good how bad whatever you're in that Kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism and you say Amen so so now that you're into this body you been baptized into the body you're under his domain Lord so I looked up I looked up domain it means complete and absolute ownership of of of land a territory over which Dominion is exercised so now gifts he put gifts in the body he placed you in the body by a spiritual baptism now the gift and you you and your ministry is under his domain you now become his territory you now become under his the control of his influence the Lord can you say Amen so now uh uh it's the territory in in which his Dominion is exercised that that's what it is so brother Brown says see God sits on the throne of your heart in his not yours his control room amen controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love what a people he's coming forlu and God fills you with love he fills you with power he fills you with the spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ can you say Amen see so when a man is trying to understand the Bible or the message uh by an intellectual conception he cannot believe it all he just can't because he's he's going by intellectual and so so somewhere he he's going to start reasoning it away well I I don't really know about that let let let problems come really hard now we can believe God for simple things but when it really comes impossible I mean impossible then if we're not careful we'll go to intellect and start reasoning well I don't see how that can happen I I I because you well of course you know I remember the last time someone got prayed for for cancer they died and all of a sudden you start reasoning yes sir in just instead of taking God at his word hello and if you get to reasoning too long if you're a minister you'll start bypassing that stuff you won't preach the power of God in it's all its reality cuz how you going to explain if someone dies of cancer and yet you're telling that God will answer prayers God heals God does all all these things and if you're not careful you start leaning to your own reasonings and your own intellects hello come on right but God's going to get a people that will actually be under his domain and under his control that simply takes God at his word you don't have to explain anything just believe it amen can you say Amen am so Satan controls the intellectual part of man therefore he will cause the person to reason with the word when he cannot understand it because as the prophet said he's looking at the word intellectually you may not be able to understand this word all always and actually if you just brother Brown plainly tells us you cannot read this Bible like you would a newspaper anyone has to when you really read this Bible you have to read between the lines you have to read in the spirit that it was given that's well that's the same thing about the message you have to understand the message in between the lines I know people picking this message apart but shoot that ain't nothing new it's the same old devil that's used people to try to pick this Bible apart they pick the Bible apart so it's automatically they're going to pick this message apart right well it's true that's right they say it was all written by man there ain't nothing about that inspired well then they say well the brother BR was just a man there ain't nothing about inspired come on now see it's carnal Minds intellectual Minds trying to reason with the message of the hour well well good grief we've already had a prophet tell us you don't understand it that way you got to fall in love with the author to understand this Bible you got to fall in love with God to even understand the message of the hour and you understand the message under by The Same Spirit that the prophet gave it he was under inspiration and your your understanding must be under that same inspiration yeah the prophet said this and well then you go over here and and it contradicts or you go in the Bible and it makes it look like the prophet contradicted the Bible no it's you contradicting the Bible it's you making the prophet and the Bible contradict one another if you're not careful you'll make Matthew Luke and John contradicting one another it's the same intellectual devil right Hallelujah so we cannot when you look at the word of God intellectually you cannot achieve things for God that way brother Braham said but let that same man take what little knowledge he has in his head and give it over to God and let the spirit of the Living God come down into that heart of his he'll call every word of God the truth and every promise Divine then everybody say then then he can achieve for God then he can achieve for God see God gave us his word God gave us the message God and and and and don't tell me amen and try to dissect the the the Bible from the message I say they're all one it was given by prophets it was written by prophets and so has this message been given by the most Vindicated Prophet there ever was on the face of the Earth so to try to separate and see which one is the better one come on now nonsense amen can you say amen he gave it to us that a man when a man woman boy or girl can truly believe it then he can cheve for God he can achieve for God see so God made a little compartment in each of our heart for himself that's his control room where he sits and controls Us Praise the Lord Brother brah said that's his place that's where he sends his messages from the control room how can he work with you notice the question now how can he work with you when the nature of the spirit of the devil is in there see if you're baptized in the in into the body then that spirit is gone prise the Lord that that that that's that's the important thing and that's why Satan tries to get everybody to bypass the spiritual birth is is because when when he comes in the devil leaves can you say amen and now God comes into that soul and that's his control tower not to control everybody else you can't help what everybody else does I can't that's that's that's why you know un unless you know just feel like the Lord just leads me to go some direction we ain't going to just blast people because you can't control them come on God has to set in that control tower right so he says every man born on Earth is born in sin shape and iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's right so in that carnal adamic nature how can a man achieve anything only by through his intellectuals and he's achieving a lot but he's a failure right everything that man does is going to fall so in the body you are baptized by one Spirit now you are his territory for the kingdom of God is within you I hope this okay can you say Amen if you haven't been baptized in the body you'll not be part of his domain now what is the kingdom of God brother Braham said his word made Power can you say that with me his word made Power his word that was here his word that was in the in the form of of of a message on tape and books and all that now has become made Power in you amen see the kingdoms in you the prophet says and when the word comes in there what does this word began it turns itself into Power making it say just exactly what it said you don't have to try to make it happen it turn turns itself into Power making it do and say exactly what it said it's not up to you to fulfill this word just be part of the body and you say Amen now see you can't say it says this and then it says this and make it work see you got to say the same thing it says that makes a confession not saying well it's polished up a little over here so I'll have some more wisdom I'll be better and better standing over here you stay with the word there it is see and it makes it power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever can you say amen amen all right so John 14:12 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do and the father that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it what is that it's word do you believe that you believe it's the word or do you believe that someone just injected that in the Bible like I told you I was talking to that man that that didn't believe in Mark 11:23 he said somebody injected that that's that's uninspired but see if a man can believe it from his heart God having the control tower it makes that word turn into Power can you say Amen see John 15:7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you why you are baptized into his domain ain't that right so brother Bram said what is it you've got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have receive the Holy Ghost but we have just received enough holy ghost in us to make us uh uh to to a place place where we don't want to lie don't want to steal we don't want to do anything see but God wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking he wants to feel your mind he wants to feel every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself and to your thinking just so surrender in God till his word is just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life my words are life Jesus said he's placed with them teachers believing the Bible prophets that say the truth that say see show me the same prophecy that they've always did down through the age see or show they show the same prophecy what what's he done he's showing himself alive among them confirming his word see it's his word the kingdom of God is God's word made Power aren't you glad for that amen the kingdom of God the prophet said is made word and spirit in our own life Hallelujah ain't that right Lord so it brings to pass every promise every promise in this day as it did when the word and God was one in that day in Jesus's day ain't that right so now notice the word in God is one everybody say it's one one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed you know the prophet said there is not one hypocrite in the body of Christ there might be Hypocrites in Faith Tabernacle there might be Hypocrites in any church but in the body of Christ there's not one hypocrite amen every member of that body is pure unadulterated Sons and Daughters of God they believe his word from Genesis to Revelations and they stay with it Trials come but they stay with it torments come but they stay with it testings come but they stay with it failures come but they stay with it people come people go but they stay with it can you say Amen discouragements come but they stay with it see God tries you on every level but he knows you'll stay with it because you're part of his body talking about Proving Grounds he brings you to impossible situations but he knows you'll stay with the word there's your part of his body amen you love him amen notice brother Braham said and their life proves it that's true and God confirms his word to it and he says that's the Messiah the Lord that's the wife of Messiah see and God sets in that system teachers pastors prophets and so forth to keep that messiahship of is straight in there right that's why we keep preaching the promises of God hello that's why we stay with the message we study the message we study this word amen I ain't interested in what Charles Spurgeon has say he was fine in his day but he was you know did you know he was a smoked the cigars could you imagine taking that I know you get quiet on that but take the message any day can you say Amen so he says see that's the message that's the wife of Messiah and God sits in that system teachers pastors prophets and so forth to keep that messiahship of his straight in there see not not mixed up with denominational Creeds but weeds that thing out and keeps the church pure un adulterated to Christ and his word that's right amen aren't you glad for it that's why you should respect the men of God hello that's why I've always said if you can't have confidence in your pastor go find a pastor somewhere that you can follow amen cuz you know people say well you don't help me well if you'd respect the office brother BR says brother BR said pastor can't help you if you don't respect him so if you ain't getting help maybe you ought to change the attitude I'm not saying that's for anybody here but I'm just saying it's just true I'd say that to any church amen God puts that Ministry in there and it's not just the pastor god brother Terry brother Josiah brother brother Daniel brother Amos brother Andrew God puts them here in the church and when they're when they're preaching you you got to respect them things and and and as I've told these young men these young Brothers don't don't expect just because you're a preacher to get up here and just expect people to receive you live a life live something that the people can value ain't that right see so in the body think of that God has set teachers prophets pastors evangelists and so forth to keep that messiahship of his Strait Amen in the body amen now as I have said you know there are genu wine gifts that are operated by people who are outside of the body and and these people do not even have the Holy Ghost and which means that they're not under the domain of God they're not his territory and so this is why Jesus would tell us Matthew 24:23 breaking in If any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and and so we we can go to to balum again again who who was a false prophet he was a prophet like like Moses was Moses was a prophet in the same time as Moses there was balum but balum was false in that it wasn't his prophecy he prophesied and and and and the prophecy still coming to pass his prophecy was true but the prophet said his teaching was false that's what made him a false prophet yes sir I you know I mean you you got you got people saying all you know claiming to see Angels Kenneth Hagen was one of them that that that said he saw an angel come into his room I ain't going to dispute that I don't doubt that a bit but his teaching was false it was just plain as day false Joseph Smith the beginning of the Mormons said an angel came to him I don't doubt that a bit but but his teaching was false you understand what I'm saying see so so balum he he saw the angel he saw an angel too is donkey had to tell him that there was an angel there true amen just occurred to me you know women say they got to preach because men don't men don't ain't ain't fulfilling their job well both balam wouldn't listen to to God either but he didn't raise a woman he began to speak through the donkey so God don't change his mind if he if he has to bring a donkey or a monkey or a turkey or whatever he'll still speak his word but it won't be by a woman so so God spoke to the Donkey amen but notice his teaching was wrong it was false and the Bible says he taught the king baac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel so notice now he uses his ministry uses his ministry to cast a stumbling block right before the children of Israel to God wouldn't even forgive Israel for what they done and brother bandam said he polluted the whole Camp of Israel and yet God blessed balum he said look at the balms today in the field he said just look around prospering speaking in tongues sure using God's gifts to gain everything see but it defiles the whole church of god with their corrupt teaching think about it can you say Amen come on now Jesus the Bible says had a holy ghost well the prophet said a full Holy Ghost Ministry Jesus had a full Holy Ghost Ministry so acts 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him what a Ministry he had right Matthew 10:1 though listen and when he had called unto him his 12 12 disciples he gave them power uh against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease ain't that right well you go into that second CH verse I think and and the Bible names all all of the disciples and Judas was one of them acts 1:17 in speaking of Judas said he was numbered with us and had obtained part part of this ministry he didn't have a full Holy Ghost Ministry he had part of the ministry can you say Amen see so we we find a man uh because he he uh he didn't stay with the word in Matthew 7:5 Jesus prophesied of this day and age saying beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves you shall know them by their fruits right now brother B said how do you do it you don't discern the man you don't discern the spirit of a man watch his motives watch his objectives what is he trying to do where is he trying to lead you to right amen cuz sheep don't lead sheep to slaughter it's goats that lead sheep to slaughter now in first John 4:1 we are given a warning beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits amen try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world ain't that right now brother Brown says and who is it that shall attempt to deceive the very elect why the spirit of antichrist in the false anointed ones of this last day yes ain't that right so they have come in Jesus name claiming that they have been anointed of God but the prophet said they are false Messiahs right amen notice they claim that they are prophets but the question is are they one with the word though but are they one with the word there's only only one that's going to be one of with the word and that's the body of Jesus Christ you see why the word is more important than us having gifts absolutely so he says but are they one with the word never see they have added to it or taken from it no one denies that the spirit of God see u manifesting in gifts is upon them but like balam they all have their program make their appeal for money exercise gifts but deny the word or bypass it for fear that a controversy might diminish their chances for great greater gain see yet they preach salvation and deliverance through the power of God just like Judas with the ministry imparted by Christ but because they are wrong seed consequently they have a wrong Spirit motivating them true come on now another place he says the thing of it is today we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the church doctrines in a person's heart we are commanded to establish the word of God Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I come to you in power and in manifestations of the holy ghost that your faith might rest in God Amen that's true you want to be established in God you want to be established in his power amen amen I pray that if God carries and somehow he would take me home I pray that you all as a church would just continue right on serving the lord don't argue about playing tapes of who and when and where I pray that you stay together and stay in one love I pray that you just stay right with the word stay with this message and understand that God only uses uses a man takes him off the scene but there's someone else that'll take carried the torch hello I'm not interested in you building a camper around me you know you know you hear ministers saying well now you know if I leave you know you're just to play my tapes and the message that's it that's such a lie right that that is so wrong amen we are commanded not to establish ourselves but to establish the word of God in the people now that's any any person that's part of the ministry so you you mothers if you're part of this ministry you are to establish the word of God in them children right establish the word of God you fathers in your home everything should by be directed and motivated and everything by the word of God true can you say Amen so he said man mustn't establish yourself let God do something for a person and send him out and you find every man trying to impersonate it why they're trying to establish themselves God didn't God there ain't another brother brandham coming there ain't another gift like brother brandham coming I don't care who it is there's not another man with the same [Applause] gift hello I'm going to be honest I'd love to sit with brother brandham and have an interview but I don't want no other interview with anyone else not in that way why because every other gift has got to be tried and tested no other man stood before a prophet and judged that Prophet but every other gift must be judged not nine spiritual gifts any other gift of Prophecy gift of tongues gift of interet ration of tongue gift of whatever the church is not to receive it until it's been judged tried and proven amen hello and we'll get into it more as we go but so he said see they're trying to establish themselves every man saying see I did this me I mine my denomination me see this see establishing theirselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God establish the word of God and to do that you got to take out all unbelief and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart and the kingdom of God cannot be established in a man's heart unless God made that man thus so the word of God is going to bounce off a lot of people's backs just like water bouncing off a Ducks back but when God makes a man thus am that word of God becomes preeminent in his soul and you amen praise the Lord and the man that is made thus his name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now as we get ready to wind down there are people who have their names in The Book of Life and they are religious ain't that right yeah in the Old Testament there were people who had their name in The Book of Life and the prophet said they were part of the religious order of that day that centered around the true God and worship of him they centered around the true God and worship of him and and Paul talks about it in 1 Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea were all baptized un Moses in the cloud in the sea they did all eat the same spiritual meat they did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ ain't that right so when it came to the external blessings and manifestations the prophet said they took partook of all of it in like and equal manner just like Jesus or Judas did but he didn't go all the way can you say man he didn't go all the way they didn't go all the way for verse 5 says but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness see so the prophet says when they came to Moab those who joined in the Feast of Bal Balor all died their carcasses fell in the wilderness for it was there that they refused the word of God and turned from it they P partook of all religious order they they done it you know and and partook of the religious things but when it come to the word of God they refused it and turned from it and he says there are people who seem involved in the things of God Almost 100% but they're like Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was so the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at bpor he decided that he wanted to join with the false Vine forces enter into the Financial political organization of anti- antichrist religion and he did so yeah and you say Amen in another place he said Judas was chosen of God not not in that he was elected before the foundation of the world name written in the L book of life but he was chosen to be 12 the part of the 12 disciples he was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries he had a Ministry of power granted unto him he healed the sick cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he slded out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way all right that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost Judas failed and multitudes fell amen right there can you say Amen do you love the Lord amen I love him amen stay with the word stay that word stay in the presence of God know him get to know him fall in love with him amen if the musicians will come praise the Lord I love the Lord amen I don't know if Judah got that song did you get that song I like that song that Heather sung today and um I asked her to sing it and I'd like to maybe just sing it um if you can just put the words up praise the Lord um I don't know what key what key did you sing that in oh we better go up for us all I want hell
