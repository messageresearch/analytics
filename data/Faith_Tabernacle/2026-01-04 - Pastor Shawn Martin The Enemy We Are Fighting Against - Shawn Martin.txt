And oh God, as we come before you with thanksgiving in our heart truly, you are an everpresent help in a time of trouble. Lord, you are the everpresent water from the rock. We thank you, Lord. As I was thanking this morning, listening to the seventh seal yesterday and brother Ram just kind of reiterating that during the tribulation period that the 144,000 has to be purged. a foolish virgin has to be purged because they rejected perhaps the message and the the earth has got to be partially purged during that time. But God, we're thankful that this bride because of the coming forth of the word and the opening of the word, we take our purging on this side. We take our purging now. We come to church each time, Lord, to receive uh correction in the house of God. The the house of God is a house of correction. And we're thankful, Lord, because you have sent your word to heal us and sent your word to cleanse us and sent your word to encourage us. And we're so thankful, Lord, that we have a a revelation. You put representation in our hearts so we could receive the word and be healed and touched and delivered and encouraged and all these wonderful things. We just thank you so much, dear God, that not only that you sent a prophet lest you would smite this earth with a curse, but you let us be part of it. You chose your bride, and we're so thankful for that. unworthy that we are, but we give you thanksgiving. We pray for each of these requests that's been given in. You know, each one don't have to name them. They've been already named, but we know that you're, as we said, an everpresent help in a time of need. And we thank you for the testimonies that's been given in, especially for the um Sister Hope's cousin, I believe it is, and the person across the street, dear God, and the serious uh accidents that happen. But God, we know that you still are mindful of the needs of of your children. And maybe they're just like brother Bram would pray for others and they were just a person want life a little better. And somebody prayed the prayer of faith and we're thankful for that. And each one of these requests, Lord, I pray that you meet that need. And bless our pastors. He brings the word of the Lord. May it truly be spiritual food and due season this morning as we feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man. again. Lord, thank you that you sent us a word that we might be purged on this side that we'll have that great hope, Lord, of that wonderful change of body. We love you. Thank you in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this morning. Amen. Maybe we could ask brother Doug to come and sing for us. You are the Lord, my healer. Sing it now. You are the God. Oh, you are the God that healeth me. You are the Lord, oh my healer. You've sent your word and you've healed my disease. You are the Lord, my healer. I turn around telling the branches what cord it was. That's about all the sense I've got. I like to say I sure appreciate the Lord. I've been thinking about all been through a lot of trials. You know, I want the armor on the front. Don't y'all? I don't want none on the back. All on the front. Like the grass line still beneath the flowers on the hill. Without you, Lord, you just wouldn't grow like a lost sheep astray. I'd be wondering each day without you. I'd have no place to go. And I can be on a tree with my branches. And I can build on a church with no pew. I can build on a well with no water. But Lord, I can't picture me without you. Precious Lord, be my guide. Ever walking by my side when I'm weak. Give me strength to go on in the darkness of night. Hold my hand, be my light, guide my steps till I'm safely at home. And I can build on a tree with no branches. I can build on a church with no pe. I can build on a well with no water. But Lord, I can't picture. me without you. Lord, I can't picture me without you. Amen. Did you enjoy that this morning? Amen. I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see, oh, he's been so good to me. And when I think of all he's done and where he's brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. Sister Janice comes. Well, I've got so much to thank him for. So much to praise him for. You see? always been so good to me. And when I think of all he's done and where he's brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. Mary first heard it spoken. So sacred it was inroduced by angels. But she did not know that hour just what majesty and power was contained in the name sweet preious Lord. because she knew that holy is thy name. Holy is thy name. There's no other name with a healing touch. No other name that I love as much as Jesus. Holy is thy name. Now in no other name is there salvation that's given whereby we must be saved. So in everything that I do or say, I will honor your sweet name. For those who've learned to trust you, Lord, they will never be the same. And they'll tell you, "Holy is thy name. Oh, holy is thy name. Oh, there's no other name with the healing touch. There's no other name that I love as much as Jesus. Holy is thy name. Yes, there's no other name with a healing touch. There's no other name that I love as much as Jesus. Holy is thy name. Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we invite our pastor to come? Well, I'm going to rise, rise, rise above it all.

And u still um pressing the battle &gt;&gt; and uh so we're certainly good to see her um still battling there in in her body. And so we just uh keep holding her up in our prayer. &gt;&gt; The Lord will just give her complete victory. And I believe he will. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the God that we serve. Amen. And it was good to hear Sister Janice sing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh um I know it's you know she's gone through a a battle there herself losing brother Bob and uh you know she's telling telling me just coming to church is probably the hardest thing for her because her and brother Bob was come to church for many many years together and and um so not having uh her partner there and and uh but we just Good to just see that she's pressing on. Amen. And we certainly love and appreciate Sister Janice very much. And um uh Brother Andrew asked me to greet you all today. He's um ministering uh there in Alabama, I believe. And uh so I told him I would do that. Also, I hear Ayla is sick. um not feeling well, the sickness just going around and um and so we want to keep her in our prayer as well. And I tell you, let's just go to the Lord in prayer and we're asking to to bless the word and we'll just pray for sister A as well. Father, Lord, as we come as your children, Lord, not eating the crumbs that fall off the master's table, but we have been invited to sit at your table, Lord. You have prepared it for us that we may eat of all your blessings, your promises, Father. And Lord, healing has been in your word. It's it's one of the children's bread that we could eat and partake of. And asking that you would do a miracle, Father, for uh Aya. Father, she's sitting in the car not feeling well, but Lord, would your spirit just go there and touch her and make her whole? Father, this sickness just going around everywhere. But Lord, we are believers and we don't have to to give into that and we don't have to have it. I just believe that you can protect us from these things. And Lord, we just ask that you would do it. And Lord, ask that you would bless the ministering of your word today. Lord, you see what's on my heart. And I pray that you would just help me to yield myself to you, Lord. And may it be a blessing to your people, Father, that we could be better equipped and and just reminded of of who we are and and the last days that we're living in. We love you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're going to turn um First Peter, I believe it is First Peter and the 5th chapter. Amen. And then we'll go to Ephesians the 6th chapter. But first Peter chapter 5 and we'll start at the sixth verse. It says, "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time. Casting all your care upon him for he carth for you. Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. Amen. Then if you'll go to Ephesians the 6th chapter. Amen. And um we um love the Lord today and sure a beautiful day today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians uh chapter 6 and uh we'll start at the 13th verse. Uh, wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be with a able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. Stand therefore um having your low ones gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Everybody say all. Quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there and too with all perseverance and supplication for all saints. Amen. you can have your seats this morning. And um you know, if you have uh served God for any length of time, uh then you already know that we're not in a picnic. Uh not not on a picnic, but we are um in a in a warfare. And uh you know the prophet gave us a lot of things uh revealed the word to us open the the the seals have been opened things placed uh where it should be in the word we have been placed in the word and we thank the Lord for that and &gt;&gt; but yet then he would tell us of just how troublesome times we're really in. He one place said we're sailing in troubled waters and talks about how dark it is. Tells us how demons are uh the lid of hell has been lifted off and demons are pouring in and it it it God has given us such quite information uh in this message that we we wouldn't be caught off guard by anything. uh nothing should catch us off guard today and and one thing that he uh established which it's in the Bible but and that is we are in a warfare and we know that uh and brother Brandon he he preaches messages like uh the contest and put on the whole armor of God and um um uh the greatest battle ever fought. hot and and and and certain things uh uh that he would let us know uh just that this battle is really real. &gt;&gt; And it started up in heaven between God and Satan. And Satan rebelled against uh God. And he he wanted a better kingdom. Uh thought he could make a better kingdom. And he's striving to make a better kingdom. And uh the prophet said this world uh they're they're making this world you know a better place to live in. He said really they're making it a better place to sin &gt;&gt; in. But in their idea their idea of thinking uh it's because this is Satan's kingdom but he's trying to make it a better place outside of God's way. and uh and and so this this warfare had been raging and he was able to uh draw uh angels after him and and and so then he was kicked out and of of heaven and and we see that he's here on this earth. God um uh when God made man uh you know uh the battle's still raging &gt;&gt; uh but man became the battleground uh there and and and as we know u and I pray it can make some sense today uh I'm not bringing anything new to you but a as as we know Satan cannot create never has been uh so God created his son, but Satan couldn't create. So, he had to he had to somehow pervert God's creation in order to bring his life and his son. And and so, but but the the God when he made man, he didn't make man a robot or or uh but he made man a free moral agent. And so it this would allow Satan to be able to work on man and God work on man. Um and so this is what the prophet would call uh man being the battleground. Uh the warfare between God and Satan and and man being the battleground. Satan chose man's head uh as his control tower uh his intellect reasoning. Um, God chose man's heart to be his control tower. &gt;&gt; And so what makes this a a difficult thing is us being free moral agents, then we have to decide. It's up to us to decide who are we going to let dominate us. And that's where the battle is. That's the warfare. And and if uh uh this actually requires us then to surrender. We have to surrender. We either surrender to God or we surrender to the devil. Uh Paul there in Romans says know ye not that to whom you yield your servants uh your self-s servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey. So when you yield you're only you're yielding to be a servant. You'll either yield yourself to be a servant to God or a servant to the devil. You are servants. U so uh you he says uh to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So that's what the Bible tells us. Uh now the Bible tells us what happens when when uh uh Satan has complete control over a man. Uh we also uh it also tells us and shows us what happens when God has control over a a man. And and both powers uh but one is satanic power, one is is divine power, God's power. But but yet they're both they're both powers. Um uh one man that was completely surrendered over to the devil. They couldn't he could break chains. He could he could break all kinds of things. They couldn't tame him. Uh because uh it was a he became a superman. Um a superpower. The prophet said uh because it it was not just a human strength. He had he had yielded himself over to another power. Uh and and well then we find that any man that would yield himself to God, look at the power, look at Samson. What Samson was able to do. No man could do that on his own. Not even the strongest man in the world today couldn't do that. And and Samson wasn't muscled uh up. He wasn't, you know, what we would picture Samson to be. Uh but he got his power because he surrendered un unto God's power unto God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now so this is why Paul likens us as soldiers. Uh we are uh we are soldiers and he tells us to put on the whole armor of God. If you want to be a Christian and you want God to use you, you want to be a successful Christian, you want to be one on top uh overcoming, then you you you you're a you got to fight. Can't just sit there and lay down. This is a real thing. If you want to overcome depression, if you want to overcome sickness, if you want to overcome doubt, if you want to overcome hate and bitterness, if you want to overcome whatever you're going through, you must put on the whole armor of God. Amen. Now, the prophet said, "Satan has his ang a agents out everywhere watching, spying out on God's people. God moves." See, and the enemy is sitting everywhere watching uh to see what he can do. Well, God has his agents everywhere as well. Ain't that right? And anytime that God moves or is fixing to move, Satan is there uh uh to hinder. Now, brother Brandham, in one uh place, he said, "Now, this is the last night of the service." I don't know how long the service the meeting had been, but they're at the last night of it. And and he says, "And I want each one of you to give me your undivided attention and listen close now." So, he's telling them, "Don't let your minds wander. Don't let your whatever." Amen. Stay focused. Amen. He said, "This is the last night and we're trying to go in for the greatest victory of the meeting." Amen. So, this whole meeting now, the prophet understood that we ain't just having a meeting here. This is a battle. This is a this is a warfare. There are people that need help and and so he says, "Now, this is the last night. We're going in for the greatest victory of this meeting." And he needed the cooperation of the people. Stay focused. Stay stay with us. Ain't that right? And and so he says, usually there's more people healed on the last night than there is in the rest of the meeting. Their great anticipation. This is why we don't have prayer lines at the beginning of our meeting. We have it at the end where where the ministry, the word has gone forth and and faith has been built and anticipation is high. And he said, "Now Satan fights harder. Everything goes wrong seemingly because Satan is trying to keep that people in tension and everything else so that he can keep them away from this great time of strain that we're now entering into for the great as we would say going in for the kill. So he he's letting the people know we've had great nights and all this but this is the last night and Satan is going to fight harder. This is the way he always does because he knows we're going in for the kill. And so he's going to uh uh uh uh cause havoc in um uh uh in your day. He's going to try to wreck you your day. He's going to try to get you nervous and all worked up and and all of these things. It's a battle, ain't that right? Just maybe even this morning, uh uh uh battles are raging in in in just a a little group like this here. But he says, "See, uh, we'd say going in for the kill. He's already beat up in the corner." Amen. He's been exposed. All of his devices is exposed. And men and women have accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. People with cancer and tumors and everything else has been healed. Doctor statements proving that it's the truth. Now, here sits a group of people here tonight sitting waiting under great expectation. See, and Satan, if he can interrupt your mind, that's all he has to do. But let's go in now for the great kill just now to drive Satan and all of his powers plum out of the building that God can have the right of way and heal every sick person for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so, uh, uh, so Satan is there to hinder. Amen. He's there waring, but it it takes not only a preacher, but it takes the people together to rally around and understand the battle that's taking place. But he says, if let's do this now. Let's go in for the kill. Let's stay focused. Let's stay don't don't don't don't don't get out here and don't let your mind wander and all of these things. Let's go in because people need it. Amen. and let's do it for the glory of God. Can you say amen? Amen. I just believe that. And and so uh uh as soldiers, we must prepare to train ourselves to meet this enemy of ours. Amen. Now, think of that. We must train. Now, this is a prophet saying that. Amen. That we must train or prepare ourselves to meet this enemy of ours. Don't you? You You're not just sitting here and just happy golucky and and just go blowing this way and this way wherever the way the wind blows. You're just going No, you're sitting here being trained. Trained. Ain't that right? See, and he says now he says, you know, uh talks about one of the presidents uh that says in the time of peace, prepare for war. Amen. And that's very true. See, when everything is going good and everything is just going nice for you, you should be preparing to meet the enemy. Ain't that right? Because the prophet said, "Because you're going to meet him." So, you should prepare to meet the enemy. See, while everything is running smooth, you better get ready. Ain't that right? If your if your life is going smooth right now, you better get ready. Amen. See, for Satan isn't going to let it run smooth very long. You're in a convention now. Everything will just pour along fine. But you're going to leave here in a few days and you're going to meet the enemy. He might not even wait till you get ready to leave. He might attack any time. So, he's wicked and ruthless and and and he just carries on whenever he can. Whatever he can say or do, he does it right now. So, it's best to be dressed all the time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. In other words, have have the armor on all the time. You might meet him out on the street. You might meet him in your car. Hard tell him where you're going to meet him. Or he will meet you right in the seat right there and and meet right at the pullpit here. Anywhere. See, he's just wicked. He doesn't care. So, we want to be prepared for it. Don't we don't want to be unprepared when we enter to trials. We don't want to be unprepared when Satan comes at us. Let's be prepared so we don't be caught off guard. A ain't that right? So So now he said we want to be trained. We want to be trained on how to deal with our enemy. Ain't that right? No nation sends men out to war without first training them. Amen. On how to meet their enemy. I I uh when they go out and they uh uh issue uh you know they're getting ready to make a uh invasion somewhere. Well, the men will train and train and train. They they will go out and and and they will um copy uh I don't know what that is, but God help them. If that's a if that's an alert, God help them find that person. &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so, but when they get ready to go out, maybe maybe America's getting ready to go over to overseas and and and they're they're going to take a they're they're wanting to capture. Well, they did the other day, right? They captured V and they invaded Venezuela or whatever. But they didn't just go over there and just say, "Well, let's see what happens." No, they they there there's times that and they may have done it this time, but they prepare them soldiers and and they will do mock uh uh setups and all of that and they will go and like they're really doing this thing and they're preparing for any little thing that may happen that may go wrong and and they're getting in soldiers prepared and prepared. That way when they go over they're not looking said now where do we go? What's what what what what do we do? They've already done it. Amen. And so when they get over there, everything looks familiar because they've already practiced and they practice and they practice. Amen. And that's what makes their invasion so successful is they prepare for anything that could go wrong. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They know. See, and so this is what a prophet is telling us. We must train. We must train. That way you're not caught off guard. He going to come at you in any old way. He may attack you in your body. He'll attack you in your mind. He'll attack you in your finances. He'll attack you, Amen. in in your your your uh well, he'll just attack you in any old way. And you've got to be prepared, trained on how to deal with your enemy. Can you say amen? See, because if we're not trained, the reason why we train is we we go to war uh with the purpose of defeating the enemy. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? We don't send our soldiers over there just for for fun. Uh uh to say that we sent them and and well, we sent a you know, we sent 10,000 of our soldiers over there. Boy, we showed them how good we you know, how big of an army we've got, you know. Well, what does that do when you get defeated, you know, so we go to war to win. &gt;&gt; We fight to win. Can you say amen? And I say your enemy's fighting you to win. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now you got to be trained to fight back to win. Ain't that right? Amen. Don't lay down. Just let him whoop all over you. A ain't that right? So we go to war for the purpose of conquering and defeating our enemy. The prophet said, you know, he said, you'd better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you. &gt;&gt; Now, now you either going to destroy your enemy or your enemy is going to destroy you. It ain't going to be just you walking away and he just sitting there letting you say, "Oh, nice. I'm I'm sorry. You're a fine fella. I'll go pick on somebody else." No. He's going to destroy you or you destroy him. One of the one way or the other. You You live or you die. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. See, and so our job is to destroy the enemy. Brother Brandham said, "The thing to do, to my opinion, is know your enemy. know him and train for the contest that you're going to have when you meet him because you're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to avoid him. You can't be the nicest person and and avoid him. He don't care how nice you are. You could be the quietest person in church and say, "Well, if as long as I just be quiet, he ain't going to notice me. I ain't going to say amen. I ain't going to lift my hand cuz cuz he might notice me." No, he notices you. So if he notices, you might as well just lift your hands. &gt;&gt; You might as well just get excited cuz he's already got your number &gt;&gt; and you're going to meet him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, if I don't shake everybody's hands, I won't get germs. You know, I won't get sick. See? So So let let's just all stay still. You know, you might die of pneumonia. &gt;&gt; Never know. So, so, so, uh, uh, we find you're going to meet him. So, he says, "Know him. Know what his strength is. Then train for this contest when you do meet him. &gt;&gt; For it's one thing sure, it's one thing sure you're going to meet him." So then, train. &gt;&gt; Train for the contest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't be an untrained soldier. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be trained. &gt;&gt; Good night. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So notice the prophet said, "If you want to start training, start with John 3:16, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The golden rule. Start right out with that and that'll get you on the floor. Then notice, then train for the knockout punches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're going to have to use them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, don't just go, &gt;&gt; you know, don't don't you know uh I saw, you know, uh uh one day he he his son was acting up, a little kid acting up. So he went over there and picks him up and he like that and the boy starts crying, you know, and he goes, "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that." You know, I just laughed. I thought that was really funny. But a lot of times we do that with the devil, too. You know, you know, devil bothering us, you know, and you give him a little slap and then he come, "Oh, shouldn't have done that." No, you got to not train for the knockout punches. Quit crying &gt;&gt; and train for knockout punches. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Because we're going to have to use them. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to want to get knocked out. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get to the place you start missing church &gt;&gt; over every little thing. &gt;&gt; You know, you see that song, hear that song, excuse the excuse. You hear them every day. You know, whole family had to stay home just to blow that poor kid's nose. &gt;&gt; What is it? They got knocked out. Knocked out. &gt;&gt; Well, instead of the devil knocking you out, won't you knock him out? &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, the prophet said, "You got to train for these knockout punches." &gt;&gt; They just don't come natural. You got to train for it. &gt;&gt; And then start using them. &gt;&gt; Knock the devil out of the ring. &gt;&gt; Train for the knockout punch. Can you say amen? See, so we don't want to act like we don't know what we're doing when we face the enemy. &gt;&gt; We don't want to start looking around for sympathy. Can you please help me? I just I'm just about to die. &gt;&gt; No, you got to train. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Know what you're doing when you stand toeto toe with the enemy. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Don't fall apart. A amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we basically have only one enemy, and that's the devil. Ain't that right? I know the prophet said you're the you're your biggest enemy, and that's true, but but you're only your biggest enemy because you're allowing Satan, &gt;&gt; Amen. to to to have havoc with you. &gt;&gt; People like to be petted. &gt;&gt; People like PE pe people like attention. PE people like someone to to nurse on them and and oh you poor baby and and oh you poor this and oh you poor that. See and so every time trouble comes man they get on the phone they start gossiping and they start telling everybody the church's problems and and this brother done this and this brother done that and and and and all it is is is they just love they love sympathy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's all they they is. They ain't a real soldier. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and so so we only have one enemy. And see now, now Satan has an army of demons. &gt;&gt; And and as we know, there's more demons in in in today's world than there's ever been because they have been released uh by the re uh river Euphrates. Ain't that right? Evil powers, demonic spirits, and horsemen, and all of these things. Well, a demon or a devil, the prophet said in the English word uh uh it it it it is means tormentor. A demon is a tormentor. Ain't that right? That that's what uh uh uh uh Sister Kim is is dealing with is is a tormentor. Sister Martha, a tormentor. Well, because he can come that they'll put Satan will put sickness on you. It's a tormentor when you got a headache and it's just pounding and you and and you can't Judah, you know, he's taking Tylenol and ibuprofen and Advil, whatever, you know, and the headache just won't go away. What is it? It's a demon that is tormenting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just happen. It It's It's a spirit that is attacking in the physical realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I hope I didn't hurt your feelings by saying that things. It's just true. It it it's just he's a tormentor. &gt;&gt; But but he does that. He breaks up homes. He he breaks up marriages and he causes uh division and and he's a tormentor. Now uh uh so first Peter 5 and8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour or seeking whom he may destroy. &gt;&gt; He he wants to destroy you. &gt;&gt; Amen. He does not like the thing you stand for. He doesn't like the god you worship. &gt;&gt; He doesn't like your worship. &gt;&gt; He doesn't like your faith. He doesn't if you're if your joy stems from the word of God and the Bible, the promises of God, he hates that kind of joy. &gt;&gt; He He is doing everything he can. If you're benefiting from God and his word, he hates it. He hates you. &gt;&gt; So, he's out to destroy your faith. If that faith came from God, he's determined to destroy that faith. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, if your confession come from the Bible, from the word of God, he'll try to destroy. Amen. And silence that confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Well, he doesn't bother you when you say, "Oh, I'm sick. Oh, I just don't feel good. Oh, I think I'm going to die." He's fanning the flames. But the moment you say, "Well, I'm sick. I or I'm healed. I've got victory. I'm I'm I'm going to overcome." Watch all hell break loose. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He's trying to get you to doubt your own confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't think for a moment that Satan is playing around. He's not. &gt;&gt; And he's using every tactic he can to destroy you. &gt;&gt; Now, to be honest, it's hard for people to discern the enemy uh for the fact that he is unseen. Our senses may not uh you know, they're not made to pick up or discern things that that cannot be seen. our our senses only discern this this life earthly temporal things that we see. It's it's there. But millions are people millions of people are oblivious to the spirit world. They see a person's, you know, ungodly actions and they blame the person or they they hear what someone says that is ungodly or uh uh evil or what and they blame the person. Well, see, and and and so, you know, there there are actually people uh uh surprisingly, but but people that think we ought to get rid of guns uh uh uh to to squash the murder, you know, that's in the world today. So, they think guns are going to take care of it. Ain't that funny? Because they see this gun killing people. So, they just automatically think if we get rid of guns, we solve our problem. &gt;&gt; That doesn't solve nothing. But they they're oblivious to the spirit world. A ain't that right? See, and so uh uh uh uh we place blame on things we hear and and the things we see, the actions and words and and all of these things. So we place blame on all of that. See, and it takes discernment to recognize uh something that your senses cannot detect. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the way it was in Jesus's day. The majority of people could not see God in Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. The Bible says the fullness of God dwelt bodily in him, but all they saw when they looked at him was a man. &gt;&gt; They just saw a man. That's all they could see. That's all their senses could detect. &gt;&gt; And they could not recognize the unseen God was living there because the veil was a flesh. The flesh was the veil that kept them from seeing God. Ain't that right? When Jesus made it known to them and he said, "I and my father are one." The Bible says they picked up stones and they were going to stone him &gt;&gt; because they could not see nothing but a man. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and and and and so in John 10:32, Jesus answered them, "Many good works have I showed you from my father. For which of those works do you stone me?" The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, because that thou being a man, makest thyself God." &gt;&gt; In John 14:10, "Believest thou not that I am in my father, Jesus said, and the Father in me. The words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works." God, the unseen God was living in a veil of flesh and was literally doing the works through that veil of flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, if they would have studied the word, if they would have studied the word of God as to what God promised for the day and would have known the characteristics of God, they would have recognized that God was making himself known in Christ. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And so today the people cannot see God because they are looking at the veil of flesh. They're looking at the natural. Well, I believe they cannot recognize their enemy, the devil. In the same way, &gt;&gt; they cannot see that Satan is the one that anoints them to disbelieve. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they cannot see that makeup and the eye shadow that women are wearing today are coming from the pits of hell from some unseen power influence. &gt;&gt; They cannot see that Satan is the one that's anointed these women to go without clothes. &gt;&gt; They can't see that it's a it's an unseen spirit that is causing them to tattoo their bodies all up. &gt;&gt; There's no normal person that would say that's pretty. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No normal person &gt;&gt; could say that a a woman with pink hair, nose on a ring, her nose on a ring, ring in her nose and her tongue and and eyelids and and and big old holes in her ears or earlobes drooping. No normal individual can say that's pretty. &gt;&gt; They're already in trouble as it is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then to do that makes it worse trouble. &gt;&gt; So you know many people who claim to serve God cannot see that Satan, the God of this world has blinded them from seeing the truth. &gt;&gt; They can't discern it. They can't see the enemy because he's unseen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and you know he may not anoint us uh in that way uh because he has rec we have recognized that those things are of the devil. We we he can't he can't put on us uh and and make us think that you know uh dressing sexy is is the way to go. No. We we recognize the enemy that way. We recognize the enemy looking at women and their their filthiness that a man should not do that. So we've recognized that. See, and and we don't we we turn our heads and and all of these things, but but that doesn't stop him from coming at us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; See that? That doesn't stop him from coming at us. Many time he places thoughts in our mind &gt;&gt; that are contrary to God's word. And if we do not recognize what's going on, we will actually begin to think that those thoughts are coming from us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And instead of casting those thoughts aside, we begin to dwell on it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'll put a thought against our brother, a thought against our sister, &gt;&gt; and we start nursing them thoughts. Nursing them thoughts and not us not recognizing, oh, we recognize the devil on somebody else, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; out there and they're murdering and they're committing adultery and they're doing this and they're doing that. Oh, they're bound by the devil. True. But them thoughts that get us to to to look at our brother in a different way, our sister in a different way, and and even look at us ourselves in a different way from what God has called us to be. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; That's our enemy. &gt;&gt; So now 2 Corinthians 10:5, casting down imaginations. See, well, you got to be trained to do this. That's right. &gt;&gt; We got to be trained to do it. &gt;&gt; Not every thought is meant to dwell to be dwelt upon. &gt;&gt; Not everything that we uh uh uh uh that comes to us is to be entertained. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be trained. &gt;&gt; What thoughts are of God and what thoughts are not. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're trained, then you are to cast down imaginations. &gt;&gt; God trying to tell you he loves you. Amen. And we would rather take the devil's words, the devil's thoughts. Well, I've done this and I've made this mistake and I made that. I just don't see how God could love me. You've got to be trained to cast that thing down. &gt;&gt; Cast down imaginations and everything high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge or the word of God, the mind of Christ, and bringing into captivity. Do you realize that we're not meant to be captives? &gt;&gt; We've been set free. How many's been set free by the blood of Christ? You've been set free &gt;&gt; not to come back under bondage again. But now you're called to bring into captivity. You bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the prophet tells us over and over, Christ is the word. bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of the word. And Jesus said, "Thy word is truth." Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and he says, "I am the truth." So Christ and the word are the same thing, and they are truth. &gt;&gt; Bring every thought into captivity uh to obedience to the truth, to Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? bring every thought in obedience to him. Jesus in speaking of Satan said there is no truth in him. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to wonder who's speaking truth to you. If if if your thoughts are coming by this word, that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If thoughts are not oh lining up with this Bible, &gt;&gt; it's not truth. You bring that thought into captivity &gt;&gt; cuz there is no truth in him. When he speaketh the lie, he speaks of his own. For he is a liar and the father of it. Cannot speak truth. Cannot speak truth. It may look like he's speaking truth when he tells you you're unworthy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God never will tell you you're unworthy. &gt;&gt; God will never tell you that you're not a daughter of his. &gt;&gt; You're not a son of his. Right? &gt;&gt; He may correct you. He may he may whip you and chastise you, but it will never be with him telling you he doesn't love you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So then you've got to be trained and and recognize that comes from the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring that under captivity. &gt;&gt; When a thought comes to you that's contrary to what God said, then it's of Satan. When an action is contrary to what God said, then it's of Satan. That's your enemy. &gt;&gt; When a word is said that is contrary, amen, to what God said, then it's of Satan. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You realize truth is part of God's armor. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That we are to put on. Amen. Ephesians 6:14, we read it. Stand therefore having your loans gird about with truth. &gt;&gt; You got to have truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Your enemy is a liar. That's right. &gt;&gt; He speaks lies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, the prophet said, "Truth, it's the belt." It's a belt. &gt;&gt; He called it the girdle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a belt that you put around your waist and and you buckle it on. He said, "That's the belt that holds the rest of it together. &gt;&gt; It holds the rest of the armor together." &gt;&gt; If you ain't got truth, your your armor's going to fall off. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Gird loans with truth. In the day, brother, when there's all kinds of isms and fanaticism, it's time to girdge yourself with the truth. Hallelujah. Jesus said, "I am the truth." See, the truth, he said, I tell you, when people say, "Well, what about this? What about that?" It's good to see that old truth buckle around you, knowing where you're standing, then stand there. Let them say, "Well, you have, you know, you have this and the other, but you know where you're standing." See, have the whole armor buckled on, gird around here, buckled down good and tight, pulled down with the truth of God's word anchored in your heart, and all devils in hell cannot upset you. And you can meet Satan and say, "It's written." &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now, if you ain't got buckled truth, then you'll never be able to say that. &gt;&gt; Oh, you may say it for once cuz you remembered what the preacher said about it. &gt;&gt; But once you get in your trials, you'll forget what the Bible says about if you ain't got truth buckled down. &gt;&gt; Sat you down. I mean, hard. &gt;&gt; Get it down tight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is why we we better know what truth is. Someone comes to you and say, "Well, I don't believe that brother Brandon was the seventh angel." I don't listen to it. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to listen to it. No, it sounds good. The explanation sounds great, but nah, you're buckled around with truth. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; See, so this is why we better know now. You know, Sister Kim was telling me yesterday she's in the hospital. you know, a thing just got out of surgery or whatever. And and there was days that she actually she said she just felt like she was going to die. And that's when Satan would come to her and she, you know, she, you know, uh she could tell you, you know, but something began to tell her in her mind, you're going to die. This is the end of it. This is this is the last. You're finished. You didn't hear an audible audible voice, did you? No. See, it it just began to come in her thoughts. &gt;&gt; Now, now that wasn't her thinking that &gt;&gt; that was Satan come to her at her weakest time &gt;&gt; to tell her, "You're finished. It's over." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, but because God had sent a prophet, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; with the message of truth and told her that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "No weapon formed against you shall prosper. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; She began to recognize, hold it, that's not from me. That's Satan talking to me. &gt;&gt; That's Satan putting them thoughts in my mind. So I start believing that. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Trained to the word, trained on how to meet your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he was trying to anoint her with unbelief. So what did she do? She began to talk back. I'm not finished. &gt;&gt; I've still got more to live. That's right. &gt;&gt; And she got praising God, lifting her hand, praising God in that hospital room, and that thing left her &gt;&gt; trained. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham tells us how to overcome. Overcome means to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks. A lot of people say there is no devil. It's just a thought. Don't you believe that? There's a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody. A real devil and you must recognize him real. You must know he's a real devil. Same time at the same time you recognize and know that he's a devil and he's against you. Then to overcome, you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So God is greater and mightier than that tumor, Sister Martha. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's greater and mightier than that stone that the doctor can't get out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's greater and mightier than anything. &gt;&gt; He's God in you. Now, notice how he places it. Not God in heaven is greater. God in you is greater &gt;&gt; and mightier than he is. That's the one that's in you has already overcome him. And by his grace, you're more than a match for him. Now, what's happening? The prophet is training us as soldiers. Training us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This message trains us. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By his grace, you are more than a match for him. Amen. There's real overcoming when you recognize, recognize the devil is real. Recognize the devil is against you and he's trying to destroy you. But recognize the God in you is greater than he is. and that you're more than a match. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say, "I'm doing this and I'm doing that." And then no, you're defeated. But there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Then you realize that you've overcome. You know that he's a devil. You can't say I got sickness and I don't believe it is a, you know, uh, and I don't believe it is a sickness. You know, some people go that far. Say, well, I just don't believe I'm sick. I'm just going to ignore it. I just don't believe I'm sick. He goes, yes, you got sickness. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it is a sickness. Oh, yes, it is a sickness. You got cancer. See, don't don't believe it is a cancer. It is a cancer. It is a cancer. But remember, greater is he &gt;&gt; that's in you than he that's in this world. You must realize, see, it's not just ignoring the problem that's going to get you to overcome. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Well, it ain't there. Well, if it's hurting, it's hurting. &gt;&gt; If it's there, it's there. &gt;&gt; So, you're recognizing that the devil is attacking you. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Hello. But also remember, greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. You must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing. &gt;&gt; So don't fear it. &gt;&gt; You're a soldier. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Kid gets a snotty nose. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; It's going to get worse. &gt;&gt; Are you trained to be a soldier? you trained to fight. &gt;&gt; You must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome the thing. He's in you and you can overcome by him. That's exactly sensible exactly the way the scripture is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we must not look at the things that we can see. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we will not recognize our enemy Satan if we only look at the natural things. Now, speaking of people not recognizing, the Bible predicted that in this day people would be without understanding &gt;&gt; in this last day. And and so this makes way for the greatest deception of all time because people are without understanding. Sad thing is they don't want to understand. &gt;&gt; They want to look at everybody as love and peace, kind. They don't want to look at it as that man could be anointed of a spirit to wreck your marriage. &gt;&gt; Wreck a church. &gt;&gt; They don't want to look at that everybody's nice, everybody's kind, and good way for deception. Come on. &gt;&gt; Remember when Israel wanted to be like the heathen nations? They wanted a king instead of a prophet. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't long after the king uh Saul was anointed to be king. The enemy came in and put out the right eye of a lot of God's people. &gt;&gt; He put the right eye out. And the prophet says if he can put the spiritual sight out of your eye where you see the natural things and not the spiritual things, he's got you whipped right there. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; As long as you can have churches, big places, fine intellectual dress people and so forth, as long as your eye looks like that and don't see the spirit side, the enemy's got you under his control cuz you don't know where you're going. &gt;&gt; Exactly. See, it it it takes somebody to recognize the enemy. &gt;&gt; Where's the enemy coming at? Where is he coming at my home? &gt;&gt; Why aren't my children wanting to go to church more like they used to? &gt;&gt; Duh. &gt;&gt; Well, it's just teenagers. Really? &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of teenagers that like to come to church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Well, well, why? Why? Why? Why are we having more Why are we struggling spiritually? What's going on? &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you got to take a step back and look in the spirit realm &gt;&gt; and see what's happening. &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. You allow the movies in your home. That old stupid television, you've allowed unseen forces in your home. &gt;&gt; Listen to ungodly music, you're allowing it. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's just true. &gt;&gt; Talking about one another, talking about the preacher, talking about the church. Nobody loves me and I just need to do this. I just need to leave. I need to move away. I just need this cuz I'm just not loved. You just you don't understand what you're doing. &gt;&gt; And then no wonder your family's having a hard time. And no wonder you can't keep victory. No wonder you can't do that. You're just listening to a devil. He's riding on you just as much as he's riding on the stirrups of a woman that's got earrings on. &gt;&gt; Prophet called them earring stirrups. You know, said it was a devil stirrups. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; But I also believe he rides on a lot of people &gt;&gt; that come to church. right? &gt;&gt; Tells them not to go to church cuz they just, you know, they just well, they're too tired. Well, just, you know, I don't know. I got to get up in the morning, go to work. You know, as I said before, you could lose that job. &gt;&gt; You could lose your health. &gt;&gt; You could lose your arms. You could lose You could get in a in a car wreck and lose your legs. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You could lose your family. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You could lose your mind. Nothing is as important as the house of God, the things of God, taking care of the things of God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But what is it? We're fighting an enemy. &gt;&gt; And as long as you don't see the spirit side of it, the enemy's got you under his control cuz you don't know where you're going. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Uh if if a man cannot see the spirit side, then he can easily be gi given over to every wind of doctrine that comes along. &gt;&gt; He can easily be given over to his emotions and his feelings and and all of these things cuz he's not seeing that Satan's playing on his emotions. Satan's playing on her feelings. someone to say he will cause someone to say something against you &gt;&gt; or or maybe to say something that they didn't even mean to say, but because you're not trained, you allow that thing to start working up. How many people take a situation that ain't even true &gt;&gt; and they think it's true, they go start blabbing it all over &gt;&gt; because they don't recognize a spirit &gt;&gt; that is at work. It's an enemy &gt;&gt; so if if we can't see the spirit side, a man will play right into the hands of his real enemy if he's not careful. The Bible says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Everybody say, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, &gt;&gt; but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Can you say, "Amen." It may look like you're waring against your brother and sister, but you're not. &gt;&gt; It may look like you're waring against your employee or your employer, but you're not. It may look like you're waring against a man that hates you and speaking against you. Amen. And would kill you if he could, but you're not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, you must not make this about flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't make your warfare about flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; He says something, I'll get him back. &gt;&gt; Twerp. &gt;&gt; Don't make it about flesh and blood. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan has destroyed enemies or or or families. He's destroyed marriages. He's destroyed churches. &gt;&gt; Because people can't recognize the spirit, &gt;&gt; their enemy. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You may excommunicate a person that's done you wrong. You may even kill the person that's talking about you, but you haven't done anything to your enemy by doing it. Are you with me? Well, I just going to walk away from you. I ain't going to have nothing to do with them again. Go right ahead. &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing. &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing at all. &gt;&gt; Your enemy is still right there. &gt;&gt; The problem is you're going to hate the other guy, too. &gt;&gt; And you're going to hate the other guy, too. &gt;&gt; And you're going to excommunicate this girl, too. And you're going to excommunicate. Before you know it, you've excommunicated the church. You've excommunicated the world. and you're standing all by yourself without friends, without without God, without the church, without nothing &gt;&gt; because you looked at it as flesh and blood &gt;&gt; and your enemy is still there working on you. &gt;&gt; Tell your heart so bitter, &gt;&gt; can't smile no more, can't be joyful in God anymore. &gt;&gt; You're stripped of victory. You're stripped of faith. You're stripped of everything. &gt;&gt; How many men have caused their families to leave a church and go out and not Well, we just played tapes. Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anyone that goes around playing tapes and don't go to a church and don't hook up to a house of God, watch their families. Look at their children. &gt;&gt; Look at their families. &gt;&gt; They're in a mess. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why? because the enemy's got them to where they're away from the they're cut off from the the the the the lifeline. &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Don't make it about flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't it funny how Satan gets us to use excuses? Well, there's hypocrites in the church, so I just ain't going to listen to the message. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; What does that have to do with the message? That's right. &gt;&gt; Had, you know, had that one preacher tell me sat down four and a half hours and he spent them four and a half hours trying to convince me against this message. And he told me, he said, "If I tell you everything that went in them was in that tabernacle while Brandon was up there, he knew all that stuff was going on. And yet he said they got the Holy Ghost and he treated them like brothers. If I told you everything went on, you'd walk away." I said, "No, I wouldn't." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to walk away. &gt;&gt; But see what it is? Satan gets us to looking at something here and we then blame the message. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But see, God is known by his characteristics and so is Satan known by his characteristics. &gt;&gt; And I tell you this, Satan's not a person of peace. &gt;&gt; He's destructive. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Is this all right? &gt;&gt; Satan is not a person of peace. Satan is not for brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Satan is not He He He God does not put depression on you. &gt;&gt; God does not put oppression on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He's not a person of peace. Look, look, look at the nations that are fighting today. &gt;&gt; Ain't it funny? They're all calling calling for world peace. &gt;&gt; Peace through strength. Got a president wants to be known for peace &gt;&gt; and every time he turns around he's starting wars &gt;&gt; threatening to fight threatening this. Threatening that. It ain't going to stop. &gt;&gt; Fix a hole here. Another hole's leaking over here. Fix that hole. Another hole's leaking over here. You can't stop it. Satan is in control of these things. Satan is in control of politics. He's in control of religion. He's in control of government. He's in control of of education and science. And he's in control of it all. &gt;&gt; And the prophet told us that spirit nations, each nations has their own spirit, demon spirits. And these spirits get jealous of one another. &gt;&gt; It ain't people, &gt;&gt; it's spirits. spirits get jealous of one another and anoint people. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And they start fighting, &gt;&gt; fighting over oil, &gt;&gt; fighting over power, &gt;&gt; fighting over this, fighting over that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we're only seeing men with grenades and bazookas and bombs and, you know, &gt;&gt; Yeah. all of that. But the prophet in dealing with the spirit world gives an insight to what's really going on. &gt;&gt; Satan causes situations to arise to get at you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He works through people and causes them to act up to get at you. &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. It's true. &gt;&gt; You get a blessing from God. You just watch. If you're not trained, &gt;&gt; you'll lose it. &gt;&gt; Get your joy. Get your faith. get to where you just, oh God, I I just really I believe it. I'm going to claim you at your word and watch Satan work in every way he can to take that away from you. &gt;&gt; And if you're not trained, you go right back in the same rut that you always. &gt;&gt; He likes to stir up trouble. &gt;&gt; He's the one that puts sickness upon us and diseases. &gt;&gt; Satan dwells in a negative atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Always. He gets people to think negative thoughts, speak negative words. He creates a negative atmosphere. And anything that is against God's word is negative. &gt;&gt; For God's word is always positive. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He is the one that tries to get you to disbelieve. He tries to get you out of God's will. He tries to get your spirit all tore up so that you can't hear God's voice. He's the one that tries to get you upset. He's the one that gets you weary and get you to worrying over things. He's the one who tries to get us unsettled. And you you understand what I'm saying? He he's the one that causes uh uh discord among the brethren. He gets people to talking about people in the church to others. He tries to get us distracted from what God is doing in our life. It it it's just a constant war. Constant war. Constant war. Revival and then Satan comes in with a blow. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet told us that demons are powerless unless they're embodied. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember, and I I'll hurry here, but remember when Jesus cast those demons out of the man of Geria, &gt;&gt; before they went, they pleaded unto him to let them go into the hogs. &gt;&gt; Because they have to have something to embody in order to destroy. &gt;&gt; So, demons go from place to place. Remember, it's just like Jesus said that when a demon leaves the house, when a spirit leaves a house, let's say a human being, cuz that's what he's talking about, he will leave. But then there comes a time he comes back to that person &gt;&gt; and he finds that house empty. He finds it empty. &gt;&gt; Then he goes and gets seven spirits worse. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they come in and buy it because they have to have something to live in &gt;&gt; in order to destroy. If you let him use your mouth, he'll take it. &gt;&gt; If you let him just put thoughts in your mind and you start dwelling on it, he'll faint. He'll take it. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You see the warfare? So, so you got to fight every day of your life. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't care if you've been a hundred years in the message and you're just a stout, strong individual. It doesn't matter. You got to stay on your guard all the time. Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to stay with the word all the time. &gt;&gt; It's a fight fight fight. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; So they go from demons go from place to place, from home to home. You you don't have to have your children go out in the world. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you don't have to have your home wrecked up. &gt;&gt; I just don't believe it. &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I I I just don't believe that you have to, you know, you you you have to have a church wrecked up. I I just don't believe it. But see, demons go from place to place, home to home, church to church, from man to man, looking for a place to come in. Looking for a place that'll give him the power to do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Now, you know what a prophet said? Satan is powerless. He was already defeated. But he can bluff you. &gt;&gt; And you listen to his bluff. You've actually empowered him. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, so the only way he could get to Eve was through the serpent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was Satan. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we read where uh uh God wanted to deceive Ahab. So he said, "Who will go forth that deceive Ahab?" A lion spirit come from up from beneath and said, "I'll go." Yeah. &gt;&gt; God says, "All right, you'll go and you shall prevail." How did he do it? By getting in to 400 men. &gt;&gt; Now, Ahab couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; Them 400 men couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; But here come a prophet &gt;&gt; that he could see in the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; He said, "I know why you say those things. There's a lying spirit on you." &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so Satan has to work through something. Why? Why do we have false prophets, false Christs, false teachers, false prophets? &gt;&gt; Hello. Now that lion spirit could have gotten on all four of them hund 400 prophets but he couldn't get on that prophet Makaya &gt;&gt; cuz the prophet says that that that when when Isaiah or when Micaiah was sent out there or and and said you know the king is wanting you and and and and you you want you to say something and let him know he the prophet and and you know I don't know how it all goes but the prophet just lets us know just kind of you know he says he got in the Bible Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he thought, you know what? If them 400 prophets are saying the same thing going up, there's got to be something wrong with that. &gt;&gt; So he says, "We're going to go in the Bible." And he began to check prophecies. And he found the prophecy of Ali of Elijah that had prophesied Ahab's doom. And something clicked in him and said, "This is the day." &gt;&gt; Hello. You see, instead of just listening to everything, stay with the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So, Satan's got to work through somebody to accomplish his agenda. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Love one another above everything. Love one another no matter what the devil tries to say." No matter what he tries to say. You're all one great big sweet group now. But remember my warning. Satan won't let it stay that way. No sir. He'll shoot everything. If he has to bring somebody in to make his target, he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in, set him down, and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things, and then he'll shoot that guy with a some kind of a poison stuff, and he'll start through the church with it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, don't you take sides with it. &gt;&gt; Don't you have nothing to do with anything else. You stay right, loving, sweet, and kind to one another. Pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or whoever it is. Just pray for them and stick with one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay with your pastor. He's the shepherd. You give him respects. He'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so. &gt;&gt; Now, you remember that the enemy will come, not might come, not maybe come. He might just pass you. &gt;&gt; Y'all stay quiet enough. &gt;&gt; He'll walk down the street and he won't even know you're there. No, he will come. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And when he does, here's some training. Just cling that much closer together. And the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you. Don't never clan among or talk or make yourself clenish. We are one. I couldn't say my left hand, I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand. He's my left hand. I want him to stay there. Even the little tip of my finger, I want to uh stay right there. Every little part of my body stay right there. And God wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another. Right with one another. He said, "Now, you've got tapes on that. You got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church. How we behave oursel in the church of God. How we uh got to come to get here. how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places. Don't stay home. If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. &gt;&gt; That now Satan's got him a lot convinced that home is my church. My home is my church. &gt;&gt; That's not what the prophet just said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Got to be buckled up with truth. &gt;&gt; Don't stay home. That's right. &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open yonder. Get it to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying &gt;&gt; cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us to more as we see that that day approach and to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you are my disciples when you have love one for the other. &gt;&gt; That's right. Stay right together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, believe it or not, as we get ready to close, the prophet tells us that it's not only evil people that Satan works through. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Satan will work through people that brother Brandham called precious people. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they innocently get under the influence of the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was starting on the series, Revelation series chapter 5, he talked of how he had been in the ministry for 31 years and for the Lord. And he said, "You know, I was thinking about looking back down along the trail where I've come through and seen the different hills and brier patches and rocks and hard places and smooth runningings and what I did in those kind of times. It'll all show up on these days at the hour of my going away." It'll do that on each one of us. We will all be sure of that. It'll show up to each one that when that time comes. And and if you just well you just hear any message but he was so careful not to bring a reproach to Christ and always careful not to exalt himself and always careful to give God glory &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; you never have to had to worry you never have to worry about any message where brother Brandham exalts himself I hear these ungodly well I won't call them idiots but critics that that say one said, you know, he's he's he's really working hard, minister in North Carolina. He is really working hard to get people turned from this message. And and he he was he was saying he says, you know, he says, none of these preachers none of these message preachers can accept a challenge at any of he said, just like Brandham couldn't. &gt;&gt; And I thought, what a ding-dong. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham accepted challenges all the time. But see, it's Satan working &gt;&gt; trying to get the those that are unsettled to think that brother Brandon was a coward &gt;&gt; that he couldn't defend the message. &gt;&gt; We know where we're standing. &gt;&gt; But we're not going to cast our pearls before swine. &gt;&gt; If they want to debate, we ain't going to stand there and debate them. &gt;&gt; But we know where we stand. &gt;&gt; The prophet made a challenge to anyone around the world. Come up. Come up. Stand right by me. They wouldn't do it because they knew an angel was standing right there. &gt;&gt; And he made it clear, if I am a false prophet, I'll drop dead. If you're a false prophet, you drop dead. &gt;&gt; None of them would do it. &gt;&gt; But he was so careful as not to bring a reproach. And if he said, you know, if there was anything in his heart, it was to hear the words from our Lord, well done, thou good and faithful servant. He said, 'If anything I always wanted to be and desires of my heart to be was a true servant to Christ Jesus and my Lord and Savior. I want my testimony to be clean, clearcut, that I stood in all of my mistakes, yet I loved him with all my heart and I do that this morning with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; But as he's talking, then he says, "I'm going to leave the field." Remember that he tells the people, he says, "Now I'm leaving the field." He said, "Something has risen up amongst the people &gt;&gt; that caused him caused me to make this decision." And he says, "Now, this is what something's come up among the people." He said, "I've been taken from my bracket of a minister or brother and being called Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; That would brand me as an antichrist. And if you're hearing him say these things, he's he's broken up. He is crushed. &gt;&gt; He's not bragging. I mean, he is crushed. It's it's go listen to the sermon. It's at the beginning. &gt;&gt; And he he says, you know, he said, uh, that would brand me as an antichrist and I'll meet God as a quitter before I would meet him as an antichrist to take away from him. &gt;&gt; He said, I stood still. If people called me a prophet many times because a prophet in the English testament is just a preacher, a prophesy, foreteller of the word and so forth, I'd stand for that because you could just kind of push that down. But when it comes to be calling uh uh anointed Christ or something that was too much for me. I just can't stand it. See, he said, I heard of it a few years ago. I thought it was a joke and I met a couple brethren. He said, which I don't see neither of them in the meeting this morning. two or three of them one time in a fishing trip and they approached me by the subject of saying, "Brother Brandham, aren't you the anointed Messiah, the Christ?" And I put my arms around the neck of both brethren or all of them. And I said, "Brethren, as much as I have tried to be a true servant of Christ, I would not that you would say such a thing as that. If it would ever be said of me, then I will leave the field with a clear conscience. and you who do that will be responsible for every soul that I would have saved during that time for taking me from the field. And I thought that ended it. He said, "Well, the other day in Canada, a brother showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pocket. Said, William Brandham is our Lord. Baptiz it in the name of William Brham and a little precious. If it had been an enemy, if it had been my enemy, someone that was totally against the message, hated him, he said, you know, I would have known it was a joke. But a precious darling brother come up to confess his sins and his wrongs and say his faith in me as being Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He said after leaving the meeting at Canada, I found out that way up in the Eskimos or the Indians up there, it had got amongst them. And so it just tore me all up. And the hunting trip that I had planned to take, you know, planned so long I could not take it. I was afraid of a hunting accident if you understand what I mean. I got so shaky worse than I am standing here now. And and I just couldn't stand it any longer to think that 31 years of ministry went down the devil's gutter pipe. &gt;&gt; When I'm gone, what will they say? See, there he is. That's exactly what it was. All the influence that I had upon the people, then you see where it'd be. I'd be an antichrist. And I just couldn't stand it. I thought I'd rather die here in the woods like I fell on my gun or something. See? Then then I and then I though my little Joseph for and so forth that had to be raised, I was in no condition to hunt. So I just left the woods and come on home. I've been torn up. See now he says now if it would have been some enemy of mine, it would have been all right. I would have just laughed at it, went on. But when it come to being precious brothers, precious sisters, then that's what hurt me. And I said, "Lord, this this thing's too great for me. I'll just have to walk out and leave it in your hands. I don't know what nothing else. Now, brother Brandham or the Lord showed brother Brandham a vision as to what was going on. Now, notice he said, I seen a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me right along and the thing struck me on the leg, but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me. And I looked down and there's where I had been bit before. I turned quickly with the gun and shot the thing and hit it right in the mi right in the middle of it. And the brother said, "I turned with my gun to shoot his head off." And he said, "Don't do that. Just pick up the stick laying there by you." And when I turned back to pick up the stick, the snake withered into some water. Uh just some puddle of water. So he didn't kill that thing, &gt;&gt; but he was showing that spirit that was upon them precious brothers, &gt;&gt; precious sisters, right? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But he didn't kill it. He said, "Well, it can't hurt very much longer cuz I believe uh the brother realizes or the brethren what that what would happen. It's mortally wounded, so it'll die." See? Well, then he goes on. He goes, "Brothers, sisters, haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you? Have not I tried to be your brother?" Now, what wherever it is, it's a spirit on precious people, &gt;&gt; people that loved him, people that loved the message that he brought, people that was his friends. And yet through all of that, brother Brandham was able to look beyond the natural and see a snake, a spirit. And he didn't call them evil people. He called them precious people. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I hope you understand them people didn't realize what they're doing and they still don't because that thing's still alive. There are people that are baptizing in the prophet's name. They're taking that picture and while they're baptizing, they're holding it up over the person during baptism. It It's wacko. And you think, well, they're evil people. They're ungodly people. Yet, Brother Brham says they're precious people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And yet, they don't know. They don't know the spirit that they're of. Just like Peter didn't know when Jesus began to show his disciples of what was going to happen to him. He's going to die and all that. Peter rebuked him and said, "No, you ain't going to die." And Jesus turned around and says, "Get behind me, Satan." &gt;&gt; Now, he wasn't calling Peter a devil. &gt;&gt; He was looking at the spirit that was using Peter. &gt;&gt; He that spirit was getting to Peter to get to him, &gt;&gt; right? to get him to turn aside from the will of God. But Jesus knowing that spirit said, "No, Satan, get behind the hint. You're a hinder to me." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. we find and and I I'll close here, but brother Brandham, you know, he's he's talking about Eve and the serpent and how the serpent he Satan used the serpent to turn Eve aside by saying, "You shall not surely die." Brother Brandham said, "See his tactic? What he's trying to do, that first human being, he's trying to anoint that precious woman there, God's daughter, with an unbelief in God's word." And that's exactly what he's trying to get her to do. See, Satan anoints what's his first tactic? What's his first place to get the mind? She stopped for a moment to listen to what he said. Oh, you don't say. But God gave us his word for our weapon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as the prophet said, it's Satan's job to get you to disbelieve your weapon. &gt;&gt; He says, see here, we see the tactics of the devil. How how how do we do? I've got a lot of scripture here of prophets and things where he come to them and different peoples through the Bible and done the same thing. It's always his tactic is to try to get the people to disbelieve God's word. Listen, you soldiers of the cross. When you disbelieve one word of God's written Bible, you're disarmed. &gt;&gt; You're disarmed. You surrender, you jellyfish. You put on the whole armor of God. We're in a battle. What God said is true. Every man's word is a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But as soon as he gets you to listen to one thing, that's his tactic. You're disarmed. How many things did Eve have to listen to? Listen. How many things did Eve have to listen to? One. &gt;&gt; She was disarmed right then. What did the devil do? Swept right in through her mind into her spirit. And there she was perverted. She was perverted the very minute that she was disarmed when she disbelieved God's word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And that's what he tries to get each one of you to do out there. anoint you. And the only thing you have to do, you're a free moral agent. Now, you can accept it if you want to, but kick it out. &gt;&gt; If Eve hadn't stopped that moment to listen. See, don't stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Don't stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; I know. I know it's justifiable. You can justify. Say, "Well, the guy's a liar. He lies all the time. Well, you can look at that and you can you can you can build your whole life and pattern your actions and everything around that and justify it. Or you can take God at his word and said, "I'll love that man anyways. I'll love that woman anyways. &gt;&gt; I'll treat him just the way God would want me to treat." Brother Brandham says, "Love that man that would kill you if he could." You believe it? &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're in a battle. &gt;&gt; He knows where to get us. &gt;&gt; He may not be able to get you, Brother Branson, to smoke a cigarette, but he'll get you in the way that you He knows he can get you. &gt;&gt; He'll get us. &gt;&gt; But he can't do it &gt;&gt; if we have the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You don't have to fear that devil." &gt;&gt; Don't fear him. &gt;&gt; That's right. I He'll bring fear. Maybe some of you dealing with habits and you trying to get free from them habits and Satan's there saying you'll always have it. You'll always have it. You'll always fail. You'll always go through this this thing. And and then you start building that complex. You start building a fear of it. You start building a I wished I could. I wished I could. Well, won't you just look at that devil and say, "Devil, I don't have to fear you. &gt;&gt; I've got the word." and stand on that word and you'll watch that thing disappear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; I love that word. &gt;&gt; You might have been delivered of something and you're free and you're going around, I'm free. I'm free. And give it give it a month, six months, and then Satan will come back around again. will. &gt;&gt; He'll come back around again with the same temptations, same desires, &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you think, "I thought I was free. Oh no. Oh, I know. I know. It's just a cat scratching at the door. &gt;&gt; You're free. &gt;&gt; Now fill that void up with faith. Fill that void up with God. &gt;&gt; And say, "You're not welcome here, devil. &gt;&gt; You're just not welcome." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him. &gt;&gt; I hope it's helped you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know, I know we're victorious because the word says we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thinking of what brother Bram said, you know, talking about how the nations, we have improved on our weaponry. You know, we were throwing javelins and then we had our swords and little knives and horses back in the Revolutionary War. It was the dumbest thing. They'd all stand in line. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Facing each other and I'd be I' I'd be writing a real request. Can I stand in the back? &gt;&gt; Cuz that sucker is going to die. &gt;&gt; And he just sits there and waits. Y'all shoot first. &gt;&gt; But we we've kind of grown up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now we're in age of airplanes and jets. Now it's drones. &gt;&gt; We're so improving in our machinery and our weaponry. But brother Brown said, "But if you notice, God never changes." God never changes with his weapon. He's given us the best to start with. It's still the best today. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad for that. &gt;&gt; I don't have to question. Say, "God, do you have something greater? I need it. I need it." No. He says, "It's right here. No matter how dark and the night is and no matter how great the enemy is, just stay with my word. Stay with my word and you'll overcome every bit. Every demon that comes against you, you will overcome them. Surrender yourself to it." Can you say amen? Oh, we've been made coner overcomers in this life. We've been made victorious. through the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, sing it again. We've been made more than coner, overcomers in this life. Glory to God. We've been made victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ. Do you believe that? Say it again. Unto the Lord. Oh, we've been made more than conquerors. Hallelujah. overcomers in this life.

I thought there was only one life support, but he's on five different life supports. they've given him up and then turn around and he wakes up wanting something or talking or whatever and wanting to get up and that just shows how powerful God is. &gt;&gt; And we love you, appreciate you, and and believing for a great year in the Lord this year.
