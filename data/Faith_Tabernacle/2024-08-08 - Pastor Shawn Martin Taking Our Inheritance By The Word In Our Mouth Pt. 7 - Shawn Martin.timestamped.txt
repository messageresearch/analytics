[45:05] amen um so Hebrews the 6th chapter we're
[45:10] going to start at the 13th verse for
[45:13] when God made promise to
[45:16] Abraham because he swear by no greater
[45:19] he swear by
[45:21] himself saying surely blessing I Will
[45:24] Bless thee and multiplying I will
[45:26] multiply thee
[45:27] and so after he had patiently endured he
[45:31] obtained the promise for men verely
[45:34] swear by the greater and an oath for
[45:36] confirmation is to them an end of all
[45:40] Strife wherein God willing more
[45:43] abundantly to show unto The Heirs of
[45:47] promise now think of that The Heirs of
[45:51] Promise the immutability of his counsel
[45:54] confirmed it by an oath
[45:57] then if you'll turn with me to the book
[45:59] of
[46:00] Ephesians the um first
[46:05] chapter
[46:07] amen book of Ephesians the
[46:11] um first
[46:17] chapter and um going to read
[46:23] um start at the third verse Blessed Be
[46:27] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[46:29] Christ who ha blessed us with all
[46:31] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[46:34] in
[46:34] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[46:37] him before the foundation of the world
[46:41] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[46:44] before him in love having predestinated
[46:47] us unto the adoption of children by
[46:50] Jesus Christ and to himself according to
[46:53] the good pleasure of his will to the
[46:56] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[46:59] he hath made us accepted in the Beloved
[47:03] in whom we have Redemption through his
[47:05] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[47:08] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[47:12] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[47:14] and Prudence having made known unto us
[47:17] the mystery of his will according to his
[47:20] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[47:23] himself that in the dispensation of the
[47:26] fullness of times he might gather
[47:30] together in one all things in Christ
[47:33] both which are in heaven and which are
[47:35] on earth even in him in whom also we
[47:40] have obtained an
[47:42] inheritance everybody say we have
[47:44] obtained an
[47:46] inheritance being predestinated
[47:49] according to the purpose of him who
[47:50] worketh all things after the counsel of
[47:53] his own will then if you'll turn with me
[47:57] uh before we have your seats um Romans
[48:01] the 8th
[48:03] chapter
[48:05] amen Romans chapter
[48:10] 8 and I want to start at the 16th
[48:15] verse Romans 8
[48:18] and6 the spirit itself witness with our
[48:21] spirit that we are the
[48:24] children or sons of God God and if
[48:28] children then heirs Heirs of God and
[48:33] join HS with Christ if so be that we
[48:36] suffer with him that we may also be
[48:42] glorified together for I reckon that the
[48:46] sufferings of this present time are not
[48:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[48:51] which shall be revealed in us for the
[48:53] earnest expectation of the creature
[48:55] waiteth for for the
[48:57] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[49:01] you can have your seats this
[49:04] evening and I have uh I guess directly
[49:10] or
[49:11] indirectly uh been dealing with us
[49:14] laying claim to our
[49:16] inheritance by the word in our
[49:19] mouths and um the the Apostle Paul we've
[49:25] read the scripture uh uh before but the
[49:28] Apostle Paul tells us that the word is
[49:31] in our
[49:33] mouth and uh and and that word that is
[49:37] in our mouth is the word of faith which
[49:41] has been preached which has been
[49:43] declared so then this makes it a
[49:47] confession uh the word that is in our
[49:49] mouth is is a
[49:52] confession and of course confession is
[49:56] to save the same thing that has already
[49:59] been declared and so but Paul would tell
[50:03] us that not only is the word of faith in
[50:06] our mouth but it's also in our heart and
[50:11] and so now this means uh that our heart
[50:14] must be settled upon the word of God
[50:17] just as it was with
[50:20] Caleb uh uh when you know the 10 spies
[50:24] uh went out and and
[50:27] uh uh they gave an evil report but Caleb
[50:31] wouldn't listen to that report he he
[50:33] kept his heart settled upon the word of
[50:37] God that the prophet had given and so uh
[50:41] uh the scriptures are opening scriptures
[50:43] stand out to me uh uh uh in in many ways
[50:48] and and I just the things that have
[50:50] stood out to me uh is is Heirs of
[50:54] Promise uh that that is a word that that
[50:57] Paul would use Heirs of Promise Heirs of
[51:00] God and Joint heirs with Christ uh our
[51:05] inheritance the dispensation of the
[51:08] fullness of times the glory which shall
[51:12] be revealed in US these scriptures are
[51:15] speaking of these things the glory which
[51:17] shall be revealed in us which reminds me
[51:20] of the scripture uh of Hagi uh 2 and9
[51:24] that says the glory of this latter house
[51:27] shall be greater than of the former
[51:30] sayth the Lord of hosts amen and so all
[51:34] of these statements that I've just read
[51:36] to you uh that Paul mentions it has to
[51:39] do with us it's it's we we we can no
[51:42] longer put them in an age uh uh uh prior
[51:47] or an age uh to come but uh uh it has to
[51:52] do with us for we are the final the
[51:55] final voice us to the final age there's
[51:59] no other age to come there's no promises
[52:03] um that uh uh are given to another
[52:06] people uh that speak of a bride because
[52:09] there's no other age it's it's it's us
[52:13] and and and and we we are it another
[52:16] thing that stands out is is Paul would
[52:19] mention the manifestation of the sons of
[52:22] God that all creation is groaning
[52:25] waiting for the manifestation what what
[52:28] do we mean by the manifestation of sons
[52:33] brother brandham says it's when true
[52:35] Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and
[52:40] their word is backed amen there that it
[52:44] comes a time that it it's it's we're
[52:47] separated from just being church member
[52:49] and religious and doing Christian duties
[52:52] and all of that but it it's it it comes
[52:55] when our word when we speak a word our
[52:58] word is backed by almighty God Amen see
[53:03] and so we're we're see we're we're no
[53:05] longer speaking as a servant but we are
[53:09] speaking as sons of God brother BR says
[53:13] say to this mountain let it be so
[53:16] brother I desire so and so a certain
[53:19] thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus
[53:21] Christ well I give it to you in the name
[53:24] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen say
[53:27] there's a manifestation amen oh brother
[53:30] my crops are burning up out yonder I
[53:32] haven't had any rain well I'll send you
[53:34] rain in the name of the Lord that's not
[53:36] a prophet saying these things amen it's
[53:39] it's sons of God that that have come
[53:42] into the position of authority I'll send
[53:46] you rain in the name of the Lord God see
[53:49] bless your crop see all waiting groaning
[53:52] all nature waiting for the manifestation
[53:55] of the son Son of God God ordained it at
[53:59] the beginning he gave man the domain he
[54:03] gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in
[54:06] his name with this assurance ask the
[54:09] father anything in my name and I will do
[54:13] it ain't that right well see so so these
[54:17] scriptures are standing out to us amen
[54:20] because we are living in the Fulfillment
[54:23] of them not just teaching them not just
[54:26] educating it being educated into them
[54:30] amen uh uh but but fulfilling the
[54:33] scriptures we are the people to fulfill
[54:36] these scriptures amen they've never been
[54:39] fulfilled as it is today this is the
[54:42] time this is the age you see uh you
[54:46] remember that those who make up the
[54:48] bride are the elected everybody say the
[54:51] elected amen if you're part of the Bride
[54:54] then you're elected and if you're
[54:56] elected then you are
[54:58] predestinated for this you're
[55:01] predestinated to this and and and and
[55:04] the ones that are in the bride amen uh
[55:07] are ones the prophet said who can
[55:09] recognize their place in the Kingdom
[55:13] amen that's that's the people that we
[55:15] are we're recognizing our place in the
[55:19] Kingdom we're not Beggars we're not
[55:21] Vagabond we are sons of God Amen and
[55:25] scriptures mean uh uh mean for us amen
[55:29] they they they uh for us to make them
[55:32] live they these are the things that are
[55:34] sharing us up as the as the Church of
[55:37] the Living God what makes the sun hang
[55:40] out in midair what makes the Moon and
[55:42] and everything stay in its orbit and and
[55:45] in its place they do it by the word of
[55:48] God and that same word is now holding us
[55:53] secure amen and we're recognizing in our
[55:57] place in the Kingdom you see Caleb
[56:00] recognized his place he recognized the
[56:03] time he was living in he recognized what
[56:06] his inheritance was and and so the bride
[56:10] is recognizing her position the prophet
[56:13] said in the word amen she's recognizing
[56:17] her position in the word and it's what
[56:20] is putting her in her place her
[56:23] recognizing her position in the world
[56:26] is what is putting her in her place amen
[56:31] see he says the spirit of God which is
[56:34] the word of God he said my word is
[56:36] spirit and life so the spirit is the
[56:39] word of God Amen will put the bride in
[56:42] her place because she'll recognize her
[56:45] position in the word then she's in
[56:48] Christ and will put her in her place
[56:52] aren't you glad for that amen politics
[56:54] ain't going to put you in your place
[56:56] government ain't going to put you in
[56:58] your place religion will not put you in
[57:00] your place amen but God would send a
[57:03] prophet uh in this hour Amen to divinely
[57:07] reveal the word amen and as Joshua did
[57:11] so is this ministry amen imparting the
[57:14] scriptures that pertain to us in this
[57:17] hour and we're recognizing our position
[57:20] in the word of God Amen recognizing our
[57:24] position I thought in the message in
[57:27] things that are to be brother brandham
[57:28] said we now feel the strange call of God
[57:32] to go to this great Eden how many feels
[57:35] that great that great strange call it's
[57:38] it's a strange call but but it's a call
[57:42] nonetheless that is pulling us to this
[57:45] great Eden we know we know that we're
[57:48] here we we see the signs we we see the
[57:51] things that are happening in the world
[57:53] and and I don't I don't think that that
[57:55] this thing these things are I don't know
[57:57] who's going to be president but I I can
[58:00] tell you this right now that every
[58:02] prophecy that brother Bram spoke of a
[58:04] woman being president and being cruel
[58:06] and being mean and and bringing this
[58:08] nation down to ruin amen it could very
[58:11] well be amen within uh uh the uh be
[58:15] ffield amen within just a few months
[58:17] from now amen everything is pointing to
[58:21] the end time amen and if that be the
[58:24] case then and we can see this and the
[58:26] world can see that there's trouble on
[58:29] every side then there is a bride upon
[58:32] this earth that is not just looking at
[58:34] that amen and being found in her
[58:37] position by that she is finding her
[58:40] position by the scriptures and prophecy
[58:42] that speak of her for this day and this
[58:45] age you see we have lived out the
[58:48] justification age the sanctification Age
[58:51] and and the Pentecostal age brother Bram
[58:54] says we are now living in the age of
[58:58] adoption we are now living in the age of
[59:01] adoption this is the age when God can
[59:04] pour into us his fullness not just aart
[59:08] not just having a little dip of God Amen
[59:11] like the other ages they had a dip of
[59:13] the holy spirit that God can pour into
[59:17] us his fullness his power his
[59:20] resurrection that when the church and
[59:23] Christ become so close to together till
[59:26] Christ becomes visible in your flesh
[59:29] Among Us and raises the dead and we go
[59:33] into the Rapture aren't you glad for
[59:35] that you see he didn't pour out his
[59:38] fullness amen into the people in 1906
[59:42] amen which started the Le osia
[59:44] Pentecostal age amen see and and and if
[59:48] he would have pulled amen poured his
[59:51] fullness in in in uh the baptism of the
[59:54] Holy Ghost in the Pentecostal age well
[59:57] then it would have brought on the
[59:58] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[1:00:01] you see the sons of God cannot amen uh
[1:00:05] uh be manifested without adoption and
[1:00:09] 1906 the baptism of the Holy Ghost did
[1:00:12] not bring uh uh the sons of God into
[1:00:16] adoption amen yes sir amen so now notice
[1:00:20] the prophet said the last thing the last
[1:00:23] thing this is after 1906 the Pentecostal
[1:00:26] age and all the ages the last thing that
[1:00:30] the church is going to see is Christ
[1:00:32] manifested in his power in fullness in
[1:00:37] his church just before the fire Falls
[1:00:41] now I don't know I I believe that it's
[1:00:43] happening everywhere I I just believe
[1:00:46] that amen and and I choose not to look
[1:00:50] at yesterday and I choose not to look at
[1:00:52] tomorrow and say it's going to come
[1:00:54] tomorrow I believe that we're living in
[1:00:56] the Day present tense can you say amen
[1:01:00] amen see so God isn't just satisfied
[1:01:03] with us and just being a Pentecostal and
[1:01:06] acting Pentecostal and carrying on the
[1:01:09] Pentecostal tradition and the
[1:01:10] Pentecostal ways and and all of these
[1:01:13] things there's got to become a
[1:01:15] manifestation of sons of God that's our
[1:01:18] duty that's what we have been
[1:01:20] predestinated for amen and this is the
[1:01:23] time amen you see we're living in a time
[1:01:27] where the church is being positionally
[1:01:29] placed amen the prophet said where the
[1:01:32] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:35] comes into the church aren't you glad
[1:01:39] for that see so the manifestation comes
[1:01:42] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:01:45] comes when Christ and his church unite
[1:01:49] they become one they they they they
[1:01:52] blend together that's that's what amen
[1:01:55] when we we're not needing the Corporal
[1:01:57] body the physical Corporal body to come
[1:01:59] to Earth God's got your body amen and
[1:02:03] everything that God was he poured in to
[1:02:05] Christ and everything that Christ was he
[1:02:08] is now pouring into the church which is
[1:02:11] his body can you say amen amen see and
[1:02:15] so uh uh then we find that this
[1:02:18] manifestation of sons of God then is the
[1:02:22] Fulfillment amen of of Luke 17:30 the
[1:02:25] son of man being revealed yes the son of
[1:02:28] man was revealed in brother bram's time
[1:02:31] amen but it did not stop it did not end
[1:02:35] amen and and like one individual told me
[1:02:38] years ago said brother Sean we're not in
[1:02:40] the son of man we're back in the Son of
[1:02:42] God well brother R never taught that
[1:02:44] it's that's never been the case it's not
[1:02:47] true we are still in that son of man son
[1:02:51] of man being revealed in in a bride body
[1:02:55] amen see he says see when this son is
[1:02:58] adopted into his own family from then on
[1:03:02] Amen from then on this son is given
[1:03:05] power amen well it didn't happen in in
[1:03:08] ausa Street it didn't happen amen All
[1:03:11] Through the Ages amen this is the time
[1:03:14] of adoption no no other age no other
[1:03:17] time is it for the sons of God to be
[1:03:19] manifested outside of this time that's
[1:03:21] what a prophet said see it had to wait
[1:03:24] till this time and so when this son is
[1:03:26] adopted into his own family from then on
[1:03:30] this son is given power he's gifted then
[1:03:33] his names just as good as uh his
[1:03:37] father's is on the check because he's
[1:03:40] the boss think of that now you're not
[1:03:43] the victim you're the boss amen you're
[1:03:46] not a slave to the devil you're the boss
[1:03:49] amen that's what that's what this
[1:03:50] manifestation of sons of God have it
[1:03:53] means see he's the boss he's over the
[1:03:56] straw bosses because God see God gives
[1:04:00] him things that none of the straw bosses
[1:04:02] know nothing about because he's a son
[1:04:05] and I want to say this uh there there's
[1:04:07] a lot of people don't understand what we
[1:04:09] preach and and and and they don't
[1:04:11] understand why we believe the way we
[1:04:13] believe amen but listen church amen that
[1:04:16] Revelation is what's giving you a power
[1:04:19] Amen to become what God wants you to be
[1:04:22] amen that that no one else is going to
[1:04:24] understand this but it's bringing you to
[1:04:26] your position in Christ Jesus yes sir
[1:04:30] see and we ought to count it Grace that
[1:04:32] God would bring us into this message
[1:04:35] amen count it a blessing amen it's the
[1:04:37] grace of God that God would bring us
[1:04:40] into this and allow us to to to listen
[1:04:43] to what a prophet says and not only to
[1:04:46] listen but to believe what a prophet
[1:04:48] said amen and to live what a prophet
[1:04:51] said and that word becoming flesh in US
[1:04:54] amen yes sir
[1:04:56] now you see Abraham he he went through
[1:04:59] the same process as the church has uh uh
[1:05:04] has gone through uh he went through
[1:05:06] justification by faith election that's
[1:05:09] in Genesis 12 chapter 12 which
[1:05:12] represents the Lutheran age amen the
[1:05:15] next thing was sanctification by the
[1:05:17] blood sanctification by the blood to the
[1:05:20] seed the prophet said uh uh which
[1:05:24] represented the the West in age Genesis
[1:05:27] 15 uh uh uh that's where the
[1:05:30] sanctification took place for Abraham
[1:05:33] amen then the prophet said then in his
[1:05:35] weak condition Abraham Drew see from
[1:05:39] God's Own Strength by Nursing From A
[1:05:42] Promise see uh Genesis 17 you find that
[1:05:46] which represents the Pentecostal age see
[1:05:49] in his weak condition Abraham Drew from
[1:05:52] God's Own Strength by Nursing From A
[1:05:54] promise the prophet said he was nursing
[1:05:57] God's Own Strength into him taking God's
[1:06:01] Own Strength into the church see the
[1:06:04] Pentecostal age which was the baptism of
[1:06:07] the Holy Ghost amen But Then There came
[1:06:11] the adoption the time for adoption now
[1:06:14] brother Braham says Abraham was adopted
[1:06:16] amen which was a type of you and I today
[1:06:20] amen he his life amen the stages that he
[1:06:23] went through it represented Lutheran age
[1:06:25] wesle age and the Pentecostal age but
[1:06:28] then that last thing was adoption see
[1:06:32] and this see the and and and the prophet
[1:06:34] said the sun always falls air to to The
[1:06:38] Inheritance see see the placing of a sun
[1:06:41] everybody say the placing of a sun see
[1:06:44] the sun always falls air to the
[1:06:49] inheritance this is why Paul says if
[1:06:52] Sons then hirs you can't be a son of God
[1:06:55] and not an heir of God Amen if Sons then
[1:06:59] heirs can you say Amen so if he has in
[1:07:03] inheritance if there has been an
[1:07:06] inheritance left amen then he is an heir
[1:07:11] amen Well church and if you would take
[1:07:15] God has left us such an inheritance it
[1:07:18] it's incredible amen the prophet
[1:07:20] preaching on things that are to come a
[1:07:23] or that are to be talking of an
[1:07:25] inheritance it's it's it's our
[1:07:27] inheritance the future home of the
[1:07:29] Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[1:07:31] bridegroom that's an inheritance amen
[1:07:34] this Rapture and the changing of our
[1:07:36] bodies what an inheritance that we have
[1:07:39] we're heirs can you say Amen you realize
[1:07:42] brother brandom says that if you are an
[1:07:44] heir amen then then you can look at
[1:07:47] sickness and tell that thing to go amen
[1:07:50] because healing is yours salvation is
[1:07:52] yours Deliverance is yours your children
[1:07:55] children are yours amen as an heir of
[1:07:58] God everything that Christ died for
[1:08:01] belongs to you he left us with an
[1:08:06] inheritance see so then that means we're
[1:08:09] heirs but notice the inheritance amen is
[1:08:13] not given to him when he is born The
[1:08:16] Inheritance is not given to the son when
[1:08:18] he is born but rather when he is adopted
[1:08:24] I know now I know that's some are
[1:08:26] teaching that the the the the birth and
[1:08:29] the adoption are the same brother Brown
[1:08:31] never taught that don't believe that if
[1:08:34] you go back listen to hear ye himym all
[1:08:37] them sermons and listen to uh the
[1:08:39] adoption series and listen to so many
[1:08:42] others amen The Inheritance is not given
[1:08:46] Amen to the son when he is born but
[1:08:49] rather when he is adopted ain't that
[1:08:52] right see so the manifestation of Sons
[1:08:55] of God happen at time of
[1:08:59] adoption amen now brother Bram says your
[1:09:02] adoption is not your birth your adoption
[1:09:06] is your placing amen see so the son had
[1:09:10] no inheritance until he was positionally
[1:09:13] placed in the family brother BR says
[1:09:16] just because you have received the Holy
[1:09:18] Spirit that doesn't mean that
[1:09:19] everything's going to be poured into
[1:09:21] your hands amen no no no amen you got to
[1:09:25] come to an adoption ain't that right
[1:09:28] notice Galatians 4 and 1 he says now I
[1:09:32] say that the heir as long as he is a
[1:09:34] child deth nothing from a servant though
[1:09:37] he be Lord of all amen he's heir of
[1:09:39] everything he's he's Lord of all things
[1:09:42] but he differeth nothing from a servant
[1:09:44] as long as he is a child ain't that
[1:09:47] right see though he be Lord of all but
[1:09:49] is UN under tutors and governors until
[1:09:52] the time appointed of the father
[1:09:55] now brother brandham in in uh hear ye
[1:09:58] him I believe or the adoption series he
[1:10:01] he he talks about that there in the Old
[1:10:03] Testament there were rules of adoption
[1:10:06] rules of adoption and and these rules
[1:10:09] are not something to be ignored amen uh
[1:10:12] uh this is something that that that we
[1:10:15] to listen to and to take heed you you
[1:10:18] know and and and so it it's like if a
[1:10:20] father uh had you know he owned
[1:10:22] thousands of Acres of a ranch and and he
[1:10:25] he's got this great business and and
[1:10:27] maybe he's got cows and and sheep and
[1:10:30] he's got this and he's got that and and
[1:10:32] all these things well he he he's he's
[1:10:35] got uh laborers and and and employees
[1:10:39] what we would call employees cow hands
[1:10:41] Ranch hands whatever you want to call
[1:10:43] them but he's got maybe maybe uh uh uh
[1:10:46] some uh uh uh you know ranch ranch hands
[1:10:50] that are you know 5 miles 10 miles out
[1:10:54] on this side taking care of the sheep
[1:10:56] and he's got maybe uh 30 mies out this
[1:10:59] way and and he's got Ranch hands over
[1:11:01] there taking care of his cattle and he's
[1:11:03] got this one over here and he's got him
[1:11:05] kind of all scattered well he he he's
[1:11:08] he's got to go and check and and make
[1:11:10] sure that that that everybody's doing
[1:11:12] good that they're running the business
[1:11:14] that his kingdom is operating just right
[1:11:16] see and and yet he's got a son he a son
[1:11:20] has just been born and and and kind of
[1:11:23] you know maybe he's 3 years old or
[1:11:25] whatever and and and I don't know maybe
[1:11:28] maybe just born I don't know still in
[1:11:29] the Cradle I don't know but but then he
[1:11:32] he got to thinking well I I ain't got
[1:11:34] the time to invest in my son I ain't got
[1:11:37] the time to tell him all the dos and the
[1:11:39] don'ts and what I want and all these
[1:11:41] things CU i' I've got to make sure my
[1:11:43] business is being ran you know and and
[1:11:45] he didn't have you know back then he
[1:11:46] didn't have the automobile and plane and
[1:11:48] all that he had his old donkey you know
[1:11:50] yeah and and so you know then then so
[1:11:53] what he would do is he would hire a
[1:11:55] tutor somebody that that he he knew
[1:11:58] somebody that he could trust somebody
[1:12:01] that was worthy honest and and and that
[1:12:05] that knew him that was intimate with him
[1:12:08] in in in business and you you understand
[1:12:11] it wasn't going to cut his throat and
[1:12:13] all these things he had to be somebody
[1:12:15] honest and and so so the the prophet
[1:12:18] said see when when the son was born in
[1:12:20] this home the father did not have time
[1:12:22] take care of the son that he should so
[1:12:24] he went and got some someone a tutor a
[1:12:26] razor someone to raise the child educate
[1:12:30] that child in the Kingdom of the father
[1:12:33] ain't that right why because he knew his
[1:12:36] son was going to fall air to everything
[1:12:39] that he owns here amen and his son and
[1:12:41] the desire was his son to take over and
[1:12:45] And he as the father would step back and
[1:12:48] and kind of blend in the shadows a
[1:12:50] little bit and no longer would would he
[1:12:53] be dealing with the ranchan and all
[1:12:55] these things in the business but the son
[1:12:57] would step forward and and take that
[1:12:59] responsibility and and he would run that
[1:13:02] Kingdom but his father wasn't just going
[1:13:04] to give it to a little sport brat and
[1:13:07] and someone that just a snotty noes kid
[1:13:09] and and had to have everything his way
[1:13:11] oh no no so he would raise that child
[1:13:14] under
[1:13:15] tutorship ain't that right see so the
[1:13:19] prophet said see he says uh see the son
[1:13:22] did not inherit anything until his life
[1:13:25] proved out to be the right kind of a
[1:13:27] child and the tutor which is the holy
[1:13:30] spirit in our case see brought word to
[1:13:32] the father all the time how this child
[1:13:34] was progressing see so so the son or the
[1:13:38] father would want a report from the
[1:13:40] tutor every every now and again I don't
[1:13:42] know how you know me could be that
[1:13:44] remind me of trump you know but uh uh uh
[1:13:48] but but it could have been you know
[1:13:50] every year could have been three months
[1:13:52] six months I don't know but anyways uh
[1:13:55] so so that the tutor had to give the
[1:13:57] right kind of report had to be honest
[1:14:00] and and he would tell well your son you
[1:14:02] know he's just he won't listen he's just
[1:14:05] he's he I hate to tell you sir but he's
[1:14:07] a little wild and and I can't get him to
[1:14:09] do nothing and and I you you understand
[1:14:12] what I'm saying well these reports now
[1:14:14] the father he wanted a good report he
[1:14:16] did he he wanted the right true report
[1:14:20] he didn't want the uh uh the report to
[1:14:22] be a little shady and and say oh your
[1:14:24] son is good when the sun ain't good amen
[1:14:27] because his is is he he's got a business
[1:14:30] and he don't want this business to go to
[1:14:31] pot you know and and to be ruined so so
[1:14:35] the so so the father uh uh the tutor
[1:14:38] would come and report on the progress of
[1:14:41] this child now the prophet said now we
[1:14:44] have tried to jump the fence see we
[1:14:47] tried to stick the cart before the horse
[1:14:49] you tried to claim things and do things
[1:14:53] before God did it and God a lot of Flesh
[1:14:55] worked up into it well see that's the
[1:14:58] Pentecostals that's that Pentecostal age
[1:15:01] amen when the tutor come amen this
[1:15:04] message they didn't want it they didn't
[1:15:06] want nothing to do with it they wanted
[1:15:08] their fleshly things yeah I say unto you
[1:15:10] y y and it didn't even come to pass and
[1:15:13] they went and they were led by their own
[1:15:15] feelings calling it being led by the
[1:15:17] spirit led by emotions led by Sensations
[1:15:21] led by everything else instead of the
[1:15:23] true word of God
[1:15:26] can you say Amen so the brother Rand
[1:15:28] talking that Pentecostal age then
[1:15:30] Pentecost you tried to claim things and
[1:15:32] do things before God did it see and a
[1:15:34] god a lot of Flesh worked up into it see
[1:15:37] amen so the the father finds this best
[1:15:40] uh tutor to teach his son he says he
[1:15:43] just doesn't get a Scully wag he wants
[1:15:45] his boy to be a real fella he wants a
[1:15:48] man a tutor that'll be honest he don't
[1:15:51] want a man to say well now look you know
[1:15:53] Junior you just do anything you want to
[1:15:55] honey oh yes Father uh-huh he's getting
[1:15:58] along just fine he's a fine boy and get
[1:16:01] a little Pat on his back and a straw in
[1:16:03] his hat no no he says that guy would get
[1:16:06] fired right away see he wants a man
[1:16:08] that'll be truthful if that boy's coming
[1:16:10] right tell him if he isn't coming right
[1:16:13] then tell him what's wrong see amen tell
[1:16:16] him all about it see well the Holy
[1:16:18] Spirit as we know is our tutor but he
[1:16:21] speaks through human lips ain't that
[1:16:24] right he speaks through human lips for
[1:16:26] the prophet told us and and we can see
[1:16:28] it all through the Bible that man is the
[1:16:31] agency that God works through man is
[1:16:34] that agency see and so uh the prophet
[1:16:37] said he's not going to speak through a
[1:16:39] pope because he knows the pope ain't
[1:16:41] going to tell you the truth see he isn't
[1:16:43] going to speak through a psychologist
[1:16:45] because the psychologist ain't going to
[1:16:47] tell the truth he isn't speaking through
[1:16:49] denominations because the denominations
[1:16:51] ain't telling the truth he ain't he
[1:16:54] ain't speaking the things ain't that
[1:16:55] right well what is the truth well Jesus
[1:16:58] said in John uh 17:17 that Thy word is
[1:17:02] truth so the word of God is truth so he
[1:17:06] needed a tutor that'll speak the word of
[1:17:08] God ain't ain't that right so this is
[1:17:11] why a prophet would come on the earth
[1:17:12] because the word comes to a prophet amen
[1:17:15] and in this day the spirit of Truth has
[1:17:17] come to us manifested through a
[1:17:20] prophet's word amen see amen so the
[1:17:23] prophet said see when you see the the
[1:17:25] Holy Spirit speaking through lips see
[1:17:27] that's telling the truth exactly every
[1:17:30] time predicting and coming to pass just
[1:17:32] perfectly like Samuel said then you know
[1:17:35] that's the truth see you know that's
[1:17:38] truth that's the thing you need to take
[1:17:40] heed to that's the thing you need to
[1:17:42] subject yourself to and let him be your
[1:17:45] tutor can you say Amen this message is
[1:17:48] not just another sermon of TD Jake and
[1:17:51] Benny Henn and Jack Cole and and
[1:17:53] whatever this message is the tutor it's
[1:17:56] the spirit of Truth amen speaking to a
[1:17:59] bride amen perfecting sons of God Amen
[1:18:03] to bring them up into an adoption see so
[1:18:07] he says see so you know it's the truth
[1:18:09] it's coming right see because God said
[1:18:12] if he speaks and what he says don't come
[1:18:14] to pass don't hear him cuz I'm not with
[1:18:17] him but if he does well then hear him
[1:18:19] because I'm with him ain't that right
[1:18:22] it's kind of interesting just for a
[1:18:23] moment but interesting how brother Brown
[1:18:26] says that at the time that the a woman
[1:18:27] would become president that cars would
[1:18:30] be like eggs you know and and of course
[1:18:33] you know or the shape of an egg you know
[1:18:35] and and it's funny someone uh uh uh gave
[1:18:37] me a uh a print of or a uh a deal of an
[1:18:42] advertisement of a of a car company amen
[1:18:45] and and and they're advertising egg
[1:18:48] shaped cars you know which really
[1:18:50] they're they're like a a V vws and and
[1:18:53] and and something like that but it's
[1:18:55] interesting that they're calling them AG
[1:18:57] shaped cars but a prophet already told
[1:19:00] us it was going to come can you say Amen
[1:19:02] so we're sitting here not wondering
[1:19:05] what's going on we've been given the
[1:19:07] spirit of Truth and if the prophet could
[1:19:10] be right about the world and its
[1:19:12] standing and its its political ways and
[1:19:15] and the turmo amen this turmo is no
[1:19:17] surprise to us everything that we're
[1:19:19] seeing is no surprise to us because we
[1:19:22] have been given the spirit of Truth
[1:19:24] we've heard heard the spirit of Truth
[1:19:26] declare it and if it that is right how
[1:19:29] much more is the word concerning you
[1:19:32] right it's right can you say Amen well
[1:19:35] see so the tutor gives the report to the
[1:19:38] father and tells him if the son is
[1:19:40] obedient or disappoint disobedient
[1:19:43] obedient or disobedient and he lets to
[1:19:45] know he lets the father know whether the
[1:19:47] son is of good character or bad
[1:19:50] character now notice Propet says here's
[1:19:53] where I think the Pentecostal Church
[1:19:54] made their mistake see when that son was
[1:19:57] born into the family he was a son at
[1:19:59] Birth but his inheritance was not yet
[1:20:04] determined it depended upon his
[1:20:07] character can you say Amen character you
[1:20:11] see this message is bringing us to a
[1:20:16] character hope you're understanding so
[1:20:19] though he he though being a son if he
[1:20:22] was a disobedient son he would not in
[1:20:24] herit anything but still he was a son
[1:20:27] but if he was an obedient son he was
[1:20:29] Heir everybody say he was heir to All
[1:20:32] Things see an obedient son and we've
[1:20:35] we've been taught not only through
[1:20:37] Pentecostal reals but through the
[1:20:38] Holiness group the Baptist and whatever
[1:20:40] more that when we're born again we're
[1:20:42] sons of God that's true but that yet
[1:20:45] that's just the beginning then it's your
[1:20:48] character from then on what means the
[1:20:51] difference can you say Amen am amen so
[1:20:55] we're not identified with that
[1:20:56] Pentecostal age sure they they had great
[1:20:59] things amen but they were not there
[1:21:02] remember the seed shall not be air with
[1:21:05] that
[1:21:08] sh so we are not the Shu Pentecostal age
[1:21:12] we are the
[1:21:15] seed so the kind of character that that
[1:21:20] um the father is looking for is one that
[1:21:23] likes to be about the father's
[1:21:25] business amen the prophet says that
[1:21:27] loves to do the things the father wants
[1:21:29] him to do see what was elzer looking for
[1:21:32] when he went and looked for a bride for
[1:21:35] Isaac he was looking for character
[1:21:36] that's what a prophet said he said and
[1:21:38] that's the messenger of the last days
[1:21:40] the evening life is to First find that
[1:21:43] church where they'll where will they
[1:21:46] believe the message hunt it see can you
[1:21:49] read what I'm talking about hunt where
[1:21:51] that church is that'll even let you come
[1:21:53] in that won't close the door in your
[1:21:56] face and then when you do there uh uh
[1:21:59] when you got there when you found that
[1:22:01] then you found character and I just
[1:22:03] believe there's a a people of character
[1:22:06] in this building tonight amen that will
[1:22:08] not close the door Amen to the prophet's
[1:22:11] words to the message of the hour but in
[1:22:14] every aspect of their life they say Amen
[1:22:17] to it amen to it amen to
[1:22:20] it agreed to it then you found character
[1:22:24] now as she'll stand still long enough to
[1:22:25] tell her how the bride's got to be
[1:22:27] dressed she's got to be clothed see
[1:22:29] stand still ain't that right now notice
[1:22:32] in
[1:22:33] 1953 1953 now in 1906 the the the
[1:22:38] baptism of the Holy Spirit was poured
[1:22:39] out amen and and in 1953 brother Brown
[1:22:44] said the church ought to be in adoption
[1:22:45] right now the church ought to be in
[1:22:49] adoption right now bringing into the
[1:22:52] full favors of God
[1:22:55] right my my my but he said but God can't
[1:22:59] trust us with hard nothing hardly
[1:23:02] because of our ups and downs ins and
[1:23:04] outs and ups and downs and ins and out
[1:23:07] one day I belong to the assemblies the
[1:23:09] next day I belong to something else I'm
[1:23:11] a Methodist the next day a Baptist the
[1:23:13] next day you packed your paper from
[1:23:16] church to church in every little group
[1:23:18] you go into the church and I'm a Baptist
[1:23:20] now see and the first thing you know
[1:23:22] somebody makes me angry the deacon get
[1:23:24] get me wrangled up see and the pastor
[1:23:27] says something I don't believe I pick up
[1:23:29] my paper take off over to the Methodist
[1:23:31] if the Methodist don't get them I take
[1:23:33] them down to the assemblies or go to the
[1:23:35] Church of God you pack your papers till
[1:23:37] it's all wore out but it's in that time
[1:23:40] that the church should have been adopted
[1:23:44] come into that
[1:23:46] adoption can you say Amen see you've got
[1:23:49] to keep your eyes single upon the word
[1:23:52] of God and I'll say that to you young
[1:23:54] people keep your eyes single to the word
[1:23:56] of God don't look what they're doing
[1:23:59] don't look what this one's doing don't
[1:24:01] look what that one's doing that one's
[1:24:03] doing amen you you've got all kinds of
[1:24:06] things even in the message amen that one
[1:24:08] contradicts the other and all that keep
[1:24:10] your eyes single upon the word of God
[1:24:14] this message is
[1:24:20] right the kind of character that counts
[1:24:24] is one that believes all everybody say
[1:24:26] believes all that believes all the word
[1:24:29] of God that's the character that counts
[1:24:32] is one that believes all the word of God
[1:24:34] brother Bram said when you accept the
[1:24:36] whole full gospel when you believe in
[1:24:38] everything God wrote it's the truth God
[1:24:42] wants you to believe it that way God
[1:24:45] help us see so this message is not to
[1:24:48] tickle our fancy amen you you you
[1:24:51] understand amen I I had you know an
[1:24:53] elderly one time tell me we need to go
[1:24:55] back to ausa oh they had it better our
[1:24:57] churches are so dry and our churches are
[1:25:00] this and and and we just ain't got it
[1:25:02] the way it was but see a lot of that was
[1:25:04] just emotions a lot of that was
[1:25:06] fanaticism I'm not saying all of it
[1:25:08] there was true things even we saw true
[1:25:10] things real things but a lot of it was
[1:25:12] emotions and and a lot of it was ups and
[1:25:15] down Sensations ins and outs and all of
[1:25:17] these things amen but what the message
[1:25:20] is doing is not taking the life out of
[1:25:23] us it's not taking zapping God out of us
[1:25:27] it's actually building character if
[1:25:29] somebody can stay still long enough
[1:25:32] through their trials and through their
[1:25:34] testings and Through the Fire amen just
[1:25:36] to be settled upon the word and let that
[1:25:39] character
[1:25:41] shine
[1:25:44] yes remember Caleb settled down on the
[1:25:48] word so a son of good character believes
[1:25:52] every word of God and says Amen to it
[1:25:54] and notice he's growing in Grace in
[1:25:57] other words he's maturing brother
[1:25:59] Brandon would call it ripening in the
[1:26:01] presence of the sun ripening there was
[1:26:04] none there was no ripening in the
[1:26:05] Pentecostal age there was no ripening
[1:26:08] Amen in all the other we're coming to
[1:26:09] maturity sons of God Amen the sun is now
[1:26:13] shining upon the seed and the the Shu
[1:26:16] has pulled away that Pentecostal shuck
[1:26:18] has pulled away from the seed and the
[1:26:20] sun light is shining now quickening that
[1:26:23] seed ripening that seed none others are
[1:26:27] ripening but the seed is ripening can
[1:26:30] you say Amen why because there's
[1:26:32] character in that seed there's a faith
[1:26:35] in that seed that believes every bit of
[1:26:37] the word that says Amen to every bit of
[1:26:39] the word of God don't say well that was
[1:26:41] brother bram's opinion and well I don't
[1:26:43] know you just have to kick that aside
[1:26:45] and just stay with your Bible amen how
[1:26:47] could God send a prophet amen and preach
[1:26:50] and deny the word of God
[1:26:55] H it ain't
[1:26:57] true a prophet is true on God's
[1:27:00] word so he's growing in Grace and notice
[1:27:05] the son of good character is is
[1:27:07] submitting submitting to the word not
[1:27:10] overriding the word but submitting to
[1:27:12] the word see in in and and and with that
[1:27:16] there comes a lot of Shaving there there
[1:27:19] comes a lot of cutting there comes a lot
[1:27:20] of of of of hurts and and and pains and
[1:27:24] Agony and and all that but you got to
[1:27:27] stay there and let God finish you
[1:27:31] out a self-denial he's allowing himself
[1:27:35] to be refined by the word he is about
[1:27:37] the father's business now see the father
[1:27:40] seen the son had progressed and that he
[1:27:43] was a worthy boy everything he did was
[1:27:45] right and and he was right up with the
[1:27:48] father's business he wanted everything
[1:27:50] just right for the father and he had no
[1:27:52] selfish motive see that that's the sign
[1:27:55] who the father adopted ain't that right
[1:27:59] now we know that Jesus was adopted uh on
[1:28:01] Mount Transfiguration that's what a
[1:28:03] prophet taught and and so we we know
[1:28:07] this Matthew 17 And1 and and uh um after
[1:28:12] six days Jesus taketh Peter James and
[1:28:15] John his brother and bringeth them up
[1:28:17] into an high mountain apart and was
[1:28:20] transfigured before them and his face
[1:28:23] did shine as the the son his reignment
[1:28:25] was white as the light and behold there
[1:28:28] appeared unto them uh Moses and Elijah
[1:28:32] talking with him then answered Peter and
[1:28:35] said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us
[1:28:38] to be here if thou wil let us make here
[1:28:41] three Tabernacles one for thee one for
[1:28:44] Moses one for Elias and while he spake
[1:28:47] Behold a bright Cloud overshadow them
[1:28:50] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:28:52] which said this is is my beloved Son in
[1:28:55] whom I am well pleased hear ye him and
[1:29:00] when the disciples heard it they fell on
[1:29:01] their face and were s afraid Jesus came
[1:29:05] and touched them and said arise Be not
[1:29:07] Afraid and when they had lifted up their
[1:29:09] eyes they saw no man save Jesus Christ
[1:29:13] that's the only thing they saw was Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ there was the adoption that was
[1:29:17] the time that Jesus was adopted the
[1:29:20] prophet said see when he God
[1:29:22] overshadowed him Jesus and his reignment
[1:29:25] his pretty role before him the glorified
[1:29:28] condition like Shine Like the Sun in its
[1:29:30] strength is that right a voice came from
[1:29:33] heaven and said this is my beloved Son
[1:29:36] hear ye him I've placed him positionally
[1:29:40] that's my son what he says I'll back up
[1:29:45] he's kept my word he's fought through
[1:29:47] all these denominations and everything
[1:29:49] else and kept the faith he pulled no
[1:29:51] punches he's been true he's always
[1:29:54] always about my work when people look at
[1:29:56] him they see me this is my son hear ye
[1:30:02] him what an
[1:30:05] adoption so now after Abraham had gone
[1:30:10] through the stages of justification
[1:30:13] sanctification and the circumcision
[1:30:15] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:17] the prophet said God took Abraham out
[1:30:20] and placed the adoption upon him and
[1:30:23] changed his name from Abram to Abraham
[1:30:28] gave him a name change see so the word
[1:30:31] Abraham comes from the word
[1:30:34] Elohim which Elohim is God's Own name
[1:30:39] and other words he Associated Abraham's
[1:30:43] name with his own name can you say amen
[1:30:47] God being Elohim the prophet said God
[1:30:50] took the Hem Hem off of his name and
[1:30:54] place it onto Abraham's name see Abraham
[1:30:57] was first Abram Abram but then in that
[1:31:01] adoption God took the hymn off of his
[1:31:04] name and placed it upon Abram's name and
[1:31:07] it become Abraham see God was the father
[1:31:11] of all things of the universe of
[1:31:13] creation but Abraham now became the
[1:31:17] father of
[1:31:19] Nations see what was it God positionally
[1:31:22] placed him yes brother brah said that's
[1:31:26] after see that's after his church
[1:31:28] received the Holy Ghost after they had
[1:31:30] went through the testings now I want to
[1:31:32] listen to tell you Church you got to go
[1:31:34] through your
[1:31:35] testings you got to go through your
[1:31:38] testings testings are
[1:31:41] hard come on now you ever been where you
[1:31:44] feel like God left you you ever just
[1:31:46] felt like God forsake you come
[1:31:50] on
[1:31:52] brother hello
[1:31:54] TR that ain't the time to give into this
[1:31:56] Le Odyssey in
[1:31:59] spirit that ain't the time to give up
[1:32:02] that ain't the time to grow slack God's
[1:32:04] looking for a character that's
[1:32:08] right yes sir he said see that's after
[1:32:13] his church received the Holy Ghost after
[1:32:15] they had went through the testings
[1:32:17] Pentecost missed
[1:32:19] it they refused to go through the test
[1:32:22] yeah yeah they wanted feelings they
[1:32:25] wanted something they can touch they
[1:32:27] wanted some
[1:32:28] emotion right come
[1:32:30] on hello yes sir and they organized
[1:32:34] themselves and couldn't get any farther
[1:32:36] then when God does a certain thing they
[1:32:38] say ahuh see stay away from it see see
[1:32:42] our church don't teach that go ahead see
[1:32:44] but here's what he done to Abraham to
[1:32:47] Abraham and his seed after him he
[1:32:51] adopted them
[1:32:54] made him heir of all things
[1:32:58] sir Hallelujah so it was in Genesis 12
[1:33:02] that Abraham was justified it was in
[1:33:04] Genesis 15 that Abraham was Sanctified
[1:33:07] it was in Genesis 17 that God gave him
[1:33:09] the holy ghost or the circumcision and
[1:33:13] and and brother Brown brings this out he
[1:33:14] said did you notice that it took Years
[1:33:17] Years between the time of Abraham's
[1:33:20] justification and sanctification in
[1:33:23] between that time was years and in time
[1:33:26] in between the time of Abraham's
[1:33:28] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:33:30] Holy Ghost circumcision there was years
[1:33:33] right there took years but he says now
[1:33:35] notice in the 17th verse after he had
[1:33:39] received the Holy Ghost in that same
[1:33:41] chapter amen he was
[1:33:46] adopted come on we ain't got much years
[1:33:49] to
[1:33:51] go right
[1:33:53] that's right you say oh my you know I've
[1:33:56] received the Holy Ghost so how long do I
[1:33:58] got there ain't no time for adoption I
[1:34:01] mean in time in between you don't have
[1:34:03] to wait long time just
[1:34:06] submit just
[1:34:08] believe can you say Amen yes sir are you
[1:34:11] with me yes just believe the word see so
[1:34:15] he says notice how quick Abraham was
[1:34:17] adopted after he received the Holy Ghost
[1:34:19] he received his adoption in the same
[1:34:21] chapter that that he received the Holy
[1:34:23] Ghost see Martin Luther received reached
[1:34:25] justification and then years and years
[1:34:28] and years later comes sanctification and
[1:34:31] then years and years and years later
[1:34:33] come the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:34:35] right quick after Pentecost did the same
[1:34:38] thing the rest of them did they then he
[1:34:41] pull began to pull his sons that's where
[1:34:43] that's where you're at God began to pull
[1:34:45] you out of that Pentecost po Pentecostal
[1:34:49] age Pentecostal tradition Pentecostal
[1:34:52] train of thought and all of the things
[1:34:54] amen and pull his sons and his daughters
[1:34:57] out of that Pentecostal age see that
[1:35:00] stood for his truth and give him
[1:35:02] something special magnified him before
[1:35:04] the people with a certain thing he stood
[1:35:05] out and placed him aren't you glad for
[1:35:09] that so the prophet said Abraham was
[1:35:12] placed as Elohim
[1:35:14] yes Abraham was placed as
[1:35:19] Elohim associated with God by giving him
[1:35:23] part of his own
[1:35:27] name not name Faith
[1:35:30] Tabernacle not name
[1:35:34] Baptist not a name of gospel assembly or
[1:35:37] evening light or whatever he is own
[1:35:42] name aren't you glad for that and if you
[1:35:45] notice God promised if you look in the
[1:35:48] book of Acts it talks about it that God
[1:35:51] promised that he would call out a people
[1:35:53] out of the Gentiles for his name
[1:35:58] amen think of that God had already
[1:36:02] purposed to bring his sons to an
[1:36:06] adoption call the people out of the
[1:36:09] Gentiles we are that people hallelujah
[1:36:14] and Jesus Christ is the name of the
[1:36:16] father for Jesus said I come in my
[1:36:19] father's name yes the prophet said the
[1:36:22] bride of Christ will be Miss Jesus
[1:36:24] Christ baptized in his spirit in his
[1:36:27] name filled with his power and robed in
[1:36:30] his
[1:36:31] righteousness Colossians 3:17 Paul would
[1:36:34] tell us what in whatsoever you do in
[1:36:36] word in or deed do all in the name of
[1:36:40] Jesus can you say
[1:36:42] Amen do all in the name of
[1:36:45] Jesus if you can't watch that television
[1:36:48] in the name of Jesus don't watch
[1:36:50] it you can't look at certain things on
[1:36:52] that internet in the the name of Jesus
[1:36:54] don't watch it that's right if you can't
[1:36:56] hang around a certain crowd or go into
[1:36:58] certain places in the name of Jesus
[1:37:00] don't do it right why because we're
[1:37:03] Sons yes we're we're looking for the
[1:37:06] father's business right we ain't saying
[1:37:08] well I can do it anyway I don't care I
[1:37:10] know people argue about all kinds of
[1:37:12] things they argue about the television
[1:37:14] well I can have a television in my home
[1:37:15] I mean the phone's just as bad have one
[1:37:17] one men say well the phone's just as bad
[1:37:19] the prophet didn't say if I had a phone
[1:37:21] in my house I'd kick it out and and get
[1:37:23] a shotgun and kick blow that thing out
[1:37:25] amen he didn't say that he said if I had
[1:37:28] a television in my home I'd get a
[1:37:31] shotgun and blow that thing away yeah
[1:37:36] right that's just for your information
[1:37:40] yeah always about the father's
[1:37:45] business can you say
[1:37:47] Amen so it's after the adoption comes
[1:37:51] then the association
[1:37:55] comes with his name the association
[1:37:57] comes with his associ with association
[1:38:01] with his name comes at time of
[1:38:06] adoption this is the time when 2
[1:38:08] Corinthians 58 becomes more clear to
[1:38:11] us for he has made him to be sin for us
[1:38:15] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:38:18] the righteousness of God in him we sing
[1:38:22] that song he became me that might become
[1:38:24] him he became me that I might become him
[1:38:27] when
[1:38:29] adoption hello church right come on the
[1:38:33] age of justification look at look at
[1:38:35] what Luther done he still he he was a
[1:38:37] drunk right yeah that's right look look
[1:38:41] what Holiness done they had it all out
[1:38:43] on the outside and we thank for that we
[1:38:45] believe in Holiness but it wasn't
[1:38:48] everything we thank God for the baptism
[1:38:50] of the Holy Ghost but it still didn't
[1:38:52] reflect all of Christ
[1:38:54] right he didn't reveal the son of
[1:38:56] man but in this age yes there is a
[1:39:01] people that has been Blood Bought
[1:39:03] purchased by God that he became us that
[1:39:06] we might become
[1:39:11] him that's right come on now Romans 81
[1:39:16] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:39:18] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:39:20] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:39:21] spirit the tutor
[1:39:24] for the law of of the spirit of life in
[1:39:27] Christ Jesus hath made me free how
[1:39:29] many's free made me free from the law of
[1:39:32] sin and death for what the law could not
[1:39:35] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:39:39] see God sending his own son in the
[1:39:41] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:39:44] condemn sin in the
[1:39:45] flesh is a where legalism it only deals
[1:39:49] with flesh that's all it does it just
[1:39:51] deals with flesh
[1:39:54] and then this is where legalism goes so
[1:39:56] far wrong they're
[1:39:57] wrong we believe in Holiness but we
[1:40:00] don't we don't well you can't push
[1:40:02] people into
[1:40:03] Holiness you can't push people into
[1:40:06] doing
[1:40:07] things we were under that we we we you
[1:40:11] know we you know fellowship with with
[1:40:13] apostolics and all that and and and you
[1:40:16] know it was just a constant thing but
[1:40:18] but what what was what was the thing it
[1:40:20] just made people more hypocritical
[1:40:23] of all things it just made them
[1:40:25] Hypocrites they would sneak televisions
[1:40:27] anyways and they they they would you
[1:40:29] know they they would cut their hair just
[1:40:30] so it can just enough to where it can't
[1:40:33] be seen see and and and and they would
[1:40:36] do this and they would do that they
[1:40:37] would see what they could get away with
[1:40:39] children would you know they they would
[1:40:41] wait until they got out outside amen of
[1:40:43] the home got in school or whatever the
[1:40:45] girls and then they'd put on their bries
[1:40:47] and and and then they'd wear their
[1:40:49] makeup just long just enough so it can't
[1:40:51] really be noticed and and all of these
[1:40:53] things it was down in that
[1:40:56] heart the law could not perfect
[1:41:00] on that's right ain't that right but
[1:41:04] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:41:06] weak through the flesh God sent in his
[1:41:08] own son and the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:41:10] and for sin uh uh condemn sin in the
[1:41:13] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[1:41:16] might be fulfilled in
[1:41:19] us who walk not after the flesh but
[1:41:21] after the spirit for they that are after
[1:41:23] The Flesh do mind the things of the
[1:41:25] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[1:41:26] the things of the spirit aren't you glad
[1:41:29] for that so what is an heir an heir is
[1:41:33] one who receives his allotted possession
[1:41:35] by right of
[1:41:39] sunship an heir is one who receives his
[1:41:42] allotted possession by right of sunship
[1:41:46] yes and by adoption we've come into our
[1:41:50] inheritance oh my aren't you glad for
[1:41:54] that you see we are in full possession
[1:41:58] of our
[1:42:01] inheritance that's right this is what a
[1:42:03] people is coming to in this day we
[1:42:05] coming in full possession you see the
[1:42:07] Rapture could not take place in the
[1:42:10] other ages it had to wait for this age
[1:42:13] for sons of God to come in to their full
[1:42:16] possession of their
[1:42:18] inheritance the body chain all all of
[1:42:21] these things that we're looking at so
[1:42:23] brother brand said here he is among his
[1:42:26] church today made flesh in his church
[1:42:29] certainly
[1:42:31] Elohim he said now oh if you could only
[1:42:33] realize that you men you were made to be
[1:42:36] an amateur God you're a Son of God
[1:42:38] you're an heir of God you have a
[1:42:42] domain he's speaking to all of
[1:42:45] us we have a
[1:42:49] domain Genesis 1:26 he gave him dominion
[1:42:53] over everything in the earth he made him
[1:42:55] a God over the Earth that's right he
[1:42:57] give him a domain he's a king God and
[1:43:01] where he got the his fall see he could
[1:43:03] speak to the trees be chained be plucked
[1:43:06] up and set over here to the winds and
[1:43:08] the waves be still and it stop he was a
[1:43:10] god an amateur God a Son of God like you
[1:43:13] are a son of your
[1:43:15] father like what brother brandham said
[1:43:17] and I'm getting ready to
[1:43:19] close brother brandham said what we need
[1:43:22] in this hour is a man to challenge the
[1:43:25] promise of God before the
[1:43:29] people we don't want some water down
[1:43:32] gospel right right we want a gospel
[1:43:35] that'll challenge
[1:43:37] us this is where we're at
[1:43:42] yeah amen can you say
[1:43:45] Amen do you love the Lord
[1:43:48] yes we can make it
[1:43:53] we've talked about them 10 spies
[1:43:56] and how that they' went over into the
[1:43:58] land they partook of that evidence but
[1:44:01] they came
[1:44:02] back and they showed that they were
[1:44:06] unbelievers 2 and a half million come
[1:44:08] out strong out of Egypt but when it come
[1:44:12] time to go into the promise into their
[1:44:14] inheritance they showed to be cowards
[1:44:17] the prophet said he called them
[1:44:19] cowards because they were afraid they

[1:55:25] the Holy Ghost has come he will bring
[1:55:27] these things to your memory show you
[1:55:29] what day you're living in see and then
