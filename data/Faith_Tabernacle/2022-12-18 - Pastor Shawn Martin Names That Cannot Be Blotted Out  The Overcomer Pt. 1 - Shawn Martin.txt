aren't you glad your name is written down the man before the foundation of the world amen and tell you what that means a lot to us amen well I trust everyone had a good uh afternoon and come just to glorify the name of the Lord amen I don't believe that we have too many days left to uh in this Mortal life to worship him and I certainly want to give it all I've got amen take every opportunity to come together and to love him amen the musicians can be dismissed and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to uh The Book of Revelations the third chapter amen it's just uh it's pretty cold outside here we're supposed to maybe getting some snow at the end of the week amen might even have a white Christmas you never know praise the Lord amen everybody's dreams will come to pass amen before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord precious Lord with thankful Lord to know that our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life father and Lord to know that you have come to redeem us father and were the subjects Lord that you've come to get and how our hearts are full of anticipation father to be with you and we're answering the call we've heard the the Midnight Cry and oh God we're just looking forward to the future but Lord we're just asking that you would be with us tonight and help us Lord as we Endeavor to speak the gospel to your people and I pray father that you had not only blessed the the speaker but the hearer as well Lord may you have complete control of the services our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen the uh Revelations the third chapter and we're going to start at the first verse and unto the angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and are dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life that I will confess his name before my father and before his angels amen you can have your seats this evening and tonight I I want to deal with the overcomer uh that my title though is names that cannot be blotted out and but I'm going to deal with the Overcomer especially in this day and the reason um I read this scripture even though it is addressed to the Sardis Church age uh it also brother Branham says that the rewards that are given to every each Overcomer in each age belongs to us so we don't look at it as well this was given to that age but that it it applies uh to the Overcomer in this laodicean age now I'm just going to look at the the the promises uh that that was given in each age uh first the first church age Revelations uh there uh 2 7 I believe it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God the second Church age in the 11th chapter he that overcometh shall not be heard of the second death the Third Church age in the 17th verse to him that overcometh I will give to eat of the Hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and in this Stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receives it the fourth Church age in the 26th verse he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end to him will I give the power over the Nations and shall he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as a vessel of a Potter shall they be broken into Shivers even as I received of my father than the fifth Church age uh uh chapter three and five he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not uh blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and the Holy Angels the sixth Church age 312 he him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go out no more um and I will write upon him my name the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is the New Jerusalem which cometh down from heaven Out of Heaven from God and I will write upon him my new name the seventh Church age 21st verse to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcome and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear and and every every time he addresses at the end of the age and dressed the Overcomer he that hath in here let him hear what the spirit said to the churches ain't that right so the Overcomer of this age against all the rewards and they're there there may have been just very few Overcomers which uh there has just been very very few Overcomers but yet nonetheless God has had Overcomers and so brother Graham said God has had Overcomers in every age and there's always everybody say always every time in every age that's that there's been on Earth God has always had somebody he could put his hands on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness so an overcomer is a witness a man it's that's what that's what he is though sometimes just one just one Overcomer just one witness but God's always had one and he said but somebody overcome now like the Saints of old ain't that right so again God's going to have an overcomer in this layout of CN age because he addresses that Overcomer it it may be very few amen and if it is very few it does not break scripture because there's always been just a few uh down of Overcomers down through the age amen but the Overcomer in this age I believe is important uh uh because the the Bible says they without us cannot be made perfect so all of the Overcomers at the other ages are looking to this age for Overcomer amen and and so just imagine that that we are the finale we God has saved the best for last amen God has saved the best for last in this age and and to know that he he knew you would make it in the the most difficult deceptive evil age uh yet he knew he knew that you could handle it ain't that right and uh not in your own self of course but so the the the the ones that overcome in the previous ages are depending on us uh uh to finish the the race a man that they've ran and here we are the Baton is in our hands and there's no other age to pass the Baton too this I guess that's what you'd call it the state the Baton whatever anyways it's it's uh you're the you're the finale and and so the Overcomer is the individual that breaks the mode of what is normal of of the routine the the Overcomer now you just think of that uh uh the world is Shifting in One Direction and we see that today uh everything is going in One Direction but the Overcomer uh is one that breaks that mold and breaks that routine and he he or she doesn't fit in with the world and neither do they tried to fit in with the world and and so they break uh uh uh the cycles of tradition they withstand the Overcomer withstands the evil spirit instead of being dominated by them they they're able to withstand them instead of being overcome and controlled by them they're able to withstand them and and throw them off can you say man or we will say as Jesus said cast them out ain't that right and and so we're looking at an age that people are literally going insane I uh you know and we were talking about that as was going home uh uh you know that that if a person wants to identify as a cat then then we just call them a cat and and and one lady says but but to do that she's talking to the school board to do that you are denying telling that child that there's no truth there's no facts there's there's nothing and you're you're just going by what your imagination tells you to do and that becomes truth to you but because just because you say it's true don't mean it's truth and and yet I was telling the family but this is where brother Branham said they are literally going insane to where they they'll they'll see what uh did the prophet say ants the the size uh uh Mountain High Mile High Ai and and Birds with wings as six city blocks long and and they'll see these things and it's all in their imagination and so they're already coming to these things you can't make a man you know you can't tell a man and say that he's a girl just because he says he's a girl a man it just ain't gonna work that way but but it's the insanity but yet the Overcomer is withstanding all of these spirits that are out there and and again it's not just it's not just the older uh generation uh but the young people uh uh middle-aged children uh uh whoever is the Overcomer they're withstanding the pressure there was standing the spirits there and it was standing they're not going to lose their mind like the world is they're not going insane like the world is they're not accepting lies like the world is and and even even the Bible says because they had a lot of love for the truth God would send them strong delusions if they had believed the lie and be damned and and and so all of these things are fulfillment of scripture but then there's that Overcomer a man that doesn't go that Direction She's he or she has got a different anointing she's a a different product ain't that right and so some teach that the church you know I just thinking of the Overcomers some teach that the church a man is is going to go through the tribulation that has to go through the tribulation uh in order to be purified but brother Brown says that's not true yes the church nominal the church natural yes they will have to go uh in uh in the tribulation uh for purification but not the bride of Christ now we know that the Sixth Seal is the the the uh tribulation seal and and there's one thing in that seal that you will not find amen and that is the bride of Christ amen the the the the Church of the Living God you'll not find uh uh them or or I'll say the Overcomer you'll not find them in that chapter in that in that seal amen because they're already gone into Glory ain't that right and and so uh uh brother Brown said that she has no need for purification uh Jesus says here in John 5 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past already passed from Death unto life ain't that right yes sir so Christ gave the promise that we would not have to stand in the Judgment amen I'm so glad for that I I don't know about you but that's that's a that's very comforting it's because that promise belongs to us it's it's not a it's not rubbing a rabbit's foot it's it it's not keeping the fingers crossed hopefully that that we're we're going to do this no it's a promise it's a security it's a it's a guarantee that the Overcomer will not go through the tribulation do you believe that amen yes sir see Christ freely took our place until we're absolutely free aren't you free amen Christ absolutely took our place that we're absolutely free now that's how we can overcome we're free how many is free tonight see we're free that's what makes us the Overcomer brother Brown said when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned how can he take me out of the pawn shop and got a clear receipt see so how can he be my redeemer take me from the pawn shop and the bro broker still say that I belong to him amen it can't happen you've got the receipt that you're you're paid for amen you're not acting like you're in bondage you're not sitting there with chains all around you amen you are free can you say man he that the sun is set free is free indeed ain't that right amen I you know if I can use that at this illustration you know we we sometimes we chain up our dog and and and you know he's uh or she she's you know uh well we've got five of them now Lord have mercy and and but we chain them up you know and and they want to go and and yet they're bound you know they can't go any further and finally they just sit there and lay down you know because they ain't going anywhere but the time that we set that dog free amen uh uh she doesn't still act bound I you know but she's she's running around everywhere she's happy she's free you know and I think well that's the same thing and I understand what brother man said about the crow a man how that Crow you know he had come to that certain spot a man then he got loose and and he would still come to that certain spot amen but I don't believe that the bride is there tonight amen I believe the bride is recognizing that she's free she's free she's free she's free she's free to believe she's free to to walk in the light she's free to Amen to accept what God has for her she's free can you say man well that's where the Overcomer is he the Overcomers understanding I am free amen from everything that the devil is has has tried to lay on me I'm free from his accusations I'm free from slavery I'm free from the sins I'm free my trap record is clean and I am free amen I believe that's the Overcomer a man realizing see amen he says now brother Brown says I've got a written receipt amen wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ and contact right so a minister asked brother Branham said how can you how can you say that the the bride uh is gone before the tribulation and brother Branham replied by giving him a scripture Matthew 27 51 uh uh and it says and behold the veil of the temple was written in Twain From the top to the bottom now brother Branham uh uh talking about that scripture says now that was the law that was the law and the veil had kept the congregation from being able to enter in amen uh uh uh into the holiest of holy the veil kept the congregation from the articles of God ain't that right a man uh kept him a man from there and only an anointed priest a man could enter in there uh uh once a year and that rhyme amen but the veil was rent from top to bottom showing that it was a supernatural act of God that that done and and now whosoever Will can enter into uh there and partake of his Holiness can you say amen amen how how else if it hadn't been for the blood of Jesus Christ how else couldn't we overcome amen if it had not been for that Veil being rimmed a man Beware Of The Mercy Seat would be exposed Amen to us amen and the atonement be applied amen how else can it happen ain't that right but the Bible says this that the Earth did quake and the Rocks were in and then what happened the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept a rose ain't that right and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now the prophet said now that is the elected bride amen that's that elected group that's that Overcomer a man they had waited in the ground for all them years amen but they had a promise a man of a resurrection ain't that right now so so not all the of the Jewish church amen rose out of the ground at that time only the elected only the Overcomer ain't that right amen now the prophet said they all made the same sacrifice they all was under the same uh uh under the shed blood of the lamb but there was an elected group and that elected group as soon as the event come that really believed in it with sincerity can you say amen amen anything that God uh uh uh showed there was that Overcomer that really believed it With all sincerity these that had really overcome sincerely making the same sacrifice that the rest of them made but in sincerity can you say man I think sincerity has a lot to do amen with our Christian walk I think even brother even the angel of the Lord told Brother Branham you must be more sincere ain't that right if there's every any time or every uh something that we need to look into our lives and that is how sincere are we about this gospel that we're we claim to live amen how sincere amen is our worship how sincere is our belief how sincere is our faith amen do we come to the house of God just just uh uh you know just uh uh mediocre or are we sincere in what we're doing are we sincere in our prayer are we sincere when we read the Bible are we sincere when we say Amen you see these things as life and death to us can you say man we're not just treating this as just a happy-go-lucky thing we're not just treating this as just a well you know okay it fits my schedule so I'll go I'll do this I'll do that but no that Overcomer is sincere ain't that right so sincerely making the same sacrifice that the rest of them made but in sincerity they overcame the things of the world so the prophet said when the propitiation correctly was made for them they were in Paradise until that time and when that time was made they had overcome and was resting oh my amen resting sleeping and many bodies of those that slept in the dust see amen slept they arose ain't that right well the prophet tells us about Daniel in the Old Testament how that he was an overcomer amen he was stood in that day yeah uh uh uh the the the evil in his day he withstood the laws of the land in his day you and you you all know the story that of Daniel and the things that he had to go through life wasn't easy for him amen he had to stand alone there was actually the prophet said only four Overcomers in Daniel's day and that was Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Abednego ain't that right only four out of a whole nation of Jews and you think well where why why ain't they doing it amen why why ain't they amen living a life it wasn't meant for them amen they were the ones that was the Overcomers in their day but that Overcomer held a promise him and God told uh uh Daniel there in Daniel 12 13 said to him go thy way till the end be for Thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days when the print shall come which will stand for the people Thou shalt stand in thy lot amen there so brother Brown said here it is Daniel this prophet of God saw the end time coming and he said Daniel you'll stand in your lot at that day amen I'm so glad there's a position for us every Overcomer God doesn't Forget You amen but there is a position there is a place for you can you say amen that's right see and he said Daniel you'll stand in your lot at that day and here he was come forth out of that Resurrection not all of Israel but the bright type of Israel ain't that right he says now the rest of Israel don't come forth until the general Resurrection amen so the Overcomer is the one that came up uh in that Resurrection out of the ground see so the Overcomer is is a special individual amen watch what's going to happen in this age First Corinthians 15 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we all shall be changed then you say man there's a place for you amen keep overcoming there's a promise for you ain't that right first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord amen then 20 Revelations 20 and 5 but the rest of the Dead not the Overcomer but the rest of the Dead live not again until the thousand years were finished can you say amen amen so there is a separation God puts the separation between the rest and the Overcomer ain't that right and every promise a man that God gives to the church he gives to the Overcomer because the Overcomer is the one that makes up the bride of Christ do you believe that a man say so uh uh we find brother Brown said at the coming of the Lord Jesus those who really loving or really loving is coming that's living for it when he appears in the sky the church that's dead in Christ shall rise and those will be changed in a moment and the rest of them will know nothing about it can you say amen amen think of that now at the coming of the Lord Jesus which we know where where we're at today and where we stand those who are really loving not lovers of pleasure not lovers of self but those who are really loving his coming can you say man that's living for it when he appears in the sky amen the church that's dead in Christ shall rise and those will uh be changed and the rest of them will know nothing about it amen now remember the they're in the scripture that we read in the New Testament that those Saints Rose and appeared uh uh to those in the city and brother Brown said the Rapture will be like that we'll see each other we'll see them amen the rest of the world won't see them who are we going to see those that have overcome that went into the ground amen when they rise first we are going to see them those Overcomers that state remain and are still overcoming and has not gone by the way of the Grave they're going to see them can you say man and the world will not see them they will know nothing about it amen but they're all my I'm waiting for that time are you waiting for that time yes sir he says see the rest of the world won't see them it'll be caught away as a secret going waiting for that time then returning back to the Earth for that glorious Millennium then the Thousand Years and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years and then come forth the general Resurrection where all Israel so he says look you there the 12 apostles the twelve break your hearts all represented and we ain't never uh he's got yet to that so so we find a man that that we're in the hour of this to happen that the dead in Christ I I I it could happen now it could be just any moment amen where the dead in Christ will rise first and begin to appear Amen to us that are overcoming in this age can you say Amen so blessed is he blessed is that man that overcomes in this last stage we see that that this is the age that they they put Christ out of his own church amen Revelations 3 20. Jesus says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me ain't that right so he's standing out of his own outside of his own church trying to get back in brother Brown said that's the most horrific picture it's a sad picture it's a it's it's it's terrible scene that Christ would be outside of his own church but if you notice he's calling to the Overcomer ain't that right amen yes sir all's not lost he's calling to that Overcomer amen and we've heard that voice amen come out of her my people amen who's he calling to the Overcomer come out of her amen I want want to sup with you I I wanna I wanna know you I want to commune with you I I want to share my power with you I can you say man amen so what does the Overcomer do amen he begins to come out amen because he's an overcomer and it's always at the end of the age that he speaks to the Overcomer he that overcomes now the prophet said his call is not to the church as a whole but it's to the individual he not she he she represents woman ain't that right and the church is the type of the woman but now he's calling for the Overcomer or the individual so it's showing that it's not a church thing it's not a group thing it's not a people thing it's an individual walk it's an individual thing can you say Amen whether Mom goes I'm gonna go whether dad and mom goes or if friends stay behind he's called me to go can you say amen amen there's a lot of times that we want to get involved with the with with group things ain't that right amen identify as a group but God is calling us to identify with his word as an individual amen I'm going to believe it sink or swim whether anybody believes it or not I'm still going to believe because I've heard the call amen coming to me ain't that right amen so the prophet said if it was to the church he would have said she that overcomes but it's he the individual that overcomes a man see the individual and the Overcomer that individual is the one who conquers now I you know uh uh people call it self-righteous people can call it whatever they want to amen but but see that Overcomer if he's going to overcome then he cannot have a passive Spirit about him amen if she's going to overcome she can't just have this easy go lucky uh attitude about life amen she's got to be he's got to be that individual's got to be a warrior at heart can you say amen amen to where I'm going to believe this whether people believe it or not I'm going to stand true to this amen if y'all wanna y'all just do what you want to but I'm staying right here amen No One's Gonna talk me out of it I'm gonna stay amen because I'm an overcomer a man the Overcomer is one who conquers and in speaking about faith being the victory that overcomes the world uh brother Branham said conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons so you you understand in your life what are you doing can you say man amen I have his Overcomers here amen so this is what's reflecting your testimony it's reflecting your actions it's reflecting your statement uh your character your nature everything about you a man to conquer if you're that Overcomer if I'm the Overcomer a man that I am I am conquering which means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons I'm not here to Amen to to wallow in the muck in the mire I'm here to bring that thing into captivity I am not here to listen to negative thoughts I I'm bringing every thought under subjection to the word of God for I am an overcomer I'm not being influenced by just everybody amen the word is my influence the promises are my influence my faith is not based upon what I see what I hear what I feel my faith is based upon the word of the Living God ain't that right so we're bringing ourselves under uh uh in line with the word we're bringing this body we're bringing our testimony we're bringing everything in subjection to the word of God now brother Brown said to conquer it means that sin the sin that once ruled you you rule it now not slaves to sin no more you've been absolutely free but not just free not free to run from and but to free to control it are you with me yes sir so when that spirit of fear tries to get on you you have the power to rule that thing when the spirit of pornography gets upon you you have the spirit or the power Amen to bring that Spirit into subjection amen when when when unbelief tries to get a hold of you and starts tells you uh telling you that you can't be healed you have the very power to control that thing and to shut that Spirit up yes sir I just believe that you even as Believers as the Overcomer has power amen over your lost loved ones you parents that overcoming you've got the power amen over that child that wayward child do you believe that well I believe it amen because you it's it's your understanding amen you say well I try to talk to that child I try to talk talk talk and they ain't listening I don't care it's a spirit amen that is blind or deafening their ears from what you're trying to tell them that you have the power over that spirit amen to cast that thing out overcomer see the Overcomer is not passive he's not just living life happy-go-lucky with that attitude he's a warrior he's not that Driftwood that brother Branham talked about that's just floating along getting caught up in all the trash can you say man remember what brother Branham said that God is not some old uh Dodie grandfather amen you know that that thinks that his grandchildren is perfect no matter what they do amen that's not God and the world puts put paints God as that now God will just accept you it don't matter what you what you do it don't matter how you behave it just don't matter amen you're just accepted in the kingdom of God anyway we just you know but God doesn't do that amen how you going to overcome can you say man how are we going to overcome we're going to just act like everybody amen you just can't do it look at the character of this generation look at the character of this world Amen but I'm telling you young people you're not like this generation they can be disrespectful to the law but you're not part of that can you say Amen they can do whatever they want to but but you're an overcomer amen that's right see so brother Brown said God is a father he's a father of righteousness of Correction and love is always corrective ain't that right amen so so it's not that you know God just loves you and so you just do whatever you want to do and and and and and and you you you'll go to heaven amen and and that's so sad you know uh uh that that that that that people are are painting uh that and and people are being deceived because that's not true it it belongs to the Overcomer the Rapture belongs to them that overcome uh yes sir it does Amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force you realize you've got to fight the devil every day of your life you'll always have a sticky nature but you got to bring that nature under control can you say amen I know it gets tiring fighting but you've got to fight anyways God's counting on you amen the previous ages are captain on you brother shamaya we gotta fight this thing you say well it just doesn't maybe you know I I I just I just seem like I'm always making a mistake keep fighting ain't that right amen I'd rather you fight than just lay down let the devil whip you ain't that Ryan he may throw a punch every now and then but you know the battle's over you know you won the war it's already written You've Won ain't that right yes sir brother Brown talks about that log and he's seen in the woods that big old tree laying there in the water and he said you know he said I walked over there and looked strong looked great on the outside he said when I jumped on it big old piece of it just chunk of it just fell off you know and and and he said boy you know what what was it he said he'd been laying there dead so long until it was rotten on the inside he said the life had gone out of it and made it worse than ever when it was laid in the branch where the water was ain't that right and then he says this Christians are becoming that way they're becoming so soft they're becoming so rotten they're becoming so Dody a man he said they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become Dodie and they can't hold no weight at all give them a little trial and they fall apart give them a little something Amen to test them amen and they don't know what to do with it God will give God will shake a church God will shake a home God will shake a a people God will shake an individual amen because God doesn't want no panty waste individuals amen claiming to make it to heaven and God just sitting there accepting without no fight now I'm going to tell you something church I wouldn't even want to make it to Heaven if I can't fight my battles if I had no battles to fight if I had nothing to overcome I wouldn't want a man to make take it to heaven and hear all their stories of how they were fed to the Lions they were burned at the stake and yet they didn't deny God one bit can you say man amen let me have the battles but God helped me to overcome them help me to overcome them televisions help me to overcome that pornography I'm not saying I'm part of that I'm just trying I'm just mentioning there's things that people need to overcome and you've got to overcome if you're going to make it in this rapture overcome hard feelings overcome the arguments overcome the fashion and the fact overcome the pleasures of this world overcome materialistic things overcome it all can you say Amen see they've been dead and sinned trespassed so long till they become Doty they can't hold any weight they don't know what overcoming means and you say Amen you can be stuck at the at the speed bump all you want and just be stuck there be stuck at the roadblock and your life will never tell any difference your testimony will never speak any different than where you're at but the moment you start breaking down them roadblocks breaking down them barriers breaking down and moving past you watch your testimony start speaking of Advance if you're advancing in God your testimony will speak of it if you're advancing in God your life will speak of it can you say Amen if you're advancing in God your very actions will speak of it can you say man if someone is just sitting backslid I know they're not overcoming they're at a stop steal and they're dying and what they need to do is start overcoming amen and start moving on and advancing in the message of the hour praise the Lord you believe it now brother Brown said you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such is going on he rottens everybody say he rottens twice as quick see living right under so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the Life of Christ because if you don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it see the Bible says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him is sin so I want to tell you something God has given us the privilege of coming in the message of the hour but with that message you got to remember this is the only message that will tell you the truth this is the only message that's got all the truth so that means that we are a people that cannot have excuses we are a people a man that is without excuse whatsoever amen we know what to do we know what God expects of us can you say amen amen God doesn't want you sitting around talking down to God doesn't want you sitting around in the glooms and the and and and moaning in a groaning God wants you to take that gospel take that promise and put it to action I can't and I will amen it's mine amen every promise of God Is Mine act upon it talk on it think about it and you'll see something happening so so now listen he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin then you become Dodie everybody say Dodie rotten we don't want to be rottens rotten rotten Christians we don't want to be Dodie Christians he said but you become Dodie rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive everybody say strive strive with all that's in you don't don't don't be passive about this be very sincere strive with all that's in you to stay in the Life of Christ that you be fruit bearing can you say man so as we've said so many times it's this age that we're living in the most awfulest age sinful age greatest sinful Age The Prophet said than ever before there's more sin in this age than ever before it's all around us he says this the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against here in this age than it was in any other age now I've really thought of that now Church think of the age that God has placed you in amen the powers of darkness is more harder to fight in this age than any other age they were burned to the stake they were fed to the Lions they were flayed alive they were sold into Sunder and all that but it doesn't compare to the age that you're living in they overcome and yet God says there's going to be an overcomer in this age today do you believe that now amen and yet the prophet is telling us the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight amen here in this age than it was in any age why the enemy has come in the name of the church amen that's right and it's so deceiving it's the greatest age of deception Amen to where a Christian now the name Christian people can be Christians and still watching their movies they can be Christians and still amen are looking at the filth they can be Christians and still swearing to God they can be Christians and still lighting up cigarettes and Vapors and marijuana and all of that stuff amen and see that thing is trying to get on us amen maybe we do not make you go out and drink but maybe you set there as a church member without a real experience with God where you can't believe God anymore amen when you're tested amen and you're facing uh uh impossible situations let me ask you do you have the faith to look and say I know God will I know God will regardless of the situation I hope I'm making sense to you I'm gonna have to be overcomer Jesus said the deception would be so close that even the elect would be deceived if it were possible now brother Brown said this people so live they they can live a clean life holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers liars and gamblers they can live above that and still not with it amen so the sins don't don't mean that you're smoking you're drinking and looking at the pornography and and whatever the in got all these women's and strip clubs and you can live above all of that go to church and still not be with it and you say man now again Jesus spoke of the elect that's not going to be deceived now one thing about this brother Brown said this is the age of life everybody say this is the age of life the personal life of Christ can you say man now look Luke 11 24 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith I'll return unto my house once I came out and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished then go with he and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first now you know what that's saying that's why this age is the worst age ever now brother Branham Likens that to the church he said that's exactly what the church has done Baptist Methodist and those who believed in sanctification see then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this Church's body and finds the House Garner swept clean living Pure Clean lives right see all right he says but then if that house isn't filled occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was and the last stage of this place is seven times worse than it was at the first place they had been better to stay Lutheran than it would have been to receive the light and to follow it see or and fail to follow it so will the Pentecostal see you know what I mean the house is garnished ain't that right so many churches he goes on to talk about how many churches Holiness churches and all that they won't even say holy ghost they're afraid to say holy ghost say they say holy spirit ain't that right amen and and and we know that Holy Ghost holy spirit is the same thing amen but Brethren Brown said they won't say holy ghost because they don't want to identify themselves with Pentecostals they don't want to be identified with them tongue-speaking people and that's the Holy Spirit itself ain't that right so he says notice the enemy that went out under sanctification that was washed out returned back and found the house not filled with the Holy Spirit now the state of the church is joined with the league of churches with the World Council of churches and it's a state now that connects it with Roman Catholicism and all the rest of it and now it's seven times worse than it was when it come out of Lutheranism ain't that right the churches in this age are seven times worse and they're all uniting with with uh the mama Catholicism ain't that right so so we know that there's something that's driving them people doing that there's driving them organizations there's driving them ministers to to tell the people it's okay uh uh let's go back let's let's take all the walls down let's let's tear down our barriers and we're all one we're it's a demon that is talking and it's showing you a man that that man that church that religion organization they're seven times worse than what it was in Luther's day ain't that right so now now he goes after this layout of sin Church age has received the Holy Spirit and with the knowledge and the spirit of God within it what does it do it denies the works of God and calls it an evil work ain't that right we know the Holy Spirit fell on on Azusa Street we know what happened there amen but now when God would send a prophet amen and and and show himself as the same Melchizedek as before Abraham would come in this day and he would begin to manifest himself amen the people doesn't want it they they they they they they they they they they just don't want it ain't that right and so he says see there is where Christ is put out of his own church it never showed him in the church until it come to laodicea and when he got to laodicea he had been put out of his church trying to get back in amen see justification never put him back in sanctification never put him back in ain't that right it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that put him in the the people ain't that right but they turned him out when he began to show himself as the same yesterday today and forever the people didn't want that they called it a devil they called it whatever and and it's because they didn't he Christ didn't agree with their their organizations and their rituals and and all of these things ain't that right so the life the same life that was in the beginning and in Christ amen when when he that life began to manifest itself they didn't want it they turned it out can you say man now look at them they're dead rotten seven times worse than when they started ain't that right so we can understand why brother Brown stay in the life stay in the life amen stay with that life whatever you do stay in the life can you say amen amen that's right and where is the life we're the signs and wonders are amen where Christ himself is ain't that right yes sir see so we find uh uh when you separate yourself from the life of Jesus Christ amen then you become rotten and Dodie and what happens you'll never be able to overcome you cannot and I'll say this way you cannot overcome just by knowing the Bible you can read this Bible year around and and you still can't won't that don't mean you can overcome you don't overcome by knowing all the quotes you don't overcome but you gotta stay in the life ain't that right a man's eight now you can still be religious but not an overcomer now we don't want to be just religious we want to be an overcomer and you say man and I'm going to tell you this I'll tell you what amen God doesn't maybe always knock on your your you know our little brain and say okay this is me now I'm going to see what you're going to do but God always put you through tests I don't care what it is it could be on your job it could be at your home it could be you know uh uh uh uh with with husband or wife it could be with children it could be whatever God will always put us to the test to see how we respond we don't always now we're not always just to respond in Christian ways at the church great we ought to be Christian at home we ought to be Christian at the work good job we ought to be Christian and whatever and we've got to be able to know when the test comes and how to respond to that [Music] and you say Amen talking about overcoming praise the Lord I hope it's all right so you can't overcome so again the prophet said we should live constantly in the Life of Christ so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life so when you hear that Jesus come unto me come come out of her my people why they denied the life they've rejected the life come to the life get out of that which is dead and rotten and Dody don't get in that atmosphere you you'll you'll die there can you say Amen there's no overcoming power in them denominations there is no overcoming I want to just say it there's no overcoming in Holiness churches it doesn't matter how Holiness you dress if you're away from the life you'll never be able to overcome anyways this is the age of life this is the token time ain't that right and the token must be on display and you know what the token display is you overcoming then you say amen that's right now so when we're looking at this life because brother Brown said stay in the Life stay constantly in that life don't separate from that life so he's letting us know the life is important good to have morals it's good to have Holiness it's good to have standards but for life don't let the life leave you stay in the life can you say Amen oh Lord have mercy this life can't destroy this this life can't thrive you feeding off them movies life can't this life can't thrive feeding off all the worldly junk can you say Amen just can't do it just can't so now this life that we're speaking of is a greater life than this Earthly life ain't that right this Mortal life has sin and Corruption it has death in it and comes to in its end now we're talking about an overcomer now we're not talking about religion not religious folks we're talking about Overcomer they'll overcome her now this natural life this you know you can serve God by natural ability natural conception natural intellect natural everything um but you'll die because that's not the life he's talking about this life is a life that don't end can you say man amen that which is natural dies that which is carnal dies it cannot last but we're talking about another life that is pure ain't that right a life that is superior to everything else might have a genius mind but you're gonna die and all your accomplishments will die with you there's no lasting value to it ain't that right but this life that I'm talking about is an endless life yes sir and the the Overcomer thing of it the Overcomer has access to this life ain't that right you realize Jesus had this life and he was an overcomer he did not overcome by natural life he didn't overcome by natural conception he didn't overcome by natural intellect he overcome by the life of God that's right see he was an overcomer and he said as I have overcome the world so you shall overcome the world so every Overcomer is just like he is can you say Amen as I have overcome so that means to tell us that as I have overcome you shall overcome he's telling you you're made of the same product hello you're made of the same product so it doesn't matter to him that you're in the most evil age ever the most deceptive age as I have overcome so shall you ain't that right yes sir see so that's why he didn't see corruption because the life he had raised him up from the dead and the Overcomer will never see that corruption I'll just say it the Overcomer will never be rotten and Dodie damn because it's a life that is endless ain't that right no to see the Overcomer is life of his life power of his power bone of his bone right she is him yes sir if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead that same spirit will also Quicken your mortal body you believe it now notice first John 5 4 for whosoever is born everybody say he is born of the world of God I didn't give you those two these two scriptures but whosoever is born of God overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith ain't that right yes sir so the Overcomers got an undying faith notice first John 4 4 you are of God little children you're born of God you are of God and have overcome them why because greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world then you say Amen so the Overcomer is made in the same likeness as Jesus made from the same material as Jesus is do you believe that now if you allow me some more time for just a few moments according to Hebrews 7 17 Jesus Christ was made after the similitude of Melchizedek which was not made after the con the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life what was he made after about the power of an endless life then you say amen I went and looked up endless it means not subject to destruction Jesus wasn't subject to destruction that's why he could say destroy this body and in three days I will raise it up ain't that right now let's go on here in in in in in in of course in Hebrews the seventh chapter there Paul is showing the difference between the little levitical priesthood and and and Jesus who is our high priest ain't that right he's showing that there is a difference and I'm going to just dwell on that for a month there is a difference can you say Amen why he was not made after them he was not made after a carnal commandment he was not made by law he was made by the power of an endless life yes sir now notice Hebrews 7 15 and it is far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek their ariseth another priest speaking of Jesus Christ ain't that right now see so now this isn't not meaning that he was just another priest as the ones before him there ariseth another priest okay yeah right we we've had priests after priest for all generations but no that's not what Paul is saying amen he's showing that this is a different priest ain't that right he was a stranger in the house of Aaron the word arises because he says here Paul says there arise if another priest and the word arises means to be brought forth in an extraordinary manner he wasn't brought forth through the gene seed of of levitical of Leviticus of Levi hello this arising is an extraordinary see he was brought forth in an extraordinary manner see so there arises another priest so so this isn't meaning again that Jesus was just another continuation of what had been and I want to say this we have had Church brother Brown says churches churches Brides brides but I want to set this weight there ariseth another church can you say Amen there arises another bride oh my that's right there arises can you say man in other words she's brought forth in that extraordinary manner [Applause] we've had churches churches Brides brides revivals revivals but there ariseth another bride can you say Amen well it's true so here we find a man that that see this church this Overcomer this body that is standing here today of Jesus Christ amen is is is not just another typical church that we've had in the previous ages hello this just doesn't just have the mechanics that has also got the Dynamics do you believe that she's got both mechanics and Dynamics this is a different Church that's right and with all the previous churches and all the previous revivals they've died where's the lutherans to date dead where's the Methodist today they're dead where's the Baptist today they're dead they once live but they're dead but this bride this church will never die she's made after the power of an endless life and you say man so every individual that makes up this bride is the is the Overcomer now notice Paul said there Rise is another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life for he testifies thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek for there is verily a disannoying of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by which we draw nigh unto God can you say Amen so I want to put it this way the rising of Christ the arising of another priest put an end to the levitical priesthood showing that he was not part of that levitical priesthood he was another priest brought forth in an extraordinary manner and he put back levitical priesthood the law to rest God have mercy then you say amen and why did he do it because the levitical priesthood that law that thing had no power to make perfect it had no power to bring him uh in God's mind to completion you say Amen so he put it an end to that which was weak and didn't have the ability to perfect ain't that right so as one writer says the levitical priesthood was set aside for one infinitely Superior which was set up by God himself can you say Amen the power of an endless life in other words there would be no end to him amen one priest would rise and then he would die at another priest but this priest there's no end to him can you say Amen One Church would come and a church would die a church would rise a church would die but this church you amen that you're a part of will never die and you say amen and I got to tell you this revival that we're part of will never die it will never die can you say Amen history records of all other revivals dying after a few years but this is a miracle this is a paradox but you're not of just another church you're made after the power of an endless life Luther couldn't bring us to perfection hello all the church ages they had no power to bring God's thoughts to to completion but here we are what God had in his thoughts are being manifested right here it's time to go home I hope this is all right there would be no end to him he was made after the power of an endless life what was he was a predestinated seed of God do you believe that predestinated before the foundation of the world and so here we find that the error the Aaron priesthood the levitical priesthood was set up according to the law of fleshly Commandments amen but Jesus was not set up according to the law amen he abolished the law he set that aside he put that to silence can you say Amen now Ephesians 2 13 but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Jesus Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished everybody say having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinance for to make in himself of Twain one new man Soul Making Peace ain't that right no other priesthood could do this but he's the one that done it he abolished sin he abolished the iniquity he abolished it all to where you are absolutely free there's no guilt there's no condemnation it's not putting you the the gospel is not putting you back in prison again like the law did but it's telling you you have been pardoned by the blood of Jesus Christ you are no longer longer in the pawn shop amen you are now at fellowship and Oneness with God again and he didn't come after the order of Aaron he didn't come to that lineage see the little levitical priesthood was a lineage of priest father and son right and then then it goes down to son grandson great-grandson and on and on and on it was a lineage but Jesus didn't come through the lineage he was made after the power of an endless life can you say man oh do you love him predestinated before the world ever began and I'll be honest I'll tell you this as the musicians come our Christian walk has nothing to do with our genealogy it has nothing to do with our natural family tree it has nothing to do with what what Mom and Dad were it has nothing to do with what the pastor was it had nothing to do with whatever amen the church can fail the church can what whatever amen people can fail the preacher can fail mom and dad can fail deacons can fail but it doesn't affect me amen for I am made after the power of an endless life can you say man and I tell you what I don't care how bad it gets there's going to be an overcomer she can't die them Overcomers cannot die them Overcomers are just as you know they're they're better than the energizing Energizer rabbit you know amen they just keep going and going and gone you give them whatever trial and they're just moving and keep them moving and keep them moving you'll never find them so discouraged words that to just give up that ain't gonna happen they're made after the power of an endless life they were brought forth in an extraordinary manner can you say man and I just know this this church is going to be completed and they that are waiting on us are going to come to Perfection because there is an overcomer in this age oh do you love him oh can you lift your hands unto the Lord and worship him love him Hallelujah undying love that we have toward him an undying faith that we have Hallelujah and it's something that is not just oh my it's something that has made us to be we're made this hallelujah we're made Believers we're made over conquerors we're made Hallelujah Victors in Christ amen amen amen I don't care how dark the night is we're making it through it I don't care what it is what mountain you're coming up against amen it just looks like it just ain't gonna happen but it's going to happen we're Overcomers oh God you love him we never did begin he was never saved on any given day you were made after the power of an endless life Hallelujah you urged and started in the beginning you were always with God Hallelujah you can't fail in the Lord wonderful amen what song we've been made more than conquerors Overcomers in this life we've been made Victorious [Music] can we sing it again we've been made more than conquerors [Music] Overcomers in this life Hallelujah we've been made Victoria's through the blood of Jesus Christ sing it now we've been made more than conquerors Overcomers [Music] through the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] I pledge allegiance to the thought s [Music] I will seek to honor yes oh I pledge allegiance [Music] can you sing that with your heart oh I pledge allegiance Hallelujah with all my strength with everything I am I will seek to honor his command oh I pledge allegiance to the lamb will I have heard how Christians long ago were brought before a tyrant's throne they were told that he would spare their lives if
