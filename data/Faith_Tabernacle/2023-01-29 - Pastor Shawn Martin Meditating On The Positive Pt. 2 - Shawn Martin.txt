progresses in God and and I just love the Lord a man and I I know you do and it's just good to be in the house of God today and certainly enjoyed the songs the musicians can be dismissed but it's just enjoyed the worship the songs and the presence of the Lord and and we need him don't we amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn to the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter amen Hebrews the 11th chapter and we're going to read the sixth verse praise the Lord and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to her Lord father we're so glad that we serve a living Christ and that our experience isn't a yesterday experience it isn't something of history but it's a continuing every day Lord that we're walking with you we're experiencing you in a a different way on another level and father we're so glad Lord that you just keep revealing yourself and it just causes us to love you more Lord the times that we fail and you pick us back up we just fall in love with you more father and I pray Lord that you would just be with us this evening as we would Endeavor to preach the gospel and I pray Lord that you would take the simple words that I have and just let it go in deep into the Heart Lord and that we would be better Christians father we we not hear just to waste time of seeing one another and hearing each other sing Lord everything that we do is for your glory and to honor you and oh God may you just feel welcome now and and just do a creative work in our hearts Lord it's our prayer may your spirit just settle down upon the building Lord and every pew father and and just touch your people we ask these things in your gracious name Jesus Christ amen Hebrews the 11th chapter in the sixth verse it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him amen you can have your seeds without faith faith of course is the is the key key ingredients I believe uh for anything of the Christian walk you you must have faith and Love worketh by faith everything works by faith now I'm going to use the title again that we use last Sunday evening and that's meditating on the positive and Philippians 4 and 8 we know this very scripture well but it says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things so of course I I believe that this is showing that we we must be able to discern uh what is good and what's bad and and I think our whole Christian Life it it's it takes discernment and and so we must know what is good what's a virtue what's what's of strength what things are honest what things are pure what things are just what things are of a good report what things have virtue have praise and these are the things that we are to think on so so we we we must Cipher through things a man and now Paul is speaking to the church here there in in really I guess both both uh uh Scriptures it was Paul writing and and the church is made up of people who have a new birth and uh they have been baptized into one body by one spirit and so uh the church that's what separates people uh that are part of the church uh from everyone else is they've received that new birth by the spirit of God and so uh this is what Paul is speaking of and speaking to and so God has a law uh that man must live by his church must live by and and so uh and if he lives by that law then it will actually work for him and and so I know of unconverted men that have practiced the principles of the Bible they have put the principles of God's law to work and it's it's actually been fruitful for them in in ways um I I believe it you know our military has has or I've heard of military using uh scriptures and and applying that to military strategy and and it has worked for them uh we have found that even businessmen uh apply uh you know have applied the laws of God and it's worked for them and and their their the laws of God work ain't that right and so uh but you know I believe that the Bible even though it is has an effect for everyone in in to a certain degree but I I believe that the Bible was written for for the Believers uh the children of God the Church of God and um and and so and and if the church will walk according to God's law I believe they will have more success than what an average person would using the scriptures I because I believe that they they have the spirit of God within them and and if the word is written to the bride of Christ to the church uh because really Brown said it is a love letter it's it's there then they will actually get the results that the promises are intended for I tended to have and so I believe that tonight I am speaking to uh Christians and Christians believe the word of God and so I I believe that you you believe the word of God tonight and so um uh now the world teaches uh positive thinking and and yet while all along denying uh the word of God and and and there there is a degree of being positive in the natural but uh and and that may be okay but it has its limits and there are you know certain people that you I'm sure all of us have met that uh maybe don't even know the Lord don't don't claim to know the Lord but yet they're positive they they're just upbeat they have this positive attitude about everything you know and and you think man that's that's nice and and uh and yet they don't even claim to know God or anything but there is a positiveness about them and they they have that positive attitude and and I you know I I think it's good to be positive I I just believe that you don't you know it's it's tough being around someone that's always negative and talking negative and thinking negative and acting negative and and uh you know it's it's just um because brother random says that we all create an atmosphere yeah we every one of us is a Creator and you can either create a depressing attitude or an atmosphere of depression of of just Doom and Gloom or you can create a positive attitude an atmosphere that's right well if if the unbeliever has that and and well I I just tend to think that every Christian ought to be positive and and even though that may go against your nature yet there is a spirit of God that's in US the spirit of God is positive do you believe that when it comes to promises the spirit of God is Promised is positive when it comes to the word of God the spirit of God is positive there's well brother Brown said there's nothing negative in Christianity there's nothing and and so we're not talking of positive thinking in the way the world would think about that but we are talking about positive because if you have the Holy Ghost again then you you you you have to be positive again you say bad you have to be positive now you know uh in the natural all of us are given five senses um and and um and you know these are senses are given to us by God to help us get along in the world and uh and by these five senses we can be positive it it actually there's to a certain degree we can actually be positive I am positive I am positive that you're here tonight and I'm positive by that because I see you my eyes declare that you're here and not only that my ears declare that you are here at least some of you because I hear you amenity or chocolate rosam's here and so uh uh but but these senses help us to become positive uh to you know taste is positive right um uh you you can uh you know you you can eat a uh macaroni and cheese and and you you don't even have to you know you don't have to see it you don't have to feel it just taste it and I guarantee you you know if it's you know uh uh macaroni and cheese I would anyways you know but but it it becomes positive you can tell the difference just through taste whether it's orange juice or apple juice you can tell the difference because the your sense of taste uh declares to you what is the difference and you can be so positive about it right that you don't have to see it just just take a dream amen and someone can question about well how do you know well I know because I tasted it in my my taste bud declares what it is see and and so then hearing is positive as well you can tell the difference between an organ and a piano at least most of us can I guess and and when you hear in the piano you say oh I like that piano you know you you could even hear it on a tape and and you know you don't have to see it you don't have to but you can recognize it by by your hearing and you can become so positive about about it that you just automatic say man that's a that's a good piano player or horrible you know whatever but but you identify it as being a a piano or an organ or whatever because you're able to tell the difference feeling is positive you know I I've thought of reading the story of Fanny Crosby that could not see and yet uh she learned to by feeling a certain leave she could take a leaf you can give a relief and she would feel it and she could tell you what tree that leaf came from my feeling just feeling but she would become so positive to that and and so smell is positive um of certain things you know you you don't have to say it that way before you see it you can say boy that's cigarette smell you know someone's smoking a cigarette well why because the smell of that thing is it declares to you what it is and you become positive I I remember you know or I don't remember dad remembers you know Mom and and we I was just a little guy and we was at a restaurant and someone was smoking and dad says man Jolene someone's smoking somewheres and I just got up and looked around and it was the next door guy and I said here he is right here Dad he's the one that's smoking sit down son you know uh but but I've Vindicated what he was smelling you know but he declared it before he ever saw it see and and so these senses but yet our senses are limited and our senses can play tricks on us too ain't that right they can play tricks and and so Satan will actually use our senses against us ain't that right to calls it to declare something that ain't there now if if you can you know because he will use our senses to doubt God's word ain't that right and then when Satan starts getting a hold of our senses and then he starts getting us to become negative toward God's word ain't that right it's it's unbelief is is what it is see in a negative way then when the doctor says you know uh you you're sick you know or uh there's you're gonna die and well you know you you just heard that and and if you're not careful Satan will play on that and before you know it you become so positive that you're gonna die you you you because you heard what the doctor said you heard the bad report ain't that right and and you become positive in a negative way you get sick you get um you know whatever some things happen and you know maybe uh uh you're seeing just uh and and things just keep coming and coming and like they say when it rains it pours and and before you know it you you become negative so negative that you don't think you'll ever make it through it right yeah and so so what we hear sometimes is not always true what we hear sometimes is not always Akron what we hear what we see it's it's it's these things so uh uh you know you you brother Branham even talked about it of how that maybe you'll see someone or hear someone or of someone praying they're sick and they're praying to get well and they're believing I'm uh you know they they confess and then they get sick and then they die and and then you get sick and then it's comes time for you to accept your healing brother Brown said Satan will come to you and and and show it to you and then all of a sudden you start remembering well I remember so and so how they confess their healing and how they prayed for healing and they died right and before you know it it begins to affect you so you you can't always be led by your senses your five senses ain't that right so we we find that um uh being positive uh must be based on the word of God you do not walk with by your five senses you don't walk with God by your five senses these these five senses are Earthly they are to help you get along in life ain't that right but you are not to be led by your five senses ain't that right see you you cannot we we cannot claim our healing by our five senses we cannot claim our salvation by our five senses we cannot claim uh uh our deliverance by our five senses you you cannot even claim the Rapture by your five senses can you say Amen because see the promises of God can only be positive by faith ain't that right and that's what we read now without faith you can go you can go out well you can go without all your five senses but without faith you can't please God you you don't have to have the sense of sight to please God but you have to have faith ain't that right these five senses can go uh uh but but Faith a man is what pleases God and if you notice uh Jesus said all things everybody say all things are possible to them that have good smell or that God have good hearing no it's by faith all things are possible to them that believe so that tells us that faith is a sense brother Branham called it the sixth sense and it's Superior than any other sins can you say man now so so we we find that in Hebrews 6 and 12 Paul tells us to be followers of them who through faith and patience everybody say faith and patience inherit the promises not by your senses not by how you feel not by by what you see not by what you hear but by faith and patience they inherit the promises of God and and we are to be followers of them ain't that right so you cannot get in you can't get anywhere in God without faith that's right for faith is positive and it's more positive than anything else ain't that right your eyes will play tricks on you you're you're hearing will play tricks on you to what you think you heard it and maybe you really didn't hear it everything can play tricks on you ain't that right because Satan it's it's of the carnal man and this old carnal man is not regenerated your soul is regenerated ain't that right that's right and if you don't have a control tower down in your soul a man Satan can have Heyday with the five senses of the Flesh and he can have Heyday with the five senses of your your spirit which is memory conscience affection uh the other two uh reasoning and and and these things so so but faith is is based upon the word of God and as we talked about last Sunday the word of God never fails Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away ain't that right so then God wants us his church a man to be founded upon the word of God that cannot fail ain't that right so then as the prophet says when when your your five senses disagree with the word stay with faith and ignore your five senses when when the spirit your senses of your spirit ignores the word and gets away from the word ignore that and ignore all of that and stay with the word of God ain't that right yes sir see so because faith is positive because it's founded upon the word of God now brother Brown said faith is the only direct and positive sense and it's the Sixth Sense faith is more positive than sight faith is more positive than feeling you do not feel Faith you do not taste Faith you do not smell Faith you don't see Faith but yet faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things uh not seen ain't that right faith is so now now Faith what is Faith the prophet said faith is knowing faith is knowing if you're hoping that's not faith if you're wishing that's not Faith you know I want to be a Christian that's not Faith well I I really you know I'm I want to be healed that's not faith I'm really you wishing you know I'm hoping I'm you know I'm I'm uh uh you know wanting to be in the Rapture but that's not Faith see faith is knowing everybody say faith is knowing faith is knowing so so when you have faith you know it's it's settled it's done it's a finished thing that's Faith ain't that right so if you have faith and you know beyond any Shadow of Doubt amen so faith is beyond what you see feel hear smell taste it is more positive than any of those things now I read to you and I'll I'll put it up on the screen but Hebrews 11 1 it says now now read it with me now Faith is the substance what substance of things hoped for say that again faith is the substance of things hoped for faith is the substance of what you are hoping for and you say Amen so without faith you don't have substance but if you have faith and you have the substance ain't that right you want healing faith is the substance you want Deliverance faith is the substance you you you want your hearing to get better faith is the substance you want to be healed of arthritis faith is the substance you want to be healed of heart disease faith is the substance can you say amen that's right see uh uh uh so so you want the Holy Ghost faith is the substance if you want an apple tree the apple seed is the substance of what you're looking for ain't that right amen yes sir if you want a loaf of bread the money that's in your pocket is the substance of what you're looking for that's right and then when you've got the substancy well then what what do you have you already have it ain't that right if you want corn but all you have is is the seed well it's in your hand then you have the substance in your hand so in all reality you have the corn that you're looking for amen it's the substance ain't that right so then as the prophet said you can be just as happy that you have the corn having the substance as you would the crop why because the seed is the substance of the crop you're looking for so you cannot have anything from God without faith amen look at all the the miraculous things that happened in the Old Testament and in the in in the New Testament but looking at the Old Testament Paul tells us how it was it was by faith that the Jericho walls came down it was by faith a man that that Sarah received life it was by faith a man that now that Shem sham guard was able to defeat the enemy it was by faith that Gideon was able to bring Israel a man into victory over the enemy it was by faith ain't ain't that right see by faith the Hebrew boys escaped the fiery furnace by faith and that same faith is here tonight ain't that right so you you can't look at them maybe they're Our Heroes but they're not super men they're not super women they are literally women and men just like you are that have the same faith that you have by faith the Bible says Abraham considered not the deadness of of Sarah's womb he he not he uh uh he he considered not his own body now dead ain't that right because he had the substance of the promise he was looking for by faith ain't that right see so Faith gives us a it causes us to act differently it causes us to think differently it causes us to speak differently because it's the substance of things hoped for ain't that right so we we find that Abraham rejoiced he praised God he made confession before he saw any sign of physical evidence hello my I think that's powerful amen you know brother Branham would tell us how Abraham maybe go to Sarah you know every morning how are you feeling Sarah well no different we'll praise God we're having it anyhow amen he had the booties made he had everything ready for that baby and yet he didn't know when it was coming but that didn't matter time did not matter to Abraham because he already had the substance can you say amen he already had the substance so as far as he was concerned it was already done yes sir ain't that right amen see so so then we find now faith faith is founded on a different knowledge than what our senses are founded upon the doctor tells you you know that you're going to die with cancer to tuberculosis or whatever see and and and uh well he gave you a knowledge and by that you heard that with your the hearing of your ear and and now you whatever choice you have the choice of what you're going to do with that knowledge but that knowledge did not come from the word of God that knowledge came from medical learning it came from scientific knowledge ain't that right see and so therefore and now now for him scientifically and medically he's done everything he can for you and so uh uh uh with that if there's no medical to help you if there's no science to help you or whatever then then as far as he is concerned you're a lost hopeless case you're a lost cause you're it's over with ain't that right amen but yeah we've heard testimony after testimony of people with stage four cancer that was dying that that couldn't even eat anymore that just had to lay there in the floor and yet 40 years later they're testifying that God Is A Healer can you say man but what what is it see well see our senses operate by that kind of knowledge but then Faith knows different amen than what the doctor says faith operates on a higher knowledge than what the doctor's knowledge is ain't that right that's why a man imperfect Faith the prophet would say you know that if you had that faith and the doctor told you Friday that you're going to die amen and he said about by Monday that's only three days four days uh three days and and he said you're gonna die by Monday you're you're going to be dead he said you would laugh in the doctor's face amen why because you have a greater knowledge that has been given to you ain't that right now you have the choice and what you want to believe in you can take the doctor's words and what he has learned from medical science or you can take God's word ain't that right so we we find that that faith is founded upon the word of God so no matter what the doctor says no matter what Doom and Gloom is and no matter what what we see with our eyes and feel with our feelings and and all of these things we are our faith is founded upon God's word and we know God's word is true how many believes God's word is true you believe you really believe that God's word is true when is it true as long as you're on the Mountaintop as long as the doctor gives you a clean bill of health is it true just as long as everything is going hunky-dory is it is it true just When the Children a man your family are serving the lord or is it true at all times the word of God never fails so then faith has to be founded upon something Rock Solid and everything around us is shifting sand ain't that right it's true and we even know that the medical doctor can be wrong they're constantly changing their ideas their opinions ain't that right because they're learning but God never learns he's infinite knowledge so whatever he says it's done it's settled it's it's over ain't that right now if that Faith or if that word can be dropped down into our soul it will give us a faith that will anchor us now I hope I'm making sense to you brother Brown said people don't know the first principle of faith he said come into the prayer line but yet they don't know the first principle of faith and he says 99 percent most of them well they I think he said 99 out of a thousand uh something to that he says they have hope instead of faith now then he in one place he says little timid hope lovely and sweet as she is yet she's the greatest enemy faith has you got a good name hope so don't take that we love you now bite us these things faith hope and charity there you go it's a little timid hope lovely as sweet as she is and yet she's the greatest enemy faith has that's right the greatest enemy faith God is Hope listen because a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from faith ain't that right they leave away from Faith you're not to be hopeful you're not to serve God In Hope right that's right ain't that right now we we expect challenges to come our way we're not promised uh uh a life of ease we're not promised something that is just everything going to be Rosy but we are promised the word of God now his word says I'll never leave you nor forsake you his word says I'm the god that healeth thee ain't that right every promise in this book is mine and without uh uh uh all things are possible to them that believe that's the word of God but see if if a person's not careful they become so hopeful till they leave away from faith cannot say and and if I can say it in a in a right way I do not do away with prayer if there's ever a time we need prayer it's now but people pray the wrong way I think they pray hoping that's right they pray but no matter do you realize you can pray without faith you can you can come to church without faith you can read this Bible without faith you can listen to the message without faith and and and the whole point is to inspire faith in you can you say man you are not to serve God by hope hoping I hope I hope maybe if I pray long enough I hope yeah amen now brother Ram says now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it I believe that's that that's the word of God I believe that God will keep his promise hope believes all of that right but then hope says now I believe that God will heal but look at my condition ain't that right but now Faith don't look at that come on now Faith don't consider the condition Faith don't consider what what is going on faith don't consider what the doctor just said I my mom has been a just a woman of faith uh all the way you know all her life and her brother died of cancer and and she's made the statement I won't die of cancer I won't and uh we say well that's good you know keep it up then she got cancer did her testimony change nope she ain't gonna die of cancer so she goes around I'm not going to die of cancer so and yet she would die I mean she was the the the we didn't know what was wrong with her but all of her blood platelets she was losing blood coughing up blood it was coming out of her her eyes uh she's Mass she's a mess getting weak real weak uh just pushing herself trying to trying to just she started just laying down and mom never lays down in the day and and she's taking naps and and you know well we you know Dad was worried and we so we started pressing you know issue to get into the in the hospital find out and welcome found out you know what was going on and and she had stomach cancer and the doctor says Miss Martin it's you know usually if we can detect this and usually it's no issue but it's down in the lining of your stomach and uh you've got to have surgery my mom says I will not have surgery and he says well Miss Martin he says you have to have surgery you know and and she said well I'm just telling you I'm not going to have surgery God's going to heal me and she's testified to the doctor this you know and and so we you know and and then in this time because Dad's all you know you're lean you know you got to have surgery and Mama we ain't had I ain't having surgery so we you know we convinced told Mom said well then let's just schedule the surgery okay I'll schedule it but I ain't having surgery you know okay but you satisfied you know so I will not you know she's just going around I will not you know and and so uh then you know she she taken a doctor wanted to give her medication and things like that and you know she said well is that hindering my faith is that doesn't mean that I'm not believing or what and you know I told us well you know uh brother Brandon was with he was okay with medication and all that and ultimately the God is the one that heals so she they put her on steroids and it made her looning she said I ain't taking that no more you know and uh and on and on Walton the day came for the surgery you know and mom told Dern dad's Dern I ain't having surgery you know I ain't you know he says but I'll go I'll go but I'm not having surgery so they get in the hospital and and you know the day he came and and Dad told told the doctor says well I'll tell you what you know now you've heard my wife say she's not having surgery she's claiming God to heal her so before we do anything else I want you to go do X-rays and sit and see what you find doctors said well okay I'll do that you know so they've done the x-rays and he left Mom and Dad in there for half a day for several hours and um and they're thinking well what's going on you know what's happening and finally comes in he says you know uh Miss Martin he's I'm so sorry I've left you here so long it says but we we've done the x-rays and what we saw uh is really unbelievable but he says I I actually I've called doctors around uh to come and look at this because um it's it's something that I've not seen before and Mom said well what is it and says well I'm here to tell you that you're cancer-free so there is no cancer and you ain't needing surgery and of course mom got all excited and happy and started dancing praise God and he said well Miss Martin that God is the only one that could have done that he said I'm baffled you know and he said because it was there we know it was there but see faith is positive and and you can't work yourself up it's just accepting What God Says and not looking at anything else not considering anything else can you say man see so hope believes all of that seed but he says now Faith don't look at that faith comes around and says I don't care nothing about conditions God said so and it's mine see that's what faith says faith is Burly see as as I once said faith has chairs on the uh chairs it has hair on the chest say when it stands up and pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away and just flies away when Faith really takes a hold nothing else stands and you say man so now Faith doesn't need any positive signs well I'm just waiting to see if I feel better that's not faith Faith don't need positive signs Faith just looks at the word that says positive as it needs it's the most positive thing ever because you can feel better today and and and feel miserable tomorrow dad you know he is with that person fighting that persons and there will be weeks that he will do good weeks and then all of a sudden just a downhill where he can't even get out of bed and and the trembling and all that getting worse and all that but there's just that maintaining I'm Healed I'm Healed well but but you're looking worse it doesn't matter I'm Healed I'm I'm claiming my healing now you talking about battles that's battles look at brother Ron in the same uh condition with his is the cancer doctor told him what two three years ago that he had four months four months to live but every time he keeps just confessing I'm Healed he really believes he's healed amen faith you know Mary didn't need any positive signs before she confessed that she had a baby now you just imagine that everything against terrible she had she hadn't been with a man not you know and yet she's gonna go and and she's she's had the the visitation now she's so positive she's gonna have a baby and she goes and tells Elizabeth I'm with child and brother Brown said she had no positive signs but she didn't need the positive sign she had faith ain't that right now hold is okay brother Brown said she didn't wait till she was positive she was going to have this child she didn't wait till she felt alive before she said anything about it she started right away testifying telling people that she was going to have this baby when there was no signs of it yet God give us more Mary's that's right don't wait for signs and wonders just take God at his word and start rejoicing and saying it's going to happen you say well if I just had if I just had the word of an Angel to come to me you don't need an angel to come to you we've had a prophet to come ain't that right we got the word of the Lord restored to us and more on top of that the prophet said the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always everything is positive about faith all you need is faith just take God at his word ain't that right now brother Graham said I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon the grounds of God's word and believe it and start testifying and praising God for your healing the meeting wouldn't close with one crippled person in here now that's a prophet he knew he was so sure of the word of God that if every individual and I say it here tonight would accept the word of God by faith except your healing on the grounds of of God's word except your deliverance on the grounds of God's word except God's mercy on the grounds of God's word except every promise of God on the grounds of God's word you would not leave here the same man he said that's right he said God is under obligation to answer his word ain't that right so now why is it important to meditate on the positive now I'm I'm not I'm not talking about when I say positive I'm not talking about getting Steve Forbes magazines and reading on that I'm not talking about getting psychology books and reading that I'm not talking about getting books about investing uh you know I mean if you're gonna do all that you know but I'm talking about something more positive and that's the word of God ain't that right so so we find why why is it important well the word of God is a seed ain't that right and what are you you're the ground that the word of God must fall into you that's right you got to be the good ground you got to be ground that is acceptable receptive to the word of God amen see in order to bring forth so you and I we're the ground brother Brown said see it's the inside no matter how good you are how moral you are how truthful you are those things are respected but Jesus said except a man be born again there's got to be something happen inside if you don't that's artificial put on for down in your heart you desire to do it anyhow it can't be artificial it's got to be real and there's only one Avenue that that can come down and that's by way of free moral agency it come into the Soul by your thoughts as a man seeketh in his heart so is he so it comes drops into your soul by your thoughts now brother Brown says anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to First receive it in her mind ain't that right some Slicker has to persuade her she listens to it against her own better judgment then the ACT is committed I think that's why the the preaching of the Gospel is so important ain't that right if the devil can preach a a gospel preach something to uh to get it into your thinking and then calls you to commit an act he did it for Eve then what about the preaching of the Gospel so he says see uh uh first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and in the womb of her mind she doubted God's word now in the womb of God's mind or our mind today tonight we want to believe God's word but she doubted God's word in the womb of her mind then come the actual Act and the only way that we can ever be born again is first in the womb of the Mind receive the word and then the spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life there you are that's what does it that's real gospel teaching brother he said I believe that Saint Paul was standing today he had teached the same thing I do in this hour ain't that right so before it can be materialized it has to be received in the mind is that the way it happened with God Man was created in the mind of God first knows what brother Branham said God created a man in his own image after his likeness and he created him it's God speaking in his thoughts in his mind what he had and then hears you know uh where he actually done the deed so the creation remember he says the world was created by God's thought first he created the world by his thought first ain't that right amen look at Redemption Jesus came way before he actually came Redemption was completed before the act of redemption was completed ain't that right brother Brown said God had always had a Plan of Redemption and that's been through blood ever since the very beginning and Dawn of time preceived in the mind of God before the world ever come into existence ain't that right so the Plan of Redemption that we're enjoying today was conceived in the mind of God we see Jesus slain a man at Calvary but it happened fairs in the mind of God brother Brown says Jesus was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world he was enslained for four thousand years afterward but he first in this the mind of God was already slain and Redemption was completed and in the mind of God you are always saved glorified Victorious and it happened in the mind of God and you're only the thoughts of God being materialized and brother Graham said if you wasn't in the mind of God you never will be can you say Amen so it has to come into the Mind first God wants you know people who are prisoners to his word notice brother Brown said Christ is now taking himself a bride is what I love well what is this bride it was a thought conceived in his mind every member of the Bride is already been placed in his mind no one can take your place because he is eternal his thoughts are Eternal his word is eternal no matter what the devil does you're you you cannot be replaced ain't that right now Christ is now taking himself abroad to be pregnated everybody say be pregnant with what his own seed word in her womb Spirit womb in her mind and it won't mix with any denominational trash she is a virgin to him oh aren't you glad that's that's where you're at tonight you are a virgin to him Satan Cannot drop anything in the womb of your mind you ain't gonna dwell on it you ain't gonna mess with it you ain't gonna give any thought to it why you've been ordained to be the Bride of Jesus Christ and you are now becoming impregnated with the word of God not impregnated with what the doctor's word said you're impregnated by what God Said sure the trials are going to come sure the challenges are here sure diseases are going to try to come upon you but you've already been planted by the word of God the word has now been impregnated in the womb of your mind we're not we're not we're not saying Amen to these things for not it's something that's happening in the womb of our mind you believe that we're becoming receptive to the word of God yeah brother Brown said if you've got your senses see taste feel smell in here they're all right but don't trust them everybody say don't trust them unless they agree with the word don't trust them they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imagination conscience memory of reason and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it because you'll blow a few flu right quick if your reason disagrees with the word get away from it that's right if your memory imagination your conscience anything disagrees with that that's what's on the inside get rid of it don't you let the devil take that seed away from you ain't that right now we know that the the the the foregrounds there were four grounds and the seed was planted on all them grounds but there was only one ground that brought forth to the right fruits brought forth that's right other the trials choked it out and the pleasures or whatever see but then there's that good ground and I believe I'm talking to good ground tonight second Corinthians 10 and 5. Paul says casting down imagination cast it down cast it down and everything everybody say every High thing that exalters itself against the knowledge of God ain't that right now you know what the knowledges of God is because this is the word of God you've seen it Vindicated over and over and over we've seen it it was the theme of brother branham's Ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever if he raised the dead then he can raise him up now if he healed the sick he can do it now ain't that right if he calls the man to get up off that that had been there for years and years amen and yet raised him up he can do it today there's nothing impossible with God Hallelujah to God yes sir now he says casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing everybody say bringing now he's talking about you you bringing into captivity right every thought to The Obedience of Christ any thought that is negative don't you dwell on that come on now there may be symptoms but don't dwell on it situation gets worse don't dwell on it bring every thought that is against God the knowledge of God bring it into captivity then you say Amen now brother Brown said it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality then every senses of soul and body is just scored out with the Holy Ghost then your sense of God your consciousness of God or your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere and there's nothing can rise up is this okay are we speaking something for him there's nothing can come up in the memory now listen to this I think this is this is this is good this is where we come we've got to come to the word must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of God becomes a reality and every senses of soul and body is just scored out with the Holy Ghost then your sins of God your conscience of God everything that's Godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up there's nothing can come up in the memory and say well I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God and miss so and so miss doe tried to trust God for healing one time and she failed see that won't come up because the word has already been angered in the soul ain't that right but if that channel has been cleared out and purged and been filled with the uh fuel on the inside with the holy spirit that don't even come in memory no matter about Miss Jones and what she did it's you and God together and nobody else but you too there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his tracks it ain't how long and keep that in mind it ain't how long you can make the war linger stop it right now stop it right now can you say Amen don't get don't let Satan get you to a point and talk you into it where you're always going to have your heart problems don't get into the condition that you're waiting to be healed that's not faith well I'm waiting I'm waiting no if you've got faith you already are healed there ain't no waiting to it just begin to confess it just begin to thank God I'm Healed I I just thank God that I'm I'm you know there's times that I've got trouble in my shoulder you know and it hurts to lift up you know but you know what I'll do I'll just lift up my arm anyway and say thank God I'm Healed I will never let that devil stop me from praising my God it ain't gonna do it and he'll get us into that point to where all we see is our problems all we see is the negative all we see is everything around us and then we really have a hard time just taking God at his word well if I've got faith if that faith is a knowing and I'm it's telling me that I'm already healed well I ain't gonna just stay home I'm not going to just stay and whine about it many times I preach well I'm I'm not feeling good but I ain't gonna let the devil stop me and you say man now brother Brown said if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail it might not be right see how Satan does that to our memory our conscience our reasoning and all that have you ever just done that has he ever come to you well if I confess my healing and then it gets worse what are people going to say doesn't matter hey right so he said see you say thinking about will I might fail I might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true it's for me if the whole church fails that the whole world fails yet I cannot fail because I'm taking you at your word now is that the way we're doing it the whole Walk Of God has taken God at his word here amen how many times I tell you I'm going in a Rapture and you know what Satan tries to tell me Well what if I ignore that thought I'm going in a rapture I'm taking God at his word I'm going in a rapture can you say Amen see that's what faith does you start claiming it in a personal way yeah it may make you fanatical but God will always prove you y'all will always vindicate you right yes sir that's right so he says see you throw aside everything open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true it's for me he says see there's the battle that's the thing another place he says God is putting down everything you're thinking about thoughts matter everything you're thinking about now if that can really get down into us I'm gonna close in a minute but I'm gonna say it to you that can really get down to us then we will be careful as to what we allow our mind to entertain ment can you say man he's putting everything down you're thinking about and he knows it in his recording book your thoughts everybody say my thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on Earth right so it says then think the right thing think the right thing well I sure want to be better than than let it start with your thinking well I I want to act better Christians let it start with your thinking you say man and now it cannot just be intellectual thought now we understand this that it has to come by your it through your intellectual thinking because that's what we're preaching right now but it can't just stop with intellect it has to come down into your heart in that soul and you say Amen see so now brother Brown would say this there's your Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning back in here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather he said your mind opens up and accepts this uh accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you can have these have little Consciousness little feelings little Sensations all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just a little Sensations things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it ain't that right and then he says oh God let none of them miss that see your mind either accepts it or rejects it ain't that right another place that said it's your mind that opens up the door closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle that he'll mess with your five senses of the flesh you'll mess with the five senses of of of of of your your your spirit that he cannot mess with what what's in the soul he cannot battle against it now notice Philippians 2 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God your mind must be open to the word of God ain't that right as one Minister said you know we must open it open to or let it happen in reality not just mental conception see so we cannot not open our mind or wound to just anything you can't that's well that's what you've done she her womb her womb was came was filled from from The Serpent and her womb came from Adam two different Acts and brought forth two different children is that right yeah and we're taking that in the spiritual sense of our mind if your mind is the womb to accept you cannot accept the things of the devil and the things of God at the same time God ain't that that God don't want that he wants a Verge a bride that's virgin to him ain't that right so then you cannot let your mind just be empty it's why every service counts so I plan them tapes count the word of God counts getting in prayer counts you're meditating on the positive brother Brandon even said when you approach God approaching based upon the word of God God you promised this don't don't just just come half-hearted don't don't come to God with what other people say about it well God so-and-so says it can't happen but I sure hope it does that's not how you approach God approaching based upon what he said he's the one that said it it's not what so-and-so says about it's not what happened to everybody else I'm approaching you God based upon your word and I'm accepting it for me meditating upon that positive if the musicians will come you realize people can keep the word from living in them by what they think of it REM said I just know that there's something right out here just ready to reach over and get a hold of him it's going to be greater than it's ever been it's going to be wonderful I believe God's fixing to do something great but now we've got to approach it sanely intelligently and right in the word and you say man and how do we do that knowing that the word is being fulfilled today knowing Who We Are I got a lot more to go but who do you believe you are you believe you're a son and daughter of God do you believe that you've been chosen for the foundation of the world yeah you've been called for this age do you realize do you believe that the word that is for this age is being fulfilled in you [Music] that ain't for anyone else it's for me every promise is for me [Music] it's for me and so then when we come to God we approach God sanely we approach God intelligently based upon his word hello we can say well God I'd come to you and I just want to thank you for what you've done in Noah's day God you're just so good and get up and walk away what about my day God I want to thank you for choosing me I want to thank you for the word that is pertaining me and I'm telling you I'm accepting it be it unto me according to Thy word father what is it you're approaching him sanely intelligently based upon the word the word for our day you're loving isn't he wonderful I thought of this he said while the Holy Spirit is here we'll call the prayer line and pray for the sick everybody get your faith down and and in your heart you don't have to say it in your mouth remember that you don't have to say it in your mouth just remember your thoughts are louder in heaven and your voice is on Earth say this oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and see if he'll do the same thing he did back then Hallelujah why it's coming into your mind you're entertaining it in your thoughts and while they thought upon him he showed up and brother Ram said it's when you're thinking upon him that he shows up the angel of the Lord is upon this upon the Earth he is here with his people do you believe that he is here it's not something that you're having to beg for him to come he is here but what are we meditating upon what what is bringing him to us are we sinking upon things that driving him hiding him from us or are we thinking those things that makes him more visible before us he's here not just with the propheties here with the people with us his bride you believe that Hallelujah let's just sing it now it's already done oh it's already done hallelujah It's Already Done praise the Lord foreign hurray praise the Lord the battle the battle's old terrie is one I'm already here say it again it's already done it's already done It's Already Done praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's all they just play Softly now if you notice this quote [Music] he said just polishing and joining church and reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of books and authors and so forth doesn't mean that you're converted because you have an intellectual mind that makes you have a mental conception that there is a God somewhere still you're not a Christian yet until actually you've become personal in contact with Christ that changes your heart and nature and what stood out to me is that the intellectual mind makes you have a mental conception that it's got to go deeper than that because that don't mean that you have that faith but when that word drops down from your mental conception that intellect drops down into your heart and only by God it can do that then it becomes more here than here it becomes a knowing down in here and then you begin to confess from out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh ain't that right and when it's down into the soul that you're healed that you're saved that you're delivered that you're free then no matter what no matter what you see no matter what happens around no matter what you feel Satan's gonna try to make all your senses and everything go haywire and up and down and you all know how it goes feelings and Sensations and this sometimes you feel good sometimes you don't sometimes you think you're safe sometimes you don't feel like you're saved all of these feelings and emotions and all of that has no bearing to it because now faith has anchored in that soul the soul is the control tower it governs everything else can you say Amen brother Brian said now there's two different types of christianities seem strange but I would not say two different types I'd say two different phases would be a better word to use two phases the same Christianity but two phases of it one of them is an intellectual or a mental conception of what God has said in his word and of Jesus Christ by the way of knowledge the other is a is an experimental experience that God has given the man in his heart the one intellectually is hunger and he's feasing on God but his Feast doesn't hold out the other seems to have Victory all the time there's nothing bothers them now have you ever just noticed there's nothing bothering them it's not that they're living a life of ease they're going through the same afflictions they're going through all these things but nothing is bothering them because they're anchored some things went beyond intellectually and gotten down in that soul he says see there's nothing bothering them they're just as solid and anchored as they can be no trials no storms bothers them at all oh my Hallelujah I believe that's where God is getting the church to be can you say Amen do you love him it's already done [Music] it's already done let's pick up the beat pray s the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done I have overcome yes I have overcome Hallelujah I have overcome praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is
