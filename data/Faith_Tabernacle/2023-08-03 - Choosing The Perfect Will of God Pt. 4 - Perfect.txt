himself to be real amen and the musicians can be dismissed it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord and trust you had a good day today and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Romans and um good to have brother Amos Sister Lisa back with us amen and uh brother Samaya has gone over the weekend as well and good to have him back and it's been mentioned we want to keep brother Bob in prayer and that the Lord will just continue to strengthen him and his body and amen and he's talked to him today and doing good and good spirits so thank the Lord for that amen and we also want to remember brother Joe Greene's meeting that started last night and uh if you're able to go I know you'll be blessed and um there and also brother Tim Farmer texted me this evening and um they're going to be having he's he's going to be having a tent meeting next weekend uh the 11th through the 13th at um seven o'clock each service there so um if you're able to go I know you'd be blessed and be a a blessing to to him and so just keep that in mind uh next next weekend a tent meeting and it's uh um it's going to be somewheres and I I totally forgot the place of it Rural Retreat off of exit 60. um 1204 Radio Drive and so the Rural Retreat off of exit 60. and so anyways um I'm sure that's going to be a a great time and also he said that he'd be having um uh I guess at that from that time be having a weekend service every other weekend through September 2nd and so anyways we want to just pray for his meeting if you cannot go be in prayer for that and that the Lord will just reward him for his labors and and I I just believe there's got to be someone else that needs the Lord and if we can help that bring a soul in it could be the last soul that we win to Lord bringing to this the bride the body of Christ and the Lord takes us home amen so just keep that in mind but uh uh the book of Romans the 12th chapter and we we read this scripture last Wednesday but I want to read it again as a opening scripture praise the Lord enjoy the songs tonight and the worship praise the Lord before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father how needy we are oh How uh Lord empty or not just empty but uh we were entering our soul unto you Lord that you would come and feel his father Lord we know that it's a daily experience a daily walk with you and Lord we've lived yesterday how but now we're here father for another moving another in feeling of your spirit and father we pray Lord that you would come and you would feel welcome in this building father May our songs and praise be Lord pleasing in your side father and may you feel at home Lord that you could speak Eternal Words of Life to his father and changes father we know that we're being changed on a daily basis Lord and that's our desire is to be more like you I pray father that you would just forgive us of all of our sins our failure Lord may your blood your atonement be covering us tonight no God speak to your people it's our prayer in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen Romans the 12th chapter the first verse starting here says I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen you can have your seats this evening so again to to use the title uh choosing the perfect will of God and um we know that the will of God is the word of God and so to walk in his will is to walk in his word to have an understanding of his will is to have an understanding it would be impossible to know the perfect will of God if we did not have the perfect interpretation of the word of God and the perfect word of God being restored to us makes known the perfect will of God to us so by God restoring the word so this brings the complete restoration of the bride of Christ amen the the perfect word being restored brings about the completion or the complete restoration of the bride of Christ and so this this message that the prophet of God brought to us is the perfect interpretation of the word you believe that it's the perfect interpretation of the word and so we we know that because it has been divinely Vindicated of God and and to us and so therefore we know we know that God has this Bible is not uh in mystery form anymore but we as the people of God has it has been revealed to us we know we have the perfect interpretation therefore we know what is the perfect will of God and so uh being uh free moral agents uh as we are we have the ability of course and the responsibility uh to to make our choice and God requires us to make our choice um um you know Joshua brought the people up to a time of decision and it was at the at at the crossroads and there uh Joshua 24 and 15 uh Joshua totem says if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose lands you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord amen and of course the following scriptures is where Israel told Joshua we're going to follow the lord as well but but it was a time of decision it was at a Crossroads where they had to make a choice and we all we all come to Crossroads in our life you young people are at at a a Crossroads and these Crossroads they are crucial uh it's it's it's it's a crucial time uh in our lives um Israel came to a Crossroads under Moses's message Ministry at Kadesh barnia before they could go into the promised land uh they God brought them to a Crossroads to where they had to make a decision the Rich Young Ruler when he came face to face with Jesus he came to across roads and he come to a place that he had to make a decision and we we know in in all these decisions determined in in these these here determined their Eternal destination in 1956 America came to a Crossroads and uh her decision is why she is in the condition she is today but but it's interesting thing that all three that I mentioned Israel uh the Rich Young Ruler America and and we could even save the world but uh they they uh they've they all come to the same Crossroads to where they were given the choice and they had to either accept or reject the word for their hour it wasn't just the cross you know just the decision of what candy bar I wanted but this decision would be the thing that would determine their future determine whether they would go on in further in God and uh God had blessed Israel God God no doubt blessed that Rich Young Ruler uh uh God had blessed America and and uh even even the Jews in Jesus day uh they they were God's people but they come to a Crossroads and and it was at that crossroads that they made the decision and it was a fatal decision for each one of those uh uh at these times ain't that right and so I believe that every one of us here uh uh have made our choice uh to follow the Vindicated word of our day we we've been given this choice just as it was with Israel America and and and the Rich Young Ruler and and the Jews and and every every in every uh age there's been a Crossroads for a nation there's been a Crossroads for a people individuals homes families whatever and uh uh so we we've we've we're here because as we made the choice to to follow the Lord but it's not just a choice that we made years ago that that keeps us today uh uh but we we are continually making a choice on the day on a daily basis uh do you believe that I made the choice many years ago to follow the message and a lot of folks didn't that I knew didn't come and and join with me they didn't understand why but I'm not here today because of that choice only uh uh that just got me started it was a founding uh it got me of you know started on the right track but I found through through the years that I have had to keep making that choice keep making that choice you see some people have made the choice to leave their denomination and and started attending a a message church but then they go off in false doctrines and start believing things in a message church that brother Branham never taught they come under legalism they come under bondage or they start bringing in all these kinds of worldly things that brother Branham did not teach and and did not allow and and all these things see so it tells us that even though they made the choice to leave their denomination and and to come in in in and come to a message Church uh yet they didn't remain steady in their choices that they made and and so this is why we see people falling away left and right hey they started out and and this is even what Paul told the Galatians I think he said you started out well what did hinder you you started out right but what did hinder you something caused them to start making wrong choices in their life and and so you you can say well I gave my heart to the Lord to years ago that's fine but you better not live lacks today amen because you're going to have to make choices all your life amen and so we we find uh then there are some who have made the choice to attend a message church and yet they have never fully accepted the message as being the pure word of God and and again others uh come out of the denominations and and so then they bring in that denominational uh teachings or the train of thought and their ideologies and trying to mix it with with the the message of the hour and you you can't do that this message is not for anyone but for the elect of God it's it's to make a bride and and that's it uh uh you know I've thought of that and and so uh others you know in the message they start living worldly start acting worldly start talking worldly and and uh thinking worldly it's it's it's got to a point almost to where you can't tell some people who attend a message church for those who attend a nominal church and and it's because of people's choices they get lacks well I go to miss church I'm going to heaven no you're not that has nothing to do with it you understand what I'm saying not everybody that goes to a message church is going in a rapture now I will tell you everybody that's going in a Rapture is in a message but in in the message but but but just because everybody going to a men's church don't mean you're going in a Rapture you have to make choices you have to make choices how you're going to run your family you're going to have to make choices and what church you go to and and you're going to have to make choices as you as an individual how you're going to live how you're going to conduct yourself and and and these choices are brought up to us God will bring them to you uh you don't have to worry about that God God will make sure that someone challenges your faith someone asks you questions someone tempted tempts you uh you you've got plenty of things to make choices about but but you you you you you you but but the thought is tonight is choosing the perfect will of God Amen and so uh now I believe that that the cream of the crop is message Believers but again not all who go to a message church are believers now to to maybe go on in in in another Direction brother Branham said you were made for an eternal purpose now keep that in mind as we're thinking of the the perfect will of God but he said you were made for an eternal purpose because you everybody say me see brother Bram knows how to make these things personal but he said you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being now then sin come along and perverted his way you come anyhow amen but you was lost with the world so he came and he redeemed you the expressed attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way ain't that right so another place he said if you've got eternal life there's only one form and that's God and you are an expressed attribute if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow so see no man can come to me except my father has drawn him ain't that right see so he says now the old things all the old things pass away can you say that with me all the old things pass away but these things the Eternal things don't see so it speaks of Eternity see the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity because you've got the Holy Ghost ain't that right if you've got the Holy Ghost and there is some Eternal part about you that is a part of God and these things don't pass away it won't pass away ain't that right so then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened now another place he said you're a time being until you're born again then you're an eternal being and the only way you can get it is to have a part of God in you being eternal life ain't that right so now I pray that God will just make it all clear to us but but there is an eternal part in of about the believer it's not all corrupt it's not all uh uh temporal it's not all whatever there is it is an eternal part and that part is with God it's an attribute of God it's it's something there ain't that right if you didn't have that Eternal attribute there would be nothing in you to call for something something Beyond this life people all the time thinking this is life but something about you don't think that this is life but you've never been anywhere other than this Earth you've never known any other life but this you've never known nothing but death and Corruption and pain and Agony but there is something about you that groans for something else and it bears with you that there is a place that will not die there is a place oh yeah you read it but how many times have we read things and it never strikes home but when you read the promises and you hear about the promises you read the Bible and you you read about what this says about a future home and and a a future civilization where there's no death there's no sin there's there's something that catches you and you start yearning for it it's something that is eternal that's that Eternal being that is inside of you ain't that right amen now we must choose in this life we're here it's it's it's the testing grounds as I think we read about uh talked about Sunday it's the testing ground this Earth is the testing ground and we must choose between the perfect will or our own will and and again this is where the real struggle comes because our carnal sticky nature is is always always wanting to us to do one thing and and and that is totally against God it now people can be religious now think of that people can be religious churchgoers tithe payers offering they they can give and give all they got to the poor they can extend themselves and and and and and and and go to hospitals and go visit the sick and go visit this and go visit that all in the name of religion and still not be right with God and and that's that's incredible that that can actually be but but but still it it it's the carnal nature that is dominating that life amen and and you know people can get prideful just just giving money to to the poor people people can say well look what I've done you know and and it becomes a a a uh uh to where everybody oohs and alls them you know oh my look what they do they're so important and and it really becomes something in our heart at people's hearts that they think I'm really important boy if I ever left boy this church fall apart if I ever done this if I ever done that these guys need me you know well what what is it it's it's it's it's it's all done controlled by Eternal sticky nature it's just that way but then there that and and we struggle uh uh so so that that carnal nature is just a fleshly nature it's worldly it's it's it and and so what I'm getting at it can even be religious and still not right with God but then there's that predestinated seed that is inside of us if there is one and it's wanting us to choose contrary to that of the carnal nature ain't that right and what it does it seeks the perfect will of God Jesus had power upon power he he he could have raised the dead but he didn't raise every dead he he he healed the sick but he didn't raise everybody uh or he didn't heal all the sick right amen he he could have opened the blind eyes but he didn't open every Blind Eye amen we find a healing the leopard but he didn't heal every leper amen why because he done it was more important for him to do the a perfect will of God than it was to show his off his ministry can you say amen amen see he was there to get the seed of God he was there to get the elect of God ain't that right amen see and so uh uh there is a warning that goes on inside of us as Believers and and again talking about the two dogs black dog and white dog and and then brother Brown said see it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God ain't that right see it's uh remember because he asked the chief it was asked which one wins he said well it all depends which I which one I feed the most so you'll you'll either cater to the flesh or you're going to cater to the spiritual side you get the Holy Ghost that does not mean that it's going to be easy for you it just it isn't going now yeah Jesus said I give unto you power that's right that's why every individual that's really got the Holy Ghost is going to overcome you will not be able we will not be able to come to God and say God I know you gave me the Holy Ghost but I just couldn't overcome that's a lie it just ain't gonna happen can you say Amen so so you you got to make the choice either to follow after the world or follow after God you've got the choice to be a layout of sin church member just like everybody else rich and and saying that I'm rich and I have need of nothing and all that in other words we don't need prayer we don't need God we just we're just happy the way we are we just go to church and and hopefully the preacher don't take long because I got to go and do other things and and all of that and and and so therefore we lay the things of God the important things of God aside but hey we go to church hello we quote message we believe message you understand what I'm saying but live in a a a totally carnal life amen then that shows that that you're feeding off the wrong things you'll either be a strong Christian believer overcome the devil or you'll be a strong carnal church member who is constantly defeated by the devil it all depends which one you cater to ain't that right but but there is no way there is no way that you can set under a message of the hour and live true blue to the message and then live a defeated life it just ain't gonna work amen but see you're blessed amen because you could be sitting in a denomination somewhere with nothing eating out of the garbage can skin and bone spiritually all dried up with no power at all and then you're going with the the ways of the world and with the current down into the council the World Council of churches and that's where everybody's headed you understand that but you're blessed because you have a message you you have something that can you can feed off to get stronger in that spiritual man developing strength and overcoming to where you can be that one that brother Brown says the devil don't know what to do about with amen yes if you cater to the things of the world don't expect to be a strong Christian if you cater to the things of God then you'll not be a strong carnal church member it's just what all you cater to amen ain't that right now our choice our choice is is crucial because it determines our outcome and destination and and and again and and I you know uh and I really want to uh I pray the Lord help me make this clear because we get this idea that well I got the Holy Ghost so well and the Holy Ghost is rest don't get me wrong the Holy Ghost is rest you believe that the question is is is and and I I'm not here to preach any doubt at all but I want maybe we all check our lives and the question is is the Holy Ghost really there and and and again because here's the thing that Jesus said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved not he that starts out shall be saved he that endures to the end so there's some enduring there's some resistance that we're going to meet there there are some things discouragement there's things that we're going to go through but he that endures to the end he that cometh out and the the you you come out by the choices you've made David now to me this shows as to whether or not a man really has the Holy Ghost and and the re I'm going to say it read some quotes here brother Brown said there's nothing that you can say is the evidence of the Holy Ghost unless your life unless it's the life you live the evidence of having the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it ain't that right now now when we're saying this it's it's it's one thing to say well I received the Holy I received the word I received the word and and and and and and and and and and and that's usually when things are going good and and in in meetings and rejoicing and even you young people you go to these youth meetings and the power of God's moving and and and it's in a place you forget about your trials you're just in you're just in a uh uh Utopia or whatever that word would be and and you just wow you're there man and the word oh it's easy to receive the word then but but it's in the trials do we still receive that word it's in the ups and downs do we still receive that word lo I am with you uh I'll never leave you nor forsake you in them times of loneliness can we still receive that word and say God your word said so when when when when when in the times when we're we we ain't got nothing and the money ain't there and and these things ain't there and yet we we know what the Bible says that I am the god that supplies all your needs and uh uh uh uh according to the riches and glory and and all that can we still receive that word or are we going to find ourselves our hearts getting hardened toward God and blaming God and this and that and you understand what I'm saying so so the evidence of the Holy Ghost in another place is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding how do you know the word is clear and understand it watch it vindicate itself watch it vindicate itself I hope I'm making sense tonight what someone asked brother Brandon what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost well John 14 26 when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things to come he'll perfect it man-maids won't do it he is the word ain't that right he is the word and when he the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with thee scripture ain't that right with the scripture amen and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word he says now look what if you spoke with tongues I just want to ask you that when Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what would he do see uh uh what he would do well what if you spoke with tongues jumped up and down shouted and everything else and then come to the word and I tell you the baptism and prove to you by the scriptures I have that the baptism used entitled a father Son and Holy Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding in the scripture nobody was ever baptized like that and you go ahead and hang with that anyhow he says then you could you tell me the holy spirit in you would do a thing like that how can it deny its own word can you say man so see that this is where we got people shouting and people and I'm just talking about the world in general not just in the message uh uh uh claiming Christianity and and all these things but then when it comes to face and facts and truth of this Bible and people walk away from it then it shows right there the Holy Ghost ain't there can you say man now we're talking about choosing the perfect will of God can you say man when the will of God which is the word of God is made clear and Vindicated and they still reject Jesus name baptism then then the Holy Ghost ain't there when you tell them about a woman not cutting their hair and they can't cut their hair it's wrong and they still take it from being a hat or some other covering or whatever or they just I remember my dad talk talking to some lady uh uh years ago and and he took me with him and and we're sitting there and she she uh it was all mad because he had talked about uh women cutting hair and so he went there and says uh sister let me try to explain to you and she he says this right in the Bible and she just shook her head enough she said I don't care what you say I don't care what you show me I'll never believe it and and that really stuck home to me right there and I thought God never let me be like that if it's in the word I want to believe it see you you can't choose the perfect will and reject the word word of God can you say man and and so then if a man truly has the Holy Ghost he humbles himself to this word he he chooses this word do you understand over his own feelings over his own emotions you say well I've never been taught that before but it's shown in the word then you've got to accept the word over what you've been taught or or over whatever you saw it you understand what I'm saying see so uh he he said see uh uh he says how can it deny its own word when I show you what's supposed to take place in this day how that the son of man is to reveal himself and what he's to do and all these scriptures that's been now and then see him come right down and identify it and you hang right on to a denomination and say that you're born again how could you make sense out of that now can you say man everybody want to say oh we got the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost you know you can tell a person if they really got the Holy Ghost brother Brown said you could so so all this make belief if I've got Holy Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost if if they're not if they're not living the word of God and they're rejecting the word of God then don't follow that can you say Amen now the perfect will of God is what we want to choose and I believe that God is bringing all things everybody say all things back to his perfect will all this world and and the the the the systems and all that has been been by his permissive will but God is going to bring everything and he is bringing everything back to his perfect will and this is this is explains why things are changing so rapidly in the world today and this change is not a reform that is taking place amen but it's about all things becoming new ain't that right and in order for all things to become new there has to be annihilation of that which is stopping the thing to becoming anew the the the the old traditions have got to be annihilated for that to become new can you say Amen so so it's all about all all things becoming new now now look a new Heaven and a new Earth a new civilization a new kingdom a new city a new people think of that a new people see Isaiah 43 18 remember ye not the formal things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing ain't that right Revelations 21 and 2 and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people none others than his people and God himself shall be with him and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more deaths neither siren nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and there is a people today on this earth that is groaning and crying for this to happen to I will be done then you say Amen his perfect will it's a miracle that that someone can pray for the perfect will to be done and choose it because again the perfect will of God isn't not is not in favor of the carnal man it's not in favor of the fleshly adamic nature the perfect will of God is not in favor that it actually goes against it and and everything about man has to die has to be changed in order for the perfect will of God to to be accomplished ain't that right see so so uh uh this is why it's a miracle that you you cry for the will of God in this age because according to Second Timothy 3 2 and 4 men are lovers of their own selves and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and that fits for this day it was a prophecy uh uh concerning this age that we're living in no wonder people ain't crying for God anymore no wonder people are just satisfied with religion and now they make the choices where they want to go to church or not it there's nothing that is compelling them to do these things it's just a convenience it's just a matter whether it's convenient for them it's because there are more lovers of pleasure than lovers of God and you say man this is why the churches are appealing to the Natural flesh and they are the spiritual man but the message does not appeal to the carnal flesh it doesn't have its programs it doesn't have the professional music it doesn't have the professional choirs and all these things it doesn't have the professional uh preachers and and and and and and it doesn't have the personality for us to draw to but this is appealing to that spiritual man because it's dealing with the perfect will of God and you say man so who are the ones crying against the sin that is being done who are the ones that are agonizing in their soul because of the filth and the evil people are becoming more adapted and I've been saying it for a while say it again but they're becoming more adapted and used and and and and and at home with these movies and and it's got to the place that we've excused it well it's not television anymore we got computers same thing it's a movie it's Hollywood it's it's it's things that is wrong can you say Amen we got most of the people today they're caught up in all the glamor and the worldly fashions and and the people are crying out for peace peace is that not what the Bible said they would do peace peace but see the only thing that brings peace is the perfect will of God there's nothing in this world that brings the peace that the soul is crying for people are looking to the Nations they're looking to the churches they're looking to science and education and and yet all of them are all the denominations all these things are being controlled by Satan and and and there will be no peace not not not until the perfect will of God is completed is accomplished can you say man so so then uh these things that are controlled by Satan it means that they're not part of the perfect will and they of God and they work against the perfect will of God how many people are God now now Church we're blessed to unders have the understanding of what this message is all about you realize this is the kingdom of God that we are to receive this is the kingdom of God it's more Superior than American Kingdom than the kingdoms of all this world and yet most churches are so wrapped up in politics trying to preserve the kingdom of America prophecy after prophecy after prophecy God's going to bless God's going to move God's for this America this this nation God's this God and it all backwards you know what the prophet it reminds us what the prophet brought us to in this scripture Ahab and the 400 prophets and McCain and all of these things but somewhere we have this understanding that that's not the perfect will of God America was fine and God blessed her and and she's done many things but that wasn't the perfect will of God the perfect will of God is coming now that his kingdom come and a people on this Earth receives it so all of these things will come to not when the perfect will of God is fulfilled and there is something again within the believer that is causing him to groan within himself for the will of God to be accomplished now we know this scripture but Hebrews 12 and 25 it says see that ye refuse him not not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that's speaking from Heaven whose voice then shook the earth now we know this is this is the message this is what Paul it's tied to the message of the hour but he says see whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake knock the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear and I say to you this prophecy is being fulfilled today we are in a shaking of the heavens and the earth and the the spiritual things and as well as the Earthly things and everything is being brought down uh uh and and and and and and and and is being shaken that that which can be shaken will be removed and that which remaineth shall remain can you say Amen see so so everything that God has permitted a man has come to its and we're at the end of this this civilization we're at the End of Time amen we're at the end of of of politics we're at the end we are at a place where God calls it the ends of the Earth we're there because God's perfect will must be accomplished it must come it must come now when Satan has perverted or what he has perverted is being transformed back to the perfect will of God amen now it's it's coming back and the perfect will of God being accomplished shows that there is a people who have come into obedience to the word of God Amen now you think of this now amen that the perfect will of God being accomplished shows that there is a people on this Earth today that has come into full obedience to the word of God you see what caused all this corruption in the first place disobedience amen and and that because of unbelief Disobedience because of unbelief ain't that right God gave his word so what was the Disobedience to the word of God what was the unbelief to the word of God Amen see God gave his word and when man was tested on it he failed upon that word and disobeyed the word and noticed What followed amen uh Paul would tell us because of one man's disobedient a man death follows amen we go in on more into that corruption follows filth and sin sorrow pain came into this world because of one man's Disobedience ain't that right but because of one man Jesus Christ his obedience Amen to the word of God many are made righteous you can read that in Romans 5 19. amen see but now looking at today I believe that that righteous people that was made righteous by that one man's obedience this righteous people is living on Earth today who has come into full obedience themselves to the word of God and that's the reason why all things are becoming new can you say amen amen a prepared place for a prepared people all things are becoming new amen because a people have come back to a full obedience to the word of God Amen a people have been restored you believe that the people have been restored we're part of that people I believe amen and and they make up the bride of Christ now I'm not going to take too much longer but I am going to read you some quotes here and uh but brother Brown said the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word and only believes God's word and you say man now that ain't easy amen they're going to go through hell they're going to go through trials they're going to go through storms of life they're going to go through testings and temptations and being Forsaken and and all of these things but that shows they to be the real bride of Christ because they take the handship of Christ which is the word can you say Amen in other words through it all they choose the perfect will of God for their lives perfect will he said that's the real restored bride it's nearly time friends it's later than you think we're at the evening time the holy spirit is here tonight and I know he says I know it's a little bitty group but we're part of that group I believe now Colossians 1 18 Paul says he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things or by saying all things he might have the preeminence now it's it's brother Branham takes that scripture there in in Christ as the mystery of God revealed and and he he really lays heavy in this uh that and and any he makes this scripture applicable to this day that finally out of the ages God is now able to take a group of people and have complete preeminence over them preeminence over their flesh over their Spirit over their mind can you say over the wheel over their Sensations over their feelings he has complete preeminence in them and they come in full obedience now the Vindicated word is our headship do you believe that so now following this message doesn't mean just attending a message Church following of the message does not mean just mean that we believe brother Branham to be the prophet of Malachi 4. but following the message means that we have accepted it as the supreme authority for our lives it's the supreme authority for our church it's the supreme authority for our family it's supreme authority for our marriage it's supreme authority in what we're choosing for our spouse it's the supreme authority that tells us everything it's the supreme authority over our lives [Applause] in Matthew 4 4 Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth thou the mouth of God ain't that right so as God gave Adam and Eve his word to live by so has he given us today his word to live by and again the Bride of Adam fell when she was tested by the word she received a different word which calls her to receive a seed that was different from the spoken word and as brother Branham said it was the seed of death ain't that right but notice what the prophet said the bride of Christ will not fall ain't that right she will not fall he fell when she was tested by the word she fell but this bride has been tested and you're going to continue to be tested by this word but it's already been written you will not fail brother Brown said she is ordained not to fall she won't fail she is predestinated to it ain't that right so we're not under just any headship of man but under the headship of God and the headship of God is not a denomination you know brother Branham asked well how does denominations get started he says well God will reveal a little something to somebody and they'll come and make a denomination around that belief that they have and then God can't move any further and he goes on and asks he says how can the Methodist ever accept anything more than a second work of Grace because they've denominated themselves around that how can the lutherans believe any more than the just shall live by faith why they can because they've denominated around that that that that Doctrine amen how can the Baptist believe anything else than what they believe see it's because they denominated themselves under that how can the Pentecostals believe that that speaking in tongues you know or believe anything more uh than speaking in tongues is the evidence that a man has the Holy Ghost they can't because they are denominated under that can you say man so then brother Brian says that's the reason why we are not a denomination see you cannot accept the perfect will of God when you're under a denomination when you're under a headship of man you you cannot accept the full word of God it's already been proven and when they reject the word of God they die ain't that right amen and look where their churches are are they ready for a Rapture absolute or not are they fit for a body change absolutely not do they have that spiritual strength they need absolutely not because they failed to move on with the word of God yeah amen so now brother Brown says see the Lord has given us the opportunity to merge this little church in many different denominations but we don't do it because we want to State just like this so it can be under the rulership and headship of Jesus Christ that's right whatever he reveals to us and we see that it's the truth and it lines up with his word all the way back and forth through this Bible that is the truth see uh uh or that it is the truth and the spirit is agreeing on it we have no denominational barriers to hold us from accepting that do you see it do you see why you can accept the perfect will of God because you're not under a barrier you're you're of of a denomination that is restricting you from moving on with God church you can have anything that God has for you under the headship of the word can you say man so he said see we go right head into it and move right on see so what we're doing tonight as as message Believers and those that really believe in the message of the hour were progressing can you say that with me progressing we're progressing into the perfect will of God step-by-step trial by trial Temptation by Temptation day by day we're progressing into the perfect will of God you say well I I'm not where I ought to be but that don't worry about that you just stay with the message stay under the headship of the word of God and and you're progressing you're you're you know it's like that woman that testified brother Bram talked about that said you know I'm not what I uh where I want to be he's what I need to be he says you know and and uh I'm not where I ought to be and and and whatever but she says but there's one thing about it I'm not what I used to be and I I think that's all of our testimony is that we're not what we used to be but I want to encourage you don't stop there and say well at least I'm not in a denomination you can dry up just as much in a message Church see this bride and who isn't now the perfect The Book of Revelation speaks of the in her daughters which is symbolic of the Catholic church and the denominational Protestant churches and and also brother Branham said some of these independent churches are just as bad and sometimes even worse and they're all going into the tribulation and and we know that the foolish virgin is going to go to the tribulation and and uh she's the remnant and 12 uh Revelations 12 16 and the dragon was Roth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed now remember I'm so that's the that's the foolish virgin which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ now this is during the tribulation period ain't that right at this time though the bride is already caught up in the glory sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb ain't that right but the sleeping virgin is going to be hunted down by the Dragon brother Brown said the dragons first water from his mouth which means multitudes and people armies that were searched down and take this woman remnant of her seed and will kill her and that now that will be in the tribulation period ain't that right so another place says the dragon makes war with those who did not receive the Holy Ghost and yet they are a Sanctified Church another place that's when the Protestant church under the Federation of churches which is the image to the Beast which is now being formed and there will be a boy caught upon all churches like this another place he said the real church has gone on she's done at the wedding supper for his face of time where the wedding supper will be going on uh the last week and he said that's when the tribulation sets in when the locus and the persecution Rises upon the churches of things like that see now he says the another place the foolish Virgin Goes in the tribulation it's because she's rejected the atonement in its fullness she is a Believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period so in other words she has refused to come under the headship of the Vindicated word and by doing so she rejects her atonement in its fullness can you say amen amen so therefore she she has nothing to hide her uh uh uh and and keep her and and bring her out of uh in an escape from from God's Wrath ain't that right amen she refused the perfect will of God she let whatever happen to where she wouldn't come on in to to the word hello and because she's rejected the message of the hour she goes to the tribulation but we find now looking at at the church brother Branham said he is the firstfruits of the Resurrection then what is he he is the head of the body which is his church bride ain't that right so his body is his church which is his bride and he is her head I'm not choosing the will of God the perfect will of God see the bride and body must follow the head all right and he's the word ain't that right for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible everybody say it's impossible for it not to go she's part of his body she is his bride right so she's going to go through all kinds of things but every time her choice will be the word perfect will of God he said see it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he Reveals His Church by raising it up by the same word man following that word of God come under subjection to the word of God choosing the word of God Amen stand with the message of the hour there is a power there that's going to raise you up and it is Raising it's raising the bride up right now now I I'm I'm going to say it but it ain't gonna leave her wrapped up in this stupid Hollywood it ain't going to leave her wrapped up in the old carnal ways of of of religion I I'd just be honest it ain't going to keep her all wrapped up in sports it ain't gonna it ain't gonna keep her all wrapped up and that's you know the television and the YouTube and and and and all of this junk that is going on you can't tell me that a real message believer that that is is is caught up under the headship of the word that leaves them like that it just ain't brother Branham saw that bride not just going up and down over the hill that she saw her rise and rising and Rising that's what this message is for ain't that right yes I think we ought to be getting stronger in our trials you believe it stronger Christians so it's part of God's mystery see so he Reveals His church he Reveals His church not reveals it to his church not this what not what he's saying here he Reveals His Church by raising her up by the same word it's a part of his threefold mystery as the head was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to Eden can you say man following Back to Eden why that's his perfect will his perfect will is not for you to be here contaminated like like flies on dung [Music] right you've been around it you've seen old dung you see no the trash big old big old flies flying all around it come on now I didn't say anything bad it's just truth it's it's flies they like that junk ain't that right it's it's it's why I don't know but they do and Spirits like church carnal believers they just swarm around them and swarm around them you see a lot of religious people that are just ate up by demons now let's just face it it's the truth and everything that the devil brings out of this in this world and new inventions of the people follow it they Gotta Have It it's true yes come on it's it's getting to the place that the women's skirts are getting shorter and shorter and so what do they do to cover it they wear their britches underneath the skirt and and and then what then it just goes on and on and on and on and on come on Church but where's the power at in your life where where's that overcoming power as I mentioned Wednesday night they got this this this this machine now that can take out all the cussing words so now we've just made it in we made it like it's okay to watch movies backslidden whatever you want to call it and then we say we're message believers brother Branham never said it's okay to watch movies because you know when they develop a machine that takes the cussing out he never said that he said the devil snuck a good one on us when he brought the television in the home ain't that right now Church you know and and I know we've all got growing to do but let's grow Sean Martin's got to grow but I want to grow we all want to grow don't we don't do we not want to grow we we can sit there and say well you just yeah you blessed me God you just preaching all over me you ain't got no proof of it if there ain't power in your life there's something that is dictating that stopping it from growing if we're struggling in our faith if we're struggling Amen to overcome things we might ought to check hey man go forward so we as the bride of Christ you know the man brother Brown said the man being the bridegroom is the head of the family and we as the bride of Christ are following our headship the Vindicated word Back to Eden so it is impossible for you to be left behind when you're following the Vindicated word and what is the Vindicated word the message of the hour when you're following the Vindicated word it's impossible for you to be left behind ain't that right it's when people refuse to follow to keep moving on keep moving on then then they die they die right there now you know uh uh so here brother Brown says the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the groom bridegroom because that's the head and the head is revealed and come back with eternal life Heaven believes he's revealed he's come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it is husband and wife again as long as you're pregnant with the same word which is his body you've took his body become in him when you took the word not the Creed the word don't you fail this he says the body therefore cannot recognize any other hits yet but the word because the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one hits you believe that so when when people you know we we're not fighting with people that that uh you know say you know brother Branham you know hit it and missed and and and then they become the judge of the book and they say well if if you can't find it in the Bible then then that's just brother branham's opinion well we're not going to fight with them but I'm not going to accept what they got to say I will not accept it because they're not a headship this message is our headship and what they want to do they want to dilute that headship they want to take your faith away from this message if if they have their if that anointing that is upon them that evil spirit that is causing them to teach them things if it really has its way you'll believe nothing about this word you don't believe nothing about this message look where people are today they don't even believe that there's a God these days Satan has been able to take them type of people to where they can look at all creation and deny there's a God can you say man but it's an anointing but this bride has got to believe this message this bride is not just to quote the message but come under the message and let this message be her headship because that's the only headship there is there is one headship and that's Christ so then they say well then they separate Christ from the message that's nonsense Christ is the anointed word he is the Vindicated word can you say amen and there's only one headship and that's Christ and the body only recognizes one thing that's the word then you say Amen so how can the Catholics put themselves under the jurisdiction of a pope I don't know how everything the prophet says that the Catholic Church teaches is so contrary to the first word that God recognized to be his church by signs and wonders and that same word has been brought forth today in its purity right that same word has been brought forth today in his Purity showing the same Resurrection that he had back then and what is it it's God living among his people doing the same things can you say Amen you love the Lord amen if the musicians will come so he says our headship is in heaven not I'm not going to Rome I'm going to heaven when I die the headship is in heaven and the body must follow the head as the wife follows the husband being that Adam was not deceived he walked out with Eve Eve was deceived she was in the transgression or now now listen to this I I've read this I've heard this message many times before but this has really struck home as I was uh looking at it today but he says see Eve was deceived she was in the transgression or the entire resurrection of the whole body would have come forth at the day of the Lord Jesus when he come forth from the grave he had to redeem her which is his body she has to be redeemed in order to come to him he says do you see it oh my it couldn't have happened then the Redemption is going on now so that's why the church the bride could not come at that time the Redemption wasn't done can you say man but look where we're at today I believe that the Redemption and and it could be a long subject so just hear me what I'm saying the Redemption of the Bride is almost completed or maybe already completed we don't know but all I know is that what God thought of this bride to be she's here what God's future for his bride has always been in his mind the perfect will for he of for this bride is coming to to to to be accomplished it's here which shows then that the there there must be we're right close to where this this bride is going to be finished up there is there is that has come into full obedience again to the word of God God has restored the word to us again aren't you glad for that Eve had the word she failed and God has given us the same chance at it we will not fall we're ordained not to fall and because that we've come into this full obedience to the word the Millennium is coming on the Rapture is here everything is now taking place because the bride has found her position can you say Amen she's no longer a fallen bride she's a redeemed bride she said she said she said he is kid with her again flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him she is him church that's what you are oh choosing the perfect will of God not saying hear God Desiring to bring her in to to a land of peace and a land of of of of where there's no sin no and then we're saying oh no no no no no I got to do this first I remember he gave he gave a bidding to the marriage supper come but there was others that said oh well I can't I'm I'm busy farm and I'm busy with this and I'm busy with this and I'm busy with that they come with all excuses but then he says Ah no doubt he looked at us and says go to the hedges and the byways compel them to come in my house must be full my table my table set it's got to have it's got to have somebody to sit there and this is where we've come in we ain't got no bargaining power we ain't saying oh God if you just hold on for a moment let me do this and do this I'm too busy with life no we're crying thy will be done thy will be done thy will can you say man and the Rapture takes place in you you're part of it it changes you from corruption to incorruption because that's the perfect will of God and you've accepted that perfect will of God Amen you're changed oh my God I love the Lord Blessed Be His holy name [Music] so wonderful amen brother Brown said when the bride will get back to being a wordbright she will produce the very works that Jesus produced amen oh we could go on but I'll I'll just close amen what song all this is the evening time it's later than you think the bride is prepared foreign all things are ready now the bridegroom I hear [Music] half an ear to [Music] hear oh sing it again all this is the evening time it's later than you think the bride is preparing now for the Lord all things are ready now the bridegroom I hear [Music] that has an ear to hear be The Time Is Here as they just play softly now brother Branham just kind of a lengthy quote but he says now when he was in his mediatorial work back there redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and we're we're part of that book we are the book and all that's in this book would be him for that's the believer the words in the book and the word is him and all that's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the Lamb's Book before the foundation of the world when he was slain as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she cannot recognize another headship no sir there's no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word and as the head was took up from the grave so must his body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word no man no denomination could put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it see you're dead hybrid right there she's back here see this testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing in spiritual adultery against the very word that she clings to believe therefore it's the word or nothing see that's right he is he the word how do you know it's right how do you know what works right see he the word is Vindicated he the word properly Vindicated is the
