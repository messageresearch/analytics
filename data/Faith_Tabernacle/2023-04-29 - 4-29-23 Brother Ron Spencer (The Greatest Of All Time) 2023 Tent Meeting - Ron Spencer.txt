the Lord you can have your seats just for a brief moment but we we just had a really wonderful time today in the Lord and brother Jonathan uh just delivered a powerful sermon and exalted the message of the hour and let us know the real purpose of this message and how that we are part of it and I have thoroughly enjoyed the services have you enjoyed the meeting amen it took us about two weeks to get everything prepared and I told the brothers that was helping I said you know what two weeks and then the meetings are going to fly by really fast and they have gone by real fast and it's hard to believe that we're we're almost here but you know what we the devil we ain't done with the devil yet and I know there's a lot of needs that are present and the devil's already been working today a man because he knows this time's coming tonight and and I I know that many of you are under great expectation for the miraculous to come and as brother Ron he will come and and Minister the word keep that expectation there don't let the devil hinder you don't let your mind wander don't let distractions come and and and hinder you you just keep that Faith right there because God's going to do something tonight I believe it because there's Believers here how many believers do we have amen now you know the prophet stoled in his prayer he said God I believe you're preparing the people to believe all things and I believe that we have been prepared Amen to believe all things we're going to take the limits off of God we're not a people that just believe God for a little bit and a little bit but we believe God for the impossibility when the doctor says there's no hope we still believe because he's the great physician and he has proved night after night after night during this week that he is present here with us amen and so I'm under great expectation and I I just want to Welcome All of You Amen to the the meeting and and words can't express from my heart from our church uh just how delighted we are to have you amen and just together to worship we draw strength from you and uh uh not only is our prayer that you are blessed when you leave the meeting but I I guarantee you that we're blessed a man to to be able to draw the strength from the fellowship and and togetherness and and uh and most of all the Lord Jesus being Among Us amen and uh so brother Ron is certainly No Stranger and uh to us and we're really honored that he would come and uh uh to minister to us tonight and and uh and so uh we want to just have him to come and take his time his Liberty and preach what God has upon his heart and uh let's just stand to our feet and maybe we could just sing the song I need thee or I need thee how many needs the Lord Hallelujah if you have need he's here to meet those needs I need thee oh I need thee yeah every hour I need thee yes we do [Music] bless me now by save your oh I come please sing it as a prayer hide me the old I need thee yes sir [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but maybe he feels like the spirit of the Lord Slipped Away [Music] cool the rapture won't you just let him settle that question in your life [Music] he's here to do that for you not a man why a man can't think unless he surrenders himself to the Lord but if Jesus comes he'll wait on your well he may wait on a culvert for your funeral procession to pass by he may wait there all day no doubt he's been waiting in this meeting just to touch your heart now I want you to just invite him now to where you're standing father in the name of Jesus a name that is above every name King above every King Lord we surrender ourselves to you I would say if we're all honest we we need more of you [Music] that's our desire that's brother Sean's for this meeting that you would come by speak to our home now Lord Jesus what incredible words that we've heard from Wednesday through this morning now Lord Jesus as we come to the prayer line service [Music] Lord now we ask you that the angels of God weep through this tent why you would come by for just one father Lord you see Erica Parker [Music] Lord I ask you to send your word to where she's at now brother Joe Greene's Sister Mary that has been taken back to the hospital Lord my my grandbaby that is here tonight that we want to pray for [Music] you can't talk Lord she could walk out of this building tonight totally healed how many more of us tonight that our lives can be changed and that change can be generational come now we pray we surrender ourselves to you Lord if if there's any place in our lives that we've embarrassed you forgive us Lord God touch our hearts now bless brother Sean and all the workers of this meeting every Minister that has come Lord I pray that you'd refill

father do you love him isn't he good to us amen bless you [Applause] I'd like to greet you from our church and all of our people that are here we thank you for being here I'd like to thank brother Sean publicly thank you privately but I'm thinking publicly for such an incredible tent that's a vision to you want to see the tent Vision it's happening brother Ron I'm waiting on my tent Vision it's happening for those that are waiting for a tent Vision it's here amen amen so thank you brother Sean for having us in each Minister that's came and preached and it's been just incredible I quit I quit preaching every service I packed my bags this morning and you know and somebody knocked at the door with a box of donuts and I stayed we certainly love you with all of our hearts I would like to say to you thank you for every prayer that you have prayed for me the last three years and we're we're fighting and we're fighting we're believing your mind we're here to take the chemo every day and prayer every day and uh you know there was a conversation between the prophet and the angel and they talked about people like us and he said not even cancer not even cancer maybe you don't know but I'll just share this with you and we'll take that a second but we our our battle is with brain cancer two different cancer tumors in my brains on my temples they're inoperable and uh but God could do the operation tonight without a sliver and then I have lung cancer but there's nothing impossible with God [Applause] I am going to do something that I normally don't do and come to a convention and preach in a fresh sermon so so here we are I want to preach to you tonight on the greatest of all time the greatest of time John chapter 18 and verse 36. and if Satan would like to pull up a seat and sit down he knows what's coming that's why he's fought us all day and Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Luke chapter 9 and verse 28. and it came to pass about an eight day after that these Saiyans that he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistening and behold their talk with him to men you're talking about standing in Two Worlds at the same time which were Moses and Elias who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem but Peter and they that were with him were happy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men which stood with him and it came to pass as they did they departed from him Peter said unto Jesus Master it is good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias not knowing what he had said and while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and and they fear fear as they entered into the cloud and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son here him you may be seated I would like to declare unto you since the Garden of Eden there's been War as a matter of fact the war started in heaven and I want to just make some parameters here God created his own enemy it'd be an interesting God so that there would be light he created Darkness so that he could be expressed in his own Glory he created his own enemy and then that we came from God and if I could just say it like this if you could just think about it like this before the foundation of the world you were there and the Lamb's Book was there and he possessed everything that was in it brother Branham termed it the physical the living physical attributes of God that are on the scene you're expressed now but you were in his mind before the foundation of the world now Satan who we've invited to take a seat he's lost every battle and I want to remind him every time he's went against God he's lost every battle so let's not give him any credit here and got it is the champion and he's never never never never never never been defeated and soul we know what our origin is we heard it this morning we've heard it this week we came from God and we're here and and brother Branham says he said God just don't make a tree to make a tree he don't just allow an automobile to just to see if it can be done he just didn't place you on the earth at this time now think about this he chose you to live in the darkest age that there would ever be to which even a prophet couldn't see through total darkness and he drawed in just a little bit of light because you were here now if God hasn't lost for six thousand years plus he's not going to lose here at the finish line [Applause] pilate didn't realize the the parameters of what he was standing against he thought that he had the power to crucify the Lord he thought that you know I could set him free that's what he thought but you see every Prophet since Abraham had been telling that he was on the way every one of those prophets had faced the same enemy every one of those prophets being born of man had weaknesses and strains of humanity in their life and when the enemy would come against him maybe it was moody maybe it was high temper maybe it was running from the presence of the Lord maybe it was idolatry a lot of things were written in their life but every one of them prophesied of there's one coming and they would preach it with all of their heart and they knew even building a temple to which God would answer prayer from that Temple and they would believe that God was over them but God had a greater desire to be with them and then in this day he wants to be in you not just in this tent not just in your church he wants to live in your temple [Applause] Jesus has made his way he's made his way walking through the Old Testament every one of those prophets gave a display of what God was like attributes of God was in display with Moses yet when Moses would come up against some great obstacles it was the voice behind The Voice that said let my people go Moses had disappointed himself he had disappointed his Brethren he had killed a man with his own energies but this time after he had met God himself because that's what he lacked was in the pillar of Fire if you ever meet that Pillar of Fire what's lacking on the inside of you is to have a personal experience with that same Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] this time he told Pharaoh let my people go [Applause] pharon listen didn't realize that Angels had gathered because there was a message on the earth now God was going to bring his seed from that bondage it wasn't an if it was going to happen he had met with the father of the faith [Applause] he'd met with him and told him that your children are going to be sojourners about 400 years even Joseph would grab a hold of the promise and said when I die don't you bury me here there's no Resurrection here there's no Resurrection in this denomination you carry my bones coming one [Applause] Moses watch this God would begin to work seeing the very spoken word of God come into existence yet Moses would stand and brother Branham would use the term the bloodiest scene in history was about to take place the greatest army in the entire world was facing down a group of people that now their hearts was hardened and now they were ready to mirror every one of them but let me just say Satan can only go so far he may be breathing down your neck tonight and fighting you with everything that's within you but he can only go so far you've got to turn around and tell him off off I'm a Child of God I've got more Authority in the angels in heaven [Applause] we're like Moses sometimes Moses began to cry out to God all he had seen and now he's standing there crying out to God and God just simply speaks to him don't cry out to me speak and go forward I'm telling that story for the morning you have the power to speak life and death in your tongues by your confession [Applause] we're not a bunch of sissies let's just get some things pretty straight here we're not a bunch of sissies we're not a bunch of panty waste half believers we haven't signed a church book just until we get our feelings hurt we're Sons and Daughters of God we know where we came from we know where we're going we will not be defeated we will not turn back we're not wishy-washy jellyfish backbone Christians we're bound to be spawn we're life of his life we're power of his power we are him [Applause] God knew you were coming he knew what our you'd be born he predestinated your coming he prepared for your coming brother Branham stood in great opposition delivering the message and maybe 99 of them didn't want it but it would lay there in seed form knowing you would arrive it will accomplish its purpose we're not wimps we're not tossed about every every wind of Doctrine we're warriors we're champions we've had some battles by now we've been battle tested look over at your neighbor and say we've been battle tested Duane and I I just cannot imagine Moses and Elijah's job today no doubt even in Jude it talks about that the devil has great accusation about words the body of Moses because he's the Accuser but God wouldn't let him be found maybe God was disappointed in him and told him he couldn't go across but he wouldn't let the enemy find his body Elijah was Moody but he was making a journey he knew it was coming toward his end and his associate pastor with him said why are you following me so close he said I want a double portion of what you got we've heard it preached this week it's our allotment it's our allotment we want to adopt a portion of what he's got and he said if you keep your eyes on me and when you see me go listen there wasn't a school of the message would turn him around it wasn't anybody that would turn him around he kept his eyes on Elijah when he came down to that water Elijah took that melon struck that water and he walked across on dry land when he got across there brother Brown said he picked a chariot said it was all kind of Chariots sitting around in the bushes and he picked his and leaving chariots for us and as Elijah ascends out you know it doesn't make a difference what the critic says when Elijah sends out he allows his mantle to drop down and you see Elisha Elisha was the one that had to be trimmed to fit Elijah's Mantle God don't trim the word for you he trims you for the word [Applause] he washes you he changes you he picks it up and goes right back to the same water whereas the Lord God of Elijah listen just because God took brother Branham off of the scene didn't mean God died [Applause] as a matter of fact he was just getting started [Applause] because God just doesn't send a message just to see if he can send a message now he's given a bride full Authority take the word and use it over time [Applause] does any of you ever get the idea that you second guess things am I at the right place you know you you get to a point God does things in your life and then you go to second guessing things the Miracles begin to pile up and they begin to pile up and now we're getting closer you know I asked for a double portion and you know you're seeing the Miracles and you come one short I can only imagine the Accuser that's here I can only imagine the accuser said you're one short no doubt some of the Believers around you know they would count and they would go well there's the bridge and there's the cloud and you you you you just don't understand Supernatural things and so Elisha dies you know if he was a Critic of the message you'd you'd put it in the on the internet but you see the story's not done yet now if we would have a credit cure tonight understand the story's not done yet but if you hang around long enough we won't need this tent no more if you hang around long enough there's going to be false teeth and glasses and [Applause] now there was a battle no way can you put all this together there's a battle going on and In the Heat of a battle a boy dies he's going to be a part of the testimony no doubt many of you are parts of testimonies and and as he dies these brothers are trying to carry him as far as they could carry him but they do wore out you can only carry a dead man so far [Applause] [Music] you know pastors we can only carry dead men so far but if you can throw him in on Elijah's bones Hallelujah if you can throw him in on Elijah's phones there's a radioactive promise still inside of them those phones may be going back to the ashes and the gases but there's a promises laying there the greatest of all time has made a promise [Applause] he didn't know how he got there he didn't know who threw him in all he knew was he felt better than he's felt in decades I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive [Applause] so in briefly I'll give you a little history of what these two Prophets were a part of in their natural life they'd seen the Red Sea they had seen 40 years they'd seen him go across they'd seen God feed two million people almost Supernatural sister Kimberly wouldn't you like God to do that and here's Elijah he's threw that mantle down and in that realm knowing all things he knew God brought it to pass so now you know I I don't know I don't have an answer here but I don't even pretend to have an answer but Moses and Elijah was wasn't done now you see every Prophet had pointed to this one and this one is now standing and he's coming toward Calvary now as he's coming toward Calvary and he's coming toward the the finishing up of redemption he he knows he's not here to come to have a family and he's not going to build churches but he's displayed God and in displaying God he's turned water into wine took a natural water and made the best fermented wine he's fed five thousand he's touched a leper he's walked to a a well and found a predestinated seed and that's the first one that he would tell I'm the greatest of all time there's been prophets but I'm him I'm him she gets religious well he knew she'd get religious like a lot of you but if he can just break through that religious Realm find the secret of her heart and when she recognizes who he is and it becomes a personal revelation to who she won't have to go to a school she'll go into a city and cause a Revival come and see a man no he's displayed who he is his personal friend Lazarus has come to a spot to where that he's got sick and you know no doubt the church member said if Jesus really was your friend he'd come back quickly you know if he was the kind of Pastor that he should be he wouldn't be away on a hunting trip you know if he was you know if he was and they just kept echoing in his ear and Jesus went four days but he's always on time now no doubt we understand through the prophet no doubt as he slipped from this Dimension and goes into Abraham's bosom if we can call it like that he begins to meet celebrities from the Old Testament no doubt they begin to share stories and Abraham would say it I met him I met him I was getting old he'd promised me we'd have a son Sarah remember how it was when we were sitting and you were sitting in there laughing and he had to remind you that there was nothing impossible I want to remind you tonight there's nothing impossible [Applause] there's nothing impossible to God brother Ron how can you preach Divine Healing when you're you've got cancer like you got it it's going to take a stronger win than this and if we could get just a little bowl Satan would have already took my life if he could if he could have he would have not took my life and so since he don't have the power to take my life I might as well stack my head my foot on his head and cut his head out amen now I'm going to come to your Pew if he could have [Applause] if he could have he would have took your life a long time ago because he sees you as an adversary he sees that Pillar of Fire he sees those angels around you if he could [Applause] he would take your life but the greatest of all time the champions of Champions lives on the inside of you and there's no good luck I caught baby now it would seem like just another meeting but God's called to me so Moses steps from this dimension to where Jesus is at I would say it's probably a half a step and he steps from that dimension and Elijah's with him they stop there he is now they're looking I with the one that they prophesied can you imagine what it felt like long for this day you met him as a pillar of fire in a burning bush and now he's standing there in his flesh God has came now in human flesh as a man now as the man brother Branham said looked at the word to see what the word said about him and it's a secret for you if you can look at the word to see what it says about you not seeing in and not Fox and not what those guys say and not what your critic says but when you look at God's Eternal Word about what it says about you now no doubt they could only tell him through the word and give him scriptures the scripture says that yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death have a fear no evil for thou art with me thyroid and thus death will comfort me who is the king of glory take him through the scriptures you're fulfilling that word you're fulfilling everything that Abraham talked about you everything that Jonah when Jonah was in that belly of the well that fish that was prepared he had to be in there three days that's where you'll be three days but there's work for you to do while you're in there you're going to go into the regions of hell and the accuser of the Brethren the one that has the keys of death hand on the grave the Trinity of hell you're going to defeat him [Applause] they looked at that word and the Word was looking back at them listen he needed that like you need it he needed it like you need it you need services like this oh brother on I don't have to go to church yes you do if you're a Christian you're going to go to church [Applause] and more than just go to church there's something on the inside of you it's got to respond to that word because you've got some things that you've got to accomplish the man Jesus needed to hear the word [Applause] you may think I'm way off course let me just say God had to leave him and let him die as a man what's their sermons effective I would say very much so he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and as they preached to him you must accomplish this [Applause] out of Adam's race is counting on you [Applause] all about them's race is counting on you every sick boy every sick girl everyone laying in the grave is counting on you to accomplish this task Williams prophets couldn't do it we were born in sin do you think Satan wasn't watching do you think he's not watching tonight we must accomplish this they would fly him to a blocker Satan would anoint men to beat him like no other human being would be beat to which those stripes would become so deep I'm telling his organs we begin to pulsate through his ribs scream moan he could have just nodded his head he could have just nodded his head he could have called Ten Thousand Angels one of them would have changed the whole scene brother Ron I don't know all about that well let me just give you a little story brother random Sydney he said he said those three Hebrew children were getting ready to go into the fiery furnace wormwood became before God and said father are you watching what's going on down there with your children I can go down there and change the whole seat I destroyed the world with water [Applause] other Angels came and said I can go down and I can do it no I'm gonna go myself let me just say in the deepest darkest trial of your life he comes himself [Applause] he's always on time it doesn't matter what your circumstances are it doesn't matter what your problems are it doesn't matter if there's ten thousand demons that are against you he's on his way men were killed throwing them into the fire these men walked into that fire and they had an old-fashioned conference with God they had a conference with God that's where God will meet you you said brother Ron but I've been going through the darkest difficulties in my life I feel like they're coming to an end I don't know what to do with tomorrow if you would just look around in your furnace if you'll just look around in your furnace of Fire the licks of fire may be over your head but if you'll look long enough you'll see him standing there right there with you Satan would destroy you with one lift of fire if he could but because God standing there in your fire he can't touch you [Applause] because you just wait I need to change the scene they his angels didn't understand you were on the way and he said I've got to do this because I Got A Boy Named Ron he's going to be told that he's only got four months to live but three years later he's going to be preaching just as strong as he's ever preached because I'm with him in the fire you may not see him you may not feel him but he's with you bird ever now Satan you've heard these quotes before us but I'd like for you to listen again he ain't got one legal power Jesus Christ stripped him of everything that he had on couch the full sin penalty was paid at Calvary and the devil has no legal right at all he's nothing but a big block of Jesus's Works was complete everything was complete totally delivered he totally delivered the leopard from leprosy eternally delivered a woman with a blood issue he totally delivered the world from sin and when he died on that day in job atonement he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live underprivileged children come on now there's no need for us to live in a defeated state because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities in power and subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost [Applause] we don't have to let the devil dictate to us Christ delivered us he delivered us from Talking he delivered us from the back guard he delivered us from all kinds of smutty things he delivered us and put us in the Holy hands he delivered us from sicknesses he delivered us for we have an abstract titled deed for he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed he is our healer these men will lay hands on you in a little while but they're not your healer he is your healer but they've got god-given rights they have more power than the angels of God that's him they're under the jurisdiction to take God at his work lay hands on the sick and they shall recover expect to be healed expect to be delivered whether on but it's impossible expect them [Applause] Satan you are defeated men you have no legal rights to begin with to torment these people you're a bluff we're calling your bluff Jesus Christ defeated you at Calvary why don't you say that Jesus Christ defeated the devil at Calvary turn to your neighbor [Applause] this brother Brown said now are we Sons and Daughters of God not someday not some fairy tale way off now now it's a present tense brother bear said I hate the devil and he hates me I love it none of these guys are want to be on the top 10 greatest preachers we don't we don't need that but I would like to be known on Satan's list of most hated brother Wayne I've got a good idea we're on that list I defy every devil and take this mountain by faith who are you great mountain of sickness that would stand before the Lord why you'll become as a plane who are we are coming over we're coming over to the promised land heal every one of these Lord Heal every one of these second present that's sick or brother Branham was here a greater than our Prophet is here [Applause] now can I increase your courage just for a few moments this has been a great help to me we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the land into the grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender we'll fight for our families we'll fight for our children we'll fight for our healing we'll fight for our deliverance we fight for our joy we fight for our peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost we'll fight until our bodies are changed we'll fight until we're sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb we shall Never Surrender on the roughest of days in our lowest hours even in those times we're still children of God we're still chosen blessed favored forgiven lad LED of God Victorious and heritors of all of Heaven's Glory privileged to walk with our Our God and our creator we're married to the King of Kings the Lord of lords he calls us his wife we're strong in faith armed to fight Devils entrusted with God's word the most powerful weapon we're protected by the army of the almighty he has placed a hedge about us we have an assurance that every time that we call he hears any answers and he always answers our prayer found this your while back I asked God why are you taking me through Troubled Water and God replied back because your enemies can't swim it's the real thing brother on that was poetry that's really nice writing by somebody that was inspired I'd say they was inspired so since you liked it I'm going to give you some direct inspiration the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I feel the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't trap against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire him is simple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock [Applause] and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sink in trouble what should I do sing brother Ron I I just have trouble with all this emotion well I got some quotes for you you know they went to a random meeting so happened brother Brandon was there and somebody got excited and you know a critical always find the preacher and he said brother Brandon I was really enjoying that for a while all of a sudden that brother that sister back there got the squealing and praising the Lord and shouting it just made chills go all over me brother Brown had a good response whatever you do don't go to heaven [Applause] whatever you do don't go to heaven he said you free to hell as a matter of fact this is the quietest World you'll ever be in now if you just happen to be one of them self-religious and don't believe in Emotion there's a place called hell and in hell they're not going to be partying there's going to be weeping and wailing and gnashing the teeth everybody's going to be enemies down there it's going to be nice so you better praise God why you got the chance so what you need to hear is the autopsy of a dead Church what killed your church when you when you stop praising the Lord when you preach like a Badness [Applause] when you don't want no emotion in your church I got a quote for you anything that's without emotion is dead and it needs to be burned you want to know where God's at he inhabits the Praises of his people you want to make God happy just start worshiping him a little bit start taking your lips and start praising him start rejoicing lift up those hands Larry [Applause] now I want to give you a simple solution preachers that can't preach the Holy Ghost can't preach fire it's because they don't have any [Applause] and a man that don't have the Holy Ghost can't preach you into an atmosphere to where you can get it for yourself [Applause] and if your church ain't got fire in it move move get up and move get up and move I don't care what your job is get up and move go find a church it's got the Holy Ghost on the inside of it where God is welcome where is welcome or you can praise it this ain't no time for dead churches brother Ryan but you're preaching on the greatest of all time yes he's here and we need to worship Him [Applause] well I'm gonna need a quote well I'm gonna give you some not just what let me give you one Praise You the Lord praise God in his sanctuary Praise Him in the Famine of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him for his excellent graces praise him with the sound of the Temple praise it was a sorcery and a heart Joe God God loves to hear your worship praise him up on loud symbols praise him on my high sound and simple let everything that half breath and everything that has breath praise ye the Lord [Applause] now listen you have an excuse if you're dead we'll give you a pass if you're dead if you don't have a heartbeat your brain's not functioning anymore you got excuses your neck but the Bible says [Applause] this is God's word [Applause] you won't take my word this is God's word let everything that has breath brother Ron do you really believe that have you seen that guy singing birds I believe this message with all my heart we ought to worship it with everything that's within us and you're welcome to put your flims excuse up against the guy that's got brain cancer and lung cancer [Applause] [Music] my arm hurts brother Ron my knee hurts I'm afraid if I would start saying amount too loud into my I'd get laryngitis it didn't bother you at a ball game I might as well go ahead and kill this devil while I'm at it when you were serving the devil you paid 300 for your tickets you drove eight and ten hours to go to a ball game you sit there with people that you knew were Hypocrites they spilled beer on you they smoked around on you foreign [Applause] off in the middle of cold air [Applause] why can't we worship God we are the redeemed we're what he wanted to accomplish why can't we worship God [Applause] [Music] I just don't believe it brother Ron you're a powder puff cheerleader [Applause] you're a fit you're only an impersonator you're an actor if I ain't said it right you're just another religious message believer sitting among us but there happened to be some real born-again Church of the Living God that is here I am not ashamed I am not ashamed [Applause] Make a Joyful Noise under the Lord all you Lance that takes care of every custom that takes care of every culture so if you're white black pink yellow every one of us have a responsibility to Worship the Lord but you've got to break to those Prison Walls let go and let God have his way [Applause] I think it's time for us to have a breakthrough [Applause] brother Ron I don't like this kind of preaching you're dismissed I mean it you're dismissed don't sit here and anger don't don't sit here I'll let Set just because you're backslidden and you ain't met the pillifier for yourself you're dismissed [Applause] oh brother on but brother random one like that let me just remind you I've been around a while there were many nights after brother Branham got done preaching he started swinging his coat over top of his head and started walking the altar [Applause] double portion [Applause] I've only got to the good part do you mean to tell me that shamgar when he jumped out of that window with that six foot stick and killed 600 demos [Applause] do you think he didn't dance for a little while when he seen 600 Devils dead Parts in him year after year after year after day he realized that he was a Seed of Abraham and he took that stick why don't you take your stick tonight the greatest of all time is with you take your steps do you think those three Hebrew children would just stacked down there going there was a party there was a party going on brother Ron in our church the sisters can't say Amen they have to sit quiet oh so you're in the wrong Church [Applause] well you see in our church you want an example you see these people had been tortured for 400 years they've been beat they've been separated they've been told they were nothing but mud daubers but now there's a message that's come that said you're the Seed of Abraham that you're children of God that God's got a promise for you you don't have to stay in prison no longer you're not a slave to the enemy anymore if I can get you to believe who you are and start taking steps just walk with me for a little while just believe the message a little while he's with us he's with us he's with us [Applause] well brother Ron we have our sisters over on this side and the brothers on the other side okay well let's say it was in that church too and all those sisters is over there and I believe the count of them was about 600 000 of them is there a tambourine in this house I've always wanted to play a tambourine Well Ron we don't allow tambourines in our church oh understand because it's dead foreign [Applause] I don't have to check my sugar I've been I've been eating on the the honey now if I could get you to look at your enemy like myram looked at hers that tormentors can't bother you no more it don't matter what you used to be once the blood is applied and once God comes into your life you're not that guy no longer [Applause] prostitute but you're not my guy no longer you know I've never made up a song but I feel a little inspiration a few days ago I was a slave but they're dead now I seen wallowing in a watery grave they're dead now she began to plant [Applause] and she started dancing can you imagine what a this storm is I want to tell you you're enemy is dead and greater than Moses showed up I'm greater than Elijah showed up a greater than William Branham showed up the mighty Angel himself showed up and he is determined I will have a bride she will be with that spot or blemish I don't care what the devil says about them [Applause] for the run but that just sounds so silly well you know what I believe if if he would decide to tell his angels boys I'm going to grab a zigzag lightning and I'm going to go down and be with the boys today did we not have a rain this week and he said boys I y'all just keep doing what you're doing I'm going to Sean's meet I'm on a I'm on a fellowship with him a little while they're gonna feel my presence in the room they're going to get beside themselves a little while [Applause] in the Book of Revelations it says I'm just about done John thought it was all lost he thought it was all lost he thought there was no hope no man was Worthy Moses wentworthy Elijah wasn't worthy William Mary Brandon wasn't Worthy not being disrespectful I'm not being disrespectful he thought it was all over we thought it was all over it's not up to a man but he thought so much of you in this book he didn't even let the accuser be a part of it it's you and God it isn't no wonder you shout when you see your name in the book [Applause] just go ahead and just raise your hands to him just now brother Joel you work in the medical field you've did that a long time when they say it's impossible you know better you know my daughter was told that she couldn't have babies it would be totally impossible for her to have a baby my son-in-law is here they're here somewhere he was in an accident with his pelvis crushed completely and I was standing there when the doctor told him it's impossible for you to have a child you raise your hand somewhere for the run but God don't do them things no more it was in Louisiana in the same moment that Mariah in that prayer line Mariah who was occupation was impossible for her hair to grow back and she walked into that prayer line with three bobby pins with expectation that after tonight I want to catch the theme after tonight one Miracle after another miracle after another miracle sister Connie had sarcoidosis sister Connie standing right there it was in her lungs and the doctors it took the officer's cancer she won't live two weeks it had bothered her and bothered her listen she's totally sarcoidosis free right now I was weak in the prayer line and sister Jessica just raise your hand sister Jessica was in that prayer line I didn't know how far back we'd prayed for hundreds and the Lord spoke to me yes he does that he spoke to me and said wait for Jessica I didn't know what he needed you stepped in that prayer line I mean we're standing there when that happened I know you was Timothy where's he at what you doing back there and when you came before me in the prayer line the Lord spoke to you through lips and said I'd give you your son where's he at come come since we have an accuser let's stomp on his head a little bit [Applause] I mean he's heard Aaron Oglesby preach it was that night in the cabin the Lord spoke through our lips and said after this night you'll never be the same God's calling you to preach you'll never be the same that's my God I'm gonna take my time right here because I saw a vision just only seconds after that we're gonna have a little boy totally impossible little boy and I saw him God's God's absolutely accurate I saw him the yard as I'm coming across the yard in a Mickey Mouse shirt I'm not here to debate whether God likes Mickey Mouse or not sister Katie came through the prayer line brother Andrew's wife she was having miscarriages and the Lord spoke to me said it's in her womb and the next time the angel of the Lord drops in the building you call them up to pray for them is Right called them up to pray for him six weeks later she went to the doctor Reagan and Ally are you here don't no no no no no don't leave there's two little girls getting ready to come and while they're coming is he awake I put him to sleep a lot is Charlie in the building go ahead Grandma you can bring him in North Carolina in the prayer line there was critics that was against me that night tried to shut us down I said if God can't operate out here he'll operate behind the curtain they couldn't have children he sure looks like a fine little boy foreign [Applause] Jackson you're in the building they went home well I'll tell your story or without you they hadn't been able to have children for 16 years and behind that curtain God gave them their child a very healthy baby and I want to go further than that I know you two just got married you're somewhere in this building sister Betty her husband had said in it had said in church for decades how long were you married almost how much you don't look that old and he spoke these words I can serve a God Like That and in that moment he became a real Christian with God there's no accidents within a month he found out he had cancer four months later I I stood at his funeral and I declared to that huge audience this man met God cancer couldn't take it I want you to say this you there's not a devil in hell can take you until God's finished with you I remember in Ohio when God called you to preach as you walked through a prayer line don't tell me God don't work in prayer lines we could talk of truth that couldn't walk and we saw a vision I turned to Timothy and said I see a vision of little Drew walking and I asked Bethany where's that and he's in the he's at a bassinet I believe it was that boy ran in a cancer Marathon for me last year I want you to just look this is the same God of Abraham and Abraham enjoyed work enjoyed that Isaac's company so do I Isaac was only a dream but he ain't no dream no longer now Isaac what my job is to do is to get these people to believe that what I'm telling about you is true because some people don't believe God does Miracles anymore but God does miracles and he's a miracle working God now you see there's some wombs out there that really need to give birth and if they can look at you and see that if God can do that for them there's some pawpaws out there that's waiting on a promise and if God could do that for brother Ron [Applause] you see I was writing down the Miracles that happened that one night and I'm sorry but I have forgot to write yours down and the Lord spoke to me and said remember Jessica I gave her her son sister Connie was on the other side of the house and she came running and said I don't know what you're into but I just felt him all the way on the other side of the house the devil tried to destroy you but God's not into losing business and I want to tell you every time your enemy tries to defeat you just go back and said hey you couldn't destroy me back there you can't have me now is he your God too these are your God too no I suffer is you your God too you see your God too you don't need nobody to discern your problem you don't need nobody to tell you what your name is your God when it looks like you're bankrupt and you can't make it through another dollar feels like the devil's whispering in your ear I don't know how you're going to make it through tomorrow listen my God owns the cattle in a thousand hills [Applause] of the Downham police she's going to be well I just believe she's going to be around the first year we had this meeting here brother Sean asked me to come yep and I was praying on our farm area I said Lord I don't know what to speak and he said you speak these words this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous mother Sean I don't care how much the devil wrestles against it God has voted for it you've been wrestling to be wrestling with your own gift the devil's been intimidated you he's been telling you you're a failure isn't that right isn't that right but I want to tell that devil look around look around God told you your daddy didn't call you your mama didn't call you the place that gift in your life God's not gonna take it away from you Sean Martin God placed that gift there and there's not enough intimidation of hell they'll give us nothing but a liar [Applause] [Applause] you on the hill this evening getting that right not me he met you on the hill you're free now sister Jessica you'll go home with a different man when you went home with a different man sister Betty God took him home and he he gave you a second chance at love brother Luther the Lord let your wife go beyond the bell of Tears and you got a new best friend I wish you could see what I see now I just wish you could see no I'm not trying to make you think I'm something special I'm wondering I'm wanting to introduce you to the greatest of all time now many years ago my grandfather owned this property be on this property he decided to sell it but my grandma had a vision of who Elijah was and when my daddy gave her a book of the way of the true Prophet one to which I carry every day back then they had brother Brandon's picture on the inside of it and when she opened the book she said that's Elijah that's who I saw in a vision that's him I believe this message she'd never the first word my granddad tried to sell this property had a huge auction about 300 people was here to buy this property God stopped the auction because we needed to have this meeting around this Bend there's a white house it's cinder block I think they've got it covered over now there was a man came to our house I was four years old and he was hungry and asked if there was anything to eat and my mom had gravy and biscuits on the stove all Christians have gravy and biscuits ought to have been the best day man in the house and she fed that man gravy and biscuits he had that completion right there brother Diego raise your hand Dad tried to talk to him but he just didn't say much but as you walked out of the the house he turned around and he put his hand on my head this is a blessed child now that may not mean nothing to you but it sure does to me but what has made this meeting special under this tent that was 58 years ago and while brother Wendell Martin was preaching thirsty Thursday night as he was preaching and saying his throat was bad his voice was bad the enemy was fighting that angel that I saw at four years old was standing right there [Applause] and there's many angels here tonight the presence of God is all over this building he has come with a purpose to meet your need he
