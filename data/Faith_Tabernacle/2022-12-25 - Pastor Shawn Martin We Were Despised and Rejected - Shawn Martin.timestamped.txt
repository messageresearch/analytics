[40:48] because I tell you what it's just flat
[40:50] code and we

[40:56] many split uh is it many splits I guess

[41:08] far as upstairs and but uh We've uh
[41:12] We've endured and I just thank god for
[41:15] heat
[41:16] I'll tell you why you know you just
[41:18] don't think you just you just don't
[41:21] think about it you know but especially
[41:23] in the summertime but uh I thank the
[41:26] Lord for heat and
[41:28] does I thank the Lord most of all that
[41:31] we're able to just gather and to worship
[41:33] Him
[41:34] amen and if you have your Bibles we're
[41:37] going to turn to the the book of Isaiah
[41:40] the 53rd chapter
[41:42] and
[41:46] Isaiah 53
[42:01] and we will read the start at the first
[42:04] verse
[42:08] but it says who hath believed our report
[42:10] into whom is the arm of the Lord
[42:13] revealed
[42:14] for he shall grow up before him as a
[42:17] tender plant
[42:19] as they root out of a dry ground
[42:22] ye hath no form nor comeliness and when
[42:26] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[42:28] we should desire him
[42:30] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[42:34] of sorrow
[42:35] and acquainted with grief and we hid as
[42:39] it were our faces from him
[42:42] he was despised and we
[42:44] esteemed him not
[42:48] surely he hath borne or Grieves and
[42:51] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[42:54] him stricken
[42:55] smitten of God
[42:57] and afflicted
[42:59] amen let's just bow our heads
[43:03] to our father
[43:06] as we come here this morning Lord to
[43:09] worship you to glorify you
[43:13] Lord we've come because it's in our
[43:16] heart to do so
[43:19] father for we're so thankful for a day
[43:22] Lord such as this
[43:26] a time to remember a time to think
[43:31] of what you've done for us Lord
[43:34] no father we're just asking that you
[43:37] would take what simple words that I
[43:38] would have today
[43:41] or that you would just anoint them but
[43:44] not me Lord I pray
[43:47] anointed people
[43:49] father and may we
[43:52] just be drawn Closer to You Lord
[43:56] may we realize more and more
[44:00] father the blessings that we have
[44:04] Lord by you sending your son
[44:08] Lord and you dwelling in that Tabernacle
[44:12] for us Lord
[44:14] we thank you we praise you glorify you
[44:18] in Jesus name we pray
[44:20] amen
[44:22] you can have your seats this morning
[44:27] and
[44:28] this may seem to be an odd
[44:35] text that we would read for Christmas
[44:39] Day
[44:41] but first of all we we do have a lot to
[44:45] be thankful for
[44:47] today as we Ponder what Christmas is all
[44:51] about
[44:52] and
[44:54] um I I know there's
[44:56] various thoughts and ideas about
[44:59] Christmas and
[45:01] some are just totally absolutely against
[45:04] it and don't
[45:06] want to have nothing to do with with the
[45:09] day
[45:11] but yet a prophet would keep a balance
[45:13] to it and we've we've talked on them
[45:16] before on things but
[45:18] he told us it was a pagan day he told us
[45:21] it was a
[45:24] um you know all everything about it
[45:27] pretty much is is paganism
[45:32] but yet then the prophet would bring out
[45:35] and he would say but if there had not
[45:37] been no Christmas
[45:38] there would be no Resurrection
[45:41] if there'd been no Christmas there had
[45:43] been no love there had been no peace
[45:46] there had been no Hereafter for the
[45:48] believer
[45:49] if there had been no Christmas
[45:51] so I think that even though Christ was
[45:56] not born on December in the month of
[45:59] December
[46:01] we still should we we should still hold
[46:04] this day as a day of worship
[46:07] and to honor what God has done
[46:11] and for sending his son and of course we
[46:16] know that brother Branham did
[46:18] um he took time for Christmas
[46:22] um there and and I know even there was
[46:25] kind of maybe different ones uh not not
[46:29] here in the assembly but uh different
[46:32] ones were being questioned about uh why
[46:35] we would you know sing Christmas songs
[46:37] and how wrong it was and all and
[46:40] so I uh I I I know some folks uh that
[46:45] that went to the Branham Tabernacle and
[46:48] growing up and you know they they one
[46:52] brother told me said we you know I uh
[46:56] um I went there and brother Collins done
[46:58] everything the way brother Brown did it
[47:00] to a t the best he could and he said we
[47:03] always sung Christmas songs
[47:06] and um and another brother said well
[47:08] I've talked to a family member uh that
[47:12] grew up in the Tabernacle with brother
[47:15] Branham and and said he always always
[47:18] took time for Christmas always took time
[47:21] to sing songs always you know and so uh
[47:26] I thank God that we we had a prophet
[47:30] that would that kept balance
[47:32] and that would
[47:36] um let us know that there's something
[47:38] about Christmas that we ought to think
[47:41] about we ought to ponder we ought to
[47:43] look into and and
[47:46] um you know when we were growing up we'd
[47:48] never done anything like that and that
[47:50] was apostolics you know we we just were
[47:53] taught not to and and all that and and
[47:56] so when we come into the message we find
[47:59] that there is a balance and there is
[48:01] something that as a as a believer that
[48:04] we can we can look to and be thankful
[48:07] for even though this day
[48:10] is is not the a real day that Christ was
[48:14] born and the world has set this for this
[48:18] side of this day yet we will we will
[48:22] take this day as an honor to God
[48:27] and so
[48:29] um again
[48:30] the opening scripture uh uh may be a
[48:34] little odd uh for this day but
[48:39] the person that Isaiah is speaking of
[48:43] is the same person that was born
[48:47] uh on the first Christmas ain't that
[48:51] right
[48:51] and and so we we find that this person
[48:57] is the reason why Christmas exists
[49:02] amen and so uh there wouldn't be a
[49:07] Christmas if Jesus wasn't born
[49:10] I appreciate your life I appreciate your
[49:13] birth
[49:13] but it didn't make it Christmas
[49:16] and my birth did not make a Christmas
[49:18] but Jesus birth did and uh so we we find
[49:25] that there had been millions of babies
[49:28] born before before Jesus was ever born
[49:32] and yet there was no Christmas
[49:35] but there's something special about this
[49:38] person
[49:40] Jesus ain't that right
[49:42] and so uh his birth is the only reason
[49:46] why we have Christmas or why we should
[49:50] have Christmas and why it means so much
[49:53] to the believer
[49:56] we know he was the beginning of the
[50:00] creation of God no other child no other
[50:03] baby no no other other one was the
[50:07] beginning but he was and we know that
[50:11] Mary was overshadowed by by God and God
[50:16] created a blood cell uh in her womb and
[50:22] then the prophet said God himself come
[50:24] into the womb a Virgin Mary and wrapped
[50:28] himself in a created blood cell
[50:31] so this was God making the first
[50:34] Christmas God and and
[50:38] um it it it was a blessed time Mary had
[50:43] nothing to do with it no man had
[50:45] anything to do with it it was the blood
[50:48] cell that developed that created blood
[50:51] cell that God created in the womb of
[50:54] Mary that developed into the son of God
[50:57] amen and so it happened without Mary
[51:01] knowing any man in the way of
[51:04] relationship brother Branham said it was
[51:07] God's creative blood that he created in
[51:11] order to redeem us so this birth we we
[51:15] ought to be excited about the birth of
[51:18] Jesus Christ amen and um it's so sad
[51:23] that people want to do away with the
[51:25] quotes and all that about what brother
[51:27] Brown said about Christmas because they
[51:28] get so staunch in their in their
[51:31] legalistic ways or we could even say at
[51:34] Pentecostal Apostolic uh whatever ways
[51:37] they were before they come and do the
[51:39] message but we we find that if it had
[51:42] not been for the birth of Jesus Christ
[51:44] you wouldn't be redeemed and so uh I
[51:49] don't care what the pagans do with it I
[51:52] don't care what they what the world does
[51:54] with the day of Christmas we understand
[51:56] that uh why there there was a Christmas
[52:00] and that was if God didn't take the
[52:03] initiative to redeem you amen then where
[52:07] would we be so God's the one that took
[52:10] the initiative I don't care what day
[52:12] they call it Christmas uh day Bozo day
[52:15] whatever day they want to call it I
[52:17] don't care but this is the day that we
[52:20] set aside to say we thank God Amen for
[52:24] his son ain't that right and so we we
[52:27] find that that it was God that he
[52:31] created blood cell that he created in
[52:34] order to redeem us and came and lived in
[52:37] the same body that he created therefore
[52:40] seek God had to suffer Temptation he
[52:44] couldn't suffer Temptation he had to
[52:46] suffer sexual Temptation he had to
[52:49] suffer all kinds of Temptation to be
[52:51] tempted by the devil in riches and
[52:53] powers and dominions and so forth he had
[52:57] to suffer all of that in order to do it
[53:00] he couldn't be as God in spirit he had
[53:03] to be God in flesh ain't that right amen
[53:07] so in in another place he says I think
[53:10] that God had it in his mind that it
[53:14] would be appealing to the human being
[53:17] and then he says it is to the believer
[53:20] it is to the believer it is appealing
[53:24] when our God becomes one of us but to
[53:28] the starchy ungodly it's a stumbling
[53:31] block
[53:32] so he says I'll give you the sign a
[53:35] virgin shall conceive Emmanuel will be
[53:39] with you seek God thought it would be
[53:43] appealing to the human race that our God
[53:46] would become one of us that he would
[53:48] cross himself and become our dust that
[53:52] he would become our stock a human stock
[53:56] the Creator who made all things now I I
[54:00] have to tell you that's appealing to me
[54:02] that's appealing that God would become
[54:05] man it's it's more appealing than the
[54:08] Christmas trees it's more appealing than
[54:10] the gifts it's more appealing than the
[54:12] Santa Clauses it's more appealing than
[54:14] the lights it's I I there's something
[54:17] appealing to the believer about
[54:18] Christmas
[54:20] and that is God becoming us God becoming
[54:24] one crossing a man to where he could
[54:28] become us and so what what we see about
[54:30] Christmas is that it was it the real
[54:33] heart of God for the prophet said that
[54:36] Jesus was God's love gift to us
[54:39] what a gift he could not give any
[54:41] greater gift if you would have thought
[54:43] of that you know because sometimes we
[54:45] Ponder now what gift can I give you know
[54:48] my wife or a family member or or
[54:50] whatever what what could I give and you
[54:52] want to give something special amen so
[54:55] God wanting to give the gift and he
[54:57] wants of course God being the best and
[54:59] the perfect he wants to give the perfect
[55:01] gift amen and he realizes there ain't no
[55:04] other gift that is so perfect as he
[55:06] coming himself and offering his life for
[55:10] you and I can you say amen and you
[55:12] realize that gift still goes on today
[55:14] he's still given himself in this age
[55:17] what a gift ain't that right but you
[55:20] would think that the world would have
[55:22] been awestruck at the reality of God
[55:26] becoming a baby and growing up as a
[55:30] child and and as a teenager into
[55:33] adulthood and you would Assad that would
[55:37] have been awesome to the people and the
[55:40] people would have just stood in all to
[55:42] see that God becoming one of them eating
[55:45] with them talking with them hearing them
[55:48] and and uh just just being one of them
[55:51] and especially the Jews which were God's
[55:55] people that had the promises of of the
[55:58] Messiah you know they they had the
[56:00] promise and letter formed by the
[56:03] prophets and by the songs and and the
[56:06] the the the the the the scribes and and
[56:09] all of these things and uh and and the
[56:12] Jews sang songs about him they they
[56:15] heard sermons about him they they read
[56:19] about him coming they they they even
[56:22] said that they were expecting the
[56:25] Messiah to come so you would think these
[56:28] people would have been ready to receive
[56:31] such a one as when he came and then we
[56:35] find out they missed him when he came
[56:38] what what would cause the people that
[56:41] sung about him that claimed to know him
[56:44] that saw the supernatural Works what
[56:47] what would cause them that that would
[56:50] say we're expecting we're looking for
[56:52] messiah to come and yet they missed him
[56:55] they they missed him all together and so
[56:58] I I thought been thinking about our
[57:00] scripture reading and uh because our our
[57:04] scripture reading does not just pertain
[57:07] to him at Calvary even though we we look
[57:11] at it in that way for he was wounded for
[57:14] our transgression he was bruised for our
[57:17] iniquity and by his stripes we are
[57:20] healed and yes he he didn't receive that
[57:23] until the end of his his life and and
[57:26] and at the crucifixion but but I I think
[57:29] what we've read today uh uh is
[57:32] applicable Amen to such a time as as as
[57:37] the birth and and all all of his life
[57:40] because it was all of his life that he
[57:44] was despised and and rejected all of his
[57:48] life there was no Beauty in him that we
[57:51] we would desire him you know there there
[57:54] was no Beauty in Messiah laying in the
[57:57] manger that there there was no desire
[58:00] both thing about him laying in a place
[58:04] that was smelly and uh stunk and and
[58:08] animal hair no doubt may be flying
[58:11] around and uh in the air in that in that
[58:14] barn or that manger or whatever and uh
[58:18] you know but but but it it yet it was
[58:21] Messiah that was born ain't that rhyme
[58:25] and so uh you know someone had made the
[58:29] comment the other day uh to another and
[58:32] and and said you know they were talking
[58:34] about what is their favorite thing about
[58:36] Jesus that they loved and and one on you
[58:40] know uh in in innocence but but made the
[58:43] the statement my favorite thing is that
[58:46] he was so uh uh carefree and and no
[58:51] problems no worries and oh if I could
[58:55] you know just I I I'd like to live that
[58:57] life uh they say and and uh and that was
[59:01] their their their favorite thing about
[59:03] Jesus and but on the contrary his life
[59:07] wasn't a Carefree life he has his life
[59:10] wasn't a life of just happy-go-lucky and
[59:13] and and these things uh uh we find that
[59:17] he was the most despised man I I think
[59:21] you know you know I I think you know
[59:23] that that uh Trump Donald Trump is is
[59:26] you know probably as a politician the
[59:30] most hated man on the earth and but yet
[59:33] it it it it of all the hate that is
[59:36] toward that man yet there there can't be
[59:39] another man most hated as Jesus was he
[59:45] was despised you understand
[59:47] not only the people were hated him but
[59:51] demons hated him uh the the spiritual
[59:54] Darkness hell hated him death hated him
[59:58] everything uh visible and invisible uh
[1:00:03] he was despised and he was the most
[1:00:05] hated man the most misunderstood man and
[1:00:09] and the Bible even tells us that at the
[1:00:11] time of the birth there was no room for
[1:00:15] him in the end ain't that right and and
[1:00:19] and and what a a setting for a life amen
[1:00:23] at the very beginning no room no room in
[1:00:27] the end and how we have have seen it
[1:00:30] that it just didn't just go in the in in
[1:00:33] the end no room but there was no room in
[1:00:36] the churches for him that there was no
[1:00:39] in the world for him that there was no
[1:00:42] room in society for him there there was
[1:00:45] no room in in religion for him you
[1:00:48] understand what I'm saying and and so
[1:00:51] even when he became a man did he not
[1:00:53] tell his disciples that foxes have holes
[1:00:56] the birds have nests and and and yet the
[1:00:59] son of man has no place to lay his head
[1:01:02] and I understand that that that could
[1:01:04] have been or we use that in this
[1:01:06] spiritual application but but let's look
[1:01:09] at as as in the in the natural he had no
[1:01:12] home to go to he of his own he he had to
[1:01:16] borrow a boat he had to you know to get
[1:01:18] across the sea he had to borrow a grave
[1:01:21] a man even to be buried in he everything
[1:01:25] uh that that that uh uh he done he had
[1:01:29] to borrow these things uh hear the king
[1:01:32] of Heaven that that could have spoke
[1:01:34] about that could have you know that
[1:01:36] could have provided his own grave that
[1:01:38] could have provided everything that he
[1:01:41] wanted he could have had a home he could
[1:01:43] have had a wife he could have had
[1:01:44] children he could have he could have had
[1:01:46] all these things but and and and yet uh
[1:01:49] and and I'm sure he was tempted for the
[1:01:52] Bible says he was tempted in all points
[1:01:54] such as we were so he did have them
[1:01:58] sexual Temptations he did have them them
[1:02:01] uh uh times of Temptations just to walk
[1:02:04] away from the ministry and and and live
[1:02:07] a normal life and and and uh uh uh and
[1:02:11] and all these things so so uh this
[1:02:13] wasn't a man that that was popular a man
[1:02:16] we even read about uh uh Simeon or Simon
[1:02:21] I believe it was that it invited him to
[1:02:24] the banquet that he was going to put on
[1:02:26] and Jesus came at that invitation and
[1:02:29] and and when he got there he was
[1:02:32] overlooked and and he was not welcome
[1:02:34] they didn't wash his feet and like like
[1:02:37] it was custom they didn't uh anoint him
[1:02:41] like it was custom he stunk and and he
[1:02:44] was uh uh uh uh you know dirty feet and
[1:02:48] sitting in the corner and and it wasn't
[1:02:51] that he was overlooked it was dead he
[1:02:53] was not welcome there was no room for
[1:02:56] that banquet for him they just wanted
[1:02:58] him for sport they just wanted him
[1:03:01] whatever but it wasn't a true genuine
[1:03:04] desire a man to have him there amen and
[1:03:08] so we we find that brother Brown said
[1:03:11] they'd have nothing to do with such a
[1:03:13] fellow as that but way down deep in
[1:03:15] their heart they knew who he was for
[1:03:18] Nicodemus plainly stated that Rabbi see
[1:03:22] we the Pharisees we know that you're a
[1:03:24] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:03:27] the things that you do except God be
[1:03:30] with him why didn't he confess him then
[1:03:33] is because their Camp had set its
[1:03:36] boundary and wouldn't let him in the
[1:03:39] camp it wouldn't let anybody go out to
[1:03:43] him see they they had their own Camp
[1:03:46] he'd come by night when the gate was
[1:03:48] really closed but he found that he could
[1:03:51] met uh he couldn't met him anyhow he
[1:03:54] said yes and the same now he's become a
[1:03:56] stranger a foreigner they don't
[1:03:59] understand it why would this be and why
[1:04:02] would that be when the word itself
[1:04:04] testifies that this is exactly what is
[1:04:07] supposed to be done in this day and how
[1:04:11] he goes we went through it over and over
[1:04:13] but it's the truth but he was to them in
[1:04:16] their Camp a fanatic a a breaker of
[1:04:20] their Traditions now they're worshiping
[1:04:22] God they're they're calling on God Amen
[1:04:26] they're singing about him they're saying
[1:04:28] we're expecting Messiah to come and
[1:04:31] there he was a fanatic to them he was a
[1:04:35] breaker of their traditions an upsetter
[1:04:38] of their churches really just a fortune
[1:04:41] teller a spiritualist called beelzeba
[1:04:43] that's what he was and he says I believe
[1:04:46] that if you come among us today he would
[1:04:48] be the same thing to us for we have
[1:04:51] tradition we have denomination we can't
[1:04:53] get along with one another why there's
[1:04:56] only one place that man can get along
[1:04:58] and that's under the shed blood and the
[1:05:01] blood was shed as a germ of life to
[1:05:04] germatize this seed the word and outside
[1:05:07] of that our denominational barriers will
[1:05:10] always keep people away but he would be
[1:05:12] a stranger today he would be called the
[1:05:15] same thing he would be acted he would be
[1:05:18] put out of the camp and did you know the
[1:05:21] same Bible that said he would be
[1:05:23] rejected of men a man of sorrow
[1:05:25] acquainted with grief and they rejected
[1:05:27] and we did did esteem him smitten and
[1:05:31] Afflicted of God the very scripture that
[1:05:34] told that the very Prophet that sang my
[1:05:36] God my God why is Thou forsaken me my
[1:05:39] bones they all stare at me they pierced
[1:05:41] my hands and my feet when they were
[1:05:43] singing that in the church their
[1:05:45] sacrifice the god that they thought they
[1:05:48] were serving they were crucifying and so
[1:05:52] is it today the very God so we find that
[1:05:57] no matter what age you're in uh you have
[1:06:00] to make room for him
[1:06:02] you have to make room I understand you
[1:06:06] know people singing their songs and
[1:06:08] talking about Messiah today and and and
[1:06:11] these things and you know as if we're
[1:06:14] making room for him uh uh that some
[1:06:17] we're doing something different than
[1:06:19] they uh did back in that day but but you
[1:06:23] you have to make room for him no matter
[1:06:25] what age you're in it's easy to make
[1:06:28] room for him as a baby in a Manger amen
[1:06:31] because that's all history you don't
[1:06:33] really have to deal with the stink and
[1:06:35] the and the nonsense of of of the the
[1:06:39] animals all around and and and the mule
[1:06:42] the donkeys and the cows making all
[1:06:45] their noise and and and the and the poop
[1:06:47] and and all these things that are all in
[1:06:49] there in the and the smell we don't have
[1:06:52] to deal with that so we can celebrate
[1:06:54] something a man of the history amen but
[1:06:57] you have to make room for him today
[1:07:00] can you say man you have to make room
[1:07:02] for him and I really think if the
[1:07:05] Innkeeper really knew that this was
[1:07:07] Messiah that was about to be born he
[1:07:10] would have made room trust me he would
[1:07:12] have made room you understand what I'm
[1:07:14] saying amen uh uh if we can make if
[1:07:17] people can make room for Hollywood
[1:07:18] actors and they can make room for
[1:07:20] president politicians Governors and
[1:07:23] kings and all of that and roll out the
[1:07:25] red carpet trust me I believe if he
[1:07:28] really knew a man who was about to be
[1:07:31] born amen he would have rolled out some
[1:07:33] red carpet he would have asked somebody
[1:07:35] he would I would say he would have given
[1:07:37] up his own room and said hey you can
[1:07:39] have my room you understand what I'm
[1:07:41] saying I think if the world would do it
[1:07:43] today they would recognize if they
[1:07:45] recognized him they'd make room I
[1:07:47] believe if Simon amen really knew who
[1:07:51] the who he was he would have made sure
[1:07:54] that he was welcome I think he would
[1:07:57] have honestly told that foot wash flunky
[1:08:00] amen and you go get lunch I'll stand
[1:08:02] there I'll wash his feet if he really
[1:08:04] knew that this was the Messiah that he
[1:08:07] had invited but he didn't know can you
[1:08:09] say Amen so he made excuses why he
[1:08:12] couldn't do it and the foot was flunk
[1:08:15] he's somewhere he made sure that the
[1:08:16] foot was flunk he wasn't there either so
[1:08:18] he could walk past I don't know how it
[1:08:20] would happen but all I know is Jesus
[1:08:23] came in in there unrecognized with dirty
[1:08:26] feet can you say man they thought he was
[1:08:29] a devil they thought he was a liar they
[1:08:31] thought he was just some impersonator
[1:08:33] they thought he was messing everything
[1:08:35] up and they didn't realize this was the
[1:08:38] Messiah that they've been longing for
[1:08:42] ain't that right
[1:08:43] the Bible even says if the people would
[1:08:46] have known
[1:08:47] who he was they would not have crucified
[1:08:49] the Lord of Glory
[1:08:50] if they had known
[1:08:52] they would have crucified Barabbas give
[1:08:54] us Barabbas we want Barabbas not him let
[1:08:58] him go
[1:09:00] but they didn't know
[1:09:02] so they chose to set Barabbas free right
[1:09:05] so he was despised he was rejected
[1:09:08] a man of sorrow
[1:09:11] the Christian world today wants us to
[1:09:13] believe that the birth of Christ was a
[1:09:15] splendid thing
[1:09:18] do the believer that understands the
[1:09:21] birth and what it represents and what it
[1:09:23] was it is a splendid thing but
[1:09:27] to our understanding of the birth
[1:09:29] it's not a splendid thing to them
[1:09:32] their idea of Splendor is totally
[1:09:35] different they want us to believe that
[1:09:37] it was glamorous
[1:09:38] but yet there was nothing glamorous
[1:09:40] about the birth of Christ
[1:09:42] ain't that right
[1:09:45] if if they just took the birth of Christ
[1:09:48] just the way it was
[1:09:51] they wouldn't want it
[1:09:53] but they have to dress it up
[1:09:55] to make it appealing
[1:09:57] through the world
[1:09:59] ain't that right
[1:10:01] they have to dress it up
[1:10:04] so now because they've made it such an
[1:10:07] appeal
[1:10:08] to the world that now we see sinners
[1:10:12] atheists
[1:10:14] people that are ungodly
[1:10:16] celebrating
[1:10:18] Christmas
[1:10:22] people that would not want
[1:10:25] to have anything to do with him
[1:10:28] celebrating Christmas
[1:10:31] ain't that right and and what's sad is
[1:10:33] they celebrate it any way they want to
[1:10:35] brother brem talks about it how they
[1:10:37] give whiskey
[1:10:38] for presence something that is so
[1:10:41] degrading to God
[1:10:43] they give you know uh uh all kinds of
[1:10:47] evil uh ungodly things as presence and
[1:10:52] they they toast you know give a toast
[1:10:54] with wine and and and these things and
[1:10:58] so their actions and the gifts that they
[1:11:01] give justify
[1:11:04] that they really don't know what
[1:11:05] Christmas is about
[1:11:08] they really wouldn't want Christmas
[1:11:12] see he is despised
[1:11:14] and rejected of men
[1:11:17] it's it's it's it's it's not just that
[1:11:20] generation
[1:11:21] it's every generation
[1:11:24] that's the traits that follow him
[1:11:26] that's the things that go with him
[1:11:29] is despised
[1:11:31] rejected
[1:11:32] a man of sorrow
[1:11:34] acquainted with grief
[1:11:36] we try to beautify Christianity as
[1:11:39] though it's some great glorious thing
[1:11:42] that everybody should want
[1:11:44] but it's not
[1:11:46] it's not glamorous
[1:11:47] it's not glorious
[1:11:50] it's not something that the world wants
[1:11:53] we're trying to make it for the
[1:11:55] homosexuals we're trying to make it for
[1:11:56] the transgenders we're trying to make it
[1:11:58] for the drunks we're trying to make it
[1:12:00] for everybody we're trying to make
[1:12:01] church for everybody so everybody feels
[1:12:04] comfortable
[1:12:07] right
[1:12:09] preachers want to be popular
[1:12:11] people want to be popular we don't want
[1:12:13] to make people mad
[1:12:17] but just the fact he was born
[1:12:22] there was nothing appealing to it
[1:12:26] he could have been born in a palace if
[1:12:28] he wanted to but it was God's way
[1:12:32] it was God's choosing
[1:12:35] ain't that right
[1:12:37] yes sir brother Branham I've read this
[1:12:41] before but brother Brown and speaking of
[1:12:42] Jesus said of all the human emotions he
[1:12:46] manifested the most when he appeared as
[1:12:48] the son of man was this one he wept
[1:12:50] often
[1:12:52] a man
[1:12:53] God
[1:12:56] think of that now God that wanted to
[1:12:59] become one of us
[1:13:02] one of the greatest emotions that he had
[1:13:04] is he wept
[1:13:06] often
[1:13:08] wept because he was rejected
[1:13:12] wept because of the people's unbelief
[1:13:16] wept it was it was a weeping from the
[1:13:20] people's actions
[1:13:22] can you say Amen
[1:13:24] he was acquainted with grief
[1:13:27] John 1 11 says he came unto his own and
[1:13:31] his own received him not
[1:13:34] and and we know and and you know these
[1:13:37] things and so I've just just shared my
[1:13:39] heart I trust that's all right
[1:13:42] but the way he came to Earth was too
[1:13:45] unusual for the people
[1:13:48] they they they should have being a
[1:13:51] people of God being a people acquainted
[1:13:54] with with the supernatural but they
[1:13:57] hadn't seen the supernatural in so long
[1:14:01] they hadn't had a prophet in 400 years
[1:14:05] and and the churches had done away with
[1:14:07] the supernatural
[1:14:09] the priest had come to the place that
[1:14:11] they were taking the Bible and it was
[1:14:13] all a history book
[1:14:14] history lesson we know what the prophet
[1:14:17] said about it oh they talked about God
[1:14:19] doing the Red Sea but now chill
[1:14:24] he doesn't do that today
[1:14:26] you understand what I'm saying so how
[1:14:28] how can you do away with the how could
[1:14:30] they do away with the Supernatural and
[1:14:31] make Isaiah's prophecy the whole diverge
[1:14:33] and shall conceive make that come alive
[1:14:35] to the people
[1:14:37] you you can't do it it's a supernatural
[1:14:40] thing
[1:14:41] ain't that right so the the supernatural
[1:14:44] had become too unusual to the people to
[1:14:48] where they could not receive it and all
[1:14:50] through life his ministry was too
[1:14:53] unusual his very life was too unusual
[1:14:56] his Doctrine was too unusual and the
[1:15:00] prophet said God always does the unusual
[1:15:03] for he is unusual ain't that right if
[1:15:07] you're going to see God you've got to
[1:15:09] see him in the unusual
[1:15:12] that's exactly right and that's the same
[1:15:14] way with Christmas today amen it's the
[1:15:17] unusual that you'll see that's That's
[1:15:19] What Christmas Means to us is God
[1:15:22] working in an unusual manner
[1:15:24] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:15:27] God laying in the manger that day was
[1:15:30] unusual God being a baby the king of
[1:15:33] Heaven creator of Heaven and Earth amen
[1:15:35] being a baby amen
[1:15:38] needing the diaper changed and goo goo
[1:15:40] gaga and learning how to walk and
[1:15:43] learning how to talk and that was too
[1:15:45] unusual for the people to receive
[1:15:49] God living in a human body
[1:15:52] was unusual to the people
[1:15:55] even the Believers
[1:15:58] had a hard time accepting it
[1:16:00] even the Believers
[1:16:02] remember Joseph
[1:16:05] when Mary told him
[1:16:07] Mary told him
[1:16:09] you know and and to think of it now if
[1:16:11] you go with what brother Brown told us
[1:16:13] of the account they'd just come from
[1:16:15] church
[1:16:17] and the priest talking about all this
[1:16:21] talking about these things of of what
[1:16:24] God used to do and says but God doesn't
[1:16:25] do these things anymore I hate to tell
[1:16:27] you
[1:16:29] but something wasn't right as Mary and
[1:16:31] Joseph begin to walk the path home
[1:16:33] it just wasn't right something wrong
[1:16:36] and they just begin to talk about what
[1:16:38] God's still does and what God still
[1:16:41] there's some to thank God there was a
[1:16:43] heart of faith
[1:16:45] and and and Mary they they they maybe
[1:16:49] she asked him I I if I can get it right
[1:16:51] of one of the accounts that brother
[1:16:53] Brown said that she asked him what does
[1:16:55] Isaiah mean Behold a virgin shall
[1:16:58] conceive
[1:16:59] what what does that
[1:17:03] does that saying I think God led her to
[1:17:06] scripture because it applied to her and
[1:17:09] I still believe that God is able to lead
[1:17:11] us to the scriptures for today
[1:17:13] can you say amen and he began as she
[1:17:16] began to meditate see he would work he
[1:17:18] would come to her through his word
[1:17:21] not through not through not through
[1:17:24] video games not through uh whatever you
[1:17:29] know uh uh uh novel books and love
[1:17:32] stories and all that he had focused her
[1:17:35] mind hurt upon the word of God
[1:17:39] ain't that right and as she was
[1:17:40] meditating the next day I think it was
[1:17:43] that morning the angel of God appeared
[1:17:45] to her ain't that right so then she goes
[1:17:48] and tells Joseph now remember the priest
[1:17:50] is telling them it ain't for today it's
[1:17:52] not for today you can't do it and then
[1:17:54] he goes she goes and tells them what
[1:17:57] happened here they are to be married
[1:17:59] ain't that right amen and and Joseph has
[1:18:03] a hard time believing what Mary has just
[1:18:06] told him I'm expecting a child
[1:18:12] and you can just imagine the the the
[1:18:14] reaction to Joseph
[1:18:17] what
[1:18:18] I trusted you
[1:18:23] we we've made a vow together you you
[1:18:26] said you love me I love you we wanted to
[1:18:29] live together
[1:18:32] and you're going to do this but but
[1:18:34] Joseph it's not the way you think it's
[1:18:36] it's not
[1:18:39] and maybe she began to tell him the
[1:18:41] story but he still couldn't believe it
[1:18:43] ain't that right the Bible says him
[1:18:46] being a just man not willing to make her
[1:18:48] a public example was minded to put her
[1:18:50] away privately now the prophet says he
[1:18:52] wanted a Believer but it was too unusual
[1:18:55] to believe
[1:18:56] he wanted a Believer a just man an
[1:19:00] honest man
[1:19:01] wanting to believe everything she's
[1:19:03] saying
[1:19:05] that it was too unusual
[1:19:07] can you say Amen
[1:19:09] but see the the Bible had already
[1:19:11] promised God promised that Messiah would
[1:19:13] come and he even told how it would come
[1:19:17] they were discussing the very scripture
[1:19:19] the older virgins shall conceive
[1:19:24] it's amazing how the prophet says we
[1:19:27] always want to thank God for what he
[1:19:28] done yesterday and what he's going to do
[1:19:30] but when he does it right before us we
[1:19:33] can't get it
[1:19:35] and that's the world but God made sure
[1:19:37] that the believer got it
[1:19:40] can you say Amen but I'm going to be
[1:19:42] honest with you as as the prophet says
[1:19:45] and we all know that's lived long enough
[1:19:46] truth is Stranger Than Fiction
[1:19:49] ain't that right truth is Stranger Than
[1:19:52] Fiction so in order to make it
[1:19:54] glamorously today they have to take
[1:19:57] Christ out of the picture and put Santa
[1:20:00] Claus in and it's easier for people to
[1:20:03] believe the story myth of Santa Claus
[1:20:06] than it is to accept the truth about
[1:20:09] Christ
[1:20:11] it's true
[1:20:13] it's easier for people to to grasp hold
[1:20:16] of the Easter Bunny
[1:20:18] at time of Easter than it is for them to
[1:20:21] believe in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:20:23] Christ can you say Amen but Easter Bunny
[1:20:26] doesn't make Christ reality Santa Claus
[1:20:29] doesn't make Christ a reality
[1:20:32] but Christ himself becomes a reality
[1:20:36] yes sir so it's easier for people to
[1:20:39] believe a fictional story it's easier
[1:20:42] for them you realize it's easier for
[1:20:44] people to believe a politician a lying
[1:20:47] politician
[1:20:49] than it is to believe the truth about
[1:20:51] Christ
[1:20:53] and you know it's true
[1:20:55] people flock to the voting machines
[1:20:59] even people in the message they'll flock
[1:21:01] to them voting machines as if some
[1:21:04] miracle is going to happen
[1:21:06] but when the prophet has even said
[1:21:09] there's no more hope for America there
[1:21:12] there's no more you can put Abraham
[1:21:14] Lincoln in every office every George
[1:21:16] Washington in every office or whatever
[1:21:18] it still ain't gonna help America that's
[1:21:21] the truth
[1:21:22] but we'll take a lying politician that
[1:21:25] is lying through his teeth just to get
[1:21:27] an office
[1:21:29] and we will believe everything he says
[1:21:33] though he hasn't proved it nothing
[1:21:37] but yet a bunch of Lies is believed more
[1:21:40] than the truth is
[1:21:42] can you say Amen
[1:21:44] but if you'll notice every part every
[1:21:46] stage of Jesus's life match scripture
[1:21:49] it fulfilled the scripture can you say
[1:21:51] Amen so so what I'm saying is there was
[1:21:55] nothing fictitious fictitious about him
[1:21:57] nothing ain't that right everything
[1:22:00] fictitious about Santa Claus everything
[1:22:02] fictitious about these politicians
[1:22:04] trying to fix our economy it ain't gonna
[1:22:07] work
[1:22:08] it's all fictitious lies and and all
[1:22:11] these things but when it comes to Christ
[1:22:13] there was nothing fictitious about him
[1:22:17] you can look at it whether it was his
[1:22:18] birth his life his ministry his death
[1:22:21] his resurrection his Ascension his
[1:22:24] return there's nothing fictitious about
[1:22:26] it it's all reality it's all real it's
[1:22:30] all true
[1:22:32] and yet it's only appealing to those
[1:22:35] who believe
[1:22:38] can you say Amen
[1:22:41] but it's the religious world
[1:22:44] that wants to make everything about him
[1:22:46] fictitious
[1:22:50] you realize they've made worship
[1:22:52] fictitious
[1:22:53] they've made the new birth fictitious
[1:22:56] they've made the supernatural fictitious
[1:23:01] they've made the death fictitious they
[1:23:03] made the resurrection fictitious they
[1:23:05] made the Rapture fictitious
[1:23:07] they've made baptism fictitious
[1:23:10] everything's got lies in it
[1:23:13] through traditions and Creeds and dogmas
[1:23:16] of man everything is is got lies they've
[1:23:19] got their own idea of how the Rapture is
[1:23:21] going to be and it's totally a lie
[1:23:23] compared to what a prophet said it is
[1:23:25] can you say man they've got their own
[1:23:27] ideas of what a baptism really is but
[1:23:29] it's a lie compared to what God's word
[1:23:31] says about it yeah you understand what
[1:23:34] I'm saying they've wanted a medal even
[1:23:36] in in in in in the resurrection of Jesus
[1:23:39] Christ and and what do they do they the
[1:23:41] world Embraces the Easter bunny as
[1:23:44] though it's some special thing but when
[1:23:46] it comes to Christ they'll Embrace new
[1:23:48] clothes a new hat they'll Embrace
[1:23:50] everything but the real thing and that's
[1:23:52] Christ rose from the dead
[1:23:57] because truth
[1:23:59] is Stranger Than Fiction
[1:24:09] but if you're going to see Christ in all
[1:24:10] of it
[1:24:12] you're going to see Christ in a Rapture
[1:24:13] you're going to see Christ in baptism if
[1:24:16] you're going to see Christ in the
[1:24:18] resurrection
[1:24:20] the new birth
[1:24:21] worship
[1:24:23] if you're going to see Christ in the
[1:24:24] death
[1:24:26] then you have to see what is truth about
[1:24:28] it
[1:24:30] can you say man
[1:24:32] I'm so glad the prophet gave us the
[1:24:34] truth about it
[1:24:36] he gave us the truth
[1:24:39] not standing behind the pulpit giving
[1:24:41] something fictitious
[1:24:43] to gain popularity
[1:24:46] but he gave us the truth and it's
[1:24:48] despised it's rejected
[1:24:51] can you say Amen
[1:24:53] and those that Embrace that truth is
[1:24:57] despise they're rejected that they
[1:24:59] become people of Sorrow
[1:25:03] and you say Amen
[1:25:04] because you're not embracing the lies
[1:25:06] you're embracing the truth
[1:25:09] and Jesus said that he was the truth so
[1:25:12] there is a truth to worship there is a
[1:25:14] truth to the New Birth there is the
[1:25:16] truth Amen to the supernatural there is
[1:25:19] a truth to all of these things and there
[1:25:22] is a truth to Christmas can you say amen
[1:25:25] and when a man sees the truth about it
[1:25:28] he will see Christ for what he is you
[1:25:31] don't have to shun from it you don't
[1:25:32] have to you don't have to treat it as
[1:25:34] some evil day there is a truth to it and
[1:25:38] Christ is the truth can you say Amen do
[1:25:41] you love him
[1:25:42] now the rest of the world see there was
[1:25:44] few that recognized who Christ really
[1:25:47] was whether it be at the manger or
[1:25:49] whether it be on the cross or whether it
[1:25:52] be in in the synagogues Healing The Sick
[1:25:55] very very few people recognized who he
[1:25:58] was and and the rest of the world just
[1:26:01] went on their own merry way and most of
[1:26:04] them most of the juicing were still
[1:26:06] looking for messiah and you know they're
[1:26:07] still looking for a messiah today
[1:26:09] they're still claiming it they're still
[1:26:11] they're still saying it we want messiah
[1:26:12] messiah we're looking for messiah can
[1:26:15] you say amen and not knowing that
[1:26:17] Messiah had come but now we will say
[1:26:19] give them the benefit of the doubt they
[1:26:21] were blinded for your sake can you say
[1:26:24] Amen they they were blinded for your
[1:26:26] sake now the world wants to do make make
[1:26:29] Christmas and all fictitious all
[1:26:31] fictitious do away with the birth do
[1:26:33] away with Christ do away with that which
[1:26:35] is is despised and rejected and unusual
[1:26:38] and let's do something that is
[1:26:40] fictitious so the world will embrace it
[1:26:42] can you say Amen that day of Grace look
[1:26:45] at that that day of Grace amen that's
[1:26:48] what the church world has done with it
[1:26:54] and the Jews were blinded
[1:26:58] the Bible says and it's it's coming a
[1:27:01] time that their eyes are going to be
[1:27:03] open
[1:27:04] and they'll realize they rejected him
[1:27:07] they rejected him right
[1:27:10] that's exactly right and that's why
[1:27:11] they're in their Homeland right now
[1:27:13] the the you know it's starting to happen
[1:27:16] it's it's start there's an Awakening
[1:27:17] going
[1:27:18] I you know I I just believe they're
[1:27:21] ready for it now there there was that
[1:27:23] Hue and so those even those who
[1:27:27] recognized him had to have God to show
[1:27:31] them
[1:27:32] right
[1:27:34] that's right
[1:27:36] Joseph was minded to put her away
[1:27:39] privately
[1:27:40] and yet the Bible says that as you slept
[1:27:44] an angel of the Lord appeared to him in
[1:27:48] a dream ain't that right and told him
[1:27:52] what was really going on Matthew 1 20.
[1:27:54] while he thought on these things behold
[1:27:57] the angel of the Lord appeared unto him
[1:28:00] in a dream saying Joseph thou son of
[1:28:02] David fear not to take unto thee Mary
[1:28:05] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[1:28:08] her is of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:12] can you say man now we know he appeared
[1:28:14] in a dream because there was no prophet
[1:28:16] in the land
[1:28:17] ain't that right and it did not need
[1:28:19] interpretation the dream did not need an
[1:28:22] interpretation it was spelled out
[1:28:25] plainly that when Joseph woke up he knew
[1:28:28] what had happened he wasn't seeking uh
[1:28:32] uh some uh uh uh whatever to to
[1:28:36] interpret the dream he he knew exactly
[1:28:39] what it was that's exactly right see and
[1:28:43] so uh uh we find even the Shepherds we
[1:28:46] read about the Shepherds being at the
[1:28:48] birth of Christ but how would they have
[1:28:50] known that the Messiah was born amen
[1:28:53] there was no band Amen to welcome him
[1:28:56] there was no choir to welcome him there
[1:28:58] was no preacher to welcome him there was
[1:29:00] nothing how did them Shepherds that was
[1:29:03] out there they stunk like their sheep
[1:29:05] and and and they were considered maybe
[1:29:08] out I don't know but but they had been
[1:29:10] just out in the Sheep away from the city
[1:29:12] for so long and the angels of God
[1:29:16] appeared to them to tell them about the
[1:29:18] birth of Christ
[1:29:20] can you say amen and not every not every
[1:29:23] Shepherd understood the birth not
[1:29:25] everyone because they there was many
[1:29:27] Shepherds still out in the field but the
[1:29:29] angel appeared to that elected Shepherds
[1:29:32] amen and told them about the birth and
[1:29:34] they dropped everything and ran to to
[1:29:36] see him
[1:29:38] ain't that right
[1:29:39] ran to see him see so we we find amen
[1:29:43] Luke uh 2 13 says suddenly just break it
[1:29:46] in suddenly there was the angel a
[1:29:49] multitude of the Heavenly holes praising
[1:29:51] God and saying glory to God in the
[1:29:54] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[1:29:56] toward men and it came to pass as the
[1:29:59] Angels were gone away from them into
[1:30:02] heaven the Shepherds said to one another
[1:30:04] let us now go unto Bethlehem and see
[1:30:07] this thing which has come to pass which
[1:30:10] the Lord everybody say the Lord hath
[1:30:13] made known unto us and the Bible says
[1:30:16] they glorified and praised God for all
[1:30:19] the things they had seen and heard as it
[1:30:23] was told them so there had to be
[1:30:26] something to tell them about the birth
[1:30:29] of Christ look at the wise men Amelia or
[1:30:33] I don't know how many me or wise men but
[1:30:36] there was a lot of wise men out there
[1:30:38] studying the Stars church amen but these
[1:30:41] men were looking for the Messiah they
[1:30:43] were true in their heart amen looking
[1:30:46] and God showed them amen there was a
[1:30:50] supernatural sign a supernatural star
[1:30:53] that showed up can you say amen and and
[1:30:56] for some reason no one else could see
[1:30:58] him none of the other astrologers and
[1:31:00] wise men could look at the star as they
[1:31:02] were studying the Stars they couldn't
[1:31:03] see it but God was telling these wise
[1:31:06] men the Messiah is on Earth
[1:31:10] can you say amen and they were Guided by
[1:31:14] that star and they said we've seen a
[1:31:17] star and we've come to worship Him
[1:31:20] but it had it took the supernatural it
[1:31:23] took the supernatural to lead them to
[1:31:25] Christ ain't that right is this okay
[1:31:28] amen see it it took it it it it because
[1:31:32] it would have been considered a strange
[1:31:34] birth an unusual birth and they couldn't
[1:31:36] put it together in the scriptures but
[1:31:38] when the supernatural amen came to them
[1:31:40] they were able to have put it to the
[1:31:42] scripture can you say amen and realize
[1:31:44] this is not just another baby amen this
[1:31:47] isn't just another poor woman amen that
[1:31:49] was put out in the cold and and no room
[1:31:52] maybe there was other babies that were
[1:31:54] being born at the same time I don't know
[1:31:56] amen but the supernatural would tell
[1:31:59] them that the Messiah is on the earth it
[1:32:01] took them two years to follow the star
[1:32:03] but the supernatural never left them
[1:32:06] the supernatural never left them it made
[1:32:10] sure they come to the Christ
[1:32:16] I know these people around
[1:32:18] religious folks claiming to have the
[1:32:20] supernatural with them and ain't sure
[1:32:22] leading them to Christ
[1:32:26] you look at Simeon
[1:32:28] and the prophet is Hannah
[1:32:31] Simeon was given a promise that he would
[1:32:33] see the child that he wouldn't die until
[1:32:35] he saw him
[1:32:38] but you know what when the
[1:32:40] little baby was there
[1:32:42] with all the other babies
[1:32:44] Simeon wouldn't have known it
[1:32:49] but the prophet said he was led
[1:32:53] by the spirit of God
[1:32:57] and he had taken all these other babies
[1:32:58] and blessed them
[1:33:01] but when he come to that baby
[1:33:03] something just told him
[1:33:06] this is Messiah
[1:33:09] this is what you belong for this is the
[1:33:11] promise that I gave you
[1:33:14] and Simmons Simeon begin to bless the
[1:33:16] Lord
[1:33:17] mine eyes have seen his salvation
[1:33:20] can you say Amen
[1:33:23] and then Anna the prophet has come
[1:33:26] and begin to Bear witness that this was
[1:33:28] the Messiah how did they know
[1:33:30] it was a supernatural thing
[1:33:33] that happened in their hearts to let
[1:33:35] them know this is the messiah
[1:33:39] rejected child a despised
[1:33:43] a man that child that would grow up
[1:33:45] being rejected by men
[1:33:48] criticize ridiculed
[1:33:52] but God made sure that that believer
[1:33:53] wouldn't ridiculate
[1:33:58] God made sure that the believer would
[1:34:00] recognize him in honor him
[1:34:02] who he is
[1:34:05] Peter
[1:34:07] Peter wouldn't have known him
[1:34:09] who he was
[1:34:10] and except it had been revealed
[1:34:13] Jesus would tell him who do men say that
[1:34:15] I am and of course they begin to tell
[1:34:17] them
[1:34:18] oh Jesus
[1:34:20] some say you're Elias
[1:34:22] some say you're one of the prophets some
[1:34:24] say this some say that
[1:34:27] and everyone missing the Mark about him
[1:34:31] and he'd ask him but who do you say and
[1:34:33] Peter with all boldness
[1:34:36] and I want to have that boldness today
[1:34:39] stand up and say the heart to Christ
[1:34:42] the son of the Living God
[1:34:45] here's a man that couldn't even write
[1:34:46] his name couldn't read and yet he would
[1:34:50] declare the Messiah it was here
[1:34:53] standing in front of him present day
[1:34:55] word
[1:34:56] ain't that right
[1:34:58] and Jesus let him know
[1:35:01] Jesus let him know it wasn't it wasn't
[1:35:03] you Peter that knew this
[1:35:06] it wasn't you
[1:35:08] these men are saying missing the mark of
[1:35:11] who I am because they don't know
[1:35:14] but to you it's been revealed
[1:35:16] thank you
[1:35:17] it's been revealed of my father
[1:35:20] but then he says Upon This Rock I'll
[1:35:22] build my church and of course
[1:35:23] everybody's gone wild with that
[1:35:26] Catholics say was so poem Peter
[1:35:29] others say what was Upon Jesus
[1:35:31] But Here Come a prophet to say oh no
[1:35:33] it's neither one
[1:35:34] it's the revelation of who he is
[1:35:38] God would make sure that he would build
[1:35:40] his church so that church wouldn't
[1:35:41] despise him when he would come
[1:35:44] that he wouldn't just be a cast off like
[1:35:47] so many have cast him off
[1:35:50] but when he would come and start working
[1:35:52] the unusual there would be a people to
[1:35:54] recognize him and say this is scripture
[1:35:56] being fulfilled before our eyes can you
[1:35:59] say amen I love him
[1:36:03] so we see that it was all a supernatural
[1:36:07] revelation
[1:36:10] as a baby he was recognized
[1:36:13] as a child he was recognized as a man he
[1:36:17] was recognized
[1:36:19] there wasn't a set time
[1:36:21] there wasn't a set age that people had
[1:36:23] to wait before they could recognize him
[1:36:26] just as it is today there's no time
[1:36:29] there's no set age there's no amount of
[1:36:32] years
[1:36:33] uh that people must wait before they can
[1:36:36] recognize Christ in a man woman boy or
[1:36:39] girl
[1:36:40] Christ wants to be recognized and if
[1:36:42] anyone will recognize him it'll be the
[1:36:44] believer
[1:36:45] can you say Amen we don't have to wait
[1:36:48] say well they they got to grow up they
[1:36:50] you know give them time to grow up oh no
[1:36:52] once Christ is born in a man's heart
[1:36:54] you'll know it's there yes there is a
[1:36:57] growing up but he had to grow up too he
[1:37:00] had to grow up from that manger to be a
[1:37:02] man but every stage of his life there
[1:37:04] was someone to Bear record that it was
[1:37:06] him it was him in the manger someone was
[1:37:09] there to say this is him he's Messiah
[1:37:11] ain't that right they didn't have to
[1:37:13] wait till he was a full-grown man they
[1:37:15] didn't have to wait till he was on the
[1:37:17] cross they didn't have to wait till he
[1:37:18] rose again there was somebody with the
[1:37:20] Revelation to say that's Christ and that
[1:37:23] that's Christ in that manger I'd say
[1:37:25] there's a revelation today that when you
[1:37:27] get around the believer you get around a
[1:37:29] a a a a a one that Christ has been born
[1:37:32] in you can look and say that's Christ in
[1:37:34] that man might be simple it might be
[1:37:37] just a young babe in Christ but that's
[1:37:39] Christ
[1:37:41] something Bear's record of him
[1:37:45] ain't that right
[1:37:48] John 14 18. I hope this all right
[1:37:53] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:37:55] come to you
[1:37:57] all you think of that
[1:37:59] God knew the manger he was going to come
[1:38:01] to
[1:38:03] when he had Jesus in mind and he
[1:38:05] predestinated that baby
[1:38:08] he knew the manger he was going to come
[1:38:10] to
[1:38:11] he knew that little stable he was going
[1:38:14] to come to he knew the place
[1:38:16] now he looked and says but I'm going to
[1:38:18] come to you
[1:38:19] oh my I will not leave you comfortless
[1:38:22] in yet a little while in the world seeth
[1:38:24] me no more but you see me because I live
[1:38:27] you shall live also
[1:38:29] oh he couldn't Quicken that little
[1:38:31] manger there was nothing in that manger
[1:38:33] to Quicken there was nothing in that
[1:38:35] little stable to Quicken but oh he says
[1:38:38] when I come to you though you'll live
[1:38:40] you'll live because I live you shall
[1:38:43] live also and at that day you shall know
[1:38:46] that I'm in my father and you and me and
[1:38:49] I in you can you say man as he prepared
[1:38:53] that manger it was no accident that the
[1:38:56] man would kick him out and say there's
[1:38:58] no room for you amen because God didn't
[1:39:01] predestinate that little hotel or
[1:39:03] whatever it was for him to be born in
[1:39:06] God had a Manger God had a little cradle
[1:39:10] God had it all I had it all prepared
[1:39:13] before the foundation of the world and
[1:39:15] God coming to you is no mistake either
[1:39:17] he had you prepared before the
[1:39:20] foundation of the world and say when I
[1:39:23] return I know what heart I will come
[1:39:25] into I know when I'll be born I know the
[1:39:28] place I will be born and the Heart can
[1:39:31] you say man Paul says the glory of this
[1:39:34] mystery and it is a mystery that it is a
[1:39:37] mystery amen too unusual but it's Christ
[1:39:40] in you the hope of glory ain't that
[1:39:43] right so if Christ is truly dwelling in
[1:39:46] an individual he will be recognized
[1:39:49] whether it's in its infant stage or
[1:39:51] whether it's in it it's uh adolescent
[1:39:54] stage or the matured stage the
[1:39:57] supernatural will be manifested to make
[1:40:00] him known are you with me amen it'll
[1:40:05] make him known that's right and that
[1:40:07] manifestation of the supernatural will
[1:40:10] point to the word being fulfilled
[1:40:12] ain't that right it'll be unusual to the
[1:40:15] world because they have their own ideas
[1:40:18] their own teachings and doctrines of the
[1:40:21] scripture I look at it today and we know
[1:40:23] it we know it but I'll tell you young
[1:40:25] people Revelations 10 1 is unusual
[1:40:28] can you say man talking about is coming
[1:40:31] amen Revelations 10 1 is unusual Luke 17
[1:40:36] 30 is unusual first Thessalonians 4 16
[1:40:40] is unusual Daniel 2 34 is unusual
[1:40:45] talking about the stone coming to strike
[1:40:47] down that Gentile image it's unusual
[1:40:51] Revelations 8 is unusual amen all of
[1:40:55] these scriptures are unusual but it's
[1:40:57] still saying it's still the truth can
[1:41:00] you say Amen but it's unusual because
[1:41:02] they've grabbed a hold of fictitious
[1:41:05] doctrines and fictitious teachings and
[1:41:08] Creeds and things like that and yet the
[1:41:10] truth is there but you'll never see
[1:41:13] Christ in any of their fictitious ways
[1:41:15] in any of their fictitious sermons and
[1:41:18] any fictitious worship that they may
[1:41:20] have you'll never see Christ you'll see
[1:41:22] Christ in the word in the truth can you
[1:41:25] say amen that's exactly right see and so
[1:41:28] these scriptures plus many many more
[1:41:30] speak of the promise of the same Christ
[1:41:33] coming to the Earth amen there were
[1:41:36] scriptures of the Messiah coming to the
[1:41:39] Earth 2 000 years ago and the church
[1:41:42] World rejected it and they're still
[1:41:45] saying we're looking for him we're
[1:41:46] looking for him you know what they're
[1:41:48] saying the same thing today
[1:41:53] and then you say man they're saying the
[1:41:55] same thing today and yet they're missing
[1:41:57] the coming they're missing it all
[1:41:59] together
[1:42:00] because they've got their own fictitious
[1:42:02] ideas of how he's going to come when
[1:42:04] he's going to come where he's going to
[1:42:06] come and yet the Bible says he would
[1:42:08] come as a secret as a thief in the night
[1:42:11] hello church he coming as a thief in the
[1:42:14] night that's exactly right and the
[1:42:15] world's going to miss him
[1:42:17] ain't that right it's already said it
[1:42:25] but I'm so glad it's been revealed
[1:42:28] is coming
[1:42:31] his birth
[1:42:34] amen
[1:42:36] and I still say to you he still despised
[1:42:40] he's still rejected of men
[1:42:44] he's not looked upon
[1:42:46] as the pearl of great price
[1:42:50] that it's still scripture being
[1:42:51] fulfilled
[1:42:53] regardless of what they say
[1:42:56] how many people walk past that stable
[1:42:58] that day
[1:43:00] not knowing that scripture was being
[1:43:01] fulfilled inside there
[1:43:04] how many people might have heard the
[1:43:05] whale of a baby
[1:43:07] and not knowing it was scripture or God
[1:43:09] became one of us
[1:43:13] can you say Amen
[1:43:15] it's so true
[1:43:17] now Jesus promised that he would be in
[1:43:19] US
[1:43:20] till the end of the world
[1:43:23] I'm going to close
[1:43:25] but as it took a birth for him to come
[1:43:27] to the Earth two thousand years ago
[1:43:30] it still takes a birth for him to come
[1:43:32] in the manger of our heart
[1:43:36] ain't that right
[1:43:38] and Christmas is about the birth of
[1:43:40] Christ
[1:43:42] so this is why Christmas is somewhat
[1:43:44] personal thing for the believer
[1:43:47] this is why we don't need Santa Claus
[1:43:51] we don't need their fictitious story
[1:43:54] whereas what the prophet said put Christ
[1:43:56] back in Christmas
[1:43:59] oh my aren't you glad for that
[1:44:02] you see Christmas means nothing if he
[1:44:04] hasn't been born in you
[1:44:07] that's right I don't mean to say this
[1:44:10] ain't a special time with friends and
[1:44:12] family and
[1:44:14] eating the turkey and the giving of
[1:44:16] gifts brother Brown gave gifts brother
[1:44:20] Brown said Merry Christmas
[1:44:23] brother Branham had a tree
[1:44:25] argue with it
[1:44:29] it's either your ideas or what he did
[1:44:31] you you can say all you want to well he
[1:44:34] wanted to get rid of it because you know
[1:44:36] they use that one quote well they got
[1:44:38] the couple that they they misuse
[1:44:41] but they you know they they say well you
[1:44:44] know
[1:44:45] Brad Brown said we need to quit but
[1:44:46] we're swapping these gifts and the
[1:44:48] tinsel and this and that and we'll have
[1:44:50] more of the supernatural so you know
[1:44:52] this quote of it you know what I'd like
[1:44:55] to ask them
[1:44:57] here's a man that was in 63 right 63.
[1:45:01] he had already spoke squirrels into
[1:45:03] existence
[1:45:04] he had already stopped the storm
[1:45:07] he had already raised the Dead
[1:45:09] I'd like to ask you
[1:45:11] where's your phenomenal
[1:45:14] amen
[1:45:16] if that's what's going to stop it
[1:45:18] swapping gifts and the Christmas tree
[1:45:20] and all of that
[1:45:22] okay
[1:45:23] you're not doing it where's your
[1:45:25] Supernatural
[1:45:28] have you raised the dead lately
[1:45:32] hello
[1:45:33] have you spoken the third pool yet
[1:45:36] have you spoke squirrels into existence
[1:45:39] so maybe there's some different meaning
[1:45:41] that brother Branham had than what
[1:45:43] you're putting on to it
[1:45:47] hello
[1:45:49] he continued on
[1:45:51] and I'll I'll just you know I've said I
[1:45:53] ain't gonna let no devil stop and stop
[1:45:55] me I I don't care whether you have one
[1:45:58] or not but don't make make it sin
[1:46:01] to have these things
[1:46:03] don't make it brother Brown told us it
[1:46:05] was Pagan he told us that before he told
[1:46:07] us he had one
[1:46:12] he told us all about Christmas how Pagan
[1:46:15] it was and the way the world does it one
[1:46:17] thing he did stay true with and told us
[1:46:19] about is don't talk about Santa Claus
[1:46:21] don't tell your children about Santa
[1:46:23] Claus it's a lie
[1:46:26] so what he's saying
[1:46:28] ain't that right
[1:46:30] so so what I'm saying is people putting
[1:46:32] this pressure as if you're a sinner if
[1:46:35] you're if you're doing these I don't
[1:46:36] care if you do it or not
[1:46:39] but don't have Santa Claus don't teach
[1:46:40] children about Santa Claus that's lying
[1:46:43] that's just flat line
[1:46:44] ain't that right
[1:46:47] so that's that's your personal beliefs
[1:46:49] or personal thing
[1:46:51] but I'm just telling you if you're going
[1:46:52] to use that quote and saying well our
[1:46:54] Christmas tree swapping gifts and all
[1:46:56] that singing you know Merry Christmas
[1:46:58] saying Merry Christmas and singing
[1:47:00] Christmas songs is stopping the
[1:47:01] phenomenal the phenomenal state with
[1:47:03] brother Branham all the time
[1:47:06] hello
[1:47:08] and if he was still here the phenomenal
[1:47:10] would still be with him the supernatural
[1:47:12] he's the one that stayed in the presence
[1:47:13] of God I don't know about y'all I
[1:47:15] haven't had an angel appear to me and
[1:47:18] talk to me about things that the angel
[1:47:19] of God did Brother Branham
[1:47:23] so to say that we've outgrown brother
[1:47:25] Brandon brother Brandon just wasn't
[1:47:26] mature and weave out
[1:47:31] I don't know I'm just you know didn't
[1:47:33] mean to get off there but anyways it was
[1:47:35] there
[1:47:37] but I'm going to tell you that Christmas
[1:47:39] means more than gifts
[1:47:41] and a real believer understands that
[1:47:44] Christmas means more than gifts
[1:47:46] Christmas means more than lights
[1:47:48] Christmas means more than Merry
[1:47:50] Christmas
[1:47:52] means more than than Christmas songs
[1:47:56] Christmas means more than all the the
[1:47:58] the tree and and all that and and I'm
[1:48:01] going to be honest with you I don't
[1:48:03] believe that God and I'm not saying it's
[1:48:05] wrong I'm just saying I don't believe
[1:48:08] that God uh uh intended for us to honor
[1:48:12] Christmas by way of recreating the
[1:48:14] nativity scene that I'm not saying that
[1:48:18] that's wrong if you want to have a
[1:48:20] nativity scene God bless you for that
[1:48:22] and and and there's nothing wrong with
[1:48:24] that but if you're stopping there and
[1:48:26] that's all Christmas is to you is is
[1:48:28] recreating a nativity scene something's
[1:48:31] wrong that's all I'm saying you will
[1:48:33] never find the real reason for Christmas
[1:48:35] until Christ is born in you
[1:48:38] he was born in that day for you to be
[1:48:40] redeemed can you say man he was born in
[1:48:43] a manger so he could be born in your
[1:48:45] heart
[1:48:46] that's what he wanted he wanted to live
[1:48:48] in men ain't that right he wanted to
[1:48:50] live in boys and girls he he that was
[1:48:53] his desire that he couldn't do it until
[1:48:55] the first Christmas came that he could
[1:48:58] be born in the body he created in now he
[1:49:01] comes and is born in a redeemed body
[1:49:06] ain't that right so it's the birth of
[1:49:09] Christ that's what Christmas is is about
[1:49:11] the birth of Christ but the birth must
[1:49:15] not be just left a historical
[1:49:19] what is it Historical Society we we
[1:49:22] we're not here to make a museum about it
[1:49:26] just as much as we're not here to make a
[1:49:28] museum about a prophet
[1:49:30] what good does the message do you when
[1:49:31] you're just putting it all on a prophet
[1:49:35] can you say Amen so there have to be a
[1:49:38] supernatural birth in order for messiah
[1:49:41] to be on earth ain't that right the
[1:49:44] birth was a supernatural birth and it
[1:49:47] still takes a supernatural birth for
[1:49:49] messiah to be on Earth today
[1:49:52] ain't that right it's a creation what
[1:49:55] was it what was that birth all about a
[1:49:57] creation of the word of God
[1:50:00] It produced Christ
[1:50:02] and if it's going to produce if Christ
[1:50:04] is going to be produced in you it's got
[1:50:06] to be the creative word again
[1:50:09] that's right the same Supernatural power
[1:50:12] that created Christ in the womb of Mary
[1:50:14] is the same Supernatural power that's
[1:50:17] creating Christ in your heart
[1:50:22] ain't that right and without that you
[1:50:25] ain't had a Christmas
[1:50:28] and that birth think of it that birth
[1:50:32] today will be just as unusual
[1:50:35] as that birth back
[1:50:40] ain't that right
[1:50:42] but though it may be unusual
[1:50:45] it'll be scriptural
[1:50:47] you believe it
[1:50:49] you love him
[1:50:51] okay I've kept you I've got a lot more
[1:50:53] to go I didn't really I thought 45
[1:50:55] minutes I'd stay sorry but love you
[1:50:58] appreciate you
[1:51:04] and I do pray you have a wonderful day
[1:51:06] today
[1:51:09] but remember
[1:51:11] don't treat Christmas like the world
[1:51:13] does
[1:51:15] puts it all historical but when God is
[1:51:18] trying to do something today we don't
[1:51:20] want it
[1:51:23] and we despise it we reject it
[1:51:27] but I believe here this morning you've
[1:51:30] come
[1:51:31] because Christmas means more than just
[1:51:34] the birth of 2000 years ago
[1:51:38] I believe you've had that birth in your
[1:51:40] heart
[1:51:42] and you know what it's about
[1:51:45] and you just come to honor him
[1:51:48] to glorify him do you love him if the
[1:51:50] musicians will come
[1:51:59] you know everything that God does will
[1:52:03] be criticized ridiculed
[1:52:06] and spoke against because of the
[1:52:08] unusualness of it
[1:52:13] Christ's testimony
[1:52:16] was unusual people wouldn't believe it
[1:52:23] his life was unusual people wouldn't
[1:52:26] believe it
[1:52:31] but
[1:52:32] the only one that would salt was those
[1:52:34] that were ordained
[1:52:37] they really believed it
[1:52:40] and that's the same thing today
[1:52:43] to speak of a risen Christ
[1:52:45] how unusual that would be
[1:52:49] so let's shift to a rabbit laying eggs
[1:52:55] [Music]
[1:52:57] and that's more believable
[1:52:59] than to say he's risen today can you say
[1:53:03] man
[1:53:05] and today most of the world celebrates
[1:53:07] Christmas and Easter
[1:53:09] but not for the same reason that the
[1:53:12] Shepherds
[1:53:13] celebrated the birth
[1:53:16] it had been revealed to the Shepherds as
[1:53:19] to who that baby was
[1:53:22] so when they came to that baby
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:26] they knew they were seeing present day
[1:53:28] word fulfilled
[1:53:31] that was the Christ child
[1:53:33] ain't that right
[1:53:35] and again the world
[1:53:38] they're celebrating the birth or
[1:53:40] Christmas but it's something fictitious
[1:53:45] it's either about Santa Claus
[1:53:48] they've taken the prophet says that
[1:53:50] they've taken Christ out and replaced
[1:53:52] him with Santa Claus
[1:53:54] or they're worshiping something
[1:53:55] historical
[1:53:57] ain't that right
[1:53:59] today millions of people come to worship
[1:54:01] the Christ child but not as the wise men
[1:54:03] did
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:06] ain't that right
[1:54:09] because you see
[1:54:12] if they would worship as the wise men
[1:54:14] they would have to follow the star
[1:54:18] that led them to Christ
[1:54:21] in the first place
[1:54:23] is that right
[1:54:25] and when they came to the that child of
[1:54:29] two years old or so
[1:54:31] they presented the exact right gifts
[1:54:36] to him
[1:54:39] testified they knew exactly who he was
[1:54:43] ain't that Ryan
[1:54:44] you love the Lord
[1:54:47] you know those
[1:54:50] that recognize him stop looking for him
[1:54:54] when the wise men came to him they
[1:54:57] stopped looking
[1:54:58] Joseph and Mary they stopped saying
[1:55:00] we're looking for messiah we're looking
[1:55:02] for messiah
[1:55:03] it's we found him the Shepherds
[1:55:06] they kept they quit looking
[1:55:09] they found him
[1:55:11] and the rest of the world still looking
[1:55:14] and it's the same way today looking for
[1:55:16] messiah
[1:55:17] brother Bram talks about it so much
[1:55:19] they're looking for a messiah
[1:55:22] to bring peace on the earth they're
[1:55:23] looking for a messiah
[1:55:26] and yet God has brought him in this age
[1:55:29] which is the word made flesh word
[1:55:32] manifest it ain't that right
[1:55:34] Bram said we've already got it God gave
[1:55:36] it to us it's his promise for this hour
[1:55:39] we look in the Bible we see it
[1:55:41] everywhere Through the Bible anointed
[1:55:43] ones come on and may that word live
[1:55:45] again right in the hour for that hour
[1:55:47] and we've got the Messiah this is him
[1:55:50] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:55:52] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:55:55] and the word remains God Hebrews 13 8
[1:55:58] the same yesterday today and forever we
[1:56:01] know everybody say we know we know what
[1:56:05] is supposed to take place in this day
[1:56:06] we're wanting Messiah God gave us the
[1:56:10] Messiah his promised word for this day
[1:56:12] it's just waiting for somebody with
[1:56:15] faith to anoint it and make it live
[1:56:17] again it's a real Messiah it's the word
[1:56:21] of God Amen so he says today we're not
[1:56:25] worshiping a baby in a Manger not Santa
[1:56:27] Claus but we're worshiping almighty God
[1:56:30] in the deity of his son and we know what
[1:56:33] the prophet say deity is not in heaven
[1:56:37] it's in you deity is in you aren't you
[1:56:41] glad for it
[1:56:43] oh my if it hadn't been for that first
[1:56:45] Christmas where would we be we'd be left
[1:56:47] without an experience with God
[1:56:50] we'd be left void but thank God for him
[1:56:54] hallelujah oh I love you
[1:56:58] oh come let us
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:03] adore him
