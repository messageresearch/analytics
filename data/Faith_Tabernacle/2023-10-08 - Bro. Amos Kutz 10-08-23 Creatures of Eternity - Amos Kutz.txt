back then pleed the blood of Jesus begged him to forgive my sin but I still can't forget it it just won't go away so I wept again Lord wash my sin this is all he [Music] say what s what sin that's as far away as the East is from the [Music] West what sin what sin it was gone the very minute you confess buried in the sea of [Music] forgetfulness the heaviest thing you'll ever carry is a load of guil and shame you were never meant to bear it so let them go in Jesus name our God is slow to anger quick to forgive our sins so let him put them under the blood don't bring them up again cuz he'll just say once sin what sin that is far away as the East is from the West what what s it was gone the very minute you buried in the sea of forgetfulness oh Lord deliver me from my accusing M for nothing makes me weep this way then when I hear you [Music] say what sin what sin that's is far away as the East is from the West what s what sin it was gone the very B you confess buried in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus praise our God praise our Lord oh thank you Lord Jesus aren't you so glad for that amen buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness Watson Watson takes me back to the takes me back to the Samaritan woman she never she wasn't even thinking it affected her so much when the word seed came alive in her heart and she heard the voice of the master there at the well it didn't even phase her she'd had a huge past life she'd come to that well up in the day because of the shame the stigma the uh you know the you know the the the situation as it was nobody wanted to be around her but when the slight struck that seed none of that mared her anymore none of that that mattered and a woman didn't even have the Holy Ghost wow now if that would happen to someone who didn't have the Holy Ghost what about you as a holy ghost this morning what sin neither do I condemn thee Hallelujah you stand free nothing nothing held over you nothing's held over your head men might hold something over your head but if God doesn't hold anything over your head what difference does it make thank you musicians amen let's turn in the word of God this morning and so good to have each and everyone and glad brother Daniel is all right and uh these things happen we're not immune to these things and uh this morning he's feeling sore and so some people feel that way all the time well I'm certainly not I'm not gloring gloring pain or anything like that but I certainly know is the older that we all get our bodies begin to feel wear and tear and I'm not here to preach uh anything that's negative this morning but you know uh many times we need to put ourselves in other people's shoes then once we do that we'll know how to pray for them amen some times God will let a pain strike me that'll remind me that so and so is putting up with that every single day and don't get much relief from it so I certainly I think that's where the body of Christ is sympathetic not that we're looking for sympathies or anything like that but we are understanding of one another and uh that's why the Bible even says about uh bear ye one another's burdens that don't mean well I ain't going to Bear her burden or I ain't going to bear his burden but the Bible said bear you one another's burden so it just makes it easier for that other person to bear that burden amen and uh enter into the fellowship of their sufferings you see that's it's easy to stand back from a distance and say well God bless you brother I hope you get the feeling better and all of that that's that anybody can say that but to enter into the fellowship of your sufferings because Christ is touched with the feelings of our infirmities so we should therefore act the same way if not then we we just need to get more love in our heart amen praise God so this morning I want to go straight to our text this morning before we do that let's ask the Lord to uh bless the word Heavenly Father God as we are opening your word this morning and Lord before us lays a a topic of Lord a a tremendous topic Lord and there's not enough hours in the day father to really speak about all of these things father God this morning but I pray dear Lord that you would enable us and Empower us Lord God and give us Lord uh any disturbance Lord exterior Lord or somebody gets uh this thought or that thought help us Lord God to stay with our thought Lord God Lord God may you open our our mouth to speak the words of Life dear God to bring Deliverance to bring healing to bring joy to bring freedom for the captive Lord father God that's what we want Lord is that lifting up dear God in our soul lord God we know that that's the the problem once that problem is solved it's kind of like the micro many many many many problems the micro but if we can ever get the micro taken care of the big problem it just takes care of all the little micro problems God help us this morning to approach it Lord God and see ourselves in your grace I pray bless this word oh God give us strength in our body we pray and give us a heart to understand and listen to your voice and follow your leading I pray this morning in Jesus Christ's name be with our pastor and his family Lord God as they'll be traveling here in a few days we ask it in Christ's name amen tur in your Bibles with me to the book of Hebrews chapter 9 beginning at Hebrews chapter 9 and starting at verse 8 Hebrews 9 beginning at verse 8-4 and we'll even read Hebrews chapter 10 and 2 praise the Lord you love the Lord this morning amen he says this Paul says this in verse 8 the Holy Ghost is signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which were both offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience neither by the blood of goats and caves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and in the ices of an hepher sprinkle the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Hebrews 10 and2 says this Hebrews 10 and2 for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins I'll read that one more time for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins I want you to turn over toook Book of Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chapter 10 we all know this scripture this chapter very well probably some of us got it even memorized and that's good we should always be familiar with the scriptures Revelation chapter 10 and I I'll just start at the uh well we'll start at verse one and I saw saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein and the earth and the things that are therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer in verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets I'll just stop reading right there and I'll remind you how he says over there I believe it's in one of the final chapters of Revelation he says this phrase it is done Glory praise God Amen you can be seated this morning now this morning I'd like to speak to you on a subject of creatures of Eternity creatures of Eternity I want to say on what Sister Lisa I ask her to sing that song this morning what sin God has literally obliterated annihilated your pass inallah that blood we we have complet ly it's been destroyed there's no trace of it for every single Holy Ghost Phil believer here this morning that's received the new birth there is absolutely nothing against you now you in this flesh now we're talking about your soul where you stand with God and we know I think brother Terry and I were talking about this lately and it really released something in my heart after church one time we were talking about it he mentioned how that we receive the literal there's not two forms of righteousness there's not two standards of Holiness there's not two standards of of the word and so forth one for God one for you but we receive the righteousness of God and you're as pure as God is pure I don't don't care if you're living in a Time body now what I want to just back up here a little bit because this struck me when I was up in Baltimore and I was kind of speaking on this thought and Lord just it just struck me in such a powerful way and I realized that there's many things that you've got to do as a Believer first of all you just can't lay around the prophet said if you lay around you're going to become soft and Doty you're going to become rotten and yes you can get spiritually cold that doesn't mean you're lost that don't mean your status is changed in the mind of God your status Remains the Same but you got chastisement coming to you you're going to get your hi burned you're going to get rebuked and there's one thing about it when a Son of God Rec recognizes the rebuke the chasing of the Lord he doesn't bucket like a goat he's a sheep and he accepts the correction cuz he knows it's good for him that's why you can walk out these stor think thank God for a whipping absolutely because it's to bring you and I closer to God and sometimes chastisement doesn't feel good but it's good for us it shows that God l us and we're not bastard born children spiritually Hallelujah I'm thankful for that now the worshipper once purged has no more consciousness of sins all right now let's really look at that thought really close brother random talks about I'm trying to recall the name of the sermon I can't recall if somebody knows it you can speak it out but brother randam talks about a woman who was a Sunday school teacher she was a supposed to be either Methodist or something like that and she had a pastor who didn't really care for her soul he didn't preach the gospel he didn't preach repentance he didn't preach a holy life so this woman went along in life and think she was doing pretty good she was doing a god of service by teach in Sunday school and we find out that her life begin to wither away and she went on and on and got involved in adultery she left her first husband went went with some other man the first thing you know she's out here living like a and so she's going on and on thinking she's all right and brother Rand said her soul her conscience went away from her but then when she begin to die of a venial disease that she'd left go tooo long I don't know what the you know what the situation was but she apparently ignored it and it got to the point where it was lifethreatening and they couldn't do anything for her and and we find out that she brother bam said that when she begin to the blood begin to stop flowing her heart started slowing down he said her soul caught up with her and her conscience of sin returned and she went out of this world with a conscience of sin because she was not under the blood she didn't even believe on the blood she wasn't even saved that's the conscience and no doubt everything she'd ever did her sins of unbelief all came before her at that time and she cried I I'm lost she pointed her finger at that Pastor said you deceive her he failed to point her to the blood that could take it away could took away that conscience of sin she could have walked in newness of life but her conscience returned and so at the day of judgment Sinners ungodly Christ rejectors they'll stand there with their consciousness of sins with no covering in the presence of a holy God if not for the grace of God there would you and I be also but because of God's plan and Redemption no person needs to even go to that place place no person needs to die with a conscience of sin and go into that other dimension nobody because their blood atonement is across the board sure it is even people out there who's not elect or predestinated can be saved for God so loved the world whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life when we know that there's names on that book that'll stay on the book we I know we don't mention that very often but I'm glad there's going to be millions of people whose names will remain on the book but some like Judas the rejectors will have their name taken off the page of the book of life but now the Lamb's Book your life if your name was in that book it'll never come off of there but there's grace and mercy for all and I don't know the mind of God but God forew all things amen but there's some people that was way back there with him in eternity Before Time began and a church age book says that we are one of those Eternal thoughts of God and if you're an eternal thought of God now I can't explain God even the children young folks here I'm my mind my finite mind can't comprehend God in eternity without an end it's a circle brother R said without Corners it just goes on and on and on and on and on own Brother Sam God bless you I thought you were going to be in Colorado but you're here anyway God bless you I appreciate you but it goes on and on and on now notice we're talking about that conscience the woman her conscience come back to her much like people do today they're they're they're dying every minute there's some people how sad it is but God knew from the very beginning who would and who wouldn't some people he could actually put their name on The Book of Life and he knew they would reject it and he'd have to take their name off the book but he also knows that there's people who's got their he put their name on The Book of Life but their name won't come off he knows that he absolutely knows it now I'm not going to spend all my time speaking on that this morning but there's one thing about the stimulation I'm so thankful for the gospel there is only one gospel now people out there have a portion portion portion portion portion Portion by their own ignorance and even by rejection they got a bunch of loose ends that they can't tie it together now I've read read many of these scriptures when I was back there without understanding I I I believed him but I didn't even know what eternal life was I just thought it was well you got eternal life you just God gives it to you and there you go you're God eternal life but that's really not the case I eternally existed by the by the bringing forth and opening of the word I eternally existed in the thoughts of God he say how do you know that God asked me to believe it and something in my heart says I believe it and that's the way it is with you I can't preach you in it I can't preach a revelation into you that Revelation comes down says that's me I can register with that and I believe it and then you see the fruit the fruit of that belief begin to manifest in your life now that all past is done away he says I will be merciful to their unrighteousness their sins and iniquities Hebrews 8:2 I will remember no more he doesn't put him up on a shelf or back in a little stories room just in case I need to pull it back down just in case I got a I got Angels W watch him really close God isn't like that I don't care if God sent us examples like Jacob who was a sh before you could say before he was really shall we say converted you know not having the Holy Ghost but coming to a recognization when he wrestled With God all night long then he had an experience then the old Jacob died sure was not a holy ghost filling but his life changed at that point now when that happened Jacob's a changed person and from that point on and he had a limp so God put a seal a stamp on him and it's forever he walked around and he had a mark on him so are you you're marked by the Lord he he's got his seal his seal of divine approval on your life this is my son this is my daughter and I'm not ashamed of them he doesn't save you to lose you one day you were always saved really Prophet says you just recognized it amen and you got to have that recognized today okay let me read some of these things I have up here brother R says about your conversion in conflict between God and Satan he says I can't explain to you how that the greatest miracle I can think of and I'm just breaking his thoughts here what he's H he's saying it the greatest miracle I can think of is a man just like a pig tell that pig you're no more a pig you're a lamb he becomes a lamb am that' be hard to believe why is it the same thing takes place when you become converted to a sinner to a Christian see it changes your opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you it brings you into another life so in other words your old book is done away with but it's bringing you to another another life you were in a fake life you were in a death walk you were in a you thought you were alive yes you were alive and you were in a Twilight Zone so to speak but you weren't in the opening of the word you were not into full light in the evening time it shall be light you hadn't yet come to your evening time experience you hadn't yet come to your evening light experience amen he said it changes everything that's in you it brings you into another life it gives you another spirit that bears for forth another record Oh Glory woo this is in conflict between God and Satan he says I'll read that again this is good I didn't actually see that before but he said that' be hard to believe wait a minute see it changes your own opinions it changes your own will it changes everything that's in you and it brings you into another life amen so in other words you're not a stalemated you know the evil spirit C C out and you remain garnished but you're filled with God he says and another spirit gives you another spirit that bears forth another record then your old life has to die new one has to be born again your no more the creature you was at all that's when you become behind the blood fortified with the word amen he says in souls in prisoned and he says that's why we're baptized into his name that we might come forth in his name and his death and his resurrection that we Rise Again testifying to the world that we have new life that the old man is Dead We buried that first nature see that first Nature's gone and now we are the nature of him that's he lives in us we don't do our own will we do his will we don't think her own thoughts the mind is what think he says the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer praise the Lord there is the soul that's what we're speaking of Amen rising of the sun he says this no more the boty life that Liv back there at the beginning without the son to bring it to life no more than today when sons of God is upon the Earth it take the s o n light to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world and on Easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and In Heaven There was a book of memory oh Hallelujah and his attributes was in him knowing that because the son of God raised it would also raise to life every son that was for ordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious Sunrise than that was than it was at the beginning Hallelujah and again in another quote here in his presence that's the name of the sermon in his presence if we are confess that he is we've been in his presence and we have confessed your sins they are blotted out the book of his memory there's nobody but God could do that now you could do anything to me and I'll forgive you but I'll remember it if I do anything to you you'd forgive me but you'll remember it but God can forgive and forget it think of that don't even remember it that makes me feel good Hallelujah when it's not even remembered anymore nothing can do it but God nothing but God can do that he's said he would blot out of his book of memory I can't do it you can't do it because we've only got these little finite senses remember that you can't do it I can't do it because we've got these finite senses but he's an infinite God he can absolutely forget that it was ever done and he says amen amen and show us the father brother Ram says this listen to me I'm going to say something every time that you look at your symptoms you're delay your healing don't dig it up again it's committed to him that promised to heal him that heals the rest of them when you pass through the prayer line hands is laid on you the Bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick don't say well I see I don't feel any better my heart any better my hands don't do that you're delaying it commit it to the ground because it is a seed amen yeah

moving with him and he put in enough a bomb of Gilead he put in enough of joy not enough he didn't just put in enough he put a lot in there that's why he could say my yoke is easy and my burden is light it's not a drudgery it's not a if it is then you got the wrong kind of Burden he said my burden is life Peter when it came time to die as a Marty he didn't want to run and hide when that time come and he knew his time was up he said don't let me be crucified by my Lord crucify me upside down I'm not worthy to die that kind of day and he gladly laid on that cross knowing there was pain coming into that body knowing that he was going to suffer and whatever was going to happen to him but it was only temporary he had eternal life on the inside of us in his soul his soul have been changed praise God he had the riches of the wealth of God that no matter what they did to him the sea of forgetfulness you were accused of by the accusement really from the beginning the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there wash let me tell you something that is reality by the way though you be in a Time body and we are still living out the end of the Le the see and church age though you be in this right now you have eternal life that's true you can never die shall never come into the Judgment Jesus said you pass from Death un life it don't matter how many times brother Bob gets has to go to the hospital and go have something cut off his face that don't change one thing in his soul amen now Lord if he can deal with it like so many the rest of them brother Walker sitting here he used to sit here so many of them suffered in their body with hives and suffered with uh I know what they call that Devil's disease that he had that tormented him for weeks you know what I'm talking about them sores you know blisters it doesn't matter Holy Ghost was inside you but really you predestinated your old book divorcement has been put away and it's dead it absolutely out of existence in the mind of God it can't be found are you trying to make yourself bigger to God bigger than God with your fin mind and say oh but I wish I wish you can't go back brother and sister and undo the past but there is a blood that can wash you and expand your record and send down the seal that he's proud to write his name across your life the book of Acts it's Sam Jones performed by the Holy Ghost God is proud to be associated with you you this morning he can Write Your Name Across you cuz you're a son and daughter of God he's proud of his work he's proud of his children the determinant counsil of God I declared it and it shall be it is done it is done God says he puts a seal on your sister my brother it is done no devil in hell can take that seal off amen virtuous bread of Christ washed the blood of Christ brother Ram says in what why he tells his story and this is where I want to kind of Leap Frog over into the new record the new book now the lamb the book has been opened the seals have been loosed brother randam says in this story we told us the last time when we spoke that that you know he was having this Holy Ghost meeting goes down the street it's a Sunday morning or something little Christian place is closed so he has to go to a bar you know the conditions going on in the bar what was going on and he starts he's a Son of God he starts to see the filth and the iniquity of sin around him he's seen people waiting for hours to get into a meal eating and here's a couple of men at a table with a woman that ain't dressed right and they're all drunk and carrying on there's one interest in mine and that's that woman Lord you know he's starting to think you know what happened he said I think I have to raise my family up and something like this why don't you just the Lord pulled him aside said I'm the God that was down there Healing The Sick delivering the oppressed having Sinners come to me people being filled with the Holy Ghost and now you're standing here condemning this woman boy God knows how to get our attention brother Ram says he like entered into I know was like a vision the Lord pulled him behind the door and he said he like the blood was around the earth we know the story and every time she sinned no every time William brandham sinned his sins went up and would have went right into the presence of God and the righteousness and Holiness and the fire of God would have consumed him but the blood of Jesus Christ and he said he's seeing the Lord and every time he would sin if feel a Lord oh oh but his love and he said did my sins do that to you lord said the Lord Jesus nodded and he said he had in his hand a little book but it wasn't the book of life it was a book of life it was the book of William brandham like you and I have had but what did we say about that old book just hang on now that book's open let me tell you something every single person has an open book is called their life the record the Bible says that the great white Throne judgment Not only was a book of life open the Lamb's Book but there was the books the books the temporary books temporary books yeah every single person that walked the face of the Earth starting back at Cain that did not repent will have an open book and the books were opened there was nowh someone were not even found in the book of life but don't be judged oh God think of that think of that the terror the horror not so much the fear of that one but the fear of your filthy life your filthy Soul coming to the presence of a holy God that's why people sometimes won't come through these doors they sense the presence of God they get so uncomfortable well I pray for them I pray that they'll feel uncomfortable enough to do something about it get under conviction but he said he had an open book and his name was wrote on it oh he started calling out to the Lord and he said he nodded his head to me said God forgive me I wouldn't want to hurt you like that Lord I love you with all my heart he took his side patted with his hand took his finger like this and rote on my old dirty book you think you had such a maybe a cleaner book than somebody else let me just let me just give you a rude awakening this morning we were all born in sin and shaper in iniquities all have sin and come short of the glory of God he wrote on my old dirty book in his own blood pardoned hlu what did he do with it he chucked it once he wrote pardon over it it didn't matter where that thing landed didn't matter what happened to it pardoned he pardoned and he completely annihilated the record of it he didn't put it somewhere where he could find it you don't have to a foolish virgin she still got something to deal with but the bride has nothing it's already taken care of for and he says then he to throwed it over behind him like this and into that sea of forgetfulness and laid out a new book oh that's where we're just getting started now he laid out a new book and when the lamb had opened the book they sung a new song you're new creatures in Christ Jesus singing a new song and especially now you're really singing a new song you notice the song that these people when the lamb had opened whatever song they maybe had been singing now when the lamb opened the book they're singing a new song when John wrote this and painn it in there and God was sure to make it it was a new book the new book of Acts of the Holy Ghost and brother will the Lord sister Melissa a new book of thoughts and plans that God had before the world ever began that he could look way down Through the Ages and the Winds of time the change of the seasons when your mom and daddy grandma grandpa great great great great great great great great and he seen you coming down and he started ordaining this one and that one no doubt some strange things happened they didn't know why but it was God protecting you and your parents could have suffered from the Bubonic plague that wiped out entire fam that there's no living seed of that family anymore but God protected those certain ones down to the wars and so forth as that God was protecting the seed you look at what's happening in Israel right now what is it it's a devil trying to destroy that seed the devil is trying to thr the plan of God by attacking and killing them people taking captives it made me also think how David I don't remember the full story I don't remember the name of it but David came back and he found out they done carried off their wives and [Music] children Devil's in for a root Awakening on this one yes sir yes sir it's a wakeup call he might have caught just like the rest of us sometimes the devil will catch us off guard but we've got to we've got to catch up we've got to catch up and there's one thing about it the devil's not going to win anything on it he might have pulled a fast one but God knew already knew it was going to happen is prepared for it and has prepared his children for it you don't realize what really lays within you you have the ability to recoup regroup re-energized restricted that's right David what did he do I heard remember he encouraged himself with the Lord amen a new book they sung a new song brother br says and God keeps his word Phoenix and listen to what he says here that around this altar Lord healing in a greater measure in a more higher measure in the highest plane what is he plane a plane is like a higher level on the ladder it's going up in the mountains and you reach a a new level a higher level from Roll Oak to Christian B Christianburg is like a higher level he says then around this altar Lord healing in a greater measure in a more higher measure in the highest plane that there is an eternal healing eternal spirit making Eternal creatures out of creatures of Time how wonderful these men and women raise their hands they were grateful that you did offer them eternal life but they've come here to make a public confession that they believe you and are repenting of their sins let me just stop and say something right here those of you who know this message this was 1957 and in 19 I think it was either 1953 or the early 50s brother R preached on the deity of Jesus Christ now I I have not I've not done a thorough or a complete uh research on a different Ministries that existed back then but I'm going to tell you what I just read to you was not being preached by too many people if anybody at all that was a higher level of preaching that was a different kind of preaching when he preached the deity of Jesus Christ and he said de lives in you now brother R probably didn't even realize some of those things he was talking about because later on he as he matures in his ministry matures in the opening of the word he makes it more clear but God was speaking out of him amen you're Eternal creatures out of creatures of Time how wonderful I've got to got to move on with this he says in the uniting time and sign the thing I've been teaching you is telling you these signs different things are happening I haven't got time to do it now I will in another message Lord willing but there's one little thing yet lacking in the church we want to get to that and I'm right on the edge of it now we want to get to that you got to do it if you don't do it that's just all you must do it for looky the uniting time is at hand God is getting the church together to be a Rapture to go to the wedding for the great Union when God and man will unite for eternity when creatures of time Unite with the Eternal okay I am looking for another quote up here okay serpent seed brother Ram says I want to ask you who is this job 27 where was you when I laid the foundation of the Earth when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shout of foror shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that was shouting for Joy Jesus told them I had Joy with you before the foundation of the world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity 19 588 you didn't hear that kind of preaching back then mean there was some good God called Ministry back then but they weren't getting into that cuz only the prophet God Reveals His secrets to a prophet to break these things loose amen my creatures of Eternity yes sir thank you Jesus brother R says and lifting him out of history as long as we live in the Glorious setting of mortal son mortal son he says remember the Mortal son and the breaking of the eternal life I do feel that we're living in some of the grandest ages that every man has been permitted to live in because it's the closing out of time the closing out of time it's time for those memories to stop don't dig him up again don't dig up that old husband leave it be yes yes sir see ending a time in this SES that every man has been permitted to live in because it's a closing out of time blending in of Eternity and how can I overcome he says this this Le to see in church age is the grandest of all ages because it's the ending of time the blending of Eternity it's the greatest sinful age yeah we know that there's more there's more sin in this age than it's ever been in the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against that it was in any age but God has a determination and his power his light cannot be darkened his life will not be stuffed out he has a bride in the midst of this filthy wretched godforsaken age who's been indicted denomination's been indicted amen it's a blending of Eternity when God has chosen this very age I believe it's in Ephesians chapter 1 it talks about the fullness of God the fullness of times excuse me we'll go to that right quick Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 10 that in the dispensation the fullness of times he might got GA together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him when is that happening if happening right now it is absolutely happening right now time shall be no longer you finite mind can't comprehend that but you see when you realize yeah you live in a Time body but you're able to separ separate yourself now you see that the real you is not this house that everybody looks at right but the real you is standing up inside you the real you is a butterfly that's forming on the inside that soul is maturing in the word of God now the fullness of time has come and what does he say that he might gather together in one all things in Christ for which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him he's absolutely accomplishing his will right now and every single elect Pride member will go out of this world not defeated but absolutely Victorious over every personal demon people talk about their demons we've had them and we still fight them but they're going to be they'll be the devil will find that demon will say I don't know what to do anymore Satan Commander I don't know what to do with him but then had to bring some sort of governmental Force against them Bible B brother R said the B bride won't be shut up she'll be taken up Hallelujah you can't cage this Eagle in once this Eagle's been turned loose this Eagle ain't going to be caged back up she W destined for a cage she's destined for the skies amen amen planing of Eternity and it leads us to our final quote I'm I'm out of time but this is probably where we'll start the next time in Reading in reading through this this struck me I know some of you here like to really like this really like these quotes here in the future home and I'll just uh bring this will be my last quote brother Ram says in the future home message he's talking about the convocation the holy Gathering the holy assemblage of the people The Eighth Day where are we now where are you to now I could see by the authority of the word we're already in that e day we are already there oh hallelujah praise God I know there's actually going to be any day a new heavens and a new Earth but you've already got it done on the inside of you thank you Jesus he said remember this is a Feast of Tabernacles Gathering to gathering places amen for in the Millennium the Bible said they shall build houses they shall inhabit but in the new Earth he's already went and prepared the place it's built we have have nothing to do with the building of it amen he says Eternal oh I just love that word my a holy convocation the eighth day which is only seven days then on the eighth day which comes back to the first day again right back to the first day the eighth day is a holy convocation amen he says see you enter into life not keeping a day of Shadow Paul said over there in Hebrews the fourth chapter keep days Shadows things like that I'm scared of your experience see we don't pass into certain days and orders you pass from Death onto eternal life not days and times you pass into eternity that's the holy convocation conversation convocation rather he says that's the holy convocation right Hallelujah and he says over here also after the seven sabbaths or seven days seven Church ages Jesus raised from the dead 8th day which is a holy cocation which is the first day see you've done passed through time and dropped into eternity again this ain't something to happen in the future it has already happened this is what Paul talked about in Ephesians 2 1 and 10 it's happening today the Lord the little book was opened time is no more time for who the bride it's eternity time it's eternity if you want to call call it that eternity time that's the best way I can say it you done got out of that Circle or that little little hickey and you done moved over into the Alpha and the Omega with no beginning and no end you was in meis you was in the prophet of God some of you were not even born but you were there with the prophet of God when he preached the the lamb opened the seals you were there you were there in 1955 you were there in the day of John Wesley you were there were in the day of Paul and Peter you were there you were part of the economy of God you were in God's TR before the world began the Lord that's the holy convocation now you're made manifest now you've come to the manifesting time now you've come to the Day of Reckoning the day of recognization of who you really are who we really are let come what me let come what me on this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it you can't Prevail against God we're not operating just under an anointing we're operating under the literal life of God you can no more be defeated that God could be defeated and don't let your slip UPS you have an advocate don't let those little slip UPS fault you don't let them be like little ticks that suck your blood out of you mosquitoes and so forth trying to give you lime disease don't let those things give you that youve you been inoculated by the blood if you either shut the door or open it my womb is only open to the word of God it's closed to everything else knowing our spirits of veneral as the prophet said back then brother Terry people didn't preach those kinds of things that won't even mention from the pulpit brother R preached The Book of Proverbs he preached The Book of Solomon in figurative and a type and I know he did preach on the S Song of Solomon and so forth but he brought it out in such a way that people just even even I believe that even theologians what did he say those things weren't even mentioned from the pope and yet they're in the scripture why was it he had a holy he was in a holy convocation and he could break that word without being an offense to people Lord even though it shocked people spiritual to neural oh my goodness I expect you to get quiet on that one I guess the opening of the word amen you see a prophet tells it like it is said California is going into the sea repent Los Angeles I wonder how many of them actually did repent I trust that some did I hope they did repent Los Angeles and he spoke like it was already in the sea that's a prophet that may be un years back but it's still going to happen that's sayith the Lord a prophet has spoke he's talking about the Eighth Day I'm going to have to ask musicians to come notice after 50 days in the future home he says there seven sabbaths from there there come another holy convocation the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the seventh day or on the Eighth Day rather Eighth Day fell on the eighth day was seven sabbaths later exactly after his resurrection so it'll be seven times that again bring you right back around to the first day of the week again amen the bride age he says there's your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal thing it's beyond that think of it think of that he says it's literally beyond that the literal thing that's what he's saying right here it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life now you don't make let me tell you something some of you know me real good I love beautiful scenery because this sin cursed world there's still some beautiful things I know some of these mountains were created After the flood but God put a little bit of icing on the cake he made the mountains be snow covered beautiful turning Fall Foliage and so forth like that I like I like those kinds of things it's head he's in his Sunrise I see you in the morning morning I see you in the morning God's love letter painted in the sky he says it's the kingdom of God with eternal life with a predestinated that never did start never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because because you had eternal life to begin with and all God's people said amen some of you said it some of you is afraid to say it I wonder why I wonder why God give you opportunity to believe it say it say it I want you to say it again I believe it say it again say it again all right now it needs to get down there in the in the control room of your heart say it again all right now some of you got it down in the control room in your heart but it needs to get up to the to the steer guy at the steering say it again I believe it I believe all right send the message back up there I'm no more conscious of my sin let me tell you something when that word seed awoke in that Samaritan woman let me tell you something I look every one of you in the eye right now but I'm not going to do that I look if I can have some way to look at myself in the mirror right now I'd say you know there's people that I wronged there's people that I sinned against there's people that I done wrong that if I walked into the presence right now there would be a stigma there would be a memory that would pop up when I was with them and I did this and I did that and I did this and I done that there was a woman like that called a Samaritan woman but when that word see brother Terry woke woke up at that point and that's what brother brandom is trying to point us to that stimulation and Revelation that's what the word will do for you when you go into your secret closet and you have that meeting with God and he lifts you up in your spirit sometimes you don't even get no feeling with it but you get a Blessed Assurance but that woman was like a brother R said like a house on fire on a windy day she goes back in the city remember let say she's a woman preacher not really she was a woman testifier brother Terry she runs to that City who's the first person she meets one of her [Music] clients I think all just quitting going no no she was so energized that seed had awakened there was no Stigma she looked at that man she looked at all St no doubt were her clients what happened to the stigma it disappeared and I tell you once you get charged by the word of God the devil will have a hard time resurrecting pulling up that old memory God don't remember it it's just your ACC [Music] if it so energized her and charged her that it made say you and her class I need to go he that guy if it'll do that for [Music] her she had a stick that's why she showed up at the well in the middle of the day not the early morning remember Jesus had not yet gone to Calvary it woman was taken in the ACT to adultery there is God standing in human skin God Tabernacle in a fail of Flesh tell us here woman where are your accusers what voice what voice was greater than that voice what voice there is no other voice there is no other voice it was a voice of God and he turned to her she says I have none you can say I have none this morning she didn't even receive the blood sacrifice had not yet been made W she had the same Revelation that Abraham and all the rest of those Hebrews Warriors of faith she dropped her water poot I'd say till the day of Pentecost she probably lived a pretty good Sanctified life no it was not complete it was not complete she had to go into the eighth day but something had been resurrected on the inside of her already and he said to the other woman taking in the very act neither the one who gave the law the one who actually saw the law being implemented people were taken in adultery and stoned the very God who looked down was now standing there his mercy and Grace says neither do I condemn it go and sit no more that's before Calvary that's before the blood atonement can fully come into its total manifestation that's recorded word if that would do that for them what should it do with you who have the Holy Ghost stand stand with me holy convocation it's already there I I I know ministry here could do a far better job and I I just barely cracked the door open on that one where are you now you are the sons of God now you are the Tabernacle the whole tabernacling the holy righteousness of God Spirit would Jesus put his Spirit into an old vessel new wine put into new [Music] botles the wealth The Riches of Christ that's why Paul said forgetting those things which are behind and pressing towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling oh [Music] Hallelujah this far exceeds what did he say above and beyond what we could even ask or think that's where God's at are you there yet are you there yet that anything is possible to you why did Paul say that that he is capable above beyond what we could even ask or think do you have that kind of thinking that's God thinking brother random told us right at the very beginning what was the key have the faith of God yes you can have your own faith but you've got to have his Fai when you see his faith and you put that to practice nothing so stand before you nothing oh hallelujah oh what song could be sing here this morning brother shiah understand brother Steve Alvis is going to be ministering tonight he's
