[40:58] out and um anyway she had an episode
[41:03] last night and they had to rush her to
[41:05] the
[41:06] hospital and um the doctors don't know
[41:09] what to do at this point and um so
[41:13] they're asking for prayer and you know
[41:16] brother Wayne's been a real dear friend
[41:19] to
[41:19] me uh through the years and and uh been
[41:24] a real support to us uh here at the
[41:28] church and supported this church um for
[41:32] many years now and um um you know he's
[41:38] um uh just been a real blessing to many
[41:42] many people around the
[41:44] world um and he stood with this message
[41:48] for many years and and you know I just I
[41:53] I can understand the the you know the
[41:56] con concern that he would have of course
[41:59] brother Isaac you know that's his wife
[42:03] and um so really want to just take in in
[42:07] to Heart uh for this
[42:09] situation that uh I know the Lord can
[42:12] heal her raise her up uh or he can let
[42:17] the doctors know what is going on and uh
[42:20] you know if the Lord chooses that way to
[42:22] work through the doctors but whatever it
[42:25] is I know it's a concern for the family
[42:28] at this point brother Wayne is uh in
[42:31] Tennessee right now preaching a meeting
[42:33] and so I know his heart's you know I'm
[42:36] sure torn wanting to be home uh with his
[42:40] daughter uh there and uh she can't get

[42:47] and pass out and um so um it's it's a
[42:51] concern for them and so uh maybe we

[45:41] anoint him use him in a mighty way we
[45:44] ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[45:49] praise the Lord uh Revelations the 18th
[45:53] chapter and um going
[45:58] to start at the uh first
[46:01] verse and after these things I saw
[46:04] another Angel come down from heaven
[46:06] having great power and the Earth was
[46:09] lightened with his
[46:11] glory and he cried mightily with a
[46:14] strong voice saying Babylon the greatest
[46:16] Fallen is fallen and is become the
[46:18] habitation of devils and the hold of
[46:21] every foul spirit and a cage of every
[46:24] unclean and hateful bird for all nations
[46:27] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[46:30] her fornication and the kings of the
[46:32] Earth have committed fornication with
[46:34] her and the merchants of the Earth are
[46:37] waxed Rich through the abundance of her
[46:41] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[46:44] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[46:46] people not all people are going to come
[46:48] out but there is a voice for the elect
[46:51] come out of her my people that you be
[46:54] not partakers of her sins
[46:57] and that you receive not of her
[47:00] plagues amen you can have your seats
[47:03] this
[47:04] morning I want to maybe just continue on
[47:07] the thought coming out of
[47:10] Babylon and um I'm so glad that we've
[47:15] been able to come out amen and
[47:19] um uh that that's to me is is
[47:24] Grace and it's in this last day
[47:28] that we have heard the voice of God
[47:30] calling us out amen and through the
[47:33] message of the hour it's amazing how
[47:37] preaching of the Gospel has an effect
[47:39] Upon Our Lives but it does and we must
[47:42] never never underestimate the the power
[47:46] of preaching the gospel and for all of
[47:50] us ministers we must take it uh uh treat
[47:54] it with such importance that it's not
[47:57] just preaching a
[47:59] sermon but we're we're we're been called
[48:04] to have an effect upon the people and uh
[48:10] and you know it's why we must preach the
[48:12] message because the message is the key
[48:16] of calling us out amen it's the only way
[48:19] we can come out is by the message of the
[48:23] hour and so but because we have heard
[48:27] voice of God it it means that there is
[48:31] nothing nothing able to hold us and keep
[48:35] us any longer uh bound and and according
[48:40] to the scriptures Babylon captures it's
[48:43] a it's a predator um and it captures its
[48:48] prey and holds them and so it's it's not
[48:53] something that you can just join and
[48:56] then leave anytime you want you you you
[49:00] just can't come and go anytime you
[49:02] please this is not something to play
[49:06] with um uh uh you know it's it it it
[49:11] took it took the voice uh of God to
[49:15] bring a Deliverance so we would call it
[49:17] the voice of
[49:19] Deliverance uh it's it's just like the
[49:22] children of Israel in the Old Testament
[49:25] they could not just come and go go uh uh
[49:29] you know enter into Egypt and leave
[49:32] Egypt anytime they wanted uh because
[49:36] they were a people that was held captive
[49:39] by that nation and that's what that's
[49:42] why it took a promise of God to give
[49:45] them a a sure future that they would
[49:48] never they would not be slaves and and
[49:52] and and held captive in bondage in Egypt
[49:55] forever but but they they could not come
[49:59] out on their own this this it would take
[50:02] a voice of Deliverance a message of
[50:05] Deliverance to actually bring them out
[50:08] and so God would tell them that that
[50:10] they're going to be in captivity for
[50:12] this certain amount of time but I will
[50:15] come and I will deliver them and and so
[50:19] uh uh it took Moses that was the whole
[50:22] point of Moses's Ministry was to deliver
[50:25] them people came with a message of
[50:29] Deliverance and and uh um and by his
[50:33] message the supernatural took place by
[50:36] his message God defeated the Enemy by
[50:41] his message a token was given to the
[50:43] people provided for the people that they
[50:47] could escape this death angel that was
[50:50] getting ready to pass through the land
[50:52] but but the key to the supernatural was
[50:54] the message the key of of of of safety
[50:57] was the message everything that the
[51:00] people needed to be delivered was by the
[51:02] message that Moses brought to them if
[51:06] Moses had not come with the message the
[51:08] people would have never been delivered
[51:11] the people that would reject Moses's
[51:13] message would have stayed behind in
[51:16] captivity so God would deliver them by a
[51:19] prophet's message and that message would
[51:23] be a message of Deliverance he did not
[51:26] send than just a any Ministry it had to
[51:29] be a prophet's message that would come
[51:32] to the people to deliver them ain't that
[51:35] right so the Deliverance of the people
[51:37] God did not use a natural Army to
[51:40] deliver them uh uh uh he did not use a
[51:44] psychologist to deliver them he did not
[51:48] deliver them by some intellectual genius
[51:51] amen he delivered them by the power of
[51:54] God through the message of Moses amen
[51:58] the word of the Lord ain't that right
[52:01] and that message destroyed their enemy
[52:03] that because it was not a man's message
[52:06] it was the message of the Lord and and
[52:09] it it destroyed the enemy and and in
[52:12] Exodus
[52:14] 14:13 uh Moses said to the people fear
[52:17] not remember they they' come out of
[52:19] Egypt now they're getting ready to looks
[52:22] like they're going to be slaughtered by
[52:23] that same enemy that was chasing them
[52:26] him and and they're they're look like
[52:29] they're trapped the Red Seas before them
[52:31] but God intentionally LED them that way
[52:34] to show forth his power but notice the
[52:37] message of that hour the message of the
[52:39] hour told them fear not stand Ste and
[52:43] see the salvation of the Lord which he
[52:46] will show you uh to you today for the
[52:49] Egyptians whom you have seen today you
[52:52] shall see them again no more forever
[52:56] amen the Lord shall fight for you and
[52:58] you shall hold your peace so so as as
[53:02] Egypt was to the people of Israel a
[53:06] natural people so has Babylon been Amen
[53:10] to God's elect amen and and Babylon has
[53:13] actually been an enemy to God's people
[53:15] throughout time and and like like um
[53:19] Second Kings 20 and 16 and Isaiah said
[53:22] unto Hezekiah hear the word of the Lord
[53:25] behold the days come that all that is in
[53:28] thine house that which thy fathers have
[53:31] laid up in store unto this day shall be
[53:34] carried away into Babylon uh carried
[53:36] into Babylon nothing shall be left
[53:39] sayeth the Lord and of thy sons that
[53:42] shall issue from thee which Thou shalt
[53:44] beget shall they take away the
[53:47] Babylonians take away and they shall be
[53:49] Unix in the Palace of the king of
[53:52] Babylon then you you you could look in
[53:54] in um uh uh uh 2 Kings 24 and8 jein was
[54:00] 18 years old when he began to Reign he
[54:03] reigned in Jerusalem 3 months and his
[54:05] mother's name was uh NE neusa something
[54:10] like that and and and um the daughter of
[54:13] uh elthan uh from of Jerusalem something
[54:17] to that effect and he did that which was
[54:20] evil in the sight of the Lord according
[54:22] to all that his father had done at that
[54:25] time the Servants of nebuch Nezar king
[54:27] of Babylon come against Jerusalem and
[54:28] the city was SE besieged and
[54:31] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon come
[54:32] against the city and his servants did
[54:35] besiege it and and you could go on
[54:37] through that scriptures of how they uh
[54:40] uh captured that City and they took uh
[54:43] the king they took the the the
[54:45] inhabitants of Jerusalem uh uh into
[54:48] captivity uh then you could also go into
[54:51] Jeremiah and how he he talks uh uh uh
[54:55] the Babylonian
[54:57] uh come King Nebuchadnezzar come against
[54:59] Israel again Jerusalem and capture the
[55:02] king put his eyes out and and and and
[55:06] they served the Babylonians and the CH
[55:08] calans and and all of these things and
[55:11] so uh uh but if you notice anytime they
[55:14] went into captivity uh to Babylon it's
[55:17] when the people drifted from the word of
[55:20] the Lord when God's people drifted from
[55:23] the word of the Lord then Babylon Ians
[55:26] would have the power to bring them
[55:29] people into captivity and and and uh and
[55:33] this captivity was was a serious thing
[55:37] because they would make the people serve
[55:39] their gods they would make the people
[55:41] talk their language they would try their
[55:44] best to to uh uh uh make Israel make
[55:48] their enemy where just obsolete I guess
[55:52] it would be the word uh uh but God would
[55:55] always Preserve Israel but there was one
[55:58] time remember the prophecy was that
[55:59] Israel would serve in Babylon for 70
[56:02] years and and that's a long time to be
[56:05] in captivity serving other gods and and
[56:09] and such but but see uh uh uh uh but but
[56:13] God promised uh that Babylon would be
[56:17] utterly destroyed he he promised that
[56:20] Jeremiah
[56:21] 51:24 God would say I I will Render unto
[56:25] Babylon and to all the inhabitants of
[56:28] Cala uh all their evil that they have
[56:30] done in Zion in your sight sayeth the
[56:33] Lord behold I'm against thee Oh
[56:37] destroying Mountain so he calls Babylon
[56:40] a destroying Mountain sayeth the Lord
[56:43] which destroyeth not just just uh uh uh
[56:47] Israel not just attacking Israel but
[56:50] which destroyeth all the Earth and I
[56:53] will stretch out my hand upon thee and r
[56:56] thow thee down from the rocks and I will
[56:58] make thee a burnt mountain and they
[57:01] shall not take of thee a stone for a
[57:03] corner nor a stone for foundations but
[57:07] Thou shalt be desolate forever now I
[57:11] believe that it's talking of this day of
[57:15] of of Babylon of of of the age of course
[57:18] we know that the nation Babylon is long
[57:21] gone but that Spirit has carried on to
[57:24] where in Revelation it talks of mystery
[57:27] Babylon so so it it's uh uh what the
[57:31] nation was in the Old Testament all of
[57:34] its traits and its characteristics have
[57:36] been carried over in the New Testament
[57:39] but so so it's it's actually even though
[57:41] it doesn't exist as a nation as it did
[57:44] in the Old Testament is still existing
[57:46] in this in this age and so that God has
[57:49] promising that that they they're not
[57:52] going to take a stone of thee and and
[57:54] bring it a Cornerstone and build
[57:56] something else and and they're not going
[57:59] to uh uh take the stone for a foundation
[58:03] No all he said you're going to be
[58:04] desolate forever but but this destroying
[58:08] Mountain this power will be literally
[58:11] destroyed everything about it will be
[58:14] totally gone now notice he called it a
[58:17] destroying mountain now when I read that
[58:19] scripture it reminded me of the
[58:21] scripture in Zechariah 4:7 where God
[58:24] says who art thou oh great Mountain
[58:27] before zere reable Thou shalt become a
[58:31] plain and and of course we know the
[58:34] ministry of zerubabel if you read
[58:36] zerubabel go listen to the ministry of
[58:39] Grace or the message of Grace brother
[58:40] Braham talks about it but he talks about
[58:42] it in several places but but I believe
[58:45] that that Ministry this is prophetic of
[58:48] today in this age and and brother bram's
[58:52] Ministry actually fits this prophecy of
[58:55] zerubba
[58:56] amen and the ministry of how that he
[58:59] would set forth The
[59:00] Headstone amen he would not lay the
[59:03] Cornerstone that's been laid but he
[59:06] would Now set The Headstone up on the
[59:09] building and it's at that time that this
[59:12] mountain this great Mountain which which
[59:15] which uh uh uh uh to me fits with this
[59:19] scripture uh of Jeremiah calling it a
[59:23] destroying Mountain a man is in and then
[59:26] you look at even Daniel uh Daniel sees
[59:29] it as an image and there's a stone
[59:32] rolling down amen it's described in
[59:35] several ways but but in in when it's all
[59:38] said and done it's in this age that that
[59:41] kingdom is destroyed that Babylonian
[59:43] power that Babylonian Kingdom that
[59:46] Babylonian influence inspiration
[59:49] character whatever you want to call it
[59:52] it's destroyed utterly Amen in this age
[59:56] amen and and it it is to be destroyed
[1:00:00] when according to Daniel it's destroyed
[1:00:03] when the stone coming and rolling down
[1:00:05] the mountain which is the coming of the
[1:00:08] head stone Jesus Christ that's Jesus
[1:00:12] Christ can you say Amen you're putting
[1:00:14] all these scriptures together then you
[1:00:16] realize that at the revealing of the son
[1:00:19] of man that's that's when this all takes
[1:00:22] place is is uh the destroying of this
[1:00:26] and and and every nation is going to
[1:00:28] fall every kingdom is going to fall but
[1:00:33] but you know Jesus Christ is the stone
[1:00:36] do you believe that it is written you
[1:00:38] know uh where I believe it's Paul or
[1:00:41] Peter said the stone which the builders
[1:00:43] rejected the same is become the head of
[1:00:46] the corner it's The Headstone amen and
[1:00:50] and we know that in Colossians 1:18 Paul
[1:00:53] in speaking of Christ said is the head
[1:00:56] of the body the church ain't that right
[1:01:00] amen so uh uh he is the word therefore
[1:01:04] the word of God is The Headstone that
[1:01:06] comes to the body the church and and uh
[1:01:10] and and I hope it making a little sense
[1:01:13] to you but the seventh angel of
[1:01:15] Revelations 10:7 who is a prophet uh is
[1:01:20] on Earth at the time of this coming
[1:01:24] headstone amen and it scripture after
[1:01:28] scripture speaks you realize that
[1:01:30] brother random said there's more
[1:01:31] scriptures that talk of this coming than
[1:01:33] the first coming there's more scriptures
[1:01:36] that talk about you and your place your
[1:01:39] position of and and and and everything
[1:01:42] that it does about anything else of of
[1:01:45] of the first coming of Christ it's it's
[1:01:48] really amazing but but we find that the
[1:01:52] word uh uh comes to the prophet and so
[1:01:55] the seventh angel is the prophet that
[1:01:59] God promised to send in Malachi
[1:02:01] 4 and his ministry is going to affect
[1:02:07] everything his ministry it it has
[1:02:09] affected the world I I look look look at
[1:02:14] the world falling apart there's a
[1:02:16] there's a reason for it why did is why
[1:02:19] did Egypt fall apart because God sent a
[1:02:22] message of Deliverance can you say amen
[1:02:27] and and and the power that Egypt had
[1:02:29] over God's people no longer it was
[1:02:33] broken because there was a prophet stood
[1:02:36] with the message of Deliverance Let My
[1:02:39] People Go ain't that right and that
[1:02:42] message was to bring them people out of
[1:02:45] Egypt and whatever Egypt had and
[1:02:48] whatever Glory Egypt was was no
[1:02:52] more it it it it it fell upon
[1:02:56] apart and this world is falling apart
[1:02:59] this nation is falling apart the
[1:03:02] Babylonian system is falling apart
[1:03:04] denominations are falling apart world
[1:03:07] powers are falling apart uh uh uh men's
[1:03:11] minds are falling apart genius
[1:03:14] intellectuals are falling apart
[1:03:16] everything is falling apart why because
[1:03:19] it's time for deliverance it's time for
[1:03:22] deliverance of all things for there was
[1:03:25] a mighty angel that stood on the earth
[1:03:27] and said time shall be no more time of
[1:03:30] intellectual shall be no more time of of
[1:03:33] a politics shall be no more time of
[1:03:36] denomination shall be no more time of
[1:03:39] corruption shall be no more everything
[1:03:41] is changing why there is a city that's
[1:03:44] coming there is a a a God's kingdom is
[1:03:48] coming it's time for the people of God
[1:03:51] to come out of the corruption come out
[1:03:53] of Babylon come out of all the systems
[1:03:56] and dogmas and and the control of men
[1:04:00] come back to being sons of God and not
[1:04:04] only in your faith not only in your mind
[1:04:06] not only as as in your position but this
[1:04:09] whole vile body is going to be changed
[1:04:13] amen sickness and death and sin and all
[1:04:17] of that has lost its hold it's losing
[1:04:21] its hold because God sent a message of
[1:04:23] Deliverance
[1:04:26] it's in a message of
[1:04:28] Deliverance and and it's all coming to
[1:04:31] not everything that's not part of God's
[1:04:34] kingdom is falling
[1:04:38] apart and
[1:04:40] so the ministry of brother brandom which
[1:04:44] we believe to be the the ministry of
[1:04:46] Malachi 4 the seventh angel
[1:04:49] messenger and and it's it it his
[1:04:52] ministry was to turn our hearts back to
[1:04:55] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers not
[1:04:58] Pentecostal age Pentecostal

[1:05:10] that we uh that God has set for a time
[1:05:14] of Deliverance to be delivered from
[1:05:16] Babylon we have received the message of
[1:05:18] Deliverance in this last stage it is the
[1:05:21] last message to
[1:05:24] come is the last message I know other
[1:05:27] men have risen up trying to come up with
[1:05:29] their message but this is the last
[1:05:31] message to the elect and I will say it's
[1:05:34] the last message that this world will
[1:05:36] ever receive it's the last sign it's the
[1:05:39] last of everything can you say man to
[1:05:42] turn this message down is is to to walk
[1:05:45] away from
[1:05:48] Mercy it's true so now we are we are not
[1:05:53] to fear in this age amen men's hearts
[1:05:57] are failing for fear people don't know
[1:06:00] what to do uncertain about the political
[1:06:03] future
[1:06:05] right and if you're putting your faith
[1:06:07] in politics if you're any any in in any
[1:06:11] way you you've missed it am if you're
[1:06:14] putting your faith in Donald Trump or
[1:06:17] any Republican as though they're the
[1:06:19] Savior that's going to make your life
[1:06:21] better you've missed the
[1:06:24] bolt it's the message of the hour
[1:06:26] there's no future in
[1:06:28] politics there is no future in religion
[1:06:32] there is absolutely no future in
[1:06:35] education there is no future in in in
[1:06:39] science or whatever you want to call it
[1:06:41] it's all falling
[1:06:44] apart can you say Amen your only future
[1:06:48] is to get into the message of the hour
[1:06:51] your your only future is to take what
[1:06:53] God has provided by the message of the
[1:06:55] hour the token has been provided in this
[1:06:59] age for it was the message of the hour
[1:07:02] that loosed the Holy Spirit remember the
[1:07:05] Holy Spirit has been bound by these
[1:07:07] denominational Rivers for almost 2,000
[1:07:10] years to Prophet it but it is to be loed
[1:07:14] in the evening time by this evening time
[1:07:16] message and brother brandham showed us
[1:07:19] that the holy spirit for this age is the
[1:07:22] token life amen and that is what has
[1:07:26] been released to us so we are not to
[1:07:29] fear for the power of God that's in this
[1:07:31] message is destroying our enemy to where
[1:07:35] we shall see him no more the enemy is
[1:07:38] not people the enemy is Satan himself
[1:07:42] that is influencing people amen and and
[1:07:46] these things so now if you noce Micah I
[1:07:51] believe that's Micah uh 4 and10 being
[1:07:55] pain and labor to bring forth oh
[1:07:57] Daughter of Zion like a woman in travail
[1:08:01] for now shalt thou go forth out of the
[1:08:04] city and thou shalt dwell in the field
[1:08:06] and thou shalt go even to Babylon there
[1:08:10] there shalt thou be delivered there the
[1:08:14] Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of
[1:08:17] thine enemies can you say Amen so this
[1:08:21] is what we're seeing is a deliverance
[1:08:25] from from B Babylon and and from the
[1:08:28] hand of her now Babylon what is Babylon
[1:08:33] it's a state of
[1:08:34] confusion we don't look at Babylon just
[1:08:37] it as a natural Nation but we look at
[1:08:41] babyon what Babylon truly means it's
[1:08:44] it's confusion a state of disorder or
[1:08:49] disturbance now we know that God is not
[1:08:51] the founder of Babylon never was even in
[1:08:55] the old Testament uh for he's not the
[1:08:57] author of confusion and and uh uh
[1:09:01] according to scripture confusion is the
[1:09:04] direct result of sin or unbelief now
[1:09:08] notice Daniel 9 and7 oh Lord
[1:09:12] righteousness belongeth unto thee but
[1:09:15] unto us confusion of faces as at this
[1:09:19] day to the men of Judah and to the
[1:09:21] inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all
[1:09:24] Israel that are near here and that are
[1:09:26] far off uh through all the the countries
[1:09:30] whether thou H thou Hast driven them
[1:09:33] because of their transp trespass that
[1:09:37] they have trespassed against thee see so
[1:09:40] confusion has come be to them because of
[1:09:44] transgression trespassing against God oh
[1:09:48] Lord to us belongeth confusion of fa to
[1:09:52] our Kings to our princes and to our
[1:09:55] father others because we have sinned
[1:09:57] against thee ain't that right so when a
[1:10:00] man disbelieves God's word because
[1:10:02] that's what the sin is is unbelief when
[1:10:05] a man disbelieves God's word turn God's
[1:10:08] word down what does he do he
[1:10:10] automatically goes into confusion that's
[1:10:13] why this nation is in confusion of today
[1:10:16] because they turn down the message of
[1:10:18] the hour any time God's revealed word
[1:10:21] Vindicated word is turned down the
[1:10:24] people go in into utter confusion can
[1:10:27] you sayen this is exactly what Eve done
[1:10:31] she she had God's word lived by God's
[1:10:34] word then she listened to that Serpent
[1:10:38] of course Satan incarnated himself in
[1:10:41] that Serpent and began to talk through
[1:10:44] that serpent to Eve he talked to her the
[1:10:47] word quoted God's word verb badum until
[1:10:50] he got one he left one word out ain't
[1:10:52] that right amen one word and she became
[1:10:57] confused because she listened to him and
[1:11:00] brother Brown said she she believed all
[1:11:03] one every promise but got confused on
[1:11:05] one Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:11:08] today and forever ain't that right so
[1:11:11] when we don't take God's word and
[1:11:14] believe it holy holy then you come into
[1:11:18] a state of confusion to what you don't
[1:11:21] know to where you become you don't know
[1:11:23] if it's really right or wrong you start
[1:11:25] listening to this you start listening to
[1:11:27] that well but but you know and and then
[1:11:29] all of a sudden people start
[1:11:31] discrediting the message they start
[1:11:32] discrediting the messenger well he was
[1:11:35] man and he missed it here he missed it
[1:11:37] there well I I can believe well then you
[1:11:39] start becoming your own absolute and
[1:11:42] then you throw yourself into confusion
[1:11:45] to where you don't know the government
[1:11:47] sounds good the neighbor sounds right uh
[1:11:49] uh this preacher sounds right this
[1:11:51] denomination sounds right and before you
[1:11:53] know it you're back into a state of
[1:11:55] confusion you don't know what to do can
[1:11:58] you say amen and the point was is to get
[1:12:01] us out of Babylon to call us out of this
[1:12:04] confusion and if we're going to come out
[1:12:06] of confusion you've got to have an
[1:12:10] absolute amen now if you notice James
[1:12:14] 3:16 for where envying and strife is
[1:12:18] notice that where envying and strife is
[1:12:21] there is confusion and every evil word
[1:12:26] work where evil and strife is now so I
[1:12:30] look this word up Envy envying because
[1:12:34] if there's envying there's confusion so
[1:12:36] I looked up this word envying it means
[1:12:39] jealousy
[1:12:41] indignation so now we can go back it was
[1:12:45] Cain that became jealous of his
[1:12:49] brother Cain because of his jealousy
[1:12:53] refused to accept the word the revealed
[1:12:57] word that came to
[1:12:59] Abel ain't that right see the carnal
[1:13:02] always gets jealous of the spiritual the
[1:13:05] fundamental Believers always get jealous
[1:13:07] of the Believers who had the
[1:13:09] supernatural moving among them and and
[1:13:11] and and Moab of the Old Testament is
[1:13:14] another prime example of how they got
[1:13:17] jealous of their Brethren they were
[1:13:19] fundamental believers they done
[1:13:21] everything they had the same altars the
[1:13:23] same number the same sacrific the same
[1:13:26] everything even they had a prophet among
[1:13:29] them but not Vindicated of course and
[1:13:32] and and approved him to be a false
[1:13:34] prophet but nonetheless they got
[1:13:37] jealous of the Brethren of Israel
[1:13:41] because they had a pillar of fire they
[1:13:44] had a mercy seat they were Vindicated of
[1:13:47] God and they became
[1:13:50] jealous and in the end it brought
[1:13:53] confusion among Israel right because
[1:13:55] Israel joined themselves up with them
[1:13:57] right see and so uh uh we're you know
[1:14:02] we're we're did Cain get his nature to
[1:14:05] be jealous brother BR said well that
[1:14:07] come from his father Satan and and then
[1:14:10] you look what Satan was in the beginning
[1:14:12] his his name was actually Lucifer and
[1:14:15] and you realize that he had the he had
[1:14:18] he he was he was next to God he had he
[1:14:21] was co-workers with God he could not
[1:14:25] create but he was co-workers with God he
[1:14:28] he set just I mean there was there was
[1:14:30] God Satan and then it it drifted all the
[1:14:33] way down angels and and positions and
[1:14:36] all that but Satan was right here next
[1:14:38] to God and and he was a beautiful angel
[1:14:41] he he had it all ain't that right and
[1:14:44] but what happened he got
[1:14:46] jealous jealous ining jealous of God and
[1:14:52] and and and what did it brought
[1:14:54] confusion
[1:14:56] to where he was able to draw 2/3 of the
[1:14:59] angels I think it was 2/3 or a third one
[1:15:03] he drew Angels under his Gathering
[1:15:07] through
[1:15:08] jealousy everything it was one worship
[1:15:11] it was everybody was satisfied God was
[1:15:16] God yeah but then jealousy arose and
[1:15:20] brought
[1:15:21] envying in heaven
[1:15:25] right amen come on now Prophet said he
[1:15:29] wanted a brighter and a better and
[1:15:31] prettier Kingdom than what God had so
[1:15:35] envying where envying and strife is
[1:15:38] there is confusion that's right now I
[1:15:41] looked up the word strife it means
[1:15:43] contention a desire to put oneself
[1:15:47] forward Rebellion yeah so so brother
[1:15:51] Bram said see Disobedience means
[1:15:54] Rebellion yeah brother Bram talks about
[1:15:56] or or Paul I believe uh uh in the Bible
[1:15:59] talks about children of Disobedience
[1:16:02] children of rebellion and it all goes
[1:16:05] back
[1:16:06] Strife so so these things causes
[1:16:09] confusion if if it would be nice if if
[1:16:13] if if it was just one Doctrine One Faith
[1:16:16] one belief one God one Lord and and and
[1:16:21] and truly there is but why does why do
[1:16:24] we we have more than one God why do they
[1:16:27] teach that why why do they teach more
[1:16:29] than just one doctrines and and and why
[1:16:32] why do we have it's
[1:16:35] confusion and it all stems from
[1:16:38] Rebellion jealousy Rebellion
[1:16:43] Strife they can't let God be God and
[1:16:45] just rule that's
[1:16:48] right so they are rebellious children of
[1:16:52] strife children of disobedience and
[1:16:55] brother Bram said what are they
[1:16:56] rebelling against they're rebelling
[1:16:59] against the revealed word of
[1:17:01] God and what does that do brings
[1:17:07] confusion amen that's right brother BR
[1:17:10] said see Cain rebelled against Abel's
[1:17:13] revealed
[1:17:14] Revelation that was Vindicated of God
[1:17:16] that it was righteous right another
[1:17:18] place he said see the Pharisees with
[1:17:20] their own denominational knowledge of
[1:17:23] what the word of God was selected
[1:17:25] handpicked men rebelled against the
[1:17:29] Vindicated word of God made manifest for
[1:17:31] the day Jesus Christ and they killed
[1:17:35] him see if they would have just let
[1:17:37] Jesus say I am the word I am the truth
[1:17:39] the way and the life and let God
[1:17:41] vindicate that which God did everybody
[1:17:45] could have believed it see but oh no we
[1:17:47] ain't going to do that he's not part of
[1:17:48] us he's teaching something contrary than
[1:17:51] what we taught instead of just humbling
[1:17:54] themselves saying God's Vindicated his
[1:17:57] message they said oh no and they taught
[1:18:00] the people not to believe that and then
[1:18:03] they crucified him it brought confusion
[1:18:06] among the people right it's always that
[1:18:10] way we hear about Noah building the
[1:18:13] ark that's you know but then the prophet
[1:18:15] says there was other people building
[1:18:17] arcs there was other people building
[1:18:19] boats why didn't they just just do what
[1:18:22] they were doing just just continue on
[1:18:25] and just believe Noah's
[1:18:28] message but they they got jealous they
[1:18:31] and it ca strife and before you know
[1:18:33] what Disobedience and then they start
[1:18:35] working among the people confusion don't
[1:18:37] believe that old oh oh fogy you know and
[1:18:40] and and and and then they started
[1:18:43] questioning the message oh do you have
[1:18:45] proof it's going to rain we've never
[1:18:48] we've got all of our technology to show
[1:18:50] that it'll never rain see and they were
[1:18:52] confusing the people
[1:18:55] right come on
[1:18:56] now that's right they brought confusion
[1:18:59] amen so where there is
[1:19:02] rebellion and
[1:19:04] strife contention you will always find
[1:19:08] confusion now if you look 1 Samuel
[1:19:12] 15:23 it says Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:19:17] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:19:20] iniquity and
[1:19:22] idolatry so if you study history you'll
[1:19:25] find out that both Witchcraft and
[1:19:27] idolatry was practiced in
[1:19:32] Babylon so that would tell us that a man
[1:19:34] doesn't have to literally practice
[1:19:36] Witchcraft and
[1:19:38] idolatry to be in
[1:19:40] Babylon just being rebellious against
[1:19:43] the revealed word of God and being
[1:19:47] stubborn which I looked up the word
[1:19:50] stubborn it's a display of pushing
[1:19:53] against arrogance
[1:19:55] fighting against it makes you part of
[1:19:58] Babylon that's right just to fight
[1:20:00] against the revealed word of God just to
[1:20:03] rebel against the word of God and say
[1:20:06] well I don't have to listen to that I
[1:20:07] ain't doing that and and then you you
[1:20:11] you fight against it you're just part of
[1:20:14] Babylon because it's the same thing as
[1:20:16] witchcraft it's the same sin as
[1:20:18] witchcraft and
[1:20:22] idolatry amen so envying
[1:20:25] Rebellion
[1:20:26] Strife contention against the revealed
[1:20:30] word of God breeds confusion and every
[1:20:33] evil
[1:20:35] work so then we can see that Babylon
[1:20:38] comes from the devil he is the one who
[1:20:41] desired in the beginning to put himself
[1:20:43] forward against God's revealed provided
[1:20:47] way because of his jealousy so therefore
[1:20:50] he's the author of confusion notice Isa
[1:20:54] Isaiah 14 and12 how art thou fallen from
[1:20:58] Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how
[1:21:00] art thou cut down to the ground which
[1:21:02] did US weak in the Nations for thou has
[1:21:04] said it in thine heart God never told
[1:21:05] him he said it in his heart he put
[1:21:09] himself in in a position that God never
[1:21:12] would put himself in put him in because
[1:21:15] he can't be it but he says I I thou has
[1:21:18] said in thine heart I will Ascend into
[1:21:20] heaven I will exalt my throne above the
[1:21:21] sons of God or stars of God Sons of God
[1:21:25] I will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:21:28] congregation in the sides of the north I
[1:21:31] will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:21:32] clouds I will be like the most high amen
[1:21:36] I will be so he he's the one that sets
[1:21:39] himself forward and of course if he's
[1:21:41] going to be like the most high God then
[1:21:43] he's got to have a following he's got to
[1:21:45] have a drawing and so this has been his
[1:21:48] whole motive in on the earth is to have
[1:21:51] a following now we all know that God had
[1:21:55] a son Adam but Satan could not have a
[1:21:58] son but but he's got to do what God does
[1:22:01] so he cannot create a son like God did
[1:22:03] so the only thing he could do was to
[1:22:06] Incarnate himself in the serpent which
[1:22:09] was next to
[1:22:12] man the Bible says he walked he had legs
[1:22:15] he
[1:22:16] talked he was the most subtle of all
[1:22:19] Beast smart
[1:22:22] shrewd beautiful yeah Satan incarnated
[1:22:26] himself and he convinced and we all know
[1:22:28] how he became s Cain was his
[1:22:32] son through a sex
[1:22:36] act and and Satan was able to come
[1:22:39] through that direction amen and this is
[1:22:42] how he's been able to influence Mankind
[1:22:44] and all this time he's been able he's
[1:22:47] been after he's been after worship to
[1:22:50] take all the worship from God the true
[1:22:53] God and EST Lish his own self his own
[1:22:56] kingdom his own ways his own garden his
[1:23:00] Eden all these things right because he's
[1:23:04] the one that set himself forward and any
[1:23:08] man any woman boy girl that sets themsel
[1:23:11] as the authority above God's word is
[1:23:14] inspired of that
[1:23:17] Spirit Cain did
[1:23:19] it Cain did it Cain offered something
[1:23:23] that he thought would be good
[1:23:25] but when God did not accept it he got
[1:23:28] upset and instead of humbling himself
[1:23:31] amen and saying K Abel's right I see God
[1:23:34] Vindicated that sacrifice so I'm going
[1:23:36] to and God God gave him that AB offer
[1:23:39] God offered it said will you just not do
[1:23:42] what your your brother did if you just
[1:23:44] do it I'll accept it that's right oh no
[1:23:47] he couldn't do that think about that's
[1:23:49] coming in line with God's revelation I
[1:23:51] ain't gonna do that and so he slew yeah
[1:23:54] the
[1:23:56] righteous so the original name for
[1:23:58] Babylon was Babel and its origin is
[1:24:02] found in Genesis as we talked about last
[1:24:04] Sunday I believe it was founded by Kush
[1:24:07] and uh the son of
[1:24:10] ham but it
[1:24:12] was Nimrod the son of kush Noah's
[1:24:16] grandson that brought the kingdom of
[1:24:19] Babylon Babel to power and magnificence
[1:24:24] and the whole point of the building of
[1:24:27] the Tower of Babel uh which again was in
[1:24:31] Genesis there was to build a man-made
[1:24:36] Earthly
[1:24:37] Dominion apart from God Dominion apart
[1:24:41] from God power apart from God right and
[1:24:46] a government apart from God all these
[1:24:48] things anything apart from God and so
[1:24:50] the Bible states that Nimrod was a
[1:24:53] mighty one in the Earth in other words
[1:24:55] he was a man of
[1:24:57] influence the word Nimrod means to take
[1:25:00] to steal Rebel it means a
[1:25:04] tyrant and this is exactly nimrod's
[1:25:08] character his nature he's the one that
[1:25:12] challenged questioned the supremacy of
[1:25:16] God he was the Bible called him a mighty
[1:25:19] warrior or Hunter uh uh a mighty Hunter
[1:25:23] a warrior before the Lord one writer
[1:25:26] says that signified he was in opposition
[1:25:29] of the Lord a warrior in opposition of
[1:25:33] God so his his his whole motive you know
[1:25:37] and and and to oppose anything of God
[1:25:42] and and so that was his nature his
[1:25:45] character that's the way he was built so
[1:25:47] before Babel the whole earth was of one
[1:25:50] language of one speech it was also the
[1:25:53] entire our Earth had only one religion
[1:25:57] as as we talked about last Sunday the
[1:25:59] people believed in one God Supreme
[1:26:01] Eternal invisible who by the word of his
[1:26:04] mouth spoke all things into existence
[1:26:06] and that in his character he was loving
[1:26:09] good and just this was what all people
[1:26:12] believed of any religion that that
[1:26:15] people had it was just one religion and
[1:26:17] that was God was God he was Supreme he
[1:26:20] was the one that created heaven and
[1:26:22] earth they all believed in that no other
[1:26:25] God nothing it was only one God ain't
[1:26:27] that right but then Nimrod come see we
[1:26:32] being inspired of the devil set out to
[1:26:34] accomplish three things to build a
[1:26:36] strong Nation to propagate his own
[1:26:39] religion and to make a name for himself
[1:26:42] and he was successful at doing that you
[1:26:45] see when when people be be come anointed
[1:26:49] of Satan then what happens they become
[1:26:52] inspired to seek and to do something
[1:26:56] outside of what God has provided for
[1:27:00] them and I I I hope I'm making some
[1:27:02] sense to you just speaking of what
[1:27:05] Babylon and what inspired
[1:27:08] Babylon it was it was established to do
[1:27:11] something outside of God's provided way
[1:27:14] amen and this is also how mystery
[1:27:17] Babylon got started but Nimrod was known
[1:27:21] for strength and Ambitions he sought
[1:27:23] power and control Beyond human limits
[1:27:27] his his
[1:27:28] accomplishments were so Monumental that
[1:27:31] the kingdom of Babylon was called the
[1:27:32] head of gold amongst all World
[1:27:35] governments right and he built a super
[1:27:38] Tower and a super religion the prophet
[1:27:40] said so Babylon is actually where
[1:27:43] idolatry
[1:27:45] began the confusion of religion began at
[1:27:49] Babylon
[1:27:51] Babel uh uh it was there that s
[1:27:54] corrupted the minds and heart of men to
[1:27:56] where they rejected the truth and it
[1:27:59] became the seat of
[1:28:01] idolatry so so in in in in other words
[1:28:05] uh uh the people now began to see that
[1:28:08] that there's more than one God there's
[1:28:10] more than one way of worship there's
[1:28:13] more uh uh than than all these things
[1:28:15] just like they're saying today that
[1:28:17] there's more more than one way to get to
[1:28:19] heaven and and on and on and on there's
[1:28:22] more than one just God accepts all kinds
[1:28:25] of Lifestyles and and and things like
[1:28:28] that as as you know it's all
[1:28:31] confusion and this is this is what this
[1:28:33] is what Nimrod done by propagating his
[1:28:36] own religion and his own ways and
[1:28:38] idolatry it just brought
[1:28:40] confusion hello it's true it's the basis
[1:28:45] of Babel is Babylon is is the basis for
[1:28:49] every system of idolatry and the theme
[1:28:53] of Mythology though the names of the
[1:28:55] Gods differ in various sections of the
[1:28:57] land according to the language of the
[1:28:59] people and then Babylon Babel uh the
[1:29:03] land of the childes calans whatever it
[1:29:07] became the
[1:29:09] oppressor it became the oppressor it
[1:29:11] become a
[1:29:13] dictator and I read this the other day
[1:29:15] and thought it went with what brother
[1:29:17] brandham taught it and and uh according
[1:29:20] to what the ancient historians recorded
[1:29:24] Nimrod was deified as a father of the
[1:29:27] Gods and was given the title of
[1:29:29] emancipator deliverer of
[1:29:32] mankind rebelling against the authority
[1:29:35] of Heaven men worshiped Pagan deities
[1:29:40] the name zeroster means seed of a woman
[1:29:43] this is an illusion to Genesis 3:15 in
[1:29:46] the a in this ancient religion see much
[1:29:50] of pagan mythology traces its historical
[1:29:54] origin back to Genesis 11 Babel and
[1:29:57] Nimrod in rebellious uh Pagan religion
[1:30:01] man's idea becomes the standard of
[1:30:04] Truth man decides to be his own
[1:30:07] deliverer def deifies himself and seeks
[1:30:11] to restore Paradise through Empire
[1:30:14] Building yeah Nimrod is not only a
[1:30:17] founder of Empire building and Rebellion
[1:30:20] but he also founded false Worship in a
[1:30:23] one World religious
[1:30:26] culture so this is historians talking of
[1:30:29] these things of of what Nimrod was and
[1:30:33] what how all this started at
[1:30:35] Babylon but not only that it was a
[1:30:38] forced
[1:30:39] religion he not only propagated his
[1:30:42] religion but now it became a forced
[1:30:45] religion brother Braham said it was a
[1:30:47] forced Unity that represented by groups
[1:30:50] of people at Babylon see we want to have
[1:30:54] Unity so how are they going to do it
[1:30:56] force people to come together force
[1:31:00] people in one worship force people can
[1:31:03] you say Amen it's all inspiration of the
[1:31:06] devil amen see and so if you know uh
[1:31:10] it's like uh that started at Babel but
[1:31:13] then you you find out years later in
[1:31:15] Babylon the king Reser raises uh erects
[1:31:19] an image brother Brown said it was a
[1:31:22] holy image a a the image of a holy man
[1:31:26] and and all Babylon was required uh uh
[1:31:30] uh captives and and citizens uh were
[1:31:33] were required to to to bow down to this
[1:31:36] worship uh this Idol of worship see it
[1:31:38] was a forced worship and those who did
[1:31:41] not do it we find out was thrown into
[1:31:44] the fiery furnace right see and and so
[1:31:48] they they were persecuted for not doing
[1:31:50] that it was also in Babylon that uh that
[1:31:52] everybody was for to pray a uh to
[1:31:55] another God outside of the one true God
[1:31:59] and Daniel refused to do
[1:32:01] it and he was thrown in the Lion's then
[1:32:03] for it it was a forced worship a ain't
[1:32:07] that right see so then babyon brother
[1:32:10] Bram said Babylon is the only type of
[1:32:13] our modern organized religion right amen
[1:32:17] if you want to find a type for it it's
[1:32:19] Babylon and it's a forced
[1:32:22] Unity so brother Ram says it was founded
[1:32:25] by Nimrod and a forced Unity among
[1:32:28] religious people and that's what the
[1:32:30] Creeds and our denominations do today
[1:32:33] it's a force Unity you either belong to
[1:32:36] this or you're
[1:32:38] out I I just speaking of this uh the
[1:32:41] Methodist Church um yeah probably should
[1:32:45] have said that but a man uh was talking
[1:32:47] to me the other day about it and and how
[1:32:50] he belonged belongs to it and just here
[1:32:55] uh in town uh you know they they have
[1:32:57] decided to vote
[1:32:59] in uh way everybody I guess seems to be
[1:33:02] going in in homosexual and and and the
[1:33:05] lifestyle of that way and they've AC the
[1:33:09] church denomination has accepted that
[1:33:11] well he and several others have
[1:33:13] withstood that and said no we're not
[1:33:14] going to be a part of it and they kicked
[1:33:16] him out don't him you're not welcome
[1:33:19] here at this
[1:33:21] church and and he says I I can't even go
[1:33:24] I can't even walk in that building
[1:33:26] anymore because I've disagreed with them
[1:33:29] and they they they won't let us in we
[1:33:31] don't know where to go that's
[1:33:34] right but see it's a force Unity among
[1:33:37] religious people and that's what Creeds
[1:33:39] and are denominations do today forced
[1:33:41] Unity you either belong to this or
[1:33:43] you're out and we're coming now and we
[1:33:45] can see to a forcing all in this age
[1:33:50] they're going to force all into one
[1:33:53] great
[1:33:57] Unity but he said that but that is a man
[1:34:01] mechanical made device by a man and it
[1:34:05] cannot
[1:34:06] stand it is not God's will it is not
[1:34:10] God's program no matter how people try
[1:34:13] to say it is it isn't it can't be it's
[1:34:16] just impossible for it to be God
[1:34:19] wouldn't put his name in such a thing as
[1:34:21] that that denies his word how can God
[1:34:24] live in something that denies his own
[1:34:27] word right what is what is communism we
[1:34:30] got communism and everybody talking
[1:34:33] about communism everybody worried about
[1:34:34] communism Russia China I think and
[1:34:37] different ones are communists what is
[1:34:40] communist it's a force
[1:34:42] Unity that's that's that's what it is
[1:34:45] and and I looked it up communism it's a
[1:34:47] system in which goods are owned in
[1:34:51] common and are available to all as
[1:34:54] needed see so everybody shares equal
[1:34:58] everybody see it's it's you know it's a
[1:35:01] theory advocating elimination of private
[1:35:04] property a system in which goods are
[1:35:07] owned in
[1:35:09] common and are available to all as
[1:35:11] needed a theory advocating elimination
[1:35:14] of private property so what yours is
[1:35:20] mine what's mine is
[1:35:22] yours come on
[1:35:24] it's equal so if you got more money than
[1:35:27] I've got brother Doug that's wrong you
[1:35:29] shouldn't have
[1:35:32] that so you can't say that it's your
[1:35:35] $10,000 that's my $10,000
[1:35:41] too see it's a force something amen
[1:35:45] ain't that right now communism though is
[1:35:48] actually a a perversion of what they had
[1:35:51] in the days of Acts that's right it's
[1:35:53] it's it's a look acts 2:43 and fear Came
[1:35:57] Upon every soul and Many Wonders and
[1:36:00] signs were done by the apostles and they
[1:36:02] all and all that believed were together
[1:36:05] and had all things common and sold their
[1:36:08] possessions and goods and part of them
[1:36:10] to all men as every man had need right
[1:36:15] right that's right acts 4:30 and the
[1:36:18] multitude of them that believed were of
[1:36:21] one heart and of one Soul neither said
[1:36:24] any of them that ought uh that ought of
[1:36:26] the things which he possessed was his
[1:36:28] own but they had all things in common so
[1:36:31] you know what brother Brown says
[1:36:33] Pentecost had real
[1:36:35] communism
[1:36:37] Pentecost but it was under the authority
[1:36:40] of God it was the power of God it wasn't
[1:36:43] a Force com thing it wasn't a force
[1:36:46] Unity see man is trying to bring that
[1:36:49] about out apart from God apart from the
[1:36:52] power of God yeah yeah hello they're
[1:36:56] trying to bring a love a human love and
[1:36:59] force everybody into this that you
[1:37:02] accept it all but we find out it don't
[1:37:04] work cuz look what they're doing now you
[1:37:06] got to love homosexual you got to accept
[1:37:09] everybody but don't but look at them
[1:37:11] them same people are out on the streets
[1:37:13] fighting against
[1:37:16] Jews because it doesn't
[1:37:19] work so they want to shut us down from
[1:37:22] preaching against the sin that you got
[1:37:24] to just love everybody and if you don't
[1:37:27] love according to what they say it's
[1:37:30] hate but then they'll go out on the
[1:37:32] streets burn buildings and burn this
[1:37:36] and because it won't
[1:37:39] work the only thing that brings people
[1:37:41] truly together is the power of God and
[1:37:45] that's what happened at
[1:37:47] Pentecost amen can you say
[1:37:49] Amen so brother Brandon said that the
[1:37:52] communism that Rush and China and all
[1:37:54] these other countries have is a false
[1:37:58] Pentecost see so so he says brother
[1:38:01] Brown talking about Russia they're
[1:38:02] trying to force all men into communism
[1:38:04] where every man has everything commonly
[1:38:07] see uh the Devils come around and got
[1:38:09] into that into the world and made a
[1:38:12] political power to force man to
[1:38:16] that can you say Amen trust me it's it's
[1:38:19] it's coming yeah a political power
[1:38:24] to force men into a
[1:38:26] Unity that's what Nimrod started with
[1:38:29] but God had a
[1:38:32] Unity
[1:38:34] right but Nimrod under the inspiration
[1:38:37] of Satan started his own kingdom Babel
[1:38:41] Babylon come on now and then he's going
[1:38:44] to force everybody to his
[1:38:47] Unity his
[1:38:51] religion I don't know
[1:38:54] but see Pentecost produced it this Unity
[1:38:57] by the power of God coming into the
[1:38:59] people now if you look at it when the
[1:39:02] Catholic Church rose up which is Mystery
[1:39:05] babblin it's it's we all know it's part
[1:39:07] of it all it's it's trying to make
[1:39:11] everyone become Catholic brother brah
[1:39:14] said the Protestant church under the
[1:39:15] Federation of churches the World Council
[1:39:17] of churches is trying to force all the
[1:39:19] little churches out and require everyone
[1:39:21] to belong to the union of churches
[1:39:24] it's just a work of the devil everybody
[1:39:26] got to
[1:39:27] belong can you sayen but it ain't going
[1:39:30] to last because it's under a man-made
[1:39:35] program right I want to say it to you
[1:39:37] man has nothing to do with your
[1:39:39] salvation man should have nothing to do
[1:39:41] with your convictions man has nothing to
[1:39:44] do with your calling it isn't that we
[1:39:47] make preachers it's God calls them
[1:39:50] preachers we can't ordain preachers and
[1:39:53] and just because we pray over a man you
[1:39:56] know that makes him a preacher God has
[1:39:58] to make him a preacher God has to make
[1:40:00] you a Christian God has to unite the
[1:40:05] hearts can you say man man has nothing
[1:40:08] to do with you belonging to the Church
[1:40:09] of Jesus Christ you're born into this
[1:40:13] body by one spirit and that's his Spirit
[1:40:17] no National Force can make you that
[1:40:21] way right you believe it amen Acts 2:47
[1:40:25] says the Lord added to the church daily
[1:40:27] such as should be saved John 6:44 no man
[1:40:31] can come to me except the Father which
[1:40:33] ha uh has sent me draw him Romans 9:16
[1:40:37] so then it is not of him that willth nor
[1:40:40] of him that runneth but of God that
[1:40:42] showeth Mercy Philippians 1:6 being
[1:40:45] confident of this very thing that he
[1:40:47] which hath begun a good work in you will
[1:40:49] perform it or complete it until the day
[1:40:52] of Jesus Christ can you say Amen brother
[1:40:55] R says God does not force man to do
[1:40:57] anything you do it on your own free will
[1:40:59] he can warn you throw a barricade across
[1:41:02] your path but you walk your own self
[1:41:05] with your own decision in his presence
[1:41:07] to make him your savior but Satan has
[1:41:09] perverted God's plan to his own plan and
[1:41:12] wants to force everything that's what
[1:41:14] legalism is all about is to make people
[1:41:16] Christians you legalism don't make
[1:41:19] people
[1:41:20] Christians Force everybody to dress long
[1:41:24] you know long sleeves long skirts long
[1:41:30] hair and what it does it becomes a
[1:41:33] force if the spirit of God can't put it
[1:41:36] in you nothing
[1:41:39] will as brother Bram said I've you know
[1:41:42] you he said I've seen you know women
[1:41:44] long hair long skirts that has a temper
[1:41:46] like a blade saw or whatever buzz buzz
[1:41:49] saw you know it's it's it's because it's
[1:41:52] not a force of of worship it's not a
[1:41:55] force of unity it's God's power God's
[1:41:59] spirit dealing on the individual's
[1:42:03] lives but see Babel brought on a forced
[1:42:06] worship it was the first organization
[1:42:08] ever started brother Bram said this this
[1:42:10] great Babylon was just a false Gathering
[1:42:13] it was a false coming together and
[1:42:16] notice another place what he says in
[1:42:17] every case you will notice that a false
[1:42:19] prophet is one who is outside the word
[1:42:21] just as we showed you that the that
[1:42:24] Antichrist means anti- word so these
[1:42:26] false prophets come perverting the word
[1:42:28] giving it a meaning that fits their own
[1:42:31] devilish ends have you ever noticed how
[1:42:33] the people who lead others astray bind
[1:42:35] them closely to themselves by fear they
[1:42:38] say if the people don't do what they say
[1:42:40] or if they leave then destruction will
[1:42:41] follow see they are false prophets for a
[1:42:44] true Prophet will always lead one to the
[1:42:46] word and bind the people to Jesus Christ
[1:42:48] he won't tell the people to fear Him or
[1:42:50] what he says but to fear what the word
[1:42:52] says can you say Amen as we get ready to
[1:42:56] close now the city if you look notice
[1:42:59] the city of
[1:43:00] Babel the city was 120 Mi
[1:43:05] around each side was 30 mi from wall to
[1:43:10] wall it was it was surrounded by a wall
[1:43:13] 30 mi from wall to wall the city the
[1:43:16] walls were 80 ft High 40 ft wide across
[1:43:20] the
[1:43:21] top it had streets that were 200 ft
[1:43:26] wide the gates of the city were made out
[1:43:28] of brass and right in the center of that
[1:43:31] city was the
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:34] throne so and no matter what gate you
[1:43:37] entered it had different
[1:43:39] Gates but what no matter what gate you
[1:43:42] entered every
[1:43:43] street LED right to the
[1:43:46] throne that was in the in in the city
[1:43:49] see all roads pointed to the throne by
[1:43:52] the Throne uh you know and I'm getting
[1:43:55] this from uh the church age
[1:43:58] book uh but by the throne flowed the
[1:44:02] river Euphrates with uh the Tigris there
[1:44:06] and it watered the whole uh uh shinar
[1:44:10] Valley and in the city there was
[1:44:13] swinging Gardens and and that hung
[1:44:16] around the walls and brother brand said
[1:44:19] what the city was it was a type of the
[1:44:20] great Celestial city of God yeah and
[1:44:24] that anything that Satan does it's
[1:44:26] always a perversion of what God has and
[1:44:29] so this city was what was was a
[1:44:32] perversion of actually the city that is
[1:44:34] promised to come see it's a perversion
[1:44:38] of God City it and and and and it's just
[1:44:41] like this Mortal life is a perversion of
[1:44:44] eternal life that's that's just what it
[1:44:47] is ain't that right see so uh uh so then
[1:44:51] then nimrod caused all the other cities
[1:44:54] to pay tribute to this one city which is
[1:44:58] again a perversion of the new Eternal
[1:45:00] City to come for Revelations 21:24 and
[1:45:04] the nations of them which are saved walk
[1:45:07] uh shall walk in the light of it the the
[1:45:10] city the Heavenly City and the kings of
[1:45:13] the earth do bring their Glory and Honor
[1:45:15] into it and the gates of it shall not be
[1:45:18] shut At All by day for there shall be no
[1:45:20] night there and they shall bring the
[1:45:23] glory and honor of the Nations into it
[1:45:26] in other words they're going to pay
[1:45:28] tribute to the city but it ain't a force
[1:45:31] but here now under the devil would
[1:45:34] pervert what God's start got and and and
[1:45:38] the plans of God and he would raise up
[1:45:41] his own City and would cause by force
[1:45:45] all the nations to pay tribute to
[1:45:47] it a perversion can you say amen amen so
[1:45:52] what is Mr Babylon and we'll get more
[1:45:54] into it the Lord willing but it's a
[1:45:58] perversion of what God has it's a
[1:46:00] perverted Church a perverted Unity a
[1:46:03] perverted worship a perverted Pentecost
[1:46:07] and it's brought nothing but Mass
[1:46:10] confusion can you say Amen you know as
[1:46:13] we said last Sunday that when God
[1:46:16] started the church uh there on the day
[1:46:20] of Pentecost it was a Pentecostal Church
[1:46:23] there was only one Faith one Lord one
[1:46:26] baptism one Doctrine one church and and
[1:46:30] so then then anything that man does
[1:46:34] apart from God it it always brings
[1:46:37] confusion it breeds confusion and and
[1:46:40] and so then then you have to ask here we
[1:46:43] are Seven Ages later Church ages how how
[1:46:47] how why do we have the confusion if it
[1:46:49] started out with one Lord one baptism
[1:46:51] One Faith one Doctrine one church and
[1:46:54] and and one Spirit baptizing the people
[1:46:57] into the church how how do we end up
[1:46:59] with all these other stuff it's it's
[1:47:02] because it's brought confusion man
[1:47:05] somewhere got away from the word of God
[1:47:08] and started his own thing and that's how
[1:47:11] Mr babblin has started it's under the
[1:47:13] Same Spirit same
[1:47:15] inspiration same motive same everything
[1:47:18] can you say amen that's exactly right
[1:47:21] and if you look Revel 62 and I saw and
[1:47:24] behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:47:26] upon the throne or sat set up sat on him
[1:47:29] had a bow and a crown was given unto him
[1:47:32] and he went forth conquering and to
[1:47:34] conquer everybody thought this was was
[1:47:36] Christ even brother Brown said he
[1:47:38] thought it was Christ until the seal
[1:47:41] became open and then he realized this
[1:47:45] was Satan riding on a white horse he was
[1:47:48] an impostor acting as though he was
[1:47:50] Christ looking as though he was Christ
[1:47:53] coming into the church innocent yeah can
[1:47:56] you say amen and yet it was an
[1:47:59] antichrist spirit and Antichrist means
[1:48:01] against Christ against the word ain't
[1:48:03] that right and and so re remember in the
[1:48:06] first church age there was a certain
[1:48:09] thing that got started uh uh in the
[1:48:12] church age that the Holy Spirit was
[1:48:15] against and and Revelations 2:6 God says
[1:48:19] but this that this thou Hast that thou
[1:48:22] hatest the Deeds of the nickan which I
[1:48:25] also hate see so so that thing started
[1:48:28] in the first church age 3ome years or
[1:48:32] just a little bit after the day of
[1:48:33] Pentecost here comes another Spirit
[1:48:37] riding in which was the Deeds of the
[1:48:40] nicians remember niiko means to conquer
[1:48:43] yeah Ley see means the church the Ley
[1:48:48] nians conquer the Ley conquer the church
[1:48:53] take the Holy Spirit out of the church
[1:48:55] and give it all to one holy man and let
[1:48:58] him be the boss of it all is that what
[1:49:00] Nimrod
[1:49:02] began he began to be the superior
[1:49:05] one father of the
[1:49:09] Gods so so then leoty means the church
[1:49:12] so they were trying to overthrow God's
[1:49:15] true
[1:49:17] church come on and to do that was to
[1:49:20] bring confusion to divide to to conquer
[1:49:23] right amen ain't that right yes so
[1:49:26] notice the people were being subjected
[1:49:28] somehow in a way the prophet said that
[1:49:31] was absolutely contrary to the word of
[1:49:34] God they were trying to take the church
[1:49:36] where God had pastors and the spirit of
[1:49:39] God moving by gifts in the Church of the
[1:49:41] Living God and they were having a
[1:49:43] Doctrine start that they were going to
[1:49:45] have some priests Bishops popes and so
[1:49:48] forth see it was not in God's plan but
[1:49:52] that began to creep into the
[1:49:55] church you see on the day of Pentecost
[1:49:58] God came into the church himself to
[1:50:01] operate it amen and we find out that the
[1:50:04] book of Acts you know they on on if you
[1:50:07] look at your book The the title is the
[1:50:09] Acts of the Apostles brother Brown that
[1:50:11] wasn't the Acts of the Apostles he said
[1:50:13] it should be written the acts of the
[1:50:15] Holy
[1:50:16] Spirit right it was Christ in the
[1:50:19] apostles performing The Works can you
[1:50:23] say amen he gave them power to become
[1:50:25] sons of God he's the one that added to
[1:50:28] the church daily he directed The People
[1:50:31] where to go and what to do he was the
[1:50:33] one that translated Philip from one
[1:50:35] place to another place he was the one
[1:50:37] who raised Paul from the dead he was the
[1:50:39] one who brought the people under
[1:50:41] conviction by his very power it was him
[1:50:46] in the church him operating in the
[1:50:48] church but then Here Comes This Spirit
[1:50:51] of antichrist work working in the church
[1:50:55] to take the Holy Spirit out and if you
[1:50:58] notice the Apostle Paul did his best to
[1:51:00] warn the people of this Acts 20 and 29
[1:51:03] he said I know this that after my
[1:51:05] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[1:51:07] in among you not sparing the flock
[1:51:10] notice this Grievious woles will come in
[1:51:13] among you not sparing the flock how is
[1:51:17] this he's going to bring confusion in
[1:51:20] that's right amen also of your own
[1:51:24] selves of your own selves amen not not
[1:51:28] heathens of the Romans and and and
[1:51:32] whatever but of your own in the in
[1:51:35] amongst you shall men arise speaking
[1:51:39] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:51:41] after them remember all people after the
[1:51:44] day of Pentecost One Faith one Lord one
[1:51:47] baptism one Spirit one Unity God working
[1:51:52] among them but now people will rise up
[1:51:54] among them drawing disciples after them
[1:51:57] is that not what Satan done in the in
[1:51:59] heaven
[1:52:00] yeah to draw away disciples after them
[1:52:03] therefore watch and remember that by the
[1:52:06] space of three years I cease not to warn
[1:52:09] everyone night and day with tears see so
[1:52:14] so then then if you notice the true
[1:52:16] church has always had to discern what
[1:52:20] spirit is working among them always
[1:52:23] it's been that way All Through the Ages
[1:52:25] and Paul was telling them discern
[1:52:28] because there's men among you that's
[1:52:29] going to rise up and it's going to break
[1:52:32] that Unity it's going to bring division
[1:52:35] because they're jealous and strife and
[1:52:38] they're they're putting themselves
[1:52:39] forward above the word of God that that
[1:52:41] I have brought unto you that God has
[1:52:43] done on the day of
[1:52:45] Pentecost and they're going to draw
[1:52:47] disciples under themselves they're going
[1:52:49] to break that Unity can you say Amen
[1:52:53] even Jesus said in Matthew 7:15 beware
[1:52:56] of false prophets which come to you in
[1:52:58] sheep's
[1:53:00] clothing but inwardly they are raving
[1:53:03] wolves see brother briam said the wolves
[1:53:05] that Paul was speaking of were the Deeds
[1:53:09] of the nians yes and in the first church
[1:53:12] age and I'm getting ready close but in
[1:53:15] the first church age it was called the
[1:53:16] Deeds the deed of the nicians what were
[1:53:19] they doing they were just kind of
[1:53:21] entertaining the thought you know maybe
[1:53:23] having people over for supper and and
[1:53:25] and as they're having supper throw out a
[1:53:27] little question what do you think about
[1:53:28] if we do it this way what what what what
[1:53:30] what do you think if we just you know
[1:53:32] you know don't don't you think that
[1:53:33] maybe maybe that the apostles are just
[1:53:36] acting a little too asserting themselves
[1:53:39] maybe Paul's acting like he's a big wig
[1:53:41] or something I I mean I don't know I'm
[1:53:43] just asking you if you feel that way you
[1:53:46] know and and here have some more mashed
[1:53:48] potatoes you know and and and it's just
[1:53:51] little tidbit praise God I'm just
[1:53:54] anxious for church
[1:53:55] tonight Paul's going to be preaching
[1:53:57] bless the lord well he just slandered
[1:54:00] Paul yeah he just slandered the
[1:54:03] preachers yeah but oh bless the Lord
[1:54:05] we're going to have a good time but they
[1:54:08] just putting in a little tidbit just
[1:54:09] like the serpent did with Eve oh you
[1:54:13] think God really meant that come on now
[1:54:15] oh God's a loving God you know what I
[1:54:18] mean and and they were introducing
[1:54:20] things to the people right see instead
[1:54:24] of Shing the up one faith and inuring up
[1:54:27] they started questioning just so little
[1:54:30] questions W you think brother Brandon
[1:54:33] really meant it that way I mean can you
[1:54:36] have you ever found it in the word of
[1:54:37] God that it was that way or not I mean
[1:54:40] of course everybody else says that he's
[1:54:42] kind of
[1:54:45] wrong I mean aren't we supposed to
[1:54:46] believe the Bible after all I I mean I
[1:54:48] don't know you know I mean I'm just
[1:54:50] asking you maybe you could you know
[1:54:53] praise God we're message Believers
[1:54:55] aren't
[1:54:57] we but it was just little tidbits here
[1:55:00] Deeds of the
[1:55:01] nicians see and so they were
[1:55:04] entertaining that idea planting thoughts
[1:55:06] in the people's minds that would listen
[1:55:08] to them men of influence men that had
[1:55:12] good
[1:55:13] Charisma you know yeah these days they
[1:55:16] get people to feel sorry for them oh I'm
[1:55:19] being such attacked I just they they
[1:55:22] they they just don't see and and they're
[1:55:24] preaching against me all the time and
[1:55:27] and people start feeling oh bless your
[1:55:29] heart so they win people over by
[1:55:33] sympathy but then if you notice the
[1:55:35] second Church age it become the doctrine
[1:55:38] amen of the
[1:55:40] nicians now it had crept into the church
[1:55:43] enough to where now ministers are
[1:55:47] standing behind the pulpit and are
[1:55:48] teaching it as
[1:55:50] Doctrine this is the way it's want to be
[1:55:53] right right see so they start teaching
[1:55:57] it now exerting it be not just behind in
[1:55:59] the kitchen table and not just in the
[1:56:01] secret but now they're coming in and
[1:56:03] starting to present it to the
[1:56:06] people and so it became the doctrine of
[1:56:08] the nickan but notice by the time the
[1:56:11] Third Church age came it become a
[1:56:13] persecution yeah that if you don't
[1:56:15] believe the way we believe it you'll
[1:56:20] die now brother br brother Brown says
[1:56:23] the first church age was still
[1:56:25] Pentecost and the Pentecostal church was
[1:56:27] quite a large church at the beginning
[1:56:29] with Pentecostal power but they had a
[1:56:32] denominational Spirit come among them
[1:56:35] trying to dominate the church which was
[1:56:38] called the Deeds of the
[1:56:40] nicians then it come to the second
[1:56:43] Church age it was denomination and
[1:56:46] Pentecost was being more squeezed out
[1:56:50] formalism form worship formal this
[1:56:54] everything that God started at the day
[1:56:55] of Pentecost started being pushed out
[1:56:57] the door just a little bit and now it
[1:56:59] becomes stronger in the second Church
[1:57:01] age to where the Prophet said by the
[1:57:04] time the Third Church age came around
[1:57:06] Pentecost was almost squeezed
[1:57:09] out I see how Satan does that so subtly
[1:57:13] mystery
[1:57:15] Babylon of course the Third Church age
[1:57:18] was the age that when Nia uh Council
[1:57:20] took place and this is when the colonel
[1:57:24] brother Brown said the colonel nicians
[1:57:26] had overpowered the Pentecostal
[1:57:30] groups and he said when I say Pentecost
[1:57:33] that doesn't mean this organization of
[1:57:34] the day that we're living in that's just
[1:57:36] as guilty as the rest of them but I mean
[1:57:38] the real Pentecostal the real spirit of
[1:57:41] God with the original Doctrine with the
[1:57:43] original blessings with the original
[1:57:45] names with the original exactly the way
[1:57:48] it began at the beginning like it went
[1:57:51] through the Bible
[1:57:52] can you say Amen if the musicians Will
[1:57:56] Come Bless the Lord
[1:57:59] Jesus another place he said so way back
[1:58:02] there in the early church a very short
[1:58:05] period after Pentecost the false Vine
[1:58:08] that Babylonian
[1:58:10] Vine Antichrist see that false Vine got
[1:58:15] to intertwine itself around the True
[1:58:17] Vine and we find the Deeds of the
[1:58:19] nicians and that spirit is going to be
[1:58:22] found fighting the True Vine until it is
[1:58:25] destroyed by
[1:58:27] God can you say amen amen that spirit
[1:58:31] will be destroyed amen but until then
[1:58:34] it's going to fight your faith it's
[1:58:36] going to fight your joy it's going to
[1:58:38] fight everything about you amen it's
[1:58:42] it's it's it's just his that's can you
[1:58:45] say
[1:58:47] Amen but if you notice that Antichrist
[1:58:51] Spirit could not come into the church
[1:58:53] without meeting resistance and that's
[1:58:55] what I really liked about it Revelations
[1:58:58] 2:1 it says unto the angel of the Church
[1:59:01] of Ephesus
[1:59:02] write these things saith he that holdeth
[1:59:05] the Seven Stars in his right hand who
[1:59:06] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:59:08] candlesticks I Know Thy Works thy labor
[1:59:11] thy patience and how thou can cannot
[1:59:15] bear them which are
[1:59:18] evil and thou Hast tried them which say
[1:59:20] they are Apostles and not and has found
[1:59:23] them
[1:59:25] Liars The Prophet said God and the
[1:59:27] church agreed upon one thing that they
[1:59:30] hated the Deeds of the nicians the True
[1:59:32] Vine the True Vine the true church that
[1:59:34] was in the E Ephesian Church age
[1:59:37] Ephesian Church they hated the Deeds of
[1:59:39] the nicians and they resisted that
[1:59:42] Spirit just like the the tribe of
[1:59:45] Shem they
[1:59:48] resisted that Spirit of nimrod that was
[1:59:52] was trying to bring confusion they
[1:59:54] resisted that teaching they resisted
[1:59:56] that doctrine that he was trying to put
[1:59:58] in upon the people even though they were
[2:00:00] few and it seemed like the world that
[2:00:03] Nimrod won the world over his religion
[2:00:06] spread throughout the world but there
[2:00:08] was still a people that would resist
[2:00:11] that
[2:00:11] [Music]
[2:00:14] spirit and there that true elect that
[2:00:17] true church found them they tried that
[2:00:20] spirit and found them to be
[2:00:23] Liars brother Braham said how do they
[2:00:26] know that they were Liars because they
[2:00:27] weren't quoting with the word of
[2:00:30] God he says if a man says the days of
[2:00:33] Miracles is passed that man is a
[2:00:35] liar for the Bible says that Jes it's
[2:00:38] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:00:40] and forever if a man says that you've
[2:00:42] got to be baptized in the name of Father
[2:00:45] Son and Holy Ghost using titles that man
[2:00:48] is a
[2:00:49] liar we could go on and on and on
[2:00:52] if that man stands and tells you it's
[2:00:54] okay for you women to wear your makeup
[2:00:56] that man's a
[2:00:57] liar tells you that you can just live
[2:01:00] any old ungodly way that man's a
[2:01:03] liar can you say
[2:01:05] Amen why amen how do you know because
[2:01:08] he's not quoting with the word of
[2:01:11] God Peter said here repent and be
[2:01:13] baptized every one of you for the
[2:01:15] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:01:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost see
[2:01:19] so anything they found them to be Liars
[2:01:22] because they were teaching against the
[2:01:24] word of God can you say Amen brother
[2:01:27] brandom says why why do these false
[2:01:29] prophets come against the true prophet
[2:01:31] and discredit his teachings why do they
[2:01:33] do that it's because they're run and
[2:01:34] true to form as did their forefathers
[2:01:37] when they with stood the prophet Micaiah
[2:01:39] uh uh in the days of Arab there was 400
[2:01:43] prophets false prophets 400 of them
[2:01:46] against one true prophet and all them
[2:01:48] 400 prophets were saying the same thing
[2:01:50] they agreed upon same thing and they
[2:01:53] were saying the same thing until they
[2:01:54] got the people confused as to which is
[2:01:57] right because it looked like the
[2:01:59] majority was right surely 400 of them
[2:02:02] were saying the same thing surely they
[2:02:04] got to be right here's that old one one
[2:02:06] man saying totally different than what
[2:02:08] these 400 prophets amen and so they
[2:02:11] started they they began to get confused
[2:02:13] just like it was when them 10 spies
[2:02:15] against the two spies and the people got
[2:02:18] confused upon the promises of God they
[2:02:21] all believed the the majority can you
[2:02:24] say Amen brother Braham says see they
[2:02:27] were all of them were saying the same
[2:02:28] thing till they fooled the people but
[2:02:30] one Prophet just one was right and all
[2:02:33] the rest was wrong because God had
[2:02:35] committed the Revelation to him only one
[2:02:38] can you say Amen prise the Lord then he
[2:02:41] says this only the elect can you say
[2:02:43] that with me only the elect will not be
[2:02:47] deceived only the elect why brother
[2:02:50] briam said cuz they are f fill with the
[2:02:52] spirit of God and are led by him he said
[2:02:54] there isn't any man can fool you Paul
[2:02:58] could not fool any elect had he been
[2:03:02] wrong and in that first church age the
[2:03:04] elect there could not be fooled for they
[2:03:07] tried the false Apostles and Prophets
[2:03:09] and found them to be liars and put them
[2:03:13] out Hallelujah his sheep hear his voice
[2:03:17] and they follow him aren't you glad that
