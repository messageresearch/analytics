[34:57] amen
[35:13] amen I was thinking about that song that
[35:15] brother Doug sang I remember I was
[35:18] somewhere recently and um
[35:20] with a group of I think there were quite
[35:22] a few um nominal Christians there and
[35:25] they they were really nice people but we
[35:27] were talking about something
[35:29] and um
[35:31] I remember like when they said something
[35:33] I was like oh yeah brother Branham
[35:35] talked about that you know like that was
[35:36] the first thing I wanted to say
[35:38] because I was thinking well they'll know
[35:40] what I'm talking about but I was
[35:42] thinking but they don't it is a
[35:44] different language that we speak and um
[35:47] I think I still ended up you know I I
[35:49] kind of tried to still fit it in there
[35:52] that I could but I was like you just
[35:54] can't say it in the same capacity when
[35:57] you're with a different group of people
[35:58] and uh anyway I'm thankful that we've
[36:01] been able to we've been blessed to learn
[36:04] that language you know and revelated to
[36:07] it
[36:11] hmm
[36:13] I never said that I would give you
[36:16] silver gold or that you would never feel
[36:21] the fire or shiver in the cold
[36:24] but I did say you'd never
[36:28] Walk Through This World alone
[36:36] and I did say
[36:40] don't make this world your home
[36:49] I never said that I would give you
[36:52] silver or gold or that you would never
[36:57] feel the fire or shiver in the cold
[37:01] but I did say you'd never walk through
[37:06] this world alone
[37:08] [Music]
[37:12] and I did say
[37:16] don't make this world your home
[37:21] foreign
[37:25] I never said that fear wouldn't find you
[37:29] in the night or that loneliness was
[37:33] something you'd never have to fight but
[37:37] I did say I'd be there
[37:41] right by your side
[37:49] and I did same
[37:52] I'll always help you fight
[38:00] cause you know I made a promise that I
[38:05] intend to keep my Grace will be
[38:09] sufficient in every time of need my love
[38:14] will be the anchor that you can hold on
[38:18] to
[38:20] this is the promise
[38:23] this is the promise I've made to you
[38:32] I never said that friends would never
[38:36] turn their backs on you or that the
[38:40] world around you wouldn't see you as a
[38:43] fool but I did say like me
[38:48] you'll surely be despised
[38:52] [Music]

[47:18] understand but uh when you see the body
[47:21] coming together and it's not just a
[47:24] pastor's church it's it's the People's
[47:26] Church and
[47:27] we all interested in in God's what God
[47:30] is doing and and
[47:33] so we certainly appreciate those that
[47:36] were able to come and and I know
[47:39] no doubt everyone wanted to come and
[47:41] couldn't come but um some couldn't but
[47:44] anyway it's it's just good when Brothers
[47:48] can come together and sisters and good
[47:52] to have brother Jordan amen God bless

[47:56] always good to have him and uh
[48:00] that little Luke man you've done a good
[48:03] job man
[48:04] yeah I've done good singing right there
[48:06] buddy so we uh uh always good to see
[48:11] these young people
[48:12] uh
[48:13] entering into service and I said always
[48:16] always but this message produces the
[48:19] best young people
[48:21] you know we when I was a kid you know
[48:24] in the Pentecostal uh now my dad except
[48:28] my dad and you know my dad made us sit
[48:31] on that front row
[48:32] we couldn't pass nodes we couldn't do
[48:35] nothing so we didn't get to have that
[48:36] you know fun
[48:38] that all of my friends buddy they were
[48:41] all in the back passing notes cutting up
[48:43] and all that stuff and and
[48:48] you know I guess every one of them are
[48:50] out of church today
[48:52] and um but you you get on you know I've
[48:56] gone to Pentecostal churches just to
[48:58] visit and and it's the same way young
[49:00] people don't care but our young people I
[49:04] tell you uh you get the young people
[49:06] together whether it's in this church or
[49:08] any any place uh most places in the
[49:12] message our young people are on the
[49:14] front they're interested in God
[49:16] listening to the services taking notes
[49:19] and I just say God bless you young
[49:23] people
[49:24] you have that desire to serve the Lord
[49:27] and we sure love and appreciate you and
[49:30] glad to hear the just you got touched
[49:34] and blessed and had a wonderful time at
[49:37] camp they're in Oklahoma and
[49:41] um like to say it's just good to have my
[49:43] precious daughter back amen she was gone
[49:47] for a couple weeks and flew back
[49:49] yesterday and so glad to have her
[49:52] and also I was asked to announce to you
[49:57] sisters that there is a sign up sheet in
[49:59] the back for desserts for the upcoming
[50:03] meeting
[50:04] so we asked that uh if you want to do
[50:09] something uh for the Lord this would be
[50:12] a good way to start and let's make a
[50:15] dessert because it will be much needed
[50:18] and you you will need to sign by April
[50:22] 16th and so just keep that in mind and
[50:28] also
[50:30] brother Sherman
[50:32] Davis I guess all of us know brother
[50:35] Sherman but he is in need of our prayer
[50:38] as he's going through just a really
[50:40] rough time right now uh yes first of all
[50:43] I had surgery yesterday and his
[50:48] gallbladder I believe and it was a
[50:51] doctor went in there and it was gangrene
[50:54] had set in
[50:56] so he's uh he's you know recovering from
[50:59] that but also his brother Donnie passed
[51:01] away Wednesday and so there to be having
[51:05] the memorial service uh today at two and
[51:09] so you know
[51:10] um and and so I I know that's got to be
[51:13] hard for brother Sherman and the family
[51:16] and so we want to just keep them in our
[51:19] prayer at the Lord will just strengthen
[51:22] him help him and the family as they go
[51:26] through this
[51:27] this uh this time and
[51:31] um also uh uh uh asked to announce there
[51:36] are CDs in the back singing CDs of that
[51:40] if you want to take
[51:42] one or all of them home with you or
[51:47] whatever but I think there's uh brother
[51:50] Matt Morris had a CD sister Vanessa
[51:53] Morris had a CD brother Sherman I think
[51:56] their CDs are in the back and so if you
[51:59] want one you're welcome to take them and
[52:03] that I know you'd be blessed I'm sure
[52:08] also brother Andrew is in New Mexico
[52:12] preaching for brother Manuel today and
[52:15] so we want to just keep him in our
[52:17] prayers and he's asked me to greet you
[52:20] all him and sister Mariah really hated
[52:23] uh that they weren't able to make it
[52:25] yesterday for the the work day and he
[52:28] said just to greet you missing the
[52:31] church and you know we certainly missed
[52:34] the when they're gone and um
[52:38] you know but he's got a a job to do and
[52:42] and so he's he's doing that as an
[52:45] evangelist and so we want to always keep
[52:47] him in our prayer and that is a task
[52:52] I've done it for several years
[52:55] evangelizing and and
[52:58] there's there's always the pros and cons
[53:00] to it just as there is to pastoring or
[53:03] whatever we do
[53:05] um but we we want to do what the Lord
[53:07] has called us to do and do it with all
[53:10] that's within us amen and I believe
[53:12] brother Andrew is doing that and we
[53:15] certainly appreciate him and and his
[53:18] family
[53:19] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[53:21] turn to the Book of Proverbs the first
[53:24] chapter and those that are sick the
[53:27] Sister Crystal uh sick Brother Sam uh
[53:31] sick and
[53:33] so we want to keep them in our prayer
[53:35] and it's good to have sister Hannah with
[53:38] us amen and always miss her when she's
[53:40] gone good to see brother shamaya and
[53:43] sister Bethany feeling better
[53:45] there and good to have them back in
[53:48] service with us and just everyone
[53:52] that is able to come today we want to
[53:55] just keep brother Walker in our prayer
[53:58] and always continuing to pray for him
[54:02] amen the Lord will just be with him
[54:05] praise the Lord but before we go into
[54:08] the word let's just bow our heads and
[54:11] talk to our Lord father
[54:15] we come to you this morning
[54:17] realizing our need for thee
[54:21] Lord we we don't want to ever get to the
[54:24] place that we're self-sufficient
[54:28] and Lord there's times that even we
[54:30] don't even realize it but
[54:32] we go throughout the day not even
[54:34] acknowledging you and just asking your
[54:38] help in the simple things
[54:40] and Lord but we want to take the time
[54:43] today just to ask you Lord to be with us
[54:47] and to help us
[54:49] father as the song says we can't even
[54:51] walk without you holding our hand
[54:54] and Lord if it wasn't for your grace if
[54:56] it wasn't for your hedge built around us
[55:00] Satan would be able to to destroy us
[55:02] Satan would be able to
[55:04] to have his way with this but Lord
[55:07] we are as what Paul would say we are
[55:11] what we are by the grace of God
[55:14] and father we pray that your our worship
[55:19] the songs that have been sung
[55:22] are pleasing in your sight Lord that you
[55:25] would feel welcome here
[55:27] I pray that you would just take over now
[55:30] Lord and annoying both speaker and
[55:33] hearer is our prayer and let it be just
[55:35] a divine
[55:37] Divine saying Lord that only can come by
[55:40] you Lord and your Prophet said that
[55:43] we'll never leave a service the same
[55:46] I pray that every one of us will leave
[55:48] better this morning
[55:50] father and let it be because of you
[55:54] we ask it Lord bless the church here God
[55:58] bless the congregation
[56:00] is our prayer Lord grant the desires of
[56:02] their heart those that are sick God
[56:05] pray that you had just touched them
[56:07] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[56:10] amen
[56:13] we look at Proverbs the
[56:16] first chapter
[56:27] but it says
[56:30] the Proverbs of Solomon
[56:34] the son of David king of Israel
[56:37] to know wisdom and instruction
[56:40] to perceive the words of understanding
[56:45] to receive instruction of wisdom Justice
[56:48] and judgment and equity
[56:51] to give sub septility to the simple to
[56:55] the young man knowledge and discretion
[56:59] a wise man will hear and will increase
[57:02] in learning
[57:04] a man of understanding shall attain to
[57:07] wise counsel
[57:10] to understand the proverb and the
[57:13] interpretation the words of the wise and
[57:17] their dark sayings
[57:20] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[57:23] knowledge
[57:24] can you say that with me the fear of the
[57:26] Lord is the beginning of knowledge
[57:29] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[57:34] may the Lord just add in his Blessing to
[57:37] the word you can have your seats this
[57:39] morning
[57:41] and
[57:45] and I guess the the title that I would
[57:47] use I'm going to continue
[57:50] with this thought but uh the title I
[57:53] guess I would use is the
[57:57] the fear of the Lord begins with
[57:59] knowledge
[58:00] a few weeks ago this
[58:03] um
[58:04] this phrase came to me the fear of the
[58:09] Lord
[58:10] and so I I went to search what the Bible
[58:14] and said about it what the prophet had
[58:17] to say and I found out that having the
[58:20] fear of the Lord is is really important
[58:23] for us and um and I also discovered that
[58:28] it is a rare thing today
[58:31] and that really only the elect will have
[58:34] it the fear of the Lord
[58:37] the whole world as we've talked about we
[58:40] know it is possessed with fear but this
[58:43] is what the prophet would call this kind
[58:45] of fear is the devil's fear
[58:47] and it it has torment
[58:51] and we see that God delivers his people
[58:54] from this type of fear and that this
[58:57] fear does not come from God for the
[58:59] Bible says that the Lord hath not given
[59:02] us the spirit of fear
[59:04] but but we find that he does give his
[59:08] people fear and it is the fear of the
[59:11] Lord
[59:12] and we talked about it but the fear of
[59:15] the Lord brings a respect a reverence
[59:18] and all
[59:21] towards God
[59:24] and to his word
[59:26] now there's people that have fear of a
[59:29] they they respect maybe a a basketball
[59:33] player an athlete of some sort or the
[59:36] president or and and and and you should
[59:39] always well when it comes to an office
[59:41] like the president we should we should
[59:43] respect that office as best as we can
[59:47] but but there's a greater fear that the
[59:50] Lord would give us and that is for him
[59:53] and his word
[59:55] it's a holy fear
[59:57] that uh brings about a faith in God a
[1:00:01] trust in God a a confidence a love for
[1:00:05] God and it's all wrapped up in the fear
[1:00:08] of the Lord to have this confidence in
[1:00:11] God it takes the fear of the Lord to
[1:00:13] have a love for God it takes the fear of
[1:00:15] the Lord it to have this trust in God it
[1:00:19] takes the fear of the Lord and and it it
[1:00:22] doesn't mean that you're afraid of him
[1:00:24] we we should be beyond that and and when
[1:00:28] I say that I'm not saying that we don't
[1:00:29] deal with with things that Satan tries
[1:00:32] to put on our mind uh but but really
[1:00:36] down in our soul there should be this
[1:00:38] confidence that that come hell or high
[1:00:41] water God is always faithful to me yeah
[1:00:45] and well that that that that that would
[1:00:47] have to start with the fear of the Lord
[1:00:49] You Have To in order to have that you
[1:00:52] have to have the fear of the Lord
[1:00:53] because you you can't you can't have
[1:00:57] confidence in something you don't
[1:00:58] respect you you can't have trust and and
[1:01:01] uh love for something that you just
[1:01:03] don't you don't reverence but but see so
[1:01:06] it starts with respect and reverence uh
[1:01:09] to him and so we we find that the the
[1:01:12] fear uh uh uh of the Lord brings a a uh
[1:01:17] you're not afraid of him but but what it
[1:01:19] does is you want to honor him in all
[1:01:22] that you do and all that you say and and
[1:01:25] uh uh it causes an individual to want to
[1:01:29] please God to to walk softly and humbly
[1:01:33] before him you you you wouldn't want to
[1:01:36] act arrogant not not when you have the
[1:01:38] fear of the Lord because
[1:01:40] you you have a knowledge of him you you
[1:01:43] so so it brings a reverence and a
[1:01:46] respect you respect his counsel you
[1:01:49] respect his wisdom you respect you
[1:01:51] understand what I'm saying it's just
[1:01:53] like when you have respect for your
[1:01:54] Elder then you ain't gonna sit there and
[1:01:56] tell that Elder what to do uh if you
[1:01:58] have respect for a man that that has
[1:02:01] gone through you you've seen it you know
[1:02:03] maybe your your uh uh a soldier If he if
[1:02:06] you're just a a young uh punk you know
[1:02:10] and and you you've come into this in
[1:02:13] into uh to the Army but you've seen this
[1:02:15] guy that's gone through battles and and
[1:02:18] he's he's Brave and he's uh he's you
[1:02:21] know you've seen him go through things
[1:02:23] and well it should develop a respect and
[1:02:27] so then then you start looking at that
[1:02:29] individual like wow you know so then
[1:02:32] when he gives you an advice you ain't
[1:02:34] like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no you
[1:02:37] respect that individual so then you
[1:02:40] start taking his vice seriously because
[1:02:42] you know he's been through it so now
[1:02:44] he's teaching teaching you how to how to
[1:02:46] be brave he's teaching you amen how to
[1:02:48] avoid certain traps of the enemy because
[1:02:51] you've seen what he's done and and so
[1:02:54] you've developed this ain't that right
[1:02:56] and and and so it it that that goes with
[1:02:59] young men that's starting a business or
[1:03:02] whatever you've seen a guy that that
[1:03:03] that has started a business and he's ran
[1:03:06] that business he's successful with that
[1:03:08] business and then he tries to tell you
[1:03:09] advice and then you say yeah yeah yeah
[1:03:11] yeah and then you go start trying to do
[1:03:13] your own thing well I think you're a
[1:03:15] punk you know what I'm saying you're
[1:03:16] just what the Bible would call a fool if
[1:03:19] you can't take advice if you can't take
[1:03:21] wisdom if you can but when you see and
[1:03:24] you see this man is successful and he is
[1:03:26] trying to impart knowledge to you good
[1:03:29] to have you sis I overlooked you but uh
[1:03:31] good to have you amen but he's trying to
[1:03:34] impart knowledge to you he's trying to
[1:03:36] impart wisdom he's trying to part uh to
[1:03:39] save you from failure well if you
[1:03:42] reverence him and you respect his
[1:03:44] experience then then you will take his
[1:03:47] knowledge and you'll take his advice
[1:03:49] you'll take amen because there is a
[1:03:52] reverence there is a respect well how
[1:03:54] much is it with God then if you have the
[1:03:57] fear of the Lord ain't that right and
[1:04:00] and so then then we we begin to take
[1:04:04] notice of God we begin to take notice of
[1:04:06] what he wants we uh what he desires what
[1:04:10] he he he is after and and so therefore
[1:04:14] the fear of the Lord uh causes
[1:04:16] individuals who have it to be careful
[1:04:18] how they act to be careful in what they
[1:04:21] say to be careful in what they listen to
[1:04:23] and to look at you know what they look
[1:04:26] at and all these things because they
[1:04:28] don't want to displease the Lord in any
[1:04:32] way ain't that right so Proverbs 8 13
[1:04:35] says the fear of the Lord is to hate
[1:04:38] evil well why because God hates evil and
[1:04:43] so if you have the fear of the Lord and
[1:04:46] your reverence him and you're in all of
[1:04:48] him well then wouldn't that bring the
[1:04:51] same attitude towards you that if God
[1:04:54] hates it whatever pleases God pleases me
[1:04:56] whatever he ate then I hate whatever you
[1:05:00] see and so Proverbs 16 6 tells us that
[1:05:03] men depart from Evil when they have the
[1:05:07] fear of the Lord ain't that right see so
[1:05:11] then the fear of the Lord brings an
[1:05:13] about an action upon our part now we are
[1:05:17] living in an age where people instead of
[1:05:20] departing from Evil they are calling
[1:05:22] evil good and good evil ain't that right
[1:05:27] and they're fulfilling the prophecy
[1:05:29] where Isaiah 5 20 says woe unto them
[1:05:33] that call evil call good uh evil good
[1:05:36] and good evil that put forth put
[1:05:39] Darkness for light and light for
[1:05:42] darkness that put bitter for sweet and
[1:05:45] Sweet for bitter see they don't
[1:05:47] understand the difference between good
[1:05:49] and evil so they're calling that which
[1:05:52] is evil good and that which is good evil
[1:05:55] ain't that right so what is good well
[1:05:58] Psalms 34 8 would tell us oh taste and
[1:06:03] see that the Lord he is good ain't that
[1:06:08] right but we're living in a day amen
[1:06:11] that they call that which is good evil
[1:06:14] and that which is evil good ain't that
[1:06:17] right well then they don't understand
[1:06:19] the difference between light and
[1:06:21] darkness because they're putting forth
[1:06:23] uh uh they consider Darkness to be light
[1:06:27] and light to considered to be Darkness
[1:06:30] but then we find First John 1 and 5.
[1:06:33] this then is the message that we've
[1:06:35] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:06:38] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[1:06:42] at all but they call that which is light
[1:06:45] darkness and that which is Darkness they
[1:06:48] call light ain't that right well then
[1:06:51] they we're living in age they don't cons
[1:06:53] they don't understand the difference
[1:06:55] between sweet and bitter amen and here
[1:06:58] yet Psalms 119 and 103 it tells us how
[1:07:03] sweet are thy words unto my days yay
[1:07:08] sweeter than honey to my mouth ain't
[1:07:11] that right and Psalms 141 and 6 when
[1:07:14] their judges are overthrown in Stony
[1:07:17] places they shall hear my words for they
[1:07:21] are sweet ain't that right but yet we
[1:07:25] find that the Bible says for this age
[1:07:27] they will call uh uh this that which is
[1:07:31] sweet they'll call it bitter and that
[1:07:33] which is bitter they will call it sweet
[1:07:35] see see so there's no understanding uh
[1:07:40] uh in in this age at all a man and so
[1:07:43] therefore the Bible tells us that we are
[1:07:47] to serve God having the fear of the Lord
[1:07:51] ain't that right amen not to use our own
[1:07:54] judgment but the fear of the Lord brings
[1:07:57] about a judgment that is right amen
[1:08:00] because now to have the fear of the Lord
[1:08:03] you can't re you can't reverence the
[1:08:05] basketball player more than God hey man
[1:08:08] what is that basketball player going to
[1:08:09] do for you ain't that right you have to
[1:08:12] play you you have to pay 200 and some
[1:08:14] dollars just for a ticket or more then
[1:08:19] and then you don't even know if they're
[1:08:21] going to win or lose and even if they do
[1:08:22] win what did it do for you you got to go
[1:08:25] back to your own miserable life you got
[1:08:26] to go back to work you didn't bring your
[1:08:28] retirement it didn't bring you uh uh uh
[1:08:31] you know uh uh the jackpot did nothing
[1:08:34] for you at all and yet people reverence
[1:08:36] the that a man but when it comes to God
[1:08:39] they don't want nothing to do with it
[1:08:41] and he's your joy he's your life he's
[1:08:43] your peace he's your anchor he's your
[1:08:46] salvation he becomes your Refuge amen
[1:08:49] but they call that which is good evil
[1:08:51] and they call that which is evil good
[1:08:53] and yet that basketball that basketball
[1:08:56] players probably you know a lot of them
[1:08:58] uh they produce many more children than
[1:09:00] that they need you understand what I'm
[1:09:02] saying ain't a father to them you know
[1:09:04] and uh and and they have children by so
[1:09:06] many women and and this and that and
[1:09:08] this and their life is corrupt but we
[1:09:11] put them as a God and we honor that
[1:09:14] instead of honoring God can you say Amen
[1:09:16] we'll go to that instead of the house of
[1:09:19] God hot
[1:09:20] well it just it's just it's mixed up it
[1:09:24] takes the fear of the Lord
[1:09:26] can you say man so so we are to serve
[1:09:30] God not just serve him because if you
[1:09:33] don't have the fear of the Lord you'll
[1:09:35] serve him any old way
[1:09:37] but you serve him having the fear of the
[1:09:41] Lord ain't that right so then in other
[1:09:44] words our service to him is to be done
[1:09:47] in reverence and respect to him our
[1:09:50] obedience to his word is to be done with
[1:09:53] reverence and respect to his word not
[1:09:56] saying well I just I guess I got to do
[1:09:58] it you know I'm a Christian you know
[1:09:59] let's let's just get it over with the
[1:10:01] preacher's gonna you know he he gonna
[1:10:02] preach at me sometime you know if I
[1:10:04] don't do it that that ain't it you've
[1:10:06] got to do it with respect you got to do
[1:10:09] it with reverence
[1:10:11] how you run your house that's your
[1:10:13] problem that's your business but it
[1:10:15] needs to be done with respect it needs
[1:10:18] to be done with rev with reverence unto
[1:10:20] the Lord
[1:10:22] can you say man how you live your life
[1:10:24] that's up to you amen but if you're
[1:10:26] going to serve God do it with reverence
[1:10:29] and respect
[1:10:32] ain't that right so now the scriptures
[1:10:35] tell us the importance of having the
[1:10:38] fear of the Lord look at Proverbs and
[1:10:40] we've read this before but Proverbs 23
[1:10:43] 17 it says let not thine heart Envy
[1:10:46] sinners
[1:10:47] but be thou in the fear of the Lord all
[1:10:51] the day long for surely there is an end
[1:10:54] don't forget that there's an end ain't
[1:10:57] that right there's an end to those that
[1:10:59] are rebellious to God there's an end to
[1:11:01] those that are prospering out in the
[1:11:03] world and ignore God there's an end to
[1:11:05] that basketball player there's an end to
[1:11:07] that golf player there's an end to the
[1:11:09] pornography guys out there there's an
[1:11:12] end to the just the ones that are
[1:11:13] playing Church there's an end to
[1:11:16] everything can you say Amen so don't
[1:11:18] live life thinking that there's not an
[1:11:20] end
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:21] they may be enjoying the prosperity now
[1:11:24] they meet me amen being blessed and and
[1:11:27] prospering in their business and
[1:11:28] ignoring God Amen but there's an end to
[1:11:31] that so don't forget there's an end
[1:11:33] ain't that right whatever you're doing
[1:11:35] today young people there's an end to it
[1:11:38] you're if you want to live for fun and
[1:11:40] all that remember there's an end to that
[1:11:41] so what you want to do is live all your
[1:11:45] days in the fear of the Lord
[1:11:48] amen can you say amen he says seed for
[1:11:51] surely don't don't let nothing heart
[1:11:53] Envy Sinners but be thou in the fear of
[1:11:56] the Lord all the day long for surely
[1:11:58] there is an end and thine expectation
[1:12:01] shall not be cut off
[1:12:04] can you say Amen well how many is
[1:12:06] looking for a coming of the Lord that
[1:12:08] means looking for a body change how many
[1:12:10] is looking for a millennium well don't
[1:12:13] let that expectation be cut off
[1:12:15] can you say Amen there's a lot of people
[1:12:17] that are preaching behind Pulpit saying
[1:12:19] the Lord is coming but they they don't
[1:12:21] reverence God the people don't reverence
[1:12:24] God they just come to church when they
[1:12:25] want to come to church they just live
[1:12:27] their life well however they want to
[1:12:29] without regards to God and say we're
[1:12:31] going to make it but remember their
[1:12:34] expectation will be cut off you've got
[1:12:36] to serve God in the fear of the Lord so
[1:12:40] your expectation don't be cut off
[1:12:44] because there is an end to life
[1:12:46] there's an end to life as you know it
[1:12:48] and we're coming to that end do you
[1:12:50] believe that as we talked about it the
[1:12:52] wrath of God is coming upon this earth
[1:12:54] and the fear the fear is gripping the
[1:12:57] people's hearts amen but you've been
[1:12:59] delivered by that from from that type of
[1:13:01] fear you've been delivered to where
[1:13:03] you're not afraid of Tamara you've been
[1:13:05] delivered for the fact that you're not
[1:13:07] afraid of what laws they pass it doesn't
[1:13:10] matter what the government does it
[1:13:12] doesn't matter what people do let them
[1:13:14] walk away from this message but I will
[1:13:16] fear the lord
[1:13:18] I'm gonna reverence God
[1:13:22] Proverbs 14 26. in the fear of the Lord
[1:13:26] is strong confidence
[1:13:29] when when you have the fear of the Lord
[1:13:32] because you're not serving God God is
[1:13:35] not an icon to you
[1:13:36] God is something personal
[1:13:39] ain't that right and his children shall
[1:13:42] have a place of Refuge
[1:13:45] and the fear of the Lord is a Fountain
[1:13:46] of Life to depart from the snares of
[1:13:48] death ain't that right
[1:13:51] so the spirit of life then
[1:13:54] if the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of
[1:13:56] Life then the spirit of life
[1:13:59] Works where the fear of the Lord is
[1:14:02] you believe that
[1:14:05] now brother Brown says the reason that
[1:14:07] the spirit is not operating in the
[1:14:09] church the way it is
[1:14:11] uh among these people is because a lot
[1:14:15] of it
[1:14:16] is irreverence
[1:14:18] it's because of irreverence they don't
[1:14:21] respect it see you've got to respect
[1:14:24] anything God sins no matter what it is
[1:14:26] you've got to respect it to get the good
[1:14:29] from it
[1:14:31] you believe that
[1:14:33] you got to respect it
[1:14:37] that's right that's why we got to I'm
[1:14:40] just gonna get off for a moment but
[1:14:41] that's why we got to respect one another
[1:14:44] it's not just oh oh Amos
[1:14:49] you got to bring respect to that
[1:14:51] brother Amos
[1:14:54] ain't that right
[1:14:56] yeah well it's it's just well whole
[1:14:58] Brenda
[1:15:00] no it's sister Brenda
[1:15:03] what what is it it's because there's a
[1:15:06] respect there if there's no respect how
[1:15:08] can they help
[1:15:11] yeah
[1:15:12] ain't that right
[1:15:14] if if if we too busy cutting the body
[1:15:17] down
[1:15:18] that's why brother Branham said you got
[1:15:20] to respect the pastor if he's going to
[1:15:22] help you
[1:15:23] you you just can't walk up and chew him
[1:15:25] out and then expect him to be able to
[1:15:27] help you
[1:15:29] it takes a reverence well that's the
[1:15:31] same way with God
[1:15:33] you just can't just walk any away before
[1:15:36] God
[1:15:40] and expect his help
[1:15:43] The Refuge comes to those that fear the
[1:15:46] lord
[1:15:47] reverence him respect him
[1:15:53] you understand what I'm saying see it's
[1:15:55] constantly always respect reverence
[1:16:00] if if if a church usually if people get
[1:16:03] disgruntled with the church it's because
[1:16:06] somewhere they begin to listen they
[1:16:08] listen to negativity and so long they
[1:16:10] listen to it and allow that to enter
[1:16:12] into their soul into their heart to
[1:16:14] their thoughts and then they begin to
[1:16:16] devalue the things of the church they
[1:16:19] begin to devalue worship they begin to
[1:16:22] devalue the whereas when they you know
[1:16:25] used to first come everything was new
[1:16:27] he's like oh wow this is awesome well
[1:16:30] then let Trials come and let things go
[1:16:33] and let let let us rub shoulders then we
[1:16:35] get to know one another and and we see
[1:16:38] all the upsets and all of that then you
[1:16:40] get to hearing the disgruntled then you
[1:16:42] hear this and you hear that and you hear
[1:16:44] that and if you're not careful you lose
[1:16:46] respect
[1:16:48] then you don't want to come to church
[1:16:50] then it just who cares you know what I'm
[1:16:52] saying that then you look at the
[1:16:54] musicians as well well they're not
[1:16:56] helping you anymore where they used to
[1:16:57] just be able to help you
[1:16:59] you just hear the musicians and wow just
[1:17:02] so bless your soul but if you lose the
[1:17:04] respect
[1:17:06] if you lose that reverence
[1:17:08] you understand what I'm saying well that
[1:17:10] that's the same way with anything amen
[1:17:13] and this is why we've got to keep that
[1:17:15] respect and that reverence and and and
[1:17:18] and then we want to live right so that
[1:17:21] we people can reverence
[1:17:24] people can respect but the problem is
[1:17:27] today is people got so Twisted that they
[1:17:30] call evil good and good evil
[1:17:33] so they respect the wrong things
[1:17:38] and disrespect the wrong things
[1:17:42] so now Hebrews 2 and 1 Paul would tell
[1:17:45] us we ought to give the more Earnest
[1:17:48] Heat to the things which we have heard
[1:17:50] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:17:54] ain't that right see so so then we we
[1:17:58] find that the natural church has let it
[1:18:02] slip
[1:18:03] they've let what God has done in this
[1:18:06] age let it slip
[1:18:09] can you say Amen Why by not respecting
[1:18:12] it like they should
[1:18:14] God has sent the greatest Revival here
[1:18:17] on the earth that has ever been known in
[1:18:20] this age but they've let it slip every
[1:18:23] time that God would send a Revival in
[1:18:25] each age they've let it slip by them
[1:18:28] Luther let it slip Wesley let it slip
[1:18:32] Pentecost let it slip can you say man
[1:18:34] what happens they've left the
[1:18:36] supernatural slit by them they've let
[1:18:38] the move of God slit by them they've let
[1:18:41] everything that God is slit by them with
[1:18:44] because they didn't respect it they
[1:18:46] didn't reverence amen it become common
[1:18:48] to them
[1:18:49] look at the healing campaigns it becomes
[1:18:52] so common to the people today that
[1:18:54] they've let it slip
[1:18:57] and you say Amen brother Branham even
[1:18:59] says that we've seen so much of the
[1:19:01] goodness of God till it's become common
[1:19:03] to us we just don't respect it like we
[1:19:06] should church I want to tell you don't
[1:19:09] let this message become common to you
[1:19:11] it's the greatest thing it's the thing
[1:19:14] that's going to get you in a Rapture
[1:19:16] it's the thing that you need for a body
[1:19:19] change
[1:19:20] don't let every service become common to
[1:19:23] you don't let the message become common
[1:19:25] don't let the quotes become common now
[1:19:28] it's to the point that the preacher's
[1:19:30] the same well we don't need to read
[1:19:31] quotes anymore you know we got God and
[1:19:33] it's just all you know it's just
[1:19:35] whatever church I would rather read you
[1:19:38] quotes and let you know where it come
[1:19:41] from and let you know I'm smack dab in
[1:19:44] the message of the hour then you don't
[1:19:47] even wonder where I'm standing at
[1:19:49] can you say Amen why because I want your
[1:19:52] faith to be angered in what God has said
[1:19:55] in this day
[1:19:57] and we've got to respect it
[1:20:00] can you say man
[1:20:02] we got to respect it and so now notice
[1:20:06] our opening scripture says the fear of
[1:20:08] the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
[1:20:12] so look at knowledge it's the fact or
[1:20:15] condition of knowing something with
[1:20:17] familiarity gain through experience or
[1:20:20] Association
[1:20:21] the fact or condition of being aware of
[1:20:24] something that's what knowledge is is
[1:20:26] you become aware of something the range
[1:20:30] of one's information or understanding
[1:20:32] the circumstance or condition of
[1:20:36] apprehending Truth
[1:20:39] ain't that right the act or state of
[1:20:42] knowing
[1:20:43] see so so that I I hope it's getting to
[1:20:47] you amen but our understanding see of
[1:20:51] Truth brings the fear of the Lord
[1:20:54] ain't that right are being aware of of
[1:20:57] something brings see it's a knowledge
[1:21:00] that's what knowledge is see the act of
[1:21:02] knowing having a clear perception of
[1:21:05] fact truth or Duty certain apprehension
[1:21:09] so this is what the fear of the Lord
[1:21:13] comes by knowledge ain't that right now
[1:21:17] if if uh I know here lately I've been
[1:21:19] having you turn but if you'd like to
[1:21:21] turn with me uh uh to Isaiah 6 and 1 and
[1:21:25] and I'm going to try to hurry uh uh but
[1:21:28] but I would like for you to read this
[1:21:30] with me
[1:21:31] um
[1:21:32] and you could read the rest of the the
[1:21:35] the chapter when you get home but Isaiah
[1:21:38] 6 and 1.
[1:21:41] when you're there Say Amen
[1:21:46] most of us
[1:21:47] so in in the year that King Uzziah died
[1:21:50] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:21:54] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:21:57] filled the temple what a knowledge of
[1:22:00] God
[1:22:02] man he didn't see his knowledge of God
[1:22:05] his perception of God the knowledge that
[1:22:09] came to him was that he was he reigned
[1:22:12] that he was over all that he was a
[1:22:14] conqueror that he was mighty can you say
[1:22:17] Amen
[1:22:18] and and he's sitting upon a throne high
[1:22:21] and lifted up and his train filled the
[1:22:24] temple above it stood the seraphims each
[1:22:26] one had six wings with Twain he covered
[1:22:29] his faith with Twain he covered his feet
[1:22:31] and with Twain he did fly and one Cried
[1:22:35] unto another and said holy holy holy is
[1:22:39] the Lord of hosts the whole earth is
[1:22:42] full of his glory amen now notice these
[1:22:46] seraphims amen uh uh uh what what were
[1:22:49] they doing they had wings at the two
[1:22:52] Wings they covered their face in the
[1:22:54] presence of God and two Wings they
[1:22:56] covered their feet in the presence of
[1:22:59] God Amen see they knew they were in his
[1:23:04] presence
[1:23:05] can you say Amen they were in his
[1:23:08] presence now Isaiah is now having this
[1:23:11] knowledge that he is in the presence of
[1:23:14] God Amen and so notice and see they had
[1:23:17] the knowledge of being in his presence
[1:23:19] and it caused them to cover their faces
[1:23:25] it caused them to cover their feet
[1:23:29] can you say man these creatures that did
[1:23:32] not know what sin was that they ain't
[1:23:34] sinners
[1:23:37] and and yet standing in the presence of
[1:23:41] holy deity
[1:23:43] a God that reigned Over All
[1:23:48] sinless creatures and yet they would
[1:23:50] cover their face and their feet
[1:23:54] and the prophet says what was it
[1:23:56] they were doing it in humility in
[1:23:58] reverence to him respect unto him
[1:24:02] can you say man
[1:24:03] the prophet said see we don't have
[1:24:05] anything to cover it's all we've got we
[1:24:07] don't have wings to cover ourselves but
[1:24:10] he said we got the blood
[1:24:12] and it covers Us that we could come into
[1:24:15] His presence
[1:24:16] oh my it's greater than just Wings it's
[1:24:20] the thing that makes us holy in his
[1:24:23] presence it makes us able to come into
[1:24:25] His presence and then he says see we
[1:24:27] ain't got those wings he said but we bow
[1:24:30] our head at his feet we bow our heads
[1:24:34] and pray in reverence and respect can
[1:24:37] you say Amen everything we do it's in
[1:24:40] reverence and respect humbly bowing
[1:24:43] before him why we have this knowledge
[1:24:46] that he's not dead he's not a god of
[1:24:49] history but he's now made known to us
[1:24:52] and this is what Isaiah said when he
[1:24:55] come into the presence and he
[1:24:56] acknowledged this all of a sudden it
[1:24:59] brought a response whoa it's me for I am
[1:25:02] a man of unclean lips and I live among a
[1:25:05] people of unclean lips can you say amen
[1:25:08] amen see and so that's what happened
[1:25:10] when he come when his knowledge came to
[1:25:14] him that he was in the presence of all
[1:25:16] almighty God when Moses had the
[1:25:19] knowledge that he was standing in the
[1:25:21] presence of God he took off his shoes
[1:25:23] for he knew that he was standing on Holy
[1:25:27] Ground brother Brown said see it just
[1:25:29] showed you got to do something when
[1:25:30] you're in his presence you just can't
[1:25:32] stay this way people can't stare again
[1:25:35] people can't stay mad people can't stay
[1:25:38] bitter amen when they really can
[1:25:41] acknowledge that he's in their pres his
[1:25:44] presence when they're in his presence
[1:25:47] and they know it they they really have
[1:25:49] that understanding that knowledge it
[1:25:51] brings a reverence it brings an awe it
[1:25:53] brings a something there can you say man
[1:25:57] I thought when the light a man which was
[1:26:00] none other than Jesus admit Paul when he
[1:26:04] was on his way to the smash Damascus
[1:26:06] Paul fell on the ground
[1:26:08] amen and he fell on his face amen uh in
[1:26:13] respects to God the prophet said amen
[1:26:16] because he realized he wasn't just in
[1:26:18] the presence of something mighty man
[1:26:20] amen he was in the presence of almighty
[1:26:23] God
[1:26:24] when John the Baptist recognized amen
[1:26:27] that who was standing in his presence
[1:26:30] Amen to think of that now to recognize
[1:26:33] that Jesus was God Amen the Lamb of God
[1:26:37] and there he was standing in his
[1:26:39] presence John would even say I'm not
[1:26:41] even worthy to touch his feet I'm not
[1:26:44] even worthy to loosen the sushu latch
[1:26:46] off of his feet amen and yet the feet is
[1:26:49] is is as we know is the dirtiest part
[1:26:51] amen uh uh cause it because they would
[1:26:54] walk and the dust would be on his feet
[1:26:56] and and and and and and and and the dung
[1:26:59] and and all this stuff you know how it
[1:27:01] is it'd be like your shoe you know
[1:27:03] walking into a men's bathroom and
[1:27:05] there's you know you don't know what
[1:27:07] you're going to you know it's just the
[1:27:09] uh the stench and the and and all that
[1:27:11] nasty stuff well and yet John would look
[1:27:14] at that and say but I'm not even worthy
[1:27:16] to touch his feet something that's dirty
[1:27:18] something that is you understand what
[1:27:20] I'm saying amen and brother Brown said
[1:27:22] it showed a reverence that John toward
[1:27:25] him it showed a humility that God that
[1:27:28] John would show it showed that he had a
[1:27:30] knowledge of who was standing before him
[1:27:34] can you say Amen it was that John says
[1:27:37] who no no I ain't gonna touch this feet
[1:27:38] no he says I'm not worthy to touch it
[1:27:42] amen
[1:27:46] Hallelujah
[1:27:54] brother Branham he said be conscious of
[1:27:57] your littleness
[1:28:00] if you want to get somewhere with God
[1:28:02] make yourself real little
[1:28:08] don't make yourself big like King Uzziah
[1:28:11] remember
[1:28:12] he started out small and God blessed him
[1:28:15] but then he got big in his own mind he'd
[1:28:17] become a legend
[1:28:19] in his own mind
[1:28:23] to where he tried to take The Minister's
[1:28:25] place
[1:28:27] and brother Bram talked about that these
[1:28:29] businessmen that tried to take a
[1:28:30] Minister's place
[1:28:31] they're so big
[1:28:33] they're so successful in business that
[1:28:35] they think they can run a church
[1:28:37] tell the pastor what to do tell a
[1:28:39] preacher what to do
[1:28:41] you happen that happens a lot
[1:28:44] hello
[1:28:46] but don't make yourself
[1:28:48] big
[1:28:51] brother the Brian said he uziah thought
[1:28:53] he was too important to listen to the
[1:28:54] the minister
[1:28:56] brother Brown said you correct people
[1:28:58] about something or tell them about their
[1:29:00] wrongdoing they'll leave the church
[1:29:02] and isn't that about the way it is today
[1:29:03] you tell them you rebuke it you you talk
[1:29:06] about the situation you correct it and
[1:29:08] they'll just flat leave it's become a
[1:29:10] smorgasbord today
[1:29:15] and and so
[1:29:17] brother Brown says see they won't go
[1:29:19] tell somebody tell tell women they
[1:29:20] shouldn't you know wear short hair
[1:29:23] well I'll just go somewhere where they
[1:29:25] can where I can wear it see
[1:29:27] no respect no reverence
[1:29:30] right
[1:29:31] brother Brown said a big man humbles
[1:29:33] himself
[1:29:34] so he said make yourself little
[1:29:38] can you say that with me make yourself
[1:29:39] little
[1:29:41] and God will exalt you
[1:29:44] see but he that exalts himself shall be
[1:29:47] made a base
[1:29:48] will be brought low ain't that right so
[1:29:51] brother Brown said always be little
[1:29:55] ain't that Ryan he said don't be the big
[1:29:57] shot
[1:29:58] be the little fella
[1:30:01] right be the little fella
[1:30:05] now you have to do this to serve the
[1:30:08] Lord
[1:30:09] because you you don't serve God for gain
[1:30:12] I don't Pastor here for popularity
[1:30:15] I don't I don't don't you don't you when
[1:30:17] you sing you you shouldn't sing to get
[1:30:20] Praises of the people
[1:30:22] right and when we clap we're not
[1:30:25] praising you at all we're praising God
[1:30:27] for sending a talent to us to be a
[1:30:29] blessing to us
[1:30:31] you understand what I'm saying we're not
[1:30:33] here to just say oh Ben our band is
[1:30:36] great no no even though I I think
[1:30:39] everyone should play their be their best
[1:30:41] if you're going to be on the platform be
[1:30:43] your best I mean work together be be
[1:30:46] your best because that's what God made
[1:30:48] us to be right if you're going if you're
[1:30:50] going to do your job do do your job
[1:30:52] right be your best I think Billy Paul
[1:30:55] says the dad told him so if you're gonna
[1:30:56] if you if you know if you if you if
[1:30:58] you're gonna be a bum then be the best
[1:31:00] bum that that ever was and never work a
[1:31:03] day in your life be the best bum so you
[1:31:06] know if you're going to be a uh if
[1:31:08] you're going to be a good be a husband
[1:31:09] be the best you're gonna be a wife be
[1:31:11] the best if you're going to be a child
[1:31:13] well you can't help but be a child but
[1:31:15] be the best
[1:31:17] right we won't be the best preachers we
[1:31:20] want to be the best day manners we want
[1:31:22] to be the best Christians we want to be
[1:31:24] the best deacons we want to be whatever
[1:31:26] we are let's be the best
[1:31:28] but be little
[1:31:31] be little
[1:31:32] can you say Amen be the little guy amen
[1:31:36] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:31:37] God is the only one that's big anyhow
[1:31:39] ain't that right but now notice now and
[1:31:42] it takes the fear of the Lord to do this
[1:31:44] now see so this age is fulfilling the
[1:31:47] prophecy in second Timothy 3 2 for men
[1:31:50] shall be lovers of their own selves so
[1:31:53] then it's not in this age it's not in
[1:31:56] the people of this age to be lit to be
[1:31:58] the little fella because they're lovers
[1:32:00] of their own selves they and and and
[1:32:02] here in the fourth verse lovers of
[1:32:04] pleasure more than lovers of God so that
[1:32:06] they're actually everything that is
[1:32:08] appeasing to them that's what is good
[1:32:11] that that is what they worship amen they
[1:32:13] ain't got time to reverence God they
[1:32:15] ain't got time amen uh for the things of
[1:32:18] God and and to put the the priorities in
[1:32:21] in in their right perspective ain't that
[1:32:23] right amen see and and and it's coming
[1:32:26] to the point and we're here where
[1:32:28] there's so many excuses and Jesus said
[1:32:30] it would come that the invitation would
[1:32:32] begin given out but everybody would have
[1:32:34] an excuse as to why they couldn't come
[1:32:36] I've got this I've got that I got to do
[1:32:38] that why it fits what it is lovers of
[1:32:40] pleasure more than lovers of God lovers
[1:32:42] of their own self more than lovers of
[1:32:44] God ain't that right but in the middle
[1:32:46] of all of this there is a people that's
[1:32:49] willing to bear his reproach there is a
[1:32:52] people that's willing to belittle amen
[1:32:54] and that's the only way that you can
[1:32:56] really serve God is because service to
[1:32:59] God is doing what he wants you to do
[1:33:02] not what the people want you to do not
[1:33:04] what your wife not what your husband not
[1:33:06] what your children not what anybody else
[1:33:08] wants to do you and God and God Alone
[1:33:11] ain't that right you're willing to
[1:33:13] sacrifice your time you're willing to
[1:33:15] sacrifice your pride you're willing to
[1:33:17] sacrifice your own ideas about it you're
[1:33:19] willing to sacrifice everything there is
[1:33:21] Amen to please God and then you have to
[1:33:25] have the fear of the Lord to do such
[1:33:29] is this all right
[1:33:31] but see today there's no reverence to
[1:33:34] God brother Brown said it seems that it
[1:33:35] seems to be that people can just do
[1:33:37] anything in the name of the Lord and get
[1:33:38] by with it
[1:33:40] and boy ain't that the truth
[1:33:42] and and what happens and brother Brown
[1:33:44] says it and while they're doing this
[1:33:46] they'll split a church and keep strong
[1:33:48] influence
[1:33:49] they'll keep their influence strong
[1:33:52] among the people no matter what they do
[1:33:57] why because people don't have the fear
[1:33:59] of the Lord anymore
[1:34:02] true
[1:34:04] he said they keep a strong influence no
[1:34:06] matter what they do against the
[1:34:07] principles of God he said we just take
[1:34:09] the name of God and use it any use it
[1:34:12] anyway prophesy in it when means when it
[1:34:16] means nothing but some kind of carnal
[1:34:18] influence and so forth and say things
[1:34:20] that never happen and act and and and
[1:34:23] act like it you know he says we we never
[1:34:26] pay attention people never pay attention
[1:34:29] I've thought of all the prophecies that
[1:34:31] go forth in in the world today that
[1:34:33] don't mean a squat
[1:34:38] that ain't got no bearing whatsoever on
[1:34:40] anything
[1:34:46] but because people don't have the fear
[1:34:48] of the Lord to say hold it
[1:34:50] you represent my God that way
[1:34:53] my God that has an infinite knowledge
[1:34:55] that don't have to guess they don't have
[1:34:58] to beat around the bush
[1:35:01] amen hello
[1:35:04] that is so accurate he can tell you your
[1:35:06] name your address tell you what you just
[1:35:08] prayed this morning
[1:35:11] right
[1:35:13] but then because some guy gets up and
[1:35:15] says oh someone's got heart problem
[1:35:17] someone going through a trial here this
[1:35:19] morning
[1:35:21] hello I could do that I could call every
[1:35:23] one of you young people out
[1:35:27] and say you got issues in your life
[1:35:28] you're struggling with things
[1:35:32] let me
[1:35:35] no one holds it responsible
[1:35:38] well anyone can do that
[1:35:41] hello
[1:35:43] just a small group right here
[1:35:46] there's illnesses
[1:35:48] there's things you're struggling with
[1:35:49] there's discouragements
[1:35:52] there's nothing you can pick that stuff
[1:35:54] up
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:58] but brother Bill if I told you well you
[1:36:01] know you you went to the heart doctor uh
[1:36:04] uh Friday at one o'clock
[1:36:08] and the doctor told you you're gonna die
[1:36:10] by Tuesday
[1:36:15] well now that's either facts or what is
[1:36:17] it
[1:36:20] right
[1:36:22] so now he would have it was him
[1:36:25] you know now now if I was a real bold
[1:36:27] I'd say raise your hand up and let the
[1:36:28] people know that that's right isn't that
[1:36:30] what brother Brandon done raise your
[1:36:31] hand let everybody know that that's
[1:36:33] right
[1:36:34] he wanted them to witness that what was
[1:36:37] just said was the truth
[1:36:39] ain't that right
[1:36:40] but now if I really don't know that and
[1:36:42] I'm just running and just just just
[1:36:44] whatever I ain't gonna ask you for
[1:36:46] nothing to witness but I guarantee you
[1:36:49] somebody should
[1:36:51] you older brother Bill afterward and say
[1:36:52] was that right
[1:36:54] why because it was so descriptive that
[1:36:58] it was either right or wrong
[1:37:02] ain't that right
[1:37:04] so so we find that he says we can just
[1:37:07] take the name of God and use it in any
[1:37:09] way prophesy in it when it means nothing
[1:37:12] but just some kind of carnal influence
[1:37:14] and so forth and say things that never
[1:37:16] happen and act like he'd never he said
[1:37:19] never pay attention any attention to it
[1:37:21] see now another place he says see these
[1:37:23] no reverence no respects the people
[1:37:25] today they don't respect God they have
[1:37:27] no reverence they take his name in vain
[1:37:29] they tell the dirty jokes and even
[1:37:31] ministers do that you hear a joke I
[1:37:34] guess you know would be all right but
[1:37:36] the minister should be examples I think
[1:37:38] of what righteousness and Holiness is
[1:37:40] see that's the reason I think maybe we
[1:37:42] don't get no further than what we do see
[1:37:44] uh uh we're not don't come this well
[1:37:47] that with sincerity that we ought to
[1:37:49] have in it when you're carrying on and
[1:37:51] going on you lose that little grain of
[1:37:53] sincerity you know see there's something
[1:37:56] about that see you must remember that
[1:37:58] God is watching you every hour he
[1:38:01] watches you when you're asleep now I
[1:38:03] think the reason that people do those
[1:38:05] things is because they're not conscience
[1:38:07] of his presence
[1:38:09] are you with me now they're not
[1:38:11] conscience of his presence that's why
[1:38:13] they allow things to go on that's why
[1:38:15] they'll watch television and allow
[1:38:17] things to come into there out of that
[1:38:19] television that's against God and
[1:38:21] there's nothing there to condemn them
[1:38:25] is because they're not conscience of
[1:38:27] God's presence no more
[1:38:29] hey that's watching on on the on the
[1:38:32] YouTube or anything else
[1:38:35] and you say Amen see they're not
[1:38:36] conscience of his presence but yet he is
[1:38:39] there where where whether you think he
[1:38:41] is or not he looks at he he sees every
[1:38:43] look that you make every move that you
[1:38:46] make he knows all about it but we ought
[1:38:49] to realize that you're with me now we
[1:38:52] ought to realize this see we used to
[1:38:54] have a little song when I first come
[1:38:56] among the Pentecostals they sang All
[1:38:58] Along the road to the soul true Souls
[1:39:02] true Abode there's an eye watching you I
[1:39:04] sing in a sister Hannah a man haven't
[1:39:06] seen that I miss her singing uh that
[1:39:08] song every step that you take this great
[1:39:11] eye is awake there is an eye watching
[1:39:13] you he said see he says now that is true
[1:39:16] God's omnipresence knows what you're
[1:39:19] doing and even your thoughts one time he
[1:39:22] says while I was in a vision I was
[1:39:24] speaking to a being standing by me and
[1:39:26] he said back he said your thoughts are
[1:39:28] louder in the heaven than your voice is
[1:39:30] on Earth he knows what you're thinking
[1:39:32] you might say uh you you might say you
[1:39:36] do this and you do that and it see but
[1:39:38] you see down in your heart if you
[1:39:41] thinking different you're doing
[1:39:42] something wrong see you should be he
[1:39:45] said you should just uh uh you should be
[1:39:49] just what you are see the heart the
[1:39:51] mouth should speak what's in the heart
[1:39:53] and so we find that the people doesn't
[1:39:55] realize the presence of God he said you
[1:39:58] know they ought to be like David the man
[1:40:00] uh was after God's Own Heart and he said
[1:40:03] the Lord is always before me can you say
[1:40:07] that with me the Lord is always before
[1:40:10] me
[1:40:12] that's why we should pray on our
[1:40:14] business that's why we should pray and
[1:40:16] what we're going to do tomorrow that's
[1:40:17] why we should ask God's blessings upon
[1:40:19] what we do
[1:40:21] can you say Amen the Lord is always
[1:40:24] before me wherever he goes he remembers
[1:40:27] God is always before him he is on my
[1:40:30] right hand and I'll not be moved because
[1:40:33] God is on my on his right hand ain't
[1:40:36] that right see so then the world today
[1:40:39] now is not conscience of the presence of
[1:40:42] the Lord but we find that God wants to
[1:40:45] teach knowledge how many believes that
[1:40:46] God wants the people to have his
[1:40:49] knowledge or to have knowledge Isaiah
[1:40:51] 28-9 he asked the question Whom Shall he
[1:40:55] teach knowledge ain't that right amen so
[1:40:58] that means there's going to be a scarce
[1:41:00] people people that would be scarcely
[1:41:02] amen that he can teach knowledge to
[1:41:05] ain't that right why the prophet said
[1:41:08] because they got their own theological
[1:41:10] experiences and things to rely on they
[1:41:12] won't go back to the word of God see the
[1:41:15] knowledge that God teaches is from the
[1:41:17] word of God it doesn't come from a
[1:41:19] textbook it doesn't come from some
[1:41:22] Theory it doesn't come from some
[1:41:24] Theologian or seminary it comes from the
[1:41:27] word of God
[1:41:29] now we find Proverbs 1 29 uh tells us of
[1:41:34] a people that hated knowledge
[1:41:36] they hated knowledge and did not choose
[1:41:39] the fear of the Lord ain't that right
[1:41:42] so to reject knowledge is to not choose
[1:41:46] the fear of the Lord now if if you allow
[1:41:49] me just a little bit more time it's not
[1:41:51] that people today hate all knowledge
[1:41:55] they they don't hate all knowledge it's
[1:41:57] just a certain kind of knowledge they
[1:41:59] hate
[1:42:00] uh uh this knowledge and and and and yet
[1:42:03] the knowledge that they hate is what
[1:42:04] brings the fear of the Lord uh uh but
[1:42:07] let's look at it Daniel 12 and 4 for
[1:42:09] foretold of this day say
[1:42:14] be increased when at the time of the end
[1:42:18] how many believes we're here we're at
[1:42:20] the time of the end and he says
[1:42:21] knowledge shall be increased amen but
[1:42:25] see this knowledge comes from the the
[1:42:28] tree of knowledge uh which Adam and Eve
[1:42:31] partook of in the Garden of Eden ain't
[1:42:34] that right brother Brown said it's a
[1:42:35] worldly knowledge and not a Godly
[1:42:38] knowledge ain't that right now in second
[1:42:42] Timothy three and seven Paul foretold of
[1:42:45] this day saying that the people would be
[1:42:48] ever learning ain't that right and yet
[1:42:51] never able to come to the
[1:42:54] knowledge of Truth ain't that right so
[1:42:58] they're getting a knowledge they're
[1:43:00] learning they're ever learning amen but
[1:43:03] they're not able to come to the
[1:43:05] knowledge of Truth in this age we got
[1:43:08] more seminaries than ever before we got
[1:43:10] more colleges than ever before
[1:43:12] universities than ever before we got
[1:43:14] Christian and secular schools colleges
[1:43:17] uh uh universities and all that then
[1:43:20] education is being promoted amen like
[1:43:24] never before amen it's it's this age and
[1:43:28] then we got you know the seminaries that
[1:43:30] that are everywhere and yet their
[1:43:32] knowledge is a Baptist knowledge a
[1:43:34] Pentecostal knowledge a presbyterian
[1:43:37] knowledge it's a knowledge that they're
[1:43:39] gaining amen but yet in this age of ever
[1:43:42] learning they're never able to come to
[1:43:46] the knowledge of Truth
[1:43:49] can you say man so it's not just any
[1:43:52] knowledge that we're after we want the
[1:43:54] knowledge of Truth and if you can get
[1:43:56] the knowledge of truth it's a grace to
[1:43:58] you
[1:44:01] ain't that right
[1:44:03] now so this this layout of sin Church
[1:44:05] age is filled with Pentecostal knowledge
[1:44:09] but if you notice none of their
[1:44:10] knowledge brings the fear of the Lord
[1:44:14] that's right if they get if they had the
[1:44:16] fear of the Lord they'd depart from them
[1:44:17] denominations
[1:44:19] can you say man if they had the fear of
[1:44:22] the Lord they would they would take a
[1:44:23] prophet's message of what the prophet
[1:44:25] said in this age that's right if they
[1:44:27] had the fear of the Lord they'd come to
[1:44:29] the knowledge of Truth it would show
[1:44:30] that they would come to the knowledge of
[1:44:32] Truth and they wouldn't preach uh
[1:44:34] tongues as the evidence of the Holy
[1:44:36] Ghost
[1:44:37] can you say man they wouldn't be
[1:44:39] baptizing in Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:44:41] they they they they would they would
[1:44:43] look at what the truth is and
[1:44:45] acknowledge that truth and uh and say
[1:44:47] yes I'm aware of that and it would bring
[1:44:49] the fear of the Lord to them
[1:44:52] ain't that right that how many women are
[1:44:54] preachers today
[1:44:56] because they're ever learning but never
[1:44:58] coming to the knowledge of Truth
[1:45:00] yet the Bible Still Remains the Same
[1:45:02] that a woman is not to preach
[1:45:05] can you say man and we've got it all in
[1:45:07] our Pentecostal ranks Amen in the
[1:45:09] Pentecostal ranks uh uh uh where the
[1:45:12] women are allowed to preach but the
[1:45:14] Bible says the knowledge of Truth says
[1:45:16] don't do it and if a woman had that
[1:45:19] knowledge of Truth it would bring the
[1:45:21] fear of the Lord
[1:45:23] in reverence and respect
[1:45:25] ain't that right now look at look at
[1:45:28] this what what is the knowledge that God
[1:45:31] has been trying to teach the people
[1:45:34] in Jesus day he had three pools
[1:45:37] the first pull of his ministry was
[1:45:39] Healing The Sick
[1:45:40] second pull of his ministry was the
[1:45:42] prophecy that went forth Prophet said
[1:45:45] when he revealed the secrets of the uh
[1:45:47] that was in the people's hearts ain't
[1:45:49] that right now these two first two pools
[1:45:51] everybody loved everybody followed
[1:45:53] everybody amen gathered around ain't
[1:45:56] that right
[1:45:57] amen see so brother Brown said the first
[1:45:59] the first pull was Healing The Sick the
[1:46:02] second pool was rebuking the
[1:46:03] organizations and prophesying what they
[1:46:06] had done what they were what was coming
[1:46:07] what is what what what will come what
[1:46:10] was see and all these things that's what
[1:46:13] he'd done but then he began his third
[1:46:16] pull and what was the third pull him
[1:46:19] revealing himself as to who he was see
[1:46:23] healing was for one thing amen but we
[1:46:26] find out that Satan can impersonate that
[1:46:29] that a man knowledge is is or or uh uh
[1:46:33] the the the second pull was another
[1:46:35] thing a man that even Satan has a lot of
[1:46:39] impersonations through with all of that
[1:46:40] as well but then that third pull God
[1:46:44] would get in part to them a knowledge
[1:46:46] that was a mystery remember they had he
[1:46:49] asked him you know he asked him who do
[1:46:51] men say that I have the son of man and
[1:46:52] there were people all around guessing as
[1:46:54] to who he was ain't that right he was a
[1:46:57] mystery
[1:46:59] he was a mystery to the people we know
[1:47:02] that thou are a man come from God for no
[1:47:04] man can do these things but they could
[1:47:06] not point the fact that he was God
[1:47:10] so now he began to that third pull to
[1:47:13] reveal to give and impart a knowledge
[1:47:15] that God was not in heaven God was among
[1:47:18] them
[1:47:20] he that has seen me has seen the father
[1:47:23] oh man
[1:47:26] ain't that right he was imparting a
[1:47:28] knowledge to them
[1:47:33] uh Prophet said Jesus was wonderful and
[1:47:36] when he went in the church and healed
[1:47:37] the people and everything but when he
[1:47:39] sat down one day and said I am my father
[1:47:41] a one oh that did it lest you eat the
[1:47:44] Flesh of the son of man and drink his
[1:47:45] blood you have no life in you he didn't
[1:47:47] explain it he wanted to see who would
[1:47:49] stand by him now that's where the fear
[1:47:52] of the Lord would come right who those
[1:47:54] who would take that knowledge and
[1:47:56] understand that knowledge and apprehend
[1:47:57] that knowledge it would bring the fear
[1:47:59] of the Lord
[1:48:01] oh John the Baptist had it
[1:48:04] right he said I ain't even worthy to
[1:48:07] losing his shoe latch touch his feet
[1:48:09] right but look look look look look at
[1:48:11] what the soldiers done they spit on him
[1:48:13] slapped him why two different knowledges
[1:48:20] see now notice another place brother
[1:48:22] Brown said see he didn't explain it they
[1:48:25] had already seen the manifestation the
[1:48:28] Vindication of the word of God for his
[1:48:30] age made real and proved to them that he
[1:48:34] was that messenger of the age
[1:48:37] he had done it he had done the signs he
[1:48:39] had showed that he was the Messiah by
[1:48:41] his word now he's going to tell them I
[1:48:44] am he
[1:48:48] right
[1:48:50] and guess what everyone left
[1:48:53] but his disciples
[1:48:55] and he didn't begged them to stay
[1:48:57] he just said will you go also but what
[1:49:00] did Peter say where could we go
[1:49:04] why he had already had a revelation that
[1:49:07] he was the Christ
[1:49:09] and he's saying where could we go for
[1:49:11] thou Hast the words of eternal life
[1:49:13] there was something that brought a fear
[1:49:17] of the Lord to them
[1:49:20] they didn't understand everything
[1:49:22] but the knowledge that they had
[1:49:25] of him being God
[1:49:31] what else did Jesus teach them
[1:49:33] Matthew 12 42 the queen of the South
[1:49:36] Jesus said shall rise up in the Judgment
[1:49:39] with this generation and shall condemn
[1:49:42] it for she came from the uttermost parts
[1:49:44] of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[1:49:46] solemn Solomon and behold a greater
[1:49:50] then Solomon is here ain't that right
[1:49:54] now I got to tell you church he that is
[1:49:57] greater than Solomon has come in this
[1:49:59] age
[1:50:00] do you believe that
[1:50:02] what a knowledge
[1:50:05] it wasn't a preacher that just called me
[1:50:07] it wasn't just a teacher that just come
[1:50:09] he that is greater than Solomon has come
[1:50:12] to us in this age
[1:50:14] and this same knowledge that Jesus
[1:50:16] imparted to them has been imparted to
[1:50:19] you and I
[1:50:21] ain't that right brother Brown said see
[1:50:23] when I'm standing here see my Ministry
[1:50:25] is different is a different Ministry
[1:50:27] from a pastor or a teacher for my
[1:50:30] Ministry is to declare him that he is
[1:50:33] here
[1:50:35] then you say man see it wasn't just to
[1:50:37] give you a little Bible Lesson his
[1:50:39] ministry was to declare he is here and
[1:50:42] every person that preaches this message
[1:50:44] is the same Ministry to declare that
[1:50:47] he's still here among the people
[1:50:51] can you say Amen see we have the
[1:50:54] knowledge it's a knowledge that he is
[1:50:56] here
[1:50:57] we weren't just given a Bible lesson
[1:50:59] it's a knowledge
[1:51:01] that would bring the fear of the Lord to
[1:51:04] us
[1:51:05] ain't that right see we have seen the
[1:51:08] Messiah sign
[1:51:09] we have seen his presence being
[1:51:12] Vindicated here
[1:51:14] even science vindicates it their
[1:51:17] technology
[1:51:18] and God didn't have his own elect take
[1:51:20] that picture he had his enemy take that
[1:51:22] picture
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:25] ain't that right
[1:51:26] so see we we find that when Jesus was
[1:51:29] here on Earth what did he drive what
[1:51:31] knowledge did he try to impart God was
[1:51:33] in flesh
[1:51:35] he was God in flesh
[1:51:39] he declared that he and the father were
[1:51:41] one
[1:51:42] ain't that right he showed them the
[1:51:45] Messiah sign he fulfilled every
[1:51:47] scripture that spoke of the Messiah
[1:51:49] brother Bradham says see uh uh if I can
[1:51:52] see he says Jesus brought God to human
[1:51:54] lives God was made human you believe
[1:51:57] that see when Jesus was born God became
[1:52:00] man that he might become fellowship with
[1:52:02] man and in man to achieve one purpose
[1:52:06] and that is to bring man uh uh to what
[1:52:10] God is say that again to bring man to
[1:52:13] what God is ain't that right now what
[1:52:16] did we do when we see Jesus we saw the
[1:52:19] supernatural God made manifest who else
[1:52:22] could walk on water who else could turn
[1:52:24] water into wine who else amen could
[1:52:26] could uh uh tell a person where they
[1:52:28] were and what they had done and what the
[1:52:30] what was in their past life and all of
[1:52:32] these things who else could do that but
[1:52:34] God
[1:52:35] Jesus brought God to man
[1:52:40] ain't that right what a knowledge
[1:52:44] he said see
[1:52:45] Jesus was born God became man that he
[1:52:48] might become fellowship with man and in
[1:52:51] man to achieve one purpose and that is
[1:52:53] to bring man to what uh bring to man
[1:52:56] what God is not what a church is but
[1:52:58] what God is get your eyes off of a
[1:53:01] church get your eyes off the
[1:53:02] denomination get your eyes off of some
[1:53:04] theory of man get your eyes on God can
[1:53:07] you say Amen well that's what he wanted
[1:53:09] that's why Jesus came amen and revealed
[1:53:12] the supernatural among them people was
[1:53:15] to get their eyes off their Fellowship
[1:53:17] card and their Creeds and their dogmas
[1:53:19] and their formalism to where they could
[1:53:21] see a supernatural God again among them
[1:53:24] you believe that what a knowledge
[1:53:27] amen not what a church is but what God
[1:53:29] is Jesus came that he might present God
[1:53:32] to man and man didn't want it
[1:53:36] they hate that knowledge
[1:53:40] ain't that right
[1:53:41] now notice John 10 and 32 I'm going to
[1:53:44] wrap it up but you bear with me now and
[1:53:47] Jesus answered them many good works have
[1:53:50] I showed you from my father for which of
[1:53:53] those Works do you Stone me and the Jews
[1:53:56] answered him saying for a good work we
[1:53:58] Stone thee not but for blasphemy and
[1:54:01] because thou being a man make us thyself
[1:54:05] God
[1:54:06] they hated the knowledge that he was
[1:54:09] trying to give them
[1:54:13] and they crucified him for it
[1:54:16] ain't that right now today this same God
[1:54:19] that lived in a human being Jesus Christ
[1:54:23] has come again today
[1:54:25] you believe that
[1:54:26] where is he at he's made one everybody
[1:54:29] say one
[1:54:31] with his church
[1:54:33] today
[1:54:35] one who's this church
[1:54:38] it's a many-membered body he's become
[1:54:41] one in you
[1:54:44] one in me
[1:54:46] one
[1:54:47] amen
[1:54:49] same Oneness
[1:54:53] God's is able to achieve it
[1:54:55] to Calvary
[1:54:57] do you believe it
[1:54:58] so if he come one again in the church is
[1:55:02] it not our responsibility to bring God
[1:55:04] to man
[1:55:07] to get the world's eyes off of their
[1:55:09] Creeds back to him gone again
[1:55:15] hello
[1:55:16] do you know what the world hates this
[1:55:18] knowledge
[1:55:19] yes brother Brown said see it's usually
[1:55:21] in the nights just maybe the Holy Spirit
[1:55:23] come right Among Us and go to
[1:55:25] manifesting himself making himself known
[1:55:27] among us and then by that I think it's
[1:55:30] real he said when he can maybe in
[1:55:32] sovereignty I can't say now this man or
[1:55:35] this woman or that child seat the holy
[1:55:37] spirit moves out in the building on the
[1:55:40] building and speaks to whomsoever he
[1:55:41] will speak that's Sovereign and then
[1:55:44] that brings the knowledge see because
[1:55:46] it's a promise of God and that brings
[1:55:48] the knowledge of the god Sovereign right
[1:55:51] and also brings his presence down among
[1:55:54] us we should see it and rejoice
[1:56:00] you see where our rejoicing is I know
[1:56:02] the Pentecostals they got their emotions
[1:56:04] and all that this is not an emotional
[1:56:06] High I know people say we're Pentecostal
[1:56:08] and call Brandis Pentecostal it just
[1:56:11] shows ain't seeing what we're excited
[1:56:12] about
[1:56:14] we've seen the Messiah
[1:56:16] we've seen the vision
[1:56:18] we've got a knowledge that is not
[1:56:20] imparted to the Pentecostals
[1:56:22] Presbyterians Baptist or whatever
[1:56:25] there's a knowledge that has been
[1:56:27] imparted that deity is no longer in
[1:56:30] heaven it's in you
[1:56:33] praise the lord it's true
[1:56:39] brother Brown said see Christ never sent
[1:56:41] me to build an organization Christ sent
[1:56:43] me to build individuals
[1:56:45] to the stature of Jesus Christ
[1:56:48] this isn't you just becoming well you
[1:56:51] know I've been in here 15 50 years you
[1:56:53] know I know that Bible back and forth
[1:56:56] I've read it a thousand times
[1:56:59] will be
[1:57:01] if there's not a message to build you to
[1:57:04] the full stature of Jesus Christ
[1:57:07] that's what the message is for
[1:57:12] him
[1:57:13] now notice he said God never sent me to
[1:57:16] build an organization Christ sent me to
[1:57:18] build the individuals to the stature of
[1:57:20] Jesus Christ that they might be the
[1:57:23] PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the
[1:57:26] Spirit by his word
[1:57:30] see by his word build up the individual
[1:57:33] to that place ain't that right another
[1:57:36] place brother Brown said this is the age
[1:57:38] of life
[1:57:40] it's the personal life of Christ the
[1:57:42] chemical of his body what was in him is
[1:57:45] now present today
[1:57:47] he is the sake brother Brown says it he
[1:57:50] is the same in every aspect but his
[1:57:52] Corporal body do you believe that now he
[1:57:55] didn't leave when brother Branham left
[1:57:57] now I understand brother Brenner had a
[1:57:59] special gift and all that and that
[1:58:00] Ministry was to pull us you remember
[1:58:02] that you remember the fishing you know
[1:58:05] the the first pull and and he got that
[1:58:07] little old fish in the second pool there
[1:58:08] was a little old fish he said but it'll
[1:58:11] be that third pool that would catch it
[1:58:12] and it caught the the the rainbow trout
[1:58:15] the world record remember that the big
[1:58:17] old rainbow trout it was the third pool
[1:58:19] that caught you
[1:58:21] you understand what I'm saying what was
[1:58:23] that the revealing of himself the
[1:58:26] revealing of the word now we're seeing
[1:58:27] he is the where it's his life in you the
[1:58:31] mystery that was in the mind of God is
[1:58:33] now imparted to you and it's brought the
[1:58:36] fear of the Lord to us
[1:58:40] our worship is now and under the fear of
[1:58:43] the Lord in reverence
[1:58:44] and respect
[1:58:46] our service to him is now in the fear of
[1:58:48] the Lord
[1:58:50] because we realize we're not just just
[1:58:52] ah church members no we're Sons and
[1:58:55] Daughters of God that deity lives in
[1:58:57] can you say Amen his presence is always
[1:59:00] abiding with us
[1:59:01] do you believe that
[1:59:03] I don't care where you're at he says
[1:59:04] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:59:06] Shadow over death thou art with me
[1:59:08] wherever I am thou art with me why
[1:59:12] you're his Dwelling Place dynamics of
[1:59:15] the Holy Ghost is in you brother Bill
[1:59:17] you're you're not just uh just an
[1:59:19] individual that lives on his watch Ever
[1:59:21] Street and your neighbors just look at
[1:59:22] you as old Bill Papa Bill Grandpa Bill
[1:59:25] Uncle Bill you know and and Father Bill
[1:59:29] or whatever you know and and these
[1:59:31] things no you're a Son of God and God
[1:59:33] has recognized you in this age by him he
[1:59:36] himself coming inside of you now what a
[1:59:39] knowledge that is to and it brings the
[1:59:41] fear of the Lord it brings a reverence
[1:59:43] amen that we want to please him in
[1:59:45] everything we do amen we want that we
[1:59:47] his purpose to be fulfilled in our lives
[1:59:49] in our body we're not just here just
[1:59:52] doing our own thing and and if we don't
[1:59:54] like it we just don't like it we just go
[1:59:56] do something else no we're here to do
[1:59:58] the will of the father we're not here
[2:00:00] for the Pauls of men we're not here for
[2:00:02] the Praises we're not here for the
[2:00:04] accolades we're here for the will of God
[2:00:07] can you say amen and it brings the god
[2:00:10] to the people again
[2:00:13] praise the Lord bless the Lord
[2:00:17] and the world
[2:00:19] hates that knowledge
[2:00:21] because this knowledge comes by
[2:00:22] experience
[2:00:24] and you say man
[2:00:26] if you allow me
[2:00:29] five more minutes
[2:00:31] this tells us that they are anointed
[2:00:33] with the Demonic spirit for Satan hates
[2:00:35] the knowledge of God which is the
[2:00:37] knowledge of Truth
[2:00:39] when you have the knowledge of God see
[2:00:41] then you come to the knowledge of Truth
[2:00:44] right
[2:00:46] see and Satan hates this knowledge
[2:00:48] because then he cannot deceive the
[2:00:50] people
[2:00:51] with his lies
[2:00:54] because the knowledge that they've
[2:00:55] received is truth
[2:00:58] how when you know truth how can you be
[2:01:00] deceived by lies
[2:01:04] ain't that right
[2:01:05] they see God for who he is they see God
[2:01:08] for what he is
[2:01:10] they see that God is not dead He's Alive
[2:01:13] so they don't see him as a god of
[2:01:15] history of what he did they see what
[2:01:17] he's doing
[2:01:18] it even brings it more to the knowledge
[2:01:20] that I am a Son of God that he lives in
[2:01:22] me his grace is with me his anointing is
[2:01:25] with me whether I feel it or not
[2:01:28] it comes by knowledge of Truth
[2:01:31] right
[2:01:33] then what does Satan what can Satan do
[2:01:36] to you
[2:01:37] he tries to put the thoughts in
[2:01:38] discourages ah this message ain't good
[2:01:40] you know you're going to hell anyways
[2:01:43] and like a water on a duck's back
[2:01:47] what we've got knowledge of Truth
[2:01:53] we're living in the most deceitful age
[2:01:55] ever
[2:01:57] and yet we have the knowledge of Truth
[2:02:00] which brings the fear of the Lord
[2:02:05] just imagine what God has really done
[2:02:07] for you
[2:02:09] if that could be a real knowledge of
[2:02:10] truth that God has really saved your
[2:02:12] soul
[2:02:14] what a reverence it brings to us
[2:02:17] right
[2:02:18] that he's the one that's carrying you
[2:02:19] brother Branson
[2:02:21] it's not your own ability it's not your
[2:02:23] own power it's not your own talents
[2:02:26] that God has kept you
[2:02:28] it brings the fear of the Lord in
[2:02:30] reverence to him
[2:02:33] God give us it
[2:02:35] amen
[2:02:37] Satan has sought to be like God Isaiah
[2:02:40] 14 13 it says for thou has said in thine
[2:02:42] heart I will Ascend into heaven I will
[2:02:45] exalt my throne above the Stars I will
[2:02:47] sit also upon the Mount of the
[2:02:48] congregation in the sides of the north I
[2:02:50] will Ascend above the heights of the
[2:02:51] clouds I will be like the most time
[2:02:55] second Thessalonians 2 4 who opposeth
[2:02:58] and exalteth himself above all that is
[2:03:00] called God or that is worshiped so that
[2:03:02] he has God sitteth in the temple of God
[2:03:03] showing that he is God right this is
[2:03:07] Satan's agenda jinda this is his goal
[2:03:10] has he not done it
[2:03:13] Matthew 24 23 then if any man shall say
[2:03:16] unto you Lo here is Christ or there
[2:03:19] believe it not
[2:03:21] don't go following can I say this in

[2:05:08] us adults you see your parents
[2:05:11] struggling you see your parents going
[2:05:13] through it but they're sticking it out
[2:05:14] well you got to do the same thing
[2:05:16] you got to get your roots in this
[2:05:18] message
[2:05:22] why because we need Faithful Men we need
[2:05:24] faithful women
[2:05:27] hello
[2:05:29] can't use people that just so soft that
[2:05:32] when the trial comes they just gonna
[2:05:33] blow away
[2:05:34] we need people that are faithful solid
[2:05:37] people
[2:05:39] that know how it is that when the Trials
[2:05:41] come you're like yeah I'm going through
[2:05:43] praise God why they got the fear of the
[2:05:45] Lord
[2:05:48] they got more respect and more reverence
[2:05:50] to God that when Satan comes and slaps
[2:05:52] them up the head I don't care what you
[2:05:54] do to me Satan I'm still serving the
[2:05:55] lord
[2:05:57] we'll see well this is what you say see
[2:05:59] if any man shall say unto you here's
[2:06:01] Christ here's an anointing there's a
[2:06:03] Revival over here there's a Revival
[2:06:04] there boy this church is in Revival look
[2:06:06] at what they're doing they're prospering
[2:06:10] amen
[2:06:12] believe it or not for this shall arise
[2:06:14] false Christ false anointed false
[2:06:16] teachers false prophets
[2:06:18] and they shall shoot signs and wonders
[2:06:21] great signs and wonders in so much if it
[2:06:24] were possible they would deceive the
[2:06:25] very elect
[2:06:27] ain't that right
[2:06:29] see so this is what Satan's agenda is
[2:06:33] okay second Corinthians 11 13 for such
[2:06:36] are false Apostles deceitful workers
[2:06:38] transforming themselves into the
[2:06:40] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[2:06:42] Satan himself is transformed into an
[2:06:45] angel of Light
[2:06:47] therefore it is no great thing if his
[2:06:49] ministers also be transformed as the
[2:06:51] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[2:06:53] shall be according to their works
[2:06:56] ain't that right so they they're I'm
[2:06:58] just reading Satan's agenda he started
[2:07:00] out I will be as God I will arise above
[2:07:02] the stars or sons of God I will do this
[2:07:04] thing and how's he doing it he said in
[2:07:06] his preachers out he's deceiving if so
[2:07:08] it's a great age of deception it's the
[2:07:11] greatest things to Prophet said that it
[2:07:13] would deceive the elect if it were
[2:07:14] possible
[2:07:16] ain't that right notice II Corinthians
[2:07:18] four and three if our gospel be hid it
[2:07:21] is hid to them that are lost in whom the
[2:07:23] God of this world everybody say the God
[2:07:26] of this world well who is the God of
[2:07:29] this world the devil so he's
[2:07:31] accomplished it right he's accomplished
[2:07:33] it being the God of this world in other
[2:07:35] words God is object of worship he is the
[2:07:38] object of worship in this world
[2:07:41] whether they're at a basketball game or
[2:07:43] they're sitting in a church under their
[2:07:45] Creeds and dogmas under their tradition
[2:07:47] of men their he has become the god of
[2:07:50] this world
[2:07:52] blinded see the God of this world has
[2:07:54] blinded the minds of them which believe
[2:07:55] not lest the Glorious Gospel Light of
[2:07:58] the gospel of Christ who is the image of
[2:08:00] God should shine in unto them ain't that
[2:08:03] right now notice what the prophet said
[2:08:05] the God of this world today the worship
[2:08:07] person of this world today is Satan and
[2:08:09] the people are ignorant of worshiping
[2:08:11] Satan but it's Satan impersonating
[2:08:13] himself as the church as the church they
[2:08:15] worship Satan thinking that they're
[2:08:16] worshiping God through the church but
[2:08:18] it's the way Satan has done it all you
[2:08:20] say but wait a minute we preached the
[2:08:22] word but look back here at my text
[2:08:23] tonight Satan was the one that preached
[2:08:25] the word to e first God hath said but
[2:08:28] see it's that misconstruing that part of
[2:08:31] the scripture that applies to the day
[2:08:34] isn't that right he's all got all kinds
[2:08:37] of knowledge of God that he'll teach you
[2:08:38] a little Bible lesson but when it comes
[2:08:40] to recognizing God for today uh he ain't
[2:08:44] gonna tell you that why he wants to be
[2:08:46] the god
[2:08:49] right
[2:08:50] he wants to be God
[2:08:52] see so he'll let you know all that Jesus
[2:08:55] did was perfectly well he'll let you
[2:08:57] know that wall that Moses did was
[2:08:58] perfectly well but when you take the
[2:09:00] promises that they gave for this day and
[2:09:03] then that was applied to another age he
[2:09:05] says see well see that's all he has to
[2:09:07] do is to get the plea people to believe
[2:09:10] it that way that's all see you cannot
[2:09:12] take one word away from it and add one
[2:09:14] word to it but that's what he does and
[2:09:17] the people ignorantly worshiping Satan
[2:09:19] thinking they're worshiping God
[2:09:22] can you say Amen
[2:09:26] see so they have a knowledge and by that
[2:09:28] knowledge they are worshiping
[2:09:30] but yet it hasn't brought the fear of
[2:09:31] the Lord
[2:09:33] thank God
[2:09:35] that we have a knowledge
[2:09:38] that surpasses all understanding of man
[2:09:42] can you say man
[2:09:43] do you love him
[2:09:45] I love him or we could go more and more
[2:09:48] but if the musicians will come
[2:09:51] see the knowledge that Satan has given
[2:09:53] the people has caused him to explain the
[2:09:55] realities of God today away
[2:09:59] they've done away with the supernatural
[2:10:01] they've done away you know uh uh with uh
[2:10:06] well they they just explain away the the
[2:10:08] operation of the gifts they don't
[2:10:10] believe in miracle and healing they
[2:10:11] don't believe in the genuine outpouring
[2:10:13] of the Holy Ghost anymore
[2:10:15] they don't believe in them things
[2:10:18] so what do they do they they go without
[2:10:20] an experience or brother Brown says
[2:10:22] Satan Works two ways
[2:10:24] he pushes the people into form of
[2:10:26] formality where there's no Spirit
[2:10:27] whatsoever
[2:10:29] they don't believe in healing Miracles
[2:10:31] they don't believe in gifts they don't
[2:10:32] believe in nothing
[2:10:34] so you just sit there feel your time out
[2:10:36] hear a well-educated preacher
[2:10:39] just ease your mind
[2:10:41] just treat it like a little old Seminary
[2:10:45] take your pen and paper and you just all
[2:10:47] write little things it's got to where
[2:10:49] the people don't even say man anymore
[2:10:52] see
[2:10:53] and then they do their little lesson and
[2:10:55] they go out
[2:10:58] not no enthusiasm in the church far be
[2:11:00] it from that
[2:11:02] now you can go to a rock concert and get
[2:11:04] enthused
[2:11:05] but don't go to church
[2:11:08] why because they have more experience
[2:11:10] out in the world than they do with God
[2:11:12] in the church
[2:11:14] well then brother Brown says then Satan
[2:11:16] works the other way too he'll push
[2:11:17] another people this way to where they
[2:11:19] become so radical in in worship and it's
[2:11:22] all based upon emotions
[2:11:25] now that's that's where we were
[2:11:29] in a lot I remember dad preaching for an
[2:11:31] Apostolic Church one time and they
[2:11:33] danced every service
[2:11:34] I have never seen my dad dance
[2:11:37] even to this day
[2:11:39] and but they would have him preach but
[2:11:42] finally the pastor came to him and said
[2:11:44] Brother Martin we love your preaching we
[2:11:45] just love it but
[2:11:47] we know she don't dance
[2:11:49] and
[2:11:50] we just kind of
[2:11:52] draw the line that if you if if you
[2:11:54] don't dance in the service then we we
[2:11:56] don't need your preaching
[2:11:59] but that was their that was their
[2:12:02] standard
[2:12:03] of a move of God
[2:12:07] what knowledge
[2:12:10] but then the prophet says that the bride
[2:12:14] is right in the middle of the road
[2:12:17] can you say man she's right in the in
[2:12:19] the middle of the road see and and so
[2:12:22] the world is gaining in knowledge
[2:12:25] but not coming to the knowledge of Truth
[2:12:27] and Jesus said in John 17 17 Thy word is
[2:12:30] truth right
[2:12:32] and brother Brown said Jesus is the word
[2:12:34] the truth made manifest
[2:12:37] so
[2:12:38] then another place John 14 6 Jesus said
[2:12:41] I am the way the truth and the life
[2:12:43] meant that right so the word is truth
[2:12:46] Jesus says I am the truth so then he was
[2:12:48] the word made flesh
[2:12:51] and every time the word becomes flesh
[2:12:53] that becomes the truth
[2:12:57] amen
[2:12:59] so we find that the Bible is God's truth
[2:13:03] and letter form
[2:13:04] right
[2:13:06] but but I want to say this as I close
[2:13:08] you don't just find the truth
[2:13:11] in letter form
[2:13:14] how many people today are reading from
[2:13:15] this Bible behind pulpits everywhere
[2:13:20] reading the scriptures
[2:13:22] and never coming to knowledge of Truth
[2:13:27] right
[2:13:28] because you don't find you just don't
[2:13:31] find truth in the letter of the word
[2:13:33] actually second Corinthians 3 6 Paul
[2:13:35] says the letter killeth but the spirit
[2:13:37] gives life
[2:13:38] so Millions churches have the Bible
[2:13:40] millions of sermons are being preached
[2:13:42] this morning from the Bible but they
[2:13:44] take those very scriptures and they
[2:13:46] misinterpret them to the people and they
[2:13:48] take these scriptures and explain God
[2:13:50] away the realities of God the life of
[2:13:53] God everything that God is they explain
[2:13:55] it away from the people and avert the
[2:13:58] people's attention from a reality of God
[2:14:01] to a lesson little Bible lesson
[2:14:05] to where God is so far from their minds
[2:14:08] and the world is ever present there
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:12] you say man so the knowledge of God
[2:14:14] isn't getting to the people so then
[2:14:16] let's ask the question how do you
[2:14:19] respect something you don't know
[2:14:22] how can a person Reverend something they
[2:14:24] cannot understand
[2:14:26] how can people stand in awe of God when
[2:14:29] they don't see him in action
[2:14:32] and you say man
[2:14:34] so it goes back to the point they're not
[2:14:36] aware of his presence
[2:14:38] reading a Bible and yet they're not
[2:14:41] aware that he's here in this age
[2:14:44] because it took a prophet in this age to
[2:14:46] announce
[2:14:48] he's here
[2:14:50] just as much as it took John the Baptist
[2:14:52] to announce to that age
[2:14:54] he's here
[2:14:55] he's on Earth Behold the Lamb of God
[2:14:57] right Behold the Lamb of God aren't you
[2:15:00] glad for a message aren't you glad
[2:15:02] you've heard the voice you've been given
[2:15:03] a knowledge he's here
[2:15:05] he's on Earth
[2:15:07] and where is he
[2:15:10] in his bride
[2:15:12] she is him
[2:15:14] what a knowledge and it brings such a
[2:15:16] fear a reverence
[2:15:18] of respect
[2:15:20] oh God I want it more and more
[2:15:24] I want to be so conscious of him
[2:15:26] and that's what the message is to do is
[2:15:28] to bring us a conscience of him
[2:15:30] so when the devil tells you you're just
[2:15:32] some little insignificant nobody don't
[2:15:34] don't let the devil do that to you
[2:15:36] because all he's wanting to do is get
[2:15:38] your attention averted from the reality
[2:15:41] of God in you
[2:15:43] and get you on some idea to where you
[2:15:45] actually worshiping him Satan
[2:15:50] amen
[2:15:52] I hope it's helped you today
[2:15:54] thank you for your patience
[2:15:57] what song
[2:16:02] oh I'm
[2:16:03] [Music]
[2:16:08] oh you care
[2:16:12] Through Your Precious Blood I found
[2:16:17] pardon
[2:16:19] and my sins are washed
[2:16:24] they're all washed away
[2:16:27] all my sins are Wars
[2:16:31] oh sing it again
[2:16:34] I'm Amazed
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:40] oh I stand amazing
[2:16:44] how you care
[2:16:48] Through Your Precious Blood I found
[2:16:53] pardon
[2:16:55] and my sins are your sins washed
[2:16:59] what a knowledge to know
[2:17:02] oh my sins are one sing the first verse
[2:17:09] oh no one knew how alone I was feeling
[2:17:16] and The Emptiness I tried so hard to
[2:17:21] hide
[2:17:23] though I laughed and said my life was
[2:17:27] fine without you
[2:17:30] I was covering up the secret tears I
[2:17:35] cried
[2:17:37] then day someone told me of your mercy
[2:17:45] and the love you showed on a Hill Called
[2:17:49] Calvary
[2:17:51] there you died
[2:17:53] and purchased my Redemption
[2:17:58] when you broke sin's power set my spirit
[2:18:03] free oh I'm Amazed
