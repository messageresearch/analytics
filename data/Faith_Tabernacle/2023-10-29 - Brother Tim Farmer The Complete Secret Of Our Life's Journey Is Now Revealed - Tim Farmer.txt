time you know he said if we ain't bride there's a bride out there somewhere and I don't want to stand in her way I want to do everything that I can help her and encourage her so but we know who we are this morning I believe I'm one of them don't you keyf SE you're invited to a wedding that will be held soon and Christ is the GRE and we are his bride with a crown to we and a Long White Road will

know you get to looking around and listen to different ones throughout the message you see the world ain't got all the talent God's got his he's got the best kind ain't he amen so we'll appreciate him and all the gifts and the things that he has placed in his body this morning just so we can make it home it's beautiful beautiful if you have your Bibles we want to turn this morning if you'll stand with me for the reading of his word Genesis Chapter 18 and of course I've had people say different times you just about war Genesis 18 out ain't you Bibles falling apart in Genesis 8 18 Revelation 10 and well the reason is is I'm happy about my day I'm happy about what God done in my day I appreciate the other days but I want to know what God is doing in my day in this hour and this very moment brother brandham said man has always been praising God for what he has done and praising God in the future for what he's going to do and failing to recognize and thank God and praise him for what he's doing right now at this very moment so he is present here this morning in this place he promised he would be here and he here he ain't gone he's here prophet's off the scene but he's here matter of fact he said I must leave he must increase I must decrease my Ministry is to declare one thing that he is here that he is present with his people amen don't tell just make you feel we could we just close it up by that right now if you just think about that all day long and uh we could just rejoice in that and be happy and we should and uh so Genesis 18 and and we have a little subject this morning just want to uh talk to you for just a few moments and pray there be an encouragement and uh how many knows your life is special and uh let's go a little bit further and see if you agree with me here your life is just as special as Jesus Christ was brother Bram said it was he said you and Jesus was the same he's the great Son of God is that right and the only difference between you in Jesus you bypassed your theophany and come here what a revelation so we had to come here and we wanted talk about that just a little while this morning some things that God has done for us in this day to help us here cuz I ain't home yet and I want to go home and we see all the things happening yeah it's heating up we going we go home amen Genesis 18 and we want to read with verse 161 17 and 18 and then we want to go to Psalms 25 uh 14 and then we want to go to Luke and you can hold you your places there we won't make you stand long verse 16 and the men rose up from fence and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Ab Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him and Psalms chapter 24 verse uh 27 excuse me Psalm 25 verse4 Psalm 25:14 the secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him and He will them his Covenant what a scripture Luke 24 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them and all the scriptures the things concerning himself the things concerning himself in Luke 24 in the same chapter there verse 44 and this is Jesus speaking these are the Words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled that all things must be fulfilled which was written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me verse 45 then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and you may be seated this morning and we want to entitle this the complete Secret Of Our Lives has now been revealed now I want you to think about that this morning your life how many that times and time times past you had questions in your life how many's got questions this morning and when you were younger going through life going to school you know there's many things that you questioned you know and there came a day and time that you realized you was here you say brother Tim did the prophet talk about that yes he said the first thing I remember is crawling across the floor and my mother had let my uncle in it was snowing outside and the snow was melting off his boots and I was licking the snow off of his boots and he said I realized I was here that may be strange and when I heard him say that there's thing things that went back in my mind that I thought about when you realized well I'm here this is my life you know Mom Dad going to work getting up you know the everyday grind and the things that that you had to do and and I I want to tell you back then they didn't have kindergarten to start you out they just throwed you right in the first grade and I was always in my mind they would say you know you're going to have one of those main teachers and I want to tell you my mind brother Tim I imagined in my mind what she look like and you know I seen an old program years ago called The Wizard of Oz remember the the wicked witch and she had a uh a mole on the end of her nose my mom went and signed me up for first grade you ain't go believe this I walked in AR she looked exactly like that woman life I said oh my and boy she was and so so I kind of walked the straight line and I watched myself because she scared me to death and so she she was one of those and you probably remember this they don't have this in school anymore if you she caught you talking or chewing gum boy it'd be good if we had those problems again wouldn't it if she caught you doing those things that you know she'd come up and she had a ruler and she say put your hand out oh after that one time that was enough for me and I'd sit back out I wouldn't say nothing you say brother Tim that's hard to believe about you well you can believe it but life our lives has a very special meaning the family we were born in the places we have come through in our lives every obstacle every trial everything has a reason behind it amen the prophet told us that our lives and this great message that he has given me and you this morning that God has revealed to us his Secrets but it's about your life it's about why that you were here why that you was born in the first place why that you that God ever thought of you and he knew you before there was a world ain't that wonderful and he had a plan for you you didn't just come on you know maybe uh you ain't never heard this but my wife sitting there uh she was the youngest of uh the one in her family and when she was a little girl her oldest sister kindly picked on her and she told her one day said well you don't even supposed to be here you was a mistake I heard Daddy and Mama talking and you was a mistake but how many knows God don't make mistakes and when we come to this message it was such a blessing to know that your life and your very being here was no mistake that's right and we talked about Jesus's birth brother brandham said the Virgin birth ain't half the mystery of what a natural birth is you all the millions one do you know you're one in a million one in a million all the ones that could have been wasn't and brother Brenham said what was the intelligence behind that one crawling to where the egg was and the Egg coming up there to that one and them connecting he said they had to be a supernatural intelligence behind it to connect together and what color hair that you would have and what color eyes that you would have you know I Ain't Too Tall this morning but when I come to this message you know God made me exactly the way he wanted me be what height you would be brother Brenham said even your nature the things that he thought of you before you got here just like a mom and dad getting ready for a baby and make him ready for the coming he said God spoke all of these things all the beautiful mountains and the flowers and the thing he prepared for your coming you see why we should be worshippers you see why we should be the most happiest people on the face of the Earth this morning you see why that we it's more than a song to us it's more than just a worship to us it's our very life it's our very being that's why we were here that's why we came down this way we're not a mistake we are the very offspring of almighty [Music] God Amen you're supposed to be in here say sin interrupted oh I love this devil interrupted everything but he didn't stop God and might have been an interruption but God just said I've got a plan from the foundation of world going to be a little Interruption here we're going to have to swing down into time oh I love that but after a while we're going to swing back up into eternity and I've got a plan and your life your very natural life that she was told she was a mistake my wife now I beg the difference about the other two now I thought and I shouldn't say it's maybe mean a little bit to me now I know they ain't more mistakes but to me it'd be like they would be the mistak [Laughter] say you ever thought that but God gives life and we taught by the great secrets of almighty God in this hour that that's how serpent SE got on there because God is the author of Life all life regardless brother brandham said and I'll quote him perverted life or any kind of life it's the higher life it come down from that higher life there's a love there's a great love of almighty God but there's also a lower love and it come down from that great love and it come down to this hour so people say well that ain't love yes it is it is the perverted love of the higher love everything come from him all life everything generated from him because he it or allowed it because it was part of his great plan the Lord and you know we went through all of those ages the church went through all of that time from the time of Paul and Paul said I'm looking through a glass Darkly still a little dark for Paul all the great things but I'm looking through the glass dark but then up there at the end there's going to be a Perfection then we're going to see face to face we're going to face it off and God is going to come face to face with his church in the end time to reveal what this whole secret of your life was all about why you came the way you came why you come through this and come through that it was God bringing you to that place and all the time brother Brenham said you walking around down through here there's a little spark in there you didn't know what it was but you would go so far and you say why better not going much further is that right oh there's something to come to you may be in school or whatever say but something held you back it's something little spark of life you're not understanding something going on here why am I here it was a mystery to you why is this and you sat out there maybe fishing like I did or hunting looking at everything all around you what's this about where am I headed what's all this about all my feelings don't say you don't have them and feelings and and mind battles and this and that brother and them said a a child gets to a certain age about 12 or 13 a years old and the devil is waiting to give him a mind blast and some don't handle that mind blast too good he blasts he tries to take it he tries to affect you he tries to mess you up mhm and when we were we're born in sin just because we're bride this morning that don't get you out of the category that you were born in sin conceived in iniquity come to the world speaking lies is that right in the same type of body as everybody else walking around same feelings same emotions same passions same everything ain't no difference that's except one thing there was a seed Gene of almighty God that was placed down actually you're sold from the foundation of the world Amen and Satan can blast everything else and he can make this body sick but he can't get to that seal of almighty God that seed that's down in there and at the right time it will come forth and you'll begin to look around and you say why I done that oh I'm so ashamed don't ever want to go back to that what was I thinking yeah you was thinking the way he was thinking but something woke up in you one day and you recognized that something was going on and you recognized you might have went to an altar I don't know you might have been riding down the road I was riding down the road going to my grandmother's house and God just a dealing with me I didn't tell nobody prise the Lord I didn't tell nobody but God was dealing with me didn't tell Mom and Dad or anything but God was dealing with and the only thing I know how to pray brother brandham wrote him a note and put it in a tree Mr Jesus mm you say God cares about that you better believe he cares about that he said I didn't know how to talk to him I didn't know how to approach him I didn't know how to get to him but I know I needed him and I didn't know how to pray I was raised in a Pentecostal home a Pentecostal holess the day that they used to live Holiness and the ladies would shout and praise God and I remember as a little boy sitting on watching and I had their High tied up in pin and they were shouting it wasn't it wasn't fake it was real that was the age and they would shout and praise God and I sat there as a little boy I'd hear something go ping ping at and I was watching that they shout and dance their higher down mhm they lived right they loved right they done all those things right for their age brother brandham said don't say they didn't have the Holy Ghost back there don't say that they didn't have it they had it for their day they could only see and allowed to see what was for that time and that hour mhm now how about you oh my your life now by this message of this hour just like Abraham has unfolded and God has unfolded while you're here and why you see what you see and why you know what you know and what has happened to you he'll not lose none of themen you no one no one could preach and teach and bring what we have today to this hour oh they hit at it brother Terry they talked about it some Luther preached justification that's what when he it struck him when he was reading Romans as a priest and he fell back down that that stair step he was beating himself up trying to bring himself under trying to bring himself to subject to God sincere wan to love God want to sincerely praise God and worship him but he didn't realize there's a nature there's a sin question has to be answered it's something that's got to happen and so when he was reading that just reading the Bible justification and it struck him that a priest or a pope that no one else could pray my sins that I'm Justified solely by the Lord Jesus Christ and what he done to shed blood at Calvary and my goodness down back over that he fell back down over that but brother when he got up from there he was fre that far anyway and just justification what did it cause cause the Reformation is actually this weekend prise the lord it's actually this weekend on Halloween Luther October 31st nailed his 95 thesises of everything that had more than that but he had 95 against them 95 thesises of everything that the Roman Catholic Church was doing that was contr to the Bible man' is that right and so what had it started it now what did the world think brother brandham said they thought it was a bunch of arguments a bunch of monk of monks that's right bunch of caring on they brought him up there and they could have killed him but you know Ain't It Strange they never killed Luther they would stand there and argue with him they could have killed him they they they throwed him here his own friends because they were afraid they were going to kill him actually kidnapped him put a bomb fold over him took him way out in the country somewhere and kept him in a place where nobody was at and so he just wrote things and they took it out and B it out ain't just something God knows how to do things don't but what was his life he thought he was going to be a priest he thought he was going to be but ended up being the fifth Church age messenger what a life no matter where you at you know you might have been on a farm you might have been in a factory you might have been uh in a different home you might have been as as my wife you were a mistake it might have thought that all your life I don't know but you know what I'm not looking at a bunch of mistakes here this morning you know what I'm careful what I say because I'm not looking at a bunch of mistakes I'm looking at the very purchase of his blood this morning I'm looking at the very seed genene of almighty God and what he had in his mind and his thoughts before there was a world is that right you can you believe it's you that's right when it strikes you I read to you this morning read to you this morning Abraham Abraham's life types the life of the believer it unfolds this story we read this morning in chapter 18 25 years had passed since God had told him he was going to Happ have a son Lord you say I want it now no you don't get it overnight uhhuh there is a life's journey see I I'll quote this as brother Brenham said and who is this madc and when I read this the other day he said now in ver in in chapter uh 100 112 paragraph 112 who is this mckisic he said now we see here plainly the complete Secret Of Our Lives praise the Lord now I'm going preacher I can stop I just stay right there and preach listen now we see here plainly in this who is this mckz didc the same one that met Abraham the same one that Paul talked about Lord and he said his group was do of hearing I won't talk about him a little bit but but you ain't far more advanced that I can talk to you really about him he said because I find you D of hearing but there is an order of mckisic now we're not talking about skiing milk here we're not talking about Luther's age oh I'm happy I got saved justification but God comes down in this hour Luther could preach it we're justified by Calvary and what he done there but brother brandham comes on the scene now remember this is mckisic that's behind this and mchis DEC teaching says I want to go a little bit farther and bring it out because Luther couldn't bring it all the way out but I'm going to bring it all the way out yes sir you ain't forgiven people say I'm forgiven remember brother brandham uh used brother Perry green and he said just like you brother Perry said somebody told you I'm down here running across the town drinking and I'm a drunk and you come to me and say brother brandom I want to know why that you was down here and I would tell you that well that's untrue I didn't do him and he would say to me brother per would say I forgive you brother brandom he said forgive me never done it now listen that's God in simplicity so in this hour he comes and he stands up one day day and he says this is stuff sayth the Lord you are the sinless you were the sinless blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute iniquity oh the devil says mama says this says I don't care who says oh oh I don't care who says I don't care if the president says or whoever he says God says God says Tim fber you're sinless oh what's sinless unbeliever you are the sinless listen to me virtuous you believe believe that uh-huh well let's get out of here just K so brother Tim you no let's go let's go you believe that you are sinless brother BR said you was trapped into him oh said God makes an excuse for it say he trapped had to come his way and you didn't ask to come his way something happened and you had to come this way is that right so before the foundation of the world because you had to come God went ahead and wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and he had in the back of his mind one day one day their life is going to unfold oh they won't know what's going on but I'm going to slip down I'm going to send them a Vindication like the world of Earth has never seen and I'm going to come down there as mckc again I'm going to speak about him here in Abraham Paul's going to hit him a little bit but I'm going to have a Vindicated Prophet as a bride standing in Le oia that will be all mixed up and we're all confused and not understand why am I here what's going on why am I in this situation and I'm going to send my word by a Vindicated prophet and I'm going to come down myself yes sir I've had people say you've lost your mind you went off the deep end no I ain't lost my mind I got it brother Terry I got my mind back when this message struck my heart and begin to get into what God had said about his bride this thing was not about a a church or a denomination or a building or some Fly by Night Ministry this was the ministry of MDC in the end time not this time letting a little bit out of it all of it to unfold the complete secret of why you here and why you had to come about God oh he talked about God in this hour himself but do you know he talked more about you than he did himself amen amen we recognized it was God brother BR said we always know Theologian knows he always great is great he is the greatest he's the author of life we know all about that we always thought that even when you wasn't converted you thought that there's a God that he's great and he's passy and out but brother Brenham said what makes him great to me is that he can come down and make himself so small to get down to where you at and talk to you and communicate with you and know the very hearts and desires of your thoughts even down that the prophet said if you have a hang nail anybody ever had a hang nail that God is concerned because the pain of the Hang nail if he's concerned about a hang nail this morning then what if he's concerned about the Mind battle you're going through he's concerned about young people the troubles and the things that you facing and on your job he knows about you and he wants to know about you he called you to fellowship and have that great fellowship with him and communion this morning that's why he done these things to let you know it's all right it's going to be all right you're going to be all right cuz he'll press you he'll press you and if he thinks you wor seeed oh he'll bother you let me tell you I don't want mean to scre you but all of those devils are pointed towards you this morning you say brother Tim over in Israel what's going on over there oh my the secrets but D we know what's going on what's going on there's 144,000 I don't know how don't ask me how cuz you look up the population of Israel it's 80 85 % homosexual the scripture says in the Book of Revelation the scripture says that Jerusalem is called Sodom and Egypt Sodom and Egypt and their population is D you say that's awful they walked in there and beheaded little babies beheaded men women in their bed killed them Wicked devil and God is my witness I sitting at my house the other day and I was talking this brother goes to my church we was talking and all of a sudden brother sister just struck me said he's out that 14 4,000 it's getting close he knows it's getting close I don't know where I don't know how I don't know where it's coming from but there's 144,000 getting ready to receive two prophets and they're going to believe the same thing we believe this morning and their life is going to be explained to them and why they here and why they believe the way they do and why they are the way they are and everything aspect brother sister ain't you grateful this morning this complete secret of our life is now revealed you believe that he said brother Tim listen we now see plainly brother BR said there I'm mistake it plainly don't mean there's any fog in it I like to see plainly don't you I went down to fog of thick and everything I don't like that I like to be able to see plainly and he said now we see plainly the complete Secret Of Our Lives listen to this in Journey so we was to take a journey amen so a complete secret of our lives in Journey and death and where we go I we die amen so the complete secret has been revealed to his little bride in this hour about your journey and the journey that you had to make here and then when you die about your death that it is appointed to God for you to die unless amen somebody one morning is going to break all that appointment amen because Paul said we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and we shall be gathered together you believe they're coming back yes sir let me go you little father that do you believe they here this morning said now brother Tim now you going aw I'm in there you they're in this atmosphere brother Brandon matter of fact I love this our life is explained matter of fact he said there about 20 foot away your theophany body is waiting on you your life explained why do you believe the way you believe why do something strike you one day amen why did something come to you one day that sounded farfetched unbelievable but yet it was TR you couldn't explain you couldn't figure it out you just knew something woke up in you and something was pulling you and what was that I've had people say well I've tried to talk to these people on my job and I shut up I've talked to some people I wish they' shut up said don't I supposed to witness yes but you see this light right here is that a light you know that light blesses me I can see my sermon and all of this but that light ain't said one thing to me and that light ain't pck me on the shoulder here this morning and say hey Tim Farmer don't you know I'm here Hey listen listen listen I'm a light is that right now listen I believe in witness we should but I want to tell you if you go into the job and somebody in your neighborhood they don't know how you live right and they don't know what you stand for then you ain't much of a light and our Prophet said if you're go to talking to somebody and they start to cutting the messes down he said you shut up you stop right there cause the election is off I duck cuz sometimes there's lemons and everything else comes is that right I be feel good this morning is this truth now I'm not going to be all day but you're complete secret Lord and it's no secret to the world how you live and how you dress and how you talk and what you like to talk about I've seen people go in and blab and brother Brenham said now boy is do I have to say that Lord yall go in and when he's done told us for the lay and that b don't you start handling the scriptures he said you have respect to your pastor you have respect to your pastor now if you know exactly what's being preached and the doctrine it's all right to say a little bit but a lot of times as brother Brenham said you can get going and everything and end up they're confused and you're confused and I'm going to put it on us here this morning who preachers he said it's hard hard enough for the preachers to keep it straight say brother Tim you just point back to yourself yeah I ask my church I need God just as much as you need him and by the way I mean this is just a calling I'm no different than you just in office yes is that right I have the same battles and probably more battles cuz he's going to come against that word so you pray for your pastor and he said don't you get out here and try to straighten this out to do that he said the best thing say with me the best thing I'm glad everything was answered in this message how about you if everybody just go on and do what he said to do and leave it alone just do what he said to do do and love one another like we're supposed to this ain't no normal love this is the very G love of almighty God that should be in our souls brother Brenham said those that love this message should love one another if you love this message you'll love the bride oh I said brother Tim you're meddling well maybe I need to medal here a little bit meddling but he said the best thing if it's a subject or something he said you tell you Pastor well I don't tell him whether you're wrong then you tell your pastor I got a few questions on Israel over there and the fifth seal and you know that's all right got some things that I don't fully understand and everything and people's asking me on my job or all of these things I don't fully understand it he said you go get your pastor and you tell him and you bring him in there and you invite that person and if they are seed if they're serious if it ain't just to fly by night or they just blabbing if they're really serious about it I'll tell you it's one or two uh one or three things either their seed foolish virgin or serpent seed so how do you know that brother Tam because that's how it is see the complete secret of my life has been involded all the secrets see people say I got questions questions questions but see in this hour it ain't questions and brother BR didn't bring a question mark to us he said we got all the answers if we don't just have a Fly by Night baptism of the Holy Ghost like the Pentecostals at Luther was the what horse and buggy age Wesley was the model T4 getting a little higher age say brother Tim I'm Pentecostal not me cuz I don't like to fly I don't like it you see made up and they up and all the masks fall down we're are now in turbulence he said that's the Pentecostal wage brother brandham said so oh my brother Tim you down in my p no it's more than that it's more than a horse and buggy that was nice that's Luther's say but that's a lot of work got feed that horse every day you want to go somewhere you got to hook the put the brid in him hook the buggy up I feel sorry for denominational people cuz all it is is work work work work you see them out here they got the bless their hearts all they making the apple butter all that work to death cuz they in that a all this to stirring the apple butter making the Apple flitters to pay the poor old preacher they ain't got enough sense to tell them what the scriptures even says and every once in a while you'll find one that'll want to read it a little [Music] bit but this a working oh had to hook that horse up feed him bring him back home and take him back out scraping back down not me that's up to you mhm boy that's hard a is that right don't me wrong I like horses I rode the last one 30 years ago and I said I better stay off of this I found out I wasn't Roy Rogers but brother brandham said in the next age is the Wesley age and that's the Model T you ever how many ever well you love break your arm amen smile it's all right listen coming down through never where you going now hear you coming before you get it's John Wesley's age age of sanctification brother Bram said you're Justified you never done it God got you out there's been a lamb not slang that Calvary but in the mind of almighty God before there was a foundation of the world he slay the lamb put your name in there and said that you would come to a full maturity of adoption in this it's all about the secret amen the secret is B unveiled but they're cranking that's sanctification brother Brenham comes in this hour and he said now we don't preach that the way the old time Wesley preached it as human perfection and a pro Vindicated Prophet comes die and tells you that you will never be perfect matter of fact you make mistakes every day and you backslide a thousand times that's right and we're praying oh God God no it's like this little story I heard of this man every week in a Pentecostal Church should come to the Altar and bless his heart sincere come to the Altar and he raised his hands and he said oh God I haven't done too well this week come and take the cobwebs out of my life and every week that young man would come down to the altar say oh God the same prayer I've come up short this we come and take the cob waves out finally a sincere brother said I love that brother I'm praying for him he come the next week same thing oh God come and take the cobwebs out of my life the brother goes over and he said God don't do it what I thought you said he loved the bril don't do it but Lord I want you to kill that spider that's making the god Wes the only way this morning for you to have more God is to die some more what's your life about dying dying out and letting him be more this ain't the real me the real me is down in here and the real me one of these days will be let out I want to tell you in this hour the real me when this Prophet said the real you you woke up you were in a dead body and one day you realized the real you was head away down in here and all the mess was ever covered over it but the devil couldn't hold it long enough when God come and quickens you and came a visitation to you one day and no matter what anybody else thought brother sister that day that day and you'll never forget it God struck your heart and brought you out of that mess and the truth be told he's still bringing [Applause] you I don't mean to

children your Offspring will be up there and I'm glad he said offspring that not only means you your physical sons and daughters but what about those you begotten through the Gospel of Jesus Christ that you thought there all y Offspring will be there Lord amen now how many's got about 10 more minutes I don't mean to be long but listen to this it's plainly in your journey your death and where we go after we die also predestin nation is in plain view here now listen as we teach this closely I wrote that down this morning and it never struck me to was in this office down here listen closely so oh he was this there and at the high school brother Tim preaching that good sermon but that was put on tape Now you listen closely amen and you get down you put everything aside and every foolishness and everything and you get into this message and you listen closely am because the secret of your entire life is being revealed amen I'm just playing brother Brandon no he said when you listen or when you come to church you should have a notepad out and you should be going down three hours and you go home at the brandham Tabernacle when brother brandham was here and the ones that I talked to when they were here they didn't have but a few tapes this is what they done they borrowed the tape they to or three of them took it home and they went to each other's houses and they listened to what that Vindicated prophet and made notes and then handed to the tape and they had discussions about it say your whole entire life yeah Malachi 3:16 and they spake often one to another and what they were say and talking to one another the Lord hearkened and he loved it they were talking this message they was talking this word of God this complete secret has now been revealed and given to you so in Le de se about your life come on get up get up when God made this visit to Abraham brother Brenham said Surah was in a bad mood I hope you're feeling better since you come in here today if you come in here in about she was in a real bad mood and I made a comment one time in my church they started laughing I said what you laughing about said what you said I said what' I say said that's why Abraham was out sitting out under the oak because Co sir was in a bad mood it's all right it's all right we should be the happiest people on the face of the Earth but he come by and ser was in a bad mood that morning what we call out of sorts she wasn't in the right frame of mind to hear about about anything and it was a time in your life you was in a bad mood and I pray to God you ain't in the B mood here this morning I pray you God come in this visitation to get the church back in the right frame of mind and the right kind of mood and attitude and I tell you God in flesh God in theophany or to get us in a good move now as we get ready to close notice this Abraham was sitting watching and he looked up one day and here come three men and brother Bram said something about a Christian they just pick up there something spiritual going on he look down through there something something about this sir I believe that's just old common folk like me and you how about you she's in a bad mood she's having a bad day so Papa just went outside but when he went outside he looked up and here come three men and one of them was God in a theophany two angels and God in a theophany 25 years had passed brother brandham said that his crops were burned up his cattle was DED he was in a famine he was sitting there waiting and here comes mkis DEC the Lord because he had to get the church B in the right thinking of mind and he had to get her to the place that she was a part of it because what she said when he says sah is going to he's telling Abraham Sarah's going to have a child and brother Brenham said she laughed in herself or laughed up her sleeve she didn't think nobody heard her who's this weirdo out here I don't know what's what's going on out here be careful what you say something spiritual going on am what's going on out here who's this I'm 90 years old huh laughed up her sleeve and then God looks at Abraham he said why did Sarah laugh uhoh then she looked at almighty God in his face and called him a liar that's what brother Brown said said well she didn't come right out and say he was a liar she said who what's going on here huh me be a to conceive a child Oh my he said God could have struck her dead right there just killed her little words off the wall could have killed her struck her dead but I love this but he couldn't take her because she was a part of Abraham and then brother brandham souped it up it got better and better and he said how many times could he throw dust in the dirt how many times you failed how many times that you done wrong how many times you said something you shouldn't have said and you know it he could have throwed you in the dirt but he couldn't done it cuz you a part of Christ and if he throw you in there he throw Christ in there and he's not going to throw Christ in there because there's a blood been shed there's a covering tonight there's a washing tonight there's a Lamb's Book of Life tonight and they're part of Christ so whatever he does with him listen he's going to do with me ain't that beautiful someone asked me in my church one time they said Jesus I preached a message one morning Jesus don't own it all no I'm getting him looks like I got my news flash in blackburg this morning Jesus don't own it all ahead well how much he own brother Tim 50% oh you got us didn't you brother Tim oh now don't look s what that preacher is this stream it's a streaming oh my listen he don't own at all you say why didn't don't on it all because that was his choice that's right cuz he didn't want heaven without you he didn't want the kingdoms without you he didn't want that's what your life is about that's the secret huh Adam walked out the door on almighty God therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and and cleave to his wife one day Adam you're going to love somebody more than you love me boy say brother Tim really one day you're going to think of somebody more and you're going to leave me and you're going to throw yourself and all the human race into death because you love that woman amen and when that scripture says that in Hebrews therefore shall a man leave and cleave to his wife the word cleave there means he shall not just leave with her and grab a hold of we've been taught that through Pentecost and down through our but the actual says this he shall pursue her all the rest of the days of his life and that will be what his life will be caught up in you say that's an awful thing Adam terrible Papa Adam what did you do now let's go down several thousand years now in a garden called guest Amen brother brandham said the greatest decision that was ever made he had a right to have a family a wife children a home cuz he was a man he had a right and in that Garden he had a chores and the father said will you do it Lord and so much was the pressure that he sweat the BL his blood out through his sweat glands No One Like Him amen ever be and I talked to a doctor and said that's really truthfully a person would have to be to a point and said their heart and everything would break down and it wouldn't be able to stand it you just blow off the PTI but that was the lamb the perfect lamb and when God God got that perfect Masterpiece and he said will you do it Adam walked out the door in the beginning to take his wife and the prophet said it's a type he loved her and was willing to throw himself into death to save her amen and in that Garden he said I will go I and brother Brenham you can read that quote he said the same thing he turned his back at him and walked out the door Jesus Christ walked out the door with his wife amen you cuz they're going to be waiting down there in blackburg they're going to know they're going to have to know these secrets these things brother Brenham said as we get ready to close the stages of Eternal his eternal purpose which he had in his secret has now been revealed the stages down through has now been revealed listen to this the Mysteries that had been hid before the foundation of the world has now been given under our seven seal amen ain't that beautiful listen to this and there was only one the king and he has one sword that's his word and that's what I lived by so help me God standing over this holy desk here with his holy word laying here it's the word amen what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and the secret and he goes on and he he says it's taped and it's going everywhere and he said been seven years ago said don't try to explain this this is the third pool I'll meet you in there that's right he said don't try I was standing there with a little baby shoe when he told me said now make you first pool and course we know that being message believers the first pull was in the healing the sign in the hand and all of that that wasn't the Mysteries that was the bait on the hook to catch the bride's attention something going on because in that third pool which is the unveiling or the opening of the seals sir primarily that's what it's about to let you know the secret of your life and why these things are the way to give you a victory that could press toward and through this Satan's eating this evening when everybody else leaves the message you say why they leaving well brother brandham said right here he says Redemption is just for those that are the predestinated listen close if you didn't come from there you can't go back back there won't mean nothing to you anyway hello how I know I come from there because that pool is pulling you and it's pulling you it pulled you here this morning it's pulling you in this meeting it's pulling the every day of your life you say I'm just so full of mistakes yeah but at the end of the day he still pulling you amen no matter how tough it gets and no matter where you may have a sleepless night it's still pulling when everybody is walking away when everybody walked away from Abraham he was sitting there waiting for God to bring the promise that he had promised him and he showed up and explain to you I love this praise the Lord and he explained to him he said I just waited till you got to 100 years old wait to Sarah's womb dead wait till everything is Fallen apart you know why down the where that you can't look up and you down here said what's going on my life he's waiting that you're completely out of the way that you completely dead to self and all the unbelief and every thought where I think well I'm sorry Vindicated Prophet said you don't have no than coming boy that's pretty r a well I think no don't talk to me because I don't want hear you thinking is that all right I think you don't have no think coming that's what he said he waits to everything is so in a condition cuz he wants to show we safe yeah it was to you have no way nowh to produce this child no way to do all these things everything's dying around so you can't point to this or that or anything else and then Here Comes mck sit down sir may your hand what you going to do I'm going wash your faith everything this message is typed in Abraham's life I'm going to wash your feet I'm going to talk to you and then I'm gonna get a more portion let's go under the old o tree I like it I like to sit outside and sit under the old shade tree you say you mean to tell me brother Tim fmer God sitting on an old oak tree right there he sure was he just pulled up a seat and sit right there and he let Abraham wash his feet and he let Abraham feed eat him and he eat beef and he drunk milk and he ate cornbread sound like he kind of back woods fell God is and he sat there and he e it and he said now Abraham and brother brandham said when he said Abraham few days before that he changed him from Abram to Abraham he talked to him and when he said Abraham there's no way no one knows that that was almighty God told me I'm Abraham now oh my and the same voice was now in a man sitting under an oak tree say it's as simple as that yeah talking to him and telling him that she's getting ready to conceive and I'm going to visit you in the time of life and I'm going to give you that son and he's his name's going to be called Isaac oh my what a visitation you know what she got on board she got in the right attitude matter of fact they felt pretty good is that right cuz a few days after that their bodies changed and they went back the 20 years on and took a 100 mile Journey all way down to G then something when God speaks to you and does something you just start feeling good again now I told you I was going to close now listen as we close he stepped out to him there and he revealed to Abraham a different order a mchis DEC order that Abraham I'm the author of life I'm I'm the one I'm your all and all and your life is planned out and I knew you before there was a world and I will never leave you because you came from me and I will come to get you and I will get you out and I'll give that promise because it's me that's doing all these things and in this great hour I read to you Luke 20 uh 4 brother brandham said those that went to the road of amas it says that Jesus just stepped out of the Bush on them they were going down they were so sad they was down the dumps they knew something was going on but they couldn't put their finger on it they didn't understand it and one of my favorite messages that brother brandham preached is modern events are made clear by prophecy he just stepped on the scene and begin to take them down through the scriptures and unveiled the secret things that was in the scriptures already been written that the very of modern day events that had went on was the very things that they had witnessed and saw and so the more they went the better they felt because they said later on their hearts were burning within them as he spoke to them he said now when you start talking the word he'll show up he said just like them you're talking foolishness you're talking about riding a motorcycle ain't nothing wrong riding a motorcycle if you're talking about doing this and that he won't show up but if you're walking around talking about the word he said God will come on the scene and begin to join you and talk it right with you we talk about so much stuff and we're so negative and a Christian don't supposed to be negative so you preaching by I'm preaching about myself too is that right and we get so negative and down when the very secret of our life has been completely revealed and made plain to us that we are them we are those that God has chose before the foundation of the world because no one could see this and know this unless you were saved and why did God send a prophet and he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and he preached and he'd say listen then he saying now get you some thinking caps on this ain't what Luther preached we're not in an airplane anymore well we at astronaut age where he said that that man is controlled by an unseen power it's called radar unseen power and they know where he is yeah all the time and they can put him out there and bring him back a that wonderful bringing back so that age he was typing and bringing and at the end of this Jewish age brother Brenham said you won't hear theologians say this and you won't hear us in a Baptist Church or Theological Seminary and you won't hear it in the common vks but he said when he stepped out there it was the end of the Jewish age and I'm thinking I never know there was a Jewish age and he said they had seven Church ages in the old test never heard that in Bible College and at the end of the Jewish age listen he come to visit and he took the scriptures and these men that he was walking with there he took the seals off of the word in the Old Testament he done the very thing that he's always done at the end of an age he comes and I love this himself brother and said there was seven Church ages there now brother Brenham didn't go into full de but you can look at it and in the church ages you know we went back talk about Jezebel religion and Elijah and all the d uh David's Reign Solomon's Reign all of those those types and shadows he says was God letting out this secret little by little that's right and types and shadows coming down through there for the benefit of you oh my and that in the end time at the very end of it they didn't know what was going on the modern events and the things that kindly throwed them back he began to go through all the scriptures of Moses verse 44 Moses and the Psalms and the other and the prophets and he begin to take the lock off of them amen and he said in verse 27 here in beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded it now took expound means to explain and to bring in clear understanding ain't that beautiful what's going on brother will you find out you wasn't such a misfed after all me and you found out that everything was going on just on time was it one more quote in Christ is the mystery and we're going to close on this one I want to read you something in paragraph 102 he said now God's secret he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed what a state statement am so in the back part of God's mind not in the front part not all of these types and things is that's why it was all a big mystery but in the back part where nobody in the back part where nobody can get to that nobody knowed but him himself and as I've often told people you say why do you believe this Prophet so much because he come and told us what was on the back part of God's mind and what he'd been thinking about all the time and all of these other things are Church entity and and what we do and what was this minor things but this was a major thing amen and so in the back of his mind he said he was wanting to express himself because there wasn't even a Moon Star Adam molecule anything he W he was God but exactly wasn't God at that time I remember the first time I heard brother brandom say I had to stop back then we had tapes we had to stop it I tell my son blessed the words everywhere now it's supposed to be that way you got it on your phone you got it on the computer you got it on YouTube you got it everywhere you got it in pamphlets you got it in books the the preacher reads it to you the words are all over you it should be a rapturing face somewh it should be a rapturing Grace is that right but we have it everywhere but back then you had a few books of this you had to stop what did he say there anybody ever done that and that Dad burn it devil I run it back and next thing I know it run into the tape recorder here I was with the tape out yeah no a little pencil T me an IR I we can just tap it and search and put it in how blessed you are young people how blessed you are today how you have access right at your fingertips you're an astronaut age you think that astronaut don't have what he needs all he knows what he's doing he understands he knows about it all he can fly on airplane he knows about the instruments he knows where he's at he knows where he's going he knows why He's there for so he wasn't exactly God at that time because God is an object of worship and so when he brought Angels around him he was worshiped right so in his great mind say great mind with me he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes that we you see already expressed they were in God so my opinion uh the first thing he made was angels and they worshiped him and he made him God and he started from there what a secret what a message amen did you ever know that God started right there what doing and planning what he's done for this day now would you stand with me and we sure do appreciate you if the musicians would [Music] come and as they're coming as Abraham received and he had a visitation from mizing and Paul and revealing it and saying that mzed met Abraham fed him communion done all those things he could only take us so far and brother Brenham brings it down to our day and he tells us everything and you see the evidences of what God is doing and then he brings before he goes off the sing and if you listen one of my favorite series February of 1965 in which he preaches a man running from the presence of the Lord and He preached the seed shall not be our with the Shook and he preaches marriage and divorce and he preaches who is this mckisic what he talking about brother Tim he's now what God's mind he's now talking to the bride church as usual is over [Music] now our worship would be different now matter of fact when he look back on you seen that clock now only Prophet don't never try this cuz you ain't a [Music] prophet he said that clock says 2:00 he said the second pull is over and the third pull is at hand and to show you where we should be he said did you notice when the sun gets on it went up an [Music] octave he said so we
