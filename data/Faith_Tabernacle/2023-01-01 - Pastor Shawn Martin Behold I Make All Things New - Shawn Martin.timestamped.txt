[40:21] prayer
[40:22] we ask that you would just bless the
[40:24] ministering of your word this morning
[40:27] we leave this service into your hands
[40:29] now
[40:30] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[40:33] says
[40:35] amen
[40:36] if you'd like to turn again Revelations
[40:39] the 21st chapter
[40:42] and um
[40:45] I'm going to start at the first verse
[40:49] but it says and I saw a new Heaven
[40:52] and the new Earth
[40:54] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[40:57] were passed away
[40:59] and there was no more sea
[41:02] and I John saw the holy city New
[41:05] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[41:07] Heaven prepared as a bride
[41:10] adorned for her husband
[41:14] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[41:16] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[41:19] with men and he will dwell with them and
[41:22] they shall be his people
[41:24] God himself shall be with them and be
[41:27] their God
[41:29] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[41:32] their eyes there should be no more death
[41:35] no more neither sorrow nor crying
[41:38] neither shall there be any more pain for
[41:41] the former things that passed away
[41:45] and he that set upon the throne said
[41:47] behold I make all things new
[41:50] and he said unto me right
[41:52] for these words are true and faithful
[41:57] amen you can have your seats this
[41:59] morning
[42:03] it's hard to believe that we're here in
[42:06] the year of 2023
[42:09] and never thought that we would be this
[42:13] far
[42:14] in the year
[42:16] 2000 there but here we are and it seems
[42:21] like the years
[42:22] are just going by so quickly
[42:26] the man just uh
[42:29] just just everything going
[42:33] and
[42:35] but here
[42:36] I thought of this quote brother Branham
[42:39] he said we we faced this year
[42:42] just like we do all years
[42:45] there is a regret of our mistakes in the
[42:48] past
[42:50] and are looking forward
[42:52] for a future of the Glorious Light of
[42:55] Christ
[42:57] no doubt if we live through this year
[42:59] we'll find many mistakes that we have
[43:01] made and we just expect that
[43:04] because it goes along with the pro and
[43:07] con
[43:08] that's the law of average that we live
[43:11] by here in this life
[43:12] but we're so glad
[43:15] we have a mediator
[43:17] who sits at the right hand of God to
[43:20] make intercessions aren't you glad for
[43:22] that
[43:24] he says when we are willing to admit our
[43:26] mistakes that we've done wrong then he
[43:28] forgives them
[43:30] he is full of grace and mercy to forgive
[43:34] us
[43:34] for those mistakes
[43:38] now I've just thought of this this new
[43:40] year and and I'm just be simple this
[43:43] morning but
[43:44] the new year to some may just be another
[43:47] year
[43:49] um you know the doing away with the old
[43:52] calendar and and putting up a new one
[43:55] and whatever and and then
[43:59] there's a lot of people today that's
[44:01] entering the New Year wandering
[44:04] about the future of our country
[44:07] wondering you know what the future holds
[44:10] for them
[44:11] and or for the world for that matter
[44:15] because everything is so uncertain right
[44:18] now
[44:19] and so you know there may be some that
[44:22] are wondering about the future of their
[44:25] job wondering about the future of the
[44:28] economy wondering about the future of
[44:30] retirement will there be anything left
[44:33] in retirement time it's all said and
[44:36] done and and so uh but
[44:40] one thing that that every year new year
[44:45] seems to do
[44:47] uh to people and that is to cause them
[44:51] to want change
[44:53] everybody wants change
[44:57] um and of course it's it's for the
[44:59] better and and I guess that's because
[45:03] the new year
[45:04] uh is is a new beginning and it's a new
[45:09] beginning and so everybody wants to uh
[45:13] foreign
[45:15] be identified with that beginning that's
[45:18] new and
[45:21] um you know uh as the prophet would
[45:24] describe it he said the old year has
[45:26] died
[45:27] and another year has been born
[45:32] and so we we
[45:34] want what we were in that past year to
[45:39] die with it
[45:40] and we want to be new and start Things
[45:45] New afresh in in the new year that is is
[45:50] here upon us with the New Year comes new
[45:54] expectations new hopes
[45:57] and dreams are born
[46:00] and uh because people again want to be
[46:04] identified
[46:06] uh uh with the new and uh it it you know
[46:11] it's it's uh uh New Year's resolutions
[46:15] are made uh always made during this time
[46:21] um vows promises to be better
[46:25] um you know
[46:27] I uh uh I I've made them type of uh
[46:33] things too you know mine was to lose
[46:36] weight you know beginning of year you
[46:39] know and and well why didn't you do it
[46:41] you know a month in December oh we'll
[46:44] wait New Year's coming and uh so we we
[46:48] are going to start off fresh new year
[46:50] but
[46:51] it's uh you know as I uh anyway you
[46:56] could tell that failed a lot and so uh
[47:00] turning over a new Leaf um uh uh a new
[47:05] page as the prophet would call it but
[47:08] people want to be different than they
[47:10] were last year they they they they want
[47:14] to have a better life they they want to
[47:17] be a better person
[47:18] people promises every year I'm going to
[47:22] quit lying I'm I'm going to quit
[47:24] stealing I'm I'm going to quit cheating
[47:27] on my spouse I'm I'm I'm going to be
[47:30] better I I'm going to quit the smoking
[47:32] I'm going to quit drinking I'm you know
[47:35] it's it's these things and and even we
[47:39] find ourselves I'm gonna do more for God
[47:41] and and and and these things and so uh
[47:46] it seems like many many people enter the
[47:50] the new year with good intentions and
[47:54] then you hear the prophet say but hell
[47:56] is paved with good intentions
[47:59] and and and so uh uh change change
[48:05] doesn't come by making a New Year's
[48:09] resolution uh because I'm a witness you
[48:13] go back to being what you were
[48:16] uh it it can never change you in that
[48:20] way uh and so this is why uh we don't we
[48:25] don't believe in making New Year's
[48:27] resolutions we we we don't believe in
[48:30] turning over a new Leaf or or whatever
[48:34] you would call it uh because they don't
[48:38] work
[48:39] uh it's it's basically uh the old person
[48:44] entering into another year and the year
[48:48] begins and the person
[48:51] uh uh that that we're entering uh
[48:55] there's nothing new that happens with
[48:57] them and and so they go back to the you
[49:01] know it's about this time of the year
[49:02] that the gym even gets uh full I mean
[49:05] packed and and so you kind of wait until
[49:08] about a month or two and and uh then you
[49:11] get your spot back you know but uh
[49:14] because it it just don't last it
[49:18] resolutions and things like that and and
[49:21] so uh in order for Change and and uh I
[49:26] guess this is this is just I'm dealing
[49:30] with change uh being it is the new year
[49:33] but in order for that to happen a man
[49:36] must meet God face to face
[49:40] uh that's just and and and and have
[49:43] eternal life and be filled with the
[49:46] spirit and and of course I'm talking of
[49:48] a a greater change than than just uh
[49:52] going on a diet or a greater change than
[49:56] just uh getting more money or a better
[49:59] job or or whatever
[50:01] uh because the the change that I would
[50:06] say most most people in the world uh has
[50:11] to do with the spiritual side of it uh
[50:14] uh and and of wanting to be changed they
[50:17] they want to be a better individual a
[50:20] better citizen a better a better husband
[50:23] a better wife a better child
[50:27] everything there and so it this this
[50:31] type of change is the only way that that
[50:34] that change can come is is by meeting
[50:37] God and and brother the Branham even
[50:41] talks about the man that just couldn't
[50:42] make up his mind you know uh he he
[50:46] wanted but he wanted to go but he just
[50:49] the devil just kept beating him up uh
[50:51] just constantly beating him out of it
[50:53] and and so the the prophet said that one
[50:56] day he just got out in the field and
[50:58] knelt down to pray and he said while he
[51:01] was praying he just drove down a he
[51:05] called it a stop and and said let this
[51:07] be a memorial Satan if you ever come to
[51:10] me again I'm going to point you to this
[51:12] stop and I'll tell you that right here I
[51:16] met God and he said and it was settled
[51:19] from there on
[51:21] now that's the change that's the change
[51:23] that we that that that a person needs is
[51:27] when he meets God face to face and we've
[51:31] got a Bible full of stories of men and
[51:34] women that met God face to face and they
[51:37] they were never the same again never the
[51:42] same ain't that right and so uh you're
[51:45] changed when you meet God and brother
[51:48] Brown said it's not it's not turn a new
[51:50] page but actually die and be born again
[51:54] if if a man wants change if you young
[51:58] people want change You Gotta Die and be
[52:02] born again he said you got to feel so
[52:05] guilty when you stand in his presence
[52:08] and and to be honest that's where people
[52:11] are lacking is they they don't feel the
[52:14] guilt amen they want change but they
[52:17] don't feel the guilt uh uh they make
[52:19] excuses and and these things as to why
[52:23] they do what they do instead of just
[52:25] coming into the presence of God and
[52:28] humbling themselves and and just filling
[52:31] the guilt ain't that right amen and and
[52:34] so he says you you got to feel so guilty
[52:37] when you stand in his presence whether
[52:40] you go to the Methodist Way Baptist way
[52:42] whatever way you go you've got to be so
[52:45] guilty and feel so guilty till it'll
[52:49] kill you that's right it'll kill you
[52:51] your worldly life will die right there
[52:54] you've got to reckon yourself so guilty
[52:58] in the presence of God until your
[53:01] worldly life dies right there I mean so
[53:05] tired of it so and and and you you you
[53:08] you come and and that's how you approach
[53:11] it when you meet God can you say man and
[53:14] and so uh uh uh the sin questions over
[53:19] for you when you're standing ending in
[53:22] his presence when you look like that
[53:24] you're sure to live see because you die
[53:27] and the only way you can live again is
[53:31] to die first so you can live again ain't
[53:36] that right but but you know today these
[53:40] days the world is looking for change as
[53:42] a whole the world is looking for change
[53:45] in in to be honest the change is
[53:48] Shifting we we see it we see in it more
[53:52] and more now the prophet talked about it
[53:53] how they're passing laws and all these
[53:55] things but today we're actually seeing
[53:58] the shift in the the change now you had
[54:02] one uh man a president uh that was
[54:05] America America and we found that didn't
[54:08] last long amen because laws and
[54:12] everything the regime's already set in
[54:14] place amen they don't want America they
[54:17] they want a One World Government they
[54:20] don't want identity the individual
[54:22] identity they want everything to come
[54:25] together and and so they they the world
[54:28] is is looking for change they want
[54:31] change in politics and it's happening
[54:33] they they want change in society it's
[54:37] happening they want change in the
[54:40] government it's happening and they want
[54:42] change in their churches and it's
[54:45] happening change like never before is
[54:49] happening but why do they want change is
[54:52] because they are dissatisfied amen if
[54:56] you were satisfied you wouldn't want
[54:58] change but uh uh because people are
[55:02] dissatisfied then they they want change
[55:05] they'll they'll change churches they'll
[55:08] change schools they'll change you know
[55:10] some of them even have changed
[55:12] citizenship they're tired of America and
[55:15] believe it or not they go somewhere else
[55:16] and live and identify as as another uh
[55:21] citizen of another country and and then
[55:24] you've got people that is flocking over
[55:25] into America because they don't like
[55:27] where they're at today or or where
[55:30] they're from and so they're coming and
[55:32] but everybody wants chains there's such
[55:35] an unrest of change uh uh and they're
[55:38] calling for it a man and and I thought
[55:41] of this
[55:42] um of why why are people so dissatisfied
[55:46] and and in Romans 8 and 19. Paul says
[55:51] the earnest expectation
[55:53] weighteth of the creature waited for the
[55:56] manifestation of the sons of God so this
[55:59] is giving us an answer for the creature
[56:02] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[56:05] but by reason of him who has subjected
[56:08] the same in Hope because the creature
[56:11] itself also shall be delivered from the
[56:15] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[56:18] Liberty of the children of God for we
[56:22] know that the whole creation grownness
[56:26] and travaileth in pain together until
[56:29] now think of that so the the the nature
[56:33] the Earth uh all creation is groaning
[56:37] you there there cannot be a man woman
[56:40] boy or girl uh there cannot be any type
[56:43] of a living thing that exists up on the
[56:46] earth uh uh without some type of a
[56:50] groaning amen because that's what the
[56:52] Bible says that the whole creation
[56:54] groans and travaleth together until now
[56:58] ain't that right amen they're groaning
[57:01] now the prophet goes more into this and
[57:04] says why why he says something's lost
[57:07] and it's groaning ain't that right it's
[57:11] trying to get back to be to its original
[57:14] condition trees want to go back to its
[57:18] original condition the world wants to go
[57:20] back to its original Crea condition the
[57:24] Stars the moon the the Sun at everything
[57:27] is groaning that Little Flower wants to
[57:30] go back to its its original condition
[57:33] you understand what I'm saying a man and
[57:36] man even though they don't understand
[57:37] why they want the change it's just
[57:40] something that is calling out a man to
[57:43] go back ain't that right and and they're
[57:46] putting their interest they're putting
[57:48] all their stuff in the wrong places they
[57:50] want to save America but that's not the
[57:53] original condition they they they want
[57:56] to save the Democracy let us listen to
[57:58] brother Branham today he said democracy
[58:01] has come to its end it's it's served its
[58:04] purpose but it wasn't the answer
[58:06] kingdoms have served its purpose but
[58:08] look where they're at today and so is it
[58:11] with democracy ain't that right so he
[58:14] says see is trying to get back to its
[58:17] original condition would you imagine uh
[58:20] someone fear falling from the earth down
[58:24] into a deep pit somewhere and was
[58:26] struggling climbing pulling they must by
[58:31] some means get out of this pit why
[58:33] they're not in their original state and
[58:37] frantically they're screaming they're
[58:39] they're clawing the walls making a noise
[58:42] or doing some way see they're groaning
[58:46] because that they want to get back to
[58:49] their original state as when a person is
[58:52] struck with disease aches and pains and
[58:55] one time they wasn't that way but
[58:57] they're groaning why they're not right
[59:00] see something's wrong and they're
[59:02] groaning and trying to get back to where
[59:05] they was when they had health and when
[59:09] Nature and people as the Bible says are
[59:11] groaning it shows there's something that
[59:15] they're not in there
[59:17] ought to be conditioned they've fallen
[59:20] from some Wares ain't that right a man
[59:23] sold the world and and and I'm I'm glad
[59:26] that the prophet would uh or that God
[59:29] opened our eyes to to this message that
[59:33] we can understand why people want change
[59:36] why why they're so miserable and now
[59:39] church WIll you know well the poor man
[59:41] you know the poor man looks at the rich
[59:43] man says oh if I could just be that but
[59:46] you get there and look at the rich man's
[59:48] life and he's just as miserable as
[59:50] anybody else because money can't satisfy
[59:53] the car uh uh can't satisfy the the
[59:57] thousand dollar suits can't satisfy amen
[1:00:01] the the million dollar jobs can't
[1:00:03] satisfy you understand where we're at
[1:00:06] see Fame Fortune can't satisfy because
[1:00:10] we're not in the right condition amen
[1:00:13] our rightful place and so we know what
[1:00:16] the prophet said that it was eternal
[1:00:18] life that man fell from a man and and so
[1:00:22] we lost our claims on eternal life by
[1:00:26] the fall of Adam and Eve and uh who fell
[1:00:30] the prophet said from eternal life to
[1:00:33] death in the Garden of Eden and brought
[1:00:36] all nature all nature amen not just
[1:00:40] humans but the trees the flowers the the
[1:00:43] animals it brought all nature under
[1:00:46] death with them ain't that right so uh a
[1:00:50] tree never died before Adam a flower
[1:00:52] never died before Adam a bird never
[1:00:55] never died uh uh no nothing ever died
[1:01:00] before Adam amen but but now all we see
[1:01:04] is death everything is death man's
[1:01:07] inventions death uh man's success it
[1:01:11] just only dies a man rises in Fame only
[1:01:15] to die everything about him just dies
[1:01:18] ain't that right amen but there's only
[1:01:21] one thing that can never die it will
[1:01:24] never die and that's God for he is
[1:01:27] eternal ain't that right he he is
[1:01:30] eternal and and the prophet said that's
[1:01:32] the only way that we we can ever keep
[1:01:35] from dying now I I like that here
[1:01:38] because then that means we can face this
[1:01:41] year amen and never have to worry about
[1:01:44] being what we were last year you
[1:01:46] understand that church a man see the
[1:01:49] only way that we can ever keep from
[1:01:51] dying we have to have eternal life in us
[1:01:54] to be Sons and Daughters of God so you
[1:01:58] know what that means to be Sons and
[1:01:59] Daughters of God it's not big because
[1:02:01] you go to a message church it's not
[1:02:03] because you you know you think different
[1:02:06] than than somebody else it's it's it's
[1:02:09] not because of whatever it's it's
[1:02:12] because uh uh you have that eternal life
[1:02:15] that's that's the only way that can make
[1:02:17] you a son and daughter of God ain't that
[1:02:19] right and if you've got eternal life
[1:02:21] that shows that you eat we're Eternal in
[1:02:24] his thoughts in the first place so so it
[1:02:27] goes to show that you never was saved on
[1:02:30] any given day you always were saved amen
[1:02:33] and God put that Eternal seed in you
[1:02:36] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:02:39] and when you receive leave the holy
[1:02:41] ghost that Eternal seed become a quicken
[1:02:43] in this old body ain't that right so we
[1:02:47] find that lawmakers you know are passing
[1:02:49] laws that will help make the change that
[1:02:52] they think is needed uh the churches are
[1:02:55] are are joining together so to bring on
[1:02:59] the change that they think is needed and
[1:03:03] and and uh uh laws are being passed in
[1:03:06] denominational rims and and and these
[1:03:10] things and and and and the leaders you
[1:03:13] know uh uh as as you see I think it was
[1:03:16] the Methodist Church that people you
[1:03:19] know are breaking away from it and and
[1:03:21] because somebody's wanting to change and
[1:03:25] and and so they're they're they're
[1:03:27] enforcing these things a man and in most
[1:03:30] churches we we win uh Heather and I went
[1:03:34] uh last year I think up up uh
[1:03:37] Massachusetts way and and up there and
[1:03:40] and uh I so disgusted you know
[1:03:44] um we didn't know it we come right at
[1:03:46] the time of the celebration of
[1:03:48] homosexuals and oh wow I saw Ray come
[1:03:52] home I was so sick I just the
[1:03:55] ungodliness and but you go drive around
[1:03:57] and every church had a rainbow flag and
[1:04:00] I thought God have mercy where are we at
[1:04:03] you know I'm gonna go home but but you
[1:04:06] know it's because they're looking for
[1:04:08] change as as they think it will make
[1:04:11] things better ain't that right and so
[1:04:14] but the unregenerate man is always
[1:04:18] trying to bring change without going
[1:04:21] God's provided way amen God's got to
[1:04:24] change God God's got a promise a change
[1:04:27] but but they don't want God's way of
[1:04:30] change and so they're going to try to
[1:04:32] bring change on their self but here's
[1:04:35] the problem Romans 8 and 7 it says the
[1:04:38] carnal mind is enmity against God so the
[1:04:42] the what they're working for for change
[1:04:45] is actually contrary to what God's idea
[1:04:48] of change should be for it is not
[1:04:51] subject to the law of God the word of
[1:04:54] God neither indeed can be I I think
[1:04:57] that's why it's so important not to try
[1:05:00] to bring change on your own a man that
[1:05:03] wait upon the Lord to bring the change
[1:05:06] ain't that right let the Lord because if
[1:05:09] it's if it's in his will the change will
[1:05:12] come but the moment you try to put your
[1:05:14] hands upon it the moment you try to make
[1:05:17] it happen in your own will in your own
[1:05:19] carnal thinking and your own you say but
[1:05:22] it it seems good and you've got it all
[1:05:24] figured out but if it's against God's
[1:05:26] way if it's against God's will that
[1:05:29] change will come to not you you'll just
[1:05:32] be working against the laws of God Amen
[1:05:35] and brother Brown even speaking of
[1:05:37] Florida you all know what he said about
[1:05:40] Florida and he said you know when I
[1:05:42] crossed and went in Florida the first
[1:05:44] time and come back to Georgia Line there
[1:05:47] I stood there and I've said as American
[1:05:49] citizen I give my part back of it to the
[1:05:53] Seminoles where it belongs you know and
[1:05:55] he says why they take care of their
[1:05:57] yards uh better than I do my hair you
[1:06:01] know and everything feather edged and
[1:06:03] the palm trees has got lights all over
[1:06:06] it and big Swanky yachts and everything
[1:06:08] but notice what he says they're trying
[1:06:10] to bring a millennium without repentance
[1:06:17] thing there's that change again they're
[1:06:20] they're looking for chains there's that
[1:06:22] groaning a man but they're trying to
[1:06:25] bring a millennium without God's
[1:06:26] provided way amen but there is going to
[1:06:29] be a millennium we don't have to worry
[1:06:31] about that can you say man for those
[1:06:34] that have taken God's provided way so so
[1:06:38] we find this is why the scripture says
[1:06:42] there in Romans to be carnally minded is
[1:06:45] death and and to be spiritually minded
[1:06:48] is life and peace amen we don't want to
[1:06:52] go through this year carnally minded
[1:06:55] serving God with our carnal mind trying
[1:06:57] to bring change with our carnal mind it
[1:07:00] ain't gonna work it'll just produce
[1:07:02] death amen but to be spiritually minded
[1:07:05] is life and peace
[1:07:08] can you say man so now they're they're
[1:07:12] looking for change but yet the people of
[1:07:14] this world has no guarantee a man in all
[1:07:18] they're changing that they're doing has
[1:07:20] no guarantee a man that will bring peace
[1:07:23] upon the Earth they'll have no guarantee
[1:07:25] that'll make us better uh uh people they
[1:07:29] they have no guarantee that it's going
[1:07:32] to do away with the evil and you know
[1:07:34] good and well they're trying to do away
[1:07:36] with the evil amen any anything that
[1:07:39] goes against what their their agenda is
[1:07:42] and what they're doing again and uh and
[1:07:45] it's getting worse and you know that
[1:07:47] amen they're uh uh and we don't I'm not
[1:07:51] getting into the politics of it but
[1:07:52] anyone that knows the uh the politics
[1:07:56] and all these things you know what's
[1:07:58] happening they're putting people into
[1:07:59] jail and and all that because they
[1:08:02] didn't go along with the chains that
[1:08:03] they're wanting and and it's just a
[1:08:06] bunch of nonsense but we we find that in
[1:08:10] this change they're putting their energy
[1:08:12] into it they're they're spending
[1:08:15] billions and billions of dollars in the
[1:08:18] in into uh uh uh uh what what would that
[1:08:22] word be tests um uh trying things out
[1:08:25] you know inventions and things amen
[1:08:28] because they want change that's what
[1:08:30] they're after they the the they want
[1:08:33] chains they they want to take away the
[1:08:35] gas trucks and and and bring in the
[1:08:38] electric and everything what is they
[1:08:40] call that green green something you know
[1:08:42] and uh uh but but it's because they want
[1:08:46] change they want to you know they want
[1:08:47] the climate to be better the atmosphere
[1:08:49] global warming and all of these things
[1:08:51] they're worried about all these things
[1:08:53] right and and so we we got to change it
[1:08:57] before we we we lose uh uh the world
[1:09:01] right and so you've got all these think
[1:09:04] tanks and men that are pouring money and
[1:09:07] and their time their energy and
[1:09:09] scientists under the pressure of trying
[1:09:12] to fix all of these things just for a
[1:09:15] better change but it'll never be right
[1:09:18] it'll never be it'll never happen it
[1:09:20] ain't going to happen now now I know
[1:09:23] we're dumb people I've never been to
[1:09:25] college and all that but I can tell you
[1:09:26] this it ain't going to happen I can tell
[1:09:28] the brightest individual the most
[1:09:30] wealthiest individual in their think
[1:09:33] tanks and and all these things up on the
[1:09:35] earth it ain't going to happen can you
[1:09:38] say amen I don't either go to college I
[1:09:40] don't need to know the math about it I
[1:09:41] don't even know that a prophet said
[1:09:43] it'll never never happen America is
[1:09:47] doomed the world is doomed ain't that
[1:09:49] right and so this ain't the change that
[1:09:52] that we're looking for as long as we are
[1:09:55] Mortals there will always be corruption
[1:09:58] there will always be sin and death there
[1:10:01] will always be wars and rumors of wars
[1:10:04] there there will always be sickness pain
[1:10:07] and headache and heartache and and and
[1:10:10] and you know the more they try to change
[1:10:13] things the worse it gets and you know
[1:10:17] good and well that's that's what it is
[1:10:18] they've messed with their foods and man
[1:10:21] becomes weaker amen man becomes sicker
[1:10:24] man becomes more uh uh uh
[1:10:28] um that he just becomes more vulnerable
[1:10:30] to diseases and more vulnerable to to
[1:10:34] all of the the nonsense that's out here
[1:10:36] you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:10:38] because they got better ways they got
[1:10:40] better ways to raise your child you know
[1:10:42] I thought it was kind of funny you know
[1:10:43] someone had put up a a thing of way
[1:10:46] children were raised in in in
[1:10:49] um you know uh in the 70s of when when I
[1:10:52] was raised and I just I thought man I
[1:10:54] felt at home you know uh you know uh
[1:10:57] Mama back then if you got your face
[1:10:59] dirty

[1:11:19] a stomach full of them and uh you know
[1:11:21] they've you know some people say well
[1:11:22] you're full of baloney no roly-poly yeah
[1:11:25] roly-polies for me you know but but I I
[1:11:28] ate them man that was that was a thing

[1:11:33] roly-poly take him to the hospital get
[1:11:34] that thing his stomach pumped out and
[1:11:36] and all of these things man you know
[1:11:39] they want and change but look where it's
[1:11:42] putting us
[1:11:44] weaker
[1:11:47] ain't that right
[1:11:50] it's true and and and you get someone
[1:11:53] with the coat no one wants to go to
[1:11:54] church because that person probably got
[1:11:56] a code and and we all get it right you
[1:11:59] know it's just that's just the way it is
[1:12:00] but you know when we were sick we never
[1:12:03] missed church it was just you go to
[1:12:05] church you know and and that's just the
[1:12:07] way it was and and I I know you know
[1:12:10] even even as a baby I was a sickly child
[1:12:14] and and what was what was interesting is
[1:12:18] my dad's in there getting ready for
[1:12:20] church shaving my mom screams during
[1:12:23] during come and he comes running through
[1:12:25] there and here I am on the bed eyes
[1:12:28] rolled back blue whatever not breathing
[1:12:31] and and you know we didn't have cell
[1:12:35] phones and all that they just got
[1:12:37] together and they laid hands on me and
[1:12:39] started started I started breathing and
[1:12:42] mom didn't say well Darren I'm going to
[1:12:43] stay home just in case no they they took
[1:12:46] me to church you know and and they're
[1:12:48] worshiping the Lord just glorifying God
[1:12:50] and it's sister Taps mom on the shoulder
[1:12:53] and looks down and there I am again just
[1:12:55] as limp as a dish Rag and and and blue
[1:12:58] eyes rolled back not breathing and my
[1:13:01] mom you know she doesn't say I just knew
[1:13:03] it I should have stayed home you know no
[1:13:06] she she grabbed me up and there I am
[1:13:08] just as limp as limp can be and and she
[1:13:10] ran up to the front said pray pray for
[1:13:13] my baby and the church got together and
[1:13:15] God brought life back into this body and
[1:13:17] and and but then were the days right we
[1:13:20] we just today if we just have to blow
[1:13:22] the nose you know everybody stays home
[1:13:24] and you know there's a there was a kid
[1:13:26] you know there's that song excuses
[1:13:28] excuses and and you hear them every day
[1:13:30] and I heard that when I was a kid and I
[1:13:32] I thought it was funny now I find it's
[1:13:34] true you know uh uh everybody just stays
[1:13:37] home because that little old baby or
[1:13:39] whatever see but but it's because
[1:13:42] they're looking for change amen the
[1:13:45] world is changing our our thought
[1:13:48] pattern they're changing our ideology
[1:13:50] their changing sad to say they're
[1:13:52] changing convictions they're changing
[1:13:54] Faith they're changing everything of how
[1:13:57] we view this Bible can you say man they
[1:14:00] put science they put education they put
[1:14:02] they put everything before us to where
[1:14:05] we the the the the the the the nominal
[1:14:08] believer a man lose the sight of the
[1:14:11] promises of God and they accept change
[1:14:14] that only makes it worse
[1:14:17] can you say man I'm not against
[1:14:18] medication and all that jazz you know
[1:14:20] I'm just telling you amen and brother
[1:14:23] Brown just plainly tells us that Faith
[1:14:25] would be slow in this this day ain't
[1:14:28] that right so we we find that the the
[1:14:32] the more they they try to to change
[1:14:35] things for the better the more evil the
[1:14:38] more wicked the more sickly amen the
[1:14:41] world becomes and and and so we're we're
[1:14:44] living and and you know uh uh you you
[1:14:48] have if you listen to the prophet yeah
[1:14:50] at any time you know that we're living
[1:14:53] in the age of Isaiah's prophecy where
[1:14:58] Darkness would fill the Earth and gross
[1:15:02] Darkness the people Darkness covering
[1:15:05] the Earth and and we're living in that
[1:15:07] fulfillment right Darkness covering the
[1:15:10] Earth amen gross Darkness the people go
[1:15:13] listen to Shalom and brother Branham
[1:15:15] will explain the attitude of the people
[1:15:17] and why why he explains everything to us
[1:15:22] of why the people are acting the way
[1:15:25] they're acting doing what they're doing
[1:15:27] and and and you can talk to them and and
[1:15:30] there's nothing there nothing it's like
[1:15:32] no one's home and and and these things
[1:15:35] and he says what it is good people nice
[1:15:38] people amen but he said it's the gross
[1:15:41] Darkness they want to do it but gross
[1:15:43] Darkness keeps them from it you
[1:15:46] understand so this is where we're at and
[1:15:48] brother Brown says these great big
[1:15:50] things coming up is bringing them right
[1:15:54] into more darkness and more darkness and
[1:15:59] and I have to say I I think technology
[1:16:01] is playing a big deal in this I I think
[1:16:04] everything that they're coming up in
[1:16:06] science and they're coming up with all
[1:16:08] these things it's numbing to people's
[1:16:10] hearts it's numbing them that you know
[1:16:12] they watch in the movies they're
[1:16:14] watching the all these killings and the
[1:16:16] death saying the the nonsense the
[1:16:19] foolishness and and and anybody can get
[1:16:22] popularity by just making a dumb stupid
[1:16:24] video these days and everybody gets a he
[1:16:27] gets a big hole following amen because
[1:16:29] he does something stupid and and and you
[1:16:32] just like good Lord why don't the guy
[1:16:34] get him a good job amen you know we got
[1:16:37] McDonald's out there at least you can
[1:16:39] make some money and and and and do it
[1:16:41] you know uh uh be a good citizen be good
[1:16:44] productive you understand what I'm
[1:16:45] saying but it's gross Darkness it's it's
[1:16:48] just there and it's in and these things
[1:16:51] this technology this all these
[1:16:53] inventions and and and I appreciate them
[1:16:56] all they've been a great help amen uh
[1:16:58] but at the same time amen you you have
[1:17:01] to understand it's sucking people in and
[1:17:04] and as the prophet said these great big
[1:17:06] things coming up is bringing them right
[1:17:09] into more darkness and more Darkness
[1:17:12] people don't think about God anymore
[1:17:14] because they're on their dumb phone amen
[1:17:16] and looking at the YouTubes looking at
[1:17:19] the videos looking at this Quirk and
[1:17:21] that comedy and this and that and and
[1:17:24] and no one's got any time for God before
[1:17:27] you know it you've spent all them hours
[1:17:29] on the phone you spend all them hours on
[1:17:31] the internet you spend all of them hours
[1:17:34] you ain't got time for family you ain't
[1:17:36] got time for reading the Bible you ain't
[1:17:38] got time for prayer you ain't got time
[1:17:40] now and and I'm just going to be honest
[1:17:42] with you it's bringing more and more
[1:17:44] Darkness over the people's minds amen
[1:17:46] that's right and then they come to
[1:17:48] church and they can't see the word
[1:17:49] because the word doesn't affect them
[1:17:51] they're more affected amen by what they
[1:17:53] saw on that dumb phone and what they saw
[1:17:56] on the videos and what they saw on all
[1:17:59] of that no wonder they're they're
[1:18:01] getting so soft in their faith amen when
[1:18:03] someone looks at them wrong they're mad
[1:18:05] ready to change and everybody's looking
[1:18:08] for change these days and it doesn't
[1:18:10] take much to offend people these days to
[1:18:13] where they go somewhere else to look for
[1:18:14] change
[1:18:16] you understand what I'm saying now the
[1:18:18] prophet's saying it real close and real
[1:18:19] real strong it's these things coming up
[1:18:23] now he's saying that in 63 and here we
[1:18:26] are amen now entering in 23. oh my amen
[1:18:31] say 63 and we're here in 22
[1:18:35] 2023. amen and so it's bringing them
[1:18:39] things right into more darkness and more
[1:18:42] darkness and God declaring it in his
[1:18:45] word by signs and wonders and things in
[1:18:48] the heavens showing foretelling the
[1:18:51] things that happens just exactly to the
[1:18:53] hour and to the minute what would take
[1:18:55] place and then they continually walk
[1:18:58] right on the same way looks like he says
[1:19:01] it looks like they just can't help it
[1:19:02] good people yes sir doing the same thing
[1:19:06] now as they done back then in Jesus's
[1:19:08] day can you say amen amen so so here we
[1:19:12] are they're wanting change but they're
[1:19:15] in grossed darkness that they can't see
[1:19:18] what God is doing he they can't see the
[1:19:22] change that God is bringing on you
[1:19:24] understand what I'm saying amen there is
[1:19:27] a bride that is standing on her feet
[1:19:29] something happened something changed
[1:19:32] amen and they miss it the world looking
[1:19:35] for chains and they don't realize amen
[1:19:37] something changed within this bride amen
[1:19:40] she's not an infant child church anymore
[1:19:42] she's standing on her feet amen with the
[1:19:46] glory of God with the Dynamics of God
[1:19:48] within her can you say man it's a change
[1:19:51] that God has done and the world can't
[1:19:55] see it and they're crying out for
[1:19:57] Revival because they want change and yet
[1:19:59] God brought a prophet Amen to bring
[1:20:02] change to his church
[1:20:08] we find
[1:20:10] that what the world actually calls
[1:20:13] change is nothing but a repeat
[1:20:16] of what has been in history
[1:20:19] for the Bible tells us Ecclesiastes 1 9.
[1:20:23] the thing that has been
[1:20:25] it is that which shall be and that which
[1:20:28] is done is that which shall be done
[1:20:32] and there is no new thing under the sun
[1:20:36] is there anything aware of it may be
[1:20:39] said see this is new
[1:20:41] it has been already of old time
[1:20:44] which was before us
[1:20:46] so that's why the prophet would tell us
[1:20:48] or the Bible
[1:20:50] a man as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:20:52] shall it be as it was in the days of lot
[1:20:55] so shall it be everything is is just a
[1:21:00] repeat history repeat ain't that right
[1:21:03] that's that's right see now you know uh
[1:21:06] just think of the the way people wear
[1:21:08] clothes
[1:21:09] and and the style of clothes there's
[1:21:13] always a repeat of it right and always a
[1:21:15] repeat you know and and uh I I remember
[1:21:18] you know uh my grandpa he wore them fat
[1:21:22] ties and real real wide ties and I
[1:21:25] remember when the skinny ties came out
[1:21:27] you know it was a new fad you know but
[1:21:30] before long here come the big white ties
[1:21:32] again you know and and it went from the
[1:21:35] shoes then it come to cleats in your in
[1:21:37] or uh I think it's what is that cleats
[1:21:39] in in your in your uh pants you know
[1:21:42] what is it
[1:21:45] pleats yeah cleats are for shoes right
[1:21:48] okay
[1:21:50] you don't yeah creases but
[1:21:54] it was funny because yeah uh
[1:22:00] I guess if you got ran over by cleats
[1:22:04] you'd see it in your pants
[1:22:07] but
[1:22:10] I I like cleats cleats
[1:22:13] but you know I remember before them
[1:22:15] pleats come out when I was a kid it was
[1:22:18] straight
[1:22:20] then the plates come out and I really
[1:22:22] like them that's my style
[1:22:25] then here they come again with straight
[1:22:28] now my
[1:22:30] Judah 12 was talking about last night he
[1:22:32] says I hate pleats
[1:22:34] I hate them
[1:22:36] and I'm like
[1:22:38] what
[1:22:40] I like them
[1:22:43] well you give it another time
[1:22:45] generational come
[1:22:48] out and the pleats will be back out
[1:22:50] and his son will go man I hate great
[1:22:53] pants
[1:22:54] you know
[1:22:56] and it's just it's just there's nothing
[1:22:59] new it's just a repeat
[1:23:01] of what was
[1:23:04] so we we find that that it's it's like
[1:23:09] reading the newspaper you remember the
[1:23:11] prophet talking about the man reading
[1:23:13] that newspaper
[1:23:15] and as he's reading his wife and cooking
[1:23:18] breakfast and she says hey John anything
[1:23:20] new
[1:23:21] he said now now
[1:23:24] nothing new just different people
[1:23:27] you know same old murders same old this
[1:23:29] same old cheating same old this you know
[1:23:32] it's just different people
[1:23:34] but there's nothing new ain't that right
[1:23:36] now we're living in the worst stage ever
[1:23:42] yeah we're living in the most sinful age
[1:23:44] ever the most deceitful age ain't that
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] everything that that was is now
[1:23:52] conglomerated in this in this age
[1:23:55] uh uh uh the days of Noah was was an age
[1:23:59] to itself uh the Sodom and Gomorrah was
[1:24:02] an age to itself but in this age we
[1:24:05] depict both ages
[1:24:07] the sin of of all ages have gathered in
[1:24:10] this age can you say amen and so we're
[1:24:13] living in the worst age ever and and and
[1:24:17] and yet the prophet would tell us it's
[1:24:20] the most glorious age ever to be and he
[1:24:23] explains that he said it's because we're
[1:24:26] living on the brink of Eternity amen
[1:24:30] where time is fading out and Eternity is
[1:24:34] coming in and we're right there on the
[1:24:37] brink oh my aren't you glad for that I I
[1:24:40] remember uh uh when we went to New
[1:24:43] Zealand we you know that that we got to
[1:24:46] a place we actually got to the place in
[1:24:49] the air where you could see daylight and
[1:24:51] dark at the same time pitch dark on on
[1:24:54] one part and and totally lie on another
[1:24:56] part and I as as I was thinking of this
[1:24:59] I've taken oh my God that's exactly
[1:25:02] where the believer is standing amen we
[1:25:05] are right there to where we can see
[1:25:07] light and darkness at the same time amen
[1:25:10] that we are in amen pressing into
[1:25:13] something church it's a change that that
[1:25:17] we've been looking for can you say man
[1:25:19] amen that's right and so that the world
[1:25:22] gropes in darkness out without any
[1:25:26] understanding see and you cannot make
[1:25:28] them understand because of the darkness
[1:25:31] that is upon them amen and and so
[1:25:34] they're good people yes and but but
[1:25:36] would talk to them about the Lord and
[1:25:38] they just look at you like huh you know
[1:25:41] if there's nothing there Amen to to make
[1:25:44] them feel guilty in the presence of God
[1:25:47] to where they want a better amen to go
[1:25:51] God's way ain't that right oh they want
[1:25:53] a better life but they're going to do it
[1:25:55] on their own
[1:25:57] no understanding so so when the
[1:26:00] politicians you know talk about change
[1:26:02] don't listen to it
[1:26:04] when when we you know you hear them talk
[1:26:07] about change on the news amen don't
[1:26:10] don't be caught up in that amen when the
[1:26:12] pope even himself is talking about
[1:26:14] change don't listen to it can you say
[1:26:17] amen amen when the denominational
[1:26:19] preachers talk about change don't you
[1:26:21] listen to that either can you say man
[1:26:23] because the chains that they're looking
[1:26:24] for amen is going to take them to the
[1:26:27] pits of hell yeah you understand what
[1:26:29] I'm saying it's motivated by the power
[1:26:32] of Darkness it's making a man way for
[1:26:35] the Incarnation of Satan himself to be
[1:26:38] fully completely incarnated in a human
[1:26:41] being to where he will govern the world
[1:26:43] as a whole can you say amen and they
[1:26:46] don't know what change they're looking
[1:26:48] for they don't realize oh they're crying
[1:26:50] for messiah and they're trying to make
[1:26:52] change for that Messiah but it's nothing
[1:26:54] but the devil incarnated in flesh can
[1:26:57] you say Amen oh yes sir see anything
[1:27:00] that is inspired and controlled by Satan
[1:27:03] all only makes room for him to manifest
[1:27:07] himself more anything that's why we we
[1:27:10] don't want our lives to be governed by
[1:27:12] the devil and we don't want our thoughts
[1:27:14] to be governed by the devil we don't
[1:27:16] want our habits to be governed by the
[1:27:18] devil we don't want this church to be
[1:27:20] governed this family our families to be
[1:27:22] governed by the devil can you say amen
[1:27:24] amen and that's why the Warfare is so
[1:27:27] great upon you amen is because you're
[1:27:30] the one that won't let him have his way
[1:27:33] in your life in your mind in this church
[1:27:35] can you say amen he can have his way
[1:27:38] anywhere but don't you have your way in
[1:27:41] my life in my family in my church in my
[1:27:44] situation you won't have your way
[1:27:48] can you say Amen
[1:27:50] that's right
[1:27:52] now the prophet says the Bible is the
[1:27:54] Fountain of all wisdom
[1:27:56] and holds all hopes everybody say all
[1:27:59] hopes for the future
[1:28:03] the Bible is the Fountain of all wisdom
[1:28:06] and holds all the hopes
[1:28:09] of the future in it
[1:28:11] your hope of Futures right here
[1:28:14] this little book
[1:28:16] can you say man
[1:28:19] now you can't have
[1:28:21] a change for the better without God
[1:28:25] now in our opening scripture
[1:28:28] God promised that there will be a change
[1:28:33] hold I make all things new
[1:28:38] throughout the Bible
[1:28:40] you find God speaking of change
[1:28:43] coming
[1:28:46] I thought of First Corinthians 15 51.
[1:28:50] behold I show you a mystery
[1:28:53] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:28:56] everybody say all be changed
[1:29:01] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:29:03] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:29:05] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:29:08] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:29:12] oh look at the change and man cannot
[1:29:14] bring this change on
[1:29:16] say for this corruptable must put on
[1:29:19] incorruption
[1:29:21] and this Mortal must put on immortality
[1:29:25] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:29:27] on incorruption and this Mortal shall
[1:29:29] have put on immortality then shall be
[1:29:32] brought to pass the saying that is
[1:29:34] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[1:29:37] you go back in the Old Testament and you
[1:29:40] find how that God changed Abraham and
[1:29:43] Sarah ain't that right a man not only
[1:29:47] did he change them back to their youth
[1:29:49] again but he changed the whole situation
[1:29:51] he changed their condition for when they
[1:29:54] were young to begin with they couldn't
[1:29:56] have children and so the prophet said
[1:29:58] he'd done more than just changed them
[1:30:00] back to the youth because they'd still
[1:30:01] be in the same boat not been able to
[1:30:03] have children but God changed them amen
[1:30:06] from old to Young and he changed the
[1:30:09] situation can you say amen that's
[1:30:12] exactly right now you you you're so so
[1:30:15] and brother Brown says now he changed
[1:30:17] Abraham and Sarah back to their youth
[1:30:19] again and back to everything changed
[1:30:22] them to show what he would do with you
[1:30:25] and I oh aren't you glad for that we are
[1:30:28] in the day that that was speaking of you
[1:30:32] are the people that God had in his mind
[1:30:34] when he changed them back so you could
[1:30:37] look back and see a change and realize
[1:30:40] that's the changes I'm looking for
[1:30:42] that's the change I'm not looking for a
[1:30:45] politician change I'm not looking for a
[1:30:47] governmental change I'm not looking for
[1:30:49] a presidential change I'm not looking
[1:30:52] for any change like that the change I'm
[1:30:54] looking for is God Amen changing me back
[1:31:03] you look at job and he said all the days
[1:31:04] of my appointed time
[1:31:06] will I wait
[1:31:08] till my change come
[1:31:10] oh he's looking for change
[1:31:12] amen I'm gonna wait ain't that right
[1:31:16] wait till my change come
[1:31:18] and notice this is the important thing
[1:31:20] because in the next verse he tells how
[1:31:23] the change will come he says that will
[1:31:25] call
[1:31:26] I will answer oh amen that's the change
[1:31:30] that's how the change comes thou will
[1:31:32] call and I will answer ain't that right
[1:31:35] so this change ain't coming by way of a
[1:31:39] politician the change ain't coming by
[1:31:42] way of Technology neither is it coming
[1:31:45] by some way of a seminary Seminary
[1:31:47] chicken preacher amen is not coming amen
[1:31:51] by some other way amen but job says Thou
[1:31:55] will call and I will answer can you say
[1:31:58] amen hallelujah if you're dependent upon
[1:32:01] a republican Amen to get you a better
[1:32:03] life amen you better look somewhere else
[1:32:05] if you're looking for a Democrat
[1:32:08] independent or whatever you are Amen to
[1:32:10] bring you a better life you better look
[1:32:12] somewheres else honey amen before job
[1:32:15] that gives us the answer when you call
[1:32:17] I'll answer
[1:32:20] ain't that right
[1:32:22] when you call
[1:32:25] then it's important we better hear his
[1:32:26] voice
[1:32:29] then we better take heed to what the
[1:32:30] prophet said there's other voices out
[1:32:31] there drowning out the voice of God
[1:32:35] and you say Amen
[1:32:37] so this change ain't coming by way of
[1:32:39] anything else but God
[1:32:41] now this fits
[1:32:42] this fits with what Paul said in first
[1:32:44] Thessalonians 4 16. for the Lord himself
[1:32:48] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:32:51] with the voice of an archangel of the
[1:32:54] Archangel and with feet Trump of God
[1:32:57] can you say amen and what's going to
[1:33:00] happen then when this happens and I I
[1:33:02] just brothers and sisters there we are
[1:33:05] in this age right there amen now when
[1:33:08] this happens the dead in Christ is going
[1:33:11] to rise first
[1:33:12] ain't that right so the change is going
[1:33:15] to start with the dead in Christ the
[1:33:18] rest of the Dead live not for another
[1:33:19] Thousand Years there's going to be
[1:33:22] people just laying the grave and they're
[1:33:23] going to sit there amen but there's
[1:33:25] going to be something amen the voice of
[1:33:28] God is going to bring a change to every
[1:33:30] believer that has already gone into the
[1:33:32] grave
[1:33:33] yes sir then when we which are alive and
[1:33:38] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:33:40] them in the clouds now we know what the
[1:33:43] prophet says amen about this in all
[1:33:46] these events amen is that that the dead
[1:33:49] will rise and they'll come and visit us
[1:33:53] those that are are founded in the word
[1:33:55] those that are believers those that are
[1:33:57] anchored those that are Rapture Ready
[1:33:59] amen they're going to be visited by
[1:34:02] these Saints amen that have gone on
[1:34:04] whether it be a loved one whether it be
[1:34:06] Paul that comes and knocks on your door
[1:34:08] whether it be Daddy whether it be Mama
[1:34:11] whether it be wife husband child it
[1:34:13] doesn't matter when they rise they're
[1:34:15] going to come and begin to knock on your
[1:34:17] door brother Walker amen and you're
[1:34:19] going to know Roxanne it's time to go
[1:34:22] can you say man you're going to know
[1:34:24] amen the change is here I don't know
[1:34:27] about you but I can face two 20 and 23
[1:34:30] with such a promise as that for I know
[1:34:33] the change is coming
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:38] the change the change
[1:34:41] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:34:43] be caught up together with them in the
[1:34:45] clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:34:47] you know some people believe that caught
[1:34:49] up is just Revelation getting caught up
[1:34:52] in Revelation
[1:34:53] they do away with the rapture
[1:34:56] well I got good news for you right now
[1:34:58] that's exactly against what the prophets
[1:35:01] taught and the Bible teaches I believe
[1:35:03] in getting caught up in Revelation but
[1:35:05] that's not what that scripture is saying
[1:35:08] because the dead in Christ hasn't risen
[1:35:10] so we're going to just sit here looking
[1:35:12] like dumb you ignorant people amen until
[1:35:15] the dead in Christ rise and then we get
[1:35:16] caught up in Revelation or what that's
[1:35:19] not the way the Bible reads that's not
[1:35:20] the way it is can you say Amen the
[1:35:23] Revelation is happening right now amen
[1:35:26] why it's building rapturing faith right
[1:35:28] now
[1:35:30] you're not waiting for rapturing faith
[1:35:32] rapturing faith is already being applied
[1:35:34] to you
[1:35:37] ain't that right
[1:35:39] so notice amen that will call and I will
[1:35:42] answer first the shout
[1:35:44] the voice of the Archangel the Trump of
[1:35:48] God ain't that right and then the dead
[1:35:51] in Christ and then the change happens
[1:35:55] oh my and what happens when that change
[1:35:58] comes death and Corruption will give way
[1:36:00] and the dead in Christ will rise those
[1:36:04] who are alive and remain are going to be
[1:36:07] caught up to meet the Lord and
[1:36:09] Corruption death old uh uh age or
[1:36:14] whatever is going to leave them
[1:36:17] tonight
[1:36:18] and and and you you know good and well
[1:36:21] the prophet taught us that it'll leave
[1:36:22] you corruption is going to leave you
[1:36:24] before you're caught up
[1:36:28] ain't that right didn't he talk about
[1:36:30] you you one of these days you'll be
[1:36:32] combing that old gray hair in the mirror
[1:36:34] and all of a sudden it changes
[1:36:37] Lord have mercy
[1:36:39] what a change
[1:36:42] what a change
[1:36:44] Hallelujah
[1:36:45] don't don't don't be looking for fads to
[1:36:48] change you don't look for better fashion
[1:36:51] to change you I don't care if you look
[1:36:53] old and and fuddy duddy I don't care
[1:36:56] what you look like to the world it
[1:36:57] doesn't matter you just keep before you
[1:37:00] A change is coming A Change Is Coming
[1:37:03] it'll be a better change than what the
[1:37:05] the the the the fashion designers can
[1:37:07] make it'll be a a better change than
[1:37:10] what the dressmakers can make and the
[1:37:12] makeovers and all that with their makeup
[1:37:14] and all their nonsense and their hair
[1:37:17] dies and all you know you know how they
[1:37:19] are trying to make everything up and all
[1:37:21] their operations and everything looking
[1:37:23] for a better change amen but it ain't
[1:37:25] it's going to be a better change than
[1:37:27] that
[1:37:28] can you say man why it'll be your very
[1:37:31] Creator that'll change you it'll change
[1:37:34] you back to what he thought of you in
[1:37:36] the beginning and it'll be a perfect
[1:37:38] body it'll be a perfect design it'll be
[1:37:41] a perfect fashion
[1:37:46] change
[1:37:52] gravity will lose its hold
[1:37:54] talking about change
[1:37:58] gravity gonna lose its hold
[1:38:01] you know these these guys that go up
[1:38:03] Beyond gravity
[1:38:05] to the Moon
[1:38:07] they got to come back down
[1:38:10] but when this change happens there will
[1:38:12] never be a gravity
[1:38:14] Force
[1:38:16] It'll be such a different
[1:38:18] atmosphere
[1:38:20] It'll be such a different way
[1:38:23] death will then be defeated
[1:38:26] ain't that right
[1:38:27] why you're changed from corruptable to
[1:38:30] incorruptable
[1:38:33] Philippians 3 21 tells us that God is
[1:38:36] going to change our vile body
[1:38:39] that it may be fashioned
[1:38:41] likened to his own glorious body
[1:38:45] now no fashion designer can fashion that
[1:38:47] right there
[1:38:48] this is a fashion that God will do
[1:38:51] oh my and I'm look so looking forward to
[1:38:55] it then your groaning will be over
[1:38:59] can you say man
[1:39:01] see you know they they they could they
[1:39:05] could they the fashion designers and the
[1:39:07] makeovers brother Walker Sister Walker
[1:39:09] sister Jane you Elders brother Bill they
[1:39:13] they could do the fashion for you but
[1:39:15] it'll never change it'll never take the
[1:39:18] aches and pains
[1:39:20] he'll never take that oldness away when
[1:39:22] you get up and you just uh
[1:39:24] it'll never take the stiff joints away
[1:39:28] they they just making it look over you
[1:39:30] know you're just an old man old woman
[1:39:32] looking over
[1:39:34] made made different
[1:39:36] but they can never take the reality of
[1:39:38] the old way
[1:39:40] but oh God's gonna take it away
[1:39:43] you're gonna take away the sorrow can
[1:39:46] you say man now notice Isaiah 65 17 for
[1:39:51] behold I create new heavens and a new
[1:39:54] Earth and the former shall not be
[1:39:57] remembered
[1:39:58] nor come into mind but be glad and
[1:40:02] rejoice forever in that which I create
[1:40:05] for behold I create Jerusalem a
[1:40:08] rejoicing and her people a joy ain't
[1:40:12] that right notice what the promise so am
[1:40:15] I and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and

[1:42:15] knows
[1:42:18] what a change that's coming
[1:42:24] what a change
[1:42:28] when Jesus came as the Prince of Peace
[1:42:31] brother Branham asked the question why
[1:42:33] wasn't there peace
[1:42:35] then he answers is because all the word
[1:42:38] wasn't fulfilled
[1:42:39] in his day
[1:42:41] so he couldn't bring peace
[1:42:44] like the world is looking for
[1:42:47] but look
[1:42:48] he says when every promise everybody say
[1:42:51] every promise
[1:42:52] when every promise is fulfilled
[1:42:56] death is swallowed up in Victory
[1:43:00] Jesus Will Come
[1:43:01] and the last one is Vindicated
[1:43:04] then there will come an eternal peace
[1:43:07] upon the Earth
[1:43:09] and an eternal shalom
[1:43:13] and eternal Shalom peace will rest upon
[1:43:18] the Earth
[1:43:19] oh my when every promise is fulfilled
[1:43:23] brothers and sisters
[1:43:25] I hope I'm making sense to you
[1:43:28] I'm preaching to myself
[1:43:31] that all I can say is be diligent with
[1:43:34] the word
[1:43:35] get your eyes off of every stinking
[1:43:38] thing
[1:43:39] that is trying to hold you back
[1:43:42] get your eyes off of every unbelief
[1:43:45] every skepticism everything amen quit
[1:43:50] listen to all the voices that are out
[1:43:52] there listen to that word stay intently
[1:43:56] do the word why because you're the
[1:44:00] people to fulfill the word you're the
[1:44:03] last people to fulfill the last promises
[1:44:05] that pertain to this Bride Can you say
[1:44:09] amen and when every promise Last Promise
[1:44:13] is fulfilled then there will be Eternal
[1:44:16] peace can you say amen I I don't know
[1:44:19] about you but the Millennium amen I
[1:44:22] don't expect to live this year out I
[1:44:24] just don't I I just you know uh um you
[1:44:28] know I I I know we got to plant the
[1:44:30] potatoes and we got to do whatever we
[1:44:32] got to do but I tell you why we're doing
[1:44:34] that brother Branham said live every day
[1:44:36] as though Jesus is coming that minute
[1:44:38] can you say man and I believe he's
[1:44:40] coming I just believe it and it just
[1:44:43] can't be long amen and notice what
[1:44:46] brother Branham says he's here
[1:44:48] fulfilling his word today every promise
[1:44:51] that he has made listen you're the last
[1:44:53] generation you're the last age you're
[1:44:55] the last people amen you're the finale
[1:44:58] God has waited for you to come don't you
[1:45:00] understand that brother Brown said if I
[1:45:02] was given the choice of any age to live
[1:45:04] in I'd pick it right now amen you are
[1:45:07] the greatest age ever to be you're the
[1:45:09] greatest people ever to be amen we're
[1:45:12] not putting no one previous down that's
[1:45:14] not the point amen but you're the climax
[1:45:16] of God's thoughts you are the climax
[1:45:19] amen and why is the pressure on you than
[1:45:22] it has been in any other age think of
[1:45:24] that you're under the greatest pressure
[1:45:25] you're under the greatest battles that
[1:45:28] has ever been fives right now amen
[1:45:30] because you are the one that's going to
[1:45:32] finish this thing and they without us
[1:45:35] cannot be made perfect your every 10
[1:45:37] their testimony amen is waiting on you
[1:45:40] amen their lies are depending upon you
[1:45:43] have been very courage is dependent upon
[1:45:46] you if we don't make it they died in
[1:45:49] vain if you don't make it they went to
[1:45:52] the uh burned to the stake in vain can
[1:45:55] you say Mahana for even though they're
[1:45:57] up there in their theophany they cannot
[1:45:59] come back into that body Amen to where
[1:46:03] death can be defeated until you make it
[1:46:08] only when you make it
[1:46:12] then death will be defeated
[1:46:14] and they will be able to come back into
[1:46:16] their bodies
[1:46:22] so you think of it
[1:46:23] they're in heaven
[1:46:26] waiting on you
[1:46:31] we look to be there
[1:46:33] oh if I could just die if I could just
[1:46:34] go if I could just be whatever
[1:46:37] I'd be in a better place
[1:46:39] okay
[1:46:41] I'll give you that
[1:46:44] but you know what
[1:46:47] they're actually there
[1:46:49] it's been holding
[1:46:51] this ain't done yet
[1:46:55] we got to have you to finish the race
[1:47:00] so we can be made perfect
[1:47:04] can you say Amen
[1:47:06] we got to have you
[1:47:08] to finish this race
[1:47:10] so that we can fulfill scriptures too
[1:47:14] and that is the dead would raise
[1:47:18] and that body
[1:47:19] though it's been scattered by the Four
[1:47:21] Winds of the Earth
[1:47:22] it's going to come back
[1:47:25] and you say man
[1:47:27] it's going to come back
[1:47:31] what a change
[1:47:33] you love him
[1:47:36] so this new year
[1:47:40] doesn't cause us to have the same
[1:47:42] expectations as the world has
[1:47:46] second Peter 3 13.
[1:47:49] says we according to his promise we
[1:47:52] everybody say we
[1:47:54] according to
[1:47:57] his promise
[1:47:59] that's how we enter this year
[1:48:01] we according to his promise look for
[1:48:07] new heavens
[1:48:09] and a new Earth
[1:48:11] wherein
[1:48:13] dwelleth righteousness
[1:48:17] see he made you righteous now
[1:48:20] and there's a place he's made for you to
[1:48:22] inhabit
[1:48:24] and you say man
[1:48:26] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[1:48:29] not unrighteousness
[1:48:31] so you just stay true to the word
[1:48:34] you just stay true to what God's called
[1:48:36] you to do
[1:48:37] just keep keep plugging on you say well
[1:48:39] I'm not getting anywhere keep plugging
[1:48:44] ain't that right
[1:48:46] yes sir
[1:48:48] so he's the one that promised it so this
[1:48:50] is how we look into the new year this is
[1:48:52] how we Face the year is we according to
[1:48:55] his promise
[1:48:57] we're looking for a new Heaven and a new
[1:49:00] Earth
[1:49:01] Allelujah
[1:49:04] then we reckon ourselves soldiers
[1:49:06] pilgrims and sojourners
[1:49:09] so he promised it
[1:49:11] and our expectation comes from the Lord
[1:49:15] now I'm gonna try to hurry
[1:49:18] but see the change has already begun
[1:49:23] God started this change with us as
[1:49:25] individuals
[1:49:27] ain't that right
[1:49:29] in second Corinthians 5 17 Paul said If
[1:49:32] any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:49:34] creature or a new creation
[1:49:36] old things everybody say old things are
[1:49:40] passed away
[1:49:42] have you experienced that
[1:49:44] old things are passed away behold all
[1:49:48] things everybody say all things
[1:49:50] are become new
[1:49:52] see the change has already come
[1:49:55] the old years died the new has begun the
[1:49:59] old man has died the new man has begun
[1:50:02] can you say man yes sir see so he is a
[1:50:06] new creation his desires are changed
[1:50:10] from old to new his life is changed from
[1:50:14] old to new his nature is changed from
[1:50:18] old to to new ain't that right so the
[1:50:22] old has died out and has given birth to
[1:50:25] the new for he is a new creation but
[1:50:29] that doesn't stop amen the believer that
[1:50:33] doesn't stop us a man from wanting
[1:50:36] change crying out for change brother
[1:50:39] Brandon said when you receive the Holy
[1:50:40] Ghost people think that's that's that's
[1:50:42] all there is to it we've arrived he said
[1:50:44] no you're just beginning
[1:50:46] ain't that right but as long as you're
[1:50:48] in this Mortal life there is still a
[1:50:51] groaning to change now I understand
[1:50:53] brother Branham said your groaning is
[1:50:55] over amen uh uh and and yes that you're
[1:50:59] at a risk or you should be in a rest to
[1:51:01] where you can take God's word and and
[1:51:03] rest in that word but but that doesn't
[1:51:06] mean that we're just content with life
[1:51:08] here but we're always looking forward to
[1:51:11] change we're always looking forward Amen
[1:51:13] to something amen see uh uh now now see
[1:51:17] we we know a man that we can't be lost
[1:51:20] amen uh because we have been sealed to
[1:51:24] the day of our Redemption I'm talking
[1:51:25] about Holy Ghost Field Believers we can
[1:51:28] never be a sinner again right we can
[1:51:32] never go back to the old life that we
[1:51:34] once lived so so our time of groaning is
[1:51:37] over Amen in in that way we we we it's
[1:51:41] it's a done deal I'm going in the
[1:51:44] Rapture I'm I'm going because there's
[1:51:47] his witness beareth witness with my
[1:51:49] spirit that I am a Son of God don't
[1:51:52] don't don't get me wrong yes thoughts of
[1:51:54] Doubt always tries to Prevail and tell
[1:51:57] me that I'm not a son of God Amen and I
[1:52:00] as as the Bible says the just shall live
[1:52:02] by faith the just shall walk by faith
[1:52:04] everything it's a faith walk it's a
[1:52:07] faith talk it's a it's a faith
[1:52:09] confession you you understand what I'm
[1:52:11] saying amen so the times that you just
[1:52:13] don't feel like amen you're fit for it
[1:52:15] I'm going anyway you know the times that
[1:52:18] I just don't think I can make it I'm
[1:52:20] gonna make it anyway amen he's the high
[1:52:23] priest of My Confession can you say amen
[1:52:26] and I don't know about you you can
[1:52:28] either sit there I can sit there and
[1:52:30] just Waller and self-pity and let the
[1:52:32] devil fight us until we're beat down to
[1:52:34] where we ain't got nothing or we can
[1:52:36] take God at his word and say come live
[1:52:39] hell or high water I'm going to serve
[1:52:41] the Lord
[1:52:46] job
[1:52:47] we can never go back
[1:52:51] because the old life is dead
[1:52:55] that nature is gone
[1:52:58] but yet the believer still desires to
[1:53:00] change
[1:53:02] for in second Corinthians 3 17 talk Paul
[1:53:05] talks about beholding as in a glass we
[1:53:09] beholding as in a glass
[1:53:12] the glory of the Lord
[1:53:14] uh probably 16.
[1:53:17] the glory of the Lord are changed into
[1:53:19] the same image
[1:53:21] from glory to glory
[1:53:23] so you you changing did not just happen
[1:53:27] or let's set this way your complete
[1:53:30] change
[1:53:31] and and I say that reverently but but
[1:53:34] hopefully you you to understand that
[1:53:36] your complete change did not just happen
[1:53:39] overnight when you received the Holy
[1:53:41] Ghost
[1:53:45] I I guess it's like a baby
[1:53:48] uh developing it's boring it's had a
[1:53:51] birth but now it develops into adulthood
[1:53:55] and and with that change see as he
[1:53:58] develops he changes ain't that right and
[1:54:01] just got her license the other day
[1:54:03] blessed my heart and
[1:54:05] I told her I said you need to let your
[1:54:07] brothers know so they can stay off the
[1:54:09] sidewalks but she she got her license
[1:54:12] the other day she's so excited and
[1:54:15] well and so we're excited with her
[1:54:23] in a different way but yeah you're right
[1:54:26] but you know as I I I've really done a
[1:54:29] lot of pondering about just cried to see
[1:54:32] my daughter
[1:54:34] uh getting old enough to drive
[1:54:37] not because it raises my insurance
[1:54:40] and all that I mean that's a lot to cry
[1:54:42] about but
[1:54:44] but just to see the change
[1:54:48] to see when she first began to walk
[1:54:52] there in Pennsylvania
[1:54:54] she uh we were sitting there with
[1:54:57] brother Jim Shoemake he was him and his
[1:55:00] sister D was over at her house and where
[1:55:02] we were staying we were eating
[1:55:04] and out of the clear blue no one taught
[1:55:07] her nothing
[1:55:08] she just comes out of the bedroom and
[1:55:10] starts walking through the hall walk in
[1:55:13] the living room and we all dropped our
[1:55:15] Forks
[1:55:18] and Road Jim reminds me they have that
[1:55:20] occasionally
[1:55:21] and and now she's driving I remember you
[1:55:24] know you heard three years old and
[1:55:26] Rebecca was teaching the children school
[1:55:28] at home and
[1:55:30] and so she's asked them the question all
[1:55:33] right who's the first president in the
[1:55:34] United States who's the first president
[1:55:37] and three years old in the living room
[1:55:38] George Washington
[1:55:42] she passed the test
[1:55:45] and now she here she is driving
[1:55:48] but with that development come change
[1:55:53] weakness changes into strength
[1:55:57] immaturity changes into maturity
[1:56:01] ignorance changes into knowledge
[1:56:04] inability changes into ability
[1:56:08] irresponsibility changes into
[1:56:11] responsibility
[1:56:14] right
[1:56:15] the way we see things change
[1:56:18] the way we hear things change they way
[1:56:22] we act upon things change the way we
[1:56:26] understand things changes ain't that
[1:56:29] right
[1:56:30] because even though there's a birth
[1:56:32] there's always a change and within that
[1:56:35] child you know there if if the child is
[1:56:39] normal with normal behavior then he's
[1:56:43] always pressing for change
[1:56:46] change and and you know uh uh Daniel and
[1:56:51] Brittany's which you know all you you
[1:56:54] all of you this got children it's the
[1:56:56] same thing but uh it just reminds me a
[1:56:58] little Titus and and them uh uh Autumn
[1:57:01] but Autumn you know just you're I don't
[1:57:04] know how old is she a month three months
[1:57:06] four months oh it's gonna say oh time's
[1:57:09] changing here but yeah uh so three
[1:57:12] months and you know it wasn't I mean
[1:57:13] just wouldn't seemed like when she just
[1:57:15] got home she's already trying to raise
[1:57:17] her head you know and and she's very you
[1:57:19] know wants the she wants to be
[1:57:21] independent she wants to set up she
[1:57:22] tried to it's telling me last night you
[1:57:24] know that she's trying to set up but why
[1:57:27] is because there's something there
[1:57:29] that's calling out for change
[1:57:32] I don't want to be held all my life I I
[1:57:35] I I I don't want to just lay around all
[1:57:38] my life you understand what I'm saying
[1:57:39] and as we're talking we're thinking it
[1:57:41] won't be long she's going to be crawling
[1:57:43] it ain't gonna be long she's gonna be
[1:57:45] walking ain't gonna be long she's gonna
[1:57:47] be driving you know it just it's
[1:57:50] constant change reaching out for chain
[1:57:53] well if that's in the natural so is it
[1:57:55] in the spiritual
[1:57:58] can you say man you don't want to just
[1:58:00] stay in your walleye for too long
[1:58:03] there's something in you calling for
[1:58:05] change amen and and that's why I believe
[1:58:08] there's Mercy for that believer I just
[1:58:10] believe that when you fall down God
[1:58:12] doesn't hold that to you because there's
[1:58:14] a desire for change God I'm gonna get
[1:58:17] back up and I'm I I oh I made I was
[1:58:20] telling the a preacher the other day you
[1:58:22] know asking for some advice just I want
[1:58:24] Pastor advice sometime and and I said
[1:58:27] I've made so many mistakes and I've made
[1:58:29] just uh you know all these things and I
[1:58:31] just wish I could go back and do better
[1:58:33] and and and and these things of of
[1:58:35] certain things and and and and and and
[1:58:38] you know uh uh as it just come to me but
[1:58:41] there he is his mercies are are from
[1:58:45] endurance forever they're new Every
[1:58:48] Morning amen and I believe that's the
[1:58:50] way with every individual if you're
[1:58:52] truly a Believer there's a desire for
[1:58:55] change amen there's a desire Amen to get
[1:58:58] closer there and that's what I pray for
[1:59:00] amen me there for this new year as We
[1:59:03] Gather the family around last night Amen
[1:59:05] to pray I want to change I want to be a
[1:59:08] better father I want to be a better
[1:59:10] husband I want to be a better Pastor I
[1:59:12] want to be a better Christian I I want
[1:59:14] to please my Lord better I I want to
[1:59:17] draw closer to him I I just want to you
[1:59:20] understand what I'm saying not that I
[1:59:22] have to but it's something in me amen
[1:59:24] it's not that word you know that that
[1:59:26] you you demand your baby to start
[1:59:28] walking you just know it's going to come
[1:59:30] because there's a desire that's already
[1:59:33] there amen and you just give it some
[1:59:35] time and it's going to grow
[1:59:39] change
[1:59:42] change
[1:59:44] so as it is in the natural so as it is
[1:59:46] in the spiritual brother Brown talks
[1:59:47] about us laying in the presence of the
[1:59:49] Sun
[1:59:50] to ripen
[1:59:52] to ripen
[1:59:54] you'll never change in denomination
[1:59:57] there's nothing there to change you
[1:59:59] you'll you'll never change under
[2:00:01] Seminary
[2:00:03] nothing changed you
[2:00:05] ain't that right
[2:00:07] the message is the revealing of the son
[2:00:11] of man
[2:00:12] and under in that presence
[2:00:14] you ripen
[2:00:16] there's a change
[2:00:18] developing can you say man
[2:00:21] you'll never change you'll never change
[2:00:23] by New Year's resolutions
[2:00:29] you'll never change by discussing
[2:00:30] problems in your home
[2:00:32] about the church about your husband wife
[2:00:35] children
[2:00:37] you'll never change that way
[2:00:41] except for the worse
[2:00:45] we see it all the time
[2:00:49] but if you want to change for the better
[2:00:52] it's the message
[2:00:54] ripening Under the Sun in the presence
[2:00:57] of the Sun
[2:00:58] ain't that right
[2:00:59] so every believer has that desire
[2:01:03] in
[2:01:04] brother branham's prayer he said May the
[2:01:07] old man sin and unbelief die out in her
[2:01:09] heart
[2:01:10] and the New Birth come in with the 1963
[2:01:13] like a rushing Mighty Wind that might
[2:01:15] fill our beings that make us new
[2:01:18] creatures in Christ
[2:01:21] that's in 1963 at a new year he's
[2:01:24] praying this type of a prayer
[2:01:27] you see the new year for the believer
[2:01:29] brings new hope
[2:01:31] why
[2:01:32] we're one year closer
[2:01:37] we're one day now closer
[2:01:41] every hour it comes we're one hour
[2:01:43] closer
[2:01:45] and it brings new expectations
[2:01:48] and you say man see we're not going back
[2:01:51] to what has been
[2:01:53] but we are getting closer to what God
[2:01:55] has promised us in the future
[2:01:58] brother Branham in his prayer
[2:02:01] or as he's preaching there in the
[2:02:04] message Shalom he says I want to see
[2:02:07] what's promised for the day
[2:02:09] I want to know what the light of the
[2:02:12] hour is so I can know how to walk in it
[2:02:16] I want to know where I'm living
[2:02:18] what age I'm in how far up the road I am
[2:02:22] or how far up the road am I right
[2:02:26] now
[2:02:28] we look and and I think this is
[2:02:31] beautiful and
[2:02:33] I pray that it it really sinks into our
[2:02:36] hearts mind
[2:02:38] but brother Brown he's talking there he
[2:02:40] says a word is a thought expressed God
[2:02:43] in his thinking thought it and expressed
[2:02:46] it through His prophets and now it has
[2:02:48] to be fulfilled
[2:02:49] so now we know what word has to be
[2:02:52] fulfilled it is the things that have to
[2:02:54] be fulfilled is what was spoken by the
[2:02:56] prophets
[2:02:57] and when he foretold us of these things
[2:03:01] you see he's foretold us of these things
[2:03:03] so we wouldn't make a mistake and
[2:03:06] blunder in darkness then
[2:03:09] when we see it being fulfilled
[2:03:12] so so he showed us rich in mercy God
[2:03:15] being merciful we could enter into this
[2:03:18] year with our eyes open
[2:03:21] the light shining
[2:03:24] to where we can see what needs or what
[2:03:27] has to be and what is being fulfilled so
[2:03:30] we don't make a mistake and walk and
[2:03:32] blunder in darkness
[2:03:34] you understand what I'm saying millions
[2:03:37] billions of people walking entering into
[2:03:39] this year in darkness groping for change
[2:03:42] groping about trying to change
[2:03:45] and they don't know what it's all about
[2:03:47] the world has to change America has to
[2:03:50] change the economy has to change
[2:03:53] everything has to change it's all
[2:03:55] falling rotten place to give way to
[2:03:58] another kingdom
[2:04:01] are you with me
[2:04:03] yes sir so we're not entering this year
[2:04:06] groping in darkness just stumbling
[2:04:08] around God by his Mercy had shed the
[2:04:12] light to let us know what is to be
[2:04:18] now notice Philippians 3 13 Paul says
[2:04:22] forgetting those things which are behind
[2:04:24] and reaching forth unto those things
[2:04:26] which are before brother Brown said it
[2:04:28] this way to the complete identification
[2:04:30] when all time will fade out into
[2:04:33] eternity when Jesus comes that's what
[2:04:36] we're pressing for that's what we're
[2:04:37] reaching out for is to the complete
[2:04:39] identification when all time will fade
[2:04:42] out into eternity when Jesus comes oh my
[2:04:46] there will be a millennium
[2:04:50] there will be a time where the old will
[2:04:54] become new
[2:04:55] young can you say man the sickness will
[2:04:59] fade away death will be no more and as
[2:05:03] Isaiah prophesied they shall build
[2:05:05] houses and they will inhabit them
[2:05:07] they'll plant Vineyards and we'll eat
[2:05:09] the fruit thereof they will not plant in
[2:05:12] another inhabit in other words brother
[2:05:14] Brown said his son taking it see after
[2:05:16] him his son will be living by him the
[2:05:19] prophet said amen see the wolf and the
[2:05:22] lamb shall eat together the lion shall
[2:05:24] eat straw like the Bullock a child shall
[2:05:27] lead them around showing that there's
[2:05:29] going to be nothing but innocence there
[2:05:32] ain't that rack No One's Gonna Be there
[2:05:34] to hurt or to destroy
[2:05:37] man
[2:05:38] the wild nature of our of the Beast will
[2:05:42] no longer be there
[2:05:47] and all I can say
[2:05:50] is we're at the end time
[2:05:52] The Junction is here
[2:05:54] I got more and more to go but I'm gonna
[2:05:56] close if the musicians will come
[2:06:00] the end time is here
[2:06:03] oh do you love him
[2:06:05] can you lift your hands and just worship
[2:06:07] Him
[2:06:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:06:13] I love the Lord I love the Lord
[2:06:18] he's so wonderful to us
[2:06:21] oh God help us God help us to keep
[2:06:25] pressing on
[2:06:27] help us Lord to keep enduring
[2:06:32] I wonder if we could just stand to our
[2:06:34] feet for a moment
[2:06:36] maybe we could join hands with one
[2:06:39] another
[2:06:39] [Music]
[2:06:48] this this year's for some reason has
[2:06:51] been more
[2:06:53] I've taken this year coming year to be
[2:06:55] more sober than I have in other years
[2:07:00] just for my life for the church here
[2:07:04] and I wonder if we could just
[2:07:07] dedicate ourselves
[2:07:10] to the Lord
[2:07:13] as as we face this year you know what
[2:07:16] you've maybe lacking
[2:07:20] and as the prophet would do as we enter
[2:07:22] this year
[2:07:24] is look back and see the mistakes that
[2:07:27] we've made and ask God to forgive us of
[2:07:29] them
[2:07:31] is a lord
[2:07:34] take our hand Lord and walk with the sin
[2:07:38] can you just pray in your own way but
[2:07:41] father
[2:07:44] our hearts are longing for home
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:51] we're yearning for that place Lord of
[2:07:54] change
[2:07:56] we're all the Mind battles and The
[2:07:59] Temptations will be done with
[2:08:05] but Lord we're just dependent upon your
[2:08:09] grace and your mercy
[2:08:12] that you would forgive us of all of our
[2:08:15] sins of the past years
[2:08:20] oh God we don't want to do them Lord
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:27] and we're asking that you would hold our
[2:08:30] hand
[2:08:31] as we walk in this Dark Age this year to
[2:08:35] come we don't know the future of this
[2:08:38] year
[2:08:39] you could take us all home or you could
[2:08:42] just take call someone home here
[2:08:46] but Lord may we be ready may we press
[2:08:49] the battle Lord
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:54] we just drop everything that just seems
[2:08:57] so important
[2:08:59] in this world and we can just grab hold
[2:09:02] of the word
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:05] I know we can get tired and discouraged
[2:09:10] Satan has a way of
[2:09:12] of trying to paint a picture of
[2:09:15] hopelessness Lord
[2:09:17] and help us not to entertain them
[2:09:19] thoughts help us not to believe them
[2:09:22] lies
[2:09:23] may we hold the word dear to us Lord
[2:09:28] I pray you'd help this Church Father
[2:09:31] we've gone through many battles many
[2:09:33] things Lord
[2:09:35] but may your people be encouraged today
[2:09:40] may we press on as a body of Believers
[2:09:43] here
[2:09:45] help us in our homes help us men to be
[2:09:48] more consecrated and dedicated
[2:09:52] to be better Godly husbands and fathers
[2:09:57] help the women Lord to be better mothers
[2:10:01] and better Godly examples
[2:10:06] not that we're not Lord not that they're
[2:10:08] not
[2:10:09] but that's just our desire Lord
[2:10:13] give us the grace oh more grace is what
[2:10:17] we ask for
[2:10:19] we thank you Lord we love you
[2:10:24] foreign

[2:19:31] be communion is going to be having song
[2:19:34] and then go right into communion
[2:19:38] and
[2:19:40] we was going to start at 4 30 to keep
[2:19:43] the time
[2:19:44] I guess everybody's here though
[2:19:47] I
[2:19:49] I think it was put out at four announced
[2:19:52] at four
[2:19:53] if everybody would want to have it at
[2:19:55] four since it is just songs and
[2:19:57] communion we can do that
[2:20:01] where you will allow
[2:20:02] so how many would want it at four
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] raise your hand
[2:20:09] who would want it at 4 30.
[2:20:13] so well it's outvoted so we'll do it at
[2:20:18] four
[2:20:19] but from one now on we will have
[2:20:23] services at 4 30. every Sunday evening
[2:20:27] and for this you know uh this year
[2:20:31] coming
[2:20:33] we're not going to be doing every other
[2:20:34] Sunday night
[2:20:37] or evening like we've been doing we'll
[2:20:39] be having Services every Sunday night
[2:20:42] maybe once a month we can get together
[2:20:44] for Fellowship we'll try to get that out
[2:20:47] uh worked out but I know
[2:20:50] we try to get Camp Christie booked
[2:20:53] several months back for this year and
[2:20:55] they're already blew up they had nothing
[2:20:57] that we could do until September so I
[2:21:00] really thank the Lord that we had our
[2:21:02] tent our meeting reserved but they
[2:21:07] wouldn't they said we couldn't use the
[2:21:10] camp Christie for our fellowship
[2:21:14] and until September and that's how busy
[2:21:18] they are but uh so from now on we will
[2:21:22] be having evening services
[2:21:24] and uh
[2:21:26] I I would like to once at least once a
[2:21:29] month
[2:21:31] take an evening service and
[2:21:34] have Fellowship
[2:21:36] eating like we did but also take that
[2:21:40] time after that and talk to the young
[2:21:43] couples and
[2:21:45] young people and have a Bible study or
[2:21:48] something and question and answers
[2:21:50] things like that and uh
[2:21:53] I think that would be good too
[2:21:56] so anyways God bless you and if you have
[2:21:59] any questions concerning that just just
[2:22:01] talk to me if I haven't made that clear
