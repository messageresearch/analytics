[49:48] chapter I want to read one verse there
[49:50] and then we'll turn to the book of Acts
[49:52] the 10th chapter but in Psalms 107 and
[49:55] verse 20 the Bible says he sent his word
[50:00] and healed them and delivered them from
[50:03] their
[50:04] destructions amen I love that he sent
[50:07] his word and healed them and delivered
[50:11] them from their destructions now in the
[50:13] book of Acts the 10th chapter the book
[50:16] of Acts the 10th chapter I've spoke out
[50:18] of this passage of scripture many times
[50:20] but it's very it's very special to my
[50:23] heart in Acts chapter 10 and verse
[50:27] 36 David there're writing in Psalms 107
[50:30] he says that the word was sent and here
[50:32] in Acts 10:36 the Bible says the word
[50:36] which God sent unto the children of
[50:37] Israel preaching Peace by Jesus Christ
[50:41] he is Lord of all now that word I say ye
[50:45] know which was published throughout all
[50:47] Judea and begin From Galilee after the
[50:51] baptism which John preached now we know
[50:54] that John preached the baptism of our
[50:56] Lord Jesus
[50:57] but watch verse 38 how that God anointed
[51:00] Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost
[51:03] amen I'm thankful for the Holy Ghost and
[51:06] with power who went about doing good now
[51:09] watch this and healing all that were
[51:11] oppressed of the devil for God was with
[51:15] him amen we ask the Lord this evening to
[51:17] add the blessing to the reading of his
[51:18] word as you can have your seats here
[51:20] this afternoon I want you by the help of
[51:22] the Lord for just a few moments tonight
[51:25] amen to speak to here in if I would take
[51:27] a title I want to speak to you on
[51:29] spiritual healing by the power of the
[51:31] word amen spiritual healing by the power
[51:34] of the word uh maybe just to lay a
[51:37] foundation here I want to read a quote
[51:38] the prophet of God speaking speaking of
[51:41] Jesus baptism on the River Jordan and
[51:43] then he begins to speak about the dove
[51:45] that descended and he says here now when
[51:47] he came down upon him he become the
[51:50] anointed one the Messiah how many
[51:52] believes he was the Messiah he said then
[51:54] we find out then that Temptation in the
[51:56] Wilderness he said but immediately
[51:58] returning from his temptation he went
[52:01] about Healing The Sick casting out
[52:03] Devils setting the people at Liberty he
[52:05] said now let's see them the first thing
[52:07] he did amen was start preaching the
[52:10] gospel Healing The Sick all those amen
[52:13] that were oppressed of the devil so
[52:15] right after amen Jesus was baptized
[52:18] filled with the spirit he went about
[52:20] preaching the gospel Healing The Sick
[52:22] and casting out the devil now you all
[52:24] know the first name that God appeared to
[52:26] Us in amen was Jehovah and brother BR
[52:29] said I I believe the first name God Amen
[52:32] the word ever appeared in was I am the
[52:34] Lord that Health thee he said taking
[52:36] away all the sickness and things from je
[52:39] from them amen Jehovah Rafa he said
[52:41] Jehovah Gyra amen was the provided
[52:44] sacrifice and Rafa amen was the Lord
[52:47] that Health thee brother man establishes
[52:49] something here he said God is the Healer
[52:52] how many agrees God is the Healer he
[52:54] said Satan cannot heal when you see the
[52:57] sign following the spirit of healing and
[53:00] blessings of God you realize that's
[53:02] coming from God so don't misjudge it
[53:04] judge God rightly he said and may the
[53:07] Lord Jesus tonight appear Amen in this
[53:10] Auditorium in the resurrected power of
[53:13] His being amen I believe tonight that he
[53:15] is here but he's not here in the form
[53:18] that the world is looking for him to be
[53:19] here in but he is here in the form that
[53:22] he promised to be here and that is the
[53:24] power of his resurrection now amen you
[53:26] know that when you catch that spiritual
[53:29] revelation of his presence not here
[53:31] yesterday or will be here tomorrow but
[53:33] his presence amen that is here right now
[53:36] amen I believe that that releases an
[53:39] understanding to us amen that if his
[53:41] presence is here then healing is here if
[53:44] his presence is here amen then Del
[53:47] Deliverance is here brother says it very
[53:49] beautiful he said see if he is not here
[53:52] amen that he said something that he
[53:53] cannot back up he said we got a spirit
[53:56] ual Revelation that Jesus Christ is the
[53:59] same yesterday today and forever he said
[54:02] his power is here now his spirit is here
[54:05] now his healing is here now his
[54:08] salvation is here now everything that we
[54:10] have need of Amen is right here now the
[54:13] Holy Ghost is moving on the building
[54:15] right here now he said that would save
[54:18] every sinner that would baptize every
[54:20] believer amen and that would heal every
[54:22] sick person so the presence of God Amen
[54:25] that's here right now now has the
[54:27] ability Amen to save every sinner to
[54:29] heal every sick person amen and to
[54:32] deliver everyone that's bound because
[54:34] Jesus said Upon This Rock Amen I will
[54:37] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[54:39] amen cannot Prevail against it he said
[54:42] oh my I feel like preaching oh amen
[54:44] don't you believe that God Amen is
[54:47] revealing himself to the human heart
[54:50] amen the spiritual revelation of the
[54:53] Lord Jesus Christ so this amen is more
[54:55] than just an education amen it's more
[54:58] than just an idea amen but this is a
[55:00] revelation that God Amen is revealing
[55:03] something not to the Head amen not to
[55:06] the feet not to the hands amen but he is
[55:09] revealing it to the hearts amen notice
[55:11] the place that this Revelation is taking
[55:13] place amen it's taking place in amen the
[55:17] human heart now you all know what
[55:19] healing is the prophet of God said it's
[55:20] your personal faith Amen in a finished
[55:23] work at Calvary amen of what the Lord
[55:25] Jesus J Christ what God did by him at
[55:28] Calvary when he purchased your salvation
[55:31] and your healing now amen I find it very
[55:33] amazing that brother Bram will tell us
[55:35] that there's actually two types of
[55:37] healing he says there is a physical
[55:39] healing he said but then there is a
[55:42] spiritual healing now when you think of
[55:44] this the spiritual brother B says this
[55:46] he says but there's more to the ministry
[55:48] than just Divine Healing see amen the
[55:50] sickest body I know of tonight amen is
[55:53] the so-called body of Jesus Christ
[55:56] he said it needs spiritual healing he
[55:59] said then there's only one bomb that I
[56:01] know that will heal amen and that is the
[56:04] word there's only one thing amen that
[56:07] will heal the body of Jesus Christ and
[56:09] that is the word he said and that's the
[56:11] sick body that we want to stand up Amen
[56:14] in the strength and the Vitamin Power of
[56:17] the Gospel he said that's why I use so
[56:19] much of my time now amen trying to
[56:22] strengthen the church amen by the word
[56:25] amen he was not laying just in feelings
[56:27] or in gifts or in emotions amen but he
[56:30] knew if this church was going to
[56:32] withstand amen the End Time battle it
[56:34] was going to do it by the word and the
[56:37] only way that you can be strengthened
[56:39] amen is by the word listen friends
[56:41] Feelings Will Fail You amen gifts will
[56:44] fail you but there's one thing that he
[56:45] said will never pass away he said
[56:48] heavens and earth shall pass away amen
[56:51] but my word shall never pass away I
[56:54] believe tonight that the mystical body
[56:56] of Jesus Christ is not a weak body amen
[56:59] I believe it's a strong body because the
[57:01] word has been revealed in the age that
[57:04] we're living in yes sir the Bible says
[57:06] in Psalms 41:4 it says I said Lord amen
[57:10] be merciful unto me and heal my soul
[57:13] amen for I have sinned against thee in
[57:15] Isaiah 53 and verse 5 you know that very
[57:18] well as the atonement he said he was
[57:20] wounded for our transgression he was
[57:22] bruised for our iniquity the
[57:24] chastisement of our peace was upon Him
[57:27] amen and with his stripes we are healed
[57:31] amen Isaiah 57:18 I have seen his ways
[57:35] and will heal him I will lead him also
[57:38] and restore Comforts unto him amen and
[57:41] to his mourners in Jeremiah 3:22 he says
[57:45] return ye backsliding children and I
[57:47] will heal your backslidings behold amen
[57:50] we come unto thee for thou art the Lord
[57:53] Our God in Jeremiah 17:14
[57:56] he says Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be
[57:59] healed that's not a negative confession
[58:01] amen that's a positive word amen Heal Me
[58:04] Oh Lord and I shall be healed amen save
[58:08] me and I shall be saved amen for thou
[58:11] art my praise amen I love Hosea 6:1 he
[58:15] says come and let us return unto the
[58:17] Lord amen for he hath torn amen and he
[58:20] will heal us how many believes he will
[58:22] heal us watch and he will he has smitten
[58:25] amen but he will bind us up amen so
[58:28] after the tearing there is a promise of
[58:31] a healing after the smiting there is a
[58:33] promise of abinding you all know the
[58:35] prophet of God said that Jesus amen is
[58:38] our bridegroom right he said now what
[58:41] was Jesus he was smitten now I believe
[58:43] that if if our bridegroom was smitten
[58:45] amen then so will the bride be smitten
[58:48] brother said the word living in an
[58:49] action the Bible bride amen not some
[58:52] man-made bride but the Bible bride amen
[58:55] smitten and Afflicted of God he said no
[58:57] Beauty we should desire her amen but yet
[59:00] we did esteem her smitten and Afflicted
[59:03] that's right amen she stands alone he
[59:06] said she is smitten from all the
[59:08] denominations according to Revelations 3
[59:11] she is smitten out of the leot ofan
[59:13] church age amen that she was raised up
[59:16] in see the church was raised up in the
[59:19] leot ofan church age he said but that
[59:22] was the husk listen and the seed is not
[59:24] air with the shuck amen this bride might
[59:27] have been raised up in the L of sin age
[59:30] amen but she could not receive amen a
[59:33] strength by the word underneath the
[59:34] influence of a shuck amen so God had to
[59:37] send a prophet with a message that would
[59:39] be a Vindicated message that would call
[59:42] the bride out amen of the place that was
[59:44] wounding her listen leosa was wounding
[59:47] this bride it was wounding her faith it
[59:50] was wounding her ability to believe God
[59:52] hey but in the days of the voice of the
[59:54] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[59:56] sound there will be a voice of
[59:58] resurrection and that voice will call
[1:00:01] the bride out of the confusion and will
[1:00:03] call her to a place sister James that
[1:00:06] she could receive healing hey hey you
[1:00:08] all believe it church amen that this
[1:00:10] message of the hour has provided a place
[1:00:12] for the bride Amen to receive healing
[1:00:15] amen not just a physical healing but a
[1:00:17] spiritual healing she was smitten out of
[1:00:20] the leay out of sin Church age amen I'll
[1:00:22] said it as plain as I know how and she
[1:00:24] was called into the bride age
[1:00:27] she was smitten out of the lotan age but
[1:00:30] she was called into the bride age Amen
[1:00:33] to receive true spiritual healing amen
[1:00:36] by the word I love what the prophet of
[1:00:38] God says in Feast of trumpets he said
[1:00:41] see the Holy Spirit has been bound by
[1:00:44] these denominational Rivers for almost
[1:00:47] 2,000 years amen but is to be loosed in
[1:00:50] the evening time amen by the evening
[1:00:53] time message amen the Holy Spirit amen
[1:00:56] back in the church again amen Christ
[1:00:59] himself revealed in human flesh Amen in
[1:01:03] the evening time he said it he promised
[1:01:06] it amen listen the devil don't want that
[1:01:08] to become amen a reality in the Church
[1:01:11] of the Living God because if that is a
[1:01:14] reality amen then I can say it don't
[1:01:16] matter what devil has wounded you it
[1:01:18] don't matter what false Doctrine has
[1:01:20] wounded you hey the Holy Ghost is no
[1:01:23] longer bound amen by the wounds of Le of
[1:01:26] seea and the confusions of the age we're
[1:01:28] living in but there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:01:31] there's a sweet opium from the lily of
[1:01:33] the valley and it's flowing in the house
[1:01:35] of God and if he is here amen then
[1:01:37] healing is here amen I believe it I
[1:01:40] believe what Luke 4:18 says I love that
[1:01:42] verse it says the spirit amen of the
[1:01:45] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[1:01:48] me Amen to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:01:51] how many believes that Heath anointed me
[1:01:53] to preach the gospel to the poor watch
[1:01:55] this he has sent me Amen to heal the
[1:01:59] brokenhearted he has sent me Amen to
[1:02:02] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:02:04] Deliverance to the captives and the
[1:02:06] recovering of the sight to the blind
[1:02:09] amen and to set at Liberty amen them
[1:02:11] that are bruised amen listen but without
[1:02:14] the spirit of the Lord upon him he could
[1:02:17] not do it amen but when the spirit of
[1:02:19] the Lord descended Hallelujah when the
[1:02:21] spirit of the Lord descended like a dove
[1:02:23] on the River Jordan amen he re receive
[1:02:26] the power Amen to heal the sick and to
[1:02:29] save the Lost listen I wish I had an
[1:02:31] hour on every one of those amen but what
[1:02:33] jumps out to me church is he was sent
[1:02:36] Amen to heal the brokenhearted amen look
[1:02:39] at this word heal it means to make whole
[1:02:42] it means to cure it means to heal it
[1:02:45] means to free from errors and sins Amen
[1:02:48] to bring about one salvation amen so
[1:02:51] healing is not just dealing with the
[1:02:53] leaving of a cancer amen or the or the
[1:02:56] or the the changing of a of a limb amen
[1:02:58] but there's a spiritual healing amen
[1:03:01] that comes to wounded Hearts amen now
[1:03:04] I'll say this amen there's many wounded
[1:03:06] hearts in the world today and I'll just
[1:03:08] say this Leota a denominational Doctrine
[1:03:11] wounded many people it wounded people
[1:03:13] with false Doctrine but look at this
[1:03:15] word brokenhearted of course you know
[1:03:17] amen we're speaking of the heart look
[1:03:19] what it says amen the heart denotes amen
[1:03:22] the center of all physical and spiritual
[1:03:25] life amen the center and the seat of
[1:03:27] spiritual life how many's got a heart
[1:03:29] amen that might be an odd question to
[1:03:31] ask you got a heart okay in that heart
[1:03:34] amen is the center or the seat amen of
[1:03:37] all physical and spiritual life it is
[1:03:39] the center amen of spiritual life amen
[1:03:42] it is the Fountain and the seat of the
[1:03:44] thoughts amen the passions the desires
[1:03:48] the appetites the affections the
[1:03:49] purposes and the Endeavors listen
[1:03:52] somebody say well amen it don't matter
[1:03:54] what condition my heart is
[1:03:56] well according to the Bible out of your
[1:03:58] heart amen is the issues of Life the
[1:04:00] Bible says in Proverbs 4:23 amen keep
[1:04:03] thy heart with all diligence because out
[1:04:06] of it amen are the issues of life amen
[1:04:09] out of your heart comes your appetite
[1:04:12] out of your heart comes your desire out
[1:04:14] of your heart Comes Your Passion out of
[1:04:16] your heart comes your purpose amen
[1:04:18] listen when you Endeavor to do something
[1:04:20] amen though you may do it with your feet
[1:04:23] amen your feet receives a mobile or or
[1:04:25] receives a how can I say a motivation
[1:04:28] from your heart listen your heart is
[1:04:30] what motivates your hands to raise your
[1:04:32] heart is what motivates your feet to
[1:04:34] shout your heart is what motivates your
[1:04:36] hands to clap listen and and the Bible
[1:04:39] says keep thy heart amen for out of it
[1:04:41] are the issues of life now I love what
[1:04:43] Jeremiah 179 says it says the heart amen
[1:04:47] is deceitful though Above All Things
[1:04:50] amen and desperately wicked amen who can
[1:04:52] know it amen who can know the heart but
[1:04:55] the Bible goes on to say but I the Lord
[1:04:58] search the heart amen and I try the
[1:05:00] Reigns amen even to give every man
[1:05:03] according to his ways and according to
[1:05:05] the fruit of his doings amen so the one
[1:05:08] who made the heart has the ability to
[1:05:10] search the heart and he has the ability
[1:05:13] to discern amen what is afflicting the
[1:05:15] heart and by that discernment he has the
[1:05:18] ability to bring a healing to that
[1:05:19] broken heart brother said we find out
[1:05:22] now amen that the ark being a top of the
[1:05:24] human heart he said the heart is
[1:05:26] deceitful he said that's where people
[1:05:28] fail today amen is because they get a
[1:05:31] head religion instead of a heart
[1:05:35] religion they get a head religion
[1:05:38] instead of a heart religion now I'll
[1:05:40] just say this amen there's one thing
[1:05:42] that Satan would love to break in every
[1:05:43] one of us amen that's not our feet come

[1:05:52] don't mind if he don't really want to
[1:05:53] break her hands so he can't clap amen he
[1:05:56] don't want to break our voice so we
[1:05:57] really can't sing amen the devil wants
[1:05:59] to break our heart because he knows if
[1:06:02] our heart amen is out of whatever we're

[1:06:26] devil broke their heart and their heart
[1:06:28] left the message and a lot of them just
[1:06:30] stayed in so they could get enough money
[1:06:32] to retire on well come on we might as
[1:06:34] well preach amen but their body was

[1:06:48] ability to break the seat amen of our
[1:06:51] passion to serve God to break the seat
[1:06:53] of our affection to believe his word to
[1:06:55] break the seat amen of their appetite to
[1:06:58] feed on every word that proceedeth out
[1:07:00] of the mouth of God I say oh God let

[1:07:18] each other he said any doctor anything
[1:07:20] can tell you amen that knows the
[1:07:22] chemistry of the blood that only sorrow
[1:07:25] will do that brother Kevin when the
[1:07:27] water and the blood broke apart in the
[1:07:30] body of our Lord Jesus he said he never
[1:07:32] died from a Roman
[1:07:34] spear neither did he die from a nail
[1:07:38] that drove in his hand or his feet but
[1:07:40] he died of a broken heart he said being
[1:07:43] rejected he came to his own and his own
[1:07:48] received him not said brother random I
[1:07:50] wish I could have stood there that day
[1:07:51] at Calvary he said brother you're
[1:07:53] standing in a better place today
[1:07:56] come on you're standing in a better
[1:07:58] place today you're standing in the
[1:08:01] presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus who
[1:08:04] has already proved himself triumphant

[1:08:10] Lord is n to them that are of a broken
[1:08:13] heart amen and save a such of a contrite
[1:08:17] spirit let me say this amen my Lord amen
[1:08:20] might have hung on the cross amen and he
[1:08:22] might have stood there and he might have
[1:08:24] took the pressures of the Roman spear
[1:08:27] the pressures of the Roman Crown of
[1:08:28] Thorns but what really killed him was
[1:08:31] the ability amen not the ability but the
[1:08:34] breaking of his heart when his heart was
[1:08:37] broken that's when the blood and water
[1:08:39] separated amen I'll tell you something
[1:08:41] friends the devil knows Humanity the
[1:08:43] devil knows what he knows what's in that
[1:08:45] heart amen that's why the devil wants to
[1:08:47] break it in Ecclesiastes 12 and verse 6
[1:08:50] the Bible says orever amen this is it's
[1:08:52] an odd scripture but let me just read it
[1:08:54] it says orever the silver cord be loosed
[1:08:57] or the golden bow be broken or the
[1:09:00] pitcher be broken at the fountain or the
[1:09:02] wheel amen broken at the sister look at
[1:09:05] that or the Golden Bowl be broken amen
[1:09:08] or the pitcher be broken or the wheel be

[1:09:13] to crush or to oppress brother speaking
[1:09:17] of a married he he was still there in
[1:09:18] 1951 marries this young couple during
[1:09:21] the Depression he said now listen they
[1:09:23] didn't have hardly anything he said but
[1:09:24] I looked at them and I said if they love
[1:09:27] each other they said well sure so I said
[1:09:29] well now remember amen happiness does
[1:09:31] not consist of how much of the world's
[1:09:34] good you own amen but how contented you
[1:09:36] are with the portion that's allotted to
[1:09:39] you so that's what it be he said I said

[1:09:44] see things alike amen but always
[1:09:46] remember you're still in love when you
[1:09:49] see one in that way or the other don't I
[1:09:51] said give in if they're wrong it'll show
[1:09:53] after a while to be all right now I want
[1:09:55] you to catch this I said there's a
[1:09:57] little bow in a human heart that is full
[1:10:00] of a golden oil called love amen I'm not
[1:10:03] preaching on marriage so relax amen but
[1:10:05] in the human heart there is a little bow
[1:10:08] in that human heart and it's full of a
[1:10:10] golden oil called love he said if it's
[1:10:13] ever broken it can be healed up thank
[1:10:17] God if it's ever broken it can be healed
[1:10:20] up he said but there will always be a
[1:10:23] scar there as long as you live let me
[1:10:26] just stop and say this amen if you got a
[1:10:28] bowl and you you you know what a Bowl's
[1:10:30] for right you put milk in it soup in it
[1:10:33] ice cream in it amen that bow if it's
[1:10:35] going to hold anything it's got to be in
[1:10:37] one piece
[1:10:38] right it can't be broken it's got to be
[1:10:41] in one piece listen to me there's many
[1:10:44] ways that bowl can be broken and when
[1:10:46] that bowl is broken amen things begin to
[1:10:49] leak out of it hey but watch this it can
[1:10:52] be broke in many ways you can drop it
[1:10:54] you can scoot it off the table you can
[1:10:56] put it between something and clam the uh
[1:10:58] slam the door too hard and crack it amen
[1:11:00] there's many ways it can be broken but
[1:11:02] there's only one way it can be fixed and
[1:11:05] I'll tell you what'll fix it amen to
[1:11:07] bring it back together is something has
[1:11:09] got to be more powerful of a force than
[1:11:12] what broke it come on there's got to be
[1:11:14] something more powerful to pull the two
[1:11:17] together and put it back together so you
[1:11:19] can put milk in it or you can put ice
[1:11:21] cream in it or you can put soup in it
[1:11:23] there's got to be a glue that more
[1:11:25] powerful than whatever the force that
[1:11:27] broke it let me say this friends every
[1:11:29] single one of us sitting here tonight
[1:11:31] amen have a heart and we have a bowl in
[1:11:34] that heart and we've been through things
[1:11:36] face things been through situations and
[1:11:38] there's been times that bowl has been
[1:11:40] cracked but can I make an announcement
[1:11:42] to you tonight there is a bomb in Gilead
[1:11:45] there is an opium from the lily of the
[1:11:47] valley there is a glue it's not super
[1:11:49] glue it's not Gorilla Glue amen it's not
[1:11:52] a hotgun glue it's the Holy Ghost Ghost
[1:11:55] and the Holy Ghost has the power Amen to
[1:11:58] come between the two cracks amen and put
[1:12:00] some sad between them and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:03] is stronger than the oppression that
[1:12:05] broken that's why Jesus stood there and
[1:12:07] said he has sent me he said you both
[1:12:10] know me and you know when I am and I am
[1:12:12] not come of myself but he has sent me as
[1:12:15] true whom ye know not he said but I know
[1:12:18] him for I am from him and he hath sent
[1:12:22] me Jesus knew that the the father has
[1:12:26] sent him brother said see what is
[1:12:28] happening here is God is sending his
[1:12:30] word and it's bringing Liberty to those
[1:12:33] who receive it not
[1:12:36] bondage my goodness the word is not sent
[1:12:39] to bring
[1:12:41] bondage it's sent to bring Liberty he
[1:12:44] said Jesus come he was sent to destroy
[1:12:47] the works of the devil he said that's
[1:12:49] why God was made both soul and body he
[1:12:51] said Jesus had both soul and body and
[1:12:54] yet was God he came to take on himself
[1:12:57] the full form of man to redeem the full
[1:13:00] form of man back to God he said that's
[1:13:03] why he come in flesh and in Soul he said
[1:13:06] that's the reason Jesus could say it's
[1:13:08] not me that doeth the works it's my
[1:13:11] father that dwelleth in me he said and
[1:13:14] if sickness is a blessing and Jesus come
[1:13:16] and healed the sick everywhere then he
[1:13:18] defeated his purpose in coming Jesus
[1:13:21] never did tell his disciples amen never
[1:13:24] preached at anywhere ask the disciples
[1:13:26] Amen to tell people they must stay
[1:13:29] panned down with sickness to obey him
[1:13:31] but he sent them amen to liberate the
[1:13:34] sickness and to preach in captivity and
[1:13:37] to those in bondage he come to bring
[1:13:40] Deliverance he said and he can't bring
[1:13:42] Deliverance he can't do the two things
[1:13:45] opposite one from the other he's either
[1:13:47] got to be the author of life amen or the
[1:13:50] author of death he said listen if you
[1:13:52] put sickness onto God and say that it's
[1:13:54] God making you sick to die then you got
[1:13:56] to make him the author of death when
[1:13:58] death and life cannot associate even
[1:14:01] together there never was a funeral
[1:14:03] preached in the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:14:06] he broke up every funeral possession he
[1:14:09] come in contact with why because life
[1:14:12] and death amen cannot exist together
[1:14:16] what are you saying I'm saying the thing
[1:14:18] that broke the bow cannot exist in the
[1:14:20] presence of what come to heal it amen
[1:14:23] let me say this the sin amen that is
[1:14:25] bound you cannot exist in the presence
[1:14:28] of the God who is sent his word to heal
[1:14:31] you listen friends amen I am a firm
[1:14:33] believer that the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:14:35] Ghost has the ability Amen to heal any
[1:14:38] sickness it has the ability to save any
[1:14:40] sin it has the ability to forgive any
[1:14:43] iniquity there is a God and he's right
[1:14:45] here in this building tonight hey may I
[1:14:47] say it as plain as I know how healing is
[1:14:51] here you say it's God's will to heal you
[1:14:54] yes sir according to Psalms 107
[1:14:57] spiritual healing comes amen by God
[1:14:59] sending his word I love what the prophet
[1:15:02] says he says God don't want you to
[1:15:04] suffer he wants you to be well he died
[1:15:07] for that purpose he don't want you to
[1:15:09] suffer he wants you to be well and he's
[1:15:11] made one basic thing if you believe
[1:15:13] listen what he done he sent his
[1:15:17] word he sent his son he sent his
[1:15:23] prophets he sent law he sent everything
[1:15:26] and today he sent the holy spirit amen
[1:15:29] to continue the ministry that Jesus did
[1:15:32] when he was here on the earth you say
[1:15:35] well the law is not here and the
[1:15:37] prophets are not here and Jesus is not
[1:15:39] here in a Corporal body what difference
[1:15:41] does it make if the holy ghost that was
[1:15:43] on him is here I say to you tonight
[1:15:46] Church the holy spirit moves out on the
[1:15:48] building and speaks whoever he will
[1:15:50] speak he said that's sovereignty then
[1:15:53] that brings the knowledge because it's a
[1:15:55] promise of God Amen and that brings the
[1:15:58] knowledge of God Sovereign and it also
[1:16:00] brings his presence down among us we
[1:16:03] should see it and rejoice we should see
[1:16:06] the moving of the spirit of God and
[1:16:09] rejoice amen listen he always send his
[1:16:12] word amen by prophets acts 10 said the
[1:16:15] word which God sent unto the children of
[1:16:17] Israel listen God was sending a blessing
[1:16:20] to Israel amen but it came by a burden
[1:16:23] on the heart amen of a prophet so if I
[1:16:26] could say it this way amen the word was
[1:16:28] sent as a
[1:16:30] burden but when it was received brother
[1:16:33] the bill it was received as a blessing
[1:16:36] it was sent by a burden but it was
[1:16:39] received as a blessing Amos 3:7 surely
[1:16:42] the Lord God will do nothing but he
[1:16:44] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[1:16:47] the prophets Malachi 4:5 behold I will
[1:16:50] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:16:53] coming of the great and day of the Lord
[1:16:56] listen I doubt very much if any true
[1:16:58] truly knew the messenger that God had
[1:16:59] sent into it any age rather amen a
[1:17:02] church age book except in the first age
[1:17:04] where Paul was the messenger and even in
[1:17:07] that age many did not recognize him for
[1:17:11] what he was first of all the messenger
[1:17:13] is going to be a prophet it will be
[1:17:15] based solidly on the word because when
[1:17:18] he prophesies or has a vision it will
[1:17:21] always be word oriented and it will
[1:17:24] always come to
[1:17:27] pass so it's not going to be human
[1:17:30] assumptions that's right he will be
[1:17:33] Vindicated as a prophet because of his
[1:17:37] accuracy listen what the prophet of God
[1:17:39] says he said and listen it will take a
[1:17:41] prophet to get the Revelation because
[1:17:43] God has no other way of bringing out his
[1:17:46] scriptural Revelations except by Prophet
[1:17:49] see the word always came by a prophet
[1:17:53] and always will that this is the law of
[1:17:56] God is evident by even a casual search
[1:17:59] of scripture the unchanging God with
[1:18:02] unchanging ways invariably sent his
[1:18:04] prophet in every age where the people
[1:18:06] had strayed from divine order with both
[1:18:09] the theologians and the people having
[1:18:11] departed from the word God always sent
[1:18:14] his servant to these people but apart
[1:18:17] from the Theologian in order to correct
[1:18:20] the false teaching and to lead the
[1:18:22] people back to God listen the prodag God
[1:18:25] said see the message is thus sayith the
[1:18:27] Lord he said the they were speaking amen
[1:18:30] the word of God because the message is
[1:18:33] the word itself listen friends the word
[1:18:36] amen being quickened by the spirit is
[1:18:38] bringing us to a recognition of the
[1:18:41] power of the message at the end time
[1:18:43] listen if it was just word word word and
[1:18:46] no Spirit the letter kth amen but the
[1:18:48] spirit giveth life listen God sends his
[1:18:51] word and heals the people and saves them
[1:18:54] from their destruction but it's the
[1:18:56] spirit of God upon the word that
[1:18:58] administers the word and quickens your
[1:19:01] heart to receive that word ream come
[1:19:03] along and preached in 1964 recognizing
[1:19:06] your day and its message he said see the
[1:19:09] bride has recognized the evening life
[1:19:11] how many's thankful for
[1:19:12] that just begin to recognize the hungry
[1:19:16] Pentecostals have begin to recognize
[1:19:18] that them organization hasn't got
[1:19:20] anything they was looking for they're so
[1:19:22] twisted and tore up see it's the time of
[1:19:24] of recognition you've got to recognize
[1:19:27] amen the world has recognized the
[1:19:29] Nations has recognized science has
[1:19:32] recognized and the devil has recognized
[1:19:35] that it's the time he can wreck women he
[1:19:37] can wreck the church he can wreck the
[1:19:39] people he recognized it amen listen if
[1:19:42] the world is recognized and the devil
[1:19:44] has recognized then listen what the
[1:19:46] prophet of God says and God has
[1:19:48] recognized that there is a people on the
[1:19:51] Earth that he predestinated to life and
[1:19:53] he recognized this is the time to send
[1:19:57] his message he did it the people
[1:19:59] recognized it the bride time has
[1:20:02] realized the evening light oh Church of
[1:20:05] the Living God in the age when the devil
[1:20:07] is wounding Hearts he is breaking up
[1:20:10] homes he has destroying the nation he
[1:20:12] has become the god of this evil age he
[1:20:14] has created his perverted rather his own
[1:20:16] Eden but God would send a message and
[1:20:19] brother Daniel it would not be a
[1:20:20] theologian it would not be a school
[1:20:22] teacher it would be a vind ated voice of
[1:20:25] authority and we can stand here today
[1:20:28] and say if you'll hear this message you
[1:20:30] can receive your healing if you'll hear
[1:20:32] this message you can receive everything
[1:20:34] you have need of the evening light
[1:20:37] message is not an intellectual message
[1:20:39] therefore it's bypassed by
[1:20:41] many it's not a scientific message
[1:20:44] therefore brother Bob it's looked down
[1:20:45] upon by many but it's a message of faith
[1:20:48] and promise to a Believer listen Malachi
[1:20:51] 4 come what did it do it restored faith
[1:20:54] it restored the faith in the promise of

[1:23:59] built up today can I just say what a
[1:24:01] prophet said he said before I go any
[1:24:03] further I might say this I believe it's
[1:24:06] the
[1:24:08] enemy I believe it's the enemy coming
[1:24:11] down and pressing I believe it's the
[1:24:15] devil can I tell you why because the
[1:24:18] coming of the Lord is at hand the great
[1:24:21] hour of pressure is on the church but I
[1:24:24] I want to make an announcement tonight
[1:24:26] the hour is here for you to be
[1:24:29] healed it's not the hour you got to live
[1:24:32] underneath this
[1:24:34] pressure it's the devil come on let's
[1:24:37] just preach it's the devil it's not your
[1:24:39] husband it's not your wife it's not the
[1:24:42] kids it's the devil coming down and
[1:24:45] pressing upon you because you are the
[1:24:47] only people on the Earth that he cannot
[1:24:50] wreck oh god he has wrecked for churches
[1:24:53] he has wrecked politicians he has
[1:24:55] wrecked science and wrecked education
[1:24:58] but there is a group of people with a
[1:25:00] predestinated seed on the inside of
[1:25:02] their soul and the devil can't wreck
[1:25:05] you I love what David says in Psalms
[1:25:08] 147:3 he Health the broken in heart he
[1:25:12] bindeth up their WBS oh people rise in
[1:25:15] the name of the Lord your God and claim
[1:25:17] your god-given privilege for the hour is
[1:25:19] here for you to be
[1:25:23] healed that's right to glorify God and
[1:25:26] to receive his
[1:25:29] spirit and His blessings cut off all the
[1:25:33] formalities cut off all the ritualistic
[1:25:36] religion and come into the Realms of the
[1:25:38] Living God who awakens the human soul
[1:25:42] I'm reading you a quote and brings you
[1:25:44] into righteousness into worship of him
[1:25:47] in the spirit and in the truth I love
[1:25:51] what the Bible says in Acts 10:38 it
[1:25:53] says this that God anointed Jesus of
[1:25:55] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[1:25:58] power who went about doing good and
[1:26:00] healing all that were oppressed of the
[1:26:02] devil now watch what he says here for
[1:26:05] God was with him look at this word devil
[1:26:09] it's a false accuser this one astounds
[1:26:12] me brother brother Branson it's
[1:26:14] persecuting good men it's estranging
[1:26:17] Mankind from God and enticing them to
[1:26:20] sin it is afflicting them with diseases
[1:26:23] by means of demons who take possession
[1:26:25] of their bodies amen at his bidding now
[1:26:28] what an age we're living in where
[1:26:30] everything you go the doctor and they
[1:26:33] just give you a pill for it right right
[1:26:36] come on we're living it is this okay
[1:26:38] we're living in a day and time where
[1:26:40] everything has a medical has a medical
[1:26:42] name for it but let me just show you
[1:26:44] what the Bible says the Bible says in
[1:26:46] Isaiah 53:7 it says speaking of Jesus
[1:26:49] the Lamb of God he was oppressed and he
[1:26:51] was afflicted yet he opened not his
[1:26:53] mouth he has brought as a lamb the
[1:26:55] slaughter and as a sheep before shears
[1:26:57] his dumb so he openeth not his mouth
[1:27:00] listen friends certain conditions amen
[1:27:02] cause Affliction and by that Affliction
[1:27:05] it brings an oppression let me just say
[1:27:07] this I know people sometimes have a hard
[1:27:09] time with this but brother brandom our
[1:27:11] Prophet suffered with a mental
[1:27:13] oppression amen now listen it was not
[1:27:15] coming from something that he done it
[1:27:17] was coming from a stomach condition that
[1:27:19] was afflicting his body on the wings of
[1:27:21] a snow white dove he said I always
[1:27:23] wanted to go to mayos to find out what
[1:27:25] was wrong because of the doctors there
[1:27:27] he said my stomach gets sour oh my
[1:27:30] brother Jack's helped me around the
[1:27:31] house before he said now listen to The
[1:27:33] Prophet I've walked around the house and
[1:27:36] just a hot greasy water like flying out
[1:27:38] of my mouth and I walk to the pullad and
[1:27:41] pray for people that was twice that bad
[1:27:43] and be healed yeah are y'all hearing me
[1:27:47] walk around the house all day long
[1:27:49] spitting up hot water greasy stuff out
[1:27:52] of his mouth and walk to the p dead and
[1:27:54] pray for people and be healed he said
[1:27:56] I've I've had them lay my hands on a man
[1:27:58] with a cancer on his face and the cancer
[1:28:00] left his face standing there and I was
[1:28:02] so sick I couldn't stand up right amen
[1:28:06] now come on think about that amen amen
[1:28:08] amen you ever see in the other tevan
[1:28:10] just doing that amen sit in a chair amen
[1:28:13] and a prophet couldn't even lift his own
[1:28:15] hand to pray for the person somebody had
[1:28:17] to raise his hand Amen to lay it on the
[1:28:20] cancer because oh god brother Junior his
[1:28:23] own body was under an Affliction he said
[1:28:25] you don't know what I've suffered amen
[1:28:27] just a mental oppression he said every
[1:28:30] seven years it's come all my life he
[1:28:32] said that's where I am right now 78
[1:28:35] listen to what he says he said I was so
[1:28:37] distressed I cried I begged and I
[1:28:41] pleaded brother Sean he lets us in on a
[1:28:43] little secret amen listen amen I hope
[1:28:46] this is okay a prophet sitting on the
[1:28:48] platform anden he wasn't worried about
[1:28:50] who thought about what about him he was
[1:28:52] there to preach the word because the
[1:28:54] anointing was upon him listen it was the
[1:28:57] ministry of Jesus Christ you all know
[1:29:00] the pr of God said that Jesus prayed for
[1:29:02] Peter's mother-in-law or rather not
[1:29:04] Peter's mother-in-law amen was it the
[1:29:06] Widow of main son he prayed for walked
[1:29:08] out by the gate and sit down and grown
[1:29:09] with a headache are you hearing me but
[1:29:12] listen he said I was distressed I cried
[1:29:16] I begged I pleaded but you know what I
[1:29:18] don't see brother I don't see where he
[1:29:20] says I
[1:29:21] quit I've read that quote over over and
[1:29:24] brother I don't see where it says I quit
[1:29:27] can I tell you why you don't see it amen
[1:29:29] because greater was the revelation of
[1:29:32] the never failing presence of Jesus
[1:29:34] Christ in his soul than the Affliction
[1:29:37] that was in his flesh oh God are you
[1:29:40] hearing me if fat Revelation ever moves
[1:29:43] in your soul it don't matter how the
[1:29:45] devil afflicts the flesh greater is the
[1:29:48] Revelation in your soul and the
[1:29:51] Affliction in your flesh Hallelujah
[1:29:54] there's a strength coming from the
[1:29:55] Revelation I love how the part of God
[1:29:57] just breaks in this for a minute he says
[1:29:59] I've seen that demon of Oppression
[1:30:01] that's battled me all my life he said it
[1:30:03] comes like a cloud form like a wave it
[1:30:06] just makes a real funny sound when
[1:30:07] you're in that other dimension to see
[1:30:09] the
[1:30:10] spirit so he was not describing the
[1:30:13] flesh he was describing the
[1:30:15] spirit now watch this he said the only
[1:30:18] thing that kept me from being saved when
[1:30:20] I was 12 years old was because the
[1:30:22] spirit
[1:30:24] a spirit hung over me and he identifies
[1:30:27] but tell you what that spirit is it's a
[1:30:29] devil and here's what it was saying wait
[1:30:32] a little while longer he said there's
[1:30:34] not a man that's got his right mind but
[1:30:37] what wants to do right but there's
[1:30:38] something that won't let him do right is
[1:30:42] that right that's the devil but he
[1:30:45] commissioned his church to cast them
[1:30:48] Devils out in my name they shall cast
[1:30:51] out Devils you ain't going to heal
[1:30:52] nobody you're going to cast The Devil
[1:30:55] away from them so they can accept the
[1:30:57] healing I've already done he said
[1:31:00] preacher stood on the platform and they
[1:31:02] preach the gospel and devil scatter man
[1:31:04] come to the altar under conviction say I
[1:31:06] want to get saved the preacher never

[1:33:49] word amen the Holy Ghost had been bound
[1:33:53] by denom AAL Rivers for 2,000 years but

[1:34:25] a horrible thing it's the worst feeling
[1:34:27] anyone could have there's nothing like
[1:34:29] feeling that distress you see but Jesus
[1:34:32] Christ can make you well remember oh God

[1:35:00] is making her overweight that's what she
[1:35:02] wants to be prayed for that's exactly
[1:35:04] the truth let her be the judge now the
[1:35:06] Lord Jesus is that what he did when he
[1:35:08] was here on Earth how many knows that to
[1:35:09] be the Bible you ever read the Bible
[1:35:11] what was that he did to prove his
[1:35:12] messiahship to both the Jew and all the
[1:35:14] rest of the people well this is the end
[1:35:16] time and the prophet said the Sun would
[1:35:18] rise in the east it' be a dark day not a
[1:35:20] day or night but in the evening time the
[1:35:22] sun would shine again is that right
[1:35:24] it'll be light in the evening time this
[1:35:26] is the light that he spoke of the light
[1:35:28] is Christ he's the light of the world
[1:35:30] he's a shining and he shine on the
[1:35:32] Eastern people in the beginning of
[1:35:34] Pentecost they had the same thing and
[1:35:36] they took heat as these ignorant
[1:35:37] fishermen that had been with Jesus
[1:35:39] because they done the works of Jesus and
[1:35:41] in the western world after the church
[1:35:42] age and denomination it's
[1:35:45] ceasing oh God it's ceasing it's dying
[1:35:51] and thanks be to God for that but we're
[1:35:54] coming into the real age
[1:35:57] now the old leot see in church age
[1:36:00] brother sea is dyed it's ceasing but
[1:36:03] we're coming in the real age now and the
[1:36:06] Christ is shining forth His blessings to
[1:36:08] the people again you might not want to
[1:36:10] believe me because I'm not a bishop or
[1:36:12] some Cardinal but God don't always use
[1:36:14] Bishops and Cardinals sometimes he uses
[1:36:17] fisherman and so forth like that so he
[1:36:19] can take nothing and declare something
[1:36:21] if I was a cardinal you might think I
[1:36:23] was smart enough to have some kind of
[1:36:25] psychology or something but I'm not a
[1:36:27] cardinal I'm your
[1:36:30] brother brother Terry let's see he's

[1:37:01] broken heart it's a little nephew of
[1:37:03] yours and he's Afflicted he's a little

[1:41:39] all heard me say these things before he
[1:41:41] said what is it it's unclean
[1:41:43] spirits what they're trying to do is
[1:41:45] they're trying to wear down the people
[1:41:47] they're trying to oppress the people
[1:41:49] they're trying to get the people to give
[1:41:51] in he said listen oh oh therefore behold
[1:41:54] Exodus 3:9 behold therefore the Cry of
[1:41:56] the TR of Israel is come unto me I have
[1:41:58] also seen the oppression where with the
[1:42:01] Egyptians oppress them come now
[1:42:03] therefore and I will send thee un
[1:42:05] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[1:42:08] people the children of Israel out of
[1:42:12] Egypt brother B said now one day a
[1:42:14] broker came by and he saw a bunch of
[1:42:16] slaves working on a certain Plantation
[1:42:19] 100 more slaves and they were sad
[1:42:22] brother son why were they sad because
[1:42:24] they were away from
[1:42:27] home Lea is not my home this world is
[1:42:32] not my home many times they were with
[1:42:34] them because they wouldn't work they
[1:42:37] thought they would never go home again
[1:42:39] babies they never see Papa and Mama
[1:42:41] they' never see their relation they'
[1:42:43] never see and they were very downcast as
[1:42:46] it's so easy to become especially when
[1:42:49] you're oppressed that's what the devil
[1:42:52] likes to work on you in oppress you know
[1:42:53] that's a trick of the devil to oppress
[1:42:55] but when the Christian knows his legal
[1:42:59] rights amen when you can quote God's
[1:43:02] word I'll never leave thee nor forsake
[1:43:04] thee that takes all the oppression away
[1:43:08] and the clouds begin to clear back but
[1:43:11] if you just know that God is promised
[1:43:13] and God's faithful he can keep his
[1:43:15] promise or he would have never promised
[1:43:19] it that that what what what Drive drives
[1:43:23] the clouds back what pushes back the
[1:43:26] heaviness what what releases you from
[1:43:28] the downtrod and downcast is when you
[1:43:31] remember I'll never leave
[1:43:33] you I'll never forsake you when you
[1:43:36] remember the revelation of his never
[1:43:39] failing pres oh my brother said what
[1:43:42] happens he says you see it and rejoice
[1:43:45] let me say this in Psalms 33:1 the Bible
[1:43:47] says rejoice in the
[1:43:50] Lord amen oh ye righteous for praise is
[1:43:54] comely for the
[1:43:57] upright can I have a few minutes on this
[1:43:59] can I can I have a few minutes and
[1:44:00] closing is that all right for praise is
[1:44:03] comely for the upright did it say now
[1:44:07] listen friends it did not say the spirit
[1:44:09] of heaviness in Isaiah 61:3 listen at
[1:44:13] this to appoint of them that mourn and Z
[1:44:15] to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of
[1:44:18] joy for mourning that little bow in the
[1:44:20] Heart Belongs some oil in there the oil
[1:44:23] of Love is in there look here and the
[1:44:25] oil of joy for morning the Garment of
[1:44:28] Praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[1:44:31] they might be called the Trees of
[1:44:34] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:44:36] that he might be
[1:44:38] glorified oh church as long as you're
[1:44:41] wearing the spirit of heaviness you're
[1:44:44] out of your position but when your
[1:44:46] garments change from the spirit of
[1:44:48] heaviness to the praise of God the Bible
[1:44:51] says amen that you will be giv God glory
[1:44:54] in your situation look at this word
[1:44:56] heaviness it is a dim it is a dull it is
[1:44:59] a colorus it is a a faint look I found
[1:45:03] this amazing that in the Bible heaviness
[1:45:05] is the strongest of the three Greek
[1:45:08] words in the New Testament for
[1:45:10] depression in Psalm 69:20 look what
[1:45:12] David says he says reproach hath broken
[1:45:16] my heart and I am full of heaviness I

[1:59:49] tonight as a group of people Lord
[1:59:52] a body of
[1:59:53] Believers Lord a Bible bride not a
[1:59:57] man-made bride not a Creed bride not a
[1:59:59] traditional
[2:00:00] bride a bride that has been smitten out
[2:00:03] of the age Lord your Prophet said she
[2:00:07] was smitten out of the age she was
[2:00:08] raised up in but Lord she did that
[2:00:12] because she was to carry the bride's
[2:00:15] Revival Lord as I heard your Prophet say
[2:00:18] today he said that man there in Welsh he
[2:00:21] said he went there to find the Revival
[2:00:24] he found a policeman there on the corner
[2:00:26] swinging his Billy stick and he walked
[2:00:29] up to him he said
[2:00:30] sir he said I'm looking for the Welsh
[2:00:32] Revival where is it he said Look No
[2:00:36] Further you found it he said it's here
[2:00:41] it's in my heart I thought oh God lord
[2:00:45] if you had left us in that layot of sin
[2:00:47] age we would have to be identified under
[2:00:50] some denominational Revival
[2:00:52] under some man-made organization or some
[2:00:54] Creed or Lord some opinion of a group of
[2:00:57] men that put their minds together and
[2:00:59] come up with truth on the subject but
[2:01:02] Lord you called us out of that age it's
[2:01:05] dying Lord It's ceasing and Lord you
[2:01:08] called this bride into the real age the
[2:01:10] bride age Lord under the evening light
[2:01:13] under the opes of the revealed word of
[2:01:15] the hour Lord the Holy Ghost can't be
[2:01:18] bound in this bride age there's
[2:01:20] something in our hearts
[2:01:22] we've tasted the good word Lord many
[2:01:25] hearts that were stooping underneath
[2:01:27] heaviness stooping underneath confusion
[2:01:30] Lord father how many hearts Lord when
[2:01:33] your Prophet come on the
[2:01:35] scene they were stooping they were
[2:01:38] stooping underneath men's impersonations
[2:01:40] of a messiah sign trying to stand there
[2:01:43] and Lord as I've heard many testimonies
[2:01:45] of how Lord that Pentecostal preachers
[2:01:47] would get little earpieces and
[2:01:49] microphones and things and hear little
[2:01:52] reports about people and say things in
[2:01:53] their ear and they would stand there and
[2:01:55] try to discern it out and call this out
[2:01:57] and had somebody tell them and call the
[2:01:59] Lord father what a what a spirit of
[2:02:02] Oppression hung over the church when you
[2:02:04] raised up a prophet in this generation
[2:02:06] and he stood there not after night and
[2:02:08] he hit Time After Time and there never
[2:02:11] was one assumption there was never one
[2:02:13] confusion because it wasn't the spirit
[2:02:15] of William brandom it was the spirit of
[2:02:17] Truth it was the spirit that had been
[2:02:20] bound by those denominational River
[2:02:22] the spirit of Truth the spirit of
[2:02:24] accuracy the power of infallibility had
[2:02:27] been released into the age and Lord it
[2:02:29] took a prophet right out of that age
[2:02:31] into a bride age and he stood there and
[2:02:33] called your people out into the word
[2:02:35] father I'm not ashamed tonight to be
[2:02:38] identified with the power of healing by

[2:11:44] tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:11:49] [Applause]
[2:11:52] you know there is a true power in the
[2:11:54] message of the
[2:11:56] hour it is not just a message it's not
[2:11:59] just another man that has come with his
[2:12:03] ideas but it is truly the Lord that has
[2:12:08] come with healing in his wings to offer
[2:12:11] healing for the not just the physical
[2:12:14] but the the mental the the spiritual and
[2:12:18] I thoroughly enjoyed it tonight
[2:12:22] I so wished I so wish that you know you
[2:12:25] could get
[2:12:26] people just to focus on the message of
[2:12:29] the
[2:12:30] [Music]
[2:12:31] hour it there's no need to be confused
[2:12:35] in this
[2:12:36] age you know the you wish that people
[2:12:41] wouldn't follow personalities you just
[2:12:43] wish that people wouldn't follow after
[2:12:47] big Ministry or gifts uh um that ain't
[2:12:52] even tried and
[2:12:54] true you just wish you
[2:12:56] know every gift every gift that that is
[2:13:01] exercised must be tested it must be it
[2:13:06] it must
[2:13:08] be
[2:13:10] uh
[2:13:11] brought and and and I can't think of
[2:13:15] that word but you never found a prophet
[2:13:19] never found a prophet that that stood
[2:13:22] before men to be
[2:13:24] judged because he had thus sayth the
[2:13:27] Lord and he was truly Vindicated but
[2:13:30] every other gift must be
[2:13:33] judged and it's just so sad that people
[2:13:36] get caught up in the
[2:13:39] confusion when we got such a beautiful
[2:13:42] message that keeps us from
[2:13:45] brokenhearted it it's supposed to heal
[2:13:47] our
[2:13:48] hearts and I I really enjoyed the quotes
[2:13:53] there brother BR or brother Andrew just
[2:13:55] reading of uh the discernment line and
[2:13:59] and that that true discernment was
[2:14:02] exposing Devils it was it was defeating
[2:14:06] Devils it never gave the devil room to
[2:14:09] work it just never did because it was a
[2:14:12] true discernment it was a true gift and
[2:14:16] I tell you it I encourage you church I
[2:14:20] encourage you young people feed off the
[2:14:23] message of the hour feed off the
[2:14:26] word you don't want to become anemic you
[2:14:29] don't want to become so weak uh to where
[2:14:32] when troubles come hey troubles
[2:14:35] everywhere and that is no surprise to
[2:14:38] any of us we've already heard a prophet
[2:14:41] preach about the world falling apart we
[2:14:44] already had a prophet preach and expose
[2:14:46] the devil in the church he didn't expose
[2:14:49] him in the barroom he didn't expose him
[2:14:52] in the clubs and the nightclub he
[2:14:54] exposed him in the church and and so so
[2:14:59] it should never become a shock when we
[2:15:02] see the devil working and and moving and
[2:15:05] when you're seeing the world crumble and
[2:15:08] and things falling AP and you see all
[2:15:10] the turmoil we shouldn't be so shocked
[2:15:13] and so bothered and so move to where we
[2:15:17] can't we can't press on and we can't
[2:15:19] overcome it and and we just don't know
[2:15:21] what to do we should know what to do
[2:15:25] that's why we should feed on the word
[2:15:27] and feed on the word you know and and uh
[2:15:33] because God's looking for strong
[2:15:35] Christians in this age so if your heart
[2:15:38] is broken if there's things that just
[2:15:41] ain't ain't you know and and you're just
[2:15:43] feeling just all fragile stay with the
[2:15:47] message feed off this unfailing word of
[2:15:50] God it'll strengthen you it'll help you
[2:15:54] overcome it'll get you R you're ready
[2:15:58] can you say amen amen and I believe
[2:16:01] that's where the bride is today God
[2:16:04] bless you is our prayer and may you just
[2:16:07] feed off the word that you've heard
[2:16:10] tonight and uh just soak it into your
[2:16:14] soul and um you know find time to pray
[2:16:19] find time to get along and get into the
[2:16:22] word of God read and pray and listen to
[2:16:26] the the message that God has sent us in
[2:16:29] this day can you say amen God bless you

[2:17:00] challenges still but uh doing good and
[2:17:05] so we want to uh just keep brother Shmi
[2:17:07] and sister Bethany in our prayer and I
[2:17:11] know they're
[2:17:12] exhausted and
[2:17:14] um I I think that comes with

[2:17:21] I guess when we got our first child when
[2:17:24] Seth come along I my world changed and
[2:17:28] uh you know and it just seems like it
[2:17:30] keeps changing every child you get and
[2:17:34] uh you never look back it's just uh it's
[2:17:37] a glorious thing and so we want to keep
[2:17:40] them in our prayer that the Lord will
[2:17:42] just uh bless them and and give them
[2:17:46] strength that they could uh uh make a
[2:17:49] way where they can come to church amen
[2:17:51] and God will just help the baby to grow
