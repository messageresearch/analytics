[35:56] [Music]
[36:01] first of all I have a testimony
[36:06] um it was in March the last of March um
[36:11] I went for a regular
[36:14] mamogram and um they called me and said
[36:19] that uh they needed me to come back that
[36:22] they needed to do another one and they
[36:25] would have a doctor there in uh then
[36:28] they would do a ultrasound that my L
[36:31] nose were
[36:32] swollen and um so in the
[36:37] meantime um it would be about a month
[36:39] later uh that I would do that but uh
[36:43] around that time I got really sick and
[36:47] couldn't go so then they put it off till
[36:51] uh June it was last week but in the
[36:55] meantime the first
[36:58] week uh around that time after I found
[37:02] out I I kind of worried about it and was
[37:06] real concerned and brother Sean preached
[37:09] one night and after he
[37:12] preached uh someone had come up for
[37:16] prayer and he was praying for him and I
[37:19] felt lad to go down and be prayed for
[37:21] and I did and after that it really
[37:25] didn't bother me I really rested
[37:29] and I felt like everything was okay so
[37:32] they set it up after i' had gotten sick
[37:34] they set it up for last week well this
[37:37] past
[37:38] Thursday well I went
[37:41] and they just took every picture they
[37:44] could take I think they was doing an
[37:48] album and
[37:50] um uh they would take two a three and
[37:53] they'd come back and they'd say the
[37:55] doctor says that we need to take uh two
[37:58] or three more and they'd take two or
[38:00] three and they'd go back and they' uh
[38:04] come back out and they'd say the doctor
[38:06] says we need to take two or three more
[38:09] and um then they come back out and they
[38:14] said the doctor feels like something's
[38:17] hiding they need to take two or three
[38:20] more and I thought there is nothing
[38:23] hiding and the song kept going over in
[38:26] my mind
[38:28] uh you know everything's okay you know
[38:33] um and so finally they came back out and
[38:39] you know during that time I was supposed
[38:41] to have that and then have a ultrasound
[38:43] but they came back out and said uh
[38:46] everything's okay you can come back uh
[38:49] in a year for your regular
[38:52] checkup so I just wanted to give praise
[38:57] to God God I believe you should do that

[1:00:51] image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had
[1:00:54] set up and they stood before the image
[1:00:57] that Nebuchadnezzar had set up then a
[1:01:00] Herald cried aloud to you it is
[1:01:03] commanded all people Nations and

[1:02:08] came near and accused the Jews they
[1:02:11] spake and said to the King
[1:02:12] Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever thou
[1:02:15] oh King has made a decree that every man
[1:02:19] shall hear that shall hear the sound of
[1:02:22] all that music shall fall down and

[1:02:51] King have not regarded thee they serve
[1:02:54] not thy Gods nor worship the golden
[1:02:56] image which thou has set up then
[1:02:59] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[1:03:02] commanded to bring Shadrach Meshach and
[1:03:05] abedo then they brought these men before
[1:03:09] the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[1:03:12] unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach
[1:03:15] and abedo that you uh do ye not serve my
[1:03:19] gods nor worship the golden image which
[1:03:21] I have set up now if you be ready at
[1:03:25] that at what time you hear the

[1:03:47] midst of a burning fiery furnace and who
[1:03:50] is that God that shall deliver you out
[1:03:53] of my hands what a question eh
[1:03:56] Shadrach Meshach and abedo answered and
[1:03:59] said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:04:00] are not careful to answer thee in this
[1:04:03] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[1:04:09] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[1:04:11] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[1:04:15] of thine hand O King but if not be it
[1:04:20] known unto thee Oh King we will not
[1:04:22] serve thy Gods nor worship the golden
[1:04:25] image which thou H has set up amen you
[1:04:29] can have your
[1:04:31] seats I may go ahead and continue
[1:04:34] reading finish this chapter
[1:04:37] up but it says in the 19th verse then
[1:04:40] was Nebuchadnezzar full of
[1:04:43] Fury and the form of his Visage was
[1:04:46] changed against Shadrach meach and abedo
[1:04:50] therefore he spake and commanded that
[1:04:52] they should heat the furnace one seven
[1:04:56] times hard more than it was um want to
[1:05:02] be
[1:05:03] heated in other words they they they
[1:05:06] they made it seven times hotter than
[1:05:09] normal and he commanded the most mighty
[1:05:12] men that were in his army to bind
[1:05:15] Shadrach meach and Abednego and to cast
[1:05:17] them into the burning fiery furnace then
[1:05:21] these men were Bound in their coats and
[1:05:25] their hoses
[1:05:26] and their hats and their other garments
[1:05:29] and were cast into the midst of the
[1:05:31] burning fiery furnace therefore because
[1:05:34] the king's commandment was urgent and
[1:05:37] the furnace exceeding hot the flame of
[1:05:41] the fire slew those men that took up
[1:05:43] Shadrach Meshach and abedo and these
[1:05:46] three men Shadrach mesach and abedo fell
[1:05:49] down into the midst of the burning fiery
[1:05:52] furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was
[1:05:55] Aston
[1:05:57] and Rose up and in haste and spake and
[1:06:00] said unto his counselors did not we cast
[1:06:04] three men bound into the midst of the
[1:06:06] fire they answered and said unto the
[1:06:09] king true oh King he answered and said
[1:06:12] lo I see four men loosed walking in the
[1:06:15] midst of the fire and they have no hurt
[1:06:19] and the form of the fourth is like the
[1:06:24] son of God
[1:06:26] amen I think that's very powerful and
[1:06:30] not only just powerful but fitting for
[1:06:33] our day and age that we're living
[1:06:37] in and here these men were in captivity
[1:06:44] um due to the sins of the
[1:06:49] nation and um God had allowed them to go
[1:06:54] in into captiv ity but you know um
[1:06:58] thinking of what a challenge that would
[1:07:01] have
[1:07:02] been um for them I mean here's it's not
[1:07:06] just a little uh little
[1:07:09] meeting uh that uh the king had called
[1:07:12] but he had called for all nations this
[1:07:15] was like a superpower the ruler of of
[1:07:19] the world at that time and yet he uh
[1:07:25] being a wicked
[1:07:27] king um and we know that uh the brother
[1:07:32] randam teaches us that that image was
[1:07:35] Daniel actually it was he made an image
[1:07:38] unto a holy man and and he' made that
[1:07:41] image like an unto
[1:07:43] Daniel uh but uh but yet it it was a
[1:07:47] forced
[1:07:49] worship of um you know and this was the
[1:07:53] the how the Gentile dispensation I guess
[1:07:56] come in into play the Gentile kingdom
[1:07:58] was by a forc
[1:08:00] worship and so here here the pressure
[1:08:05] that these men must have
[1:08:07] felt um it it's you know I mean it says
[1:08:12] nothing about their friends standing up
[1:08:14] it says nothing about you know their
[1:08:17] families standing up says nothing I mean
[1:08:21] you know and you know uh uh and all of
[1:08:25] us you you you know good and well they
[1:08:26] had to have had some friends they had to
[1:08:29] have some type of family uh I know they
[1:08:32] they worked in the palace but uh you
[1:08:35] know and things like that but we all get
[1:08:37] around somehow you know and we we have
[1:08:40] friends we have uh Communications you
[1:08:44] know uh with people but uh and yet uh so
[1:08:48] here's all these people bowing down
[1:08:52] every one of them bowing down and the
[1:08:54] pressure of that that uh must have been
[1:08:57] pretty great to make them think what in
[1:09:00] the world am I doing am I stupid you
[1:09:03] know is this is this you know is this
[1:09:06] something that you know am I being a
[1:09:09] little too hard am I being a little too
[1:09:13] uh dominant here and am I being too
[1:09:16] narrow-minded you know uh all of these
[1:09:19] things uh might must have been in their
[1:09:22] minds but they kept the promise that
[1:09:25] thou shall not have no other God before
[1:09:27] me and and they kept that word in their
[1:09:29] heart and no doubt they kept meditating
[1:09:33] upon these things because they had had
[1:09:36] uh given themselves over to the Lord
[1:09:39] many years ago they had decided to serve
[1:09:42] God and you know when you make a
[1:09:45] decision to serve
[1:09:47] God you don't know what you're going to
[1:09:49] Face Tomorrow you're not going to know
[1:09:52] what you face going to face 10 years
[1:09:54] from now right when you feel the call to
[1:09:57] preach when you feel the call to to
[1:10:00] whatever or maybe even you young people
[1:10:03] when you find your the mate that you
[1:10:06] believe that God has has uh given you to
[1:10:10] marry and and you're going to start out
[1:10:13] in life and you're going to move on in
[1:10:16] in life and you know and and and you
[1:10:18] make these decisions you know of love
[1:10:21] and commitment and and all these things
[1:10:24] but you never know what's down the road
[1:10:27] you never know what challenges you're
[1:10:28] going to face and what things you're
[1:10:31] going to meet and and and that's just
[1:10:33] the way it is with all of us when we
[1:10:35] make a decision to serve God and this is
[1:10:38] why uh uh and and and the this these
[1:10:42] boys here even though they they they
[1:10:45] were Jews by nature and they were God's
[1:10:49] people by nationality if you want to say
[1:10:52] it that way uh but
[1:10:55] it was more than just well I'm a Jew so
[1:10:58] I'm just this what I'm going to do
[1:10:59] because they weren't the only Jews in
[1:11:01] that in that Kingdom uh there there was
[1:11:05] a lot of Jews a whole nation in
[1:11:07] captivity and all of them even though
[1:11:10] they were Jews they they forgot they
[1:11:12] forgot that they were you know what kind
[1:11:14] of a people they were they forgot that
[1:11:17] they had there was Commandments they
[1:11:18] forgot that they were to serve one true
[1:11:20] Living God but but these these men young
[1:11:24] men they they had purposed in their
[1:11:27] heart that you know what I I I gave my
[1:11:30] heart to the Lord I I I I know I'm just
[1:11:33] a Jew by I'm a Jew by person you know
[1:11:35] nationality and I know my history and
[1:11:38] and all these things but there was
[1:11:40] something down in them that they wanted
[1:11:42] to be more than just that they they
[1:11:45] really I believe they they wanted to
[1:11:47] serve a real living God they they wanted
[1:11:50] to to please God they they wanted to to
[1:11:56] walk with God they wanted to honor God
[1:11:59] lord and and I I think that's I think
[1:12:02] that's a real Christian it's it's more
[1:12:05] than just being raised in
[1:12:07] message and their message ranks it's
[1:12:10] more than just you know well my parents
[1:12:13] were message and I've always been
[1:12:15] message and I've you know I've raised in
[1:12:17] a Christian home it it's more than that
[1:12:21] there's got to come a time where you
[1:12:23] know uh we purpose in our heart I'm glad
[1:12:27] for what Mom and Dad was but I had to
[1:12:29] make a purpose I had to make a decision
[1:12:32] to serve God and when I made that
[1:12:35] decision I didn't understand the trials
[1:12:37] that I'd be facing I I had no idea you
[1:12:42] know the things that I would go through
[1:12:45] uh but I purposed in my heart not
[1:12:49] because I was forced to do it
[1:12:52] Nebuchadnezzar was forcing people to do
[1:12:54] it to to worship this image but uh but
[1:12:59] neb or these these boys they they they
[1:13:03] weren't serving God by force they they
[1:13:05] weren't serving God by tradition this
[1:13:08] was something that was just in their
[1:13:10] heart to do they love the Lord and
[1:13:14] always kept God be before their face
[1:13:17] they always kept God in their heart I
[1:13:20] thinking of the time of even Daniel you
[1:13:23] know when when you know the Daniel and
[1:13:27] the three Hebrew you know we call them
[1:13:29] well Shadrach mesak mot these boys they
[1:13:32] they all were uh required to eat the
[1:13:34] king's meat and they were required what
[1:13:37] it was against their Jewish Traditions
[1:13:39] or religion they weren't to eat all of
[1:13:42] that stuff and and so the King was
[1:13:44] trying to get them to do it there again
[1:13:46] the pressure because there was other men
[1:13:49] that were doing it and and the King was
[1:13:51] offering them the best the best that he
[1:13:54] had to give and and and these things but
[1:13:58] they they they purposed in their heart
[1:14:01] I'm a Christian that's right I'm not
[1:14:03] just Jew by Nature I I purpos to serve
[1:14:07] the Lord I purpos to honor him I've I
[1:14:11] made a decision to give him everything
[1:14:14] that I
[1:14:16] have you know it's in them times that
[1:14:18] your decisions are really going to count
[1:14:22] it's in these times that your faith is
[1:14:25] really going to be challenged as to
[1:14:27] really why you're serving the lord you
[1:14:30] know uh you say well I've never been out
[1:14:32] in the world well why have you been out
[1:14:34] in the world is it because you were just
[1:14:37] taught not to do them things or is it
[1:14:40] because you purposed in your heart I'm
[1:14:42] not going out there because there's
[1:14:44] always going to be chances there's going
[1:14:47] to be the pressures and and as time goes
[1:14:50] on the pressures are going to mount the
[1:14:54] the the the the the the the weight of
[1:14:57] being a Christian is really going you're
[1:14:59] going to feel it because the world is
[1:15:02] Shifting so much away from the the
[1:15:05] standards of this Bible it's it's
[1:15:08] actually shifting so far from the
[1:15:12] standards that a prophet taught us that
[1:15:15] if you really ain't purposed in your
[1:15:17] heart to serve God and you're serving
[1:15:20] God because mama said it and daddy said
[1:15:23] it and you believe in a prophet because
[1:15:25] the the mom and dad and the preacher and
[1:15:28] well I'm just I'm a message kid I was
[1:15:30] raised in a message bench you on a
[1:15:33] message bench you understand what I'm
[1:15:34] saying well then the pressure is going
[1:15:37] to come the questions are going to start
[1:15:41] com in your way the the adversity is
[1:15:45] going to is going to come and you will
[1:15:47] not be able to stand against it if there
[1:15:50] ain't something in your own heart that
[1:15:53] you purpose to serve god with everything
[1:15:57] it has to be your choice it has to be
[1:16:00] something you purpose within you when
[1:16:03] you're when you're on that internet and
[1:16:05] and them pornography and them pictures
[1:16:07] of them dirty women and and your flesh
[1:16:10] wants to look at them things you got a
[1:16:13] purpose in your
[1:16:14] heart when when you're alone away from
[1:16:18] Mom and Dad and some of you have grown
[1:16:20] up your your young men your young women
[1:16:23] and and Mom and Dad have no doubt they
[1:16:26] could give you advice but they can't
[1:16:28] tell you what to do and the places to go
[1:16:30] and the time to return home and and what
[1:16:32] to look at what to listen to and the
[1:16:35] friends to hang around and all that you
[1:16:37] you're grown up and I I pray that you
[1:16:40] purposed in your heart to serve God and
[1:16:43] to know God as a personal savior someone
[1:16:48] that is not just a god of my mom and dad
[1:16:50] not a just a god of a prophet not just a
[1:16:53] god of the pastor not just a god of the
[1:16:56] Elders of the church but I want him to
[1:16:58] be my God can you say
[1:17:02] amen and this is where they were this
[1:17:05] wasn't Pastor you know standing up there
[1:17:08] with them and saying uh uh these are my
[1:17:11] these are my favorite boys now and
[1:17:13] they've been loyal church members they
[1:17:15] PID their tithes and and their offerings
[1:17:18] and they they help me out in the church
[1:17:19] you leave them alone no that the pastor
[1:17:22] wasn't there to help them mom and Dad
[1:17:25] wasn't there to help them amen not
[1:17:27] nothing was there to stand they had to
[1:17:29] stand on their own and all the millions
[1:17:33] out there amen could have understood
[1:17:36] exactly why if they would have recanted
[1:17:38] and said okay okay I I understand and
[1:17:41] then they all would have said see oh
[1:17:43] yeah see yeah yeah I knew you'd come to
[1:17:45] your senses I knew that see that's way
[1:17:47] all of us were we you know of course
[1:17:49] we'll serve God later on but right now
[1:17:52] let let's just give the king let's just
[1:17:54] satisfy is a little fancy you understand
[1:17:57] what I'm saying but no no they they
[1:17:59] understood they weren't trying to stand
[1:18:01] down they didn't want to try to be
[1:18:03] different they weren't trying to be some
[1:18:06] holier than thou but they had
[1:18:08] convictions they they had purposed in
[1:18:11] their heart they had purposed in their
[1:18:13] life their life had purpose and it
[1:18:16] wasn't to give into a king it it wasn't
[1:18:19] to bow down to some Idol it was to serve
[1:18:23] the Living God
[1:18:27] amen yes sir we're living in a

[1:19:07] and and he's trying to take the the the
[1:19:11] the magnitude of this message out of our
[1:19:14] hearts he's trying to to take the the
[1:19:17] the the importance and how sacred uh uh
[1:19:21] uh this message is to us you see this
[1:19:25] message is a guideline to every aspect
[1:19:28] of Our Lives it isn't just to tell us
[1:19:31] about church order it sets our homes in
[1:19:34] order it it sets our lives in order it
[1:19:38] sets our our conduct in order it sets
[1:19:41] our belief system in order it it gives
[1:19:45] us a balance to
[1:19:47] everything and and it's something that
[1:19:49] we live by when we say we're message
[1:19:52] people it's something that we live by
[1:19:54] this messages are absolute I'm not here
[1:19:57] to argue the message I'm not here to
[1:19:59] dissect and pick and choose what I I
[1:20:02] want and and then you know uh uh uh
[1:20:05] leave the rest of it to whoever else
[1:20:07] wants the left the remaining part amen
[1:20:09] that comes back to well you know what's

[1:20:35] message church so that's all I know
[1:20:37] about God well if that's all you know
[1:20:39] you'll never get the benefit of God and
[1:20:42] you'll always be Wayward you'll never
[1:20:45] understand the emphasis of this thing
[1:20:47] amen this message is power this message
[1:20:50] is reality this message will show you
[1:20:53] Christ a living Christ but you got a
[1:20:57] purpose in your life to serve
[1:21:00] it you see if if he would have never
[1:21:03] served him what what if the Hebrew
[1:21:06] boys what if the Hebrew boys would have
[1:21:08] bowed down to that image what if they
[1:21:11] would have given into the pressure the
[1:21:13] threats the
[1:21:16] adversity now and church I I have to
[1:21:19] tell you they were only a a a type of us
[1:21:23] in this day true that was a natural
[1:21:26] thing we're facing a whole far bit
[1:21:29] greater enemy than than that and I have
[1:21:32] to tell you young people parents
[1:21:34] preachers we all are facing it we may
[1:21:38] not be standing before a literal
[1:21:41] Idol that we may we we may be Satan
[1:21:45] wanting to put in a television before us
[1:21:49] yes wantan to bring in filthy women
[1:21:51] before us wanting to bring in in in in
[1:21:55] all kinds of of uh doctrines and Creeds
[1:21:59] and things that are totally wrong right
[1:22:02] before us can you say amen I I
[1:22:04] understand everybody's making this well
[1:22:06] brother brandom brother brandham being
[1:22:07] the holy man and and we're making him an
[1:22:09] image I I I think people are totally
[1:22:12] missing that that point yeah there are
[1:22:15] people that are worshiping him and
[1:22:16] deifying him and they're just as far and
[1:22:18] cuckoo as as the day is long you
[1:22:21] understand what I'm saying but but more
[1:22:23] than that what what are we worshiping
[1:22:26] that's right what are we bringing in
[1:22:28] what what I mean even the the the Bible
[1:22:31] David says I have set no evil thing
[1:22:33] before mine
[1:22:35] eyes can you say say Amen what about
[1:22:37] brother Bram talking about women being
[1:22:39] the the object of worship in these days
[1:22:42] guys on can you say amen I mean there
[1:22:46] there's all kinds of images there's all
[1:22:48] kinds of worship brother BR said you can
[1:22:50] worship your car you can worship your
[1:22:52] family you can worship your children you
[1:22:54] you can worship your job you can worship
[1:22:56] your money you can worship you you can
[1:22:58] worship anything amen can you say amen
[1:23:02] and and and we know that men are
[1:23:04] becoming lovers of pleasure more than
[1:23:05] lovers of God they're becoming self-
[1:23:08] lovers of self so they can even worship
[1:23:11] themselves the pet the pet feelings and
[1:23:15] pet ideas and and all of this thing it
[1:23:19] becomes a
[1:23:21] worship can you say amen amen
[1:23:25] and and and we as they we have to
[1:23:28] purpose in our heart but what if they
[1:23:31] did not purpose well they would have
[1:23:33] never seen the revealing of the son of
[1:23:36] man they would have never seen the son
[1:23:38] of man
[1:23:39] come can you say Amen the others didn't
[1:23:43] see
[1:23:44] it amen them were sitting there giv in
[1:23:47] and and and and worshiping the
[1:23:50] image they would they didn't see nothing
[1:23:53] but it was because
[1:23:55] they purposed in their heart to stand
[1:23:59] there can you say Amen they purposed in
[1:24:02] their heart to to serve God no matter
[1:24:06] what it takes true they even said if it
[1:24:10] be so King if you're able to carry out
[1:24:13] the threat that that you claim to to
[1:24:16] carry it out remember seven times harder
[1:24:19] and you're living in an age that is
[1:24:21] seven times
[1:24:22] worse than any other age you're dealing
[1:24:26] with demons far
[1:24:29] greater
[1:24:31] hello it's far worse than any
[1:24:34] fire
[1:24:37] true if God never did did deliver them
[1:24:40] how long would have taken them to
[1:24:43] die
[1:24:46] instantly from just from the
[1:24:48] heat because did not the Bible just did
[1:24:51] we not just read that the guys that
[1:24:53] threw him in there
[1:24:55] they perished they they didn't even go
[1:24:57] into the Flames it was so
[1:25:01] hot ain't that right so it would have
[1:25:03] been an instant
[1:25:05] death but we're not just instantly dying
[1:25:08] I mean we're facing things day after day
[1:25:11] day after day day after day day after
[1:25:13] day trial after trial trial after trial
[1:25:16] Tri it'd be far easier just to give up
[1:25:19] and go
[1:25:20] on can you say Amen it'd be just so much
[1:25:24] easier have you ever just tried to swim
[1:25:26] upstream have you ever tried to float
[1:25:28] Upstream so much easier just to set the
[1:25:31] paddles down and quit The Strokes and
[1:25:33] just lie back and and let the let the
[1:25:36] stream take you so much easier to go
[1:25:39] that way but if they wouldn't have stood
[1:25:42] they would have never saw God In His
[1:25:44] glory but because they stood there was a
[1:25:48] one in the a son of man amen that stood
[1:25:52] there with them in the fire and I say to
[1:25:55] you the son of man has come in the
[1:25:58] greatest evil age to stand with you he's
[1:26:02] standing with you protecting you keeping
[1:26:06] you from discouragement keeping you from
[1:26:09] quitting keeping you from
[1:26:12] destrction keeping

[1:26:35] families keeping our minds
[1:26:38] intact keep keeping us
[1:26:41] same many people are leaving losing
[1:26:44] their convictions I I was thinking of
[1:26:46] the Methodist and how they were you know
[1:26:48] they they had they had they had
[1:26:50] sanctification packed down man uh uh you
[1:26:53] know and and you hear Brother Bram

[1:26:58] uh no jewelry whatsoever and all that
[1:27:01] and I sh the boys downstairs you know uh
[1:27:04] they had the oldtime fashioned tent
[1:27:06] meeting uh that going on Methodist
[1:27:09] Church you know and and so showing them
[1:27:12] what their Revival is a man in shorts
[1:27:15] you know and and uh is a mess you know

[1:27:21] Revival of today amen people that used
[1:27:24] to they're the one that brought in
[1:27:26] sanctification Wesley did a ain't that
[1:27:30] right he's the one that brought in
[1:27:31] sanctification and now look where how
[1:27:33] far they've drifted amen and if we're
[1:27:35] not careful we'll be people that'll
[1:27:37] drift too but God will never let his
[1:27:40] elect drift because there's somebody
[1:27:42] that's going to say I'm going to stand
[1:27:44] I'm going to stand I'm going to declare
[1:27:47] the word of the Lord I'm going to
[1:27:48] believe this message I don't care what
[1:27:50] pressure it comes my way I don't care
[1:27:53] what it takes I'm going to stand to
[1:27:55] believe God's
[1:27:56] word that's where we're at today we're
[1:27:58] going to stand to believe God's word and
[1:28:01] if you don't stand God will be dead to
[1:28:03] you but if you will stand there will be
[1:28:06] a living Christ a living reality walk

[1:28:50] might be feeling the pressure to just to
[1:28:52] just to bow down to the pure pressure of
[1:28:54] the world young people but stand there
[1:28:57] with all confidence he will deliver me
[1:29:00] he will deliver me they didn't have the
[1:29:01] answers they did not know that that
[1:29:03] Fourth Man was going to come in that
[1:29:05] fire they had no idea but they were so
[1:29:07] confident in their God that he would
[1:29:10] show up in time and he did show up in
[1:29:13] time Hallelujah and he will deliver you
[1:29:16] he will deliver you you don't have to be

[1:29:25] it I just believe it he will
[1:29:28] deliver he
[1:29:30] will we stand here today knowing that he
[1:29:33] will
[1:29:34] deliver he
[1:29:36] shall because he promised it am they'd
[1:29:40] been resting upon the word of God they
[1:29:41] had been feeding on the word of God no
[1:29:45] doubt living in that in that Palace
[1:29:47] Church it wasn't easy for them to do
[1:29:49] that they were living in a palace that
[1:29:52] was a wicked Palace it wasn't the Palace
[1:29:53] of King
[1:29:57] David it was a palace of a
[1:29:59] heathen Heathen Gods Heathen
[1:30:03] atmosphere Heathen ways yes
[1:30:07] amen Heathen
[1:30:10] worship amen everything Heathen
[1:30:13] everything went against what they
[1:30:15] believed but they live there I guarantee
[1:30:18] you they were feeding off that word they
[1:30:20] were listening to that Prophet Daniel No
[1:30:23] Doubt Daniel would share things that
[1:30:25] would come to him amen from God and they
[1:30:29] would listen to it and their hearts
[1:30:31] would yearn for it can you say amen amen
[1:30:35] I think how gracious God was to send
[1:30:37] them a pro give him a prophet in that
[1:30:39] age in that time of living in Babylon
[1:30:42] God would give him a prophet amen
[1:30:46] Daniel Daniel had to face his problems
[1:30:48] too but he
[1:30:50] stood but God would show up and close
[1:30:53] the miles of the lion for
[1:30:55] him amen and yet all of them were our
[1:30:58] types every type of the Bible amen more
[1:31:02] all of them of Daniel and and and well
[1:31:05] Esther I believe and Ruth well all of
[1:31:07] them amen Ruth and Boaz and they they
[1:31:11] all fit our
[1:31:12] type and if you wonder if God will ever
[1:31:15] show up on the scene for you go back and
[1:31:17] read the
[1:31:18] Bible if you ever wonder if God will
[1:31:21] ever fail or be faithful to you go back
[1:31:23] I can read this Bible God is faithful if
[1:31:27] he done it for natural people what will
[1:31:29] he do to his own
[1:31:32] elect that stand for
[1:31:35] him that's true that'll serve him with
[1:31:38] all that's within
[1:31:39] him have you purposed in your
[1:31:42] heart I'm going to serve the Lord I'm
[1:31:45] going to serve the Lord ain't giving in
[1:31:48] to the pressures of life this world's
[1:31:51] got totally different standards they've
[1:31:52] got totally different IDE they got
[1:31:54] totally different ways just like
[1:31:57] Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians and
[1:31:59] everyone else they had their own
[1:32:02] standards and there was the Hebrew boys
[1:32:03] with their standards well where did them
[1:32:06] boys get their standards by a prophet's
[1:32:09] message that's exactly right they follow
[1:32:12] the prophet Moses they follow the
[1:32:15] prophets of the Old Testament amen and
[1:32:18] they they St I I guarantee you their
[1:32:20] mama read them I I hope she did anyways
[1:32:24] but but somehow they knew God in in some
[1:32:27] way that that in a greater way than the
[1:32:29] rest of the people knew God Amen but
[1:32:33] they're they they knowing god kept them
[1:32:35] with standards kept them with a purpose
[1:32:38] amen and when the world Amen wanted them
[1:32:41] to Bow under that
[1:32:45] pressure they
[1:32:47] stood ain't going to Bow I may not
[1:32:51] understand everything but I ain't
[1:32:52] bowing I I I may not have all the
[1:32:55] question or answers to all the questions
[1:32:57] that are floating but I ain't bowing I I
[1:33:00] may not understand everything and and
[1:33:03] and yes the Bible says that the children
[1:33:04] of the world are wiser and smarter than
[1:33:07] the children of of of the righteous the
[1:33:10] children of the light so they could take
[1:33:12] this Bible and a lot of them can twist
[1:33:14] this Bible in such a way that leaves us
[1:33:17] Amen to where we just Spellbound amen
[1:33:19] but it doesn't matter I'm standing on a
[1:33:22] Vindicated
