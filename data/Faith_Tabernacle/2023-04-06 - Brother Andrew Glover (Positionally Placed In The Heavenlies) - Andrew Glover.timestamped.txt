[29:14] want to look there in the second chapter
[29:16] and you all can turn these uh monitors
[29:19] here off I'll just use my ear monitor in
[29:21] the book of Ephesians the second chapter
[29:24] we want to look in the fourth verse I
[29:26] know it's a very very familiar reading
[29:30] to us this evening
[29:31] amen Paul says but God
[29:35] who is rich in Mercy
[29:37] for his great love we're with he loved
[29:40] us how many is thankful for his love
[29:42] even when we were dead in sins
[29:46] hath quickened us together with Christ
[29:48] he says by Grace ye are saved amen now I
[29:53] love this sixth verse and hath raised us
[29:56] up together and made us sit together so
[30:00] there's a Unity here raised us up
[30:02] together and made us sit together in
[30:05] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[30:08] the ages to come he might show his
[30:11] exceeding exceeding Riches of his grace
[30:13] and his kindness towards us through
[30:16] Christ amen we asked the Lord this
[30:18] evening to add the blessing to the
[30:19] reading of his word as you can be seated
[30:21] here this afternoon I want to by the
[30:24] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[30:25] tonight if the Lord will help me I want
[30:27] to speak to you here on positionally
[30:29] placed in the heavenlies positionally
[30:32] placed in the heavenlies I know maybe
[30:35] the last time we spoke to you all we
[30:36] spoke to you on a thought of we are
[30:38] heavenlies in our souls amen we are
[30:40] heavenlies in our souls and we we're
[30:42] coming from there in the book of
[30:44] Ephesians the first chapter where Paul
[30:45] says he hath blessed us with all
[30:48] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[30:50] in Christ Jesus now we found that
[30:53] there's many spiritual blessings right
[30:54] there's Divine Healing he said Visions
[30:57] foreknowledge power but the one I really
[30:59] labored on with you and that thought was
[31:01] on the Revelation amen of his presence
[31:04] being here now amen regardless of the
[31:07] conditions and I'll I'll just say this I
[31:09] was able to listen to the meeting here
[31:11] from Sunday morning and my wasn't that
[31:13] powerful what brother Sean laid out
[31:14] about the presence of God Amen I am
[31:16] thankful to be identified in this hour
[31:18] by the presence of Jesus Christ amen now
[31:21] we find then that the spiritual
[31:23] revelation of his presence being here
[31:25] now amen is the anchor of the soul that
[31:28] no matter what we go through no matter
[31:30] what we face no matter what our bodies
[31:32] Our Spirits our minds anything goes
[31:35] through we have a revelation in our soul
[31:37] that he is here with us and he's here
[31:40] now now the father of God said Jehovah
[31:42] Jireh 64 he said now remember that
[31:44] Christ is risen from the the dead and is
[31:47] Among Us and to get that in your mind
[31:49] Christ has raised from the dead and is
[31:51] Among Us now we've seen all kinds of
[31:54] great moves and shouting and praising
[31:56] God and that's all fine he said we've
[31:58] spoken tongues prophesied all we've seen
[32:00] that he said that comes right along with
[32:02] it but remember the last thing is his
[32:04] divine presence the word itself amen the
[32:08] last thing is his divine presence the
[32:10] word himself he is the word he said the
[32:13] head the word amen it's coming to the
[32:15] body see then that word in Hebrews the
[32:18] fourth chapter said the word of God is
[32:19] sharper more powerful than in two-edged
[32:22] sword and a discerner of the false and
[32:24] intents of the heart he said now take
[32:26] that scripture run it back to the
[32:28] beginning of the prophets and then run
[32:30] it right on down through Jesus Christ
[32:31] and see if it isn't the same thing he
[32:34] said the same thing he is known as the
[32:37] Messiah amen so all the way back from
[32:40] the book of Genesis the third chapter
[32:41] coming up to the present hour amen it
[32:44] was prophesied that Jesus Christ Christ
[32:46] would be here as the Messiah amen but
[32:49] now he's not here in a Corporal body
[32:51] amen but there is another body upon the
[32:54] face of the Earth and it's a mystical
[32:55] body it's a universal body amen it's the
[32:58] bright body of Jesus Christ known as
[33:01] amen the Messiah it of the Messiah now
[33:04] he said he is known as the Messiah it's
[33:06] not some man here is the Messiah amen
[33:08] but the holy spirit is the Messiah amen
[33:12] Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same
[33:14] thing amen so here it is here now just
[33:17] working in the flesh amen getting the
[33:20] body ready for the Rapture and Grace do
[33:22] you believe it friends amen then the
[33:24] hour that we are living in he is not
[33:26] here amen conditioning us or preparing
[33:29] us for another church age amen he's not
[33:31] preparing us for another hour or another
[33:33] age or another season to come amen but
[33:36] this is the final age it's the it's the
[33:38] final voice we're in the final moments
[33:40] amen amen at any time now we are going
[33:43] to blend out of time and back into
[33:45] eternity amen therefore we are getting
[33:48] the body ready for the rapturing grace
[33:50] God's provided Place 65 he said now
[33:52] notice remember the great power of God
[33:54] moving comes into a Son of God it
[33:56] quickens him and the spirit of Life
[33:59] enters into him then what does it do it
[34:01] seats them in Heavenly places now we can
[34:04] all agree from the beginning to the end

[52:37] place is in Christ Jesus now you say
[52:39] what brought about this I'll tell you
[52:41] what done it amen was the full
[52:43] restoration of the word amen is the
[52:46] achievement of God to bring forth Faith
[52:48] to put the bride in the Rapture if the
[52:51] word is not restored then there's not
[52:53] Faith to go in the Rapture if the word
[52:55] is not restored then there's not Grace
[52:57] to go into your heart Amen to take a
[53:00] Rapture because the bride is going to
[53:02] take the Rapture by the word which is
[53:04] the full word this bride will take a
[53:07] Rapture amen by the full word which was
[53:10] restored under the voice of Malachi 4
[53:12] which was revealed under the third pull
[53:15] of the seventh Angels Ministry it was
[53:18] the Fulfillment of Joel the second
[53:19] chapter when he said I will restore Amen

[53:47] I heard him say the day and is there if
[53:48] God be with us and we'll be all the
[53:50] Miracles he said the first question they
[53:52] asked God Amen why is all this trouble
[53:54] befall in us if God be with us then
[53:56] wears all the Miracles amen see is there
[53:59] any hope brother by Adam well blessed be
[54:01] to God I will restore saith the Lord
[54:03] amen all the years amen the blessings at
[54:07] the canker worm and the caterpillar and
[54:09] the Palmer worm everything that's eating
[54:11] it down now watch this the four death
[54:14] Messengers amen eat that tree down amen
[54:17] but to fully restore it amen will take
[54:20] four life Messengers Amen to combat with
[54:23] the four death Messengers done to the
[54:24] tree
[54:25] now can I just preach to you what the
[54:27] prophet said he said now notice your
[54:29] Masterpiece the life that was in the
[54:31] husk Amen in the stalk in the tassel in
[54:34] the husk amen it all gathers in the seed
[54:37] come on Church everything that was in
[54:40] the horse and buggy is in the astronaut
[54:41] everything that was in the automobile is
[54:44] in the astronauts everything ever come
[54:46] on Amen every scientific achievement
[54:48] mounted up into the final achievement of
[54:51] the astronauts amen everything that was
[54:53] in justification is in this bride
[54:56] everything that was in sanctification is
[54:58] in this bride everything that was in the
[55:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost under the
[55:02] restoration of the gifts is in this
[55:04] bride amen see all of the life gathers
[55:07] in the seed and the life that was in the
[55:09] stalk went into the other to make the
[55:11] other and then he turns and says
[55:13] justification made a way for
[55:15] sanctification and sanctification made a
[55:18] way for what the baptism of the Holy
[55:20] Ghost amen people say well that's as
[55:22] high as we can go amen but God was able
[55:25] to achieve amen through those who would
[55:27] stay with his word amen the baptism of
[55:30] the Holy Ghost Amen brother Branson made
[55:32] a way for the Holy Ghost itself Amen to
[55:35] come right down in Perfection amen back
[55:38] to the word again to manifest itself
[55:40] listen friends we have not come here
[55:42] Amen to manifest the Creed we have not
[55:45] come here to manifest a Dogma we have
[55:47] not come here to manifest depression and
[55:50] to manifest complexes and to manifest
[55:52] nervousness amen but God who is rich in
[55:55] Mercy amen has called us into this age
[55:57] Amen to manifest the word in its
[56:00] fullness in its entirety in the deity of
[56:02] the person of Jesus Christ listen amen
[56:04] amen Shake Yourself Faith Tabernacle you
[56:07] got a job to do you got a commission
[56:09] upon you you got to finish line the
[56:11] cross and that is to manifest the full
[56:14] word again like it was in the beginning
[56:17] oh man you're not just manifesting
[56:20] justification you're not just
[56:22] manifesting sanctification or even the
[56:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but the
[56:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost has made a way
[56:29] for the Holy Ghost itself
[56:34] can we say that together the Holy Ghost
[56:37] itself remember said it's time that God
[56:40] will fulfill his word the things that I
[56:42] do will you do also even more than this
[56:43] for I go into my father see it's time
[56:46] for God to prove that his word is truth
[56:49] not only a mythical story not like a
[56:51] Buddha where they produce psychology the
[56:54] Buddhist the Molly Molly is over kind no
[56:56] but there's not another religion under
[56:58] the skies that can produce the signs and
[57:02] the wonders of a resurrected Jesus
[57:03] Christ except somebody accept the Holy
[57:07] Ghost itself working in the people so
[57:11] the Holy Ghost itself amen is not an
[57:14] eighth age with an eighth messenger with
[57:16] an eighth Day idea amen the Holy Ghost
[57:19] itself is the word that was in the stalk
[57:22] in the shuck in the tassel has gathered
[57:25] into the seed Amen to Bear forth and to
[57:27] produce a yield the true Easter seal he
[57:30] said but God give them something then
[57:32] that they cannot destroy is the
[57:35] supernatural spirit it's the Holy Ghost
[57:37] itself and it's infallible and it's
[57:40] imperishable and it cannot be destroyed
[57:43] it'll live on and on and on and because
[57:47] he lives amen we live with him because
[57:50] we're sealed in the body of the Lord
[57:52] Jesus no way no way to ever be destroyed
[57:56] well that ought to make you put your
[57:58] shouting shoes on Amen there's no way
[58:00] you can ever be destroyed I'm going to
[58:02] give you some stuff to fight with okay
[58:04] that devil is trying to destroy you it's
[58:07] time you remind that therefore the
[58:09] anointing that you're under is not that
[58:11] of just testification or just
[58:13] sanctification or just the dip in the
[58:15] Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost itself in
[58:18] perishable amen the undestroitable amen
[58:22] the supernatural Spirit that's
[58:23] infallible has come into your flesh and
[58:26] it is coming there in the form of
[58:29] eternal life testimony of a true witness
[58:31] God's witness the Holy Ghost the Holy
[58:33] Ghost itself amen living in us would
[58:36] never affiliate itself an organization
[58:38] because you cannot organize God and the
[58:41] same thing that happened to them will
[58:43] happen to these in the last days in the
[58:46] evening lights like it was back there in
[58:49] the influence of another 62. how can you
[58:51] hold the office of God's anointed and
[58:53] deny his anointed word which is himself
[58:55] in word form
[58:57] my the word of God's anointed is the
[59:02] word itself in word form how can you
[59:04] deny the word is right and then still
[59:06] say your anoints with the spirit the
[59:08] only thing that'll manifest the word of
[59:10] God is the Holy Ghost itself
[59:15] the Branson then he turns and says when
[59:17] he the Holy Ghost will come he will take
[59:20] these things of mine and will show them
[59:22] to you see and Be not Afraid in 1963 he
[59:25] said I believe in child and I believe in
[59:27] speaking in tongues I believe in
[59:28] interpretation of times I believe in
[59:30] Divine Healing I believe in all those
[59:31] things but yet it's something better
[59:33] than that
[59:35] it's the birth itself
[59:37] are you ready for this it's the Holy
[59:40] Ghost itself coming in US those things
[59:43] are fine that's good but it's like the
[59:45] colored man eating watermelon he said
[59:47] there's more of it you got to go on and
[59:48] to love and joy and peace and long
[59:50] suffering and gentleness and patience
[59:52] amen and the power of the resurrection
[59:54] of Jesus Christ amen burns into the life
[59:57] then we could have a testimony meeting
[59:59] about what God is doing in our midst
[1:00:02] come on I love testimonies from other
[1:00:04] churches amen but what about our church
[1:00:06] amen what's God doing it will you say
[1:00:08] brother Andrew God ain't doing much well
[1:00:10] I resent that line devil amen because
[1:00:12] I'm looking at a house full of Miracles
[1:00:14] tonight I'm looking at people who have
[1:00:16] lived another week in Satan's eating and
[1:00:19] they're still got a mind to serve God
[1:00:20] they've been they're not denying that
[1:00:22] God exists they're not denying the
[1:00:24] message is the truth amen come on church
[1:00:26] tell me where is that coming from it is
[1:00:28] coming from the position that's the word
[1:00:30] has elevated you into come on Amen
[1:00:32] without this message we're just as
[1:00:34] iconic as the other six billion people
[1:00:36] on the face of the Earth amen but with
[1:00:39] this message we have broke beyond the
[1:00:41] Earthbound Realms of cyclonic and
[1:00:43] psychology and all these troubles of the
[1:00:45] mind and Troubles of the spirit and we
[1:00:47] have broke into a place where our soul
[1:00:49] has come face to face with God and we
[1:00:51] are anchored not to the next convention
[1:00:53] not to the next Youth Camp but we are
[1:00:56] sealed until the day of our Redemption
[1:00:58] listen we realize the word is in us the
[1:01:01] Holy Ghost has come upon us he is
[1:01:03] bringing those things that he taught
[1:01:04] into our hearts it's the Holy Ghost
[1:01:07] itself

[1:01:11] of hours of a long study on that fourth
[1:01:14] word the Holy Ghost itself the Holy

[1:01:20] revealer of the written word and he is a
[1:01:22] solar of the things to come then pray

[1:01:33] restoration of the voice of God come on
[1:01:35] Church it broke out under the voice of
