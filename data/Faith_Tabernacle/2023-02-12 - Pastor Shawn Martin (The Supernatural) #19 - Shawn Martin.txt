the grace of God amen Upon Our Lives and amen where would we be without him amen we have nothing to boast about but we can sure have a lot to sing about praise the Lord about and the grace of God Amen well good morning it's good to be here in the house of the Lord and glad we was able to make it and all this weather and and uh it's always good to be in the house of the Lord man we got different ones that are out in the vacation and sick and the whatever but so we want to keep them in our prayer to have service here today and believe the Lord will be with us amen the musicians can be dismissed and enjoyed the worship and the songs that were sung today and um if you have your Bibles we're going to go back to the book of Ephesians chapter 1. and while you're turning there um February the 26th would be on a Sunday where we're only going to have a morning service and um then the evening I'm going to have a Bible study for the young people young couples and so um so just remember that Sunday morning service February 26th and no evening service then so and for you young couples if you've got questions write them down um or just remember them and we'll get together and discuss amen and um if I don't know how to answer your question I'll let you know but by God's help we'll we'll be able to look in God's word and and see if we can help you praise the Lord also I've asked the deacons and really just anyone working in the back but especially the deacons not to be holding babies uh so if you have your child don't pass them to the deacons uh because if anything happens uh if if they're needed on a spot we don't want to put a baby in danger and they need to have their hands free and so uh just remember that I know they would love to babysit your child but they're they they've got a position here so and they've got to make sure they they are available at all times without putting a Child In Harm's Way if that would happen and we might say well we never know you know we're just small we're in Blacksburg but we did have that one that you know came up a few years back and and he made his way to the platform and almost got up here and I thanked the Lord or brother Johnny was sitting over there and he caught it and he took off right here and and grabbed him just in time it was in the middle of preaching and um he didn't like what was being said and and it was it was the weirdest thing because that was on a Wednesday night Tuesday night I I had a real burden for the young people and I was asking the Lord Lord what what would I preach and so I came down here Wednesday morning all day Wednesday just studying and a thought had come to me that morning about the man from Galleria and so I got to just looking that up and how brother Brown talked about that that you know how he's a citizen good citizen family man and he told lie I believe it was or he he done something then he told a lie and he said it just started accumulating the spirit and just accumulating and I fought all day long that day of use depression just feeling just uh uh oh it was horrible and my wife had come down while the songs were gone said everything okay and I said I don't want to go up there something's something's wrong I just don't know what it is I'm just fighting something so anyway I came up and just started preaching and and the man was sitting back there where Mindy's at and and um you know he had his head down the whole time I welcomed him uh so I'm glad to be here and so anyway we got to preaching about the man of gathering and uh got talking about you know the demons and then I was saying of how that you know uh think of how worse it is today than it was back then and what they had back then and yet he accumulated all them demons just by lying and by this and here we got movies and and things like that and and uh he got up and and he walked out and and passed the the brothers and and and so I was watching him as I was preaching and then he turned around and I just saw it uh it was just a wicked face and and I knew it wasn't him but uh just demonic and here he come you know and he'd come walking all the way down here and and anyway it that is and he caught everybody off guard is what it did you know and so I was really thankful that brother Johnny uh he was aware enough he said he had been watching him out of the corner of his eye and watched what he'd done and uh so so then the brothers come and and helped him out and he was yelling you know stop stop you know these young people don't need to hear this stop and so I knew I was on target then so um yeah you know the Lord has his way ain't that right so anyway we want the deacons to be free they're hands-free and so if you don't mind just uh respecting that today sir as from now on but um also those that were in Florida good to have you back I'm glad you made it home safely amen hope you had a good time I heard it was in the 80s up there and so I almost left too you know but uh beautiful weather I'm sure but good to have you back home amen the book of Ephesians the first chapter and the 22nd verse it says Anne hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that feeleth all in all amen let's just bow our heads talk to our Lord father we just come to you with Humble Hearts Lord knowing that we're just mortal people father it's got a lot of maybe things that we go through and limitations and was just Humanity Lord but we also know that we're your children and there's something Eternal living within his father and it's pulled us to come to your house today and father we've gathered under a promise that where two or three are gathered in your name you would be here Lord and you promised that and father you you said for us to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together even the more as we see the day approaching and we believe that we're here in this day father and and Lord we've come gathered and we're now asking that you would just move Among Us Lord Speak Lord through these mortal lips and I pray father that you would help the people to receive anoint Lord not only me but anoint the hearts of your children father may we be elevated in Heavenly places this morning Father oh God May the Eternal speak and may the Eternal receive we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you can have your seats this morning and we certainly want to keep brother and Walker and Sister Walker in our prayer and the Lord will just be with him encourage them and um there are great Veterans of the Gospel amen but you know we we have uh reading here from the book of the Ephesians and and we've we've talked of how that the book of Ephesians parallels the the Book of Joshua and um you know again brother Brahm said you know I think it was in the message Paradox but he says the the Book of Joshua was the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament it was it is a book of redemption it is a book of redemption and brother Branham taught us that there are two parts of redemption uh and that was the coming out of and going into and so the the Book of Joshua uh dealt with the second part of redemption and that was going in in two and and so uh and and we find the commission that God gave Joshua and to be strong to be of good courage and um and and these things but uh then then here brother Branham says and we find out that we've come we have come to another Ephesians another Ephesus now and he says where that in our intellectual denominations and so forth and all of our educational programs has come to its Jordan and we know what Jordan represents this death so it's come they've come to their death they've served their purpose and now they've died ain't that right and and remember they had to come to Jordan first before they come into the promised land and so he says see it's Jordan it's come to its Jordan then we must have an Ephesians again we must have an exodus to come out see and to go into for the Rapture so as as in and so in one sense as looking at that quote we could we could look at it that that we're not waiting for in Exodus the Rapture would not be the Exodus that he's talking about but that we've got to have an exodus before we go into a Rapture and so which would fulfill now again I know brother Brown talked of of Exodus and I do believe that we are we are an exodus people of coming out from the from Mortal to immortality and these things but I'm talking about the Exodus that you should have now and and Revelations 8 18 4 says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people now you don't come out of her my people uh when you go into a Rapture these this this Exodus should be happening now or should have already happened but come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you received not of her plague so so when brother Brown said we must have an exodus I believe that's the Exodus he's talking about for he says we must have an exodus and and and go into for the Rapture and so uh The Exodus is come out of her my people and and so now that that's a a that's a challenge uh for every broad member for every if you're going to interrupture you got to come out out of her so you've got to come out of her Traditions come out of her teachings come out of her doctrines so many people amen they come into the message but they're holding on to to traditions of of years goal and and these things and you can't do that uh uh you've got to come out of her doctrines you've got to come out of her system you got to come out of her unbelief you see come out and go into for the Rapture ain't that right now some people may think that they're okay because they're not part of the denomination well I go to an independent church I'm a non-denominational but still that does not make you okay uh because uh uh Israel we we understand that the the reason why God brought Israel out of Egypt that Exodus coming out was because he had a land for them to go into and and so uh uh when anyone you know uh anyone that refused to follow and uh that Pillar of Fire a man they died they perished they God would not allow them a to raise a nation uh in in the wilderness it just couldn't do it amen and and see the land was their inheritance so God would take them out of something that was not there years well it didn't belong to them uh and and even though they were in slavery God never looked at them as slaves he looked at them as another people it's separate and and so he would bring them out by a mighty hand amen but but be the land was their inheritance they could not overcome until they went into their land they they could not overcome cities they could not establish themselves as a nation until they went into the promised land ain't that right they went into other other nations then uh Esau's uh they went through the land of Esau the land of Moab and and and different ones but but they they were not to to to dwell there they were not to uh to argue with them they were not to uh remain with them they had a land to go to ain't that right and so uh uh we we find that they could not overcome anything thing until they went into the land and brother Brown said the land represented the age of the Overcomer ain't that right so so those who refused to go into they came out but those who refused to go into a man perished a man and and so we we find that the reason why they could not go unto into because Paul would tell us of their unbelief uh the hardness of their heart uh uh uh they they were full of unbelief ain't that right and and it proved it because when they saw their Giants now they had the promises and remember the spies went on in into the land and and and they had the promise with them they had the supernatural they had they had the atonement they had the rock they had all of these things a man but when they went into that promised land they saw the Giants and and and the giants made them look like grasshoppers ain't that right and you know I mean the the compared to the size of these Giants and and and then they saw the walled cities and and all of these things they forgot about the promises a man and their heart because what they saw they were filled with their heart was hardened a Man became hardened at at the the obstacles in in the land that they saw ain't that right but see God told them that they would overcome but but but they would overcome by the supernatural ain't that right it would take the supernatural for them to overcome amen and so here we are we're in that Ephesus again we are in that time of going into and I believe brother branham's Ministry fit both Joshua and and Moses I I believe it was the message that brought us us out of of uh from her from that that system but I also believe that the message of the hour is a Joshua Ministry a man that would lead us into the promised land ain't that right or the land of promise and and and I believe that that uh uh adoption is a promise I I believe that that healing is a promise I believe a body changes a promise I I believe the catching away is a promise I believe the Millennium is a promise I I believe Heaven the the new Heaven A New Earth is a promise I I believe that that that we're not just entering to something in a natural sense amen but we're actually entering into an eternal uh uh Promises of God ain't that right amen and and so but but but see the Rapture is in the promised land the the the Millennium is in the promised land if you want to say it that way amen uh uh your body changes in a in the promised land everything that we're looking for if this end time is in the promised land amen so you got to come out and you got to leave it all because you cannot go into the promised land a man land a promise until you cross Jordan and Jordan is a time of death it's that's what it represents your ideas have got to die man's Traditions have got to die our old thinking has got to die amen everything that you've been taught has got to die amen if it's not according to the message of the hour it's got to die anything right you you you can't bring a man all of these things along with you we we uh uh and I hope that makes sense I know there's other people that claim to be prophets and they can't claim to be the uh uh you know uh uh something to lead the people but that's I I don't I don't believe that I believe that there are are a five-fold Ministry prophets amen but they're not leaders in the sense that the bride has to listen to them ain't that right and usually when you find people like that they'll seclude their Church from everybody else Amen to where the church all they know is them and and a prophet or brother Branham and most of the time it's them exalting their own Ministry even above brother Branham amen and they don't they and and a lot of churches don't know that there's other evangelists out there they don't know that there's pastors out there they just think they're off on a little island and you know why it's because that man maybe he's got a gift maybe he's got something special and and and he uses that to bring the people to himself brother Branham even says he uses it to bind the people to him can you say man well we're not here to bind the people to us I believe you ought to have respect a band for the men of God I I think that's what the Bible says give honor where honor is due ain't that right I believe believe that you are to follow the pastor as as as Paul would tell us follow me as I follow Christ ain't that right that that's exactly right but if the pastor is not following the message if it's not in the Bible don't follow it amen that that's just the way it is if the Evangelist ain't following the message don't follow it amen if if the fivefold ministry a man is not following the message don't follow it because I believe that God sent us a Joshua to take us over into the promised land ain't that right so so we're not here to exalt other gifts we're not here the the the one thing that I wanted to exalt of course is the is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but we see that the Lord Jesus Christ amen is is is Vindicated this message thoroughly can you say Amen it is so thoroughly Vindicated that that that I should never have questions uh about the message of the hour amen and I don't want you having questions about the message of the hour so I want to preach it in such a way that when you leave this building and you keep leaving these services that you it I never build up questions about whether brother Branham missed it here whether he was here whether he's here I say if God Vindicated it's good enough for me and it's good enough for you can you say man amen why why do we want to be like this is because I want you to be so sure that this message is right I want you to be so sure that it is the absolute for this age because it's time amen that you've got to go into the promised land amen you've got to go into your inheritance and you can't do it amen with questions in your mind you can't do it amen with doubt of of whether the message is right or some of it is inspired some of it is in it and and you're so confused I understand people worship brother Branham amen but you know when I come into this message it was it it it it it it wasn't no mystery that brother Branham was a man I could stand here and preach to you brother bran was a man brother Brandon was a man brother Brandon was a man and all I'm going to do amen is is calls doubt to come into your mind Amen to where everything brother Brown says you're going to question it amen but I want to show you a man that is the miracle not that he's a man he is a man amen he made mistakes he told us about them things that the miracle is is that there was a God that would vindicate his ministry so fairly amen that you can look past the man and see God can you say Amen you can look past the man look past his failures look past it all and say well if God Vindicated him well I'm going to follow him if God amend what he said I'll amen it too amen if God showed up with him amen then I want to be part of it can you say Amen it was so supernaturally Vindicated amen so we ain't got time Amen to be around messing around and and and questioning this and questioning that now I understand you got questions maybe I've got questions amen as far as I don't understand what he said amen but I believe it amen so my questions don't go so deep Amen to where I began to question his his ability to teach his ability to lead his ability to say well is he really the one that that Malachi 4 spoke of you understand what I'm saying people get so many questions amen and and they dwell upon the questions amen uh uh uh well you know and and to be honest brother Brown didn't raise the question unbelievers raises the questions brother Branham just told us that there were 16 men that fell off their lives off that bridge that's good enough for me it's the unbeliever that says well I want proof well you know I I just say well them them and I got to be careful you know them dumbos hey man why aren't they seeking proof amen that the Red Sea opened up can you say man why aren't they why why aren't they seeking proof amen that the water turned into wine why ain't they seeking proof that Jesus is really there's the Skeptics that tell us that Jesus was not amen Messiah that he was just a prophet you understand what I'm saying questions doubt can go so it just it's never ending it just constantly goes and constantly goes and constantly goes that I'm here to tell you amen that that there was an answer God provided the answers Amen to every question if you just have the faith to believe it can you say Amen so so it's time to go into the promised land amen and I believe that's where we're at amen we're entering into the promised land and you you might be saying oh my I see the obstacles in my life I see the obstacles and it's just over bear whelming amen well they have the obstacles too but one thing about it they believe the message of the hour one thing about it the message showed them that is the promises amen it's your promise it's your inheritances it's yours to claim it's yours to take can you say Amen there's not one time that Joshua would tell them I know it's too big I know I know I know I don't know maybe let's go to something smaller where it's more easier for you amen no no he would keep them reminded of the promises he would lead them to whatever obstacle it didn't matter amen but it was God leading them ain't that right well the obstacles that come in your life you can either let your heart be hardened by unbelief amen and say well I just can't do it I just don't know or you could look at it and take Courage by the message of the hour amen for God said as I was with Moses so shall I be with you amen we ought to take courage in that amen that if God would never leave brother Adam God will never leave us ain't that right so it's going to take the supernatural in this day for us to overcome it's not by might remember what the Bible says and and actually it was at the coming of The Headstone not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord amen see and so I'm looking at this and I I believe that the church will be the ones to overcome everyone that's part of the Church of the Living God they're the ones that's going to overcome and I don't care what obstacle you know you can look at it and despair you can look at it and say there's no hope you can look at it whatever you want to but I'm telling you it doesn't matter what kind of a devil there is amen that the bride of Christ is facing they're going to overcome amen because of the Church of the Living God Amen and they are the body of Jesus Christ now that makes the difference you're the body of Jesus Christ as we have read the body is the main Central uh the main Central or principal Park the material part it gives form or shape too it's the expression of Amen so the body doesn't make the life what it is the life makes the body what it is amen the body only expresses the life amen the body does not control the life the life controls the body ain't that right so it only expresses the life that's in it amen the body of a plant expresses the life a man that's in it amen the body of of an animal expresses the life that's in it the human body expresses human life ain't that right uh uh uh plant life expresses botany life animal life uh uh or body expresses animal life a man see human life expresses uh uh uh the human body expresses human life amen but then we look at God God needed the body to express himself through hey ain't that right now he could have come up with some some idea of body somebody amen that that he wanted he he created the animals the way it is for for animal life he created the the the the body of plants and all that for uh uh botany alive he created the humans amen the way they are Amen to express human life ain't that right amen and and that's what humans do amen so he could have made himself a body of any of any kind a man and that body would have expressed himself uh uh in that but we find out he did create a body called the Melchizedek the body of Melchizedek ain't that right he lived in that body amen and what did that body do Express God Amen he expressed God he performed the supernatural through that body how did that man stand in there know about Sarah where what Sarah was how did he know about the changing of Abraham name and Sarah's name and and how did he know that she laughed secretly behind him amen it was God living in that body amen and expressed itself himself through the body we find he created a man for himself another body in the womb of a woman ain't that right amen it's the only begotten Son of God for he came through the womb of a woman and called his name Jesus so both bodies expressed amen the god that lived inside of them amen but but God didn't want to create just more bodies and more bodies no he would take he would take uh bodies that had already been born and he would redeem them so that he could live in them and express himself through now that's what's hard for people to understand that God could take a redeemed body and perform the same Messiah sign that he done in the body of Melchizedek and that he done in the body of Jesus Christ and he would stand in this day in a body a human body a seventh grade educated Kentuckian and performed the same Supernatural sign and people don't understand don't believe that but that's what God desired he wanted to take a body a man redeemed that body that he could express his deity through it ain't that right amen soap but he didn't want to just leaving the body brother Branham so that's why we don't put it all to brother Branham we thank God for brother Branham I thank God for his ministry if it had not been for the ministry we wouldn't be here today amen but you can't just sit here and say well I believe in a prophet and then just sit dormant amen not knowing the god of the Prophet that God wanted to take your body as well brother beagle amen and he wanted to express his deity through you he wanted to express deity through through us as human beings ain't that right amen and I'm so glad for that amen that he didn't want to just create another body out there but he would take our sex-born body and he'd have a blood and atonement that was so powerful enough that a holy God could live in this Mortal body and express his power Express his deity Express the supremess of God can you say Amen to think of it that the Mortal body can never diminish God your mortal body can never amen Dethrone God if God is uh if if God was all magnificent on the on the first day of creation amen he still all magnificent if he's Almighty back then he's still Almighty amen if there was nothing greater back then there's nothing greater today nothing greater see God is Supernatural we talked about it Supernatural departing from what is normal usual so as to appear to transcend the laws of nature see it's an uh it supersedes overrides overpowers the natural God can do that God can do that God can soak live in your body a man that he can change you a man for mortal a man from expressing mortal man Mortal Thoughts Mortal Mortal Humanity amen and and all of these things and yet come in that body of corruption and express who he is deity amen the prophet said deity's not in heaven it's in you ain't ain't that right and God would call you the body amen a part of his body because you are just only something that he expresses you're only something that expresses what's inside of you it's so sad that a lot of church speaks people don't believe in the Supernatural can you say man the prophet said he could not be Supernatural if he wasn't omnipotent and that word omnipotent again is having unlimited Authority or influence a force of unlimited power so you're just the body of unlimited power you're you're the body where omnipotent dwells in ain't that right and he's the only one that is omnipotent brother Brown said God likes to show his power not that he has to God doesn't have to show his power but he likes to show his power he loves to do it it pleases him in his omnipotence to let his subjects know who he is oh man you know it's it's one thing to learn about him it's it's one thing you know you those of you that have been to school and been trained for something you know I went to school for electricity and and in class you know the teachers there and and you he's put it all on paper and you're you're studying the books you're you're writing things down you're taking your tests amen and that's one thing you're getting book learning but oh it's another thing to be Hands-On when you get out on the field on the job amen now you're experiencing something that is far greater than your book learning you understand what I'm saying and and so many people have stopped just with book learning amen just coming to church hearing about God learning about God Amen and yet know nothing about his realities amen but God doesn't want you just sitting in a church a man like it's a school amen you're taking your little notes and you're learning about him and all of these things he wants you out on the field so to speak Amen to where you can have your own experiences amen I just you know there's one thing to hear the experiences of my teacher and how he would tell me this and he would tell me this some of them were funny some of them were was horrific and some of them you know wow you know you could understand you know you're teaching you know all these things but but then then was I got out there a man hands on I began to develop my experiences amen and I got some experiences to tell ain't gonna tell you today amen but see uh uh as Christians how many people don't have experiences of God they've learned about it amen they've been taught about it they sung about it they wrote about it amen but to have experiences for yourself amen now that's what God has has come and that's why we are the body of Jesus Christ ain't that right amen uh uh I didn't you know I was studying to be electrician on at at school amen but I became an electrician out on the field ain't that right and God doesn't want you studying about being sons of God God wants you to be sons of God God doesn't want you to study about being a daughter of God God doesn't want you to study about laying hands on the sick God wants you to lay hands on the sick and watch them recover amen God wants you to testify and what some soul come in by your testimony can you say amen God doesn't want just you to learn about overcoming God wants you to overcome ain't that right yes sir amen let's set our sights a little higher amen we're Sons and Daughters of God now not everybody sees his omnipotent power amen because they don't believe in it Amen brother Brown said churches that don't believe in Divine Healing amen and the Performing of Miracles are dying they have withered up to a bloodless cult amen they've withered up to a bloodless cult and and we find that that that it's become a social gospel and the Social Gospel brother Brown said is becoming predominant amen today it's it's so predominant it's because the seminaries and everything else has taken all the phenomenal away from God sure it's easy to take the phenomenal away from God when you're just talking about him it's sure it's easy Amen to take the phenomenal away from the a man from the congregation a man from the church amen when you're just sitting there just doing a little Bible Lesson you know amen well that that's fine for Bible lessons amen but you can take away the supernatural amen the phenomenal of God to where no one says even says and amen anymore amen you just slowly strip the people up strip the church up and all this to where everybody just goes home well that was a good sermon and a lot of people don't even remember the sermon anymore these days because they got baseball on their mind they got movies on everything else on their mind amen but see when you really know the supernatural power of God it's not just something you can forget ain't that right see so when the power of God is taken out of the Gospel it then becomes a social gospel and Social Gospel promotes education knowledge and learning and the prophet says it hatches out Infidel preachers with education instead of Salvation ain't that right ministers who preach a social gospel just stand and talk about little petty things a little bitty Bible stories of the Bible or something like that instead of preaching repentance and bringing men and women to the altar hey you ain't that Ryan see why because they taking the power of God out of the church they've taken the power of God out of the Gospel amen no wonder we just don't think that people can get saved anymore well I'm one to tell you that God can still save a person and we ought to be busy trying to send somebody leads somebody to the Lord if we believe in this gospel ah can you say amen amen that's right I don't think we got to be trained on how to do it I just think we ought to let God to be so alive in our lives amen that it'll pulsate with in us that you just can't help if you hear if you go get a restaurant and you taste that food and you think man that is awesome that's the best steak I've ever eaten you're going to tell somebody about it amen you've experienced it you know it amen ain't that right amen it ain't just the preacher up here just preaching some little old a hum dung of a message you know amen and and everybody just being in their little class and and taking their little notes and all that and then we go out the door and the world has more life in us then God has more life God wants to have a body he will have a body he has a body on this Earth so they make Jesus just a philosopher see because they don't believe that he what he was they don't believe that he is and they don't believe a lot of people don't believe that Jesus is more than just a philosopher or just a prophet amen and so they certainly don't believe in the power of God today amen now brother Brian said they're trying to take all the deity all the glory away from Christ and trying to make him just a prophet if Christ was just the prophet every one of us is lost ain't that right so those who preach a a social gospel deny the blood of Christ they deny the Miracles healings the Holy Ghost they denied the supernatural signs and so again most people have lived their life going to church amen learning about God and yet they've never experienced him in his realities can you say Amen now this is where you've got to come out of come out of her my people can you say Amen come out of her my people amen see they're religious to the core but yet they've never experienced the supernatural God Amen because amen the Social Gospel has lured them has lured them brother Branham types the Social Gospel he Likens it to a snake he said a snake can catch the eye of a bird and he can get the direct hold on that bird amen and he can make that bird come right off his Roost flutter right around and around and around and come right straight to the snake's mouth I'm told that this eye of a snake is so powerful that when it catches the eye of a bird it charms him lures him right into the snake and they say that little bird will flutter and flutter and flutter coming down and if it don't quickly start raising its head and shaking from that snake and start looking upward it'll never free itself that's the only way it can free itself can you say amen and that's the only way he says that the church can free itself Amen to come out is to look at Christ of who he is amen and God in this age did not reveal Christ through some Sunday school lesson he revealed himself by the supernatural God being manifested upon the Earth today and we can say that's Jesus Christ amen that's Jesus Christ I know there's a lot of uh impersonations and you got a lot of speaking in tongues a lot of prophecies a lot of shaking a lot of emotions a lot of that amen and and and and and there's a lot of impersonations of all of that amen but there's a real one stick keep your eye up on Christ amen there's a more Supernatural anyone can shake and cry amen win a million dollars and see what happens to you amen you talking about oh I'll jump amen I'll be excited you know what I'll do I'll go calling everybody around that I know that I just won a million dollars you understand what I'm saying you ain't gonna have to you ain't gonna have to push me brother Terry to say that amen there's something about it amen that has got me excited ain't that right amen if that's just something normal that's I mean that's just something that a a human being will do amen so you come into church and people can shout and be emotional and all of that and that distilled doesn't have nothing to do with it what we want is God to live in this body amen and reflect his Supernatural power you know the word for social gospel is whoredom whoredom is prostitution it speaks of an immoral woman now the Bible Likens the church as being a woman the Bible calls the Catholic Church a which is a woman immoral woman God sees her as a prostitute why because she's unfaithful to his word ain't that right and all denominations are her daughters and they're prostitutes because they're unfaithful to the word of God and yet they claim to be the Bride of Jesus Christ they deny the word the very God that they claim to serve he's the word and they deny the word ain't that right so as the Bible says they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof amen they deny the power that heals the sick they deny the power that raises the dead they deny the power to cast out demons they they deny that Supernatural power that changes a sinner into a saint ain't that right amen they deny it see they deny it now they're teaching their people amen how to cope with their problems ain't that right hey hey yeah uh uh a a is becoming more welcome in churches their programs in the churches amen because that that's their idea of fixing people's problems that ain't the idea of fixing people's problems get the supernatural back in the in the church and you say Amen well if you're a Believer you can say Amen to that because it's the truth Jesus didn't tell us to go out and and preach the gospel and come up with these man-made ideas man-made programs we were to preach the gospel and lay hands on the sick and they shall recover to cast The Devils out and they would flee ain't that right yes sir so we find amen that that we are to preach the gospel now now Paul tells us what it means to preach the gospel First Corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power notice why that your faith should not rest uh or stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God ain't that right amen not in the personalities of men not not in in in in anything but the power of God and he says so he says my speech am I preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power now notice Paul in writing to the galatian church said in Galatians 1 and 6 I Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel now Paul was telling what gospel he preached it was one with demonstration and one with power ain't that right hey man he wasn't just given a theological sermon he wasn't given a little sermon Ed a little Sunday school lesson no it was priests with power and demonstration ain't that right and he says now he's looking at the galatian church and they were moved he said removed from him that called them into the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another God now which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then then that you have received let him be accursed ain't that right so what was that other gospel that Paul was referring to that they they have turned brother Brown said it was a make-belief gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news ain't that right and more people have turned away from the good news listen to some fiction of some God of a historical God Amen that can't do nothing else today ain't that right well they turn from the good news and what is the good news what is the gospel it's the good news and what's the good news he has risen he's alive he's he he he's he's here today ain't that right brother Brown said the Social Gospel will not meet the challenge of the age it will not meet the challenge of this day you can never come into the promise of land of of the promised land the promises of God and overcome the Devil by a social gospel we are facing a powerful enemy it's the worst darkest age the most evil age ever amen and it's in this age we've got to have something to meet the enemy with Daniel 11 32 the people that do know their God shall do be strong and do exploits great exploits ain't that right now God himself is phenomenal amen he's a Creator being he's Jehovah he is the great reality he is the substance of everything that was made on the Earth the Bible says for all things were made by him and for him so we we look and you can see the power of God God every morning God shows his power by raising the Sun up every morning God chose His power Amen in the springtime amen when when things are so dead and Bleak and looks like there's no hope but wait till the spring comes and God shows his power amen and it in it's it's a it's a it's it's it's a type amen of the Resurrection Life a man that is in the bride amen see he displays his power by sending the Reigns amen setting his rainbows in the sky he displays his power amen by coming down to his subjects and healing their sickness and saving their sins ain't that right see there's God everywhere showing his power amen and as the prophet said it always takes amen the miraculous Amen to to show the omnipotence or to speak of omnipotence amen he says omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence ain't that right amen it's good to come to church but that's not what vindicates the omnipotence it's good to learn about God but that's not what it takes to vindicate the omnipotence amen and if we believe that the omnipotence is in US amen then God works the miraculous through us to vindicate the omnipotence can you say Amen yes sir that's why we're not looking for any other Jesus we're not looking for any other message we've seen the Vindication of omnipotence through the ministry of brother Branham ain't that right and I believe it's through the bride as well so only the miraculous can do that teaching of the word is a very fine thing it comes see uh Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word but it always everybody say it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotent still lives and Reigns we must everybody say we must have the miraculous we must have the miraculous ain't that right I know you preachers believe that right amen we must have the miraculous amen nothing else is going to work don't be satisfied with just having a form of godliness don't be satisfied with just reading this Bible all all year long don't just be satisfied with knowing the the quotes you must have the miraculous ain't that right the prophet said God cannot be Supernatural without being omnipotent but it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and this is why we believe the message is Jesus Christ because the omnipotence has been thoroughly Vindicated not not man Ministry but Jesus Christ has been thoroughly Vindicated by the message of the hour can you say amen that's right and by this message We Know by what we've seen amen we know that Jesus Christ is alive and well today now in 1956 brother Brown said I believe that the church is now standing on the threshold of the greatest Vindication of omnipotence that the world the world has ever known ah to me that's that's powerful because you you creation was one thing and and and what what what a what a show of omnipotence at creation God takes nothing and makes it right look look at all down Through the Ages even into the life of Jesus walking on water turning water into wine raising the dead him himself raising from the dead and all the things that he'd done amen look at what Paul done look what was in the book of Acts look at everything that that was done Through the Ages and yet the prophet would tell us we're on the threshold of the greatest Vindication of omnipotence that the world has ever known and to think of it you're part of it we're part of this so see man has to recognize the omnipotence the prophet said before when it's before him man has to recognize it when it's before him amen so we are as Jesus said there in Matthew 13 16 but bless are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear you're not looking at the omnipotence and saying well that's of the devil that's Beelzebub that's this but now you're able to see that this is the Vindication amen of what the prophets have talked about it's it's what the prophets have longed for amen it's the writers have ruled about this amen it's the greatest vindication so throughout the the scriptures we can see that God chose to show people his Supernatural his his omnipotence miraculous power uh to and through them God would choose certain people for this look at Abraham Abraham was one of them nothing special about Abraham uh uh he was he was an idolter you know and and he was just normal man and and and caught up in idolatry and all these things following the paths of a family tree coming through this this is all he knowed amen his thoughts wasn't even on God and and these things and just worship will is worshiper but probably worshiping some other God Amen his thoughts on the gods that he worship not the Almighty but see God had elected Abraham before the foundation of the world a man and he elected Abraham for a reason to show his omnipotence to show that he's alive and not only that but he would take Abraham and show through Abraham about this day you believe that Avery God would show through Abraham what he would do in this age I think that's powerful so Abraham didn't deserve it but God chose him so God called him amen told him get out of your land come out of your land Exodus come out you know come out you know from the your Kindred come out from the land come out from everything he was to separate he was to separate from his Heathen ways he was to separate from the the his Heathen friends and family he was to separate from his Heathen ideas and thoughts he was to separate from his Heathen worship amen because God is not going to share his glory with another ain't that wrong amen so God chose Abraham to show his mighty power and God didn't want anything else laying claim to Abraham amen God didn't want anything else to lay claim to to the experience that Abraham a man would receive he didn't want unbelief hanging on to Abraham he didn't want Heathen traits and traditions hanging on a man see anything that was against God and that would try to take the place of God Abraham was to separate from why God wanted to walk with Abraham God wanted Abraham to walk with him to talk with him to experience him ain't that right to believe him and he didn't want other other gods to come in between the relationship that would be established between him and Abraham ain't that right God wanted to establish a relationship with Abraham just the same as he wants to establish a relationship with all of us and he doesn't want any other thing to come in between that relationship he doesn't want any other God to get Glory he doesn't want any other object to get glory amen he wants to have the glory amen in your life therefore it would take complete trust and confidence on Abraham's part see you have to believe in the Supernatural if you're going to see the supernatural you're going to have to trust in the Supernatural if you're going to see the supernatural you're going to have to walk with the supernatural if you're going to walk with God ain't that right and have a relationship with him now as God has shown to Abraham and everybody everyone else down Through the Ages amen God will put you through the test that means I've been through tests he'll put you through testing times he'll put you through trials he'll put you to where your back is against the wall he'll put you where you don't know your future you at once thought you knew your future you had once thought you know that that you had everything secure but then God allows you to come into the situation to where you don't know anything anymore have you ever just been there if you ever just said well I just don't know anything about anything anymore I don't even know what happened next well I've been there God allows these things to happen because God don't want you to get the glory God don't want you to flaunt your own self your own talents your own ability your own wits we're not holding ourselves by our wits can you say Amen so God will put you bring you face to face with things that you cannot overcome in your own strengths he will give you promises that you know yourself or you will eventually come to know that you cannot fulfill these promises in your own strength can you say Amen so this is why you have to be separated from everything that would cause you not to believe God ain't that right seek God God wants you to be separated so God requires a total separation from all unbelief brother Graham says when God shows Supernatural with his word he expects you to believe it don't question it believe it can you say Amen now listen church if you're part of the message it should be because you're the result of believing the supernatural your your faith should be should be uh built upon the supernatural can you say Amen that's right because you can take bro you can say well brother Brown said adoption all that and still not believe it in your heart then you'll question it the longer it goes the longer you don't see things going on in your life and the more problems you have and the more faults you have and the more this and Humanity you see you'll actually start questioning what he said about it all right therefore you have to have faith in the Supernatural can you say Amen and that seems Supernatural That's why brother Brown would tell us the angel of the the the what the angel of the Lord follows this message always accompanies the message always can you say Amen so the Supernatural is with the believer today ain't that Ryan see so when God shows the supernatural with his word not just anything not blood coming out of the hands and and the oil falling and coming out of the forehead and all that jazz you understand what I'm saying amen that that stuff people follow we ought to be beyond that I don't care what prophet comes along God will show his Supernatural with his word he expects you to believe it he had promised Abraham and then he by Supernatural had proved it to Abraham can you say Amen so see the the the promises that God gave Abraham were Beyond Abraham's ability to fulfill yes sir amen God promised that he would be the father of many nations and yet Abraham had no child he could not have a child and not through Sarah anyways and God promised that the the child would come through Sarah ain't that right amen that's right see and here Sarah is not able to have it but the Bible says Abraham believed God ain't that right Abraham believed God before he saw the supernatural at work in his life he believed God amen he was a believer so every promise that God gave Abraham he believed it he didn't consider how impossible it was for it to happen he just believed God gave it and it was up to God to take care of it he counted God Faithful that promised the Bible says he considered not his own body now dead considered not the deadness of Sarah's womb ain't that right even Paul said of Abraham in Romans 4 and 20 he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God being fully persuaded that what God had promised he was also able to perform why he saw God as Supernatural so Abraham had fully separated from the voices of unbelief just like we've got to today separate from any voice of unbelief any thought of unbelief he was full of faith ain't that right yeah you might say well he lied he disobeyed he got out of the will of God he left the promise and and went into Egypt and all these things and yes he did but you know what in the New Testament that was that was before the blood in the New Testament you never find anything like that hello when the atonement of Jesus Christ was shed and provided you never found Abraham as a liar then you found Abraham as being fully persuaded that God was able to keep his word Abraham even laughed at God the Bible says that Abraham laughed at God not only Sarah Abraham laughed at God can you say man yes sir but Abraham was strong in faith now look in Genesis 12 and 7 we read and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land Genesis 13 15 and for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and divine seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth uh uh then shall thy seed also be numbered ain't that right now and they yet that promise was given to Sarah and yet Sarah knew she was convinced that it could she herself could not fulfill that promise now we know that Sarah being convinced of that and and discouraged in her heart she convinced Abraham to go to go into Hagar which produced Ishmael ain't that right but notice how God done it it would not be on human effort amen here it was Abraham's effort that produced Ishmael amen see the the the promise being doubted but God told Abraham no Ishmael will not be your seed that's not the one I'm talking about amen see I'm at the end and then it's true now Ishmael was not the promise seed the seed was to come through Sarah ain't that right no human effort this was going to take a supernatural thing and you realize that's what it's going to be for this rapture it's what it's going to be for anything you get in god it's not going to be by your efforts it's not going to be by anything else but it's by believing the word of God God said it he promised it I believe it it's going to be done God can't back upon his word can you say Amen yes sir see you must not get in a hurry I'll close in just a minute but you you're not to get in a hurry and tried to produce the promise on your own it ain't gonna work ain't that right ain't gonna work see because only the supernatural can finish can can do it God gave Abraham the promise when he was 75 years old and then God Waits until Abraham gets into the into a condition to where he's dried up there's no way he could have a child right yeah he's he's what uh 95 99 99 and then here's Sarah a few years younger than him and God's taking his time but Abraham as time went never looked at it he looked at the promise then you say Amen you know I I know this is simple and and yet I'm hoping it's it's going to be a help to you but if we can trust the supernatural then no matter how long the promise Waits no matter how long it takes we can still be at rest knowing it's going to happen ain't that right but we find see so so the age had nothing to do with the promise of God because God wanted it in that way because it would take the miraculous now notice Genesis 17 15 and God said unto Abraham as for Sarah thy wife thou shall not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she will be a shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her ain't that right but it's gonna be not by my nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old sit bear see and Abraham said unto God all that Ishmael might live before thee have we ever just given god's second choice it says God if you could just do a little bit with me if you could just take one little bit you can use then that's fine you can just take one little towel and what little thing and yet God says no we're gonna settle for that I've called you to be my bride and every promise that I've declared I've declared it for you even God Abraham couldn't change God's mind ain't that right so he goes in and he says see the 20th verse and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold uh uh or actually let's go up oh that Ishmael might live before the 19th verse and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with this seed after him and as for Ishmael I have heard thee behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and I will make him a great nation but my Covenant I will establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year ain't that right and then we find out again Genesis 18 10-14 Melchizedek appears to Abraham and gives him the same promise I'm going to visit thee ain't that right why because God's going to show his his omnipotent power and God did and she had a son and God changed their body ain't that right change them from being old uh from old to young again and change the condition to where she could have a child ain't that right they couldn't explain how it happened they just knew it happened and that's the same way with us everything that was there brother Brown said it was the show about us that God's going to change our mortal bodies God's going to change us it looks impossible I understand that but that's not what we're looking at we're looking at the supernatural God can you say man yes sir do you love the Lord amen see we can't even begin to explain the supernatural brother Bram said we cannot bring God down to our level of thinking we've got to rise ourselves to his level of thinking and meet him on the grounds that he provided for us to meet him on ain't that right so we see the seed that God promised was both natural and spiritual Supernatural Israel was the natural lineage of Abraham and of course as God as always he's dealt with Israel as a nation ain't that right and notice what he tells them Isaiah 43 and 1. and and if you've noticed God never forgot his Covenant with Abraham Abraham's long gone and yet he still has never forgot his Covenant and even today he still hasn't forgot his Covenant amen with that natural seed but if God won't forget his natural seed then what about the Covenant with the supernatural seed God won't forget now Isaiah 43 1 but now thus saith the Lord that created the old Jacob and he that formed the O Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine can you say man when did he become years before the foundation of the world Thou Art mine he left it called amen and look in in numbers 24 9 God tells Israel just that natural seed blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curse of Thee my that's just to a natural people ain't that right but God had called them for his own purpose to show his Supernatural power Deuteronomy 30 and 6. he says to Israel the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee ain't that right so we see that Israel is God's chosen people a natural people a natural seed but yet God would choose them to show his omnipotent power and did he do it yes he did look at the Covenant Genesis 22 17 God said to Abraham thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemies ain't that right of his enemies that's right and that seed was not a super seed that seed was just a natural seed ain't that right but God would show amen by a natural seed his Supernatural power a natural lineage yet a people that God would choose and God would allow them to get their back against the wall he would allow them to go into Egypt and become slaves yet that he could bring them out by a mighty hand amen God always delivered Israel by his Supernatural power do you believe that that's why I love just reading about the stories amen of what God done in Samson's life what he done in Gideon's life what he done amen by uh rolling back the Red Sea what he done Amen in Joshua's life what he done in in in in in all the lives of his people because they were a covenant people that God would show his omnipotent through I know it sounds impossible now a man could take an ox golden kill 600 soldiers I believe it was amen he could kill them one man that was a farmer and killed these well-trained soldiers but he was a covenant person he was a person that had a covenant with God that God made a covenant with ain't that right and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy ain't that right yes sir so we're looking at all of these things even how that he calls an ax head to swim amen because a covenant man needed it a man that God had made Covenant with he was in that Covenant and he needed that that's it and God provided it ain't that right God sent fire down from heaven oh my just because a prophet of God called down called it down he Vindicated it Israel was so Vindicated the people of God was Vindicated by God ain't that right yes sir oh do you love him these people were just mortal men they knew what it was to fear they knew what it was to be scared they knew what it was to go through trials and sufferings they had their faults and failures that's Balaam Balaam could tell you all about that amen he thought it was surely a holy God couldn't could not have uh any any dealings with these people amen see and he was going to curse him but the prophet said he failed to see the the smitten Rock the Brazen serpent the atonement he's looking at it through a moral standpoint ain't that right but it was God that had called these people for his glory we may not be much in the world's eyes but we are much in God's eyes can you say Amen God proved that they were part of that Covenant he watched over them by the supernatural he cared for them by the supernatural he lived with them with the the in the in the Supernatural form of the pillar of Fire a man see but then as the prophet would tell us there came that rule seat of Abraham and as I get ready to close but Jesus Christ The Royal Seed of Abraham which is of the faith Seed of Abraham he was the supersede ain't that right and what was he going to do he was not going to produce a natural lineage he was going to produce a spiritual lineage which be which would be a super race in this age a super people aren't you glad for that you know what the bride the prophet calls you the supernatural bride of Christ Supernatural ain't that right amen so here he was the super seed made flesh God in Christ reconciling the world to himself ain't that right and so we find as as we talked about before you know it where the Bible says that that God took on the form of man did not take on the form of a plant did not take on the form of a tree did not take on the form of an animal but God would take on the form of a man not to become human life but that his life would come in the form of a body human body amen so we find he took on the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men he was found in fashion as a man didn't even take on the form of angels that he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh ain't that right and so here the Greek word uh form as we said last Sunday means amorpha brother Brian said that means he changed himself he came down and he changed himself from what he was to what he is or changed his Mass to another Act and he came to take him someone himself the full form of man body Soul spirit to redeem the full form of man back to God that's why he came in flesh and in Soul can you say Amen so there as a man he hungered he thirsted he cried he he he died and and he went and and he felt the pain but yet the prophet said he was born amen with the power in his veins to conquer death and Hell he was the super seed he was born by a supernatural birth ain't that right born by a supernatural birth in Revelations 3 14 says he is the beginning of the creation of God brother Graham said how could God be created he is a spirit he's eternal he said he he never was created and never will be created because God is is at the beginning but he that is the beginning of the creation of God was Jesus Christ when he was made manifest when God lived in him he is God's creation aren't you glad for that he is God's creation what do you think you are amen see he's the first the last the amen the beginning of the creation of God when God created himself a body he come down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of God God came into this little sailing to begin to develop cells Drew from his mother's vitamins and things then when he become old enough to eat himself he began to eat and what is that it's the dust of the earth which you come up and plant life and animal life and so forth and as he began to eat the fish and the bread and so forth it began to develop cells and then when it's fully matured at 30 years old he was baptized into obedience to God in the water and went out and what happened the dove which was God descending from heaven with the voice saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell ain't that right so so only Christ amen only in Christ is God a creation ain't that right amen in Christ amen is God a creation and he was that perfect Masterpiece now I'm trying to get somewhere right fast but God was created in human form in Christ Jesus his son God dwelt see he he built his uh Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel see God With Us he built himself a house to live in so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is when you see Christ why he was the body of God it ain't that right now I'm glad to be a body of God I'm glad in this day that we can be the body of God that omnipotence the same omnipotence that was in Jesus Christ is now in the church today can you say man Jesus Christ was the body of God full of omnipotence when he spoke to the winds and the waves peace be still it happened why it was the creator speaking and the miraculous Vindicated it's to be so when he spoke at the winds at the grave of Lazarus it was omnipotent speaking and the miraculous Vindicated it to be so ain't that right even the Roman Centurion recognized the omnividence that was in Christ for he said just speak the word and my servant shall live an omnipotent spoke and the miraculous Vindicated it to be so ain't that right and God promised he would speak again in these last days every word in the Bible came from the omnipotent god brother Brown said when the omnipotent speaks from the Bible the miraculous will take place where that seed sets root in the heart of the man or woman it'll produce just exactly what the promise is because it's the word of omnipotent it has to can you say Amen if the musicians will come Jesus said that all power in heaven and in Earth is given unto me heal the sick he raised the Dead amen calls the blind eyes to see and notice he conquered the gates that the natural seed could never conquer I think that's powerful he conquered sickness he conquered death he conquered temptation when the enemy sped in his face smote his jaw he turned the other side when they jerked his beard from his face and spit on him he never riled back so he conquered the Gate of Temptation and took it see all those now notice what brother Brown says all of those back there in the Old Testament were just Shadows of his coming you seem conquered conquering through through Samson you see him conquering through David you seem conquering through Moses you seemed conquering through Joshua you see him conquering through all them saints Abode they were just Shadows of his coming what they conquered was testifying of a conqueror to come can you say Amen see they were just Shadows of his coming but when he come he finished the whole fight it's over that Calvary said it is finished ain't that right so the fight was finished at Gethsemane and at Calvary now we just stand as conquerors ain't that right oh think of it every gate of the enemy is possessed brother Brown said there's no fighting to do and you say that with me there's no fighting to do there's no fighting to do think of it see the fight's over we just own it every gate that that Christ overcome and conquered we just Own It abstract deed to it written a written guarantee by God our Father who raised his hand and said I'll swear by myself that his seat shall possess the Gate of the enemy and notice his seed capital S his seat Christ The Royal seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy and there it is it's already took he was wounded by our transgressions with the stripes we were healed it's already done it's a finished work we just possess it and the works that I do shall you do also can you say man that was not given to a natural seed that was given to you and I as the super seed Supernatural seed why because we're living on this side of every gate being conquered we're not seen by natural brother shalomy Isaac was seen by natural seed David all the natural seed but you know what we've received a supernatural birth Jesus Christ had a new Supernatural birth that's how he come and produce Jesus Christ the supernatural birth produce Jesus Christ and that's why you must have a birth it must be a supernatural birth not signing your name on a card not shaking a preacher's hand not coming to church for 10 years and then belonging to a church it not by knowing quotes not by reading the Bible once a year it's it's none of that it's by a supernatural birth that makes you part of this body of Jesus Christ and you're part of a supernatural Supernatural birth part of a supernatural God ain't that right you love him now notice he says the sacrifices paid the rule seed died the Royal seed rose again now the church stands justified by believing that and the Royal seed can come into these people think of it now the Royal seed can come into these people and even make them joint heirs Sons and Daughters of God notice what Paul says and from him to get many sons from him begat see Abraham begets Sons but this Royal seed begets Sons and we're part of that roll seed aren't you glad do you love him isn't he wonderful oh we can go on and on I appreciate your patience but I hope you understand hope you I hope it distracts A Fire Inside you amen no matter what demon you're facing you are the Royal seed of a man you are the supernatural we believe in the Supernatural because we're part of God and he is Supernatural and that's why we can say every promise in the book is mine not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord amen you love him amen what song

brother Bill the different ones thinking of the testimony that they are to us [Music] God's keeping power [Music] you know most of us I guess know a little bit about sister Alice's condition and brother Terry was just talking to us at lunch the other day about it you know that to a lot of people in that her condition it would be frightened they'd be scared they just they would probably give up on life so so many ways that I think of how she's always doing her best to come to the service to Worship the Lord to praise God and yet into all that condition fighting sicknesses and things like that sometimes we don't know what people go through but you young people if you could just know that our elders are not here by their own mind but all the testings that they've gone through and their heart is still so tender toward God they've never let their heart become hardened like the children of Israel and it's it's it's it's something and and the supernatural has been able to express itself through them and and I have to say I see God in them and I I so love them and and I and I say that I I see God in you young people I see God in you parents and I see God in you because I I look past the moral part of you [Music] and I know that you go through your trials you go through your things because I mean just that's just Humanity they don't take a lot of guesswork but but I do have like teenagers I do have children that so I I know what what the Mind battles a lot that they go through The Temptations that they face my boy's face as as young teenagers and things and they they sure face you guys face a lot more than I did back in my day and I I faced a lot that all we can say is God's keeping power in there's a supernatural element that stays with us and never leaves us even through your trials that you you may not feel like you're anointed you may not feel like you're doing any good but that Supernatural element is keeping you I think this is why we can sing that song and it become precious and all my life you've been faith we're not singing all of my life I've known how to do it all my life I've been strong all my life I've never failed but it's you've been faithful you've kept me you've you've guided me you've protected me and I'm so glad for a mighty God that could be here today living in this Horn of Flesh so God bless you may just keep pressing on and may you walk with God may you experience him in such a phenomenal way even more than you've ever had before amen for we are the body of Christ amen let's just bow our heads prayer Matthew you wanna [Music] foreign [Music]
