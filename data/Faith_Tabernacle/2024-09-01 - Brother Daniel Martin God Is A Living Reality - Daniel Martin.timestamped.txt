[46:29] say
[46:30] amen amen John 4 and14 but whosoever
[46:35] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[46:38] him shall never thirst but the water
[46:41] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[46:43] well of water springing up into
[46:45] everlasting
[46:47] life and the woman saith unto him sir
[46:50] give me this water that I thirst not
[46:52] neither come hither to draw Jesus saith
[46:55] unto her go call thy husband and come
[46:59] hither the woman answered and said I
[47:02] have no husband Jesus said said unto her
[47:06] thou Hast well said I have no husband
[47:08] for thou Hast had five husbands and he
[47:11] whom thou now Hast uh is not thy husband
[47:15] and and that thou sayest is true and the
[47:19] woman saith unto him sir I perceive that
[47:22] thou are a prophet our fathers worshiped
[47:25] in this mountain and ye said that in
[47:27] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[47:29] to worship Jesus saith unto her woman
[47:33] believe me the hour cometh when ye shall
[47:35] neither in this mountain nor yet in
[47:38] Jerusalem worship the father ye worship
[47:41] you know what um you worship you know
[47:44] what you know not what you know what we
[47:47] worship for salvation is of the Jews but
[47:51] the hour cometh and now is when the true
[47:54] worshippers shall worship the father in
[47:56] Sp spirit and in truth for the father
[47:59] seeketh such to worship Him amen if we
[48:03] could turn over to
[48:11] Hebrews we all are familiar with this uh
[48:14] and should all know it by heart but
[48:16] Hebrews
[48:18] 13 verse
[48:22] 8 Hebrews 138 says Jesus Christ is the
[48:26] same yesterday today and forever amen
[48:30] are you thankful for that this morning
[48:32] as you can be
[48:34] seated amen I
[48:37] um I have pray that this thought blesses
[48:40] you this morning I've um I've had
[48:43] nothing I I um Dad had asked me a couple
[48:47] weeks to take this service and um and uh
[48:51] so just a few days ago I texted dad and
[48:53] I said you're going to have to take
[48:54] Sunday because I don't have anything
[48:56] I've I had three different thoughts but
[48:59] nothing would come and uh he said well
[49:01] just just listen to messages and I said
[49:03] I've been listening to messages
[49:05] constantly constantly I said nothing
[49:06] will come so we finally sat down for and
[49:10] just calmed my spirit down and this is
[49:13] what just came so I pray that it just
[49:15] blesses you in some way this morning
[49:18] amen but if I were to give it a title
[49:20] this morning um I wasn't sure what to
[49:23] title it but um you know I'd like to
[49:25] maybe title it God is a reality um God
[49:29] is a living reality amen and um you know
[49:32] brother brandham said here that uh Jesus
[49:35] found the people in his day seeking a
[49:39] religion that would bring them a
[49:42] deliverance and they wanted a religion
[49:44] that would deliver them from all their
[49:46] evils and from their enemies and
[49:48] Christianity met every challenge that
[49:51] they asked for and Christian ADM
[49:53] everything that they needed and
[49:55] everything that they asked for it
[49:57] challenged every one of their needs but
[49:59] they would not receive it you know and
[50:01] they uh they they asked they they prayed
[50:04] and when Jesus came and offered his what
[50:07] they needed what they prayed for they
[50:09] couldn't receive it amen it challenged
[50:12] every one of their needs and it's about
[50:14] the same uh uh but they would not
[50:16] receive it and it's the same thing to in
[50:18] this day we find people today seeking H
[50:21] H uh for religion that will do something
[50:23] for them that'll bring a reality to them
[50:27] and uh in real Christianity the word
[50:30] meets every one of those challenges but
[50:33] they won't receive it amen Matthew 5:6
[50:37] says blessed are they which do hunger
[50:39] and thirst after righteousness for they
[50:42] shall be filled and today we are trying
[50:45] to give people we're trying to give
[50:47] people something that they really need a
[50:50] and they don't want it they don't want
[50:51] to accept it they don't want to receive
[50:53] it and yet we know that we have exactly
[50:57] what the world needs today we know that
[50:59] we have the answer for the
[51:02] world and it's the religion of Jesus
[51:05] Christ amen uh deliverance from things
[51:08] that they're fearing uh things that
[51:10] they're needing healing
[51:12] restoration and brother Brenham says in
[51:15] the days when we are here on Earth one
[51:17] of the reasons why that they could not
[51:19] receive Jesus of Nazareth and believe
[51:22] him and get their Deliverance because it
[51:24] was too unusual for them my it didn't
[51:28] come in the way they wanted it to come
[51:29] so they would not accept it it was just
[51:31] it was too unusual too different for
[51:33] them he brought his Deliverance God had
[51:36] sent them a deliverance and it was so
[51:39] unusual to them that they didn't want to
[51:41] accept it because it didn't come just
[51:43] the way that they were used to receiving
[51:46] religion and it's the same thing today
[51:48] the people are today wondering where is
[51:50] the god that opened the Red Sea where is
[51:52] the god that made the lepers well where
[51:54] is the god that set the captives free
[51:57] and we know that he is here today and
[52:00] yet they don't want to receive him why
[52:02] the the the same reason they had it was
[52:04] too contrary it was too unusual and in
[52:08] that day if he would have brought them
[52:10] Creeds or if he would have brought them
[52:12] uh uh some form that they had to go
[52:15] through some rituals or so forth they
[52:17] would have gladly received him my and
[52:21] and but because he brought it in a way
[52:23] uh in the way that he did that people
[52:25] didn't want to receive it in that form
[52:28] that he brought it and that's exactly
[52:30] the same today they don't want it they
[52:32] they they don't want to receive it on
[52:34] the level that God brings it and they
[52:37] don't want to uh go they don't want
[52:39] God's provided way they don't uh they
[52:42] want it but they don't want to receive
[52:44] it on the level that God brings it and
[52:46] and we cannot bring it down to our level
[52:48] of thinking we can't we can't bring it
[52:51] uh down to we got we got to bring it we
[52:55] got to bring our mind to God level of
[52:57] thinking amen and they don't want God's
[52:59] provided way and and we've got to raise
[53:02] oursel to his level of thinking and meet
[53:05] him on the grounds that he's provided
[53:07] for us to meet him on Amen they all use
[53:11] their denomination and Creeds and the
[53:14] Pharisees and they had Sadducees and and
[53:17] they had all kinds of different forms of
[53:20] religion in that day and each one uh had
[53:23] his own idea each one had their own
[53:25] revelation
[53:27] of the word and one believed it in the
[53:29] resurrection and dancing and and the
[53:32] others didn't and one believed it in
[53:34] ciding a Creed and the other was fine
[53:36] with just shaking the preacher's hand a
[53:39] and we would uh present that to the
[53:41] world today if we were to present that
[53:43] if we would take the message and we
[53:45] would just tell the world today well all
[53:47] you got to do is recite this greed all
[53:49] you got to do is just shake my hand they
[53:51] would gladly receive it my hand but when
[53:56] he come in his power and of his
[53:58] resurrection to make his people live and
[54:00] to make his people act right and believe
[54:03] and behave themselves and to change
[54:05] their attitudes to change their ways to
[54:07] change their way of living they don't
[54:09] want nothing to do with that my so
[54:12] they're looking for a God that will not
[54:14] judge them they're they're wanting to
[54:16] walk they're wanting to do whatever they
[54:17] want they want to be able to come to
[54:18] church and and go out the church and
[54:21] live any old way that they want to live
[54:23] and they're looking for a god of love
[54:26] and and we do serve a god god of love
[54:29] but we do serve a god of
[54:31] judgment and God judges Us by his word
[54:34] amen they're satisfied with this uh with
[54:37] with their uh uh religion for the week
[54:39] they come for church for the week and
[54:41] they're satisfied with that and go back
[54:43] and do anything that they want to do the
[54:45] rest of the week my but well when Jesus
[54:48] was born God became man that he might
[54:52] become uh that he might become
[54:54] fellowship with man and in man to what
[54:57] to achieve one purpose and that is to
[54:59] bring man what God is not what a church
[55:02] is but what God is Jesus came that he
[55:05] might present God to man amen and man
[55:09] can't fathom the mind of God we can't
[55:12] fathom the mind of God so so what did
[55:15] the world do today uh they they decide
[55:18] to build their Bible schools they decide
[55:20] to build their seminars to try to
[55:23] understand God through their
[55:24] intellectual thinking my and God is not
[55:28] known by intellectual conception God is
[55:31] not known by by Theology and by
[55:34] psychology God is known by a new birth
[55:37] God is known by the Holy Ghost amen not
[55:40] by any other way the Bible has plainly
[55:42] told us no man can call Jesus the Christ
[55:45] only by the Holy Ghost now the holy
[55:48] spirit will not misbehave itself in one
[55:50] person and behave itself in
[55:53] another and behave itself in another
[55:55] it'll make each person come into its own
[55:58] into its character because it's the
[56:00] spirit that leads you it makes you
[56:02] subject to its nature amen you don't
[56:05] bring it subject to your nature you make
[56:08] it subject to its nature amen when the
[56:11] Holy Spirit comes in you just love to
[56:13] give up the things of the world oh my I
[56:16] remember when I was young and and I just
[56:19] love to do the things of the world but
[56:21] when we got a new birth the things of
[56:23] the world just melted away oh my
[56:26] cleanses you it washes you it puts the
[56:28] desire in you to follow him and to
[56:31] thirst and Hunger for More of it amen
[56:34] you're just bathing yourself amen He
[56:36] makes himself a reality to you my now
[56:41] when God placed men here and in the days
[56:43] of the Lord Jesus he gave him a true
[56:46] road map uh to his power amen amen we
[56:50] all know that road what a road map is we
[56:53] called a GPS today and I remember dad
[56:55] uses in the atlas Maps when we were kids
[56:58] we don't use that no more and thank the
[57:00] lord we don't use that no more heyen we
[57:02] just follow a GPS and if you you want to
[57:05] know you have a desired destination and
[57:07] you don't know where to go you follow
[57:09] that GPS until it comes in your mind and
[57:12] then you remember it and then you don't
[57:13] and then you just keep following that
[57:15] GPS and brother Brown says God wants you
[57:17] to know his word a and we know it we've
[57:21] traveled it we've tested it we've tried
[57:24] it and you know where it leads to
[57:26] amen now his road mapap is is his Bible
[57:30] the word the Bible is the road map that
[57:32] leads to the power of God faith leads
[57:34] you to the power but uh Power produces
[57:38] the
[57:39] promise amen now what does the road map
[57:43] point us
[57:44] to he would come to unite God and man
[57:48] together amen but the Pharisees and the
[57:50] fuce couldn't see that God come to unite
[57:53] man and and himself or God come to unite
[57:57] himself with man but they didn't want to
[57:59] receive it they couldn't understand it
[58:01] Pharisees and the Sadducees they
[58:02] couldn't all understand so they rejected
[58:05] it and Jesus said you Hypocrites he said
[58:07] that you could well discern the skies
[58:09] when you say it's low and red that
[58:12] tomorrow will be foul weather and it's
[58:14] fair you can discern the skies but when
[58:17] the signs of the time you cannot discern
[58:20] if you would have known me you would
[58:22] have known my day my it became a book
[58:25] knowledge to them oh they read the
[58:26] Scrolls they read the scriptures but
[58:29] they couldn't understand it all they
[58:30] could know and it's the same thing today
[58:33] we've got people who who know how to
[58:35] read this Bible they've read it through
[58:37] over and over again every year they'll
[58:39] in January they'll start in Genesis and
[58:41] at the end of the year they'll end by
[58:43] Revelation but they can't tell you what
[58:45] it means they can't tell you that that
[58:48] that it's become more than just words on
[58:51] a page amen these people they uh these
[58:54] these men and women can can quote the
[58:56] quotes and they can tell you and but
[58:58] they don't know the life oh
[59:05] my amen but because they didn't
[59:08] have a reality of who God was when he
[59:12] came they missed it amen you can quote
[59:15] the quotes you can read the Bible over
[59:18] and over again but unless God makes
[59:20] himself a reality to you it does no good
[59:23] you will still miss it yes sir amen he
[59:26] says at that day you'll know that I am
[59:29] in the father and the father in me and I
[59:31] in you and you in me amen he came to
[59:33] bring God and man together where man was
[59:37] made a helper to God and became uh where
[59:41] man was made a helper to God and became
[59:44] a God himself of the earth we became
[59:48] little Gods amen he lost his origin
[59:51] through sin and the Bloods of bulls and
[59:53] goats could not make an atonement for
[59:56] for this sin but the blood of Jesus
[59:58] Christ could do it amen God came to
[1:00:01] redeem man back to himself so he could
[1:00:04] prove himself to his to the world that
[1:00:06] He is Alive and Well in his people amen
[1:00:09] and the only way God can do that is by
[1:00:12] his word my it's God's provided way of
[1:00:15] doing
[1:00:16] things now in the days of Noah they had
[1:00:19] religion they had it for 2,000 years
[1:00:22] like we've had C Christianity and there
[1:00:24] were there were C critics just like
[1:00:26] there is now and in the days of Noah
[1:00:29] what happened we find out that Noah
[1:00:31] stood in that door of the Ark and built
[1:00:34] an ark which was contrary to the human
[1:00:37] beings it was contrary to human
[1:00:40] imagination it had never rained and
[1:00:43] never had been a cloud in the sky but
[1:00:45] God said it was going to rain amen so
[1:00:48] what did Noah do Noah had to build an
[1:00:51] ark amen it's amazing to think that
[1:00:53] throughout the Bible when disaster
[1:00:56] strikes the land that God would call uh
[1:00:59] I mean God would call for a time of
[1:01:01] Deliverance that God would always set
[1:01:03] His prophets to show the people the way
[1:01:07] of an escape my just like Moses when it
[1:01:10] was time for deliverance God God sent
[1:01:13] Moses before the people to show them a
[1:01:16] Deliverance God sent Noah to point them
[1:01:18] to a Deliverance to point them to an ark
[1:01:21] to point them to Christ amen and just
[1:01:24] like he did with Moses when was time he
[1:01:26] he sent Moses with the word to prepare
[1:01:29] the
[1:01:30] people we look at Noah here God said
[1:01:33] it's going to rain it looked impossible
[1:01:36] my we've had many of those situations
[1:01:38] our situation so many times just look
[1:01:41] impossible and that's what God's word
[1:01:43] God says prepare an ark Noah and Noah
[1:01:46] prepared the ark and stood in that door
[1:01:49] and preached salvation amen Noah would
[1:01:52] stand at the ark and says if you want to
[1:01:54] see a living God come in the ark if you
[1:01:56] want to seek Refuge from the Storm come
[1:01:59] in the ark oh my and it's the same thing
[1:02:02] today God sent a prophet at the door
[1:02:06] pointing to Christ saying if you want
[1:02:08] Deliverance come to the ark if you want
[1:02:11] salvation comeing in the ark amen now is
[1:02:14] the time for deliverance God sent us a
[1:02:17] prophet to point us to Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ if you want to see a Rel a living
[1:02:25] reality
[1:02:26] get in the
[1:02:29] ark man if you want to see God making
[1:02:32] himself known to his people we've got to
[1:02:35] get in the ark we've got to get to
[1:02:38] Christ amen they looked at the five
[1:02:41] loads and the fish is being
[1:02:42] multiplied in Jesus's
[1:02:46] day excuse me they they they focused on
[1:02:49] the loaves they focus on the fishes
[1:02:51] being
[1:02:52] multiplied they follow the Miracles of
[1:02:54] Jesus's day but when it came time to
[1:02:57] hear the word they refused it and it's
[1:03:01] so today they look to the healing
[1:03:03] campaigns they they follow that they
[1:03:05] look to the signs and the Wonders and
[1:03:07] the prayer lines but when it comes time
[1:03:09] for the word they refused it oh my it
[1:03:12] didn't match their way of thinking so
[1:03:14] they missed
[1:03:15] it amen we got to quit looking to the
[1:03:18] numbers we cannot base our experience of
[1:03:21] how many people are sitting in the

[1:11:49] message for their day Paul's message
[1:11:51] wouldn't work for this day and and
[1:11:53] brother Brandon's message wouldn't work

[1:12:14] it's not a Baptist idea it's not a
[1:12:17] Lutheran idea it's not even a
[1:12:20] Pentecostal idea but what they couldn't
[1:12:23] uh but they had what couldn't work for
[1:12:25] us today they had a portion of the truth
[1:12:28] back then they had a portion each age
[1:12:30] had their own portion but they got away
[1:12:33] but they got away they created a
[1:12:35] domination and they stepped away from
[1:12:38] the word they stepped away from the
[1:12:39] truth but when they took their eyes off
[1:12:41] the word they lost it and they're trying
[1:12:44] to find their way back to God by their
[1:12:46] denominational ideas and traditions and
[1:12:48] they're just giving the people something
[1:12:50] that died years ago oh my amen aad this
[1:12:55] idea was created years and years and
[1:12:57] years ago and they're still trying to
[1:12:59] present that before the people but
[1:13:01] they're just beating a dead horse so to
[1:13:02] speak they're trying to present this to
[1:13:05] the people and all they're getting is
[1:13:07] dead Works they're just getting ah dead
[1:13:11] religion oh come on

[1:13:21] want to see a living God come to our
[1:13:22] idea come to our idea we've got what you
[1:13:25] need the Church of God says they've got
[1:13:27] the truth amen working there at Camp
[1:13:30] Christie Church of God owns that there
[1:13:32] and and I've have had the privilege of
[1:13:34] uh talking with the uh he says he's the
[1:13:36] pastor of all Pastors in the state of
[1:13:38] Virginia and we've got to talk him back

[1:13:42] him what well how does your religion
[1:13:43] work how does your denomination work and
[1:13:46] so he told me he T he finally stopped

[1:14:03] and and what our church is like and
[1:14:06] things and when we got done he says he
[1:14:08] says Daniel I love talking to you he
[1:14:09] says if we can he says I want to be able

[1:14:17] about it and this is a pastor of all
[1:14:19] pastors over Virginia and you never know
[1:14:21] where that seat is but your job is to
[1:14:24] preach the word job is to stay with the
[1:14:27] word oh my but the Methodist says
[1:14:29] they've got it the Church of God says
[1:14:31] that they've got it but they're trying
[1:14:33] to produce something that isn't
[1:14:35] there amen if you want to see something
[1:14:38] that's got life in it if you want to see
[1:14:40] something that's got life in it if you
[1:14:42] want to see something that can produce
[1:14:44] and can Quicken that seed that's laying
[1:14:46] deep within you come in the presence of
[1:14:48] the S so n come into the presence of the
[1:14:51] son and watch God unveil himself to you
[1:14:56] amen you're not going to see God in in
[1:15:00] Traditions you're not going to see a
[1:15:02] living God in Traditions but God has
[1:15:04] given you his word to make himself a
[1:15:07] reality to
[1:15:08] you amen once you come to the presence
[1:15:11] of that light and surrender your
[1:15:12] thoughts and you surrender your ideas
[1:15:15] and and once all that malice is gone and
[1:15:17] once all that doubt is gone then that
[1:15:19] light will shrink that seed down in your
[1:15:22] heart and will produce the same spirit
[1:15:24] that Christ
[1:15:28] had amen the word becomes a living
[1:15:31] reality to
[1:15:33] you the Bible became a new book and
[1:15:35] you'll know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:15:37] same yesterday today and
[1:15:39] forever amen how many believes to take
[1:15:42] off the Holy Ghost this morning amen God
[1:15:45] God had seen a seed down in your heart
[1:15:48] and once you got rid of that malice once
[1:15:51] you've got rid of that that gossip that
[1:15:53] is laying in there once you got rid of
[1:15:55] that Disobedience once you got rid of
[1:15:57] your own thoughts and your own ideas the
[1:15:59] S so n was able to get that light and
[1:16:02] strike that seed and he became real to
[1:16:05] you heyen not a god of yesterday but a
[1:16:08] god of today a god of tomorrow and a god
[1:16:10] of the next day oh my we've got to stay
[1:16:15] with that word amen God just wants one
[1:16:18] person who can surrender God wants one
[1:16:20] person he can show his power through
[1:16:23] amen the problem we've got today is is
[1:16:25] people just get burned out amen humans
[1:16:28] just get burned out and and they they
[1:16:31] they they've let the message become
[1:16:33] common they they've Let Jesus Christ
[1:16:36] become common now well it's your sister
[1:16:39] Jane up there singing a song well that's
[1:16:41] just that's just so and so up there
[1:16:44] preaching well that's just that that
[1:16:45] song leader again well he's just up
[1:16:47] there and he keeps us too long it's

[1:16:56] Jesus is coming back for years and and
[1:16:59] well you know he still hasn't come well
[1:17:01] preachers are saying well well I've been
[1:17:03] preaching the message for 50 years and
[1:17:05] saying that he's coming since day one
[1:17:07] and he ain't come and they've let it
[1:17:09] become common
[1:17:12] and and let me say this when when you
[1:17:15] may be stuck in a rub but just because
[1:17:18] you can't see what God is doing today
[1:17:21] does it mean he's not
[1:17:23] moving just because you get stuck in a
[1:17:26] rat and sometimes we get stuck in rats
[1:17:28] I'm not going to lie sometimes we just
[1:17:30] wonder why and and but that doesn't mean
[1:17:34] that God's not moving still in this
[1:17:36] church that God's not doing something
[1:17:38] for you that God's not doing something
[1:17:40] for the person beside you amen he's
[1:17:44] still moving we've got to stay with the
[1:17:46] word but see burn out we've become
[1:17:50] burned out next thing you know they're
[1:17:51] just trying to bring this idea that's
[1:17:54] that's what's happening I'm not saying
[1:17:55] this church at all I'm not saying that I
[1:17:57] believe that we we are grounded we know
[1:17:58] what the truth is and we're staying with
[1:18:00] but I'm just I'm just I'm just trying to
[1:18:02] lay examples to you but those the the
[1:18:04] the the so-called message churches out
[1:18:06] there that that have left the message
[1:18:09] what happened was they they they become
[1:18:10] burn out it didn't happen overnight it
[1:18:13] was something that was just building up
[1:18:15] it was this thought that come in and it
[1:18:17] was that thought that come in and and
[1:18:18] and they slowly just let it build now
[1:18:21] well yeah you're right you know we have
[1:18:22] been preaching a long time well I don't
[1:18:25] know well well they're not coming to an
[1:18:27] altar anymore well you know we used to
[1:18:30] have 50 people come to an altar now it's
[1:18:31] down to two well see they they just keep
[1:18:34] focusing on the negative they kept
[1:18:36] focusing and and later than then it
[1:18:38] become become well they're well uh
[1:18:40] they're not they're not they're not
[1:18:41] loving me and and it become all about
[1:18:44] themselves that they let the message
[1:18:46] become common and the next thing you

[1:18:50] Baptist idea and and they said that they
[1:18:54] say well well we're going to witness to
[1:18:56] people but first we got to bring them to
[1:18:57] a Baptist idea before we can get them to

[1:24:48] your praise the Lord and sing the songs
[1:24:50] and lift your hands oh my because he's a
[1:24:53] reality to you he's more than just words

[1:25:01] your kids but he's a living reality
[1:25:03] whatever you have need of God will give
[1:25:06] it to you if you would ask this
[1:25:09] morning amen he's a living reality
[1:25:12] Hallelujah so the gospel consists more
[1:25:16] than just teaching the word for Paul
[1:25:17] says first Thessalonians 1 and verse 5
[1:25:21] for Our Gospel came not unto you in word
[1:25:24] only but also in power and in the Holy
[1:25:27] Ghost amen demonstrations of the Holy
[1:25:30] Spirit would come and demonstrate the
[1:25:32] gospel bringing the word to a living
[1:25:36] reality amen if you just receive the
[1:25:39] word by if you just receive the word by
[1:25:42] knowing the word that doesn't do any
[1:25:44] good the letter kth but the spirit
[1:25:47] giveth life see that's what we was
[1:25:49] talking about earlier we we've got
[1:25:50] people who can read the word and and who
[1:25:52] can read the Bible who can read the
[1:25:53] message you can quote quotes but without
[1:25:55] the life behind it without the spirit of
[1:25:58] the Lord behind
[1:26:00] it it won't do no good but then we must
[1:26:04] be born again and the Holy Spirit
[1:26:06] quickens the word to you in other words
[1:26:09] it's like a grain of corn that's laying
[1:26:11] in my hand it's just a grain of corn
[1:26:13] it'll never be anything else but you
[1:26:15] bury it it it comes contaminated molds
[1:26:18] and then it brings another grain of corn
[1:26:21] just like it amen you see it's good to
[1:26:25] read and talk about the Miracles in the
[1:26:27] Bible I'm not against that I love
[1:26:29] reading the Bible I love telling my
[1:26:30] children my my little almost
[1:26:32] two-year-old I love to tell I tell her
[1:26:34] every day you do know that I love you
[1:26:36] you do know that mama loves you and do
[1:26:38] you know that most of all Jesus loves
[1:26:40] you and and Mama would begin to tell her
[1:26:43] the stories of David tell her the
[1:26:45] stories of Jesus and tell her the
[1:26:47] stories of what what's going on and but
[1:26:51] see but see there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:52] telling the stories of Moses and David
[1:26:55] and it's good to know them it's good to
[1:26:56] teach your children those things and and
[1:26:59] it's good
[1:27:00] uh uh to to know that but see the
[1:27:03] Baptists do the same
[1:27:05] the the methodists do the same they
[1:27:07] teach their kids the Bible and the
[1:27:09] Church of God does the same they try to
[1:27:11] raise their kids in the right way as the
[1:27:13] best they can by the word but without
[1:27:15] the life behind it it becomes of no
[1:27:19] avail oh come on now and the church does
[1:27:23] the same amen but what what has happened
[1:27:25] is they haven't laid the seed in the
[1:27:28] ground they haven't laid that seed in
[1:27:31] the
[1:27:32] ground and they and but but what they
[1:27:34] have is they buried it in their
[1:27:36] Traditions they buried it in in their
[1:27:38] ideas and it's only produced a formal
[1:27:41] and dried up religion oh amen they've
[1:27:45] got so focused on the Easter Plays
[1:27:47] they've got so focused
[1:27:49] on on what Jesus did that they missed
[1:27:52] the everything he is doing in this day
[1:27:56] oh my and there are were people this
[1:27:57] morning that has hidden that word in
[1:28:00] their heart and it's not and is let the
[1:28:03] Holy Ghost come and Quicken that life
[1:28:05] that's in him amen I believe I'm
[1:28:08] preaching to a people that's that's hid
[1:28:10] that word down in their heart and
[1:28:12] they've let the Holy Ghost come in and
[1:28:14] and and it Sprout up the things of God
[1:28:18] and God is making himself known to you
[1:28:20] and he's ministering to you by the word
[1:28:23] oh my
[1:28:25] myall amen and when you can hide that
[1:28:27] word in your heart the next thing you
[1:28:29] know them old traditions just fall away
[1:28:31] the next thing you know the old man is
[1:28:33] buried it doesn't become a form of words
[1:28:37] or a decoration of so many words put
[1:28:39] together but it becomes a living reality
[1:28:41] that Jesus Christ is in us now and the
[1:28:44] Holy Spirit is moving back and forth
[1:28:47] through every human being amen surging
[1:28:50] through the hearts amen we've got to let
[1:28:53] our faith in God
[1:28:54] and bring the power of God to a living
[1:28:58] reality amen won't hold you too much
