[56:13] um see
[56:15] 34 and
[56:18] 7 and it says the angel of the Lord
[56:21] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[56:25] and delivereth them aren't you glad for
[56:27] that amen then if you'll turn to the
[56:31] Book of Psalms
[56:43] 104 Book of
[56:45] Psalms 104 and we're going to start at
[56:49] the first
[56:50] verse blessed be the Lord oh my
[56:54] soul oh Lord my my God Thou Art very
[56:58] great thou art clothed with honor and
[57:01] Majesty who coverest thyself with light
[57:04] as with a garment who stretcheth out the
[57:08] heavens like a curtain who layeth the
[57:11] beams of his Chambers in the water who
[57:15] maketh the clouds his Chariot who
[57:18] walketh upon the wings of the wind who
[57:21] maketh his angels Spirits his ministers
[57:25] a fles flaming
[57:28] fire one more if you'll turn to first
[57:31] Thessalonians the 2
[57:37] chapter amen first Thessalonians the 2
[57:42] chapter and we'll just
[57:46] um read the 13th
[57:53] verse it says for this call also we
[57:57] thank god without
[57:58] ceasing because when you receive the
[58:01] word of God which you heard of us you
[58:04] received it not as the word of men but
[58:07] as it is in truth the word of God which
[58:11] effectively worketh also in you that
[58:16] belief amen you can have your seats this
[58:23] morning I'm going to use the title
[58:27] angels of God are encamped around
[58:31] us and as we read there that um the
[58:37] angels are ministering
[58:40] spirits and um there's a lot that has
[58:43] been said about angels we've talked
[58:45] about it many times and um and I I I
[58:51] don't think you could really exhaust the
[58:53] subject of of angel of course Angels
[58:57] live in the Unseen
[59:01] Rim uh so they are not seen by most
[59:05] people um of course uh few of the Saints
[59:09] in the Bible have been visited by angels
[59:13] and have seen them uh but not all and
[59:16] there are
[59:18] some uh still today uh some that have
[59:22] seen angels have had visitations of of
[59:26] course our the prophet talked about it
[59:29] uh having uh visitation of angels uh it
[59:35] it seemed like on a daily basis uh there
[59:40] but um we we know that that uh uh even
[59:44] though we can't see them but they are
[59:47] real and of course there's a lot of
[59:49] discussion about angels whether they are
[59:52] real or whether they're not but uh even
[59:55] you know there they're UN in this Unseen
[59:57] World and and we know that there is an
[1:00:00] unseen uh we you know the prophet talked
[1:00:03] about television and how that uh
[1:00:07] television has been able to prove a man
[1:00:11] by television has proven that there is
[1:00:15] an Unseen World and that it is a
[1:00:19] reality and he talked about that there
[1:00:21] are you know people passing through this
[1:00:24] room even now and that voices of of men
[1:00:28] and women that have uh lived ages past
[1:00:33] that they're still in the room and um
[1:00:37] and so our our natural senses can't pick
[1:00:40] these things up because it's in another
[1:00:44] dimension and the prophet talked on
[1:00:46] dimensions and and uh and and so we know
[1:00:50] this there but but he he would tell us
[1:00:53] that television it's it is is n
[1:00:56] manufacturing the pictures it's it's
[1:00:59] only a channel uh that picks up the
[1:01:03] Unseen and makes it visible to to us and
[1:01:08] and so uh you know brother brandom in
[1:01:11] taking that he said you can't move your
[1:01:13] you can't move or bad an eye uh but what
[1:01:17] it is uh being recorded forever it's um
[1:01:23] every move that you make and and even
[1:01:25] down to your thoughts and your voice and
[1:01:28] and all of these things and uh it's it's
[1:01:32] forever uh recorded it's it's there and
[1:01:36] so you know he said you know take a man
[1:01:39] in Australia or Switzerland Africa or
[1:01:41] wherever it may be around the world and
[1:01:44] and you know uh and what he does what he
[1:01:48] says and and every movement and and what
[1:01:52] He even wears can be projected by
[1:01:55] television
[1:01:56] it it is something there and so uh it's
[1:01:59] somehow that television can channel uh
[1:02:03] uh through this uh and and and make the
[1:02:06] Unseen a reality to you and I of course
[1:02:10] we've moved on from from television to
[1:02:13] internet and and these things like that
[1:02:16] but uh you know when when Adam was here
[1:02:18] television was here when when you know
[1:02:21] Noah and all the way down it it it the
[1:02:24] television was was was there all all
[1:02:28] along and and so so it will never die
[1:02:32] what what we what we do say and and all
[1:02:34] these things it'll never die and brother
[1:02:36] Brown said it's in the other waves of
[1:02:39] the air and it's still alive and so you
[1:02:43] know a lot of people think that they
[1:02:44] will escape judgment that there's no
[1:02:46] such thing as judgment or that they can
[1:02:48] hide things but yet it will all be
[1:02:51] played out be be of of what we've done
[1:02:54] in this life everything will be played
[1:02:56] out and and and so uh but but he made
[1:03:00] the point that that as it is with
[1:03:03] Humanity uh uh so is God and His angels
[1:03:08] here in this building as well and uh uh
[1:03:12] they're here but we cannot see him we
[1:03:15] cannot hear him or you know uh uh but
[1:03:19] yet they're here and they are
[1:03:21] supernatural
[1:03:23] beings uh uh that are are unseen To Us
[1:03:28] by our natural sight and so you know uh
[1:03:32] uh it would take a certain tube or
[1:03:35] Crystal of of something to pick up that
[1:03:38] voice and I I believe that if we had the
[1:03:41] right voice and the right channel the
[1:03:44] right instrument we could pick up all
[1:03:46] the way back in the Garden of Eden and
[1:03:50] and hear a conversation that went on and
[1:03:53] and know what was happening in that time
[1:03:57] uh but but it takes the channel and of
[1:04:00] course we know that God had a prophet to
[1:04:03] pick that up and and tell us exactly
[1:04:06] what happened and and these things and
[1:04:09] he could see that he in one place said
[1:04:12] I'm looking through a window we're
[1:04:13] looking through this window you know and
[1:04:15] he tells us that he could see the the
[1:04:18] the the skin flapping on the back of
[1:04:21] their legs as they were running through
[1:04:23] the garden of bloody skins and and all
[1:04:26] of these things but but it would take a
[1:04:29] it takes something Amen to pick up uh uh
[1:04:33] these these this Unseen World and
[1:04:36] brother brandham he says but someday
[1:04:39] it'll be reality just as television is
[1:04:42] now and just as common amen just as
[1:04:46] common and so uh uh you know as I
[1:04:50] realize that there are people who don't
[1:04:52] believe in angels and they a lot of
[1:04:55] don't even believe in God anymore but um
[1:04:58] but they are in in important to us and
[1:05:02] and I I think that uh uh uh we should
[1:05:06] consider this and and uh because they
[1:05:10] are still in my belief and what I see
[1:05:13] what a prophet taught that they're still
[1:05:15] being used to minister to the church
[1:05:18] today amen and so you know but people
[1:05:22] seem uh uh to have this notion that God
[1:05:25] God isn't doing what he used to do and
[1:05:29] they want to change God they want to
[1:05:31] change his ways and and and uh so what
[1:05:35] he used to do in the Old Testament they
[1:05:37] say he doesn't do now in the New
[1:05:40] Testament and a lot of them use the
[1:05:42] argument that prophets were used in the
[1:05:44] Old Testament but but not in the New
[1:05:46] Testament and Angels were used in the
[1:05:49] Old Testament but they're not needed in
[1:05:51] the in the New Testament and uh one
[1:05:54] man's explanation for not believing in
[1:05:57] angels was that God doesn't use angels
[1:06:00] to direct his church anymore it's it's
[1:06:02] the holy spirit that that that directs
[1:06:06] uh the church now and he he of course he
[1:06:09] could he could agree with that that
[1:06:12] Daniel had an angel uh and and and Noah
[1:06:15] had an angel and and Moses and Abraham
[1:06:20] and Joshua and all them you know the
[1:06:22] Angels appeared to them but uh uh but
[1:06:26] but as far as he was concerned that only
[1:06:28] applied to the the Old Testament and so
[1:06:32] he he he says that when we're when we're
[1:06:34] talking of angels today then we're
[1:06:37] mixing uh uh the Old Testament and the
[1:06:39] New Testament together and and we're out
[1:06:42] of place and all that but you know the
[1:06:45] the Bible says that the Old Testament is
[1:06:47] only a shadow of the new amen and and so
[1:06:51] brother bradam says both the Old and the
[1:06:53] new together confirms God's attitude
[1:06:56] towards the people aren't you glad for
[1:06:58] that that God's attitude Remains the
[1:07:01] Same all the way through the old and the
[1:07:04] New Testament and we can see a a picture
[1:07:07] of what God is is after and wanting for
[1:07:12] for his people and so of course you know
[1:07:15] there are people that don't believe in
[1:07:17] such a thing as Miracles or or prophets
[1:07:20] and you know talking to a a gentleman a
[1:07:23] couple years ago and tell me that the
[1:07:26] the apostolic age has ceased and uh
[1:07:29] there's no more healing no more miracles
[1:07:32] no more you know uh uh the nine
[1:07:35] spiritual gifts are no longer in
[1:07:37] operation and and all these things but
[1:07:40] you know I've I've thought of of times
[1:07:42] they they they arrive to this conclusion
[1:07:45] is is perhaps they have seen too much or
[1:07:48] so much
[1:07:50] impersonation of of people trying to do
[1:07:53] it trying to manufacture something that
[1:07:57] that and and it just it just makes it
[1:07:59] look like the gospel's got a flaw in it
[1:08:02] and and all of these things and and so
[1:08:05] there there's been so much inaccuracy
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:09] misinformation in the real of gifts till
[1:08:12] people don't believe in gifts anymore
[1:08:15] there there's been uh many claiming to
[1:08:17] be a prophet and have have made a a a a
[1:08:22] a shame of it or whatever you'd want to
[1:08:24] call it
[1:08:26] when the true God Vindicated Prophet
[1:08:28] comes on the scene the people refuse to
[1:08:30] believe it and just say well it's just
[1:08:32] another another one of them you know and
[1:08:35] and so uh uh men men and women have
[1:08:37] claimed to have visitation of angels and
[1:08:41] you know and and yet it it it's so
[1:08:44] farfetched that that people just don't
[1:08:47] believe them anymore and it's it's
[1:08:49] brought a real mockery to the real thing
[1:08:53] and so but you know the prophet would
[1:08:55] tell us and and it lines up with the
[1:08:57] Bible that if an angel does come and he
[1:09:00] would come according to the scriptures
[1:09:03] and and if he does not work with the
[1:09:06] scriptures then it's it's of the devil
[1:09:08] ain't that right amen and so that but
[1:09:11] that goes for anything if a prophet
[1:09:13] arises on the scene or a dream is given
[1:09:16] or a prophecy is given a preacher
[1:09:19] tongues interpretation of tongu if if it
[1:09:22] doesn't work according to the scriptures
[1:09:24] then it it it's it's inspired of the
[1:09:27] devil it's it's it comes from uh the
[1:09:30] flesh amen and and so this is where Paul
[1:09:34] would tell us in in 2 Corinthians 11
[1:09:38] and13 for such are false Apostles
[1:09:42] deceitful workers
[1:09:44] transforming themselves into the
[1:09:46] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[1:09:49] Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:09:53] angel of Light therefore it is no great
[1:09:55] thing if his ministers also be
[1:09:57] transformed as the Ministers of
[1:10:00] righteousness whose end shall be
[1:10:03] according to their Works ain't that
[1:10:05] right so so we already know that these
[1:10:07] things are going to be but if there's if
[1:10:10] there's a a fake then then there's
[1:10:13] always got to be a true real real thing
[1:10:17] or there would be no fake if there's a
[1:10:19] false then there's there's the real and
[1:10:21] so brother Brams is a a real true angel
[1:10:25] will come and vindicate this scripture
[1:10:28] to the dot if if any any visitation that
[1:10:32] a man would have of angels it will
[1:10:35] always vindicate the Scripture it takes
[1:10:37] you back to scripture and and and and
[1:10:40] this is exactly what the angel did to
[1:10:43] Joseph in in there when he was troubled
[1:10:45] about Mary and her testimony and all
[1:10:48] these things the angel that appeared to
[1:10:50] him in the dream took him to scriptures
[1:10:53] and compared it that when when Joseph
[1:10:56] woke up he knew he had a Divine answer
[1:11:00] to to what Mary was saying it it
[1:11:02] confirmed her testimony ain't that right
[1:11:06] and and so a a a real true Prophet will
[1:11:09] stay with the word and will not
[1:11:11] compromise and of course I I believe
[1:11:14] that brother brandham I think all of us
[1:11:16] here believe that brother brandham was a
[1:11:18] true Vindicated prophet of the Lord and
[1:11:21] and was supernaturally Vindicated by God
[1:11:24] and and so this is why we must stay
[1:11:27] within the the bounds of what he has
[1:11:29] taught and he never taught us to do away
[1:11:33] with the fivefold ministry and and just
[1:11:35] press play uh he he never he never
[1:11:39] taught against the moving of the Spirit
[1:11:42] uh uh in in amongst the people he never
[1:11:45] did away with the gifts of the Spirit
[1:11:48] amen that Paul had put in the church and
[1:11:51] he never taught that it was okay to stay
[1:11:54] a home and and and and uh uh listen to
[1:11:59] tapes or uh uh live stream and and all
[1:12:03] that and stay away from church and these
[1:12:05] things he he never taught that we
[1:12:08] understand that the you know we we do uh
[1:12:10] uh uh encourage and uh I know in my home
[1:12:14] we play tapes uh at the home but but we
[1:12:17] go to the house of God and and we
[1:12:19] believe in a fightful Ministry we you
[1:12:22] know uh uh we we understand that we do
[1:12:24] have life dream uh there's some that get
[1:12:27] sick and they're not able to come to
[1:12:28] church or uh or things that that happen
[1:12:31] and and so we have that but but it's not
[1:12:34] the excuse for people to stay home uh
[1:12:37] because God sent us a message and and
[1:12:40] the message is is in Vindicated of God
[1:12:44] so brother Brandon he would tell us just
[1:12:46] for the uh just for I just read it he
[1:12:49] said you got tapes on discipline in the
[1:12:51] church how we behave ourselves in the
[1:12:53] Church of God and how we ought got to
[1:12:56] come together sit together in Heavenly
[1:12:59] places aren't you glad for that sit
[1:13:01] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[1:13:04] home ain't that right so so brother
[1:13:07] Brandon clearly puts a distinction
[1:13:09] between home and church ain't that right
[1:13:12] some people that you know they say well
[1:13:14] I I've got my church right here it's
[1:13:15] home you know yeah right you know
[1:13:18] brother Brandon says don't stay home go
[1:13:20] to church ain't that right and so he
[1:13:23] said if God is in your heart you can't
[1:13:25] hardly wait for them doors open and
[1:13:27] that's not your living room door or your
[1:13:29] bedroom door that's the church doors
[1:13:32] amen you can't hardly wait for them
[1:13:35] doors to open out yonder out yonder see
[1:13:38] to get here in fellowship with your
[1:13:40] brothers if you don't feel that way then
[1:13:42] I tell you it's time you got to pray in
[1:13:44] ain't that right so then anything that
[1:13:47] is sent of God and from God will not
[1:13:50] stray from the word and and and I I
[1:13:54] think that is so important it it you
[1:13:56] know Pentecostal should have understood
[1:13:58] that ain't that right that they lean to
[1:14:01] the sensations and they lean to the
[1:14:03] emotions and they lean all of these
[1:14:05] things and and then we find that they're
[1:14:08] uh uh calling things Angels they're
[1:14:11] calling things of God that really really
[1:14:15] isn't of God and and these things and
[1:14:18] I'm talking about an angel of the Lord
[1:14:21] amen and so uh uh uh any man uh that is
[1:14:25] of god he's going to believe in angels
[1:14:28] uh that's just a given uh because the
[1:14:31] Bible promised that they would be with
[1:14:33] us ain't that right I've got a lot of
[1:14:35] quotes and things and I hope it'll be
[1:14:37] helpful but brother randam says Angelic
[1:14:40] beings associate together they associate
[1:14:45] together so he said if you've got the
[1:14:47] holy spirit in you then you're a
[1:14:50] candidate for
[1:14:52] association with the Unseen World now
[1:14:55] think of that you are a candidate for
[1:14:59] the association with the Unseen World
[1:15:02] and the
[1:15:03] supernatural amen aren't you glad for
[1:15:06] the Holy Ghost amen that would come and
[1:15:09] live inside of you that that would tune
[1:15:12] you in to an Unseen World and let you
[1:15:15] know there is an unseen and there is a
[1:15:18] reality too it how else would we know
[1:15:21] that there's a heaven and how do how
[1:15:23] else would we really know if if there's
[1:15:25] an eternal City how else would we really
[1:15:27] know if there's a theophany waiting for
[1:15:29] us how would we know these things and
[1:15:32] expect them things looking for to them
[1:15:35] things if there isn't something speaking
[1:15:37] of it in our hearts ain't that right so
[1:15:41] later on he says in this in that same
[1:15:43] sermon he says when the Holy Spirit
[1:15:45] comes into the heart quickly that man
[1:15:49] becomes a two-fold being one of the
[1:15:53] earth to die one of Heaven to live Amen
[1:15:56] in his body he's still subject to death
[1:15:59] but in his soul he's passed from Death
[1:16:02] un life in his body he has Earthly
[1:16:06] contact with his five senses in his
[1:16:09] Spirit he has contact with God through
[1:16:11] the Holy Ghost and the angels of God
[1:16:15] visits them speaks with them and they
[1:16:19] are messengers sent from God to reveal
[1:16:22] and to bring messages from God to the
[1:16:26] individual now I I you know I I I when
[1:16:31] you know looking at these things I think
[1:16:33] we're blessed Amen to be able to have an
[1:16:38] acquaintance with angels I I I really do
[1:16:42] and and and maybe hopefully we can uh uh
[1:16:45] uh bring that make that clear but see if
[1:16:48] if if um you know brother brandham he
[1:16:51] said if if if a person does not believe
[1:16:54] that angels are ministering Spirit sent
[1:16:57] from the presence of God then he just
[1:16:59] doesn't know his Bible so I want to look
[1:17:02] at a scripture uh there in Genesis
[1:17:06] 28:10 uh where it speaks of uh Jacob's
[1:17:10] lad and and uh here it says and Jacob
[1:17:14] went out from beerseba and went toward
[1:17:18] Heron and he lighted upon a certain
[1:17:21] place and carried there all night
[1:17:23] because the sun was set
[1:17:25] and he took of the stones of that place
[1:17:27] and put them for his pillars and laid
[1:17:30] down in that place to sleep and he
[1:17:33] dreamed and behold a ladder set on up on
[1:17:36] the earth and the top of it reached the
[1:17:39] heaven and behold the angels of God
[1:17:43] ascending and descending on it see so so
[1:17:47] the the the the latter was on Earth the
[1:17:50] one end and the other was in heaven and
[1:17:53] in between there's angels of of God that
[1:17:56] is ascending and descending now what
[1:17:59] does this represent it was it
[1:18:02] represented that God was providing God
[1:18:05] showing us that he would provide a way
[1:18:09] of Escape aren't you glad for that amen
[1:18:13] God I I mean any everything that God
[1:18:15] does in in the scriptures do you realize
[1:18:19] it's for us it's it's for his people you
[1:18:23] know brother Bram said it's a love
[1:18:24] letter to to the bride of Christ and and
[1:18:28] and maybe we didn't understand the
[1:18:29] Parables we didn't understand the things
[1:18:31] that that were written that God would
[1:18:34] send a prophet in this day to reveal the
[1:18:37] heart of God to us and that we could
[1:18:39] have a better understanding of what this
[1:18:41] bible really means and how that we can
[1:18:44] take it as a personal consolation amen
[1:18:48] that if we're part of the church God's
[1:18:50] Got Us taken care of amen and this is
[1:18:53] what it was this this lad it was showing
[1:18:56] that God would provide a way of Escape
[1:18:59] you see the lad is symbolic of the
[1:19:02] church amen rising from Earth to glory
[1:19:06] amen God taking us amen we born as
[1:19:09] Sinners born as as as nobodies we were
[1:19:12] losers we brother Bram even talked you
[1:19:15] know and faith is Victory I think he
[1:19:16] said we were born defeated and and all
[1:19:19] these things but but that's not our end
[1:19:22] that that's that's not our hope Paul
[1:19:25] would say if I had hope in this life
[1:19:27] only I'd be of all men most miserable we
[1:19:30] would all be that way amen but in this
[1:19:34] dark hour in this in this time of
[1:19:37] trouble in this time of tribulation
[1:19:40] coming upon the the world we've got a
[1:19:43] hope and God would show it in the
[1:19:45] scriptures that he would take us from
[1:19:48] Earth to glory amen our journey that's a
[1:19:51] journey it's not from church to church
[1:19:54] from to Doctrine it's from Earth to
[1:19:56] Glory it's as the as we were the Sands
[1:20:00] of the sea amen and now we're becoming
[1:20:02] the stars of the heavens amen coming
[1:20:05] from Earthly to Heavenly ain't that
[1:20:08] right see we're climbing upwards and and
[1:20:11] brother Bram said one thing about it is
[1:20:12] this ladder is not a two-way there's
[1:20:14] only one way and that's that's up ain't
[1:20:18] that right amen you can't be saved today
[1:20:20] and lost tomorrow amen you can't go up
[1:20:23] five rings and and fall off amen it's
[1:20:26] one way and that's where you're at ain't
[1:20:29] that right we're moving up and so we we
[1:20:31] find that we don't have to stay in the
[1:20:34] muck and the Meer for God has provided a
[1:20:38] way for us to leave this Earthbound rim
[1:20:42] and come into the heavenlies amen the
[1:20:46] atmospheres and aren't you glad for that
[1:20:49] amen things the prophet said that has
[1:20:51] has kept us out of fellowship with God
[1:20:55] God would provided a way that we could
[1:20:58] come up higher and come into that Rim
[1:21:01] when we didn't know what God was and we
[1:21:04] didn't know who God was we didn't have
[1:21:06] an experience with God Amen maybe some
[1:21:08] of us went through just the religious
[1:21:10] act and yet without having a real
[1:21:13] experience with God then we found that
[1:21:16] ladder and and and we started climbing
[1:21:19] the ladder and God becomes more real to
[1:21:22] us and the things of God become more of
[1:21:25] reality to us than than he was back in
[1:21:29] the day can you say Amen but you see
[1:21:32] that the Church of God is
[1:21:34] predestinated it's a predestinated
[1:21:36] church now notice we're predestinated to
[1:21:39] be without spot wrinkle or blemish amen
[1:21:42] we're predestinated to be conformed to
[1:21:44] the image of his dear son we're
[1:21:47] predestinated Amen to the adoption of
[1:21:49] sons do you believe that this church is
[1:21:52] predestinated
[1:21:54] men to live in that Eternal City and
[1:21:57] only that predestinated people will live
[1:21:59] in that City Amen predestinated to rule
[1:22:03] and to reign with him amen see we were
[1:22:06] predestinated to go from sinner Amen to
[1:22:09] a saint Amen to go from a a vagabond to
[1:22:13] a Son of God Amen to go from manifest uh
[1:22:17] manifesting this worldly things to
[1:22:20] manifesting the things of God Amen we
[1:22:23] were predestinated
[1:22:25] for that amen God didn't save us just to
[1:22:27] remain church members and dry and dead
[1:22:31] and and struggling and no hope no faith
[1:22:34] no joy you you understand what I'm
[1:22:36] saying sure we have our battles and sure
[1:22:38] that he also predestinated us Amen to
[1:22:42] overcome amen there's just something
[1:22:44] about God and so it he he predestinated
[1:22:48] it and and and so if he predestinated it
[1:22:51] he had to provide that way for us to be
[1:22:55] transformed amen so he provided this
[1:22:57] ladder if you could say it in Jacob's
[1:23:00] Dream It's a ladder Amen to where we
[1:23:02] could start climbing and and day by day
[1:23:05] we're CH being changed and word by word
[1:23:08] and everything we're believing of the of
[1:23:10] the Gospel it is CH transforming us amen
[1:23:15] and that word transform is to change
[1:23:17] from one thing to another can you say
[1:23:19] amen amen you see when God called us out
[1:23:22] of Babylon he didn't call us from one
[1:23:25] Church to another church from one
[1:23:27] Doctrine to another Doctrine from one
[1:23:29] denomination to another denomination he
[1:23:32] didn't call us just to reform us can you
[1:23:35] say Amen to where we just switch a
[1:23:37] church titles and and and go from
[1:23:40] Baptist to Pentecostal or Pentecostal to
[1:23:42] Catholic or whatever amen but he called
[1:23:45] us that we might be
[1:23:47] transformed called us out of babbling
[1:23:50] called us out of the sin called us out
[1:23:52] of the confusion called us from the
[1:23:54] powers of Darkness that we could be
[1:23:56] liberated and experience the Heavenly
[1:24:00] things can you say Amen things that the
[1:24:03] carnal man will never know nothing of
[1:24:05] the average man will never know nothing
[1:24:07] of that God called you to experience the
[1:24:11] Unseen yes sir amen so all these things
[1:24:15] are Earthbound but God has called us
[1:24:17] from Earth to Glory so God need us to
[1:24:21] needed to establish his ladder on the
[1:24:24] Earth he already had it hooked on in
[1:24:27] heaven on the throne of God but he
[1:24:29] needed it to be hooked to assure
[1:24:32] foundation on Earth amen so brother Bram
[1:24:35] would tell us he tried to hook it up uh
[1:24:37] hook it on the upon the Jewish Nation
[1:24:39] but it didn't work he couldn't hook it
[1:24:41] up on Jacob amen the sub planter he
[1:24:43] couldn't hook it up on on on Abraham he
[1:24:46] was he lied and treated the wife his
[1:24:49] wife the way he treated her and and all
[1:24:51] these things he couldn't hook it up on
[1:24:53] David the ad Al and and all of these
[1:24:56] things but but then in the Old Testament
[1:24:58] I believe it was that a prophet would
[1:25:00] rise up and he saw a stone and and he
[1:25:04] said a stone would come it would be a
[1:25:06] precious stone a a Cornerstone and and
[1:25:10] these things a tried Stone ain't that
[1:25:12] right well we know that stone to be it
[1:25:15] was the Cornerstone which was Jesus
[1:25:17] Christ and as God predestinated a church
[1:25:21] he predestinated that stone Amen to be
[1:25:24] that sure Foundation aren't you glad for
[1:25:27] that amen you're predestinated brother
[1:25:29] Bill Jesus Christ was predestinated and
[1:25:32] Jesus Christ cannot
[1:25:35] fail do you believe that cannot fail now
[1:25:39] see and so now notice that Cornerstone
[1:25:42] that stone that he God would set that
[1:25:44] ladder upon for his church amen would be
[1:25:48] Jesus Christ amen see you you ain't
[1:25:51] going you ain't going to heaven on on
[1:25:53] any denomination
[1:25:54] you you ain't going to he he couldn't
[1:25:56] set that letter on anybody else amen it
[1:25:59] wouldn't get us to glory amen but he
[1:26:01] could set it Upon Jesus Christ amen and
[1:26:04] and and that power of Jesus Christ would
[1:26:07] raise us up amen into everything that
[1:26:10] God has predestinated us to be amen so
[1:26:14] now notice what Jesus said in John 1:51
[1:26:17] verily verily I say unto you Hereafter
[1:26:20] you shall see Heaven open and the angels
[1:26:23] of God us ascending and descending where
[1:26:26] upon the Baptist Church Upon a
[1:26:27] Pentecostal Church Upon Shawn Martin
[1:26:30] upon upon Faith Tabernacle no upon the
[1:26:33] son of man can you say amen that's where
[1:26:36] the rock was amen that Angels would be
[1:26:39] Ascend and descend amen upon the son of
[1:26:43] man so see the prophet said see that
[1:26:46] latter it's hooked to the throne of God
[1:26:48] and to the Heart of Jesus Christ and
[1:26:51] we're in between it see what we're doing
[1:26:54] we're climbing up we're moving up ain't
[1:26:56] that right he said see God doesn't want
[1:26:59] his ladder slipping around he tried to
[1:27:01] hook it with the Covenant with Adam he
[1:27:03] broke it he hooked it to a covenant and
[1:27:06] with uh and it says and he broke it any
[1:27:08] time that God made a covenant with man
[1:27:10] man always broke it but then God would
[1:27:13] make an unconditional Covenant with
[1:27:16] himself ain't that right see and and he
[1:27:20] says he hooked it in Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:23] and what was Jesus Christ he was God
[1:27:25] made flesh so God become the
[1:27:29] stone Amen to hook this lad too he said
[1:27:32] there it's anchored there's no slipping
[1:27:34] and sliding there's no way of getting
[1:27:36] away what is it it's hooked by God above
[1:27:39] and by the Son of God beneath and what
[1:27:41] is it it's a pathway everybody say it's
[1:27:44] a pathway it's a traveler's way from
[1:27:47] Earth to glory and you cannot
[1:27:51] fail can you say Amen how did you get on
[1:27:54] the ladder God ordained you to that
[1:27:56] ladder amen he he knows what he's doing
[1:27:58] with your life and you cannot fail he's
[1:28:02] already made a weight you ain't going to
[1:28:04] fall well aren't you glad for that amen
[1:28:07] we we cannot worry about well am I going
[1:28:09] to make it or am I not I like what
[1:28:11] brother Andrew said one time in well
[1:28:13] there in Arkansas he said you know I
[1:28:14] don't study much about hell because I
[1:28:16] know I'm not going to hell amen I want
[1:28:18] to study about where I'm going a ain't
[1:28:21] that right I'm not going to study about
[1:28:22] the negative I don't want to dwell on
[1:28:23] the negative I I I I that's fine about
[1:28:26] politics and all that but that's not
[1:28:28] where my mind is that's not where my
[1:28:30] heart is I'm not interested in what
[1:28:31] they're doing I'm interested in what God
[1:28:34] is doing in my life and where I'm
[1:28:37] going well amen I trust you're that way
[1:28:41] too see you can't fail politics Will
[1:28:44] Fail and you'll fail with it if you're
[1:28:46] hooked to that you're going to fall if
[1:28:48] you're hooked up to yourself you're
[1:28:50] going to fall if you're hooked up to a
[1:28:52] minister you're going to fall if you're
[1:28:54] hooked up to a church you're going to
[1:28:56] fall if you're even hooked up to your
[1:28:58] Doctrine you're going to fall but if
[1:29:00] you're ever hooked up to Jesus Christ
[1:29:02] you cannot fail that you cannot fail can
[1:29:06] you say amen and to think of it that God
[1:29:09] didn't choose a perfect church but he
[1:29:12] chose a blood that would perfect that
[1:29:15] church to where they can never
[1:29:18] fall can never fall he said see we're
[1:29:21] caught between it see with the great
[1:29:24] host of angels bringing forth
[1:29:27] ministering Spirits Supernatural gifts
[1:29:30] and things vindicating we're on our road
[1:29:34] aren't you glad for that God gives us
[1:29:36] angels all around us vindicating that
[1:29:39] we're on our road amen that's why we
[1:29:42] don't believe in a dead dry religion
[1:29:44] amen that's why you cannot get to the
[1:29:47] place that you don't believe in the
[1:29:49] Supernatural can you say amen God sends
[1:29:52] ministering Spirits angels a great host
[1:29:54] of angels Supernatural gifts and things
[1:29:57] vindicating we're on our road we're
[1:30:00] marching
[1:30:03] up another place he said look there's
[1:30:05] great companies of angels up and down
[1:30:07] here ascending and descending notice
[1:30:09] what they're doing picking up the
[1:30:12] weary how many's ever been weary in the
[1:30:15] journey amen oh man you're just seem
[1:30:18] like you're just hanging on by by your
[1:30:20] pinky and yet there's angels that are
[1:30:23] picking you up they're holding you why
[1:30:27] God predestinated you to this journey
[1:30:30] aren't you glad for that picking up the
[1:30:32] weary and sick healing their bodies
[1:30:35] showing visions and mighty signs and
[1:30:37] wonders notice you can't fail it can't
[1:30:41] slip it can't slide you're
[1:30:46] safe God said so that settles it every
[1:30:50] time I read that you're safe it reminds

[1:36:23] see so the Angels were all around to

[1:36:27] Christian Life is a
[1:36:29] miracle you are a miracle the fact that
[1:36:32] you can believe in this unbelieving
[1:36:34] world you it's a miracle the fact that
[1:36:37] you can get up and go to church amen
[1:36:39] when the church doors are open that's a
[1:36:40] miracle the fact that you can believe in
[1:36:43] miracles when everybody's saying there
[1:36:44] ain't no Miracle that's a miracle the
[1:36:47] fact that you can still lift up your
[1:36:49] hands in the darkest of hours of your
[1:36:51] life that's a miracle
[1:36:54] can you say Amen people that don't
[1:36:55] believe in miracles they ought to look
[1:36:57] at
[1:36:57] us amen and if they' look at us and not
[1:37:01] criticize our you know the the hinder
[1:37:04] parts and look at the the miracle of
[1:37:08] God yes sir Moses you know Israel had
[1:37:12] their hinder Parts just as much and
[1:37:14] that's all balam could
[1:37:15] see but the miracle of it he failed to
[1:37:19] see the
[1:37:20] miracle was there was a mercy seat there
[1:37:23] there was the pillar of fire in their
[1:37:25] midst there were Angels around
[1:37:31] them that's a
[1:37:33] miracle it's a miracle that we can still
[1:37:36] have faith in all of our faults and
[1:37:38] failures it's a
[1:37:40] miracle that we can lift up holy hands
[1:37:43] without wrath and without
[1:37:45] doubting it's a
[1:37:48] miracle you believe
[1:37:50] that now the New Testament Church they
[1:37:55] they saw more Angels than did the Old
[1:37:58] Testament Church and scriptures give an
[1:38:00] account of angels appearing nuber times
[1:38:03] to the early church if you just look in
[1:38:05] the New Testament and you'll see that uh
[1:38:08] you know Luke the first chapter the
[1:38:10] angel of the Lord appeared to Zacharias
[1:38:12] telling him that the Lord had heard his
[1:38:15] prayer and and that he and his wife
[1:38:18] Elizabeth was going to have have a baby
[1:38:21] 6 months later amen
[1:38:24] the angel of the Lord appeared to Mary
[1:38:27] and told her that she was highly favored
[1:38:29] of God and told her that the Holy Ghost
[1:38:32] would overshadow her and that she would
[1:38:34] conceive of a child and and and these
[1:38:37] things in Matthew 2 and 13 the angel of
[1:38:41] the Lord appeared to Joseph the second
[1:38:43] time and told him to flee to Egypt and
[1:38:47] uh uh with with the young child and his
[1:38:50] mother of course we talked about Joseph
[1:38:52] you know having that dream the angel of
[1:38:54] the Lord appearing to Joseph in the
[1:38:56] dream and confirming what you know what
[1:38:58] what Mary was saying was right along
[1:39:01] with the scriptures and things like that
[1:39:03] Luke the 2 chapter talks about the
[1:39:06] Angels appearing to the the three
[1:39:09] Shepherds I I think it was three
[1:39:10] Shepherds or two the Shepherds anyways
[1:39:12] and and announcing to them the the birth
[1:39:15] of Christ and and and there you know uh
[1:39:19] uh an angel of the Lord and the Bible
[1:39:21] says that with him a appeared a host of
[1:39:24] angels a multitude and they were singing
[1:39:27] hosana a glory to God in the highest and
[1:39:31] uh on Earth peace Good Will toward men
[1:39:34] ain't that right see it was in Luke
[1:39:36] 22:43 tells us uh that an angel appeared
[1:39:40] to Jesus when he was in The Garden of
[1:39:42] Gethsemane and and there he was uh uh
[1:39:47] facing death and the worst death that a
[1:39:49] man could ever uh uh uh face and and yet
[1:39:52] the angel of the Lord come down and
[1:39:55] appear to him giving him strength for
[1:39:58] for this time and Jesus in his flesh he
[1:40:01] was weary and he was saying oh if it's
[1:40:03] possible let let this cup pass from me
[1:40:06] and and and you talk about a burden
[1:40:08] there amen and and the angel of the Lord
[1:40:11] come to give him strength yes sir see
[1:40:14] amen it was the angel of the Lord that
[1:40:16] opened the prison doors amen for the
[1:40:19] apostles uh the angel of the Lord
[1:40:22] appeared to Phillip and the Evangelist
[1:40:24] and told him where to go and what to do
[1:40:27] and and and uh the angel of the Lord
[1:40:30] appeared to Cornelius I believe and told
[1:40:32] him where to find Peter and and and and
[1:40:36] then Peter being he he didn't think the
[1:40:38] Gentiles uh you know uh he wasn't he
[1:40:41] wasn't ready to to preach the gospel to
[1:40:43] Gentiles you know uh uh and and it was
[1:40:46] the angel of the Lord that appeared to
[1:40:48] Peter there he was in a dream and and he
[1:40:51] and he saw all this you know vile uh
[1:40:55] animals and all of that and the angel
[1:40:57] says eat and he said I ain't there
[1:41:00] touching that stuff he you know it's
[1:41:01] unclean he said well how you know don't
[1:41:03] call what I've called clean unclean you
[1:41:06] know and and anyway but it was the angel
[1:41:08] of the Lord that told him to go with the
[1:41:11] Gentile men that corn Cornelius sent and
[1:41:15] and and to preach the gospel see so it
[1:41:18] it wasn't the Holy Ghost as some people
[1:41:21] would say leading the church Church aen
[1:41:24] uh leading them or appearing to the
[1:41:26] Saints it was the angel of the Lord
[1:41:29] Peter Paul Phillip and and and and many
[1:41:32] of them had the they had the Holy Ghost
[1:41:35] and yet the angel of the Lord would
[1:41:38] appear to them giving them Direction on
[1:41:41] what to do what to say and where to go
[1:41:45] and and all of these things well see
[1:41:47] that was part of the apostolic age do
[1:41:51] you believe that see so now if we're no
[1:41:54] longer a part of that Apostolic age then
[1:41:58] we have no right to expect angels to
[1:42:01] appear among us we we have no right to
[1:42:05] expect amen angels to deal with us and
[1:42:08] to encourage us and then you can say
[1:42:11] well it was just your emotions it's just
[1:42:12] your feelings it was just whatever you
[1:42:15] just thought that and you just you know
[1:42:17] all that you know the prophet said
[1:42:18] you're bumping into angels
[1:42:23] did he not say that you bump into
[1:42:27] Angels when there's something that
[1:42:29] quickens you there's something there
[1:42:31] that moves on you there's an angel you
[1:42:33] just bumped into
[1:42:36] him the Lord see so so now if we're not
[1:42:40] a part of the apostolic age then we have
[1:42:42] no right to expect God or to believe God
[1:42:46] to F us with the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:48] Ghost then it's all a makeup we're just
[1:42:52] here working our elves up we're we're
[1:42:55] just a another cult we're just another
[1:42:57] you know it's just another fling it's
[1:42:59] just whatever can you say amen and and
[1:43:02] if they're if we're not in the apostolic
[1:43:03] age then we have no right to Expect
[1:43:06] Miracles can you say Amen then you have
[1:43:10] then then all you've got is to take what
[1:43:12] a doctor says about you if he says
[1:43:14] you're going to die believe it and just
[1:43:15] go dig your
[1:43:18] grave can you say Amen if if they say
[1:43:21] you ain't going to make it then just
[1:43:23] believe
[1:43:23] it if you feel like you ain't going to
[1:43:26] make it you're you're just going to
[1:43:27] succumb to the trials and the and and
[1:43:29] the things and just believe it lay down
[1:43:31] and die
[1:43:33] on because if we're not in that
[1:43:36] Apostolic age we ain't got no right to
[1:43:38] expect God to work will come on the
[1:43:39] scene but if we are in that Apostolic
[1:43:42] age which I believe we are then we have
[1:43:45] every right to believe in angels we have
[1:43:48] every right to believe in the Holy Ghost
[1:43:50] not only for us but for our children
[1:43:53] and we have every right to believe that
[1:43:55] God is going to come on the scene and
[1:43:57] work miracle I don't know what you are
[1:43:59] facing this morning but God is a god of
[1:44:03] Miracles yes he is amen God is a god of
[1:44:06] Miracles you believe that amen if there
[1:44:09] was no Apostolic age no such thing as
[1:44:12] angels and no such thing as Miracles and
[1:44:15] and and and and the Holy Ghost and all
[1:44:17] of these things then then the
[1:44:18] supernatural real would be dead to us as
[1:44:22] it is so many other
[1:44:26] people
[1:44:27] dead people who believe that the
[1:44:29] apostolic ages ceased then then the
[1:44:32] supernatural that Unseen World Is Dead
[1:44:34] to them they just sat in church and rot
[1:44:38] they just go through the religious
[1:44:41] duties can you say
[1:44:43] amen that's right see we see the caral
[1:44:47] church today and you just forgive me but
[1:44:50] you know Pentecostal Baptist Lutheran
[1:44:53] Jehovah's Witness Mormons apostolics
[1:44:54] whatever is just like Israel in Jesus's
[1:44:58] day brother R said they're taking the
[1:45:00] church the Commandments the teaching of
[1:45:03] the Bible and explained it all away and
[1:45:05] therefore you make the Commandments of
[1:45:07] God without any effect think of that
[1:45:11] preaching the promises of God and yet
[1:45:13] they have no effect upon the people
[1:45:15] because by some way you doubted that you
[1:45:18] changed it well he is the god of
[1:45:20] Miracles but that was
[1:45:21] yesterday oh no and you say Amen oh yes
[1:45:25] there is adoption of sons but that's
[1:45:28] tomorrow brother R say we're praising
[1:45:30] God for what he done and we're praising
[1:45:32] God for what he's going to do and we
[1:45:33] failed to figure out what he's doing
[1:45:35] today amen can you say Amen see you make
[1:45:39] the Commandments of God without any
[1:45:41] effect the promises of God without any
[1:45:44] effect you take the word of God and
[1:45:46] explain it all the way into some sort of
[1:45:48] a Creed and then you cry where is the
[1:45:51] god of the Bible that's what the world
[1:45:54] is looking for is the god of the Bible
[1:45:56] where are they at where is he well
[1:45:58] they've explained it
[1:46:00] away can you say amen he said you've
[1:46:03] explained them away you took it all away
[1:46:06] from the people when you tell them the
[1:46:08] days of Miracles is passed there's no
[1:46:10] such thing as the Holy Ghost there's no
[1:46:12] such thing as Divine Healing there's no
[1:46:13] such thing as visits of angels see
[1:46:16] there's no such thing is Miracles and
[1:46:18] when you do that you explain all the
[1:46:20] supernatural away from the Bible and you
[1:46:22] take God right out of the church when
[1:46:24] you do it by your
[1:46:26] Traditions amen oh aren't you glad that
[1:46:28] God would send a prophet to get us away
[1:46:31] from the
[1:46:34] Traditions you that's right see you
[1:46:36] can't know God without experiencing the
[1:46:38] supernatural because God is
[1:46:41] Supernatural ain't that right the new
[1:46:43] birth you can't have the new birth
[1:46:45] without experiencing the supernatural
[1:46:47] because it is
[1:46:49] Supernatural you believe that our
[1:46:51] experience with God is is Supernatural
[1:46:54] we walk with the supernatural that's
[1:46:56] what that means we're climbing up Glory
[1:46:58] walking with the
[1:47:00] supernatural in touch with the
[1:47:05] supernatural healing comes from the
[1:47:07] supernatural Deliverance comes from that
[1:47:09] Supernatural Rim do you believe that yes
[1:47:13] sir our help comes from the
[1:47:15] supernatural now do you realize that
[1:47:17] this message that was sent to us by God
[1:47:21] is of the supernatural amen right that's
[1:47:25] right it's of the supernatural now think
[1:47:27] of it if if if there's no Supernatural
[1:47:30] then how did them people in the Old
[1:47:32] Testament get
[1:47:33] healed when they were dying by snake
[1:47:36] bites right you know what a prophet told
[1:47:39] us there was a healing Angel a healing
[1:47:44] angel on that brass
[1:47:47] Serpent and all the people had to do was
[1:47:50] look and live amen because it was more
[1:47:54] than just a natural pole with a natural
[1:47:56] little figure of a snake there was a
[1:48:00] super natural element to it a healing
[1:48:03] Angel was on that on that on that pole
[1:48:07] that's right see and so they all they
[1:48:09] had to do was look and live amen see so
[1:48:12] now you know there are angels of healing
[1:48:16] the prophet said that have been
[1:48:18] commissioned by God to us amen angels of
[1:48:23] healing sure absolutely oh my if we
[1:48:27] could really understand that God help us
[1:48:31] then we won't have to look to
[1:48:32] medication we won't have to look to
[1:48:35] science and we're not against medication
[1:48:36] and we're not against whatever I'm just
[1:48:39] telling you amen and brother Brown if
[1:48:41] you go look look it up study it up it's
[1:48:43] because of scientific research and the
[1:48:46] Improvement of science that man's faith
[1:48:49] has become slow in the Supernatural
[1:48:52] yeah right can you say Amen brother but
[1:48:57] see there is an angel of
[1:49:01] healing that when the medicine don't
[1:49:03] work there is a supernatural
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] Rim you believe
[1:49:11] it amen how did the people get healed at
[1:49:15] the pool of
[1:49:16] Bethesda y brother Brown said there was
[1:49:18] an angel of healing in it praise the
[1:49:20] Lord yes sir see so it wasn't the
[1:49:23] natural that done it it was the
[1:49:26] supernatural that had come upon the
[1:49:29] natural you believe that now brother
[1:49:31] brandom said what what it was it was the
[1:49:34] angel of Mercy Hallelujah the angel of
[1:49:39] healing that moved upon that
[1:49:43] water they could not see
[1:49:46] it they couldn't see the angel but they
[1:49:49] knew something was stirring that Ang or
[1:49:52] that water that's right something was
[1:49:54] troubling that
[1:49:56] water ain't that right see and so
[1:49:59] therefore the people in order to receive
[1:50:02] the benefits of this they had to run to
[1:50:07] that
[1:50:09] water while the healing Angel was there
[1:50:12] that angel of Mercy they had to run not
[1:50:14] run away from it it ain't the time to
[1:50:18] run away it's time to run
[1:50:21] in what the waters are
[1:50:24] troubled ain't that right so so now
[1:50:27] brother Bram says today even now the
[1:50:29] Holy Spirit I want you to listen now the
[1:50:31] supernatural power of God is in the
[1:50:34] Earth how many believes that moving
[1:50:36] showing things and people run from it
[1:50:40] instead of getting into it what was this
[1:50:42] message all about it was the
[1:50:44] supernatural power of God that was
[1:50:48] moving upon the Earth and people ran
[1:50:51] from it instead of getting in
[1:50:54] it he said see instead of getting into
[1:50:57] it the word made flesh and Vindicated
[1:51:00] the very things that he did and promised
[1:51:02] that he would do does the same
[1:51:06] things see so it was the man that sit up
[1:51:10] at the front waiting for the
[1:51:11] supernatural to move upon the waters
[1:51:14] that got something from God am ain't
[1:51:17] that right waiting for the moving of the
[1:51:21] water the Lord come on now he wasn't
[1:51:24] lexed about
[1:51:26] it he had a need that's right and as
[1:51:30] soon as he realized that that angel was
[1:51:33] moving upon them water he jumped
[1:51:36] in not setting back so well I don't know
[1:51:38] if that is that angel or
[1:51:40] not that might have just been me
[1:51:42] thinking about
[1:51:45] that see so so the prophet said see the
[1:51:49] moment he saw it moving he pressed to
[1:51:52] get in in press
[1:51:54] press can you say amen that's right see
[1:51:58] now what was it what was it that was on
[1:52:00] the prophet of God in this day right
[1:52:03] notice brother Bram said if you look not
[1:52:05] at the man your brother don't look at
[1:52:08] the
[1:52:10] natural just your
[1:52:12] brother but if you'll look to what I'm
[1:52:14] speaking about the Lord Jesus and his
[1:52:16] healing Angel is at the
[1:52:19] platform amen hallah
[1:52:23] it was no longer God moving upon natural
[1:52:27] Waters it was now the angel of Mercy the
[1:52:30] Angel Healing a angel was now moving
[1:52:34] Upon A
[1:52:37] man then you say amen he said I'm not
[1:52:40] God's Gift the angel is God's gift it
[1:52:43] came out of Heaven I came from the earth
[1:52:45] and he came from Heaven down to in
[1:52:48] Shroud or enclothe an Earthly vessel to
[1:52:51] speak to Earthly people see that if you
[1:52:55] would believe on him not on me but on
[1:52:58] him of what I'm talking of and by doing
[1:53:01] that God will heal
[1:53:05] you that healing
[1:53:08] Angel is in the message right that if
[1:53:12] you can just believe it not even
[1:53:15] cancer can you say Amen to think of it
[1:53:19] if they were there at that pool of water
[1:53:21] and they saw that angel upon that water
[1:53:23] troubling the water they saw the
[1:53:25] supernatural what if they just said well
[1:53:27] I've got tuberculosis I that that's just
[1:53:29] too much doctor says I'm going to die
[1:53:31] there ain't no hope no no no he would
[1:53:33] have never got it and that's the thing
[1:53:36] way same way with a lot of people today
[1:53:39] if they look at the message and they
[1:53:40] limit God in this
[1:53:42] message they ain't going to get what
[1:53:44] they need that's right amen that's right
[1:53:48] you believe that so another place he
[1:53:51] said God's gift is the spirit of God
[1:53:54] that came down in the form of an Angel
[1:53:57] amen God's gift is the spirit of God
[1:54:00] that come down in the form of an angel
[1:54:03] now this isn't a worship of man and it
[1:54:05] isn't a worship of
[1:54:07] angels
[1:54:09] hello amen see but what we are looking
[1:54:12] at and believing we're looking at and
[1:54:15] believing what the angel of the Lord has
[1:54:19] come upon in this last day praise the
[1:54:21] Lord
[1:54:23] amen and we're commanded to do that by
[1:54:25] God look Isaiah 45:22 look unto
[1:54:29] me look un me and you know brother
[1:54:31] brandom used that scripture for his
[1:54:33] opening scripture in in looking under
[1:54:37] Jesus look ain't that right look unto me
[1:54:41] and be you saved all the ends of the
[1:54:45] Earth
[1:54:47] when now no other time have we been at
[1:54:51] the ends plural of the earth everything
[1:54:55] has come to its end politics come to its
[1:54:57] end religions come to its end
[1:54:59] denominations come to its end hello the
[1:55:02] cycle of man the cycle of mortality has
[1:55:04] come to its end everything is coming to
[1:55:07] its end that's right and at the end of
[1:55:10] the Earth ends look unto
[1:55:14] me why and be ye saved amen amen ain't
[1:55:21] that right praise the Lord
[1:55:23] now God has brother Brown said his angel
[1:55:26] from glory to manifest to his people he
[1:55:29] sent his angel from glory to manifest to
[1:55:31] his people the prophetic gift of God
[1:55:34] which can only bring Faith up into a
[1:55:37] level to where you can be healed or
[1:55:39] accept your healing from Jesus
[1:55:41] Christ is that right another place said
[1:55:45] if you don't believe me that I've told
[1:55:46] you the truth you'll never benefit by it
[1:55:49] that's why you must not doubt this
[1:55:51] message
[1:55:53] that's why you must believe this message
[1:55:54] whether you understand it or
[1:55:59] not yes sir you can't convince me that a
[1:56:02] man can understand this Bible more than
[1:56:05] a prophet
[1:56:07] can come on
[1:56:09] now amen can you say
[1:56:12] amen I know they'll say well well you
[1:56:14] know brother Bram didn't say this or or
[1:56:17] the Bible doesn't say this about makeup
[1:56:18] and they didn't say this about this and
[1:56:20] this and this so so brother brand must
[1:56:22] have been wrong so I'm just going to
[1:56:23] take what the Bible says about
[1:56:26] it when the prophet says that a prophet
[1:56:29] is a Divine interpretator of the Divine
[1:56:32] of the written word right true I will
[1:56:35] take his interpretation more than my own
[1:56:39] more than
[1:56:40] yours more than
[1:56:42] anyone's I'll take it more than
[1:56:44] scoffield or more than you know
[1:56:48] whatever why because I recognize that
[1:56:51] the healing Angel was on that
[1:56:54] man
[1:56:56] hello
[1:56:59] amen that's right maybe someone's
[1:57:02] pushing back cuz you don't believe that
[1:57:03] but it's
[1:57:05] true can you say
[1:57:08] Amen now the message everybody say the
[1:57:12] message the message is where the angel
[1:57:15] of the Lord is
[1:57:18] moving you believe it that's right how
[1:57:21] do you know that because the prophet
[1:57:23] said the angel of the Lord accompanies
[1:57:25] this message
[1:57:26] always you want you you want to die in
[1:57:29] your ministry go start preaching
[1:57:33] Spurgeon hello start start start
[1:57:36] preaching you know Clarence lens start
[1:57:38] preaching some other thing outside the
[1:57:41] message you want you you want your
[1:57:43] ministry to die start mixing theirs with
[1:57:45] this
[1:57:49] message start mixing your own ideas with
[1:57:51] this message and you'll die and and dry
[1:57:53] up and and and all this why the angel of
[1:57:56] the Lord doesn't accompany our ministry
[1:57:59] it accompanies the
[1:58:00] message and there's a lot of people that
[1:58:03] have ministers that have gotten caught
[1:58:04] up and and lifted up thinking they're
[1:58:06] the one that's keeping themselves and
[1:58:08] they've walked away from this message
[1:58:09] and ain't
[1:58:11] nobody's can you say Amen but what makes
[1:58:14] our home the way it is is we follow the
[1:58:16] message what makes our life the way it
[1:58:19] is is we follow the message what makes
[1:58:21] our church Church the way it is we
[1:58:23] follow the message of the hour because
[1:58:26] the angel of the Lord accompanies the
[1:58:28] message
[1:58:34] always I believe it amen brother Bram
[1:58:37] talked of a young man who was standing
[1:58:38] in a
[1:58:39] meeting where his dad felt that he
[1:58:41] should go send
[1:58:45] him in brother bram's meetings
[1:58:49] and the young man was standing
[1:58:52] there and the prophet said he saw the
[1:58:55] supernatural hand of God and quickly he
[1:58:57] become a Christian he was ready to
[1:58:59] accept it for he seen the moving of the
[1:59:02] water and he know there was something
[1:59:05] Supernatural see it's not a join Church
[1:59:09] shake hands and a million more in
[1:59:12] 44 it's not a new church a new building
[1:59:15] or a new something it was new life that
[1:59:19] come by a supernatural move
[1:59:22] that they were looking for it to happen
[1:59:25] see so they know now he's talking about
[1:59:27] in the old test or the the the pool of
[1:59:30] they know every season see then that
[1:59:33] angel would come down see so they waited
[1:59:36] they knew that at that season the angel
[1:59:39] would come and they waited they wouldn't
[1:59:41] take an impersonation they wouldn't take
[1:59:43] what someone else says about it they
[1:59:45] waited for the
[1:59:47] Supernatural come on church right that's
[1:59:50] that's that's where we set separated
[1:59:52] from the the Pentecostals is because the
[1:59:55] Pentecostals are so gullible they'll
[1:59:57] take anything and everything and and
[1:59:59] just gobble it down where a message
[2:00:02] believer they understand that there is a
[2:00:04] season there is a timing that God moves
[2:00:07] he'll move in a church he'll move in a
[2:00:09] home he moves in our personal lives and
[2:00:12] we wait for the moving of the
[2:00:16] water
[2:00:18] hallu amen so he said see he said see
[2:00:23] they knew it was going to they know
[2:00:26] every certain season then it come down
[2:00:28] and they waited today he said if it
[2:00:32] isn't going on all the time and we're on
[2:00:35] the top of the house jumping around see
[2:00:38] then we say well we'll leave this church
[2:00:40] see it's cooled off what nonsense how
[2:00:44] can't see how we can't wait Abraham see
[2:00:48] he didn't think God had cooled off he
[2:00:51] waited 20
[2:00:54] years CU he knew he needed the
[2:00:56] supernatural power of God to do
[2:01:00] it can you say
[2:01:03] Amen so he waited 25 years and in all of
[2:01:07] that time he didn't think God cool off
[2:01:09] he didn't think God denied his word the
[2:01:12] Bible says he grew stronger in faith the
[2:01:15] weaker his body got the stronger he got
[2:01:18] cuz he was waiting he was looking for a
[2:01:20] supernatural
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] do you believe that he says and then he
[2:01:26] says and they waited at a sheep gate
[2:01:28] from month to month for whatever it was
[2:01:31] for that one Supernatural moving but
[2:01:34] they looked for it oh my they were
[2:01:35] looking for it and today we've lost that
[2:01:37] Vision Pentecost we've lost something
[2:01:40] let's look to Christ Our denominations
[2:01:42] has spread itself till it's went way out
[2:01:45] and now we're fighting and trying to get
[2:01:46] more and bigger churches higher classes
[2:01:49] educ better educated preachers and
[2:01:51] things and what have we got we've got
[2:01:53] away from the very thing that God told
[2:01:55] us to look
[2:01:56] at what are you looking at he says look
[2:01:59] and live right that's what we must do if
[2:02:03] we expect to
[2:02:05] live right others might might have
[2:02:07] laughed at them and said oh that bunch
[2:02:09] of Holy Rollers down there around that
[2:02:11] pool why they say you know he says it's
[2:02:14] it's nothing but wind that's moving that
[2:02:17] well the wind comes down and blows the
[2:02:19] water back that ain't that always the
[2:02:21] Skeptics
[2:02:22] that's right the the angel of the Lord
[2:02:24] will come down and move up on that water
[2:02:26] and there's always got to be somebody
[2:02:28] well I think it's the wind yeah it's the
[2:02:30] wind you know I saw that little hair
[2:02:33] move and and you know they're getting
[2:02:35] excited and worked up about for nothing
[2:02:37] they're going to get laughed at and and
[2:02:39] all of that see what brother Brown said
[2:02:41] but it wasn't to them that was waiting
[2:02:43] on the supernatural it was the angel of
[2:02:46] Mercy it was the angel of healing can
[2:02:49] you say Amen now they may call Fanatics
[2:02:52] for jumping and shouting and hollering
[2:02:54] and spitting and slobbering and they
[2:02:56] might say you're working everybody up
[2:02:58] but it ain't to those that are part of
[2:03:00] it amen it's the angel of Mercy it's the
[2:03:04] angel of healing that has come by our
[2:03:09] way that's right yes sir they try to get
[2:03:12] us quiet they try to get us former and
[2:03:15] you know I mean they' got people in the
[2:03:17] message that don't even believe coming
[2:03:18] to the Altar and slobbering and spitting
[2:03:20] anymore crying it
[2:03:24] out driede confessions and all that and
[2:03:29] it might be just a work up mental thing
[2:03:31] to them but to us that have found the
[2:03:33] angel of Mercy it's something else is
[2:03:36] troubling our
[2:03:42] hearts this message might be nothing to
[2:03:45] anybody to everybody else but to us it's

[2:09:58] sins are forgiven
[2:10:00] them the Lord tell them they never did
[2:10:03] it in the first place you think a
[2:10:05] prophet could make that up looking at a
[2:10:07] carnal born people people of all kinds
[2:10:09] of faults and all that how could a
[2:10:11] prophet look at that that group of
[2:10:13] people that have been messed up in their
[2:10:15] marriages been messed up in their lives
[2:10:17] been drunks prostitutes and all that and
[2:10:19] he looks at them people and he says but
[2:10:21] you're The sinless Virtuous spotless
[2:10:24] bride of Jesus Christ it had to be
[2:10:27] something greater than a man bring forth
[2:10:30] a message like that
[2:10:33] amen can you say amen
[2:10:37] amen he's appeared just before judgment
[2:10:40] sits in now notice the same people that
[2:10:43] believed in God was and wasas of God
[2:10:46] killed Jesus but Jesus said as you
[2:10:49] believed in God believe also in me
[2:10:51] is that right see they were God
[2:10:54] believers they believed in his father
[2:10:57] see but they believe but they must
[2:11:00] believe that he was the son sent from
[2:11:02] the father and not the father but he was
[2:11:05] the son sent from the father notice what
[2:11:07] he continues on to say I am neither
[2:11:10] father son nor Holy Ghost I am a man
[2:11:14] your
[2:11:15] brother with a Ministry Vindicated by a
[2:11:18] supernatural being not me it's the Angel
[2:11:22] of the Lord that has come from God to
[2:11:24] minister these blessings to
[2:11:27] you
[2:11:28] Amen Hallelujah Lord you see why we stay
[2:11:32] so dedicated to the message loyal to the
[2:11:36] message to preach this message amen I
[2:11:38] don't care what everybody else does and
[2:11:40] what they are I'm here for the
[2:11:42] bride I'm part of the Bride because I
[2:11:44] know God sent a angel of Mercy for me to
[2:11:49] call me out by the m message of the hour
[2:11:52] that's right and what it's doing it's
[2:11:54] ministering blessings see we're going to
[2:11:56] need a body
[2:11:58] change how you going to get it without
[2:12:01] Mercy can you say Amen we're going to
[2:12:04] need to escape this wrath that is coming
[2:12:06] on how we going to do that we're just
[2:12:09] common born Sinners but there's an angel
[2:12:11] of Mercy that has begin to talk he began
[2:12:14] to move upon the Earth he began to move
[2:12:16] upon a human being amen and ens shroud
[2:12:19] himself and we've looked and we've lived
[2:12:22] because we see it's of
[2:12:25] Goden let them say that we're worshiping
[2:12:27] a man I don't care I still ain't going
[2:12:30] to be ashamed of that
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:36] picture brother Ram says another place
[2:12:38] when this anointing comes on me well
[2:12:41] that's the angel the gift of God which
[2:12:44] is a messenger an angel sent from God
[2:12:47] and now it's part of God an attribute of
[2:12:49] God and then their spirit now and we
[2:12:52] break from the natural into the
[2:12:54] Supernatural and then in between here
[2:12:57] your spirit is speaking to me see and
[2:13:00] I'm speaking back to you through mortal
[2:13:02] lips but both to anointing see now if
[2:13:06] the spirit here that's on me is to bless
[2:13:09] you not that I can bless you but it can
[2:13:13] Bless you that's right amen it ain't the
[2:13:15] man that can bless you it's the angel
[2:13:22] can you say Amen this is why we're still
[2:13:25] believing the way we believe it even
[2:13:27] though brother bram's gone that's right
[2:13:29] and we're not getting dead and
[2:13:31] formal and going to
[2:13:35] relics the angel is still
[2:13:38] here you're traveling the King's Highway
[2:13:41] upward and there's a supernatural
[2:13:45] Rim that is holding you protecting you
[2:13:50] keeping you
[2:13:52] inspiring you
[2:13:54] am praise the
[2:13:57] Lord amen bless the name of the
[2:14:00] Lord so what this is is like the moving
[2:14:03] of the
[2:14:04] waters to those who
[2:14:06] believe it's the same Supernatural angel
[2:14:09] of God
[2:14:10] moving now
[2:14:12] notice brother Braham said Angelic
[2:14:14] beings are ordained ministers of God to
[2:14:17] come to the Earth to Bear record of God
[2:14:19] they work through mortal beings just as
[2:14:22] they did Daniel and back through the
[2:14:24] ages there ain't that right now so the
[2:14:28] reason why people can't really truly
[2:14:30] believe the message of the hour is
[2:14:32] because they really don't believe in the
[2:14:35] Supernatural but now as I wind it down
[2:14:38] now what makes us believe this
[2:14:41] message Lord I I got a lot more but I I
[2:14:44] I just realize the time
[2:14:47] sorry but what makes us believe it
[2:14:50] because as the angel and we've got the
[2:14:53] Titan
[2:14:54] now Elie are going after a bride for
[2:14:57] Isaac he didn't know who she was didn't
[2:15:01] know where she would
[2:15:02] be didn't know what kind of
[2:15:06] girl she just he didn't know so what a
[2:15:09] challenge that was to try to pick a girl
[2:15:12] out of all the other girls for Isaac and
[2:15:15] he knew he had to have the right one
[2:15:18] amen so he goes and and and starts
[2:15:23] looking and the prophet says that the
[2:15:26] angel of the Lord beat
[2:15:28] elaser to the well beat beat him about a
[2:15:33] half hour 30 minutes before elaser got
[2:15:36] there and he started the angel of the
[2:15:38] Lord started speaking to Rebecca praise
[2:15:42] the Lord go to the
[2:15:45] wh something just nudged her amen you
[2:15:48] ever just had them kind of thoughts
[2:15:52] something just pray listen to a
[2:15:55] tape go here and do
[2:15:58] this something just whm up in you oh I
[2:16:01] believe this
[2:16:02] message it's the angel of the Lord
[2:16:06] amen that's right and the angel of the
[2:16:08] Lord moved her see and and he says
[2:16:11] Rebecca came to the water at evening
[2:16:13] time he said you get the picture it's
[2:16:15] the church in this last days the evening
[2:16:18] time we're not talking about the the
[2:16:20] denomination and all this stuff we're
[2:16:22] not talking about other ages we're
[2:16:24] talking about evening time Rebecca typed
[2:16:26] you he typed Us in this evening
[2:16:31] time and there she was the angel of the
[2:16:34] Lord preparing her heart and he said see
[2:16:37] uh uh it's the church in the last days
[2:16:40] evening time the evening lights are here
[2:16:42] it's the time that the angel of the Lord
[2:16:44] in a Supernatural is revealing himself
[2:16:46] to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac and
[2:16:49] somehow or another she's move to go to
[2:16:52] the Waters of life oh my heart is
[2:16:55] turning over with joy I can hardly
[2:16:57] preach when I think of that the evening
[2:16:59] time has come the angel of the Lord's in
[2:17:02] the message Goes Forth and Woos the
[2:17:05] Rebecca to come to the Waters of Life
[2:17:07] what is it it's the moving of the
[2:17:11] supernatural it's not
[2:17:15] Frolic I know there there's a lot of
[2:17:17] Frolic in churches and I know there's a
[2:17:19] lot of Frolic around the world
[2:17:21] today but this ain't
[2:17:24] Frolic when you see these young people
[2:17:27] dancing and shouting that's not frolic
[2:17:30] prise the Lord praise the
[2:17:32] Lord I believe there's genuine in
[2:17:39] that brother B brandom leaned more to
[2:17:42] the side of fanaticism than he did the
[2:17:45] formal
[2:17:47] side he said I would rather have too
[2:17:49] much Wildfire than no no fire at all
[2:17:52] that's right
[2:17:54] right what he ain't that right so this
[2:17:57] isn't just another group setting here
[2:17:59] this morning that's went from one Church
[2:18:01] to another church or from one Doctrine
[2:18:03] to another right or that's just changed
[2:18:05] their mind from one belief to
[2:18:08] another this is the moving of the
[2:18:11] waters the moving of the angel of God
[2:18:14] that has prepared our hearts to believe
[2:18:16] this message yeah do you believe it amen
[2:18:21] do you love him
[2:18:23] amen if the musicians Will Come Bless
[2:18:27] the name of the Lord you see elaser
[2:18:32] come and the angel of Mercy
[2:18:35] come in this age looking for a
[2:18:39] bride there's so many types of the bride
[2:18:42] and and to be
[2:18:44] honest the ones that God uses for to
[2:18:47] depict the bride aren't good reputation
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:18:51] they really weren't much look at
[2:18:54] Ruth she coming from a
[2:18:57] heathen Nation
[2:19:00] Moab that was was born out of
[2:19:04] sin didn't know
[2:19:08] God but yet God would pick her to type
[2:19:11] us about it and she would say thy God
[2:19:14] would be my God thy people will be my
[2:19:17] people thy land will be my land
[2:19:22] I will I will go with you amen why
[2:19:25] because God ordained her to type out you
[2:19:28] and I the real
[2:19:31] bride look look look at Rahab the
[2:19:34] Harlot she's another one that would type
[2:19:36] out the bride
[2:19:38] that's no not a good reputation just the
[2:19:41] scum of the Earth but God would pick
[2:19:44] her and bring her from there into the
[2:19:48] palace hallu because he would show that
[2:19:51] there would be a bride just like that he
[2:19:54] would pick up people that would not be
[2:19:56] perfect that would not be without
[2:19:57] blemishes and with all that the only way
[2:19:59] we could ever be perfect without blemish
[2:20:01] was to be a blood that he would provide
[2:20:03] it would be a perfect blood that would
[2:20:05] wash us and cover us completely
[2:20:07] perfectly that when God looks at us he
[2:20:09] can no longer see you at all that's why
[2:20:12] he'll never see you brother Bill as a
[2:20:14] sinner you'll never be before God as a
[2:20:17] sinner again because he come and he
[2:20:19] bought you
[2:20:21] he cleansed you then he poured his life
[2:20:24] into you and then he set you on the path
[2:20:28] this ladder up to
[2:20:31] Glory you can never you can never be an
[2:20:34] enemy in God's sight again you can never
[2:20:38] be a vagabond in God's sight again you
[2:20:41] are a son of God and God has made every
[2:20:44] way for you to make it and you will make
[2:20:48] it it's a sure thing
[2:20:51] amen can you believe
[2:20:54] it can you accept your
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:20:58] pardon you know there's times where I
[2:21:01] just don't feel worthy I I just feel so
[2:21:03] beat down my past and I thank God I'm a
[2:21:07] failure I don't know if you've ever go
[2:21:09] through all that but Satan just fights
[2:21:11] my
[2:21:12] mind I was praying just yesterday I said
[2:21:15] God help me to accept that
[2:21:17] pardon help me just so believe it and so
[2:21:20] anchor
[2:21:21] that you know and then I just begin to
[2:21:23] speak to the devil devil you're a liar
[2:21:25] that's right God's blood has washed me
[2:21:28] clean you see you can't let the devil
[2:21:31] fight you in your mind without saying
[2:21:33] something you got to speak back I'm on
[2:21:37] my way to the King's Highway I'm on my
[2:21:40] way to glory and I ain't turning back
[2:21:43] for no
[2:21:44] one and if I fail there's angels to pick
[2:21:46] me
[2:21:47] [Applause]
[2:21:49] up if I fall down I ain't going so far
[2:21:51] that God can't reach down he's already
[2:21:53] got the Angels because I'm a
[2:21:55] predestinated
[2:21:57] seed and sometimes you have to talk to
[2:21:59] the devil just like that don't you let
[2:22:00] the devil fight you in your mind without
[2:22:03] saying something back that's where we
[2:22:05] get guilty we we let the devil fight us
[2:22:07] and we just stay silent and we start
[2:22:09] entertaining this thing and not
[2:22:10] realizing it's the devil just ripping
[2:22:12] you from King Kingdom to come you
[2:22:15] understand what I'm saying see and it's
[2:22:17] time that we put a notice to the devil
[2:22:19] and say you know devil
[2:22:21] I'm not going to entertain them thoughts
[2:22:22] anymore I'm going to entertain what
[2:22:25] Jesus said I'm going to entertain what
[2:22:27] the God said God wouldn't have called me
[2:22:29] to this
[2:22:31] message right if I cannot receive the
[2:22:33] benefits of it but I believe this
[2:22:35] message and I'm going to receive every

[2:25:05] existence of angels and their
[2:25:09] presence and he said remember friends

[2:25:13] God is God's gift to send that's the
[2:25:16] gift of healing I'm just a man that he's
[2:25:18] the angel of the Lord and he's here

[2:25:23] judgment you'll find out that angel is
[2:25:26] standing right here close to my side and
[2:25:29] that's not a fictitious
[2:25:31] belief and I want to say to you church

[2:25:36] angels are here with us right

[2:25:42] room that the angel of Mercy is
[2:25:45] here the angels of God are encamped
[2:25:48] around that's not fictitious
[2:25:51] he said you mark my words if you class
[2:25:53] me and which by Honor you say it and by
[2:25:56] love you class me to be God's sear

[2:27:15] date but we were here in town and
[2:27:20] we was driving close to where brother
[2:27:22] Amos lives and sister Lisa lives and car
[2:27:26] pulls out right in front of
[2:27:28] us and stops his car died I guess but he
[2:27:32] didn't he didn't he was going downhill
[2:27:34] and he didn't stop at the stop signing
[2:27:36] he come down and we had a slam on our
[2:27:42] brakes we go down
[2:27:47] just a little ways by the Long John
[2:27:50] Silvers there on r Oak Road
[2:27:53] and man didn't stop pulls right out in
[2:27:57] front of us I locked my breaks and I
[2:27:59] knew I was going to t-bone
[2:28:01] him and I had to swerve and time I got
