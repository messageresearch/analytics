[37:36] through treacherous times I I see what
[37:39] Israel's going through Israel you know
[37:41] the the brides promis to squeeze I think
[37:43] Israel is going through her squeeze
[37:45] right now this is this is the toughest
[37:47] time she's had since 1948 when she
[37:50] become you know a nation the five major
[37:52] Wars that she fought all of them
[37:53] supernaturally they she won by the grace
[37:56] of God but and she will win this one but
[38:00] uh we just pray for Israel can you hear
[38:03] okay yeah no can't you hear okay anyway
[38:07] all right but anyway we're going to uh
[38:11] talk tonight a little bit about a
[38:12] subject that um a message subject that's
[38:15] all I know I'm just a message preacher
[38:16] that's all I know to talk about is a
[38:17] message so that's what we're going to
[38:19] let's turn if we could to the Book of
[38:22] Luke and we'll read a little bit and let
[38:26] you be seated
[38:31] Luke chapter 21 and we'll start with
[38:32] verse
[38:35] 25 now this is Jesus speaking and let me
[38:39] take my coat
[38:49] off Jesus speaking now he's speaking to
[38:51] the people in his day of course but this
[38:54] scripture that we're reading actually is
[38:56] referring to our day and so we we always
[39:00] we really like
[39:01] to uh be updated on present day truth
[39:04] and speak about present day truth so
[39:06] that's what we're going to kind of talk
[39:07] about a little bit tonight Luke chap 21:
[39:11] 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun
[39:14] and in the moon and in the stars and
[39:16] upon the Earth distress of nations with
[39:19] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[39:23] men's Hearts fading them for fear see we
[39:26] begin to see you were talking about our
[39:28] day and for the looking after those
[39:29] things which are coming on the earth for
[39:32] the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and
[39:35] then shall they see the son of man
[39:38] coming in a cloud with power and great
[39:42] Glory now we absolutely know that that
[39:44] particular scripture verse 27 Luke 21:27
[39:47] was fulfilled in our day the son of man
[39:49] came in a cloud with power that was what
[39:51] actually happened in 63 the cloud in
[39:53] Arizona that even brother Ram said
[39:55] there's our Lord up there so you know
[39:57] they had first Exodus you had the pillar
[39:59] of fire pillar of cloud second Exodus
[40:01] you had Pillar of Fire pillar of cloud
[40:03] Third Exodus Pillar of Fire pillar of
[40:05] cloud this is such a tremendous Ministry
[40:08] that God has given this day just like
[40:10] the first just like the second also the
[40:12] third verse 28 and when these things
[40:15] begin to come to pass then look up and
[40:18] lift up your heads for your Redemption
[40:20] draweth nigh now we know how close we
[40:23] are getting surely skip down to verse 31
[40:26] so likewise so likewise ye when you see
[40:29] these things come to pass know you that
[40:31] the kingdom of God is n at hand that's
[40:34] what the whole message is is the getting
[40:36] a bride prepared being clothed with the
[40:38] word 32 verily I say unto you this
[40:41] generation shall not pass till all be
[40:44] fulfilled which generation not the
[40:47] generation J was Jesus speaking to but
[40:49] the generation that saw which saw
[40:51] actually see or saw the son of man being
[40:54] revealed that's a generation that won't
[40:56] pass away that's our generation amen
[40:59] this generation will be the witness of
[41:00] the son of man coming in a cloud verse
[41:02] 33 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but
[41:05] my word shall not pass away verse 34 and
[41:08] and take heed to yourselves lest at any
[41:10] time you are now here's a challenge to
[41:12] all of us it really does the bride
[41:14] doesn't fall in this category however
[41:16] it's a challenge the leay out to seea
[41:17] she has fallen to this take heed to
[41:19] yourselves less than any time your
[41:21] hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
[41:24] drunkenness cares of life and so that
[41:26] that Day come upon you unawares you know
[41:29] what surfing means it's really strange
[41:31] surfing means the giddiness and he
[41:34] headache caused by excessive
[41:36] drinking surfing I mean you know just
[41:39] like brother B talks about you know arth
[41:41] of godfre knows you know America just ha
[41:43] haa that's just the spirit of America
[41:45] you know giddiness and you know that's
[41:47] that's surfing drunkenness you know
[41:49] actually drunkenness that that dulls
[41:51] your senses to the proper reality think
[41:54] about these words you're for minuted
[41:55] even the cares of this life that's
[41:57] anxieties and the consumption you know
[41:59] of of worldly pleasures and then of
[42:02] course unawares you know Revelations 3 I
[42:05] was thinking about that being unaware he
[42:07] said in Revelations 3:14 you're wretched
[42:10] miserable naked blind poor and don't
[42:12] even know it unaware they don't even
[42:15] know it yet they're blind amen verse 35
[42:19] for as a snare shall come on all them
[42:22] that dwell on the face of the whole
[42:24] earth that the snare actually is
[42:25] unexpected un uh unexpected sudden trap
[42:29] that's a snare not on on them but not us
[42:33] 36 watch ye therefore and pray always
[42:35] that ye may be counted worthy to escape
[42:38] all these things that shall come to pass
[42:40] and to stand before the son of man
[42:43] remember that's this day we're going to
[42:45] talk about the son of man the son of man
[42:47] Ministry prophecy of it what it means
[42:50] and parallel that with uh actually the
[42:53] Holy Ghost himself now I want you to
[42:55] turn let's read that again wherefore
[42:57] watch you therefore pray always that you
[42:59] might be cter worthy to escape all these
[43:01] things as shall come to pass and to
[43:03] stand before the son of man we'll find
[43:06] out who the son of man is and turn we to
[43:09] First Peter 1113 I'm going to read that
[43:11] one scripture all to be seated this is
[43:13] probably my favorite one of my favorites
[43:16] I'm all of them are favorite but I
[43:17] really have a favorite scripture 1 Peter
[43:20] 1113 I just love this scripture it's
[43:22] just it's so relevant to our day is it
[43:26] very seldom ever preached on but it's so
[43:28] relevant to our day and Peter says
[43:31] wherefore gir up the loin of your mind
[43:34] be sober and hope to the end for the
[43:37] grace that is future is when he wrote
[43:40] that Grace that is to be brought to you
[43:43] brought unto you at the revelation of
[43:46] Jesus Christ now you understand Peter
[43:48] wrote this in .64 that was 30 something
[43:52] years after the Lord Jesus was crucified
[43:54] ascended so he's talking about when is
[43:56] when was or when is the revelation of
[43:59] Jesus Christ not at his day our day this
[44:02] is the son of man when the son of man is
[44:04] reveal so you see already the the the
[44:07] parallel there hey wherefore guard at
[44:10] the laws of your mind be sober and hope
[44:12] to the end for the grace now here's a
[44:14] really striking thought about that that
[44:16] Grace actually literally is translated
[44:19] as
[44:20] gift read it again G up the Lord with
[44:23] your mind be so and hope to the end for
[44:24] the
[44:25] gift that is be brought to you at the
[44:29] revelation of Jesus Christ then my mind
[44:32] went back to acts 238 what do it say
[44:35] repent therefore How does it go repent
[44:38] Peter said to them repent be baptized
[44:40] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[44:42] Christ for the remiss of sins and you
[44:43] shall receive
[44:45] the gift the gift of the Holy Ghost what
[44:49] is the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not
[44:52] tongues interpretation the gift of the
[44:54] Holy Ghost is eternal life the gift not
[44:57] the gifts the gift of the that's eternal
[45:00] life
[45:02] so the gift that is to be brought to you
[45:04] at the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[45:07] that's absolutely beautiful to me amen
[45:10] let's pray Lord
[45:11] Jesus such
[45:13] a small amount of scripture but such an
[45:16] array of of of depth Lord when we really
[45:19] could be begin to break it down we pray
[45:22] Lord you just give us understanding as
[45:24] what I'm going to try to bring by your
[45:27] help and give us understanding to the
[45:28] word Lord sanctify my thoughts Bless the
[45:31] people Lord that may we leave this place
[45:33] and say did not our hearts burn within
[45:34] us as he talked to us along the way we
[45:37] ask for your guidance Direction and
[45:39] Leadership and Bless the people we pray
[45:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[45:43] everybody says amen you can be
[45:49] seated and brother Daniel we sure are
[45:52] glad to see you back had a safe
[45:54] trip and all is well
[45:57] as I told them down there when I the
[45:59] trips that I made overseas I prayed two
[46:02] requests from the Lord Lord let me be a
[46:04] blessing to the people and don't let me
[46:06] get sick and by his grace he he honored
[46:10] that and and brother Daniel as far as I
[46:13] can understand the same blessing there
[46:15] he made it back without getting sick so
[46:17] that's just that's a that's a wonderful
[46:19] thing yes we're going to speak on
[46:21] tonight the Holy Ghost itself now we we
[46:25] taken that from the m Masterpiece
[46:27] brother B said the Masterpiece the Holy
[46:29] Ghost made way for the the baptism of
[46:31] the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[46:33] Ghost itself so let's we're not going to
[46:35] do any foundation introduction we're
[46:36] going to jump right into the middle of
[46:38] it okay
[46:39] class
[46:42] okay notice brother man says in the
[46:44] Masterpiece notice here the life that
[46:47] was in the shook Now Catch these life
[46:50] life life the life that was in this in
[46:53] the husk in the stalk and in the tassel
[46:56] and the all gathers in the seed and the
[47:00] life that was in the St went one went to
[47:02] make the other justification made way
[47:04] for sanctification sanctification
[47:06] sanctification made way for the baptism
[47:08] of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the
[47:09] Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[47:13] itself yeah one 2 3
[47:18] 4 Holy Ghost itself he said made way for
[47:21] the Holy Ghost himself to come right
[47:23] down this listen what he's saying to
[47:25] come right down in Perfection back to
[47:28] the word again to manifest itself so he
[47:31] said the Holy Ghost itself has come to
[47:33] do
[47:34] what to bring to come right down in
[47:37] Perfection back to the word again to
[47:39] manifest itself so it's all focused the
[47:42] life is going to be back in the grain
[47:44] the life is back into the seed back into
[47:46] the grain why to manifest itself back
[47:49] into Perfection back to the word again
[47:51] so it's all back to the word the word
[47:53] you can't get away from that it's back
[47:54] to the word yeah imperfection now only
[47:58] in this age could you come Perfection
[48:00] this is age of adoption no other age
[48:02] this age the age of adoption then he
[48:04] goes on to say but what denom what but
[48:08] what denominated he's talking about the
[48:10] hus the stalk the tassel and so forth
[48:11] but what denominated
[48:14] died why do you think the prophet of God
[48:16] preached Souls that are now in prison
[48:19] why do you think the prophet of God
[48:20] preach indictment all of those carriers
[48:23] they were good for their day but after
[48:26] the life left those carriers they
[48:29] died but what what denominated dies like
[48:32] Luther like I'm sorry like life in
[48:35] Luther went to make Wesley and from
[48:38] Wesley it went to Pentecost and from
[48:40] Pentecost to make the original seed on
[48:44] to Pentecost came out of Wesley until
[48:46] that time the reason that Pentecost came
[48:48] out of Wesley is because it was no
[48:50] denomination at first we know that
[48:52] Pentecost was then Pentecost went to
[48:55] denominate and what did it do it turned
[48:58] to the husk it looked like the real
[49:00] thing but it was not the real thing so
[49:03] now we're talking about life the life
[49:05] the life the life the life transfer from
[49:07] the hook to the stall and down to the
[49:09] tassel on on out to the seed the life so
[49:12] we're talking about that life and that
[49:13] life of course is symbolic of eternal
[49:15] life and this is the adoption Age The
[49:17] Bride age the placing of the sun this is
[49:19] a time of full maturity of the
[49:22] Bride so that's why if if we talk about
[49:26] uh this it's titled the Holy Ghost
[49:27] itself or you could say the Holy Ghost
[49:29] himself really the same thing doesn't
[49:31] really matter he he used to use the term
[49:33] Holy Ghost itself but brother BR says it
[49:35] 16 or 18 times both ways himself itself
[49:38] same thing so if we just would to ask
[49:41] what we're going to be speaking about
[49:42] some of these questions is what is the
[49:44] Holy Ghost itself or himself what what
[49:47] is this life and uh what life actually
[49:50] dies and we talk about even the
[49:53] scripture talks about even so shall it
[49:54] be when the son of man is revealed and
[49:56] and who is the son of man who is this
[49:58] Mighty angel that descended in
[49:59] Revelation 10:1 and some of these things
[50:02] if we could just we know what they are
[50:03] but if we could just get a little bit
[50:05] clearer picture of it would help us to I
[50:07] think a little bit to tie some of this
[50:09] together especially for this thought
[50:10] tonight now we're talking about the life
[50:12] now don't miss it the whole spoken whole
[50:14] Focus now is is of this analogy that I'm
[50:17] talking about beginning is the life now
[50:19] the life L the left the husk it left the
[50:22] stalk it left the tassel and all that
[50:26] life gathers into the seed okay where
[50:29] seed time Harvest Time maturity time uh
[50:32] adoption time it all gathered into the
[50:34] sea but what happens to all the other
[50:37] carriers they were all carriers they all
[50:39] died once that life left they all died
[50:42] they had their they were good for their
[50:44] day but they died because they
[50:47] denominated and and he you know but the
[50:50] but the original scene every so we ask
[50:52] the question now what condition was that
[50:54] life in the original scene the life in
[50:56] the Original Seed was perfect absolutely
[50:58] perfect perfect pure absolute and all
[51:01] God's seeds are perfect I remember a a
[51:05] statement that brother bisco made years
[51:07] and probably 25 30 35 years ago he said
[51:10] and it always stuck with me he said God
[51:12] cannot father an imperfect
[51:16] seed simple statement but it's so true
[51:20] God cannot father an imperfect seed
[51:23] everything God fathers is perfect
[51:25] everything in his creation perfect
[51:26] everything outside of that is just a
[51:28] perversion of what is perfect or what
[51:30] was made perfect so say it again God
[51:34] cannot father imperfect seed now
[51:36] remember it's more important to believe
[51:39] what the word says you are than what you
[51:41] believe you are
[51:43] yourself so if the Original Seed is
[51:45] perfect and the life that was in that
[51:47] seed was perfect and all that life was
[51:49] passed through the hook the hus the
[51:51] stalk and the tassel back into the seed
[51:53] again then I ask you a simple question
[51:56] what is condition of the seed that's the
[51:58] life that's in the seed now it's got to
[52:00] be perfect the same life it's got to be
[52:03] perfect because it's God's perfect life
[52:04] he don't hybrid it man did that so God's
[52:07] perfect seed word life it has to be back
[52:10] to the original life now brother B says
[52:14] in the token message therefore as the
[52:17] listen to what he says therefore as the
[52:18] evening Shadows are appearing and the
[52:20] Wrath is ready to be poured out on high
[52:22] we know that's the truth upon the
[52:24] ungodly Nations and upon the ungod L
[52:27] unbelievers upon the professors without
[52:29] a profession upon these things and I've
[52:31] tried to unfold myself and live right
[52:33] among it to see what where it was
[52:35] standing before I said these things now
[52:38] this in the token message now we are
[52:40] living in the shadows and the Wrath is
[52:42] ready to strike buddy there's ever been
[52:44] a time we could certainly say Amen to
[52:46] that the Wrath is ready to strike really
[52:49] really today he said the Wrath is ready
[52:52] to strike and God is requiring a token
[52:56] that you yourself have received his
[52:58] token the Holy Ghost it's the only way
[53:02] and the only sign that God will ever
[53:05] pass he's talking about passing over
[53:06] when you see that sign because it is the
[53:08] it is the literal life and we're talking
[53:13] about life passing from all these
[53:15] different carriers back into the seat
[53:17] itself it is the literal life of Jesus
[53:20] Christ returned back into the believer
[53:23] it is the literal life of Jesus Christ
[53:25] returned back back into the believer I'm
[53:28] going to say it a third time it is the
[53:30] literal life what does literal mean
[53:32] literal the literal life of Jesus Christ
[53:35] returned back into the believer it's
[53:37] more important you to believe what the
[53:39] word says you are than what you think
[53:41] you are yourself Satan is not going to
[53:43] be happy with you getting a revelation
[53:45] of what this quote just said he's not
[53:47] happy with that but you get a revelation
[53:50] of it I get a revelation of it the
[53:51] pastor got to have a revelation of it
[53:53] all the bride must have a revelation of
[53:55] who she is that she is that spoken word
[53:58] seed bride that he for ordained chose
[54:02] predestinated put in the Lamb's Book of
[54:04] Life and so forth and so on like that's
[54:06] that that statement the literal life of
[54:08] Jesus returned back into the
[54:11] believer because it is the literal life
[54:14] of Jesus Christ returned back into the
[54:16] believer now you you just hold that as
[54:18] we go that's why brother Bam could say
[54:21] all that God was he poured into Christ
[54:23] all that Christ was he p into the church
[54:27] the bride right Luther had a dip in the
[54:30] Holy Ghost Wesley had a dip in the Holy
[54:33] Ghost Pentecost the same had a dip in
[54:35] the Holy Ghost but the bride has the
[54:38] Holy Ghost himself now what does that
[54:40] mean let's go a little further see what
[54:42] does that really mean the Holy Ghost
[54:44] himself the person the man Christ in you
[54:48] the Christ is the word the full word
[54:50] made manifest for you by the new birth
[54:53] not just justification not just
[54:55] sanctification not just the baptism of
[54:57] Holy Ghost on your spirit realm but the
[55:00] Holy Ghost himself the person of the
[55:02] word himself there's only one person in
[55:04] the godhead that's Christ he's not a
[55:07] second person a third person he's the
[55:08] person he's a fullness of the godhead
[55:11] bodily he is God he's both God and man
[55:13] he's 100% man he's 100%
[55:16] God and you want to know really how
[55:18] important this is to have the the the
[55:21] true word birth let me read you this
[55:23] quote uh but you just they said boy they
[55:27] would they would tar and feather you
[55:29] right quick you listen what brother B
[55:31] said and Leadership 65 just a month
[55:35] before God took him home the choice of
[55:37] your conduct you could you can't mix it
[55:40] now you either for God or against God
[55:43] and the outward expression shows exactly
[55:45] what's on the inside the cucker now many
[55:48] of you think he said brother M said now
[55:49] many of you think I got the baptism of
[55:51] the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he
[55:53] said that don't mean one thing that
[55:55] you're going to heaven no sir you can
[55:57] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[55:58] hour of your life and still be lost and
[56:00] go to hell the Bible says so that's
[56:02] exactly right whoa you won't hear that
[56:05] anywhere outside of this
[56:07] message because we come to realize
[56:09] there's something beyond the baptism of
[56:11] the Holy Ghost that's true it was good
[56:13] for his time it's still good for I guess
[56:15] for whosoever will but for the bride got
[56:18] to come a little farther this is
[56:19] adoption this is full word time a little
[56:22] bit further down the road amen but see
[56:26] and another one the Rapture message
[56:27] brother man said you say 65 also you say
[56:31] I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[56:32] don't mean that you're saved not by a
[56:34] long ways look at here you're a triome
[56:36] being you are the inside little fellow
[56:38] here is a soul and next is a spirit and
[56:40] the next is a body and you got five
[56:41] senses of the body that contact your
[56:43] Earthly home they don't contact the rest
[56:45] of the you got the five senses of the
[56:47] spirit here love conscience and so forth
[56:49] here in the soul is where you live
[56:51] that's what you
[56:54] are that's the real you that's what you
[56:57] are and you know it's just like exactly
[57:00] what brother Sean was preaching on
[57:01] Sunday morning the church has the
[57:02] authority as of Christ he the church has
[57:06] the authority of Christ he's given that
[57:08] to us he's given us that Authority
[57:12] through the new birth through a word
[57:13] birth through a invisible Union the
[57:16] bride with Christ manifested the same
[57:18] life that he did in this day in this
[57:21] hour the church has that same Authority
[57:24] as Christ you may not recognize it you
[57:26] may not know how to use it but you have
[57:28] it potentially it's there The Authority
[57:31] has been granted but remember much of it
[57:33] just like the spoken word is sovereignly
[57:35] given God only gives it as you have need
[57:37] of it amen Christ gave the church that
[57:41] Authority because it's his life In You
[57:43] by the new birth remember the prophet of
[57:47] God said your bone of his bone flesh of
[57:49] his flesh life of his life what's the
[57:50] next three
[57:52] words she is him
[57:57] that's right now you hold on three those
[57:58] three words because we're going to
[57:59] parallel that with something else in a
[58:01] few minutes she is him amen now you know
[58:07] I are y'all you believe that I mean
[58:10] really you believe that you believe that
[58:14] I believe that she is
[58:17] him by the end of the service you're
[58:19] going to believe that I believe it I
[58:20] believe you believe it now but I want it
[58:22] to go from here all the way down to
[58:25] Revelation your heart
[58:26] I'm one of them I don't care if there's
[58:28] just one coming out of Virginia I'm one
[58:30] of them y'all better y'all better move
[58:31] cuz I'm going I mean that's that's the
[58:34] Revelation you got to have you got to
[58:36] have that
[58:37] Revelation amen
[58:39] so bone of his bone and flesh ofish
[58:42] flesh life of it life we talking about
[58:44] life earlier going from this the shook I
[58:47] mean from the the the the stalk the
[58:49] tassel sh and everything into the seed
[58:51] we're talking about that life she is him
[58:54] it's his life in you now let's look at
[58:56] this life his life in us from just a
[58:58] little bit different angle now we know
[59:00] that God's perfected in threes
[59:02] justification sanctification baptism the
[59:04] Holy Ghost water blood spirit I'm just
[59:06] going to list a few of them uh God above
[59:08] us God With Us and God in us outer Court
[59:10] inner Court holies of holies Eagle lamb
[59:13] blind father son Holy Ghost and on and
[59:15] on and on okay that's good and we
[59:18] believe that 100% God's perfecting in
[59:20] three but what about the number
[59:23] four yeah what about the number four
[59:26] where does that come in God's numerology
[59:27] is always perfect what is the number
[59:30] four okay the four is Deliverance now
[59:32] let's look at this just a minute baptism
[59:35] of Holy Ghost made way for the Holy
[59:37] Ghost himself that's four three sons
[59:39] names son of man Son of God Son of David
[59:43] okay that's that's exactly those three
[59:45] but that's not but it's not complete yet
[59:47] right listen to this as we will know you
[59:50] know I'm just I'm covering some some
[59:53] some some thoughts here verification
[59:55] thoughts brother man said do God Chang
[59:57] his mind now Jesus came in three names
[59:59] son of man which is a prophet Son of God
[1:00:02] which went through the church ages son
[1:00:03] of David but in between the Son of God
[1:00:06] and son of
[1:00:08] man according to his own word and
[1:00:10] according to Malachi 4 and many
[1:00:12] scriptures he's to return back into his
[1:00:15] church in physical form in the people in
[1:00:19] human beings in the way of being a

[1:01:50] Malachi
[1:01:51] 4 there's an answer for that I know you

[1:03:18] is four four is Deliverance Fourth Man
[1:03:20] in fire four days Lazarus been in the
[1:03:24] grave four okay you see now you can see
[1:03:27] why the Masterpiece brother man said the
[1:03:30] Masterpiece the Holy Ghost the baptism
[1:03:31] of the Holy Ghost made way three made
[1:03:34] way for the Holy Ghost himself four our
[1:03:37] day adoption full maturity
[1:03:40] everything now let's stop here just for
[1:03:43] a minute but I want to you know
[1:03:47] what let me let me get this quoted here
[1:03:50] first he said do you get it amen for God
[1:03:52] said I will restore he's going to
[1:03:53] restore by how four death Messengers you
[1:03:57] killed it and then four life Meers
[1:03:58] Messengers will restor it what was at
[1:04:00] first Martin Luther justification what
[1:04:02] was the second John Wesley by
[1:04:04] sanctification what was the third
[1:04:05] Pentecost with the restoration of gifts
[1:04:07] and the Holy Ghost he said the
[1:04:09] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[1:04:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the
[1:04:13] fourth the
[1:04:15] word see there again he's going back to
[1:04:18] Pentecost justifications satification
[1:04:20] baptism Holy Ghost but there's one more
[1:04:22] what is it the
[1:04:23] word the word now now you see why the
[1:04:26] master and he said the Masterpiece that
[1:04:28] the the baptism the Holy Ghost made way
[1:04:30] for the Holy Ghost itself
[1:04:32] now we cannot go back to the anointing
[1:04:36] the Pentecostal anointing just the
[1:04:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your spirit
[1:04:40] realm with the restoration gifts that's
[1:04:42] incomplete as as we just read uh we
[1:04:45] we've got to have present day truth the
[1:04:47] fourth messenger of life to restore the
[1:04:49] bride tree back the word and we've read
[1:04:52] this quote before and you're familiar
[1:04:53] with it but I want to touch on it here
[1:04:55] but brother man said the word that fell
[1:04:56] on the day of Pentecost will not work
[1:04:58] this day now listen how he says it and
[1:05:00] listen what he says he said will not
[1:05:03] work this day no sir that was for
[1:05:05] Pentecost this is for the bride the
[1:05:07] going home of the Bride we got something
[1:05:10] different the Pentecostals represented
[1:05:13] that again now read the rest of it read
[1:05:16] all the quote there we're in the bride
[1:05:18] age no more than a word of Noah would
[1:05:20] work for these for the days of of Moses
[1:05:22] no more than Moses law would work in the
[1:05:24] time of Paul he tried to tell them you
[1:05:26] are dead to that you cannot have that
[1:05:29] okay now he also goes on to say in the
[1:05:31] brid Tre continue on with this thought
[1:05:34] there's four great prophets one of them
[1:05:36] Martin Luther now this is really really
[1:05:38] I just love this there's four great
[1:05:40] prophets Martin Luther began to shine a
[1:05:43] light now we know he's a reformer but
[1:05:44] he's calling them prophets you know it
[1:05:46] was a little light just a very small
[1:05:48] strength of justification long came
[1:05:50] Wesley stronger sanctification after
[1:05:53] Wesley was stronger than him Pentecostal
[1:05:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost another
[1:05:57] great prophet see but it but in the last
[1:06:00] days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with
[1:06:05] the very
[1:06:08] word so he's he's just saying again
[1:06:11] trying to elaborate on that the word
[1:06:13] that fell on the Pentecost he said the
[1:06:15] Pentecost represented that again we've
[1:06:16] got something different he's trying to
[1:06:18] tell them you know that that that but in
[1:06:21] the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to
[1:06:23] come with the very word the word of the
[1:06:26] Lord came to a prophet and the even last
[1:06:28] it is to come forth and restore and
[1:06:29] bring back what turn the hearts of the
[1:06:32] children back to the faith of the
[1:06:34] father's the fourth
[1:06:37] light you see when you really think
[1:06:39] about that when really think about what
[1:06:41] what did Malachi 4 say turn the heart of
[1:06:43] the fathers your children that was John
[1:06:45] the Baptist and the children back to the
[1:06:46] fathers the faith turn to Faith or the
[1:06:49] heart really speaking about the faith so
[1:06:51] our faith is turned back to the
[1:06:52] Pentecostal fathers not the the Manifest
[1:06:55] station of tongues interpretation of
[1:06:57] Prophecy and all the gifts like it was
[1:06:58] restored in Pentecost but return back to
[1:07:00] the faith they did have the faith they
[1:07:02] had Resurrection faith it was God living
[1:07:04] in them God above us now God in them
[1:07:07] they had the
[1:07:09] faith they had the faith so he said this
[1:07:11] fourth light messenger William brand
[1:07:15] might as well say it turn the hearts of
[1:07:17] the children back to the faith of the
[1:07:18] fathers of fourth light for is
[1:07:20] Deliverance again a little bit farther
[1:07:23] restoration of Bri tree four Killers
[1:07:25] took took it four Messengers destroyed
[1:07:28] it four messengers of death took it away
[1:07:31] in dogmas four messengers of
[1:07:33] righteousness restore it back again then
[1:07:35] he says prophesy then we get to Ezekiel
[1:07:38] 37 Dry Bones he says prophesy son of man
[1:07:41] can these bones live wish we had time we
[1:07:43] got it wrote down here but I have to
[1:07:45] miss that prophesy can these bones live
[1:07:48] what is the four stages of the coming
[1:07:50] forth of that church what was the four
[1:07:52] stages of e ezekiel's dry bones we don't
[1:07:55] have time to go through that but you go
[1:07:56] read the the three stages the senu the
[1:07:58] and the the bones the Senus and the skin
[1:08:01] so forth like that but there was no life
[1:08:02] in it then he said prophesy son of me
[1:08:05] that the wind would blow the fourth one
[1:08:07] the fourth one brought the life we're
[1:08:10] talking about the life the fourth one
[1:08:12] brought the life the life is only back
[1:08:14] in the seed now the carriers is dead the
[1:08:18] carriers has no life in them that's why
[1:08:20] that's why brother BR said I well I
[1:08:22] don't want to get ahead of myself but
[1:08:23] the life only come not when the senu
[1:08:27] skin was on them but when the wind
[1:08:29] blowed upon them that's when it come
[1:08:31] back that fourth messenger of life was
[1:08:33] brought it back I will restore sayith
[1:08:35] the Lord hallelujah Glory praise God
[1:08:38] Amen that's why the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:40] Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[1:08:42] himself in Ezekiel 37 you don't have to
[1:08:44] turn to it in verse 8 it said and when I
[1:08:47] beheld lo the Senus and the flesh Came
[1:08:49] Upon them and the skin covered them
[1:08:51] above but there was no breath in them
[1:08:55] the next verse says then said unto me
[1:08:57] prophesy unto the when prophesy son of
[1:09:00] man son of man Ezekiel now Ezekiel is a
[1:09:03] prophet and I don't and I've got it all
[1:09:06] wrote out but I do not have time to go
[1:09:07] to it but what the origin of the son of
[1:09:09] man how it got started son of man what
[1:09:11] what was referred to back in the early
[1:09:13] days Ezekiel is used probably more 80 85
[1:09:17] times he was a that title was referred
[1:09:20] to him more than any of the other
[1:09:21] prophets and of course Jesus only
[1:09:23] referred to himself as son of man always
[1:09:26] I'm the son of man son of man of course
[1:09:27] he did you know the son of man he never
[1:09:30] said that it was Son of God the actually
[1:09:32] the only time Jesus ever really actually
[1:09:34] told who he was as brother R said was St
[1:09:37] John 4 the woman in the well said we we
[1:09:40] believe you know that the the Messiah is
[1:09:41] going to come and brother B said I am
[1:09:43] brother man said about Christ saying I
[1:09:45] am he that's the only time he ever
[1:09:47] devoted that he had he admitted he was
[1:09:50] that Messiah but other than that you
[1:09:51] know and that's one of the reasons that
[1:09:53] he used the son of man because son of
[1:09:55] man Man actually come well we won't we
[1:09:58] won't get in that cuz we don't have time
[1:09:59] for that but it's not really important
[1:10:01] what the origin of that son of man
[1:10:03] actually is and he says oh and he says
[1:10:06] prophesy unto the wind oh son of man and
[1:10:09] say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God
[1:10:11] come for the war Four Winds o breath and
[1:10:14] breathe upon these slain that ye may
[1:10:17] live what do we have in this day the
[1:10:19] revealing of the son of man the
[1:10:22] revealing of the son of man uh listen
[1:10:24] friends that's what a tremendous
[1:10:26] prophecy now not only is that Ezekiel 37
[1:10:29] a prophecy of Israel to be restored if
[1:10:31] you go read Ezekiel 37 it's a total
[1:10:33] restorative Israel she'll be reborn
[1:10:35] again she'll rise up stand on her feet
[1:10:37] be a great Army so forth so on but
[1:10:39] brother man said that's also the rebirth
[1:10:40] and restoration of the brid tree uh in
[1:10:43] the evening time the bride tree being
[1:10:45] restored that's uh as he said most
[1:10:48] scriptures have a compound meeting it
[1:10:49] certainly does apply today because the
[1:10:51] brid tree has been restored goes on to
[1:10:54] say in the restoration of the brid tree
[1:10:56] the fourth light is to come that will
[1:10:59] bring the same signs watch justification
[1:11:01] brought back to pulpe sanctification
[1:11:03] brought back to Bar the doctrine of
[1:11:05] Holiness what brought back the Lea
[1:11:07] Pentecost what is it Pentecostal leaves
[1:11:09] claps their hands Joy rejoicing
[1:11:10] Pentecost what then the fourth the
[1:11:13] fourth the fourth was the word itself
[1:11:17] yes now we're talking about the Holy
[1:11:18] Ghost himself okay follow me now the
[1:11:22] Holy Ghost himself he said what was the
[1:11:24] fourth the word is self the word made
[1:11:28] flesh never never been a generation like
[1:11:31] we have today that that bride member uh
[1:11:35] uh redeemed saints of God is actually
[1:11:38] fleshing out this word if you want to
[1:11:40] say it that way the word being made
[1:11:43] flesh God's word manifested in your
[1:11:47] flesh amen oh man what what a day we're
[1:11:50] living in what a tremendous day we in
[1:11:53] living in the word itself say the word
[1:11:55] made flesh again in Bride tree first
[1:11:58] line justification sanctification
[1:12:00] baptism Holy Ghost and then there again
[1:12:02] again he says then coming of the cap now
[1:12:06] we have a something a little to look at
[1:12:09] now after justification sanctification
[1:12:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost then coming
[1:12:14] the cap now we can take time but we're
[1:12:16] not going to do it but go back to uh s
[1:12:19] what is the time Junior Jackson's dream
[1:12:21] took that crowbar uh pull that broke the
[1:12:24] top that mountain back you know and
[1:12:26] pulled off what was that white Gran he
[1:12:28] said light has never shown upon this
[1:12:30] writing before and you know we know we
[1:12:32] know the story there but he said now you
[1:12:34] got to go west get the interpretation of
[1:12:36] that Unwritten word that's you know
[1:12:38] that's written uh this the light is
[1:12:41] never shown upon before a different day
[1:12:43] a total different day we're living in
[1:12:46] amen Danny says then the coming cap what
[1:12:48] is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed
[1:12:52] out he talking about his bride members
[1:12:53] now that fourth light restoring back
[1:12:57] Christ in this bride what is that the
[1:12:59] Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that
[1:13:02] it can fit with the same kind of
[1:13:04] ministry he had when he went away right
[1:13:06] the same kind of ministry he had when he
[1:13:08] went away so the same Ministry he had
[1:13:10] when he went away is got to be in the
[1:13:11] bride when he come
[1:13:13] back we're not talking about everybody's
[1:13:15] got to preach the gospel and signs and
[1:13:17] wonders and raise the dead and explosion
[1:13:20] all like that he's talking about the
[1:13:21] word being made flesh in you whatever
[1:13:23] our your calling is that's the word me
[1:13:25] and flesh for you if you stay true to
[1:13:27] the present day
[1:13:29] truth that's that's fleshing out the
[1:13:31] word for this day living the life living
[1:13:34] the life the life his life the literal
[1:13:37] life living in you whatever your calling
[1:13:39] is comes back he said and he says what
[1:13:43] is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being H out
[1:13:45] so it can fit with the same kind of
[1:13:47] ministry he had when he went away that
[1:13:49] when he come back it'll catch the whole
[1:13:51] thing in a
[1:13:53] Rapture now what did brother man say was
[1:13:56] the Capstone Revelation what is the
[1:13:58] Capstone Revelation see the the Supreme
[1:14:01] deity of Jesus Christ he is God not a
[1:14:04] second person the person he's God
[1:14:06] himself God in flesh he's 100% God and
[1:14:09] he was 100% man the whole mystery of the
[1:14:13] New Testament who W who was who was that
[1:14:16] MDC why did Brother BR when he preach
[1:14:19] who is this mzc why didn't he say who
[1:14:21] was that mzc why did he say who is this
[1:14:24] mzc
[1:14:25] because that power of vend this life is
[1:14:27] for our day not back then Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] become mesic but that's the day that's
[1:14:33] the life for our day the power of an
[1:14:35] endless life it's all about eternal life
[1:14:38] now Capstone Revelation Supreme deity of
[1:14:42] Christ Christ is the Capstone The
[1:14:44] Headstone now you you you have to uh the
[1:14:48] bride has to be honed out with the same
[1:14:50] Ministry to fit that Capstone so these
[1:14:53] two must be one they can only be one one
[1:14:55] by a word birth and that fourth light
[1:14:58] came to blow that fourth wind into the
[1:15:00] bride so that now these are my words but
[1:15:02] I just wrote it down fourth wind into
[1:15:05] the bride so that those dry bones that
[1:15:07] were dead in denominational dog could
[1:15:09] stand up on her feet now the seals of
[1:15:12] death taken off of her those Dry Bones
[1:15:14] resurrected now the prophet adopted with
[1:15:16] a sword in his hand and the bride
[1:15:17] adopted with the son of man when the son
[1:15:20] of man put that sword word in her heart
[1:15:22] oh brother what a resurrection this is
[1:15:24] he said what a resurrection that was I
[1:15:27] he said what a resurrection this is
[1:15:29] there has been a resurrection in our day
[1:15:32] resurrected what how what was the reur
[1:15:35] Resurrection Day resurrected out of
[1:15:37] those dead denominational system Luther
[1:15:39] was good Wesley is good Pentecost was
[1:15:41] good but the once the life left that
[1:15:43] system he said when they denominated
[1:15:45] that's why they died now the life is in
[1:15:49] the Grain in the seed not in the shuck
[1:15:51] anymore not in the tassel anymore but in
[1:15:54] the seed
[1:15:56] in the seed that's where we are now he
[1:15:59] brother man said visible Union we know
[1:16:01] that the church could not the
[1:16:02] Pentecostal Church by no means by no
[1:16:04] means could carry out the last day
[1:16:06] message message in his present condition
[1:16:09] Congress says no it could not why why
[1:16:12] they can't even GRE on one or two words
[1:16:13] in the Bible how you going to do he
[1:16:15] can't do it see your denomination out
[1:16:17] that's right it's going to be it's going
[1:16:19] to be an elected people that's elected
[1:16:21] for it what did he say to church a book
[1:16:24] he said there got to be a special
[1:16:26] designated people amen a special
[1:16:28] designated people to receive that it's
[1:16:30] got to be a prophetic class of
[1:16:32] people now know and so do every one of
[1:16:36] us know that the whole listen now know
[1:16:38] and so do every one of us know that the
[1:16:40] whole rank of denominations Pentecost
[1:16:42] and all are dead that is to the born
[1:16:44] again Christian message of the born
[1:16:47] again Christian of the message uhhuh he
[1:16:48] said your first husband is dead I don't
[1:16:53] care if our first husband was the world
[1:16:55] if our first husband was a denomination
[1:16:57] it's dead you know it's dead God let it
[1:17:00] die God let it die then after you
[1:17:03] recognize the very word of God was Eagle
[1:17:06] food
[1:17:08] then oh I just love it then when you
[1:17:11] recognize the word of God was Eagle food
[1:17:13] then you left the other thing you have
[1:17:16] then been formed into the living image
[1:17:18] of the Living God you heard from
[1:17:22] your that word body you heard from your
[1:17:26] theophany when you received that listen
[1:17:28] to it believed it caught that Revelation
[1:17:31] you heard from your theophany invisible
[1:17:33] Union again and we read this but I've
[1:17:35] got to cover this and go a little bit
[1:17:37] farther you're standing completely never
[1:17:39] sin in the first place how many believe
[1:17:41] that amen did you ever did you ever sin
[1:17:44] did you ever sin in this life sure you
[1:17:46] did but he said you never sin in the
[1:17:48] first place and I asked you the question
[1:17:49] where was the first place right he said
[1:17:51] you never stand in the first place did
[1:17:54] Adam ever sin in the first place before
[1:17:56] the garden of before the Fall In the
[1:17:58] Garden of Eden the first place was that
[1:18:00] eden-like condition or that Eden
[1:18:02] condition before sin ever come to the
[1:18:04] picture that's before even the
[1:18:06] foundation world when our names were put
[1:18:08] on the Lamb's Book of Life amen that was
[1:18:10] the first place you didn't sin before
[1:18:12] the foundation of the world you didn't
[1:18:14] sin when God saw you as a perfect
[1:18:16] redeemed Son of God you only came down
[1:18:19] this life you bypass your copy come down
[1:18:21] this life to be tested tried put through
[1:18:23] all this and this pest house that we
[1:18:25] live in yes we've sin we've made mistake
[1:18:27] done all kinds of things like that but
[1:18:29] God does not as brother CH said Son
[1:18:31] blessed is a man whom God does not
[1:18:33] reckon
[1:18:34] sin read first John again a man that's
[1:18:37] born of God cannot sin because his seed
[1:18:39] remaineth in him for he cannot sin why
[1:18:43] why can't he sin because God's seed lays
[1:18:45] in that man continually forever amen it
[1:18:49] was dormant for years but now it's come
[1:18:51] to
[1:18:52] life amen oh I just love it
[1:18:55] yes Glory praise the
[1:18:58] Lord oh you're just completely you never
[1:19:01] he said you never did it you were
[1:19:03] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:19:05] from the beginning you are predestinated
[1:19:08] to be a son or daughter of God you're
[1:19:09] standing here washed and your old book
[1:19:11] of divorcement is put away it's dead
[1:19:14] absolutely out of the existence even in
[1:19:16] the mind of God you're The Virtuous
[1:19:18] bride of Christ washed in the blood of
[1:19:20] Christ precious ver you know there's not
[1:19:23] there's not a piece of poetry anywhere
[1:19:25] is as beautiful as this invisible Union
[1:19:27] there's not a poetry there's not there's
[1:19:28] nothing that's as beautiful as this
[1:19:30] quotation out of visible Union it's not
[1:19:32] written
[1:19:34] anywhere you're The Virtuous bride of
[1:19:37] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[1:19:38] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[1:19:41] standing with a pure unadulterated bride

[1:19:49] just love you Washed by the Water of his
[1:19:51] own blood that become flesh and
[1:19:53] manifested that he
[1:19:55] take you which were predestinated in the
[1:19:57] bosom of the father before the beginning
[1:19:59] the same that he was he was that great
[1:20:02] attribute of God Called Love Now next qu
[1:20:06] the next quote is one of the most
[1:20:07] favorite quotes in this whole message
[1:20:10] bridegroom tree and bride
[1:20:14] tree taking out restoration bride tree
[1:20:17] but
[1:20:18] watch he Christ was God's perfect
[1:20:22] Prophet tree the example tree remember
[1:20:24] Christ was a prophet but he was a god
[1:20:26] prophet he was God's perfect Prophet
[1:20:28] tree the example tree the bridegroom
[1:20:31] tree amen glory I'm going to say
[1:20:34] something directly he says it right now
[1:20:36] if he is a bridegroom tree you believe
[1:20:38] it from the Garden of Eden then the
[1:20:42] bridegroom tree without the female don't
[1:20:46] bear
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:49] fruit I just love it I just love it the
[1:20:52] bridegroom tree without the female don't
[1:20:55] bear fruit that's right what did what
[1:20:58] what's since the fall God's desire was
[1:21:01] to be able to even back in the beginning
[1:21:05] multiply and replenish the Earth spoken
[1:21:07] word children spoken word children
[1:21:09] spoken word children not through sex
[1:21:11] spoken word children God wanted God had
[1:21:13] a created Son of God Adam he wanted to
[1:21:16] Adam to replenish the Earth and be more
[1:21:18] Sons like Adam more Sons like Adam
[1:21:20] daughters like Adam's nature was he was
[1:21:22] both masculine f femish so for spoken
[1:21:25] word
[1:21:26] children so the bridegroom tree without
[1:21:30] the bride tree cannot produce fruit you
[1:21:34] believe that from the Garden of Eden
[1:21:36] then the bridegroom tree without the
[1:21:38] female don't bear fruit so he he's got
[1:21:41] to have a brid
[1:21:44] tree that's right he's got to have a
[1:21:48] brid tree see God don't need me God
[1:21:51] needs you he's got to have a brid tree
[1:21:54] tree the bridegroom tree without the
[1:21:56] brid tree cannot produce fruit how is
[1:21:59] God going to reproduce himself without a
[1:22:01] bride without a female to to to to to
[1:22:04] bring The Offspring of bringing sons of
[1:22:06] God it's got to be a brid
[1:22:10] tree to have Union with a bridegroom
[1:22:12] tree so he's got to have a brid tree
[1:22:15] she's got to be listen what she's got to
[1:22:17] be she's got to be born of the same
[1:22:21] material that's why we're talking about
[1:22:23] baptism of the the Holy Ghost made way
[1:22:25] for the Holy Ghost himself what is it
[1:22:27] what is the token the literal life of
[1:22:29] Jesus Christ back in the Bri believer
[1:22:32] himself got to be born of the same
[1:22:35] material the word made flesh from the
[1:22:37] tree said I hope you get it I hope you
[1:22:41] get it from the tree I hope you get it
[1:22:42] see the same life remember we talked
[1:22:45] about it in the beginning the life in
[1:22:46] the the the the hus the shook the tassel
[1:22:49] so forth now is in the seed he said that
[1:22:51] but it was all correct life it was all
[1:22:53] correct life going through those those
[1:22:55] carriers but it that original life is
[1:22:57] now in the seed he said that same life
[1:23:00] is in the female tree the bridegroom as
[1:23:03] it is in the
[1:23:05] bride The Works that I do so you do so
[1:23:08] you do also is that right he was a
[1:23:10] bridegroom oh man we can just stop right
[1:23:13] here say thank you God I'm glad there
[1:23:15] was a bridegroom tree I'm glad there's a
[1:23:17] bride tree I'm part of it the union of
[1:23:19] the bridegroom tree with the bridegroom
[1:23:21] is going to bring produce fruit amen so
[1:23:25] you see the brid tree is born of the
[1:23:27] same material it's a word made flesh and
[1:23:29] she has the same life as he has
[1:23:32] therefore she is him she's got to be
[1:23:36] born of the same material made of the
[1:23:38] the same material that he is that's why
[1:23:40] the prophet God said say in the M spe
[1:23:42] she is him she's word of his word bone
[1:23:44] of his bone word of his word life of his
[1:23:46] life she is
[1:23:49] him that's what's the matter today going
[1:23:51] on saying Be not Afraid 2 Psalm 63 we
[1:23:54] just just take them in a confession
[1:23:55] instead of taking them on to receive
[1:23:58] Christ till they're born of the spirit
[1:24:00] of God that's what we need today is them
[1:24:02] all night meetings not just saying I
[1:24:03] believe in all of our things we do I
[1:24:05] believe in shouting believe in speaking
[1:24:06] tongues I believe in interpretation
[1:24:07] tongues I believe in Divine I believe in
[1:24:09] all those things but yet it's something
[1:24:12] he said it's something yet it's
[1:24:14] something better than that it's a birth
[1:24:16] itself it's the Holy Ghost itself coming
[1:24:19] in us the Holy Ghost itself coming in US
[1:24:25] not just the manifestation not just the
[1:24:26] sensation not just all these wonderful
[1:24:29] things it was all good back in Pentecost
[1:24:31] but he said that's we got something
[1:24:33] better than that it's a birth it's the
[1:24:34] Holy Ghost itself coming in us
[1:24:37] hallelujah to God
[1:24:41] Amen ain't nobody tired yet of
[1:24:46] there I've just got just a little bit
[1:24:48] more yeah I'm not going to say I'm
[1:24:50] closing so just forget it I'm not going
[1:24:51] to say I'm closing CU my wife she I just
[1:24:54] can't stand the preacher get up there
[1:24:56] and say I'm going to be closing I'm
[1:24:57] closing I'm closing I'm closing I'm
[1:25:00] closing 30 minutes later I'm closing I
[1:25:02] ain't going to say
[1:25:04] it the Holy Ghost itself coming in us
[1:25:08] the fullness of the deity of Christ is
[1:25:10] here another thing he said the son of
[1:25:13] man the Holy Ghost
[1:25:15] itself what did he do for us in our
[1:25:17] generation John was told up to come up
[1:25:20] higher representing the bride we all in
[1:25:21] Le Osa we steeped in Den ninal he and or
[1:25:26] just was just plain loss one or the
[1:25:27] other no wonder the prophet could say
[1:25:29] what a resurrection that was what a
[1:25:31] resurrection this is amen and this time
[1:25:34] he came down to lift us up God came down
[1:25:36] to lift us up yeah let me just uh this
[1:25:41] is this is really interesting because I
[1:25:42] want to bring this to you he came you
[1:25:44] know John was told to come up higher so
[1:25:46] we have to come up higher we have to
[1:25:47] even come up higher than even when we
[1:25:49] were obviously back in the world but
[1:25:50] even coming out of denomination we got
[1:25:52] to come up higher because we have to be
[1:25:53] made of the same material that he was so
[1:25:55] we got to come up higher so I like this
[1:25:59] analogy here and elzar found Isaac a
[1:26:02] bride but it was Isaac who took the
[1:26:04] lovely Brecker into the tent to fulfill
[1:26:06] and consumate the marriage relationship
[1:26:08] now our marriage with the Lord Jesus uh
[1:26:11] gave us a resurrection so it gave us new
[1:26:14] life amen there had to be an invisible
[1:26:16] usion with our mate the reveal word we
[1:26:18] had a resurrection resurrected out out
[1:26:20] of those dead denominations like any
[1:26:22] Resurrection there got to be a death
[1:26:23] first
[1:26:25] but by having received the seed genene
[1:26:27] from God God put that seed in our heart
[1:26:29] it was dormant for years but he placed
[1:26:30] that there we were born with it put it
[1:26:32] in there really from the foundation
[1:26:33] where we was born with it but yet it was
[1:26:35] dormant for all these years but our
[1:26:36] marriage to the Lord Jesus Christ uh um
[1:26:41] the status of this bride certainly we
[1:26:42] needed to be elevated even we was back
[1:26:44] in in denomination we needed to be
[1:26:46] elevated so what did he do so look at
[1:26:49] listen to this here's some types in the
[1:26:51] Bible now you take the Harlot Rahab she
[1:26:54] was was married to a Jewish General by
[1:26:56] the name of Salon okay the Harlot Rahab
[1:26:59] they had a son his name was Boaz now
[1:27:02] what happened Rahab actually she got
[1:27:05] elevated because she married this uh
[1:27:07] Jewish General okay you take Ruth a
[1:27:09] moabit the descendant of lot she married
[1:27:12] Boaz she was elevated you take Gomer the
[1:27:16] Harlot and she married the prophet Hosea
[1:27:19] she was elevated you take zavor zapor
[1:27:21] even an Egyptian she married the prophet
[1:27:23] Moses was a concubine wife but still you
[1:27:26] know and tried to have a God said go
[1:27:27] ahead have but it wasn't his perfect
[1:27:29] will so all of these women they they
[1:27:31] were elevated because they were married
[1:27:33] to this special
[1:27:35] person amen and we were of less agree
[1:27:39] and we needed the same status we needed
[1:27:40] our status to be changed and elevated
[1:27:43] brother I like this in Titus going to
[1:27:45] read that and then we'll go on to
[1:27:46] something else just in a minute in Titus
[1:27:49] 3 and
[1:27:51] three uh it's really good said for we
[1:27:53] ourselves were this what we used to be
[1:27:56] before for we ourselves were sometimes
[1:27:58] foolish disobedient
[1:28:00] deceiving serving diverse lust Pleasures
[1:28:03] living in Malice and envy hateful and
[1:28:05] hating one another but after that
[1:28:07] kindness and love of God our savior
[1:28:09] toward man appeared not by works of
[1:28:11] righteous which we have done but
[1:28:12] according to his Mercy he saved us by
[1:28:14] the washing of regeneration and the
[1:28:16] renewing of the Holy
[1:28:19] Ghost Paul says and I I'm going to read
[1:28:22] this out of the emphatic diaglog when
[1:28:23] you really read some of these words here
[1:28:26] we were foolish disobedient deceived
[1:28:29] serving divver lust Pleasures living in
[1:28:32] Pleasures living in Malice and envy
[1:28:34] hateful and hating one another that's
[1:28:36] what we were yeah that's what he said
[1:28:38] yeah if you read it at the original
[1:28:40] Greek it says we for we ourselves also
[1:28:43] were formerly
[1:28:46] senseless we were senseless that's the
[1:28:49] original Greek we were
[1:28:51] disobedient we were airing being in bond
[1:28:54] to various inordinate desires and
[1:28:56] Pleasures living in Malice and envy
[1:28:59] detestable and hating each other boy we
[1:29:02] was in bad shape we needed to come up
[1:29:04] higher we really needed to come up
[1:29:06] higher but you know God made a way that
[1:29:09] we could come up
[1:29:10] higher oh what a tremendous truth
[1:29:13] brother bam after the seal was open he
[1:29:15] said my minute listen we got to we going
[1:29:18] to find a place to wind down my Ministry
[1:29:20] on Earth is to declare that he is here
[1:29:25] he is here now I'm going to parallel
[1:29:27] this with that other three words in just
[1:29:29] a second we have the return of the pill
[1:29:31] of fire 1950 the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost
[1:29:35] himself just pass him some thoughts here
[1:29:37] the son of man has been revealed the son
[1:29:39] of man revealing a son of man revealing
[1:29:41] the son of man these are all familiar to
[1:29:44] though brother man says he's my Ministry
[1:29:46] is to clothe the bride with the word
[1:29:48] there had to be an adoption of the
[1:29:49] Prophet the first sheave like listen to
[1:29:52] this I I just love this nothing happens
[1:29:54] by by coincidence like in
[1:29:57] Transfiguration Jesus was adop adopted
[1:29:59] there a cloud appeared three Witnesses
[1:30:01] Peter James and John okay realize
[1:30:04] brother R was adopted too out in two son
[1:30:06] 1963 during that same time a sword came
[1:30:08] in his hand three three Witnesses were
[1:30:11] out there brother random and two other
[1:30:14] persons you ever thought about that what
[1:30:16] their name are Jean
[1:30:19] Norman Fred
[1:30:20] sofman remember this is a son of man
[1:30:23] Ministry son of man Ministry what's the
[1:30:25] last name of both of those Brothers Jean
[1:30:28] Norman Norman n o r m an Fred sof man
[1:30:32] now you say that's coincidental I don't
[1:30:34] say that's coincidental three Witnesses
[1:30:36] just like when he was adopted just like
[1:30:38] when Jesus adopted three was a witness
[1:30:39] there you had brother brandom which was
[1:30:42] even brother Brand's own name branam Ham
[1:30:45] means father of Nations which he was a a
[1:30:47] spiritual father of this whole bride so
[1:30:49] to speak him Jean
[1:30:52] Norman Fred off man the son of man
[1:30:55] ministering this day the son of man
[1:30:57] appearing in a cloud a cloud Luke 21:27
[1:31:01] it ain't by coincidence aren't you glad
[1:31:03] God is perfect in all that he does am
[1:31:06] now you say well what does that mean
[1:31:07] well it just means God's perfect his
[1:31:09] name his numbers is right his numerology
[1:31:11] is Right amen I don't think it's
[1:31:13] coincidence what else declaring that he
[1:31:15] is here declaring that he's here the
[1:31:18] indictment brother B said I indict this
[1:31:21] generation in the presence of the judge
[1:31:24] showing that he's here Isaiah 61 rise
[1:31:27] and shine and the glory of the Lord has
[1:31:29] risen upon thee remember brother man
[1:31:31] said God ain't going to show us share
[1:31:32] his glory with anybody that's true but
[1:31:35] you got to remember there's several
[1:31:36] types of Glory there is one Glory that
[1:31:39] God is sharing with his bride that is
[1:31:42] Oneness because he said he the only the
[1:31:45] only request that Jesus ever requested
[1:31:48] of himself he said I will that father
[1:31:51] that where I am there they might be also
[1:31:53] that's the only thing Jesus ever desired
[1:31:55] he asked of the father one thing that
[1:31:57] where I am there my people will be
[1:32:01] also so don't forget these three words
[1:32:03] he is here now he is here and I want to
[1:32:07] call your attention to the other words
[1:32:09] she is
[1:32:10] him remember now she is the matching
[1:32:13] piece to the
[1:32:15] Masterpiece okay we getting real close
[1:32:18] now brothers and sisters real close now
[1:32:22] these next few thoughts only scratch
[1:32:24] scratch the service but I hope it's
[1:32:27] helped us a little understand a little
[1:32:28] bit more about the Holy Ghost
[1:32:30] himself first Thessalonians 4:16
[1:32:34] 4:14 remember I'm talking about these
[1:32:37] two scriptures he is here she is
[1:32:40] him for if we believe that Jesus 1
[1:32:43] Thessalonians 4:14 for if we believe
[1:32:45] that Jesus dies and rose again even so
[1:32:48] them also which sleep with Jesus God
[1:32:50] will bring with him know you're familiar
[1:32:52] with these scriptures but I hope you
[1:32:55] catch this I know you will for this we
[1:32:57] say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:32:59] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:33:01] the come to the Lord shall not prevent
[1:33:03] them which are asleep now brother says
[1:33:05] hinder which it does mean hinder prevent
[1:33:07] or hinder but actually uh a more clear
[1:33:10] understanding was is that actually the
[1:33:12] rendering is in in no eyes shall precede
[1:33:16] so if you read it with that
[1:33:18] understanding reads this way uh that we
[1:33:22] which are alive and remain unto the come
[1:33:23] to the Lord shall shall in no
[1:33:27] wise uh precede them that which are
[1:33:30] asleep which prevent Hendry either one
[1:33:32] of them means the same thing but it's
[1:33:33] not we're not going to proceede those
[1:33:35] that are alive remain we not proceede
[1:33:37] those that that are to be resurrected
[1:33:40] and so verse 16 for this is just such a
[1:33:44] beautiful scripture and I got to
[1:33:45] thinking about this
[1:33:46] today we're talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:33:49] himself we're talking about Revelations
[1:33:51] 101 coming down now what is
[1:33:54] 1 Thessalonians 4:16 say the first verse
[1:33:58] for the Lord
[1:34:00] himself
[1:34:03] himself himself the Lord
[1:34:07] himself baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:34:09] way for the Holy Ghost
[1:34:11] himself for the Lord
[1:34:14] himself that makes it real definite and

[1:34:58] we need to understand has been revealed
[1:35:00] to us the rest of it to the Jews we
[1:35:02] don't really need to know that but
[1:35:04] that's fine we understand a lot of more

[1:40:28] you enjoy it
[1:40:29] tonight amen
[1:40:34] amen praise the Lord
[1:40:37] uh there's ever a time we we should be
[1:40:40] more
[1:40:43] sincere than ever ever before it's it's
[1:40:47] now we should ever take our calling and
[1:40:51] election
[1:40:54] with all
[1:40:55] seriousness and you know the the Lord
[1:40:59] told the prophet that he'd have to be
[1:41:00] more
[1:41:01] sincere hadd be more more sincere
[1:41:04] remember when he was had that binding of
[1:41:07] the
[1:41:08] snake and then he would he would loose
[1:41:11] it and then he would bind it
[1:41:13] again and the angel told him now you
[1:41:16] must be more sincere in church we we
[1:41:19] must be sincere let's lay aside every
[1:41:23] everything things that cloud our mind
[1:41:26] things that that just you know
[1:41:31] uh we're like a
[1:41:33] sponge we can just take in things and
[1:41:37] take in things but if we get too full we
[1:41:40] get too much of something then then we
[1:41:44] can't you know the sponge can only take
[1:41:47] so
[1:41:48] much and I I think that's the devil's
[1:41:52] plan
[1:41:54] is to get us to where we're we're taking
[1:41:56] in all this other stuff through
[1:41:59] technology and then when it comes forth
[1:42:02] for the word to come forth and God wants
[1:42:04] to but we can't it's hard for us to
[1:42:07] receive that because we're so full of
[1:42:09] everything else but
[1:42:12] church God didn't put us here on this
[1:42:15] Earth for us
[1:42:17] to live be happy go
[1:42:19] lucky and just to enjoy ourselves and
[1:42:24] entertainments and and things like that
[1:42:27] because we we know the curse of the age
[1:42:30] if I could say it the curse it's it's
[1:42:33] definitely a prophecy of the ages that
[1:42:35] men would become lovers of pleasure more
[1:42:37] than lovers of God so they become a
[1:42:40] sponge to the things of the world more
[1:42:42] than the sponge to God and the channels
[1:42:46] become clogged up and and God has waited
[1:42:49] all these
[1:42:51] years 6,000 years he's been waiting for
[1:42:54] this time right here he saved the best
[1:42:57] for the last this is it Church we're
[1:43:01] it God didn't put us in any other age he
[1:43:04] put us right here and we must take it
[1:43:07] sincere God took it seriously and we
[1:43:10] must take it seriously amen lay aside
[1:43:13] the things of the world lay aside those
[1:43:16] things even as Paul would say those
[1:43:18] things would so easily be such us can
[1:43:21] you say Amen the weight and sin and and
[1:43:25] so we we certainly we certainly believe
[1:43:28] it and if we are a a forward people then
[1:43:33] we believe it All We Believe It All We
[1:43:35] believe what God sent to Luther we
[1:43:37] believe what God sent to Wesley we
[1:43:40] believe what God sent to Pentecost and
[1:43:43] now we believe what God sent to us we
[1:43:46] believe it amen you uh how many believes
[1:43:49] in
[1:43:50] justification you believe in that you
[1:43:52] believe in
[1:43:53] sanctification how many believes in the
[1:43:55] nine spiritual gifts we believe in it
[1:43:58] all and we we have more of a balance we
[1:44:02] have a greater balance to justification
[1:44:04] than what Luther have that's right we
[1:44:06] have a greater balance to sanctification
[1:44:09] than what Wesley had we have a greater
[1:44:12] balance to the spiritual gifts than what
[1:44:14] Pentecost had and God put that balance
[1:44:18] so he could bring us to an adoption
[1:44:20] we're no longer children just running
[1:44:22] off ear on Limbs and all that but he's
[1:44:25] got us in complete control we know what
[1:44:28] the father wants of us amen and so uh I
[1:44:33] certainly thoroughly enjoyed it today
[1:44:35] tonight and uh we appreciate uh brother
