[44:09] amen and um going to read the 16th
[44:14] verse through the
[44:19] 19th uh we'll start at the 15th
[44:22] wherefore I also after I heard of your
[44:24] faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto
[44:27] all the saints cease not to give thanks
[44:28] for you making mention of you in my
[44:31] prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus
[44:34] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[44:36] you the spirit of
[44:38] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[44:40] of him the eyes of your understanding
[44:43] being enlightened that you may know what
[44:46] is the hope of his calling and what the
[44:48] riches of his the glory of his
[44:50] inheritance in the Saints amen you can
[44:55] have your seats this
[44:57] evening and
[44:59] um again I'm going to use the title um
[45:04] understanding who we are and I I realize
[45:07] that I have dealt with that the subject
[45:10] of
[45:11] understanding uh um at different times
[45:15] and and things but I believe it is
[45:17] important uh for us to understand and to
[45:21] have an understanding and um you know
[45:26] the lord gave brother brandham uh a
[45:29] little insight as to why some people
[45:31] don't receive their
[45:33] healing and brother Braham said it's
[45:36] because it's a lack of
[45:39] understanding and so I think maybe it's
[45:42] a lack of understanding that that keeps
[45:46] people from stepping in faith and
[45:48] claiming their god-given
[45:51] rights and we we talk about God creating
[45:55] the heaven and Earth and and he done
[45:58] that by faith he created the world by by
[46:02] faith and but not only did he desire a
[46:05] world not only did he desire the things
[46:09] that he created but he had an
[46:12] understanding he had an understanding
[46:14] that he could have whatever he
[46:17] desired and he understood who he was and
[46:21] and so the the Bible says that the world
[46:25] was void and without form and darkness
[46:27] was upon the face of the deep but
[46:31] because he understood that he had the
[46:34] ability to change the
[46:36] situation and the power then he had
[46:39] faith and therefore he he he moved by
[46:44] faith and spoke the creative word and
[46:48] overcame that which seemed
[46:51] impossible now we know as the prophet
[46:54] told us that faith is the sense and by
[46:58] it we have understanding uh uh and so
[47:02] God's understanding came by faith and
[47:05] Faith of course is a revelation that's
[47:09] the way Faith Comes the the the the
[47:11] super sense faith it comes by Revelation
[47:15] and by that we have understanding and so
[47:20] uh uh when when the Revelation strikes
[47:22] our soul then Faith arises
[47:26] and where there is Faith then then we
[47:29] have this understanding and no wonder
[47:30] the prophet told us to pray for
[47:32] revelation we we need
[47:35] Revelation in the natural we have five
[47:37] senses and and you know taste feel hear
[47:40] smell and sight and things and so uh and
[47:45] and and by these five senses then we can
[47:48] understand the world that we live in uh
[47:51] our sight helps us to understand the
[47:54] things we see our our sense of hearing
[47:57] helps us to understand the things uh uh
[48:01] the different sounds that we hear our
[48:04] our sense of touch helps us to
[48:06] understand the things that we feel and
[48:09] and so uh we're able to understand
[48:12] things by the by our our five senses of
[48:15] of the body and and these senses came
[48:19] automatically when we were born we
[48:21] didn't we didn't have to go get them it
[48:23] it just automatically happened and came
[48:26] came with it and so then then we find if
[48:30] you notice Jesus said in John
[48:32] 3:3 he said except a man be born again
[48:36] except a man have this new birth he
[48:39] cannot see the kingdom of God in other
[48:42] words he cannot understand the kingdom
[48:44] of God so this understanding that that
[48:47] we're talking about it it does not come
[48:50] by the natural birth it does not come
[48:53] automatically uh uh this
[48:56] uh so so it it takes a new birth to be
[48:59] able to see and brother Brown said to
[49:02] see means to understand amen and and so
[49:06] uh and and the understanding that we're
[49:08] talking about is a spiritual
[49:10] understanding it's nothing to do with
[49:13] the carnal understanding but but the the
[49:16] the the the the uh spiritual
[49:18] understanding and the faith that we're
[49:20] speaking of again is the six sense which
[49:23] brother brandham called the super sense
[49:26] ain't that right and so it it is not
[49:29] given to a man through a natural birth
[49:31] like the other senses brother random
[49:33] said God is not understood by knowledge
[49:38] he's understood by Faith by faith ain't
[49:42] that right and so it takes a new birth
[49:45] to have the six sense which is the
[49:49] superp sense Faith so don't try to
[49:53] understand God by your carnal
[49:55] understanding don't try to figure out
[49:58] the Bible or or the message uh uh
[50:01] through a a a carnal understanding uh it
[50:05] it is
[50:06] impossible uh to to understand by
[50:09] knowledge and and and so uh uh and this
[50:13] is why uh Proverbs 3 and 5 uh God tells
[50:17] us to not to lean on thine own
[50:21] understanding ain't that right amen so
[50:23] when he says get in thy and get
[50:26] understanding he's not talking about
[50:27] your own understanding there there's a
[50:30] part of knowledge and of understanding
[50:32] that comes with the natural birth but
[50:35] it's a carnal understanding ain't that
[50:37] right and and so uh uh Solomon the
[50:41] brother Bram says why would Solomon tell
[50:43] us these things why would he tell us not
[50:45] to lean on our own understanding he said
[50:48] because our
[50:49] modern understanding is usually the
[50:52] wisdom of man which is contrary to the
[50:56] word of God ain't that right see so the
[50:59] Bible says man in this age would ever be
[51:03] learning see knowledge amen but never
[51:08] coming to the knowledge of Truth the
[51:11] understanding of truth because the
[51:14] understanding that that we're talking
[51:15] about the eyes of our understanding is
[51:19] not coming from an intellectual
[51:21] knowledge of God or anything like that
[51:25] see our our understanding when it comes
[51:27] to our natural man uh uh that
[51:31] understanding comes from the Tree of
[51:33] knowledge of Good and Evil ain't that
[51:36] right amen and and and and I'm going to
[51:38] read this Genesis 2 and9 uh the Bible
[51:41] says out of the ground made the Lord God
[51:44] to grow every tree that is Pleasant to
[51:46] the sight and good for food the tree of
[51:49] life also in the midst of the garden and
[51:51] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[51:54] then you go in the six 16th verse and
[51:56] the Lord God commanded the man saying of
[51:59] every tree of the garden thou mayest uh
[52:02] uh freely eat but of the tree of
[52:05] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[52:08] not eat of it see for in the day that
[52:12] thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely
[52:15] die so they were not a they God never
[52:18] meant for them to live by that type of a
[52:21] knowledge that carnal
[52:23] knowledge he he meant for for the word
[52:26] to come to them and they would live by
[52:29] the word of God their understanding
[52:31] would not be by the tree of knowledge
[52:33] but it would come by the word of God and
[52:36] and and so uh um but we find that that
[52:39] the knowledge that comes from the Tree
[52:41] of knowledge does not come from God it
[52:44] actually comes from Satan uh his
[52:49] understanding ain't that right so so we
[52:51] find that he partook of that tree of
[52:54] knowledge and the prophet said Satan
[52:57] came to Eve with his own understanding
[53:01] see and projected something to her which
[53:05] wasn't to her real understanding of
[53:08] Goden amen see so he he he presented his
[53:12] own understanding amen that was
[53:15] different from what God's understanding
[53:18] was and and the prophet said see he did
[53:21] not establish her in the word of God he
[53:25] gave her something other than God's word
[53:29] and and that uh that that appealed uh uh
[53:33] to her reasoning it did not appeal to
[53:35] her faith it appealed to her reasoning
[53:40] ain't that right and so then then we
[53:43] know that her being a a free moral agent
[53:46] she had to make her choice between what
[53:49] God told her and what she understood
[53:51] about God and and what Satan was telling
[53:54] her and and what she understood about uh
[53:57] what Satan was saying and so in order
[53:59] for her to listen to God then she would
[54:02] have to believe in what he said and in
[54:06] order to listen to to to Satan and what
[54:09] he was telling her then she had to
[54:12] reason within
[54:14] herself amen and and which would be to
[54:18] lean on her own understanding see you
[54:21] can't lean on your own understanding and
[54:24] believe what God Said
[54:25] say uh uh uh you You When God says it
[54:29] you just have to believe it ain't that
[54:32] right but anytime we lean to our own
[54:35] understanding we're actually listening
[54:38] to something outside of God's word so
[54:42] she she leaned to her own understanding
[54:45] and began to reason what Satan was
[54:47] telling her that old serpent telling her
[54:50] and she listened to the devil's lie
[54:54] ain't that right
[54:55] now the prophet says and I'm going to
[54:57] get somewhere but the prophet said Satan
[54:59] wanted fairly because Eve lusted for
[55:03] knowledge she wasn't satisfied with what
[55:06] God was going to give her she wanted
[55:08] something better she was looking for
[55:10] knowledge see and so the understanding
[55:13] that she already had amen from God Amen
[55:18] it it wasn't good enough see and and it
[55:20] was actually the mind of God the word of
[55:22] God it was God's knowledge a man that
[55:25] God had given her amen but yet she
[55:27] wanted to think on her own see and so
[55:30] the prophet says when the man tries to
[55:33] reason and says it couldn't be done then
[55:35] that drives him away from God constantly
[55:38] all the time when he's trying to listen
[55:40] to his his own understanding he said see
[55:43] if you don't understand the Bible says a
[55:45] certain thing he said then just
[55:48] punctuate it with an
[55:50] amen can you say Amen if your
[55:53] understanding don't understand this
[55:55] Bible just say Amen to it if if you're
[55:58] understanding don't understand the
[56:00] message amen then just say Amen to it
[56:04] punctuate it with an amen and just leave
[56:07] it there can you say amen amen because
[56:09] your understanding of the word will
[56:12] never agree amen with the word of God a
[56:16] not not in your own understanding it
[56:18] takes a higher understanding and for
[56:21] that a man has to be born again
[56:25] can you say Amen so we we find today
[56:29] that the emphasis is is laid upon uh
[56:34] education and upon our own understanding
[56:37] of things we're living in a day of of
[56:40] learning a as the prophet said and and
[56:43] it's getting even into the church to
[56:45] where the intellectuals want to turn the
[56:47] house of God in into a a a more like a
[56:51] classroom uh uh such and and Paul Paul
[56:56] said here in 1 Corinthians 2 and 4 he
[56:59] says my speech and my preaching was not
[57:02] with enticing words of man's Wisdom but
[57:05] in demonstration of the power and of
[57:08] spirit that your faith everybody say my
[57:11] faith your faith should not stand in the
[57:14] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[57:18] then he goes down in the ninth verse but
[57:20] as it is written I have not seen nor ear
[57:22] heard neither has entered into the heart
[57:25] of man the things which God hath
[57:28] prepared for them that love him but God
[57:31] hath revealed them to us by his Spirit
[57:35] aren't you glad for the spirit of God
[57:37] God has revealed them to us by his
[57:40] spirit and and he says for the spirit of
[57:43] uh searcheth all things yeay the Deep
[57:45] things of God for what man knoweth the
[57:48] things of man save the spirit of a man
[57:51] which is in him so so to understand the
[57:54] carnal things we have a carnal nature we
[57:57] have that the spirit of a man that helps
[57:59] us to understand the carnal things of
[58:02] life amen but but but the spirit of man
[58:05] can never understand amen the spiritual
[58:08] things of God ain't that right he said
[58:11] see so even so the things of God knoweth
[58:14] no man but the spirit of God but notice
[58:18] what he said we have not received or he
[58:20] says now we have received not the spirit
[58:22] of the world but the spirit which is of
[58:25] god that we might know the things that
[58:28] are freely given to us of God ain't that
[58:31] right so we are told to get
[58:34] understanding God wants us to get
[58:36] understanding now when when you you
[58:38] listening to the the message and things
[58:40] brother brandom it it it he's you know
[58:43] it's it's a lot of times he says you
[58:44] can't understand and have faith it's
[58:47] it's not by understanding it's by faith
[58:49] but what he's trying to tell us is that
[58:51] it's not your own understanding to where
[58:54] you reason the Promises of of God out
[58:56] and and you say well how can it be and I
[58:59] I just don't know and and I don't see it
[59:01] going to happen and I I I you understand
[59:04] what I'm saying if you're if you're
[59:06] trying to live the message amen and live
[59:09] the word and be a Christian by your own
[59:12] understanding it will always produce
[59:14] question marks than it does in absolute
[59:17] because the carnal mind can never
[59:21] understand the things of God ain't that
[59:23] right so now what a prophet said he says
[59:27] a genuine Born Again Son of God will
[59:30] only everybody say will
[59:32] only understand the things that are of
[59:35] God Amen he will only understand the
[59:38] things that are of God you know some
[59:40] people talk negative about Divine
[59:42] Healing and and miracles and and say
[59:45] well all these things are in the past
[59:47] see and and and and they say that
[59:50] because they don't understand the things
[59:53] of God Amen but a genuine believer he
[59:57] will never understand what they're
[59:59] trying to tell you amen say because a
[1:00:02] genuine True Believer will only
[1:00:05] understand the things of God many talk
[1:00:08] negative about God sending a prophet in
[1:00:10] this day there is so much negative about
[1:00:13] God's word for this day and and the
[1:00:15] message and and among so-called
[1:00:18] Christians and all of that but brother
[1:00:20] Bram says now a genuine born again
[1:00:23] Christian that will never stop in his
[1:00:26] ears he doesn't understand it at all so
[1:00:30] see when the negative comes about and
[1:00:32] the negative about the word and the
[1:00:34] negative about the promises and and and
[1:00:36] the negative even thoughts that come
[1:00:38] into our mind and and all of these
[1:00:40] things a true genuine believer lets that
[1:00:44] pass through and doesn't let it come in
[1:00:46] them because they don't understand that
[1:00:49] you understand what I'm saying a carnal
[1:00:51] believer doesn't understand the things
[1:00:53] of God doesn't understand the promises
[1:00:55] of God but a genuine True Believer
[1:00:58] doesn't understand the negative about
[1:01:00] the word of God doesn't understand the
[1:01:02] the negative about the message you
[1:01:04] understand what I'm saying two different
[1:01:06] types of
[1:01:08] understanding amen can you say amen and
[1:01:11] you cannot have the understanding of
[1:01:14] God's word to where you accept God's
[1:01:16] word and the message as the absolute
[1:01:19] until a man is truly born
[1:01:22] again now I don't understand you know
[1:01:25] what people are saying when they degrade
[1:01:27] this message that I just don't
[1:01:29] understand that they they may they don't
[1:01:31] understand when I say the message is the
[1:01:33] absolute they don't understand see amen
[1:01:37] they they you know I I don't understand
[1:01:39] it when people treat amen uh uh the
[1:01:42] things of God and what he has done in
[1:01:44] this day and they treat it lightly I
[1:01:46] don't understand that they don't
[1:01:49] understand why I'm so sold out in this
[1:01:51] message and they want to say well you're
[1:01:53] deity and you're this well see there's
[1:01:55] not an understanding between the two
[1:01:57] because one is is is is trying to
[1:02:00] understand by a carnal mind and another
[1:02:03] is trying to understand uh uh has got
[1:02:06] the understanding by the spirit of God
[1:02:08] see I don't understand why they want to
[1:02:10] call us Pentecostals amen using it in a
[1:02:13] degraded way amen when we shout and when
[1:02:16] we we we enjoy amen our freedom and get
[1:02:20] excited and happy you know brother
[1:02:22] brandom he goes on to say he says How
[1:02:25] could a man that believes in God and can
[1:02:27] read the Bible and see that he's the
[1:02:29] same yesterday today and forever will
[1:02:31] ever accept such a thing as that he says
[1:02:34] I don't understand it you understand
[1:02:37] what I'm saying I don't understand why
[1:02:39] people don't accept amen what God has
[1:02:42] done and had his picture taken and and
[1:02:44] and and and and these things in this day
[1:02:47] and and it doesn't excite them amen but
[1:02:50] here's so God is telling us in all that
[1:02:54] by getting get understanding can you say
[1:02:57] Amen get understanding amen see so
[1:03:02] believers do not lean to their own
[1:03:04] understanding amen which comes just by
[1:03:07] the carnal uh the the carnal nature
[1:03:11] spirit that that that we're born with
[1:03:13] now uh in in Psalms 119 1225 David prays
[1:03:19] I am thy servant give me understanding
[1:03:23] that I may know
[1:03:25] thy testimonies yes give me
[1:03:28] understanding so here's a man that is
[1:03:30] praying that God would give him the
[1:03:33] understanding I'm not going to take my
[1:03:34] own understanding God of this I want you
[1:03:37] to give me understanding that I may Know
[1:03:39] Thy word ain't that right on down in in
[1:03:43] verse 130 amen he said the entrance of
[1:03:47] Thy word giveth light it giveth
[1:03:50] understanding unto the simple amen so
[1:03:53] brother Brown says says it's got to be a
[1:03:55] revelation coming from God to understand
[1:03:59] it don't bypass
[1:04:03] Revelation can you say Amen see so then
[1:04:07] brother Bram tells us where this type of
[1:04:09] understanding comes from it it's down in
[1:04:12] your heart the understanding you
[1:04:14] understand from your heart and not your
[1:04:16] intellect reasoning ain't that right see
[1:04:20] so Paul speaks of of it here in in ephes
[1:04:24] iians
[1:04:25] 4:17 he says this I say therefore and
[1:04:28] testify in the Lord that you henceforth
[1:04:30] walk not as other Gentiles walk in the
[1:04:35] vanity of their own mind see leaning to
[1:04:39] their own understanding see intellects
[1:04:42] reasoning uh uh uh you know they're
[1:04:45] they're leaning to their own
[1:04:47] understanding and notice in the 18th
[1:04:49] verse having the understanding darkened
[1:04:53] amen being alienated from the life of
[1:04:56] God through the ignorance that is in
[1:04:58] them because of the blindness of their
[1:05:02] heart so their understanding is not
[1:05:06] there because of the blindness their
[1:05:08] heart is blind they there's there
[1:05:10] there's nothing there to see can you say
[1:05:13] Amen see so their understanding was
[1:05:16] darkened because their heart was blinded
[1:05:19] amen and their ignorance caus them to be
[1:05:22] alienated from the light of God Amen see
[1:05:26] so then then we could say that this
[1:05:29] understanding that we're talking about
[1:05:31] it can only come from the word of God
[1:05:35] Amen this is why we don't follow Creeds
[1:05:37] of man denominations and organizations
[1:05:40] and traditions and this is why we don't
[1:05:43] go to Bible school and and and and and
[1:05:46] try to get a a better understanding of
[1:05:48] the word of God Amen and of of the day
[1:05:51] that we're living in can you say amen
[1:05:53] amen because uh uh the understanding has
[1:05:57] to come from the word of God Amen so
[1:06:00] then what is the word of God and I I
[1:06:03] want you to listen now what is the word
[1:06:05] of God well the word of God is a
[1:06:08] mirror amen it's a mirror everything is
[1:06:11] a mirror ain't that right well that's
[1:06:13] what the Bible says a uh uh Paul there
[1:06:16] in 2 Corinthians 3:15 but we all
[1:06:19] everybody say we all with open face
[1:06:22] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:06:25] Lord so it's a Looking Glass it's a
[1:06:29] mirror so when we're looking into the
[1:06:32] word of God we're looking what what
[1:06:34] happens when you look in the
[1:06:37] mirror do do do do do you see the
[1:06:40] elephant do do you see the giraffe do
[1:06:42] you do you see the monkey do you do you
[1:06:45] see sometimes you know uh I want to see
[1:06:48] something different than what I'm
[1:06:49] looking at but it's it's a reflection
[1:06:53] it's a mirror when you stand there you
[1:06:55] know uh uh sometimes you I tell the
[1:06:58] children you know when they were real
[1:06:59] young look in the mirror and see that
[1:07:01] monkey you know and so he look oh dad
[1:07:03] you know and but but it's a reflection
[1:07:07] of what you're looking at and so this
[1:07:09] word is a reflection can you say Amen so
[1:07:13] when we're really looking in the word
[1:07:16] then we're getting an understanding that
[1:07:19] you could not get from a denomination
[1:07:22] you could not get amen from a seminar
[1:07:24] you cannot get from some Creed or some
[1:07:27] book of a man's writing or a theologian
[1:07:30] and all of these things can you amen so
[1:07:33] now I looked at this word glass because
[1:07:36] because he says we're beholding as in a
[1:07:38] glass the glory of the Lord and it says
[1:07:41] to show in a mirror to make to reflect
[1:07:44] to mirror see to look at
[1:07:47] oneself in the
[1:07:49] mirror can you sayen so you can see
[1:07:52] where our understanding now is beginning
[1:07:55] to take form amen that when we look into
[1:07:58] the word of God and we're seeing a
[1:08:01] mirror amen then we begin to understand
[1:08:05] ourselves as to who we are see to behold
[1:08:09] oneself in a mirror so then then when
[1:08:11] we're looking at the word we are not to
[1:08:14] get a historical understanding of what
[1:08:17] happened in the past right we're we're
[1:08:21] not to just to get an understanding of
[1:08:24] what is to happen in the future Amen
[1:08:27] brother Brandon and you all know it but
[1:08:29] he says man is forever praising God for
[1:08:31] what he did do looking for what he will
[1:08:34] be and ignoring what he's doing right
[1:08:37] now ain't that right but if you're
[1:08:40] really looking in the mirror it gives
[1:08:42] you an understanding of your day and
[1:08:47] age yes
[1:08:48] sir brother brandom talked about brother
[1:08:51] and sister Moore writing their paper and
[1:08:54] he's telling the people constantly to
[1:08:55] fast and to pray fast and pray and and
[1:08:59] brother Bram says see they say well
[1:09:01] we're going to have a great breaking of
[1:09:02] the day there is a great thing going to
[1:09:05] happen all of you pray pray pray we're
[1:09:07] not too late yet and brother brand says
[1:09:09] why do they do that because they're
[1:09:10] wanting a Great Awakening they're crying
[1:09:13] see they're believing for a Great
[1:09:15] Awakening but see what what they didn't
[1:09:17] know what they were praying for was
[1:09:19] already happening right right there in
[1:09:22] their midst ain't that right and what
[1:09:24] was it brother Bram said they had
[1:09:26] recognize the Awakening of the Bride the
[1:09:29] bride had been awakened right in before
[1:09:32] them and they did not understand that
[1:09:35] and so they're still looking for
[1:09:36] something to happen amen because they
[1:09:39] weren't really looking in the mirror
[1:09:41] amen of and seeing the day and age that
[1:09:44] they they we were living in ain't that
[1:09:46] right so they didn't recognize or
[1:09:48] understand what had been done and they
[1:09:52] were looking for it off in the future
[1:09:53] future but notice if if there's anybody
[1:09:57] in this age that is to be compared if we
[1:09:59] are going to be compared to anybody you
[1:10:01] know who it's going to be right Jesus
[1:10:04] Christ ain't that right because we're
[1:10:06] supposed to have the same ministry as he
[1:10:08] has amen we are to be have the same
[1:10:11] character as as he did we are to have
[1:10:14] the same re re uh resemblance as he has
[1:10:18] amen we are the people when Jesus said
[1:10:20] father make them one even as we and you
[1:10:23] and I are one we are that people amen
[1:10:26] are to make that prayer fulfilled can
[1:10:28] you can you say amen amen see so then
[1:10:31] then we can look at Jesus for a moment
[1:10:34] did you realize that Jesus saw himself
[1:10:36] in the word of God on he looked in the
[1:10:41] mirror of the word and he saw himself in
[1:10:44] every chapter Hallelujah sure he knew
[1:10:49] what happened in the past he had under
[1:10:51] he had an understanding of the past he
[1:10:54] knew he understood what was going to
[1:10:55] happen in the future ain't that right
[1:10:58] amen but but notice he saw himself in
[1:11:01] the past for he said you know he saw
[1:11:04] himself in the prophets for brother BR
[1:11:06] said it was Christ in the prophets ain't
[1:11:08] that right and so he saw himself in the
[1:11:11] past and and and the prophecies that
[1:11:13] were given amen by the prophets he saw
[1:11:16] himself there he saw himself in the
[1:11:19] songs that were sung in the Old
[1:11:21] Testament he saw himself you know in the
[1:11:24] types and shadows he had an
[1:11:27] understanding that he was the one they
[1:11:30] were talking about they were singing
[1:11:32] about they were writing about it was an
[1:11:35] understanding that only he
[1:11:37] had amen ain't that right so he didn't
[1:11:40] know just what would take place you know
[1:11:42] uh uh didn't just know what would take
[1:11:44] place in the future but he saw himself
[1:11:47] in the future he knew he would rise from
[1:11:50] the from from from the grave ain't that
[1:11:52] right he knew knew that that he would
[1:11:54] not only be with man but he would be in
[1:11:57] man amen he knew that that that there
[1:12:00] would be a day that he would be revealed
[1:12:02] again as son of man he knew that he knew
[1:12:05] a future he had understanding another
[1:12:08] future but he saw himself in the
[1:12:12] future have you ever just thought of
[1:12:14] that bible talks of the Millennium
[1:12:17] that's great to have that understanding
[1:12:19] but when you really look at do you have
[1:12:20] an understanding that you're the one
[1:12:22] that's going to be there yeah come
[1:12:25] on can you say Amen so he understood the
[1:12:29] past he understood the future he saw
[1:12:30] himself in the past he saw himself in
[1:12:33] the future amen but most importantly he
[1:12:35] saw himself in the day and understood
[1:12:38] who he was in that day that he was
[1:12:40] living can you say amen he understood
[1:12:43] that he was the promised Messiah for
[1:12:45] that present
[1:12:47] day brother Bri said he had faith in God
[1:12:51] Amen who who made him the uh who who
[1:12:53] made him the word see he was God the
[1:12:56] word and they was in him and that gave
[1:12:59] him Faith because he understood his
[1:13:02] position and you say man we talk about
[1:13:04] rapturing faith you know what that's
[1:13:06] happening is we're understanding our
[1:13:08] position
[1:13:11] amen amen this this ain't just the faith
[1:13:13] of the Centurion this isn't just the
[1:13:15] faith of a Jew amen uh Jas and Gentile
[1:13:19] and these things this is the very Faith
[1:13:21] of
[1:13:22] Christ amen of God can you sayen and
[1:13:26] that give him Faith because he
[1:13:28] understood his position he knowed what
[1:13:31] he was because the scripture said that's
[1:13:35] what he
[1:13:36] was he looked in the mirror he looked
[1:13:39] into something that was an
[1:13:42] absolute amen can you say
[1:13:45] Amen yes sir amen see and so he says and
[1:13:50] here every scripture tied in to prove
[1:13:53] Pro that he was exactly what the
[1:13:55] scripture said he would be and he knew
[1:13:57] what he was everybody say he
[1:14:01] understood what he was he understood his
[1:14:06] position hello church he understood his
[1:14:10] position not just going to church but
[1:14:13] there's got to be an understanding to
[1:14:14] this amen not just saying oh bride bride
[1:14:17] bride bride bride bride you know bride's
[1:14:19] Revival understanding Who You Are
[1:14:26] now who was it that couldn't understand
[1:14:29] the people around him couldn't
[1:14:31] understand who he was right so John
[1:14:35] 10:33 notice now the Jews answered him
[1:14:39] saying for a good work we Stone thee not
[1:14:41] but for
[1:14:42] blasphemy because thou being a man
[1:14:46] makest thyself
[1:14:49] god well his understanding brought him
[1:14:53] to these
[1:14:55] confessions have you ever just thought
[1:14:57] of how your confession you know he's the
[1:15:00] high priest of your confession
[1:15:02] profession he can't do anything for you
[1:15:04] until you confess it
[1:15:06] first church how we need an
[1:15:09] understanding of who we are
[1:15:12] amen now he was so sure of who he was
[1:15:16] because he understood his position so
[1:15:18] there was no doubt there was no
[1:15:20] questions there was no no he loves me he
[1:15:22] loves me not he loves me he loves me not
[1:15:24] I'm going you know I'm saved I'm not
[1:15:26] saved I'm saved I don't know if I'm
[1:15:28] saved I'm going in a Rapture who who
[1:15:30] knows anybody guesses no no no
[1:15:34] understanding your position and staying
[1:15:36] there praise God ain't that right see so
[1:15:41] so they're upset they didn't understand
[1:15:43] him and they're going to Stone him for
[1:15:44] blasphemy for him being a man so they
[1:15:47] say they say makest thou thyself God but
[1:15:51] see he was the word and the Word was
[1:15:55] God right isn't that what brother Bram
[1:15:57] kept telling us he was the word and the
[1:16:00] word is God John 1:1 in the beginning
[1:16:03] was the word the word was with God the
[1:16:04] Word was God 14th verse and the Word was
[1:16:07] made
[1:16:09] flesh ain't that right well then Jesus
[1:16:12] tells them said well the prophets were
[1:16:14] God he said the scriptures called them
[1:16:17] Gods to whom the word of the Lord came
[1:16:18] to the word of God comes to a
[1:16:20] prophet ain't that right so then notice
[1:16:24] what he does he does not back down from
[1:16:26] this he doesn't cower down say well
[1:16:28] maybe you're right I'm sorry I shouldn't
[1:16:29] have gone that far I shouldn't have
[1:16:31] gotten so bold I I you know I shouldn't
[1:16:33] have declared myself to who I really
[1:16:35] think I am I don't know and and so all
[1:16:37] of a sudden he gets all twisted up in
[1:16:39] his mind all that notice how the
[1:16:41] challenge he tells them search the
[1:16:44] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:16:46] have eternal life but they testify of me
[1:16:49] he's looking in the word and he's seeing
[1:16:51] himself in the word amen now you can't
[1:16:54] change it you could not make him doubt
[1:16:57] who he was he
[1:17:01] understood I hope it was all
[1:17:03] right so then he challenged them to look
[1:17:06] and see him look in the scriptures and
[1:17:09] see
[1:17:11] me but they looking without
[1:17:15] understanding ain't that right the
[1:17:17] Greeks wanted to see Jesus and they
[1:17:19] failed to see him because he was clothed
[1:17:22] in his human Temple
[1:17:24] brother Braham said it was the human
[1:17:25] flesh that blinded them and he says now
[1:17:29] notice how how he brings that now from
[1:17:31] from Jesus now to the day of his day a
[1:17:35] Critic a few years ago a few days ago
[1:17:39] said to me down in Tucson he said you
[1:17:41] know some people make you a nut and
[1:17:42] others make you a God I said well that
[1:17:45] kind of runs all
[1:17:46] right I know he was trying to criticize
[1:17:49] me he saidwell people think you're a God
[1:17:54] well I said I I I know the people didn't
[1:17:57] do that but I know he didn't understand
[1:18:00] it he didn't understand the ministry he
[1:18:03] didn't understand what was really
[1:18:04] happening see but brother brandham
[1:18:07] did are you with me now brother brandham
[1:18:10] did and so he says see he didn't
[1:18:14] understand it because he was on the
[1:18:16] other side of the
[1:18:18] skin
[1:18:19] right think of that now only you as the
[1:18:24] body of Christ in this day can really
[1:18:26] have the understanding amen people on
[1:18:30] the other side of the skin can't
[1:18:32] understand right true he says see I know
[1:18:35] he didn't get it he didn't know it and
[1:18:37] and so I said that's not too far from
[1:18:39] the word of God is it see and he said he
[1:18:42] says just let him know that we wasn't
[1:18:45] lost we know where we're standing we
[1:18:48] know what kind of sails we had set and
[1:18:50] what kind of wind was blowing it see we
[1:18:53] know what our thread was we know what
[1:18:54] our nut was we know how we're
[1:18:58] standing why because he understood his
[1:19:02] position amen
[1:19:04] amen ain't that
[1:19:06] right well what about you brother Ram's
[1:19:10] done fulfilled his time we're not
[1:19:12] looking for him to come
[1:19:14] back it's the the paton's in your
[1:19:18] hands what where are we at what what
[1:19:21] about Revelations 8 and9 where the Bible
[1:19:25] the prophet said John represented the
[1:19:27] bride and after the the seventh angel
[1:19:30] had sounded the lamb had come with the
[1:19:31] book the seventh angel sounded then John
[1:19:34] was told to go to the angel and get the
[1:19:35] book and eat the
[1:19:37] book are you with me now see so then
[1:19:41] what about
[1:19:42] us is there is there scripture for
[1:19:47] us well brother Bram says the word is in
[1:19:50] the
[1:19:51] bride
[1:19:53] yes amen sir the word is in the bride
[1:19:56] she has thus say the
[1:20:00] Lord can you say
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:03] Amen John said the spirit and the bride
[1:20:06] say come brother Bram said what the
[1:20:08] authenticated Prophet says from God the
[1:20:10] bride will say see the spirit and the
[1:20:13] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[1:20:15] same thing and what they will say will
[1:20:18] already have been said in the
[1:20:20] word and they are saying it now
[1:20:25] can you say amen amen not only just the
[1:20:29] preachers but all of us why because
[1:20:31] brother Bram said oh how we need in
[1:20:32] Jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:20:35] voices what are we we are lived voices
[1:20:40] amen Living Voices written Epistles read
[1:20:44] and known of all
[1:20:47] men can you say Amen brother Bram said
[1:20:50] see that's the Thunder of God thundering
[1:20:52] out and sweetness Holiness Purity
[1:20:54] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:20:56] Earth today without a blemish so see
[1:20:58] Jesus saw
[1:21:00] himself amen he was the word made flesh
[1:21:03] and he saw himself brother Braham said
[1:21:04] see now remember they the disciples had
[1:21:07] the word and the Word was flesh then see
[1:21:10] and the word told them I give you power
[1:21:13] I give you power they had the power but
[1:21:15] they didn't have the faith to operate
[1:21:17] the word that was in them they didn't
[1:21:20] have the understanding amen
[1:21:24] he said see what I mean but Jesus had it
[1:21:26] he was the word he had faith that what
[1:21:29] he said would happen he said oh bring
[1:21:31] him here see how long will I suffer you
[1:21:34] he had Faith with his power how did he
[1:21:36] he said I can do nothing in myself he
[1:21:39] relied up on what he was praise the Lord
[1:21:43] he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:21:46] word
[1:21:48] amen so brother brandom in praying said
[1:21:52] father we we ask for Grace then that
[1:21:54] you'll open our eyes to the
[1:21:57] understanding of Thy word that we might
[1:21:59] understand the hour We're living and
[1:22:01] that we might prepare ourselves for his
[1:22:03] appearing as we truly believe it's at
[1:22:06] hand so now we would ask that you would
[1:22:09] give to us tonight the desire of our
[1:22:12] heart according to your riches and Glory
[1:22:14] forgiving our sins Lord we pray that
[1:22:17] you'll not look at our misunderstandings
[1:22:19] and our ignorance concerning the things
[1:22:21] that we should know and that you'll
[1:22:24] forgive us for that can you say amen
[1:22:27] amen see so Paul in speaking of Christ
[1:22:31] said that he was the expressed image of
[1:22:33] God the express image of God and again
[1:22:37] God is the word amen another place he
[1:22:40] said he was the image of the invisible
[1:22:42] god brother bradam says he was the
[1:22:44] visible image of the invisible God right
[1:22:49] remember when they said oh Jes if you'd
[1:22:51] show us the father it would suffice this
[1:22:53] and he said how long have I been with
[1:22:55] you and you still don't know who I am he
[1:22:58] that has seen me hath seen the
[1:23:00] father he was the visible image of God
[1:23:05] of the invisible God for the word had
[1:23:08] become flesh ain't that right so then
[1:23:12] Paul brings it down to us Romans 8:29
[1:23:15] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:23:17] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:23:20] image of his son yes now we know what
[1:23:24] image that is right if he was the image
[1:23:27] of God so are
[1:23:31] we yes sir brother Braham said if you're
[1:23:33] God's kind you're the expressed image of
[1:23:35] the word making itself manifest word
[1:23:39] becoming flesh say it with me word
[1:23:43] becoming flesh yes sir see you're the
[1:23:47] expressed image of the word making
[1:23:49] itself
[1:23:50] manifest he says another place a woman
[1:23:53] is the part of a man taken from him so
[1:23:56] the church will have to be a word
[1:23:58] abiding church every word of the
[1:24:01] Bible another place what is that word
[1:24:04] bride the manifestation of this hour the
[1:24:08] bride not a Creed or denomination but a
[1:24:11] living Oracle of God a living attribute
[1:24:14] of God displaying to the world the
[1:24:16] attributes of God in the formation of
[1:24:19] the Bride that's to be expressed in this
[1:24:21] hour that word now
[1:24:24] living can you say Amen so then then we
[1:24:28] wouldn't look to anything outside the
[1:24:29] word of God it we look to the word of
[1:24:31] God to understand our position
[1:24:36] am amen I don't see how people get
[1:24:38] dissatisfied with the word of
[1:24:40] God I just don't understand but now
[1:24:44] notice the prophet said I fa in the
[1:24:46] spirit not long ago that someone was
[1:24:47] criticizing me it might have been in the
[1:24:50] tap land or of always referring so much
[1:24:52] go back and pick up Bible characters on
[1:24:54] what I'm saying see he said well I do
[1:24:57] that for a purpose the Bible said these
[1:24:59] things are written that we might look at
[1:25:03] them God wants you to have a mirror amen
[1:25:08] and that's the only way without an
[1:25:09] education the only way I can do is refer
[1:25:12] back and say you see where this stand
[1:25:14] see what happened by it and where this
[1:25:16] one took place then you just Place
[1:25:20] yourself in there
[1:25:23] ain't that right amen so now you you're
[1:25:26] looking at at at at Rahab the Harlot for
[1:25:28] example instead of looking at it as a as
[1:25:31] a past event put yourself there for this
[1:25:38] day PR amen so then you as Christ have
[1:25:44] got to look not only understanding the
[1:25:47] past as
[1:25:48] historical but seeing
[1:25:51] yourself
[1:25:52] can you say
[1:25:54] Amen understanding who she was
[1:25:59] portraying hello
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:07] Esther RAB the Harlot
[1:26:11] um
[1:26:13] famar Mary
[1:26:16] even you realize well I'll just move on
[1:26:21] see your self there right ain't that
[1:26:25] right
[1:26:28] now I'm going to go back to 2
[1:26:30] Corinthians
[1:26:32] 3:18 but we all everybody say we all we
[1:26:35] all every believer with open face
[1:26:38] beholding as in a glass a mirror the
[1:26:40] glory of the Lord are
[1:26:42] what are we Baptist here or are we
[1:26:44] actually excited about the Lord preach I
[1:26:47] don't
[1:26:48] know come on or do I need to stop and so
[1:26:51] we can just go home
[1:26:55] sleep all
[1:26:57] right but we all with open face
[1:27:00] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:27:03] Lord are what CH changed into the same
[1:27:10] image right praise the Lord changed into
[1:27:13] the same image from glory to glory from
[1:27:17] one glory to another Glory even as by
[1:27:20] the spirit of the Lord
[1:27:23] praise God ain't that right so I looked
[1:27:27] up the word understanding it means to
[1:27:29] grasp the meaning of to be thoroughly
[1:27:34] familiar with to have a clear or
[1:27:38] complete idea
[1:27:41] of oh man if there is ever a people that
[1:27:45] can understand the types and shadows
[1:27:48] it's a group of people that's in the
[1:27:51] believer in this
[1:27:53] message it's the believer of this hour
[1:27:56] that is beginning and I believe that's
[1:27:59] already got the grasp that thoroughly
[1:28:03] understands the meaning of these
[1:28:06] things when Jesus appeared to the men on
[1:28:09] the road to Emmas Luke 24:16 says Their
[1:28:13] Eyes Were Holden that they should not
[1:28:14] know him in other words they had no
[1:28:17] understanding of who he was and and and
[1:28:20] yet they were talking to him they were
[1:28:22] talking to Jesus about
[1:28:27] Jesus right but their
[1:28:31] talking and their understanding of him
[1:28:34] was that he's
[1:28:36] dead all hope is
[1:28:39] gone this man is a
[1:28:41] stranger ain't that right and yet the
[1:28:44] very one they're talking about is there
[1:28:47] in their midst yes amen but their eyes
[1:28:50] were withholding to where they couldn't
[1:28:53] understand see amen and and yet he was
[1:28:56] alive and and so so if you go down to
[1:28:59] the 30th verse it says and it came to
[1:29:01] pass as he sat at meat with them he took
[1:29:04] bread and blessed it and break and gave
[1:29:06] it to them and their eyes were opened
[1:29:10] and they knew
[1:29:11] him oh in all thine understanding get
[1:29:15] get get and all thy getting get
[1:29:18] understanding and they knew him
[1:29:22] when their eyes were open see so what it
[1:29:25] was brother Brown said he opened their
[1:29:28] understanding if you look in genes or
[1:29:31] where Jesus and speaking to the
[1:29:32] Pharisees he said oh you blind
[1:29:35] guides see he called them blind because
[1:29:37] they had no understanding of who he was
[1:29:40] they had no understanding of the day
[1:29:41] that they were living in they didn't
[1:29:43] have understanding of the word being
[1:29:45] fulfilled ain't that right so the word
[1:29:48] of the hour meant nothing to them
[1:29:52] the word the thing that God was doing
[1:29:55] right in their midst meant nothing to
[1:29:57] them because they didn't understand it
[1:29:59] and the prophet said they had the wrong
[1:30:01] interpretation and understanding yep
[1:30:04] they had the scriptures amen and they
[1:30:07] they they they sung the songs they read
[1:30:09] the quotes they done it all but they had
[1:30:11] the wrong interpretation and
[1:30:14] understanding of the scripture amen yes
[1:30:17] sir so they were looking at God in a
[1:30:20] past day that's right look at at God in
[1:30:22] the future and Miss what God was doing
[1:30:25] right then that's right ain't that right
[1:30:28] so now notice as we try to hurry along
[1:30:30] now won't keep you much longer God look
[1:30:33] at look at the analysis that God gives
[1:30:35] this layout see in church and what what
[1:30:38] it is wretched miserable naked blind
[1:30:41] blind right and knoweth it
[1:30:45] not in other words without understanding
[1:30:48] and if you look Revelations 3:20 Jesus
[1:30:51] Jesus says behold I stand at the door
[1:30:53] and knock standing at the door and
[1:30:56] knocking and if any man will hear my
[1:30:58] voice and open the door I will come into
[1:31:00] him and will sub with him and he with me
[1:31:03] ain't that right in other words he he
[1:31:06] wants to do what he' done to the two on
[1:31:08] the road to emus that when he went into
[1:31:11] that room and he began to S with him and
[1:31:13] he began to break the bread whatever he
[1:31:16] done it opened the eyes of their
[1:31:20] understanding can you say man but we
[1:31:23] find here that he was kicked out of the
[1:31:25] church his own church and he's trying to
[1:31:28] get in now notice this fits with Romans
[1:31:31] the first chapter Paul speaks of a
[1:31:34] people who did not like to retain God in
[1:31:36] their knowledge therefore they are
[1:31:38] without understanding that's what Paul
[1:31:41] says they did not like to retain God in
[1:31:43] their knowledge they didn't want to
[1:31:46] retain the word for their age in in in
[1:31:48] their knowledge oh they imputed
[1:31:51] knowledge all right Creeds and dogmas
[1:31:54] and what this theology said and this
[1:31:56] Theologian and Dr so and so
[1:31:59] said but in all reality they were they
[1:32:01] were just
[1:32:03] misinterpretations yes man's own
[1:32:07] ideas and they didn't want to retain God
[1:32:10] in their knowledge so therefore Paul
[1:32:12] said they're without
[1:32:14] understanding can you say Amen so we see
[1:32:17] this scripture being fulfilled in this
[1:32:19] day wretched miserable blind naked and
[1:32:21] don't understand that they are in this
[1:32:24] condition now notice brother Brown says
[1:32:26] people through Traditions has blinded
[1:32:28] men from the great fundamental truths of
[1:32:30] the scriptures another place the
[1:32:33] Pharisees was keeping up their
[1:32:34] Traditions but behind their Traditions
[1:32:37] were the true word of God coming to
[1:32:38] shine forth and when it did it blinded
[1:32:41] their eyes they couldn't see it because
[1:32:42] they was watching something else I say
[1:32:45] to you Church don't look to the left or
[1:32:47] right no matter what comes or goes don't
[1:32:50] don't listen to the voices
[1:32:52] stay with what the voice of God is for
[1:32:55] today can you say Amen see so he says in
[1:32:59] another place Creeds and traditions in
[1:33:01] their blinded condition had turned them
[1:33:03] from the True Light of the promised word
[1:33:06] the word that God had indicated by Jesus
[1:33:08] the light of the world came and made
[1:33:10] that word live right exactly through his
[1:33:13] time see and so he says Traditions has
[1:33:17] blinded the people again to these great
[1:33:18] things that's been
[1:33:20] prophesied he says another place the
[1:33:22] reason that they failed to recognize
[1:33:24] Jesus being the Son of God is their
[1:33:26] Traditions had blinded their eyes but he
[1:33:28] was exactly with the
[1:33:30] scriptures hello amen he was exactly so
[1:33:34] notice what Jesus said in Revelations
[1:33:37] 3:18 I counsel thee he's talking to this
[1:33:39] age I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:33:42] tried in the fire that thou may be rich
[1:33:45] I and and white rment that thou may be
[1:33:47] clothed and and and that that the shame
[1:33:49] of thy nakedness does not appear and and
[1:33:52] anoint thine eyes with isab that thou
[1:33:55] may see or that thou mayest
[1:33:58] understand ain't that right Glory see if
[1:34:01] they if if they would just only anoint
[1:34:03] their eyes with Isa they would know who
[1:34:05] he is in this age see and and and to
[1:34:08] think of it out of all the seven Church
[1:34:10] ages he has not made himself known until
[1:34:12] this age this is the only age that he's
[1:34:15] made himself known that we actually see
[1:34:18] him in the church age but he's he's
[1:34:20] outside the church because his own
[1:34:24] church kicks him
[1:34:27] out it doesn't mean that they just all
[1:34:29] stop being religious they're more
[1:34:31] religious than they have ever been yeah
[1:34:33] that's right but they have no
[1:34:35] understanding of the
[1:34:37] word so he's out trying to get in can
[1:34:41] you say Amen see so so what we're seeing
[1:34:45] is this is the this is the Fulfillment
[1:34:47] of Revelations uh or Luke 17:30 the
[1:34:50] revealing of the son of man the word
[1:34:52] made flesh and to show that it's
[1:34:56] him first of all he has his picture
[1:34:58] taken with a prophet yes that ain't a
[1:35:01] that ain't a make belief that's
[1:35:03] God in a pillar of fire amen and another
[1:35:08] thing to show that it's him he does the
[1:35:11] same
[1:35:13] sign that he did when he appeared as mzc
[1:35:16] to Abraham in the Old
[1:35:19] Testament he comes and does the same
[1:35:21] thing in this
[1:35:23] age showing that it's him can you say
[1:35:27] amen and the church world has cast him
[1:35:30] out which proves that they have no
[1:35:32] understanding brother Ram said see
[1:35:34] blinded by man's tradition they put him
[1:35:36] out the word out of their churches as
[1:35:40] usual as prophesied of them see so what
[1:35:44] what's happening today let's just put it
[1:35:46] down in plain English the message isn't
[1:35:49] fitting for churches today
[1:35:52] signs and wonders isn't fitting for
[1:35:54] their churches all that you know that
[1:35:56] screaming hollering blabbing blabbering
[1:35:59] acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks
[1:36:02] they are right isn't fitting for the
[1:36:04] house of worship anymore even to this
[1:36:06] this pillar this picture isn't fitting
[1:36:08] for the house of God in anymore see they
[1:36:12] they they kick him out and I sent the
[1:36:13] quote to y'all where brother Brown said
[1:36:15] even that picture should shake the
[1:36:17] Nations that picture right there should
[1:36:18] have shook the nations of the world yeah
[1:36:22] and people in this message now claiming
[1:36:24] that that's not fitting for the house of
[1:36:26] God leads people to idolatry I say it's
[1:36:30] without
[1:36:31] understanding that's what it is it's
[1:36:33] it's without understanding and because
[1:36:35] of that they kick it out they ain't got
[1:36:38] room for the power of God they ain't got
[1:36:40] room for the Lord to move and to fulfill
[1:36:43] his
[1:36:48] word Traditions have blinded them can
[1:36:51] you see amen sure so here we are we
[1:36:54] we've been All Through the
[1:36:56] Ages twisted up by traditions and
[1:36:59] Theology and man's lies and
[1:37:03] Corruption we know this scripture very
[1:37:05] well I'll read it it though Revelations
[1:37:08] 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:37:11] down from heaven notice what he's going
[1:37:13] to do
[1:37:15] now why coming down clothed with a cloud
[1:37:19] and a rainbow was upon his head and face
[1:37:21] was as it were the sun his feet as
[1:37:23] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:37:26] little open
[1:37:27] book and he set his right foot upon the
[1:37:29] sea and his left foot upon the Earth and
[1:37:31] he cried with a loud
[1:37:33] voice can you say Amen as when a lion
[1:37:37] Roth and when he had cried seven
[1:37:40] Thunders uttered their voices now I this
[1:37:44] that scripture I believe is tied to to
[1:37:49] Ephesians 1 and8
[1:37:51] where Paul says this wherein he hath
[1:37:55] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:37:58] Prudence Hallelujah can you say that
[1:38:00] with me all wisdom and
[1:38:03] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:38:06] mystery of his
[1:38:08] will ain't that right what's he doing
[1:38:11] he's coming to give us
[1:38:16] understanding according to his good
[1:38:18] pleasure which Heath purposed in himself
[1:38:20] I look up that word Prudence it means to
[1:38:23] have understanding a quickness of
[1:38:26] apprehension he's abounded toward us
[1:38:30] with understanding he couldn't send us a
[1:38:35] theologian theologians don't know
[1:38:40] nothing amen can you say Amen so right
[1:38:43] after that in the 10th verse or the
[1:38:46] seventh verse 10th chapter but in the
[1:38:49] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:38:51] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:38:52] of God should be
[1:38:54] finished no longer a
[1:38:57] mystery no longer kept
[1:39:01] hid but an understanding would come at
[1:39:05] the sounding of that seventh
[1:39:08] angel can you say Amen notice what the
[1:39:11] prophet said the lamb took that book
[1:39:14] Glory says opened the book and tore off
[1:39:18] the seals and sent it down to the Earth
[1:39:20] to his seventh Angel to reveal it to his
[1:39:23] people his elect this message won't mean
[1:39:27] nothing to anyone else but it does to
[1:39:29] the
[1:39:30] elect ain't that right CU we're looking
[1:39:34] at it now it's our
[1:39:38] understanding brother R said see he
[1:39:39] comes forth to take the book now watch
[1:39:42] to reveal the mysteries of God that
[1:39:45] others have guessed at in all these
[1:39:47] denominational ages see then the seven
[1:39:51] Angel if this book mystery is the word
[1:39:53] of God the seventh angel has to be a
[1:39:56] prophet for the word of God to come
[1:40:01] to and God Vindicated him as that
[1:40:05] prophet of Malachi
[1:40:07] 4 can you say
[1:40:10] Amen can I ask you this as we get ready
[1:40:13] close what good would it be for the
[1:40:15] seventh angel to come and reveal the
[1:40:17] Mysteries why why would he come why
[1:40:20] would God protect protect
[1:40:22] him you know how it is you you've heard
[1:40:25] his life
[1:40:26] story sir that when he was what just
[1:40:30] just a
[1:40:31] baby there just born that little old
[1:40:34] cabin it was dark and the only there was
[1:40:37] no light in that
[1:40:39] room and the light Shone through that
[1:40:43] window then two years
[1:40:46] old that voice from that tree says don't
[1:40:48] you ever drink or smoke or defile your
[1:40:50] body two years or was it 2 years old
[1:40:54] maybe he saw the the the the the bridge
[1:40:56] at 2 years old but then at at another
[1:40:59] time somewhere as a boy as he's packing
[1:41:02] the Moonshine for his his his daddy says
[1:41:06] that voice from that tree says don't you
[1:41:08] ever drink or smoke or or defile your
[1:41:10] body uh with women you know in any way
[1:41:13] because there'll be a work for you to
[1:41:14] get old when you get older and what
[1:41:17] happened Satan tempted him he almost lit
[1:41:19] up that cigarette yeah and he heard
[1:41:24] a throwed it away and took off running
[1:41:27] crying his dad called him a and he
[1:41:30] tried to he said give me that bottle and
[1:41:32] he tried to put it up to his mouth and
[1:41:34] that
[1:41:36] Whirlwind God kept
[1:41:39] him why because it was a seventh
[1:41:42] angel that someday he would come and he
[1:41:45] would grow into his ministry and and the
[1:41:47] lamb would come and take that book and
[1:41:49] reveal it to him
[1:41:51] that he could reveal it to us why why
[1:41:54] would God so protect that Ministry for
[1:41:57] us well brother brandham says this his
[1:42:01] message called The Bride out of the
[1:42:04] Pentecostal
[1:42:07] Traditions the message of the seventh
[1:42:09] angel called us
[1:42:11] out yes of the things that would blind
[1:42:15] us to where we couldn't see him we
[1:42:17] couldn't understand thank you Lord Jesus
[1:42:22] and when we got called out of it it
[1:42:24] opened our
[1:42:26] eyes we can understand who we
[1:42:30] are brother Braham said see the seventh
[1:42:33] Angel's message under the seven same
[1:42:35] trumpet same everything exactly the same
[1:42:37] seal is to what call the people the
[1:42:40] bride out of the Pentecostal and World
[1:42:42] tradition to the genuine atonement the
[1:42:44] word oh my think of that the genuine
[1:42:48] atonement where's the atonement it's the
[1:42:50] blood the life the bloody bleeding
[1:42:55] word it's washed is
[1:42:59] clean he said see Christ impersonated in
[1:43:02] his word here made flesh Among Us and
[1:43:05] science has proved it by
[1:43:07] pictures science proved it right see so
[1:43:12] we could say the lamb has come the
[1:43:16] mighty Angel has abounded toward us in
[1:43:20] all wisdom and Prudence understanding
[1:43:24] with an open book it's no longer
[1:43:26] closed traditions and all that can't
[1:43:29] keep it from us we can look in the word
[1:43:31] and begin to see ourselves cuz is this
[1:43:33] not when the book opened the lamb opened
[1:43:36] the book that John looked and saw his
[1:43:38] name in the book saw himself he began to
[1:43:43] understand his
[1:43:45] position then they tell us we can't
[1:43:47] shout we can't scream we can't get happy
[1:43:54] oh I love the
[1:43:57] Lord John 16:12 says I have yet many
[1:44:01] things to say to you Jesus tells them
[1:44:03] but you cannot bear them now in other
[1:44:05] words you cannot understand it but how
[1:44:07] be it when he the spirit of Truth has
[1:44:09] come he'll guide you into all truth so
[1:44:11] brother bradam quotes this this
[1:44:13] scripture and then he says this the holy
[1:44:15] spirit always speaks of the word see
[1:44:18] I've got many things to tell you you
[1:44:19] cannot understand understand it see now
[1:44:22] but when he comes he will guide you to
[1:44:25] it that's the reason the coming of the
[1:44:29] seals at the finishing of the seventh
[1:44:32] seal the mystery of God should be
[1:44:33] finished to know who God is and what he
[1:44:37] is and how he lives and his nature and
[1:44:39] his being he said see you're you're
[1:44:41] you're supposed to be all the way up
[1:44:43] here by that time to bring us into full
[1:44:46] statures and Son of Sons and Daughters
[1:44:49] of God a church that's washed in the
[1:44:52] blood of Christ that's bought without
[1:44:53] money it's paid for by the blood of
[1:44:56] Christ he said and all this time the
[1:44:59] mystery of God should be finished who
[1:45:02] God is and how he is made manifest and
[1:45:05] how when that seal was open how we begin
[1:45:08] to understand now how that he was the
[1:45:11] son of God he was God himself made flesh
[1:45:13] and the revelation of who he is can you
[1:45:15] say man if the musicians will come thank
[1:45:18] you for your patience tonight praise God
[1:45:22] wonderful in the in the um uh s what
[1:45:27] time is
[1:45:30] it brother brandom named several
[1:45:32] Mysteries just some of
[1:45:35] them that is supposed to be revealed by
[1:45:38] the seventh
[1:45:40] angel and I just listed some of them and
[1:45:44] like the mystery of the translation of
[1:45:47] the living Saints at the end time of
[1:45:49] this age we we we had no
[1:45:52] understanding but because of this
[1:45:54] message our understanding
[1:45:58] has is opened amen wonderful The Mystery
[1:46:03] of the new church Testament Church as
