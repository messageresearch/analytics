here in the house of the Lord the Lord and it's a beautiful day today amen so we uh take all we can get amen and uh uh the musicians can be dismissed uh if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Hebrews the third chapter and uh it's good to have everyone that was gone over the weekend back with us us amen and um we don't get to uh see brother John too much on Wednesday nights but uh certainly good to have him amen and um different ones are sick and uh so we want to just keep um them in our prayer that the Lord will just touch them and with his healing power and we certainly know the Lord will and and um cares for his people don't he amen amen uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord amen father we stand here tonight Lord in need of you and asking father that you would just come in a special way and you know every need that is present and Lord you know how to meet the needs those that aren't able to come Lord for whatever reason it would be I pray that you would protect them and keep them heal them raise them up father Lord I pray now that you would anoint the the the ministering of your word the hearing of your word father Lord for we're needing you it's a late hour and God uh asking that you would encourage the hearts tonight and Lord give us a greater Revelation Lord uh you you have open the Mysteries to us we don't need another Prophet to come Lord everything that is uh needs to be revealed has been revealed but now Lord let it just be quickened in our hearts Lord father and let it burn within us I pray and let it become a personal revelation ation we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen praise the Lord um the the book of Hebrews the the third chapter the first verse third chapter first verse of Hebrews it says wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus then uh the next chapter chapter 4 and 14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession amen you can have your seats tonight I want to continue just talking about our high priest and um I'm truly amazed at the the grace of God um you know that that God has shown to us as as Believers as we know that the the grace of God is something that is UNM merited uh something that um uh we we certainly don't deserve so anything that God provides for us and gives us uh you know is an act of Grace on his part thank Jes anything that he gives us outside of what we deserve it's an act of Grace and I I I tell you you know we we certainly don't deserve anything but hell torment and anguish uh we we we don't deserve anything but but that but the grace of God has been to us and and we are certainly deserving of the worst that God could give and uh which would be the ultimate that uh would be exceeding of of of anything that anybody could do horrific to us right uh uh we we deserve that yeah and we deserve the worst because of sin we're we're Sinners uh born in sin and having a vow nature that was contrary to God against God and uh we have uh we've broken every law that he would have and um because there in James 2:10 it says whosoever shall keep the law or keep the whole law and yet offend in one point then he's a guilty of it all and so we may not have murdered or whatever but just the fact that we've might have told a lie or even a white lie or and and and and you know things that may not even matter to us in the presence of God it it is magnified and so then we find ourselves that we're just guilty we're guilty of it all and in the beginning you know uh that's that's the the the start of of everything is the SE chapter is in Genesis and uh we we see where God had told man now don't eat of of this uh uh forbidden fruit and told him that the day that he would eat of that that would be the the day he would die and so it happened just the way God said it man partook of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and and he died and and of course uh Paul would tell us that the wages of sin is death and so we had nothing to look forward to to be honest but but just but but death uh uh because God cannot go back on his word he's infinite he has infinite knowledge and and so uh he's Eternal so brother Bram would say the the way that God acts upon the subjects that accept his decision it'll forever uh act every on every subject that accept his decision that way so if if God uh made a way for man to be saved the first way he made uh then has to ever remain that same way if God promised healing to the sick upon Faith to believe it then it ever Remains the Same see CU he cannot take it back he he must remain uh the the same in in every way ain't that right so so God could not take his word back but there was something something that God uh that CS God and I'm so glad that God is not just a god of Holiness and God of Wrath but he's a he's a god of longsuffering he's a god of patience he's a he's a god of love and the Bible says God is love and so it it would be from from there that God uh uh would seek to have seek a remedy and and it it was that God in the garden accepted a substitute for man and and so this word substitute is to take the place of another to to replace ain't that right that's right so we know that though that this substitute had to be a blood sacrifice it it had to be uh a blood sacrifice that would pay uh for the sins of the people or or pay for sin the price of sin uh God's word cannot be uh uh uh changed uh but he would he would provide a a substitute amen and and and he he didn't want us just to be religious wasn't calling uh uh for a form of godliness but he was he was calling for something that would reconcile us back to God to where that that word of condemnation would be lifted from us and that we could be free to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen so this blood sacrifice amen God says I I I will have that I will you know I will accept accept the blood sacrifice uh uh as a substitute which means that this substitute would be our pardon amen this blood sacrifice would be our pardon ain't that right and and if you listen to the message pardon you know brother brandham talks about this but he says pardon is a release from guilt amen and that's what God sought in and again this is the act of Grace on God's part that God would seek to Pardon you he and and me he he would he would seek for something that that uh would take our place that you and I could could be free ain't that right so the Christian life is not about dos and don'ts the Christian life is not about you know it's not all about uh what we do what we don't how we live and how we dress and and all of these things and what we abstain from and and all these things simply put the the Christian Life life is the result of a man or woman child being pardoned amen you you can't be a Christian without being pardoned amen so God would seek to Pardon us and and and again that would be an an act of Grace something given to us provided to us that we don't deserve ain't that right it's always been the grace of God throughout the Bible uh uh he he even the you know uh I think it was Paul said where sin do abound Grace doth more abound so even down through the law uh uh when when when they chose law over Grace God still provided Grace amen Grace was always with them amen and and so sin uh sin could not obliviate or hide Grace it it it was just the the grace of God ain't that right so we know that Jesus Christ is our sub substitute that God would provide for us and and so even though that God has done everything he could to to to Pardon us and and to provide a pardon well we know that a pardon is not a paron unless accept it as a pardon so so you you have to receive that pardon and I I think that is is important that that not only God would accept the sacrifice but you and I have to accept that sacrifice amen and and so um uh brother bam said you are pardoned the very minute that you accept Jesus Christ as your savior aren't you glad you're pardon amen you you have to accept that God's provided it but now when you accept that sacrifice then you are pardoned amen so so accepting the sacrifice that God provided is very important and and then when we accept the sacrifice then we confess him as our savior we confess him as our healer we confess him as our Lord we confess him as as our deliverer we we we we uh uh confess him as our peace ain't that right because we have identified that he is our substitute and if God will accept it then we must accept it upon that basis ain't that right he is our peace aren't you glad for that he is our joy he is our everything everything that that that sin had laid upon us and we were Afflicted of because of sin our blood sacrifice amen through the pardoning grace took it all away from us that we could accept God's provided place or provided way ain't that right so now now now he becomes the the high priest of our confession amen and I'd like to get into that more uh uh next time of the high priest of our confession but but see God providing a substitute is not just an afterthought uh uh sin come along now God seeson says now now what next you know I I I I got to do something so he provides the The Substitute but the Bible says that Jesus was slain as the L am before the foundation of the world so that tells us that God already knew our condition he already knew that man would fall he already knew it was part of his plan that he already had a provided substitute a sacrifice for you and I amen you know man was not made to die and you know you hear the prophet saying you know that man was not made to go to hell amen and and the hell the the Bible says hell was created for the devil and his angels and and all of these things ain't that right so God knowing that that that that he did not create hell amen for his people and for his elect he would provide a bloody sacrifice God's always one step ahead or probably well we could say a thousand steps ahead of them then than us ain't that right he already knows the end from the beginning it it it in all we have to do is is trust in him but but it's always been blood and the prophet said it was blood in the Old Testament it and it was blood in the New Testament it's it's it's just blood all the way around amen and he said the only way that God receives his children back is by this Blood substitute nothing else will do ain't that right amen so you you would think that every man would be thankful for God's provision Vision uh uh but but that's not so uh because it's in man it's it's that Fallen nature of man to do everything that he can to be part of it he he he wants to have a say in it he wants to have something to do with it and and so that that that's just him and he's always tried to do something on his own outside of God's uh uh uh provided way and therefore he he remains dead and we know what dead means it it means separation so he he remains separated from God and and and he remains without fellowship and peace and contentment and no understanding of God's perfect will amen because he's out of of of he's well he's dead he's separated from God so he cannot see himself in God's promises uh because he's out of Fellowship he's cut off from God ain't that right but see this is why God would provide a pardon for us this is why he would provide a a a a bloody sacrifice for us to have our pardon to come back into fellowship and and and and just going to church don't mean you're in fellowship with God Amen and even just praying don't mean you're in fellowship with God there has to be a heart Union there there has to be some Union that that really takes place a binding of man's soul to God Amen to where there's nothing in the way sin ain't in the way uh condemnation ain't in the way you're actually in fellowship with God Amen conscience of his presence conscience of his awareness can you say man but see man wants to Merit his own way to God and and his Fallen nature causes him to seek his own way just like Adam did amen as soon as he fail and uh uh what does he do he goes after amen trying to uh uh uh uh uh find his own covering sewing fig leaves together uh thinking that it would hide his shame and and if you notice this is why the law came into existence in the first place is because man wanted his own way he he wanted to to to walk with God on his own Merit and his own way he thinking he could peas appease God and and and live good enough to be reconciled to God and and all these things they wanted something to do on their own in the Bible we see that there's two covenants amen uh that God made um uh and and really it was the the conditional Covenant and and the unconditional Covenant and and uh the word testament uh uh means Covenant and and so we've got two uh Testaments the the old uh testament which is is represents or which is the old Covenant the law and we've got the new testament which is the Covenant of Grace it's an unconditional Covenant ain't that right amen so the old Covenant it's a conditional Covenant where where you know the prophet said you know it's like God says if you'll do this then I'll do this and if you do that then I'll do that and and and see it was that way and so this Covenant a conditional Covenant came about because man wanted to enter into partnership with with God and and so again he wanted to something to do on his own that he could Merit his way to God Amen but then there's that New Covenant amen which is the unconditional Covenant and and uh uh it's it's an unconditional Covenant and it is guaranteed it by say it's guaranteed this Covenant is guaranteed to us because it's unconditional ain't that right it's unconditional and being that is it is unconditional Covenant then it's not based upon what we do or what we don't do it's solely an act of Grace on God's part this unconditional Covenant God made with us knowing that we could not keep he tried to keep uh uh have a a conditional Covenant with man and every time that God would make a conditional Covenant with man it would be broken and it would not be broken on God's part it was always man breaking his own Covenant can you say amen amen see but this unconditional Covenant is based upon what God would do himself amen now look and and this show shows God's de determination and desire amen for you and I to walk with him amen and and uh uh in Genesis 3:15 God said I I will see put enity between thee and and the uh the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel ain't that right God see and and the prophet said right there God was promising amen a redeemer he already knew how that Redeemer was going to come and it wasn't up to woman it wasn't up to man to to produce a redeemer God promised he would bring it God produced it ain't that right but he said to Noah in Genesis 9:11 I will establish my Covenant with you he said to Abraham in Genesis 12:2 I will make thee a great nation and and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing God said in Genesis 13:16 I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise and walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee and of Sarah he said I will bless her and give her give thee a son also of her yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations and kings of people shall be of her ain't that right on and on throughout the Bible we see that God was promising I will do it I will perform I have spoken I have said it can you say amen amen I will sin amen see so therefore amen God never obligated us to any promise that he made he just made us the beneficiary of the promise Pro can you say man he made us the beneficiary he's the one that said I will send unto you Elijah the prophet we never knew we needed a prophet amen we had no uh desire for a prophet we weren't praying for a prophet amen we we didn't deserve a prophet but the prophet says God by his grace always sends a prophet when a prophet comes on the scene it's the act of God's grace to a people ain't that right that God promised it so so see everything amen that God promised ye we're looking at it now he's already done it amen think of it in this age we're looking back at Calvary and every promise that he has fulfilled Amen to bring a people to Redemption he's already done it amen we're looking at Christ based upon the finished works of Calvary aren't you glad for that now think of it it's not that we're waiting for him to do it go go look look at it he done it really before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world ain't that right and and and it was on God's desire God's part it was it was his love it was his desire we didn't have a choice I I didn't even exist a you didn't even exist you weren't even allowed to vote for it brother Amos that God had already taken care of it amen for the Bible says he predestinated us amen ain't that right those he fornew he predestinated and those he predestinated he called and though he called he justified and them that he justified he's already glorified can you say Amen see so why would God now if he's already taken care of it then why would he put us on a conditional Covenant because a conditional Covenant can never guarantee you amen into heaven it will never guarantee you of any promise of God Amen but he done it based upon an unconditional Covenant he purposed within himself to see you through praise the Lord praise the Lord so a conditional Covenant can be broken but an unconditional Covenant is one that cannot be broken ain't that right for the Bible says God is not a man that he should lie or nor the son of man that he should repent another place it is impossible for God to lie ain't that right so the prophet said see God turned men and women back to the dust of the Earth from where they came see they go right back and someday he's promised everybody say he's promised amen he he it the situation does not matter with God he promised amen that that again to redeem that body back to its original state he will do it everybody say he will do it God will do it oh my doesn't matter if they're just a pile of Ashes God will restore that body doesn't matter if they're just dust and there ain't no bones left a sign a trace of human amen but God will bring that body back amen because he promised to bring it yes sir nothing's impossible amen that's why he can make an unconditional Covenant with you cuz he he's a god of imp that works an impossib ities he's over everything all he has to do is speak his word that's right yes sir for him to make an unconditional Covenant with you shows that he don't need help he don't need the the president's help he don't needs King's help he doesn't need government's help he doesn't need them to to to to lower the prices on the gas and the food and and the rent and all of that to take care of you God can provide it when there's no other way to have for it to happen true and he made an unconditional Covenant amen that's good anytime that God makes this unconditional Covenant it's always broken this this this conditional Covenant right but the prophet said God God God made an unconditional Covenant because he determined to save man praise the Lord aren't you glad that he's determined he's he's more determined than you are amen amen so it's a Grace Covenant so in in that Covenant God provided a substitute not not law but but in that unconditional Covenant God would provide a substitute which which is God incarnated in Jesus Christ praise the Lord ain't that right see the law being a conditional covenant could not guarantee us to any promise of God as we've said before for it had no saving power the prophet said it only makes us sinners it condemned us put us in prison and could not take us out amen the prophet says the law says you are a sinner Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery thou shallal not bear false witness see it's a policeman that says you're wrong and you're guilty ain't that right but it doesn't only just say you're guilty it actually puts you into prison with no of coming out ain't that right so through this conditional Covenant of of of of the law it's it's hard to see predestination and election uh see When sin is magnified and that's exactly what law done is it just magnified sin and we we we we understood that we're Sinners by law ain't that right see and and so so and and it's the law that is what Mak the Pharisees and Sadducees it it's it's the law that is what blinded their eyes and caused them to crucify the Messiah it it's the law that calls them not to recognize their day of visitation ain't that right because they were trying to do something on their own God was providing it all the way through if they would have just Ste with Grace amen and just watch God move for them it would have been easy for them to receive Messiah when he came but they were so up in their ideas and their uh denominations and their Theology and their own works and their own way of doing things that when God would provide by Grace they they they totally missed it there a Prophet says in this Grace Covenant there is absolutely no law whatsoever right the Grace Covenant has no law in it at all he said can you sayen the Lord so see I I I didn't have to you didn't have to produce anything but God through this unconditional Covenant provided it praise the lord it's it's through this Covenant of Grace that produced Jesus Christ praise the Lord law didn't it was the Covenant of Grace can you say man and and not only did it produce Jesus Christ it has produced a bride for Jesus Christ in this day Miss Jesus Christ it's a miracle that you exist in this age but Grace done it it's not just a name that is tagged upon us it's a reality you realize how special you are no one can produce a Miss Jesus Christ not even yourself amen look at even your faults and your failures and and everything goes against it but Grace produced it dou on now under the old Covenant there was the little levitical or ironic priesthood as we've said and no man could be a priest unless he was of the tribe of Le Levi and they were priests by lineage and so uh uh and these men had to be holy uh in in very strict and in things but they didn't have to be called they didn't have to be ordained to it per se uh um you know they just had to be of a lineage of the tribe of Levi and and it and it just became um something that that it was just automatically done and and it just become a tradition just become a thing well I'm a you know and just like maybe some of people think well just because my dad's a preacher I'm going to make it or or even even you know we could even go to a prophet's children you know they got to have a birth just like a prophet did see there's no lineage in this thing you understand what I'm saying no lineage my children's got to have a new birth just like everybody else does and I had to have a new birth just like my dad did it ain't lineage on Amen and and and so but these priests were by lineage and and and yet even though they they were require ired to be perfect in that they kept the law and everything on the outside yet they they were men that had infirmity and and Hebrews 7:28 Paul would tell us the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity and and they had to offer sacrifices not only for the sins of the people but they had to offer sacrifices even for themselves because it was just a priesthood of men can you say Amen but but Paul would show the the difference in in the two priesthoods of of of the the levitical and and then Christ as as our high priest uh there and and Hebrews 7:23 and they they were uh they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth forever ha an unchangeable priesthood notice wherefore he is able to save uh also to save them to the uttermost that come into unto God by him seeing that he ever liveth to make intercession for him now this is the scriptures is it not he liveth and abideth forever and because he liveth and abideth forever he's able to save to the uttermost even to this layot ofy and a then what a slap into God's face when they say the days of Miracles is over and and the days of healing and and the Holy Ghost and and and the power of God Amen is is over if it's over then he has been finished but he's not dead and that's the message of the hour is to prove that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever and we've got a promise that he's able to save to the uttermost it doesn't matter how low you are it doesn't matter how Fallen your children are he's able to save because he's the same God he ever liveth it doesn't change priesthoods with him amen can you say Amen come on now and notice he ever liveth everybody say he ever liveth ever live to make intercession for them make inter he ever liveth to make intercession for him one day you could in the levitical maybe you had a good priest that really took it to heart and maybe the other when he passed his son would come along and he really didn't take it to heart he was just kind of SPO he was just he would rather be the carpenter he would rather be out on the lake fishing or whatever but he had to maintain because he was of the lineage of Levi ain't that right so so he didn't take things to heart you understand what I'm saying but Christ took you to heart that's right now he maketh he ever liveth to make intercession for them the Greek daglock says to interpose on their behalf praise the Lord he lives to interpose on their behalf and and I looked up this word interpose it means to put oneself in between to intrude to put forth by way of interference to introduce or throw into between the parts of an argument see or conversation so you got two people amen that are at odds with one another and and of course that would be us and God ain't that right and you know we're going to be on that receiving end more than he's going to be on the receiving end you can you can cuss God curse God deny God whatever amen but when all when it's said and done he's got the final say ain't that right amen and just about when we were to feel his wrath and and all of these things then God provides a high priest that would interject himself hallelujah praise the Lord maybe you don't believe that but he does the Lord he puts himself between God and us and begins to mediate for us amen hello yes sir yes sir come on and this is one that knows the law he knows the book he knows the the word amen he knows what has been promised could you imagine someone that didn't know the promises trying to mediate on your behalf sister Brenda now there's a lot of times we don't know the word of God there's a lot of times we don't understand things we Satan will mess with our mind but there's one that intercedes for us sure can you amen and so therefore Because He Lives there's no need for another priesthood to rise up we we don't need another sacrifice we don't need another priest and and and these things he is able to accomplish that which the levitical priesthood could not do ain't that right amen see so so as we know that the levitical priesthood and I'll try to hurry here but they had to keep offering sacrifices because the sacrifices they offered was not sufficient enough to to redeem man uh uh therefore that that priesthood of men it was a carnal priesthood and and it it it had to be abolished ain't that right sinful men uh uh there but but but we find that the the shadows and the symbols and it served its purpose until till the the anti-tip if we could say it that way the substitute was manifested and and then Paul would tell us in Hebrews 7:2 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the all now the Amplified Bible would tell us this way when there is a change in the priesthood there is of necess necessity a change of the law concerning the priesthood as well ain't that right amen see so so God would set the whole uh uh ju Judaism I guess we could say it that way aside when the substitute uh uh true came and and and uh so so so then Paul would tell us it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah ain't that right which of which tribes Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood so it tells us that he isn't a priest by a a The Works of a natural man amen that there isn't any man any human that could lay claim to his existence ain't that right amen see now we we look and and just just look here uh 2 Corinthians 5:21 he he he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin ain't that right 1 Peter 2:22 he did no sin neither was G found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not went but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own bear uh his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that being dead to send should live under righteousness by whose stripes we were healed you were healed ain't that right 1 John 3 and5 you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin what a what a different priesthood can you say man he he wasn't of a lineage of of just common born men there was no sin attached to him amen ain't that right the prophet Isaiah cried out he took our infirmity and bear our sickness see so he having no infirmities amen yet took our infirmities and nailed them as Paul would say to his cross ain't that right therefore he bore the likeness of MDC Glory ain't that right for he was MDC made flesh hlj ain't that right amen that's right see so so he was not only the word the prophet said but he was the high priest of his own word God was the high priest of his own word interceding over every promise he made for you right no wonder he can make it unconditional yeah come on now can you say Amen levitical priesthood was made up of men under the law as we talked about legalist carnal Commandments the law said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not Thou shalt not it you see and and and therefore uh it it was it was uh uh uh carnal Commandments the prophet said legalism legalist and that that's what these high priests come out of of is is they were made of carnal Commandments but Christ was not can you say Amen you know I know personally people that that that they they're in just the legalism you know they don't believe in wearing the Rings you know they they don't believe that you know man or a woman could wear a ring they don't believe a woman should wear a necklace they don't believe a man you know can wear short sleeve men have to wear long sleeves can't have a beard and and it just on and on and on you know there there's no limit to the laws that man will imp on us you know just thinking of here just in the message you know you know it it gets around you know you get you get just funny people if a gospel song is written that that isn't you know that's written by some unconverted guy out there then it shouldn't be sung in the church you know there are those who believe that if a song isn't an old hymn then it shouldn't be sung in the worship service you know it all needs to be old hyms and and you know you can't have certain instruments in the church and they can't be fast songs sung in in the church because it's just working people up but you know what it all is it's legalism it just come legalism legalism legalism and before you know it you got people fighting nitpicking they can't come to church to enjoy the service because they have set themselves to be one that was let's see what they're going to do next you know and I'm going to let them know about it you know and it just becomes a a a hey we we come out of all that see so we I know what I'm talking about but what happens if we give an inch to that kind of the spirit see well then what happens it dictates the church to where the people can't be free we we lose the fact that there's promises we lose the fact that God saved us by his grace we lose the fact that God is the one that have preeminent over his elect amen we lose the fact that it's not me that's keeping the church it's God that's keeping the church God keeping the church you see why because the the the church isn't made up of law right can you say man Christ wasn't made up of of law of the carnal Commandments and neither is the church made up of law of carnal Commandments amen see see so so notice now there had to be a change for the law made nothing perfect I've thought of that the the priesthood wasn't perfect the sacrifice wasn't perfect the the Tabernacle wasn't perfect the the blood wasn't perfect in that it wasn't sufficient ain't that right but here God had already swore and he promised that he would redeem a people he promised that he would take a people back with him he already promised that there's going to be Millennium look at Isaiah he he talks about the Millennium can you say amen he swore that he would have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish he swore that his people would be perfect and that he would be the one to perfect them right the Lord yeah can you say Amen so they wouldn't have to face his wrath that's coming upon the Earth brother this the wrath of God is is is is coming it it's approaching and it is very real can you say Amen we're not making lie of that but one thing about it we've been cleansed we've got a blood sacrifice that took away the sins amen oh aren't you glad for that amen see God see God predestinated Christ to be the bloody sacrifice and he was predestinated to be our great high priest and what was he then he was not made up of a natural lineage he was made up of the word of God do you believe that God created his own blood cell and would be powerful and and sufficient enough to save every one of his elect Lord save us completely can you amen prise the Lord uh Hebrews 7:18 it says by so much was Jesus made a shity of a better Covenant Jesus was made the high priest of a better Covenant amen aren't you glad for thaten the Greek daglock says that Jesus has become a pledge of a better Covenant amen God pledged him amen that's right amen swore by himself and there was Christ yeah amen ain't that right so we find that Jesus now Christ is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises ain't that right a better Covenant because it's an unconditional Covenant it's a perfect Covenant a perfect sacrifice a perfect blood that has brought forth a perfect loosening and it's all based upon predestination not b based upon what you do or what you don't do it's based upon predestination what God predestinated you to be Lord do you think of that now God called you before the foundation of the world he ordained you then he justified you then right glorified you then he's already had a predestinated end for you then can you amen and notice the Covenant the prophet said was written with his own blood right and then he goes into the presence of the father packing his own blood can you say Amen Allelujah yes sir amen you know in the days of Paul there were people who struggled to let go of the old and come into the new and he was trying to tell them there in Hebrews that that the the church had turned a corner and and um you know a lot of them wouldn't receive it but especially the Jewish the Jewish people they refuse to to turn the corner yeah and today uh the church has turned another Corner amen very important to understand that uh because you see the message is not dealing with the old ways of of churchianity Amen the message is not dealing with uh the ways of LA and legalism as brother brandham said this is the message of Grace and if you you go listen to the title of that is the message of Grace and listen to what he has to say it's the grace of God and that when The Headstone comes down the people would be crying Grace Grace unto The Headstone amen but it it it it was God turning the corner for the church can you say Amen see God God the prophet said is finished with the church ages do you believe that see so the days of signing our name on the church card are over the the the days of uh shaking a preacher's hand and and and joining the church that's that's over the days of being baptized into the church is over e every Creed and every uh uh Dogma that was put upon us that we would accept to be saved or to be considered a Christian amen that's old over the denominational ages have run out can you say Amen the prophet said now what made the denominations in the first place he says well one group picks up a little Doctrine and they run off to the side with it and say this is it another group picks up another doctorine and they run off to the side and says well this is it see and each one he says has built a denomination under it until we got hundreds of denomination and it's left nothing but the people confused to where they don't know what to believe can you say amen amen they they believe in in purgatory that is never in the Bible they believe in intercession of saints that's never in the Bible they believe in priests and popes and and and and and Bishops and and Cardinals and and and hierarchies and headquarters and this and that it's never been written in this Bible can you sayen it's been a dictate of men ruling over the people but the days of that is over thank the Lord can you say Amen thank you Lord Jesus that was the seven Church ages yeah and they represented The Seven Feast days brother Brian said there were seven feast days that represented the seven Church ages ain't that right yes now I have to be careful with this but you go listen to the Future home of the Earthly bride and Heavenly bridegroom amen brother Brown talks about the days and and and of course there's many uh weird do men men have come up with all kinds of doctrines with this but never the fact we would never know we would never know the eighth day that there was an eighth day for us if it had not been a prophet that would bring this so we must not shy from it right because men have turned it into all kinds of things and we understand you know that we're not in the Millennium right now hello but go back and listen to what brother Brown says about the eth day and and just go all the way through that that it's three hours long I think but go listen to it and just keep listening to it and listen to it there there is so much there that is promised to us and about our future and all these things but but brother Brandon brought out the scripture in Leviticus where it talks about the Holy convocation being the Eighth Day and remember he runs out of sevens and and and brother someone he said well you you might say well brother brand You' run out of sevens what are we going to do he goes oh no you know you've run out of days or whatever and he says oh no I haven't and he takes us back to Leviticus and he begins to read about the Holy convocation on the eighth day ain't that right well what is the Eighth Day and and he says it he goes well there's no we we all know that there's seven days in a week so there is no Eighth Day so he says the eighth day takes us all the way back to the first day right ain't that right and he says now what seven days which means pass away seven days have passed away he says see I have said we'll change to another eight days everybody say eight days deals with New Creation not old creation eight days is New Creation now in the Old Testament brother brand tells us that that Israel went through seven Church ages they went through seven days seven Church ages but at that at end when they run out there stood a new creation true the Old Law had passed away the old levitical priesthood passed away every the blood sacrifice as far as the natural sacrifices the natural priest and the natural Temple and the natural altar all of that passed away there was a new creation Jesus Christ God incarnate that's right can you say Amen the old passed away and a new creation knew he was not of the old creation he was the creation of God himself the prophet said God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in another place God the Creator created the blood cell in the womb of that woman knowing no man by seexual desire what a different priest can you say Amen see see so he says see and that blood cell developed into the man which was the son of God and through that unadulterated blood of the Son of God creative blood by Jehovah without sexual desire through the shedding of that blood on calvary's Cross redeems us from sin and sickness it was a new Dawning a new day a Dawning God was able to abolish the old by a new creation amen another place he says the great Jehovah came down and was made tangible by living in the body of his own son declaring and reconciling the world to himself God was nothing Christ was nothing short of God and God was nothing short of Christ the two together made the godhead bodily made a little lower than the angel so that he could suffer Angels cannot suffer Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in aren't you glad for that and with his own per blood we have been perfectly loosed aren't you glad for thatl God would make a creation and abolish the old so he can make another creation yes sir now notice another place brother Brown said it's through his holy blood that we now everybody say we we see have access to life and our sexual blood is dismissed and we have the blood of Jesus Christ that is greater than your sexual blood greater than your sinful blood that stands for an atonement making an atonement for our sins hallelujah oh man now if you go all the way to Revelations the last Church age Revelations 3:14 the lay odyssean age it declares that Jesus is the beginning of the creation of God praise the Lord and I'm going to close but it's in this day that he calls himself the author of the creation of God now notice what brother Brown said this is another creation yeah this has to do with the church amen this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride right as the spirit of God he came down and created in the womb Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born he said I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human oven oam supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing a body see but that would not have been produced see uh that would have that would not have produced the last atom for of him it was said Lo a body thou father has prepared for me see God not Mary provided that body see Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was of that new creation man and God met and join he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race can you say Amen now 2 Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation watch old things are passed away aren't you glad for that old things are passed away behold all things have become new see so man was of the old order or old creation that's what we were we were of that old order of the old or old creation but notice but now Paul would tell us we are now in Union with Christ and brother Brown said see now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God aren't you glad for that in reconciliation that blood having an atonement for our sins and perfectly loosening us to where that God does not see you as a sinner he sees you as perfect he does not see you as full of faults and full of of is use he sees you as what he called you to be his son and what he predestinated you to be now we have come into Union with him that's true Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works oh my which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so the doctrines of the church does not make you what you are that's right can you say Amen the law does not make you what you are legalism does not make you a bonified Christian then what makes you God Made You by [Applause] predestination it so now notice this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation amen this is exactly what it says it is the new New Creation amen it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh amen that's how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac lion but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation amen aren't you glad for that amen he says this is the true revelation of God that was his purpose see this was his purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when it all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure he all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his Purp purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass nothing to do with you it was all what he purposed in his heart can you say Amen now here we are amen God not dealing with with us through the the the law through the church ages this is totally a message of Grace amen so if I could say it this way the the keeping of the Sabbath is over the keeping of the law is over yeah brother Brown said see the the Sabbath speaks of the Old Law which was to pass away the keeping of a Sabbath which passed away or I have I or have I said see changed to another it didn't pass away it just changed from the Old Law of keeping a certain day of the week can you say Amen we've entered into another rest see so he says uh uh he said Isaiah the 19th Chapter see or 28:19 uh something like that uh precept must be upon precept here a little there a little hold fast to that which is good see for with stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and here is the rest see you enter notice what he says you enter into life not keeping a day or a shadow hello Paul said over there in Hebrews see you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience we don't pass into certain days and orders but you pass from death under eternal life not days and times you passed into eternity God doesn't save you then all of a sudden now you got to keep up with this and you got to keep up with that and you got to do this and you got to do that and all of these things hello church it's either in you or it's not the preacher ain't to keep you mom ain't to keep you deacons ain't to keep you if God can't keep you nothing can can you say amen he said see you've done past through time and dropped into eternity again not keeping of days and keeping of sabbaths and new moons and things like that but half pass change your form not annihilate it but pass from Death unto eternal life oh do you love him am isn't he wonderful if the musicians will come that's what's happened that what happened on the day of Pentecost brother Brown said it was on the Eighth Day first day of the week prise Lord that God come and Quicken that predestinated seed am Hallelujah he done something new didn't he that's right amen he did something outside of the law yeah he did out something outside of their denominations he started it himself that which he predestinated to be that which he determined to be he did it amen amen praise the Lord it was on that eighth day that the quickening power of God Quicken that predestinated seat of God that was put in them before the foundation of the world Amen and that church the church the true church was birthed by the what Paul would call what was that the endless power power endless the power of an endless life you go look it up the the Amplified I believe it says the the the the power and indestructible life praise the Lord indestructible life that's why they can't put this church out that's why this church continues to live on it wasn't made by man oh my you can't put the Church of God out amen so notice brother BR say see notice after 50 days or seven sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost fell on the e8th day see it was seven sabbaths later exactly after his resurrection so it'd be seven times that again bring it right back around to the first day of the week again exactly see there's your holy convocation not having to do with anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never start it never started on any day it you see you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved see that's what this message come to do it's not it it isn't about law it is nothing to do with that it now takes us back to what we were in the beginning always saved always a Son of God am always Lord church has been beat down so much but then here we come a message of Grace and no wonder this the the the devil attacks this message in so many ways that's right but see it it's beyond that it's beyond the literal things it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus just come to redeem that but you was saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with he said a trout can never be a guard or a tadpole he might be in the same water with him but he was from the beginning of Trout the Ned only caught him but he was that from the begning oh aren't you glad for a message that would not deal with us according to what we were not trying to be accepted and happen to be accepted by the priest and a pope and and whatever else group amen he has accepted us amen it's an un unconditional Covenant amen so brother R said see eight cannot be counted with the week it cannot be counted eight days in a week you cannot do it see because there's only seven days in a week count any count it any way you want to Sunday is the first day of the week you count seven then you go back in and start over again count seven come back and go over it again and we've lived all through these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go into eternity you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination you don't get saved at an altar you don't get filled with the Holy Ghost out you don't have to come to an altar to get the Holy Ghost hello Church you don't have to have certain rituals and [Music] forms you just believe in your heart you can have it and you say ma'am he said see that's it we're in ending see you come by predestination there is a genuine holy convocation and we're ending the seventh Church age Church age see Pentecostal age we're entering that Holy convocation we are entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station not to some denomination but into eternity with their Eternal King amen we don't have it at all there's no such things as days and things and times you passed into eternity where you come from you was there to begin with and he says if you've got eternal life there is only one form and that's God and you are an expressed attribute if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father has drawed him see so it's that which passes away all these old things but these things don't so it speaks of Eternity right the Holy Ghost is eternal then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you just recognized what happened you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being and sin come along and perverted his way but you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and he redeemed you the expressed attribute and also redeems this Earth by the same way aren't you glad that he's the high priest over his word his own word hallelujah I love the Lord amen hallelujah can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I just love just come to the house of God know not in a rush tonight but just we're going to Worship the Lord he's just so good to us hallelujah hallelujah how how could we not be thankful how how can we not give him thanks for what he's done for us yes
