[1:00:17] it more amen that God is Jesus Christ
[1:00:20] the same yesterday

[1:00:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:30] forever and I uh you know it's my desire
[1:00:34] and been my desire is that the message
[1:00:38] you know
[1:00:40] um that the people of God could come
[1:00:42] together and and not not to hear someone
[1:00:46] building their own kingdom

[1:00:52] but just to preach the message
[1:00:56] and I I believe we've got men of God

[1:01:17] whatever God leads you to do you do it
[1:01:21] can you say amen that's right amen I
[1:01:25] don't I don't believe this message
[1:01:27] called us to be deadheads
[1:01:29] I just don't believe that I I think
[1:01:33] we've already come out of that I think
[1:01:34] he's called us that's what God's called
[1:01:37] a message for is to call us out of of
[1:01:39] all the Dead traditions and ideologies
[1:01:42] and all of that back to the power of the
[1:01:45] Living God
[1:01:46] amen and we're not here working the
[1:01:48] people now amen I I believe this is the
[1:01:52] age you know brother Branham said that
[1:01:54] God allotted his word to every age and
[1:01:57] if you look in the age that we're living
[1:01:58] in it's time for it it's the word it's
[1:02:01] time the prophet said King lamb worship
[1:02:03] it's time for King lamb worship and you
[1:02:07] see John was the type of our day amen he
[1:02:10] saw he saw that book open the lamb had
[1:02:13] come and opened the book how many
[1:02:15] believes the book is open
[1:02:17] the Lambs opened the book in this age a
[1:02:21] man and John says after the lamb opened
[1:02:23] the book he said everything in heaven
[1:02:25] and earth under the Earth everywhere all
[1:02:29] the creature heard I John
[1:02:31] and brother Bram said he must have had a
[1:02:33] wonderful time
[1:02:35] and he said he must have saw his name
[1:02:39] in the book
[1:02:40] now brothers and sisters that's the age
[1:02:42] that we're living in that's our word and
[1:02:45] so there's nothing wrong with getting
[1:02:46] excited this ain't some Pentecostal
[1:02:49] organization getting you worked up this
[1:02:52] is a people that know they are redeemed
[1:02:54] we are a people that know we're headed
[1:02:57] to heaven
[1:02:58] brothers and sisters the tribulation is
[1:03:01] coming on but we ain't worried about
[1:03:03] that we've already got the ticket in our
[1:03:06] hand we've heard the call and it's any
[1:03:09] moment we're leaving here
[1:03:11] are you leaving well we've got something
[1:03:14] to shout about we've got something to
[1:03:16] Rejoice about amen don't don't ask me to
[1:03:19] sit down and be quiet amen when the word
[1:03:22] is coming forth that's calling my name
[1:03:24] that is me amen that's what I am I am
[1:03:29] born to be an eagle I am born to fly I
[1:03:32] was born for this age I was born for a
[1:03:35] Rapture any moment I'm going to receive
[1:03:37] a body change
[1:03:39] I'm excited
[1:03:41] Hallelujah
[1:03:43] amen well I ain't gonna preach
[1:03:47] I just want to say this you can be
[1:03:49] seated but brother Brandon said the Holy
[1:03:52] Spirit has been bound for nearly 2 000
[1:03:54] years by these denominational Rivers
[1:03:57] that he said to be loosed in the evening
[1:03:59] time by this evening time message
[1:04:02] can you say Amen
[1:04:03] and notice what he says in another place
[1:04:06] he said how can we have a holy ghost
[1:04:08] Revival when you're so bound and starchy
[1:04:11] form of godliness the Bible said they'd
[1:04:14] have form of godliness but denied the
[1:04:17] power thereof he said the power of what
[1:04:20] the power of organization now the power
[1:04:23] of the world no the power of the church
[1:04:25] no the power of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:04:29] the secret place in the church and when
[1:04:33] the church adopts educated preachers and
[1:04:35] big buildings and finery in the state of
[1:04:38] the old-fashioned Holy Ghost they'd be
[1:04:41] better in a mission again can you say
[1:04:43] amen he said how are you going to have a
[1:04:46] Revival of the Holy Ghost and people
[1:04:48] quench it and bound it and are afraid of
[1:04:51] it he said that's where the trouble lies
[1:04:54] but you don't have to be afraid of the
[1:04:56] outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:00] can you say amen I think we're a people
[1:05:03] in this age that can discern because the
[1:05:05] word is in the bride the word is a
[1:05:07] discerner and we can discern what's bad
[1:05:09] and what's wrong that we can also
[1:05:12] discern what is true
[1:05:13] can you say Amen do you love him let's

[1:25:32] to help us
[1:25:34] we're asking God that you would come in
[1:25:36] a very special way Satan there's nothing
[1:25:38] you can do to deter Sons and Daughters
[1:25:42] of God
[1:25:43] we're here with a purpose
[1:25:45] we love you Lord in the name of the Lord
[1:25:48] Jesus Christ
[1:25:50] can the Church Say Amen
[1:25:52] and a man you may be seated
[1:25:56] praise the Lord
[1:25:58] I want to speak a little bit tonight
[1:26:01] on faith then it's going to be a very
[1:26:04] simple subject
[1:26:06] man but I believe Faith's confession is
[1:26:09] very important
[1:26:10] and footsteps lead to possession
[1:26:13] can you say man
[1:26:15] when we look here at the faith of of the
[1:26:17] shooter Mike woman in action
[1:26:20] this was her promise that was given to
[1:26:21] her by God's prophet
[1:26:23] amount in this last verse that we had
[1:26:25] read she did not even think that it was
[1:26:29] possible to have this child
[1:26:32] amen the prophet had told her that all
[1:26:35] things were possible and she believed
[1:26:36] what the prophet had said
[1:26:38] and it was because she believed the
[1:26:40] words of the prophet and it was because
[1:26:42] she received the words of the prophet
[1:26:44] amen that God gave her this this a child
[1:26:50] but now the child is dead the promise is
[1:26:53] the man is about 12 years old
[1:26:57] he's got a headache he comes and lays in
[1:27:00] his mama's lap Penny man he dies right
[1:27:04] there and but the scripture says but she
[1:27:07] went up
[1:27:08] and she laid him on the bed of the man
[1:27:11] of God
[1:27:12] and she shut the door on him
[1:27:15] and she went out
[1:27:17] now I I I'll tell you right now she
[1:27:20] wasn't going out to make funeral
[1:27:21] arrangements
[1:27:22] she wasn't going out to mourn and and
[1:27:25] and to curse God she was out to find the
[1:27:28] prophet of God
[1:27:29] the one who gave the promise in the
[1:27:31] first place now can you say Amen I say
[1:27:35] tonight the church is built upon divine
[1:27:38] revelation the man told Brother Branham
[1:27:40] one time he says amen that he could not
[1:27:43] accept Revelation and brother Branham
[1:27:45] says then you cannot accept Jesus Christ
[1:27:47] for Jesus Christ is the revelation of
[1:27:50] God in flesh can you say man amen I want
[1:27:54] to deal here tonight a little bit on
[1:27:56] faith amen faith is the very Foundation
[1:27:59] that God pleases that he himself places
[1:28:03] as the foundation of the pyramid in your
[1:28:06] life can you say man amen I want to say
[1:28:09] that Victory is the direct consequence
[1:28:13] of Faith's Revelation amen now I want
[1:28:16] you to think about it Victory is the
[1:28:19] direct consequence of Faith's Revelation
[1:28:23] in your life amen Faith literally
[1:28:27] confesses or it literally
[1:28:30] expresses what it sees therefore
[1:28:34] Revelation is how you know what faith is
[1:28:39] thinking about or what faith is seeing
[1:28:42] so when we talk about divine revelation
[1:28:44] it is it is Faith expressing what it is
[1:28:49] seeing it is expressing what it knows to
[1:28:53] be a fact
[1:28:55] amen we got to have faith in our lives
[1:28:57] amen now that's not it's not it's not in
[1:29:00] it in your learning it's not in amen how
[1:29:03] many books you have it's not in how much
[1:29:05] uh amen how many You Know Places you've
[1:29:07] got your names put on the roll what
[1:29:09] matters is Faith having its foundation
[1:29:12] in your life
[1:29:14] can you say man amen so Revelation is a
[1:29:18] privilege previously hidden but now made
[1:29:22] known unto you Revelation is the taking
[1:29:25] the cover off and the revealing of what
[1:29:29] is behind the cover amen Revelation is
[1:29:32] the unmasking of God's plan for your
[1:29:36] life unmasking God's plan for the age
[1:29:39] God Amen unmasking God revealing God God
[1:29:42] turning the light on
[1:29:44] well praise the Lord
[1:29:46] [Applause]
[1:29:53] glory to God
[1:29:56] the light on so that the public can see
[1:30:00] it
[1:30:01] Hallelujah
[1:30:03] I want to say when Faith walks into the
[1:30:05] room
[1:30:05] man he turns the light on and you can
[1:30:08] see what is there and faith is right
[1:30:11] there amen with an assurance standing
[1:30:13] right there saying here is your promise
[1:30:16] here is what God has for you here is
[1:30:19] what God wants to do for you here is
[1:30:21] what God's going to bring about in your
[1:30:23] life can you say Amen now you can walk
[1:30:26] by your side if you want to you can walk
[1:30:28] by emotion if you want to but the child
[1:30:31] of God has been given a faith and this
[1:30:34] faith is to take us into another realm
[1:30:37] where all things are possible where the
[1:30:39] Supernatural is their present Hallelujah
[1:30:42] I believe this morning on this evening
[1:30:45] we need to get out of this Physical
[1:30:46] Realm and get into a room where all
[1:30:49] things are possible
[1:30:51] all we've Gotta Have is a faith to
[1:30:54] believe it
[1:30:55] can you say amen amen that's exactly
[1:30:58] right amen there's no hypocrisy to faith
[1:31:01] faith is not something that is an
[1:31:03] imagination faith is not an imaginary
[1:31:06] Faith sees the product
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:12] faith is not hope so faith is not
[1:31:14] guesswork faith is a revelation of what
[1:31:19] God sees
[1:31:21] well praise the Lord
[1:31:23] so faith takes you into the place where
[1:31:27] God lives
[1:31:29] Faith takes you into that place and
[1:31:33] Faith reveals what God sees
[1:31:37] and escorts you into that rim to where
[1:31:41] you can experience and possess it well
[1:31:44] praise the Lord so when you're walking
[1:31:47] with God by Revelation it is a literal
[1:31:53] experience with the supernatural in your
[1:31:57] life
[1:32:02] they said that brother Branham
[1:32:03] Hallelujah
[1:32:05] you mind my my voice is pretty weak so I
[1:32:08] I'm but I'm going to preach to you
[1:32:09] tonight Hallelujah they said brother
[1:32:12] Brandon if you were sitting there with
[1:32:13] the old timer said when they were set
[1:32:15] with brother Branham
[1:32:16] occasionally he would stop
[1:32:19] and just touch the salt shaker
[1:32:21] amen and so finally someone asked him
[1:32:23] one time why do you always touch the
[1:32:26] salt shaker he says because sometimes I
[1:32:28] don't know whether I'm in that room or
[1:32:30] in this room
[1:32:32] I I I I walk in that Rim so much that
[1:32:35] sometimes are y'all hearing me tonight
[1:32:36] amen you see I believe that that Prophet
[1:32:39] walked in a rim alone with God
[1:32:42] but the prophet also said that every
[1:32:45] believer
[1:32:47] walks in a world alone with God
[1:32:52] alone with God you're walking with God
[1:32:54] you're experiencing what God sees you're
[1:32:57] understanding the way God understands it
[1:32:59] faith is not a PIN to tell on the donkey
[1:33:03] experience you're not blindfolded you're
[1:33:06] not trying to make it happen you know
[1:33:09] that God's will is for you and you can
[1:33:13] stand assured on that promise
[1:33:19] then you say Amen
[1:33:21] we're gonna throw in the dark you know
[1:33:23] darks in the blind amen blindfolded but
[1:33:27] Faith illuminates what God has
[1:33:31] Faith knows where God's at Faith knows
[1:33:35] how to take you there I believe it's for
[1:33:37] Corinthians 9 and 26 says I therefore
[1:33:41] shall run not as uncertainly so fight I
[1:33:45] not as one that is beating the air I
[1:33:48] know in whom I believe I'm standing upon
[1:33:52] that promise can you say Amen so the
[1:33:56] mystery of redemption that was once
[1:33:59] hidden in the mind of God
[1:34:03] the prophet of God says those Redemption
[1:34:05] thoughts was way back in his mind
[1:34:09] Hallelujah he knew the fall was coming
[1:34:12] he knew it was going to be there he's
[1:34:15] come on now now nothing ever comes to
[1:34:18] God Amen without God knowing it
[1:34:20] no the fall was coming God knew amen the
[1:34:24] serpent was there
[1:34:27] but in the back of God's mind he had a
[1:34:31] plan
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:36] oh can you say man amen so when the hey
[1:34:39] when the when the Adam and Eve had
[1:34:41] fallen and they had fallen short of the
[1:34:43] glory of God and now they're going to
[1:34:46] die they're walking out of the garden
[1:34:47] there they are the world is turned
[1:34:50] upside down but God says I've got a plan
[1:34:56] I've got a plan
[1:34:58] I'm not going to make it known right now
[1:34:59] amen because faith is being shut up
[1:35:02] until the time comes but the time will
[1:35:06] come the time will come where they will
[1:35:10] know who they are they will see
[1:35:13] Redemption
[1:35:16] foreign
[1:35:21] now right now your mind just shut up
[1:35:23] right now you're falling right now
[1:35:26] you're you're in Gloom right now the
[1:35:29] soul has been shut up
[1:35:35] but I want to give you a little bit of a
[1:35:36] secret
[1:35:40] as the son and daughter is walking out
[1:35:43] walking out the gates
[1:35:47] God's heart was a beating
[1:35:49] and he said oh I've got to let a little
[1:35:50] bit of my secret out
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:55] [Applause]
[1:36:00] Garden
[1:36:03] without giving you a promise
[1:36:06] it's not the season yet it's not the
[1:36:09] time yet your generation is going to go
[1:36:11] generation after generation after
[1:36:13] generation of death and misery and
[1:36:16] sorrow
[1:36:18] but I'm going to give you a promise
[1:36:21] that I'm going to redeem you
[1:36:25] and the Bible says that he slays a lamb
[1:36:27] and as he slays that lamb he takes The
[1:36:31] Cult
[1:36:32] and he wraps it around them
[1:36:40] well are y'all hearing me
[1:36:42] and he's saying now listen
[1:36:44] Satan got a good one on me
[1:36:50] Satan knows I don't have a body right
[1:36:52] now
[1:36:53] and in order to redeem you I'm going to
[1:36:55] have to have a body he was here when I
[1:36:56] gave the promise to Adam in the first
[1:36:58] place he was here when I gave adam
[1:37:01] Dominion
[1:37:02] and Authority
[1:37:05] and he come in and he worked his way
[1:37:07] into the serpent
[1:37:08] and now he's claiming control of the
[1:37:10] human race
[1:37:12] but I just want to give you a promise
[1:37:15] I want to give you a promise
[1:37:17] that I'm going to build myself a body
[1:37:20] someday and it'll come to the womb of a
[1:37:24] woman and I will defeat the enemy
[1:37:28] foreign
[1:37:33] can you say Amen
[1:37:35] amen his thoughts of you were from the
[1:37:38] beginning
[1:37:39] his thoughts of redemption the golden
[1:37:42] scepter had already been extended to us
[1:37:44] before the world began the scripture
[1:37:46] says you were chosen in him before the
[1:37:50] foundation of the world can you say Amen
[1:37:52] now what is revelation it is to now
[1:37:54] bring into public view it is now to
[1:37:58] manifestly declare Faith turns the light
[1:38:01] on to let you know what God has done
[1:38:05] and what he is doing
[1:38:07] in your life
[1:38:10] when you see Jesus Christ
[1:38:13] you
[1:38:15] use the Wrath
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:21] now
[1:38:23] when you see Jesus
[1:38:24] is the mystery of God revealed
[1:38:28] then you will also see that you are a
[1:38:33] part of that revelation of God
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:37] when you catch a revelation of who Jesus
[1:38:40] is then you catch a revelation of
[1:38:44] Who You Are
[1:38:46] when you catch a revelation of what he
[1:38:49] came for then you catch a revelation
[1:38:52] well praise the Lord
[1:38:54] when you find that he could not be
[1:38:57] defeated then you find that you cannot
[1:38:59] be defeated when you find that he could
[1:39:02] not be in the grave Hallelujah Satan you
[1:39:05] can come against his pride you can fight
[1:39:08] against her you can charm in her but
[1:39:12] she's got a divine revelation
[1:39:15] she's built with eyesight
[1:39:18] she knows who she is
[1:39:22] can you say Amen
[1:39:25] Hallelujah
[1:39:27] when you see Jesus Christ
[1:39:29] through the Faith's eye
[1:39:31] you're not seeing amount the second
[1:39:35] person of the godhead you're seeing the
[1:39:38] realities of the love of God expressing
[1:39:42] Redemption
[1:39:43] amen what praises the Lord
[1:39:47] now when Christ gave his blood he bought
[1:39:51] you can I hear an amen
[1:39:53] and he gave you a right to every
[1:39:55] Redemptive blessing
[1:39:57] second Timothy 1 and 9 it says who hath
[1:40:00] saved us someone say hallelujah
[1:40:03] and called us with an holy calling
[1:40:07] someone say thank you Jesus
[1:40:09] not according to our works
[1:40:12] someone say hallelujah
[1:40:14] but according to his own purpose and
[1:40:19] Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:40:24] before the world
[1:40:26] began
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:29] but he's saying that it's now made
[1:40:30] manifest
[1:40:31] that word manifest as brought into the
[1:40:34] public view by the appearing of Our
[1:40:38] Savior Jesus Christ
[1:40:40] if you're going down to the 12th verse
[1:40:42] and it says for which calls I suffer
[1:40:44] these things nevertheless I am not
[1:40:47] ashamed for I know whom I have believed
[1:40:51] I am persuaded that he is able to keep
[1:40:55] that which I've committed unto him
[1:40:57] against that day can you say amen amen
[1:41:00] listen to me friends whatever happened
[1:41:02] on that Damascus Road some kind of a
[1:41:05] faith some kind of an understanding some
[1:41:07] kind of a light switch was turned on and
[1:41:10] the Apostle Paul amen he left the old
[1:41:13] Judaism behind and he turned around to
[1:41:17] follow after that which he had seen
[1:41:25] he was Head and Shoulders above a bow he
[1:41:29] was the highest of his religion but what
[1:41:32] he saw When Faith flipped the light on
[1:41:36] it changed his life forever
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:43] I am persuaded we get too many people
[1:41:46] setting in message pews
[1:41:48] and they've not met Christ
[1:41:52] we get too many people sitting in
[1:41:54] churches everywhere and they don't know
[1:41:57] Jesus
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:02] you say not in the message churches
[1:42:10] not message churches
[1:42:12] [Applause]
[1:42:16] well praise the Lord
[1:42:18] they say you got the Holy Ghost when you
[1:42:20] speak in tongues
[1:42:22] you say you got the Holy Ghost just
[1:42:24] because a prophet came
[1:42:26] what's the difference
[1:42:28] [Applause]

[1:58:09] and man he said
[1:58:11] the man
[1:58:13] he said what we need
[1:58:16] is as many of those
[1:58:18] were Spirit-filled Christians no doubt
[1:58:20] bigger number were
[1:58:21] and they're sick
[1:58:23] and they're needy
[1:58:24] oh great God

[1:58:45] and um
[1:58:47] Man by the time she got through with her
[1:58:48] prey and
[1:58:50] I was quite certain that God was
[1:58:52] depressed
[1:58:56] everything was wrong with her
[1:58:58] I mean she had been done so wrong and
[1:59:00] everything was so bad and everything was
[1:59:02] so I praise the Lord
[1:59:04] by the time she got through exalting her
[1:59:06] problems I looked over at her
[1:59:10] amen
[1:59:12] I said Dear God
[1:59:14] amen I don't even know of God if God's
[1:59:17] got enough Faith over this

[1:59:30] can you say Amen you don't pray your
[1:59:33] problems you pray your word you say well

[1:59:37] know just someone telling you all of
[1:59:39] their bad stuff all of the everything is
[1:59:41] good you know that they're not ever
[1:59:43] going to overcome because their

[2:00:23] with faith believing
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] brother Branham says according to the
[2:00:30] scriptures
[2:00:31] you said that by the stripes we were
[2:00:33] healed
[2:00:34] it isn't necessary to pray them only to
[2:00:37] confess our sins for by your stripes we
[2:00:41] were past tense healed oh what a day of
[2:00:44] salvation What A Promise by Emmanuel
[2:00:47] that is certainly the truth
[2:00:51] can you say man
[2:00:53] now
[2:00:54] hey man I hope it's all right here

[2:01:10] Noah
[2:01:11] by faith
[2:01:13] Abel
[2:01:14] now that word amen is simply means faith
[2:01:19] is the persuasion of God
[2:01:22] by the persuasion of God Abel
[2:01:25] by the persuasion of God in Abraham by
[2:01:30] the persuasion of God it was God
[2:01:34] persuading there was no guesswork about
[2:01:36] it there was no turning around one way
[2:01:39] or the other it was God that gave the
[2:01:41] promise it was God that turned the light
[2:01:43] on it was faith that revealed God's mind
[2:01:49] and it didn't matter how long it took
[2:01:51] nor was willing to to to to go for 120
[2:01:54] years
[2:01:57] all right
[2:01:58] and I love it when we look there at
[2:02:00] Romans 4 and 8 19.
[2:02:03] talking about Abraham and being not weak
[2:02:05] in faith
[2:02:07] he considered not his own body now dead
[2:02:10] when he was about a hundred years old
[2:02:12] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[2:02:15] he staggered not at the promise of God
[2:02:17] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[2:02:21] giving glory to God
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:25] and being fully persuaded that what he
[2:02:29] had promised he was able also to perform
[2:02:32] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[2:02:35] righteousness
[2:02:38] brother Branham would say a man
[2:02:41] ought to get on that sacred ground with
[2:02:43] God
[2:02:45] I'm preaching here tonight
[2:02:48] I believe that this is going to be a
[2:02:50] meeting
[2:02:51] why not just expect this meeting to be
[2:02:53] the meeting of all meetings
[2:02:56] why not expect this meeting to be
[2:02:58] Supernatural
[2:03:01] come on church I know that rain is out
[2:03:04] there and I know Satan would like to try
[2:03:06] to hinder but I'm here to tell you we're
[2:03:07] not going to be hindered
[2:03:09] because we are fully persuaded we are
[2:03:11] fully persuaded we are fully persuaded
[2:03:13] that what he has promised he will
[2:03:18] perform
[2:03:23] well the Brenham says a man ought to get
[2:03:26] get to first get on the sacred ground
[2:03:28] with God where all the theologians all
[2:03:31] the doctors of divinity all the
[2:03:32] reasoning all the atheists nothing else
[2:03:35] can ever explain that away from him he
[2:03:37] was there when God come he knows what
[2:03:39] took place you can't reason it out of
[2:03:42] him he was there when it happened can I
[2:03:45] hear a great big amen
[2:03:47] [Applause]
[2:03:50] now
[2:03:52] Jesus was praying and in his prayer he
[2:03:56] said father
[2:03:57] I pray that they would be one
[2:04:00] even as you and I are one
[2:04:03] I want this Revelation to so
[2:04:06] let there be such
[2:04:09] a fellowship
[2:04:13] between them and me and me and you and
[2:04:17] you and them
[2:04:20] let there be such a union such
[2:04:23] divine revelation
[2:04:26] that they would know who they are
[2:04:29] that they would know who I am
[2:04:32] that they would be able to stand and act
[2:04:35] as your agents here on this Earth I must
[2:04:38] go
[2:04:40] but I'm going to send the comforter
[2:04:43] and I'm asking you to make them one
[2:04:46] like we're one
[2:04:48] but praise the Lord
[2:04:50] now the Son and the father were not one
[2:04:53] as in one finger
[2:04:55] it was the Eternal God who emptied
[2:04:57] himself in the virgin-born son of God
[2:05:03] that way when Jesus says it is it is my
[2:05:07] meat to do the will unto me can you say
[2:05:11] Amen
[2:05:12] Jesus is saying I'm leaving
[2:05:18] I've got to go
[2:05:22] in his prayer he says I pray
[2:05:25] that there would be a Oneness and Those
[2:05:27] whom you have redeemed
[2:05:32] a one that's not not not not not don't
[2:05:34] raise up good preachers necessarily
[2:05:37] don't just raise up prophets like you
[2:05:39] did in the Old Testament Saints
[2:05:40] necessarily
[2:05:43] but I pray that you
[2:05:46] them one
[2:05:49] from the youngest to the oldest from the
[2:05:51] least to the greatest
[2:05:53] where the anointing will be upon them
[2:05:55] where the glory Glory God would rest
[2:05:59] here on the Earth
[2:06:02] oh can you say Amen
[2:06:04] Hallelujah
[2:06:05] amen
[2:06:08] praise the Lord
[2:06:09] now Jesus says I and my father are one
[2:06:13] and we become one it's no longer God of
[2:06:16] there Jesus is the revelation of God
[2:06:19] here on there it was no longer God
[2:06:23] now it was God in flesh
[2:06:25] Jesus says I'm going and but when I
[2:06:27] leave I'm going to send that same
[2:06:30] comforter that made me one with God I'm
[2:06:33] going to bring him back Upon A group of
[2:06:36] people and they will reflect
[2:06:43] [Applause]
[2:06:44] a Oneness that governments have never
[2:06:46] been able to done a Oneness
[2:06:49] that denominations have never been able
[2:06:51] to do a Oneness that no one else has
[2:06:55] ever been able to do foreign
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:00] when that Holy Spirit comes down there
[2:07:03] will be a Oneness
[2:07:09] but praise the Lord
[2:07:12] Jesus become one with God he was the
[2:07:14] revelation of God what he saw he done
[2:07:18] Jesus wasn't guessing and trying he was
[2:07:20] the revelation of the invisible God the
[2:07:23] Bride of Jesus Christ is the revelation
[2:07:27] of God in this last day
[2:07:30] [Applause]
[2:07:36] but praise the Lord
[2:07:38] all that God was
[2:07:41] reported to Christ
[2:07:43] all that Christ was

[2:08:28] how that Eve was United with Adam
[2:08:30] she become part of him
[2:08:32] did you notice in Genesis 1 27 he
[2:08:35] created man both male and female created
[2:08:38] he them
[2:08:39] and the man
[2:08:41] both male and female when it comes to
[2:08:43] being in the spirit of feminist and
[2:08:44] masculine then God took from his side a
[2:08:47] rib do you notice the body part was a
[2:08:49] byproduct but not the spirit the body
[2:08:52] part of the woman was a byproduct after
[2:08:55] the creation had been finished God took
[2:08:58] from the sight of Adam a rib and made a
[2:09:01] woman
[2:09:02] but not the spirit the spirit was part
[2:09:05] of Adam
[2:09:06] for he was both man and woman
[2:09:08] spiritually speaking masculine and
[2:09:10] feminine don't you see
[2:09:14] light switch the big picture
[2:09:17] we in flesh are different
[2:09:21] we're like a byproduct a created being
[2:09:24] by holy wedlock but in spirit punch your
[2:09:28] neighbor and say this is getting good
[2:09:31] but in spirit we are sons and daughters
[2:09:37] not some other Spirit but the spirit of
[2:09:41] the Living God we are in his likeness in
[2:09:44] his unity in the perfect image of the
[2:09:47] Living God because we become Sons and
[2:09:50] Daughters not separated but the Same
[2:09:52] Spirit the same God the same person
[2:09:55] joined and headlock to the wedlock to
[2:09:57] the Eternal see how God planned it not
[2:10:01] that we should be different but to be
[2:10:04] him
[2:10:04] [Applause]
[2:10:10] let's turn the light switch on that's
[2:10:13] your chance to do a jig

[2:10:58] they meant the three creations of Adam
[2:10:59] spirit
[2:11:01] body
[2:11:03] and woman

[2:11:25] Adam and Eve he was both feminine and
[2:11:28] non-masculine can you say man
[2:11:31] God had a part of him that he wanted to
[2:11:34] have expressed he had a part of him that
[2:11:37] he was longing to get out it's been in
[2:11:39] the back of his mind for a long time
[2:11:41] come on Church Amendment all on the day
[2:11:44] of Calvary when he put him to sleep out
[2:11:48] of Christ came a pride you're no longer
[2:11:52] in the back of God's mind you're no
[2:11:54] longer a thought you're an expression

[2:13:00] sitting there wondering if God can fill
[2:13:02] you with the Holy Ghost I'm here to tell
[2:13:04] you Faith sees the promise it's reality

[2:13:34] but out of Adam
[2:13:40] out of Christ
[2:13:42] come this lovely bride
[2:13:44] now brother Branham would say
[2:13:46] we're not separated
[2:13:48] with the same spirit
[2:13:49] same God same person see how God planted
[2:13:54] that we should be not different but him
[2:13:56] not some other being of another tribe
[2:14:00] but a real Union an offspring of the
[2:14:03] almighty done by a holy Union
[2:14:06] the body comes from father and mother
[2:14:07] but the spirit come from God
[2:14:10] God separating himself
[2:14:14] as Adam was separated
[2:14:18] did you realize that when you received
[2:14:20] the Holy Ghost
[2:14:25] the feminine side of God
[2:14:27] has settled right down upon a bride
[2:14:30] well praise the Lord
[2:14:33] the feminine side of God praise the Lord
[2:14:36] oh
[2:14:39] he poured into Christ all
[2:14:41] praise the Lord you don't want to
[2:14:43] understand that sometimes you can't
[2:14:45] understand that but I'm here to tell you
[2:14:47] it's the truth anyway
[2:14:48] [Applause]
[2:14:50] brother Adam says on the day of
[2:14:52] Pentecost we find the Holy Ghost the
[2:14:53] pillar of fire separating itself setting
[2:14:56] upon each member of that church God
[2:14:58] putting himself together then when that
[2:15:01] group of people uh when that group of
[2:15:03] people together what does it do it
[2:15:05] brings back the unified body of the Lord
[2:15:09] Jesus
[2:15:10] [Applause]
[2:15:14] amen
[2:15:16] why was it in this last day and I'm
[2:15:18] going to start to descend here
[2:15:20] in this last day
[2:15:22] a man when that when that book when the
[2:15:26] mighty angel came down
[2:15:28] and gave the book
[2:15:32] it was a faith
[2:15:39] now now remember
[2:15:41] he told Daniels seal it up
[2:15:47] he told John seal it up
[2:15:54] but when the faith comes
[2:15:56] there's going to be somebody
[2:16:00] who's going to stand up in this cloak of
[2:16:03] a message
[2:16:04] would identify herself with what God has
[2:16:09] been thinking all along
[2:16:13] and when he says go and take the little
[2:16:15] book which is open
[2:16:16] he knew that there was going to be
[2:16:18] somebody that was going to be willing to
[2:16:19] stand up and go to that angel and say
[2:16:21] give me the book
[2:16:22] [Applause]
[2:16:24] there would be a faith for someone to
[2:16:26] say yeah that's me
[2:16:30] everybody
[2:16:31] there would be a faith on Earth that
[2:16:34] would say yes I believe that yes I see
[2:16:38] that yes I'll do that yes I'm going to
[2:16:42] the angel and I'm demanding the book
[2:16:47] the book is mine I believe what has been
[2:16:52] said God said I'm his bride and I
[2:16:55] believe it

[2:17:34] and you just act upon what you're seeing
[2:17:38] for the Sean it's not you twisting your
[2:17:40] Church's arm it's not that you're trying
