[46:06] church says amen
[46:09] the man the Psalms the 34th chapter and
[46:13] I'm going to just start at the fourth
[46:16] verse
[46:19] that it said I sought the Lord and he
[46:21] heard me
[46:23] and delivered me from all my fears
[46:28] they looked unto him and were lightened
[46:32] in their faces were not ashamed this
[46:35] poor man Cried unto the Lord or cried
[46:38] and the Lord heard him and saved him out
[46:40] of all of his troubles
[46:43] the angel of the Lord in campus round
[46:46] about them that fear him and delivereth
[46:49] him
[46:50] oh taste and see that the Lord is good
[46:53] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[46:56] oh fear the lord Jesus his Saints for
[46:59] there is no want to them that fear Him
[47:03] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[47:05] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[47:08] not want any good thing
[47:10] gummy children hearken unto me and I
[47:14] will teach you
[47:15] fear of the Lord
[47:17] amen you can have your seats this
[47:19] morning
[47:23] I thought I'd take a different subject
[47:25] today and just was on my heart
[47:30] I came on my hard Thursday I believe it
[47:33] was and and so
[47:36] um but I want to I want to talk about
[47:39] fear
[47:41] and
[47:43] um
[47:44] in in our opening scripture we're
[47:46] reading of two types of fear
[47:51] um
[47:51] and there is one kind of fear
[47:55] that dominates the world today
[47:59] and according to Webster this type of
[48:04] fear
[48:05] is an unpleasant emotion caused by
[48:09] anticipation
[48:12] or awareness of danger and an anxious
[48:16] concern a reason for alarm
[48:19] it is means to be afraid to panic
[48:23] anxiety scared this is this is the fear
[48:27] that is dominating and controlling the
[48:31] world of course
[48:34] um the Nations today are using this fear
[48:39] uh Russia is trying to get the world to
[48:42] fear them uh Iraq North Korea China
[48:47] America we're all trying to get each
[48:51] other to fear them
[48:53] and you know we we everybody boasts
[48:57] about their missiles and boasts about
[48:59] this and and to be honest the world is
[49:02] scared
[49:03] they're they're in this under this this
[49:05] fear because they don't know the future
[49:09] and we're everyone is threatening each
[49:13] other and and so it it is a fearful time
[49:18] and so but we uh as ministers are trying
[49:23] to get everyone to have faith in God
[49:26] that's that's our desire our goal and
[49:30] because the prophet said you will either
[49:32] be controlled by faith or fear you're
[49:35] going to be controlled by either one and
[49:39] fear and faith the prophet said
[49:42] one of these
[49:44] are the controlling factors that control
[49:47] everything
[49:48] fear or faith controls the Nations all
[49:52] people all churches all homes all
[49:56] everything and they are the again that
[49:59] two controlling elements in the world
[50:03] today is either Faith or fear so every
[50:06] individual is going to be controlled by
[50:08] one of these elements
[50:10] but if you look in the the the the the
[50:12] fourth verse that where we read just now
[50:17] uh David said I sought the Lord he heard
[50:21] me and he delivered me from all my fears
[50:25] he delivered me and so this fear that
[50:29] David is delivered from is a fear that
[50:34] comes from Satan
[50:36] it does not come from God
[50:38] because they're in first Timothy or
[50:41] second Timothy 1 7
[50:44] Paul writes and says God hath not given
[50:48] us the spirit of fear
[50:51] and so this kind of fear is evil and
[50:55] according to First John uh 4 18
[51:00] this kind of fear hath torment
[51:04] uh and and this word torment uh means
[51:08] extreme pain or anguish of body or mind
[51:12] it's agony
[51:14] and and so to cause severe usually
[51:18] persistent or recurrent distress of body
[51:23] or mind too and and and so that this is
[51:28] what the torment and and and we read
[51:31] there that that fear this kind of fear
[51:34] hath torment so and this fear is is
[51:37] dominating the world so most people are
[51:41] in such torment that they're in anguish
[51:43] of either mind or body uh to where their
[51:48] their their mentally snapping it's it's
[51:51] just they're losing it and and it's not
[51:55] just a a day thing it's it's becoming a
[51:59] persistent thing to where to where
[52:01] people are really not knowing what to do
[52:04] how to handle the pressure and and and
[52:07] and and these things because it's a it's
[52:09] a torment and and we we know that it's a
[52:13] demon before in the English word the the
[52:17] demon actually means Tormentor amen and
[52:22] so demons the prophet said are
[52:24] tormentors that torment us uh uh so this
[52:29] fear is a is a demon that is tormenting
[52:32] most of the world today now the prophet
[52:37] said if you fear then the devil steps in
[52:39] and he calls this fear he said it's it's
[52:42] the devil's fear it's it's it's it's
[52:45] that now Luke 21 and 25
[52:50] Jesus said and there shall be signs in
[52:53] the Sun and in the moon and in the stars
[52:55] and upon the Earth distress of nations
[52:58] with perplexity the Sea and the waves
[53:02] roaring now through the message they are
[53:05] we know and and to what we're seeing
[53:07] today we know that this scripture is
[53:10] being fulfilled currently right now in
[53:13] this age and so then notice that in that
[53:18] 26th verse it says men's Hearts failing
[53:22] them for fear and and and of course this
[53:25] is today and and and there and for
[53:27] looking after those things which are
[53:30] coming on the earth for the powers of
[53:33] Heaven shall be shaken ain't that rhyme
[53:36] so so many people millions billions of
[53:39] people the the majority of people uh
[53:44] um is are are being tormented by this
[53:47] demon of fear uh media is is propagating
[53:52] fear uh Hollywood in their movies are
[53:56] propagating fear uh everything it's fear
[54:00] fear fear uh and and why it's it's
[54:04] because uh the the world is uncertain
[54:07] the economy is uncertain people's souls
[54:11] are in danger there there's there's a
[54:15] damnation on people's souls and and and
[54:19] so we we find that uh uh that it's the
[54:23] wrath of God that is approaching
[54:27] um you know uh uh
[54:30] if you're if you've been in in any place
[54:33] where there's tornadoes Oklahoma has
[54:36] many of them and and
[54:39] um so so you know it's not mountainous
[54:41] like it is here at least where we live
[54:42] it's it's open I mean You Can See For
[54:45] Miles and and
[54:47] um
[54:48] um but when a storm is coming and you
[54:50] see that wall of black clouds I mean it
[54:53] is so black
[54:54] and you know it's approaching and and
[54:56] and and as you're watching give it five
[54:58] minutes and it's getting closer and and
[55:00] it's it's just getting closer and closer
[55:03] then all of a sudden the alarm starts
[55:04] going off and it's telling you you
[55:06] better run you better hide and you know
[55:09] and and and we've seen it where it's
[55:11] just so steel the the winds everything
[55:14] just stops you know and and that thing
[55:18] is just moving and it just looks
[55:19] horrific you know and and and I I I I
[55:23] imagine what it is today to the world
[55:27] that is seeing the dangers I mean look
[55:31] at the the craziness in politics look at
[55:34] the craziness in the churches look at
[55:36] the craziness in in the the the average
[55:39] American home or just homes in general
[55:41] look at the craziness that's going on on
[55:44] the jobs and and everything and and what
[55:47] it is is we're looking at the wrath of
[55:50] God coming it's it's approaching and and
[55:54] and I could I I'll I'll put it this way
[55:57] uh as as we saw the as we see them with
[56:01] that wall cloud coming and then you hear
[56:03] the signs going off and if you turn your
[56:05] radio on you'll hear a tornado is on the
[56:08] ground you know uh uh take cover
[56:10] immediately you know what I'm saying and
[56:13] and I could just imagine the warning
[56:15] that is going out to a prophet that is
[56:18] telling us something's on the ground the
[56:20] the wrath of God is approached it's it's
[56:22] here take cover right and and so and and
[56:26] and we're finding that we're in an age
[56:29] where where uh uh and and and you know
[56:32] sometimes you wonder where where we are
[56:35] at in time uh uh that that you're you're
[56:38] preaching to Eternal lost people uh uh
[56:42] you know for the most part no one is uh
[56:45] uh there's not a desire for God anymore
[56:48] there's not a a whatever and so you you
[56:51] could just imagine the fear that is
[56:53] gripping uh the hearts of the people
[56:55] today and it's because the wrath of God
[56:59] is is approaching according to what the
[57:02] scripture tells us now Isaiah 60 and 2
[57:07] it says for behold the the gross
[57:10] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[57:13] Darkness the people Darkness the the the
[57:16] Earth gross Darkness the people and and
[57:20] notice what this Darkness tells us uh
[57:25] um uh Isaiah 9 19 it says the Wrath of
[57:30] the Lord is the reason that the land is
[57:34] darkened it's so so we're hearing the
[57:37] the gross Darkness uh upon the people
[57:40] Darkness upon the land and why is it
[57:43] it's because the Wrath of the Lord and
[57:47] and so we could say that the Wrath of
[57:49] the Lord is upon the Earth it's upon the
[57:52] people and and the Heart of men is
[57:55] failing them uh uh uh because of fear
[57:59] and why is because they have no hiding
[58:02] place that there is no hiding place and
[58:06] and if you look at the last part of
[58:09] Isaiah 9 and 19 it says and the people
[58:13] shall be as the fuel of fire now you
[58:16] could just imagine that that brother
[58:19] Branham calls it Cannon father many
[58:21] people out here is just cannon fodder
[58:24] and and so here the Bible is saying that
[58:27] the people will be as the fuel of the
[58:29] fire and no man shall spare his brother
[58:33] no man will be able to do this it's
[58:36] because it's not just a Wrath of a king
[58:39] a Wrath of a man it's the wrath of God
[58:42] and and so and and if you notice who who
[58:46] is the wrath of God upon and and John 3
[58:51] 36 Jesus said he that believeth on the
[58:54] son shall or house etern everlasting
[58:58] life and he that believeth not the son
[59:01] shall not see life but the wrath of God
[59:05] abideth on him it abideth on him think
[59:10] of that even before the the the the the
[59:12] Wrath actually comes before the the
[59:15] Great Tribulation actually comes the
[59:18] wrath of God at how many people the
[59:21] wrath of God is upon and is abiding upon
[59:24] because they believe not the the son
[59:28] amen and and we know what it is today
[59:30] the son of man revealed ain't that right
[59:33] and they believe not see they they're
[59:35] playing games with it and and these
[59:37] things Romans 1 18 uh Paul uh says here
[59:42] breaking in the the wrath of God is
[59:44] revealed from Heaven against all
[59:47] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[59:50] who hold the truth in unrighteousness so
[59:55] they have the truth they they know the
[59:58] truth right and and and and and Paul
[1:00:01] would even say that you you you can see
[1:00:04] in in I believe in Romans 1 there in
[1:00:07] that chapter where you you can look at
[1:00:09] the Sun and see truth you can look at
[1:00:10] the the grass and see truth you can look
[1:00:13] at the seasons during uh uh the
[1:00:16] springtime where where it comes from
[1:00:18] grass and trees and all that that were
[1:00:21] dead they come to life it's telling of a
[1:00:23] truth and so the world holds a truth and
[1:00:27] then they deny the truth they deny the
[1:00:29] fact that there's a God and they hold
[1:00:32] the truth in unrighteousness and the
[1:00:34] wrath of God is upon them amen and and
[1:00:39] so then you look in Ephesians 5 and 3
[1:00:42] where Paul mentioned several things that
[1:00:45] causes the wrath of God to come he
[1:00:48] mentions fornication all uncleanness
[1:00:51] covetness filthiness foolishness talking
[1:00:55] uh foolish or foolish talking uh jesting
[1:00:58] uh um and and and and and so these
[1:01:02] things and he says be it's because of
[1:01:04] these things that the wrath of God comes
[1:01:07] upon the children of Disobedience so now
[1:01:11] we know what the wrath of God is it's on
[1:01:13] the children of Disobedience those who
[1:01:15] obey not the truth those who disregard
[1:01:18] the truth as as as a a way of life it's
[1:01:22] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:01:25] so uh then he goes on the whoremonger
[1:01:28] the the unclean person the Covetous man
[1:01:31] who is an idolater will not have any
[1:01:35] inheritance in the kingdom of God and
[1:01:39] then Paul would tell us therefore be not
[1:01:42] part takers with them be not partakers
[1:01:45] with him why because the wrath of God is
[1:01:49] upon them ain't that right and so with
[1:01:52] this there's an effect upon their hearts
[1:01:55] and that is fear fear and the devil is
[1:01:58] able to use that and and because it's
[1:02:01] the it's it's the devil's fear and and
[1:02:04] so in Colossians 3 and 5. uh uh Paul
[1:02:08] would write mortified Therefore your
[1:02:11] members which are upon the Earth
[1:02:13] fornication uncleanness in in ordinate
[1:02:17] affection evil uh
[1:02:20] something to that effect and covetness
[1:02:23] which is idolatry for which things sake
[1:02:27] the wrath of God cometh on the children
[1:02:30] of Disobedience so again the wrath of
[1:02:33] God is on the children of Disobedience
[1:02:36] ain't that right and and so in in in uh
[1:02:41] Isaiah 13 and 13 it tells us that God
[1:02:45] will shake the heavens and and the Earth
[1:02:48] shall remove out of her place uh in the
[1:02:52] Wrath of the Lord of hosts and in the
[1:02:55] day of his Fierce anger now in this in
[1:02:58] this day of Wrath there is no mercy as
[1:03:01] as the Bible there in Revelations would
[1:03:04] tell us that he he that is filthy let
[1:03:06] him be filthy feel he that is righteous
[1:03:09] let him be righteous still it's it comes
[1:03:12] to a place that there's no more Mercy
[1:03:14] there's there's no more grace there's
[1:03:16] there's absolutely no way that a man can
[1:03:19] be saved um he he's come he can brother
[1:03:23] Branham says you know that he'll shed
[1:03:24] his tears and and and he'll they'll
[1:03:27] think they're getting saved and yet yet
[1:03:30] there there's nothing there uh uh
[1:03:33] because the Wrath of the Lord Has Come
[1:03:35] ain't that right so so you can imagine
[1:03:38] just how terrible this this wrath is
[1:03:41] that it's going to affect the heavens
[1:03:43] and the Earth and and and these things
[1:03:46] and and and according to to Paul's
[1:03:49] writings the Heaven and Earth is been
[1:03:52] shaken right now it's it's being shaken
[1:03:56] right now and it's the voice of God that
[1:03:59] is causing the shaken ain't that right
[1:04:02] is that you find that in Hebrews there
[1:04:04] uh I believe maybe the 10th chapter if
[1:04:07] I'm not mistaken but uh uh uh where he
[1:04:11] says once more will I shake not only the
[1:04:14] Earth but I'll shake the heavens in and
[1:04:16] he talks about the voice speaking again
[1:04:18] and how uh and we know that that's the
[1:04:21] message of the hour that's the voice of
[1:04:23] God today amen and and then through all
[1:04:26] this shaking uh uh uh Paul would tell us
[1:04:30] and we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:04:32] shaken so so there there is a shaking
[1:04:36] but then we know that there is going to
[1:04:38] be an explosion uh uh that will make way
[1:04:42] for a new Heaven and new earth uh second
[1:04:46] Peter 3 and 10 but the day of the Lord
[1:04:49] will come as a thief in the night in
[1:04:52] which uh the heavens and shall pass away
[1:04:56] with the great noise and the elements
[1:04:58] shall melt with fervent Heat and the
[1:05:01] Earth also and the works that are in uh
[1:05:04] that are therein shall be burned up
[1:05:06] every everything of man will be gone
[1:05:11] oh aren't you glad for that have you
[1:05:13] ever just seen the the beautiful
[1:05:14] mountains or scenery and then right in
[1:05:17] the middle of it all there's a power
[1:05:19] line you know and you're thinking man
[1:05:21] you know if you get that stupid thing
[1:05:23] out of the way it'd be a perfect picture
[1:05:24] well God's gonna get it out of the way
[1:05:27] there ain't gonna be no asphalt there
[1:05:28] ain't gonna be no houses there ain't I I
[1:05:31] look at uh you know in process Fork Road
[1:05:33] that's where we first lived and and it
[1:05:36] was so beautiful out there I love the
[1:05:37] scenery just driving down that road and
[1:05:39] seeing the mountains and now they're
[1:05:41] they're filling it all up with houses
[1:05:42] and buildings and blocking my beautiful
[1:05:45] scene you know and it's like one of
[1:05:48] these days it ain't going to be that way
[1:05:49] amen why because the wrath of God is
[1:05:53] coming it's all the works of man all the
[1:05:56] achievements of man will be no more amen
[1:06:00] and and so you can imagine why that that
[1:06:04] the fear of man or fear is coming upon
[1:06:07] the Earth and and so uh all the works
[1:06:10] that are therein shall be burned up
[1:06:12] seeing then that all these things shall
[1:06:15] be dissolved what manner of persons
[1:06:19] ought you ought to be in all holy
[1:06:21] conversation or lifestyle and and
[1:06:25] godliness looking for looking for and
[1:06:29] Hasting now now one is looking for the
[1:06:32] wrath of God to come looking for all
[1:06:35] these horrible things that are coming
[1:06:37] but then there's a group of people
[1:06:39] that's looking for and hastening unto
[1:06:42] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[1:06:46] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:06:49] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:06:52] heat nevertheless we according to his
[1:06:55] promise we look how he's looking we look
[1:06:59] not not for the rest of God but we look
[1:07:02] for a new heavens and new earth wherein
[1:07:05] dwelleth righteousness ain't that rhyme
[1:07:07] so there's going to be this explosion
[1:07:10] there's going to be a mighty shaking and
[1:07:12] you can you can read about it or hear
[1:07:14] about it listening to it in the future
[1:07:16] home of the Earthly bride and Heavenly
[1:07:19] bridegroom and and brother Brandon says
[1:07:22] the whole earth will be on fire and will
[1:07:24] ignite with gases we'll ignite the gases
[1:07:27] that's in the earth and explode it such
[1:07:30] an exploding explosion will rock it
[1:07:33] cause it's got to kill every disease
[1:07:35] every thistle every Thorn everything
[1:07:38] there is to be done the fire will burn
[1:07:40] it up and remember it's not all together
[1:07:43] just a literal fire because it's also a
[1:07:46] holy fire that will take away Satan and
[1:07:50] all his devils and both Heaven and Earth
[1:07:53] will pass away killing all the germs all
[1:07:56] insects all natural life on it and
[1:07:59] around it even the H2O the water will
[1:08:02] explode ain't that right and and and
[1:08:05] then he he goes in and other place you
[1:08:08] know when a man receives the baptism of
[1:08:10] fire there's a lot of noise around there
[1:08:12] they think that's a shame to hear people
[1:08:15] scream and shout like that just wait
[1:08:18] till this Earth gets her baptism ain't
[1:08:21] that right now they tell us that people
[1:08:23] you know that that scream and dance and
[1:08:25] Shout they need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:08:27] first how do you know that they ain't
[1:08:30] getting the Holy Ghost how do you know
[1:08:32] that's not the Holy Ghost upon them amen
[1:08:35] making such an annoy ain't that right
[1:08:37] this Earth ain't gonna pass away and
[1:08:40] this Heaven Ain't gonna pass away
[1:08:41] without a noise can you say amen and I I
[1:08:44] just happened that just uh uh uh uh
[1:08:48] proves I'm not saying it has to happen
[1:08:50] all the time so don't don't get into
[1:08:52] that I'm not getting into an order of of
[1:08:54] where God moves and and these things but
[1:08:57] I just believe a person a man can't pass
[1:09:01] away the old things in a person can't
[1:09:03] pass away without there being some kind
[1:09:06] of a noise Amen to let the world know
[1:09:09] that that the old has passed away and
[1:09:12] all things have become new can you say
[1:09:15] amen amen sold now the H2O the prophet
[1:09:18] said is going the water is going to
[1:09:20] explode for the Bible said here in
[1:09:22] Revelations 21 that there is no more sea
[1:09:25] see see exploded this is will change the
[1:09:28] whole surface of the entire Earth she'll
[1:09:31] burst and blow to Pieces all the outside
[1:09:33] the crust for hundreds of feet below it
[1:09:36] would just simply be completely
[1:09:39] demolished if the atmospheres the gases
[1:09:42] that's in the earth now where they're
[1:09:44] finding these missiles that can't get
[1:09:46] through it a great sphere up in there
[1:09:50] way up in some kind of a sphere that uh
[1:09:53] where all these kinds of gases they say
[1:09:55] that'll it'll burst see the holy wrath
[1:09:59] of God will come upon it and will
[1:10:01] cleanse it and will change the entire
[1:10:03] surface aren't you glad for that see so
[1:10:06] it's is a time of purging and and we
[1:10:09] know this this is this is all under uh
[1:10:12] uh uh uh the the the the the the seal uh
[1:10:16] uh The Sixth Seal being a time of
[1:10:19] purging a man that God's going to purge
[1:10:22] the Earth he's gonna Purge the the
[1:10:24] heavens he's going to purge everything
[1:10:26] and ain't that right amen the only
[1:10:29] people that will not be there is the
[1:10:31] Bride of Jesus Christ that's been purged
[1:10:35] in a different way and they're being
[1:10:36] purged right now amen and it's the blood
[1:10:39] of Jesus Christ that is purging them
[1:10:42] ain't that right and they've got the
[1:10:44] token in this age they've got the life
[1:10:46] of God reflecting through them to tell
[1:10:49] them to show the world it's on display
[1:10:51] to show the world I've been purged I've
[1:10:54] been purged I'm not looking for wrath to
[1:10:56] come I'm a new creature and I'm looking
[1:10:59] for a new Heaven and a new Earth ain't
[1:11:02] that right God would prepare you he's
[1:11:04] preparing it's it's what did Brother
[1:11:06] Brown say it's it's a prepared uh
[1:11:08] Kingdom it's a prepared world it's a
[1:11:11] prepared land for prepared people ain't
[1:11:14] that right so so now it's a purging time
[1:11:17] and and the world knows that this is
[1:11:20] coming upon them they they've held on to
[1:11:23] their own ideas they've held on to their
[1:11:25] their rottenness they've held on to
[1:11:27] Spirits they've held on entertained
[1:11:30] Demons of bitterness and divisiveness
[1:11:32] and they've they've held on to all kinds
[1:11:35] of nonsense amen and God says I've had
[1:11:38] enough of it I'm going to purge this
[1:11:40] Earth I'm going to purge it all there
[1:11:42] will be a time you can worship and
[1:11:44] there'll be no one persecuting you for
[1:11:46] it there's going to be a time that you
[1:11:48] can just be a Christian and there will
[1:11:50] be no mind battles for it there will be
[1:11:52] nothing there there will be no trial
[1:11:54] there will be no nothing because God's
[1:11:56] going to purge this thing he's going to
[1:11:58] purge it can you say amen that's why we
[1:12:00] can go through our trials and lift up
[1:12:02] our hands that's why we can we don't
[1:12:04] care about critics we don't care about
[1:12:06] the nation players we don't care about
[1:12:08] what the devil does to our body we don't
[1:12:10] care about the the the trials that we go
[1:12:13] through we just don't care amen none of
[1:12:16] this matters to us I don't care what
[1:12:19] so-and-so does down the street it
[1:12:21] doesn't matter to me I'm looking for a
[1:12:23] new Heaven and a new Earth I I'm looking
[1:12:26] for something I've got to Hope in in my
[1:12:29] life now if people are Earthbound and
[1:12:31] all they can see is just a you know they
[1:12:34] can't see past the end of their nose
[1:12:35] they can't see past the trials and the
[1:12:37] troubles and the problems of the church
[1:12:39] and the problems of the home the
[1:12:41] problems of theirs the problems of the
[1:12:43] preacher the problems of the deacons or
[1:12:44] the musician amen well they ain't got no
[1:12:47] hope amen you've got to look up and and
[1:12:50] then see that there's a bright future
[1:12:52] that's ahead can you say Amen but what
[1:12:55] is it people have gotten so churchy that
[1:12:58] they don't have an experience with God
[1:13:00] Amen they dried up in that soul and the
[1:13:05] fear is gripping them
[1:13:08] now we we find that the world knows that
[1:13:11] this is coming upon them
[1:13:13] and people are doing exactly what the
[1:13:16] Bible prophesied of them running to and
[1:13:19] fro running to and fro why Restless
[1:13:23] they have a Restless spirit
[1:13:26] ain't that right Restless nothing can
[1:13:29] satisfy them divorce is on the on the
[1:13:32] rise adultery is on the rise
[1:13:36] you they're they're looking for all
[1:13:38] kinds of pleasures
[1:13:40] and the devil's is giving it to them
[1:13:44] because it's a Restless spirit
[1:13:48] because they're running it they're
[1:13:49] fulfilling scriptures
[1:13:52] and what's driving it
[1:13:54] fear
[1:13:56] driving it you know they're trying to
[1:13:58] find satisfaction they're trying to find
[1:14:00] something to appease them if you look
[1:14:02] Revelation 6 and 12 and I beheld when he
[1:14:06] had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there
[1:14:09] was a great earthquake and the sun
[1:14:11] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[1:14:15] the moon became his blood
[1:14:18] and the stars of Heaven fell into the
[1:14:20] Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[1:14:23] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[1:14:26] Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a
[1:14:29] scroll when it is rowed together and
[1:14:32] every mountain and Island were moved out
[1:14:34] of their places and the kings of the
[1:14:36] earth and the great men and the rich men
[1:14:38] and and the chief captains and the
[1:14:40] Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every
[1:14:42] free man hid themselves in the dens
[1:14:46] and in the rocks of the mountains and
[1:14:49] said to the rocks and mountains
[1:14:50] following us and hide us from the face
[1:14:53] of him that sitteth on the throne and
[1:14:56] from the Wrath of the lamb for the great
[1:14:58] day of his wrath is come and who is able
[1:15:02] to stand ain't that right so we're
[1:15:04] seeing that this fear is gripping every
[1:15:07] level of humanity
[1:15:10] poor Rich smart not so smart
[1:15:15] um it's it's gripping
[1:15:17] whether whether you got good occupation
[1:15:20] bad occupation no matter what place you
[1:15:23] live in the fear is gripping the world
[1:15:27] because the wrath of God is not just
[1:15:29] coming upon America it's not just coming
[1:15:32] upon one location it's coming upon
[1:15:35] everything God's going to purge this
[1:15:37] whole world ain't that right and so we
[1:15:41] we now we we look and and and we see
[1:15:44] that Israel in the Old Testament they
[1:15:47] provoke God several times they provoked
[1:15:49] him in in the wilderness they provoked
[1:15:52] the Lord to wrath by their Rebellion
[1:15:55] then the people the uh uh provoked the
[1:15:58] Lord in in Horeb by their idolatry then
[1:16:03] they promote provoked the Lord to wrath
[1:16:05] in kadish barnia by their unbelief see
[1:16:10] God had proven Time and Time Again by
[1:16:13] the supernatural amen that that he was
[1:16:17] God and that he was with him and that
[1:16:19] every promise he gave them what was true
[1:16:22] but the circumstance every time they
[1:16:24] come to circumstance and and and
[1:16:28] they hardened their heart they hardened
[1:16:31] their heart to the promises of God to
[1:16:34] the supernatural of God in other words
[1:16:36] all they could see was the circumstance
[1:16:38] and they couldn't see the greatness of
[1:16:40] God around them they couldn't see that
[1:16:42] God had proven time and a time and time
[1:16:45] again to answer prayer and to watch over
[1:16:48] them and to protect them that every time
[1:16:50] the circumstance come amen they Harden
[1:16:53] their heart and the the Bible says and
[1:16:56] Paul would write and say they hardened
[1:16:58] it because they had an evil heart of
[1:17:00] unbelief ain't that right an evil heart
[1:17:03] of unbelief and and so uh and and notice
[1:17:08] if you look they all died they they all
[1:17:11] died and and the uh uh Jesus said
[1:17:14] they're they're all dead right and and
[1:17:16] and we know that they were already
[1:17:18] physically dead but but the prophet said
[1:17:21] they were eternally dead that's what
[1:17:23] Jesus meant they were eternally dead
[1:17:25] right amen God God uh they they were not
[1:17:29] allowed to come into the promised land
[1:17:31] because they provoked God unto Wrath hey
[1:17:35] man we don't want God's rest we want
[1:17:37] God's mercy amen that that's that's what
[1:17:40] we want ain't that right now now we find
[1:17:43] that there is a people that cannot be
[1:17:47] delivered from Fear they cannot because
[1:17:50] the wrath of God abides upon them they
[1:17:54] they cannot be delivered for they are
[1:17:55] the children of Disobedience and and
[1:17:58] notice they are called the children a
[1:18:00] bit uh Disobedience because according to
[1:18:03] First Peter to an eight they stumble at
[1:18:07] the word being disobedient where unto
[1:18:11] also they were appointed ain't that
[1:18:14] right so so again they're called the
[1:18:17] children of Disobedience they stumble at
[1:18:20] the word being disobedient where unto
[1:18:23] also they were appointed and and this
[1:18:27] what brings the wrath of God upon them
[1:18:30] there's nothing in them to believe there
[1:18:33] they can be religious they go to church
[1:18:35] Church they they do pay their all their
[1:18:38] dues they they do all the ritual things
[1:18:41] but they don't have a heart of belief
[1:18:45] they they they they ain't got it there
[1:18:47] to believe God to take God at his word
[1:18:49] and so they become hardened in their
[1:18:52] hearts oh come on now
[1:18:55] you know this is the time that rapturing
[1:18:57] Faith should be taken hold in the church
[1:19:01] we've seen God do too much things for us
[1:19:04] we've seen God uh uh uh mighty in battle
[1:19:09] in this age
[1:19:10] ain't that right
[1:19:12] and it should be building a rapturing
[1:19:15] faith within us but instead of building
[1:19:17] rapturing faith it's exposing an evil
[1:19:21] heart of unbelief in many people
[1:19:24] hello
[1:19:25] now now we find that but also there is a
[1:19:29] group of people that can be delivered
[1:19:32] from Fear
[1:19:33] they can be
[1:19:35] are you with me they can be delivered
[1:19:38] from Fear
[1:19:39] and and and so we we look at this
[1:19:42] because and and and and and so first
[1:19:45] Thessalonians five and nine uh Paul
[1:19:47] would write God everybody say God hath
[1:19:50] not
[1:19:51] appointed us
[1:19:53] under Wrath
[1:19:56] aren't you glad for that God has not
[1:19:59] appointed us under wrath but to obtain
[1:20:02] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] who died for us whether we wake or sleep
[1:20:09] we should live together with him
[1:20:11] wherefore Comfort yourselves together
[1:20:15] and edify one another even as also you
[1:20:19] do can you say man so our comfort should
[1:20:22] be of that we have obtained salvation
[1:20:26] our comfort together should be that God
[1:20:30] has not appointed us to Wrath
[1:20:33] so this fear that is trying to grip the
[1:20:37] Church of the Living God Amen David said
[1:20:39] he has delivered me from that fear
[1:20:43] he's delivered me from it
[1:20:46] can you say man
[1:20:48] now what Paul is speaking of here uh uh
[1:20:52] God has not appointed us that us is the
[1:20:55] children of obedience if the if the
[1:20:58] wrath of God is upon the children of
[1:21:00] Disobedience then then the mercy of God
[1:21:03] the grace of God is upon the children of
[1:21:07] obedience
[1:21:09] ain't that right so notice Romans 6 and
[1:21:12] 17 you were everybody say I was past
[1:21:16] tense I was amen you were a man the
[1:21:21] Servants of sin but you have obeyed from
[1:21:24] the heart not just going through
[1:21:26] legalists not just going through rituals
[1:21:28] not just a routine of something I know
[1:21:31] that I should do so here I am no no
[1:21:34] you've obeyed from the very Soul the
[1:21:37] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[1:21:40] delivered you being made free been being
[1:21:44] then made free from sin you become the
[1:21:48] Servants of righteousness now notice if
[1:21:51] it can't come from the heart then you're
[1:21:53] still a servant to sin if it's not
[1:21:57] coming from the very most inner being
[1:22:00] amen now that's where it's got to come
[1:22:03] because when your Trials Come amen it
[1:22:06] can't touch the soul Satan can touch
[1:22:08] your spirit say can affect your body
[1:22:10] that he cannot affect your soul and when
[1:22:13] you believe from the heart that faith is
[1:22:15] still anchored I don't care if it seemed
[1:22:17] like God Is A Million Miles Away that
[1:22:20] faith is still anger and you're obeying
[1:22:22] from the heart
[1:22:25] you're obeying
[1:22:29] now God does not want us to fear
[1:22:32] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:22:36] God doesn't want us to fear
[1:22:39] so this is why he delivers us
[1:22:44] because there's no reason to fear
[1:22:46] because
[1:22:47] God has not appointed you to Wrath
[1:22:51] sir there's no reason to fear
[1:22:54] so then that means Satan is just trying
[1:22:56] to squat on him God's Property
[1:22:59] ain't that right
[1:23:01] see so you have a right to cast that
[1:23:03] devil out oh wait get away from me get
[1:23:06] away right
[1:23:08] so we find what does Fear work through
[1:23:13] unbelief
[1:23:14] ain't that right
[1:23:16] and and so uh uh this tormenting spirit
[1:23:20] of fear accompanies unbelief it does not
[1:23:24] coexist
[1:23:26] with faith
[1:23:29] the more faith the less fear
[1:23:32] it cannot coexist with faith
[1:23:35] brother Brown said when you go to
[1:23:37] reasoning
[1:23:38] and wondering
[1:23:41] then you begin to fear
[1:23:43] when you begin to reason it when you
[1:23:46] begin to wonder about it you begin to
[1:23:48] fear
[1:23:49] ain't that right so reasoning and
[1:23:52] wondering comes from unbelief
[1:23:54] ain't that right now now I'm I'm gonna
[1:23:57] say this uh uh if I can see and and it's
[1:24:01] in that Spirit Room that Satan begins to
[1:24:03] work on our reasoning it's in that
[1:24:06] Spirit realm that Satan begins to work
[1:24:08] on our imagination and working on it's
[1:24:10] the five senses ain't that right
[1:24:12] see and and so and and and and so we we
[1:24:16] find that that fear can can get in in in
[1:24:19] in that way now brother Branham in
[1:24:21] speaking of Christ he said this he was
[1:24:25] deity himself made flesh here on Earth
[1:24:27] to manifest his love to the people and
[1:24:31] to take away sin of the earth aren't you
[1:24:33] glad for that that's that's the purpose
[1:24:36] of Calvary that's the purpose of
[1:24:38] Christ's coming he came here in order
[1:24:40] that he could anchor death in his own
[1:24:43] body he could anchor sickness in his own
[1:24:46] body the curse that ought to have been
[1:24:48] on you he took it upon himself and had
[1:24:52] to die as a man in order to redeem you
[1:24:55] back to this full fellowship with the
[1:24:58] father again what a marvelous thing
[1:25:02] yeah
[1:25:03] what a marvelous thing ain't that right
[1:25:05] but then you know what the prophet says
[1:25:08] that fear and unbelief can literally
[1:25:11] paralyze a man to where he can't grasp
[1:25:15] that
[1:25:18] he he can't grasp what he did at Calvary
[1:25:22] he said our minds are too sluggish the
[1:25:24] vows have been stuffed up because they
[1:25:27] are paralyzed with fear and unbelief
[1:25:30] can you say man so see God does not want
[1:25:34] us paralyzed to where that you know that
[1:25:37] that when we preach the promises when
[1:25:39] you hear about the problem you read
[1:25:41] about the promises you can't grasp it
[1:25:45] God help us and that's what fear does
[1:25:48] that's what what this unbelief this fear
[1:25:51] and all of these things and that
[1:25:53] unbelieving Spirit tries to affect us in
[1:25:56] such a way
[1:25:59] hello yeah
[1:26:01] yeah now what makes fear what what makes
[1:26:03] fear a lack of confidence everybody say
[1:26:06] a lack of confidence
[1:26:08] a lack of confidence if you lack
[1:26:10] confidence it will make you fear that's
[1:26:12] what the prophet said
[1:26:14] people fear that they're going to be
[1:26:16] lost they fear that they're going to be
[1:26:18] left behind they fear that God won't
[1:26:20] answer their prayer they fear uh uh
[1:26:22] their sickness they fear the future they
[1:26:25] fear because they lack confidence
[1:26:28] there's their and and so notice what
[1:26:30] Paul would tell us in Hebrews 10 and 35
[1:26:34] uh uh through 39 Cass not away therefore
[1:26:39] your confidence
[1:26:41] right say it with me cast not a way
[1:26:45] therefore your confidence
[1:26:48] this is a warning that Paul is telling
[1:26:51] us now don't cast that confidence away
[1:26:53] why the moment you cast it away fear
[1:26:56] grips you
[1:26:58] that's right which hath great recompense
[1:27:01] of reward what has the great recompense
[1:27:03] of reward your confidence
[1:27:06] is that right for you have need of
[1:27:09] patience
[1:27:10] that after you have done the will of
[1:27:12] gods you might receive the promise so so
[1:27:15] us us doing the will of God Amen uh
[1:27:19] there there's a many times there's a
[1:27:22] space between doing the will of God and
[1:27:24] receiving the promise but in that time
[1:27:26] don't Cast Away your confidence
[1:27:29] right
[1:27:30] right
[1:27:31] see that you might receive the promise
[1:27:34] he said see for yet a little while and
[1:27:36] he that shall come will come and will
[1:27:39] not tarry now the just shall live by
[1:27:43] faith
[1:27:45] ain't that right so faith and confidence
[1:27:47] goes together the just shall live by
[1:27:50] faith but if any man draw back my soul
[1:27:53] shall have no pleasure in him but we are
[1:27:56] not of them who draw back unto Perdition
[1:27:59] but of them that believe to the saving
[1:28:03] of the Soul
[1:28:06] ain't that right
[1:28:08] so now where where does our confidence
[1:28:10] come from for the Bible says cast not
[1:28:13] away your confidence so where does our
[1:28:15] confidence come from well Psalms tells
[1:28:18] us there in in or in Proverbs uh 20 or 3
[1:28:22] and 26 the Lord shall be thy confidence
[1:28:26] and shall keep thy foot from being taken
[1:28:30] ain't that right so what is our
[1:28:32] confidence the Lord
[1:28:34] everything that our confidence is built
[1:28:37] upon is the Lord
[1:28:39] our confidence is based upon a finished
[1:28:42] work of Calvary our confidence is based
[1:28:45] upon his love to us our confidence is
[1:28:48] based because we are assured of his of
[1:28:51] his promises to us can you say amen amen
[1:28:54] the confidence is not that I know the
[1:28:57] Lord can heal but our confidence is I
[1:28:59] know the Lord has healed me
[1:29:01] the confidence is that not not the fact
[1:29:05] that I know there's going to be a
[1:29:06] rapture we all know that but but our
[1:29:09] confidence is now I know I'm going to be
[1:29:11] a part of that I I I that the confidence
[1:29:14] is that it's not that I know that God
[1:29:17] can heal duh we've seen that but the
[1:29:19] confidence is that God now heals me and
[1:29:22] every promise is mine that's the
[1:29:24] confidence that you cannot Cast Away
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:29] you can't Cast Away that confidence
[1:29:33] it's one thing to have confidence that
[1:29:35] the Bible is true
[1:29:37] now many people have gone and thrown
[1:29:39] that confidence away
[1:29:41] but the real confidence that we need and
[1:29:44] we must not throw away is that every
[1:29:46] word of God is true for me
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:51] is that right
[1:29:52] the Lord shall be thy confidence and
[1:29:55] shall keep thy foot from being taken so
[1:29:58] now remember if there's no confidence or
[1:30:00] faith
[1:30:02] then fear takes over
[1:30:04] and when fear Comes The Devil Comes
[1:30:08] see and so if we're not in confident
[1:30:11] that God has everything in control
[1:30:14] then fear grips us
[1:30:16] if we're not confident in his love
[1:30:18] toward us then fear dominates us ain't
[1:30:21] that right so fear again resides where
[1:30:24] there is no confidence or faith now I
[1:30:27] want to go into something here and and
[1:30:30] I'm not going to keep you much longer
[1:30:32] but what is it that takes away our
[1:30:35] confidence
[1:30:36] now Paul would tell us don't Cast Away
[1:30:38] your confidence but then what would take
[1:30:41] away our confidence and I think this is
[1:30:44] so important and and just going to take
[1:30:47] some time here for a moment but First
[1:30:49] John 3 and 18
[1:30:52] um it it says my little children let us
[1:30:56] not love in word neither in tongue but
[1:31:01] in deed and in truth
[1:31:04] now that that's a mouthful right there
[1:31:08] let us not love in word neither in
[1:31:11] tongue but in deed and in truth love
[1:31:13] indeed and in truth now the world today
[1:31:18] is throwing that word love around so
[1:31:20] loosely it's it's become so common
[1:31:22] churches are throwing it around like
[1:31:24] it's just common uh uh homes to where
[1:31:29] it's just perverted it's so perverted
[1:31:31] and and and or really well only the true
[1:31:36] elect will have that true love
[1:31:40] and and so they they have no idea as to
[1:31:43] what love means but love creates a a a
[1:31:47] loyalty it creates a devotion it it it
[1:31:51] creates a bond ain't that right it's a
[1:31:54] bond that and and this is where you know
[1:31:56] a husband and wife
[1:31:58] that love must be there or something
[1:32:01] will come in between them uh uh you know
[1:32:05] but if if the love is there there's
[1:32:06] nothing I don't I don't care how ugly I
[1:32:09] am my wife loves me and so some big old
[1:32:11] hunk comes by there's just nothing there
[1:32:14] because we have a bond now we could have
[1:32:17] just had a spat we could have just had a
[1:32:19] a real real spat but if that love is
[1:32:21] there I don't care who gives her flowers
[1:32:24] and who you know would try to entice her
[1:32:26] to something else it's the love that
[1:32:29] binds us
[1:32:30] because there's a loyalty
[1:32:33] right there's a loyalty there's a
[1:32:36] devotion now the first and greatest
[1:32:38] commandment deals with love and is found
[1:32:42] in Deuteronomy 6 5 and thou shalt love
[1:32:45] the Lord thy God with all everybody say
[1:32:49] all thine heart and with all
[1:32:53] thy soul and with all thy might ain't
[1:32:58] that right so our love first of all is
[1:33:02] is to God it's it's it's there and the
[1:33:06] second Jesus said is like an Intuit love
[1:33:09] thy neighbor as thyself
[1:33:12] ain't that right so now Jesus said there
[1:33:16] is no commandment greater than these
[1:33:20] love the Lord thy God first with all thy
[1:33:24] Soul all thy might all thy strength all
[1:33:26] thine heart and then love thy neighbor
[1:33:29] as thyself
[1:33:31] right
[1:33:32] now this shows us that man must
[1:33:36] prioritize his love now I'm still
[1:33:39] talking about my thought here but man
[1:33:42] must prioritize his love God first his
[1:33:46] neighbor second ain't that right so when
[1:33:49] a person loves the Lord with all of his
[1:33:51] heart with all of his soul with all of
[1:33:53] his might then what happens he will be
[1:33:56] devoted and loyal to God and God is
[1:34:02] the word
[1:34:03] ain't that right so a man puts his first
[1:34:07] loyalty his first love will be to the
[1:34:10] word so his actions will be word based
[1:34:12] his thoughts will be word based his
[1:34:14] motives will be word based his decisions
[1:34:16] his meditation everything will be word
[1:34:19] based because
[1:34:21] his love is to God his devotion his his
[1:34:25] his loyalty ain't that right
[1:34:28] and only then can he love his neighbor
[1:34:31] indeed and in truth
[1:34:34] only then can he truly love his neighbor
[1:34:38] indeed and in truth can you say man see
[1:34:42] the deed ain't giving someone a candy
[1:34:44] bar and saying that's love that's not
[1:34:47] what that's not what uh uh uh uh uh John
[1:34:52] is is writing here see see uh uh we we
[1:34:56] find it is contrary to the word of God
[1:34:59] when a man tries to love his neighbor
[1:35:02] without loving God first
[1:35:06] ain't that right you have to love God
[1:35:09] before you can love your neighbor
[1:35:11] now so that kind of love is misleading
[1:35:14] so to love someone with with having no
[1:35:18] regard to God's word and his ways is to
[1:35:22] love with the wrong kind of love and we
[1:35:24] know that the prophet told us that
[1:35:26] there's all kinds of loves there's
[1:35:28] there's there's human love there's uh uh
[1:35:32] a a gopal love which is Godly love uh
[1:35:34] Divine love uh there is uh lust love
[1:35:38] passionate love filthy love and it just
[1:35:40] goes on and on and on perverts perverts
[1:35:42] perverts but the pure love is divine
[1:35:45] love
[1:35:46] ain't that right so a man with Divine
[1:35:49] love will always love God first and
[1:35:52] foremost he will be misunderstood and
[1:35:54] criticized his love will be
[1:35:56] misunderstood because it's not according
[1:35:59] to the interpretation that the world has
[1:36:01] of love
[1:36:03] ain't that right so-called Christians
[1:36:06] speak of love all the time but their
[1:36:08] love is misplaced churches all over the
[1:36:11] world have opened their doors to
[1:36:13] homosexual
[1:36:15] sexuality to adultery to transgender to
[1:36:18] all kinds of feel and they've all done
[1:36:20] it in the Name of Love
[1:36:22] now that that love is misplaced because
[1:36:24] they're loving without regards to God
[1:36:27] they're loving without regards to his
[1:36:31] word
[1:36:32] ain't that right so so far be it that
[1:36:36] now we've we've become we've become
[1:36:38] politically correct behind the pulpit
[1:36:40] to where so we don't offend no one we
[1:36:43] don't want no one to leave so we tried
[1:36:44] to just make it everything just right
[1:36:47] see and and and when you do that you
[1:36:49] bypass God's word you you bypass the
[1:36:52] whole fact that that God is trying to
[1:36:54] lead but you're afraid of every reaction
[1:36:58] then that's not love
[1:37:00] how many ministers have compromised on
[1:37:03] the word
[1:37:04] for the sake of love
[1:37:06] and yet that's not the order of love the
[1:37:09] love is love God first
[1:37:13] which causes you to be devoted to God
[1:37:16] first to his word to his principles to
[1:37:19] his his values
[1:37:21] ain't that right but the churches have
[1:37:23] misplaced love and sold their tables as
[1:37:26] the Bible has prophesied have become
[1:37:28] full of vomit fulfilling the prophecy
[1:37:30] sin has become more tolerable in this
[1:37:33] age than ever and so their love is not
[1:37:36] prioritized according to the scripture
[1:37:39] to stand for Godly principles is
[1:37:42] considered now to be hate to cry out
[1:37:45] against the wrong is deemed as bigotry
[1:37:48] ain't that right
[1:37:50] it's it's it's meddling in personal
[1:37:52] affairs
[1:37:54] it's now considered well being in the
[1:37:57] flesh
[1:37:59] critical
[1:38:00] narrow-minded
[1:38:02] why because the world has misplaced love
[1:38:06] they have misinterpreted What Love Is
[1:38:09] [Music]
[1:38:11] right so Isaiah speaks of this day and
[1:38:15] warns us prophesies
[1:38:17] 5 20 War unto them that call evil good
[1:38:20] and good evil that put forth that put
[1:38:23] Darkness for light and light for
[1:38:25] darkness that put bitter for sweet and
[1:38:26] Sweet for bitter see what is it why
[1:38:29] would they do that is because they have
[1:38:31] misplaced love their their their their
[1:38:34] their love has Men been misdirected
[1:38:38] well the Bible says they become lovers
[1:38:40] of their own selves lovers of pleasure
[1:38:41] more than lovers of God so then they
[1:38:44] have love but it's not Divine love
[1:38:46] before because Divine love loves God
[1:38:49] first
[1:38:51] it's perverted love and so only by
[1:38:54] Divine love can you correctly prioritize
[1:38:57] love according to scripture notice if a
[1:39:00] man is going to love indeed and in truth
[1:39:03] again he must love God first and
[1:39:05] foremost
[1:39:07] because you sisters have Divine love and
[1:39:10] you love people with Divine love what
[1:39:12] does that make you do it makes you dress
[1:39:14] right
[1:39:15] makes you act right you act totally you
[1:39:18] talk holy you live holy you dress like a
[1:39:22] lady should be you're willing to suffer
[1:39:24] persecution for it you're willing to
[1:39:26] suffer mockery for it why you love God
[1:39:29] first and foremost and with that you
[1:39:32] love indeed and in truth
[1:39:35] about you loved your neighbor indeed in
[1:39:37] truth how could you love your neighbor
[1:39:40] and put it on a pair of pants
[1:39:44] hello
[1:39:45] aren't your actions leading them to hell
[1:39:48] how can you love your neighbor your
[1:39:51] brother and and cut your hair sisters
[1:39:55] then your love is misplaced because
[1:39:58] you're misdirecting them
[1:40:02] well that could go with anything you're
[1:40:04] getting joined in the gossip session
[1:40:07] then how can you say that's love
[1:40:10] when you're misdirecting so many
[1:40:15] hello so we find that if you love with
[1:40:20] Divine love then you sisters it makes
[1:40:22] you dress holy act holy talk holy
[1:40:24] because you don't want to do anything
[1:40:26] that would be a stumbling block to
[1:40:29] someone who is watching your life
[1:40:32] ain't that right
[1:40:33] now you're going to be a stumble block
[1:40:35] to a lot of folks just simply because
[1:40:38] they they can't see God in the veil of
[1:40:41] Flesh so they're looking for critic uh
[1:40:44] uh uh always looking for things to
[1:40:47] criticize I don't care if it's the
[1:40:49] musician hit the note wrong there's
[1:40:51] always going to be somebody there to
[1:40:53] criticize that
[1:40:54] I don't care what you do you know Pastor
[1:40:57] blew his nose wrong and there's going to
[1:40:59] be somebody that'll criticize that but
[1:41:01] we're not talking about that
[1:41:03] we're talking about somebody that that
[1:41:06] is such Divine love that through all of
[1:41:09] your mistakes through everything that
[1:41:10] you go through you're staying right with
[1:41:12] that word
[1:41:13] I don't care if it's called if you have
[1:41:15] to repent you repent because the Bible
[1:41:17] said so I don't care if you've got to
[1:41:19] make things right you make it right
[1:41:20] because the Bible says so I I don't I
[1:41:23] don't care what it is see and because
[1:41:25] you Brothers love people with Divine
[1:41:28] love what does it do it causes you to
[1:41:30] live right act right talk right think
[1:41:33] right
[1:41:34] can you say man because you don't want
[1:41:37] to hinder somebody from coming to Christ
[1:41:39] you're not this kind of love is not
[1:41:42] looking for a pat on the back it's not
[1:41:43] looking for the Applause of men
[1:41:46] it's not looking for everybody to like
[1:41:48] you
[1:41:50] why because you know the Bible says
[1:41:52] blessed are those that are going to
[1:41:53] persecute you for my name's sake
[1:41:57] right if they persecuted him they're
[1:42:00] going to persecute us
[1:42:02] ain't that right yeah yeah but see the
[1:42:05] Divine love causes you to go through
[1:42:06] brother Brandon said if I love you I'll
[1:42:08] tell you the truth
[1:42:10] now see what is that that's loving God
[1:42:12] and loving his neighbor in word and
[1:42:15] indeed for people that don't tell the
[1:42:17] truth
[1:42:18] and and you're what you're you're being
[1:42:20] friend well I'm gonna be friends I love
[1:42:21] them I just love them oh bless your
[1:42:23] heart and they're just crying sobbing
[1:42:24] complaining about the church they're
[1:42:26] complaining about that oh bless your
[1:42:27] heart you just come over here honey
[1:42:29] bunny you don't see if you really love
[1:42:31] their soul you'll tell them the truth
[1:42:34] you won't lend your eye your ears to the
[1:42:36] garbage can
[1:42:39] or make your ears as garbage cans
[1:42:42] come on ain't that right
[1:42:44] so this what it means to love indeed and
[1:42:47] in truth you you can't say I love people
[1:42:50] and then refuse to tell them about the
[1:42:51] message of the hour you you you you can
[1:42:54] you you can't love people I mean with
[1:42:57] Godly love now I'm talking about Divine
[1:42:59] love and then refuse to tell them the
[1:43:01] truth about about what's coming upon the
[1:43:03] Earth
[1:43:04] I don't care if they hate you I don't
[1:43:06] care whatever
[1:43:07] Jesus so loved the the father that he
[1:43:11] was done he had the father's business he
[1:43:14] wasn't out for every healing campaign he
[1:43:17] he wasn't do you know why the prophet
[1:43:19] said there's very few people that really
[1:43:21] knew that he was on the earth and he
[1:43:24] said why would he go around the
[1:43:26] Pharisees and the Sadducees that hated
[1:43:28] him he said it wasn't for them per se it
[1:43:31] wasn't for them it was for there was an
[1:43:33] elect that was among them
[1:43:35] so he knew that there was going to be a
[1:43:37] set that would hate him and despising
[1:43:40] but that didn't matter he loved with
[1:43:43] Divine love and he was after that man's
[1:43:46] soul
[1:43:47] who the elect
[1:43:50] and you say Amen so you can't love God
[1:43:53] and then have a misplaced love for your
[1:43:55] neighbor
[1:43:56] if you love God then you love
[1:43:58] what he loves you hate what he hates if
[1:44:01] you love God then you will love the soul
[1:44:04] of a man
[1:44:06] you with me you'll love the soul of a
[1:44:09] man
[1:44:10] that's why brother Branham you know he
[1:44:13] didn't he didn't do humanitarian works
[1:44:16] he didn't go out and feed the poor he
[1:44:19] didn't get us together and say all right
[1:44:21] let's let's do like John 3 16 and
[1:44:23] missions and this and that and that he
[1:44:26] was after the soul of a man
[1:44:29] as much as he loved people and he hated
[1:44:32] to see the Affliction he didn't go out
[1:44:34] and trying to heal every Afflicted
[1:44:36] person he was after that soul of a man
[1:44:39] now that's Divine love when you really
[1:44:42] love your neighbor as thyself how many
[1:44:45] wants to go to hell
[1:44:48] oh you don't want to go to hell y'all
[1:44:50] don't want to go to hell then love your
[1:44:52] brother as you would love yourself
[1:44:57] love him so much we've given Christmas
[1:44:58] gifts and we'll give them this and we'll
[1:45:00] give them that and never tell them about
[1:45:01] God never tell them that they need the
[1:45:04] Lord never tell them about the truth of
[1:45:07] this message
[1:45:09] but if you loved your neighbor as
[1:45:11] thyself you don't want to perish
[1:45:15] and we know that that you can give a
[1:45:17] house to somebody and they're lost that
[1:45:19] doesn't save them you can give away your
[1:45:22] car you can give away it all and it
[1:45:24] doesn't help them
[1:45:26] we're talking about the soul of a man
[1:45:32] when you love the soul of a man that's
[1:45:34] what God loved
[1:45:36] God so loved the world he loved the soul
[1:45:38] of the man
[1:45:40] then you won't live to be accepted by
[1:45:42] all you won't live to be liked by all
[1:45:44] you won't live for the Praises of man
[1:45:47] you live to win that soul to Christ
[1:45:49] that's been predestinated
[1:45:52] you live to be a light in darkness to
[1:45:55] that predestinated soul
[1:45:58] let them laugh at you let them scoff you
[1:46:00] whatever but there's one thing they'll
[1:46:02] know about it you love God and you love
[1:46:04] them
[1:46:04] from the soul
[1:46:07] you're after the soul
[1:46:12] brother Brown so loved man that he was
[1:46:15] willing to be rejected by the churches
[1:46:17] he was willing can you imagine aren't
[1:46:19] you glad that there was someone on the
[1:46:21] Earth
[1:46:21] that had a passion for Souls
[1:46:25] that he turned down the million dollars
[1:46:28] that was given him he turned down all
[1:46:30] the prestige of these preachers of these
[1:46:33] denominations to where he said I have no
[1:46:35] church to preach into but he did it for
[1:46:37] the lost for the love of a soul
[1:46:40] he stayed with the word for the love of
[1:46:42] the Soul he wouldn't just stop shh uh
[1:46:45] shut up they wouldn't shut his mouth up
[1:46:47] because he had a love for the soul and
[1:46:50] I'm one of them Souls you're one of them
[1:46:52] Souls now we are the ones that that has
[1:46:55] to have that confidence
[1:46:58] and you say man
[1:47:00] see so then see you you're out to rescue
[1:47:04] that predestinated soul from hell and to
[1:47:06] do that then you must become a prisoner
[1:47:08] to the father's will which is his word
[1:47:11] is that not what Jesus said I am come to
[1:47:13] do the father's will I can do nothing
[1:47:15] except the father show me my meat is to
[1:47:17] do the will of the father ain't that
[1:47:19] right he went and prayed for that one
[1:47:21] man when there was all kinds of lameens
[1:47:23] and and and and and and and people that
[1:47:26] were dying and all that and he went and
[1:47:28] touched that dead prayed for that one
[1:47:29] man told that one man to rise up take
[1:47:31] your bed and walk amen Annie what
[1:47:33] brother Brown said he wasn't even going
[1:47:35] to die he had had an inflection for 30
[1:47:36] some years amen but he done exactly what
[1:47:40] the father showed him
[1:47:42] why he loved the Lord thy God
[1:47:46] so only then can Divine love when you
[1:47:50] become a prisoner
[1:47:52] uh to the father's will only then can
[1:47:55] Divine love be manifested indeed and in
[1:47:57] truth
[1:47:58] Paul tells us that a man can give all
[1:48:01] his Goods to feed the poor but that's
[1:48:02] not a manifestation of divine love
[1:48:05] he can know all the mysteries of the of
[1:48:08] the Bible but that's not a manifestation
[1:48:10] of divine love he can give his body to
[1:48:12] be burned but that's not a Divine
[1:48:14] manifestation of divine love he can
[1:48:17] speak with tongues of men and angels but
[1:48:18] that's not a manifestation of divine
[1:48:20] love manifestation of divine love is
[1:48:23] when you do the will of the father
[1:48:26] then you say man persecuted yes despised
[1:48:30] yes scorned ridiculed misunderstood
[1:48:32] laughed that talked about yes but men's
[1:48:34] Applause is not what we seek for
[1:48:39] right ain't that right
[1:48:41] now how can this be how how can how can
[1:48:44] Jesus be willing to go to the Cross how
[1:48:46] can Paul be willing to be beheaded how
[1:48:49] can all these the the the the the the
[1:48:51] the the Saints throughout the the the
[1:48:54] the uh history amen be willing to give
[1:48:57] their lives and all that why because
[1:48:59] they had confidence
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:02] hello love produces confidence love and
[1:49:07] confidence goes hand in hand to love God
[1:49:10] and not have confidence in him shows
[1:49:12] that there's something wrong
[1:49:14] ain't that right to love God and say I
[1:49:17] love God and yet not have confidence in
[1:49:19] him shows that there's something wrong
[1:49:20] now I want to go into that for just a
[1:49:22] moment and then I'll let you go now if
[1:49:24] you'll read just let's continue reading
[1:49:26] in First John 3 and 19th verse and
[1:49:29] hereby we know that we are of the truth
[1:49:32] and shall assure our hearts before him
[1:49:35] for if our heart everybody say our heart
[1:49:38] condemn us
[1:49:40] well God is greater and knoweth all
[1:49:42] things but if our heart condemn us not
[1:49:44] then we have confidence with God toward
[1:49:48] God and whatsoever we ask we receive of
[1:49:51] him because we keep his Commandments and
[1:49:53] do those things that are pleasing in his
[1:49:56] sight
[1:49:57] so then we find that the confidence
[1:49:59] leads when the heart condemns
[1:50:03] ain't that right
[1:50:04] and and and and our heart condemns us
[1:50:07] when there's sin in our lives
[1:50:10] when we're not doing the will of the
[1:50:12] father our heart condemns us
[1:50:15] then you have no confidence and if you
[1:50:18] have no confidence then fear tries to
[1:50:21] get in
[1:50:23] right because then what what happens sin
[1:50:26] separates our relationship with God
[1:50:30] it does not mean that you're you're a
[1:50:32] sinner it does not mean anything like
[1:50:34] that but sin when you have sin in your
[1:50:37] life when you're holding on to sin I
[1:50:39] don't care what it is if God convicts
[1:50:41] you of something and you're holding on
[1:50:43] to that you cannot have relationship
[1:50:45] with God until that's done
[1:50:50] and you say man
[1:50:52] so it's not that a person isn't a
[1:50:54] Christian but sin interferes with
[1:50:56] relationship with our relationship with
[1:50:59] God one-on-one
[1:51:01] this is why we must keep everything
[1:51:03] under the blood
[1:51:04] because we want confidence
[1:51:08] everybody say we want confidence
[1:51:10] now brother Brown said if there's
[1:51:11] something in your life that condemns you
[1:51:13] you'd better make that right I don't
[1:51:15] care what in the world see you just
[1:51:17] can't operate right the Holy Spirit
[1:51:19] can't deal with you when you've got
[1:51:21] Prejudice selfishness and all those
[1:51:23] things in you the Holy Spirit can never
[1:51:25] bless you you might get some
[1:51:27] intellectual emotion some work up but if
[1:51:30] there's that something in you then it
[1:51:31] takes the confidence away
[1:51:35] we're still talking about fear now
[1:51:39] if there's something there that takes
[1:51:40] away that Faith amen and that confidence
[1:51:43] and and remember God knows your heart
[1:51:45] God knows my heart
[1:51:47] God knows all about us
[1:51:50] he so knows us that he's the one that
[1:51:53] puts that condemnation there
[1:51:55] he's the one
[1:51:57] we can call it conviction
[1:51:59] whatever
[1:52:02] now there is such a difference between a
[1:52:05] person who whose heart doesn't condemn
[1:52:08] them
[1:52:09] and whose heart does condemn
[1:52:12] and and there's a difference
[1:52:14] brother Brown gives the example of a
[1:52:16] woman getting married and she's afraid
[1:52:18] that she's not going to have a baby she
[1:52:20] won't have it
[1:52:22] see that fear
[1:52:24] if she's afraid she's not going to have
[1:52:26] it she won't have it
[1:52:29] no but let her go and adopt a baby then
[1:52:32] she'll have one
[1:52:34] see what it it he said now the book
[1:52:36] claims that that's nine out of ten will
[1:52:39] do that
[1:52:40] why it sets her body in the right
[1:52:43] condition
[1:52:45] or the right emotion
[1:52:47] now he says go ask your doctor and see
[1:52:50] if that's not right why it puts her in
[1:52:53] the right attitude
[1:52:57] now this means something to us because
[1:52:59] see if if if fear is there it brings a
[1:53:03] certain attitude
[1:53:05] if confidence comes it brings a certain
[1:53:08] attitude
[1:53:09] if fear comes it'll affect your worship
[1:53:11] if you have confidence it'll affect your
[1:53:14] worship
[1:53:15] if if you have if you have fear it'll
[1:53:18] affect how you you listen to the word
[1:53:20] and how you receive the word if you have
[1:53:23] confidence it affects you on how you
[1:53:25] receive the word and how you hear the
[1:53:26] word it all depends on whether the
[1:53:29] confidence is there the faith is there
[1:53:31] or fear has gripped your heart
[1:53:35] it's true
[1:53:37] can you say man so condemnation brings a
[1:53:41] fear upon us to where we become
[1:53:43] paralyzed and God can't do nothing for
[1:53:46] us
[1:53:48] ain't that right job brother Brown says
[1:53:51] job said the things that I feared worse
[1:53:53] has come upon me see you want to be
[1:53:55] above everything to where there's no
[1:53:57] condemnation or nothing to you you've
[1:53:59] got to live like real Christians live in
[1:54:02] the presence of God live daily hourly
[1:54:04] momently say nothing do nothing go
[1:54:07] nowhere see Let It Be Christ like
[1:54:09] everything you do all your actions God
[1:54:12] requires us absolutely to abstain from
[1:54:15] all the things of the world separation
[1:54:17] the world wants mixers they will go down
[1:54:20] to the beach and bathe and and have card
[1:54:22] parties in the basement bunco in the
[1:54:24] church let me tell you God wants
[1:54:26] separators who will separate men and
[1:54:29] women from sin listen it condemns
[1:54:33] so now you can understand why the
[1:54:35] churches are full of people that have
[1:54:38] fear upon them
[1:54:41] but there's an elect that is going to be
[1:54:43] have confidence
[1:54:45] that is gonna drive that fear now we've
[1:54:47] been given the secret on how to get rid
[1:54:50] of that fear keep your relationship with
[1:54:52] God right let nothing come in between
[1:54:56] you and God
[1:55:01] for he is our confidence
[1:55:04] I hope that's okay
[1:55:07] did you know man's not made to lie
[1:55:11] you take a person
[1:55:16] take take brother shamaya
[1:55:19] you know uh
[1:55:21] it's about 12 46 12 45 I guess
[1:55:25] which means it's time for me to close
[1:55:28] but
[1:55:29] you you you take brother schmann in a
[1:55:32] week later week from today's got a
[1:55:34] friend that's in trouble with the law
[1:55:37] and so he likes that friend so he's
[1:55:39] going to go
[1:55:40] and vouch for that friend and so he goes
[1:55:42] up there and tells the law
[1:55:44] I I I I was there
[1:55:47] you know maybe in Chicago I was here in
[1:55:51] Chicago
[1:55:52] last week Sunday at 12 45 I was there so
[1:55:57] I know he didn't do it I was with him
[1:56:00] then they put him on the LIE detectors
[1:56:04] now he's telling them
[1:56:06] straight face he's given all the best he
[1:56:09] can give it I was here I know he didn't
[1:56:11] do it but you know what that lie
[1:56:13] detector is going to do he's lying
[1:56:15] he's lying why because man wasn't made
[1:56:18] to lie
[1:56:21] right
[1:56:22] man man wasn't so brother Brown says now
[1:56:27] intellectually intellectually brother
[1:56:29] shamaya could be could could be telling
[1:56:33] telling him right you know but they've
[1:56:36] got something a machine that'll go
[1:56:39] deeper
[1:56:39] than the intellect that goes Deeper Than
[1:56:42] Just Words it goes down into that soul
[1:56:46] and there's something in that Soul no
[1:56:48] matter what it's saying here
[1:56:49] and no matter what's here there's
[1:56:52] something in that soul that they've
[1:56:53] actually got a machine
[1:56:56] to find out what's there
[1:56:58] and Cindy's lying it's not right because
[1:57:01] the heart is condemning him
[1:57:04] right he's saying one thing but down in
[1:57:07] his soul
[1:57:09] it's speaking out and they got a machine
[1:57:11] to pick it up
[1:57:13] so he's lying
[1:57:16] now God knows our thoughts
[1:57:19] he looks upon the heart
[1:57:22] I know that word scripture has been so
[1:57:24] abused and misplaced where God does not
[1:57:27] look upon the outward appearance he
[1:57:29] looks upon the heart so they say the
[1:57:31] outward appearance doesn't matter it
[1:57:33] does matter
[1:57:36] but one thing about it what more matters
[1:57:38] is your heart your soul
[1:57:41] and you want your soul and your body you
[1:57:44] want your spirit you want everything to
[1:57:45] line up
[1:57:47] that way when God looks at that soul and
[1:57:50] it cries out God can look at your life
[1:57:52] and say it's truth
[1:57:54] is truth it's truth
[1:57:57] right oh I love God but he knows what's
[1:58:01] saying in the heart
[1:58:02] he lying
[1:58:04] he's either saying he lied or saying
[1:58:06] it's the truth it's the truth
[1:58:09] can you say man and when it all lines up
[1:58:12] it's the truth it's the truth there's a
[1:58:15] confidence
[1:58:16] I don't know how it all works but I do
[1:58:19] know there becomes a confidence not a
[1:58:21] condemnation I think all of us have have
[1:58:24] come to a place that when we've done is
[1:58:26] wrong
[1:58:27] there's something that condemns us
[1:58:30] you try to pray that thing's still there
[1:58:32] it's condemning you try to you try to
[1:58:35] serve God it's still there and what it's
[1:58:37] doing it's taking away your confidence
[1:58:39] trying to pray you can't believe God for
[1:58:41] it now you're trying to serve God and
[1:58:44] it's still there why it's taken away the
[1:58:46] confidence that condemnation but you get
[1:58:49] it under the blood and Watch What
[1:58:50] Happens
[1:58:52] you come with a smile
[1:58:54] Lord I love you why because now you know
[1:58:58] he loves you
[1:59:00] there's nothing there to block that
[1:59:02] voice
[1:59:03] there's nothing there to block that
[1:59:05] loving voice to you
[1:59:07] seeing allows Satan to come in and start
[1:59:10] speaking to you
[1:59:11] and you're trying to Lord do you really
[1:59:12] love me God do you are you really for me
[1:59:14] God God is a is it just if there's
[1:59:17] something there get rid of it I don't
[1:59:19] care what it is it could be the smallest
[1:59:21] thing if there's something there because
[1:59:22] you don't want fear
[1:59:25] you want confidence in God
[1:59:30] if the musicians will come
[1:59:34] brother Brown said if you can't throw
[1:59:36] back an old Prejudice and selfishness
[1:59:39] how do you expect God to ever answer
[1:59:40] your prayer oh you can speak with
[1:59:42] tongues and jump over the seats and
[1:59:44] shout and beat the tambourines and talk
[1:59:45] about your neighbor out there
[1:59:47] don't you expect God to ever answer
[1:59:49] prayer for you
[1:59:52] another place he said God will never
[1:59:54] hear your prayer as long as you hide
[1:59:55] iniquity in your heart he will not do it
[1:59:57] see so if if our heart condemns us
[2:00:01] then no matter what we say or do we
[2:00:03] cannot have confidence toward God
[2:00:06] so we've got to keep the relationship
[2:00:09] keep in relationship with God brother
[2:00:12] Branham another place said there's so
[2:00:13] much doubt and fear and trembling
[2:00:15] wondering if it will could it happen as
[2:00:18] long as that exists the church can never
[2:00:20] stand upright and when every talk of
[2:00:23] fear is vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[2:00:25] completely in control of the church then
[2:00:28] all fears are gone and that church has
[2:00:31] the power
[2:00:32] amen
[2:00:34] thinking of this first John 4 18 it says
[2:00:38] there is no fear in love
[2:00:44] but perfect love casteth out all fear
[2:00:48] because fear hath torment and he that
[2:00:51] feareth is not made perfect in love
[2:00:53] now notice 19th verse we love him
[2:00:58] because he first loved us
[2:01:02] right
[2:01:04] we love him love divine love can't exist
[2:01:08] without his love shining upon us
[2:01:11] and when there's something that is
[2:01:13] blocking it now it doesn't mean that
[2:01:14] God's love has changed toward us
[2:01:16] it means that there's something there's
[2:01:18] the clouds that is blocking it from
[2:01:21] actually reflecting upon us and for you
[2:01:23] know it we have an effect because we're
[2:01:25] only reflectors
[2:01:26] right we're only reflectors so when his
[2:01:29] love can absolutely shine upon our soul
[2:01:33] then we have confidence and we love him
[2:01:36] back and not only do we love him back
[2:01:38] but we love everyone else
[2:01:40] as he loves us remember as I have loved
[2:01:43] you so love you one another
[2:01:46] right
[2:01:47] so we we find
[2:01:51] that love towards God cannot exist until
[2:01:54] we get the revelation of his love toward
[2:01:56] us and until that come
[2:01:58] fear will torment us and notice what
[2:02:01] happens when fear comes a man will
[2:02:03] always constantly
[2:02:06] question God's love for him he will
[2:02:08] questions God's grace toward him he will
[2:02:11] question God's dealing with him he will
[2:02:13] question the promises of God as to
[2:02:15] whether or not they are for him fear
[2:02:18] hath torment
[2:02:21] amen
[2:02:24] all do you love him
[2:02:27] how can a man correctly love God and his
[2:02:30] neighbor when he has lost his confidence
[2:02:32] in God
[2:02:35] he then becomes needy
[2:02:38] so he looks for approval security
[2:02:40] applauds
[2:02:43] he looks for the accolades of men
[2:02:46] and many good men
[2:02:48] have compromised on God's word
[2:02:53] simply because they're in need of
[2:02:55] approval they're in need
[2:02:58] of a standing ovation so
[2:03:02] they're in need of Praises of men
[2:03:04] which is a sign they've lost confidence
[2:03:06] in God
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:09] fear has gripped them
[2:03:12] many young people have turned aside to
[2:03:15] the world because they're not competent
[2:03:17] in the love of God
[2:03:19] so then they become
[2:03:21] fearful of rejection fear of being made
[2:03:24] fun of fear of being alone
[2:03:26] fear fear fear fear
[2:03:29] but God has not given us that spirit of
[2:03:31] fear
[2:03:32] the Bible says we've not received the
[2:03:34] spirit of fear but we've received the
[2:03:36] spirit of adoption
[2:03:38] whereby we cry have a father
[2:03:41] our God
[2:03:42] ain't that right
[2:03:44] to serve and Paul would tell us that the
[2:03:47] spirit itself Bears witness with our
[2:03:49] spirit that we are sons of God
[2:03:53] the confidence
[2:03:55] remains
[2:03:57] all the Lord is wonderful
[2:04:00] what song Greater is he greater is he
[2:04:05] that is
[2:04:08] that is greater is he that is in Me
[2:04:12] Greater is he that is in me
[2:04:16] he that is in the world
[2:04:20] will on the day a panic cost a rushing
[2:04:26] Mighty Wind
[2:04:29] blew into the upper room
[2:04:33] and baptized all of them
[2:04:37] with the power greater than
[2:04:42] foreign
[2:04:44] [Music]
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:05:03] greater is he that is in me
[2:05:06] than he that is in the world
[2:05:10] will Satan's like a roaring lion roam
[2:05:16] into and fro what is he doing he's
[2:05:20] seeking he's instilling fear in so many
[2:05:23] people
[2:05:25] hallelujah oh many many Souls have been
[2:05:30] his prey
[2:05:32] fall in some weak hour oh but God has
[2:05:37] promised us today is
[2:05:41] overcoming part I say now greater
[2:05:47] God is greater
[2:05:49] [Music]
