[54:15] deep deep love and an understanding that
[54:19] God loved us first and that is the only
[54:23] reason that we can love him back is
[54:25] because he has expressed his love to us
[54:28] and he's redeemed us he's cleansed us
[54:31] from all of our sins and
[54:33] unrighteousness just freed us from all
[54:36] condemnation and uh such a a liberty to

[55:00] time when we can uh come here and uh and
[55:04] just uh be able to minister the word to
[55:06] you and uh you've just always had a
[55:09] special place in our hearts and uh we
[55:12] just uh love brother Shawn and sister
[55:15] Heather very much and as brother Shawn
[55:18] was saying it's uh it goes beyond just
[55:21] uh natural blood but uh just a real uh
[55:25] just a real God Godly love uh uh between
[55:29] us as as uh there is between all the uh
[55:33] children of God and and uh just know
[55:36] that this is only the uh the Prelude to
[55:40] spending eternity with one another and
[55:43] and uh we'll be able to just uh just put
[55:48] a put put our Sword Down uh one of these
[55:51] days and uh be able to just uh
[55:54] Fellowship around all of the testimonies
[55:57] and all the victories that God has
[55:59] brought in our lives and and uh we're
[56:02] we're in a great age of Victory and I
[56:05] believe that we're we're not just going
[56:07] to barely get by but we're we're
[56:10] actually uh we're actually Overcomers in
[56:13] this age and and uh I believe that
[56:16] there's something within us that is just
[56:18] uh uh just requiring that we press the
[56:21] battle and keep pressing and and uh keep
[56:24] keep overcoming and and uh we just want
[56:27] to uh just uh we'll just go ahead and
[56:31] turn into uh our Bibles at this time we
[56:35] appreciate all the songs and uh you can
[56:37] just turn to Matthew 17 and uh beginning
[56:41] at verse 10 and then acts the 3r chapter
[56:44] verse 19 and uh Psalms 63 beginning at
[56:49] verse
[56:49] 1 and uh you may have heard that we are
[56:53] in a uh the last couple of months we
[56:56] we've been in a uh little bit of a
[56:58] transition and uh we uh just felt the
[57:02] Lord changing the direction uh in our in
[57:06] our ministry and uh in our family and so
[57:10] we're now attending there at uh uh true
[57:13] word Tabernacle and uh brother Wayne who
[57:16] is uh no stranger to this church but uh
[57:20] uh is now uh my pastor and so we just
[57:24] want to uh bring greetings from from uh
[57:27] brother Wayne to the church as well and
[57:30] and uh so uh we just have something that
[57:33] uh seemed like the Lord just woke us up
[57:36] in the middle of the night and just
[57:38] begin to deal with us on on this uh
[57:41] subject and uh we just uh pray that God
[57:44] can uh just minister to us uh we just
[57:48] want to Matthew 17 and beginning at
[57:51] verse 10 and we'll read to the 11th
[57:55] verse
[57:57] and his disciples asked him saying why
[58:01] then say the scribes that Elias must
[58:05] first come and Jesus answered and said
[58:08] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[58:12] and restore all things aren't you glad
[58:16] that you have an understanding of what
[58:18] you're reading and that you we are
[58:20] living in the restitution of all things
[58:24] now acts the thir chapter verse
[58:30] 19 repent ye therefore and be converted
[58:35] that your sins may be blotted out when
[58:39] the times of refreshing shall come from
[58:41] the presence of the Lord and He Shall
[58:45] send Jesus Christ which before was
[58:48] preached unto you whom the Heaven Must
[58:52] receive until the times of restitution
[58:55] of all things which God hath spoken by
[58:59] the mouth of all his holy prophets since
[59:04] the world begin so all the prophets have
[59:08] been speaking of the very age that we're
[59:10] living in but God has chose you and I to
[59:14] live in this age and to partake of this
[59:17] age everything that God has promised in
[59:20] this age and I believe that God has
[59:23] promised in the season and the times of
[59:26] restitution of all things he's also
[59:29] promised a times of refreshing from the
[59:32] presence of the Lord and uh I'd like to
[59:36] minister on the times of refreshing now
[59:40] if we could just one more scripture
[59:42] there in Psalms
[59:44] 63 and we'll be we'll just read the
[59:47] first three
[59:54] verses oh God God Thou Art my God early
[59:58] will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for
[1:00:02] thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry
[1:00:06] and thirsty land where no water is to
[1:00:09] see thy power and thy Glory so as I have
[1:00:14] seen thee in the sanctuary because thy
[1:00:17] loving kindness is better than life my
[1:00:21] lips shall praise thee and may God just
[1:00:25] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[1:00:27] word and you can have your
[1:00:29] seats but again we'll just Minister on
[1:00:32] times of
[1:00:34] refreshing and you know the the prophet
[1:00:38] would tell us that Jesus always goes
[1:00:41] where he is invited no matter where it's
[1:00:44] at he will come and uh we can see that
[1:00:48] he come to aian in one time and and then
[1:00:52] another time he went to the fiery
[1:00:54] furnace and it was David that wrote that
[1:00:58] if I make my bed in hell he will be
[1:01:02] there and he will come to the poorest he
[1:01:05] will come to the richest and uh even to
[1:01:09] the most immoral to the meanest to the
[1:01:12] lowest he will come anywhere he is
[1:01:15] invited no matter what your conditions
[1:01:18] and what uh position in life is he will
[1:01:22] still come isn't that a tremendous
[1:01:25] promise that the Lord Jesus keeps all of
[1:01:29] his appointments and he will not come in
[1:01:32] an imaginary way but he comes in reality
[1:01:36] and he comes in such a personal
[1:01:39] visitation uh to bring a positive effect
[1:01:42] in each of our lives and uh we believe
[1:01:46] that his presence brings change uh his
[1:01:50] presence brings life it brings
[1:01:53] restoration just one time in his
[1:01:56] presence can uh change the most
[1:02:00] immoralist can change the most worst of
[1:02:04] conditions and it's because it's the
[1:02:07] presence of almighty God and there is
[1:02:10] something about the presence of God that
[1:02:13] there is nothing there is nothing that
[1:02:16] the devil can do uh that can hold back
[1:02:20] the presence of God that can defy the
[1:02:22] presence of God that can keep the
[1:02:25] presence of God God from working in the
[1:02:27] heart of a Believer and to that can work
[1:02:30] in in in the elect uh and that
[1:02:33] predestinated heart and when we come
[1:02:36] into His presence we're changed I think
[1:02:40] that is a powerful thing uh the prophet
[1:02:43] in his presence would just go through
[1:02:45] these things in the sermon in his
[1:02:48] presence when we come into His presence
[1:02:51] were changed never to be the same I
[1:02:55] think of how the the prophet in the
[1:02:57] presence of God
[1:02:59] unrecognized he says oh the greatest
[1:03:01] pleasure I know of is to pray until I
[1:03:05] can realize that I'm in the presence of
[1:03:08] God and recognize it I think that ought
[1:03:11] to be the thrill of the church is the
[1:03:14] presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the
[1:03:17] god that made the promise standing among
[1:03:20] us feel his presence and see his word
[1:03:24] and see it Vindicated it ought to give
[1:03:27] Faith to make cripples walk blind see
[1:03:30] deaf hear the dumb speak and I I think
[1:03:34] of how that uh the presence of God when
[1:03:38] we see the word made manifest see the
[1:03:42] word Vindicated that is the
[1:03:45] manifestation of God's presence and to
[1:03:48] be able to recognize his presence and it
[1:03:52] it's a it's when you recognize his
[1:03:54] presence that is when there is a power
[1:03:58] that is released to the believer that
[1:04:01] God can move supernaturally in your
[1:04:04] heart and in your home and in any
[1:04:07] condition any circumstance and that God
[1:04:10] can just pour out his Spirit but first
[1:04:13] you've got to recognize his presence and
[1:04:17] so when you see that God what God is
[1:04:20] doing in this hour and then recognize it
[1:04:24] that is not for another day it's not for
[1:04:27] the future but it is actually the
[1:04:30] presence of God that is being made known
[1:04:33] among us today then it is the power that
[1:04:38] the believer has been waiting for to see
[1:04:42] God manifested in every heart and every
[1:04:45] life and and in our homes and you see it
[1:04:49] is uh that it is that place it is it is
[1:04:53] not the outer court or the holy place
[1:04:55] place we but we we're talking about the
[1:04:59] the Tabernacle of witness in the in the
[1:05:02] wilderness and how that there was uh
[1:05:05] three parts to that Tabernacle there was
[1:05:08] the outer courts which was uh subject to
[1:05:12] the weather and and the sun could be
[1:05:14] shining but then the clouds would roll
[1:05:16] in and it would block out that sunshine
[1:05:20] and then there was the Holy place which
[1:05:22] was the seven you know the seven
[1:05:24] candlesticks it was a man-made light and
[1:05:27] that had to there had to be the oil that
[1:05:30] was put into that to keep it burning but
[1:05:33] sometimes it got smoked up and and uh
[1:05:37] but then there was the holiest of holies
[1:05:40] and that was a place where uh Aaron was
[1:05:44] elected Aaron being a type of the
[1:05:47] believer elected and chosen called to go
[1:05:52] into the secret place of the most high
[1:05:54] to go beyond that that Veil amen break
[1:05:59] through break break in beyond that veil
[1:06:03] of of humanity and reasoning and
[1:06:07] unbelief and once get into that place
[1:06:10] then there was that Halo of Light which
[1:06:13] was the shik of glory and it was in that
[1:06:17] presence amen where Aron's Rod which was
[1:06:21] dead budded and brought forth fruit and
[1:06:25] and and it was in that place where uh
[1:06:28] the shoe bread which got stale in the
[1:06:32] outer cord where it got stale and
[1:06:35] stagnated and got Wiggle Worms to it
[1:06:38] amen but in the holiest of holies the
[1:06:41] shoe bread never got stale never got you
[1:06:45] know amen it was fresh from generation
[1:06:49] to generation the believer it didn't
[1:06:51] matter amen if it was your if it was
[1:06:54] your grand mother your grandpa or if it
[1:06:58] was this day amen you had a right every
[1:07:02] generation had a right to have have a
[1:07:05] part of that original Mana that is even
[1:07:09] the ministry the prophet of God would
[1:07:11] say the ministry has a right to eat of
[1:07:15] that original bread of life and and
[1:07:18] preach from that original bread of life
[1:07:21] preach from the tree of life amen which
[1:07:24] would bring forth the presence of God
[1:07:27] into the church you see it is the holy
[1:07:31] spirit that is the refreshing from the
[1:07:34] presence of God that was what is
[1:07:37] prophesied in Jew 2 amen that he would
[1:07:40] pour out his Spirit upon all F All Flesh
[1:07:46] and this is the rest where you cease
[1:07:50] from all of your labors and all of your
[1:07:54] works and and it's a it's it's a
[1:07:57] refreshing unto the heart of the
[1:08:00] believer to be brought into the secret
[1:08:05] place of the most high God where the
[1:08:07] world knows nothing about it but you're
[1:08:10] elected to that place amen where God
[1:08:15] bring pours out a refreshing of the Holy
[1:08:18] Ghost and brings forth life and and

[1:12:22] real moisture of a real Holy Ghost

[1:12:59] us all reclining getting away from the
[1:13:02] spirit it's become too natural a thing
[1:13:05] to us we must Worship in the spirit and

[1:13:15] our hearts can I read that again not
[1:13:19] only our message should be the flame of
[1:13:22] the hour it should be the flame in our
[1:13:25] Hearts it's got to be in our hearts or
[1:13:29] we can't rightly present it to the

[1:14:00] word has the potential as a seed to go
[1:14:05] into a heart and bring forth its full
[1:14:08] potential every seed will bring forth of
[1:14:12] its kind amen and everything that God
[1:14:15] promised in the Bible is laying there in
[1:14:19] seed form but all it is needing amen is

[1:14:26] little bit of the falling of the rain
[1:14:29] amen moisture of the Holy Ghost to fall
[1:14:32] upon the heart uh God promised that he
[1:14:35] would do it uh God placed these promises
[1:14:38] in his word uh there's nothing wrong
[1:14:40] with the promise there's nothing wrong
[1:14:43] with the message uh and there's nothing
[1:14:45] wrong uh with God's forn knowledge uh
[1:14:48] that he predestinated you uh unto the
[1:14:50] adoption of children uh oh yes sir
[1:14:53] there's nothing wrong with God
[1:14:55] but he promised in this hour that he

[1:15:43] is the principle of a Revival of people
[1:15:47] who are flex flexible not to an
[1:15:50] intellectual talk but to the coming of
[1:15:53] the holy spirit in the form of a baptism

[1:30:26] Thanksgiving
[1:30:28] Hallelujah
[1:30:29] shoutings an understanding of what it's
[1:30:35] about you see this ain't some
[1:30:37] intellectual
[1:30:39] talk but this is this is the church
[1:30:43] laying in the
[1:30:45] presence of almighty God to Tender
[1:30:50] up do you realize that it's in that
[1:30:54] Harvest
[1:30:55] Time when that grain comes to its
[1:30:58] maturity Hallelujah that is the Sun that
[1:31:02] tenders it
[1:31:03] up it doesn't get hard and callous and
[1:31:07] oh no no the sun tenders it up and I
[1:31:12] tell you friends that's what the Holy
[1:31:13] Ghost the presence of almighty God we've
[1:31:16] been laying in the presence of this
[1:31:19] message and I tell you what it's doing
[1:31:21] it's tendering us up it's not making
[1:31:23] making us callous it's not making us
[1:31:26] hard it's not making us critical but
[1:31:29] it's something that is tendering our
[1:31:32] hearts before his presence I tell you
[1:31:35] you can't look at one another the same
[1:31:37] when you're in his
[1:31:39] presence you cannot be in the ripening
[1:31:43] presence of the so the message of the
[1:31:47] hour and stay hard critical and
[1:31:51] callous I tell you friends I'm a witness
[1:31:54] of it Hallelujah that's why every
[1:31:57] believer the middle wall of partition
[1:31:59] has been torn down between the seven
[1:32:01] Church ages and the holiest of holies
[1:32:05] amen that's why the prophet stood in the
[1:32:07] breach and said you've got to come on
[1:32:09] over into the revealing of the son of
[1:32:13] man it's because this is where you're
[1:32:15] going to get ripe this is where you're
[1:32:18] going to get tender this is where the
[1:32:21] spirits are going to fall off of you
[1:32:23] this is where you're not going to be
[1:32:25] controlled by the smoke of man-made
[1:32:28] Creed Dogma Traditions the religions of
[1:32:31] man you've got to come into the
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:37] presence you see the mechanics don't run
[1:32:40] the
[1:32:41] church it's the
[1:32:43] Dynamics the Holy Ghost that's that gets
[1:32:46] in this
[1:32:47] word it's the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:52] in there to set that a fire
[1:32:54] you see the prophet of God would say
[1:32:56] it's not what Seminary teaches you all
[1:32:58] the Theology and the
[1:33:00] Greek
[1:33:01] interpretations but it's the holy ghost
[1:33:04] that sets the word on fire that's right
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:10] hallelujah now you see
[1:33:12] John had to get caught up in the spirit
[1:33:15] on the Lord's
[1:33:17] day now now if you're not in the
[1:33:21] spirit then I tell you the Lord's Day
[1:33:23] can look like like a terrible
[1:33:26] thing you see when you're not in the
[1:33:28] spirit you can look at the natural and
[1:33:32] all you see is the Prelude of
[1:33:34] tribulation you see the you see the pale
[1:33:37] horse rider already begin to ride death
[1:33:41] beginning to ride spiritual deaths gross
[1:33:44] Darkness Hallelujah but you see it's
[1:33:47] Revelations the fourth chapter where
[1:33:50] John heard the same voice that was in re
[1:33:53] Galatians 1 and he was saying John come
[1:33:57] up
[1:33:58] higher he saw that there was an open
[1:34:01] door and that door is Christ the word
[1:34:06] the word now is open and John a type of
[1:34:10] the Bride is coming out of the gross
[1:34:13] Darkness out of leosia condition out of
[1:34:18] lukewarmness and coming into an eighth
[1:34:21] age an eighth day of a bride Agee where
[1:34:25] there's
[1:34:26] life where the presence of God is
[1:34:29] remember he was kicked out of that LE
[1:34:31] out of see of Pentecostal age but the
[1:34:34] bride has been called out of that age
[1:34:38] into this age where she can be in the
[1:34:42] presence of
[1:34:45] God praise the Lord not just a man-made
[1:34:49] Revival now it's not your pastor working
[1:34:52] you up into a Revival
[1:34:55] hallelujah it's not your pastor amen
[1:34:57] it's not relying upon a pastor it's not
[1:35:00] relying Upon A five-fold Min the
[1:35:02] five-fold ministry is only preaching the
[1:35:05] open book but the bride is walking
[1:35:09] through
[1:35:11] iten Hallelujah the bride by faith is
[1:35:16] taking the word and walking into that
[1:35:19] into the presence of almighty God where
[1:35:21] all things are possible
[1:35:25] you see John now John a type of the
[1:35:28] Bride there in there in Ephesians the
[1:35:31] first chapter Paul would say that I I
[1:35:33] pray now I've heard of your faith but I
[1:35:36] I pray that the spirit of wisdom and
[1:35:38] Revelation would Open the Eyes of your
[1:35:41] understanding that you can catch the
[1:35:43] knowledge of Jesus Christ that you can
[1:35:46] understand the hope of your calling I
[1:35:48] tell you the hope of your calling is
[1:35:50] you've been called out of Le oosa and
[1:35:53] why have you been called out to come
[1:35:55] into a
[1:35:57] marriage and every time that you hear

[1:36:02] this message do you realize you're
[1:36:04] coming you have come into an invisible
[1:36:07] Union you have come into the marriage do
[1:36:11] you realize that this is your season
[1:36:13] this is your hour in the times of the
[1:36:15] refreshing of the presence of God in the
[1:36:18] times of the restitution of all things

[1:36:34] you've come back to the Tree of Life
[1:36:37] come back to Divine Fellowship come back
[1:36:41] to eternal
[1:36:44] life this is beyond the Theologian this
[1:36:47] is beyond the
[1:36:49] intellectual this is on up into the
[1:36:51] realm of the Lord's thing King this is
[1:36:55] not man's man's intelligence this is the
[1:36:59] intelligence of
[1:37:01] God amen amen the intelligence of God
[1:37:07] that's why Jesus said in John 14 is this
[1:37:09] okay St John the 14th chapter when
[1:37:12] he the
[1:37:14] person of the Holy Ghost is come not
[1:37:18] just a shout not just a baptism not just
[1:37:21] speaking in tongues not just the rest of
[1:37:23] restoration of the gifts but when he the
[1:37:27] person of the Holy Ghost comes what he
[1:37:31] going to do he's going to lead you into
[1:37:35] all truth the prophet of God in the
[1:37:39] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:37:40] of the Earthly bride says show you what
[1:37:43] day you're living in that's what the
[1:37:45] Holy Ghost is doing now when he comes
[1:37:47] he's going to show you what day you're
[1:37:49] living in and then another thing you'll
[1:37:53] know him by he'll show you things to
[1:37:57] come right back to the prophetic again
[1:38:02] when he's come I tell you that's
[1:38:04] perfectly Revelations the 10th chapter
[1:38:08] that the mighty Angel which is the
[1:38:11] Covenant Angel he's got a rainbow over
[1:38:14] his head the mighty Angel is the
[1:38:16] Covenant Angel which is Christ which is
[1:38:21] aen first th is it first Thessalonians
[1:38:23] the fourth chapter the Lord himself
[1:38:27] shall descend with a shout the message
[1:38:32] that is bring Gathering the bride
[1:38:34] calling the bride out of dark
[1:38:37] denominationalism into the
[1:38:39] resurrection of the word in flesh which
[1:38:44] makes you the voice of the Resurrection
[1:38:47] written Epistles manifesting the word
[1:38:54] now that is the Lord himself shall
[1:38:57] descend what's he descending with he's
[1:39:00] descending with a title deed he's
[1:39:03] descending with an open book and Paul
[1:39:06] said that the Lord
[1:39:09] him is that spirit and where the spirit
[1:39:14] of the Lord is there is Liberty because
[1:39:18] the veil is taken off of the human heart
[1:39:21] and they see it and they're walking in
[1:39:25] the prophetic vision of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:28] for the
[1:39:30] church you'll be caught up in the Lord's
[1:39:34] day you're going to be caught up you're
[1:39:37] going to be caught up when the Lord
[1:39:39] himself descends with the vision for the
[1:39:41] church and God is going to show you your
[1:39:44] future I tell you friends amen there's
[1:39:47] there's there's so much grumbling and
[1:39:50] and dejected people is because they're
[1:39:52] not looking got the
[1:39:54] vision but I pray the eyes of your
[1:39:57] understanding would be open that you can
[1:39:59] catch the vision the opening of the word
[1:40:02] is prophetic of your
[1:40:06] future not
[1:40:08] defeat not Leon AIA not Doom and Gloom
[1:40:13] not a world falling apart but you're a
[1:40:16] part of another civilization a super
[1:40:19] race I called our people for his name's
[1:40:22] sake a people being
[1:40:25] refreshed by his
[1:40:30] presence you see what is his presence to
[1:40:33] do is to anoint your
[1:40:35] faith intellectually Moses heard it he
[1:40:39] heard at all of his life who he was he
[1:40:41] heard that he was to be the deliverer he
[1:40:44] heard that he was the bride he heard
[1:40:46] that he was the final voice to the final
[1:40:48] age he heard of the bride's
[1:40:51] Revival you know what I'm saying
[1:40:54] now and Moses under that intellectual
[1:40:57] Revival killed one
[1:40:59] Egyptian and then he had to run for his
[1:41:02] life you see intellectually he said I'm
[1:41:05] the deliverer I guess I'll go ahead and
[1:41:07] start right now but under that
[1:41:10] intellectual thing he didn't have the
[1:41:12] secret he wasn't living under the
[1:41:14] atmosphere
[1:41:16] yet you say well brother Jonathan how do
[1:41:18] you know he wasn't in the atmosphere
[1:41:20] because 40 years later under the right
[1:41:24] atmosphere he stood before pharaoh and
[1:41:27] said let my people go knowing that just
[1:41:30] one of those Spears could take his life
[1:41:33] just one of those swords could take his
[1:41:35] head off but he was living under the
[1:41:37] right atmosphere of an
[1:41:41] exodus I tell you friends you say well H
[1:41:44] how do I get in that kind of an
[1:41:45] atmosphere well the prophet of God would
[1:41:48] say that what Moses needed was his faith
[1:41:52] anointed he had he had the mechanics he
[1:41:55] knew the message he knew the quotes he
[1:41:59] knew what he was supposed to be doing
[1:42:01] but now he needed what the presence of
[1:42:04] the Lord amen had for his life I tell
[1:42:08] you that burning bush had what Moses
[1:42:10] lacked and that was the anointing to
[1:42:13] make his faith live
[1:42:17] amen prise the Lord praise the name of
[1:42:19] the Lord amen you see Moses was on the
[1:42:23] back side of the desert dried
[1:42:25] up forgot the
[1:42:27] vision probably even
[1:42:30] carnal thinking that he was just no good
[1:42:34] worthless and then he was on the back
[1:42:36] side of the desert with a wife that was
[1:42:38] whooping him into shape because she had
[1:42:41] a
[1:42:42] temper and the prophet of God would say
[1:42:45] God knew exactly what he was doing when
[1:42:47] he put Moses who was a hotthead
[1:42:50] himself and put her with Zapora which
[1:42:54] was a hot head and she was whipping him
[1:42:56] into
[1:42:58] shape don't tell me God doesn't know
[1:43:01] what he's doing in our lives God tell
[1:43:04] don't tell me the footsteps of the
[1:43:06] righteous are not ordered of the lord
[1:43:08] it's too late I already see it I'm a
[1:43:12] witness of it I know God knows what he's
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:17] doing Moses take off your shoes the
[1:43:20] prophet of God said he had heard that
[1:43:21] before
[1:43:24] Moses what are you doing in this tent
[1:43:26] with your shoes
[1:43:28] on well
[1:43:30] anyways you see he was coming into the
[1:43:33] presence of almighty God and he had to
[1:43:36] get right he had to come into sincerity
[1:43:40] he had humility he he had to he had to
[1:43:43] get his old stinky smelly thinking off
[1:43:46] of him that's right he wasn't going to
[1:43:49] Walk This Way any longer Hallelujah he
[1:43:52] wasn't going to walk this way he wasn't
[1:43:53] going to talk that way any longer I tell
[1:43:56] you why because he was coming into the
[1:43:57] pray he had an appointment with the
[1:44:01] mighty Angel yes
[1:44:03] amen and notice every excuse that Moses
[1:44:07] had well I I stutter well I can't do
[1:44:10] this well I can't do that well I'm no
[1:44:12] good well I'm a failure well every one
[1:44:14] of those excuses in the presence of
[1:44:17] almighty God was just
[1:44:20] disol disol in other words you can't
[1:44:23] talk yourself out of this people you
[1:44:25] can't talk yourself out of the Rapture
[1:44:27] brother and sister you cannot talk
[1:44:29] yourself out of the Great Commission

[1:44:43] lifeless the seed has moved into the
[1:44:47] grain the Bride of Jesus Christ and only

[1:45:23] them can fulfill Greater Works than
[1:45:25] these shall you do for I go into my
[1:45:27] father outside of the Bride that has
[1:45:29] been anointed by the pillar of fire to
[1:45:32] fulfill the vision of the open
[1:45:38] word you see Jacob had to come to a
[1:45:40] point in his life oh he had he had had
[1:45:44] Visions he had seen the Angels ascending
[1:45:46] and descending upon that ladder he had
[1:45:49] heard God speak to him but he come to a
[1:45:52] point his life that he said I've got to
[1:45:54] come into the presence of God I I've got
[1:45:58] I've got to have his presence I tell you
[1:46:02] God is so good God's so gracious because
[1:46:04] it was God that put that desire in Jacob
[1:46:07] Jacob had that desire all the whole
[1:46:11] time the whole time that he was running
[1:46:15] the whole time that he was working for
[1:46:17] his for his wife seven years once seven
[1:46:21] years again the whole time and now he's
[1:46:23] returning back into his rightful land
[1:46:26] amen and there is Esau going to kill him
[1:46:30] and all of that guilt all of that
[1:46:32] condemnation comes back up into his
[1:46:34] heart and God says this is an appointed
[1:46:39] time and God
[1:46:42] descends and God steps right in Jacob's
[1:46:46] way and oh the grace of God that Jacob
[1:46:51] that shyer that that oh that's but a
[1:46:56] Shyer but a Son of God now amen that he
[1:47:01] recognized the presence of almighty God
[1:47:04] and he be to wrestle with that angel and
[1:47:07] he wrestled and he wrestled and he
[1:47:09] wrestled and it was at the dawning or
[1:47:12] the rising of the Sun that his name was
[1:47:15] changed from Jacob subanner to Israel a
[1:47:19] prince with God because he wrestled with
[1:47:22] God
[1:47:23] and
[1:47:25] overcome I tell you friends again the
[1:47:28] devil don't have enough Jacob wrestled
[1:47:31] with the angel amen his life was changed
[1:47:35] his walk was changed it was at the
[1:47:38] rising of the son that the power of
[1:47:42] almighty God was released in his life
[1:47:45] and he never was the same oh the
[1:47:48] presence of God is the bride's Revival
[1:47:53] wrestling with the word wrestling with
[1:47:55] the promise God you promised it God you
[1:47:57] said so God I am your Royal seed I am a
[1:48:01] believer God you said you would bring
[1:48:04] times of refreshing God you said amen
[1:48:07] that my that I would not be withered H
[1:48:10] you promised uh that you have plant me
[1:48:12] in the rivers uh of Living Water I hold
[1:48:16] you to your promise oh
[1:48:20] God refresh me amen
[1:48:23] all
[1:48:24] right I think of when the prophet of God
[1:48:28] said that he went to Durban South Africa
[1:48:29] and there's two 100 I believe he said
[1:48:33] 200,000 people at the Durban
[1:48:36] racetrack he said oh he said the he said
[1:48:41] all they seen was one time the sign of
[1:48:44] the
[1:48:47] Messiah and they believed amen one sign
[1:48:53] now let's let's notice the condition
[1:48:55] that these people were in just a week
[1:48:57] before the prophet of God says a week
[1:49:00] before that they were in
[1:49:02] war with one
[1:49:05] another we're talking about
[1:49:08] tribes heathens yes sir we're not
[1:49:11] talking about Christians we're talking
[1:49:13] about
[1:49:14] heathens they've got their Spears they
[1:49:16] got their clubs they they they're at war
[1:49:20] with one another they're ha they hate
[1:49:23] they're wanting to kill one another and
[1:49:25] for all we know maybe they did maybe
[1:49:28] they were killing one another it maybe
[1:49:30] it gotten that
[1:49:31] far but just recognizing they were in
[1:49:35] the presence of almighty
[1:49:38] God they dropped
[1:49:41] everything in that kind of an atmosphere
[1:49:44] of love all the sudden the cripples
[1:49:48] begin to walk the blame begin to walk
[1:49:50] the the blind begin to see the
[1:49:53] ears begin to be unstopped all because
[1:49:57] they seen the word made
[1:50:00] manifest amen oh how Satan wants to
[1:50:05] Blind us to the reality of his word made
[1:50:08] manifest in this hour and just make us
[1:50:10] cold and lukewarm and just the message
[1:50:13] of tradition that's something that we
[1:50:14] just keep doing over and over and over
[1:50:16] come to church go home come to church go
[1:50:19] home do this do that and all the while
[1:50:22] the is trying to Blind our eyes through
[1:50:25] the vision of the son of man working in
[1:50:28] human flesh not your just your pastor
[1:50:30] yes your pastor but not just your pastor

[2:03:05] means to return to the former owner or
[2:03:08] bring back to former estate of
[2:03:12] condition don't you
[2:03:14] realize that what Jesus died for on
[2:03:19] Calvary and he's been interceding upon
[2:03:21] the church for seven Church
[2:03:24] ages but John looked and he wept because
[2:03:28] that book which was a book of redemption
[2:03:31] which held our names had been sealed up
[2:03:35] with Seven Seals and no one was worthy
[2:03:38] to look upon
[2:03:39] it this was after Calvary
[2:03:42] friends but this is the work of
[2:03:44] redemption now Jesus died to redeem as
[2:03:48] the kinsman redeemer but then the lamb
[2:03:51] had to come out of Eternity step in on
[2:03:54] the scene and take the book of
[2:03:57] redemption what is it it's Redemption
[2:04:01] claims everything that Adam had
[2:04:03] Redemptive rights but he lost his rights
[2:04:06] but now the lamb has come into full view
[2:04:09] did you hear me friends he's come into
[2:04:11] full view we're not guessing at this
[2:04:13] we're not trying to First search to find
[2:04:16] his presence the word has unveiled him
[2:04:19] he's come into Plain View for what
[2:04:22] Redemption
[2:04:24] claims and what is redemption it's
[2:04:28] restoration of all that has been lost
[2:04:32] everything Satan put a lean on your life
[2:04:35] but the de but God took us back to the
[2:04:38] mind of God and says Satan you don't
[2:04:41] have a right to put a lean on them I
[2:04:43] claimed them before you ever got to
[2:04:46] him that book of redemption that Adam
[2:04:49] had that title deed that Adam had in the
[2:04:50] garden he you would have came forth as
[2:04:53] spoken word children your name was
[2:04:55] written in that Lamb's Book of Life amen
[2:04:58] but you see when sat and doubt ien but
[2:05:01] when when Eve for doubted amen she
[2:05:03] forfeited her right to the Tree of Life
[2:05:06] Adam believed it forfeited his right to
[2:05:09] the Tree of Life forfeited Fellowship
[2:05:12] forfeited eternal life uh but I'll tell
[2:05:14] you friends uh amen amen that book The
[2:05:18] Devil Couldn't get his hands upon it
[2:05:20] those greasy hands of the devil had no
[2:05:23] right upon that Lamb's Book of Life uh
[2:05:26] it went back into the hands of the
[2:05:28] original owner which was God himself uh
[2:05:31] but in this day in the restoration of
[2:05:35] all things uh where he's going to bring
[2:05:37] forth every name that is written in that
[2:05:39] Lamb's Book of Life everything the devil
[2:05:41] tried to put on your life was nothing
[2:05:43] but a hoax it's nothing but a lie it's
[2:05:46] nothing but a bluff you were already in
[2:05:51] the Mind Of God eternally sealed until
[2:05:55] the day of redemption I tell you Friends
[2:05:58] when the lamb took the book it was from
[2:06:00] the hand of the original owner the
[2:06:03] father but when Jesus stepped in the
[2:06:06] scene and said I am the kinsman redeemer
[2:06:09] I am worthy to take the book and to
[2:06:11] loose the seals thereof what he did he
[2:06:13] do it's Redemption claims now we have
[2:06:18] the book that's right and we've got a
[2:06:22] right to go to that old squatter the
[2:06:24] devil and say give me back my
[2:06:27] joy give me back my peace give me back
[2:06:31] my family give me back my sons and

[2:07:00] prevailed to give us this book and now
[2:07:03] he is thirsty for a fresh drink of
[2:07:06] Pentecostal water and the prophet of God
[2:07:08] said who will take your sword and cut

[2:10:00] gross Darkness where the prophet of God
[2:10:03] says in Shalom enough about talking

[2:10:19] the connection between you the bride of
[2:10:21] Christ and the opening of the word and
[2:10:22] saying that's your vision now don't get
[2:10:24] sidetracked on these other things that's
[2:10:26] your vision gross Darkness apostasy
[2:10:30] Church Creed and dogmas and traditions

[2:10:51] cloud like a man hand watch it a sign of
[2:10:56] it's a sign that the rain is falling the
[2:10:59] anointing is falling Christ himself has
[2:11:04] descended I tell you the devil don't
[2:11:07] have enough can you say it with me now
[2:11:09] the devil don't have
[2:11:11] enough Hallelujah if you've been in this
[2:11:14] Christian walk long enough now you you
[2:11:16] you can testify you've been through
[2:11:19] enough battles now but the devil don't
[2:11:20] have it enough Hallelujah we if it
[2:11:24] wasn't for election if it wasn't for his
[2:11:25] elective love we would have been swept
[2:11:28] away but but but it's his love that
[2:11:31] holds us it's his keeping love that
[2:11:34] secures
[2:11:38] us I hope I'm I'm making sense if you
[2:11:41] were born in any other age maybe you
[2:11:43] could have been the devil could have had
[2:11:44] you but not in this age because you're
[2:11:47] predestinated to this glorious
[2:11:50] stand and no one can take your
[2:11:55] place you've been
[2:11:57] restored for such a time as
[2:12:00] this in the times and seasons of the

[2:34:34] and to than how we love love just to
[2:34:37] come in his presence
[2:34:40] and just to imagine that even more so
[2:34:44] God loves to come Among Us and touch and
[2:34:54] just to
[2:34:57] revive give the heart's
[2:35:00] desires amen and it had
[2:35:06] just uh came to me as we just
[2:35:10] singing while his presence is
[2:35:13] here
[2:35:15] and I've just uh just praying for all of
[2:35:19] our young people that Lord just touch
[2:35:22] them give them the
[2:35:26] reality but
[2:35:28] uh Little David uh uh sister Mindy
[2:35:33] taking David for an eye exam
[2:35:37] and doctor says that his eyes have
[2:35:40] gotten worse really really
[2:35:44] bad and what a normal man may be able to
[2:35:48] see a hundred yards away
[2:35:50] he can only see five fet in front of
[2:35:54] him and
[2:35:56] uh you know I believe in a
[2:36:01] healing amen I've seen God touch the
[2:36:04] blind eyes Hallelujah to God and
[2:36:09] uh what the professionals may not be
[2:36:13] able to
[2:36:14] do we serve a mighty God that's a chief
[2:36:18] physician he's the creator of those eyes
[2:36:22] I wonder if maybe Josiah and Mindy could
[2:36:24] come
[2:36:26] and and brother Jonathan and maybe the
[2:36:30] ministers together around David could
[2:36:33] you come
[2:36:34] [Music]
[2:36:36] buddy God touched these
[2:36:41] eyes that he
[2:36:44] could see
[2:36:47] and be a living
[2:36:50] [Music]
[2:36:52] testimony of God's healing
[2:36:55] power
[2:36:57] amen I know our older brother Wendell
[2:37:01] had bad eyes one time and he had
[2:37:05] actually went up to be prayed
[2:37:07] for and
[2:37:10] the minister didn't even get to him to
[2:37:13] pray for him about that age or maybe a
[2:37:15] little older and he went sat back down
[2:37:19] thought well I didn't get prayed for
[2:37:22] they said Lord if you could heal all
[2:37:23] these other people you could heal me and
[2:37:26] he opened his eyes and his eyes just
[2:37:28] started burning and they were
[2:37:29] blurry he took off his glasses he could
[2:37:32] see
[2:37:34] perfect and he's never had to wear
[2:37:36] glasses again now as he's gotten older
[2:37:38] he wears reading
[2:37:39] glasses but God just touched his eyes
[2:37:43] and even my first wife
[2:37:45] Rebecca she had to have real thick
[2:37:48] glasses and
[2:37:50] but when she got saved at 10 years
[2:37:53] old just uh Faith got a hold in her
[2:37:57] heart she thought Lord you could heal me
[2:38:00] of my eyes and I don't know if she was
[2:38:03] prayed for or not but God touched her
[2:38:06] eyes and till the day she died she never
[2:38:09] had to have
[2:38:10] glasses and I just believe this God will
[2:38:14] answer our prayer for
[2:38:17] David if you could just the minister
[2:38:20] come and we can our church pray Amen
[2:38:23] brother Jonathan
