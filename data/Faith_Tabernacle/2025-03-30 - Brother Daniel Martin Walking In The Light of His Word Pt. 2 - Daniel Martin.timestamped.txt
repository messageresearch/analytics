[26:46] Amen. Let's bow our heads as we look to
[26:49] the Lord in behalf of these
[26:52] deeds. Father, as we come before you, I
[26:55] think about that song that we just
[26:57] finished singing. Certainly, you made a
[26:59] way and we were born with our backs up
[27:02] against the wall, as we would say, and
[27:04] had no hope in this life. But Father,
[27:06] we're so thankful that you put that
[27:08] representation down in our soul. Even
[27:10] that seed of life, that germ of life
[27:11] that came from you was dormant for many
[27:13] years. But when the light of this end
[27:15] time gospel, the present day truth, when
[27:18] it struck that seed, it came to life.
[27:20] And how thankful we are. How thankful we
[27:23] are to have that life that was in us and
[27:25] now it's come to life. And we are not
[27:28] only recipients, Lord, of eternal life,
[27:30] but we've been granted the ability to by
[27:33] your grace to live that life, a life
[27:35] worthy of the gospel. Thank you for this
[27:37] end time message. It means so much to
[27:39] us, Lord. We just thank you with all of
[27:42] our heart how graceful you've been. We
[27:44] think about these requests. We're going
[27:46] to uh bring them before you.
[27:48] Thanksgiving. Pray God that you'll touch
[27:50] Janice. We know she's going for eye
[27:52] surgery. And I know that the Lord we we
[27:54] know that the prophet taught us that all
[27:56] healing comes from God. The Bible
[27:58] teached that. But we know also that God
[28:00] heals through medicine. He heals through
[28:02] doctors. Even heals through music. But
[28:04] all healing comes from you. So whatever
[28:06] avenue, Lord, that you would choose. So
[28:09] let your children be made well. God, we
[28:11] know that all healing comes from you.
[28:12] And we just pray that it will be
[28:14] successful be with her, Sister Hope.
[28:16] those that were sick that been requested
[28:18] their names and have been mentioned and
[28:21] the the young brother that passed home
[28:24] and caused a car accident. I know that's
[28:25] so sad, Lord, to lose one that young and
[28:28] unexpected situations such as that. But
[28:31] Lord, you promise to be an everpresent
[28:32] help in a time of trouble. We pray for
[28:35] the services out there. Brother Sean,
[28:37] give them traveling mercies and when
[28:39] they return back home, Sister Ray, bless
[28:41] her down there at the services and so
[28:43] forth. Lord, each of these requests,
[28:45] you're so good to us, Lord. We we know
[28:47] that when we pray, you said, "Ask,
[28:50] believe, and don't doubt. You can have
[28:51] soever whatsoever things you desire when
[28:53] you pray." And he said, "Ask abundantly
[28:55] that your uh prayers may be answered
[28:58] that your faith would be um we would
[29:00] have faith." The Lord, we think about
[29:02] even he asked the question, "Will I find
[29:03] faith when I return?" And the prophet
[29:05] god said, "Faith has been restored by
[29:07] the seventh angel messenger." So, there
[29:08] is faith. There's faith in the building
[29:10] this morning. We believe your word. We
[29:12] don't if we don't believe we shouldn't
[29:14] even pray. But we believe that you'll
[29:16] hear and answer these requests. Bless
[29:18] our speaker this morning. Give him words
[29:20] to speak whatever laid on his heart to
[29:23] say Lord. May it just come Lord with the
[29:25] anointing of the Holy Spirit that may
[29:27] our hearts be anointed receive. And may
[29:29] when we leave the bill and say it's been
[29:30] good to be in the house of God. May you
[29:32] grant these things Lord we give you
[29:34] praise. The other requests that I didn't
[29:36] mention, it's already been mentioned.
[29:37] You bring them to pass. We'll give you
[29:39] praise for it in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:43] Your backs were against the wall and it
[29:47] looked as if it was over.
[29:51] You made a
[29:55] way. And we're standing here only
[29:59] because you've made a way. Can we sing
[30:04] it again? Oh,
[30:07] you made a way.
[30:12] When our backs were against the wall and
[30:15] it looked as if it was over,
[30:19] you made a
[30:23] way. And we're standing here only
[30:28] because you made Sister Alice, do you
[30:30] have a song for us, Brother Terry? Oh,
[30:35] you made a way. You can be seated this
[30:39] morning. When our backs were against the
[30:42] wall and it looked as if it was over,
[30:48] you made a
[30:52] way. And we're standing here only
[30:56] because you
[30:58] made
[31:01] way. Amen. Do you believe him to be a
[31:04] way maker this morning? Amen.
[31:12] I'm so glad he made a way. I hate to
[31:15] sing the same song twice in the same
[31:18] year, but I trust that you'll it' be a
[31:21] blessing to you. But brother, they asked
[31:24] brother a question. I think it's
[31:25] question answer 64 is what is the
[31:28] mystery of the translation of the bride?
[31:30] He said just a change. Just a change.
[31:34] Well, it's not exactly quite that
[31:36] simple, but yet it is that simple. These
[31:38] atoms will be changed in a moment, a
[31:40] twinkle of an eye, just a change. That
[31:42] is a mystery of the translation of the
[31:44] bride, key of
[31:46] C. In the Bible, we are told of an angel
[31:50] to behold. Yeah, it's a prophet sent to
[31:53] change the course of
[31:55] man. Oh, in a lowly place of birth came
[31:59] a light down to the earth, for it was
[32:02] proof of mighty gift. are blessed our
[32:04] land.
[32:07] Oh now the time of change is here and
[32:11] the sign he said was clear that when a
[32:13] stake was driven down into the ground
[32:17] for he was told to travel west that a
[32:21] people might be blessed it was a season
[32:24] that the thunders were to sound. I'm
[32:27] telling you, there'll be a change after
[32:30] a
[32:32] while. Or when I wear a frown, we'll
[32:35] wear a
[32:36] smile. Oh, we may suffer pain or loss.
[32:39] But Jesus died upon the cross that we
[32:43] might have a change after a while. The
[32:47] price of change was high and cost and
[32:49] died at all that total loss when the
[32:52] angel put his feet in land and sea.
[32:56] But the bride was washed in bleach. Put
[32:59] our sins far out of reach. Now the
[33:02] virgin bride's absolutely free. I'm
[33:06] telling you there'll be a change after a
[33:10] while. Now we are wear a smile we'll
[33:14] wear. Oh, we may suffer pain or loss.
[33:18] But Jesus died upon the cross that we
[33:21] might have a change
[33:24] after. The rapture call has dawn gone
[33:27] out and saw the cloud and heard the
[33:29] shout. We're looking for our change just
[33:32] any

[33:37] word inside you is a thing. It'll take
[33:40] us home, my friend. No matter what they
[33:43] say, I'm telling you there'll be a
[33:46] change after a
[33:49] while. We now wear a frown. We'll wear a
[33:52] smile.
[33:54] Oh, we may suffer pain or loss, but
[33:56] Jesus died upon the cross that we might
[34:00] have a change. That we might have a
[34:03] change. That we might have a change.
[34:07] [Music]

[34:18] morning? Amen. Oh,

[34:26] changed. Oh, we shall be

[35:19] your heart. Oh yes, we shall be

[35:36] Oh, in the twinkling of an
[35:41] eye. Amen. Will soon be changed. Amen.
[35:48] [Music]
[35:51] There are people almost everywhere whose
[35:54] hearts are all a flame with the fire
[35:57] that fell at Pentecost which cleansed
[36:00] and made them clean. It is burning now
[36:03] within my heart. Glory to his name. I'm

[36:30] of
[36:31] them. whom they were gathered in the
[36:34] upper room, all praying in his name.
[36:38] They were baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[36:41] Powerful service came. Now what he did
[36:44] for them that day, he'll do for you the
[36:47] same. I'm so glad that I can see I'm one
[36:51] of
[36:52] them. I'm one of
[36:54] them. I'm one of

[37:07] them. Oh, I'm so glad that I can see I'm
[37:11] one of
[37:12] them. Come, my brother, seek this
[37:15] blessing that will cleanse your heart
[37:17] from sin. That will start the joy bells
[37:20] ringing and will keep the soul a flame.
[37:23] It is burning now within my heart. Glory
[37:27] to his name. I'm so glad that I can see
[37:30] I'm one of
[37:32] them. I'm one of
[37:34] them. I'm one of
[37:37] them. I'm so glad that I can see I'm one
[37:41] of
[37:42] them. I'm one of
[37:44] them. I'm one of
[37:47] them. I'm so glad that I can see I'm one
[37:51] of them.
[37:52] [Music]

[38:01] this morning? Amen. I'm so glad that I
[38:03] can say I'm one of them. Amen. Can we

[38:24] presence. There's nothing like the
[38:29] presence. There's nothing like the
[38:32] presence of the
[38:37] Lord. There's nothing like the
[38:41] presence. There's nothing like the
[38:46] presence. There's nothing like the
[38:50] presence of the
[38:53] Lord. Oh, I'm
[38:56] [Applause]
[38:57] healed in his
[39:01] presence. Oh, I'm saved.
[39:07] In his
[39:10] presence, I'm

[39:20] changed
[39:22] forever in his presence. Can we stand
[39:26] tonight this morning? There's healing in
[39:29] the
[39:30] presence. There's healing in the
[39:33] presence.
[39:35] There's healing in the presence of the
[39:40] [Music]

[40:04] presence. Oh, I'm
[40:09] saved in his
[40:12] presence. Oh, I'm
[40:15] forgive
[40:17] and I am not the same. Oh, I'm
[40:23] changed
[40:25] forever in his presence.
[40:28] Oh, I'm
[40:32] healed in his
[40:35] presence. Oh, I'm
[40:40] safe in his
[40:43] presence. Oh, I'm
[40:48] forgiven. I'm
[40:50] not the
[40:51] same. I'm
[40:53] changed
[40:55] forever in his
[41:00] presence. Amen. There's nothing like the
[41:03] presence of the Lord this morning. Amen.
[41:06] Can we just sing that song?
[41:09] Create in me a
[41:13] clean heart.
[41:15] [Music]
[41:18] Oh
[41:20] [Music]

[41:27] spirit within me. Create in
[41:33] me. Oh yes.

[41:38] me a
[41:40] clean heart.

[41:54] spirit within
[41:57] me. Cast me not away. Oh yes. Cast me
[42:05] not
[42:06] away from thy
[42:11] presence, oh Lord.
[42:16] and take not thy holy spirit from
[42:26] me.
[42:29] Restore unto me, oh the joy of thy
[42:40] salvation and renew a right
[42:44] spirit within me. Sing it
[42:49] again.
[42:51] Oh, just cast me
[42:55] not
[42:56] away from thy
[43:00] presence. Oh Lord, is that your desire
[43:03] this morning?
[43:06] Take not thy holy spirit from
[43:15] me. Oh
[43:18] restore unto
[43:21] me. for the joys of thy
[43:29] salvation and renew a right
[43:33] spirit within
[43:37] me as they would just play softly. Can
[43:40] we just bow our hearts this morning?
[43:42] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we feel your
[43:45] presence here this morning, Lord.
[43:48] Lord, we ask, Lord, that you would just
[43:50] walk down these aisles, Father. Lord, I
[43:54] pray that you would just speak to every
[43:56] heart this morning, Lord. Lord, I pray,
[43:59] Lord, that you would just draw us closer
[44:01] to you, Lord. Lord, I pray that you
[44:04] would heal every broken heart this
[44:06] morning. Father, Lord, as we come this
[44:08] morning, Lord, to minister your word,
[44:10] Father, Lord, I pray that you would just
[44:13] speak through me, Lord, this morning.
[44:15] And Lord, I pray that you would just
[44:17] speak to the hearts of your people,
[44:19] Father, is our prayer. Lord, we just
[44:21] count it an honor to be here this
[44:23] morning, Lord. And Father, Lord, we just
[44:26] love you. We thank you, Lord, for all
[44:28] that you've done. We ask it all in your
[44:31] lovely name, Jesus Christ, we
[44:34] pray. Amen. Amen. If you would just have
[44:37] your Bibles this morning, we go right
[44:39] into the word. Amen. The musicians can
[44:42] be dismissed.
[44:44] [Music]
[44:46] Amen. Man, did you enjoy my wife's
[44:49] playing this morning?
[44:51] Amen. She said she was real nervous this
[44:55] morning.
[44:56] Amen. Amen. But if we could turn to uh
[45:00] John chapter
[45:11] 8. Amen. It's u I just count it an honor
[45:14] to be here this morning and to uh
[45:18] minister the word to you. I I pray that
[45:20] you can find it a blessing this morning.
[45:23] Amen.
[45:24] If we could turn to uh John chapter 8
[45:27] and I'd like to read to also in
[45:29] Ephesians but John chapter 8 and verse
[45:33] 12 says then spake Jesus again
[45:38] uh unto them saying I am the light of
[45:42] the world and he that followeth me shall
[45:46] not walk in darkness but shall have the
[45:49] light of life. Amen. And if we could
[45:52] also turn to
[45:53] Ephesians chapter
[45:57] 5. Amen. We are all familiar with these
[46:00] verses. But Ephesians chapter
[46:03] 5 and verse 8 is for it says, "For ye
[46:08] were sometimes darkness, but now are ye
[46:12] light in the Lord. Walk as children of
[46:17] light." Amen. For ye were sometimes
[46:20] darkness, but now are ye light in the
[46:23] world in the Lord. Walk as children of
[46:27] light. Amen. I ask the Lord to have the
[46:30] blessings over the word. Amen. You can
[46:32] be seated.
[46:34] Amen. If I were to uh give a title this
[46:38] morning, I would like to uh title it uh
[46:41] walking in the light of his word uh part
[46:44] two. Amen. And if I had a uh uh would
[46:49] take a maybe another
[46:52] uh um I'd like to continue the thought I
[46:56] had last time we had ministered uh but
[46:58] maybe take it a different direction this
[47:00] morning. Amen. Last time uh we had
[47:03] talked on walking in the his light.
[47:06] Amen. Of his word and how God was moving
[47:09] down through the ages. Amen. and is now
[47:13] shining his light right here in these
[47:16] last days. Amen. Making his word
[47:19] manifest and a little bright this
[47:21] morning.
[47:23] Amen. And as long as we're walking under
[47:26] his light, then we don't have to fear.
[47:29] Amen. We as long as we're walking under
[47:32] the light of his word, we don't have to
[47:34] wander aimlessly and and wander around.
[47:37] Amen. But his light has shone in this
[47:40] day. Amen. But we can lift our heads up
[47:42] high knowing that we're not walking
[47:45] under Luther's light. Amen. We can lift
[47:47] our heads up high knowing we're not
[47:49] walking under Wesley's light. Amen.
[47:52] Amen. But we're walking under the light
[47:55] of the message for this day and age.
[47:58] Amen. And if I would maybe take a
[48:01] thought this morning, maybe a subtitle,
[48:04] I'd like to maybe uh title, we are a
[48:07] reflection of his light. Amen. Now, we
[48:10] are a reflection of his light. And
[48:13] Matthew
[48:14] 5:13 says, "Ye are the salt of the
[48:18] earth. But if the salt has lost his
[48:21] savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"
[48:25] Amen. It is thenforth good for nothing
[48:29] but to be cast out and be trodden
[48:31] underfoot of men. Amen. So if the So if
[48:34] the salt has lost its purpose, Amen. If
[48:39] it's as lost as purpose, then it's good
[48:41] for nothing. Amen. And with salt, that's
[48:44] good for nothing. We throw it out. And
[48:47] and it says that it should be trotten
[48:48] under men's foot. But verse 14 says, "Ye
[48:52] are the light of the world, a city that
[48:54] is set on a hill that cannot be hid."
[48:58] Amen. Neither do men light a candle and
[49:00] put it under a bushel, but on a
[49:03] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[49:06] all that are in the house. Amen. So, if
[49:09] you're going to light up the house, what
[49:11] good would it be to to hide it under a
[49:13] bush? Or what what good would it be to
[49:15] to try and cover the light if you're
[49:17] trying to use it to light up the house?
[49:19] Amen. But you would place that light.
[49:21] You would place that candle where it can
[49:23] be seen. You would place it in the
[49:25] forefront so it could shine forth its
[49:27] light to all those that are in the
[49:29] house. Amen. In verse 16 says, "Let your
[49:32] light so shine before men that they may
[49:36] see your good works and glorify your
[49:39] father which is in heaven." Amen. So
[49:42] here Jesus is saying that we are the
[49:44] light of the world. Amen. We shine as
[49:47] lights in this world of darkness. Amen.
[49:52] Amen. Excuse me. Amen. and that we must
[49:55] shine our light among men that they may
[49:58] see our good works. Amen. And whose
[50:01] light are we reflecting?
[50:03] Amen. Whose light are we reflecting this
[50:06] morning? We're supposed to reflect
[50:08] Christ. Amen. In our opening scripture
[50:10] there, we read in John where Jesus says,
[50:13] "I am the light of the world, and he
[50:15] that followeth me shall not walk in
[50:17] darkness, but shall have the light of
[50:20] life." And we read where Jesus says that
[50:22] ye are the light of the world. Amen.
[50:26] Jesus here saying, "But I am the light
[50:27] of the world." And then later he says,
[50:29] "But you are the light of the world."
[50:31] Amen. So we are reflecting his light.
[50:34] We're supposed to be a reflection of the
[50:36] light that he is shining in this day.
[50:39] Amen. So, so we're not just reflecting
[50:41] any old light. Amen. This morning, but
[50:44] we are reflecting Jesus Christ to all
[50:47] those that are around us. Amen. Now, we
[50:51] are in this age, as brother Brandham
[50:53] says, an
[50:54] advertisement. Do you believe that this
[50:56] morning? Amen. We are an advertisement.
[50:59] And Amen. You can't almost go anywhere
[51:02] without seeing somebody advertise
[51:04] something. Amen. They've got signs
[51:06] posted in every street corner
[51:08] advertising every business and and
[51:12] everything. And and you know, they could
[51:15] be advertising food. They could be
[51:16] advertising gas down the road. They be
[51:19] be advertising a hotel or or or someone
[51:22] selling jewelry or clothing or anything
[51:25] that you can think of. They're trying to
[51:28] advertise it. They're trying to catch
[51:30] your attention. Amen. And they're
[51:32] advertising on huge billboards. Amen.
[51:37] Someone that's going to advertise their
[51:38] business isn't going to advertise on a
[51:40] little old sticker. Amen. They're not
[51:42] going to put it on a little sticker and
[51:43] hide it somewhere, but they're going to
[51:45] advertise as big as they can go. Amen.
[51:49] So that you could see so they could
[51:50] reflect her business. And they want you
[51:52] to to buy from them. Amen. And they got
[51:56] to go get the biggest one so so so you
[51:59] don't miss it. Amen. For one reason.
[52:01] Amen. And that is to get you to buy
[52:03] their product. Amen. They're trying to
[52:05] trying to draw your attention so you can
[52:08] buy from them. So you can so you can get
[52:10] from them. Amen. And I can tell you
[52:13] what, food advertisements are the worst.
[52:16] Oh my. You don't even have to be hungry
[52:18] sometimes. And and but you see a great
[52:20] big billboard of of someone's
[52:23] advertising tacos or something for their
[52:25] local Mexican restaurant and and the
[52:27] next thing you know you you've got to
[52:29] have it. Amen. They'll advertise, you
[52:31] know, the best tacos and and and bold
[52:35] letters underneath it. It'll say best
[52:37] tacos on this side of the Mississippi
[52:39] River. Oh my. Then that means only one
[52:42] thing. That means I've got to try these
[52:44] tacos for myself. Amen. and and the next
[52:47] thing you know you you've you've gone
[52:48] into this place and the next thing you
[52:50] know you you've done spent 20 and 40
[52:52] bucks on on something that you probably
[52:54] would have voted the the best 10th place
[52:56] or something like that of tacos on this
[52:59] side. Amen. But they they they're trying
[53:01] to get you to get you your attention.
[53:03] Amen. Amen. And if we would take that,
[53:07] if we would take that on the spiritual
[53:09] side this morning, and the only way that
[53:11] the world will ever see Christ this
[53:13] morning is when they see it in you and
[53:16] me. Oh my. They ain't going to see
[53:18] Christ if we're trying to hide it
[53:20] somewhere. Amen. They ain't going to see
[53:22] Christ if we don't don't uh portray
[53:26] Christ to the world. Amen. The only way
[53:29] they're going to see Christ is through
[53:31] us this morning. Amen. Do you believe
[53:34] that?
[53:35] Amen.
[53:37] Brother Brandham says their conscience
[53:39] is numb to the things of God. Oh my.
[53:43] They can't see God in the sunsets. That
[53:46] uh they can't see God in the birds
[53:49] singing. They can't see God in the
[53:51] leaves. They can't see God in the grass
[53:54] or the flowers or or in the music or the
[53:57] or the message, the preaching of the
[53:59] word like we do after we have found
[54:02] Christ. Amen. We can go out here and we
[54:04] can see God in the trees. We can see God
[54:07] in the sunrise. We can see God in the
[54:09] clouds. On the rainy days, we still see
[54:12] God. Amen. But the world can't see God.
[54:15] Amen. They, brother says, they become
[54:17] numb to the things of God. But if we can
[54:20] ever get to a place that we display
[54:22] Christ, Amen. each one of you, uh, from
[54:25] tonight on, remember, you are God's
[54:28] billboards and you are God's advertising
[54:31] agent. Now the world will look at you to
[54:34] see what Christ is. So we don't want to
[54:36] smear a big lot of stuff out there that
[54:39] testify about things that we are really
[54:42] not. Let's be f uh let let's first be
[54:45] that display Christ. Amen. And then we
[54:50] and when we be that then the world will
[54:53] see Christ in you and me. Oh my. The
[54:57] first thing with any
[54:59] advertisement Amen. The person has to
[55:01] see it for it to work. Amen. The first
[55:04] thing with any advertisement. Amen.
[55:09] Amen. The next thing they have to want
[55:11] it.
[55:13] Amen. They have to be looking for
[55:15] something. Amen. And they have to first
[55:18] have to see it and then we've got to
[55:20] make it so attractive to them. Oh my. If
[55:24] someone is looking looking for for for a
[55:26] plumber, Brother Tim, and they're
[55:29] they're they're they've been searching
[55:30] everywhere, but then Brother Tim will
[55:33] maybe make his advertisement so much
[55:35] more sweeter than everybody else. Amen.
[55:38] That that they're going to call brother
[55:39] Tim to come fix their pipes. Amen. And
[55:42] that's the way it should be in the
[55:43] Christian world. Oh my. There's a lot of
[55:46] people out there saying that they're
[55:47] Christians. There's a lot of people out
[55:48] there testifying that that they have the
[55:51] one, that they have Christ. And if we as
[55:54] believers are not making it sweeter,
[55:57] that we're not standing out above the
[55:59] rest, then what good does it do? Oh my.
[56:02] Amen. The world will say it's old and no
[56:04] good. Amen. Amen. The gospel does have
[56:08] an attractive an attraction. Do you
[56:10] believe that this morning? Amen. This
[56:12] gospel has an attraction. And the world
[56:15] will say it's old. The world will say
[56:16] it's no good. Amen. And that it's lost
[56:19] his touch. But it is to those who are
[56:22] hungering for God. Amen. It only
[56:24] attracts those who are hungering and
[56:27] thirsting. And that's the ones that
[56:29] we're out for. Oh my. We're not just out
[56:32] for anybody and and everybody out there.
[56:34] Amen. I believe that we should we should
[56:36] always project Christ, but we should be
[56:39] after the ones that are hungering for
[56:40] God. Amen. Jesus said, "No man can come
[56:44] to me except my father draws him."
[56:48] Amen. You see someone hungering out
[56:51] there, don't turn them away. There's
[56:53] something in there that's hungering for
[56:55] something. God put that hungering down
[56:57] in them. Amen. No man can come to me
[56:59] except my father draws him. Amen.
[57:02] Brother Brandham says, "But there's so
[57:05] many that the father has drawn and are
[57:08] hungering and thirsting to find God and
[57:10] they don't know where to find him." Oh
[57:13] my. Because those who are supposed to be
[57:16] billboards is so smuted up with the
[57:19] things of the world that they can't see
[57:22] where they've got any more than they've
[57:23] got before they come to him. Amen. See,
[57:26] they haven't been following the light.
[57:29] Amen. They haven't. They're supposed to
[57:30] be billboards. They're supposed to be
[57:32] projecting Christ, but but they're
[57:34] staying under Luther's light. They've
[57:35] stayed under Wesley's light, but this
[57:37] light has moved on to this day. Amen.
[57:40] And as long as we're walking under the
[57:42] light that's meant for this day, we can
[57:44] project Christ. Amen. They live like the
[57:47] world. They talk like the world. They
[57:48] sing the same songs as the world does.
[57:51] And there's no difference. There is no
[57:53] difference to the sinner. Amen. The
[57:55] sinner can go to to to to the church
[57:58] down the road and and he can sit in
[58:01] service and oh my he can look around and
[58:04] everyone's cut their hair and everyone's
[58:06] wearing makeup and earrings and the and
[58:08] the women are wearing pants and then
[58:10] they go out in the world and they're
[58:12] just living any old way. See that man
[58:14] can't see a difference. Oh my. They go
[58:18] to the worldly places. They attend the
[58:20] worldly entertainments and they're only
[58:22] producing a mirage to the people. Do you
[58:26] believe that? They're producing a mirage
[58:29] to the people. My now we find out until
[58:32] the people begin to want God. Until the
[58:35] people begin to thirst, Jesus says,
[58:37] "Blessed are they that do hunger and
[58:38] thirst for righteousness, for they shall
[58:41] be filled, not might, but they shall be
[58:44] filled." Amen. They have to hunger and
[58:47] thirst. Amen. Brother Bram says we're
[58:50] Christ billboards and Christ is our
[58:53] sponsor. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[58:56] Christ is our sponsor. Amen. Uh me and
[58:59] brother Junior there has we have a uh uh
[59:02] you know everyone knows that that deer
[59:03] recovery business and and and the Lord
[59:06] has blessed us with a with a couple
[59:08] sponsors and and and one uh one uh of
[59:13] our sponsors uh we um is a car wrapping
[59:16] company and and they wrapped our Jeep
[59:19] for for no cost in exchange to put their
[59:22] logo. We have to advertise their
[59:25] business on our Jeep. Amen. Amen. We
[59:28] have to advertise their business on our
[59:30] on our on our uh uh website, Facebook
[59:33] and everything. We have to do that for
[59:35] them in exchange. Amen. And here we have
[59:39] a sponsorship with Christ. Brother
[59:41] Brandham says for this sponsorship is by
[59:44] Christ and he's given us our life to
[59:47] sponsor him. Amen. Now, what kind of
[59:50] life of a person would you be if you
[59:52] sponsored somebody? Oh my. What kind of
[59:55] person would you be if someone asked you
[59:56] to come sponsor sponsor them? Amen. If
[59:59] they do good work and they took care of
[1:00:01] you, you would want to do everything you
[1:00:04] could to sponsor that company in the
[1:00:06] right way. Amen. And what kind of a
[1:00:09] person ought we to be if we are
[1:00:12] sponsored by Christ? Amen. He gives us
[1:00:14] salvation. He gives us our healing. He
[1:00:17] gives us our health and strength. He
[1:00:19] gives us our food. He gives us our
[1:00:21] homes. He gives us a place to stay.
[1:00:23] Amen. We have been sponsored by Jesus
[1:00:26] Christ and given the Holy Ghost to be an
[1:00:29] example to the people in the world. Oh
[1:00:32] my. We should be in such a condition,
[1:00:34] Amen, that the world would that that
[1:00:36] would cause all the world to want to be
[1:00:39] like us. Oh my. Brother Brandham says
[1:00:44] because men go down the street and say
[1:00:46] there's a man I I might disagree with
[1:00:48] him in his religious doctrine. But I
[1:00:50] tell you one thing that is a genuine
[1:00:52] Christian. O to be a woman going down
[1:00:54] the street and and say she may look
[1:00:57] old-fashioned. She she may not be like
[1:00:59] the rest of any of the women you see.
[1:01:01] But there's one Christian in this town.
[1:01:04] If there is one Christian in town, it's
[1:01:07] this one right here. And there she goes.
[1:01:09] because we are sponsored by Jesus
[1:01:12] Christ. Amen. Then we ought ought to
[1:01:14] everything we we can live uh can do to
[1:01:18] live in such a way people can see Christ
[1:01:22] through us. Oh my Amen. He's the one who
[1:01:26] give us our life. He's the one who gives
[1:01:28] us our strength. Amen. And all that we
[1:01:31] have have comes from Christ. Amen.
[1:01:35] Now, as a reflection of his light, we
[1:01:37] must preach a gospel that's appealing to
[1:01:39] the hungry.
[1:01:43] Amen. We're not to preach Wesley's
[1:01:45] doctrine. We're not to preach Luther's
[1:01:47] message. Oh, it was a great message for
[1:01:49] that day. Amen. I believe that God
[1:01:52] called them to them great men to preach
[1:01:54] that message for that day without them.
[1:01:56] Amen. Uh but but it was great for their
[1:02:00] day. Amen. But Moses message wouldn't
[1:02:03] have worked for Noah's day. Amen. Noah's
[1:02:05] message wouldn't have worked for Paul's
[1:02:07] day. Amen. We all have a purpose. Amen.
[1:02:10] Brother Brandham says, "Now, if we
[1:02:11] preach a social gospel that says, well,
[1:02:14] you ought to come join our denomination.
[1:02:16] We got 4,000 more last year in our
[1:02:19] organization." That's not it. Well, if
[1:02:21] you come to my church or become a member
[1:02:23] of my church, we'll see that you're
[1:02:25] taken care of when you get old and you
[1:02:28] be a faithful member. It's like an
[1:02:30] insurance policy. You've been taken care
[1:02:32] of when you get old. We'll see to that.
[1:02:35] That still isn't the attractiveness. Oh
[1:02:39] my. Amen. I camp uh Camp Christy last
[1:02:42] year where we live. Amen. The church of
[1:02:44] God who owns the place. They had a youth
[1:02:46] camp there. And and at the end of uh uh
[1:02:49] the camp, I I went up to the state
[1:02:52] minister and and I asked him, I said,
[1:02:54] "Well, you know, Mr. Bob," I said, "How
[1:02:56] did the camp go?" and and and you know
[1:02:58] and he says, "Well, you know, it went
[1:03:00] good. It went really good. We we had 15
[1:03:02] young people come to come come up to the
[1:03:05] front there." And and I said, "Well, you
[1:03:08] know, that's good." And and then I had
[1:03:10] an older gentleman come up and and tell
[1:03:12] me that that his grandson went to the
[1:03:14] front uh a couple years ago and gave his
[1:03:17] uh went up to the front to and gave his
[1:03:20] heart to the Lord two years ago. But you
[1:03:22] see his grandson today is still living
[1:03:26] the life that he once was. Amen. No
[1:03:29] difference then than before he went.
[1:03:31] Amen. And and
[1:03:32] here no doubt there was a hunger and a
[1:03:35] thirsting in there somewhere. But that
[1:03:38] still and stagnant water isn't going to
[1:03:40] quench that thirst that's inside of a
[1:03:42] person.
[1:03:43] Amen. They come up to the front and they
[1:03:46] say, "Oh yes, we had 15 more people than
[1:03:48] we did last year. Oh my praise God."
[1:03:51] then go out and smoke a cigarette and
[1:03:52] then go out and cut their hair and then
[1:03:55] go out and live any old life that's
[1:03:57] stale stagnant water. Amen. But we need
[1:03:59] to live such a way that we are producing
[1:04:03] life to the people. Oh
[1:04:06] my. Amen. What we need today is a fresh
[1:04:09] pouring of the Holy Ghost that will
[1:04:11] quench the thirst of a dying soul. Amen.
[1:04:14] It will turn a sinner into a saint. It
[1:04:16] would deliver from pornography. It will
[1:04:18] deliver from worldly desires. Amen. It
[1:04:21] will deliver from fear. Amen. It will it
[1:04:24] will keep you when you're dying. It will
[1:04:26] keep your marriage. It will save your
[1:04:28] lost loved ones. Amen. That's what we
[1:04:30] need today. Oh my. We must preach that
[1:04:34] gospel that's been given to us in this
[1:04:36] day and age. Amen. Another message
[1:04:38] another age won't do. Amen. This is the
[1:04:41] only message that will appeal to the
[1:04:43] hungry souls. Amen.
[1:04:46] A message that raises Christ up in a
[1:04:49] living atmosphere right here around us
[1:04:51] now. Blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:04:53] thirst for righteousness, for they shall
[1:04:55] be filled. Filled with what? The Holy
[1:04:58] Spirit. The Bible said Steven was a man
[1:05:01] full of power, full of faith, full of
[1:05:03] love, full of the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:05:06] what made him what he was is because he
[1:05:09] was filled with the Holy Ghost. Then he
[1:05:11] says, a real advertising board for
[1:05:15] Christ.
[1:05:16] Oh my. How many people do we have filled
[1:05:18] with the Holy Ghost this morning? See,
[1:05:21] you are a real advertising billboard for
[1:05:25] Christ. Amen. Brother Burnham says when
[1:05:29] he stood there talking of Steven that
[1:05:32] morning at the Sanhedrin court and they
[1:05:34] accused him, he stood alone, maybe two
[1:05:38] or three thousand or 5,000 Jews standing
[1:05:41] there with a pointing finger. And the
[1:05:43] Bible says when he walked out there that
[1:05:45] his face looked like an angel. It didn't
[1:05:48] mean his face was shining. An angel
[1:05:49] would be a messenger that would that
[1:05:51] know what he was talking about. Amen.
[1:05:54] Steven walked out there not afraid of
[1:05:56] death. He wasn't afraid of nothing
[1:05:58] because he knowed what he was talking
[1:06:01] about. Oh my. Steven walked out there
[1:06:04] before that Sanhedrin core like a sheep
[1:06:06] among a pack of wolves wasounding for
[1:06:08] his blood. and they accused him and
[1:06:11] pointed an accusing finger at him. What
[1:06:13] did he do? Went ahead and brought down
[1:06:16] all the history of Abraham and Abraham
[1:06:18] and and how through him would bring the
[1:06:21] Gentiles. Amen. Amen. So, he's preaching
[1:06:23] to the Jews here and he's he's bringing
[1:06:26] the history of Abraham and and how God
[1:06:29] through him would bring the in the
[1:06:30] Gentiles. And when he got down to a
[1:06:33] certain place, he looked at him full of
[1:06:35] the Holy Ghost. And he said, "You stiff
[1:06:38] necked, uncircumcised in your heart and
[1:06:41] ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost
[1:06:44] like your fathers did. And so do you.
[1:06:46] You see, he was God's advertisement
[1:06:49] board." Oh my. So what did they do? They
[1:06:52] throwed him out of the city and beat him
[1:06:54] to death with stones. And when he was
[1:06:57] dying, he raised his head to heaven and
[1:07:00] asked forgiveness for those who were
[1:07:02] stoning him. The same as Jesus did at
[1:07:05] the cross. And then God seen his little
[1:07:08] advertisement board being taken down.
[1:07:11] Steven looked up to heaven and said,
[1:07:13] "Behold, I see heavens open." And Jesus
[1:07:16] standing at the right hand of God. And
[1:07:19] he fell asleep in the arms of God. He
[1:07:22] was an advertisement born for a hungry
[1:07:26] souls. Amen. A reflection of the true
[1:07:30] light. Stephen was a reflection of
[1:07:34] Christ. Amen. You may say, "Well, there
[1:07:37] was
[1:07:38] 5,000. How many of them got saved?"
[1:07:41] There was one. He had never accepted it
[1:07:45] right then. But years later, there was
[1:07:48] one held the coast. There was one that
[1:07:50] held the coat of Steven. Saul, that
[1:07:53] young Pharisees standing there gave
[1:07:56] witness to his
[1:07:58] death. Saul, who later became Paul,
[1:08:02] stood there as they stoned Steven. Oh
[1:08:06] my. But when he saw that advertisement
[1:08:10] of the power of the resurrected Christ
[1:08:13] in that little old fell, it never got
[1:08:16] away from him. Oh my. Out of all the
[1:08:18] 5,000 Jews that were standing there,
[1:08:21] only one soul was hungry. Oh my.
[1:08:26] And the same man, Paul, that one
[1:08:29] standing there that morning when Steven
[1:08:30] was stoned, led 10 thousands of souls to
[1:08:34] Christ because one man was willing to
[1:08:37] give his life to be an advertisement
[1:08:39] board for Jesus Christ. Oh my. Is that
[1:08:43] your desire this morning? Lord, I want
[1:08:46] to be an advertisement board for you.
[1:08:48] Lord, I want to do everything I can to
[1:08:51] portray Christ to the hungry world. Oh
[1:08:54] my, what about us today? We don't have a
[1:08:57] big audience. Amen. We don't we don't
[1:08:59] have uh to preach to to uh to 10,000
[1:09:03] people. We don't we don't have to preach
[1:09:05] to hundreds of people. We don't have to
[1:09:07] preach to to to to every uh uh to to to
[1:09:12] to the people of thousands of people.
[1:09:15] Amen. But we have to preach and still
[1:09:20] reflect Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. We
[1:09:24] just have to create the right
[1:09:25] atmosphere.
[1:09:28] We have to create the right atmosphere
[1:09:31] around us. Amen. and show the people
[1:09:35] that he is still the same yesterday,
[1:09:38] today, and forever. Amen. Brother
[1:09:40] Brandham says the only way we see Christ
[1:09:43] is when he reflects in each other. I see
[1:09:46] Christ in you. I see I see him in me.
[1:09:50] That's how we watch Christ. I come to
[1:09:53] the meeting, I start preaching, I watch
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:55] people. You can see whether they're
[1:09:58] interested or not. Just a few minutes.
[1:10:00] You look over your audience.
[1:10:02] You look over your audience, you can
[1:10:04] tell whether you're boring them or
[1:10:06] whether you're not. See, and the first
[1:10:08] thing you know, you see them sitting
[1:10:10] there hanging on to every word under
[1:10:13] expectation. See, I'm seeing Christ
[1:10:16] reflected in that person because he's
[1:10:18] hungering and thirsting for God. And
[1:10:20] then me preaching the gospel and sees
[1:10:22] the Christ reflecting in me. I see
[1:10:25] Christ reflecting in him. That means
[1:10:28] Christ is in our midst then. Amen.
[1:10:32] Christ is in our midst hungering and
[1:10:35] thirsting. I watch the audience how they
[1:10:37] take it. Say something another. Watch
[1:10:39] how what it affects it. Uh watch what
[1:10:44] effect it takes on them. Watch their
[1:10:46] face light up full of joy. They're ready
[1:10:49] right then to receive something. That's
[1:10:52] Christ. I see Christ reflecting in that
[1:10:54] person because the simple gospel of
[1:10:57] Christ is taking a hold in their heart
[1:11:00] because they're hungering and
[1:11:03] thirsting. Oh my. When you sit there and
[1:11:06] you pull on the word, when you sit there
[1:11:08] and you Amen. Oh, there's just a
[1:11:10] hungering and a thirst and calling out
[1:11:12] for more. And I see Christ in that. And
[1:11:15] then we know that Christ is
[1:11:18] here. Oh
[1:11:20] my. We're not just producing some
[1:11:22] theology. We're not producing some
[1:11:25] manmade creed. We're not produ We're not
[1:11:28] pointing people to a god of history, but
[1:11:31] Christ that can mend the brokenhearted.
[1:11:33] A Christ that can heal every sick person
[1:11:36] this morning. A Christ that is going to
[1:11:39] take us in a rapture one of these days.
[1:11:42] Amen. The gospel would be none of unless
[1:11:45] somebody was there to receive it.
[1:11:49] There'll be many who won't take it, but
[1:11:51] the ones that will take it, it'll
[1:11:53] reflect in them. Amen. There's maybe
[1:11:56] 5,000 that morning at the execution of
[1:11:58] Stephen. But there was one it reflected
[1:12:01] on. Amen. How did Steven do it? He never
[1:12:04] performed any miracles. He never called
[1:12:07] fire down from heaven. Amen. He never
[1:12:10] parted the red sheep. He just presented
[1:12:13] his life in such a way that they seen
[1:12:15] that it was the power of Christ in him.
[1:12:19] Oh my. You may never see a vision this
[1:12:22] morning. You may never put your hands on
[1:12:24] the sick person and feel that charge of
[1:12:26] the almighty God make a skeleton of a
[1:12:29] man turn back to life again. You may
[1:12:31] never speak in tongues. You You may
[1:12:33] never physically stand before thousands
[1:12:35] of people and preach the gospel. Amen.
[1:12:38] But you can still be a reflection of
[1:12:42] Jesus Christ. Amen. Manifest Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ by a life that's been so pure and
[1:12:47] unadulterated from the world. Amen. Not
[1:12:50] schmuted up and with dirty things around
[1:12:52] your life, but a pure thing that'll
[1:12:54] cause the hungry heart to hunger and
[1:12:57] thirst to be like him. Oh
[1:13:01] my. You are the salt of the earth. If
[1:13:04] the salt has lost its savior, it becomes
[1:13:07] no good. And when it becomes no good, we
[1:13:10] throw it out. Amen. We have to stay
[1:13:13] salty. Oh my. Let your light shine
[1:13:16] before men that they may see your good
[1:13:19] works. Amen. You can't just just say, "I
[1:13:22] lived a perfect life for two weeks now.
[1:13:24] You ought to be an everyday Christian,
[1:13:28] an every hour Christian, every year
[1:13:32] Christian. Let your light so shine. Oh
[1:13:36] my. Amen.
[1:13:39] Lord,
[1:13:42] I love that. You ought to be an everyday
[1:13:44] Christian, an every hour Christian, an
[1:13:48] every year and every minute and every
[1:13:51] second Christian cuz we don't know who's
[1:13:54] watching.
[1:13:57] Amen. It may be your friend. It may be
[1:14:01] your wife sitting next to you. It may be
[1:14:02] your husband. It may be your children.
[1:14:04] It may be your best friend. It may be
[1:14:06] your cousin. It may It may be your
[1:14:08] brother. It may be your sister. Whoever
[1:14:10] it might
[1:14:11] be. We have to live an everyday
[1:14:15] Christian. Amen. If you're outside and
[1:14:18] you're freezing, you would want
[1:14:20] something to keep you warm. Amen. Is
[1:14:22] that not true? Amen. You would want to
[1:14:25] to maybe build a fire if you didn't have
[1:14:27] no blankets or a coat and you was
[1:14:28] outside cold and you had things to make
[1:14:30] a fire. You would do everything you can
[1:14:32] to stay warm cuz you don't want to
[1:14:34] freeze to death. Amen. So, so, so, so
[1:14:37] you build a fire. Amen. But you wouldn't
[1:14:39] go get a picture of a fire. You wouldn't
[1:14:42] want to go get a picture of a fire
[1:14:43] because a painted fire can't keep you
[1:14:45] warm. Amen. But you need something
[1:14:48] that's real. Amen. And the world is
[1:14:50] producing a painted fire to the people
[1:14:52] out there. Them churches out there are
[1:14:55] producing a painted fire to the young
[1:14:57] people. Amen. But what they need is
[1:14:59] something real this morning. They don't
[1:15:02] need a painted fire. They need something
[1:15:04] that's got life in it. They need
[1:15:06] something that will produce heat. Amen.
[1:15:08] Something that will produce a living
[1:15:11] God. Amen. And it's up to us as
[1:15:13] believers to produce a living God to all
[1:15:16] those that are around us. Amen. We need
[1:15:19] to create such an atmosphere around us
[1:15:21] that the sinner can see Christ. Amen.
[1:15:25] Amen. Brother Brandham says, "Each one
[1:15:26] of us is a
[1:15:28] creator." Did you know that? Each one of
[1:15:30] you people that's born again is a
[1:15:33] creator.
[1:15:37] Amen. I want to take a minute, if it's
[1:15:40] okay, and talk to you about creating an
[1:15:42] atmosphere. Amen. I'm still on the
[1:15:45] subject of reflecting his light. Amen.
[1:15:48] Let's just tie in the two together here.
[1:15:50] Amen. Man, do you realize that an
[1:15:52] atmosphere that you dwell in, you
[1:15:54] influence somebody else? The atmosphere
[1:15:57] you create around you, you will
[1:15:59] influence that other person. Oh my. Come
[1:16:03] on now. I'm getting somewhere now. Amen.
[1:16:06] You can be negative all the time. You
[1:16:08] can be negative, Nancy, and you can
[1:16:10] build that atmosphere around you. Oh my.
[1:16:13] Come on. You can build that atmosphere
[1:16:15] around you. The next thing you know,
[1:16:16] that person beside you is talking
[1:16:18] negative. that person beside you is just
[1:16:20] is just being all negative and woe is
[1:16:22] me. But if you can build an atmosphere
[1:16:25] of Christ where you just stay positive,
[1:16:28] you no matter what your circumstance is
[1:16:30] and you say, "But Christ is my healer.
[1:16:33] Christ is the joygiver. Christ has
[1:16:35] filled me with the Holy Ghost." Amen.
[1:16:37] Satan may be hallen your mind. But I
[1:16:39] know a God that can deliver you. Create
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:43] atmosphere. That's right. Amen. Getting
[1:16:46] a little ahead of myself.
[1:16:50] Amen. What makes people act like they
[1:16:52] do? Amen. What makes the drunks act like
[1:16:56] to be with uh uh what makes the drunks
[1:16:58] like to be with drunks? Because they
[1:17:01] have something in common. They have
[1:17:03] something in common. And people that
[1:17:05] like to party are not going to get
[1:17:06] invited to people who don't like to go
[1:17:08] to parties. That's that's just what it
[1:17:10] is. Amen. If you're a partygoing person
[1:17:13] and and and you see somebody just
[1:17:15] sitting there like a knot on a log,
[1:17:17] you're not going to ask them to go with
[1:17:19] you to the party. You just won't because
[1:17:21] there's an atmosphere that comes with
[1:17:23] that. Oh my. Because there's no
[1:17:25] connection there. Amen. Brother Bram
[1:17:28] says you don't see crows and doves
[1:17:29] dwelling together because they don't
[1:17:31] have no fellowship. They don't have
[1:17:33] things in common. The crow can fly on a
[1:17:36] dead carcass and eat it, but the dove
[1:17:38] will go to the wheat field and eat the
[1:17:40] grain. Brother Brandham says, "Now, let
[1:17:43] me tell you something. Each man that is
[1:17:45] born again with the spirit of God in him
[1:17:48] is a miniature creator." Now, that may
[1:17:50] shake you a little, but that's the
[1:17:52] truth. We're in the image of God, and
[1:17:54] God is a creator. That's the reason that
[1:17:57] you can believe that God could heal a
[1:17:59] person because God is in you. And God
[1:18:02] made this world. He just spoke it, and
[1:18:04] his word became material. The very
[1:18:07] ground that you're sitting on is the
[1:18:10] word of God made manifest. He didn't uh
[1:18:13] if he didn't, where did he get it? See,
[1:18:16] he just spoke it and it turned into
[1:18:18] existence. Believe in his own he
[1:18:22] believed in his own word. Amen. And if a
[1:18:25] man that's born of the spirit of God,
[1:18:28] he's an offspring of God. And that and
[1:18:31] that part of God is in him. And he
[1:18:35] believes every word that God says will
[1:18:38] material un materialize. See? And so
[1:18:42] that makes him a part of God. The Holy
[1:18:46] Spirit in the man makes him a part of
[1:18:50] God. Amen. That's powerful right there.
[1:18:53] And now, did you ever see people, nice
[1:18:55] people, but you just couldn't hardly
[1:18:57] stand around them? Oh my, we we we run
[1:19:01] into that every day. There's just people
[1:19:03] that that we we we we run into, but we
[1:19:06] Oh, yeah. They're nice. They're
[1:19:07] friendly, and we can be nice and
[1:19:09] friendly, but you just can't you can't
[1:19:11] wait to get away from them. Amen.
[1:19:14] Because they I mean, we don't have
[1:19:17] nothing against them, but you can't
[1:19:18] stand to be around them. Amen. Then you
[1:19:21] just see some people that you just love
[1:19:24] to be around. Amen. You just love to be
[1:19:27] around them. You just love them. It's
[1:19:29] the atmosphere that they've got around
[1:19:32] them. It's the way they live. They
[1:19:35] create an atmosphere that you like to be
[1:19:38] in.
[1:19:40] Oh my. Brother Christian, it's good to
[1:19:42] see you this morning.
[1:19:43] Amen. So, so it's not that you don't
[1:19:46] like that person, you don't like the
[1:19:48] atmosphere that they've created. Amen.
[1:19:51] They're living a life that somewhere in
[1:19:53] the world in their homes and things that
[1:19:55] they're created an atmosphere around
[1:19:57] them that you just can't stand to be
[1:19:59] around. But then those other people that
[1:20:01] you you just love. You you just can't
[1:20:03] wait to see them. When you get together,
[1:20:05] you just have just things in common. You
[1:20:07] just you just love to be around them
[1:20:09] because of the atmosphere they've
[1:20:11] created. Oh my. It's the atmosphere
[1:20:14] around them. Amen. What about God's
[1:20:18] house?
[1:20:19] What about our home?
[1:20:22] What about our workplace?
[1:20:25] The atmosphere we create can change our
[1:20:28] current
[1:20:29] situation. Amen. The atmosphere that
[1:20:32] we're around can change the current the
[1:20:34] current situation. And brother Brandham
[1:20:36] talks about how he came home one day and
[1:20:39] the kids were just fighting and his wife
[1:20:40] was just all stressed out and and tore
[1:20:43] up and he asked her what was going on
[1:20:45] and she was just in a mess and the kids
[1:20:47] hadn't eaten all day and she was just
[1:20:49] tore to pieces. Her her spirit was just
[1:20:52] tore up and he just put his arms around
[1:20:55] her and he began to talk to her softly
[1:20:57] and and begin to pray and the next thing
[1:21:00] you know the kids quit their fighting.
[1:21:03] Amen. and the wife be to calm down and
[1:21:05] the presence of the Lord began to sweep
[1:21:07] through the house. Why? He changed the
[1:21:11] atmosphere. Amen. You have the power
[1:21:13] this morning. If you have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:15] this morning, you've been given the
[1:21:17] power to change the
[1:21:19] atmosphere. Amen. We can change the
[1:21:22] situation around our homes. We can
[1:21:24] change the situation around our lives.
[1:21:27] Amen. We can create such an atmosphere
[1:21:30] that the presence of the Lord can come
[1:21:32] in our midst and the sick can be healed
[1:21:35] and the lost can be saved and people
[1:21:37] getting delivered. Amen. Do you believe
[1:21:40] that this morning? We look at Chariius,
[1:21:44] his daughter lay dying in the bed. Yet
[1:21:46] he didn't doubt. He knew that if he
[1:21:48] could just get to Jesus then everything
[1:21:50] would be all right. Amen. And you can
[1:21:53] come into the presence of the Lord and
[1:21:55] you can't come into the presence of the
[1:21:56] Lord and still remain the same. Amen.
[1:21:59] When you come into the presence of the
[1:22:01] Lord, something has got to take place.
[1:22:04] Amen. Peter and John was walking and
[1:22:06] they came to a lame man, a lame man
[1:22:09] sitting at the gate called beautiful.
[1:22:11] And the man was asking for money and and
[1:22:13] he was lame and bound. And and Peter and
[1:22:16] John, they had something more valuable
[1:22:18] than money. They had the presence of the
[1:22:21] Lord with them. And Peter said, "Silver
[1:22:23] and gold have I none, but what I do
[1:22:25] have, I give to thee. Just rise up and
[1:22:29] walk." And the man couldn't just sit
[1:22:31] there and stare. He had come contact
[1:22:34] with an atmosphere that was greater than
[1:22:37] his own
[1:22:38] circumstance. Oh my. An
[1:22:45] atmosphere. Amen. That is why we feed
[1:22:48] off the tapes daily. That is why we read
[1:22:50] our Bible and we pray every day is so we
[1:22:53] can create an atmosphere in our homes,
[1:22:56] in our church, in our lives that people
[1:22:59] around us, their situations can be
[1:23:02] changed in a moment. Amen. To create an
[1:23:05] atmosphere for the Lord to have his way
[1:23:06] in his people. Amen. That's why we come
[1:23:09] to church early to pray and to meditate
[1:23:11] on the Lord. That is why we live clean
[1:23:14] and holy before the Lord to create an
[1:23:17] atmosphere. To create an atmosphere for
[1:23:20] the Lord to come and do something. Amen.
[1:23:24] You may say, "Well, I'm not a preacher.
[1:23:26] I'm not a musician or I'm not a song
[1:23:29] leader or I'm not a Sunday school
[1:23:31] teacher. I'm not a deacon. I I'm just a
[1:23:34] nobody." You have been put on this earth
[1:23:38] to reflect Jesus Christ. Amen. And you
[1:23:42] have the power to create an atmosphere
[1:23:44] for someone here this morning to receive
[1:23:47] a blessing.
[1:23:50] Oh my. We have an important duty. If you
[1:23:54] could understand that this morning, we
[1:23:56] don't have to be some great person. We
[1:23:59] don't have to be some
[1:24:01] great man or woman, a name that's well
[1:24:04] known among thousands of people. We
[1:24:07] don't have to. You can just be a
[1:24:09] housewife. You could just you could be a
[1:24:11] cook. You you could be you could be h
[1:24:15] working out. Whatever you may
[1:24:17] be, you have that power to create an
[1:24:22] atmosphere.
[1:24:25] Amen. That someone can receive their
[1:24:29] blessing. Amen. I when I was a little
[1:24:31] boy, I heard this saying that always
[1:24:33] stuck with me. Amen. What you put into a
[1:24:36] service is what you'll get out. Oh my,
[1:24:41] that's powerful right there. What you
[1:24:43] put in a service is what you'll get out.
[1:24:46] Meaning, if you come to church just
[1:24:48] half-heartedly. Now, now, forgive me.
[1:24:50] I'm not speaking to anyone this morning.
[1:24:53] This was just on my heart and and I just
[1:24:55] pray it can be a blessing. But if you
[1:24:57] come to church half-heartedly or or you
[1:24:59] come to church constantly and you want
[1:25:01] to fall asleep on the preacher or on the
[1:25:03] song leader and you don't want to get in
[1:25:05] and you don't want to press, Amen. and
[1:25:07] you come
[1:25:08] and upset because someone sat in your
[1:25:11] seat or or whatever or you come to find
[1:25:14] fault in what the preacher is preaching
[1:25:16] and walk out and say, "Well, I didn't
[1:25:18] get my blessing today." It's because you
[1:25:20] created the wrong atmosphere.
[1:25:23] Oh my, you created the wrong
[1:25:26] atmosphere. You've got out what you put
[1:25:29] in.
[1:25:31] Oh, that's powerful. Amen. You're going
[1:25:35] to come come find fault with your
[1:25:36] brother or your sister. Amen. Watch out.
[1:25:39] You may not receive your blessing then.
[1:25:41] Amen. Cuz you're going to create the
[1:25:43] wrong atmosphere. But if you can create
[1:25:45] the right atmosphere around you and then
[1:25:48] cuz someone here is needing a touch from
[1:25:50] the Lord. Create the right atmosphere.
[1:25:54] Press. Get behind the preacher. Get
[1:25:56] behind the song leader and press and
[1:25:59] press your way through. You may be
[1:26:01] tired, but press your way through.
[1:26:05] Amen. If you come expecting God to fill
[1:26:08] this place with his presence and you
[1:26:10] bring your lick of fire, then something
[1:26:12] has got to happen. Someone is going to
[1:26:15] receive their blessing. If you come with
[1:26:17] expectation for God to do something and
[1:26:20] you come with a hungry heart and a
[1:26:22] thirsty heart, then watch, God is going
[1:26:25] to do something. Create the right
[1:26:28] atmosphere. Amen.
[1:26:31] create the right atmosphere. It may be
[1:26:34] your wife that's needing a touch. It may
[1:26:37] be your husband that's needing a touch.
[1:26:39] It may be your children needing the Holy
[1:26:42] Ghost. It may be that your client at
[1:26:45] work is needing a touch from the Lord.
[1:26:47] Oh, come on now. It may be that person
[1:26:49] at the coffee shop that's needing a
[1:26:51] touch from the Lord. It may be that
[1:26:53] person in the grocery store needing
[1:26:55] something from the Lord. create an
[1:26:58] atmosphere that reflects Jesus Christ.
[1:27:03] Amen. We have a powerful message. Amen.
[1:27:06] We We have We have the power. Amen. God
[1:27:09] has given us power to save the lost
[1:27:12] soul.
[1:27:13] Amen. Create an atmosphere. Amen. in
[1:27:16] your home. If the wife is having a bad
[1:27:18] day or the kids or even your husband is
[1:27:20] having a bad day, you had the power as a
[1:27:23] son and daughter of God to turn any
[1:27:26] situation around. You have it in you to
[1:27:29] reflect Christ to your family. Oh my
[1:27:34] Lord. Amen. I remember Amen. when we
[1:27:37] were kids, brother Josiah knows, but we
[1:27:39] would uh go swimming at a place there in
[1:27:41] Arizona. Oh my. And the water was just
[1:27:44] cold. But it was just woo man. I had a
[1:27:46] waterfall and a log across this
[1:27:49] waterfall and it was just one of our you
[1:27:51] had to hike in there to get there. But
[1:27:53] it was it was amazing and just so
[1:27:56] beautiful. Mountains all around and and
[1:27:58] the rocks and things and then and then
[1:28:00] all a sudden there's just this big pool
[1:28:01] of water. Amen. We'd go swimming in and
[1:28:04] and like I said it was just oh my it was
[1:28:06] cold. And after a while, we'd get too
[1:28:09] cold and and and mom would say, "Well,
[1:28:12] just go lay in the sun and warm up. Just
[1:28:15] go just go lay out on that rock over
[1:28:17] there and just just spread out and and
[1:28:19] just warm up. Let that sun be down on
[1:28:22] you and you can warm up." Amen. And some
[1:28:24] of us kids would go and find a spot on
[1:28:26] the rock where the sun has been shining
[1:28:28] down on the uh shining down in the
[1:28:30] longest. And we would lay there and just
[1:28:32] soak up the presence of the sun. Amen.
[1:28:36] It would just warm us up. Amen. If I
[1:28:38] could say this this morning, if you were
[1:28:40] starting to become cold and starchy this
[1:28:42] morning, amen. You just can't seem to to
[1:28:45] to let your little light so shine before
[1:28:48] men and the devil just seems to be
[1:28:50] pounding your your mind and and your
[1:28:52] heart and and it just seems you can't
[1:28:54] even ever get a break. Amen. Let me say
[1:28:56] this. Just go lay on the rock of ages
[1:28:59] this morning and go lay out in the
[1:29:01] presence of the sen this morning. Amen.
[1:29:05] And once you can ever get in the
[1:29:06] presence of the sun, something is going
[1:29:09] to take
[1:29:10] place. Oh my, you've got to create an
[1:29:14] atmosphere and your faith will do it.
[1:29:18] Brother Brandham says they were all in
[1:29:20] the upper room with one accord. When
[1:29:22] suddenly there came from heaven a sound
[1:29:24] of a rushing mighty wind, the atmosphere
[1:29:27] was just right. It takes an atmosphere
[1:29:30] to do anything. Amen. If you want
[1:29:33] healing, if you want a deliverance, if
[1:29:36] you want a renewing in your heart, if if
[1:29:38] you want your loved ones saved, get
[1:29:40] under the right atmosphere for it. Oh
[1:29:43] my. Mark 11:23 says, "For verily I say
[1:29:47] unto you, that whosoever say unto this
[1:29:49] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[1:29:50] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[1:29:53] in his heart, but shall believe those
[1:29:56] things which he saith shall come to
[1:29:58] pass, he shall have whatsoever he
[1:30:02] saith."
[1:30:04] Don't let
[1:30:06] doubt come into your atmosphere.
[1:30:10] Let faith take a hold of it. Amen.
[1:30:12] Brother Brandham says, "You just keep
[1:30:13] believing. Create the
[1:30:16] atmosphere. Never let doubt come around
[1:30:19] you. Believe all the time. Don't
[1:30:22] accompany anything. Don't accompany any
[1:30:25] of that doubt at all. No sir. No matter
[1:30:27] what the circumstance is, push away
[1:30:29] doubt. Walk right on through it. Just
[1:30:33] refuse it." Yes, sir. He says, "Amen."
[1:30:36] It's It's time that we lay aside the
[1:30:38] hurt. It's time that we lay aside the
[1:30:42] complexes. It's time that we lay aside
[1:30:44] the malice in your heart. Amen. We're
[1:30:46] not put here just to be benchwarmers. We
[1:30:49] don't come to church just to pay our
[1:30:51] dues and then go home and and do
[1:30:53] whatever we do. Amen. But we've been
[1:30:56] given our purpose. We've been given a
[1:30:58] commission to preach the gospel to every
[1:31:01] hungry soul. Amen. And as we're
[1:31:03] believing the word and walking under the
[1:31:05] light that's been given us for this day,
[1:31:07] let's reflect that light to those around
[1:31:10] us that they may glorify our father
[1:31:12] which is in heaven. Oh my. Creating the
[1:31:15] right atmosphere for God to do
[1:31:18] something. Amen. You take an apple seed
[1:31:21] and you plant it in the ground. Amen.
[1:31:23] You don't have to pull it out every day
[1:31:25] to see if it's going to sprout. Amen.
[1:31:27] You don't have to pull it out just to
[1:31:28] see if it's growing. You don't have to
[1:31:30] do little dances or or sing to it every
[1:31:33] day for it to grow. But if you just give
[1:31:35] it some water and you give it and you
[1:31:38] let the sun shine on it, it will produce
[1:31:41] exactly what it was meant to be. Amen.
[1:31:44] If the atmosphere is just right, it will
[1:31:46] produce exactly what it's to it's to be
[1:31:50] meant to be an apple tree. Amen. And
[1:31:53] it's the same with us today. God placed
[1:31:56] a seed in each everyone inside each and
[1:31:59] every one of us. Amen. And we don't have
[1:32:01] to put on a show. We don't have to work
[1:32:04] something up. We don't have to try
[1:32:06] within ourselves to produce what's in
[1:32:08] us. We don't have to memorize the whole
[1:32:10] Bible or or or make sure we quote every
[1:32:13] quote at the top of our heads. But when
[1:32:15] we just begin to surrender ourselves to
[1:32:18] the message and we begin to soak up the
[1:32:21] presence of the esroin, then it will
[1:32:23] produce exactly what we were meant to
[1:32:26] be. Amen. An unstoppable force. Amen. A
[1:32:31] light in the darkness. Amen. And only
[1:32:35] and only this message can produce that.
[1:32:41] Do you believe that this morning? Lord.
[1:32:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. I think I've kept
[1:32:46] you long enough. If the musicians will
[1:32:49] come.
[1:32:51] Amen.
[1:32:56] Amen. If I could read 2 Corinthians
[1:32:59] 4, our closing
[1:33:02] scripture says, "But if our gospel be
[1:33:06] hid, it is hid to them that are lost.
[1:33:10] in whom the God of this world hath
[1:33:12] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:33:15] not. Lest the light of the
[1:33:18] gospel, lest the light of the glorious
[1:33:21] gospel of Christ, who is the image of
[1:33:23] God, should shine unto them. Amen. For
[1:33:27] we preach not
[1:33:29] ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord,
[1:33:32] and ourselves, your servants for Jesus's
[1:33:35] sake. For God who commanded the light to
[1:33:38] shine out of darkness hath shined in our
[1:33:41] hearts to give the light of the
[1:33:43] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[1:33:46] face of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:33:50] Amen. Amen. If we hide our light, if we
[1:33:54] place our light where no one can see,
[1:33:57] then we hide it from a hungry world. We
[1:33:59] hide it from a hungry soul. Amen.
[1:34:03] the the the lost soul may not be the
[1:34:06] person that's worldly as all get out.
[1:34:10] That last soul may be someone sitting
[1:34:12] next to you. We don't know who that last
[1:34:15] soul is. They may have a religious
[1:34:17] spirit on them, which is the worst
[1:34:18] spirit of them all. They may be so tied
[1:34:21] down with a religious
[1:34:24] spirit. But we must always reflect
[1:34:27] Christ. We all we must always create
[1:34:30] such an atmosphere that we reflect
[1:34:33] Christ that that that the hungry would
[1:34:35] would feel so welcome around us that
[1:34:38] that the lost would want to come in and
[1:34:40] be saved that they couldn't just stand
[1:34:42] it. They would have to come up to the
[1:34:43] altar and get saved.
[1:34:46] Amen. We must reflect Christ not only in
[1:34:50] the church but in our homes. It's so
[1:34:53] important. It is so important what we
[1:34:56] have in our homes.
[1:34:58] Oh my. We let the we if we left the
[1:35:01] world in our homes. I was
[1:35:04] reading or listening to brother Brandham
[1:35:07] the other day and brother Brandham I
[1:35:10] heard him say say this. He says if Jesus
[1:35:15] leaves your
[1:35:17] home you better watch
[1:35:20] out. If Jesus ever leaves your
[1:35:23] home. Oh my. You better watch
[1:35:27] out. He's so sensitive. His spirit is
[1:35:31] sensitive. That's why we don't let the
[1:35:33] kids run around all over the place. That
[1:35:34] is why we don't keep getting up and
[1:35:36] going out back and forth and we That's
[1:35:38] why we don't sit on the preacher. We
[1:35:40] don't sit on the song leader. We get
[1:35:41] into service because the spirit of the
[1:35:43] Lord is sensitive. You could grieve the
[1:35:46] spirit of the spirit of the Lord away
[1:35:48] and then someone can lose their
[1:35:49] blessing.
[1:35:52] But if we can always create such an
[1:35:54] atmosphere in our homes, in our lives,
[1:35:57] at our work, in our car, wherever we
[1:36:00] might be, and being alone by
[1:36:04] ourselves, that's when we become really
[1:36:07] us. When we're alone by ourselves, the
[1:36:10] real us comes
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:12] out. What are we going to do? We've got
[1:36:16] to reflect this message. We have to show
[1:36:20] the world. We have to show our
[1:36:22] neighbors. We have to show our wives. We
[1:36:24] have to show our children that this
[1:36:26] message is the way. This message is the
[1:36:29] true light. Oh my. Let's walk under that
[1:36:33] light of his word. Amen. Do you love the
[1:36:38] Lord this morning? Can you give the Lord
[1:36:40] a hand clap of praise this morning? Oh,
[1:36:43] the Lord has been so
[1:36:45] good.
[1:36:47] Amen. I'm sorry I've kept you. Amen. And
[1:36:50] I I I trust it was a blessing. I know it
[1:36:54] was to me studying this. Oh my, my my my
[1:36:58] heart just longs to just be what the
[1:37:01] Lord wants me to be and just be so
[1:37:04] sensitive to his presence and be so
[1:37:06] sensitive to his spirit and and I my
[1:37:10] desire is I don't want to ever do
[1:37:11] anything that would cause the Lord to
[1:37:13] ever leave me to to cause the Lord to
[1:37:16] ever leave my home and and my family and
[1:37:19] my children. Amen. As the man of my
[1:37:23] home, I am responsible for what happens
[1:37:25] to my
[1:37:26] family. Oh
[1:37:29] my. And if every true believer this
[1:37:32] morning is in your heart or it should be
[1:37:34] in your heart to want to be like Christ
[1:37:38] and reflect
[1:37:40] Christ. Amen. We've got to watch what we
[1:37:43] say. Watch what we do. Someone is
[1:37:46] watching. Someone is hungry.
[1:37:48] And if you are not reflecting Christ,
[1:37:50] they'll go to the church next door.
[1:37:53] They'll go to the church right down the
[1:37:54] street. They'll go to the church the
[1:37:56] Baptist church. They'll go to the to the
[1:37:58] to wherever. They'll go to wherever they
[1:38:01] feel welcome. And if we can't produce a
[1:38:04] Christ to the world, Amen. We we must.
[1:38:08] Amen. Amen. And I believe that there are
[1:38:11] there are believers here this morning
[1:38:13] that are reflecting Christ. Amen. We
[1:38:15] wouldn't be up here preaching the word
[1:38:17] if we didn't know. If we knew that y'all
[1:38:20] weren't uh uh producing a Christ.
[1:38:23] Amen. Amen. Can we just stand to our
[1:38:26] feet this
[1:38:27] morning? I want to
[1:38:30] live the
[1:38:33] way he wants me to
[1:38:37] live. I want to
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:41] give until there's just no more to
[1:38:48] give. I want to
[1:38:52] love love till there's just no more
[1:38:58] love. Oh, I could
[1:39:01] never ever out love the Lord. Can we go
[1:39:06] up again?
[1:39:08] Sing it with all your hands. We want to
[1:39:12] live the
[1:39:14] way. Is that your desire this
[1:39:18] morning? Lord, I want to live the way
[1:39:20] you want me to live. Lord, I want to
[1:39:23] reflect you this
[1:39:25] morning. I want a hungry world to see
[1:39:28] Christ through
[1:39:29] me. Oh, we all have a purpose this
[1:39:32] morning. And that purpose is to reflect
[1:39:35] Jesus Christ.
[1:39:38] All
[1:39:39] mine. Oh, I could
[1:39:42] never ever
[1:39:45] outlive the Lord. With all your hearts
[1:39:49] now. Oh, I want to
[1:39:53] live the
[1:39:55] way he wants me to live.

[1:40:03] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:40:11] Lord, I want to
[1:40:14] love love till there's just no more
[1:40:21] love. I could
[1:40:24] never ever
[1:40:26] love the Lord to my Jesus.
