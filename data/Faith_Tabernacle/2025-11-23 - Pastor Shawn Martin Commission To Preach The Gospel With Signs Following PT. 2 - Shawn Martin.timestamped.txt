[41:33] Amen. Well, aren't you glad for the
[41:35] word?
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] Amen. And uh we're so thankful that
[41:44] [snorts] we have something that we can
[41:46] [music] stand by and that stands with us
[41:49] and we can defeat [music] Satan.
[41:53] Amen. On the on the grounds, Amen. of
[41:56] [music] any situation under any
[41:59] condition. Amen. God is so good to us.
[42:03] Amen. Well, good morning. It's good to
[42:06] be [music] here. House of the Lord and
[42:08] the musicians can be dismissed. [snorts]
[42:12] Amen. A beautiful [music] day today and
[42:14] um it's hard to believe that we're
[42:18] closing the end of the year. Getting
[42:20] close and
[42:22] [clears throat] and u man this year has
[42:25] gone by so fast. But that's all right.
[42:28] It just brings us closer to
[42:32] uh going home.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, um, if you have your
[42:38] Bibles, we're going to go to the book of
[42:41] Mark, the 16th chapter.
[42:46] And it's um, uh, good to have Sister Kim
[42:51] Weeks with us. Amen. And see that she is
[42:54] doing good.
[42:57] And, um,
[43:00] good to have Brother Terry and, Sister
[43:03] Alice back with us. and
[43:06] &gt;&gt; they're doing good. And
[43:08] &gt;&gt; so we thank the Lord for that. And
[43:12] Amen. And just uh good to have everyone
[43:15] as it's been said. Uh we just really
[43:18] thank the Lord for God u moving on
[43:21] Sister Martha's behalf.
[43:24] Amen. Causing that tumor to shrink. And
[43:27] I just believe it's going to shrink on
[43:29] down.
[43:30] And um you know we had had prayer for
[43:35] um a little a while back uh for her eye.
[43:39] It was turning bloodshot
[43:42] and um doctor says that she'd more
[43:44] likely she'd have a red spot. Is that
[43:47] right? A red in her eye permanently. But
[43:52] um they were showing me the other day
[43:53] it's just totally gone.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; And uh so we thank the Lord for that.
[43:59] You know, God just moves. He may not
[44:01] move in a thunderous way sometimes, but
[44:04] he just moves silently. And um and we we
[44:09] just thank the Lord. And you know, I
[44:11] believe God could have kept Sister
[44:13] Martha from even going through this, but
[44:15] he had a reason to do it. But and God
[44:18] loves to show his power.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; He loves to show that he's able to do
[44:23] anything. And he he just loves, you
[44:26] know, he just can keep the physicians
[44:28] baffled and uh and many times he keeps
[44:32] us baffled, you know, um but we just
[44:35] give him all glory and praise and um
[44:39] brother Joe's sister-in-law Sharon doing
[44:43] good and is her name Sharon or Shannon?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Shannon.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Shannon. I thought I thought that's what
[44:49] it was. usband. Um so Shannon and um I
[44:54] had just got a report I before I came up
[44:57] that she's off of life
[45:01] uh the breathing I guess life support I
[45:03] guess what that is and then um uh
[45:06] ventilator off the ventilator. She's out
[45:08] of ICU
[45:10] and um so that's a real miracle in
[45:13] itself.
[45:14] Um
[45:16] um it's kind of hard to explain what she
[45:18] had but um uh she was in a desperate
[45:22] situation
[45:23] and uh but we just praying and so we
[45:27] thank the Lord that u he's just uh
[45:30] helping her to recover and believe that
[45:33] she's just going to come out um fine.
[45:37] Praise the Lord. She's only 50 years
[45:39] old, I think. And so um uh but uh the
[45:44] Lord's just good. Uh just a reminder of
[45:47] service this evening at 4 and um be
[45:52] having testimony and song and so looking
[45:55] forward to that. And um also uh there's
[45:58] going to be different ones be going out
[46:00] of town this week for Thanksgiving. And
[46:03] so we want to keep them in our prayer
[46:06] that the Lord just uh keeps them. And um
[46:10] uh be no service Wednesday night and uh
[46:13] so we'll uh the Lord willing meet back u
[46:18] on next Sunday. And um anyways uh before
[46:23] we go into the word, may we just bow our
[46:25] heads and talk to the Lord and as we
[46:30] know that we need him
[46:33] now more than ever before. and and I
[46:36] certainly want to rely on him. Amen.
[46:40] Father,
[46:43] Lord, we're so thankful that you've
[46:45] called us out of darkness. You've chosen
[46:48] us for this age.
[46:51] But Father, may we always be reminded
[46:56] that we're nothing without you.
[46:59] You've chose us. You've redeemed us,
[47:01] cleansed us, that you could work through
[47:03] us.
[47:05] Father, we just humble ourselves here
[47:08] this morning. and realizing our
[47:11] insufficiencies, our
[47:14] weaknesses. Father,
[47:17] we're asking Lord that you would
[47:19] overlook it all and that you would just
[47:22] come into this vessel and that you would
[47:25] speak to your people.
[47:28] And father that your spirit would anoint
[47:31] the people, Father, and any spirit that
[47:36] would be waging a war in their minds and
[47:41] trying to get them distracted or
[47:44] whatever. May you just come and
[47:47] intervene. And Father, may we sit in
[47:50] heavenly places here today,
[47:53] Lord. May we just uh bask in your
[47:56] presence and hear from you and that your
[48:00] word could be effective in our lives.
[48:03] May Satan be defeated, Lord, in every
[48:07] aspect that he would come at us, Father.
[48:11] And we see that victory is one. We ask
[48:17] it, Father, in Jesus Christ's name.
[48:20] Amen. And amen.
[48:23] So, we want to look at Mark
[48:26] [snorts]
[48:27] um the 16th chapter
[48:32] and um
[48:34] start at the 15th verse. And he said
[48:37] unto them,
[48:40] "Go ye into all the world and preach the
[48:43] gospel to every creature.
[48:45] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[48:48] be saved, but he that believeth not
[48:49] shall be damned. And these signs shall
[48:52] follow them that believe. In my name
[48:56] shall they cast out devils. They shall
[48:58] speak with new tongues. They shall take
[49:01] up serpents. And if any deadly if they
[49:05] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[49:07] hurt them. They shall lay on the sick
[49:10] and they shall recover. Praise the Lord.
[49:15] Then Romans 1 and 16.
[49:20] Romans chapter 1
[49:25] and
[49:26] um 16
[49:30] we know it
[49:32] but um
[49:35] says [clears throat] for I am not
[49:36] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[49:40] is the power of God. Everybody say, "It
[49:43] is the power of God
[49:46] &gt;&gt; unto salvation to everyone that
[49:48] believeth, to the Jew first, and also to
[49:51] the Greek. For therein is the
[49:53] righteousness of God revealed from faith
[49:56] to faith, as it is written, the just
[49:59] shall live by faith." Amen. You can have
[50:03] your seats this morning.
[50:06] And um
[50:09] if I
[50:12] used the title commissioned to preach
[50:14] the gospel with signs
[50:18] following the believer.
[50:20] And the word of God um
[50:25] as we've been taught and we see it all
[50:28] through scripture, but the word of God
[50:30] is the best weapon
[50:33] uh that God could have given man.
[50:37] It's um it's the greatest thing. Um
[50:42] there Paul would tell us there in
[50:44] Hebrews 4:12, "For the word of God is is
[50:48] quick and powerful,
[50:50] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; piercing even to the dividing aunderder
[50:57] of soul and spirit, and of the joints
[51:00] and of mara, and is a discerner of the
[51:03] thoughts and intents of the heart.
[51:06] So, uh, the word of God, that's what the
[51:09] word of God is. It's a sword. It's it's
[51:12] sharp. It's powerful. It's it's
[51:15] something that, um, uh, we all need. And
[51:19] we, we have seen how powerful that word
[51:21] of God is in this age,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; But God gave us the Bible um, in this
[51:27] age. Um,
[51:29] um, well, we've had the Bible for u many
[51:34] years. uh which is the word of God and
[51:37] we thank God for that. We have the
[51:39] written word. Um because the written
[51:43] word is is is just as powerful and
[51:46] because it is the word of God but it was
[51:49] given to us by inspiration.
[51:52] All scripture is given by inspiration.
[51:56] and um uh men of God uh wrote and and
[52:03] they spoke as they were moved by the
[52:06] Holy Ghost.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And so, but then God gave us gives us
[52:13] his word through the preaching of the
[52:15] gospel.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; So, just having the Bible
[52:20] um is not enough. It's it's important to
[52:23] have the Bible. It's important to read
[52:25] the Bible. I um I think we should read
[52:30] it on a daily basis. Um reading the
[52:33] Bible and and never never uh letting
[52:38] that go. Uh
[52:41] but then God uh shows the preaching. It
[52:46] all works. It all works together. And
[52:50] [snorts] he gives us his word through
[52:53] preaching. Uh and and we know that God
[52:58] is perfect. Uh the Bible says God's way
[53:03] is perfect. As for God, his way is
[53:05] perfect.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; And so perfect means he cannot change.
[53:09] It's complete. It's it's something that
[53:12] is it is it is um he can't get any
[53:16] better. Uh he can't he can't diminish.
[53:20] He he can't it's it's just he's perfect.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Uh kind of hard to explain perfect. Uh
[53:26] because when we think we've arrived in
[53:28] perfection, then we're always learning
[53:30] something and we will always do that.
[53:33] But God, once he makes a decision, that
[53:36] decision is perfect because he's
[53:38] perfect. His word is perfect. His his uh
[53:42] attributes are perfect and and things
[53:44] like that. So God chose man. He he could
[53:48] have chose the wind. He could have chose
[53:49] the son. He could have chose anything to
[53:52] preach the gospel. But he chose man.
[53:54] That's right.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; And as we know, the Bible says that God
[53:58] set within the church a five-fold
[54:00] ministry of pastor, teacher, prophet,
[54:04] evangelist, apostle, which is a
[54:06] missionary and and things like that.
[54:09] It's not that man can it's not for man
[54:13] to glorify himself as man has done. It's
[54:17] not that man builds his own kingdom. See
[54:20] how many followers he can get and and
[54:23] all that. That's God's design or purpose
[54:27] as as to why he chose man to preach the
[54:30] gospel.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And but but the gospel is to
[54:35] deliver it's it's to deliver the the
[54:39] people from the power of Satan. It's to
[54:44] uh it's to bring that elect in. And we
[54:48] all were were bound un by Satan. We all
[54:53] were were in the pawn shop, if we could
[54:56] say it that way. We all were in in
[54:59] trouble uh and and left to Satan's
[55:03] demise and and things. But when the
[55:06] gospel came, Amen. then uh we're here
[55:10] today.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Satan wouldn't have brought us here. I
[55:14] promise you that.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Uh Satan wouldn't want us to believe the
[55:18] message. Satan wouldn't want us to come
[55:20] in contact with God and get closer to
[55:23] God and and these things. But it's
[55:26] because there was a gospel that was
[55:28] preached unto us.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And so, uh God gave the church the
[55:33] gospel. And in there is the power to
[55:37] heal the sick. Uh raise the dead. Um uh
[55:43] in the gospel is the power to save and
[55:46] to deliver and and to set free. It has
[55:50] the power to cast out demons. and not
[55:54] only just to cast out demons, but it has
[55:57] the power to establish and to
[56:00] positionally place uh us in Christ.
[56:05] That's the preaching of the gospel. And
[56:08] uh so I'm I'm thankful for the gospel.
[56:11] And
[56:13] so when the gospel is preached, it will
[56:15] be effective to the believer. Ain't that
[56:17] right?
[56:18] &gt;&gt; And when the gospel is preached, anxiety
[56:21] will leave. When the gospel is preached,
[56:23] depression will leave. When the gospel
[56:26] is preached, I've seen it when when the
[56:28] gospel just by preaching the gospel,
[56:30] blind eyes come open.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Uh uh crippled walk and not even having
[56:36] hand on them. Amen. And it's just the
[56:40] power of the gospel.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Fear will leave just through the power
[56:45] of of through the gospel. And and so
[56:48] brother Brandham even talking he's
[56:50] talking about some ladies and and
[56:53] sitting there uh the the night before in
[56:57] wheelchairs. He said they heard the good
[56:58] news. They heard the gospel. And he says
[57:01] tonight their wheelchairs are not here.
[57:03] They're probably sitting out there in
[57:05] the audience somewhere. They were free.
[57:08] He said they were free all the time.
[57:09] Jesus cut them loose at Calvary when the
[57:12] bloodstream came from his body to free
[57:15] every person from sickness. See the
[57:17] sinners that accepted Christ last night
[57:20] was sitting bound last night under the
[57:22] chain of sin and tonight is joining the
[57:25] freedom of the Lord Jesus after they
[57:28] heard of the uh emancipation
[57:31] of the proclamation they are free. See
[57:34] so the preaching of the gospel set them
[57:37] free.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, I believe that
[57:40] the preaching of the gospel is still
[57:42] effective today.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and the preaching of the
[57:47] gospel. Now, we were sinners and we're
[57:49] not now. Amen. And I pray that all of us
[57:52] are in that situation today. Amen. That
[57:55] we were bound and now we're free. We we
[57:58] were addicted to things, but now we're
[58:01] free. And and and and all these things.
[58:04] But even then, look how the gospel is
[58:07] still affecting us. The preaching of the
[58:09] gospel is still working in our lives. So
[58:13] the preaching of the gospel isn't just
[58:14] for sinners. It isn't just for the sick.
[58:18] It's for every aspect of our lives. The
[58:23] preaching of the gospel. And so of
[58:26] course it's not going to be effective to
[58:28] everyone because not everyone is a
[58:31] believer. Ain't that right?
[58:34] And so and to be honest, there are more
[58:38] unbelievers than there are believers
[58:40] today. Yeah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And how I know that is you're looking
[58:45] around and and um um you know the gospel
[58:50] isn't having an effect on people like
[58:53] it's supposed to. Uh we have the best
[58:56] medicine that we have we have ever had.
[58:59] We have the best doctors than we than
[59:01] we've ever had. We've got the best
[59:03] hospitals than we ever have. And yet we
[59:05] got more sickness than we've ever had.
[59:08] And and uh uh brother Brown said it's
[59:11] because we have more sin and unbelief
[59:13] this world has ever known.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; And he says, "See, we got too many
[59:17] things that's got people's minds all
[59:19] tore up. Is this right? And is this
[59:22] right? And is that right?" And and and
[59:24] and people, sad to say, people even in
[59:28] churches are have got more questions
[59:31] than they have answers. Amen. So
[59:34] something wrong there. Ain't that right?
[59:36] Amen. Because the gospel is to be given
[59:38] answers, not questions. It's to give
[59:41] answers. And yet people have got more
[59:43] questions than they have the answers.
[59:45] And he says, "And the poor people don't
[59:48] know what to do." Ain't that right?
[59:51] Well, we're not part of that group that
[59:53] don't know what to do. Amen. Uh uh we
[59:57] have the answers. And so Jesus, the last
[1:00:01] commission that Jesus gave the church is
[1:00:04] preach the gospel. That's the last
[1:00:06] commission is go into all the world
[1:00:09] preach the gospel. Now the prophet says
[1:00:12] making the word live is the gospel.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Making the word live is the gospel.
[1:00:20] Ain't that right?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; So now everyone
[1:00:25] uh that's baptized into the body of
[1:00:28] Christ has a part in this gospel.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; We have a part. And you may not be
[1:00:35] called to stand behind a pulpit and
[1:00:37] declare the word of God. You may not be
[1:00:40] called to be a preacher in that sense of
[1:00:44] being able to explain the word, but
[1:00:46] every one of us are called to live that
[1:00:51] word to to live a sermon. So, so you're
[1:00:55] not maybe not standing here like I would
[1:00:58] be today preaching a sermon, but you're
[1:01:02] living a sermon. You got a sermon,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; every one of us. And that's part of the
[1:01:07] gospel.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; And and and so there is power in your
[1:01:14] sermon.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Because you are living out the word of
[1:01:19] God.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; It's not the man that has the power.
[1:01:23] It's the word of God that holds the
[1:01:25] power.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And whether the man is preaching a
[1:01:28] sermon, if it's the word of God, there's
[1:01:31] power that is coming forth. Or whether a
[1:01:34] a man or woman is living the sermon,
[1:01:38] there's power in that.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't know about
[1:01:41] that." Well, Brother Brown or or Paul
[1:01:43] Peter talks about you w the wife and and
[1:01:46] and he's also, I'm sure, talking uh to
[1:01:50] the husband as well. But 1 Peter 3:1
[1:01:52] says, "Likewise, you wives be in
[1:01:55] subjection to your own husbands, that if
[1:01:58] any obey not the word,
[1:02:01] they also may without the word be won by
[1:02:05] the lifestyle
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; or the conversation, the life, the
[1:02:10] sermon that you're living. They could be
[1:02:13] one by that."
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This is why brother
[1:02:17] Bram says, "How we need in
[1:02:20] Jeffersonville thousands of lived
[1:02:22] voices, the thunder of God thundering
[1:02:25] out in sweetness and holiness and
[1:02:27] purity, undefiled lives walking around
[1:02:31] in the earth today without a blemish."
[1:02:33] Yes, sir. Real Christians, that's the
[1:02:35] thunder against the enemy. The devil
[1:02:37] don't care how loud you can holler. The
[1:02:39] devil don't care how much you can jump
[1:02:42] and how much you can do this OR SHOUT.
[1:02:45] WHAT HURTS THE DEVIL is to see that
[1:02:48] sanctified holy life consecrated to God.
[1:02:52] Say anything to him, call him anything
[1:02:55] and he's just as sweet as can be and
[1:02:57] move right on. That throws him away.
[1:03:01] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:03:04] devil.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Brown said, "Let
[1:03:09] your sermon be lived." Everybody say,
[1:03:10] "Let my sermon be lived."
[1:03:13] Let our sermon be lived.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; See, it's the voice of God that'll bring
[1:03:17] reproach to them who reject it. They
[1:03:20] say, "No man, no one can put a finger on
[1:03:22] his or her life. They're sweet living."
[1:03:25] See, if there's, if there ever was a man
[1:03:27] of God, it's that man or that woman. Can
[1:03:30] you say amen?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Bram said, "Let
[1:03:33] your life be your pulpit."
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Now, that's powerful.
[1:03:41] Let your life
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; be your pulpit.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; There's there there are some MEN THAT
[1:03:47] ARE CALLED TO STAND BEHIND A WOODEN
[1:03:49] pulpit or a pulpit AND TO PREACH THE
[1:03:52] GOSPEL, but every one of us, our lives
[1:03:55] are to be our pulpit.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:04:03] So
[1:04:04] now, if you're not called to teach the
[1:04:07] word, to preach the word, explain the
[1:04:10] word, don't try it.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's not your call.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Don't don't try it. Brother Brandon says
[1:04:16] in talking to the pastors, he says,
[1:04:18] "Remember your ley sometimes tries to
[1:04:22] explain things and do things. It's best
[1:04:25] that you instruct them not to do it."
[1:04:28] YEAH.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY WANTS to know something, let
[1:04:31] them the one that's instructed to do it.
[1:04:35] You see, say, well, now, like somebody
[1:04:38] would say, hey, I tell you, they tell me
[1:04:40] you over at your church, you believe in
[1:04:43] eternal security. Now, you better watch.
[1:04:46] You'll probably get in a bigger mess
[1:04:48] than you ever was in and make him worse
[1:04:51] off than ever. See, trying to explain
[1:04:55] that. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; See, he said, "Say, I I tell you." So,
[1:05:00] he's tell Now, this is what you're
[1:05:01] supposed to if you're not to if you
[1:05:03] don't know if you're not called to
[1:05:05] explain it. Say, "I tell you, uh uh tell
[1:05:09] you what, if you'll come over and ask
[1:05:10] our pastor, see, you go talk to him."
[1:05:14] See, that that is true. I know our
[1:05:16] pastor believes that. I believe it also,
[1:05:19] but I'm not able to to support. I'm not
[1:05:22] a preacher. I just believe it. That's
[1:05:24] all I know. I believe it because I've
[1:05:27] heard it him explain it so out of the
[1:05:30] Bible that it WAS BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF
[1:05:33] DOUBT TO ME. BUT SEE, better let the
[1:05:36] leoty speak to the pastor about that and
[1:05:39] the pastor be sure HE KNOWS HOW TO
[1:05:41] answer it too.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so so we all have
[1:05:46] our place, but yet that does not
[1:05:49] diminish the importance of our part in
[1:05:54] the gospel.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; If if that makes sense to you,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; THE GOSPEL IS TO be lived.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This is why Jesus
[1:06:06] would say in Matthew 5:16, "Let let your
[1:06:10] light so shine before men,
[1:06:14] that they may see your good works and
[1:06:17] glorify your father which is in heaven."
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? THAT'S PART OF THE GOSPEL.
[1:06:29] YOUR LIGHT THAT'S SHINING. THAT'S THE
[1:06:32] SERMON THAT YOU'RE PREACHING.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE PULPIT.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A PULPIT EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE AT WORK, YOU'VE [screaming]
[1:06:41] GOT A PULPIT. YOU'RE PREACHING BEHIND
[1:06:43] YOUR PULPIT AND THAT'S YOUR LIFE.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:49] [cough]
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon says there's many
[1:06:52] people won't take time to read the
[1:06:54] Bible, but they'll read you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. You are [snorts] a written
[1:06:57] epistle of God. A real true bornagain
[1:07:01] Christian is the word expressing again.
[1:07:04] See, say that again. You are a written
[1:07:07] epistle of God. A real true bornagain
[1:07:11] Christian is the word expressed again
[1:07:15] because your written epistles of God
[1:07:18] read of all men.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; You think of it. Now, I'm just preaching
[1:07:23] to a a a a
[1:07:27] certain group of people here this
[1:07:28] morning, but when you go out them doors,
[1:07:31] your life, you're preaching to MANY
[1:07:34] PEOPLE,
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PREACHING TO ATHEISTS. YOU'RE
[1:07:39] PREACHING TO uh uh UH UNGODLY PEOPLE,
[1:07:43] BUT YOUR LIFE IS THE SERMON, BUT YOU'RE
[1:07:46] PREACHING to elect out there just as
[1:07:49] much. That's right. that elect COULD BE
[1:07:51] SO UNGODLY AND SO ROTTEN AND AND AND
[1:07:55] BOUND BY SIN AND BUT YET YOU'RE
[1:07:58] PREACHING TO THAT INDIVIDUAL BY your
[1:08:00] life.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:05] [snorts] And so
[1:08:08] uh he says there there there's um
[1:08:12] what type of a person
[1:08:15] should we be
[1:08:17] [snorts] if we know that our lives
[1:08:21] is an open living Bible to the
[1:08:23] unbeliever
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; to express God in our own life. Say that
[1:08:28] again. If we know that our life is an
[1:08:32] open Bible,
[1:08:34] open living Bible to the unbeliever to
[1:08:36] express God in our own lives, then what
[1:08:39] type of person should we be?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We We don't We don't want to feed
[1:08:46] off things that we shouldn't feed off
[1:08:48] of.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to feed off of him
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; that he could be PLEASED AND WE COULD
[1:08:54] HAVE IN CONTACT WITH HIM, RELATIONSHIP
[1:08:57] WITH HIM. YEAH, SIR.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:02] [snorts]
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Um, you know, sometime we get too busy
[1:09:05] condemning one another and talking about
[1:09:09] one another.
[1:09:10] But I want to ask you, what good is that
[1:09:12] going to do?
[1:09:14] [snorts]
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said, "Don't condemn
[1:09:18] the sinner. Have mercy on him.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Let him go ahead and smoke his pipe. Let
[1:09:23] him drink his liquor. Let him have his
[1:09:25] card parties. That's his pleasure. Don't
[1:09:27] blame him.
[1:09:28] coming home and everything tired and
[1:09:30] wore out. He wants some pleasure.
[1:09:33] The thing for you to do is live such a
[1:09:38] godly life
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; that you can prove to him that the
[1:09:43] gospel holds 10,000 times more than that
[1:09:49] for him.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's good. You see why we live in
[1:09:53] lives, we got to live that life to the
[1:09:56] people is it's easy to talk.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; You take you take a a person that gets
[1:10:05] disgruntled with someone in the church
[1:10:07] or just gets gruntled with the church
[1:10:09] and before you know it, they'll [snorts]
[1:10:12] go out and it's it's the center way to
[1:10:14] do it. You know that it ain't a
[1:10:15] Christian way. It's the center way. They
[1:10:18] [snorts] go out and they start talking
[1:10:20] running their mouth about someone in the
[1:10:22] church. [snorts] And of course their
[1:10:25] their point is, I need someone to talk
[1:10:26] to. Well, ain't that funny? You got 10
[1:10:29] people to talk to, right? Talking to
[1:10:31] this one, then then then you're talking
[1:10:33] to this one, and then you're talking to
[1:10:35] this one, and then you're talking to
[1:10:36] this one, and and to me, it's selfish to
[1:10:40] do it that way. Amen. [snorts] Because a
[1:10:42] lot of it is is your own fault. you
[1:10:45] know, you you got a lot of problems in
[1:10:47] your life and instead of repenting and
[1:10:49] humbling yourself, you you're finding
[1:10:51] avenues to point fingers and and and and
[1:10:55] all these things. But what good is that
[1:10:58] to do? Let's if a person is wrong if you
[1:11:01] literally seeing that this individual is
[1:11:04] wrong with whatever
[1:11:07] then then this holds just as much as
[1:11:12] importance as it is to the as as our as
[1:11:16] it would be to the sinner that brother
[1:11:17] Brand's talking about. Won't we live
[1:11:20] such a life before the individual that
[1:11:24] you've got your issues with? Won't you
[1:11:26] live such a life before them that you
[1:11:30] can prove to them that the gospel is 10
[1:11:33] millions times stronger than their
[1:11:36] situation that they're that they're in
[1:11:39] if if they're if they're if they're in
[1:11:42] pornography live such a life before them
[1:11:46] that they can see that pornography is
[1:11:48] nothing compared to the power of the
[1:11:50] gospel. If if if they're if they're if
[1:11:54] they're hypocrites, if they're LIVING IN
[1:11:56] SUCH A A shame and and you see it, WON'T
[1:12:00] YOU JUST LIVE SUCH A LIFE BEFORE THEM
[1:12:04] THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT THE GOSPEL HAS
[1:12:07] 10,000 10 MILLION TIMES THE POWER, AMEN,
[1:12:12] TO HOLD A PERSON THAN IT would be for
[1:12:14] the lust or the the entertainments and
[1:12:17] for whatever issue. Can you say amen? IN
[1:12:20] OTHER WORDS, THE GOSPEL,
[1:12:22] YOU AIN'T CHANGING anything by running
[1:12:24] your mouth. You're not changing
[1:12:26] anything. Amen. By tearing that person
[1:12:28] down. Ain't that right? You You're not
[1:12:30] You're not tearing You're You're not
[1:12:32] changing anything. What you're doing is
[1:12:34] you're destroying the church. You're
[1:12:36] destroying that individual character.
[1:12:38] You're just ruining your OWN SELF
[1:12:41] BECAUSE GOD ain't going to put up with
[1:12:43] that. God doesn't want none of that. Can
[1:12:45] you say amen? See, and and and so THEN
[1:12:48] THEN LET'S GET BACK TO THE [screaming]
[1:12:50] GOSPEL. WE WE AS BELIEVERS, we as
[1:12:53] Christians, amen, should understand and
[1:12:56] HAVE THE THE FUNDAMENTAL REVELATION THAT
[1:13:00] IT'S THE GOSPEL THAT HOLDS. IT'S THE
[1:13:02] GOSPEL THAT DELIVERS. IT'S THE GOSPEL
[1:13:04] THAT SETS FREE. IT'S THE GOSPEL. CAN YOU
[1:13:07] SAY AMEN? AMEN. IT ISN'T JUST WHAT I DO.
[1:13:11] IT ISN'T. I WE CAN TRY TO FIX THINGS,
[1:13:14] BUT LET THE GOSPEL FIX IT. [snorts]
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; It's the gospel.
[1:13:22] We're told to go preach the gospel.
[1:13:24] We're told to live the gospel. Can you
[1:13:26] say amen?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But notice Brother Bram says the very
[1:13:32] message of the gospel itself, now this
[1:13:34] is the message of the gospel. All right.
[1:13:36] Amen. The very message of the gospel
[1:13:38] itself is to prove to the people that he
[1:13:42] is risen.
[1:13:43] [snorts]
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The very message of
[1:13:47] the gospel is to prove to the people he
[1:13:50] is risen. So when your sermon when
[1:13:53] you're living a sermon and you're and
[1:13:55] that's your pulpit, that's what you're
[1:13:57] living is the gospel. You're you're
[1:13:58] living that word out. Well then then
[1:14:01] you're showing to the people that he is
[1:14:04] risen. when when when when we're
[1:14:06] preaching the gospel, the message of the
[1:14:09] gospel is he's alive. Can you say amen?
[1:14:12] Amen. HE'S ALIVE. [screaming] WE DON'T
[1:14:14] WANT TO GO TO A CHURCH THAT DON'T that
[1:14:16] and and never experiencing the risen
[1:14:19] savior. NEVER UNDERSTANDING THAT GOD IS
[1:14:23] ALIVE AND WELL.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; OH, I hope you understand.
[1:14:27] [snorts]
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the very message of the gospel
[1:14:30] itself is to prove to the people that he
[1:14:32] is risen. Go tell my disciples that I am
[1:14:35] risen from the dead and I'll meet with
[1:14:37] him to confirm this to them. Can you say
[1:14:40] amen?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; So Christ isn't dead. He's alive. How
[1:14:43] many believes that?
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He's not a tradition.
[1:14:48] He's he's not a theory. He's not a god
[1:14:51] of history. As we have witnessed, we
[1:14:55] have found out that he is the same in
[1:14:57] every detail. He's the same in every
[1:15:01] detail that he was back then. Same in
[1:15:04] attitude, same in power, same in
[1:15:06] authority, same in action, same in
[1:15:10] thought, at every detail. And as the
[1:15:13] prophet said, we are beneficiaries
[1:15:16] of his life.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We are beneficiaries
[1:15:24] of his life. See, in other words, his
[1:15:28] life, we're not just talking about a a
[1:15:31] Jesus Christ the 2,000 years ago, BUT
[1:15:34] HIS LIFE HAS COME UPON US.
[1:15:38] NOW, we are to prove to the world he is
[1:15:43] living in us.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? WE'RE NOT POINTING
[1:15:49] THEM TO SOME SPIRIT OUT THERE, SOMETHING
[1:15:51] UNKNOWN, AND THEN WE JUST GO BY FEELINGS
[1:15:54] AND and
[1:15:56] Oh, I feel that, you know, and you know,
[1:15:58] all that. No, he's a living reality IN
[1:16:00] ME.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL TO
[1:16:04] PROVE TO THE PEOPLE he's living.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And if you know the scriptures, you know
[1:16:12] that God has a body.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So, we are to prove that his life is in
[1:16:18] us.
[1:16:20] See the prophet says he was the Messiah
[1:16:22] because he was anointed with the
[1:16:24] fullness of God. Then we everybody say
[1:16:27] me.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; WE are anointed too
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; with the same spirit.
[1:16:35] [snorts]
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; So Romans 8:11 says, "But if the spirit
[1:16:38] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:16:40] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:16:42] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:16:44] your mortal bodies."
[1:16:47] SO, WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT A
[1:16:48] SPIRIT OUT THERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A
[1:16:51] SPIRIT THAT HAS COME IN US AND
[1:16:53] [screaming] QUICKENED OUR mortal bodies.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; To quicken means to make alive, right?
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; So, but notice if you're quickened,
[1:17:06] you're not quickened or you are
[1:17:09] quickened by another man's life.
[1:17:12] You're not quickened by your life. You
[1:17:14] were born of your natural birth. So you
[1:17:17] you come into church, you come into the
[1:17:20] altar, you come whatever because you've
[1:17:22] already have a life in you.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; That's your life. But then to be
[1:17:26] quickened,
[1:17:28] another man's life came inside of you.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; See, if if a life of a dead man is
[1:17:35] projected in you, let's just say, you
[1:17:37] know, I die today
[1:17:40] and and you see my body, my corpse,
[1:17:44] it ain't moving, ain't nothing. You say,
[1:17:46] "Oh, he's dead."
[1:17:48] Well, cuz the body ain't there or the
[1:17:50] ain't in the I ain't in my body.
[1:17:53] [snorts] But what if I were to come
[1:17:57] into um I don't know, what if I were to
[1:18:01] come into brother Bill?
[1:18:04] What if I were to come into your body?
[1:18:07] And then I was able to possess and have
[1:18:10] preeminence in that body over his life.
[1:18:13] My life, my spirit was to gain
[1:18:16] preeminence over his.
[1:18:18] Then brother Bill, you would no longer
[1:18:20] be you.
[1:18:22] I would be you. I would reflect myself.
[1:18:25] What I reflected in that body now I
[1:18:28] would refct you.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:32] So you'd be more talkative.
[1:18:39] You'd be more honory. [laughter]
[1:18:43] You'd be coming behind the pulpit
[1:18:45] preaching
[1:18:47] because my life is in you having
[1:18:50] preeminence in your body. Whatever I am
[1:18:53] was in this body, now it's in you.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:58] So it's the same person just in a
[1:19:02] different body. Yes, sir.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:07] So then if if the spirit of God
[1:19:11] literally lives in us and it is a
[1:19:14] literal happening,
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; the literal life of God dwelling in that
[1:19:19] individual.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; How many's got the life of God living in
[1:19:22] you?
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; That life of God living in you, then
[1:19:27] what does it do? If he can gain
[1:19:29] preeminence in us,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; if he can gain preeminence,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; then he lives himself in us.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Then the same Jesus that was back there
[1:19:42] is living today.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the gospel is to prove that
[1:19:49] he lives.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Not living in a story. NOT KEEPING HIM
[1:19:54] ALIVE like they say. We're going to
[1:19:56] keep, you know, uh, uh, Kirk, is that
[1:19:58] his name? Kirk, that just got
[1:19:59] assassinated.
[1:20:01] Keep him alive, you know. Well, they can
[1:20:04] only keep him alive through stories and
[1:20:06] and in the past and keep reminding the
[1:20:08] people and showing videos and all of
[1:20:11] that of of of Kirk and and and and these
[1:20:14] things. See, but that's not what we're
[1:20:17] doing here today. We're not keeping
[1:20:18] Jesus alive by Christmas pageantss and
[1:20:21] and Christmas plays and nativity scenes
[1:20:23] and and and Easter uh plays and and all
[1:20:27] of that. Ain't I ain't talking against
[1:20:29] all that, but that's not how we keep him
[1:20:31] alive.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; WE'RE KEEPING HIM ALIVE BECAUSE HE'S IN
[1:20:35] US.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; WE'RE PROVING TO THE WORLD HE'S ALIVE
[1:20:40] BECAUSE HE'S IN me
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; and he's able to have the preeminence.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's the gospel.
[1:20:47] Can you say amen?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27, to whom God would make
[1:20:52] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:20:54] this mystery among the Gentiles, which
[1:20:57] is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; So, he is the quickening power. In John
[1:21:02] 6:63, Jesus said, "It is the spirit that
[1:21:06] quickenth."
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So, no wonder Jesus said in Matthew
[1:21:11] 21:21,
[1:21:13] "Verily I say unto you, if you have
[1:21:15] faith and doubt not, you shall not only
[1:21:17] do this which is done to the fig tree,
[1:21:19] but also if you shall say to this
[1:21:21] mountain, be thou removed and be thou
[1:21:25] cast into the sea, it shall be done, and
[1:21:28] all things whatsoever you shall ask in
[1:21:30] prayer believing, you shall receive."
[1:21:32] Can you say amen? Why? Because it's no
[1:21:34] longer you.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; It's it's Christ in you.
[1:21:38] The same voice that spoke in that body
[1:21:41] and spoke to that tree is the same voice
[1:21:43] in you.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; It's the power. I I I pray that uh I'm
[1:21:51] not being too scattered uh this morning.
[1:21:55] [snorts]
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; We find that the church is to carry on
[1:21:58] the same life that Christ lived.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the church is the body
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; of Christ on earth today.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the essence of the gospel.
[1:22:17] Same character, same power, same
[1:22:19] authority, same everything. Well, what
[1:22:21] was Jesus manifested for? The prophet
[1:22:23] said to show God. That's what Jesus was
[1:22:26] manifested for is to show God. He was
[1:22:29] God. Ain't that right? He was the
[1:22:32] visible image of the invisible God. And
[1:22:35] the PROPHET SAYS THROUGH THAT purpose he
[1:22:38] achieved a church that he the fullness
[1:22:41] of God might bring to pass every
[1:22:43] promised word of God in these last days
[1:22:46] when he gets the preeminences
[1:22:49] preeminence in the church the position
[1:22:52] his place. Can you say amen?
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; His place in the church. He says Jesus
[1:22:58] was so perfectly born for the day until
[1:23:01] God expressed every move that he made.
[1:23:03] He was God's revelation.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; God revealed.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; God was able to express every move or
[1:23:13] God was able to be expressed in every
[1:23:15] move Christ made. See, now Jesus knew
[1:23:18] who he was. And the prophet says, "Now
[1:23:21] he's sanctified with the spirit and
[1:23:23] blood a church that he might make every
[1:23:28] promise in this last day be revealed."
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; So this was God's purpose. First of all,
[1:23:37] that he might be revealed in Christ. Be
[1:23:40] expressed in Christ. Secondly, that he
[1:23:44] might be revealed in his church.
[1:23:47] Expressed through the church. Can you
[1:23:49] say amen? God expressed himself in
[1:23:51] Christ. NOW GOD EXPRESSING HIMSELF in
[1:23:54] the church. All that God is, he poured
[1:23:57] into Christ. And all that Christ is has
[1:24:00] BEEN POURED INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so then you know
[1:24:06] if if a man doesn't have this experience
[1:24:08] of Christ being in him,
[1:24:11] then whether whether he's preaching a
[1:24:14] sermon behind a a pulpit or in even in
[1:24:17] his own life, then his proclamation of
[1:24:20] the gospel is only theoretically.
[1:24:24] It the gospel becomes just a theoretic
[1:24:27] thing. If a man really doesn't have that
[1:24:30] Christ in you, that that really
[1:24:32] substance, that quickening power within
[1:24:35] them, then the gospel is a theory. It's
[1:24:37] theoretically uh declared. See, and and
[1:24:41] so then all he can do is talk about the
[1:24:43] resurrection of Christ in a theoretical
[1:24:46] way. You you understand what theoretical
[1:24:49] it's it's it's saying it's not really
[1:24:53] it's not the reality of it. we're just
[1:24:55] going to pretend like it is or we we're
[1:24:57] just going to give a scenario but but
[1:25:00] it's not really that you you know what I
[1:25:02] mean? And and so uh uh so so when he
[1:25:05] talking about the resurrection instead
[1:25:07] of being able to prove that resurrection
[1:25:09] he's only talking about it as a theory
[1:25:12] as as theoretical it you know and and so
[1:25:15] he can only proclaim that Jesus Christ
[1:25:17] is the same yesterday, today and
[1:25:19] forever. He has no proof of that because
[1:25:21] Christ ain't in him. Amen. He has no
[1:25:24] proof. SO HIS HIS SERMON BECOMES
[1:25:28] theoretically can you say amen?
[1:25:30] Theoretically is according to an idea or
[1:25:34] assumed set of facts or principles.
[1:25:37] Nothing is based on evidence or
[1:25:40] experience. So he can only present the
[1:25:43] word in a way of theory, hypothetical,
[1:25:47] speculative.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Because he HAS NO
[1:25:52] EXPERIENCE OF WHAT he is saying. So many
[1:25:55] uh uh men are getting behind pullpits
[1:25:58] and and THEY'RE PRESENTING THE GOSPEL IN
[1:26:01] A WAY OF THEORY. IT'S JUST SPECULATIVE.
[1:26:04] IT'S NO EVIDENCE. HELLO.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; NO EVIDENCE. I AIN'T GOT EVIDENCE. I'D
[1:26:10] HAVE to take you all the way to, you
[1:26:11] know, uh to to uh um uh Israel to have
[1:26:16] some kind of a proof, you know, a
[1:26:19] physical proof. But I ain't got time TO
[1:26:21] TAKE YOU. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED
[1:26:23] TO DO. WE'RE NOT TO TAKE EVERYBODY TO
[1:26:24] ISRAEL. WE'RE JUST TO PREACH THE GOSPEL.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; AND TO PROVE BY THE GOSPEL THAT IT'S
[1:26:32] ALIVE AND WELL.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; So I'm not to preach in a theoretical.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not to live my life in a
[1:26:40] theoretical.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:45] [snorts and clears throat]
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I pray God just opens that up to you.
[1:26:52] But we are ambassadors of Christ. How
[1:26:54] many believes that?
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; We are ambassadors. So, brother Brandham
[1:26:59] says, "Now listen, I think this is a
[1:27:00] powerful statement. If we come
[1:27:03] representing his ministry powerfully
[1:27:07] and the death of the Lord Jesus, then
[1:27:10] all heaven is behind the word."
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? IF YOU COME
[1:27:16] REPRESENTING JESUS, your sermon that
[1:27:20] you're LIVING AND THE SERMONS THAT US
[1:27:22] MEN ARE PREACHING behind the pulpits, if
[1:27:25] we're preaching it in a powerful way, in
[1:27:28] a in an by an experience,
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; by conviction,
[1:27:34] then all heaven is behind it,
[1:27:41] [snorts]
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; how did they know that he was the Christ
[1:27:45] because he proved what he talked about.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; How do we know that we are beneficiaries
[1:27:51] of his resurrection? Because he proves
[1:27:55] he proves
[1:27:57] what he has talked about.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Signs and wonders are God's way of
[1:28:02] proving himself.
[1:28:05] Amen. That's what a prophet said.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; He proved that the children of Israel
[1:28:10] were his people by vindicating them with
[1:28:13] signs and wonders.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; See, so signs and wonders goes with the
[1:28:19] gospel.
[1:28:21] The word living goes with the gospel.
[1:28:23] It's part of the gospel.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; There was Moab. Moab uh a nation and and
[1:28:31] they had a prophet just like Israel had
[1:28:33] a prophet. They were as religious as
[1:28:35] Israel was religious. They had the same
[1:28:37] sacrifices as Israel. They had the same
[1:28:39] altars as Israel. They served the same
[1:28:42] God as Israel. But God vindicated ISRAEL
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; WITH SIGNS and wonders.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? GOD VINDICATED THEM.
[1:28:53] GOD KEPT [screaming] THEM. GOD PROTECTED
[1:28:56] THEM.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And it's just like today. There's the
[1:29:02] spiritual church. There's the formal
[1:29:03] church. both fundamentally teaching the
[1:29:05] Bible, serving the same God, believing
[1:29:07] in the same fundamental things of the
[1:29:09] Bible. But the prophet said, "But God
[1:29:12] proved he was with Israel by signs and
[1:29:14] wonders and supernatural." They had the
[1:29:18] pillar of fire over them. They had the
[1:29:20] divine healing among them. They had the
[1:29:22] shout of the king in the camp. Can you
[1:29:24] say amen? They screamed and act like
[1:29:27] maniacs. They danced in the spirit. They
[1:29:29] done signs and wonders. They healed the
[1:29:31] sick. THEY HAD THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:29:33] following him. See, AND GOD WAS SAYING,
[1:29:35] "THIS IS MY ELECTION."
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; THROUGH SIGNS AND WONDERS AND
[1:29:41] VINDICATION OF THE SUPERNATURAL, GOD WAS
[1:29:43] SELLING THE P THE WORLD. [screaming]
[1:29:45] THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE PROOF OF.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S MINE ELECT.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what the gospel
[1:29:53] means to us is when it's confirmed by
[1:29:56] signs and wonders.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my. May we depend upon the
[1:30:00] supernatural. May we believe with all of
[1:30:03] our HEART THAT THE SUPERNATURAL IS WITH
[1:30:05] US AND FOLLOWING US TO WHERE WE DON'T
[1:30:08] have to do it. WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT
[1:30:10] OUR OWN BATTLES. LET GOD FIGHT YOUR
[1:30:12] BATTLES.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; LET GOD [screaming] DO IT. LET GOD
[1:30:14] ANSWER BY FIRE.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; HE'LL do it. I promise you
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; he'll do it. [snorts]
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Because we're preaching the gospel.
[1:30:27] Now, we don't follow signs and wonders.
[1:30:31] That's not what the Bible says. We are
[1:30:32] not to follow signs and wonders. Signs
[1:30:34] and wonders follow the believer.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, all we're
[1:30:38] doing is believing. And signs and
[1:30:40] wonders are following.
[1:30:43] Now, there is nothing more powerful than
[1:30:45] the gospel.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Nothing more powerful than the gospel.
[1:30:53] Amen. [snorts]
[1:30:54] But power apart from the word of God
[1:30:57] isn't of God.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Say that again. Power apart from the
[1:31:03] word of God isn't of God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My word is spirit and
[1:31:08] life."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. The words that I say unto you,
[1:31:12] they're spirit and life. So then the
[1:31:15] word, the prophet said, is the conductor
[1:31:17] of the spirit of God. The word is the
[1:31:21] conductor. See, the spirit follows the
[1:31:24] word and it makes the word to live.
[1:31:27] Ain't that right?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This is why we should never be in a
[1:31:32] hurry to get out of services.
[1:31:36] Now, I understand we're all human and
[1:31:38] and in in these things. And but I I do
[1:31:41] think that sometimes we get in in in a
[1:31:44] schedule. We and we put God on our
[1:31:47] schedule.
[1:31:49] We we think that well, you know, our
[1:31:52] whole life is based on schedule. We get
[1:31:55] up at a certain time. We've got certain
[1:31:57] things to meet and and do and we got to
[1:32:00] do this all in a certain day and and all
[1:32:02] that. And then when we come to church,
[1:32:04] we've got we're putting everything on
[1:32:06] schedule. You know, we want this done
[1:32:08] and we want this done. I got to go do
[1:32:10] stuff. So, let's go. Let's kind of get
[1:32:11] to moving. And what we don't realize is
[1:32:15] the gospel is the greatest thing that
[1:32:19] you could ever have in your life
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; because in that is power.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; So the word goes forth and then the
[1:32:28] spirit follows the word
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; and it begins to move and it begins to
[1:32:34] work. And you know I've got children
[1:32:36] that need the Holy Ghost. You you
[1:32:38] parents have children that need the Holy
[1:32:41] Ghost. there. There's maybe some that
[1:32:43] need just a word from the Lord just or
[1:32:45] maybe a refreshing from God and and a
[1:32:49] renewing or maybe there's problems and
[1:32:52] situations that need to be fixed and and
[1:32:55] all these things. See, and and you know,
[1:32:57] I I love the way that uh uh brother Ray
[1:33:00] Ericson, you know, established his
[1:33:03] church, taught his church, and that was,
[1:33:05] you know, they'd have, you know, they
[1:33:07] sung their songs and and and and had the
[1:33:09] word and all that, but then when they
[1:33:11] dismissed, the entire congregation just
[1:33:13] sits down instead of rushing out the
[1:33:16] doors, they all just sit down and they
[1:33:19] just begin to sing and they're just
[1:33:20] waiting upon God. And you know uh uh uh
[1:33:24] and and a lot of time maybe not every
[1:33:27] time but a lot of times there's people
[1:33:29] start to come to the an altar and maybe
[1:33:31] some getting saved and problems getting
[1:33:35] fixed and things like that and then
[1:33:37] gradually one you know they just start
[1:33:39] drifting out you know slowly just
[1:33:42] quietly but what what is they're waiting
[1:33:45] he's waiting on the spirit of God the
[1:33:47] word's gone forth and the prophets
[1:33:49] taught us that the the spirit follows
[1:33:52] the word of God. And if we would come
[1:33:54] with the expectation that hold it, I'm
[1:33:57] not hearing the word of a president.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; He's got power and he thinks he's got a
[1:34:03] lot of power, but not not not powerful
[1:34:06] enough for the word of God. His word
[1:34:08] doesn't match the word.
[1:34:10] And yet we come in to pre UNDERSTANDING
[1:34:14] THAT GOD has ordained MEN TO PREACH THE
[1:34:18] GOSPEL AND AND AND and the signs and
[1:34:22] wonders ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THIS. AND IF
[1:34:25] WE COME WITH THE EXPECTATION, I DON'T
[1:34:27] CARE WHAT YOU HAVE need of. IF YOU JUST
[1:34:31] SETTLE DOWN
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; AND AFTER THE WORD, ENTERTAIN THE WORD
[1:34:36] WITH YOUR PRAISE.
[1:34:39] ENTERTAIN THE WORD. DON'T LET
[1:34:41] [screaming] THE DEVIL GET YOU IN A
[1:34:42] HURRY.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; DON'T PUT GOD ON A TIME CLOCK CUZ GOD
[1:34:46] WILL NEVER MEET YOUR TIME.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to put God on your
[1:34:51] timing.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; As we all know that God works in his own
[1:34:55] timing.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES THAT GOD WILL HEAL
[1:34:58] INSTANTLY AND THEN THERE'S OTHER TIMES
[1:34:59] THAT GOD WILL wait for months and years
[1:35:02] then all of a sudden come down and heal.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; God does it in his own timing. So don't
[1:35:08] ever TRY TO BOX GOD IN.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; What I am saying is wait upon the Lord.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Wait upon him because we have this we're
[1:35:18] conscience and we have this belief and
[1:35:20] knowing that the spirit follows the word
[1:35:24] of God.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; [cough and snorts]
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And and and [clears throat] so the
[1:35:33] gospel is not just word, but it's the
[1:35:36] gospel. The gospel is the word being
[1:35:38] made manifest. The word made manifest.
[1:35:41] Ain't that right?
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; See, when the word is spoken, then it is
[1:35:45] manifest as it was in the beginning. God
[1:35:48] said, "Let there be light."
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And then light appeared.
[1:35:57] Why? That's the gospel. God was showing
[1:36:00] us how his word works. The word goes
[1:36:03] forth. The spirit follows the word. Can
[1:36:06] you say amen?
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; And and and I hope I'm making some sense
[1:36:11] to you, but there's times that you you
[1:36:15] some of you got your children that are
[1:36:16] wewarded and and all that. Maybe you
[1:36:20] don't know what to do, but you you
[1:36:21] understand you living the gospel.
[1:36:24] your your sermon being preached,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; your your sermon proving to them. They
[1:36:31] may not say nothing to you. They may not
[1:36:33] act anything and they may act contrary,
[1:36:36] but you're proving to them that that
[1:36:39] that Christ is risen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; You're proving to them that you've got
[1:36:43] something that'll hold them. Amen. And
[1:36:46] and that something that you've got is
[1:36:49] more powerful. is millions times more
[1:36:51] powerful than what they're looking to to
[1:36:54] hold them.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; You're proving that that word is being
[1:36:58] min ministered unto them. THEY MAY NOT
[1:37:00] BE COMING TO A CHURCH. THEY MAY NOT HEAR
[1:37:02] A PREACHER, BUT YOU'RE THAT PREACHER.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Your life and church, you've got to live
[1:37:09] with with with a a confidence that the
[1:37:12] spirit of God follows that word. The
[1:37:14] spirit of God follows that word. I'm not
[1:37:16] doing this in vain. the spirit of God.
[1:37:18] If that word is in in me, if that's the
[1:37:21] voice, it ain't just a voice, literal
[1:37:23] voice. It is the word of God being
[1:37:26] lived, the prophet said is a voice.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And if that voice is being proclaimed by
[1:37:30] your life, then that voice has power.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; It's the gospel.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord? Amen.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; So, the word was spoken by God himself,
[1:37:47] and he believed his own word, and it
[1:37:49] came to pass.
[1:37:51] And I won't keep you much longer,
[1:37:54] [snorts]
[1:37:54] but Mark 16:20.
[1:37:58] And they went forth and preached
[1:37:59] everywhere, the Lord working with them,
[1:38:02] and confirming the word with signs
[1:38:05] following.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody say, "Signs
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; follow the word.
[1:38:12] Salvation follows the word.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Healing follows the word. Deliverance
[1:38:18] follows the word. Victory follows the
[1:38:21] word. It all follows the word. The word
[1:38:24] goes forth and then victory comes after.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Life comes after.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Demons are cast out after. Can you say
[1:38:34] amen? Why? There's power in that word.
[1:38:36] Satan can't stand the word. He cannot
[1:38:38] withstand that word. His power is broken
[1:38:41] when the word comes forth. And that's
[1:38:42] why Satan hates you so much.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; He is trying to break you down. He's
[1:38:47] trying to destroy you. Because the more
[1:38:49] you become the word and you're living
[1:38:52] that word out and your sermon is being
[1:38:54] lived out, Satan is doing everything to
[1:38:56] rock you to destroy you. Amen. Because
[1:38:59] there's power.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that's what shakes the
[1:39:05] the devil. That's the thunder that
[1:39:08] shakes the devil.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; So signs follow the word. Remember when
[1:39:13] Elijah went to the widow of Zerapath,
[1:39:18] first Kings 17 and 13,
[1:39:22] this woman was in dire need u uh uh
[1:39:27] drought and she was in bad trouble
[1:39:31] and she had gotten to the place and
[1:39:33] brother Brandham, you know, Brother Bram
[1:39:35] could describe a scene very well, but
[1:39:39] she'd [snorts] hear her son crying
[1:39:43] and you know things like that and she
[1:39:46] had tried to console him and and all
[1:39:48] that but she was faithful to the Lord
[1:39:50] and [snorts]
[1:39:51] then God sent a prophet down her way and
[1:39:56] Elijah said unto her fear not go and do
[1:39:59] as thou hast said but make me therefore
[1:40:02] a little cake first [snorts]
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; see and bring it unto me and after make
[1:40:07] it for thee and thy son
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; for thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
[1:40:14] the barrel of meal shall not waste,
[1:40:17] neither shall the crus of oil fail until
[1:40:20] the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon
[1:40:22] the earth. And she went and did
[1:40:24] according to the saying of Elijah, and
[1:40:26] she and he and her house did eat many
[1:40:29] days, and the barrel of meal wasted not,
[1:40:32] neither did the crus of oil fail
[1:40:35] according to the word of the Lord which
[1:40:36] he spake by Elijah. Can you say amen?
[1:40:41] See, so when she did as the word told
[1:40:43] her, then the miracle came.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Then the proper sign as the prophet
[1:40:48] said, the proper sign came. See, so he
[1:40:52] says, "Come to the word first, then
[1:40:54] watch the miracle." Can you say amen?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; See? So, so why is the preaching of the
[1:41:00] gospel so important? Because the word
[1:41:02] comes first and then the miracle comes.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:41:09] Now,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; whatever you have need of this morning,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; my God is able to give it to you.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; And we should be as people, we want to
[1:41:20] be a people very sensitive to the spirit
[1:41:22] of God.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; We want to take the services of
[1:41:26] importance. I know it can become
[1:41:28] tradition. It can become ritual just
[1:41:31] Wednesdays, Sundays, and we're doing our
[1:41:33] thing. But never let it get to that
[1:41:35] place
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; because the word has power
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; to meet your need.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't care how what what
[1:41:44] situation you're in. I don't care what
[1:41:47] situation it is.
[1:41:50] The word of God is able to meet your
[1:41:52] need.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; If you can just believe, that's the
[1:42:00] that's the thing. Just believe. A amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the word of God is uh
[1:42:09] it's been set aside
[1:42:13] today.
[1:42:15] What is the word?
[1:42:17] Jesus said, "Thy word is truth."
[1:42:21] Thy word is truth. So truth is part of
[1:42:24] the gospel. Thy word is truth. And
[1:42:26] notice John 8:32 Jesus said, "And you
[1:42:29] shall know the truth, the word. You
[1:42:33] shall know the word,
[1:42:35] and the word, the truth shall make you
[1:42:38] free."
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And Peter said in one place that the
[1:42:44] people were established in present
[1:42:47] truth.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Which I think that something to us in
[1:42:51] this day. But notice now the the effect
[1:42:55] of the word. Ephesians 1:13.
[1:42:58] In whom, Paul says, in whom you also
[1:43:00] trusted after, everybody say after.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; That you heard the word of truth. The
[1:43:06] gospel of your salvation, in whom also
[1:43:11] after you believed, after you heard the
[1:43:14] word of truth, you believed. After you
[1:43:16] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[1:43:20] Spirit of promise. See what the
[1:43:22] preaching of the word done?
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It sealed them. They believed it. It was
[1:43:27] the word of truth. They believed in that
[1:43:29] word of truth and they were sealed.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; The gospel has been misrepresented so
[1:43:39] much today to where people don't know
[1:43:41] what the gospel is anymore. And to many,
[1:43:44] the gospel is just about singing and
[1:43:47] music. We've got, you know, churches
[1:43:51] today that are
[1:43:53] many, you know, are are leaning to
[1:43:56] professional singing groups to, you
[1:43:58] know, asking them to come in and
[1:44:01] take the services.
[1:44:03] And they're holding concerts, you know,
[1:44:05] on on service times. And then then
[1:44:09] comedians are becoming a popular thing
[1:44:12] in service
[1:44:14] where they're taking the Sunday morning
[1:44:16] service and oh they minister a little
[1:44:19] word here and there and in between the
[1:44:22] jokes and the comedy.
[1:44:25] Live animals are being brought into the
[1:44:28] church for illustrations and to help
[1:44:33] keep the people's attention. You got
[1:44:35] your professional choirs and
[1:44:37] professional musicians paid and coming
[1:44:40] into the church to entertain.
[1:44:43] But none of that church is going to
[1:44:45] produce a bride crop.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; None of that's going to produce a bride
[1:44:49] crop as we see.
[1:44:54] We we've I mean as as as they're
[1:44:58] bringing these things in, you know,
[1:45:00] they're letting people are getting more
[1:45:02] wordly.
[1:45:04] uh to where homosexuals, lesbians, and
[1:45:08] transgenders are coming into the church,
[1:45:11] having prominent place in the church.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that sad?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Having prominent place in the church,
[1:45:19] adultery, people living in adultery,
[1:45:22] just sitting in the church and not
[1:45:24] feeling no guilt, no nothing. just
[1:45:27] living with each other, preachers even
[1:45:32] getting, you know, getting caught. It
[1:45:34] It's become a rat mess, you know. It's
[1:45:37] just a But see that that that that will
[1:45:41] never make the word live. [snorts]
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; You You can't bring a comedy and and
[1:45:46] make the word live.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; The place has the church has become
[1:45:50] entertainment.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, but brother
[1:45:54] Brandham says this, "Preaching the word
[1:45:57] is the acorn."
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; So, preaching the word is the seed.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Making it live is the gospel.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; You can't have the tree without the
[1:46:09] seed.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; So, God forbid that we ever have a
[1:46:14] gathering in a church setting and then
[1:46:18] the people you leave without having a
[1:46:20] seat.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:23] I don't want you leaving without having
[1:46:25] some seed. The word seed.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; So the preaching is the seed.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And and and and I may be stretching it,
[1:46:34] but I believe it this way. If your life
[1:46:37] is the sermon and you're living the
[1:46:40] sermon according to the word and you're
[1:46:42] reflecting that word, then you're giving
[1:46:45] people a seed.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; You're giving people hope by your life.
[1:46:51] Yeah,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Because you're living a sermon.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; So they may never hear me, brother Will,
[1:46:59] to preach. They they they don't they may
[1:47:02] never they may never even read a Bible,
[1:47:05] but the prophet said, "You're the Bible
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; that they'll read."
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; So you're actually giving them a seed,
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; and they'll see hope by you. They'll see
[1:47:15] a living Christ by you. They'll see that
[1:47:18] there's something different than this
[1:47:20] world by your life.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And and that's what the gospel is.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel. Can you say amen?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[1:47:38] [snorts]
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; we never want to underestimate the value
[1:47:42] of the word of God being preached. Can
[1:47:45] you say amen?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Trust it was a help to you today
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; and something that we take home with us.
[1:48:03] And may God help us all to live that
[1:48:07] word. Amen.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; To become the word
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; and to come under expectation for the
[1:48:14] supernatural.
[1:48:16] because I just believe it. I I believe
[1:48:18] it as we've been seeing it, you know, in
[1:48:21] Sister Martha's situation. I believe
[1:48:24] we'll be seeing it in Sister Rhonda's
[1:48:26] situation.
[1:48:28] I [music] believe, you know, we're
[1:48:29] seeing it in in
[1:48:33] Shannon's situation.
[1:48:36] I just I [music] believe we're I believe
[1:48:38] we have that right to look for these
[1:48:40] things, not to be cast down. [music] And
[1:48:46] when we hear bad news or we get bad
[1:48:48] reports [music] or bad whatever. No,
[1:48:50] that's not the gospel. We are We've got
[1:48:52] the gospel.
[1:48:55] We've got the word of God
[1:48:57] and we hear the word [music] of truth.
[1:48:59] Can you say amen?
[1:49:01] Amen.
[1:49:03] What song
[1:49:07] still moves [singing]
[1:49:10] in the heart of believers?
[1:49:13] [singing and music]
[1:49:14] God still moves.
[1:49:18] He does not [music and singing] sleep,
[1:49:23] nor does he slumber.
[1:49:27] [music]
[1:49:28] God still moves.
[1:49:32] God still moves. [music]
[1:49:35] Oh, God still moves.
[1:49:41] God still moves.
[1:49:44] [music]
[1:49:45] In the heart
