certainly is true there's none like him certainly appreciate the privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's good to be a Christian thank you for the sunshine thank you for the rain thank you for God's grace thank you musicians amen hallelujah I was just listening to a couple of the words of sister Lisa's song and only Jesus can satisfy we know that if you want to be turn to the Book of Exodus we're going to read three or four places Exodus and then acts and then Matthew but I'll give you the scripture as we go um but I just was thinking the word one of the verses She said if you're looking for life nothing only satisfies but the Lord Jesus do you realize that now I'm going to I was actually we were archived a brother from South Africa and he preached over two and a half about two and a half hours so I won't go that long I'm a little you can turn that down a little bit it's a little little reverberation or something anyway when you really begin to think about it why do people turn to drugs why do people turn to alcohol why people turn to any of the illicit things any of the evil things there's only one thing that I'll satisfy and that's Christ and what it is they they've actually are looking for the meaning of life everything that we do our job our focus our home our spouse everything that we do is has a meaning and people searching for meaning of life only God can satisfy the understanding of the meaning for life and it's such Le oosa when when there is no light uh Total Blackout in Le osia there's very well is actually just one way you know to find light and that's through the message of the hour but people are searching for light they're searching for not searching for light they're searching for the meaning of life in all aspects of the meaning of life but they can't find it and there's only one thing that'll satisfy and that's Christ only one thing so that's a tremendous Revelation to realize that only Christ can truly satisfy no nothing else nothing else praise the Lord all right well let's start with uh ma with Exodus chapter 13 verse 20- 22 and I hopefully they can know we not going to be able to put anything on the screen today are we okay that's fine I just we'll just let you run through your Bibles then but we're actually just going to read three or four places here just kind of a background we won't be able to uh just for kind of a flow of what direction I'm going in Exodus 13:20 it says 13 20-22 and they took their journey through sukov and encamped in etham in the edge of the Wilderness and the Lord Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night verse 22 and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people now that verse is yet true today amen for 40 years in the wilderness they had the pillar of fire the pillar of cloud and it was to lead them lead them by that light same thing today also in Acts 9 verse 1-5 these are all familiar I'll read Safe time while you're looking and Saul y breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord he went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues and if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound into Jerusalem and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and so there shine around him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest is hard it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks so we already see a focus Old Testament New Testament Matthew 3:11 speaking of John the Baptist speaking he said I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall bapt baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire and we'll look at one other scripture Luke 4 And1 this scripture really is hard to really understand we know Jesus was 100% God and Jesus was 100% man G Luke 4:1 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness he just got baptized and he just got filled with the Holy Ghost it's hard to imagine that the Lord Jesus anytime that he wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost because he was God the fullness of the godhead bodily but the man part of him Christ the man Christ is the anointed but the man he's 100% man he's 100% God but he had to be baptized to fulfill all righteous and he had to be filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible says right clear there and I'll show you the quotes in a little while so let's just pray if we could and see what the Lord will help us this morning Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the reading of the word we thank you Lord that we can stand before for your redeem the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus we're happy to be part of this end time bride Under the Umbrella of a word message we lord we're so thankful for that pray that we take these thoughts these scriptures these things you've laid Upon My Heart Lord and may it be a blessing to the people may we uh not only just be able to read but Lord you give sense to the reading of the word as the scribes will stand up and read for many hours during the day but Lord you give the sense to the reading of the word the revelation we would say in our day give us understanding we thank you for this time bless all that's done and said and we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and everybody says amen God bless you you can be seated really appreciated the U the sermons that well all of them for that matter but especially last weekend brother Sean preaching on uh he talked about that power you know when the the power we'd seen that cloud with that CL the angel would come in power and with power and great glory and they did a really tremendous job I really appreciate Wednesday night just really good we we really appreciate brother sha appreciate ministers that really love this message and preach the message we just preach the message that's what it's all about just preach the message now my subject this morning I'm going to title this meeting that Pillar of Fire and I got the quotes we all have to meet that Pillar of Fire but it may not be just exactly what we might think meeting the pillar of fire but it is meeting that pill of fire now we know that the the the whole message is all about the word it's a word bride it's a word birth it's your word born in the beginning was the word the word's with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and Christ is that word so we know the whole vocabulary of the message is really about Christ it's and then in our Day present day truth is actually uh the word made flesh in Christ in Bride form and brother makes this statement and why is it so important we think about how important it is to to receive the Holy Ghost and not only just the Holy Ghost on our spirit realm which we'll talk about in a little bit but a word birth on our soul it's got to be a change of nature on the soul just not a temporary anointing on the spirit as was the baptism of the Holy goes down Through the Ages we'll talk about that in a minute but there's got to be a a complete transformation of that Soul listen and why brother R says here's the whole focus of the word is why brother ra said lay out say in church a book he said then there there will not be one person this is a tremendous quote there'll not be one person who will sit in the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ unless he has been living that word your prayers your fastings your repentances no matter what you present to God none of that will gain you the privilege of sitting in that Throne it will be granted only to the word Bride As The Throne of the king is shared with the queen because she is United to him so only they who are of that word and he is the word he is that word will share that Throne so if we want to be up there as Queen of Heaven with him guess what we must be that word we must live that word we must be that Living Word we must be the word made flesh that's why the the whole issue today the not issue but the whole Focus today is the bride is fleshing out that word we become him we become him and how do we follow him I'll show you brother man says also in the L Odyssey and age remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages that even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so the Ephesian age fell by turning slightly from the word until with every age continuing to turn away we have a final repudiation of the word by the World Church system that's where we are today and then it's of course it's going to finally wind up in the world Council of churches headed up by Rome and then the Beast takes over the layot of see and age ends in a blackout of the word are we there have they been there since' 63 absolutely Total Blackout no wonder God permitted brother bandam to draw a little bit of light when they drew it out on the Tabernacle wall there and it was totally blacked out but he gave him permission to draw a little bit of light just a sliver of light just for the bride otherwise there'll be no light I mean the leoty is totally blacked out there is no light the leot age leine age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling his own who will follow him by by by obedience to that word obedience to that word now let's get started we don't need an introduction just just start right in the middle let me cover some things here as we go on Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the secret of God revealed the theme of this sermon is of brother sermon in Christ the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory so now since Christ has come down Revelations 10:1 we know that he is here we have to recognize he is here in the fullness of the word not in bodily form in the fullness of the word and so then the this Mighty God is unveiled to the elect only to the elect all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was you know we think about that all that Christ was he poured into the church the bride now we believe that or we don't so if all he was was poured in us then we have to be flesh out Christ herself we have to she is him it's got to be that way I mean the masculine the feminine is taking on the masculine we're part of him he's the masculine we're the feminine we are he's the bridegroom we are the bride and we are taking on his name his nature everything but you know Satan all satan does he he only can copy and pervert what God is doing in the spiritual Satan is a of course trying to copy in the natural so why do we have all this woke stuff and she is he and he is she and and it's all just a perversion of Satan trying to copy what God's doing in the spiritual where we're really becoming him they don't even know what what gender they're of it's just it's just Satan's perverted way everything God does in the spiritual Satan tries to mimic it but only can do it in a perverted way brother bam declared in 1962 said there is an infant church but she's taken form the church is built strictly on divine revelation Matthew 16 divine revelation he said that we need to call on God a lot more than anything I suppose for revelation we need to call on him for Revelation because the church has built on Revelation uh everything that we have need of of course is in that seed but we need God to reveal uh each day of our life what you know our path to take he's our leadership now Paul never knew Jesus physically only by Revelation and all true Revelation comes from God we know that we can give you information God gives a revelation I can I can preach you a principle I can teach you a principle God has a give a re Revelation the Revelation is confirmation that it is the truth now God never knew Jesus physically now Peter knew him physically but yet he only had Revelation that come from God even though Peter walk with him fish with him everything the Revelation still had to come by God now we want to talk about Matthew 3:11 he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire now let's look at this statement for a minute every human I'm going to make a statement here and you'll understand in a minute every human has got to be con be consumed with some kind of a fire he said Matthew 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire now that's a good fire we like that we want that 3:12 said who's fan in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and and gather his wheat into the Garner but he will burn the cha burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire that's the bad fire we don't want that and then of course you got the fiery Pains of marom for the foolish virgins in the in the tribulation period there's got to be the 144,000 they have to uh all they're sealed in they receive the same gospel we sealed in but they also have to die by the fiery Pains of marom they're killed the foolish virgins are killed the Earth is purged partially purged during the tribulation period but then of course it'll be totally purged at the end of the Millennium but it all takes a purging by fire so we just have to understand so you can see the basis and the foundation of where I'm going why he said I'm going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost with fire amen the Holy Ghost Fire not the unquenchable fire and so the the choice is easy but you know God's already made that choice we don't have that choice God chose His Bride I didn't choose him he chose me you didn't choose him he chose you we are so thankful he chose us to be that bride what do we have to give him nothing but since he called me I want to surrender I want to be what he wants me to be why is this fire necessary brother Bram said in the future home fire is the only thing that can cleanse he said you can spray it you can you can put chemicals on it you can do anything you want to but he said that will not toally thoroughly Purge but said you burn it one time he said that will purify fire is the only purifier so God uses these types to show that only fire can really burn cleanse purify and only the Holy Ghost Fire can burn out sin burn out the desire for sin change of nature the only agent that can purify now we all know you must have the Holy Ghost to be bride to go into rapture we know that thank God for that word birth on your soul not on your spirit realm but you must have the token what is the token what what is the token we all know the literal Life of Christ Christ now Jesus was filled with the Holy Ghost Mary had to be filled with the Holy Ghost 120 were filled with the Holy Ghost all bride must be filled with the Holy Ghost now you got to watch Satan Satan's a Slicker is he not he'll tell you now you know especially for young people people coming up people raising message he'll tell you when you don't have the ghost oh have the ghost but he when you don't have the ghost when you don't have the Holy Ghost he'll tell you you do and when you do have the Hol ghost he'll tell you you don't so I mean he's going to tell you the opposite whichever it is but to why why would he do that is that is to make your faith the waiver because the whole Revelation is by faith faith is a revelation you're saved by Revelation you're born again by Revelation yeah we're saved by grace through faith but it's all by Revelation the whole church is built upon Revelation but so don't listen to Satan whatever is the truth he's going to tell you the opposite now Satan torments with fear and I I thought this was kind of interesting and maybe a little bit humor but it's certainly is true Fe a r you know really fear stands for false evidence appearing real FEA are false evidence and that's just the truth it's false evidence that appears real kind of like a paradox but it's false evidence and not just that's how Satan works and people have a you know sometimes a hard time or trouble understanding the difference between emotion and and sensation and Revelation which faith is a revelation brother man said what is the Holy Ghost given for he said you're now I'm going to say something right while I'm thinking about it brother B preached that series what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for and then the third service he said how do you know when you get the Holy Ghost but do you realize the what is the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost given for and the third sermon either was never recorded or was never released we don't have that what why how do you know when you get because he said I'm going to preach these three sermons and the last one's going to be how do you know when you get the Holy Ghost but it never was released or it was never recorded I don't know but I've often wonder why and I think I know why why would he not release that because if he said okay this is how you know you got the Holy Ghost 1 2 3 4 5 67 so if he just put that 1 through 7 so everybody had to go 1 through 7 to get the Holy Ghost with a big Coal Shed or this or that or this or that or so it's it's not any set place not any set form fashion I mean you could get it in church you could get it at home you can get it in the corn field so it's it's it's just a matter of what it is and what it's given for then it's an individual work just like the little room when they go through the little room they come through the little room there in the tent Vision they come out uh what happened in there I don't know I all I know is I was healed I was changed I was changed on the inside what explain to me what happened in there I don't know what happened there all I know is I'm changed so that's why I never did release that taper never did uh actually record it whatever brother man said you are not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost now is that scripture we know that Peter James John all of them said they were believed on the Lord Jesus Christ they were Sanctified John 17:17 sanctify them by the truth Thy word is truth Jesus told Peter said after you're converted then go strengthen the Brethren so know we know we're believing unto but you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost that's right you are believing unto the Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you publicly convinced him the devil has the same thing I believe him to be the Son of God so does the devil but you're walking on towards him when Peter had been called and justified by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ and in John 17:70 Jesus sanctify him them through the word for the word was truth and he was the word but you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost he says also what was the Holy Ghost given for a brother said to me the other day brother random some time ago months ago he said brother random Abraham believed God it was imputed to him for righteous I said truly said what more can a man do but believe I said that's all a man can do that's all he can do is believe God but but God God gave him a seal of circumcision that we went through last night he said as a sign that he had accepted his faith in him that's so important gave him a seal of circumcision as a sign that he had accepted his faith in him again it's all about faith you got to believe it and today until God said you believe unto him when you accept him as your personal savior but when God gives you the Seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to your Eternal destination that's when God has accepted you brother man says infuture home says you don't accept God God accepts you because you are his attribute so God accepts you when God accepts your faith and your Revelation then he sends down that seal and seals you with the Holy Ghost until then yeah you're believing unto you're going unto you're you're marching towards Zion but until he's received that faith that faith that Revelation and he knows that what what point he knows at what point that you're willing to totally surrender that's why brother B said in the he said well many times he said why you know when you we look at acts 238 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not a temporary gift it's eternal life you shall receive that but he says why God's obligated to give you that when you repent and baptize okay but why he said most people don't receive it right then when they repent and baptized why because they for for whatever reason lots and lots of different reasons they have it fully fully fully repented right made up their mind to serve God so it takes that time why it don't have to be that way but it takes that time for people say you know what I believe I I believe I'm going to have to die I'm going to have to die first but he goes on to say you he uh sign that he has accepted his faith and today and tell God you believe un him and accept him as your personal savior but when God gives you the Seal of the Holy Ghost he sealed you to your Eternal destination now you Baptist take that and I'll go with you on eternal security yes sir because grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption you're not sealed by believing unto but sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption that seals you when you've and now I like what he says here that seals you when you found favor with God oh my what is that remind you of what does the Bible say about there was a there was a a lady that fulfilled uh 712 years later a virgin shell conceived the Bible say Mary you found favor with God Amen whereby he said on your Redemption when you found favor with God Mary was highly favored this bride is highly favored and he seals you by by the Holy Spirit that's so for the Bible said no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost favor favor favor favor you are highly favored why listen the greatest blessing I know of is to find favor with God that's true Luke 1:28 and the angel came and we know the scripture and the angel came to her and said hay Thou Art highly favored and the Lord is with thee blessed are they among women you know why you're blessed because you're highly favored and the angel said to her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God you know anytime brother Ben said anytime uh an angel well of course never been face to face with the angel myself and most people don't but anytime a a human being comes into the presence of the Angel what's the first thing the angel says fear not fear not first thing the angel said when he came to brother bandam and the green mil fear not not you I am sent from the presence of almighty God always fear it's a fearful thing no doubt he said fear not thou H has found favor now if you if if we want to take these two scriptures and the angel came into her and said to her Thou Art highly favored I thought I'd just write it down and just kind of bring it up into the message so verse 28 would read like this if we just want to bring it up to date and the Sabbath Angel spoke to her the bride in the first seal and said hail I'm going to call you bride that you might understand blessed are they among churches so I just kind of add live that just a little bit but it's the truth but we are highly favored true and you are highly favored above all the churches yeah go go go look at the the preview of the Bride you know who who's the leader of the churches a witch and they're half dressed and this and that this and that dead are you not highly favored verse 30 it said and the angel said to her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with god let's just change it a little bit and the seventh angel said unto her fear not little bride for God has favored You by election before the foundation of the world I'm so glad he chose me I'm glad he chose you uh the bride has found favor with God you talk about highly favored women churches we are that why did God choose you uh none of my brothers I don't have any sisters none of my brothers are in the message Alison's got three sisters and a brother none of them the message your family most of them say why are that most of them are not in the message right why are you the the the the black sheep as it were why are you singled out you're highly favored that's right why did God let thousands die and perish the day that I got saved why did God extend to you the greatest of all invitations to be bride why well you know doesn't that shouldn't that spur a more of a Thanksgiving and appreciation for God why are you said why are you sitting in a message church and not in a denomination or even out on a bar stool somewhere why I tell you why because God put God put representation down in your soul why why is your business blessed you know not only do we have this just the spiritual blessing to be bride but I mean this bride is almost like a Prosperity message God has just so blessed his people oh and brother man said only the predestinated are considered in Redemption now in spoken words Original Seed brother M said the true bride like Mary will have a virgin womb for for the Bride of for the Bride of the word which is Christ when Christ the word comes to the bride she'll be the same as he is a Virgin by the word how can we when we were as brother B said we were back in those uh prostitute denominations you know influenced by them uh Believing on their Doctrine false Doctrine so forth you know Trinity three Gods baptized and titles and on and on and on and on and on things that we uh thought that we understood back there but God has cleansed us is a way that he had to do it by the washing of the Water by the word it's all by the word he said amen said she he is a Virgin by the word I hope it's it's going over to you brother Neville see I hope I hope you understand I love why brother man said I'm going to call you bride that you might understand the wise will understand Daniel said I hope you understand what was he the word the word of God upon his vesture he had a name written the word of God in the beginning was the word word with God Word was God and the Word was made flesh and the word is being made flesh today and dwelt Among Us he is God and God is the word and when his bride comes she'll be the same product that he is and what was he he was virgin to the word and you will are the same if you have been birst into the kingdom of God amen remember now because we are highly favored then we also must be high and behavior yes sir we're highly favored but there's a price to pay there's a price to pay there is a price to pay that price is total surrender to the word of God total surrender to the word of God I'll show you we'll talk about in a minute it's either heaven or hell we just you know it really just boils down to this it's either heaven or hell it's either serve God God's not going to take second place he's either number one or he's no place that's the way that's the way it has to be so there is a price to pay to be bride I'll take my way with the Lord's desp as few for me in my house we'll serve the Lord we sing that old song take this world but give me Jesus that's right total surrender to the word remember we're not converted till we receive the Holy Ghost and we are not sealed in until we receive the Holy Ghost the Bible says no man could even call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is Christ and Christ is that Pillar of Fire many manifestations of that logos what does a holy fire from God do for the believer what does it do let's find out what it does what will it do brother say the future home the Earth couldn't be a and the earth and the and and Humanity has to be redeemed cleansed the same way what will it do the Earth couldn't be a place for heaven to sit on now look at that the sin it has to be cleansed and he said and here it is here's a quote that I want to get to no man no person no woman boy girl I don't care who he is is fit to go into the pulpit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost you have no right to the Lord's Supper any communion feet washing anything until you've been cleansed by the Holy Fire of God it's right there wow amen and there's a reason for it serious amen why did God Institute sanctification God can't dwell in unclean vessel that's right it's just like you know we've we've used that illustration many you find a dirty glass out you know you want to fill it with water you first thing you got first thing you got you got to take it up out of the mud that's that's justification second second thing is you got to wash it and cleanse it and set it aside for service third thing is you got to fill that glass with water so there three it's always three steps of redemption that's what the whole uh message of future home is whether it be the bride the 144,000 the foolish virgins the cleansing of the earth it's all got to be the same he said I've always believed in those three stages of Grace amen unless you've been cleansed by the Holy Fire of God no mother man said no man has a right to preach unless like Moses meets him him out there on the sacred grounds that now him that Pillar of Fire hanging there where he knows where he's at so we so we all know we know that Christ is that word Christ is that logos Christ is that Pillar of Fire Christ is that light that struck Paul down on the road Damascus and he met them called him Lord Brother said he wouldn't have called that Jew wouldn't have called anything Lord actually he know that he was Elohim in that great light now as I said we titled the sermon meeting that Pillar of Fire now brother B said in future home we must meet him so who really is him him him is Christ and Christ is the word and just not any word it's not just any word not just Luther's word what what is we got to meet him which is the word what kind of word present day truth that's why this message is so critical so crucial it's got to be present day truth nothing else like the song nothing else will satisfy well Jesus in historical form no that's good for them Jesus in Luther's day that's good for them but it won't work today that's right that's why even brother man said an invisible Union said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost won't work today it was he said Pentecost represented that but we have a new word it's all new new day new dispensation amen present day truth word will produce a word birth so what's the requirement for a word birth or the token what is the requirements brother says in the bo and the boken the token the the token in Bakersville and when we can display the token of the Holy Spirit shows that we have been accepted in Christ and that our token that all and is our token that all we have need of is already purchased by him amen we identified why did brother man say all everything you have need of in for your Earthly journey is where in that seed even the rapture it's in that seed everything you have need of is in that seed amen we are identified with our token the token must be ready the blood the Covenant Covenant blood is not rec he said the blood the Covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of the promise the token is a sign the purchase has been made for us and then he makes this great statement full obedience sir to the word of God entitles you to the Token so as we said how do we honor God how do we believe God how do we worship God it's all by full why did he choose us because he know he put something in us that we could give full obedience to him if he chose his bride before to the foundation of world he's not as we've we've heard it said so many times God's just not say well I hope they receive it I hope somebody's going to believe what I say no he made a way you could receive it cuz he put that representation in you and that representation will come to the word I don't know how old you'll be but it will come to the word it can't do anything else because it's part of God his representation when that light strikes that light it will come to birth full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to the Token no other way is there that could ever be entitled to the Token only you fully obey the word what does the book of Acts say about that God G gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey it's all got to be OB is that mean your flesh is going to be perfect not at all no way you w't going to measure up your flesh is rotten is stinking just like mine everybody else is sticky Until the End we're talking about the soul amen and the Soul brings the spirit under subjection the spirit brings the flesh under subjection and we're like Israel we're separated people true how simple is it to obey well the greatest honor you can bestow upon God is to Simply take him at his word obey his word all things are possible if you can believe Bible said God as I just said God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey and Obey what Luther's word Wesley's word present day truth word it's got to be present day truth brother Ram told us that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to believe and receive the word for the hour what is the evidence is oh you know the Pentecost was cabbaged down on speaking in tongue so you know we've had went through that so many times we know that's that's not true at all but they still believe that the Pentecostal believe that they believe why you come to the I mean I don't want to get off on this I was raised in the Church of Christ I mean you know that's million miles from Pentecostal I met my wife she's Pentecostal home and so you know I wanted the Holy Ghost before we come to the message you know so you get to the Holy Ghost you come to the Altar and they pray you pray and they beat on you and they wiggle your mouth and they uh bu vibrate your chin and do and you know say say it now say it say it say it say it you almost got it you almost got it say it oh we've been that way I don't read that I you know I I didn't know much about the Bible but I never read that in the book of Acts that's right it just didn't work that way they was in in the upper room in one mind and one Accord and they waited and carried there being in one Accord until the Holy Ghost Came Upon them then they were filled with the Holy Ghost nobody had to shake their jaw and make them speak in tongue the utterance came by God all together amen yeah I can remember that you know many many years ago and even even even raised in the Church of Christ I I knew better that and I said would youall leave me alone would y'all just leave me alone there's got to be that's not the way you do it I didn't know how you did it but that wasn't the way right age oh praise the Lord Amen brother R told us that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to believe and receive the word for the hour and that your life Bears record of that word can I read that again the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to believe and receive the word that's present day truth and that your life Bears record of that word so it's not by you know we'll get to that in just a minute he told us to get away from all these Sensations and stuff as evidences and and of course that's one of the big questions today you know how will I know and brother B said Serv was the time he said one of the mysteries of this age was uh to be cleared up was uh the mystery of the baptism Holy Ghost without sin ation but the person of Christ performing the same Works in you that he did so it's not sensation we know that Satan can impersonate any of the gift sensation whatever but in the Masterpiece and we've heard this so many times but it's so important we'll get to this in just a second justification made way for sanctification you probably can quote the rest of it sanctification made way for baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself amen holy what was what what are we talking about we're talking about Revelation 10:1 Christ The Covenant angel coming down one foot on the land one foot on the sea coming down the fullness of the word the opening of the seals the person of Christ the Zoey of God Amen that's meeting the pillar of fire present day truth receiving the Life of Christ the literal Life of Christ receiving the token Christ on life now you know the difference I just thought I'd bring this in we talk about grace and mercy and Justice what is Grace Grace that's getting what you don't deserve that's Grace and what's Justice that's getting what you do deserve and what's Mercy Mercy is not getting what you do deserve I don't want Justice I want is Grace that's why this little bride is crying Grace Grace double Grace we didn't get what we reserve what we deserved but he give us Grace okay now we've talked some about these mechanics of meeting that Pillar of Fire and the Holy Ghost and New Birth so you say well brother Tera let's just make it real simple okay well just make it real simple let's talk about a few things here uh you say well I was raised in the message I never was in denomination Barnard I never went out in the world so how' I know okay let's make it real simple well you know remember what Albert Einstein said one time he said you know if you don't make it simple it show shows you don't understand it ful of yourself so let's try to make it simple that great mind said if you don't make it simple it shows you don't understand it yourself so let's try to make it simple I mean how could you take eals MC squar energy equals uh masstimes the speed of light squared how can you make that simple but he said you got to make it simple now let's look at some few things here try to make this meeting that Pillar of Fire real simple first of all we understand that church was inaugurated at Pentecost we know what happened there up a room all filled with the Holy Ghost 120 it wasn't anymore it was just God God above them it was God in them we understand that Peter preached that great sermon that day then their hearts were pricked because of great Peter's great sermon and he said what can we do sir what can we do in other words what can we do to be saved we want this what you've got what can we do to be saved he said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you for the miss you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now we all know that that the emphasis is on repent anybody can be baptized in water anybody actually can repent say God I'm sorry you know I want to I want to go to heaven and so repent be bad but see repent and there's really more messages need to be uh preached on repentance because repentance is not just Lord I'm sorry just you know okay what's next repentance is death repent repentance is change of Direction it's a change of Focus it's a it's a complete change you were going this way now you want to go that way it's it's an about face it's a turnaround it's not just Lord I'm sorry for what I did that's all part of it but you're you're saying I'm finished with that even though you're a babe you're you're you're you're just believing unto basically in the beginning but you you you you you you're you got to make a decision I'm finished with this world I'm finished with sin I want to turn around there's got to be a it's got to be a genuine repentance I mean a a heartfelt desperation repentance it's got to be that so that's why most that's why most people don't receive the Holy Ghost when they're baptized because they haven't fully even understood and recognized the the the depth and the magnitude of what real repentance is it means a total turning around separation from unbelief as much as you know even at the beginning amen so that's that's that's the first thing that we got to understand repentance has got to be a a a total total reversal that's true okay that's that's just making it simple now the Bible says for grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God let's make that real simple so what is Grace Grace is getting what you don't deserve it's unmar favor creates a bond it creates a connection and the love for The Giver that has given this favor what what is Grace it's actually unmar favor God gave you something you didn't deserve God gave me something I didn't deserve so by Grace that's how we say by Grace okay that's real simple are you saved through faith as I said before it's all got to be a faith walk brother remember had to believe he was saved and to fill with the Holy Ghost by faith you have to believe that you were saved and filled with the Holy Ghost by faith nobody gets a certified letter it all is by faith the whole church is built on faith it's all faith is a revelation it's all by faith you say well you know I would I want some kind of proof well that's what the Pentecost want was speaking in tongue you got it you got you're sealed in don't worry about it you're good to go no lots of people could speak in Tong didn't have it but it's through faith you've got to believe and you've got to have that Revelation so for grace are you saved through faith and that and I just I love the last part and that of not of yourselves the faith not of yourselves Paul said one time the life that I now live in Jesus Christ I live by the faith of the Son of God it wasn't even Paul's faith God chose Paul God told him uh ananas I think it was said that he's been chosen vessel to suffer many things from him and you know go up in three days and pray for him that he might receive his sight and so forth God chose Paul God chose you and whatever and it's like it's like the little seed package the little seed package with uh I preach on one time you get a little seed package of Maragos or whatever and the seeds in that package if you look on the back side of the package it's going to tell you all the characteristics of that of that plant that marago it's going to grow so many in just High it needs full sun it's going to be uh cheery it's I mean this sh everything that's it's all on the back what that seed is going to produce that's what it is and God has chose you to be the bride and you're going to produce that you're going to be cheery you're going to be you're going to need full Sunshine Too amen I mean this is a dark gloomy day but you got to have that full sun and Rise and Shine for the light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee amen it's not of yourself it's not even your faith did where did Abraham get the faith he's he's called the father of the faith where did Abraham give that faith God gave him the faith God gave him the faith to be able to sojourn in a Strange Land separate from his father and so forth like that and then God turns around and get and gives Abraham credit for having faith and God gave him the faith now brother that's Grace amen he didn't have the faith he was just ordinary idolator like anybody else but God chose him and give him the commission and come out and gave him the faith to do it and then give him credit for having that Faith that's my God we love him don't praise God it's not of yourself it is the gift of God so we even know that salvation is a free gift all your good works and all we know that all good and perfect gifts come from above so we know it comes from God Amen nobody in their right mind would turn down a perfect gift from God well that's the reason they're not in their right mind because they turned it down to truth God see God Is So persuasive because he's called you and chose you to be his bride he's so persuasive he made you an offer you can't refuse he may he gave you an offer you can't refuse well you can you can you can run for a while but I mean it's like a man running without a message God you can run for a while but God made you an offer you can't refuse use and somewhere he going to track you down like the blood hounds on the trail God's going to find your place brother sister amen but it takes faith it all together takes Faith B by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourself it's a gift of God it there again it takes Faith water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ it takes Faith receiving the Holy Ghost it takes faith believing that you're one of them it takes Faith let's look at another one how do I really know that I'm that God really loves me I can see he loves bam I can see he loves others how do I know he loves me I mean me yes sir remember remember the little armor outfit when the when the the armor outfit the great uh Cowboy you know was going out west to find a bride and everything and he went outside and he you know he asked a little um she was throwing out the dishwash this dishwasher dishw waterer and he said I found character in you that none of the others inside had and said will you be my wife and she said me me you want me I mean that's the great boss all Chicago armor outfit you want me to be your wife say yeah I do so I'll be back in a year from now well God chose us why me he loves me why let's look at this you see Church age book I tell you how you know God loves you you see they could not figure out God's love saman church age they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love elective love the proof of his love is election the proof of God's love to you you is election the proof of God's love to you is election that he called you to this message that's proof God loves you you don't if if you doubt that you don't believe the Bible if you doubt that you don't believe God's word if you believe if you doubt that you don't believe the message the proof of God's love is he called you by election to this message so that that's that's real simple that's real simple if you don't believe that you need prayer he loves you he called you amen by his love is proven truly by the fact that you were chosen un salvation and that takes Faith sure see it all takes faith everything we've talked about it takes Faith you must believe that you are that chosen amen amen you can't get a word birth out of denomination you can't get a word Birth by believing just God sent a prophet you can't go into Rapture without a word birth listen God winked at man's ignorance down through the church ages but the day since the full word's been born and restored and Christ is here in an open book lay claims on all these names that's in the book now he requires the token amen now he requires the token not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit realm but the literal Life of Christ dwelling in your heart your heart your soul not your spirit Ram your soul the real you where that Gene of God is in the soul not on the spirit in your soul remember don't forget this in the Masterpiece I read it again but I'm going to say it again justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't stop there with Pentecost and a baptism the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself that's the only way we can understand this quote listen brother R said in leadership last message of the one of the last message you ever preached 1965 you're the choice of your conduct you could you don't mix it now you either for God against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside see the caber many of you think now listen this is a strong statement brother man said many of you think well I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's leadership 1965 what is he trying to tell us he said that listen the the baptism of the Holy Ghost as as we know down down through and it takes Faith to believe that it takes Faith to believe that listen and this this almost gets into another sermon and it gets really deep but I'm trying to make it just really simple uh why then did the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the Holy Ghost himself well first of all because it was only partial word that was given down to the through the church ages Luther had a dip into the Holy Ghost Wesley had a dip into the Holy Ghost Pentecostal had to dip into the Holy Ghost but now we have the full word is restored amen the the the perfect interpretation of the revealed word with Divine Vindication but we know that the that the baptism Holy Ghost it did several things and it it actually block it blocked the influence of Hell having the baptism of Holy Ghost but we have the Holy Ghost himself a full word birth it makes you rece available to receive the truth it gives you the ability to believe every word uh the anoint know that the this anointing is at from the seventh Dimension because the seventh Dimension is God and God has come down in our days I mean there just so there's so many wonderful things about this message that we just uh we begin to understand it more and more he is here and we are becoming him am mean it was given the baptism the Holy Ghost was given to be victorious over the enemy be an overcomer but we have the anointing which is the token which is the literal life of Jesus Christ amen and we know that but when the Holy Ghost himself comes then you get a word g word word birth we know that the seventh seal brings him back to Earth and he we know that the seventh seal has been open it's brought him back brought Christ back to us Revelation 10:1 he's here he's here in the fullness of the word Christ in you the hope of glory oh aren't you we're just so we're just so thankful for what God has done in this generation Amen brother man said man has become one one unit in the future home he said Heaven and Earth Embrace uh man and God has been unified has become one unit he said you even a walk walking like en it because you're under the anointing of the of the Rapture translation of the bride all I mean this is this is uh Promises to the elect not not to just those denominational Believers you know back back in Pentecost so forth this is for the bride the elect amen walking like Enoch is ready to take a Rapture says when when we eat the book we are called by the third pull like Mary the bride says be it un me according to Thy word so you actually become the very existence of Christ amen Amen brother man says the rising of the sun you have been resurrected amen you've been resurrected now let's look at what one couple more things and then we'll try to find a closing place I'm not going two hours now so don't worry so next what's the result of the token we possess it's a complete nature change yes amen if it's the literal life of Jesus Christ it can't do anything else and that takes faith it takes faith and faith is a revelation I don't care if you've been raised completely the message and you say well you know Jesus said I'll be with you even in you it's not emotions emotions has nothing to do with it Sensations has nothing they all come part of it I don't believe in a dead religion I believe in all that too but it's going to take the literal Life of Christ to give us a word birth you say well my parents was a believer that don't have nothing to do with it either I don't care you say well I don't cut my hair and I don't wear pants uh that won't gain you interest in heaven that's that's required but that won't gain you interest amen you say well I I I never did go back in the world well what about the Rich Young Ruler he B the Rich Young Ruler he obeyed all the Commandments I mean he'd been to church all his life brother M Dr dramatized that and he he done everything and Jesus said but there's one thing you lack he said I've done everything else I've kept the law I've kept the Judgment I'm still Li I've been to church I've been to the synagogue I've done everything but one thing thou lack us what did he like what just because he was was rich and had a lot of possessions over that that wasn't that was issue the issue was he was not willing for total surrender it takes a total surrender I don't care if you're poor as a poer riches Bill Gates or whoever that has nothing to do with it's got to be a total surrender amen so even people that's raised in the message you know he said well you know it's like one brother he said and he he said he was raised in the message his daddy was a preacher he come to AIDS you know to receive and and the brother was the brother was he was he wasn't arrogant but he was genuine because he had never cursed and lied and drank and done anything been out in the world I mean he's raised in church stayed in church done everything right far as and he said daddy said I mean I'm not being arrogant said what do I have to repent of what have I got to repent of well first of all you're born in sin shaped iniquity come to this world speaking lies your first nature I don't care if it's a good nature it's still a corrupt nature it's not the nature of Christ it's not the life of Christ it's still got to be transformed it's got to be renovated be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that word renewing means renovation when you renovate a house what do you do you take out all the old stuff and put new stuff in so your mind has got to be renovated because we got all that garbage and trash out there that we had in the world but maybe you didn't have all that stuff in the world like that but you still your mind has got to be renovated it doesn't matter whether you was whether you was out in the world or if you wasn't out in the world You' still got to have a nature change CU you born and old sour brother man said snake nature that's why he the prophet said full obedience to every word of God entitles you to the Token whether he's in the world or out of the world you still got to eat the book you still got to eat the word you've got to digest the word and when you digest the word you become the word and that's got to be in your soul this is a this this quote here out of the Dallas token I thought was really really good we're talking about that life has got to be on on the inside it's good to be on the outside I mean the German Baptist the Amish the menites they outshine the greater percentage of of of message women I mean they cover everything I mean from the top of their head to the soul of their feet you know what I mean but they don't have life I mean I'm not saying that none of them saved I'm not saying that I'm just say they don't have this token life brother man said in this message the token he said said God's bloodbound promises makes us free I want you to listen this is a tremendous statement God's bloodbound promises makes us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world different from the rest of the world he said now notice way he phrases this and don't get it wrong this is not giving you a license he said you don't have to dress different anybody can dress different in other words he's saying just because you dress different anybody can do that that like I just said Amish menites German Baptists they dress different but what do they have said anybody can dress different you have to be on the inside different so simple you have to be on the inside different life is on the inside life is on the inside life is in the blood where's the blood on your blood's on the inside life is on the inside he said it's not dressing not wearing that's all part of it but that's not it it's you got to be different on the inside that's why we have to have a word birth we have to have a nature change we have to meet that Pillar of Fire we got to see that he said the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink or wearing of apparel but it's a longsuffering goodness gness patience in the Holy Ghost he said now the promises makes free from sin show knows that God has has it recogn has it recognized your sin David said blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin isn't that wonderful blessed is the man who God will not impute sin it's not reckoned God doesn't hold any sin against you and God will never impute and God will never impute sin over the token so what does that show us if we got the token there's no there's no sin imputed that's right AB that's why he can say an invisible Union you stand absolutely virt as a Son of God before God you never sin in the first place you trapped into it but your virtuous blood wash pure uh unadulterated uh have a virgin womb and everything God will never impute sin over the token because the token is the paid sign that God has already received it and you got that token for it amen your faith again it's Faith your faith has bought it your faith has bought it your faith gives you God gives you the faith it well you said it's your faith but God gives you the faith we know it's your faith God gives you the faith but you got to have that faith and you have the purchase price of your redemption in your body to worship him and show forth his promises you get the inside right the outside will be right that's the whole thing you get the inside dressed right the outside will dress right don't dress the outside first you got to well you that's fine you know but you got to get the inside you got to get the inside right too amen but amen just because you dress right that don't prove you right on the inside but you've got to have life on the inside and again notice your faith is what bought it so another little simple thing you say well I how do I see the pillar of fire or do I see the fire or will I see the pillar of fire well then they say well will I see the pillar of fire the answer is actually yes and no you're not going to see it with your eyes but you're going to see it with your heart you're not going to see it with your eyes you may see it with your eyes but you're going you're definitely going to see it with your heart and and see means to understand see well I just can't see it you mean you don't understand it but you will see it with your heart Amen brother man said I'm going to call you bride so that you'll understand now listen I've got five more pages but I've run out of time so we just have to quit but I do want to cover this one thing or just for a for a minute uh we read that scripture about the Lord Jesus and he's Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness what is being full of the Holy Ghost that's a that's a pretty deep subject what is so I'm gonna give it to you in about two and a half minutes it means this when the word for the hour has come to its season and embodied itself and the spirit of the word is in that vessel for his its fulfillment then you're filled with the Holy Ghost so we better read that again when the word for the hour has come to its season and embodied itself and the spirit of that word is in that vessel for it fulfillment and you could take Mary the word for the hour in her days was a virgin shall conceived that word came back through through an angel to her it had to body is somewhere so she said be it unto me so that word was embodied and then she believed it and then the spirit of God fulfilled it for that season so what you saying what's the word for this hour what's the word for our hour it's Malachi 4 for that word everybody can't receive it but that word has got to take has got to be embodied in somebody so that word has got to be take on a fleshly form so when that word for this hour is is embodied amen and then the spirit makes takes that word and makes it live then that's being filled with the Holy Ghost because brother so what is is the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's when you can receive the word for the hour and manifest the word for the hour so being full of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word and believe the word and manifest the word for this hour and you say well you know but I just need Assurance you you got Assurance I just gave you the Assurance if you've met the requirements of God then just believe it it ain't going to be no fleshly manifestation amen you don't have to be you might cry brother man said this he said when you get the Holy Ghost he said will I speak in tongues he said I may I may not will I shout he said you may shout you may not will I dance you said you may dance you may not but there's one thing you will do this is a direct quote he said the one thing you will do you will bear the fruit of the spirit and that's love joy peace longsuffering gentleness pees make kindness he said you will because that's the very nature of God that's the life of God that's the nature of character cuz when you get the Holy Ghost you get the literal life of God so that is the character of God if you dance fine if you speak in Tong fine if you shout fine that's all fine but that don't have nothing to do with it it's getting the the very nature of God to be transformed into His Image that's why he said you will bear the fruit of the spirit it's not a fleshly evidence people can say anything listen when we first musicians come on when we first come into the message we thought and we were wrong about it but we thought man if you can see this message you got the Holy Ghost you're you're good to go you're sealed and if you can understand seals and pulls and Mysteries and this and that and this and that 40 years ago if you if you can understand this message you got it but we found out that wasn't true amen that wasn't true well I don't call names but he said some some of the ministers that have fallen and it's all public knowledge I'll just take one I mean brother Tim of all Tim M of all the people I really really loved and admired I mean I mean I'm just I just my mind just don't put it together that's right brother I mean mom and dad called by Brother brand many times he was dedicated by Brother brand was raised I mean went to brandom Tabernacle you know raised in the message preach this message missionary work supported meetings and everything how how how can it be how can you have a how can you have an intellectual understanding and preach the truth preach the words and yet there's no Revelation no representation I trust he comes back I hope he comes back but how can it be it's first of all it's sovereignly given but it's got to be a word birth the literal Life of Christ has got to be in you it's got to be by Revelation you got to have it we've got to have it ain't going to make no Rapture without it it's got to be there and that's the only thing that's going to keep you we see him falling away why are they Falling [Music] Away we was talking about that a little bit this morning there's such a a great falling away in every age I mean it came through the first Exodus they came they came out of the Wilder they came out of Egypt saw the Great Signs wonders Miracles first and second pool you might type it out first second pool you know coming out of Egypt saw the Miracles and so forth but then through the Wilderness when the tests and the trials came bam I'm not Baum but uh Byron Dayan Byron so forth of those ones that Moses you take too much of upon yourself you know you're not the only Holy One in the camp you know they they just they they were stiff necked they just didn't they just and brother man said they all perished outside of those over 20 years old said not one of them made it in only the young ones made it in said they perish said not a one of them will be in heaven that is sad 2 million people they didn't make it in first and second pull saw the signs wonders and everything to come to Cades Baria and said well we just we can't do it and that that that one thing two years into the Wilderness that one thing we're they they requested the spy mission we got to find out what's on the other side God didn't request that spy mission the people did because of their unbelief we we got to see what's on the other side and the 10 spies come back and the and the influence of those 10 spies actually destroyed them and they stayed 38 more years in the wilderness 40 years one day for they because the spies over there 40 days punishment for rejecting the message of Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to take the land and the same thing today first and second pull in Jesus's Ministry everybody warned him when he started preaching I my father one they turned away the 500 the 7 all the way down they turned away what's happening today first and second pull everybody love brother br fishing trip hunting trips you know stories discernment everything but now the third pool we're under the third pool why are they Falling Away same thing it was at first Exodus same thing was in the second
