your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Isaiah the 6th chapter and I've got a card here um says brother Shan sister Heather and all the church um uh see uh thank you um for uh coming over and singing and praying uh for me and um it says I enjoyed it so much also I thank everyone that visited me at the hospital rehab and uh for Sister Kim and the Sunday School uh class coming to see me uh

God has uh he has surprised doctors time and time again and he can do it again but it's no surprise to us when God moves because we believe in that we believe in miracles we just believe in the Supernatural amen and um before we go into the word may we just bow our heads in a word of prayer and uh talk to our Lord father it is truly good to know you and to be able to put our lives into your hands knowing that you hold our future you know all about us father and we wouldn't have a future so bright if it hadn't been for you promising Lord and making us hes and join HS with Jesus Christ the father we we thank you Lord that you have left us an inheritance and now father we just pray that you would just be with us give us the strength today and help me Lord just to deliver what's on My Heart Lord may it be edifying to your people Lord we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen um Isaiah the 6th chapter we're going to start at the first verse says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord um sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I woe is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of of a people of unclean lips for my eyes have seen the king of the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues uh from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin is purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me then if you'll turn to the Book of Job the 23rd chapter Job chapter 23 we're going to start at the first verse then job answered and said even today is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh that I knew where I might find him that I might come even to his seat I would order my call before him and fill my mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand so that I cannot see him but everybody say but he knoweth the way that I take when Heath tried me I shall come forth and as gold amen you can have your seats and we also want to keep brother Tim in our prayer he had to go to North Carolina this weekend and be traveling back today and so may God just give him safe traveling Mercy amen today I really don't have much to um say I don't guess um it's just going to be a simple thought and um I want to talk about God resting in God's will for us and I pray that'll be of some help uh to you uh God's will can be difficult at times and in doing it um can be a challenge um and so it's not always glamorous and it sometimes uh to be honest it leaves us scratching our heads as to what God is doing and um and you know and but but one thing that we must not ever do and we must not accuse God of being foolish uh in his will for our lives or for any other uh there uh God knows what he's doing and and the Bible would tell us that God's judgments are unsearchable and his ways pass finding out and so God is the we we'd call him the sculptor we'd call him the artist we would call him the Potter we would call him whatever but it it just shows that he is Sovereign in what he's doing he has a plan he has a will and when he's done we can look at the picture and know that it was God that done it and it' be perfect and so um I believe our opening scriptures are applicable for us in this day and uh we can relate to to both of the scriptures uh and and by these scriptures we see the uh two ends of the spectrum I I guess if we could call it that and one is being sent with the commission he just come from the presence of the Lord and um that must have been a significant time in in Isaiah's life and and to um uh what what I mean what what an encouragement you know uh to come from the presence of the Lord and to experience what he experienced and then now the Lord is sending him forth with a commission and uh uh you know that that that would have been been great and then then of course the the other uh one that we see is is uh being being tried as by fire and he he don't know where God is he's trying to find God and he like to talk with God and God talked back with him but it just seemed like God's disappeared and uh but we we understand why and that is because that job was going through something job was going through a trial and job would say that that he has tried me though he tries me I will come forth as gold but but one thing that job would tell us is that he never lost his faith he never lost his confidence and his his faith in God at that time was he knoweth the way that I have taken in other words I'm not being deserted even though I I can't he seems far from me it seems like you know that he he doesn't understand where I'm at and and all these things but he knoweth the way that I take uh of of course because God is the one that allowed that way God is allowed that direction for for his life and and so believe it or not both you know Believers uh uh in this day uh experience both ends of the spectrum uh for the Old Testament was types and shadows of the new and and and Isaiah is a type of the believer coming under the influence of God's presence and humbling himself and being changed changed and and and then being sent and and and see so so God sends us God sends a man to fulfill his will right he he sends a man to fulfill his will and so this is why every man woman boy girl that that uh uh is to fulfill the will of God then they first must come under the influence of God and and then hum themselves uh uh before uh their sin uh because to fulfill the commission that God gives us and and and and to be honest you know as we all as as Believers we understand that we're the bride of Christ and we understand that we are a word bride we understand that everything that that God does with us and and commissions us and and all that must be in the confines of of the word of God it it must be there but yet God God commissions us in a personal way and and and gives us certain tasks certain uh uh things that we do to to to to fulfill his will for our personal lives but in in all reality it's an edification to the whole body of of Jesus Christ and and so uh when we look at that then then then we we've got to first come under the influence of God and and when a man comes under that influence in the presence of God then then he automatically does exactly what Isaiah done for Isaiah is the type of the believer uh uh and and that is to Humble to Humble ourselves and not look at anything else that is great but but you're looking at the one that is great and that is God and and you come under that that presence you humble yourselves and and you become changed and then God sends us and and so uh uh for us to fulfill the commission that God gives us then we first have to accept the will of God we first have to come and and and this is why we must come into the presence of God to to realize that God is on the throne that that God knows exactly what he's doing and and that that there there is nothing that can Dethrone him and and so that when he makes a decision he makes it with an ultimate goal with an ultimate decision it it it's someone that is superior that no one is binding him no one is is making him it it's from his own sovereignty and and so we we find that job also is a type of the believer that is tested and tried and so and and and we find that God does both he he he commissions us he sends us out but he also uh uh tries us and he and he and he molds us and he shapes us can you say amen and and and so God has a purpose for all things I am amazed that God would choose and send people like us to fulfill his purpose on Earth I I really am uh of uh we we all of our hangups and discouragements our ups and downs and and you know and and so uh uh it it really is is amazing that God would take us and and and commission us and every every woman boy girl man that is a part of the body of Christ you have a commission God God sends you God places you in that body for a purpose and and so you're not just to to float around that's not exactly what God has called us to do if we're part of the body can you say amen he sends us out to fulfill the commission which is his will for our lives and and we've got to fulfill that now this this sounds really exciting to do something for God I think if I would ask uh you know for for a show of hands of who wants to do something for the Lord I think most of us would say yeah I I'd want to and and and and of course in thinking of this we think of Glamour we think of wow this is going to be really you know something to be used of God you know and and maybe we would think it as as the president you know or Trump calling you personally and saying hey would you help me in my campaign and and man now that would be a I'm sure we would all consider that to be an honor and and whether you choose that or not brother bill says no but but we we whether we choose that or not and we'd probably go to friends and we'd call them up and say Hey you know uh uh president Trump just called me asking for me to help you know and uh can you believe that you know I'm working at whatever McDonald's and all that but he wants my help I mean his whole career depends upon this and he's asking for me you know and and well you know whether you get excited about that or not but I think it would be an honor if God would choose us and God would call us and and say would you help me in my kingdom and I don't know but I think you know if you got that personal call that God somehow personally comes to you whether it's a pillar of fire an angel or or whatever and he comes down and says hey you know um uh I'd like for you to help me out you know and and and well you know what well but God has done that God God has he he he has us uh to help him in you know in in in his kingdom how many believes that and and so that that is something to be excited about that the god of Heaven which chuse us in our in our Humanity to help him further his kingdom and when when he could have called the son to preach the gospel and yet he chose men to do that he he he could have called all kinds of things to to further his kingdom but he chose us to do that and and and so so and and and and exciting it may be yet it is our responsibility because we're not waiting as though God you know needs to come in the form of a pillar of fire or in the form of a body uh uh to talk to us and personally ask us I I think he has done that when he saves us and when he uh uh uh redeemed us and he filled us with the Holy Ghost then then there's something that he put within us to want to do something for God he do you believe that and and and yet and and so it is our responsibility to fulfill this commission amen I I you know when I I felt you know uh when I really began to get serious about the Lord and and uh things I I began to feel this call uh to preach you know well you know I was you know nobody I I still am a nobody I but I didn't sing in church like Wendell and Lena did and of course Jonathan was too young and and at that time but um but they were the singers they were being used they were the ones that everybody adored and you know looked up as the icon of the church and for the young people I wasn't that that's for sure and and so you know but but I I remember just feeling that that that I you know God's called me to to preach you know and I was ashamed to even say it you know and and so I I finally told Dad and he well that's good you know we just pray about it and things but you know I never was called upon to do anything and but I told the Lord Lord I'll do it if you want me to do it you know and I don't even know where to begin don't even know how but here I am today with that being said um that that that sounded great to to do something for the Lord I really did want to do something for God uh but I had no idea what that would entail and probably if I knew what that entailed I probably wouldn't have I said uhuh no sir re Bob you know and I'd be skidding on the break you know putting on the brakes and and uh doing something else but uh uh regardless we find out it's a responsibility do you believe that amen it's a responsibility to do to to that we have to fulfill the commission so whether I want to do it or not I've got a obligation I've got a duty to fulfill uh uh the will of God and and and my obligation and my duty my responsibility is to God and him alone I I don't answer to no one I I've got to answer to God for for what he has called me to do do you believe that see and so Corinth 1 Corinthians 6:19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods ain't that right so we will answer only to God Amen not no one else and and and and it's the god that we will answer and it's the god that that uh we owe everything too ain't that right so when we think of that though when we think of of wow you know that I'm going to be responsible for everything that I do that God has called me you know then then that that really is a sobering thought that I can't be laxed in it I I can't just do my own thing I I am as what Paul would say a prisoner to Jesus Christ you know I I would love to to be able to you know uh uh take a year and and just go sightseeing and and just there's a lot of country I'd just love love you know I'd love just to be able to float around if if you want to say it that way and drift over here and have no responsibilities and and and just take my time and whatever you know just live a Carefree life but and and and but I've got a responsibility to God yes and and and and and so so so then therefore doing the will of God is Not Easy A lot of times it rubs us the wrong way a lot of times it goes against the grain uh of our flesh it it it just it just does and of course we are people that always looks uh uh you know uh as they would say the grass is greener on the other side right you know everybody's got it better than me and and everybody's doing it better than me and and and we're always looking on the other side of the fence at the other guy amen and and and so to to stay put or or to do the will of God and to do what God has called you to do is not an easy thing and and so now now God didn't choose people that are s super human he didn't choose people that were faultless and didn't have troubles and he didn't call A A Perfect people uh uh descend out into the world he he just didn't do that that uh I I have said before you know that God doesn't choose qualified people but he qualifies them whom he chooses and and why God would choose us I have no idea why God would choose me to preach the gospel I have no idea why God would put me right where I'm at I have no idea I I really don't uh uh but all I know is that I'm in God's hands and if I'm in God's hands then I've got a responsibility I've got a uh a uh uh um uh uh a fulfillment to uh uh to achieve ain't that right a commission to fulfill and and so the the commission itself is perfect you believe that the calling of god is perfect the choosing of god is perfect the voice of god is perfect the commission is perfect but the one who he sends isn't amen so when God sent us out when God gives us our commission and sends us out he doesn't do away with Humanity our Humanity he doesn't do away with this Human Side of us to where uh we we're Superman Superwoman you know and and and these things but our Humanity stays with us as long as we're in this body of Flesh in this in this dimension of time mortal and our humanity is what brother brandham called a carnal nature yes and he says as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again amen ain't that right so so you've got a perfect commission that has been given you you you have been chosen which is a perfect choice no one can take your place amen ain't that right and yet while you're trying to fulfill the commission you got a sticky nature you got a carnal nature that's going to bother you well until you're changed have received your body changed time of rapture ain't that right and and so the choosing the commission is perfect that comes by predestination do you believe that and that's what we've got to rest in we've got to rest in the predestinated will of God for us can't rest in your flesh amen can't rest in your abilities can't rest in how good you think you are you can't rest in any of that you have to rest in the predestinated plan of God for your life sure amen do you believe that so fulfilling the commission is not an easy thing because of our sticky nature we build complexes this word complex in and Webster's thought of it uh one of one of these interpretations of it is a system of thoughts feelings memories that exist in one's mind but of which one is not aware and which influences one's Behavior so this complex a lot of people don't even know they've got a complex until things come up and then it it it it shows itself complex complexes are caused by things that we have experienced in life being rejected being laughed at made fun of being talked about being embarrassed we get complexes by comparing ourselves with others we can get complexes by being hurt by others and it causes us to build a complex misunderstandings can cause one to build a complex now now think of it God gives us a perfect commission and we're all excited about it and yet we're a people that can build complexes hello brother Ram talked about the twin girls that were Christians amen both were made uh fun of because of the way they lived the way they dressed the the their beliefs and and all these things they were Holiness girls and things and but but they were twin girls one of the twins uh was able just to override it and and ignore the comments and the ridicule and and the Jabs and all that and uh but but but the other twin sister she she she couldn't get past that and the prophet said she developed a complex now I want you to understand this now and she felt real bad about it see she felt bad about the way people were talking about her and laughing at her and and all these things and and it just kept you know just kept going away she kept going away drifting further back and just worrying about it constantly worrying about it what people say about her what people laugh at and and all of these things see she she couldn't get over it and finally she got a mental breakdown now she's in an insane award the prophet said her mother and father's just coming a little bit you know and says oh over there you know to this in institution and and they're trying to send her to Madison so anyway she and he and he says now there's no physical break in the girl there's nothing physically wrong she's perfectly healthy but it's hard to explain it see and it really cannot be explained but well he says what it is her spirit has wandered she had a complex and she dwelt on it and dwelt on it and dwelt on it and it caused her spirit to wander and it drove her insane the prophet in another place talking about the same girl she built a complex got nervous she went insane they had her in an in Institution for two years see they was trying to doctor her by give her all kinds of stuff and treatment everything and yet it didn't work right ain't that right now God by Grace helped her amen Lord but but we find it I I you you would think that God would send people that hadn't no problems like that that God would commission people to fulfill his purpose and had no worries true true but that's not true amen am we all worry we all get hurt we all feel pain we all experience things in our lives that shake us to the core brother random said it's so easy to build a complex it's so easy he said I guess if I'd asked tonight in this audience of people how many in here knows you have a complex he said practically every hand would go up a people that God sends to fulfill his will his commission and we all have complexes Satan Works Satan works on that human nature amen can you say man in the message standing in the Gap brother brandham even talked of the complexes that he himself built up a prophet of God that could take himself in the scriptures show us what his ministry is in the scriptures and yet he had complex yeah he said and here's here's what it was he said I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message I built myself a complex because the people didn't set my message now Moses built himself a complex too remember God sends Moses out of all people God sends Moses Moses we find out was not pctop perfect he was not he was not perfect in his human well had a temper for one but he had a complex right and and and so uh uh the prophet said see the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left them alone went into the Wilderness but God turned him around notice what this complex done he had for long forgot the suffering people yes he he actually walked away by this complex he walks away from his calling walks away from it all because the people wasn't ready to hear his message and you say amen amen but also on top of that Moses had a stuttering problem that he was embarrassed about you going to send me I get before that King make a fool of myself right and so there was complexes in his life that he had to overcome that's right brother brandham talks about his complex that he built up in himself it it actually made him he determined to go hide out in the wilderness shut himself away from the people right and only come out when the Lord told him to say something he' just he'd just drop in say it like like the prophets of the Old Testament and then just go back into the Wilderness because he had built up this complex so by that complex he he he was going to do something you know outside the will of God but God showed him what would happen to him if he did as he planned can you say Amen you see God doesn't forget the commission God doesn't forget what he's called you to do can you say amen amen we can forget many times because of our human nature we can forget and this is the trouble we've got to keep guard of everything around us because Satan's going to take that sticky nature and try to sway us this way sway us that way sway us all kinds of ways but we are obligated to God to stay in his will and you say Amen so God doesn't forget his commission and I say to you God doesn't forget you either of all the prophets of all the men of of old that had their complexes and wanted to quit wanted to give up wanted to do something else God never forgot them right God sent Jonah to go to Nineveh Jonah Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh right but God didn't raise somebody else up God remembered his commission and God remembered his servant ain't that right see no one can take your place amen complexes opens the door to bitterness right and what that does it causes us to lose sight of our commission bitterness is something that and complexes it all goes together I believe but it makes people want to close theirself in so that they don't get hurt anymore that they don't be bothered anymore more that they don't have to uh deal with things anymore and if God has called you to do something you're going to have to deal with it hello Satan's there to back you know to combat you all the step every step of the way can you say Amen but it makes people hardened to the gospel brother brah said if you want to get anywhere with God never let an arrogance Spirit come around you don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complx against that person You' be sweet and kind and remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you then you love the other person when he's in the wrong and just pray for them and love one another can you say Amen now that's easier said than done I promise you that but nonetheless we've got a commission right yeah true ain't that right it's easy to to baby this old flesh it's easy to pet this thing it's easy to to to to to base the will of God upon us as to what we want to be ain't that right now God is depending on us can you say that with me God is depending on us God is depending on us he's not going to replace you he's depending upon you you can't hide you can't run you you you you you you got to stay in the perfect will of God and and I think of of uh brother Bram talked about U running that you preach that message running from the presence of the Lord and he talking about that our our responsibility to God God and to the will of God yes can you say Amen it may hurt it may cut it may it may go against our grain it might it may whatever but we're here to do the will of God you love the Lord if you look at even even Paul and Paul being the first church age messenger and he had a great experience what a tremendous uh experience introduction to Jesus Christ they saw him in the pillar of fire personally and and he saw him in a greater way than even the apostles or disciples saw him when he was in the flesh and and and these things and you know his story and how God changed him turned him around and interesting that in in in in his time of of conversion and being a new convert God told him that he must suffer many things that's right so God just let him know right off the bat so here he's the first church age messenger but then we find out that he struggled many things but he had an obstacle in his life and and in second Corinthians 12 and8 Paul actually tells us that he sought the Lord three three times to take this obstacle away from him Paul wanted to fulfill the commission but uh this obstacle he felt was was hindering him from fulfilling the commission and and so but this was what God said to him he said my grace is sufficient for thee right my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness can you say Amen my strength God God didn't agree with Paul see it's amazing how that a lot of times we think God will agree with us and God doesn't we think here what Paul was saying that you know basically this is this is really a pain th this is hindering me and and and if you just I just wish you'd take it away and yet Paul or God would tell him no I'm not not going to take it away my strength is made perfect in weakness can you say amen and and the weakness that Paul had brother Bram said was blindness Paul had been in prison for most of his ministry and he went blind he had to have someone else to write his letters or if he did write it he actually he would say it that I'm writing in large large print and all these things and so what Paul would consider a hindrance God considered a a way to his strength to be perfected can you say Amen so God doesn't take away things that maybe we would think he would take away things that we consider to be a hindrance to us from fulfilling the commission no God knows what he's doing amen true amen so we find that we cannot measure our ability to fulfill the commission by our weakness then then we see then it's all about surrendering it's surrendering to God because to to do his will you have to be totally surrendered hello you have to be totally surrendered and and because God has given us a commission we we all have this desire to fulfill it as I've said we we we want to to to do something for the Lord and these things but often times again we go back to the complexes that a person can build a complex by looking at what others are doing for God and he or she can minimize what God has called them to do by looking at what others are doing yes and ain't that right and and again this comes from this carnal nature that we have to deal with on a daily basis brother Bram talks about it just in his own personal life he said you know he said I was thinking yesterday in my talk to a neighbor boy and he said you know a certain little Pastor he said he's just such a wonderful fella said wife and I were sitting with our pajamas on and said about 11: at night he come by and knocked at the door and you know uh uh said come by to have have a cup of coffee with you you know and said he cut across the street to another neighbor and they were just about ready to go to bed and he eat a cookie over there with him and then he said you know he had a little bible school for the for the kitties and and he had so much so many little kitties there him and his wife until they had to put up tents on the outside to accommodate the children and I went back now now this affected brother brandham hearing hearing this man talk about this little other pastor it affected brother Bram and he and he says I I went back and I got to thinking you know that's right that's a wonderful little fella and I believe you know he said brother fleeman here I believe this boy goes there it's a Little Faith Lutheran Church up here just a wonderful little man and his wife they're doing a great work for the Lord and I thought I I got to Wasing my car and I become discouraged think of that I I I I become discouraged and I thought well why is it that I can't do that go around get all the kids the to follow me around he said I love kitties and and why can't I jump from house to house and from Pillar To Post like that and something just said to me you wasn't called for that you wasn't called for that that's can you say Amen what God called them that man to do that's fine but God didn't call Brother random to do that God called us to preach this message what other people are doing that's fine that God's called them to do that but we're called to preach this can you say Amen see and and and it's so easy to build complexes because every time we witness to people oh you're an ultt oh you're this and oh you're that well I wouldn't do that you know well then the next guy he's over there witnessing and everybody's running there you know and doing this and doing that he's got the programs he's got all that and buil complexes as though the message ain't got power enough and the people are just narrow-minded or or you know uh uh people in the message think they're better than everybody else that's nonsense but it comes from complexes people walk away from this message because they feel like it's lost its lost its Glory it hasn't lost its Glory it's sent for the bride that's right that's the truth you remember Deus built complexes toward Paul thought he was washed up thought he he just His Glory Days was over with and he walked away from Paul yet brother Ram said it was the crowning of his ministry where Paul was that was God crowning his ministry but see God's will is so different from our will that's it right there so if you're called to preach if you're called to sing if you're called to be a housewife if you're called to be a musician if you're called whatever God has called you in stay in that calling and we must not as though it is so easy to do is compare our own selves with everybody else not every housewife is going to have her house run the same way as the other person sure if you're not careful you'll beat yourself down and say well I'm just not a good housewife I'm just not good I'm not good at raising my children I'm not good at you know being this and I'm not good at that and you start building these complexes and you forget about what God's called you to do that's right if God wanted you to be sister so and so he would have made you that way amen but God has confidence in you amen he knows all about you he knows all about your makeup and your personality he knows all about your strengths and your weaknesses right that goes for for Ministry that goes for churches that goes for anyone musicians don't ever compare yourself with the next Church down the road right that's the problem with Internet everybody gets on the internet and look watch these other churches oh man they're doing this and they're doing this why can't we that's right you understand what I'm saying and it builds discontentment right I think every man should be the best preacher he ought to he can be amen but to be the best doesn't mean that you have to be like somebody else every musician ought to be the best if you're going to play in the church be your best but your best shouldn't be the standard of some other Church Lord every Minister ought to do their best every minister in this message ought to study this messagen give their all to it but not everybody is going to preach like brother Wayne Lawson or Andrew Glover or or whoever but you're best in what God has called you to be that's right amen if we're not careful we build these complexes and we forget about the goal we forget about the commission hello but God before when he called you and he chose you that was perfect in his calling do you believe that God is perfect in his calling you can't complain to God about his calling amen so often we can do yes I hope you understand I'm preaching to myself this morning so if it's not for you it's for me in another place brother brandom you know he says many times people go out and see an evangelist like for instance our brother Billy Graham now what good would it do for me to try to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it if I had to now think of that see he said I've got a Min Ministry that I've got to take care of can you say that with me I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of I I I ain't going to take care of brother amos's Ministry I can't he can't take care of my Ministry amen he's got a Ministry that he's got to take care of I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of because we're all responsible to God ain't that right that's right every singer is going to be responsible to God every musician is going to be responsible to God how you played how your attitude how how you approached it you know you know everybody has got a Ministry that they're going to be responsible to God so they've got to take care of it ain't that right and yet and that's all in our human human I mean you're you're going to face hurts you're going to face rejection you're going to face ups and downs so he said I've got a Ministry that I've got to take care of and the next man's got his ministry and each one has got a Ministry even to the housewife has a Ministry of ministering the word of God ain't that right see so now if I try to impersonate Mr Graham I'd find s in trouble right quick cuz he's smart shrewd educated a real preacher well I'm not well see maybe if Mr Graham tried to find himself imp impersonating me he'd be in trouble too so there you are so we can't do that we've got to do what God has revealed to us to do see brother Graham is doing that God has revealed to him a worldwide Revival and he's making a good show of it too and I appreciate him and I'm trying my best by the Revelation that God has given me to minister to the sick people and to do what he told me to do can you say Amen now I pray that God helps us helps us all to understand and and uh uh and you know that that every every member in the body is important and if we're members of the body then we're important can you sayen the Bible says that God gave gifts unto men and and so not everybody's going to have the same gift one one individual is going to his gift is going to differ from another man's gift we all don't have the same gifts talents we all don't sing alike We Don't Preach alike and we all don't experience things alike true true ain't that right so then a a man cannot judge his current experience that he is going through with another man's experience you know you you you you you might be going through the valley you might be going as job does where you're sitting there thinking where is God the next man he might be on the Mountaintop I mean he's in the presence of God all the time and it would be so easy for the devil to convince us that God has forsaken us that God is not with us because we compare ourselves but if God has sent us and commissioned us then God will never leave us never for forsake us but he said he'd be with us all the way whether you feel him or not whether you see him or not therefore you have to remain faithful in what God has called you to do amen can you say amen that's right so so we all have our different paths to walk we all go through different seasons in our life in our ministry in our Christian walk we all go through different seasons some may be going through trials here in this building this morning others may be on the mountain top this morning but we all go through it one on the mountain top can't look down and say man you know you're a real basket case you know no and and the guy in in down in the valley can't look up the guy at the mountain say wow look at you you know you you just can't do that ain't that right now Ecclesiastes 3 and one to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted and this is all in the will of God A Time to Kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather uh uh Stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a time to render or to Rend a time to Soul a time to keep silence a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of War a time of Peace a time a time a time a time God sets times for it all seasons and a lot of time we just don't understand that in the seasons as to why but we know at the end of these these verses it says but he makes all things beautiful in his time true can you say Amen so God deals with us on a personal level it's not a group thing and we must understand that it's not a group thing so if it's it's it's an individual thing yes in a local body we are to come together we are to be in unity we are to work together for one goal for one achievement but when when it comes to the will of God for our personal life it's an individual thing and like I say but God always brings the edification to the whole body with it it's if you understand what I'm saying so but but but it's it's it's it's it's an individual thing and so so you know we're having our own experiences with God and you know brother brandham uh sung this song A lot uh there in Shady Green Pastor so rich and so sweet God leads his dear children alone where Waters cool flow bathes the weary one's feet God leads his dear children along some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood some through great sorrow but God gives the song in the night season and all the day long some on the mount where the sun shines so bright God leads his dear children alone sometimes in the valley in the darkest of night yet God leads his dear children along through those sorrows befall us and Satan oppose God leads his dear children alone and through Grace we can conquer and defeat all our foes God leads his dear children alone that's true I'm so glad that he leads us I'm so glad that when he gave us the commission we don't have to compare ourselves to others right that we can do his will regardless of what others think what others say what others feel amen we have to do his will we have to do as he tells us amen can you say amen amen we all have our cross to bear but we must be satisfied in our calling and we must rest in it ain't that righten and we must drive to do our best within the bounds of our calling amen for God made us the way we are ain't that right now if we could realize that to be true there wouldn't be so much discontentment that so often hits us as I get ready to close I I think I think it comes by God revealing it to us we have to find that direct Revelation the prophet said of our life to fit in the program of Goden Moses had to have a direct contact with God to know how and when to do it and he said and that's where the Pentecostals have failed can you say Amen you see when we thinking of surrender we are all different members with different gifts but we belong to one body that is controlled by one spirit and in Colossians 1:18 Paul speaks of Christ saying he is the head of the body aren't you glad for that he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence now you think this is the place that we have come to in this day and age is that God is having complete preeminence in the body if we're that body then God is having compl complete preeminence in your personal walk in your personal commission it's God leading and we becoming fully surrendered to what God wants does it rub us wrong yes do do we always see it at you know see what God is doing no but there's something down inside of us that know that God's leading us to do this and God's leading us to do that and it paints and it works out for the best for for for the the you see the whole picture of it eventually can you say amen and and so the gifts that God has given us are to be under his control and this is how he uses us he he doesn't give it your ability he gives you a gift he gives you a gift so that he can work through You by that gift see but before he can send us then he has to have us under his control to where we're not trying to work the gift but he is actually working the gift this where so many people get in in trouble by prophecies and dreams and visions and all that and and because they say it's of God but God is not the one that is speaking but when God uses that gift and he speaks then watch it happen watch it come to pass it happens just exactly true God uses the gift amen so therefore he has to have us under control Ro to where it's not a competitive God competing against us God we using the gift when God's wanting to use the gift and we're making a a show of it and and making a failure of it anytime that a man uses his gift on his own ability he makes a failure amen now brother Bram said there's many people that will welcome Jesus in as Savior but he can but can he be your lord lord is ownership see the Lord has complete control you would plenti welcome him to keep you out of hell and torment you would welcome him as your savior but are you willing to welcome him as your lord to take over full control can you say Amen is this okay amen being that we are free moral agents then then it's up to us we're not robots we're not one that's God just computes it and then we just automatically do it again this is where the struggle comes because we have the stick nature but we are free moral agents therefore we have to make our choice Paul says I Die daily so it's something that is a daily Choice it's something that when we wake up Lord I'm here to do your will I'm I'm here to surrender myself to you yes I'm here not to walk on my own ways not to offer you my own ideas just God whatever you want for me that's what I want can you amen and and and so we must surrender ourselves to him so that he can use us in whatever capacity he so chooses we shouldn't go unless he says to go we shouldn't say stay unless he says to stay we shouldn't do something unless he tells us to do it and we shouldn't hold back unless he tells us to do it you see brother Ram says it's God's election and forn knowledge is what makes the thing so if we have a desire the Bible says it's not him that willth or him that runneth but it's God that showeth Mercy it's not whether you will or whether you want to or where your desires is it's whether it is God's will or not then we have to find out God's will and if it's that if it's that perfect we can just set our faith to that and say this is it and we run right on the way the will of God runs can you say Amen you see Jesus knew what the will of the father was brother brandham said we are so blessed because we have the privilege to know the father's will ain't that right and if we will seek God if we will seek God then he will make his will known to us ain't that right you love him Amen brother brandham says here you know uh he said I'd rather know that I was in the will of God if I never spoke spoke to another person than to preach to 10,000 people every night out of the will of God I'd rather know the will of God he said I believe it was David that said I'd rather be a doormat or something at the house of my Lord than to dwell in tents with the wicked see what a privilege everybody say what a privilege what a privilege to find our place and there abide no matter how the devil shakes what he says and how or how he scoffs stay right straight in the will of God and I think any child of God will respect leadership of God of others amen because he himself is under the leadership of God can you say Amen Lord and so this is why every man must be led by the spirit of God and he must follow the leader ship of the spirit whether people understand it or not you know and I as as I close I think it's important that we understand this leadership of the Holy Ghost is so important because as we grow in the Lord we we come more into the fullness of what God desires for us you believe that as we grow we come more into the fullness of what God desires God doesn't show us everything all at once true with the will of God comes changes Junctions Crossroads Cutting Loose yes and a lot of times it leaves us in tears it leaves us wandering true it leaves us broken but yet it's the will of God Amen it's just like as a child we've all developed when when we started out as a little infant child but that wasn't God 's plan for us to stay there then we start growing and with that comes changes right there's sometimes you might Mama might say man I wish I wish I wish my children wouldn't have growed up so fast I'd just love to cuddle them well you can't cuddle your 30-y old there's changes but then you develop you develop and and you then you come come into a toddler age and then we continue to grow until we come into adolescent years and that that's where you know the child starts developing into adulthood right and and they you know they say early ad adolescent years begin you know from age 10 to 13 and the voice begins to change and the child begins to change his ways of his thoughts and used to you know you used to goooo and gag G and used to this and then he develops into to walking and and and and he stumbles and he so easy to trip you know so easy to fall gets note head you know my grandpa always called me note head I begin to understand why maybe I fail so much you know and and but but you know then then you start you start developing and you watch your child and look where we're at today and yet we still haven't come to our full potential ual because in each stage of development we're doing something we're experiencing something we're achieving something right so through all of our lifetime as we develop we experience changes we experience challenges we turn Corners in our life we come to Crossroads we experience Growing Pains a lot of things become memories hopefully they're good memories but all of us have our memories that we don't like to think about right but this is what happens in our spiritual life we we have growing pains and brother brand says he may permit Crossroads he may permit Crossroads to try us to perfect us for his service he may permit that now church both here and on tape he may permit the crossroads for our service like he did Daniel he gave Daniel a little Crossroad one day you know when he was a great man down in Babylon he did he let the king turn against him and throw him and the Lions then it only perfected him sure did let the Hebrew children go into the fiery furnace they was determined to stand for his word he may permit Crossroads let them laugh at you for having long hair let them laugh at you for saying why you become a holy ruler whatever more see they may laugh at you for that and this and that and well that that's all right see that's a crossroad that's a little Junction that's to prove something see but you can't forget the commission now right see the only thing that the crossroad did to the Hebrew children that stood on the word it only loosed them from the bands that they had around their feet and the legs and sometimes it takes hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us sometimes God lets us have a little trial you know to see what we'll do to take the world out out of you or take you out of the world or other words let you have a little trial and knock you out of that organization and that idea that the Methodist is the only one or the Baptist or the Pentecost or that's you know that that's the only group they got and you know if you don't believe it like my church believes it then you don't believe at all and sometimes he lets little Trials happen and maybe you got a sick baby maybe something takes place right at the hour of death maybe someone taken from you see or or something what's to do to break you away to show you something to open your eyes maybe you have to you you've come to criticize you know and maybe you're listening to this tape just to criticize maybe God's doing that to break some of the worldly bands that has got around got you bound down see and so he permits Junctions and Crossroads to do those things stand on the Promises the word for they never fail the future that's in his hands stand like they did and don't give away can you say amen and in this time in our Christian walk we experience a development of character our ministry develops our Christian walk develops and I truly believe that development comes by the experiences we have don't get bitter don't build complexes can you say Amen Let It Be that we become more surrendered to God we become more broken to where God can use us more that we can become more sensitive to his leadership that we come to realize more and more that we're nothing without him can you say Amen it's it's then we become more compatible for the ministry that God has called us to we become more compassionate toward others I thought of Sharon Rose when brother brand talks about her she's dying and she was in such Agony that her eyes crossed brother brah said she looked at me and she was suffering so hard to one of those little baby eyes her little eyes was crossed like that and looked at her suffering soul and she was looked like she was trying to reach her little hands to me and it just tore my heart out of me and I thought oh God and he said and from that day said that's the reason crosy children I just can't stand to look at them you know God does those things some times he has to crush something to get the good out of it isn't that right he said there's never been one pass over the platform but what's been healed too he said I didn't know the crushing had to bring it forth can you sayen you see by the sufferings that we go through God is developing us more into his image that we could reflect him that we could come into a word image a word ministry can you say Amen you love the Lord amen I thinking of Michelangelo as I close if the musicians will come Michelangelo brother Bram talks about him you know and the Masterpiece and there he he was a famous sculptor but he said every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it the the idea is there locked inside all you have to do is remove the access Stone and every block of marble I see a statue as plain as though it stood before me Shaped and perfecting attitude and action I have only to heue away the rough walls that imprison the lovely Apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it I thought why what a powerful thing God would take us rejects nobody's but what he sees he sees a beautiful thing he sees his bride he sees in his Perfect Image now he's been shaping it he's been molding it so it can come become very clear of what he is seeing now made made known to the world can you say amen amen I love the Lord we could go on and [Music] on but I don't know what you go through I don't know the things you deal with but I do want to say don't forget the [Music] commission don't forget that God is with you don't don't forget that you got an obligation to God [Music] right things are going to [Music] change there's going to be times that you're going to be in your dry spots you remember you saw the change in Elijah's Ministry at one point he was up on the mountain calling fire down from heaven what a glorious time that was and then the next moment we find him in a cave hiding scared the anointing had left [Music] him he stands there as a man and a threat of a woman to kill him was hanging over his head right but he had to find the cave to hear the voice of the Lord and He waited till he heard the voice and then he could go out once again and fulfill another part of the commission under the anointing of God can you sayen but the changes come Jesus experienced change he started out in his ministry you you know what brother brand taught it he had the first second third pool every every even brother Brandon but every with every pool come a change in in the ministry and but but not only that he Jesus started Healing The Sick working miracles that was the beginning of his ministry he was a popular man by the time his ministry changed he began to reveal himself through his Doctrine as to who he was and people began to walk away walk away walk away he went from being popular to being rejected and crucified he went from showing us how the weakest Christian could take the word of God and defeat Satan anytime anywhere under any circumstance he went from that to being wounded for our transgression and Bruise for our iniquity to hang in on a cross saying my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me but that wasn't the end of it he rose again can you say man I thought of that what if Jesus had built the complex by feeling the rejection of the people what if he had built a complex by the things he suffered what if he had been built a complex by being misunderstood we know he had to fight these complexes because the Bible says that he was tempted in every Point such as we are so he had to fight them things but he stayed with the will of God he done exactly what the will of God told him to do men misunderstood him didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't understand the whole plan but he stayed with what the father said and it come to the point that he would ask father if it be your will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless thy will be done aren't you glad aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that he could surrender himself wholly to the father if he couldn't have done that you and I wouldn't be here today [Music] but he left us an example because as he done the will of the father so must we we have our Gethsemane too we have our crosses we have our rejections we have our sufferings and we have our victories amen and the final Victory is when we put death under our feet death will not be able to touch us again aren't you glad for that amen God bless you is our prayer what's up he's got it all he's got it all in control he's got it all in control he put that reassurance [Music] look [Music]
