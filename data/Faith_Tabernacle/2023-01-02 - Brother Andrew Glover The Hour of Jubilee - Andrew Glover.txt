to be an instrument unto you come have your way Lord bless Lord ever serve us God bless brother Wayne Lord as he comes to bring your word father we're inviting you now have your way Among Us this week in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says a man and amen The Book of Leviticus the 25th chapter amen we want to look in the eighth verse you can see brother Mark God bless you buddy Amen brother Tim God bless you and all the visitors here tonight Leviticus the 25th chapter and the eighth verse the Bible says Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 and nine years then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof and it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family and Jubilee shall the 50th year be unto you you shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself in it nor gather the grapes in it of the vine undressed for it is that you believe and it shall be holy unto you ye shall eat the increase thereof of the field and in the Year of Jubilee you shall return turn somebody say return you shall return every man unto his possession I also want to read in the Book of Luke the fourth chapter The Book of Luke the fourth chapter you know that Leviticus 25 is brother Graham's text for a sermon called return in Jubilee and in the Book of Luke we want to look in the fourth chapter we thank the Lord for the prophet of God Amen we're not reading the word under a theologian but we're reading the word under a Vindicated voice amen Luke the fourth chapter and in the 16th verse Jesus has just come into the temple and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written now we know that that was Isaiah 61 right he found the place where it was written and the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captive the Covenant of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book and gave it to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears can I say it like this he began to Proclaim this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears one of the place I want to read just one verse is John the eighth chapter I pray you all forgive me for so many scriptures tonight but I pray the Lord will help us to tie these thoughts together just something on our heart in John the eighth chapter and the 36th verse the Bible says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed if the son therefore make you free ye shall be free indeed we ask Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I title this sermon I want to speak to you on the hour of Jubilee the hour of Jubilee brother Bram says in a message he calls it actually he preaches three messages if you get time to listen to him very powerful sermons I find if you listen to them back to back in 1956 he'll preach azusa's Jubilee then he preaches return in Jubilee and then he preaches this day is the scripture fulfilled and in the message returned in Jubilee He said now is the hour of Jubilee come back to your original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again amen I I really I believe if that's why that our pastor here has had these burdens upon his heart to have these meetings this weekend not just for a protractive meeting or not just to show up and see who's here or who's not here amen but that sons and daughters of God could return back Amen to their original inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again now that uh title there is return and Jubilee let's say that together return and Jubilee if you look at the word return it means to bring back it means to allow to return it means to put back it means to draw back it means to give back it means to restore it means to relinquish one's rights given in payment Amen to bring back to refresh to restore so in other words it's not something that you're actually working to do but it's actually something drawing you back to itself it's actually pulling you amen it's actually forcing whatever has laid claim upon you to turn loose of it that you could return back to your original inheritance the words you believe there means a special anniversary of an event it is especially one celebrating amen 25 or 50 years of a rain or activity now we're not here tonight celebrating 25 years of Ministry or 25 years of a church or 50 years of a church we're here tonight amen rejoicing in the opening of the word which was the Jubilee to the bride remember said Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people amen for restoring or to be brought back and to their rightful position he says now I believe that this is the hour again of Jubilee amen I believe that it's time to Jubilee amen I believe that it's the time of Jubilee listen we are not here tonight Desiring amen amen a better or a better uh how I say this a better idea amen we are here Desiring the revelation of the word amen to move into the Flesh of the church to actually cause them amen to return back to where they come from let me just say it to you like this you did not come from Leo to see him you did not come from this world therefore you cannot stay here amen you came from a place called eternity you you came from a place where there was no sin there was no unbelief there was no devil amen and time has laid a hold of you amen time is proclaims upon you amen but before time ever put claims upon you amen there was a gene seed inside of your soul amen that claimed you before Humanity let me set you like this amen deity claimed you before Humanity ever got a hold of you and there's something inside of you that is drawing you back to where you come from what are you saying I'm saying amen the same God that sent Jubilee in the days before is the same God who sins Jubilee today I don't believe it's time to be depressed I don't believe it's time to be discouraged I don't believe amen it's time to come to a message church and sit there with our Spirits all tore up and all watted up amen at first ever been a time to be rejoicing in the Liberty we're with Christ has made us free amen this is the hour this is the time this is the season amen when God is sent you believe remember him said the devil has come in and taken many Believers captive during this time amen for instance coldness and worldliness has slipped into the church amen but the thing we're here for today is in celebration of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost Revival that we used to have he said I hear our fathers talk about it how the Angels came down and they sang in the meetings listen and the power of God taken over amen they sang in the meetings and the angels came down and the power of God taken over and the Saints were born again amen and great things happen listen amen we did not come here to see who's here and who's not here this week we did not come here Amen to serpent ideas among preachers but we have come here for one purpose and one motive and one objective and that is to get lost in the spirit of God to the Holy Ghost comes in the church and does things that Andrew Glover amen does things that Wayne Lawson knows nothing about a known Church we're not here for just another meeting we are here for a jubilee we are here to rejoice in the Liberty we are here I'm not going to worry about teaching I'm just gonna preach right now amen we're here to get free of all these tied down Traditions we're here to get free of all these ill feelings and bad attitudes and so and so did this and so amen when are we going to let it go amen and move forward in the Liberty we're with Christ has made us free we are not a bunch of chickenized hotbed hybrid plants we are Sons and Daughters of God we are eagles that has been born by the genes of God we have not been born from time we have been born from eternity and eternity's got a claim on you amen God is going to claim on you you can't stay in that depressed condition because depression ain't in eternity you can't stay in that bitter condition because bitterness is not in eternity but I'll tell you what is in eternity it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory I tell you what is an eternity is the angels of God moving among the people I think it's time to let the power of God take over I think it's time to come back the prophecy LED an old-fashioned backwards sky blue sin killing amen preaching the old sassafras type yeah maybe maybe men didn't know their ABCs but they know Christ and they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what we hunger for today is an old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost and a pouring out of God's blessings he said oh I feel today let in my soul to make this proposition with the people I believe if every one of us in this building today will rededicate our lives to God Amen as Jacob was told by the Lord amen to wash up his and get his people clean amen up to present themselves before the Lord I believe it for clean up ourselves from all of our evil thinking from all of our selfishness from all of our backbiting from all of her acts of this life and come boldly Before the Throne of God I believe in old-fashioned Revival will break out here in Angela's Temple that one week will never stop it let me say this friends I'm going to replace Angela's Temple amen with Faith Tabernacle I believe it for clean up if we'll get rid of her back button and we'll get rid of our grudges Center get rid of our disagreements amen the Holy Ghost shall Break Free in this church amen that one week will contain it amen a mouthful contain it I'm not talking about a man-made Revival I'm talking about a word Revival breaking out in the church until men get clean and women get clean and young people get clean and preachers get clean listen you may think I've lost my mind I have and you say who you after right after the devil tonight I think it's time to break loose I think it's time to spread our wings and let a Revival break out in the church we don't need a new church to have Revival we need a Revival in the church we got we don't need new programs to bring a Revival we need a rededication and a re-out point of the Holy Ghost that will bring a Revival in the Church of the Living God you say brother Andrew this is just a weak meeting don't you let some lukewarm lay out a sin careful amen numb down the potentials that's inside of this meeting they say well ain't much can happen amen maybe if you've got a natural God there ain't much can happen but I'm talking about a supernatural God I'm talking about a God who is the identified Christ of all ages then what are you saying I'm saying the potentials of this meeting are Supernatural the potentials of every one of these services are Supernatural they're probably say When Faith from an honest heart meets God them cogs just comes together like that and something has to take place he said I challenge this audience tonight in the name of Jesus Christ let your faith connect with God like that and in a few minutes we'll have another Pentecost there'll be such a Revival break out in this town if there wouldn't be enough cops in the country to keep it down he said there will be a real Revival I'm on Church what is a real Revival it's a real word manifestation of the real one true and living God what are you saying I'm saying that you're not here just existing you're not here just going to Services you're not just here going through rituals and habits and routines amen but you have come from another place you have Come From Another Dimension amen you are not here reflecting amen the genes of your Earthly father and the womb of your Earthly mother but you are here with a gene seed on the inside of your soul and as a Christian amen you're reflecting your hormone church amen we're not just going to reflect our inheritance when we get on the other side amen by the prophet said there's some Believers that's on this side that'll be reflecting what they're going to if you're headed towards tribulation then you've got every reason to frown if you're headed towards the Lake of Fire you've got every reason to have an old backbone Pine Spirit on you amen but we're not headed for tribulation and we're not headed for Doom and boom amen but we are headed for the new city amen that John saw coming down from God out of Heaven I think it's time to change our friend into a smile I think it's time to take off the garments of heaviness and being replaced with a spirit of Praise unto God what are you saying I'm saying it's the hour of Jubilee I'm saying it's time somebody amen Proclaim Liberty and anointing and change has come to the church you saying I'm saying amen that we're in a jubilee we've had a jubilee we're in a jubilee and the prophet said we're headed for another great Jubilee come on friends you can't lose with this message you can't lose with the Holy Ghost you can't get down enough to lose what God done for you we had a jubilee we're in a Jubilee He said we're headed for another great Jubilee He said there's a great reward that's laying on the other side yes sir to see this great church prosper and to come on some glorious day I hope to meet in another great Jubilee what are you saying I'm saying that God wants his church to be free God wants his church to be free direct quote God wants a church that's free let me ask you this brother Mark how do we get free do we get free when the music gets right do we get free when we find the right song do we get free when the pen hits the right key according to a prophet we get free when the word is revealed in the church Reverend said what is God he said God is his own interpreter hey I'm all over the place but just let me preach he said I kind of feel like Abraham he said when Abraham sat there and he said he saw them two come walking down he said something reminded him he said when he saw that he said something ring a bell he said oh that's something about it when you're in the house of God and you see him he said we ought to start ringing the bells you know what the ringing of the Bell is it is the sign of Liberty it is the sign of Freedom it is the sign amen that a greater influence has broken and we're no longer under what we used to be but we're now free oh all the prophets at his time that God has come into his church and he has freed his church by his word I tell you why emotions can't bind you it's cause you were not released by emotion I tell you why sensation cannot bind you is you were not released by sensation I'll tell you why the troubles and trials and situations of your life cannot bind you is because you were not freed by those things you were freed by the infallible spoken word of the almighty God and there's nothing in heaven and there's nothing on the earth and there's nothing in the pits of Hell amen that can defeat the word the word will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime any anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition the word will defeat that devil then what are we here this week doing we're here being visited amen we're here being entertained we're here being touched amen by more than just the mere words of a human preacher but ministering Spirits are sent from the presence of God to come into the church and to minister to those who are The Heirs of Salvation And I just go ahead and preach to you you are not The Heirs of depression you are not The Heirs of anxiety you are not The Heirs of pornography Devils you are not The Heirs of filthy living you are The Heirs of Salvation then I think it's time amen as Heirs of God and join Heirs of Christ I think it's time we start living Amen to the standard and the potentials that God has called us to live to what are you saying I'm saying the prophet said when you see the spirit of God strike a place and that place get under the anointing if this little group here this morning could just take this mind here and get every doubt out of the way come on we don't need 150 to have church according to Matthew we just need two or three we don't need a building people I meant to say the supernatural we just need two or three hungry hearted Eagles that'll press towards the identification of the word regardless of whose hair regardless of listen I'm not backing up I know the potential sits in this church I know the potentials that's in this meeting I know the potentials that's in this message he just needs somebody to let go and let him have his way how many say tonight God I'm gonna let go and let you have your way I'm gonna let go gonna let go of the tradition gonna let go of the problems gonna let go of the depression gonna let go of the negativity gonna let go of the misunderstandings gonna let go of the things I can't change and let God come in and the power of God break out and the whole church listen I'm not preaching a sermon I'm preaching from a burden right now let the whole church come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it'll change the picture it'll change the situation I'm not I can't change it Wayne can't change it Sean can't change it Mike can't change it but if the angel of the Lord can change it the pillar of fire can change the situation what does he do he comes in there and he stays right with the word and it cuts every devil what is it it's the ministering spirit that are sent from the presence of God to anoint the speakers of the word that'll stay with the word and he confirms the word with signs following brings Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what are you saying I'm saying he's here I'm saying he's not here brother Malachi just in a picture form what is in the picture is in this building this week oh God what is in that picture is whirling through this building right now what is hitting that picture is in the heart of this crazy preacher what is in that picture is in the heart of this bride well what are you saying I'm saying bride it's not your morning it's your Jubilee what are you saying I'm saying the bride's Jubilee is when the word that has been written becomes interpreted and becomes fulfilled this day this scripture fulfilled what a word think of it this day this scripture is fulfilled before your eyes brother Steve said who said that he said God himself then who is The Interpreter of his own word this day is this scripture fulfilled come on church I don't have time to lay down every scripture that is concerning this bride but I do have time to say this the one who inspired it to be put in the holy writ is the one that is coming in this meeting this weekend to interpret and to confirm and to fulfill a known Church there's going to be somebody manifest the seven Divine Natures there's going to be somebody manifest the fruits of the spirits somebody's going to manifest the spoken word somebody's going to manifest Greater Works somebody's going to manifest Mark the 16th chapter somebody's going to manifest it brother Mark he's not going to raise up rocks to do it but he's going to claim redeemed flesh and the son of man is going to take possession in the flesh of the bride and it's going to manifest what is in his word it's going to be in his church what are you saying I'm saying that the Messiah himself is standing in the presence of the congregation reading a word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then says this day is his scripture fulfilled and they still failed to see it I'm on now let's preach the one by the heaven that read Luke 4 was the one that was in the beginning what's the one that anointed Zechariah was the one that anointed Isaiah was the one that became flesh in John 1 14 was the one that was standing in the synagogue come on church he was not reading about Isaiah he was reading about himself Mr hope how else could he break it down than to look at him and say what you're looking at in that word is who I am what's your lasting God to send is in your midst he said oh what a tragedy that would be but it's happened and he said it's happened many times he said and how could it happen of course like it did in other times by believing man's interpretation of a word that's what caused it come on there he is and they heard a man say he couldn't be the Messiah there it is and they heard a man say that he would not come the way he can he will not come of an illegitimate birth amen but there he was regardless of what private interpretations had said about him Mary was and they're missed come on Faith Tabernacle I'm gonna lose my mind and preach for a second every devil in hell says we can't see Revival in this church but for God who anointed William Branham and said if you'll surrender there'll be a Revival breakout in this church that God is in this building tonight and he's not here in a Corporal body he's not here with Nell prince in his hand but he is here in the form of his word and he's inviting you to recognize him and when you recognize his presence you will release his power when you recognize who he is those Believers in them they so-called Believers took the interpretation of the priest let me ask you this whose interpretation are you going to receive about this meeting whose interpretation are you going to receive about your healing whose interpretation are you going to receive about this message I say Amen we identify this interpretation as the perfect interpretation with Divine Vindication because he was different from the rest of them he said the person of Jesus Christ was so unique that no one should have missed see it he was the son of God because he was the perfect identification of what the scripture that was wrote of him was among usable Andrew I need a meeting I need the Holy Ghost to move I need something from God do you realize you're sitting in a church that is operating underneath a perfect identification of the way a prophet said a church only be in order you didn't come in here 30 minutes and a bunch of people running around talking about their Gardens you didn't come in here 30 minutes and some guy get up and come through a song book and try to find something to sing but there's been vessels there's been officers in position there's been preachers praying there's been husbands and wives dedicating himself why do you saying I'm saying Faith Tabernacle the sky is the limit to what God can do in the heart of this bride in the heart of this church we are not here as a bunch of Pentecostal Chuck we are here as a word born pride and we're manifesting brother Tim what a prophet said would be manifested in the age that we're living in oh yeah we're not here trying to identify ourselves the message has identified us I don't care what the world says the message has identified us you know what it has identified us as it has identified us as the people that Peter spoke of in the book of Peter when he said there'll be a people begotten us again unto a lively hope you know what they would have they would have an inheritance Incorruptible what is a jubilee it is a call it is a summons it is a pull to return to an inheritance and the prophet said your inheritance is Incorruptible it's undefiled it fadeth not away it is reserved in heaven for you Ray you might as well Square your shoulders back and tell that therefore you've been telling me you're going to take my inheritance but there ain't no way you can touch it because you didn't give it to me and you can't take it away what are you saying I'm saying you're a people of an inheritance that's Incorruptible it's undefiled your failures hadn't defiled it your mistakes haven't defiled it your trials hadn't defiled it it is an undefiable inheritance oh God hallelujah church I'm not a crazy man I'm an undefiled Holy Ghost Field fire baptized Pillar of Fire following son of the Living God that has not been begotten to some dead hope what I've been through don't change what I got hallelujah what I've been through don't change when I got the trials I faced and the mistakes I've made and the decisions I made does not change what my God reserved for me but I might as well preach that now you know what's that word Incorruptible means it means it has no principles of dissolution or decay in it therefore it must be totally different than this Earth Humble Church your inheritance is not painted with laodicea your inheritance is not painted with your trials among Church your family lineage cannot taint your Incorruptible seed let's hold the inside of your soul ammonium might as well draw your sword and fight back against that Devil he's been telling you you're not going to make it he's been 10 years going to fail but I come to tell you you are recorded in the scripture as a Son of God I said Potter of God with my uncomfortable inheritance of God I'm on church I tell you why that Devil's fighting you like he is because God's been holding you God's been reserving you come on oh God he's been had his hand on you for at times such as this because the very next verse he says who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation and are ready to be revealed in the last time what are you saying preacher I'm saying what Peter said you have been born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever I'm on church I might as well say it you're made out of stuff that is not contaminated with 16 elements of this Earth You Are Made you say preacher I got gray hair and my hair's thinning and my shoulders are stupid I'm not talking about your Humanity I'm talking about your original DNA I'm talking about where you come from I'm talking about oh that was put on the inside of you from before the foundation of the world and if a man is Born the word of God he will produce the word alone that's why that devil tells you you ain't doing much you are you are kicking that devil in the face right now just by being in the house of God on a Monday night with a smile on your face brother Tim we shouldn't be here but we're here anyhow sister Martha we shouldn't be here but we're here anyhow sister Heather we shouldn't be here but we're here anyhow you know why because you got through the trial because there's a jubilee attached to your soul and that Jubilee is drawing you that's why you can be in the middle of the deepest darkest trial and start dancing in the presence of God because there's a greater tug there's a greater influence there's a greater drawing power upon you than is on some Baptist chicken or some Pentecostal back sliding chicken there's a word anointing on you what are you saying I'm saying the seed that's in you is a God created seed and I'm saying this God created that seed inside of you what does Lucifer do oh he said brother remember said Lucifer is the deformer brother Wayne he's the corrupter of that seed he said but when we find out when he come in he deformed that seed he corrupted that seed by getting into the bedding grounds which was Eve are you with me and corrupting that seed with the corruptable seed before it could get there to corrupt that beautiful Garden of Eden but what old dumb Lucifer didn't know is God had a reserve seat what Lucifer didn't know is God had a soul on the earth that had a reserved Incorruptible seed on the inside of it that had had representation in heaven and the prophet said then where Heaven is the only thing that it is it's just the restoration are you ready for this are you ready for this where we are now we are on our road back to that original beginning of the creation of God oh something keeps holding me amen something keeps pulling me something keeps drawing me home I'll tell you what's pulling your church I'll tell you what's drawing you young people amen is a seed only inside of you amen the prophet sent back to the Garden of Eden again husband and wife without any sin or anything to live eternally oh God what is the way back can I tell you the prophet said the way back or the road back is the Holy Ghost he said see than God promised he would see him the Holy Ghost and whenever God sends his blessings and the people reject it that's a place always goes into chaos and just rots in its condition we're sure that the message and the power of God which we all believe in is strange to the world it strings to its way of thinking amen I believe amen our nation has practically done what the rest of them has done but now to honor it and to praise our God we are grateful for what he's given us we are grateful for what he's given us what are you saying I'm saying we are grateful that we did not come here to be identified but before we got here we was already identified Reverend said this in return and Jubilee He said Israel had a portion of inheritance in Palestine right he said see but the portion of inheritance could not be fulfilled by anyone else he said that's why when those babies was being born and the mother and their labor uttered their voices this patriarch he said what happened they positionally placed him in the Palestine amen hundreds of years later when that Mama brother Daniel was screaming out amen the names of those Patriarchs they were not even on the earth yet they was on their way into the Earth but a hundreds of years later what their mama spoke in her labor pains they manifested in their life what are you saying I'm saying even the odd rocks were positionally placed he said what's happened to Men He said God is in his Masterworks he said it's the placing of God shows the master and his Masterworks let me just say this if I'm up here tonight and I say hey like that I just holler out hey amen anybody in here can respond anybody can raise their hand anybody can say what do you need anybody can say what do you want but if I scream out in my pain and I say hey Sean I have just identified by name whose attention I'm trying to get and the prophet of God said them women were not just making noises but they were speaking names they were speaking identification I'm on Church them women called those names in their birth pains what do you saying I'm saying what a prophet said he said Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another look at this word called it means to utter out of out voice it means to call by name it means to give a name it means to receive a name it needs to give someone a name to call his name come on church when you see the word Liberty in the Bible amen you can put your name there because the prophet said before the foundation of the world he said God in his labor pain was bringing forth you knowing what you would do he positionally placed you in his own body to be a housewife to be a farmer a good name to be a preacher he meant to be a prophet to be this he placed you positionally come on Church you didn't stumble into your position but the same God that anointed them mothers to call the names of them Patriarchs is the same God when he hung between the heavens and the Earth and he screamed out the prophet said that was God's labor pains and he was positionally placing you oh help me Jesus what are you saying preacher I'm saying you're not here by accident I'm saying your position didn't get given to you because somebody else couldn't do it I'm saying you've been called in this Jubilee you've been positionally placed in this Jubilee God in his Masterworks has promised to church in the end time that will not be haphasially floating around but they will be a positionally I just got to preacher if that's okay there'll be a positionally placed church he said what did Jesus do Jesus did the works of the father why because the father was in him that God the Father which is in the father of Jesus Christ the great spirit dwelt in the fullness of this power in Jesus Christ which was the Tabernacle of God made Flesh dwelt on Earth representing the word then Jesus was the Tabernacle of God on the earth come on church he was on the Earth but he had an inheritance that was Incorruptible he had a connection he had a he had a position with a father and the brother said Jesus was the word he said so the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word became visible and through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection he has positionally placed his church in that realm then the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible that's why the devil's fighting you with everything he's kind is you are the prepared womb to receive amen that DNA the genos the chemistry the life the token the power of God in this wicked age and to make an invisible God made visible in the age you're living in a bone Church you're not here to stay look at somebody next to you and say Lift Your Head Up you're not here to stay we're going home some of y'all still looking at me you looked at the wrong person lift your head up quit being depressed we're not here to stay we're going home well brother and you don't realize how bad it is I don't care how bad it is you know why because no matter how bad it is there is a cord of Prophecy wrapped around you in this Jubilee age you have heard the trumpet sound your eyes have been opened your ears have been unstopped your tongue has been loose your heart has been freed the shackles have been taken off here what are you saying I'm saying we got an inheritance and we got to go home we can't stay here I'm no church do you realize when Israel was in the mud pits that was the same ones whose mothers had called their names and their birth paints when Israel was in a terrible condition they still had a cord of Prophecy wrapped around them of the promised land I'm on a preacher for a second we'll close Okay think of this when you think of bondage what do you think of you think of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt now Genesis 15 1 says the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abraham I am thus Shield thy exceeding great reward Birmingham said look God led the children of the Israel from down in Egypt up into the promised land no since Genesis 15 12 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a of great Darkness fell upon him and he said in Abram nor the surety that thy seed shall be estranged in land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them for 400 years and also the nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge notice this and afterward shall they come out so many say come out afterward they shall come out with great substance look at this word great substance it is property it is good it is possession it is a general term for all movable Goods of livestock of stores and of utensils in other words he said listen I know you're in bondage I know you're in a terrible condition but I have made a covenant with Father Abraham that you're going to suffer in these conditions but hold on you're not going to stay there you've got identification in the Jubilee you've got identification listen if you don't have inheritance then the Jubilee trumpet means nothing to you if you don't have inheritance if you hadn't lost nothing then you can sleep in church if you hadn't lost nothing these meetings are just taking up your time if you hadn't lost nothing going to church is a burden but if you have lost something and I'll tell you what you lost Amen to our adulterous prayer and Eve we lost our position amen the way we should have come we should have not come to a natural act we should have come to the spoken word amen but in the end time who is this Melchizedek God would send a prophet to tell you that's a reason you cannot be happy with that human spirit that you contacted is because down inside of you was a gene seed attribute of almighty God and it was drawing at you glory to God Israel was in a terrible condition laodicea is a terrible condition babies were being killed by the Terry they were working till their bodies were falling apart how many days brother Wayne did they wonder will Deliverance ever come how many days did they pray and ask God for deliver but I'll tell you what happened there were some older slaves there that would remember the vision there was some older slaves there that would remember the vision and when they got real down they would reach over and get a hold of David's principle you say what is David's principle David's principle is David was greatly distressed and the people spake and stone in him and saw on all the people as Creed every man for his son for his daughters but David Oh Glory to God David encouraged himself in the Lord you know what they had a positive confession I can hear him say God will raise up and deliver I could hear him say his word said he would I could hear him say be strong and be courageous because one day we're leaving here what do you say in church I'm saying quit waiting on somebody to Pat you on the back to say Lord You've encouraged me you've got to reach down sometimes on a Monday night and do something out of character and stand up in the house of God and say that's right preacher I am a part of this message that's right I do have an incorruptible inheritance that's right I'm not a failure I am the victory of almighty God that's right I did not come here to lose I come here to win that's right I did not come here to die underneath the Egyptians I did not come here to die underneath your malachite I come here as a son as a daughter of God as an overcomer of God what are you saying I'm saying you're going to get a hold of yourself and you got to encourage yourself you got to encourage yourself when the battle gets hard you got to encourage yourself you got to start talking about what you're going to you got to start talking about how things are going to be you got to start talking about how things used to be and how used to hurt and how who's to say you got to start saying if God before me then who can be against me you've got to start saying if a thousand fall at one side and ten thousand at the other side it will not come now thee no I'm not up here just trying to preach a sermon I'm preaching a jubilee I'm trying to contain myself sister Ayanna it's a jubilee it's a time to go home it's a time to get above the trials and the tribulations and the burdens and the beatdowns what are you saying I'm saying you've got to reach over get a hold of David's principle and encourage yourself brother Andrew I don't know how it's possible I don't know how it's possible I don't know how we get out of this I'll tell you how you get out of this I'll tell you how you get out of this you got an inheritance and the god that promised you that Heritage is a God that cannot fail and he wrote that inheritance in his word I'm on church God y'all forgive me I'm trying to contain myself but God is the never unfailing god of the Bible what are you saying I'm saying you'll never find one time from Genesis to Revelation from 47 to 65 from the church age book from the seventh syllabus you'll never find one time that's the conditional God ever failed his church when God put something in the scripture he backed it up what he said he would do he has done come on church he is doing or he will do do not let the devil talk you out of the greatest Revival that has ever hit the face of the Earth do not let the devil weaken your potentials town to just being a chicken in a walled City eating a few denominational crumbs and trying to get by you was born from above you was born for this Jubilee well I might as well preach at my brother Mark quit letting that devil tell you that your loved ones ain't going quit letting that devil tell you that you got to leave this behind and leave that behind reach over church and get a hold of Moses his principle and walk up to that devil and say when I leave here I'm not leaving a hook behind big boy get out of my way I'm taking my husband I'm taking my wife I'm taking my babies I'm taking my church not leaving nothing behind this Incorruptible inheritance is tied to the New Jerusalem behold I will send you Elijah can I have a few more minutes I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I would come smile the other curse brother said watch just to confirm his word to you if the messenger of John was the messenger Malachi 4 then the scriptures failed because God said the Earth would be burning stubble righteous would walk out upon the ashes of the wicked so read it right Jesus never said that can I break this down to an evangelistical point right here Jesus never said that a part of this message was brother Bam's opinion Jesus never said the message of Revelation 10 7 was to be picked and taken out but he said it was the infallible thoroughly identified word of almighty God and what are you saying I'm saying right here on a Monday night in the house of God I hear more than the voice of brother Sean I hear more than the singer the brother Samaya I hear more than the playing of brother Kevin I hear more than the amen so brother Wayne I hear more than the amen to Brother Steve or I hear the sound of the Jubilee trumpet I thank God for all the other sounds but oh if we don't have the sound of the Jubilee trumpet we have gathered here in vain you've wasted your time to drive but I tell you tonight friends don't you let the devil back you off of one potential this meeting you got a right to rise up brother Matthew and put your foot on your inheritance and tell that long tongue line Slew Foot devil take your hands off of my property take your hands off of my family take your hands off of my church take your hands off of my dance take your hands off of my Shout what are you saying I'm saying the trumpet's not going to sound the trumpet is sounding the Bible said the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself for the battle remember so what is that trumpet he said that trumpet is the gospel and when you hear the sound of the Jubilee trumpet the gospel you can go free the Jubilee trumpet is not an uncertain sound it is your freedom it is your pardon it is not an emotion it is not a gift it is not a sensation it is a certain Vindicated manifested infallible word of almighty God I'm on church I tell you why we're shouting tonight brother Terry because this trumpet is not just sounding in our heads it's sounding in our heart would there be anybody here tonight that would say oh God I'm ready to Rejoice I'm ready to Proclaim Liberty I'm ready to praise God I'm ready to shake off the heaviness I'm ready to shake off this lukewarm sour down condition I'm ready to be more than just a Pew Center I'm ready to be a messiah I'm ready to be more than a weak beat down to Phoenix Hunter daughter of God I'm ready to be a Victorious product of the revelation of the age that is pierced my generation what are you saying I'm saying if we had nothing brother Mark to be turned to if we had nothing to return to then the trumpet would mean nothing to us but the reason why God brother Mark the reason why is she got a mom over there and you got a daddy over there come on church I tell you why this trumpet means something to you it's cause you got something over there and it's pulling at you it's drawing at you what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's trolling you back to your original inheritance brother Terry brother Terry it's drawing us we're not pushing our way we're not forcing our way it's drawing back to a Pentecostal inheritance remember said the Pentecostal experience is your possession he said see amen I'm gonna I'm gonna tie this together right here in the days of the voice of the seventh Angels when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished in other words the pardon would be delivered to the church you can wake up and realize you did not become a son you did not become a seed you you all wait come on Church underneath the voice of the seventh angel what's the come on Leviticus 25 right in the 10th month of the seventh day brother Shema I don't believe my God writes scripture by accident in the tenth day of the seventh month among what is revelation 10 in the Revelation the 10th chapter and the seventh verse is the same scripture the prophet said when he begins to sound we'll declare war on every devil come on now we'll declare war on every devil what are you saying I'm saying church you can rise up and we can go home no I'm not talking about Garlic Road I'm not talking about Reiner I'm not talking about Pilate I'm talking about eternity I'm talking about the place where we were born from oh God what are you saying I'm saying this amen it's time to go forward look at somebody next to you and say it's time to go forward time to go forward I know you was born in sin I know I was shaping iniquity but there's a sound of a trumpet that's what I'm saying he said God through his grace has declared it's a Year of Jubilee He said oh we were under alone we are sold in sin our parents sowed us out to the sin in the Garden of Eden we were Laden of the bonds of sin and slave to the devil we were born that way there was nothing we could do to help us oh our whole makeup our whole nature everything we are is sin but when the Jubilee time comes when the Jubilee time comes we are free what he's saying I'm saying remember what he said you don't owe any debts at all you're no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free the whole emancipation of proclamation is done signed and you are free what are you saying ye shall know the truth what is truth the word you shall know the word and the word shall make you free listen to me tonight friends we are not here tied down any longer we are not a bunch of pigs like Peter spoke of wallowing in the mire we have got a vision we've got a direction can I close with this I find it amazing Birmingham comes to return in Jubilee and says this closing out yes sir they made a rational mistake when they did that and they wondered for 40 years that's exactly what they done they wondered for 40 years when they wasn't over five days away from the promised land it's about 40 miles from the Red Sea to where they Cross Jordan he could walk that in three four days been in the promised land but they made their own choice listen the church would have been a church tonight glorious without spotter wrinkle if the fathers would have accepted and stayed with the holy spirit that God brought to them when they come out of them organizations but they went right back into the like a dog to its vomit in a hog to a swallow they went right back again to that and now we've wandered around for 50 years wandering in the wilderness come on pray tell me amen if you're wondering are you going somewhere if you're wondering do you have a direction if you're wondering come on come on brothers look straight ahead but you know what it's like when you're driving down the road and that GPS says turn left and you say no I've been down here before and I'll go this way and five minutes later you're in the ditch on the side of a mountain and you look over and she says well that you're wondering you're going in circles you have nothing to put come on Church you have no Direction but the prophet said right there that time come when God said this you have been on this mountain long enough can I close out here you've been on this mountain long enough come on we're going over I tell you what that is brother Walker that's David's principle get a hold of it Church we've been on this mountain long enough we were not it's not the promised Mountain it's the promised land we've been around this mountain I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna put it in four-wheel drive and bog down and preacher for a second because I think it's time we turn northward and go forward I think it's time that it's a church we turn northward and go forward I think his time as a preacher we turn northward and come on church I think it's time as fathers leading families in this wicked age that we turn northward and we go forward we've talked about the land we've heard sermons about the land we've looked over the land we've studied the land but now somebody say now but now it is time to possess the land I'm on church now it's time to possess the inheritance you say what are you saying I'm saying there is a land the prophet of God said you're a candidate to follow the Church of God home through the Wilderness tourney into the promised land and our promised land is found in John 14. amen the pitifier the same pitifier that led Israel from Egypt to the promised land is the same pitifier God that fed Israel manner the Promised Land Is Ours it's time to possess it can you say amen I said the Promised Land Is Ours it's time to possess it what's in the Promised Land seven Divine virtues and somebody's going to possess them what's in the promised land I'll tell you what's in there it's love is Joy it's peace it's somebody's going to possess it Prophet said listen the promised land is to live in this land of the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit are you ready for this it's another world it's another land you have to come out of the conditions you've been in to come out and live in this Promised Land I got here a little too late you got to come out of the conditions you've been in to live in this Promised Land it got to come out of that unforgiveness to live in the land of a human you got to come out of the land of bitterness to live in the land with the love of God has returned to human flesh come on Church you got to get out of the condition you've been in to live in the promised land and to receive the promise remember you shall receive power from on high after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you and Peter said that promise was made all them to The Testament only knew can I say this to you can I say it to you old and new you find promising on up to that day of the Pentecost 50. Jubilee sound the trumpet you find it promising all the way up to that day and then they entered into the promise what are you saying I'm saying Church you've compassed this mountain long enough you've wore it out you know ever Crook and cranny I mean you know everything about this mountain listen I know where I'm standing it's time to go northward read to the first two chapters of it on me I'm born in a few minutes here read through the first two chapters who did honor me on this side of Jordan in the land of Moab Moses began to declare the law saying the Lord Our God spake unto Horeb saying ye have dwelt in this mountain long enough turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and to all the places they're into in the plane in the hills and the veil in the South by the seaside to the land of the Canaanites unto Lebanon under the great river Euphrates behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which The Lord's Prayer unto your fathers Deuteronomy 1 21 behold the Lord thy God has set the land before thee come on Church the land is not behind us the land is in front of us the land is not a day gone by it's not a wealthy things would have went this way and if it come on church let the past be the past the land is in front of us you got a possession you got an inheritance you got to possess it oh go up and possess it as the Lord God of thy father said to thee fear not neither be discouraged can I close with this verse can I close with this in Deuteronomy 2 3 ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward you've come past it long enough turn northward Let It Go go well so and so sad and this one preaching Let It Go you gotta land to go I did not read one suggestion in Deuteronomy 1 or Deuteronomy 2 but I did read some orders I did reach some marching orders and those orders said go forward it's the year the hour the time the season of Jubilee what are you saying brother I'm saying we are not waiting on the Jubilee trumpet to sound it has sounded we are not waiting on marching orders brother Mark we have him what is those marching orders brother Wayne the message of the hour and

to been good to be here good to have all of our visitors and [Music] can't name them all but I I certainly appreciate you ministers brother Mark brother Tim brother Steve and your congregations coming and just being apart and we're just looking for greater things we want to keep brother Andrew and brother Wayne in our prayer that the Lord will just give them strength amen and you know the devil's as the prophet said the devil's trying to keep men like that out of the pulpits and whether it's physically mentally or whatever it would be just trying to attack and I know brother Andrew who's got a sore throat and yet he pressed past that to preach to us tonight I appreciate men that'll just push past it all amen just so that we could hear the word of God Amen they spend their time in this message and and not just to learn but they do it because they've got a burden there's a gift that God's placed within them for us a man that when they would open their mouth to preach it would be the message of the hour amen because it's the message that is quickening changing our lives so we certainly appreciate that and throughout this week at the every end of service uh as far as the ministers they probably ain't going to be visiting much with you uh and it's not because of being snobs or whatever it's it's mainly just because of the weather and to uh they want to preserve their strength as as they've got several nights to preach and so you just have to Pardon that and at the end of the meeting we'll we'll have a ball and have Fellowship amen and so we certainly love you remember service tomorrow night at seven o'clock and tell your friends to come amen we've got the the most greatest message ever and they need to hear this the coming of the Lord is here amen and something that can be said and I just pray and I know that God will give give them understanding of what is being said he's just that way isn't he and so God bless you love you appreciate you and let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and brother Mark you want to come and Lead user dismiss us in prayer foreign
