we're going to turn to the Book of Revelations uh the 18th chapter and um it's a um scripture that is personal to us in this day and I believe it speaks to our hearts amen and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord amen father Lord as we have come to worship you and to magnify you father we pray Lord that you feel at home Among Us father and feel welcome we certainly don't want you to come and we leave you in the corner with dirty feet father the Lord um we're we asking now that you would just uh move Among Us Lord and speak Words of Life Lord father if

Lord now we pray that you would just bless the reading and the speaking of your word and bless the hearer in Jesus Christ's name amen revelation the 18th chapter we're going to start at the first verse but it says and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and of and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of her fornication the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and their mergent um and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not part Akers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues amen you can have your seats this evening and um I want to maybe just speak uh use the title coming out of Babylon and um I I realize uh that uh we're we're you know we on internet and and we've got um different ones you know around in our community that that uh listen in on our services and uh we find that U you know uh a lot of folks are are looking for answers today um um we're we're seeing nothing today but a mass confusion and uh and we're very well aware of that uh not just just in the media but um uh in religion politics and and just everywhere and no one knows who to believe or what to believe or uh you know but uh I think that there's got to be some answers I think that I don't think that we're wasting time here in this earth and um you know uh uh God doesn't want us toss to and fro by every wind of Doctrine as the Bible would would put it and uh but yet there are so many different ideas so many different teachings and doctrines and and they're all floating around uh being purported as as Truth uh but uh uh how how can it be all truth when when they're contradicting one one another and so uh with this uh it would it would be nice if if we just had one voice one uh as as it was in the days of Acts uh the day of Pentecost it was uh one one Faith one Lord one Doctrine one baptism and uh but but we're in this leodys and age where it's just uh nothing but just confusion and so people don't know what to do there there are a lot of things being said and taught uh yet but the truth isn't being made known uh and and so what people are believing and teaching are are things that have never been proven to be absolute truth and and and in order for it to be an absolute it has to be proven to be true uh if it's going to be the absolute truth and and so uh uh we find that you know someone might interpret it uh to fit their way of life and uh uh but that will never you know uh uh be changed be able to change absolute truth cannot be changed no matter way what happens um and and truth no matter what age uh and how long it takes and and the world may change society may change um uh people's uh thinking may change but the word of God the truth can never change it can never be altered no matter what so we don't want to hang our soul on conspiracy theories uh that and and and I'm sure you've probably talk to those that are conspiracy theorists and uh and everything is is they they they is is you know well they I I know they doing it this way and I know they mean it this way and I know they done it that way and and but but have no proof of it uh but so they build their whole life uh on on conspiracies and and so uh and we we cannot afford to put our future into the hands of something that is not truth and and because life isn't a game that we're playing uh this is not a playing field it's it's life is real and and not only that the future is is real uh our destination is real and there is life after death there there there is a real heaven and a real hell there is a real white Throne judgment there there is there there is a real uh Rapture the Rapture is going to happen there is going to be a real Millennium um uh there you know and and and there's going to be a real tribulation and that is at hand right now and so what what we are seeing uh the world uh you know falling apart and and the things that are going on it's not just a stage in life it's it's it's act there's answers to why all of these things are happening and and so you know but you know what what we are seeing in this age is the Fulfillment of second Thessalonians 2:8 uh where Paul would say uh then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power uh signs and lying wonders with all deceitfulness uh uh and of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved ain't that right see and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie and that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness now if you look at this in the Amplified uh Bible it it says that God sends them a misleading uh influence uh a working of a error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false and and so th this is actually uh what what is happening in this age and this also uh uh Falls in line with what Revelations 317 says of this Le Odyssey and age thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not everybody say knowest not knowest not that thou art rich Ed miserable poor blind and naked so they are believing it to be truth but the spirit of Truth says it's a lie it's false so so they're believing something that is false and yet the god of Truth the spirit of truth truth itself is saying no it's it's not right what you're believing is actually a lie now we we could go on another one uh and and I just maybe uh laying a foundation as to why all of the confusion uh 2 Timothy 4:3 it says uh Paul would say the time will come the time will come and we can truly say that time has come now is that when they the people will not endure or tolerate sound Doctrine but after their own lusts after their own taste their own wishes shall they Heap to themselves teachers now this word Heap is is multiplication so they they will they will have a multiplication of teachers or ministers uh like they they'll become a dime a dozen and and it's just more and more and more as time goes and and they'll Heap unto themselves a multiplication of teachers having itching ears now the Amplified says of this want they're wanting something pleasing and gratifying so they will gather to themselves one teacher after another chosen of by them of themselves chosen to satisfy their own liking and to Foster the errors that they hold so so this is exactly what we're seeing today so it goes on they will choose ministers who will coincide with their whims who Foster e ever uh uh uh vager which might enter their imagination who will count countenance every wild project for doing good who will be the advocate of the or who will Advocate the errors which they hold and who would be afraid to rebuke their faults and and so th this is this is why they they they he unto themselves multiply and this this is why so many uh people are invading the the pulpits and and uh uh uh uh is because they want someone to Foster their error you know and and so it it's that way and so uh uh this is the principles upon by which people choose their their ministers and and and the pastor and teachers and and such you see and and notice there uh Paul would say and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned un fables ain't that right so so in other words they will turn aside from hearing the truth and will wander off into myths and man-made fictions one commentator said the true principle should be to select those who will Faithfully declare the truth and who will not shrink from exposing and denouncing sin wherever it may be found ain't that right so so we we look at this this is a part of of of Babylon uh uh and this misleading influence that is coming uh that is here uh it comes in the form of false Christ's false anointed ones ain't that right for for for Christ means anointed so Matthew 24 and 24 uh Jesus prophesied of this very same thing and says for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets false teachers and and false uh whatever and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so what this means is that we're living in the greatest deception ever ever known and there are scriptures that testify of the age of of of of that we're living in and it's it's a it's a glorious age but yet it's an age of confusion there's more confusion than ever and and it's it's it's because Satan has been able to to preach his gospel amen which is not another gospel ain't that right uh it's it's just falsehood it's it's it's just a a a message of lies and so in this day that we are living in we see uh uh uh amamos 11-2 being fulfilled and it says behold the days come sayth the Lord that I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall Wander from sea to Sea and from the North even to the East and they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it now you think of that why will they not find it because the places they're looking for the word isn't there it it's just the facts ain't that right see they're they're looking in places that the word isn't there and and so now we have a multiplication of churches we have a multiplication of uh seminars and and uh uh conferences we have a multiplication of programs in the church and and and and all of these things uh and and yet the true-hearted people cannot find truth I still believe that there's people searching for truth I I just believe that I I believe that they're wanting to know truth and and and but yet they don't know where to find the truuth they they're they're they're looking and and and I think this is why it behooves us to know where we stand and to declare what we do know am because what we know is not just something that has come up uh that was just conjured up by man but it was proven over and over and over by God and it's a scriptural Vindication can you say amen and so uh uh they're seeking to find answers and so yes the the church um uh the world uh everything is falling apart and people are truly concerned uh I've never seen a time I I I don't guess of people are just full of questions as to what is happening what's going on what's what what and not only just with uh uh politics and and religion and all that but they they want to know because for themselves as to what their future is where do they stand or where where can they stand on something solid amen because you know uh people get into sports but you look look at the sports uh uh they're just as as as wicked and evil as everything else Sports used to be a good thing it used to be a wholesome thing and but but look look look at everything but but even look at the preachers that are just falling left and right uh uh uh in religion and and so what it's doing it's causing people to think look look at our Politics the way it's at today people used to just you know and and there are people so caught up in politics and things but then there are true-hearted people that are saying but hold it I'm not finding the answers really what is that candidate which one can really give me the answers well they don't have the answers uh uh uh but but we there there are answers but people are concerned about what's happening in Israel they're they're concerned about what's happening in this na and and World abroad amen look at Russia look look at China look at look at all these things that are uh things are uh happening and and so they're they're concerned about what's happening in the home what's happening in the schools what's what's happening in in in the family what's happening to the young people of this day and and what's happening to marriages and and all of these things people are going crazy and and we all know that right and uh uh it doesn't take long for you to uh uh live to know that that uh when you come to an understanding that people's about lost their minds amen and so uh uh but but one would think that well all a person would have to do is just read the Bible and uh uh uh and and they'll know truth but that's not true uh we've had this Bible for years and years and years and and and so uh uh uh the thing is is men have so shredded the truth of the word with their own opinions that truth is is lost to uh uh to so many and and and and yet how many out there that has their Bibles and and yet cannot uh see the truth because their own ideas of this Bible has blinded them and and they're they're looking at it in the wrong way ain't that right you see you you can't read the Bible like you would a newspaper or a magazine or a western book or or some other book you you cannot read the Bible this that way and and comprehend because this is a supernatural book can can you say Amen it it's a supernatural book and and and and it's truth everybody say it's truth there's nothing wrong with this Bible at all it's it's men that that makes this uh uh it's the problem is is with mankind uh uh but but the word is truth but but notice the truth has to be revealed the the truth has to be revealed or a man will actually not see it even though it's in the word of God Amen it it's true look uh uh 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I have not seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared uh for them that love him ain't that right everything that God has prepared for us is in this word right here it's it's here in the Bible but I cannot uh see it ear cannot hear it neither can it enter into the heart of man to where he can comprehend it uh because it takes God to reveal it to us ain't that right and and so the natural mind will never be able to see those things even though he reads it he could read it uh once a year twice a year 50 times a year and will never be able to understand it except God himself reveals it see because it says here the 10th verse but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things aren't you glad for that the spirit searcheth things that that that the are natural eye cannot see the spirit revealeth things that the natural eye will never ever be able to catch or the natural mind and says see see God hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things everybody say deep things the Deep things of God see for what man know the things of man except uh the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so then we go to Matthew 13:14 Jesus says and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah uh which saith by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive see you can hear it and still not understand it you can see it and yet not under uh uh uh uh perceive it see and he says see for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed not natural but spiritual lest at any time they should see with their eyes hear with their ears and should understand with not hear but with their heart and when they hear it there and be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear so not everybody in the world is going to be blinded not everybody in the world is not is is going to be deaf not everybody in the world is going to be just have their heart blinded to where they can't perceive there are those that can hear and and and and and can see and they are are blessed are you blessed are you blessed we sing that song I am blessed I am blessed well uh uh you you you don't have to have a boat to to be blessed you don't have to have money in the bank to be blessed but if your eyes can see if your ears can hear amen the word of God if your heart can perceive the things of God you are blessed above all ain't that right now in John 16:12 Jesus said I have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now so he's not he did not reveal it to them at that time many things but notice he will and he tells when how be it when the spirit of Truth he he the spirit of Truth not a sensation not an emotional workup not somebody dancing and shouting but it's actually a person he not they he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you everybody say he will guide he will guide you into all truth see for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you now that Spirit of Truth we I believe and I I'm sure you do too that is Jesus Christ do you believe that the spirit of Truth is none other than Jesus Christ amen for he says I am the way the truth and the life ain't that right and we could go more into that but but here notice John 14:16 and I will pray the father notice he knows how important it is for the spirit of Truth to come uh because now he's praying I pray the father that he shall give you another comforter now notice this way of comforting it's not comforting us and and to keep us from trouble to keep us from danger to keep us from heartaches we've all had our share of heartaches we've all shed tears we've all we've all had times that we didn't know what to do and and and and uh you know you know we've we've had trials and testings and all that so but but so he this comforter wouldn't keep us from them things that's not the way of comfort we would comfort is to to keep our children from danger to keep them protected away from the evil and to where that you know if if if there're if they're sick I'd say man I I I wish I could take that upon myself you understand what I'm saying that would the Comfort I would give them is try to take that away from them if if they're broke if I've got the money I want to give it to them I want to help them and and and these things but that's not the comfort that he's talking about here but notice what he says he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth so there's the comforter the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him you're comforted can you say Amen you're comforted because you know him and for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I notice I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so he's the spirit of Truth he's the comfort in all and notice the the time that we need need that comforter most is now in the time of confusion in the time of so many different ideas so many different ways to go and and who do I believe he Comforts Us by coming to us in us as the spirit of Truth he is guiding us into truth all truth is our comfort amen G and you say amen amen so we we find that notice I will come to you the spirit of truth comes and this coming fulfills what Jesus said in Matthew and and uh um uh or maybe we we could look uh uh Luke 21:25 and it says and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of Nations and we're here with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear there's never been an age like this age where people are filled with fear not just one person or a community or a a different group but the world is filled with fear amen see why for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaking that's happening today do you believe that but notice and then shall they see the coming or the son of man coming uh in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass look up that's your command is look up for your Redemption draweth nigh do you believe that so the spirit of Truth coming to us is the son a man coming to us with power and great Glory coming in a cloud with power and great glory amen now we know that this is not a physical coming this this coming of Jesus Christ is not the physical coming because in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 Paul says the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the air to meet the Lord can you say Amen see so we're going to meet him in not a spirit amen we're not going to meet a spirit in the air we're going to meet the Lord in the air in his physical uh uh body I believe that now we do believe in the physical coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so the Bible never said that Jesus will put his feet upon the Earth in his physical being physical body uh uh before the Rapture takes place Jesus does not come to the Earth until the Millennium can you say Amen which is after the Rapture takes place and when the Rapture takes place the bride is gone it's out of here and the tribulation sets in amen see so then what we see then coming to us is the spirit of Truth truth the spirit of Truth coming to us he doesn't need to come in his physical body here upon the Earth at that this time because he's got a body here upon the Earth which is the church for he said I will come to you and I will be in you ain't that right so this coming is the spirit of truth right now we see this coming is tied with Revelations 101 one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire ain't that right and we know this is Christ this is Christ descending that Mighty Angel he's got the rainbow which means he's a he's the Covenant one ain't that right that's the spirit of Truth and he cried with a loud voice amen in other words the voice was strong it in other words it was a voice of authority it was an authoritative voice it wasn't just some little old wimpy voice it was a voice with authority am ain't that right see and and when we compare scripture with scripture then we see that when this happens there will be the seventh angel upon the Earth at the same time at the is coming uh uh Revelations 10:7 amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets ain't that right see so so now notice if you just bear with me for a moment but we do not hear the an uh uh uh the the voice of the mighty Angel uh uh of Revelation 10:1 audibly it's not an audible voice voice uh maybe but we do hear the voice of the seventh angel can you say amen amen see the voice of the seventh Angels see and and we're talking about the spirit of Truth descending amen and he utters but what we hear is the voice uh of the seventh angel amen and and we know that see uh that that the mighty Angel is speaking through him because it's a voice voice of authority can you say Amen this message is a voice of authority that's right it's a voice of authority it'll change your life amen sure will so the spirit of Truth given out the Revelation notice giv out the Revelation through the seventh angel messenger remember when he begins to sound the m of God should be finished if I could say it this way confusion is over looking at the word and probing at it and taking this idea and that idea and that idea it's over ain't that right for the voice of of authority amen we found out that you know the pope thinks he's the voice of authority but but we found out he's really not the voice of authority he might be a a voice of authority over over his subjects but he's not the voice of authority over the elect amen amen can you say Amen so so we find but it it's it's at this time of of all of this this coming the spirit of Truth coming the seventh angel sounding Out the message and and the Mystery of God being finished being revealed being being uh uh fulfilled uh uh all of these things uh uh at that time the church is commanded to come out of Babylon ain't that right and and and and when we say Church we're talking about the elect of God Amen because remember he didn't just say come out people he said my people come out of her my people ain't that right that's right see just just as much as Elijah you know when he he's preaching to Jezebel and they and the nation and all of that and he got discouraged and he said Lord I'm the only one else I'm the only one left and just take my life and and God reminded him no I I have 7,000 reserved that have not bowed a knee to bail that's that people that's going to come out of Babylon it's a people that God has reserved unto himself amen all the confusion has not been able to touch him has not been able to scar them have not been able to so deform them that God can't reach them amen so he sends the spirit of Truth and this day the seventh angel begins to sound amen and come out of her my people come out and there's a people coming out aren't you glad you're out come out of her yes what a blessing it is to stand and not be confused go through this life and not be confused confusion everywhere confusion where boys and girls don't even know what they are confusion amen amen it's true so re again if you look Revelations 18:4 I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people well what is that that's a Heavenly voice a voice of authority amen come out it didn't say would you please come out come out of her we hear a voice saying House of Hell give way ain't that right see so now if you look at it the New Testament calls the elect of God the the Church of Jesus Christ according to Matthew 16:18 Jesus promised to build his church he's building his church and and according to to Zachariah and and other scriptures we find that that we're at the finishing up of that church amen he's not at the groundw work the groundw work started on the day of Pentecost acts 22 amen and and and started there and God had been working and building up until now at this last lotan age amen at the time of rapture at the time of a body change at at the time of adoption of sons at the time when the earth is trembling and and and and Paul would say Amen uh uh he he going to shake the heavens and the Earth and and uh and there'll be a voice that does that shaking right amen the voice The Voice amen when he begins to sound that voice of the mighty Angel when he declares of Revelation 10:1 time shall be no more amen that voice will now shake the heavens and earth amen but and that which can be shaken will be shaken and that which can re remain will remain ain't that right amen and during all of this we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken manifestation of sons of God adopted Sons coming to the right position not confused and this church is built upon Revelation Revelation in Ephesians uh the the chapter one Paul says that the church is the body of Jesus Christ and is the fullness of him that filth all and all Ephesians 5:23 tells us that Christ is the head of the church Ephesians 5:27 tells us that Christ is going to present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish that's the church can you say amen amen and the way it could happen is the spirit of Truth come amen well the Bible talks about the washing of the water of the world it's the word that washes us it's the word that bled for us it's the word that cleanses us it's the word amen that brings us to Perfection ain't that right so we needed the spirit of Truth we needed something Amen to cleanse us from all the filth of the world that's right now the this church that is mentioned in the New Testament is it means called out Church means called out so when Israel was in Egypt as long as they were in Egypt in another land in another country under slavery then they were the children of God but when God called them out they became the Church of God ain't that right see they became the Church of God now the Bible says and and that God will take a people out of the Gentiles for his name all right take take him out take him out of what that Babylonian system take him out of the filth and the world and all that call them out how's he going to take them out by a voice the spirit of Truth crying out come out of her amen and you say amen amen call them out to bear his name and to manifest his name but as we see we couldn't come out without without a voice calling us out you just did we didn't stumble into this we we we we we didn't just say well I'm I'm just leaving everything and I'm just no no that that's not it you know uh uh uh it it it took a voice to call us out and and it's the same voice that called Lazarus out of the Grave Lazarus come forth it's the same voice that told them loose him and let go it's the same voice can you say amen and it's the same voice that calling us out of Babylon come out of her my people and Jesus says my sheep hear my voice my sheep hear my voice can you say amen he has to speak and the Sheep follow him that's right yes sir so it's not a voice of denomination it's not a voice of intellect it's not a voice it's the spirit of Truth can you say Amen his voice is his word do you believe that his voice is his word now Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing will'll do nothing but he first or but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amen so a prophet is important to us amen and we I'm sure we know these things but it's good just go back and really reaffirm our our faith and our belief in these things but a a when when a prophet comes to the Earth it is a sign that God is ready to speak he's not there to tickle our fancy he's not there to get us emotionally worked up he's not there just to see how big of a crowd he can he can bring and and all of these things he's there because God sent him cuz God is ready to speak to his people amen if God isn't going to speak then there would be no need for a prophet to be on earth ain't that right so a God sent Prophet is God's voice on the earth amen and that scripture now Moses was God's was the voice of God to the people in his day Noah was God's voice to the people in his day Elijah was God's voice to the people in his day Elisha was the voice of of God to the people in in in his day Jeremiah is Isaiah Ezekiel they were God's voice the prophets were God's voice Amen to the people of their day do you believe that Jesus even said that the prophets were sent of God yes sir when he walked uh uh with the two on the road to Aus he called them fools he called them fools and slow of heart to to believe all everybody say all that the prophets had spoken right amen see if you don't believe all that the prophets have spoken see why would you believe all that the prophets have spoken why would you put your whole future and your whole life into what the prophets have spoken because the word of God came to them and the word of God cannot fail ain't that right slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken see in Luke 24:44 Jesus said all things everybody say all things must be fulfilled all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me see why because the word of the Lord come to the prophet and Jesus himself being God knew that it was his word that come to them amen they spoke his word word not their word and he knew it had to come to pass he so knew that the word come to pass he knew that God honors the word of a Vindicated prophet he knew that he based his whole entire Ministry on what the prophets of the Old Testament said he based his entire future upon the words of the prophets amen for John 2:19 Jesus said unto them destroy this Temple and with in 3 days I will raise it up again well what is he saying amen he went back and knew what a prophet had said of the Old Testament therefore he believed that prophet and he declared to them that you can kill me but I will raise again in three days for Psalms amen uh uh 16:10 for thou wi not leave my so in Hell neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption amen Jesus knew that that scripture spoke of him a prophet a man a man yet speaking an eternal word and here come God himself made flesh which was the word amen and he would go back to that prophecy and he would base his entire future upon that amen you can determine to kill me but I will rise again because it's spoken by the word of a prophet can you say amen amen in other words he wasn't confused he understood the words of a prophet so he wasn't confused with the church of that day he wasn't confused with their ideology and their interpretations of the scripture amen oh thank God for that amen see so the spirit of God was speaking right through that prophet and the words that came from the prophet became Jesus Christ absolute right are you with me now the words that came out of that Prophet Jesus took it for his absolute that's right yes sir all I can say is this message is our absolute it may not be yours but it is mine can you say Amen now if you look at at Luke 2445 speaking of of where he's he told them old fo slow of heart to believe all that the prophets said now notice then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures so he didn't just leave them in the dark he didn't just leave them wondering in confusion as to what is going on but by mercy and Grace he opened their understanding that they could come out of the confusion and now understand what has to happen Hallelujah no longer confused about what to believe and what to uh uh to follow Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet amen right who who wrote it who who whose word is this has to be the word of God came forth from a prophet speaking of a prophet ain't that right behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and and we we ain't going to get into all of that but we we know that beyond the shot of a doubt that that applies for our day in this age can you say amen and so then and uh a prophet is always God's way everybody say it's always God's way a prophet is always God's way of making his voice known to his people thus the seventh angel is God's Prophet God Amen can you say Amen when God sends his prophet and gives a sign then it takes his voice and then takes his voice that began being spoken before on his word and vindicates it by this man and they know that it's his voice because it's the promised word of the day so again the prophet would tell us the coming of a prophet is a sign that's overlooked by the people every time they Overlook it they can they never get it somehow L it's those uh who are got their eyes open to see it and those who are elected to see it it does see it does see it God ain't going to waste his time God ain't wasting his time sending the prophet in this age ain't that right right the M majority of the world don't believe it and some in the message you know are scared of it and afraid to Proclaim it but God ain't wasting his time there is going to be an elect that holds to this we all to shout of it doubt because they they're not confused amen can you say Amen now in our opening scripture we can see that this isn't just a casual coming out you just didn't happen to come out amen but this is a Deliverance yes come out of her my people what was it it's a time of Deliverance for God's people amen can you say amen that's right see it's a message this what is this message of of the day it's message of Deliverance amen that's remember at the first Exodus Moses come with the message of Deliverance not to leave the people there but to come out of her it's time to come out there's a promise that that we've got to obtain to that there there are things for you there's an inheritance for you you got to come out to go into so is it in this day in this Third Exodus it's time to come out it's a message of Deliverance amen you believe it see so so God's message has always been a message of Deliverance Just Before Destruction Moses come with the message of Deliverance Joshua even he came with the message of Deliverance oh my just when they were getting ready to take that city of Jericho there was an ele in them walls hallelujah amen so the message would not destroy everybody but there was that message that would rescue that he let thank God for the message lot had Deliverance before Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed hello that's what a prophet said just quoting him right so now notice in this 18th vers or chapter two Revelations 18:2 he cried mightily with a strong voice am it didn't say loud it said strong yet it's the same thing see he cried mightily with a strong voice which is again voice of authority amen and you say Amen so then we know that this has to be the voice of God for that is the only voice amen with authority the word of God is the only thing that's got Authority in your life do you believe that when it speaks it brings things into existence when it speaks even death has to flee even trouble has to flee remember on the boat the voice of God spoke through that human body and said peace be still and the winds and the waves immediately calm down and they listen to the voice of their creator you believe it it's a voice of authority now notice the voice of authority screamed out Babylon the great is Fallen is fallen and is become now notice the habitation The Dwelling Place the house of devils and the hold I looked up that word it it means a watching a guarding hence imprisonment Ward a keeping it it's become the hold a a prison of every f inure spirit and a cage or a dungeon of every unclean and hateful Bird right can you say Amen see so those who are in Babylon are spiritually Bound by demonic powers on now amen hello yes that's why it's the voice of Deliverance it's a message of Deliverance in this day you could not come out except a voice greened right yes that voice of authority over your life right and notice how it was exercised in this age the voice of authority it challenged every spirit said I'd take every Spirit under my in under my control every Spirit it didn't matter if that Spirit was in a in a in in in the physical real where even the doctors could not do anything with it that voice of author was peing that devil had to leave it didn't matter if it was if it was a drunk woman an alcoholic what was her name Rosier Rosella Rosella trying everything her life was wrecked but when the voice spoke it brought a Deliverance to that woman can you say Amen see so this this this authoritative voice is exposing what Babylon is and and you remember John called it mystery babyon and and mystery is something not understood it's it's confusion everything about Babylon is confusion that's that's exactly what it means the word Babylon means confusion it's something that's not understood mysterious secretive Beyond understanding but now it's no longer mystery to that elect where it's been exposed as to what it is can you say Amen those who have heard the voice yes sir see so in Revelations 1:10 talks about the voice of God is as a trumpet I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice Still's talking about the spirit of Truth Now a voice as a great trumpet see and and and then if you look at at Revelations 4:1 after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up pther see so the voice of God was like unto a trumpet look look at at uh 1 Corinthians 15 and 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet see at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound that voice of God shall speak that voice of authority is going to speak and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed now we know when when in the Bible when the trumpet sounded there they had urgency it wasn't just just a blow it it had urgency and and it called the people together can you say Amen sir it's it's you know it's it's like the herald uh the king's messenger coming to the people he blows on the trumpet it's an urgent call and and the people gather around to listen see it it was the sounding of the trumpet that calls Israel together now brother Braham says trumpet always denotes war or a feast day ain't that right Jeremiah 4:19 says I cannot hold my peace because thou has heard oh my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of War man amen what's caused political disturbances what's caused the religious disturbances what's caused the the national International War World disturbances and all that a trumpet has sounded the voice of God has sounded it amen demons upon every hand yeah it's a raging of War raging of War can you say amen amen this the Satan's kingdom has been Disturbed Satan's kingdom has been challenged in this day are you with me he's been able to keep people from age after age after age every time God would send a Revival amen uh uh uh Satan's stronghold would be able to bring him back into captivity but it's in this age there is a people that'll never go back the voice of God has broken the Cycles broken the Cycles yes sir yes sir so this voice has caused a disturbance a a a a spiritual war we understand that 200,000,000 demons as as as mentioned in Revelations have been loosed in the ecclesiastical Rim can you say Amen so so why why is all this because there is is a people that Satan thought he had Satan thought he could destroy but a voice of authority has said come out of her amen that's right that's right darkness is gathering itself to fight the light can you say Amen the forces of Darkness you see when a man is confused he he doesn't know where he's going doesn't know what to believe who to believe he's unable to deser burn between right and wrong this is one of the things that that you know causes Amnesia has been caught between two opinions and buddy that's been so in this age you know you're hearing this and you hear you hear God's word and then you hear what Satan says you're Son of God and and then Satan says well you're not a Son of God the voice of God says you're going in Rapture and Satan says well you're not going into Rapture you're just full of mistakes and if you keep catching in between them opinions you're going to have amnesia yeah amen can you say Amen but the message is not just to teach us intellect it's to call us out of Babylon call us out to shake that Amnesia why because the sons of God are recognizing who they are they're not being caught in Amnesia forgetting what they are where they belong and all that no we are understanding more and more we came from God we're going back to God we always were a Son of God you always were a daughter of God you always were saved you always were beloved in the eyes of God can you say Amen am see so God is calling us out of the confusion to where we have full Assurance everybody say full Assurance full Assurance to know what truth is amen do you believe that amen amen as we get ready to wind down in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by amen but Satan came in through the serpent and he misrepresented the word amen he he spoke what God Said but then he misrepresented that ain't that right yes sir he misrepresented he didn't just tell an outright lie amen and that's what the Bible says that God would send them strong delusion that they'd believe the lie the LIE amen not just an outright lie of standing behind p and say God doesn't exist God hates you and God you know is going to destroy you and God's going to this and this and this oh no no no nothing like that he oh God loves you and God this and God that but but you know God loves you God don't mind you he understands where you are he understands your sins he he he man now they you know some of them are even saying he Jesus Christ was a homosexual you know and and and they're saying it this and they're saying it this and they're saying it that and and see they're they're sugarcoating the gospel and that's exactly what Satan done is they he sugarcoated the gospel can you say amen and Eve should have walked away from them amen because she already knew what the word was she knew what the word of God clearly was before Satan even came to her now you and I we didn't even know what the word was before Satan got to us but she did and yet she stopped to listen to him and by the time he got done listen or talking she was confused right she didn't know what to believe right to where she thought she was doing right that's right that's right by listening to the devil she actually thought she was obeying God can you imagine deceive yeah but in this day Satan was able to to do whatever get us all caught up in things and then God would send a voice afterward see God got to e first and told him don't you do this and she had the word but she allowed Satan to penetrate and talk but in this age God allows Satan to give it everything he's got all right then he comes to us with his word all right can you say Amen yes sir now look she believed every bit of the word of God but the prophet said she was confused on one promise and that is the same yesterday today and forever and under the temptation of the enemy she failed on one promise yeah can you say Amen but if you look in this evil age this now Satan was able to do that to even God's eeden yeah that was God's eeden right he's the one that created it yeah right Satan had no power Satan cannot create he just perverts this is Satan's Eden amen uh of perversion he's been able to do his Eden by perverting amen ain't that right right so so in this evil age of Satan's Eden God has got a bride all right God calling her out of Babylon notice brother briam said who is coming in contact Again by the same thing same word hello pure word pure word straight from the voice of God that's right right not not filtered not not not not uh a third person third party no no straight from the mouth of God God has now given his people his word to where they ain't going to be confused about nothing that's right God can you say amen amen you don't have to be in the message of this age and stand confused ain't got no reason for it just simply take God at his word just simply believe what a prophet said whether you understand it or not the world is going to change their convictions are changing and it's getting worse that's right and then it makes us look like we're nuts it looks makes us look like we're just we just don't understand about life and we just don't understand and we're just hateful we're racist we're this we're that we ain't none of that we're just standing upon the word of God that came from a mouth of a prophet on yeah that's exactly right so you can see why it was important for the seventh angel to sound why because the word is to be restored by his message ain't that right this bride is not believing a denominational truth it's not believing a truth that the world is clinging to remember they're accepting it as truth but God himself says it's a lie but the spirit of Truth has come and sounded through a voice of a prophet thus sayth the Lord can you say amen that's good yes sir so she is believing something that's been supernaturally Vindicated I know there's all kinds of prophets in the age today always been of all kinds of things yeah but God always vindicates his Prophet supernaturally can you say amen and notice and God is proving in this age in the most evil age the most deceptive age far more deceptive than one it was in Eve's age that Spirit of deception was in its infant stage that now it's come to its maturity amen so much confusion so much people don't know what to do and yet in this age God is proving that this little bride is is is not like Eve and that she is not that type of woman notice brother BR said she will be Tried by his word the bride listen we don't need another Messenger to come we've already got it God Is So Vindicated it to be the truth now you're going to be tried you're going to be tested you're going to be proven right why why the tests why the trials why all these things the challenges because God is proven to Satan that you're not like Eve you will never be like Eve that's true you will stand you will not fail you've come out of confusion you were in confusion but now you've come out of confusion can you say amen amen and now you're standing upon thus say the Lord the prophet said she will stand the test that's right and I say to you there is no confusion about predestination not to this bride there is no confusion about communion or water baptism there is no confusion about adoption there is no confusion as as to whether uh you know about tongues and interpretation of tongues and how they are to be operated in the church there is no confusion not to those who have listened to the voice and come out of Babylon yes sir amen there's no confusion about God having a five-fold Ministry operating today there's no confusion about who to worship that's right and you say Amen there's no confusion as to who is our God Jesus Christ is our God that's right can you say Amen there's no confusion on how to be saved there's no confusion as to what the Holy Ghost is and what it does there's no confusion about the Rapture amen we've come out of Babylon amen oh do you love him good this coming out is just like it was in the first Exodus when you come out of confusion your home comes out of confusion when you come out of confusion your family comes out of confusion when the pastors preachers come out of confusion their Church comes out of confusion hello yes sir why because every question that comes your way you got an answer for it thus sayi the Lord amen thus sayith the Lord you may not see it all clearly but you know what a prophet said thus sayith the Lord it becomes our absolute yes amen that's right it's true amen and what's happening we're coming out coming out brother Braham said into the kingdom of God Amen coming out Babylon into the manifestation of sons of God into our inheritance back to where we came from all right do you love him amen if the musicians Will Come Bless the Lord Jesus brother brandham in his prayer he said oh to know that in this dark hour where there's so much confusion like the prophet said in the last days there would be a famine something of this order not for bread or for water but for hearing the word hearing of the true word of God and men would travel from east to west north and south seeking to find the true word of God word what is the word Jesus is the word see the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us ain't that right see so what are they looking for he says see to see the manifestation of the real word of God made manifest according to the scriptures and brought to pass how people would travel and seek and would fail to find that they're finding religious people they're finding people saying oh we believe God we believe God and they're going out in The Honky Tonks they're going out in the sports they're going out in the Hollywood they're going out in all kinds of Direction living any kind of a life and all of that and the churches have no power it's got a lot of psychology it's got a lot of theology it's got a lot of perfect things perfect choirs Perfect music perfect this perfect that it's all professionalism and yet not finding the real word of God which is the manifestation of the promised word for this age can you say amen and they will fail to find it but oh God we are so glad he says so glad that we have found him years ago precious to our heart and to see that we're not one bit confused amen we know where we stand we know what's going on can you say amen amen for we have seen him in his word made manifest what he promised it's coming to pass amen amen it's happening in you and I it's happening aren't you glad for that it's happening hallelujah it's happening come out of her that's what we're doing that's why we make a stand upon this message we're coming out of the confusion coming out of Babylon coming out everybody got their own ideas but we're coming out God gave us one leader that leader was Vindicated of God just like Moses was that one leader that he was Vindicated of God God stood with him and God stands with us amen for the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always amen can you say Amen you love the Lord amen amen what song m oh if anybody ask [Music] you oh tell them Hallelujah bless the name of the Lord oh yes I am redeemed I I've been bought with a price Jesus has save changed my whole life oh you anybody ask you just who I am tell them I I am redeemed oh let's stand to our feet and
