another's prayers amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Romans the 12th chapter a man Romans thee the 12th chapter and before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and just talk to our lord for we certainly need him don't we precious Lord we come humbly before you as your children father we realize more and more without you we can do nothing we need you to hold our hand as we walk through this Dark World we need you to use our lips Lord to speak Lord to others father we need you to take our eyes that you can see through and our ears Lord you need to take our whole being father and have complete control and father we're just asking now Lord that you would come Among Us and meet every need Lord that is present father whether there be discouragement whether there be sickness or whatever it would be father you alone know how to meet them and I pray that you had helped us just to yield ourselves to you father and may you have the preeminence Lord we give this part of the service to you in Jesus Christ's name amen the uh Romans the 12th chapter and we're going to read one and two verses here but it says I beseech you Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed everybody say be not conformed to this world to be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen you can have your seats this evening and again I want to just speak on the subject of choosing the the perfect will of God and we have I guess talked on this subject for a couple Wednesdays or so and um but this opening scripture here Paul tells us not to be conformed to the world but be transformed and um this this word conformed uh it means to be similar or exactly alike um to give the shape same shape outline Contour to bring in to Harmony or Accord so basically Paul is saying that we are not to be like the world act like the world live like the world think like the world talk like the world and we are not to be in agreement or in harmony with the world so in a nutshell we are to be different and there's a reason that we should be different not and not try to be different it's not trying because uh there's a lot of people that are trying to be different in so many ways um but uh so so naturally we were in agreement uh with the world the things of the world and that because of our human nature but we we are learning that the world is not in accordance with the word of God it's not in accordance with the perfect will of God the things of the world is not is not in accordance with the perfect will of God and I'm going to take my time and just talk to you for a few moments but I pray that the Lord will help us but we we talked about it you you know the message brother Branham tells us that God has a permissive will and a perfect will and and uh his his permissive will is what he permits to happen uh and and so the world the things of the world is what God permitted to be permitted to happen but but we find that the scriptures tells us that the world and the things of the world are going to pass away uh there and um but because it's something that God would permit to be but then his perfect will is what remains and his perfect will uh is what his thoughts are that's that's that because his thoughts are Eternal thoughts and and so it it comes from that which is eternal and and before sin came into the world we can we can get an idea of what the perfect will of God uh uh is uh just in the creation uh of God making man he made Man In His Image which made him a Son of God God gave this man dominion and making him a god of the Earth uh man also walked in harmony with God and he fellowshipped with God he walked in agreement with God he lived by the word of God which we would call revelation and so he he he didn't walk ignorantly in ignorance according to what God had in store for him but that's that's how he would exercise his domain and Authority is because he knew what God had given him to be and so he had an understanding as to what the will of God was for him uh and and and so uh this of course I believe uh was a picture of God's perfect will for for man and at that point in time man did not know what it was to be tempted he didn't know what it meant to be sick or to be discouraged or uh he didn't know what it was like to to Bear scars from uh of the past failures and mistakes and he didn't know what it was like to have the Mind battles and and go through the the things that you and I go through uh but but he lived in a a a a a a a place of perfection and he never knew the conditions as we know it today because he hadn't yet fallen from his position he ain't that right so God permitted uh permitted men to fall and to become a sinner and the prophet said when he failed uh he felt that that Holy image of God left him and his channels got clogged and he took on a sinful nature and and and man was made head to be the head over all creation and but his Fallen Nature has actually caused him to become lower than an animal uh in his his morals and brother Branham said you take the Holy Spirit off of The Man He's lower than the animal he's worse than the animal he said that's a hard thing to say but you take a man that's unregenerated in his mind without the Holy Spirit to direct his thoughts and things like that he would throw a baby out of a mother's arm arms and ravisher for beastly lust and so that's and and we're understanding today through through men's actions and just how low man can go uh in his Fallen nature and yet it was something that God would permit it had to happen as we know so that God could express who he himself truly is a man God Is A Healer God is a savior God is a redeemer deliverer a restorer but we wouldn't know these things had not God permitted man to fall and and allow such a thing but it also shows that he is a faithful God how many knows God to be faithful a man he's a faithful God and he is a faithful high priest amen but yet he couldn't Express what he is if he didn't permit man to fall now we talked about the names that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life they are God's Eternal thoughts from the foundation of the world and what God has predestinated them to be and what he has predestinated them for is the perfect will of God ain't that right a man and and so we didn't of course as we said many times we didn't come into this world uh uh according to God's perfect will we didn't come reflecting uh the perfect will of God uh we we came by God's permissive will amen what God had permitted uh therefore we were born as sons of Adam and not sons of God and and we come reflecting the adamic nature and not the nature of God and and so our natural birth makes us part of the the Fallen race and again God permitted it to happen that way but but again what God has permitted uh uh has to give way to that which is perfect amen what God uh uh uh God's permissive will gives way to his perfect will and and this is where uh we stand in in uh the age that we're in now Hebrews 12 26 now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven and this word yet once more signifies the remove moving of those things that are not or that are shaken as the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain ain't that right wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear ain't that right so we're we're living in an age where where things that uh there's things that just can't keep going on Amen the the we're we're we're at what the Bible calls were at the ends of the Earth amen politics can't keep going on the nations of this world can't keep going on uh denominations can't keep going on and and and what I and and that's fine with me because as long as they're continuing God's perfect will can't be accomplished ain't that right amen but but they give way to God's perfect will but this is is wonderful to me because that which is God permitted in your life is only temporary and it has to give way to God's perfect will a man see so uh God will never allow what he has permitted to affect or disenol uh his perfect will do you believe that amen now Romans 8 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US ain't that right A man sufferings is something that God permitted but it's temporary but it has something it's working something within us for the earnest expectation of the creature waders everybody say wait is for the manifestation of the sons of God ain't that right living in a world of corruption living in the world of Fallen nature living in a world of evil but yet we know that there is a perfect wheel that will prevail and and we see what that is it's the manifestation of the sons of God do you believe that amen and for the creature was made subject now notice that the creature you and I a man was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected you and I the see the same in hope so he had a reason for subjecting us to vanity but he didn't just stop there he subjected Us in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into what the Glorious Liberty of the children of God change has got to take place change everything about you a man concerning your natural birth has got to change it's it's got to take place in order that the perfect will may be accomplished a man from The Bondage of corruption the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation growneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves something within us is groaning it's been that way before well I guess since the fall groaning to get back into the place where man fell from ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body God may have saved us but you're still groaning amen God may have filled you with the Holy Ghost but you're still groaning amen there's something that just won't let you brother Bob I see you now good to have you back amen but there's something that is that that just won't let you be satisfied with just coming to church amen what God did for us yesterday is fine but that doesn't stop the groaning that is within us you see every individual who has had their name in the Lamb's Book of Life was not only subject to vanity but also subject to whole hope and so all those individuals are groaning amen within to be restored to the perfect will of God can you say man I'm so glad that God it wasn't just in God for me to be a sinner but it was more in God for me to be a saint can you say amen amen to be a saint it means more than being an American it means more than just uh whatever it's it's we're children of God and so there's something that is causing us to groan grown we're groaning a man to be back in the perfect will of God brother Graham said our Spirits grown for that Deliverance another place said it doesn't yet appear what we shall be like but we know everybody say we know we will have a body like he is for we shall seek him as he is and now in our body now we groan for that day how many's groaning amen we groaning see that we didn't understand why we're groaning but now the word is being opened up and the promises have been made clear and we understand why we're groaning can be perfect in this world or can't be satisfied we can't be no matter what it is if if a man can just be satisfied with money he needs something within him to groan beyond that a man pushing beyond that can you say Amen some people just live for retirement but we're groaning for something greater than retirement ain't that right some people just look for for positions and and their name in The Highlight by the Believers groaning for something greater than that all in this world is going to vanish it's going to fade away a man but there's something within that believer that is groaning because he was there in the perfect thoughts of God can you say man and them thoughts have not been manifested you say well I was born on a certain day in a certain year but that wasn't the thought of God or why would you need to be born again why would you need to come into maturity can you say man them thoughts of God are now becoming a manifestation it's been a process and Dad couldn't do it mom couldn't do it the preacher couldn't do it it had to take God and it had to take that new birth can you say man and then bring you on up into maturity growth into an adoption now see so now uh uh he says that our bodies now we've grown for that day all Earth is groaning for that day another place what a beautiful Fellowship it must have been when God called his children in the cool of the evening and communed with him then kissing them as it were on the cheeks and laying them down to sleep for a night's rest and the wild beast of the field he bent it down without any disturbance any harm no harm was there no death no sickness no trouble and to awake on a new day to walk in the presence of their creator without fear without sickness and then what he says notice what he says oh God our Spirits grown for that time again for that's what we were made for I hate that rap I'm still in my daughter today you know the tears that we may shed amen there we we got keep looking ahead because there's going to come a time amen that that that our King will come and he will wipe all tears from our eyes amen and everything here will be just gone it'll be and and and we don't know nothing a man of all of this world and all of this filth and all of this the things that we go through a man will never be will never shed tear again why we're coming to God's perfect will nature is groaning we're groaning brother Brown said everything is groaning because we realize something's not right something's not right you believe that something's not right we we thought it would you know people think well something not right so they go change one woman to the next find out still not right it'll go change from one Church to another church and find out it's something not right see they they they they they're missing something and they don't know what they're missing they keep searching they keep looking they keep finding well the Bible says they'll be ever learning never coming to the knowledge of Truth ain't that right there'll be Roman to and fro trying to find something find the answer but they'll never find it but you and I now we're finding what we're groaning about that's why we can stay firm in the trials that's why we can stay firm amen where we're at and unmovable unshaken because we there is nothing in this world that can satisfy the groaning we just endure we just keep pressing we keep pushing Amen to the goal amen because it's only he that can satisfy the groaning and the groaning ain't gonna stop until this Mortal body takes on incorruption and we're changed and this world is Chained amen democracy has changed politics has changed the civilization has changed everything the kingdoms of this world is gone amen and we enter into a place of no more trial no more suffering no more sorrow and no more loneliness No More Tears can you say Amen and we're groaning might have a good meeting but we're still groaning might have great experiences but we're still groaning can you say man now he says notice we realize there's something not right and the only way you can groan now notice that the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been New Life in here that has come that speaks of a new world can you say man amen there's something that keeps speaking of these promises speaking of a Rapture speaking of a body change I don't know how you know I mean you you can talk to a lot of people about those things and it doesn't do nothing but you take a believer that hears them things and he got something within them that just pushes them that won't let them be settled with just Christianity or religion groaning so this is not us resisting and God making us do his will for we are groaning aren't you glad you're groaning yeah and the groaning comes from the predestinated seed uh that is within us we groan for it because we're predestinated to it you're not predestinated you won't grow the money will be more lucrative than than the groaning then what the believer's really groaning for amen uh the things of this world will be more satisfactory the world don't understand why we go through our trials the world don't even understand why we deny the things of this world they they don't understand why we ain't got an appetite for it there's something in us that is causing us to grow grow we're predestinated for it and so something in US is calling for the perfect will of God to be done now there are only two bodies the prophet said two groups in this world one body is intellectual and is made up of Science and education and we would call that body denomination it's wrapping up into the World Council of churches and and actually all denominations will make is making up the World Council of churches and and and people are entering into that more rapidly by the moment and and it's it's it's it's like a the dam that has been opened and the water's rushing amen well that's that's where it's coming to we're living in that age and and so uh uh and but a man belongs to this body by joining it and and and and and yet it's this body will be utterly destroyed and that we already know the end and and it'll be destroyed but the other body is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and you you belong to this body not by joining but by being born into it which makes you a a greater part than to join it you are more real of in this body than they are in their that body because they've joined this in in that one you're born into this ain't that right and this body is a Spirit-filled word body it's a word body a body made up by the perfect will of God do you believe that the perfect will of God it is spotless without a blemish nor a wrinkle a man see and so by again by the new birth you're part of this body and and the prophet would say you have to be part of it you you you can't be burned born into the body and then say well I ain't got no part to do with that nothing nah and then you sit on the sidelines and and you're living it easy and you know kind of like in the Bahamas you know under the the shade tree sipping lemonade and and whatever you know and and while your comrades supposably are fighting the battle and they're they're they're just into it and and they're they're weary but yet they keep pressing and you're over there ah I'm part of you guys you know no no you that's not being part of anything ain't that right so you you got to be part of it now notice what brother Brown said could I deny I got an arm Ryan see no more than I could deny any of God's word see if I'm part of God I'm part of William Branham see I'm in parts so you're in parts right see every part is a part of me and every word of God has to fit my spirit fit my soul fit my living it has to fit my ideas if my ideas is contrary to that then God's spirit don't dwell in me it cannot deny one word of it if if if you're saying this is my body if I'm saying this of my body but this ain't my arm well how can that be it's it's part of my body it's attached to my body it came with me when I was born can you say man well if you were birthed into this body you cannot deny this because this body is a word body ain't that right and God's perfect will will be done in his body in his body the whole body is groaning the whole body is yearning Paul was groaning Isaiah was groaning all of them was groaning amen Peter groaning all all the Old Testament New Testament saints were groaning and then we stopped in this day and don't groan in the finale of this thing I don't think so we're part of the body that they're part of [Applause] again Jesus tells us that we are to pray give us this day our daily bread the word of God for this age give it to us thy kingdom come thy will be done but notice thy perfect will thy perfect will be done in earth not just throughout the Earth but there's vessels there's Earthen vessels ain't that right that's a will of God will be completed in I believe I'm speaking to Earth and vessels tonight thy perfect will be done in earth as it is in heaven in other words what you're saying is is God thy perfect will be done in me bring it to personal let it be done in me and we've been told don't don't pray for government don't pray for America don't don't pray for it it that's going it's a it's a ship that's about sunk I mean it probably is sunken you've just seen little bubbles but it's it's gone it's over there there's no hope but the perfect will of God is going to be done in not in government but it's going to be done in a group of people can you say man those that are praying for this to be done ain't that right remember we're not just praying for the will of God to be done but we're asking him give us this day our daily bread I hope it makes sense to you that Daily Bread is his perfect will made known to you and I for this age God's allotted his word to every age but there is a people in that age that is predestinated to know that word and to make that word live God's perfect will now the prophet said now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in US say that again we have been saved as we are and we've been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now everybody say now now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of Life get your mind off the natural things get your head out of all of that be transformed can you say amen and brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word people don't I I'll say it right fast but people just do not regard God's word anymore they put their jobs over work over the word sleep over the word they don't even give time anymore for God to move after Services you gotta go they got to go to work they got to get some sleep you know what I'm saying if everybody was like them where how would God move come on now amen give the word preeminence give the word preemness the god that gave you that job surely can keep you the god that blessed you with the material things surely we can give him a little honor and let him move what good is your ministry without him what good is our life without him what good is this service without him ain't that right see you've got to be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word now notice Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep now notice brother Branham described the condition as being a darkness of Chaos is just chaotic and the word chaos is a state of utter confusion it's just it was just so much confusion there was no organization it was just darkness it was it was it was a mess brother Branham said it this way the churning of the water and that wandering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere it must have been a terrific mass of something lost like it was and couldn't find its way back ain't that right so see it was just a massive confusion and and and everything was in disarray or the Earth was in disarray and and all of these things uh uh uh as as the Bible says so and then notice what he says this is what we become when we become wondering Stars just without hope without God just turning around out in darkness not knowing where we're going that's that's the majority of people today not not just in the in the bars and The Honky Tonks and the prostitutions and all of that in the church in religion just wandering Stars not knowing where they're going it's a massive confusion ain't that right but then we read that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the deep the face of the waters and God took that great chaos of darkness and transformed it into a Garden of Eden by his word ain't that right and I say to you God's word is how we are transformed amen but notice it took not just the word it took the spirit of God to move amen and to make that word live ain't that right God said let there be life see let there be light the prophet said and that mass of creation out there come over in around the Sun and begin to revolve around the Sun and became a Garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God it dumbed the perfect will of God for it was transformed from chaos into a Garden of Eden by the word of God can you say Amen so what we are doing is being transformed from a chaotic life Faith to the perfect will of God the perfect so as sons of daughters of God were groaning for the perfect will of God to be done but as I have said for a few Services now that we are free moral agents and um so what that means is we're not like the son that God says let there be light stay in your position and the light appears and it comes to its position Graham talks about that star it would fall and fall and fall and then it would hang there because God stopped it right there and he stopped it right there and he stopped it right there and if one of those Stars would get out of the position it would create utter chaos to this earth ain't that right but then we find that man got out of his position and look what it's called ain't that right see so we're we're not as one that God commands and then we just automatically do it kind of be nice but that's not the way it happens we are free moral agents to where we have to choose everybody say I've got to choose I got to choose the perfect will of God you've got to choose now God knew beforehand what choices we would make and he alone knows he is the only one that has the infinite in mind and knowledge but we we have to wrestle things out we have to wrestle things out we have to make our calling and election sure ain't that right we're not one that says well I got saved blessed God 19 years ago and then just go I don't have to worry about it no more no you got to make choices you got to make choices you you you've got to advance into the more perfect will of God ain't that right whatever you want to call it maturity growth building up the whatever it is you've got to rest you you you got to wrestle it out yes we enter into rest when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost knowing knowing that we are a child of God and there's nothing everybody say there's nothing that Satan can do to us he he can't make us any different why we're sealed in sealed in Christ and Satan's sealed out ain't that right the Holy Ghost comes inside of us and God sets up his throne in our heart ain't that right and I'm so glad for that aren't you glad God set up his throne in your heart amen that's right he didn't just fall upon you he come to live in you but that doesn't mean that we it takes away our choices we have to make choices every day Satan can still tempt us he can entice us he is able to speak to us he's able to put thoughts in her mind can you say man we're made of three trifle being Body Spirit and soul he's able to affect our body by the five senses right he's able to affect our spirit by the five senses Holy Ghost filled people don't always get on the right side of get wake up on the right side of the bed I don't know go ahead Holy Ghost filled people don't always feel like uh uh having a good time and going to church and jumping for joy and you say man see he works he works on our outside man he works on the inside man but on the inside of that inside that's where God came to live is that right now notice the spirit of God in you manifests the life of Jesus just like the mainspring in in a watch that ticks and every part of it moves just exactly the right see it controls your emotions it controls your habits it controls your senses it controls your faith it's just the mainspring the the holy spirit in the middle of your heart controlling you and you say man see so it's a we now we we believe with a different kind of faith we love with a different kind of love we we have joy but it's a different type of joy we have peace but it's a different type of Peace it's because he set in our heart our soul ain't that right and his attributes now are flowing flowing through us ain't that right yes sir see so so it's not all human we're not just all human now Jesus was God and he was human human God ain't that right amen and what are you then if you're filled with truly filled and with the baptism of Holy Ghost you are human and you are God I know people don't like to hear that but that's true that's true how else are you going to overcome how else as a human being how else are you going to overcome as a human being how are you going to groan for the perfect will of God when it's not even in you to grow how are you going to groan for something that you never heard of this Earth is more real to the human being than in heaven is we see this all the time that's why the doctor's words can affect uh uh people more than the word of God can but the way we believe the what is in us there's something in us that is Supernatural it's another life and it's causing us to groan is causing us to yearn now we have to come to our Crossroads in life and young people bless your hearts that's where you're at we all go through them and I'm I'm 49 and we still go through Crossroads and you know sometimes I don't know I mean I I think as we mature we should be able better to handle it but in in these times but still in these times is really when Satan really works on us and and so you young people maybe you don't know about them struggles you don't understand why you're going through these struggles but I want to say this to you it's Crossroads it's Crossroads in your life and Crossroad is is well you could either call it a y or a split in the road or where you can either go straight turn left turn right it's Crossroads this nation came to Crossroads and and and they didn't stay on track and and and so but this is where the the the the the struggle happens now I I will tell you most people most of your friends most the people you work with uh go to school with whatever they don't care about the will of God they're they're they're satisfied with church they're satisfied with the easy path they they go to church but they got more more of this world on their minds and they don't understand about decisions and why you're so uh uh why it's an necessary to you to make right choices can you say man so see so they don't care about God's will they have this idea that God is going to have to accept them the way that they are after all he made me the way I am so therefore he's got to accept it that's a lie for there is a power of transformation [Music] if you're just a Baptist or a Pentecostal or just some nominal church member I can understand why you don't want to go there why you don't want the perfect will of God to be done because there's nothing there to help you but we all come out of something and we come out of it because something led us here not for us to just stop believing and not just for us to stop groaning but to keep groaning because we understand there's a power transformation to changes from one thing to another the people don't want to wrestle it out and and I'll be honest we don't like trials but God brings them to you now if we all think if we all had a choice in that matter if we all had a choice we'd say Lord easy please easy but God in his wisdom says no that's not that's not the way it's going to go because God looks for character and we're going to get into it later but God looks for character and that's the only thing that you're going to take with you is your character and characters not a a gift to you as as it is to be a musician that's a gift that come with you as it is to be a an electrician or whatever you've got abilities that you were born with them are gifts them are talent but character is not a gift it's a victory one amen now I want to say this you will not find the perfect will of God outside the word of God amen the perfect will of God is what God has revealed in his word so this brings it to a nutshell the message is the revealed word of God the message is the perfect will of God now if you're groaning if you're groaning for the will of God then that groaning brings you to the message and it doesn't matter who walks away so be it it led me here my groaning led me to the revealed word of God that tells me my future that helps me identify what this groaning is there is a new Heaven that's the new Earth it's a city siroucher can you say Amen and and this groaning did not lead me to some imagination that man has of a Rapture it led me to the revealed word it led me thus it is the perfect will of God to those I say it again the message of the hour is the perfect will of God to those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life everybody else don't believe it everybody else will water it down everybody else wants to add something to it everybody else is not satisfied with it they got to mix their own ideas and this and that and this and try to prove what brother Brandon was wrong in this and brother wrong and it's just opinions and it's just this but to those who has their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and are groaning from within that Soul amen this message is the answer they're satisfied because it is the perfect will of God to them that's why we as ministers cannot make the message anything than what it is brother Brandon said my message has been all along the word of God so as a message believer how else can we preach the word of God without the message the message is the word of God all along see in another place he says the only way that I can help you now notice he's he's a preacher and and I say to all of his preachers a man that the only way he says that I can help you is getting is by getting your faith centered on the will of God for you by the word of God can you say amen amen say that again the only way that that I as your pastor can help you in in this assembly amen the only way that I can help you is get your faith centered on the will of God for you by the word of God by the word of God can you say Amen what is it preach the message your parents how are you going to get your child focused on the word of God centered on the will of God preach the message teach the message get him in the message play the tapes we're talking about the pastor and just just just preach the message quit complaining about the church you go to and just preached a message can you say man well that knocks a lot out huh he brought us now notice by the message of the hour he brought us to the perfect word you believe it therefore brother Brown said we do have by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication with Divine Vindication amen I tell my children I tell you I tell myself I tell anybody we don't just believe this message because we say it's right we believe it because God said it's right and it's the perfect interpretation by Divine vindication it's the perfect will of God made known to you and I do you believe it so preach the perfect word and it will get the face of God select centered on the perfect will of God for them man thank you Lord Abraham said we must hold to that regardless talking about the word we must hold to that regardless and now we know what the word is it's the message of the hour can y'all say Amen to that one y'all believe that the word for this age is the message of the hour so we must hold to that brim didn't preach nothing outside this Bible it's people got it all messed up they bring it all back into chaos but according to God's word it will never be chaotic to a believer because a Believer stays right with the message so always he says see we must hold to that regardless of what other things take place always stay with that word always check out your motives and objectives see if it is according to the word of God if it isn't leave it alone that's a perfect will of God right see but if it's with the word of God and lines up with the word of God then you hold to that ain't that right now Abraham focused his mind to the will of God by the word of God that's why the prophet said Abraham 25 years he he waited but he was faithful he stayed true to that word he professed that word he confessed that word and his faith grew stronger and stronger why he centered his mind focused his mind on the will of God by the word of God can't focus on the perfect will of God without the word now we want the will of God be done how many believes that how many wants the will of God to be done so again we believe that the the word of God revealed word of God is the perfect will of God but then but then our faith has to be tried to see if it will hold out the Bible says every Son of God must be tested and tried so this proves whether or not you're going by what somebody else has said or if you're going by a true revelation of God's word man the testings come The Trials come I think you could ask any Elder in this in this building tonight how many Elders have had trials raise your hand really high okay some Elders have but most Elders are yeah most most Elders have and some haven't but but but most Elders have had trials if you're a Christian if you're a Believer you have trials and we go through them now you young people you go through trials too you're not alone in them Elders can you say Amen to that you're not alone now these trials reveals you know brother Branham talks about how that when he talked about the pillar of Fire he he told people about the pillar fire they told him it was of the devil they told him to stay away from it they told him it was just nonsense and da da well he says he says they had me scared to where I wouldn't even preach it I wouldn't preach it he said but then God came and revealed it that it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same one that the Apostle Paul met on the road to Damascus then notice what he says oh then try to shake it out of me can't be done for it's the scripture see he was going by what man said what man said and so therefore if they put fear in him to where he'd just shut up he wouldn't talk about wouldn't preach about it but then when it become revealed he saw it in scripture as being the perfect will of God for this age and being of God it was God it wasn't an evil spirit it wasn't something a terrible he said see but when it came he said see it's scripture it's God's word it's not just an experience that's loose it's an experience that is backed up by God's word and God's Eternal Bliss promise see so you come down to it that what what you have experienced and most of you young people have been raised up in church all your life I guess raised in the message all your life and you've heard these things to be true but God God wants to bring it personally to you God wants it it's not that you didn't have the Holy Ghost it didn't mean that you're lost it doesn't mean nothing like that but God wants it down so down deep inside you that the world can't take it out of you and you say man this message has got to be a revelation to you to where no one can take it out no one can talk you out of it and when when Dad and Mom is long gone and if the Lord tarries and hell you're called to preach you ain't going to be like those preachers that that say well I believe the message and then the Trials come and you walk out you're going to be like those preachers that'll stand there come hell or high water and still Proclaim you'll be like these Elders that had gone through the fire and yet you'll see them just lifting their hands and worshiping the Lord and you and you're like how do they stand the same way God's going to make you stand through trials it's just true see your faith your faith has got to be tested and tried to see if it's real faith ain't that right listen there there's that that that group of the Hebrews the Israelites you know the Bible says there in Hebrews 15 through 16. it talks about that they heard the word of God they heard it they heard the message of the hour and and yet they provoke God now listen now you'll see we're choosing the will of God the perfect will of God God was trying to take him somewhere it wasn't his will a perfect will for them to be in Egypt he was trying to take him to a land amen that flow with milk and honey it was already given to them before they ever went into Egypt so they heard the word of God it was the Vindicated message of the hour but they provoked him why do they provoking griping complaining every time the trials cover I just thinking I don't know why I'm gonna be honest we pray probably all done at one time or another trials hurt testings ain't no fun I've caught myself even saying it why don't he know s and it's in them times we've got to Humble ourselves to where we say thy will be done but don't look for a bed of roses don't look for it easy is this all right they heard the will of God they rejoiced but when they came to trials and the testings they murmured and complained and notice what they've done instead of humbling themselves they hardened their hearts showing that they had unbelief they had an evil heart of unbelief for they hardened her hard against a trial instead of breaking them down and saying oh God forgive me oh God help me oh God just keep me in your grace I tell you what and the trials in their trials and their testings their heart got hardened because of an evil heart of unbelief ain't that right see so the trials that we go through will actually declare what is in US it'll it'll bring it out one way or another and because you cannot you you may be able to make belief in the bench in the pews while the song surface has gone on and the music is nice and even if you're in the preaching now some people get mad during the preaching they even get mad during the Psalms but you're really testing is going to be when you go through your trials you ain't gonna be able to make belief then because it's going to show what's really in you brother Brian I'm talking about it says they got weary every time they'd get to a place where a showdown come then what would they do they would fly loose and get weary and want to turn back and why did this happen to me strange this morning after preaching that just as hard as I could there was many come to the Altar and still question it why does this happen to me you see how it goes It goes over the top of the people's head it's just the same people see what Jesus said you have eyes but you can't see he said that to the disciples and they said oh now thou speak as plainly now we believe now no man has to tell you anything because God shows it to you and he said do you now believe see after all this time you must and everybody say I mustn't question God anything you mustn't question anything to God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord every trial is put upon you to prove you and the Bible said they're more precious to you than gold so if God let a few light afflictions and notice their light afflictions amen Paul called him light afflictions right amen it's true see so he puts a few light afflictions see let some happen to you remember it's for the correction of you every son that cometh to God must be first chastened of God and tried child trained there's no exceptions every son that cometh these afflictions are done or brought about to see what attitudes you'll take it's God on this Proving Ground that's all Earth is is The Proving Grounds and where he's trying to prove you isn't that good okay I'm going to try a hurry so another place said the Hebrew children them famous characters of the scripture that was standing on God's word to be true they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace nevertheless we won't bow to the image because it's against the word although if you slay us he'll raise us up again see he let them walk right up to the edge of this great furnace and drop into it before it seemed like he even paid any attention like he wasn't even watching them but he's always watching he's always watching for this can you say Amen so you stay with the revealed word by your faith in it by your faith and that faith is going to be tested and tried to the uttermost but here James 1 and 3 it says I'll break it in the trying of your faith work of patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect transformed transforming you right see that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing or lacking nothing why you're coming to the perfect will of God you love the Lord and if you notice it's what Paul called the faith of God's elect for the faith of God's elect are the only ones who will prove to have the faith ain't that right the revealed word is priest of them they believe it and after they've been tested and tried brother Brown said they're still believing it it's the faith it's the faith of God's elect ain't that right so for us to manifest the perfect will of God which proves that we are the elect of God we have to choose the perfect will of God before we come into the perfect will of God we have to choose that direction we have to choose the perfect will of God can you say Amen now I don't mean to be repeating myself but I wanted to make that clear to us choosing choosing the perfect will of God means you have yielded to it I'm going to close now but I'm going to I'm going to get to where I want to go choosing the will of God means you have yielded to it I choose the perfect will of God and then don't yield to it something's wrong you got to yield ain't that right and again this is where the struggle comes because our flesh it does not want to yields it wants to be its own man see the perfect will of God is a headship headship can you say Amen now notice again be not conformed to this world no notice what the world does Apostle Paul prophesied to this day in second Timothy 4 and 3. saying the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine that's the way of the world but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they shall turn away their ears from the truth the revealed word and shall be turned unto fables this is why Paul would tell us don't be conformed to the world don't can you say man amen no because this is where they're headed and it's what they're manifesting they're walking after their own lusts so when it comes to the choosing of the perfect will and they realize that they've got to yield themselves to it ain't gonna do that they want to make the message just something that you just joined just be a churchgoer just live away still be involved in the world still act like the world and all that and just come in here hey there's preachers in this message that smoke cigarettes because they refuse to come under the headship they'll preach polygamy under this message it's men that want to be coming to the message and make it religion that they don't want to come under the head ship can you say Amen so their own lusts overrides the perfect will of God Jude says they walk after their own lust so they're led by their own desires their own passions and this is where the battle comes because there's something within us that wants to rise up and say you're on your own man you don't have to do that just live any way you want to but then there's something that's growing for the perfect will of God and we know they're being led by their own desires and passions because the perfect will of God has been revealed and they choose to walk contrary to it but we as God's elect cry thy will be done thy will can you say man thy perfect will be done amen you young people must choose to walk the perfect will of God or after your own lust and I and I want to say for us all it's not that we don't know the perfect will of God we do we do but we got to wrestle it out I'm going to show you something just real quick before I go and I want to make something clear to you young people because I believe it's the perfect will of God you should not date anyone outside this message [Music] we've got a a story in the Bible of a man that did that he was the wisest man outside of Christ God blessed him but what did he do he intermarried he married a woman that was a heathen an idolater beautiful and brother Branham said he died he died a heathen idolater because of a bunch of pretty women he married outside of his faith and Jezebel pulled him away from God now I've quoted this scripture but I am going to read it this time second Corinthians just for confirmation for you young people second Corinthians 6 14 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth was an infidel what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them do you realize why you're different God chose you to come and dwell in you and walk in you and I will be their God and they will be my people can you say Amen now brother Brown would tell this young man getting married married some married some girl that don't believe or some uh some young girl marrying a boy that don't believe don't you do that I don't care how cute he is or how cute she is and what those big guys she's got they'll all fade out one of these days but brother your soul is going to live forever you be careful everybody say you be careful and I want to just encourage you young people you be careful what you're doing if she ain't a real believer or him a real believer don't you yoke yourself up with that stay away from such it will cause you trouble down the road [Music] now I want you as a church to know I believe that and my family believes that yeah you you you you you can't go the other direction I've dedicated my life to this message I've dedicated my children to this message my wife's dedicated herself to this message we dedicated this building for this message can you say Amen and we ain't gonna let the devil steal it we ain't gonna let the devil try to connive his way in it ain't happening all right you understand what I'm saying and I'm not saying my children hasn't been tempted I'm going to just sit this way and I hope I hope it's okay it's just us if you watch it on internet a few years ago a son was going to college school met a young pretty girl nice girl met her really nice talked about God talked about it all she had a brother that held Bible studies there at the college and they they were uh you know in what they believed they they done what they knew to do and uh I we went and met the family and things and they were just nice people and things like that but they were not in the message difference they weren't in the message so in my opinion that's out right so he and she got to talking and texting each other and they would see one another at the school he was attending and I'd done my best to discourage it that didn't seem to help he started attending the Bible studies there and got to end discussions about different things and of course they were night and day from what we believed and the father wanted to talk to him so they got to talking about predestination and he was trying to convince him one way and my son would come say Dad well what about it and I said well no what the prophet said and I told him I said you wouldn't even be an entertaining these thoughts if you wouldn't be messing with that girl you you wouldn't be asking questions if you hadn't been wrapped up in that girl you understand what I'm saying it leads to somewheres we we yeah we want to get so safe but not the cost of my my children and not the cost of your children hello we don't all of a sudden forget the message when someone wants to come and date our daughters or someone wants to come date our children hello you mean we stand on the message we raise them up with the message God sent a prophet stay with the message and all of a sudden we just dis and all everything that a prophet said don't think so finally I told him I said well if you're going to go this route fine I'll take you off that platform you will not be on that platform you will not sing you will not be on in the music you will not be in anything demand I say that to let you know how serious I am with this message and by God's grace he cut it off it was hard she cried and she boohooed and she bawled so some just think you're lucky girl crying over you God's blessed him with a wonderful wife and all these things that brother Bram said a a real True Believer is believes every word everybody say every word that God said is the truth and they take it the same way see the unbeliever denies the whole word of God to be true ain't that right so here we we find that that the believer is going to take the whole word of God D I don't care what trials they go through I don't care whatever I don't care the battles that they go through when it all settles down they're going to Humble themselves unto the might under the mighty hand of God to the word of the age can you say Amen if the musicians will come the marriage between a man and woman in symbolic of the Union between Christ and his bride and brother Branham said a woman marry a man and disagreeing with him there would be some kind of a fuss continually but when a man and his wife his girlfriend his espouse when they are in Perfect Harmony like one Soul one mind because they're going to be one flesh then when the church can get in such harmony with God until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride because they are going to be one can you say Amen you love him it's easy to to say well that that individual you ain't in the message so we know not to go that direction but then there's times that [Music] boys and girls in the message that ain't solid with the message [Music] some don't believe that you need to go to church period or that you just come on a Sunday some don't think you need to sit under a pastor some of these guys have weird ideas the problem is they want to come and attend our youth meetings and such to get them a girl brother Branham said this he said you young fellas you better pray a long time ask God to give you a companion you young women the same way because it is so uncertain we see it all the time boys get married oh well yeah yeah yeah yeah message message profit profit profit as soon as I get married to bring a TV in the home [Music] oddly movies I think they're Hypocrites that's what I think [Music] they got these you know this technology that's becoming apparently pretty popular I've heard about it throughout the years where you can watch a movie and it takes the cussing out so a lot of these message people feel like it's okay now we we can watch the movie now rated or whatever don't matter we can watch the movie and because it silences the cussing I don't know what it does now you don't hear the cussing so now it becomes okay [Music] you know I think that's a stun of the devil that anoints people to believe that in junk what about the motives of the movie what about the anointing on them stupid actors most of them are perverts they're coming out of the closet as homosexuals and that spirit is in the hole they're committing adultery don't tell them how many women they slept with [Music] and they're bringing it in the home [Music] Hollywood [Music] brother Braum told us about Hollywood it's the seed of Satan it's it's coming up with our Fashions it's kind of it's all of our young everything that goes on is coming out of Hollywood of what they're feeding into the minds of young people feeding through the minds and the hearts of the of the home our home life is destroyed because of Hollywood fathers are destroyed because of Hollywood mothers have left motherhood because of Hollywood now the churches want to be Hollywood when does it stop but what it is is because these young guys claim to be in the message they claim to be right and our poor girls they believe that they believe them and they ain't got fathers to stand up against it so they just don't want to marry the guys and then their marriages is is rotten because they ain't got the spirit of God in the home probably ought to be quiet but it's just true we want to pray thy will be done and if there's anyone here living like a hypocrite you better get them movies out you better get that television out On A Life That's worthy of the Gospel [Music] why we're going through the perfect will of God you got to choose the perfect will of God and you know what you're going to have to fight your way to get there it ain't going to be easy selling as we all who float down the river we all go up the river by car so we can float down the river in relaxation we don't swim up the river you understand what I'm saying well in this you're going to have to swim up the river you're going to have to battle your way through this thing but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved ain't that right you love the Lord isn't he wonderful going to be tempted gonna be tested going to be tried to the utmost but in the end there's going to be a people that yield to the perfect will of God [Music] God bless you is our prayer I hope it's helped you amen just a burden on my heart I understand there's a maturing things that we do did allow we don't allow no more it's a growth but when you're 10 years down the road in this message and there ain't and you're still doing things of what we used to do and allow and it's you know we're coming God is bringing us to a maturity can you say man Hallelujah I'll follow [Music] [Music] I'll go with him with him all where he leads me I I will follow [Music] where he leaves [Music] I will fall [Music] where he leads me I will follow I'll go with him with him all I'll go with him through heart trials how go away with him through heart trials I'll go with him through our trial I'll go with helped him through hard trial s I'll go with him with all can we sing that as a prayer where you leave me where you live be I will follow oh where you live foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] as they play softly could we just bow our heads in a word of Prayer before we leave maybe you'd like to slip your hand up and say brother Sean I I want to go higher in the Lord I want his perfect will to be done in my life [Music] it's about all of us here God sees your hand God sees your heart church I wished I could say it be easy for you but it's not wished I could say that God makes all your decisions for you but there comes a time that you got to go to your Crossroads [Music] and you got to say in Your Heart Lord I submit myself to you I wonder if we could just pray unto the Lord and pray in your own way father you see every hand that was lifted father as the prophet said it would take you to lift the hand [Music] goes by law of gravitation they couldn't do it there's something in them [Music] I know they're pulled in all kinds of ways Satan enticing tizing our young people [Music] putting questions in their mind trying to confuse them trying to tell them there's no use but oh God I see pray that you see their heart Lord and give them strength give them Grace to endure father there are a group of people that love you Lord they they wouldn't have been here tonight if they didn't love you that oh Lord I know the battle gets hot I know the trials get get weary he causes this Lord to almost faint but Lord you promised that would reap if we'd faint not and I know your grace is with us oh Father I pray Lord that you'd strengthen our hands strengthen our hearts strengthen us oh God for the battle [Music] help us Lord to keep pressing on may we endure into the end father may we keep our eyes on the gold do we choose thy perfect will [Music] in Jesus Christ Mary leads me I will follow can we
