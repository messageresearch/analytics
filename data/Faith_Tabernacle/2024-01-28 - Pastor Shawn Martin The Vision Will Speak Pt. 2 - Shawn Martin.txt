there's many people living today that seen the vision seen it happen and know about it and uh I went out and stood on the steps and said to brother George now you watch he's going to be wearing a brown coat and a plug hat he'll walk right down these steps in a few minutes and he actually did he' come right out and walk down and about uh uh a night after that the Lord appeared to me again one morning just about to break a day and showed me a woman hideously crippled that was going to be made well so I said well I'll um I'll probably find out where she's at and uh so um uh I went down and was turning off some water up on I believe around 8th Street in New albony and uh I had to there was a double tenament and I was afraid I turned off both sides one side the people moved out and the other side the people were there so I went over to the side that had the the people is occupied and a knocked at the door and there was a a real poor people and a very attractive young girl come to the door rather poorly dressed and um she uh she said um uh what did you want and I said would you try the water to see if it's off and she said yes sir and she went she said no the water's still on I said Thank you and her mother laying on bed her name was Mrs Mary darl Ohanian and she was Armenian her boy played fullback I believe it was on the uh new Al base uh football team and she had her daughter was in high school her name is darthy and she said um darthy say to me aren aren't you that man of God that have that healing here in the hospital other day my mother wish to speak to you and I went in and she told me that um she was laying crippled and she hadd been crippled in the bed 17 years since this girl was born and uh so the girl was 17 years old and so I told her that she said are you that man of God that healed that man I said no ma'am I'm not a Healer I just um just merely um um uh pray for the this sick man was showed by something it told me I didn't know what to call it a vision or what I didn't know what it was yet I was just a boy and single and everything and so there was um this um this lady asked me for prayer for her and I told her let me pray first and then if the Lord showed me to come back and then when I went out to pray I got brother George and I said that's that woman woman that I I was telling you that I prayed about I know it's the same woman go with me and we went up there to to offer prayer and so this little 17year old girl of course me just a young boy and she had a brother about six eight years old something like that and there's a Christmas tree is right after Christmas standing in the house and they got behind this Christmas tree to laugh at me to make their mother well I told her that the Lord was going to heal her and I brother George and I got out to pray and when I started to pray well that angel that I see that that you see in the picture I seen it hanging over the bed well I reached over and Tuck a hold of her hand and I said Mrs OHA now she lives in New Aly right now and her husband and family and I said Mrs ohanna the Lord Jesus has sent me and told me before coming that to pray for you and you just go be made well rise up on your feet and be made well in the name of Jesus her legs was draw up under she with her Armenian Bible over her heart started moving towards the side of the bed and as she did she uh then Satan spoke to me said you let her hit that floor she'll break her neck off that High bed I was scared for a moment and I'd always know that what them Visions I didn't know what it was then had told me was always right so I went ahead anyhow let her come off the bed and God being my witness as soon as she started jump from that bed both legs come straight her daughter screamed pulling her hair and running out into the street screaming as loud as she could Neighbors come from everywhere and there she was for the first time for 17 years walking around in that room praising God I left immediately to get away from it later I got acquainted with this young girl and went with her of course this don't have to be on record but I went with the young girl uh not long after that uh few weeks I was in my mother's house one evening and um I've been praying that day and I I just simply couldn't seem to break through to uh to uh uh victory in my prayer and uh I thought I just stay all you know go ahead to bed I staying at home at that time and so I went into the the room to to pray and I was about 1:00 in the morning I guess and I uh prayed and all at once the I looked and mama she used to take her clothes just pile them in a chair you know we were real poor people and I looked something white coming to me and I thought I was looking at that chair clothed but it's that angel of the Lord

the musicians can be Miss thank you if we're worshiping him because of who he is then our worship will never cease because he never changes so no matter what the weather's like or whether we're up on the mountain in the valley whether life is going good for us or bad for us our worship Remains the Same because he is the same and I think that's where our worship should come from is because of who he is he's God He reigns and and if he never does anything for us again if he never answers another prayer and we all know he's answered our prayers but if he never does any of that he's still worthy of our worship amen and I hope that he has left an imprint on our heart so deep that no matter how dark the night may get the low the valley the no matter where you're at and how tough it is that you'll never forget who he really is amen that's right habac habac if you would like to turn there and it's just good to see everyone here this morning and um uh different ones we've been missing uh for a little while due to sickness and and uh but certainly good to uh have you back with us amen we always um miss miss you when you're gone and um that we appreciate everyone coming out to the house

through the worship father and we just ask now that you wouldd anoint the speaking of your word as well as the hearing in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen habac uh We've read this here and you all know it I'm sure by heart but uh chapter 2 and one um we will um start there I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie and though it t wait for it because it shall it it will surely uh come and it will not t amen then uh uh Revelations the 10th chapter uh this is a personal scripture for us and uh we should see it as that and take comfort and knowing that we're part of iten uh Revelations the 10th chapter and our faith should be built upon scripture shouldn't it upon the promises of God and um so Revelations 10 and eight and I and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again saying go take go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings amen you can have your seats this morning and I want to just speak about the vision and um I guess I titled it uh the vision shall speak and many many sermons have been uh preached uh about these two scriptures and um so really I'm not saying anything new to you and don't Endeavor to try I guess um but we we want to just uh maybe uh you know uh uh reaffirm I guess bring to our remembrance of what the vision is and what God has done and uh you know if if a vision comes from God then then we take it as thus sayith the Lord if if if it is because then it is God speaking and if it is God speaking then the vision is sure it's it's it cannot fail it must come to pass brother Brandon was so sure of visions that he had received uh that he uh he he even said you know that if if he were to if God was to speak to him by Vision that George Washington was going to raise from the dead he uh tomorrow at 2:00 or whatever he said I'd invite the whole world bring your chairs and come and and watch it be fulfilled he said because it it it cannot fail because it's of God ain't that right I had uh asked them to play a uh uh uh tape of brother Brandon just talking about visions that he had I was listening to him this morning and just really inspired by them and and maybe things that we had heard but uh before uh but brother leil had asked him to do a recording on just certain on on Visions so brother Bram took 35 minutes I think of talking about them and uh but he talked about of the Armenian woman who had been crippled and laid in bed her legs were were uh uh folded under her and she laid in bed for 17 years and uh uh so uh he he had come to the house because of uh he was working on the utility company and and so he was checking the electric and things and so uh the the her daughter uh noticed him and recognized him he was just a young man at that time single and and uh and so he wasn't World known but uh a certain thing had happened to just a few days ago that caused issues in the hospital uh a man was dying and he went in there uh the man had been totally crushed it was a a black man and he had gotten ran over by a car and he just he all of his bones were broken and brother brandham had a vision of him and went in there and had the man to get up and and it just callused the Ruckus in the hospital doctors like no way ran him out ran brother brand him out and uh but the man uh was running a fever of 104 and and the fever broke and the man got up and despite what the doctor said and got and walked out brother brandom said I waited for him out of the hospital for him to walk out because that's what the vision had to him and so it had caused a lot of ruckus in town and so when he went up to this door this little this young lady uh uh said you know are you that man and are you the Healer and he said well I'm not a Healer and he said well my mom wants to talk to you and so he went in and talked to this lady and she says can I walk and and he said well I don't know he said i' God have to show me well he left and and he saw a vision of that woman so he went and got uh uh young convert that he had led to the Lord Brother George di I believe and and and they went and uh he prayed for her and he said thus say the Lord he said I saw a vision of you you're going to walk he said now get out of that bed and and and he he says that she with her Armenian Bible over her heart started moving towards the side of the bed and as she did he says Satan spoke to me and said you let her hit that floor she'll break her neck off that High bed and he said I got scared for a moment yeah but then he says but I had always know that what them Vision he said now I didn't know it was a vision then see he said but what them Visions had told me was always right so I went ahead and let her come off the bed anyhow in other words he didn't restrict her from fulfilling the vision he let her go ahead and fulfill the vision she had to fulfill the vision the vision said she going to walk so he couldn't even let his own fear that sat was trying to bring in him let restrict her from fulfilling what the vision had already said and he said and God being my witness as soon as she started she jumped from that bed and both legs come straight see because the vision had to be fulfilled if it was just brother brandham saying it that's one thing but the vision he already saw her healed and so he had to act upon the vision he was telling her according to the vision get out of that bed ain't that right see so so anything that is part of the vision it must it it it has to be there in order for the vision to be fulfilled brother bradam talked of the vision of seeing that little boy uh man had come to his house again early in the ministry and his ministry and and and and said you know uh brother Brandon I'm backslid and he i' just murdered or I'd murdered a boy a man and uh uh got in a fight and broke his neck and things like that and he says I've suffered a lot of lot of troubles and things he said my one of my boys have already died he said now my little boy three-year-old boy is dying and I think he was three and and uh said could you could you come and and and have prayer and so brother brandham went but he had a vision of that boy he had a vision of that boy uh living and and here is when he got there the boy was just barely breathing and just very shallow and but but in this Vision he saw other people in the vision in that room he saw a certain his hat or a man's hat or his hat or something like that laying right there he saw an elderly woman sitting in a certain place she had put her maybe it was her hat or her coat or her something there and and he saw another brother Graham snailing that hadn't even been preaching at that time uh saw him sitting in a certain certain uh place in the room and all that but brother brandham got ahead of the vision and he went and prayed for that boy and the boy got worse and he's like oh no what what's going on then he realized that not everybody in the vision is is there the the the grandmother wasn't there Grand Snelling wasn't sitting where he's supposed to be in other words not no one was position what the vision had said and so he started to worry and you all know the story but as as brother uh uh uh Graham he's getting ready to go for work and and and so brother Graham's like oh no what do I do so they asked well do do we want you want to go on home and he said no he said I'll just stay right here and and as they were getting ready to leave that that elderly woman he uh come up and walked into the house and he says there it is you know we needed her and and he says I got up out of the seat because she's supposed to be sitting where I'm supposed to be sitting so he got up and he moved and watched her put the hat or put whatever she needed to put went over there and sat down in that spot and then brother Graham Snelly he said I had to wait for him and he went over there and sat down in the spot in in the in the other place and everything was according to the vision and then he says now he said now do you believe me still to be a a of God and all these things yes brother Brandon and he went and prayed and that boy got up and walked and and and he says now he went back and he told his church he says now you wait he says I'm going to go over there and and he says he said I want all of y'all to go and he says y'all stand there and watch he's that little boy when when I come into that room that little boy is going to say look brother brandom I can walk or something to that effect and he invited his whole church they loaded up in cars and and and truck trucks and they all gathered around the house looking in the windows and he walked in there and and and he shook the the the mom's hand and all that and here come he goes she goes well look here's brother brandom and here come that three-year-old little kid walking up Hey brother brandom look I can walk see it was all according to the vision the vision was so certain ain't that right and the vision could not be fulfilled until everyone was possessed Al placed in in in what that was in or part of the vision ain't that right brother brandom talks of another time of of uh having a vision of a girl uh uh that had needen prayer and and he saw her walking but he didn't know where she lived and he knew the vicinity of the place uh the mother had mailed him a letter and uh asking him to come he saw the vision and and so but he really didn't know where she lived and and so there was some people that he invited to come and he says they were all crammed in the car you know uh uh the women were sitting on one another's laps and and here they go down the road and he knew it was in a certain place and and and and so he told him he says but he said now in the vision there was a man and and he says now he says see uh he saw a a a yellow store and he says and they passed it he goes now there's that yellow front store he says now he says now you watch he said a man is going to come out of there with a blue overalls on a white yellow quarter cap with a white mustache and he's going to tell me where to go and he said and if he doesn't do that he says then I'm a biggest Storyteller well they passed it and there he and there comes the man he walks right out got the mustache got the cap got the overalls everything to describe one he says one sister fainted uh right then in the car and and he stops and and he he uh uh uh uh stops and he tells that man notice what he tells that man he didn't ask that man for direction he said sir you're are to tell me where Harold nail uh is and he said yes sir did you come from the south he said I did he said well you passed it a half mile down the road so he begins to tell him he said you find a big red barn now brother Bram described the house to to to the the people that were with him he said it's on your second H second house on your right and da d da and he said why are you wanting to know he said well he's got a Afflicted daughter see doesn't he and he said yes sir he does I said well the Lord is going to heal her and the old man started crying see he never knew so he was included in the vision and yet he didn't even know what was going on but the vision he didn't have to know the vision already declared him the vision already showed what he would do ain't that right see the vision it's it's so powerful the vision now you know uh uh the vision that the the prophet uh habac I guess uh is speaking of is God's Vision God had a vision uh of what he had in his mind as we know and and because of his infinite knowledge he could foretell the end from the beginning and Acts 15:18 says known unto God are all of his works from the beginning of the world so this Vision existed in God's mind and it it it it and and and he didn't leave it there he didn't just leave it there but he expressed this Vision in word he expressed it in word uh uh and and then of course uh he wanted the vision to come to pass and so it could couldn't come to pass as long as it was in his mind as a as a thought it had to be expressed in the word and when it was expressed in the word now now brother brandom already told us that the vision was already it wasn't a wish it wasn't a hope it wasn't a just a plan it was a reality it was as though it was already done in God's mind because it was eternal it's a vision ain't that right and so uh uh uh but it wouldn't come to pass in in into a reality form unless it was expressed in word but the Bible tells us that we were part of that Vision amen and to think of this amen uh and we know the scripture but Ephesians 1 and4 according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and and this means that we were with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and brother BR says that gives an eternal quality to the elect can you say Amen that that gives an eternal quality to the elect and you cannot get away from that you you can and and so Paul would go on even as as in his love he chose us in other words he actually picked us out for himself as his own and that right in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy consecrated set apart for him and blameless in his sight even uh even uh as one translation above reproach before him in love ain't that right so we were to be above reproach this is what the vision speaks of us we were chosen in him with him in him in love ain't that right chosen to be for his own amen see I I think it it it it's encouraging to know what what the vision does speak of us amen but see a genuine Christian is an eternal thought of God brother Brown said the bride was already in his mind she already existed in his mind so she's not just coming into existence now but she had already EX existed ain't that right it was the vision amen see and and so she was existing in his thoughts you know as we we know brother brandom tells us and the Bible tells us that God has never had a new thought about anything brother Bram said all of his thoughts uh he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real see they're not simply like a man with the blueprint he is drawn up at which one day will be translated into substance and form but they already real and eternal and part of God so God's not just drawing something up it's real can you say Amen it's a reality so then being an eternal thought of God makes you part of God Amen aren't you glad for that so then no matter how little you may seem and what little part you play in in in in in whatever in in life if you're part of the vision then you are important and the vision could not be fulfilled until you came and and and the Rapture can't happen until everything is just right I believe that God knows every individual that'll be in that Rapture I I just believe that amen not not is he just throwing it out there that there's going to be a Rapture and there's going to be a changing of the body and and not only does he say we which are alive as though it's just you know uh thrown in general but God knows every individual that that speaks of do you believe that and it could not happen it could not happen in 63 it could not H because I wasn't there in ' 63 it couldn't happen in 70 uh or whatever because I wasn't there yet you understand what I'm saying and and sometimes we wonder God why is it taken so long for this to happen maybe God waiting for that little one to come Amen to prove his word if because if they're part of the vision that everyone is going to be there and not one is going to be left behind do you believe that amen see a vision can be very dist uh descriptive amen not just thrown in general but it could tell the color of hair it could tell I mean it tell it brother Brandon would see you know talking to a patient in the prayer line and describe the doctor to a tea because that's what a vision can do ain't that right when the vision is shown then it has to be exactly right on target do you believe that or not amen see so then we we find that you're just as much as important to God in the vision as maybe the Evangelist that that that P that travels the world over amen and and and maybe he's doing his part and everybody's doing their part and but it couldn't happen the rapture cannot take place amen until every individual no matter how young no matter how little the job or whatever no one can take your place so then if you're an eternal thought of God then God can never take you out of his memory can you say Amen you you're here by a vision do you believe that you're here by a vision it's one thing for brother brandom you know brother brandom sometime with telling you now if I never saw a vision of that individual I'd pray but and just tell them well just you know go on but if it's a vision then it's got to happen that's the difference can you say man I'm not here trying to build you a hope there is a vision behind this there's a vision behind this message can you say man this message is going to work it's it's it's taking a hold of somebody because it's a vision it's a vision that's why you don't need Psychology you just need the message it's it's a there's a vision here can you say amen and God can never stop thinking of you do you believe that true amen for you're an eternal thought amen that is now baptized into the body of Christ to be expressed amen so if brother R you know talked about how that God always had his thoughts for Adam but as as the thought of God God yet he was uh uh he was yet unexpressed see as the thought of God he was as yet unexpressed and and and then brother Brandon gives the scripture Psalms 139 15 starting it says my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my stuff yet being unperfect and and in thy book all my members were written and which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them ain't that right now brother BR says even though this was not written of Adam yet it still gives us an idea and knowledge that the thought was there in the mind of God Amen you were there in the mind of God see so then a a true vision is thus say the Lord to the people amen and and and then it becomes God's promise Amen to us because it will never fail it shall come to pass and and therefore it is the absolute do you believe that amen it is our absolute it was an absolute to brother brandham was it not Amen to that woman that that he's laid there 17 years and Satan was trying to put it in his mind that she going to break her neck if she gets off that but the vision became an absolute Amen to him to where that he knew that if she would get up amen God would sustain her that's what the vision said ain't that right that's what the vision said amen so if God said I can do it then I can do it if God says you can do it you can do it ain't that right if he's called you to do something then you can do it don't say you can't do it God said you can do it amen it's according to the vision can you say Amen if he ordained that I should bring forth fruit and that my fruit should remain there's nothing going to stop that that's what I'm I'm called to do exactly a ain't that right it's going to be that way it's a perfect vision now Vision uh uh refers to spiritual enlightenment and insight into Divine things vision and this word Enlightenment is to furnish knowledge to illuminate to give Spirit insight to see so so so here here is what the the Paul uh Apostle Paul in Ephesians 1:16 said I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him ain't that right the eyes of your understanding being enlightened ain't that right so he's praying that we would catch the vision and ain't that right catch the vision amen see that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints what is the exceeding greatness God wants us to know what these things are for us he wants to know what the inheritance his inheritance is he wants us to know the hope of his calling he wants to know us to know what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the work of his mighty power ain't that right now now I believe that this scripture was was fulfilled uh uh well well we'll put it this way goes in line with the opening of the book Because when this is what happened to John when the book became open he saw himself in the vision ain't that right he saw himself in the vision brother R said he must have saw his name there ain't that right so so then then you you look at 1 Samuel 3:1 and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days very rare in those days because there was no open Vision ain't that right so hearing the word of the Lord amen uh the voice of the Lord connecting with the vision amen it it it it was rare because the the hearing of the voice of the Lord was rare in that day and and there there were many just like it is today there were many other voices sounding out that was drowning out the voice of God Amen and so uh uh because of this there was no open Vision uh the voice of God was silent see and and so then then uh uh uh if there's no open Vision then there's no knowledge but Paul is saying I pray pray that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened that that you that the this revelation of the knowledge of God would come to you amen see amen but but there had to be an open Vision ain't that right see when we speak of vision we're speaking of the knowledge of the Lord amen it's it's something that is is man cannot have on his own uh uh it's just like when the Lord asked um uh uh Ezekiel the prophet there when he's looking at this valley of dry bones are scattered all over the valley and he asks ask Ezekiel can these bones live and the prophet asked answered the right way thou knowest right thou knowest he didn't know if they could live it was too despairing it was a condition that would just looked too impossible but see he just needed a word from God and when he got the word from God he can act upon the word of God ain't that right but just within himself amen who is he to say ain't that right amen see so with the vision we're we're speaking of the knowledge of the Lord uh The Book of Proverbs actually tells us to find the knowledge of God find the knowledge of God also it says he says out of the mouth of God cometh knowledge and understanding see so if the voice of God isn't speaking then the vision isn't being made known see the vision must speak can you say Amen the vision has to be declared it has to be made known see and and and I want to say it this way not just in voice not as it just made known in voice but also in manifestation ain't that right amen for for uh the angel told Brother brandham your your your life speaks louder than your words can you say am man your life now notice uh and and hopefully making sense a little bit but brother brandham talks about the three-fold purpose of God and and this this to me has to do with the vision of God Amen the three-fold purpose was what first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily ain't that right then second part is toing bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading ain't that right then thirdly uh the threefold uh third part is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with this people talked with them and fellowshipped with him ain't that right see so the vision is being fulfilled now habach uh 2:14 it speaks of a time when the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the water cover the sea ain't that right so the whole earth is going to be filled with this knowledge of the Lord and and it doesn't mean that that the preachers are going to rise up and the singers are going to rise up and they're going to start preaching and evangelizing ring and and and and the singers are going to sing and the testifiers testify that's not where that's not the knowledge that he's speaking of uh but this knowledge feeling the the Earth amen is actually the vision coming to its manifestation the vision coming to its full entire manifestation can you say Amen of what God had in his mind the knowledge of the Lord the knowledge amen see amen uh uh uh we we we think of it right now preachers are preaching we had a prophet uh speak and there there's the tapes and all that that is revealing the knowledge of God Amen revealing the mind of God to us ain't that right but then the knowledge is getting more real to us it's like the Shadow and and and the hand you know as it's coming close Closer Closer close it's coming to a greater knowledge until the Shadow and the Hand become one ain't that right well see we we find amen that this knowledge of the Lord that's going to fill the Earth brother bradam says this this is when the enemy has been put away the end of sin has come the bringing in of an everlasting righteousness has come Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the Waters cover the sea amen or or as the waters covers the sea see glory to God it's coming brother it's coming women will be ladies men will be gentlemen No More Tears no more sorrow no more pain no more Agony no more loneliness no more mind battles no no more struggles why God never had that part in his vision amen he saw a bride perfected he saw a bride living with him he saw a peaceful Reign he saw an everlasting rain he saw a people that was Triumph amen that death could not bother anymore corruption sickness and all these things see it's a knowledge that we're coming to even greater and greater and greater amen praise the Lord say so there will be nothing to Cloud the vision contradict the vision and all these things a ain't that right now notice in Proverbs 29 and 18 it says where there's no vision the people perish amen we could take that in a lot of ways but the the strong concordance says where there is no prophecy the people perish now let me ask you what future do we have if there's no vision what what hope do we have in this life if there if there is no vision if if H how can a man TR truly have genuine peace in a time of turbulence if there is no vision can you say Amen so you know I mean did did God Save Us only for us to be lost in the end not according to the vision did did God uh go with us all the way and then one of these days he's just going to leave us and forsake us I I I not according to the vision see see there's a vision that that God is working working in ain't that right amen did did God protect us all these years only to leave us annihilated at the end not according to the vision can you say Amen see see and and and so then because there is Vision we hear a message Shalom we hear the words that is spoken and brother Brandon said I'm speaking to the elect now Shalom and yet he didn't have to be here when you were born he didn't have to be here to see the trials that you're going through he didn't have to to be here to see how more wicked the world is now no he saw according to a vision he saw a bride already formed he saw that bride not going down the eel he saw that bride going up and according to the vision you're not here to tell him everything you're going through but that doesn't matter or he's not here here for you to tell him these things but it doesn't matter you already hear a voice Shalom because he had a vision it's a vision brother brand spoke according to a vision sir did he not amen sure he did now we we we're to find this knowledge of God we're to come to the knowledge of God but we can't do it without an open Vision amen see because the vision is so far beyond our own ability to understand amen Isaiah 558 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as high as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways my thoughts higher than your thoughts ain't that right then you got here 1 Corinthians 2:9 Paul says you know I have not seen nor ear heard neither has been entered into the heart of man the things the things the things which God ha prepared is he coming up with things on a daily basis no it's according to the vision is it not you we we already know that Moses patterned the Tabernacle after a vision he saw in heaven after a Heavenly Tabernacle amen he just caught up in that Vision yes sir see but God the things which God ha prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God ain't that right amen we never knew by our natural understanding we never knew we were part of that Vision but we are amen ain't that right and look look what the Bible says first uh or Psalms 10216 when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in glory praise the lord it's part of the vision that's right hell amen and and and who is this Zion I mean this is in the Old Testament this is thousands of years right I believe we are that people that he was speaking us amen praise the Lord amen to God and I believe that Revelations 101 is part of that scripture when he builds up this body Zion the bride he himself will come and appear in his glory hallelujah amen hello sir can you say Amen but it's part of a vision it wasn't just a man speaking of something that prophecy was sure to happen and here you are by [Music] visionen Hallelujah see I believe that's speaking of us in this day when he and the bride unites together in holy Union and they become one ain't that right right what about 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then which we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one of these one another with these words can you say amen amen and yet we could not understand that scripture we could not apply that scripture yet it's a vision vision it's God's Vision can you say Amen but when our eyes become enlightened we realize that we're living in not just a church age we're living in a Rapture age it's an age of rapture we are the people he was speaking of Amen all right but see our minds are finite our knowledge is limited and our knowledge comes from the carnal true perverted knowledge so it takes God to reveal it first amen now we know the scripture but deu Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong to us ain't that right unto our children forever now brother Bram says see the word is God and as the word as the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word they come together in a union can you say amen amen now what what what I I like about that is is is that we could not come into a union until these things were revealed to us can you say Amen the secret things belong to the Lord but them things that were revealed belong to us can you say amen and God had to make it known he's made this this Vision known in this last day we're not poppers we're Sons and Daughters of God we're not weak and beggarly we are we are this is the time for manifestation of sons of God where Sons will go back to an authority and I believe that that Authority is in us today but it had to be revealed to us it could not just stay as a thought it could not just stay as a as a promise it had to be revealed now it belongs to you now it belongs it belongs to you it belongs to I can you say Amen to me see so now they're coming together in a union in a union see they unite like a wedding see and they're getting ready for a wedding they become one right not not God in a shadow now becoming one can you say Amen not not not just we're looking in the scriptures for for something now it's becoming a reality he says the word becomes you and you become the word ain't that right the word becomes you and you become the word now it belongs to you every promise in this book is mine I don't have to just read it I can act upon it I I'm becoming it you're becoming this you're the vision praise the Lord and notice brother Bram said you become the word as you receive the word how many wants to receive the word God help us to receive the word God help us to receive the word what if brother Brandon would have received what Satan was trying to tell him about that woman getting off the bed if she gets off that bed she going to break her neck but he refused to received that he he received what God said about it amen can you say Amen we can understand that we're not receiving a words of a man we're receiving a vision we're receiving what God had in his mind about us amen yes sir now how does he reveal the vision the vision Amos 3:7 surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets that's right now the Bible tells us that God is not an author of confusion that's ain't that right I I hope you don't get tired of me saying it but you know this is why God would send us a Prophet this is why we we we you know there's good good preachers out there there's good you know television evangelist and and these things powerful men out there that can you know that can preach a message and wow it seems so good and and all these things but the Revelation lays within the message the Lord can you say amen I you know uh it's not a theologian Vision it's God's Vision ain't that right amen that's why he could take a seventh grade Kian amen and reveal his own Vision because it comes through a prophet he didn't need a smart man to reveal his vision he didn't need a denomination you know denominations got their own Vision but we are a people that is lining up with God's vision and that Vision had to be revealed by way of a prophet now Prophet means sear he's he's one that for Tails forth Tails so brother Braham said see notice the vision comes to the prophets and it's the word of the Lord spoken to them amen God gives the true Prophet the true vision and he deals with all prophets by Vision ain't that right so then we we know that this Bible is God's Vision amen because 2 Timothy 3:15 all scripture is given by inspiration of God ain't that right all scripture then then first or 2 Timothy 1:20 knowing this verse that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy or would say the vision came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so then we know that this this Bible is uh man is not the author of this Bible God is the author of this Bible and it's the vision of God that would come that the prophets receive so then the prophet said this what makes the Bible a different book than all the sacred books there are it's a book book of Prophecy for telling future events it's also the revelation of Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis to Revelation brings him out in his fullness what he was and is can you say amen amen so now this this Bible is is a vision written by God uh by the prophets uh by the vision that they saw but then the prophet said the the the all the prophets everybody say all the prophets spoke of this day all the prophets spoke of this day and he says see we're living in the in in the greatest time of all ages we're now living just at the closing of scene of this world's activities and fixing to enter into that great age that we've looked for for so long the Hebrew prophets had spoke of through the day yeah so this Vision was not just for Isaiah's day it wasn't just for Jeremiah but they've actually all of them were speaking of this day that's why we can get blessed we don't want to take anything out of this Bible amen can you say Amen brother Ram says now the Hebrew prophets the two major themes and practically from somewhere along in every chapter of the Bible from Genesis to Malachi you can find one of those subjects being dealt with all the way through the Bible the coming of the Messiah and the anointing and sending forth of the church into all the world prise the lord so two themes the Messiah and the church praise God ain't that right and it's spoke of in symbols by animals and so forth and like great armies and so forth that Marches On and runs over the walls and so forth the different like Locust everything was in symbols and Parables straight teachings and everything comes down to those two subjects the Messiah and the church praise God glory amen how sure are you how sure is your salvation how sure is your destiny how sure is your present state of where you're at today you're not just wandering there's been a prophecy spoke so the vision is a bride and bridegroom ain't that right so then brother Bram says every word is absolutely a part of almighty God Amen God made manifest wound into his word to show forth who he is and we're commanded as Believers to believe every word of it so no wonder those that would take take away or add to it is cursed of God can you say amen Amen brother Bram says to to take away or to add to would be to disfigure Christ his body can you say man he said it would be a freak body of God that's true it would have maybe like six fingers and one hand or three arms or something to add something or to take something away from that see it'd be you know and be you know one arm short or one finger short it's the complete everybody say it's the complete body of Jesus Christ and in Christ being the male the groom the bride is represented in him also and these two are one at that day you shall know that I am in my father the father in me I in you and you in me ain't that right so this Bible is a complete picture ain't that right yes that's why we must guard with everything that we have in US guard this Bible amen guard it in our hearts ain't that right because God's bringing this church to something it's it's in his vision come on now prise the Lord do you believe that amen and no wonder Satan is doing everything he can to add or take away he even do it within our own mind true thinking that God's done with you or thinking that God doesn't love you or thinking that you know you're you're you're just washed up or you're not going to make it or this or that so many thoughts don't you let him take away from the vision amen amen first of all the bridegroom came forth from the book that was God's part the first part of God's threefold me uh uh vision and the word became flesh for he was the vision of the Messiah secondly the bride in this day comes forth from the book the word made flesh also you believe it yeah why the prophet said she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power notice how he's describing you as as being the bride you know why he's seeing it in a vision ain't that right he's seeing it in a vision and he's telling you what you are according to the vision amen hallelujah that's right life of his life power of his power she is him not different she is him that's it sometimes I think we hear that too much that it just becomes like brother Brown talks about the the the young man going one never been seen the sea before so he's going to look to the Sea you know he's so excited about the sea and sees that old Sean whatever and and and God say where are you going oh I'm going to go you know so he's just talking so much about the sea and and the air and all these things a you know and the guy's like I you know and and he the the guy's reaction the captain's reaction or Seaman is I've been here all this time I he wasn't see seeing what this young man was seeing but it become so common to him amen and I think sometimes these these little things that brother Bram tells us is so common true and then the devil is able to ride over that because we don't see the preciousness of it can you say Amen but we must guard this we must believe these things with all of our heart so much is this Bible so sacred that even brother Brown tells us don't put nothing on this Bible don't set your phone on the Bible don't set a cup on the Bible don't don't set this on the Bible don't set nothing on the Bible it's a sacred book when I see people putting it on the floor and they just tossing their Bibles I've seen people just toss their Bible I'm think what in the world they doing amen but sometimes we allow this thing to become very common to us in our hearts if we are to to hold this lital Bible sacred how much should we hold the word of God sacred in our heart don't you let the devil over it it's a vision it's you it's your guarantee that you're going to make it it's your guarantee God's already put you in the book so now here is a prophet reading your story positioning you in the vision sinner you wasn't you you wasn't in the vision as a sinner you wasn't in the vision as a vagabond you wasn't in the vision as some slave to the devil can you say Amen so God's been waiting and waiting and holding back the Rapture for you to come into the vision as he saw you now here's a prophet positionally placing Us in the vision you're not just a a a bride you are Miss Jesus Christ there's been Brides brides revivals revivals churches churches but now you are here that's not only got the uh the mechanics but the Dynamics you are what he saw in the vision amen now notice he says therefore we must be that word bride we must be the [Music] vision oh God don't don't settle down for just anything amen don't just settle down because you believe that God sent a prophet whoee Lord on so the uring sometimes when you talk to ministers and oh God sent a prophet and so you sit down and talk with them and you try to tell him about the problems well brother Brown messed messed up there and then they begin to tell you all the mistakes in this message and I want to think why I want to tell them why in the world are you hearing the message [Applause] anyways it's not good enough to be just say well God sent a prophet you've got to be a word bride [Applause] sitting there criticizing you know people have the audacity to CR criticize preachers but then it's worse I think to sit there in a Pew and or listening to a tape or whatever and critize the Very Prophet that God is used to reveal his secrets you say well he he just you know he contradicted himself so much do you realize the Revelation lays between the lines the prophet said you can't take this Bible and read it like you would a newspaper the Revelation is in the lines in between the lines can you say amen and same way with it you just can't re you can't just listen to this messages with carnal ears amen amen are you with me now watching your little movies and watch watchingg this and carrying on this and holding your tempers and and your and and your your grudges and all of these things and the gossip and then we're going to play a tape today it ain't going to work that way you've got to get in the spirit of it get in the spirit of it to where God begins to reveal what is actually being said giving you a picture of yourself in the book amen yes you believe it amen see therefore we must be that word bride we must be now notice what he says and what is that word bride good question right he says the manifestation of this hour the bride the manifestation of this hour right praise God you think Le leaning to your Pentecostal ways is going to help you you you got to die to that thing that's right amen hallelujah leaning the Presbyterian ways and Baptist ways and legalist ways and all kinds of ways coming into this message then we want to correct brother bradam and we want to do away with what he said if brother Bram says that dancing in the spirit is a sign of Victory let's say it that way I don't care what other people do there are kinds of fanatics but it doesn't take away from a bride hallelu if he speaks in certain ways and said this church is to be moving in the power of God then don't you settle down for some mediocre formality bless God bless God Amen can you say Amen see the word what is the word bride the Manifest of this hour the bride not a Creed nor a denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride see that's to be expressed how do we know it's be to expressed it's in the book it's in the vision right amen and now we're here in this age Hallelujah Hall we're at the finale of it all Hallelujah can you say Amen brothers and sisters the head has come to the body the intelligence is now in the body bless God bless God it is you realize brother Brown talks about that we're this is the age of life he said this is the age of life the personal life of Jesus Christ prise God you see God's been building up building up building up all through the church ages go listen to the Masterpiece building up through the church ages and and there's been baptisms under the Son of God dispensation there's been baptism of the Holy Spirit brother BR said Luther had the baptism Wesley had the baptism of the holy spirit so there's been life all the way through amen sure but in this age did you notice it's not Son of God it's son of man and under this son of man age brother Bram now takes the Holy Ghost and says it's a token amen never has there ever been a requirement for a token except this age that's right that's what brother brand says but what does that mean it means that the personal life the fullness of Christ is now in the church not just a little bit to wiggle your toe not just a little bit to to to stutter around by your tongue but the whole life of God is now in the church as Christ what God was in Christ so Christ is in you you can't get any higher than the token for it's himself impersonated in the [Applause] church we've come to the fullness of the vision we're it they without us cannot be made perfect they've been waiting for us can you say Amen they've been looking for us I H ly believe that when he said the psalmist says let the redeemed of the Lord say so oh let the redeemed of the Lord say so oh let the yeah y'all read that chapter he'll talk about the goodness of God and he says let the redeemed of the Lord say so then he goes on talking about the the goodness of God oh that man would praise the Lord let the redeemed of the Lord say so and he's going on on on I just can't help believe that there was that pulsing of the spirit looking for a time that a people would rise up and fulfill that scripture the redeemed of the Lord why because of the music no but because the word had become open and they see themselves in the book John was our type and he began to worship he began to praise God he begin to have a Revival it was a bride's Revival that was so far from the regular revivals that they had had all the way down can you say Amen oh Jesus Christ in the church today we must become we must become that a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living see if you're not part of a vision yep you you you can go to church you can be religious you can do all the dos and don'ts you could have it all pat down you can know this Bible backward and forward and I I'll even go as far as you can say the message backward and forward and all these things but what separates you from the the the others is there's a vision concerning you a vision concerning you and it's so far superior than your abilities it's so far superior than your own knowledge you didn't even have to know that you were bride God called you out because he knew you were bride praise the Lord I believe that God knew Rebecca when Abraham sent his servant elzer to go find a a bride for Isaac I believe that God already knew amen praise God eler probably didn't but he was sent on an errand to go get a bride but here was a prophet now giving us in between the lines that you don't have to worry or wonder how did Rebecca get there did he just pick the first girl he saw did she just happen to be there no brother Brown said an angel of the Lord went before elzer and beat him there 30 minutes 30 minutes before elzar got there the angel of the Lord was already working on Rebecca saying go to the well go nudging her go to the well why he already had her in the vision amen can you say Amen no wonder the prophet couldn't get discouraged the spirit of the Lord was upon that man giving him the strength every night to get up and preach and there were people rejecting him and and hating him they tried every which way to prove him false and a fraud and Fa all these things and he the preachers forsook him and thought he was too dumb and and all these things you all know all these things that he talked about but the spirit of the Lord was directing him to that Pulpit every night but I believe the spirit of the Lord's been directing us too the spirit of the Lord you didn't just come to this message by coincidence the spirit of the Lord been directing you it's been pushing you it's been protecting you brother be because there's a vision praise the Lord Jesus there's a vision amen now so so first there was Messiah the bridegroom second there's the bride which that's what we are but then there's that third that we're entering into to and brother Brown said he's going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeemed back home again that's Christ in the church today what is his Fallen wife what is that redeemed bride Christ in his church today and now he's taking her back home amen oh my it's so wonderful isn't it so wonderful and and that's when the glory or the knowledge of the Lord uh uh is is going to fill the whole Earth amen is when it all comes to completion can you say Amen oh yes sir see and not one member is going to be left behind no sir brother Brown he says this he says I can hear the angels move back and bow their heads I look come out walking Yonder from behind those doors here there he comes the King of Kings the Lord of lords and he walks down along the table and wiping each one's eyes and putting his arm around them and saying now don't cry it's all over now all of them are here there's not one of them gone they're all here now enter into the joy of the Lord oh that my heart jumps when I think of that see that's not these little fiction stories of Santa Claus that's thus sayith the Lord and that's the seed that's right now becoming materialized right now it's moving in now church this world is shaking it's quaking things are falling apart and Trump ain't going to fix that but who cares I'm neither Democrat nor Republican I'm a Son of God praise the Lord and we know what's happening this world is falling apart because our kingdom is being ushered in Satan is going to be done away with and everything that we have fought against and we that's been on our minds and everything it's all going to be loose from us we're entering into something church can you say Amen you're not wasting your time believing this message you're not wasting your time every time you say Amen to this message every time you give in to this message amen you're not wasting your time praise the Lord the Lord God going to come take you home amen now we don't have to be reminded but it is good to be reminded that all these these these these uh uh uh aliens or whatever they call UFOs they're here and brother B says they're here they're angels and they're going to pick you up one these days and take you home and never has it been outside of this age that them UFOs have been here they're investigating angels for this age amen can you say Amen so don't you think that you're alone God's watching you he knows you he knows where you're at he knows your number he's got you do you believe that he's got your number sister marth's got your number yes sir if you're part of the vision don't you worry he's coming for you part of the vision so there's no way you can be left behind amen ain't that right now you say well how do I know how how do I know that it's me well now notice brother brandham said this he says now you wouldn't have to necessarily have your name in the Bible that's right but as long as you're in Christ you're in the Bible amen you're in him in the Bible that's right as long as you're in Christ then you are in the fullness of the Bible not one promise is going to be be left you amen you're not going to be deprived of nothing you're in the fullness of the Bible you're in full position when you're in [Music] Christ amen well I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I don't know if I'm going in a Rapture hogwash oh my Lord you're in full position well I know he can heal me but I just don't know if he can deliver me what you're in full position so why not just believe all of it that's right and act this word my wife probably tells me live What You Preach that's right act upon it amen us act upon it speak it say it that's right believe it am see the vision or the word that came to the prophets was so beyond their capability of understanding or even providing such accuracy they would only speak as the vision came to them but they knew it wasn't them they knew it was of God so they put they themselves put their hopes into it they they put their faith in it they well uh uh uh Hebrews 11:13 tells these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off not being in this day but they saw your day they spoke of your day not having been in messiah's day but they spoke of him because they saw him can you say Amen having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them that's right think of that now by seeing them a far off and believe me it was a vague maybe they didn't understand everything that was happening yes but they knew something was happening and they knew it was of God they knew what they were seeing was sure it was a solid foundation that they would actually not live for this day it's just like Messiah as I've said so many times before they had I believe the prophet saw Messiah they saw the lamb so here they come and they offered the natural lamb and many people many of the Israelites probably just looked at that lamb and said well bless God this is where I'm at but those that were able to see past that lamb and see the true lamb they saw it a far off and they embraced that lamb knowing that this lamb spoke of that lamb can you say Amen now those that just looked at that land they got caught up in the traditions and the ideologies and all of that you understand what I'm saying but see that so they were persuaded of them embraced them and and they confessed what they saw made them confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth see the vision was their absolute and the vision is given as a guide do you believe that Lord do you know that Jesus would do nothing but what the father first showed him by Vision yeah uh John 5:19 the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise amen so see brother Braham said that's how the father dealt with Jesus was by Vision he was limited to what his father would tell him to do see so he wasn't led by emotions he wasn't led by Impressions he wasn't led by how he felt and and and all these things which which ought to tell us that if Jesus would only act upon vision and and that vision would be his absolute that that he saw the vision of that that man uh uh at the pool of Bethesda that he would step over everybody ignore everybody that was around that was dying that needed him even more but he didn't have that vision for them and he looked for that one man and told him to now he had the power to tell everyone to get up but but he never the vision was his absolute can you say Amen so then the vision should our be be our absolute for it's the only thing that is thus say the Lord now notice what brother Bram said about the bride of Christ they do only his will just as Jesus did he said amen I believe that no one can persuade them different no matter what little RI revivals come and what looks good and how many emotions and how many this and what everybody else is doing no one persuade them different they have thus set the Lord or they keep still it has to be the vision or they keep still true so the vision has to be first can you say Amen am oh do you love him amen that's good amen wonderful I I thought of you know as I get ready to close there's so many interpretations of the word and yet many read from the same Bible that we read from and they get this interpretation that interpretation and we and and to be honest we're finding it even in within the message ranks but the Bible doesn't have one contradiction in in it brother Bram said the the problem is is the people the people let men put their own interpretation of this word and causes them to be deceived he said see the churches cannot agree themselves on the interpretation of it the Methodist can't agree with the Baptist Baptist the Presbyterian Presbyterian Pentecostals whatever he said see with about 40 different organizations of Pentecost they can't agree with one another so you see that would be babbling again Babylon again confusing so so here God would call us out of Babylon by Vision hello something that would be sure not a man leading us to his personality not a man amen leading us to his own idea no no no that just brings confusion again yeah but this message is a vision so he br brings us out of confusion to a sure thing hello so so anything that is trying to bring us back into confusion again it has to be of the devil do you believe that how how can one book bring so many different interpretations well number one Luke 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hi these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes ain't that right so so e even though the vision is written in the book it remains a mystery until God reveals it brother Bri says think of almighty God sitting in his own word with power to Blind the rich and impudent and educated Scholars blind their eyes so they can't see him and Open the Eyes of the poor and illiterate ain't that right but then we we find that even the elect wouldn't be able to see see it if Jesus didn't open our eyes if if our eyes hadn't been open we wouldn't be able to see and this is the proof of it that that here was the two men walking on the road to emus they had just lived out Bible prophecy all the all through these things and the only one that really knew it was Jesus he he knew he was the Messiah he's the one that said I'll raise up in 3 days I believe Maybe the disciples were there to hear him say that but when he was crucified and he was buried then they fell apart and and so here they are the two walking on the road to EMAs they're all downcast they're sad they're talking and then the Bible says Jesus appears right to them begins to talk to them Flesh and Blood talking to them and ask them why are y'all so cast down well are you a stranger here in these parts you know and so they began to tell him the events that has happened and then Jesus he don't even know they don't even know who he is and Jesus starting with the the old well first he says oh you fool slow of heart to believe all the things that the the Bible has said and he starts with Moses and he begins to go through the scriptures concerning himself right and they still don't see it but in the evening time in the evening time is when he went aside in a room with him and he began to break the bread he prayed he blessed that bread and he break the bread the Bible says and he gave it to them and brother brand said something he done there yeah something he' done all of a sudden the Bible says their eyes were open and they knew him but he was laying himself all in the scriptures to them and when the evening time came wow amen yes sir Church we're in this age again in the evening time yes sir oh do you love him if the musicians will come got so much more to go but we'll wait that's good prise the Lord the resurrected Christ has been made known to us today do you believe it amen and I'm I'm so glad that we can see that we're part of that yes sir as he said you know brother brandham in the Easter it is the rising of the Sun what a resurrection that was of 2,000 years ago but what a resurrection this is he has risen again in the form of a bride amen that was part of the vision it's amazing how they they say oh well you need to we we need to we need to check everything brother Braham [Music] says by this Bible and if it ain't in this Bible you don't believe it and all I can say is what morons lightly [Music] put how do you take a Bible and correct a prophet when we didn't even know the Bible it took a prophet to make the Bible known to [Music] us and if we can see that we're not out to set a the prophet correctly and correct him brother Ram even said nobody stood before a prophet nobody stood there before Isaiah Jeremiah and any of them and judged them now a when we're talking of speaking in tongues when we're talking interpretation of tongues Paul said it very clearly as well as the prophet said it over and over very clearly that a church is not to receive that unless it's judged first amen it's got to be judged before it's given to the church amen dreams and so forth I'd like to get into that more because God there is a vision for the church today God didn't call us out of Babylon only to live in confusion in the message no no no no amen there's a real vision for the church how to conduct how to act how to live aren't you glad for that [Music] amen it won't be [Music] long till we'll be leaveing here it won't be long we'll be going home oh count the years as much count the months as [Music] weeks count the weeks as days any day now we're going

soul that's so and um I really U appreciate Steve uh just visiting with him and talking to him and just you know there's a couple times that the Lord has really dealt with him and uh and I'm just believing that one day very very soon that he's going to give his heart to the Lord and so just just remember him in your prayer that the Lord will just so whatever Satan is really just trying to claim him and uh I I believe he wants to surrender his life to God and I really believe that and um it's just Satan's is it's a war it's it's just what he's in right now is a real Warfare Satan's not going to give him up easily but he's got to give him up because we're we're just believing in and um so you just believe with me pray that the Lord will just bring him in soon we we've got different loved ones um you know Sister Jane her children and um you know uh brother Tim sister Martha their daughter and and um you know the different ones I don't know who all is praying for their children but brother Amos Sister Lisa praying for their son and uh you know I I don't want them just to have religion I'm praying that they come into the message get under that token and that's what we're praying for and uh so keep these things in your mind these these these people I know Sister Hannah bat's got children and you know that needs the Lord and no no matter how Wayward and lost they may seem to be I believe in a token amen and according to the vision we've got the authority to lay claim to them and uh so so that's what the vision said and so God bless you love you appreciate you
