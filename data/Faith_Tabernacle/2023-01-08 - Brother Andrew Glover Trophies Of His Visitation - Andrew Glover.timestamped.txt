[47:42] you can go to your church and and carry
[47:45] some of that Revival
[47:48] um that that encouragement in inside of
[47:51] you and let it just spread you know and
[47:55] um because I I we just really appreciate
[47:58] you coming and I see uh sister Mariah's
[48:03] family amen God bless you all and
[48:06] brother Andrew's family God bless you
[48:09] all it's just really good to have you
[48:11] and we've just grown to to love you all
[48:16] and appreciate your friendship and and I
[48:19] tell you what we we've been so blessed
[48:22] to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah
[48:24] at our church so uh uh the Lord has just
[48:28] blessed us and they've been a real
[48:30] inspiration to us but I know uh you're
[48:35] not just here to see me uh even though I
[48:38] that you know I'd like to say that but
[48:40] uh uh but grandchild did a little um uh
[48:46] Malachi is going to get dedicated today
[48:49] and uh so I
[48:53] I was going to read this scripture uh
[48:57] here in Mark uh
[49:00] the 10th chapter and
[49:03] um
[49:04] I think it's the um
[49:07] 13th verse we'll start there I forgot my
[49:09] glasses but says then they brought
[49:12] young children to him
[49:15] that he should touch them and his
[49:19] disciples rebuked those that brought
[49:22] them
[49:22] but when Jesus saw it he was much
[49:25] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[49:28] little children to come unto me and
[49:30] forbid them not for of such is the
[49:34] Kingdom of Heaven A kingdom of God
[49:36] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[49:39] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[49:42] little child he shall not enter therein
[49:46] and he took them up in his arms and put
[49:49] his hands upon them and bless them a man
[49:53] and the prophet taught us that this is
[49:57] this is a commission that we are to do
[50:00] and uh you know there are some that
[50:04] they they baptize they feel like you
[50:08] know you know the child needs to be
[50:09] sprinkled or baptized or whatever but we
[50:13] know that that baptism is actually a
[50:16] part of repentance
[50:18] repentance comes first and then baptism
[50:20] but we see that a child allowed
[50:24] he he hasn't committed sin I was
[50:27] thinking today little Malachi he's he he
[50:30] hasn't done any sin and Christ paid for
[50:34] his sins of Adam what Adam did uh and he
[50:37] made that child innocent and so uh uh
[50:42] you know
[50:43] um so we're not here to to baptize him
[50:46] but we are here to to pray over him that
[50:50] God's blessings would rest upon him and
[50:53] and so if uh brother Andrew and sister
[50:57] Mariah would come we we know there's
[50:59] that song and we're going to sing it uh
[51:04] [Music]
[51:12] men from the fields
[51:17] bring them in
[51:19] and bring them in all bring the little
[51:25] ones to
[55:32] [Music]
[55:41] fields of sin bring them in
[55:46] over bring them in
[55:49] bring the little ones to Jesus
[55:55] this is from Brother Andrew and sister
[55:58] Mariah
[55:59] it says brother Sean and church family
[56:01] thank you
[56:02] for all you did for us during the birth
[56:05] of our son Malachi words cannot express
[56:07] how much we appreciated the offering all
[56:11] the meals you brought and most of all
[56:13] the prayers we're honored to to be a
[56:16] part of Faith Tabernacle may God richly
[56:18] bless you all brother Andrew Sister

[1:03:26] believe the fire of the Holy Ghost has
[1:03:28] burned across this building this week

[1:03:32] and every one of our Lives Lord maybe
[1:03:34] things laying there that we didn't even

[1:04:04] confidence in our spirits and our soul
[1:04:06] that your word will accomplish that at
[1:04:08] which you've sent it forth to do even
[1:04:10] right here this morning in this meeting
[1:04:12] and Lord as the Believers have laid
[1:04:14] their hands upon one another father
[1:04:16] there is a sign here this morning of
[1:04:18] unity Lord not not division Lord but
[1:04:21] Unity laid hands upon each other father

[1:05:04] Commission Now father may you bless them
[1:05:06] this morning bless us abundantly father

[1:05:41] name we pray and all the believer says
[1:05:44] a man amen The Book of Luke the 19th
[1:05:48] Chapter and the 41st verse the Bible
[1:05:51] said
[1:05:52] when he was come near he beheld the city
[1:05:55] and wept over it saying if thou hadest
[1:05:59] known even now at least in this day the
[1:06:02] things which belong unto thy peace but
[1:06:04] now they are HID from thine eyes
[1:06:07] for the day shall come upon thee that
[1:06:10] thy enemy shall cast a trench about thee
[1:06:12] incapacity round and keep thee on every
[1:06:15] side and shall lay thee even with the
[1:06:18] ground and thy children within thee and
[1:06:20] they shall not leave in thee one stone
[1:06:22] upon another I want you to catch this
[1:06:26] because thou knowest not the time of thy
[1:06:30] visitation because thou knowest not the
[1:06:33] time of thy visitation in the book of
[1:06:36] First Peter the second chapter I want to
[1:06:38] look at one verse there
[1:06:40] uh that verse brother Terry has always
[1:06:43] stood out to me that they didn't know
[1:06:46] their time of visitation I'm thankful
[1:06:49] that there's a bride here today that
[1:06:50] knows her time
[1:06:52] a visitation first Peter the second
[1:06:54] chapter
[1:06:55] and the 12th verse Peter here writing
[1:06:58] says having your conversation honest
[1:07:01] among the Gentiles
[1:07:03] that whereas they speak against you as
[1:07:06] evil doers
[1:07:07] they may by your good works which they
[1:07:10] Shall Behold glorify God in the day of
[1:07:14] visitation that they may glorify God in
[1:07:18] the day of visitation we ask the Lord
[1:07:20] this morning to add the blessing to the
[1:07:22] reading of his word is you can have your
[1:07:24] seats here this morning amen we thank
[1:07:26] the Lord for the reading of the word of
[1:07:28] God Amen I want to by the help of the
[1:07:31] Lord just to take a few moments here
[1:07:33] with you in the scripture and I want to
[1:07:35] speak to you on a thought if the Lord
[1:07:36] would help me I want to pull my text
[1:07:39] here out of a a prayer of the prophet of
[1:07:42] God and the message the uncertain sound
[1:07:44] how many is thankful that we've heard a
[1:07:46] certain sound in this generation brother
[1:07:49] remember says heavenly father I pray the
[1:07:51] father I pray the prayer for them with
[1:07:53] all my heart father I give them to you
[1:07:55] he says they are trophies of the message
[1:07:58] he says they are trophies of your
[1:08:01] visitation being here tonight seeing you
[1:08:03] walk among us doing works that has never
[1:08:06] been done since the foundation nation of
[1:08:08] the world until these last days he says
[1:08:11] here they are they are your children now
[1:08:13] I commend them to you Lord that you give
[1:08:15] them to us and we give them to you in
[1:08:18] the name of Jesus Christ watch over them
[1:08:20] and raise them up at the last day I may
[1:08:22] never be able to shake their hands on
[1:08:24] this Earth but when the battle is over
[1:08:26] how many thankful that the battle is
[1:08:28] almost over but when the battle is over
[1:08:31] and the last trumpet is sounded and the
[1:08:33] dead has risen from the grave and the
[1:08:36] lives have been called up together with
[1:08:38] them to meet the Lord in the air then
[1:08:40] may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ
[1:08:42] and them around the throne and through
[1:08:45] the Eternal ages to come granted Lord
[1:08:48] they are yours in the name of Jesus
[1:08:50] Christ my amen what a powerful
[1:08:53] Revelation to think that God would allow
[1:08:56] a prophet to pray a prayer of blessing
[1:08:58] over the Church of the Living God and I
[1:09:00] want to speak to this one and on that
[1:09:02] thought of trophies of his visitation
[1:09:05] trophies amen of his visitation I don't
[1:09:08] know maybe how that you see yourself
[1:09:10] this morning but I do not see you as
[1:09:12] just church members I do not see you as
[1:09:14] just friends or family or brothers and
[1:09:17] sisters but I actually see you the way a
[1:09:19] prophet saw you and he saw you as a
[1:09:22] trophy of the visitation amen of the
[1:09:25] message of the hour in this generation
[1:09:27] now when you start thinking about this
[1:09:28] you've got to realize amen that we're
[1:09:30] living in a day and time that where
[1:09:32] things are being done in this age that
[1:09:35] has not been done since the foundation
[1:09:37] of the world Listen amen you go all the
[1:09:40] way back to the days of Abraham and not
[1:09:42] since the days of Abraham had a man been
[1:09:45] born on the face of the Earth amen with
[1:09:47] a with a a natural bird amen and stand
[1:09:50] there and discern the thoughts and
[1:09:52] intents of the heart amen but in this
[1:09:54] generation amen another man born of a
[1:09:57] natural desire would stand up on the
[1:09:59] platform thousands of times and would
[1:10:02] discern amen not just the very thoughts
[1:10:04] or the intent but would begin to go into
[1:10:06] details in a doctor worthiest and he
[1:10:09] said this and he looked like this amen
[1:10:11] see what that was that was not the man
[1:10:13] William Branham amen that was not amen
[1:10:15] at church that was not a denomination
[1:10:17] amen but that was Elohim that was making
[1:10:20] a visitation Amen to this generation but
[1:10:23] he was not visiting us with another idea
[1:10:25] he was not visiting us with a better
[1:10:27] opinion amen but his visitation was his
[1:10:30] personal presence amen that was coming
[1:10:33] up on the earth to fulfill amen the
[1:10:35] promises of his word I love what job
[1:10:37] says in job 10 12 he said thou Hast
[1:10:40] granted me life and favor amen and thy
[1:10:43] visitation has preserved my spirit amen
[1:10:46] now has granted me life and favor and
[1:10:49] thy visitation hath preserved my spirit
[1:10:52] David says in Psalms 102 verse 13 He
[1:10:55] said Thou shalt rise and have mercy up
[1:10:58] on Zion now you know amen that Zion in
[1:11:01] the Bible is a type of the Bride amen so
[1:11:04] Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon the
[1:11:06] bride for the time to favor her amen yay
[1:11:10] the set time is come listen amen this is
[1:11:13] the age when God has sent a message to
[1:11:15] tell you that you're not coming into
[1:11:17] favor you're not going to be favored
[1:11:20] amen but before you ever broke the womb
[1:11:22] of an Earthly mother amen there was a
[1:11:25] chain seed of life on the inside of you
[1:11:27] listen amen the reason the devil can't
[1:11:29] curse you is because God blessed you

[1:16:42] favorite spirit and Hell tries to back
[1:16:44] me up this morning this is not a
[1:16:46] visitation of a man it's the visitation
[1:16:49] of Elohim in this generation

[1:17:15] for you it's already done it see it's
[1:17:18] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:20] now at first every minute time that I
[1:17:22] believe Amen to realize the seriousness
[1:17:25] of the visitation of God I believe right
[1:17:28] now is the time to do it I think your
[1:17:30] first ever been a time to forget
[1:17:32] everything a man taught concerning the
[1:17:35] scriptures and remember what a
[1:17:36] Vindicated Prophet saying now is the
[1:17:39] time to do it we are not going to take
[1:17:41] the Rapture by opinions we are not going
[1:17:43] to take the Rapture by feelings we are
[1:17:45] not going to take the Rapture by
[1:17:46] sensation but we will take the Rapture
[1:17:49] by the word and it won't be any kind of
[1:17:51] word it'll be Vindicated manifested
[1:17:54] thoroughly identified word amen the
[1:17:57] gospel that's being preached amen is
[1:17:59] like it was in the days of Noah it's
[1:18:01] fanaticism to the world but it's
[1:18:03] glorious and welcome to those who are
[1:18:06] willing to come in to the Ark of Safety
[1:18:08] which is Christ so the Ark of Safety to
[1:18:12] the church amen is Christ I pray you'll
[1:18:15] forgive me for this raspy voice but but
[1:18:17] you give me some Grace to preach this
[1:18:18] morning amen amen amen the Ark of Safety
[1:18:22] is the Gospel of Jesus Christ so I want
[1:18:25] to pull something from another prayer
[1:18:26] remember it says in token 63 he says if
[1:18:29] there's a seed anywhere that is
[1:18:31] predestinated Lord to hear the word of
[1:18:34] this last day may they come now sweetly
[1:18:37] and humbly and lay there and lay their
[1:18:39] trophies down at the cross or their self
[1:18:42] as a trophy that's what he's saying will
[1:18:45] they lay their trophies down at the
[1:18:48] cross or they'll lay their self down as
[1:18:50] a trophy he said of the grace of God wow
[1:18:53] that's called them and may they be
[1:18:55] filled with the Holy Spirit and display
[1:18:58] the token of the life of Jesus Christ in
[1:19:01] his resurrection as long as they remain
[1:19:04] here on the earth so we have just turned
[1:19:06] the corner amen from a trophy being a
[1:19:09] physical object Amen to the human being
[1:19:12] amen being the trophies of the greats of
[1:19:14] almighty god listen I don't know what
[1:19:16] you think about yourself amen but look
[1:19:18] you're a trophy of the grace of God I
[1:19:21] don't know what you think brother Mark
[1:19:22] amen but you are a trophy of the grace
[1:19:24] of God I know sometimes we get in our
[1:19:27] mind that we're not worth much and we're
[1:19:29] not very valuable and we can't do
[1:19:31] anything to benefit anybody amen but
[1:19:33] that is a lying Spirit from the piss of
[1:19:36] Hell amen if God placed a seed on the
[1:19:39] inside of your soul amen that did not
[1:19:41] come from your family it came from Jesus
[1:19:43] Christ amen and he called you according
[1:19:46] to his grace in the age that you're
[1:19:48] living in may they be a trophy to
[1:19:51] display the token of the life of Christ
[1:19:54] in his resurrection as long as they
[1:19:57] remain on the earth how many knows if
[1:19:59] you get a trophy it's got to be
[1:20:00] displayed
[1:20:02] when you get a trophy amen you know it's
[1:20:05] amazing people actually spend hundreds
[1:20:06] of thousands of dollars they meant to
[1:20:08] build trophy cases to display their
[1:20:11] trophies you know why because nobody
[1:20:13] gets a trophy and hides it in the closet
[1:20:15] somewhere nobody gets a trophy and
[1:20:18] buries it underneath a bushel nobody
[1:20:20] gets a trophy brother shamai and it's a
[1:20:22] shame for anybody to see it but they
[1:20:24] want the world to see it they want their
[1:20:26] friends to see it I'm on church and
[1:20:28] Jesus Christ did not die amen for you to
[1:20:31] be a trophy of his grace Amen to hide
[1:20:34] behind the fears and the condemnations
[1:20:37] and the and the mistakes of your life
[1:20:39] I'm going to church his victory is
[1:20:40] greater than your mistakes his victory
[1:20:43] is stronger than the spirit of
[1:20:45] condemnation I think it's time for the
[1:20:47] Church of the Living God to shake off
[1:20:49] the heaviness and remember we are bought
[1:20:51] with surprise we are not here trying to
[1:20:53] make ourselves holy the Holy Ghost in us
[1:20:56] has made us holy we are not here trying
[1:20:58] to make ourselves righteous but so aware
[1:21:01] that we have received as made us
[1:21:03] righteous in the age that we're living
[1:21:04] in we are a trophy of the visitation of
[1:21:08] Jesus Christ I think we all this morning
[1:21:10] just go ahead and break out and raise
[1:21:11] our hands and stomp our feet and clap
[1:21:14] our hands and say devil I am not here as
[1:21:16] a condemned church member I am not here
[1:21:19] hanging under the past of my life and
[1:21:21] the sins of my family but I have been
[1:21:24] set free by the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:21:27] got a seed inside of me I've recognized
[1:21:30] my day I recognize Sister Janet if
[1:21:32] anybody got a rise Amen to pick up a
[1:21:35] tambourine and Shout that devil down the
[1:21:38] trophies of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:40] that's got a right to praise God we
[1:21:43] shouldn't be here we should be in a
[1:21:45] grave this morning but God who is rich
[1:21:47] in Mercy said Elohim into this
[1:21:50] generation to call our families and to
[1:21:53] call our sons and to call our daughters
[1:21:56] I'm on you couldn't do it but he could
[1:21:58] you could raise yourself up out of all
[1:22:01] the guilt and condemnation and baggage
[1:22:03] of your past and baggage of your family
[1:22:06] and baggage of this situation but there
[1:22:08] was a God who could
[1:22:11] so you're a trophy then don't be ashamed
[1:22:14] of this play what God has done for you
[1:22:17] if he heals your cancer don't be ashamed
[1:22:20] to stand and say he healed me a Cancer
[1:22:22] and he opens your blinded eyes don't be
[1:22:25] ashamed to stand there and say open my
[1:22:27] blinded eyes if he come in the military
[1:22:29] and got a hold of you and give you a
[1:22:32] family and give your home don't be
[1:22:34] ashamed to stand there on a Sunday
[1:22:36] morning in the house of God and
[1:22:38] displayed to a lost and kind world that
[1:22:41] Jesus Christ the son of God is still in
[1:22:44] the saving business he's still in the
[1:22:46] healing business he's stealing the
[1:22:48] delivering business because he's God
[1:22:51] he's God are you hearing me what is a
[1:22:55] trophy a trophy is something gained or
[1:22:58] achieved or given in Victory listen or
[1:23:01] consequent especially when preserved a
[1:23:04] trophy is a victory that becomes
[1:23:07] preserved what did job say he said thy
[1:23:10] visitation has preserved my spirit
[1:23:13] amount I know what you're thinking right
[1:23:15] now you're thinking that Devil's going
[1:23:17] to take it away from me but can I ask
[1:23:19] you something how can the devil take
[1:23:21] something away from you that he didn't
[1:23:23] give you I know how can the devil take
[1:23:25] something away from you that he didn't
[1:23:27] give you he did not give you that
[1:23:29] victory in the house of God in that
[1:23:31] service so don't you let that lion devil
[1:23:33] take it from you he did not give you
[1:23:35] that family he did not give you that
[1:23:37] testimony so don't you back up and let
[1:23:40] that devil take it from you it's just
[1:23:42] something that's gained it's something
[1:23:44] achieved it's given in Victory or
[1:23:46] Conquest especially when preserved or
[1:23:50] mounted as a memorial a representation
[1:23:53] of such a memorial as on a medal I love
[1:23:56] this it is a game animal or it is a fish
[1:23:58] that is suitable for mounting as a
[1:24:01] trophy I love this part it is usually
[1:24:04] used attributively oh God I feel like
[1:24:08] preaching this morning it is usually
[1:24:10] used attributively then tell me what is
[1:24:13] the root word of attributively the root
[1:24:16] word of attributedly is attribute now
[1:24:19] the prophet said amen have I showed you
[1:24:21] this way there is something amen that a
[1:24:24] trophy is it is an expressed attribute
[1:24:27] of victory
[1:24:29] a trophy is an expressed attribute of
[1:24:33] Victory the public said Christ the
[1:24:35] mystery God's secret mystery he had
[1:24:37] before the world began now back in the
[1:24:40] back part of God's mind there was
[1:24:42] something he was trying and was going to
[1:24:45] achieve what does a trophy represent a
[1:24:48] trophy represents amen and achievement
[1:24:50] of a conquest and it's a victory so he
[1:24:54] was going to achieve something and he
[1:24:56] had a motive in doing it in order to let
[1:24:58] himself be expressed think about this
[1:25:01] Amen in him was all these attributes but
[1:25:04] brother Maurice there was nothing Amen
[1:25:06] to display or to manifest the effect of
[1:25:09] those attributes that was in him as long
[1:25:12] as there was just Angels he could say
[1:25:14] I'm a savior and the angels could say
[1:25:16] you're a savior he could say I'm a
[1:25:18] Healer brother Joe and the angels could
[1:25:20] say You're A Healer he could say no I'm
[1:25:22] a deliverer and the angels could say you
[1:25:25] are a deliverer but see they were
[1:25:26] expressing that amen not by experience
[1:25:29] not by battle amen not by not by a war
[1:25:33] but they were expressing that just
[1:25:35] because they were angels and he was God
[1:25:37] but in the end time there would be some
[1:25:40] sons and daughters that would be
[1:25:41] worshiping God and they would not just
[1:25:43] be saying yes you're a savior and yes
[1:25:46] you are a Healer and yes you are a
[1:25:47] deliverer but they would actually be
[1:25:49] saying I know you're a savior because
[1:25:51] you saved me I know you're a Healer
[1:25:54] because you healed me I know you're a
[1:25:56] deliverer because you delivered me so
[1:25:59] they would become trophies that would be
[1:26:01] expressing the victory of his attribute
[1:26:05] my there wasn't even a moon a star a
[1:26:08] molecule an atom or anything he was God
[1:26:11] so in his great mind he wanted to these
[1:26:14] attributes to be expressed and in him
[1:26:16] was love in him was to be a father in
[1:26:19] him was to be a son in him was to be a
[1:26:21] savior and him was to be a Healer all
[1:26:24] these great attributes we see already
[1:26:26] expressed they was in God among sister
[1:26:30] hope you know what you've done you
[1:26:31] pulled out of God what he already was
[1:26:34] come on now you did not put it in God it
[1:26:38] was already in him your face pulled it
[1:26:40] out of him I love what the prophet said
[1:26:42] he said and you are nothing but the
[1:26:44] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:26:47] was in God as the Son of God he said but
[1:26:50] now you are expressed after his word has
[1:26:53] come in you Amen to light up this age
[1:26:56] you are expressing God's life in you
[1:26:58] because you are a son and a daughter of
[1:27:01] God so therefore the word of God has lit
[1:27:04] our souls what does that word lit mean
[1:27:07] it means to set on fire I preach that to
[1:27:09] you in the temp meeting and then that
[1:27:11] word lit means to set something on fire
[1:27:13] it means to strike something and the
[1:27:15] result of the Striking is the burning of
[1:27:18] what has been struck o Church of the
[1:27:21] Living God I don't believe here this
[1:27:22] week we've been struck by just pictures
[1:27:24] I don't believe we've just been struck
[1:27:26] by sermons I don't believe we just been
[1:27:28] struck by songs amen but I believe the
[1:27:30] same Pillar of Fire that climbed its way
[1:27:33] in the upper room has to send it in this
[1:27:35] church brother Jr and we have been
[1:27:37] struck amen by the Dynamics of God we
[1:27:40] are not on fire with a Creed we are not
[1:27:42] on fire with a ritual we are not on fire
[1:27:45] with her religion we are burning Judah
[1:27:47] with the authority and the power of the
[1:27:49] message of the hour in the age that
[1:27:51] we're living in when the word of God lit
[1:27:54] our souls we come from time beings into
[1:27:57] Immortal beings and the god of Heaven is
[1:27:59] in us and he's crying at my father my
[1:28:02] God my God In my Father's house now
[1:28:05] anybody want to agree with me that where
[1:28:07] Jesus says there's a lot of noise
[1:28:09] where Jesus is two of you do where Jesus
[1:28:14] is there's a lot of noise right amen now
[1:28:17] watch this but remember said see the
[1:28:19] heavens will pass away with a great
[1:28:21] noise did you notice here Heavens will
[1:28:24] pass away listen the whole earth will be
[1:28:27] on fire and it will ignite the gases
[1:28:29] that's in the earth and we'll explode it
[1:28:31] the Bible said Peter said that the
[1:28:34] heavens will pass away and the Earth
[1:28:36] with a great noise such an explosion
[1:28:38] will rock it oh my because it's got to
[1:28:41] kill every disease every thistle every
[1:28:44] Thorn I'm gonna Church whatever was not
[1:28:47] in the Garden of Eden will not survive

[1:30:51] word trophy you will find that brother
[1:30:52] Brandon many times amen will begin to
[1:30:55] answer amen or he will begin to discuss
[1:30:58] trophies but he won't do it when he's
[1:30:59] preaching sister Jana he'll do it when
[1:31:02] he's actually praying he'll say like
[1:31:04] this they are trophies of this meeting
[1:31:06] they are trophies of this message they
[1:31:09] are trophies of the presence of the Lord
[1:31:10] they are trophies of the grace of God
[1:31:12] they are trophies of the spirit of Grace
[1:31:14] you are a trophy of this revival you are
[1:31:17] the trophy of the love of Christ at
[1:31:19] Calvary you are a trophy of the Gospel
[1:31:22] that has been preached you are a trophy
[1:31:24] of the word being made manifest that has
[1:31:27] been preached by the spirit of the Lord
[1:31:28] You Are trophies of the message the
[1:31:31] evening light so he is just brother he
[1:31:34] has just changed amen what you are into
[1:31:37] what he sees you but he's not seeing you
[1:31:39] that way through your former life he's
[1:31:42] seeing you that way through the baptism
[1:31:43] of the fire of God that has renovated
[1:31:46] you so that a holy God could dwell in
[1:31:49] your life when brother Branham refers to
[1:31:51] Trophies he's not talking about physical
[1:31:53] objects such as metal or gold he is
[1:31:56] speaking amen of people now can I show
[1:31:59] you a few scriptures that brother man
[1:32:00] I'm in the message will connect trophies
[1:32:03] to in John 5 24 he'll say I say unto you
[1:32:06] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:32:09] him that sent me half everlasting life
[1:32:11] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:32:13] it's passed from Death unto life right
[1:32:16] there is a scripture he connects a
[1:32:18] trophy to John 6 37 all the father has
[1:32:21] given me amen shall come to me and him
[1:32:24] that cometh to me will I know Wise cast
[1:32:26] out that is a scripture he has connected
[1:32:29] you as say trophy too in John 10 28 I
[1:32:32] give unto them eternal life and they
[1:32:34] shall never perish neither shall any man
[1:32:36] plucked him out of my hand amen My
[1:32:39] Father which give them to me is greater
[1:32:41] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:32:44] them out of my father's hand remember
[1:32:47] said the trophies of your word he said
[1:32:49] they are trophies of your word that
[1:32:51] condemned their sinful life and they've
[1:32:54] come up to accept you as their personal
[1:32:57] savior so it was not brother Doug
[1:32:59] William Branham condemning their sinful
[1:33:01] life it was the word that he was
[1:33:03] preaching was condemning their sinful
[1:33:06] life and at the same time brother
[1:33:07] Matthew that the word was condemning
[1:33:10] their sinful life it was transforming
[1:33:12] them into an attribute of God an
[1:33:15] expressed attribute to manifest the
[1:33:17] victory of God in the age that we're now
[1:33:19] living I love what he says I claim their
[1:33:21] life in the name of Jesus Christ I want
[1:33:24] to meet them on the other side when

[1:33:34] amen that God has given to his son
[1:33:36] Christ Jesus by the power of His
[1:33:39] presence and the word of God think about

[1:36:12] for message that was being preached was
[1:36:14] doing more than just causing her to
[1:36:16] shout but it was claiming her body for
[1:36:18] the Fulfillment of Revelation 18 4 come
[1:36:21] out of her my people what are you saying

[1:36:30] claiming grip of almighty God for your
[1:36:32] body to be a fulfillment of the revealed
[1:36:35] word as the word becomes revealed that
[1:36:37] word Mariah is claiming your body for
[1:36:39] its fulfillment I'm on church he said
[1:36:41] somebody was going to overcome devils
[1:36:44] and the revealed word has claimed your
[1:36:46] body for its fulfillment he said
[1:36:48] somebody was going to speak in new
[1:36:50] tongues they were going to see Visions
[1:36:52] they were going to shout they were going
[1:36:54] to experience the blessings of the
[1:36:56] presence of Jesus Christ Alone he's not
[1:36:58] going to raise up rocks to do it but
[1:37:00] he's going to take a message and he's
[1:37:02] going to claim 16 elements and out of
[1:37:05] those elements he's going to manifest
[1:37:07] the promises
[1:37:09] of this refilled word you might as well
[1:37:12] Rejoice you've done been claimed
[1:37:16] you can run but you can't hide come on I
[1:37:19] don't devil a bitterness wants to claim
[1:37:20] your life for its fulfillment but there
[1:37:23] is a God here who then claims you to
[1:37:25] manifest forgiveness through
[1:37:30] you are claimed on accident you were
[1:37:33] claimed by purpose on purpose for a
[1:37:37] purpose you didn't know you was going to
[1:37:39] preach me this morning will you just
[1:37:40] claim to own a purpose by a purpose for
[1:37:43] a purpose
[1:37:45] oh what are you saying I'm saying the
[1:37:48] message has claimed you to be a trophy
[1:37:51] the message has claimed your flesh to be
[1:37:55] a trophy of its power
[1:37:57] oh God what was in the back part of
[1:37:59] God's mind is now before me and his
[1:38:02] bride
[1:38:03] are not just church members I know these
[1:38:06] things are simple but help me you are
[1:38:07] not just church members you got to
[1:38:09] realize the revealed word is claiming
[1:38:11] you when I heard him say that brother
[1:38:13] brother Sean it done something to me it
[1:38:15] was not William Branham claiming us come
[1:38:18] on church amen do you want to talk about
[1:38:19] playing tapes let's talk about playing
[1:38:21] tapes you ought to be playing tapes
[1:38:23] well last Sunday morning we might as
[1:38:25] well preach at me brother Tim you'll
[1:38:27] ought to be playing tapes I don't think
[1:38:29] tapes ought to be a foreign thing
[1:38:30] because the prophet said as they hear
[1:38:32] those tapes the word that's being
[1:38:34] revealed is claiming them for his
[1:38:36] fulfillment but here's where I got an
[1:38:37] issue with that is you lay aside a
[1:38:39] faithful Ministry and begin to promote
[1:38:41] just playing tapes what you're telling
[1:38:43] me is God don't have enough power Amen
[1:38:45] to keep a man's life clean just stand In
[1:38:48] a Pulpit and preach the word of God but
[1:38:49] I happen to believe the reason that man
[1:38:51] is preaching is because the Revelation
[1:38:53] that he was hearing on those tapes amen
[1:38:55] was claiming his body for the
[1:38:57] Fulfillment of the peace inspired Amen
[1:38:59] to stand there and to rightly divide the
[1:39:01] word of truth that it would be an
[1:39:03] idiotic Haitian and by that revealing
[1:39:05] identification to the church would bring
[1:39:07] a people to a state of perfection what
[1:39:09] do you saying I'm saying it here and
[1:39:11] abroad preach the word preachers preach
[1:39:13] it with everything that's within you if
[1:39:15] you've got to stand by yourself and
[1:39:17] stand on a rock say what a prophet said
[1:39:20] and watch the Dynamics of the revealing
[1:39:22] of the son of man come in the church and
[1:39:25] manifest his power manifest its
[1:39:27] anointing Manifest this life we are not
[1:39:30] dead trophies we are living trophies
[1:39:33] come on Church you're a trophy you're a
[1:39:36] walking billboard of God's success in
[1:39:40] humanity
[1:39:43] now that's a mouthful in it think about
[1:39:46] that sister Faith you are walking
[1:39:48] billboard of God's success in humanity
[1:39:54] my baby said he's only doing these
[1:39:56] things to claim his own now he said if
[1:39:59] it manifests itself you're on the
[1:40:00] platform before you will you believe it
[1:40:04] he said will you repent of your sins and
[1:40:05] disbelief the hour of visitation is
[1:40:08] drawn near listen don't push back I'm
[1:40:11] not trying to preach against you I'm
[1:40:13] just preaching
[1:40:14] there's a there's some flesh that's
[1:40:16] going to be claimed for the words
[1:40:18] fulfillment listen God did not say
[1:40:20] Ephesians 5 was good to the seventh age
[1:40:23] there was no time limit put on it
[1:40:27] yeah we might as well preach at we
[1:40:31] the prophet of God said he's only doing
[1:40:33] these things to confirm his word then I
[1:40:36] say this every man of God that stands In
[1:40:39] a Pulpit and preaches this message is
[1:40:41] confirming the word of God
[1:40:44] can you say Amen because Jesus said the
[1:40:48] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:40:51] works I love what the prophet says now
[1:40:53] in Jesus in his ministry John 14 12 he
[1:40:56] said watch I say unto you we spoke of it
[1:40:58] last night he that believeth on me the
[1:41:00] works that I do so he do also and More
[1:41:02] Than This he says watch the word really
[1:41:05] translated right is more not greater
[1:41:07] because he raised the dead he stopped
[1:41:10] nature there was nothing could be any
[1:41:12] greater than what he did but more than
[1:41:15] this shall you do for I go to my father
[1:41:18] do you believe that is the inspired word
[1:41:21] of God
[1:41:23] he said do you believe that do you
[1:41:25] believe that many of the ages to follow
[1:41:27] on like that it was now the same thing
[1:41:29] he did Brother Thomas he promised the
[1:41:32] church to do only more of it than what
[1:41:35] he did so he did not change brother what
[1:41:39] the church would be doing he only said
[1:41:41] what they will be doing will be more
[1:41:43] than what I did he was not changing the
[1:41:47] quality of what he did he was changing
[1:41:49] the quantity of what he did that's why
[1:41:51] the Bible says in John 21 25 and there
[1:41:54] are also many other things which Jesus
[1:41:56] did the which if they should be written
[1:41:58] everyone I suppose that even the world
[1:42:01] itself amen could not contain the books
[1:42:04] that should be written I think it's a
[1:42:06] powerful thing when the prophet comes
[1:42:08] along in token and says wish I could
[1:42:10] testify a little bit now to some things
[1:42:12] I've seen happen just in the last few
[1:42:14] weeks see oh what I could testify of it
[1:42:17] was John that said if all that Jesus
[1:42:19] done would be putting books there wasn't
[1:42:20] enough books in the world to write for
[1:42:22] him just what I'm seen in my own
[1:42:25] Ministry seen him do you couldn't pile
[1:42:27] it in the volumes on this platform here
[1:42:29] if I wrote in detail what I seen him do
[1:42:32] just in my own Ministry seen him do see
[1:42:35] he had more success in my Ministry than
[1:42:39] he did in his home he had more success
[1:42:42] in my Ministry than he did in his own
[1:42:44] now remember he had more success now not
[1:42:47] me he had remember said his fact he said
[1:42:50] he had more success in Jeffersonville
[1:42:52] than he did in Nazareth he did why in
[1:42:55] The Wicked City amen he said because he
[1:42:57] prayed for poor Miracles but he did
[1:42:59] there listen he finally broke through
[1:43:01] here among church that's where the
[1:43:04] that's where the Prophet was showing you
[1:43:06] that the Miracles that would be piled
[1:43:08] into a book amen were coming from they
[1:43:10] were coming from the visitation of the
[1:43:12] Holy Ghost in the church The Same Spirit
[1:43:15] that raised Jesus from the dead was
[1:43:17] visiting this generation and a prophet
[1:43:19] stood there and said if you can
[1:43:20] recognize it it'll break through if you
[1:43:22] can recognize it he will break through
[1:43:25] listen he was on the platform he was on
[1:43:28] a prophet a prophet was sinning a
[1:43:30] prophet was testified a prophet was
[1:43:32] screaming about it but he just wasn't
[1:43:34] willing to leave it on a prophet but
[1:43:36] Timmy was one to put it on the Bride of
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ and here this morning I can
[1:43:41] without one reservation say brother Sean
[1:43:43] what was on a prophet is now on the
[1:43:45] church what was in the son of man is now
[1:43:48] in The Bride of Jesus Christ he finally
[1:43:50] broke through he had more success right
[1:43:53] here than he did in Nazareth I didn't do
[1:43:55] it I just didn't I just loved him and
[1:43:58] submitted myself to him and said what he
[1:44:01] said and the Holy Spirit went to the
[1:44:03] other people and they believed what he
[1:44:05] said and then he done the work oh god of
[1:44:09] Heaven breakthrough in the Church of the
[1:44:11] Living God once again oh god of Heaven
[1:44:14] breakthrough in Faith Tabernacle once
[1:44:17] again oh god of Heaven breakthrough in
[1:44:20] our Ministries once again you say what
[1:44:22] does that break through him to come back
[1:44:23] is it going to come back a new cookbook
[1:44:25] is it going to come back some fancy
[1:44:27] preacher it's going to come by somebody
[1:44:28] who can stand and appropriate and say
[1:44:31] what a prophet said and submit
[1:44:33] themselves to The Sovereign Divine love
[1:44:36] of almighty God and he will come in the
[1:44:38] church and he will perform the miracle
[1:44:40] he will change the situation
[1:44:42] among Church it wasn't a man it was the
[1:44:46] visitation
[1:44:48] of the son of man how many knows the
[1:44:50] prophet of God goes beyond the curtain
[1:44:52] of time right he goes beyond the current
[1:44:54] time 1960 comes back rejected King and
[1:44:56] tells it I heard a voice that spoke to
[1:44:59] me in the room and said this is what you
[1:45:01] preached what was the Holy Ghost this is
[1:45:04] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:45:08] without it there was no jealousy huh
[1:45:11] I can't get tied down there there was no
[1:45:15] jealousy there was no tiredness now can
[1:45:18] I just say this he said there was no
[1:45:20] jealousy there was no tiredness you
[1:45:22] realize when you realize it's not a man
[1:45:24] then you don't have to be jealous
[1:45:28] when you realize it's not a man's doing
[1:45:31] it's the doing to the son of man to be
[1:45:34] jealous is to be jealous of God he said
[1:45:36] there was no jealousy there there was no
[1:45:38] tiredness there there was no death there
[1:45:40] sickness could never enter there
[1:45:42] mortality could never make you old and
[1:45:44] they could not cry it was just one Joy
[1:45:47] oh my precious brother they took me up
[1:45:49] and set me up on a great big high place
[1:45:50] and I thought I'm not dreaming I'm
[1:45:52] looking back at my body laying right
[1:45:54] down there on the bed and they sent me
[1:45:56] up here and said oh and I said I
[1:45:57] shouldn't sit up here listen but you
[1:46:00] know why he was sitting up there because
[1:46:01] he didn't put himself there Jesus Christ
[1:46:04] the son of God put him in that position
[1:46:06] now listen you may think I've gone a
[1:46:07] little overboard but I'm going to preach
[1:46:09] here for a minute and if I got to take a
[1:46:10] sword by myself I will we will never
[1:46:12] make brother Branham more than what
[1:46:14] Jesus Christ made him I know we've had
[1:46:16] men of God Amen that I don't say men of
[1:46:19] God we've had preachers maybe they
[1:46:20] weren't men of God and it put him in a
[1:46:22] position God never put him in and that's
[1:46:24] why they fail and they don't go no
[1:46:26] further but you're looking at one boy
[1:46:27] that was born race on the back Hills of
[1:46:30] East Tennessee that as long as I got a
[1:46:32] Pulpit to stand in I'm not going to
[1:46:34] fight for what brother so and so
[1:46:35] believes I'm not going to fight where
[1:46:36] brother so and so thanks but I am going
[1:46:38] to say what a prophet who has lifted up
[1:46:40] out of this generation saying and he's
[1:46:43] saying amen stay with a word and submit
[1:46:46] yourself to the Holy Ghost and love and

[2:02:52] Congregation of people that's been
[2:02:54] laying in the presence of the Sun and
[2:02:56] they've been ripening underneath her
[2:02:57] teachings of the seventh angel and what
[2:02:59] a prophet saw
[2:03:01] we're seeing
[2:03:06] I see it
[2:03:10] he said brother Brandon will go in on
[2:03:11] what you told
[2:03:14] I did too I told everything they taught
[2:03:16] and then people screamed and said
[2:03:19] we know that
[2:03:22] and we know
[2:03:24] we're going back with you someday to the
[2:03:26] Earth
[2:03:27] I said Jesus will come and you'll be
[2:03:30] judged according to the word that you
[2:03:31] preached us

[2:03:42] details in these quotes
[2:03:44] he said and if you are accepted at that
[2:03:46] time notice what they said which you
[2:03:48] will be

[2:03:57] the next
[2:03:59] said we know you'll be accepted
[2:04:01] and here's what they said
[2:04:03] then you
[2:04:05] will present us
[2:04:07] to him

[2:04:58] beautiful wife sitting back there
[2:04:59] holding a beautiful baby
[2:05:01] they said I'm not ignorant enough to
[2:05:03] realize the reason I've got that is
[2:05:04] cause of this message

[2:06:58] to benefit listen friends you don't
[2:07:00] realize we're on the threshold of
[2:07:02] Revelation 11 being fulfilled and two
[2:07:04] witnesses taken
[2:07:06] this gospel back to the to the hundred
[2:07:08] forty four thousand if there's ever been
[2:07:09] a time to scream what a prophet said
[2:07:11] Now's the Time to do it you know why
[2:07:14] because you couldn't scream this 50
[2:07:15] years ago there wasn't ears to hear it
[2:07:18] there wasn't eyes to see it there wasn't
[2:07:20] a heart to believe it but now there's a
[2:07:22] bride with all of our faults and all of
[2:07:24] our failures or the mark and all of our
[2:07:25] mistakes but there's a bride and she's
[2:07:27] got ears to hear and she's got eyes to
[2:07:30] see and she's got a heart to believe and
[2:07:32] she's got a body to manifest than it
[2:07:34] first ever been a time to scream out
[2:07:36] what a prophet said now's the set time
[2:07:38] to do it because there's actually a
[2:07:40] people on the Earth in position to
[2:07:41] manifest it
[2:07:45] I say you may preach 15 sermons on one
[2:07:47] subject and feel like you're getting
[2:07:48] nowhere but keep on preaching it
[2:07:52] because one day that body under the
[2:07:57] you will guide us to him and all
[2:08:01] together we'll go back on the earth to
[2:08:04] live
[2:08:05] forever
[2:08:06] said I looked at him and said do I have
[2:08:09] to return back
[2:08:10] do I have to return back they said yes
[2:08:12] you do
[2:08:14] but keep pressing on
[2:08:16] Church

[2:08:20] January meetings
[2:08:24] tomorrow night or Tuesday nighter
[2:08:28] we got to go back
[2:08:29] I've had a little change here for a week
[2:08:32] I go back to a regular routine
[2:08:34] with what you've heard keep pressing
[2:08:36] home
[2:08:38] remember I said when he come back he
[2:08:39] said I'm more determined Now by that
[2:08:41] visitation than I've ever been before
[2:08:44] friends I don't know how else to say it
[2:08:45] but after this week listen we've been
[2:08:47] we've been having these meetings what
[2:08:48] four years now been powerful services
[2:08:50] but there's been a shift in the
[2:08:52] atmosphere this week There's been an
[2:08:54] element change
[2:08:56] I'm more determined now
[2:08:58] to preach this message
[2:08:59] to go in a rapture
[2:09:01] to walk like Enoch
[2:09:03] than I've ever been
[2:09:06] before
[2:09:08] than I've ever been
[2:09:09] because I got another witness here
[2:09:13] I'm more determined than I've ever been
[2:09:16] I'm gonna ride on what he talked with
[2:09:17] Amos
[2:09:19] I'm way over time y'all forgive me
[2:09:21] I told Junior and telling the guys last
[2:09:23] night I said I'm gonna pull an old
[2:09:25] school one out in the morning preach 45
[2:09:26] minutes and close out
[2:09:28] I do tell the truth
[2:09:31] you ever heard Batman when he goes
[2:09:33] beyond the curtain of time and he said
[2:09:34] when I got there he
[2:09:38] was about 18 years old she come running
[2:09:40] to me I think it's broke down there at
[2:09:41] your church of the day when I was
[2:09:42] preaching brother Jordan on that
[2:09:43] immortality
[2:09:45] he said I saw her she wasn't young child
[2:09:47] she was an 18 year old
[2:09:52] she looked at me and said on Earth I was
[2:09:54] your little Sharon Rose
[2:09:58] step back
[2:10:00] he said well you're a you're a grown
[2:10:02] young lady
[2:10:04] he said yes she said yes daddy
[2:10:06] now I want to connect something here can
[2:10:08] I have just a minute to do it bro bam
[2:10:10] shouldn't be on the current time he said
[2:10:11] he said they were going on what I taught
[2:10:13] on my teaching right
[2:10:14] he said Sharon Rose looked at me and she
[2:10:17] said brother Branham
[2:10:20] he said rather she looked at him I'm
[2:10:22] paraphrasing she all forgive me but she
[2:10:24] said I'm not a child no more I'm an 18
[2:10:26] year old young lady he said the last
[2:10:29] time I saw her she was in a hospital
[2:10:31] room he said Don in a feeble condition
[2:10:34] as a child and now she's over here
[2:10:36] remember said she looked at him and said
[2:10:38] Daddy don't you remember what you taught
[2:10:40] on immortality
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:45] I really feel like cutting up right now
[2:10:47] Branson
[2:10:48] don't you remember what you taught on
[2:10:50] immortality I got to pond on that
[2:10:52] brother Sean brother when she left the
[2:10:55] Earth she hadn't sat in the future home
[2:10:58] he didn't set in things that aren't to
[2:11:00] be she she didn't get in the backseat
[2:11:02] with Billy Paul and Rebecca and ride
[2:11:03] down the road and brother random read
[2:11:05] the church you hear the church age book
[2:11:06] read and say read that over she didn't
[2:11:08] shed through all those meetings
[2:11:10] but she looked at him and she said Daddy
[2:11:12] what you told an immortality they
[2:11:15] believe it over here I thought oh God
[2:11:17] I'm living in the only place that they
[2:11:20] don't believe what a prophet taunts this
[2:11:22] is the only place they don't believe in
[2:11:24] a future home in a Rapture and things in
[2:11:26] theophany but there is a land beyond the
[2:11:28] river there is a bridge between
[2:11:30] denomination and the glory land and over
[2:11:33] there if a prophet called it they shout
[2:11:35] about it because they are the
[2:11:37] manifestation of what a prophet told in
[2:11:40] the revelation of the word in this age
[2:11:41] do you love him today

[2:35:48] meetings in amen and we've uh enjoyed
[2:35:52] just being around everyone you visitors
[2:35:56] and thank you once again for coming
[2:35:58] and some of you have stated that these
[2:36:03] have been the best meetings
[2:36:05] January and and I think they have
[2:36:09] we've uh you know uh you usually when
[2:36:12] it's kind of hard to get things going
[2:36:14] for one and uh when you start a meeting
[2:36:19] and then you have an influx of people in
[2:36:21] and out that maybe haven't been all the
[2:36:24] way through the meetings and and so when
[2:36:26] they come you know it's almost like they
[2:36:28] need to get revived and and it just kind
[2:36:31] of drags but you know every service has
[2:36:33] been Dynamic and the Lord has just moved
[2:36:38] in such a special way and have spoke
[2:36:41] personally I believe to every heart and
[2:36:45] uh and you you that have come to to
[2:36:48] visit to be a part of it you you've come
[2:36:51] with the same eagerness that we as a
[2:36:54] church have here and that is to hear the
[2:36:56] word of God and to be part of something
[2:36:58] that God is doing amen and so thank you
[2:37:02] once again for coming
[2:37:03] it's now
[2:37:06] we've
[2:37:08] as I've said earlier we're going to be
[2:37:10] dismissing to the local folks we're
[2:37:12] going to be dismissing a Wednesday night
[2:37:14] service and resume service next Sunday
[2:37:19] 11 o'clock and we do have a meal that
[2:37:25] we're going to have
[2:37:27] and and we had announced that that it
[2:37:29] would be uh at a hotel but actually it's
[2:37:32] just going to be right across the street
[2:37:34] and so if you'd like to stay eat
[2:37:37] Fellowship we'd certainly love to have
[2:37:40] you and so again it's just right across
[2:37:44] the street
[2:37:45] there will be the second turn to the
[2:37:49] left I believe that's how it is just go
[2:37:51] right across the street and don't turn
[2:37:54] the second or the first turn left go to
[2:37:57] the second and it'll take you up to a
[2:37:59] Red Barn up that way and a lot of food
[2:38:02] there so uh just follow the your nose
[2:38:06] the smell is good amen so we want to
[2:38:10] keep brother Andrew in our prayer at the
[2:38:12] Lord will just be with him renew him in
[2:38:14] his body and his mind and the Lord will
[2:38:19] just continue to bless him as he travels

[2:38:24] that has to travel today on the road and
[2:38:28] that God will just keep you safe amen
[2:38:31] and so let's just bow our heads in a
[2:38:34] word of prayer
