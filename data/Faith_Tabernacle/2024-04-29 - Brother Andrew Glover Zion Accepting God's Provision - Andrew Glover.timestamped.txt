[1:02:36] God's grace he says the Lord is my
[1:02:40] shepherd I shall not want amen the Lord
[1:02:45] is my shepherd he's making it personal I
[1:02:47] shall not want that word want means to
[1:02:51] diminish for the lack of need so David
[1:02:54] is saying I will not diminish
[1:02:56] because there's not a supply of what I
[1:02:58] have need of now in the Book of Psalms
[1:03:00] chapter
[1:03:01] 132 I have a couple other places I like
[1:03:04] to read this morning with you in Psalms
[1:03:06] chapter
[1:03:08] 132 and beginning there in the 13th
[1:03:12] verse David again writing says for the
[1:03:15] Lord hath chosen Zion I love that
[1:03:18] because it's past tense the Lord hath
[1:03:21] chosen Zion and he hath desired it for
[1:03:24] his habitation
[1:03:26] this is my rest forever here will I
[1:03:29] dwell for I have desired it I will
[1:03:32] abundantly bless her provision I will
[1:03:36] satisfy her poror with bread I will also
[1:03:39] clothe her priest with salvation I love
[1:03:42] this and her Saints shall shout aloud
[1:03:45] for Joy her Saints shall shout aloud for
[1:03:49] Joy there will I make the Horn of David
[1:03:52] to Bud I have ordained a lamp for m
[1:03:55] anointed I love this right here and his
[1:03:58] enemies will I clothe with shame but
[1:04:01] upon himself shall his crown flourish
[1:04:05] amen I believe this morning that God of
[1:04:07] David is our God here this morning one
[1:04:10] place in the New Testament in
[1:04:11] Philippians chapter 4 Philippians the
[1:04:14] 4th chapter and then the 19th verse
[1:04:18] Philippians 4 you love the Lord this
[1:04:20] morning amen Philippians chap 4: 19 I
[1:04:24] believe every one of us could read this
[1:04:25] from heart this morning the Bible says
[1:04:28] this but my god let's just read this
[1:04:31] together Philippians 4:19 but my God
[1:04:34] shall supply all your need according to
[1:04:37] his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus it
[1:04:41] that a beautiful promise God shall
[1:04:44] supply all of our needs we ask Lord this
[1:04:46] morning to add the blessing to the
[1:04:48] reading of his word as you can be seated
[1:04:50] here this morning I want you by the help
[1:04:52] of the Lord for just a few moments to
[1:04:54] speak to you today and if I I titled
[1:04:56] this today I want to speak to you on
[1:04:57] Zion accepting God's provision amen Zion
[1:05:02] accepting God's provision before we go
[1:05:05] any further I want to clarify that I am
[1:05:07] speaking to Zion this morning prophet of
[1:05:09] God said in the future home he said any
[1:05:11] time Zion is referred to he's ref
[1:05:14] referring to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:16] now uh brother bradam preaches a sermon
[1:05:18] I was listening to it the other day
[1:05:20] accepting God's provided way at the end
[1:05:22] time and he's opening there and he says
[1:05:24] now for a text I would like to speak
[1:05:26] from on this is accepting God's provided
[1:05:29] way for the end time he said let me
[1:05:32] quote that again because on the tapes I
[1:05:34] believe they're taping these messages
[1:05:36] and on the tapes that we have some 500
[1:05:38] texts that I guess I've preached from he
[1:05:40] said they've got something similar to
[1:05:42] that but not exactly this so he's saying
[1:05:45] there's a lot of tapes out there and
[1:05:47] there's some that's similar to what I'm
[1:05:49] speaking on he says but not exactly this
[1:05:52] see accepting God's provided way at the
[1:05:55] end time he said you know there's many
[1:05:57] ways that people take but there's really
[1:06:00] only two ways that a man can go so
[1:06:02] there's many ways we can take but
[1:06:04] there's only two ways a man can go
[1:06:06] that's the right way and that's the
[1:06:08] wrong way and all of us here tonight he
[1:06:10] said we're on one of those roads the
[1:06:12] right or the wrong one see there's no
[1:06:13] middle ground Jesus said you cannot
[1:06:16] serve God and Mammon meaning the world
[1:06:18] Amen we're either right or we're wrong
[1:06:21] see if we'll just get away from our own
[1:06:23] way is the only way that we can get into
[1:06:25] God's way so amen I'll say this our way
[1:06:28] is wrong but God's way is right and the
[1:06:31] only way that we can get into God's way
[1:06:33] is we've got to get out of our way and
[1:06:35] God has made a provided way for
[1:06:37] everything amen God has made a provided
[1:06:40] way for everything amen he has provided
[1:06:44] the way so God Amen has not only made
[1:06:47] the way but he has provided the way he
[1:06:49] said where we get in trouble is not
[1:06:51] following that way and injecting into it
[1:06:53] our own ways and that makes a perversion
[1:06:56] and anything that is perverted is not
[1:06:58] Dependable amen so God has a way amen
[1:07:02] can I say this morning that the ways of
[1:07:04] God are not imperfect amen but the ways
[1:07:07] of God are perfect amen Proverbs 14:12
[1:07:11] the Bible says there is a way amen which
[1:07:13] seeth right unto a man amen but the end
[1:07:16] thereof are the ways of death so if
[1:07:19] you're in a way amen the way is leading
[1:07:22] to a destination and there is a
[1:07:24] destination of death but there's also a
[1:07:26] destination of life and I say this
[1:07:28] morning there is a vast difference Amen
[1:07:31] in something that seems right and
[1:07:33] knowing that something is Right amen
[1:07:35] there's a big difference in thinking
[1:07:37] something is Right amen but then knowing
[1:07:39] that what you're walking in is right and
[1:07:41] I'll say this denominations are walking
[1:07:43] in the way amen which seeth right unto a
[1:07:46] man think about that they're walking in
[1:07:48] a way thatth right unto a man they are
[1:07:51] walking without an absolute amen so what
[1:07:53] they have to do is they have to choose
[1:07:56] amen which way that seems right unto
[1:07:58] their leader I want to say this morning
[1:08:00] we are not walking in our choice we are
[1:08:03] not walking in a man's choice we are not
[1:08:06] walking in a Bishop's choice we're not
[1:08:08] walking in a Pope's choice we're not
[1:08:10] walking in a district prp's Choice amen
[1:08:12] but we are walking in God's choice this
[1:08:14] morning amen therefore we're not
[1:08:17] baptized in a way that seems right amen
[1:08:19] we're not believing according to a way
[1:08:21] that seems right amen we're not shouting
[1:08:23] according to a way that seems right amen
[1:08:26] but this morning by the grace of God
[1:08:28] Amen we are testifying that we're
[1:08:30] walking in the way amen and it is a
[1:08:32] god-given way it is God's provided way
[1:08:35] brother said all the denominational ages
[1:08:37] of 900 and something different
[1:08:39] Protestant denomination He said Each one
[1:08:41] then of course you see their idea he
[1:08:43] said I can't blame them but each one
[1:08:45] claims that they are the truth amen 900
[1:08:49] different denominations and every one of
[1:08:51] them amen are claiming that they are the
[1:08:53] truth and they have the truth amen and
[1:08:55] the people that belongs to those
[1:08:57] churches amen should believe that
[1:08:59] because they have stake their
[1:09:01] destination now watch this their Eternal
[1:09:03] destination amen upon the teaching of
[1:09:06] that church amen and there's so much
[1:09:08] different one from the other amen till
[1:09:10] it makes some 900 different questions
[1:09:13] amen therefore being 900 some questions
[1:09:16] there's got to be one correct answer
[1:09:18] amen and I would like for us tonight
[1:09:20] being that we're trying to go to heaven
[1:09:22] amen and to meet our lord Jesus who we
[1:09:24] all love he said I would like to search
[1:09:27] in the scripture Amen to find that
[1:09:29] answer amen can I just stop and say this
[1:09:32] we're not just having meetings amen
[1:09:34] we're not just going to church we're not
[1:09:36] just building churches and amen getting
[1:09:38] together amen but we're going to heaven
[1:09:41] amen we're going in the Rapture we're
[1:09:43] going Amen to everything that God has
[1:09:45] promised us amen and I'll say this we're
[1:09:47] going to meet the Lord Jesus who we love
[1:09:50] amen but better than that he loves us
[1:09:53] amen we don't just love him amen but he
[1:09:55] loves us and I'll say this morning
[1:09:57] tribulation is not my destination amen
[1:10:00] another church age is not my destination
[1:10:03] amen another planet is not my
[1:10:05] destination amen but my eternal
[1:10:07] destination amen is heaven amen where
[1:10:10] there is no devil where there is no sin
[1:10:13] where there is no tormentors where there
[1:10:15] is no sickness Hey listen friends I
[1:10:17] think it's high time Amen to remember we
[1:10:20] have not come into this age to stay in
[1:10:22] this age but we have come in this age to
[1:10:24] leave this age amen and one of these
[1:10:26] mornings I know amen I'm just going to
[1:10:28] go ahhe and preach amen I know people
[1:10:30] don't like it but I'm going to say it
[1:10:31] some morning between 6:00 and 9 amen
[1:10:34] there's going to be a Rapture and
[1:10:36] there's going to be somebody that's
[1:10:37] going to go in that Rapture amen and the
[1:10:40] devil can't stop it amen Russia can't
[1:10:42] stop it amen the Devils of hell can't
[1:10:45] stop it we have been anointed amen not
[1:10:48] by the way that seems right but the way
[1:10:50] we know is right amen and we're walking
[1:10:53] in the light as he is in the light amen
[1:10:55] and our Eternal destination is heaven
[1:10:58] don't be afraid no matter how many
[1:11:00] atomic bombs they have how many hydrogen
[1:11:02] bombs how much they speak of this and
[1:11:04] this is going to happen amen don't you
[1:11:06] be scared amen because God is at the
[1:11:09] will amen can I say this God Amen is
[1:11:13] driving you to your destination amen
[1:11:16] amen some people you get in the car with
[1:11:17] you're scared to ride with them amen
[1:11:19] because of their driving amen but this
[1:11:21] is one driver that I'm not afraid to
[1:11:24] ride with amen he knows just how to
[1:11:26] steer he knows just how it's coming out
[1:11:29] amen so we don't have one thing to fear
[1:11:31] but just be a lovely little Carefree
[1:11:34] child who is looking up to the father
[1:11:36] every minute and depending on him to
[1:11:38] lead us amen and to guide us amen and to
[1:11:42] take us into our destination amen by his
[1:11:45] grace and I say this there is a direct
[1:11:47] connection amen between your destination
[1:11:51] and the grace of God you will not get to
[1:11:53] your destination by works you you will
[1:11:55] not get to your destination by money you
[1:11:57] will not get to your destination by how
[1:11:59] much you can memorize amen but a way
[1:12:02] that you will get to your destination is
[1:12:04] by the grace of almighty god listen they
[1:12:07] can sing about Grace being amazing but
[1:12:09] I'm looking this morning at what makes
[1:12:11] the grace of God amazing amen that he
[1:12:14] can save a sinner he can deliver a drunk
[1:12:17] he can redeem a lost son he can bring us
[1:12:20] back into our rightful position if
[1:12:22] anybody got a righteous shout about the
[1:12:24] grace of God is the Bride of Jesus
[1:12:26] Christ amen we're not going to get there
[1:12:28] on how we feel but we're going to get
[1:12:30] there on his grace we're not going to
[1:12:32] get there on how good we can preach or
[1:12:34] how good we can sing or how loud we can
[1:12:36] shout amen we're going to get there to
[1:12:38] our somebody shout Grace I'm not talking
[1:12:41] about works I'm talking about Grace I'm
[1:12:43] talking about the grace of God that
[1:12:45] moved a man out of his office into the
[1:12:47] street and the first person he met he
[1:12:50] said do you know Grace well I want to
[1:12:52] say this morning I know Grace and I
[1:12:55] believe I'm looking at a group of people
[1:12:56] this morning amen that knows Grace you
[1:12:59] know the power of the grace of God and
[1:13:01] you're going to your destination by
[1:13:04] Grace amen can I can I lay that in there
[1:13:06] is a fundamental point of this message
[1:13:08] amen you're going to your destination by
[1:13:12] Grace you're going to your destination
[1:13:15] by Grace listen if there's a Bible
[1:13:18] question we should have a Bible answer
[1:13:20] well I'll say this morning we don't have
[1:13:22] an answer we have the answer
[1:13:25] we don't have a answer have the answer
[1:13:28] Amen to the devil's question he Christ
[1:13:31] is risen and is paid the price and is
[1:13:34] raising up the body and the devil can't
[1:13:37] stand it there's a reason these
[1:13:38] ecumenical kingdoms are setting up and
[1:13:40] they're all coming into what they're
[1:13:41] doing now amen there's a reason the
[1:13:44] devil's howling the way is is his
[1:13:46] wickedness his scheme has been uncovered
[1:13:48] in there there would be a Time come
[1:13:50] forth when he could express himself in
[1:13:53] the fullness of his godhead deity amen
[1:13:56] through his church having the
[1:13:58] preeminence in the church oh my what
[1:14:00] amen the anointed man amen but now the
[1:14:04] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[1:14:07] anointed bride and the bridegroom amen
[1:14:09] anointed by what amen by accepting what
[1:14:13] Eve turned down amen and Adam coming
[1:14:16] back with the anointing the word because
[1:14:18] he said my word is spirit see amen
[1:14:21] Anointed with the word oh God what Eve
[1:14:24] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:14:28] come on John amen you're not here trying
[1:14:31] to make your own provision you're not
[1:14:33] here trying to find a provision you're
[1:14:35] not here trying to pray up a provision
[1:14:37] amen but Eve turn your provision down in
[1:14:40] the beginning but there would be a
[1:14:42] second Adam and there would be a second
[1:14:44] Eve and the same word would come across
[1:14:47] the path of this second Eve and when she
[1:14:49] seen this word it would be the headstone
[1:14:52] and she would be crying Grace Grace and
[1:14:55] listen friends amen I can't make Grace a
[1:14:57] disgrace it's the only way I'm going to
[1:14:59] get out of this evil age amen is the
[1:15:02] grace of God has come over our lives and
[1:15:05] we have accepted what Eve turned down
[1:15:08] what Eve turned down he comes right back
[1:15:11] again and we accept
[1:15:13] it somebody say we accept it we accept
[1:15:17] what God has provided in Philippians
[1:15:20] chapter 4 I love the Amplified Bible in
[1:15:23] this verse it says my God Amen will
[1:15:26] supply my God will liberally Supply I
[1:15:29] love this he will fill until
[1:15:32] full he will F unto full your every need
[1:15:37] according to his riches Amen in the
[1:15:40] glory in Christ Jesus so he's not going
[1:15:43] to fill you with enough to get by he's
[1:15:45] not going to fill you with enough just
[1:15:46] to get to the next service or to come on
[1:15:49] church amen I'll say this morning amen
[1:15:51] if we never have another church service
[1:15:53] I believe what you got in you right now
[1:15:56] amen is enough to take you in the
[1:15:57] Rapture amen if the Rapture comes in the
[1:16:00] morning I believe the word that is come
[1:16:03] back in your path amen Eve turned it
[1:16:05] down but you didn't turn it down you
[1:16:07] accepted it and when you accepted it it
[1:16:10] did more than just stimulate your flesh
[1:16:13] it did more than just move your spirit
[1:16:15] amen but it filled your soul with every
[1:16:18] promise of God listen I think it's high
[1:16:20] time to tell that devil I'm not leaving
[1:16:22] these tent meetings the way I came I
[1:16:24] might to come in here full of Pride and
[1:16:26] full of anxiety and full of nervousness
[1:16:29] and full of depression amen but there's
[1:16:31] a God in heaven who has come by my way
[1:16:34] in the power of his resurrection and he
[1:16:37] has liberated me and he has filled me
[1:16:39] with joy unspeakable he has given me
[1:16:41] peace Beyond human understanding he has
[1:16:44] given me an abundance of Revelation I'll
[1:16:46] say these meetings amen we have seen the
[1:16:48] Lord Jesus how many can testify in these
[1:16:51] meetings I have seen the Lord Jesus who
[1:16:54] raised from the dead amen come into our
[1:16:56] midst amen and Grant the desires of our
[1:16:59] hearts according to his riches amen that
[1:17:01] he died to purchase this for us amen I
[1:17:04] want to say this Christ Jesus amen is
[1:17:07] the god of our needs amen he's the god
[1:17:09] of our needs amen which means he knows
[1:17:13] what we need and he knows what we don't
[1:17:15] need he knows what we need but he also
[1:17:19] knows what we don't need and according
[1:17:21] to Matthew 5 amen God promised Amen to
[1:17:24] supp the need he said and if God has
[1:17:27] given us that blessed promise then the
[1:17:29] only thing that would keep us from being
[1:17:30] filled with everything we thirst for
[1:17:33] would be because we do not believe it
[1:17:36] amen we could just believe now that God
[1:17:38] will give us the very thing we're here
[1:17:40] for amen we'll all go home tonight happy
[1:17:44] and satisfied he said I'm so glad he
[1:17:46] supplies our every need he promised he
[1:17:48] would do that now he never promised he
[1:17:51] would Supply our wants he never promised
[1:17:54] he would would Supply our wants but it
[1:17:56] was our needs he would Supply he said
[1:17:59] I'm so glad of that because there's many
[1:18:01] times that we want things amen that's
[1:18:04] not good for us so God did not promise
[1:18:07] to supply our wants but he promised to
[1:18:10] supply our needs you say well Psalms
[1:18:12] 23:1 David said the Lord is my shepherd
[1:18:14] amen I shall not want amen well look at
[1:18:17] the Greek word and the want there is a
[1:18:19] need so David said the Lord is my
[1:18:22] shepherd and I shall not need but I love
[1:18:24] but he also said he said now listen amen
[1:18:27] he's not just my shepherd who has it but
[1:18:29] he's going to make sure that I do not
[1:18:32] decrease I do not diminish I do not
[1:18:34] reduce from where I should be amen he
[1:18:37] has to oh come on Amen some of y'all
[1:18:40] right now the devil saying now you had a
[1:18:41] good camp meeting and you had a good
[1:18:43] feeling and you went through the prayer
[1:18:44] line amen but you just wait till Monday
[1:18:46] morning you just wait till Tuesday
[1:18:48] morning you just wait till you get back
[1:18:50] home you know when I tell that devil I
[1:18:52] say devil you just wait till we get back
[1:18:54] home home amen because we didn't come in
[1:18:56] contact with the personality we didn't
[1:18:59] come in contact with a feeling but we
[1:19:00] have come in contact with the shepherd
[1:19:03] of all Shepherds and his name is Jesus
[1:19:05] Christ and he's the king of kings hey he
[1:19:08] owns the cattle on the Thousand Hills he
[1:19:10] put the water in the river he put the
[1:19:12] mountains in the come on and if God can
[1:19:15] do that he can take care of every one of
[1:19:17] our
[1:19:18] needs right brother tells us he was
[1:19:21] shaving one morning there with a
[1:19:22] straight razor and his little boy Joseph
[1:19:24] come back he said now brother he said he
[1:19:26] said now brother little Joseph wanted
[1:19:28] that razor he said but he was 5 years
[1:19:30] old and he cried because I wouldn't let
[1:19:32] him have the razor but you see I knew
[1:19:34] better than to do that and I say this it
[1:19:37] wasn't that Joseph didn't need the razor
[1:19:40] it just wasn't the time he had need of
[1:19:42] it come on now amen there was a time
[1:19:45] coming that he would need the razor but
[1:19:47] a 5-year-old boy would know how to
[1:19:49] handle that razor so a prophet had to
[1:19:52] wait until an appointed time when he
[1:19:54] would come to an age that he could
[1:19:56] handle a razor listen amen years ago God
[1:19:59] couldn't release the things to the
[1:20:01] church that he's releasing now amen but
[1:20:03] now there's a people on the face of the
[1:20:05] Earth who has come to maturity and they
[1:20:08] know how to handle the word they know
[1:20:09] how to handle the Revelation hey I think
[1:20:12] it's high time Amen to get out of
[1:20:14] childhood immaturity and come into the
[1:20:16] fullness of the word of God it's your
[1:20:19] season to do it he said that's the way
[1:20:21] God is sometimes we think we must have
[1:20:23] certain things and we would only hurt
[1:20:26] ourself with it so if we'll just be
[1:20:28] submissive and humble like little
[1:20:30] children before him amen God Will Supply
[1:20:33] what we have need of can I say this God
[1:20:35] has always somebody say always God has
[1:20:38] always been the God Amen to meet the
[1:20:41] need when there was a trouble God has
[1:20:43] always been there amen you know that and
[1:20:46] God promised he would Supply the need in
[1:20:49] the face of every difficult amen God
[1:20:51] Will Make A Way of Escape amen he will
[1:20:54] do it if you'll just have faith and
[1:20:56] believe him another place he said God
[1:20:58] has promised Amen to meet the need of
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:02] hour he always he always does that and
[1:21:05] we need the voice of God today to meet
[1:21:08] the need of the hour to meet the time
[1:21:11] we're living in amen listen to this word
[1:21:13] provision I love the definition of it
[1:21:15] amen it is the action amen of providing
[1:21:18] or supplying something for use so God is
[1:21:20] not giving this to us amen just to look
[1:21:23] at it amen just to talk about it but
[1:21:25] he's actually given it to us to pick it
[1:21:27] up and use it is an amount or thing
[1:21:30] supplied or provided it means to supply
[1:21:33] with food amen drink or equipment amen
[1:21:36] especially for a journey amen can I say
[1:21:38] this we are on a journey and a journey
[1:21:41] has a way and the way has a destination
[1:21:44] in Psalms 32 David said the Lord amen
[1:21:47] have chosen Zion and he said I will
[1:21:49] abundantly bless her provision I will
[1:21:51] satisfy her poor with bread I love this
[1:21:54] word provision because it means food
[1:21:56] supply the prophet of God said if we're
[1:21:58] going to have an understanding of God it
[1:22:00] must come out of God's word for the word
[1:22:03] is what God gave us to feed our hungry
[1:22:05] souls and the Holy Spirit was sent to
[1:22:07] take the word of God and to feed us by
[1:22:10] the word you see amen the holy spirit is
[1:22:13] sent from God to take the word of God
[1:22:16] and to give it to us as we have need he
[1:22:18] said now I'm so glad amen that God made
[1:22:21] a provision like that that he would feed
[1:22:24] us you know what David goes on to say he
[1:22:26] said he will satisfy amen her poor with
[1:22:29] bread that word satisfy means to be
[1:22:32] fulfilled it means to have one's F love
[1:22:34] it means to have an excess so in other
[1:22:37] words this bride is not going to be
[1:22:39] living in poverty she's not going to be
[1:22:42] living on just barely getting by amen
[1:22:44] but she's going to be living in the
[1:22:45] Overflow she's going to be living in
[1:22:48] excess she's going to be living in an
[1:22:50] abundance amen I love this here the
[1:22:52] prophet of God said I pray that you will
[1:22:54] bless today amen that you would break to
[1:22:56] us the bread of life amen now what is
[1:22:58] the bread of life he said is the
[1:23:00] revelation of Christ hey is the
[1:23:03] revelation of Christ so we are promised
[1:23:06] an abundance of Revelation in our

[1:23:36] a little something I want from God Amen
[1:23:38] can I say this you don't have to leave
[1:23:40] amen with that desire but the same God
[1:23:43] that was here on Wednesday that was here

[1:28:38] prophet of Jesus Christ he said if it's
[1:28:41] so broke up in so many different
[1:28:42] denominations and fractions amen so
[1:28:44] we're trying to do our best amen by the
[1:28:47] gospel Amen to heal that broken body
[1:28:50] that all the people might come together
[1:28:53] with one great Unity amen can I say this
[1:28:56] the days of division are
[1:28:58] over I'm going to just put on my boots
[1:29:00] and preach here for a minute the days of
[1:29:02] division are over and you know what
[1:29:04] causes division amen it's Personalities
[1:29:07] in different directions amen that are
[1:29:09] different from the message come on
[1:29:11] church because what happens is you got
[1:29:13] unity and then somebody decides no amen
[1:29:16] this seems right amen so let's follow
[1:29:18] this way and you got a whole group of
[1:29:20] people standing for what they know is
[1:29:21] right and you got a group of people
[1:29:23] following what's seems right and then
[1:29:25] somebody stands up and points to what is
[1:29:27] right and now the whole body has been
[1:29:29] divided but you know what Paul said he
[1:29:32] said we ought to Endeavor Amen to keep
[1:29:34] the unity of the spirit amen in the bond
[1:29:37] of Peace come on you say well brother
[1:29:39] Andrew amen it ought to be easy it's not
[1:29:41] going to be easy you're going to have to
[1:29:44] Endeavor well we might as well preach
[1:29:46] right here you're going to have to
[1:29:47] Endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:29:50] in the bond of Peace in other words that
[1:29:52] word endeavor means to labor I love this
[1:29:55] brother Nathan the word endeavor means
[1:29:57] to labor to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:29:59] you know what else it means it means to
[1:30:01] study to exert oneself amen so if you
[1:30:04] want to keep unity in the message amen
[1:30:06] quit studying what somebody else thinks
[1:30:08] about it and study what a prophet said
[1:30:11] and just say what he said and it'll
[1:30:13] bring a unity in there and it'll Bond it
[1:30:15] together in the Peace of Jesus Christ
[1:30:18] are y'all hearing me this morning listen
[1:30:20] sometimes we're going to have to become
[1:30:22] more than just just picnickers in church
[1:30:24] and start being some Warriors because
[1:30:26] our feelings are going to get hurt
[1:30:28] somebody's going to take our parking
[1:30:30] spot somebody's not going to shake our
[1:30:31] hand somebody's going to miss us in a
[1:30:33] part oh it's Sunday morning I shouldn't
[1:30:36] be cleaning house but here we are amen
[1:30:38] somebody's going to go out with somebody
[1:30:40] and didn't invite somebody amen the
[1:30:42] devil's always going to be working Amen
[1:30:44] to bring division into the body of Jesus
[1:30:47] this morning I say we are the Warriors
[1:30:49] of almighty God and we are sick and
[1:30:51] tired of the devil taking our Unity and
[1:30:54] taking our Brotherhood and taking our
[1:30:56] fellowship you know what I do this
[1:30:58] morning brother Malachi I declare war on
[1:31:01] every Spirit of division on every Spirit
[1:31:03] of Discord on every spirit that seems
[1:31:06] right I declare war on it and I say this
[1:31:08] morning we will not bow our
[1:31:11] knee we will not follow some way that
[1:31:13] seems right we will endeavor we will
[1:31:16] exert oursel Amen to keep the unity of
[1:31:19] the spirit in the bond of Peace you know
[1:31:21] why because Paul said there is one b
[1:31:23] body I love that there is one body and
[1:31:26] there is one spirit and you are called
[1:31:29] in one hope of your calling brother very
[1:31:31] beautiful he says and it takes
[1:31:33] conventions like this where men of
[1:31:35] different denominations amen can set
[1:31:38] together as brothers that's what does
[1:31:40] the healing to the sickest body I know
[1:31:43] of another place the body of Jesus
[1:31:45] Christ it needs a healing and it can
[1:31:47] only be healed by brotherly love that's
[1:31:50] the sickest body I know of all broke up
[1:31:52] into pieces amen you're members of that
[1:31:54] body so God heal you both physically and
[1:31:58] spiritually and make you what you should
[1:32:00] be another place you said there's only
[1:32:02] one bomb that I know that will heal and
[1:32:04] that's the word and that's the sick body
[1:32:06] we want to stand up in the strength and
[1:32:08] the vitam and power of the Gospel that's
[1:32:10] why I use so much of my time in trying
[1:32:12] to strengthen the church amen by the
[1:32:16] word so a prophet knew the only thing
[1:32:19] that would strengthen the church over
[1:32:20] the devil of division has manifested his
[1:32:23] action
[1:32:24] his word brother Mark will not reject it
[1:32:27] she will accept it and the prophet says
[1:32:29] it very plain he said God's attitude
[1:32:31] towards the people amen from Eden Back
[1:32:34] to Eden is wrapped in those seven read
[1:32:38] Eden is wrapped in those seven names I
[1:32:41] love how brother B says this he said see
[1:32:43] when Abraham took Isaac on the mountain
[1:32:45] he said I know thou fearest God see
[1:32:47] brother said God wasn't looking for
[1:32:49] Abraham's son I'm going somewhere he was
[1:32:51] looking for Abraham's obedience
[1:32:53] obedience is what God wants see
[1:32:56] obedience produces more than we realize
[1:32:58] now here Abraham nowhere a ram come into
[1:33:01] existence but said see if God made a
[1:33:04] promise amen God can
[1:33:17] provide he was then can I say this is my
[1:33:20] point I want to bring out of this amen
[1:33:22] Abraham was up there on the mountain
[1:33:25] there amen was the sacrifice when
[1:33:27] Abraham men fell off the bridge he did
[1:33:30] not go over there and say now I'm not
[1:33:32] sure the pillar of fire amen come into
[1:33:34] your cabin because he did not go over
[1:33:36] there and say are you what what
[1:33:38] denomination are you at amen when the
[1:33:40] supply of what he had need of come into
[1:33:42] existence there was only one thing he
[1:33:44] could do and that was accepted there was
[1:33:47] only one thing he could do and that was
[1:33:49] believe it there was only one thing he
[1:33:51] could do and that was receive it listen
[1:33:54] friend and my God said he would Supply
[1:33:56] me a Rapture listen I don't need a new
[1:33:58] home I don't need a new truck I don't
[1:34:00] need a new car what I need is a body
[1:34:03] change hey and God has provided a word
[1:34:06] to change our bodies in the moment in
[1:34:09] the twinkling of an eye you know what I
[1:34:11] say I say get your eyes off of your
[1:34:13] troubles get your eyes off of your
[1:34:15] issues and get you are closer to your
[1:34:17] destination than you are to the
[1:34:19] situations of your life there is a
[1:34:21] provision Zion that has come up upon
[1:34:25] you brother said many have fell by the
[1:34:27] wayside and they don't know the way of
[1:34:29] God no more they've been darken and
[1:34:31] blacking their hopes has failed but may
[1:34:33] they view again Calvary where you caught
[1:34:35] the fire in your bosom and broke the way
[1:34:38] and down through the dark
[1:34:47] shadow you preaching like you are
[1:34:49] because I can see home why are you
[1:34:51] believing like you are because I see
[1:34:53] home am me can I say something we've

[1:57:08] Holy Ghost come across that Soul the
[1:57:11] quickening power made your flesh come
[1:57:14] subject to the word and the only thing
[1:57:16] your soul could agree with was it's
[1:57:19] me it's the truth
[1:57:25] I know this crosses theology but I'm
[1:57:26] going to say it brother said then just
[1:57:28] by accepting it won't only do God's got
[1:57:30] to vindicate back that he has accepted
[1:57:33] you that's the thing you can accept
[1:57:39] him but then if he accepts
[1:57:43] you stay right there until he does
[1:57:46] accept you and then when he does he
[1:57:50] seals you into his King om by the
[1:57:53] baptism of the Holy Spirit then you're
[1:57:56] secure until the day of your
[1:58:00] Redemption are y'all ready for this
[1:58:03] there's no ups and downs there's no ins
[1:58:05] and outs you really get into
[1:58:09] God if you're really in him not just
[1:58:13] impersonating something but you're
[1:58:15] really in
[1:58:17] Christ you're one
[1:58:20] alternative you're one motive you're one
[1:58:23] objective your whole heart sold out
[1:58:26] every bridge is burnt behind you and you
[1:58:28] got your affection set on things above
[1:58:31] and you run the race with
[1:58:34] patience that's set before you can I
[1:58:37] just go ahead and say it when Christ
[1:58:39] accepted
[1:58:41] you there is therefore now no
[1:58:47] condemnation see you don't accept it it
[1:58:51] accepts you
[1:58:54] can I leave you this quote this
[1:58:57] morning then how see it through the
[1:59:00] blood washing of the blood taking away
[1:59:04] separating of sin that the Holy Spirit
[1:59:07] Woos the believer through the blood
[1:59:09] cleansing of the Soul into the
[1:59:12] fellowship into this Spirit life inside
[1:59:15] with Christ shut out the
[1:59:20] world come God help me this
[1:59:23] morning and the Very nature of God is in
[1:59:28] you you're still subject to mistakes but
[1:59:32] God can't see
[1:59:38] it but God can't see it because it's
[1:59:42] covered by the blood so when God looks
[1:59:46] at you the only thing he can see is the
[1:59:50] blood when God looks at you he sees what
[1:59:54] through the
[1:59:57] blood so if God was pleased with Christ
[2:00:00] to us dead our own thoughts and ideas
[2:00:03] being born of the spirit of God walking
[2:00:05] not after theology but after the spirit
[2:00:07] inside of us then left the dead in
[2:00:11] Christ walk not after the things of the
[2:00:15] world but after the things of the spirit
[2:00:17] see you're inside of
[2:00:20] Christ walking
[2:00:24] you're
[2:00:25] inside of Christ
[2:00:29] walking can I say this and I'm
[2:00:32] done
[2:00:34] condemnation is
[2:00:43] finished
[2:00:45] guilt is
[2:00:48] finished the past is finished
[2:00:53] hallelujah it's finished this morning
[2:00:55] can I close by saying what David said
[2:00:57] David said that God would provide for
[2:01:00] Zion that God would fight her battles
[2:01:03] can I say what he said in closing he
[2:01:05] said this he said and her
[2:01:09] enemies her enemies will wear her shame
[2:01:14] are y'all hearing me you're not wearing
[2:01:17] shame this
[2:01:19] morning there has been a blood provided
[2:01:23] and the prophet of God said the blood
[2:01:25] took the sin off of you and put it back
[2:01:28] on the head of the devil can I say this
[2:01:32] morning if anybody got a right to shout
[2:01:35] if anybody got a right to dance if
[2:01:37] anybody got a right to scream if anybody
[2:01:40] got a right to run the aisles if anybody
[2:01:42] got a right to have a good time in the
[2:01:44] house of God is the dollar of Zion
[2:01:47] because her enemy is wearing her shame
[2:01:52] her enemy is wearing her shame brother
[2:01:54] Caleb you ain't wearing it the devil's
[2:01:56] wearing it and you know what I say it
[2:01:58] looks a lot better on him than it does
[2:02:01] on you it looks a lot better on him than
[2:02:04] it does on you but you know what you're
[2:02:06] wearing you're wearing the message

[2:02:17] living somebody shout I am accepted in
[2:02:22] the Beloved I didn't accept him he
[2:02:26] accepted me and because he accepted
[2:02:30] me I have accepted him

[2:02:44] aloud the shame is on your
[2:02:47] enemy The Devil is
[2:02:50] defeated s man is paid for it's not held

[2:03:55] him because there's a power and div
[2:03:59] Vision behind it a word of God that's
[2:04:02] been revealed to get the church in order
[2:04:05] for the
[2:04:07] Rapture and the going

[3:16:15] brother Andrew hasn't sought his own
[3:16:17] Ministry uh he hasn't sought to be big
[3:16:21] but one thing he has done he's studied
[3:16:23] the message he has set under great
[3:16:27] ministry
[3:16:28] elders and he has taken correction he
[3:16:31] has been willing to take correction when
[3:16:33] needed he's been willing to pattern his
[3:16:36] life and and to set under oak trees you
[3:16:40] have heard many uh uh several of these
[3:16:43] Elders preach to during this week and
[3:16:47] and brother Andrew has humbled himself
[3:16:49] under that Ministry Amen to to study and

[3:16:57] God has blessed him for that you've seen

[3:17:02] this message he doesn't do it for Glory
[3:17:05] in your ministry no no matter what you
[3:17:07] may not be a world evangelist like
[3:17:08] brother Andrew but God will bless you
[3:17:11] just the same way if you humble yourself
[3:17:13] don't look at the me the the ministry as
[3:17:16] a career
[3:17:17] don't look at it as something that you
[3:17:20] know this is something that I could be
[3:17:21] gloried if I could just go travel and
