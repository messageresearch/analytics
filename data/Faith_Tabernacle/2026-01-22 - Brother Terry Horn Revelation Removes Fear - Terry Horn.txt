It's an old song that um I don't know I've had many tears and sorrow. I've had questions for tomorrow. There's been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave me blessed consolation that my trials would only make me strong. Oh, through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon my Lord. Now, I've been to a lot of places. I've seen lots of faces. But there were times I felt so all alone. But in my lonely hours, Jesus lonely hours, Jesus lets me know that I am his own. Oh, through it all. Through it all. Oh, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Oh, I thank him for the mountains. I thank him for the valleys. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I'd never had a trial, I wouldn't know God could solve them. I wouldn't know what faith in God can do. I want to say that through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Oh, through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Can you sing it with me? Oh, now I thank him for the mountains. I thank him for the valleys. I thank him for every storm he's brought me through. For if I'd never had a problem, I wouldn't know that God could solve them. I wouldn't know what faith in God can do. Oh, but through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, oh through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Oh, I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Amen. Jesus, we're depending on you. Yes, Jesus, we're depending on you. Oh, Jesus, we're depending on you, Lord. depending on you to see us through. When they came to the waters, they didn't know what to do. There was no one to help them. They couldn't see their way through. Oh, but Lord, you move the waters and they walked right on through. Oh Jesus, we're depending on you. Oh yes, Jesus, we're depending on you. Oh Jesus, we're depending on you. Yes, Jesus, we're depending on you, Lord. We're depending on you, oh, to see us through. Now, when our faith tried by fire, we still know that it's true. Oh, the Satan is a liar, there isn't much that he can do. And though he's tried to stop us, we know you'll bring us through. Oh Jesus, we're depending on you. Can you stand and sing it now? Oh yes, Jesus. Oh, we're depending on you. Yes, Jesus. We're depending on you. Oh Jesus, we're depending on you, Lord. depending on you. Oh, to see us through. Yes, Jesus, we're depending on you. You depending on him, oh Jesus, we're depending on you. Oh Jesus, we're depending on you, Lord. We're depending on you, oh, to see us through. Can you give the Lord another hand clap of praise tonight? Are you glad that he's our way maker tonight? Amen. Amen. As we invite Brother Terry to come, can we sing that song? This is the evening time. Oh, this is the evening time. It's later than we think. Oh, the bride is preparing now for her Lord to meet. Oh, all things are ready now. The bridegroom I hear. Oh, ye the hath an ear to hear the evening time is here. Oh yes, this is the later than we think it is. I didn't prepare. All things he do. I grew my hair. He that hath an ear to hear. The evening time is near. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank the Lord. We're at the evening time and not only at the evening time, we are at the end of the evening time. All things are just about run out. It's good to be here. Thank you musicians. Let's we'll just get right into the word and it's good to see all of you out on this cold cold Wednesday night. Might as well enjoy the service tonight cuz we probably won't have one Sunday. Not being negative, but you know the weather forecasters, they said it's going to dump it. So that's yet to be seen. But we're glad that we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glad that we are under the umbrella of a word message. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I guess I probably got brother Sean's uh blood pressure up just a little bit because I didn't get here to about 10 tail and I said you probably was down there praying &gt;&gt; cuz I hadn't. &gt;&gt; But we're here and &gt;&gt; I've got a a real blessful message for you tonight. &gt;&gt; I think it'd be wonderful. Let's turn to the book of Romans 8 and 15. Just going to read two scriptures. Romans 8:15 and 1 John 4. And we're going to look a lot into 1 John chapter 4. Several verses there. And we'll read verse 15 of Romans chapter 8. The scriptures are not new, but some of the things that I want to bring to you are not new, but hopefully that we can time together in a way that would be uh beneficial for the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:15 says, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, that's like dread and terror. But you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father. You say well a spirit of adoption what is what is adoption? Adoption really is being anointed with this god's spirit the token spirit to actually to come to maturity. That's adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then if we read in 1 John 4:18, it says, "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath what? &gt;&gt; Torment." &gt;&gt; Torment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He that fearth is not made perfect in love. &gt;&gt; And we're going to look a lot in St. John or 1 John 4. But let's just bow our heads and pray. Lord, we've read these two scriptures. And we already know uh perhaps what direction that we're going to go to when we talk about fear. Uh not given the spirit of of uh of of uh bondage, but Lord, we get that spirit of adoption. We're thankful, Lord, for the open book of this hour. So thankful that you sent us a messenger. Thank you, Lord, that Revelations 10:1 has been fulfilled. Revelation 10:7, uh, Malachi for all these wonderful scriptures that you've given that are pertinent to our day. We're so thankful for each one, Lord. Now, take this vessel, Lord, that hide me behind the cross. Lord, I've studied. I've prepared. I've prayed. Lord, I'm not a inspirational preacher. I'm a teacher. But Lord, let these words sink deep into our heart that we might better understand. As the prophet said in the first seal, I'm going to call you bride so that you may understand. and we want to understand and understanding actually is one form of revelation. So we ask that you would help us tonight God you get the glory. We ask for your help hide me behind the cross as I said Lord let me get out of the way and may you have preeminence in the service. We ask in Jesus name and everybody says amen you can be seated. I want to talk a little bit tonight if I were to give it a title on revelation removes fear or revelation takes away fear. Now give you just a a couple of little thoughts as we go on. Well, we cry abba father as we read in Romans 8:15. Uh receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father. Abba father. It's like daddy daddy father. You say why? Well, we actually have a new standing when we're born again. We have a new standing with God. He's our father. We have a father just like a natural father. But you just multiply that many, many more times. What the a true father that really has a really yearning and desire and an overseer for his children. We have a father and we are now sons of God. We're not slaves. We have to get away from that slave mentality. We're we're not servants. We're not slaves. The Jews are servants, but we are sons. &gt;&gt; And our estate has changed from condemned sinners to actual privileged sons of God. &gt;&gt; We're trying to, as brother said, we got to recognize who we are. Not that we are worthy of that, but we've got to, he's given it to us. We must accept it. And now, we have a legal right and a special privileges of divine sunship. Just a few little things as we run through here. And we are we are are invited into this relationship solely on Christ's merit. None of our own. Nothing we had to do with it solely because he chose his bride before the foundation of the world. Might as well, you know, just I mean I'm a firm believer is what what the Bible says. Ephesians chapter 1 2 3 4. We are predestinated. We're chosen in Christ. I had nothing to do with it. When God chose Paul, I mean, he's a chosen vessel for this and for this, for this. I mean, he had nothing to do. God chose him. That's just the way it is. God's sovereign. He does what he wants to. One vessel of honor, another. It makes a dishonor. Now, we we we we now meet God as father and not as judge. We're so thankful for that. In 1 John 4:16, it says this, "And we know and believe the love of God." And we know and believe the love that God hath to us. Now, this is only possible if you're born again, truly born again. And we know and believe the love that God had toward us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. Now, this verse here, we're actually talking about salvation. And I want you to notice as we go through some of these verses here, as brother M said, in that day, you'll know that I am the father, the father in me, I and you, you and me. How many times even in St. John or 1 John 4 that we get this same thought as we head right we just read it in verse 16 it God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him &gt;&gt; I in you you and me &gt;&gt; there again salvation amen how many time now notice as we go through verse 17 herein okay herein is our love made perfect God's love is already perfect is our made love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world. We'll get to that just in a minute. Boldness in this scripture actually means confidence. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be like bold, you know, like the world is bold or brassy. But this boldness is actually confidence. &gt;&gt; Here is our love be perfect that we may have confidence in the day of judgment. Now we'll get to that in a minute. The day of judgment. What is our judgment? There's no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment. That's either restraint or punishment. Restraint actually means only being able to mature so far. But that's not perfect love. &gt;&gt; Perfect love casteth out fear because fear have torment. And he that fearth is not made perfect in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we must understand fear has torment. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Fear has torment. God does not desire his children to fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now last Sunday, brother Shawn preached on protection. And there's natural and and spiritual protections. And there's all kinds of protections that he talked about and we're thankful for all of God's protections. So tonight I want to talk about another type of protection if you will and that's revelation. That's a real protection if you want to look at it that way. Now, we know that sons of God are led by the spirit of God. But Satan is a mimic. He's an imitator and he is a deceiver. There's so many spirits out there, so many voices in the world. We understand that. So many voices and they're all trying to lead you. They're all trying to lead you. So, who are we going to be led by? All kinds of voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all remember he's a he's a deceiver. He's a mimicker. He's a impersonator. But there is a true revelation. There is a true spirit of God and there is a true leadership of God. &gt;&gt; We want to try to better understand as as as 1 John 4:18 says, "Perfect love cast out fear." We want to try to better understand and actually blend that that uh there's no as as I said there, perfect love casteth out fear. Yeah. and revelation removes all fear fear. I want to try to blend these two thoughts together. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know this quote I'm going to read. I think brother Shawn read it last weekend or something, but he said, "Now, you cannot do anything unless you know what you're doing." &gt;&gt; You must know that it is the will of God. You must know that it his plan and his desire and it's revealed to you. Revealed to you. Revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Revelation revealed to you. We're rarely going to emphasize revelation because revelation is our subject. Revelation removes fear. &gt;&gt; You must know that it is his plan, his desire, and it's revealed to you and there's nothing going to stop it. Another time, brother man says, you got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You got to know what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Remember always, faith is a revelation. understood faith is a revelation. Now with this open book, faith has been restored by the seventh angel messenger. Also, brother Bam said the Holy Ghost was bound for 2,000 years, but was to be loosed by the seventh angel messenger. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. We know that. Now, I want to set the stage just a little bit uh for the last days of Leodysia. That's where we are today. This is Satan's Eden. This is Satan's paradise. This is Satan's kingdom. This is Satan's zed. You have to understand this is the last days of Leosa. This is his this is his great paradise and we're living right in the middle of it or at the end of it. Take it back. The end of it. Everything in the world order today is evil. It's perverted. It's anti-word. It's polluted. It's deceiving. It's corrupt. It's Sodom. It's Gomorrah. Fear everywhere. Everything is fear. Doom, glued, apocalypse, you name it. It's all fear. &gt;&gt; The lid's been taken off of hell. 200 million demons been released since uh uh Hitler and Stalin in the 40s in World War II. And brother Bram even said his souls is now in prison. He said there I was in JC Penney store again. He said there I was in JC Penney back in hell again. &gt;&gt; Back in hell again. What was he trying to say? Hell is upon this earth. The lid of hell has actually been taken off. So all those demons now are focused on who? the closest thing to God which is his bride. &gt;&gt; But our kingdom that's Leoa that's the stage for the last days of Leosa. But our kingdom teaches different. Our king declares that revelation takes away fear and perfect love casts out fear. Now the natural always types of spirits. We know that. Let's brief briefly just look at a couple of different well there's all kinds of different types of of of u fears but just just a couple because I want to just cover maybe one or two or three or four just different types of fear. Now we know we got a winter storm coming. Okay, we all heard that. Now how do we know that? Social media uh radio on your phone, iPad, whatever like that. Because of modern radar they've been able to warn us that there's going to be a storm coming. How much we're going to get? We don't have a clue, but there's going to be some precipitation of some point. So, because of that, that actually when you believe, if they're accurate, if you believe what they're saying, that's a form of revelation. Now, that revelation is going to give you an understanding where you actually can prepare and be less caught off guard when that time comes. So, there is a benefit. There is one type of of fear that you don't have to worry as much as you if it just come 100 years ago. You don't have a clue. You know, you wake up the next morning, you got a foot of snow. You didn't know it was coming. &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful for that. Here's another time. Here's a simple little thing. What if you didn't have a gas gauge in your car? &gt;&gt; Okay, you're driving, you're going down Texas Highway and you know, and they just for miles and miles and miles and m you don't have a gas. Well, let's see now. I'm supposed to get out. Let's see. Now, wait. I've done 100 miles. If you didn't have a gas gauge in your car, guess what? You're going to be worried every 20 minutes. I'm going to run out of gas. I'm going to run out of gas. the one place you don't want to run on gas in Texas on a highway, you know, when there's no place to stop. Well, plenty place to stop. No gas stations. &gt;&gt; So, you know, you have a gas gauge in there. And now, even modern cars have a little light blinking and you know, when you get down, you got a gallon left. So, you know, it's a warning light. That's a warning light. That's that is to help you. &gt;&gt; That takes away fear. That's a simple illustration, but that takes away fear. When you get down to the end, it's time to get gas. I don't have to worry about it. Now, there's there's principles behind these little illustrations. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, remember, as I just said, you've got to first know what you're doing before you can have faith to do it. And faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Now, uh, a couple other things I want to tell, and I'm going to try to abbreviate them. I remember several years ago, I think it was a 95, 94, 95, we took a hunting trip to Colorado. It was it was brother Mark Namos and and Sam and Johnny and his sons and um and myself and we kind of hunt and and and have a buddy system. So I was with brother Mark. We didn't hunt together, but we know where each of us is going to hunt. And I'm going to just try to condense this. So I was out on this canyon and had the four-wheeler and been hunting all day. So when it got down to the end, uh it's about 5:00 or something. It's time to go back to camp. So for and I know the reason when we get that but my four-wheeler wouldn't start. I did everything I could. So I'm 13 miles from the camp. It's already we had a not a blizzard but a storm coming. It's already starting to snow. A lot of my trick trek back was uphill. I had to carry my rifle and my pistol and I'm I've got to start walking back towards I can't stay there all night. I'll freeze to death out there. So I got one hope of getting out of there. Now Mark knew about where I was at but he didn't know. I mean, I should have been back, you know, at 5:30, 6:30, whatever. So, I started walking and I walked and I walked and I walked. Now, I want you to understand where I was at down that canyon. It was a a logging road and a four and a regular pickup could go down that logging road. Then it got within about four miles of where I was at that canyon. It reduced down to a little four-wheeler trail. A vehicle couldn't go down there, but just a four-wheeler. But this little trail went way out about a mile or two and then curved back in and then went back up there towards the the the road coming in. And it's dark. It's snowing and I've got to walk this thing back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. I knew one thing now. I could have taken the shortcut and actually gone from that point where I was at and gone through the wilderness, through the woods to maybe cut off a mile or mile and a half. But then I'm just out in the woods. don't know, have a clue where I'm at and so forth like that. But I knew one thing. I had this one revelation. If I stay on that, I knew how I got in there. I had I come in on a logging trail. A logging little trail. I knew if I stayed on that logging trail, I'm eventually I'm going to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Don't deviate. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, that's another Now, you say, "Well, Brother Terry, was you was you scared?" Not very much. cuz I knew if I stayed on that trail, if I didn't get hypothermia and just die from my body temperature, you know, getting down so low, I was going to make it out there even if I had to walk the 13 miles. So, actually, I walked about four miles and it was about three or four hours. And I'm just, you know, and there was another guy in a tent over there, but he the snow he done packed up and left. So, I thought I'm probably going to have to walk back to camp, but I was determined to do it. I was well on my way probably 4 miles and I saw a faint light way in the distance out there and got closer and closer and closer and it was a headlight of a pickup truck and finally came up there. Mark said, "Hey buddy, you want to ride?" I believe I could have kissed him. I believe I could have hugged him right there because I didn't I don't care. I don't care who it was. That light meant humanity and somebody is going to help me. But I knew my point is my revelation was if I stay on that trail, &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it back to safety. If you stay on God's trail, this word, you're going to make it to safety. But you got to have a revel. What is the trail? What is the path? I am the way. There's only one way. You got to stay with that. &gt;&gt; Now, here's a here's another type of of uh fear that I want to talk about. And this is a experience I had in the Air Force. And I was afraid. I love to fly and I was a crew chief on C130 and the the crew chief flew with the airplane especially overseas. We took care of all the maintenance and we flew all over Europe on a 4 engine big 4 engine cargo C130. Okay. We was flying from England down to uh Suda Bayrete aisle in Lrete. And when we got about even with Athens, Greece, loadmaster came up told us that look we are the the elevator boost pack is spurting out hydraulic fluid. The primary and the secondary we're just losing hydraulic fluid. It's the same thing as your power steering goes out on your car. When your power steering goes out, you can a little bit steer that. But on an airplane when it's power steering goes out, it's all cables. You cannot move them surfaces. It's almost impossible. So it was it was dee uh depleting the system very very fast. So we called Athens at Mayday Mayday. They they cleared us to land. We was about 10 15 minutes from Athens. So we made emergency land there. Okay. 3 days later I got a new elevator boost pack. I put the elevator boost pack in me and the other crew chief. So we we took it out, ran the engines and did through all the flight control services. Everything looked good. Now, of all the flying that I did when I was overseas, I got scared twice, and this was one of them. I was scared to death. Here's what happened. Okay, we get down. We only had uh a little bit of cargo, 3/4 fuel, you just make a small trip to Spain or wherever. So, the normal takeoff is run your engine up, take off, rotation about 150 knots, whatever. pull the yolk back, have an angle of attack you climb out on and, you know, go up so much, bring your flaps in, etc., etc. We know the nor takeoff. Now, as a crew chief, I'm up in the flight deck with a pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, navigator, and I'm I'm up there in the flight deck, and I'm on headset, and I know all the instructions for landing, takeoff all the time. But this time, for what I was busy doing something else, I did not get the takeoff instructions. very very critical to this situation in my illustration. This true story. So here we are. We're taking off. Normally like I said, you go have a certain angle attack. You go up. Everything's fine. So we go down the road, go down the runway rather. He pulls it back just a little bit. We just barely get off the ground. Now remember the elevator boost pack. I changed I helped change it. Me and the other crew chief. So if it don't work, guess whose fault it is? &gt;&gt; So this is in my mind, you know. So He gets up just above the trees. He retracts the landing gear, which is unusual because it usually gets higher than that. Retracts the landing gear. And I'm thinking, "This ain't good. This ain't good. We're just barely clearing the trees." And getting up more speed, more speed, more speed, and we're just barely clearing the trees. But he's getting up more air speed, more air speed. About that time, I didn't see the the yolk, but the airplane just went like that from to almost straight up. Then it almost straight up then he falls over to the side. I said that's it. We're finished. It's over. I mean, we're dead. Gone. I was scared to death. Why? Cuz I had put it in there. I had done a maintenance on it. Something was wrong cuz what he did was not normal. We've never done that before. Now, the problem is I was not on the headset. I did not get the the take off instructions. These symptoms that I just described to you were false symptoms because once he had pulled out and fell over like that and and and evened out, I heard the tower. I was on the headset there and the tower said, "Nice takeoff, guys. Enjoyed that Shaunell takeoff." That was kind of a little um exhibition takeoff they did for the tower. &gt;&gt; Now listen, okay? Had I been on the headset and had I known the takeoff instructions, I would have enjoyed every second of that takeoff. But because they were fault symptoms, if you will, I thought that the plane was not function correctly because something wrong with the boost pack. Because of that, I had fear. I was literally Sean afraid. It's over. It's finished. &gt;&gt; Wow. But had I had that revelation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Revelation takes away fear. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now that's in the natural. Let's we can type that in the spiritual. You can you can you can you can talk about and we no need to go through all the examples, but there's dozens in the Bible. Elijah when there was some dispute between uh you know Ahab and God and and Elijah was going to call fire down from heaven and Elijah says you know before he called down that fire he says all these things I have done at thy command &gt;&gt; command &gt;&gt; at thy command. Now what is what is he saying &gt;&gt; Elijah had seen a vision or God had spoke to him what was fixed to take place. Elijah was not afraid. None. Zero zilch. Because he knows what was going to happen. He had no fear, you know, and he even mocks them, you know, put water on it, bring more barrels in, not get what like that. He knows what was going to happen. So, he had no fear of what was going to take place. &gt;&gt; True, right? &gt;&gt; All these things I've done at thy command. &gt;&gt; Revelation takes away fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, and we could talk about here's another another type of fear. Now, this of course, brother was a prophet of God. He saw visions. And we've spoke about it many times, but I just read the last part of it. Talking about the maniac in Portland. And in the book, probably some of you read that night when the maniac run to the platform there at Oregon was going to take my life. Somebody said, "Brother Brandom, was you scared?" &gt;&gt; Now, you have to put yourself in your place there. This guy, he says about 7 foot tall. I mean, he was out of his mind. He said, "I'll break every bone in your body." And he well could do it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Random, was you scared?" I said, "No, sir. Not a bit." Now, we either believe that or we don't. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as Jesus is there and as long as he told me to do this and I'm in his will, there's nothing to fear." See, as long as you're doing what he says do and you know you're directly led, I mean, there's there's some criteria in here now. You're directly led. Well, there's nothing to fear. Perfect. And then he, brother Bam, actually refers back to that scripture that we're reading. Verse 18, perfect love casts out all fear. &gt;&gt; There is no fear in God. Love takes away fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, before we go any further, we got this idea about perfect love and what is perfect love and all about perfect love. Brother Bam said, the angel said, "Had this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love." I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I want to bring this in right now. We only take with us what? Our character. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if we're going to have to have perfect love over there, cuz the only thing that'll enter here is perfect love. You know what that means? I'm not real smart, but I know that that means you got to have it here if you're going to take it with you to get in there. So, if we got to have it here before we leave, I want to ask you, when do we get it? &gt;&gt; When do we get perfect love? &gt;&gt; Oh, but perfect love, that's such a great big high thing. It is. It is. But we got to have it on this side. Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Because it that's the only thing that'll enter. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I I thought about this, you know, being in the the seed time and harvest time. And I thought about this right before I left. I uh printed out the quote. If I would ask you a question, we know we're supposed to have it before we leave. We know we're supposed to have it to get in there. Was there any another any other age ever had perfect love? Interesting. Yes, there was one age Ephesians age. You know, there was it really started about I think brother V said AD55 was the start of the Ephesians church age. Christ was ended at 33. So it's about 22 23 years between that time when the church was in its perfection if you will. Dan actually started the first church age and brother Bram actually talks about and I'll read the whole thing but the rebuke to the feast of Ephesus church age and he goes down and talks about different things like that but to save time and he says down at the end he said God rebuked their living leaving their first love for backsliding and for no longer bearing light. Ephesus was not a deceived church. It failed. Now listen, it failed. Why it failed? He said it failed. itself by not continuing in perfect love. &gt;&gt; Those first 20 years they had perfect love. &gt;&gt; This is harvest time. Somebody's going to have perfect love. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, uh, and we read that about, listen, he says, uh, as long as you're doing what he says, then he said, I already read that part, but as long as you're doing what he says, do and you know that you're directly led. Well, then there's nothing to fear. Perfect love cast out fear. There's no fear in God. Love takes away all fear. Now, in 1 John 4:18, perfect love cast out fear. Now, this scripture usually, and I'm want to try to not preach a lot right now, but I want try to go through these things here so we can don't want to hold too long. Uh, this scripture really deals usually deals with people having love one for another. And that's true. And brother Ma'am also quoted, "Perfect love cast out fear." And that's true. And he quoted when he's talking about the killer bull, perfect love cast out fear. And that's all true, too. And with the hornets, and that's also true. And we know that. And also, brother Beam used this phrase dealing uh like if you're afraid that you wrong somebody or hurt somebody, that's true also. But if you notice these scriptures in and in and uh u first John 4 having to do with salvation and that's what we want to really focus on. It actually has to do with f salvation. That's what we want to look at. Fear. fear in verse verse uh 18 actually comes from the this is really interesting comes from the Greek word and that word is phobus which means dread or terror and that's where we get our word phobia &gt;&gt; phobia you got which is phobia is irrational excessive or a persistent fear of something or situation you got claustrophobia uh that's enclosure small enclosure A acrophobia that's afraid of heights. Hydrophobia that's water and and John I think he's writing about Christophobia if you want to talk about that people having fear about salvation. Now fear almost every time a human came into the presence of the angel of the Lord or any angel what's the first words always come out of the angel's mouth first two words that comes out of all situations fear not. First thing they say, fear not. Go back and read all of them. Zachcharias, Mary, Joseph, Paul in the ship 14 days. Brother Ram 1946 when he got his commission. Fear not. I'm in come from the presence of almighty God. And on and on and on. Why? Because it's it's an awesome thing to be even in an angel's presence. What about when you're in God's presence? &gt;&gt; My such a awesome thing. So God doesn't want us to fear. That's the trick of Satan. God doesn't want us to to fear at all. So verse 18 again, there is no fear in love, but perfect love cast out fear because fear have torment. He that fearth is not made perfect in love. Now this scripture is written to believers. So I want to ask you a question. Can a believer have fear and torment at the same time? And I'm going to answer that. Well, yes and no. It depends. If a Christian can actually live in fear and torment concerning their destiny if they don't really have a new birth or they don't really have a revelation of their conversion or they don't understand this scripture but once they are truly born again truly have a revelation of of this scripture and the love of God in their heart and what God's love for them is and justification and all these ramifications there is no fear Perfect love cast out fear. &gt;&gt; God's love is perfect. And God's love toward us is perfect. &gt;&gt; So this uh mystic idea of what is perfect love? Yeah, it's somewhat mystic, but it's it's really a simplicity of we'll get to it in a minute. Brother says, "No man knows the things of God." Or the scripture says, "No man knows the things of God, say the spirit of God, and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them." Brother B says we need to call on God for revelation more than anything else in the world. We have accepted the Bible. We have accepted the great truths of it. But still it's not real to most people because the revelation by the spirit is not there. &gt;&gt; The word has not been quickened. Every word is seed and every every seed has got to be quickened at some point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As we well know uh Jesus asked disciples, who do you say I the son of man am? And Peter said, "The art of Christ, flesh and blood has not revealed the issue, but my father which is heaven, upon this rock, I'll build my church." We understand that it's the whole church is built on the spiritual revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Spiritual revelation all about revelation. Spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; The whole church is built, it's the most fundamental doctrine. It's built on the spiritual revelation of who Christ is. Another time, brother says, "The importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized. Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize. And I'm not talking about this book of Revelation. I'm talking about all Revelation. It's tremendously tremendously important to the church. Not only tremendously important, it's actually paramount. It's critical. It's actually so critical. Uh it's it's s so high on the scale. There's nothing really surpassed because well, of course, we know that the only thing that might be higher if you want to look at it that way. Brother man said, "Lay aside everything until you get perfect love because perfect love is the only thing that's going to enter there." &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; So then we want to blend what is perfect love and how does perfect love cast out fear? &gt;&gt; Let's look at that. And before we leave tonight, I want you to really better understand about revelation of perfect love. Okay? I want you to let's dig a little deeper. &gt;&gt; Let's look at love. Let's look at perfect love. Uh we're going to go through some the scriptures of St. John or 1 John 4 and let's start with verse 10. First John 4:10. Here in herein is love. Really herein is love. Okay. He said herein is love statement. Don't miss this. Not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be a propit forit perpetuation for us. There again, salvation. Salvation. Salvation. Verse 11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to love one another. Again, God's love for us was salvation. Our love for others that they would also possess salvation. Still has to do with salvation. Our love for others that they truly also will be saved. Verse 12, no man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us. In us, in us. And what is his love? What is his love? His love is his life. &gt;&gt; We want his. We need his life in us. And what what is the token life? What is the token? The literal life of Christ in the believer. Verse 13. Hereby we know that here again. Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us. Salvation. We're talking about this. All these verses are 1 John 4 all the way down to verse 18. Salvation. Salvation. Salvation. Hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit. What did he give us of his spirit? The spirit of adoption that we might come to full maturity in this day. 14 And we have seen and do testify to that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Salvation. 15. Whosoever conf shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. I in you and you in me. There again, salvation. Now, that don't just mean, well, I believe Jesus Christ son of God. that that's it's got to be a a manifestation, a sincerity, a new birth. Words could be cheap. You know what I'm saying? It's got to be a real word birth. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And we have known and believed the love of God hath to us. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. &gt;&gt; God is love. &gt;&gt; And he that dwelleth in love. Now dwelleth don't mean come and go in and out. Dwelleth means remains. dwelleth remain. He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. How how many times just in these verses I in you, you and me. I in you, you and me. I in you. In that day, what day? This day is this one of the scriptures for our day. I you and me. Again, verse 17. Herein is our love made perfect. Okay. Herein is our love. God's word, God's love is already perfect. Herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment. Now let's look at that again. Okay, again salvation. Okay, first thing you must understand, what is the day of judgment? What is the day of judgment for the bride? We don't have to face him in the judgment. We stand with him in the judgment. The bride takes her judgment now. The bride is judged or purged by the bleeding word, by the washing of the water, by the word. We take our judgment right now. We don't stand at the judgment. We're with him in the judgment. We don't stand before him to be judged. We have received our judgment now. &gt;&gt; We must have these revelations. &gt;&gt; Okay, here's what brother B said. We we believe this to be true. Say, "Well, brother Ram, don't we have to stand and the judgment is?" No, sir. We do not stand before the judgment. We are not we are now standing before the judgment. God put our sins upon Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He that hearth my words. St. John 5:24. How many hundred times did he quote that? He that believeth on him has sent me has eternal life and shall not come into the judgment, but has passed from death unto life. No more judgment for the church. He's talking about the bride. It's tuck up in the rapture and comes back to pass judgment on those people who did not receive the Holy Ghost. So, we understand that's why I said only the Holy Ghost is going to enter here. We're talking about bride. We're talking about rapture. We're talking about going living in the city. We're talking about the wedding supper. We're talking about living in the the the eternal kingdom of the new city must have the Holy Ghost. Now, there is a whosoever will group that don't have the Holy Ghost. There's people that are given eternal life, but we're talking about bride material that's predestinated, ordained, and has the very life of God, the token, the spirit of God in them. Before we leave that this before we leave this world and brother says in this uh well, let me just look at this right here as we go through the scriptures can still try to remember when the bride recognizes who she is and what she is, then the rapture will go. things that we need to remember in that day she used to know the eye and you and father so we talked about that the token is a literal life of Christ we understand the token &gt;&gt; do we believe that &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; the token if you got the token that's the literal life of Jesus Christ dwelling in you &gt;&gt; that's really hard that's really now you know the literal life of Christ dwelling in my soul yes sir you've got to recognize are you worthy of it no &gt;&gt; but he gave it to you as a free gift you must accept it. &gt;&gt; You got to accept it. &gt;&gt; Only those with the token baptism of the Holy Ghost, a word birth go in the rapture. And as I said, only perfect love will enter into that place. Now, as I just I quoted it, but I'm going to read it what he said. And and when he had that translation at the end of the translation, that voice spoke to him and said, "And I heard a voice and spoke to me in that room and said, "This is what you preach was the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love." And nothing can enter here without it. I'm more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there. So it takes perfect love to enter there. We must have it here. &gt;&gt; Then when are we going to get it? the day before we leave, two hours before we get leave. I can't answer that specifically, but I know we got to have it before we leave. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is what you preach was the Holy Ghost." This what that place of perfection. That place of perfection, only the Holy Ghost is going to with people with the Holy Ghost is going to enter that place of perfection. And brother Brand said one place he said, "You got to be perfect to get there in invisible union." and said, "How do you ever think to be perfect except by the perfect bleeding word that God has uh given to us in this day to to wash our sins by the washing of the water?" By the word, it takes a perfect bleach and a perfect son of God to make a perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. You know, when you think about even the word bleach, I looked it up and I don't remember if I can remember the exact words, but brother M used the words bleach from I think 53 few times. But for the opening during the the the seven seals, he used the words he only said it like 47 times on recorded tape, but over 30 times he used it during the seals. Bleach, bleach, bleach. What is the opening of the word? What is the opening of the word telling us? You're now justified. It's an invisible union to the bride of Clyde. What does the bleach do? When a drop of ink is dropped into that tub of bleach, the ink actually becomes the bleach. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. What what age are we living in? What age are we really living in? That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why in verse 17 again, herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in that day of judgment. That day of judgment for the bride is now. Boldness means confidence. And when you have boldness, confidence, revelation, revelation, assurity that you are sealed away in Christ by a word birth of this message which is Christ. Then in verse 17 says, "As he is, so are we in this world." Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I don't know if they they're not putting it up there, but he says there, "As he is, so are we in this world." &gt;&gt; As he is, if we're fulfilling the scripture, this scripture with perfect love. As he is, so are we in this world. I, you, you, and me. That really that really sheds a lot of light on the authority that God has given to his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be the final voice. &gt;&gt; Oh mercy. &gt;&gt; This this is not just for whosoever will. This is not just for anybody. This is a chosen bride. &gt;&gt; This is a this is a privilege. This is a privilege to be chosen to be his bride. &gt;&gt; Then verse 17, as he is, so are we in this world. again in that day I and the father the father he and me and I and you and you and me. Now what is bride time, harvest time, seed time with the open book? The judge is here declaring you are absolutely justified as though you never did it in the first place. As though you never did it in the first place. Well, my question, you never did it in the first place. When was the first place? What was the first place? I'll tell you what the first place was. that was in the mind of God, in the thoughts of God as he saw you as a redeemed son of God. And you, we only bypass uh our theophony come to this earth to be tested and tried. But like Job said, where were you? &gt;&gt; Where were you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were you in the mind of God already redeemed, already already set in motion, if you will. &gt;&gt; We only come down there to be tested and tried. &gt;&gt; We're playing out the drama. We've got to have a revelation of these things. really who we are not worthy of it but he said it so I accept it &gt;&gt; is right &gt;&gt; as he is as he is how what you say or as he is what is he is pure holy loving then so are we in this world we we've got quite a challenge sir &gt;&gt; being saved from all sin all our sins and made like unto himself in righteous and true holiness remember what it said about the drop of ink it becomes the bleach That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here's another challenge I want to make to you. You believe you become the righteousness of God, the very God, his righteous. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, your flesh, forget it. Your spirit realm, forget it. We're talking about your soul. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's godly about us is our soul. The rest of it is just that's superfluous. Okay? But brother Bram says in in the revelation of Jesus Christ, a church age book, this is so outsetting and we must don't I wish we could put it all up on the screen. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteous of God by our union with Jesus Christ. Do you get it? He says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ. It says that he Jesus became sin for us. It does not say he became sinful, but he became sin for us that by our union, invisible union with him, we might become the righteousness of God. Now listen to this. Now here's the challenge. If we accept the fact, and we must, that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us, then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have become the very righteousness of God. He said to reject one is to reject the other. To accept one is to accept the other. Now we know the Bible says that it can't be nied. But brother I'm saying the revelation the revelation &gt;&gt; of it is missing. It's not real to the majority of even God's children. &gt;&gt; It's not real to the majority of God's children. God's children. But he does have elected elected group that will have that revelation because only perfect love is going to enter that place. &gt;&gt; But the revelation is missing. It's not only it's not real to the majority of God's children. It's just a good Bible verse. But we need to have it made alive. And that will take revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Revelation. &gt;&gt; That is true. &gt;&gt; Who gives revelation? There's only one gives revelation. I can't give it. Sean can't give it. &gt;&gt; Amos can't give it. Your wife, your husband can't give it. Nobody. Only God. &gt;&gt; They can teach you. There's a lot of there's a lot of difference between revelation and information. &gt;&gt; Even many of the the preachers who have left left the message, they have a they have a lot a lot a wealth a wealth of information. &gt;&gt; But if they had a revelation, they would never left the message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. information is wonderful. I love it. I love the mysteries, the seals, pools, thunders, whatever. But revelation, that's what seals us in. Brother B said, you're saved by revelation. Okay, back to the scripture. Verse 7. Herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is, so are we in this world. If we don't have a revelation of this scripture and this quote, our love is not made perfect yet. Remember, revelation takes away fear. We must have that revelation so that we won't have to fear. We won't have to have dread. That we won't have to have torment. Now, let's talk about just won't too much longer. One of the main things I want to get to verse 18, s first John 4:18. There's no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear. Because fearth have torment, he that fearth is not made perfect in love. &gt;&gt; Let's break down this fear issue just a little bit. There is no fear in love, but perfect love cast out fear. There's a difference between the fear of God &gt;&gt; and being afraid of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fear of God is a high regard for him, ultimate respect, soberness in his presence, absoluteness of his authority, extreme loyalty to his word, on and on and on. That's the fear. That's the right kind of fear. You must have that. That's the right kind of fear. But to be afraid of God, it comes from this. To be afraid of God, it comes by some measure of guilt. Comes by some measure of guilt. Now, where does that put things like see a forgiveness, true repentance, revelation, you've been forgiven. &gt;&gt; All of these things cannot be no guilt. That's why we're teaching on this tonight. Perfect love casteth out fear. &gt;&gt; Fear have torment. &gt;&gt; If you have fear and torment, you're not made perfect in love. It's gonna take perfect love to get there. &gt;&gt; So, this is very, very important tonight. To be afraid of God, it comes from some measure of guilt. Now, listen friends, I'm gonna tell you, &gt;&gt; this message is so tremendous. Uh when I was in the Air Force, I bought a couple of motorcycles, but I bought one motorcycle and uh Honda 350 Scramler uh gave me the the guy $450. I paid him $400. Said, "I I don't have the rest of it. I'll pay it to you soon as I get it in the next two or three weeks, whatever, like that." Guess what? The guy got transferred. He moved. Don't even know the guy's name. He's gone forever, right? &gt;&gt; I owe him $50. I wasn't saved at the time. I got saved. I owed him $50. Well, God forgive me. Yeah, God forgive me, but I couldn't forgive him. I owed him. And now, that's not the worst thing I've ever done. That's not the worst thing. But that this one haunted me. Even after I got saved going to the Pentecostal Holiness Church for 10 years. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I couldn't get a revelation that I couldn't get a revelation that I truly did not have freedom that I was remitted. My sins were remitted. When I came into this message and I got a revelation of true justification, it was over. Finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; None. Zero. But it took a revelation of what God's love for me that I could reciprocate back with my love towards God and accept the fact that he loved me enough. Forgive me. Been much worse things we've all done. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that's the one thing that haunted me. Why? I don't know. &gt;&gt; But it's under the blood. Hey, if I if I can meet the guy today, I'd pay him the money. &gt;&gt; I'd pay him the money. &gt;&gt; But if I never meet him on this side, it's under the blood. It's gone. It's finished. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a revelation. That's a revelation of justification as though you never did it. God knew that before he chose me in from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Okay. Lack of revelation. Lack of revelation of forgiveness. Misunderstanding. This is a bad kind of fear. Why are we afraid of God? Misunderstanding of grace versus works. Grace versus works. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Back in the Pentecostal holiness church, I mean it was works, works, works, works, works. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No, this kind of fear is a dread for the day of judgment. Also comes from feelings and not faith. This kind of fear have torment. If you have these kinds of fears, your love has not been made perfect yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; A perfect love for God and with God casted out all fear and being lost or rejected. A perfect love for God will give you and it will cast out all your fears of being lost or ever being rejected. A perfect love for I'm talking about a perfect love for God. I mean, brother man said you can love God and be lost, but I'm talking about a perfect love for God. A perfect love for God will res will believe and receive what he has promised for you. He loved you so much say I forgive you of your sin. Then you if you don't accept it a pardon is not a pardon unless it be received as a pardon. In other words, a worshipper once purged has no more conscious of sin. In other words, he feels no more guilt for past sins and has no more desire for sin. Isn't that a beautiful scripture? A worshipper must a worshipper uh &gt;&gt; once purged has no more conscious of sin. No more desire for sin. No more guilt of sin. It's all under the blood. &gt;&gt; He feels no more guilt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, if when you feel no more guilt for what we've done, now we're coming into that perfect love realm because God desired that you'll have no dread, no fear. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And no guilt. &gt;&gt; Now, we had better, now we have a better understanding. Let's put it that way. Why? The angel said, "This is what you preach with the Holy Ghost. This is perfect love." And it will take perfect love to enter that place. So now we understand perfect love castes out fear of that's of the soul. But what about of the body and the flesh? If the musicians will come, let's just suppose, let's don't suppose that the love of So let's don't suppose that the love of God or perfect love casts out all kinds of fear because it doesn't. We still have fears of dangers, storms, emergency, preservation of life, natural fears, fears of having an accident on the highway, fears the fears of failure, mind battles. But even with all these natural fears that everybody has with our flesh and our spirit, not salvation, not soul, flesh and spirit, we must remember this one scripture right here. Romans 8:35-39. Very, very, very, very familiar. But don't never forget these scriptures just for the natural fears that we have in this natural life. Not the soul, but spirit and flesh. Who shall separate us &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ? Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword. As it is, as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. In all of these things we're more than conquer in all of these things. Doesn't the Bible teach us all things work together for it doesn't say good because all things are not good but it says all things work together for the good. Whole lot of difference between good and the good. All things work together for the good of that who love God, who are called according to his purpose. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Brother Sean, come on up. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, all the things that we face in layout see &gt;&gt; nor powers nor things present nor things to come. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Neither height nor depth. He covers everything. He covers it all. nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Nothing. Nothing. You're sealed in. Satan's sealed out. Are you going to have sickness? Yes. Are you going to have mind battles? Yes. Are you going to have troubles? Yes. But nothing can separate us from the love of God. But when we're truly born again, know that you pass from death to life, have a word birth, there's no condemnation, there's no dread, there is there's no fearfulness that I'm going to miss the rapture, I'm sealed in. If we want to say it in common language, I'm as good as there. That's just that's just the way God wrote it. That's just the way God's word is. That's why this message is so tremendous. There's nothing like it. So when a person truly truly is birthed into the kingdom of God by a word birth and truly has the genuine love of God, God's own life in their heart, the new birth is a revelation. And that revelation removes all dread, removes all fear, removes all torment. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is what you preached was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You love him. Let's stand. God bless you. Oh, like Jesus, make me more like thee. Oh, give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. Can you sing it as a prayer? Oh, make me more like thee. Jesus, make me more like thee. Oh, give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more like thee. Did you enjoy the service tonight? Amen. divine love. Thought of when brother Granham faced that bull, faced the the man, faced the hornets, them different things. It wasn't something that he could do himself. It was something that came to him. It was a love that only God could do. And because God is love, it's it's a supernatural thing. And I believe that's what's happening within us. It's it's God growing. And that revelation that Brother Terry was talking about, it's something that is taking place on a daily thing that we're coming more in connection with God. Amen. And uh such a revelation. Amen. And that's that's something that you know people want to say, well this message come from brother Brandham or it's it's man's idea or we're following a man. It's truly not. It's actually God revealing his mind to us and his life. It's we're it's an infusion, I guess, of of God coming into us and we becoming more godlike and the revelation of God is just becoming so real to us that it's imparting a divine love. I thought of, you know, just something simple like brother Brandham said. He goes, I am, he goes, he's a real God, isn't he? I'm so glad he can look over our mistakes. Aren't you? He said it makes us love him with all of our heart. It's just the things that God is doing and the things we're seeing God do and God making himself known to us. It's it's just all it's doing. It's creating such love within us. Amen. That we can love him, love one another. And I'm I'm so glad for that. I really appreciated that, Brother Terry. Amen. And um Amen. And I just pray that God just keeps revealing himself more and more. And I really like that uh what brother, you know, the example that brother Terry gave uh being lost or not lost but out broke down out in the the the Colorado and just stand straight with that word or that road. And I thought, you know what, that's true. Just stay with the message. It'll bring you through. You say, "Well, man, I'm sure lacking." Just stay with the message. Stay true. Don't go this way. Don't go that way. Everything else looks great. There might be an oasis for you somewhere's out there, and you might be going through some troubles and all that, but just stay right with the message. It'll bring you through. Can you say amen? And I love the Lord. Amen. And I certainly want uh amen to apply the word of God to my life. Amen. And um let's just sing this um uh song. Oh, how he loves you and me. Amen. Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave his life. What more could he give? Oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Sing it again. Oh, how he loves you. It's what the Bible says herein is love that he first loved us. Hallelujah. It all begins with God. He is love. He revealed it to us by coming being made flesh. Oh, how it makes us love him. Oh, oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. May you keep these words in your heart. Amen. And just ponder over them. If there's any condemnation, anything in your heart, just say, "Oh, God, take that from me and help me truly understand your love." Amen. Is that what you want God to do? Amen. And you know, as um we may not be able to have um service uh Sunday, we just play it by ear. Hopefully we can, but uh looks like we're going to get a lot of snow, but they're they're brother Random called them weather prophets. Amen. and uh you know and we get prepared because of what they're saying but we've been given a a word prophet in this age and uh and it's right on too. whatever he says it's right on the forecast is right and so we don't know about this other but it does look like it's going to be a lot of snow but uh whatever the Lord gives then we'll take and I pray that God just protects you keeps you safe and uh may your power electricity not go out.

But uh but just be in prayer for one another. Uh, good to have brother John. Man, brother John, you've been gone for so long. About had to introduce myself to you again. And uh uh been sure glad to have him back uh with us. And um uh just everyone uh that been sick over the weekend and good to have you all uh back with us. We want to just keep those that are still sick in our prayer and that the Lord will uh just help them to recover and uh help us that's not been sick to keep sidest stepping this thing. Amen. And uh uh good to have uh Sharon with us and Amen. uh she's expressing to my wife that the Lord's leading her to Kansas and so uh uh to live with some relatives there.

Amen. and u Lord will just keep you. Tell you what, we're we're so close to the coming of the Lord that we want to make every decision count. We want to make sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that we're following the will of God in every part of our life. Amen. God bless you. And uh let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, we're so thankful that we've had a forecast in this age that would let us know the events that are transpiring today. And it may seem chaotic to the world and it may just seem a whole mess, but Father, we see it as prophecy being fulfilled. We see everything getting ready for a rapture to take place. And Father, we're so thankful that you've revealed your love to us, Lord, to let us know that we are secure in you. And there's no death, no trial, there's no nothing that could take us from that love, Lord.
