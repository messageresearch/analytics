[37:00] chapter the book of Philippians
[37:06] the second
[37:10] chapter amen and before we go into the
[37:15] word may we just bow our
[37:17] head and talk to our
[37:22] Lord Heavenly Father we're so thankful
[37:27] that we can
[37:30] testify of your keeping power we Are
[37:34] Witnesses Lord of your Resurrection Lord
[37:38] within us father that
[37:42] Eternal
[37:44] something Lord that even when this body
[37:47] gives away
[37:49] and the
[37:51] corruption
[37:54] Decay tries to set in sickness or
[37:57] whatever it would be there's that
[38:01] Eternal quality within us father and
[38:04] that keeps us pressing on and we're so
[38:07] thankful for
[38:09] that and now we're asking that you would
[38:12] just Elevate us into Heavenly places
[38:16] Lord a
[38:18] rim that no mortal man can come into but
[38:23] Lord your
[38:25] spirit father father we're Eternal we're
[38:28] we're Spirit beings we're your children
[38:31] and youve called us Lord to come into
[38:34] this place Lord not in a carnal real but
[38:38] supernaturally Lord and it's in that
[38:42] place that you can work miracles that
[38:44] you
[38:45] perform the The
[38:47] Impossible and father we're just asking
[38:50] that you would just move among us this
[38:53] evening Lord take what little words that
[38:56] we would have and Lord I pray that you'd
[38:59] plant it deep in our hearts Lord and
[39:02] that when we leave this place we can put
[39:04] it into practice and watch you come on
[39:07] the scene father you alone know every
[39:11] need that is present here Lord and
[39:14] father we're just asking now that you
[39:16] would take over anoint my lips Lord and
[39:19] speak words Through Me Lord to your
[39:22] people and anoint their ears and their
[39:25] hearts to hear and receive we ask it in
[39:29] Jesus Christ's name and the church
[39:32] says amen and amen we've read this uh
[39:36] actually today uh this morning but
[39:39] Philippians 2 and we're going to read
[39:42] the
[39:44] U
[39:47] um fifth
[39:49] verse says let this mind be in
[39:54] you which was also in Christ
[39:57] Jesus say that again let this mind be in
[40:00] you which was also in Christ
[40:05] Jesus then if you'll go with me first
[40:08] Corinthians I believe it
[40:10] is
[40:14] um first corini 2
[40:21] and4 I think that's the scripture we're
[40:25] looking for
[40:29] praise the
[40:30] Lord uh we'll start at the 14th
[40:34] verse but the natural man receiveth not
[40:37] the things of the spirit of God for they
[40:39] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[40:41] know them because they are spiritually
[40:45] discerned but he that is spiritual
[40:47] judgeth all things yet he himself is
[40:50] judged of no man for who hath known the
[40:53] mind of the Lord that he may instruct
[40:56] him but we have the mind of Christ can
[41:01] you say Amen you can have your seats
[41:04] this afternoon
[41:08] and maybe just to continue along the
[41:12] thought of last Sunday that is
[41:14] expressing the mind of Christ and not
[41:19] going to take long but we we we
[41:23] know we we know this uh
[41:27] so it ain't going to be anything I guess
[41:30] new uh but yet it it is um it's um
[41:36] needful because this is what we are as
[41:41] Believers but uh I had read this uh last
[41:45] Wednesday uh last Sunday evening brother
[41:47] brandom said that we were created for
[41:50] the purpose of
[41:52] controlling and and ruling and to praise
[41:56] God and to live for
[41:59] him that is
[42:01] the that's the greatest thing that you
[42:04] could be created
[42:06] for no matter what you do in life
[42:09] whether you're the electrician plumber
[42:11] tow
[42:13] guy um housewife preacher Deacon
[42:18] whatever we may all have our different
[42:21] occupations our different ways of living
[42:24] and all these things
[42:26] but one thing that we all have something
[42:29] in common as sons of God and Daughters
[42:31] of God is that we were created for the
[42:34] purpose of
[42:35] ruling and controlling and to praise God
[42:38] and to live for God right and so that's
[42:42] what I want to talk on is just the
[42:45] common ground of what we have and what
[42:49] we are as as
[42:51] Believers there are several places where
[42:54] brother brandham talks about
[42:57] claiming and
[42:59] um such as he he would say we can claim
[43:04] our
[43:05] possession he's talking about how that
[43:08] the blood has
[43:09] come and Redemption but then he says we
[43:13] can claim our possession we can then he
[43:18] says in another place we can claim
[43:22] what's our
[43:23] own so I I think then we need to find
[43:27] out what's our
[43:29] own and the only way we can find out
[43:32] what's our own is by scriptures right so
[43:36] he says we can claim what's our own and
[43:40] everything he died for we can claim it
[43:47] Lord ain't that right so then he then
[43:51] that must be meaning that we are back in
[43:55] the position of of ruling and
[43:58] controlling right and so this word claim
[44:02] I looked it up it means to call
[44:05] for Amen to ask or seek to
[44:10] obtain by virtue of
[44:13] authority that's pretty good huh not
[44:16] just asking not just wishing but by
[44:20] virtue of authority we can call for it
[44:23] we can ask seek to obtain by virtue of
[44:27] authority by right to challenge as a
[44:32] right to demand as
[44:36] due uh to claim a debt to claim
[44:41] obedience or respect to assert or
[44:46] maintain as a
[44:48] right Lord so to think of that so so if
[44:53] if we if if we have the right to claim
[44:57] everything that is our own on now and
[45:00] everything that Christ died for then you
[45:03] don't just sit there and ask in in the
[45:05] sense of please can I have
[45:08] it that's not that's not being
[45:12] authoritative but you claim by virtue of
[45:15] authority I want it back it's mine I own
[45:20] that give it back give it to me right
[45:24] and we're not looking in the Bible
[45:27] seeking for promises in in hopes that we
[45:30] can have them and which ones are easy
[45:32] for us and which one you you can't judge
[45:35] Promises by by
[45:37] you you you judge Promises by what God
[45:40] said about
[45:41] it and then if you are a Believer then
[45:45] then you can you only judge it by what
[45:48] God has done for you as a Believer by
[45:50] the blood of Jesus Christ that you're
[45:52] washed you've been loosed you're from
[45:54] sin you're no longer a sinner right God
[45:57] can never see you as a sinner again not
[46:00] if you've got the baptism of the Holy
[46:01] Ghost ain't that right so so then you're
[46:05] not looking at this as a sinner wishing
[46:07] hoping Desiring one now it's it's now
[46:11] you have the right to claim it the book
[46:13] has been open the lamb has come to
[46:16] redeem and and it's in this age that
[46:19] he's CL he's coming he has come to claim
[46:22] everything that he has redeemed can you
[46:24] say Amen
[46:26] and so then then we have an authority we
[46:29] have a a a a power it's not really power
[46:33] it's
[46:34] Authority and then our Authority comes
[46:38] from the word of God ain't that right
[46:41] amen uh there has to be a basis of our
[46:44] Authority amen uh um I I I can't I can't
[46:48] conduct myself as a president would or
[46:51] pass laws as a president I Ain't Got No
[46:53] Authority but but he can because the
[46:56] government has given him that Authority
[46:59] amen a senator and and and then they
[47:01] they they do things because they have
[47:03] the authority to do it their Authority
[47:06] is they they have a basis of their
[47:09] Authority they have a basis in what they
[47:11] do ain't that right well then then then
[47:14] so is it for a Believer we our our our
[47:18] Authority has basis for this it's a
[47:21] founded upon the word of God there's a
[47:24] reason that we do what we do there's a
[47:26] we have a right to do it and not only do
[47:29] we have a right we have an obligation to
[47:31] do it can you imagine the president not
[47:33] doing
[47:35] squat maybe we already got there I don't
[47:37] know
[47:41] huh you don't have to imagine too
[47:45] far but can you imagine the Believers
[47:48] not doing
[47:50] that amen okay well so anyway uh uh so
[47:55] our power and authority comes from the
[47:57] word of God so then how insulting it is
[48:00] to God when we say we're Believers we're
[48:03] Christians yes we're redeemed we got the
[48:06] Holy Ghost and then we do nothing about
[48:08] it ain't that right so we we find that
[48:13] that in the beginning God put Adam
[48:16] behind the word and as long as he stayed
[48:18] behind it he was a a ruler and could
[48:23] exercise Dominion he was a ruler because
[48:25] he had the bases he his his authority
[48:28] come by the word of God and so God put
[48:32] man behind the word ain't that right and
[48:35] why did he put man behind the word to
[48:37] defeat Satan with he knew Satan was
[48:41] lurking in that Garden he knew he knew
[48:44] amen he created the guy right he he knew
[48:47] what was what was uh the potentials
[48:50] there but he gave man that word amen to
[48:53] hide behind as a a a a fortress and so
[48:58] all man had to do all man had to do is
[49:01] say God said and then leave it at that
[49:04] and walk away God said it God said it
[49:08] God said it ain't that right you see if
[49:11] he's hiding behind something whatever
[49:13] you're hiding behind then that means uh
[49:17] it's in front of you if you're hiding if
[49:20] I'm going to hide behind the pulpit see
[49:23] well then the pulpit is in front of me
[49:25] it's standing in between you and me
[49:28] ain't that right amen see well see then
[49:31] then then the word the word uh uh God
[49:35] put man behind that word well then that
[49:39] means that the word was in front of them
[49:42] and should have been in front of them at
[49:44] all times ain't that right see so the
[49:48] prophet says it like this the word would
[49:50] have been in front of them always and
[49:53] notice how he puts it thus said the the
[49:55] Lord thus sayth the Lord thus sayth the
[49:58] Lord right or left thus sayith the Lord
[50:01] no matter where they turn the word would
[50:03] be right there thus sayith the Lord thus
[50:06] sayth the Lord thus sayith the Lord
[50:08] ain't that right they didn't have to
[50:10] reason with it they didn't have to
[50:11] question it they didn't have to argue
[50:13] with it they didn't have to do nothing
[50:14] they were hid behind the word God said
[50:17] thus sayth the Lord thus say the Lord
[50:19] ain't that right see so after you become
[50:22] a Christian well then you the prophet
[50:26] said you are fortified by the word of
[50:28] God and any promise in the word of God
[50:33] that's what you are fortified by uh when
[50:37] you become a Christian ain't that right
[50:39] you are placed behind the word that is
[50:42] your Fortress a fortress is a stronghold
[50:46] see and so that means you're safe it's a
[50:49] fortress and if God provides the
[50:51] Fortress for you then you automatically
[50:54] know you're
[50:56] safe ain't that right you're safe from
[50:59] the enemy I don't and and the greatest
[51:01] enemy is the
[51:03] devil well practically it's the only
[51:07] enemy ain't that right see you're safe
[51:11] so the prophet says every promise in
[51:14] that that's is yours can you say that
[51:18] every promise in the Bible is
[51:22] mine every promise in the Bible is mine
[51:27] now he put them promises before you and
[51:31] shielded you from the devil you are hid
[51:35] behind every promise in this Bible can
[51:39] you say amen that's your Fortress see
[51:41] and he says the only thing you have to
[51:43] do is just reach and get it and go right
[51:47] on with it man wants to argue with it
[51:50] man wants to reason with it but God
[51:52] never intended for you to reason with it
[51:54] God never intended for you to argue with
[51:57] it God never intended for you to
[51:59] question it God intended for you to stay
[52:02] behind that word get it and just go on
[52:05] for it can you say amen and he says well
[52:09] you you know uh uh you ask well how how
[52:12] you know it's going to work I don't know
[52:14] how it's going to work see explain to me
[52:17] I don't know the only thing I know is
[52:21] that God gave his children the best
[52:23] attack that they could have
[52:25] and the best thing to attack with cuz he
[52:28] knows the working of the enemy can you
[52:31] say amen amen I'm telling you you're
[52:34] safe behind the word of God we're safe
[52:37] we're safe you don't have to do nothing
[52:39] just believe it can you say Amen see so
[52:42] that is your attack against the enemy
[52:45] every time he comes and we all know his
[52:47] attacks you know and and the prophet
[52:49] said the best way well the only way to
[52:51] overcome is to recognize the devil in
[52:53] every one of his tricks and but he's got
[52:55] the tricks but we're not stupid people
[52:58] amen we've been given a word we've been
[53:00] given a message ain't that right and the
[53:02] word tells us every one of his tricks
[53:04] amen the greatest battle ever fought you
[53:06] ought to go listen to it amen and how
[53:08] the devil fights in our minds he puts
[53:10] the thoughts in our mind amen he tries
[53:13] to uh uh put questions in our mind he
[53:15] gets us to reason amen but you don't
[53:18] have to listen to it recognize the devil
[53:21] in every one of his tricks amen and he's
[53:23] more than he's he's just a bluff he he's
[53:27] only a bluff he's already been whipped
[53:29] he's a liar can you say Amen so every
[53:32] negative thought that he puts in your
[53:34] mind it's a lie from the pits of hell
[53:37] you've got the truth the word of God is
[53:39] the truth the word of God is sure the
[53:41] word of God Amen will come to pass
[53:45] you've got a greater weapon than he does
[53:47] truth overcomes
[53:51] lies now God God knew he gave you the
[53:55] greatest thing to attack the devil with
[53:57] and to be fortified with and he knew
[54:00] that education would not be sufficient
[54:02] right he knew that religion would not be
[54:06] enough he knew that even gifts Amen in
[54:10] the church wouldn't be enough why
[54:12] because Satan is educated Satan can be
[54:14] just as religious Satan can impersonate
[54:17] any gift that God's got can you say amen
[54:21] that's right the only thing he cannot do
[54:23] is stay with that word word by word amen
[54:27] that's how you can go to toll with him
[54:29] is based upon the word of God don't you
[54:31] try amen to get on his ground and defeat
[54:34] him by your gifts don't try to do it by
[54:37] dreams don't try to defeat him by Vision
[54:40] don't try to uh uh defeat him by your
[54:42] prophecies prophecies come prophecies go
[54:45] can you say amen amen things can come
[54:48] things can go amen the only thing that
[54:51] we can defeat him with is by the word of
[54:54] God
[54:56] that's right now why why did God give
[55:00] his word to be our Fortress well the
[55:02] prophet said the reason why is God's
[55:04] word is eternal can you say that with me
[55:07] God's word is eternal God's word is
[55:09] eternal amen Satan can defeat you on any
[55:13] other ground but the word of God do you
[55:16] believe that amen that's why God did not
[55:19] send us amen an educated man a the
[55:22] Theologian he he did not send us
[55:25] psychologist he did not send us amen
[55:27] someone that just could prophesy and
[55:29] speak in tongues and and all that stuff
[55:31] he sent us a prophet so he can restore
[55:34] the word back to us so we could defeat
[55:37] the devil on any ground any situation
[55:40] under any
[55:43] circumstance can you say amen he sent us
[55:46] a prophet Amen in this age amen and not
[55:50] just a prophet the seventh angel ain't
[55:53] that right yes yes sir amen why to to
[55:57] reveal all the Mysteries Amen to take
[56:00] every mystery in this book and reveal it
[56:02] take the the things that were hid in the
[56:04] mind of God and reveal it to us there is
[56:09] no way that this Bride Can fail there is
[56:12] no way that this bride is going to be
[56:14] defeated there is absolutely no way that
[56:17] this bride is going to come up short
[56:19] she's got the word it's already been
[56:21] restored to her she will
[56:23] overcome
[56:25] am that's the
[56:27] truth Satan can defeat you on any other
[56:30] grounds but how can he defeat you when
[56:33] the word itself stands between you and
[56:36] him he can't he cannot change one
[56:40] syllable of the word of
[56:42] God can you say amen he can't he where
[56:46] God puts the period Satan can't change
[56:49] that where God puts the comma Satan
[56:52] can't change that where God puts a
[56:55] conjunction Satan can't change that
[56:57] whatever God says Satan cannot change oh
[57:00] he's tried to change it he's tried to
[57:02] misunderstand or misinterpret it to us
[57:05] Amen to where we can't recognize the
[57:07] word of God but then he sent a prophet
[57:10] that would catch the original mind of
[57:13] God the thoughts of God and bring it
[57:15] right back into Focus can you sayen he
[57:19] put everything exactly the way it should
[57:22] be to where all you had to do is just
[57:25] simply
[57:27] believe amen that's right if God said it
[57:31] it will
[57:33] happen ain't that right it'll happen
[57:36] just the way he intended it to happen
[57:39] now brother Braham said if God made a
[57:40] promise that is eternal and there's
[57:43] nothing nowhere can stop it can you say
[57:46] that with me there's nothing that can
[57:48] stop it no devil can stop it no sickness
[57:52] can stop it no mind battles can stop it
[57:55] no matter where Satan comes to you at he
[57:57] cannot stop it God said it it's going to
[58:01] happen can you say Amen see so he says
[58:05] you can turn turn every atom upside down
[58:09] turn it backwards and can never pierce
[58:12] the word of God one little word can't
[58:15] see cuz Jesus said both heavens and
[58:18] earth will pass away but my word shall
[58:22] never fail that's the best weapon there
[58:25] is it's the word of the Eternal God do
[58:30] you believe that see now what is the
[58:33] word of God the word of God is God
[58:35] himself so God gave the believer
[58:40] himself amen he said it's God himself he
[58:44] gave the believer himself to attack the
[58:47] Enemy by and other words he's the father
[58:50] and the word is God then the word is our
[58:54] father
[58:55] we were born by the word and he's
[58:59] standing in the Forefront for his
[59:02] children Lord can you say Amen see there
[59:06] you are he's standing out there in front
[59:10] for his
[59:12] children just think of it you're just
[59:14] old Flesh and Bones and Satan thinks
[59:17] you're just a a uh well if I can say it
[59:19] panty
[59:20] waste just some little old Wimp And in
[59:24] in reality you are but then God stands
[59:28] in front of you and now when Satan
[59:31] attacks you he's attacking God himself
[59:35] the Eternal God that can never be
[59:37] dethroned whatever God says is going to
[59:40] happen he says my word will not return
[59:43] unto me void can you say Amen but it
[59:46] shall accomplish that which I sent it to
[59:48] do ain't that right see so then he asked
[59:52] the question see what are we scared
[59:54] scared
[59:55] about you realize how many times he's
[59:57] asked that question what are you scared
[1:00:00] about why do you have
[1:00:02] fear this message should take away every
[1:00:05] fear that we've
[1:00:06] got the Lord fear is not of God fears of
[1:00:10] the devil you understand that when
[1:00:14] you're scared that you're going to miss
[1:00:16] miss it it missed the Rapture you
[1:00:18] realize that's the devil putting that
[1:00:19] stuff in your mind amen when you're
[1:00:22] scared of of that you're not going to
[1:00:24] get healed and the doctor's right and
[1:00:26] and and he gives you the death sentence
[1:00:27] and and fear just grips you that is of
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:30] devil for the Bible says the Spirit uh
[1:00:34] God has not given us the spirit of fear
[1:00:36] but of Love of and of a sound mind and
[1:00:39] of of of Peace can you say Amen see so
[1:00:43] we're born by the word he's standing in
[1:00:45] the Forefront for his children there you
[1:00:48] are he's standing out there for his for
[1:00:50] his children what are we scared about
[1:00:52] the Rapture is sure everybody say the
[1:00:54] Rapture is sure say this the coming is
[1:00:58] sure every blessing that's been promised
[1:01:01] is
[1:01:02] ours that's what he said every blessing
[1:01:06] that has been promised is ours all
[1:01:09] everybody say all no don't start
[1:01:12] dissecting it he said all belongs to us
[1:01:17] that's what God put before
[1:01:21] you he put that before you Hallelujah
[1:01:25] that's what he hid be he hid you behind
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] right what is Satan's weapon against you
[1:01:34] how manyan how many knows what Satan's
[1:01:35] weapon against you is Prophet says it to
[1:01:40] get you dis to disbelieve your
[1:01:42] weapon so God gives you the God God
[1:01:45] fortifies you with his word right every
[1:01:49] promise all promises belong to you and
[1:01:52] that's what he fortifies you with he
[1:01:54] also gives you a weapon and that's every
[1:01:57] promise in the book the word of God is
[1:01:59] your weapon ain't that right so now what
[1:02:03] Satan's job is is to stand back and
[1:02:05] start whispering to you oh you're just
[1:02:09] making this up you're
[1:02:13] crazy right and then he starts remind oh
[1:02:17] you prayed how long have you been
[1:02:18] praying now oh well I've been praying
[1:02:20] for 20 years and is your children
[1:02:22] getting any better well no oh see it's
[1:02:26] just it's it's just you you're just
[1:02:29] working things all in your
[1:02:32] head can you say man what's he doing
[1:02:35] he's gradually taking your weapon away
[1:02:38] he's gradually taking your fortification
[1:02:40] what's he doing he's actually drawing
[1:02:42] you out amen away from your Fortress
[1:02:45] amen and getting you to lay your weapon
[1:02:47] down and then when you lay your weapon
[1:02:51] down he's got you notice what a prophet
[1:02:55] says see he's there to get you to
[1:02:56] disbelieve your weapon listen if he can
[1:02:59] get you to disbelieve your weapon is uh
[1:03:02] uh equivalent if he can get you to
[1:03:04] believe that your weapon is not strong
[1:03:06] enough he has disarmed
[1:03:09] you come on Church don't come to church
[1:03:12] disarmed don't go to work disarmed don't
[1:03:15] wake up in the morning
[1:03:16] disarmed don't try to raise a family
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:21] disarmed can you say man don't try be a
[1:03:24] Christian
[1:03:25] disarmed yes sir don't put out
[1:03:27] testimonies
[1:03:29] disarmed cuz Satan's going to challenge
[1:03:31] you on every ground that you come to you
[1:03:34] can't be disarmed he'll meet you on
[1:03:36] everywhere every
[1:03:38] turn can you say Amen see look he's
[1:03:41] disarmed you when he get you to
[1:03:43] disbelieve that weapon and when you lay
[1:03:46] that down that finishes your
[1:03:51] fight you're
[1:03:52] done that's right that's what he says
[1:03:56] see when you lay your weapon what is
[1:03:58] your weapon word the word every promise
[1:04:02] of God how do I lay it down because I
[1:04:04] just let the dust fly amen over it no
[1:04:06] you've laid it down long before that
[1:04:08] amen what then how do I lay it down when
[1:04:10] you start disbelieving the word of God
[1:04:13] when you start reasoning the word of God
[1:04:15] yeah you're right I mean I know it's
[1:04:17] happening to everybody else but maybe
[1:04:18] God just ain't ain't want me maybe this
[1:04:20] is my lot of life is just to go through
[1:04:22] all of this that I I go through maybe
[1:04:24] Victory ain't really mine and maybe I'll
[1:04:26] just always have these habits well that
[1:04:28] is my makeup amen all you're doing is
[1:04:30] listen to a bunch of garbage that the
[1:04:33] devil is feeding you amen but God can
[1:04:36] only give you what one other one thing
[1:04:38] that he can give you is his word and
[1:04:41] it's not that he's going to give you his
[1:04:42] word he has given you his word he's
[1:04:45] already given you his
[1:04:47] word amen yes sir why would we argue
[1:04:51] with the word so you understand why
[1:04:53] Satan attacks the message attacks the
[1:04:56] prophet trying to get you to doubt the
[1:05:01] messenger can you say amen that's right
[1:05:04] so he said see when you lay that down
[1:05:06] that finishes your fight you're done

[1:05:41] prophecies and tongues and and shouting

[1:05:45] you can sit there as former as some old
[1:05:47] Baptist but you ain't got no defense
[1:05:49] amen we argue on all kinds of things and
[1:05:51] all kinds of points amen the problem is
[1:05:54] to stay with the word just keep the word
[1:05:57] it'll bring you Revival it'll bring you
[1:05:59] through can you say amen that's the only
[1:06:02] defense that you have against the
[1:06:07] enemy right come on now you believe
[1:06:13] it amen now he said to the serpent God
[1:06:17] said see this thing didn't just happen
[1:06:20] all at
[1:06:21] once I think it happened gradually I do
[1:06:25] too I think Satan just so
[1:06:28] Sly Bible says the serpent was
[1:06:31] crafty he's a little slick
[1:06:34] guy so just come hey Eve
[1:06:39] H hi beautiful day
[1:06:44] today what you been up to oh nothing
[1:06:47] just thinking about the
[1:06:49] word really yeah that's nice really nice
[1:06:55] yeah what does the word say oh God says
[1:06:58] we can't eat of any other tree but just
[1:07:00] this one tree oh really well that was
[1:07:02] nice that's really
[1:07:04] nice boy you could have all that dinner
[1:07:07] you can have all this other stuff too
[1:07:09] you know I mean but oh I mean I was just
[1:07:11] joking I was just joking yeah no no we
[1:07:14] can't God said so yeah I know see you
[1:07:17] later Eve that's right then walks away
[1:07:19] you
[1:07:21] know maybe comes up and grabs another
[1:07:23] you know
[1:07:24] something that's appetizing you know hey
[1:07:27] look and he starts winning her influence
[1:07:30] yes sir so starts winning her her
[1:07:35] friendship starts just talking
[1:07:38] slowly yeah the Lord is good isn't he
[1:07:41] yeah he is he's really good yeah I bet
[1:07:43] he is yeah you have good service last
[1:07:46] night oh yeah we met under the stars and
[1:07:49] oh it's just so nice just beautiful oh
[1:07:52] good where's that ad a
[1:07:55] man um ah he's he you know you know what
[1:07:59] husbands you know I
[1:08:04] don't and he just begin to talk and just
[1:08:07] talk a little bit at a time
[1:08:10] and but he's sewing things in her mind
[1:08:13] all along just a little negative you
[1:08:16] really think God really meant
[1:08:19] that yeah I I really do
[1:08:22] oh I mean
[1:08:24] you
[1:08:25] know come on Eve God is
[1:08:29] good BR says I hear that all the time
[1:08:31] getting tired of hearing it that's
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:36] right God's a good
[1:08:39] God he is a good God but he's a god of
[1:08:42] judgment right but what was he doing he
[1:08:44] was breaking down her defense slowly
[1:08:47] breaking it down so
[1:08:49] subtle right and then he threw the punch
[1:08:53] now the the thing was brother Brown said
[1:08:55] he wanted fairly because she was lusting
[1:08:57] after knowledge she was in her heart
[1:08:59] looking for something else now Church
[1:09:03] brother Brown said he how how did he put
[1:09:05] that sufficiently
[1:09:08] satisfied we've need to be sufficiently
[1:09:11] I think that's how you put it
[1:09:12] sufficiently satisfied I wonder if we
[1:09:15] are sufficiently satisfied with the
[1:09:18] word can you say man how many
[1:09:20] sufficiently satisfied we don't need
[1:09:23] another Messenger to come I I'm just it
[1:09:26] it blows my mind how when when a man
[1:09:29] rises up as a prophet or some little
[1:09:30] gift people
[1:09:32] just they're not sufficiently satisfied
[1:09:35] with what God has Vindicated to be
[1:09:38] right can you say Amen it's like they
[1:09:41] need something else or you got these you
[1:09:43] know the the these guys that are
[1:09:44] anointed of the same devil that talk to
[1:09:46] Eve where where they well brother BR was
[1:09:48] a prophet oh yes he was a prophet he was
[1:09:51] so anointed but not everything he said
[1:09:53] was of God and and now you have to check
[1:09:55] with what he said in the words you know
[1:09:58] and and and then there it go they go on
[1:10:00] the Spiel and and this and that and they
[1:10:02] got your mind so good just so uh uh uh
[1:10:06] uh uh messed up and all that I say stay
[1:10:08] away from all that
[1:10:10] nonsense can you say amen that's why I
[1:10:13] hit it so hard when they when they say
[1:10:15] brother Brandon miss it I don't want to
[1:10:17] hear another word they
[1:10:19] said they ain't going to get behind this
[1:10:21] Pulpit I ain't going to turn the I ain't
[1:10:23] going to let my ears be garbage can
[1:10:25] because that's all they're doing is
[1:10:27] spewing out garbage this word I was to
[1:10:30] hide
[1:10:33] behind and you say Amen see you have no
[1:10:36] other
[1:10:37] defense see so Eve gradually she said it
[1:10:41] God said God said God said but somehow
[1:10:44] Satan was finally able to get her to
[1:10:47] stop and to
[1:10:51] listen and not question
[1:10:54] it can you say Amen see but she
[1:10:58] shouldn't have stopped She that that's
[1:11:00] the problem she shouldn't have stopped
[1:11:01] but it was appealing to her brother
[1:11:03] Brandon preached on the on the message
[1:11:05] enticing Spirits enticing Spirits
[1:11:11] Church you know why because Satan always
[1:11:13] appeals to our flesh and our emotions he
[1:11:17] appeals the things that appeals to
[1:11:21] us right yes sir if any of you are a
[1:11:25] good
[1:11:26] fisherman you ain't going to go out
[1:11:30] there
[1:11:32] and hook a rock to your fishing pole at
[1:11:36] the end of your line somehow tie it in
[1:11:38] there and
[1:11:41] woohoo right you ain't going to get a
[1:11:44] big old T-Bone St I don't know if fish
[1:11:46] eat that or not I don't think so you
[1:11:48] ain't going to get a big old T-Bone
[1:11:50] stank and hook it up you know just to
[1:11:52] catch a little perk
[1:11:56] you'll catch brother
[1:12:03] will but you're going to use things that
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:07] attractive right right that's the only
[1:12:10] way to
[1:12:12] communicate you can't go here a little
[1:12:16] fishy he don't understand that language
[1:12:19] so you got to do something to catch him
[1:12:23] and sat knows how to
[1:12:25] catch hello he's doing it all around
[1:12:28] that's right he's catching preachers
[1:12:30] he's catching the deacons he's catching
[1:12:33] the the the the the the musicians he's
[1:12:37] catching the leoty he's catching them
[1:12:39] all the
[1:12:41] time
[1:12:43] hello amen see because he knows what is
[1:12:48] appealing on now can you say amen and he
[1:12:52] always appeals to our flesh and our
[1:12:54] emotions see so she began to reason with
[1:12:58] what Satan was saying to her and she
[1:13:02] become
[1:13:03] disarmed right that's right and Satan
[1:13:06] was able to punch a hole the prophet
[1:13:08] said through Eve's mind see and and what
[1:13:10] did that do it brought death to the
[1:13:12] whole human race it'll bring death to
[1:13:15] the family it'll bring death to the
[1:13:17] church it'll bring Death to Your Soul
[1:13:20] it'll bring death to everything it'll
[1:13:22] stop the of God it'll stop the the
[1:13:25] Revival flowing it'll stop the joy the
[1:13:28] peace everything about Christianity
[1:13:30] should be something that is living
[1:13:33] constantly
[1:13:35] flowing can you say amen and Satan is
[1:13:38] wanting to cut the lifeline off from
[1:13:43] us you say Amen well then what happens
[1:13:47] fear grip man sin and perversion grip
[1:13:50] man man becomes subject to all kinds of
[1:13:52] disease dises sickness sin
[1:13:56] habits corruption complexes ain't that
[1:14:00] right why because he finally disarmed
[1:14:03] her and be a was able to punch a hole
[1:14:06] amen through her mind amen by her
[1:14:09] reasoning and all that but then he tried
[1:14:11] to do that with
[1:14:12] Jesus and he couldn't do it every time
[1:14:15] he turned around and he quoted
[1:14:17] scriptures he used the scripture just
[1:14:19] like he did with
[1:14:20] Eve but Jesus wouldn't allow him to talk
[1:14:25] Jesus wouldn't listen to what he was
[1:14:28] saying Jesus wouldn't give him an a
[1:14:30] timer day but he would he would repeat
[1:14:33] scripture back but it is
[1:14:35] written one thing about Jesus he knew
[1:14:38] how to place the
[1:14:39] promises can you say amen he knew how to
[1:14:43] place them promises he knew amen what to
[1:14:46] do oh yes sir Jesus kept saying it is
[1:14:49] written it is written it is written and
[1:14:52] we're so glad that he was a able to do
[1:14:53] that I'm I'm glad that he was able to do
[1:14:55] that aren't you glad that he was able to
[1:14:57] do that amen you know why he done that
[1:14:59] Amen to show the prophet that he had
[1:15:01] power upon power upon power but he not
[1:15:03] used the one power to defeat the Devil
[1:15:05] with he used the word to show that the
[1:15:08] weakest Christian can defeat Satan
[1:15:10] anytime anywhere under any situation the
[1:15:14] word is that powerful and it's put into
[1:15:17] your hands it's put into your hands it's
[1:15:20] put into your hands you well I don't
[1:15:22] know how to pray eloquent words you
[1:15:24] don't have to pray eloquent words the
[1:15:26] word is good enough just speak the
[1:15:32] word yes
[1:15:35] Hallelujah so Jesus wasn't the only one
[1:15:38] he didn't want to be the only one
[1:15:40] defeating the
[1:15:42] devil so he does this he uses the word
[1:15:45] to show that anyone can do it any any
[1:15:47] believer the weakest of
[1:15:50] Believers can you say Amen but then he
[1:15:53] died to bring us back to our rightful
[1:15:56] place prise the Lord can you say amen I
[1:15:59] I hope you understand that everything
[1:16:01] that God has been trying to do is for
[1:16:04] you bring it send in the prophet I mean
[1:16:07] well first of all send in his son dying
[1:16:09] on the cross it was not just normal
[1:16:11] blood it was not human blood it was the
[1:16:14] blood of God that saved you it was not a
[1:16:17] national nationality blood a Jew or
[1:16:20] Gentile it was God God
[1:16:23] can you say Amen that was the only blood
[1:16:25] that could loose you that was the only
[1:16:27] blood amen by that blood he could
[1:16:29] declare you Innocent by that blood he
[1:16:31] could declare you justified by that
[1:16:34] blood he can secure you amen till the
[1:16:37] day amen of your

[1:16:44] blood that's right then he can bring
[1:16:46] that his Spirit down inside of
[1:16:48] you amen yes sir now I I know I know
[1:16:53] know you know these things and I pray
[1:16:54] it's a help to you but I I tell you what
[1:16:58] let's not act like Sinners that's right
[1:17:01] let let's not have the mentality of
[1:17:04] Sinners let's not have this mentality
[1:17:06] that God's forsaken us you say but I
[1:17:09] feel forsaken then don't carry that
[1:17:13] mentality come on Church feelings are
[1:17:16] going to come and go sensation going to
[1:17:19] come and go trials going to come and go
[1:17:23] go seasons in your life is going to come
[1:17:25] and go Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:17:28] but my word will never
[1:17:31] pass that's right amen he died to bring
[1:17:35] us back to our rightful place place of
[1:17:38] Fellowship a place of authority yes sir
[1:17:42] a place of control to where we
[1:17:46] control and you say Amen a place of of
[1:17:51] to where that we can stand without
[1:17:53] condemnation amen there's no sense in us
[1:17:56] being condemned there's no sense in us
[1:17:58] coming to church under condemnation well
[1:18:01] you say well how do I do that get under
[1:18:03] the blood confess your sins when your
[1:18:06] sins are confessed there's no
[1:18:10] condemnation amen can you say
[1:18:15] Amen well it's
[1:18:19] truth that's right and you confess your
[1:18:23] sins that that is the biggest thing that
[1:18:26] that's the greatest power that breaks
[1:18:29] the devil's back and authority over your
[1:18:31] life is when you confess your
[1:18:38] sins it's true come on a lot of
[1:18:40] Christians are
[1:18:42] bound because they refuse to confess
[1:18:44] their sins and it can be the simplest
[1:18:48] things brother BR said we should repent
[1:18:50] every day every day uh to God if you've
[1:18:53] done your brother wrong and your heart's
[1:18:56] con condemning you get it right make it
[1:18:59] right why why it frees
[1:19:04] you it sets you free from
[1:19:09] it can you say
[1:19:11] Amen why because you want to come back
[1:19:14] to your rightful
[1:19:16] place the Lord of control of
[1:19:20] authority amen yes you can't rightfully
[1:19:24] claim the word your promises if your
[1:19:26] heart's condemning you brother BR said
[1:19:29] if your heart's condemning you you know
[1:19:30] what it does it puts you right back in
[1:19:31] the place of a sinner well what do you
[1:19:34] mean by that am I a sinner or am I a
[1:19:36] saint no you can be a saint but but
[1:19:38] you're weak you're powerless if you're
[1:19:41] holding on to sin unconfessed sins and
[1:19:45] your heart is condemning you you ain't
[1:19:48] got any
[1:19:50] power no matter what promises are there
[1:19:54] you're just like the sinner that just
[1:19:55] ain't you're out of
[1:19:58] relationship because your heart condemns
[1:20:00] you but the moment you put that under
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:03] blood
[1:20:05] Hallelujah can you say Amen put it under
[1:20:09] the blood yes sir is that what I think
[1:20:12] brother brandom even encouraged the
[1:20:14] people if you're in line and you got sin
[1:20:16] something just step out of the line for
[1:20:18] a minute confess
[1:20:20] it there you are you don't have to be a
[1:20:22] Catholic beat yourself up you don't have
[1:20:24] to do all these you know these whatever
[1:20:27] penances and all these things just
[1:20:29] confess it and what is it it's over
[1:20:32] right then it's
[1:20:34] over then you're right back in line
[1:20:36] again you're back into Fellowship again
[1:20:39] it's so easy right right
[1:20:44] wonderful
[1:20:45] so now we we find that Jesus wasn't just
[1:20:50] placed behind the word but he was the
[1:20:52] the word Lord amen see and so he he
[1:20:57] tried uh uh uh to get Jesus but then
[1:21:02] Jesus defeated the devil on every turn
[1:21:04] defeated the Devil by the word of God
[1:21:07] then he come and he redeemed us redeemed
[1:21:11] us can you say Amen our soul that he
[1:21:14] could live in us and have the
[1:21:16] preeminence in US amen come on now I
[1:21:21] thank God for that right
[1:21:23] amen that God would literally take
[1:21:26] preeminence now that's a blessing when
[1:21:28] God has preeminence over
[1:21:30] you cuz either God will have preeminence
[1:21:33] or the devil will
[1:21:35] amen yes sir and I don't know about you
[1:21:37] but I've just been tired of being a
[1:21:39] slave to the
[1:21:41] devil he you right they say you know how
[1:21:45] they said that he he'll get you to you
[1:21:47] know rob the bank then he'll call the
[1:21:49] law on
[1:21:51] you he's all the time getting you do
[1:21:53] something then he get you caught he's
[1:21:55] sitting
[1:21:56] there that was
[1:21:58] funny you're the one that's all scarred
[1:22:01] and life's all broken
[1:22:04] up all these ain't that
[1:22:07] right but when God come to have
[1:22:09] preeminence in you that means Satan
[1:22:11] cannot touch you Satan has no dominion
[1:22:15] over you
[1:22:16] anymore can you say Amen so then then He
[1:22:20] restored the word to us Amen in this
[1:22:24] last day now Satan Satan could get to
[1:22:28] Eve but he wasn't able to get to
[1:22:31] Adam ain't that right he couldn't touch
[1:22:34] Adam so he went around to Eve why
[1:22:37] because Eve was a byproduct of
[1:22:39] Adam that's what she was she's just a
[1:22:42] byproduct right she was taken from that
[1:22:44] which had been created and she was the
[1:22:47] one who doubted the word of God she was
[1:22:51] the one that started question she she
[1:22:52] was the one who was deceived ain't that
[1:22:55] right yes sir see but we as the bride of
[1:22:58] Christ are not a byproduct of
[1:23:02] Adam Lord we are a byproduct of
[1:23:07] christes ain't that right yes sir and
[1:23:11] what is Christ he's the word so the
[1:23:14] prophet said then if he was the word
[1:23:17] what must the bride be it's got to be
[1:23:20] the original word Living God God in the
[1:23:23] word so what are you you are a product
[1:23:27] of the original everybody say the
[1:23:30] original the original
[1:23:33] word that means it goes all the way back
[1:23:36] way before creation into the mind of
[1:23:40] God when God thought of
[1:23:43] you Jesus being the word he was the
[1:23:46] thought of God he was the lamb slain
[1:23:49] before the foundation of the world in
[1:23:51] God's mind he was predestinated to be
[1:23:54] the lamb in God's mind he was
[1:23:56] predestinated to be what he was in God's
[1:23:59] mind and now he becomes the word every
[1:24:02] Prophet amen spoke of
[1:24:05] him can you say Amen now here we are a
[1:24:09] word bride not a denominational
[1:24:14] bride a word
[1:24:16] bride amen a word bride now that's not a
[1:24:19] phrase that is a reality it's not just a
[1:24:23] phrase to to get us pumped up it's a
[1:24:27] reality we can literally be identified
[1:24:30] as the word
[1:24:33] bride you believe that and the church
[1:24:36] does not make you bride of Christ
[1:24:39] denominations can't make you bride of
[1:24:43] Christ amen the word makes
[1:24:46] you can you say that with me the word
[1:24:49] makes me bride of Christ the word word
[1:24:52] makes me bride of Christ I am part of
[1:24:55] the word I came from the word I am the
[1:24:58] word yes sir then my origin comes from
[1:25:02] the
[1:25:02] word and what is the word a thought
[1:25:06] expressed ain't that right so now the
[1:25:09] Bible tells us that the word came to the
[1:25:11] prophets second Peter 1:21 for the
[1:25:14] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:25:16] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[1:25:19] they were moved by the Holy Ghost so
[1:25:22] they didn't come up with words and it
[1:25:25] wasn't of their imagination and then
[1:25:27] they just speak it or write it down and
[1:25:29] and and then we got just a whole bunch
[1:25:31] of man is the one that makes this a
[1:25:35] mess man makes it a mess their own ideas
[1:25:39] their own interpretation but God never
[1:25:41] made a mess out of it it comes from
[1:25:45] him God would never trust man to write
[1:25:49] something uh and then put make us put
[1:25:52] our uh uh whole life upon it come on God
[1:25:57] would make it happen God would come to
[1:26:00] them God would move upon men and when
[1:26:04] they spoke it would be thus sayth the
[1:26:06] Lord because it wasn't man speaking it
[1:26:09] was God
[1:26:11] speaking ain't that right see the word
[1:26:14] came to them now notice what the prophet
[1:26:15] says the prophet writer must be in
[1:26:18] constant fellowship with the author he
[1:26:20] must live constantly in the presence of
[1:26:22] of the author to know what the book is
[1:26:23] going to be the prophet writer he had
[1:26:26] the pen ready anytime constant
[1:26:28] fellowship with the author which God
[1:26:30] which was God to strike down whatever he
[1:26:33] said put down showed what kind of a life
[1:26:36] he a separated life from all of his
[1:26:38] Brethren a prophet was and now that's
[1:26:40] why the prophet had his mind set his
[1:26:44] mind set constantly on what God Said not
[1:26:48] what man thought not what the age
[1:26:50] thought not what the church thought
[1:26:52] thought or what the kingdom thought but
[1:26:54] what God thought he only expressed God's
[1:26:58] thoughts to word because a word is a
[1:27:00] thought when it's expressed he said you
[1:27:02] got it now the word is a thought
[1:27:04] expressed so the prophet was waiting for
[1:27:07] God's thoughts and when God revealed his
[1:27:09] thoughts to him he expressed it in word
[1:27:12] see thus sayi the Lord see not thus
[1:27:15] sayith I the prophet but thus sayith the
[1:27:18] Lord that's why they defi Kings kingdoms
[1:27:21] and church ages see which to do so in
[1:27:24] their days was a death penalty you walk
[1:27:26] up in the face of King and tell him thus
[1:27:28] said the Lord such and such is going to
[1:27:30] happen You' have your head chopped off
[1:27:32] see the church would put you to death
[1:27:34] right now for doing it see but these
[1:27:36] prophets were bold why they were moved
[1:27:40] by the Holy Ghost see and they see
[1:27:43] that's why they become bold they wrote
[1:27:46] the infallible word of
[1:27:48] God didn't put their own interpretation
[1:27:51] to it their own thoughts to it or my own
[1:27:54] thoughts your own
[1:27:56] thoughts they just Express God's
[1:28:00] thoughts ain't that right caught God's
[1:28:03] thoughts and expressed it into word
[1:28:04] wrote it down in in word form amen you
[1:28:08] know why this this Bible speaks of you
[1:28:11] because it's nothing but God's
[1:28:13] thoughts this Bible speaks of you that's
[1:28:17] why you can identify with it not you're
[1:28:19] treated as a western book not treated a
[1:28:22] a as a mystery book not not treat as any
[1:28:25] other book you can literally identify
[1:28:28] with this
[1:28:34] book am the think of it now even young
[1:28:38] boys I I did it and I watched my all my
[1:28:42] boys do it read them a book read them a
[1:28:45] western book or they'll see
[1:28:47] something me whether it's Western
[1:28:49] whether it's Roman soldiers whether it's
[1:28:52] whatever it
[1:28:54] is they'll get right back they'll get
[1:28:57] right up and and you know they'll go get
[1:29:01] their guns

[1:29:05] and in the toy box finding that cowboy
[1:29:08] hat they want to find them boots right
[1:29:11] sometimes we'll have great services and
[1:29:13] you know he doesn't do it now a lot but

[1:30:24] Jungle which was the living
[1:30:30] room why you get inspired want to be
[1:30:34] identified with something the
[1:30:38] church you can be
[1:30:41] identified something that seems so
[1:30:43] impossible but God has allowed you to be
[1:30:46] identified because it isn't a storytale
[1:30:49] this isn't a fairy tale this this is
[1:30:52] actually reality God wrote about you he
[1:30:55] said this is what you're going to be he
[1:30:57] already prophesied he already saw you
[1:31:00] being that way and there's something
[1:31:02] within us that wants to be that
[1:31:04] [Applause]
[1:31:07] way amen that's the truth amen and you
[1:31:10] never have to come
[1:31:12] back you know in the time of playing
[1:31:16] Cowboys and Indians was over we just put
[1:31:18] our guns up for next
[1:31:20] time
[1:31:22] time of playing Superman was over we
[1:31:25] just put everything up for the next time
[1:31:27] we moved on you ain't moving on from
[1:31:31] this this was God's thoughts concerning
[1:31:35] you as The Virtuous sinless bride of
[1:31:39] Christ can you say Amen there is going
[1:31:42] to be a millennium there is going to be
[1:31:45] a body change and you're coming to that
[1:31:48] it's going to happen and you'll never
[1:31:50] take on a VI body again you'll never
[1:31:53] amen have another mind battle you'll
[1:31:55] never amen have another Temptation
[1:31:58] another failure and making all the
[1:32:00] mistakes you'll never have that because
[1:32:02] this is what God thought of you and this
[1:32:05] is what you're
[1:32:07] becoming this ain't pretending amen this
[1:32:11] is
[1:32:12] real can you say Amen notice before
[1:32:17] there was ever a speck of
[1:32:19] Stardust before God was God God is an
[1:32:22] object of adoration and no one was there
[1:32:25] to worship him so he was at that time
[1:32:28] only potentially God and he was known
[1:32:32] only as eternal spirit notice the bride
[1:32:35] everybody say the bride bride can you
[1:32:37] say it that's me that's
[1:32:40] me the bride was already in his
[1:32:45] mind yes she was she was existing in his
[1:32:50] thoughts and what about not those
[1:32:52] thoughts of God they are Eternal are
[1:32:55] they
[1:32:56] not the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[1:32:59] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:33:02] if you can see this you will see many
[1:33:05] things you will see that you can never
[1:33:08] be defeated you'll see that you can
[1:33:10] never be a sinner again you'll see that
[1:33:13] Satan can never take you out you'll see
[1:33:16] many things if you can see that God's
[1:33:18] thoughts are eternal
[1:33:23] God that's right yes sir God is
[1:33:26] unchangeable in both Essence and
[1:33:28] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:33:30] that already God is infinite in his
[1:33:32] ability so therefore he as God must be
[1:33:35] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:33:38] is not now learning nor is he taking
[1:33:41] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:33:44] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[1:33:47] can add to his knowledge then he is not
[1:33:49] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:33:51] sometime he will be but that is not
[1:33:55] scriptural he is
[1:33:58] omniscient can you say Amen so that mean
[1:34:01] he has never had a new thought about
[1:34:04] anything because all his thoughts he has
[1:34:07] always had and always will have and
[1:34:10] knows the end from the beginning because
[1:34:12] he is God thus the thoughts of God are
[1:34:15] Eternal and they are real they are not
[1:34:18] simply like a man with a blueprint that
[1:34:21] is drawn up which one day will be
[1:34:25] translated into substance and form
[1:34:27] you've got the blueprint you've got a
[1:34:29] house drawed up right there and then one
[1:34:31] day it will be manifested no that's not
[1:34:34] the way God's thoughts are see he says
[1:34:36] but they are already everybody say they
[1:34:39] are already they are already real and
[1:34:44] eternal and part of God to God you
[1:34:49] already are there
[1:34:52] that's the thoughts of God you will not
[1:34:55] one day be saved you already were saved
[1:34:58] you will know what you will not one day
[1:35:01] one day overcome you have already
[1:35:03] overcome you will not just one day amen
[1:35:06] arrive you've already arrived can you
[1:35:10] say Amen see you've already got a body
[1:35:12] that's waiting for you brother Bron said
[1:35:14] I saw you
[1:35:15] there if you really catch the mind of
[1:35:18] God and you have that mind of Christ
[1:35:20] you're only seeing yourself in
[1:35:24] Victory you see yourself there no wonder
[1:35:29] we can praise God no wonder we can
[1:35:31] Triumph amen and get shouts and joy in
[1:35:34] the middle of all the the things we go
[1:35:36] through because we see it's already
[1:35:46] done Eternal
[1:35:49] thoughts expressed into eternal
[1:35:53] words
[1:35:54] therefore there comes an eternal
[1:35:57] manifestation of the original thoughts
[1:35:59] now brother brandom he says this now the
[1:36:03] Hebrew prophets the two major thingses
[1:36:07] and practically from somewhere along in
[1:36:09] every chapter of the Bible from Genesis
[1:36:11] to Malachi you can find one of those
[1:36:14] subjects being dealt with all the way
[1:36:16] through the Bible the coming of the
[1:36:18] Messiah Christ Jesus and the anointing
[1:36:22] and sending forth of the church into all
[1:36:24] the world it's spoke of in symbols by
[1:36:27] animals and so forth and like great
[1:36:30] armies and so forth that Marches On runs
[1:36:32] over the walls and so forth of different
[1:36:35] uh like
[1:36:36] locusts and everything was in symbols
[1:36:38] and Parables and straight teachings and
[1:36:40] everything it comes down to those two
[1:36:43] subjects the
[1:36:45] Messiah and
[1:36:47] you Jesus Christ and his bride amen
[1:36:54] God's thoughts God's thoughts ain't
[1:36:59] complicated right God already had Jesus
[1:37:02] in his mind now how many believe Jesus
[1:37:04] come you believe he come you believe he
[1:37:06] was the lamb you believe he was a
[1:37:08] redeemer amen so God's thoughts he he
[1:37:11] manifested God's thoughts can you say
[1:37:14] man it was so sure no devil of Hell
[1:37:16] could stop
[1:37:18] it ain't that right Lions couldn't eat
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:22] fire couldn't stop it nothing nothing
[1:37:27] devil seed serpent seed come through all
[1:37:29] the lineage amen and all the generation
[1:37:31] could not stop him from coming he came
[1:37:34] exactly the way God said it because he
[1:37:36] was predestinated now it's your
[1:37:38] turn you're here by the grace of God
[1:37:42] there's been no demon been able to stop
[1:37:44] it there's been no trouble been able to
[1:37:46] stop it look at all your forefathers and
[1:37:48] your family tree and all the troubles
[1:37:50] and all the the things that could have
[1:37:52] happened and God wouldn't let it happen
[1:37:53] because you had to come and here you are
[1:37:58] today we ought to take hold amen so they
[1:38:01] wrote of you they wrote of you now
[1:38:03] notice and get ready close
[1:38:05] now brother Braham said this Bible is
[1:38:08] God's thoughts and Seed
[1:38:10] form that if received everybody say
[1:38:14] received if received into the human
[1:38:18] being and spoke spoke by the same
[1:38:22] thought that materialize the Bible it'll
[1:38:25] bring it to
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:38:28] pass ain't that right now think of
[1:38:31] that every thought is God's word and
[1:38:34] Seed form that if this word could be
[1:38:38] received into your heart and spoke by
[1:38:41] the same thought not your thought right
[1:38:45] not my thought not Church thought not
[1:38:49] World thought I don't care what thoughts
[1:38:51] no thought same thought yeah that wrote
[1:38:55] this Bible
[1:38:56] amen and we know it was the thought of
[1:39:00] God and it would be spoken it'll bring
[1:39:03] the thing to pass the Lord so then you
[1:39:07] must receive it we can preach about
[1:39:10] promises we can preach about it all year
[1:39:12] long and a thousand
[1:39:15] lifetimes you have to receive it
[1:39:18] amen and you have to speak it
[1:39:22] that's right Lord
[1:39:25] right receive it by
[1:39:30] inspiration which is the spirit of God
[1:39:33] and speak it by the same inspiration
[1:39:36] that the prophets had ain't that right
[1:39:39] see the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:39:42] them and caused them to speak and to
[1:39:46] write that same Spirit now comes upon
[1:39:49] you that's right
[1:39:52] right
[1:39:54] Lord the spirit of the Prophet is
[1:39:56] subject to the
[1:39:58] prophet right now we use that when a
[1:40:01] preacher is up here preaching and and
[1:40:03] and someone wanting to stand up and
[1:40:05] prophesy that Spirit you you understand
[1:40:07] what I'm saying but I we're going to
[1:40:08] take it I believe that if you have the
[1:40:11] Holy Ghost if I have the Holy Ghost if
[1:40:13] we have the Holy Ghost the spirit within
[1:40:16] us becomes subject to what this word
[1:40:19] says come on
[1:40:21] can you say Amen it'll testify what this
[1:40:24] word says the Bible says it'll lead and
[1:40:26] guide you into all truth so it ain't
[1:40:29] sitting there just up a prophet and he's
[1:40:31] speaking the thoughts of God thus say
[1:40:32] the Lord thus say the Lord thus say the
[1:40:34] Lord and then we have the Holy Ghost oh
[1:40:36] I don't know if we can make it I don't
[1:40:37] know I I just don't see Victory I I I
[1:40:39] don't know I just sometimes wonder if
[1:40:41] I'm ever going to ever going to come to
[1:40:43] and you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:40:45] understand what I'm saying this word
[1:40:47] says you've already
[1:40:49] overcome amen ain't that right and are
[1:40:52] we not required to bring every thought
[1:40:55] under subjection to the word of
[1:40:57] God well how are you going to do that
[1:40:59] not with your carnal mind not with how
[1:41:01] you feel and your your own self you'll
[1:41:04] do it by the very spirit that caus them
[1:41:06] to write they wrote it not even knowing
[1:41:10] what they wrote not understanding the
[1:41:13] things they wrote that it was the spirit
[1:41:16] of God in them now it's the spirit of
[1:41:18] God taking over your
[1:41:19] body call cusing you to speak things
[1:41:22] that you normally wouldn't do it causing
[1:41:24] you to believe in things that you
[1:41:26] normally wouldn't do it it's impossible
[1:41:28] for a man to to believe in things that
[1:41:31] is beyond
[1:41:32] him that we do
[1:41:35] anyways because we're looking to a
[1:41:38] word amen that's right that's
[1:41:42] good hallelujah amen
[1:41:45] true so the spirit that was upon the
[1:41:48] prophets now is in US causing us to
[1:41:51] receive the word and speaking it Romans
[1:41:54] 8:9 If any man have not the spirit of
[1:41:57] Christ he has none of
[1:41:59] his so you see we have to come under
[1:42:01] subjection to the spirit of Christ we
[1:42:03] began to take on his mind we began to
[1:42:06] think his thoughts I hope you
[1:42:08] understanding yeah God help us all got
[1:42:12] this old preacher right yeah got to get
[1:42:14] away from that negative
[1:42:16] thinking now I'm not talking about man
[1:42:18] you doing it in yourself no no no you
[1:42:21] can't go to enough positive
[1:42:23] classes to begin thinking
[1:42:30] positive got to come under control of
[1:42:32] the Holy Spirit where he takes over your
[1:42:35] mind and you begin to think God's
[1:42:38] thoughts you begin to speak God's words
[1:42:40] it's something that's totally Beyond you
[1:42:43] all you're doing is just believing it
[1:42:44] you're accepting it you're you're you're
[1:42:46] just taking it in for
[1:42:48] yourself right the Lord can you say
[1:42:52] Amen see so brother brandom he he he
[1:42:56] says now see there it is he is spirit
[1:42:59] and he is life that is exactly what the
[1:43:02] word is that's exactly what Jesus is he
[1:43:05] is the word notice now this is a prophet
[1:43:09] speaking to us so when a spirit born
[1:43:14] spirit filled man in
[1:43:17] faith word does you no good without
[1:43:20] faith
[1:43:21] right but when a Spirit-filled man a
[1:43:24] spirit born man in faith takes that word
[1:43:28] into his heart and places it up on his
[1:43:32] lips why that is the same as deity
[1:43:36] speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan
[1:43:41] cannot stand before that man cannot
[1:43:45] stand before that woman cannot be stand
[1:43:48] before that child because now he's
[1:43:51] placed the word on his lips and it's as
[1:43:55] deity speaking as the prophet said deity
[1:43:57] is not in heaven it's in
[1:44:02] you it's in
[1:44:04] you anointing your mind anointing your
[1:44:08] heart taking the very words that he
[1:44:10] spoke through the prophets now he's in
[1:44:12] you receiving them and you by faith
[1:44:16] receiving it now you're placing it upon
[1:44:18] on your lips right God said
[1:44:21] so God said so Hallelujah God said so
[1:44:26] amen amen that's right it's easy talk
[1:44:31] about Abraham and Sarah 25 long years he
[1:44:34] confessed it and it's easy to to to look
[1:44:37] at their
[1:44:39] stories say yeah they're are
[1:44:43] heroes but you realize they were only
[1:44:45] testifying of you to come they were the
[1:44:48] type here you are are am now it's your
[1:44:53] turn to speak
[1:44:54] it it's your turn to endure it's your
[1:44:58] turn to embrace the promises and claim
[1:45:00] them that's right amen can you say amen
[1:45:03] amen and as Abraham did not waver so
[1:45:06] must we not
[1:45:09] waver because he was only the
[1:45:12] shadow you are the
[1:45:19] substance the Lord is good to us is he
[1:45:23] not so we read this last Sunday I'll
[1:45:26] read it
[1:45:28] again your thoughts if they become
[1:45:30] expression if your thoughts if they
[1:45:33] become expression like God said let
[1:45:35] there be a world and and if you want to
[1:45:38] go listen to that tape it's it's
[1:45:41] actually a uh pretty
[1:45:44] short and and he's just talking he just
[1:45:47] come back from India but it's called
[1:45:49] India the the India report something to
[1:45:52] that effect the India report word made
[1:45:54] manifest or word made flesh but but you
[1:45:58] ought to go listen to it and he's just
[1:45:59] talking he's just taking his little time
[1:46:01] and he just a little short he's talking
[1:46:04] just gave about the India trip and all
[1:46:06] that now he's going to go into this and
[1:46:07] you're just like wow powerful
[1:46:11] amen he said see before God said let
[1:46:15] there be a world before it could be a
[1:46:16] word it had to be a thought so God in
[1:46:19] the creation created the world Red by
[1:46:21] his thought first then spoke it and the
[1:46:24] thought expressed became material see
[1:46:26] what I mean now if that same spirit that
[1:46:28] said let there be light and there was
[1:46:30] light said let there be trees and there
[1:46:32] was trees if that same mind that was in
[1:46:34] Christ be in you how much could it say
[1:46:37] let there be no cancer and it would be
[1:46:38] gone let the blind eyes be open and it
[1:46:41] would be so see it's your thought you
[1:46:45] said well that was Jesus but wait a
[1:46:47] minute he said have faith in God which
[1:46:49] we know have the faith of God Amen for
[1:46:52] verily verily I say to you if you shall
[1:46:54] say to this mountain be moved plucked up
[1:46:56] and cast into the sea and don't doubt in
[1:46:58] your heart but believe what what you say
[1:47:00] will come to pass you'll have whatsoever
[1:47:02] things I'll says is that right you shall
[1:47:04] have it not me you shall have it what
[1:47:07] power has been given to the church now
[1:47:09] you can express it by mental conception
[1:47:10] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:47:12] God that you see it before it happened
[1:47:15] and express it in word form that word
[1:47:18] takes a hold and becomes material a
[1:47:20] thought
[1:47:21] expressed see Oh my he said if your
[1:47:24] heart and your mind is so and in filled
[1:47:27] with the God's spirit until your
[1:47:28] thoughts become his thoughts when your
[1:47:30] mind and your leading and your guiding
[1:47:32] becomes a direct place or a direct
[1:47:34] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:47:36] moving your mortal being what kind of
[1:47:38] people should we be if the very Holy
[1:47:40] Spirit has you so embodied or empowered
[1:47:42] that you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:47:44] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:47:46] your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has
[1:47:48] you so built until your thoughts and
[1:47:50] your being is God's spirit expressing
[1:47:52] itself through you what kind of a church
[1:47:55] we would be so then what do we want we
[1:47:59] want God's spirit to express himself in
[1:48:03] US yes don't be afraid of the spirit of
[1:48:06] God Amen don't be afraid of the moving
[1:48:09] of
[1:48:10] God make yourself available for
[1:48:17] God so he says what kind of a Church
[1:48:20] would it be what kind of a people would
[1:48:21] it be this morning if this briam
[1:48:23] Tabernacle this morning was so filled
[1:48:25] with the presence of God why when you
[1:48:27] didn't even use your own mind didn't use
[1:48:28] your own thoughts didn't even have no
[1:48:30] alternative of your own but just to be
[1:48:32] led by the spirit and they that are the
[1:48:35] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[1:48:37] then when the human element goes out and
[1:48:39] the spirit of God FS that vacancy where
[1:48:41] you ENT yourself then will be when the
[1:48:43] church in its power of the resurrection
[1:48:44] of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps
[1:48:46] in his power in his thoughts in his
[1:48:48] being in his moving you see what I mean
[1:48:50] then your thoughts will become words and
[1:48:52] words will become material that's the
[1:48:55] church when the church in its power he
[1:48:57] said I believe it's on its road that
[1:48:59] when the church will be so wrapped up in
[1:49:01] Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away
[1:49:04] from theirselves that they don't see
[1:49:06] themselves they don't have no thoughts
[1:49:08] but to serve God their thoughts move on
[1:49:10] they refuse the things of the world they
[1:49:12] just move in the spirit live in the
[1:49:13] spirit move in the spirit walk in the
[1:49:14] spirit so fulfill the law of Christ in
[1:49:16] the love of Christ in the human heart
[1:49:18] moving in the Holy Ghost that great
[1:49:20] wonderful church will go forth with
[1:49:22] power and deity because deity everybody
[1:49:25] say deity will be revealed in human
[1:49:28] beings God doesn't want to just lay
[1:49:30] there hidden in you he wants to be
[1:49:33] revealed through you by the Holy Spirit
[1:49:36] bringing to pass the thought of their
[1:49:38] mind the Lord oh do you love him amen he
[1:49:42] said see our thoughts run different a
[1:49:44] lot of times we walk up and say how do
[1:49:46] you do brother and and you don't mean it
[1:49:48] in your heart a lot of times we say well
[1:49:50] I'm this and that I will do that you
[1:49:52] don't mean it in your heart see I I I
[1:49:55] don't mean it in my heart he says but
[1:49:57] when you can become so dead to the
[1:49:59] things of the world that Christ is first
[1:50:01] Christ is all then your entire makeup is
[1:50:05] of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50:07] he has full control that's when your
[1:50:10] thoughts will be clean your thoughts
[1:50:12] will be
[1:50:14] pure don't read things that are
[1:50:17] ungodly amen don't watch things that are
[1:50:19] ungodly
[1:50:21] don't listen to things that are
[1:50:23] ungodly keep our minds out of the
[1:50:27] gutter can you say amen
[1:50:30] amen and can I say it this way keep our
[1:50:33] minds away from
[1:50:35] carnal keep your mind focused upon the
[1:50:37] Lord amen I know we got to live I know
[1:50:41] we got to function we got all that but
[1:50:44] keep your mind before the Lord with in
[1:50:48] the Lord even even the s promise said I
[1:50:51] keep I what I set the Lord before me
[1:50:54] always
[1:50:56] always amen no matter what you do where
[1:50:59] you go what you look at set the Lord
[1:51:01] before you
[1:51:03] always can you say amen amen sometimes
[1:51:06] we get so involved in carnal things yes
[1:51:09] sir and and and I'm going to look at
[1:51:11] myself I'll just say it myself I I love
[1:51:14] to read I'm a big reader I can read book
[1:51:18] after book after book
[1:51:20] right and sometimes if I'm not
[1:51:23] careful I have dwelt on all of that that
[1:51:26] I have read amen and I've laid aside the
[1:51:29] important things of life amen we can get
[1:51:32] so busy to that we don't pray we can get
[1:51:35] so busy that we just forget about God we
[1:51:37] can get so wrapped up in our problem so
[1:51:39] wrapped up in situations so wrapped up
[1:51:41] in life that we literally forget God's
[1:51:47] promises can you say amen amen
[1:51:51] many people say well religion comes from
[1:51:53] your heart there's no mental uh uh
[1:51:56] faculties in that little being called
[1:51:58] heart you can't think with your heart
[1:52:00] the Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[1:52:02] heart so is he you can't think with your
[1:52:04] heart you can't he said because there's
[1:52:06] nothing mentally in there to think with
[1:52:09] he said but Jesus wasn't speaking of the
[1:52:11] physical being he was speaking of the
[1:52:13] supernatural
[1:52:15] being thank you Lord well do you love
[1:52:17] the
[1:52:18] Lord if the musicians will
[1:52:23] come we talked about last Sunday about
[1:52:26] us being
[1:52:27] channels and and for the word to flow
[1:52:31] through and and channel means a passage
[1:52:34] a place of passing or
[1:52:36] flowing that through which anything
[1:52:38] passes means a passing conveying
[1:52:43] transmitting God has called us to be
[1:52:45] channels for his word to flow
[1:52:48] through
[1:52:51] Mary for example was a channel for the
[1:52:54] word to be
[1:52:57] born when the angel told her well first
[1:53:01] of all before the angel of the Lord ever
[1:53:04] came to her brother brandom gives us a
[1:53:07] little
[1:53:09] insight that something quickened to her
[1:53:13] about Behold a virgin shall
[1:53:15] conceive it might have been the their
[1:53:17] their priest talking about it
[1:53:21] could have been something that just
[1:53:22] caught it but something caught and she
[1:53:25] was meditating on it
[1:53:28] meditating she had things to do but she
[1:53:30] kept meditating upon
[1:53:32] that and while she was
[1:53:36] meditating brother Brown said if you
[1:53:38] want Christ to show up meditate on
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] him so when the angel came to her and
[1:53:47] began to tell her that she was the
[1:53:49] virgin and that the Holy Ghost would
[1:53:51] overshadow her and all that notice how
[1:53:54] she was as the channel behold the
[1:53:57] handmade of the Lord be it unto me
[1:54:00] according to Thy word brother Ram said
[1:54:03] she never questioned it she never said
[1:54:06] well wait a minute that's a little bit
[1:54:08] too hard for me to understand she she
[1:54:11] knew she
[1:54:12] knew that this was a supernatural thing
[1:54:17] that was going on she knew it was the
[1:54:20] Lord telling her can you say
[1:54:23] amen and the prophet said see she
[1:54:26] believed something that had never
[1:54:29] happened
[1:54:30] before so she can never go back to
[1:54:33] scriptures and say oh that's right
[1:54:35] because this happened to so and so and
[1:54:37] this happened to so and so and this
[1:54:38] happened to so and so no she was
[1:54:41] believing something that had never
[1:54:43] happened
[1:54:45] before can you say amen amen and notice
[1:54:48] what the prophet said she didn't
[1:54:51] wait she didn't wait until she started
[1:54:54] seeing positive
[1:54:55] signs before she went out and start
[1:54:57] testifying of it she was a
[1:55:01] channel the word had come to her now
[1:55:04] what the angel was saying was a
[1:55:05] scriptural
[1:55:06] thing right because the angel of the
[1:55:09] Lord there's all kinds of angels Kenneth
[1:55:12] Kenneth Hagen saw an angel and I don't
[1:55:14] doubt it he says an angel came to him I
[1:55:16] give him the benefit of the
[1:55:18] doubt but when the angel of the Lord
[1:55:20] comes it'll always take you right back
[1:55:22] to the
[1:55:23] word can you say Amen everything don't
[1:55:26] just go around believe in everything
[1:55:28] that people say it'll always come right
[1:55:30] back to the to the word of God that's
[1:55:33] why anything this Prophet said it came
[1:55:35] right back to the word of God so here's
[1:55:37] an Angel and the word that has already
[1:55:40] been in her heart in her mind she's
[1:55:42] meditating on this word the angel now
[1:55:44] has come to confirm you're that one amen
[1:55:48] that virgin now see it opened it up to
[1:55:50] her she was the
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:55] Virgin cannot the Lord do that to us
[1:55:58] tonight she actually accepted the
[1:56:00] thoughts of God that was written down in
[1:56:02] word form seed form accepted it for her
[1:56:07] and said be it unto me according to Thy
[1:56:09] word then what does she do she starts
[1:56:12] testifying of it before it ever happened
[1:56:15] before any positive
[1:56:17] sign she starts going around bearing
[1:56:19] that reproach can you say Amen she
[1:56:22] testified of it because she knew it was
[1:56:23] going to happen she wasn't believing in
[1:56:26] something
[1:56:28] radical now the prophet said the mind of
[1:56:30] Christ leads us in the word but I like
[1:56:33] what this
[1:56:35] says brother brandham in talking of Mary
[1:56:37] says soon after she goes to another city
[1:56:41] where her cousin was
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:46] Elizabeth and to enjoy the fellowship
[1:56:50] and he said because God had overshadowed
[1:56:53] both of
[1:56:53] [Music]
[1:56:55] them so she's going to someone that had
[1:56:58] the
[1:56:59] same Supernatural thing not not
[1:57:05] that she conceived the way Mary did but
[1:57:09] Elizabeth couldn't have a
[1:57:12] child
[1:57:13] right thought of brother Shan and sister
[1:57:16] Bethany for 20 years or so
[1:57:20] something God's done
[1:57:23] something well Elizabeth and Zacharias
[1:57:26] was the same way they were actually old
[1:57:33] people that the angel told
[1:57:35] Mary says Something's Happened to
[1:57:37] Elizabeth she's going to have a child
[1:57:40] and Mary went to
[1:57:43] Elizabeth to have
[1:57:46] Fellowship brother BR say she couldn't
[1:57:48] go to the synagogues cuz they wouldn't
[1:57:49] have believed it that's right she
[1:57:52] couldn't go just to anybody cuz they
[1:57:53] wouldn't believe it so she went to
[1:57:56] someone that had an experience thank you
[1:57:58] Lord that could
[1:58:00] relate and they could have
[1:58:03] Fellowship can you say Amen
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:09] Fellowship I thought that was powerful
[1:58:13] because he said see she went to somebody
[1:58:16] that had an experience like she had and
[1:58:18] she went there to Fellowship so on her
[1:58:20] way she went to somebody that believed
[1:58:23] God was still just as great as he ever
[1:58:25] was and I say this in closing if you
[1:58:28] want to maintain Victory hang around
[1:58:31] people that have
[1:58:34] Victory if you're believing for your
[1:58:36] healing hang around people that believe

[1:58:49] going to do it don't hang around people
[1:58:52] that don't believe in the
[1:58:54] impossibilities that don't believe that
