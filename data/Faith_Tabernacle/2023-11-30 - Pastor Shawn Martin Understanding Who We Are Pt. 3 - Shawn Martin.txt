John 13 and3 Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself amen then if you'll turn to Proverbs the 4th chapter Proverbs chapter 4 and going to start at the fifth verse and it says get wisdom get understanding and forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting everybody say with all thy getting get understanding amen then if you'll turn with me to the book of Ephesians the the book of Ephesians 1 amen and um going to read the 16th verse through the 19th uh we'll start at the 15th wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of his the glory of his inheritance in the Saints amen you can have your seats this evening and um again I'm going to use the title um understanding who we are and I I realize that I have dealt with that the subject of understanding uh um at different times and and things but I believe it is important uh for us to understand and to have an understanding and um you know the lord gave brother brandham uh a little insight as to why some people don't receive their healing and brother Braham said it's because it's a lack of understanding and so I think maybe it's a lack of understanding that that keeps people from stepping in faith and claiming their god-given rights and we we talk about God creating the heaven and Earth and and he done that by faith he created the world by by faith and but not only did he desire a world not only did he desire the things that he created but he had an understanding he had an understanding that he could have whatever he desired and he understood who he was and and so the the Bible says that the world was void and without form and darkness was upon the face of the deep but because he understood that he had the ability to change the situation and the power then he had faith and therefore he he he moved by faith and spoke the creative word and overcame that which seemed impossible now we know as the prophet told us that faith is the sense and by it we have understanding uh uh and so God's understanding came by faith and Faith of course is a revelation that's the way Faith Comes the the the the super sense faith it comes by Revelation and by that we have understanding and so uh uh when when the Revelation strikes our soul then Faith arises and where there is Faith then then we have this understanding and no wonder the prophet told us to pray for revelation we we need Revelation in the natural we have five senses and and you know taste feel hear smell and sight and things and so uh and and and by these five senses then we can understand the world that we live in uh our sight helps us to understand the things we see our our sense of hearing helps us to understand the things uh uh the different sounds that we hear our our sense of touch helps us to understand the things that we feel and and so uh we're able to understand things by the by our our five senses of of the body and and these senses came automatically when we were born we didn't we didn't have to go get them it it just automatically happened and came came with it and so then then we find if you notice Jesus said in John 3:3 he said except a man be born again except a man have this new birth he cannot see the kingdom of God in other words he cannot understand the kingdom of God so this understanding that that we're talking about it it does not come by the natural birth it does not come automatically uh uh this uh so so it it takes a new birth to be able to see and brother Brown said to see means to understand amen and and so uh and and the understanding that we're talking about is a spiritual understanding it's nothing to do with the carnal understanding but but the the the the the the uh spiritual understanding and the faith that we're speaking of again is the six sense which brother brandham called the super sense ain't that right and so it it is not given to a man through a natural birth like the other senses brother random said God is not understood by knowledge he's understood by Faith by faith ain't that right and so it takes a new birth to have the six sense which is the superp sense Faith so don't try to understand God by your carnal understanding don't try to figure out the Bible or or the message uh uh through a a a carnal understanding uh it it is impossible uh to to understand by knowledge and and and so uh uh and this is why uh Proverbs 3 and 5 uh God tells us to not to lean on thine own understanding ain't that right amen so when he says get in thy and get understanding he's not talking about your own understanding there there's a part of knowledge and of understanding that comes with the natural birth but it's a carnal understanding ain't that right and and so uh uh Solomon the brother Bram says why would Solomon tell us these things why would he tell us not to lean on our own understanding he said because our modern understanding is usually the wisdom of man which is contrary to the word of God ain't that right see so the Bible says man in this age would ever be learning see knowledge amen but never coming to the knowledge of Truth the understanding of truth because the understanding that that we're talking about the eyes of our understanding is not coming from an intellectual knowledge of God or anything like that see our our understanding when it comes to our natural man uh uh that understanding comes from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil ain't that right amen and and and and I'm going to read this Genesis 2 and9 uh the Bible says out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil then you go in the six 16th verse and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest uh uh freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it see for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so they were not a they God never meant for them to live by that type of a knowledge that carnal knowledge he he meant for for the word to come to them and they would live by the word of God their understanding would not be by the tree of knowledge but it would come by the word of God and and and so uh um but we find that that the knowledge that comes from the Tree of knowledge does not come from God it actually comes from Satan uh his understanding ain't that right so so we find that he partook of that tree of knowledge and the prophet said Satan came to Eve with his own understanding see and projected something to her which wasn't to her real understanding of Goden amen see so he he he presented his own understanding amen that was different from what God's understanding was and and the prophet said see he did not establish her in the word of God he gave her something other than God's word and and that uh that that appealed uh uh to her reasoning it did not appeal to her faith it appealed to her reasoning ain't that right and so then then we know that her being a a free moral agent she had to make her choice between what God told her and what she understood about God and and what Satan was telling her and and what she understood about uh what Satan was saying and so in order for her to listen to God then she would have to believe in what he said and in order to listen to to to Satan and what he was telling her then she had to reason within herself amen and and which would be to lean on her own understanding see you can't lean on your own understanding and believe what God Said say uh uh uh you You When God says it you just have to believe it ain't that right but anytime we lean to our own understanding we're actually listening to something outside of God's word so she she leaned to her own understanding and began to reason what Satan was telling her that old serpent telling her and she listened to the devil's lie ain't that right now the prophet says and I'm going to get somewhere but the prophet said Satan wanted fairly because Eve lusted for knowledge she wasn't satisfied with what God was going to give her she wanted something better she was looking for knowledge see and so the understanding that she already had amen from God Amen it it wasn't good enough see and and it was actually the mind of God the word of God it was God's knowledge a man that God had given her amen but yet she wanted to think on her own see and so the prophet says when the man tries to reason and says it couldn't be done then that drives him away from God constantly all the time when he's trying to listen to his his own understanding he said see if you don't understand the Bible says a certain thing he said then just punctuate it with an amen can you say Amen if your understanding don't understand this Bible just say Amen to it if if you're understanding don't understand the message amen then just say Amen to it punctuate it with an amen and just leave it there can you say amen amen because your understanding of the word will never agree amen with the word of God a not not in your own understanding it takes a higher understanding and for that a man has to be born again can you say Amen so we we find today that the emphasis is is laid upon uh education and upon our own understanding of things we're living in a day of of learning a as the prophet said and and it's getting even into the church to where the intellectuals want to turn the house of God in into a a a more like a classroom uh uh such and and Paul Paul said here in 1 Corinthians 2 and 4 he says my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the power and of spirit that your faith everybody say my faith your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God then he goes down in the ninth verse but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit aren't you glad for the spirit of God God has revealed them to us by his spirit and and he says for the spirit of uh searcheth all things yeay the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of a man which is in him so so to understand the carnal things we have a carnal nature we have that the spirit of a man that helps us to understand the carnal things of life amen but but but the spirit of man can never understand amen the spiritual things of God ain't that right he said see so even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God but notice what he said we have not received or he says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God ain't that right so we are told to get understanding God wants us to get understanding now when when you you listening to the the message and things brother brandom it it it he's you know it's it's a lot of times he says you can't understand and have faith it's it's not by understanding it's by faith but what he's trying to tell us is that it's not your own understanding to where you reason the Promises of of God out and and you say well how can it be and I I just don't know and and I don't see it going to happen and I I I you understand what I'm saying if you're if you're trying to live the message amen and live the word and be a Christian by your own understanding it will always produce question marks than it does in absolute because the carnal mind can never understand the things of God ain't that right so now what a prophet said he says a genuine Born Again Son of God will only everybody say will only understand the things that are of God Amen he will only understand the things that are of God you know some people talk negative about Divine Healing and and miracles and and say well all these things are in the past see and and and and they say that because they don't understand the things of God Amen but a genuine believer he will never understand what they're trying to tell you amen say because a genuine True Believer will only understand the things of God many talk negative about God sending a prophet in this day there is so much negative about God's word for this day and and the message and and among so-called Christians and all of that but brother Bram says now a genuine born again Christian that will never stop in his ears he doesn't understand it at all so see when the negative comes about and the negative about the word and the negative about the promises and and and the negative even thoughts that come into our mind and and all of these things a true genuine believer lets that pass through and doesn't let it come in them because they don't understand that you understand what I'm saying a carnal believer doesn't understand the things of God doesn't understand the promises of God but a genuine True Believer doesn't understand the negative about the word of God doesn't understand the the negative about the message you understand what I'm saying two different types of understanding amen can you say amen and you cannot have the understanding of God's word to where you accept God's word and the message as the absolute until a man is truly born again now I don't understand you know what people are saying when they degrade this message that I just don't understand that they they may they don't understand when I say the message is the absolute they don't understand see amen they they you know I I don't understand it when people treat amen uh uh the things of God and what he has done in this day and they treat it lightly I don't understand that they don't understand why I'm so sold out in this message and they want to say well you're deity and you're this well see there's not an understanding between the two because one is is is is trying to understand by a carnal mind and another is trying to understand uh uh has got the understanding by the spirit of God see I don't understand why they want to call us Pentecostals amen using it in a degraded way amen when we shout and when we we we enjoy amen our freedom and get excited and happy you know brother brandom he goes on to say he says How could a man that believes in God and can read the Bible and see that he's the same yesterday today and forever will ever accept such a thing as that he says I don't understand it you understand what I'm saying I don't understand why people don't accept amen what God has done and had his picture taken and and and and and and these things in this day and and it doesn't excite them amen but here's so God is telling us in all that by getting get understanding can you say Amen get understanding amen see so believers do not lean to their own understanding amen which comes just by the carnal uh the the carnal nature spirit that that that we're born with now uh in in Psalms 119 1225 David prays I am thy servant give me understanding that I may know thy testimonies yes give me understanding so here's a man that is praying that God would give him the understanding I'm not going to take my own understanding God of this I want you to give me understanding that I may Know Thy word ain't that right on down in in verse 130 amen he said the entrance of Thy word giveth light it giveth understanding unto the simple amen so brother Brown says says it's got to be a revelation coming from God to understand it don't bypass Revelation can you say Amen see so then brother Bram tells us where this type of understanding comes from it it's down in your heart the understanding you understand from your heart and not your intellect reasoning ain't that right see so Paul speaks of of it here in in ephes iians 4:17 he says this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their own mind see leaning to their own understanding see intellects reasoning uh uh uh you know they're they're leaning to their own understanding and notice in the 18th verse having the understanding darkened amen being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart so their understanding is not there because of the blindness their heart is blind they there's there there's nothing there to see can you say Amen see so their understanding was darkened because their heart was blinded amen and their ignorance caus them to be alienated from the light of God Amen see so then then we could say that this understanding that we're talking about it can only come from the word of God Amen this is why we don't follow Creeds of man denominations and organizations and traditions and this is why we don't go to Bible school and and and and and try to get a a better understanding of the word of God Amen and of of the day that we're living in can you say amen amen because uh uh the understanding has to come from the word of God Amen so then what is the word of God and I I want you to listen now what is the word of God well the word of God is a mirror amen it's a mirror everything is a mirror ain't that right well that's what the Bible says a uh uh Paul there in 2 Corinthians 3:15 but we all everybody say we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord so it's a Looking Glass it's a mirror so when we're looking into the word of God we're looking what what happens when you look in the mirror do do do do do you see the elephant do do you see the giraffe do you do you see the monkey do you do you see sometimes you know uh I want to see something different than what I'm looking at but it's it's a reflection it's a mirror when you stand there you know uh uh sometimes you I tell the children you know when they were real young look in the mirror and see that monkey you know and so he look oh dad you know and but but it's a reflection of what you're looking at and so this word is a reflection can you say Amen so when we're really looking in the word then we're getting an understanding that you could not get from a denomination you could not get amen from a seminar you cannot get from some Creed or some book of a man's writing or a theologian and all of these things can you amen so now I looked at this word glass because because he says we're beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord and it says to show in a mirror to make to reflect to mirror see to look at oneself in the mirror can you sayen so you can see where our understanding now is beginning to take form amen that when we look into the word of God and we're seeing a mirror amen then we begin to understand ourselves as to who we are see to behold oneself in a mirror so then then when we're looking at the word we are not to get a historical understanding of what happened in the past right we're we're not to just to get an understanding of what is to happen in the future Amen brother Brandon and you all know it but he says man is forever praising God for what he did do looking for what he will be and ignoring what he's doing right now ain't that right but if you're really looking in the mirror it gives you an understanding of your day and age yes sir brother brandom talked about brother and sister Moore writing their paper and he's telling the people constantly to fast and to pray fast and pray and and brother Bram says see they say well we're going to have a great breaking of the day there is a great thing going to happen all of you pray pray pray we're not too late yet and brother brand says why do they do that because they're wanting a Great Awakening they're crying see they're believing for a Great Awakening but see what what they didn't know what they were praying for was already happening right right there in their midst ain't that right and what was it brother Bram said they had recognize the Awakening of the Bride the bride had been awakened right in before them and they did not understand that and so they're still looking for something to happen amen because they weren't really looking in the mirror amen of and seeing the day and age that they they we were living in ain't that right so they didn't recognize or understand what had been done and they were looking for it off in the future future but notice if if there's anybody in this age that is to be compared if we are going to be compared to anybody you know who it's going to be right Jesus Christ ain't that right because we're supposed to have the same ministry as he has amen we are to be have the same character as as he did we are to have the same re re uh resemblance as he has amen we are the people when Jesus said father make them one even as we and you and I are one we are that people amen are to make that prayer fulfilled can you can you say amen amen see so then then we can look at Jesus for a moment did you realize that Jesus saw himself in the word of God on he looked in the mirror of the word and he saw himself in every chapter Hallelujah sure he knew what happened in the past he had under he had an understanding of the past he knew he understood what was going to happen in the future ain't that right amen but but notice he saw himself in the past for he said you know he saw himself in the prophets for brother BR said it was Christ in the prophets ain't that right and so he saw himself in the past and and and the prophecies that were given amen by the prophets he saw himself there he saw himself in the songs that were sung in the Old Testament he saw himself you know in the types and shadows he had an understanding that he was the one they were talking about they were singing about they were writing about it was an understanding that only he had amen ain't that right so he didn't know just what would take place you know uh uh didn't just know what would take place in the future but he saw himself in the future he knew he would rise from the from from from the grave ain't that right he knew knew that that he would not only be with man but he would be in man amen he knew that that that there would be a day that he would be revealed again as son of man he knew that he knew a future he had understanding another future but he saw himself in the future have you ever just thought of that bible talks of the Millennium that's great to have that understanding but when you really look at do you have an understanding that you're the one that's going to be there yeah come on can you say Amen so he understood the past he understood the future he saw himself in the past he saw himself in the future amen but most importantly he saw himself in the day and understood who he was in that day that he was living can you say amen he understood that he was the promised Messiah for that present day brother Bri said he had faith in God Amen who who made him the uh who who made him the word see he was God the word and they was in him and that gave him Faith because he understood his position and you say man we talk about rapturing faith you know what that's happening is we're understanding our position amen amen this this ain't just the faith of the Centurion this isn't just the faith of a Jew amen uh Jas and Gentile and these things this is the very Faith of Christ amen of God can you sayen and that give him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture said that's what he was he looked in the mirror he looked into something that was an absolute amen can you say Amen yes sir amen see and so he says and here every scripture tied in to prove Pro that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was everybody say he understood what he was he understood his position hello church he understood his position not just going to church but there's got to be an understanding to this amen not just saying oh bride bride bride bride bride bride you know bride's Revival understanding Who You Are now who was it that couldn't understand the people around him couldn't understand who he was right so John 10:33 notice now the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy because thou being a man makest thyself god well his understanding brought him to these confessions have you ever just thought of how your confession you know he's the high priest of your confession profession he can't do anything for you until you confess it first church how we need an understanding of who we are amen now he was so sure of who he was because he understood his position so there was no doubt there was no questions there was no no he loves me he loves me not he loves me he loves me not I'm going you know I'm saved I'm not saved I'm saved I don't know if I'm saved I'm going in a Rapture who who knows anybody guesses no no no understanding your position and staying there praise God ain't that right see so so they're upset they didn't understand him and they're going to Stone him for blasphemy for him being a man so they say they say makest thou thyself God but see he was the word and the Word was God right isn't that what brother Bram kept telling us he was the word and the word is God John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God 14th verse and the Word was made flesh ain't that right well then Jesus tells them said well the prophets were God he said the scriptures called them Gods to whom the word of the Lord came to the word of God comes to a prophet ain't that right so then notice what he does he does not back down from this he doesn't cower down say well maybe you're right I'm sorry I shouldn't have gone that far I shouldn't have gotten so bold I I you know I shouldn't have declared myself to who I really think I am I don't know and and so all of a sudden he gets all twisted up in his mind all that notice how the challenge he tells them search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me he's looking in the word and he's seeing himself in the word amen now you can't change it you could not make him doubt who he was he understood I hope it was all right so then he challenged them to look and see him look in the scriptures and see me but they looking without understanding ain't that right the Greeks wanted to see Jesus and they failed to see him because he was clothed in his human Temple brother Braham said it was the human flesh that blinded them and he says now notice how how he brings that now from from Jesus now to the day of his day a Critic a few years ago a few days ago said to me down in Tucson he said you know some people make you a nut and others make you a God I said well that kind of runs all right I know he was trying to criticize me he saidwell people think you're a God well I said I I I know the people didn't do that but I know he didn't understand it he didn't understand the ministry he didn't understand what was really happening see but brother brandham did are you with me now brother brandham did and so he says see he didn't understand it because he was on the other side of the skin right think of that now only you as the body of Christ in this day can really have the understanding amen people on the other side of the skin can't understand right true he says see I know he didn't get it he didn't know it and and so I said that's not too far from the word of God is it see and he said he says just let him know that we wasn't lost we know where we're standing we know what kind of sails we had set and what kind of wind was blowing it see we know what our thread was we know what our nut was we know how we're standing why because he understood his position amen amen ain't that right well what about you brother Ram's done fulfilled his time we're not looking for him to come back it's the the paton's in your hands what where are we at what what about Revelations 8 and9 where the Bible the prophet said John represented the bride and after the the seventh angel had sounded the lamb had come with the book the seventh angel sounded then John was told to go to the angel and get the book and eat the book are you with me now see so then what about us is there is there scripture for us well brother Bram says the word is in the bride yes amen sir the word is in the bride she has thus say the Lord can you say [Applause] Amen John said the spirit and the bride say come brother Bram said what the authenticated Prophet says from God the bride will say see the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will already have been said in the word and they are saying it now can you say amen amen not only just the preachers but all of us why because brother Bram said oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices what are we we are lived voices amen Living Voices written Epistles read and known of all men can you say Amen brother Bram said see that's the Thunder of God thundering out and sweetness Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish so see Jesus saw himself amen he was the word made flesh and he saw himself brother Braham said see now remember they the disciples had the word and the Word was flesh then see and the word told them I give you power I give you power they had the power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them they didn't have the understanding amen he said see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here see how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself he relied up on what he was praise the Lord he relied in knowing that he was the word amen so brother brandom in praying said father we we ask for Grace then that you'll open our eyes to the understanding of Thy word that we might understand the hour We're living and that we might prepare ourselves for his appearing as we truly believe it's at hand so now we would ask that you would give to us tonight the desire of our heart according to your riches and Glory forgiving our sins Lord we pray that you'll not look at our misunderstandings and our ignorance concerning the things that we should know and that you'll forgive us for that can you say amen amen see so Paul in speaking of Christ said that he was the expressed image of God the express image of God and again God is the word amen another place he said he was the image of the invisible god brother bradam says he was the visible image of the invisible God right remember when they said oh Jes if you'd show us the father it would suffice this and he said how long have I been with you and you still don't know who I am he that has seen me hath seen the father he was the visible image of God of the invisible God for the word had become flesh ain't that right so then Paul brings it down to us Romans 8:29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son yes now we know what image that is right if he was the image of God so are we yes sir brother Braham said if you're God's kind you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest word becoming flesh say it with me word becoming flesh yes sir see you're the expressed image of the word making itself manifest he says another place a woman is the part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible another place what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but a living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that word now living can you say Amen so then then we wouldn't look to anything outside the word of God it we look to the word of God to understand our position am amen I don't see how people get dissatisfied with the word of God I just don't understand but now notice the prophet said I fa in the spirit not long ago that someone was criticizing me it might have been in the tap land or of always referring so much go back and pick up Bible characters on what I'm saying see he said well I do that for a purpose the Bible said these things are written that we might look at them God wants you to have a mirror amen and that's the only way without an education the only way I can do is refer back and say you see where this stand see what happened by it and where this one took place then you just Place yourself in there ain't that right amen so now you you're looking at at at at Rahab the Harlot for example instead of looking at it as a as a past event put yourself there for this day PR amen so then you as Christ have got to look not only understanding the past as historical but seeing yourself can you say Amen understanding who she was portraying hello amen Esther RAB the Harlot um famar Mary even you realize well I'll just move on see your self there right ain't that right now I'm going to go back to 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all everybody say we all we all every believer with open face beholding as in a glass a mirror the glory of the Lord are what are we Baptist here or are we actually excited about the Lord preach I don't know come on or do I need to stop and so we can just go home sleep all right but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are what CH changed into the same image right praise the Lord changed into the same image from glory to glory from one glory to another Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord praise God ain't that right so I looked up the word understanding it means to grasp the meaning of to be thoroughly familiar with to have a clear or complete idea of oh man if there is ever a people that can understand the types and shadows it's a group of people that's in the believer in this message it's the believer of this hour that is beginning and I believe that's already got the grasp that thoroughly understands the meaning of these things when Jesus appeared to the men on the road to Emmas Luke 24:16 says Their Eyes Were Holden that they should not know him in other words they had no understanding of who he was and and and yet they were talking to him they were talking to Jesus about Jesus right but their talking and their understanding of him was that he's dead all hope is gone this man is a stranger ain't that right and yet the very one they're talking about is there in their midst yes amen but their eyes were withholding to where they couldn't understand see amen and and yet he was alive and and so so if you go down to the 30th verse it says and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him oh in all thine understanding get get get and all thy getting get understanding and they knew him when their eyes were open see so what it was brother Brown said he opened their understanding if you look in genes or where Jesus and speaking to the Pharisees he said oh you blind guides see he called them blind because they had no understanding of who he was they had no understanding of the day that they were living in they didn't have understanding of the word being fulfilled ain't that right so the word of the hour meant nothing to them the word the thing that God was doing right in their midst meant nothing to them because they didn't understand it and the prophet said they had the wrong interpretation and understanding yep they had the scriptures amen and they they they they sung the songs they read the quotes they done it all but they had the wrong interpretation and understanding of the scripture amen yes sir so they were looking at God in a past day that's right look at at God in the future and Miss what God was doing right then that's right ain't that right so now notice as we try to hurry along now won't keep you much longer God look at look at the analysis that God gives this layout see in church and what what it is wretched miserable naked blind blind right and knoweth it not in other words without understanding and if you look Revelations 3:20 Jesus Jesus says behold I stand at the door and knock standing at the door and knocking and if any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sub with him and he with me ain't that right in other words he he wants to do what he' done to the two on the road to emus that when he went into that room and he began to S with him and he began to break the bread whatever he done it opened the eyes of their understanding can you say man but we find here that he was kicked out of the church his own church and he's trying to get in now notice this fits with Romans the first chapter Paul speaks of a people who did not like to retain God in their knowledge therefore they are without understanding that's what Paul says they did not like to retain God in their knowledge they didn't want to retain the word for their age in in in their knowledge oh they imputed knowledge all right Creeds and dogmas and what this theology said and this Theologian and Dr so and so said but in all reality they were they were just misinterpretations yes man's own ideas and they didn't want to retain God in their knowledge so therefore Paul said they're without understanding can you say Amen so we see this scripture being fulfilled in this day wretched miserable blind naked and don't understand that they are in this condition now notice brother Brown says people through Traditions has blinded men from the great fundamental truths of the scriptures another place the Pharisees was keeping up their Traditions but behind their Traditions were the true word of God coming to shine forth and when it did it blinded their eyes they couldn't see it because they was watching something else I say to you Church don't look to the left or right no matter what comes or goes don't don't listen to the voices stay with what the voice of God is for today can you say Amen see so he says in another place Creeds and traditions in their blinded condition had turned them from the True Light of the promised word the word that God had indicated by Jesus the light of the world came and made that word live right exactly through his time see and so he says Traditions has blinded the people again to these great things that's been prophesied he says another place the reason that they failed to recognize Jesus being the Son of God is their Traditions had blinded their eyes but he was exactly with the scriptures hello amen he was exactly so notice what Jesus said in Revelations 3:18 I counsel thee he's talking to this age I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich I and and white rment that thou may be clothed and and and that that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear and and anoint thine eyes with isab that thou may see or that thou mayest understand ain't that right Glory see if they if if they would just only anoint their eyes with Isa they would know who he is in this age see and and and to think of it out of all the seven Church ages he has not made himself known until this age this is the only age that he's made himself known that we actually see him in the church age but he's he's outside the church because his own church kicks him out it doesn't mean that they just all stop being religious they're more religious than they have ever been yeah that's right but they have no understanding of the word so he's out trying to get in can you say Amen see so so what we're seeing is this is the this is the Fulfillment of Revelations uh or Luke 17:30 the revealing of the son of man the word made flesh and to show that it's him first of all he has his picture taken with a prophet yes that ain't a that ain't a make belief that's God in a pillar of fire amen and another thing to show that it's him he does the same sign that he did when he appeared as mzc to Abraham in the Old Testament he comes and does the same thing in this age showing that it's him can you say amen and the church world has cast him out which proves that they have no understanding brother Ram said see blinded by man's tradition they put him out the word out of their churches as usual as prophesied of them see so what what's happening today let's just put it down in plain English the message isn't fitting for churches today signs and wonders isn't fitting for their churches all that you know that screaming hollering blabbing blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are right isn't fitting for the house of worship anymore even to this this pillar this picture isn't fitting for the house of God in anymore see they they they kick him out and I sent the quote to y'all where brother Brown said even that picture should shake the Nations that picture right there should have shook the nations of the world yeah and people in this message now claiming that that's not fitting for the house of God leads people to idolatry I say it's without understanding that's what it is it's it's without understanding and because of that they kick it out they ain't got room for the power of God they ain't got room for the Lord to move and to fulfill his word Traditions have blinded them can you see amen sure so here we are we we've been All Through the Ages twisted up by traditions and Theology and man's lies and Corruption we know this scripture very well I'll read it it though Revelations 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven notice what he's going to do now why coming down clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little open book and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice can you say Amen as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices now I this that scripture I believe is tied to to Ephesians 1 and8 where Paul says this wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence Hallelujah can you say that with me all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will ain't that right what's he doing he's coming to give us understanding according to his good pleasure which Heath purposed in himself I look up that word Prudence it means to have understanding a quickness of apprehension he's abounded toward us with understanding he couldn't send us a theologian theologians don't know nothing amen can you say Amen so right after that in the 10th verse or the seventh verse 10th chapter but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished no longer a mystery no longer kept hid but an understanding would come at the sounding of that seventh angel can you say Amen notice what the prophet said the lamb took that book Glory says opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh Angel to reveal it to his people his elect this message won't mean nothing to anyone else but it does to the elect ain't that right CU we're looking at it now it's our understanding brother R said see he comes forth to take the book now watch to reveal the mysteries of God that others have guessed at in all these denominational ages see then the seven Angel if this book mystery is the word of God the seventh angel has to be a prophet for the word of God to come to and God Vindicated him as that prophet of Malachi 4 can you say Amen can I ask you this as we get ready close what good would it be for the seventh angel to come and reveal the Mysteries why why would he come why would God protect protect him you know how it is you you've heard his life story sir that when he was what just just a baby there just born that little old cabin it was dark and the only there was no light in that room and the light Shone through that window then two years old that voice from that tree says don't you ever drink or smoke or defile your body two years or was it 2 years old maybe he saw the the the the the bridge at 2 years old but then at at another time somewhere as a boy as he's packing the Moonshine for his his his daddy says that voice from that tree says don't you ever drink or smoke or or defile your body uh with women you know in any way because there'll be a work for you to get old when you get older and what happened Satan tempted him he almost lit up that cigarette yeah and he heard a throwed it away and took off running crying his dad called him a and he tried to he said give me that bottle and he tried to put it up to his mouth and that Whirlwind God kept him why because it was a seventh angel that someday he would come and he would grow into his ministry and and the lamb would come and take that book and reveal it to him that he could reveal it to us why why would God so protect that Ministry for us well brother brandham says this his message called The Bride out of the Pentecostal Traditions the message of the seventh angel called us out yes of the things that would blind us to where we couldn't see him we couldn't understand thank you Lord Jesus and when we got called out of it it opened our eyes we can understand who we are brother Braham said see the seventh Angel's message under the seven same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word oh my think of that the genuine atonement where's the atonement it's the blood the life the bloody bleeding word it's washed is clean he said see Christ impersonated in his word here made flesh Among Us and science has proved it by pictures science proved it right see so we could say the lamb has come the mighty Angel has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence understanding with an open book it's no longer closed traditions and all that can't keep it from us we can look in the word and begin to see ourselves cuz is this not when the book opened the lamb opened the book that John looked and saw his name in the book saw himself he began to understand his position then they tell us we can't shout we can't scream we can't get happy oh I love the Lord John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say to you Jesus tells them but you cannot bear them now in other words you cannot understand it but how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you into all truth so brother bradam quotes this this scripture and then he says this the holy spirit always speaks of the word see I've got many things to tell you you cannot understand understand it see now but when he comes he will guide you to it that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is and what he is and how he lives and his nature and his being he said see you're you're you're supposed to be all the way up here by that time to bring us into full statures and Son of Sons and Daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ that's bought without money it's paid for by the blood of Christ he said and all this time the mystery of God should be finished who God is and how he is made manifest and how when that seal was open how we begin to understand now how that he was the son of God he was God himself made flesh and the revelation of who he is can you say man if the musicians will come thank you for your patience tonight praise God wonderful in the in the um uh s what time is it brother brandom named several Mysteries just some of them that is supposed to be revealed by the seventh angel and I just listed some of them and like the mystery of the translation of the living Saints at the end time of this age we we we had no understanding but because of this message our understanding has is opened amen wonderful The Mystery of the new church Testament Church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles Hallelujah see the mystery of the church as the bride of Christ see these were Mysteries that had been shut up yes sure but he's opened the eyes of our understanding that we could understand who we are I so that you'll understand it I will call you bride The Mystery of the living Christ same yesterday today and forever the mystery of God even Christ as the Incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom all Divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man yes think of that these are the some of the Mysteries that that seventh angel [Music] unfolded the godliness is restored to man I was thinking of that godliness and and and First Timothy 3:16 Paul says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness yes sir remember this this would be something that would be restored to man God was manifest in flesh praise the Lord godliness restored to man you Lov him today today it's it's Christ in you the hope of glory God manifesting himself in you that should make us very humble that I can say don't don't lose your enthusiasm don't don't lose your enthusiasm for this message I want to I wasn't going to read it but I will read it brother Bri said in the meetings I've noticed people where the Lord under his discernment will speak right out in the audience just as he did when he walked in Galilee just as promised that he said he would do and people when the when for the first time when they see it they say oh did it he says that's got to be the Lord and then the next time they said well then after a while well it's just another thing see it's common he says it's passed over you don't notice it but notice what he says your eyes of understanding your heart becomes closed to it don't let your heart become close to the message to where we settle down as just church members where we just settle down to well I go to Faith Tabernacle yeah yeah let this word be your passion amen don't get don't lose your excitement for this word praise God can you sayen he said see you don't notice it it just come common it's passed over your eyes of understanding your heart becomes closed to it the thrill the blessedness of knowing the Risen Lord Jesus stand in our midst should send Every Soul to Heights beyond anything in this world could thrill it should do something to you it should shake your faith till you open up Every Door of Faith and everything else and say Lord Jesus take full possession of me now take me in your caring here come into my heart take my selfishness away take my misunderstandings away take all my doubts away open my eyes Lord and let me see and take all of me and be my Lord and until the church does that he says we're walking in darkness and you say man or in blindness so don't lose your enthusiasm for this message God wants to use us oh God help us and I'm talking to this preacher God help me let me become so solded out to this message let me be so sold out to him can you say say Amen to walk hand in hand with our Lord praise the Lord what song I I am redeemed oh sing it now yes I am redeemed I've been washed with the prize oh Jesus has changed my
