========================================

[Music] Kings and kingdoms will all pass away but there's something about that name oh there is something about that name [Music] aren't you glad you know him what power is in the name of Jesus Christ just a mention of that name amen and we see the mountains move we see God just come on the scene and show his power and we just we know that that's all every tongue will confess one of these days they're going to bow at him at his feet and confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord amen the musicians can be dismissed it's good to to be back home amen and I hear you all had just a wonderful service Sunday and we appreciate brother Terry and brother Josiah for uh being willing to fill in and forests and at a we had a wonderful time there at um Ohio and brother Tim cross he ministered Sunday and just done a good job and so we appreciate that and brother Andrew he's there preaching in there is a little ring in this I don't know what it is but um better yeah he's ministering uh for brother Matt Morris tonight and then we'll be starting a meeting in another place in Arkansas so we want to keep him in our prayer and he asked me to to greet you all for him but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter amen must have gotten a lot of rain over the weekend eh and uh I was reading the news they said there's some flooding going on in Virginia and several people are missing and and so I guess more up onto her Bluefield up in that area and it's moved houses off the foundations and so we want to keep the people in prayer for that the Lord will just I help them amen I tell you I just don't know what we'd do if we didn't know the Lord when we go through times of trouble and the Lord is certainly our stay he's our Rock and he's our comfort amen and but before we go into the word may we just borrow our heads and just talk to our Lord father truly your king of kings your Lord of lords and there's none else beside you and what an honor it is that you've called us in this age to be your ambassador to to serve you Lord and to run with your message and oh God to know that we have the scepter in our hands oh Father we just so thank you that you've redeemed us you bought us with your blood Lord and you've you've got a home prepared everything is set in order when the judgments of God are falling Lord the people don't know what to do they're shaking and fear trembling for their future is uncertain that Lord ours is certain father you've promised us a home you you promised us a way of Escape and oh Lord our hearts are at rest and we thank you for for for for providing such a refuge and I pray father that you would just bless what little words we have tonight though it may be simple let it be something that would uh better ground us and establish Us in you and bring us to a closer relationship with you father I pray that you would forgive us of our sins and our failures God and may your blood just cover us just now in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen and amen and the Book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and I'm just going to read the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. amen you can have your seats this evening and I'm going to continue on the thought the Lord is my shepherd and um this is a quite a statement that David makes in this um verse there because it's not just him saying that the Lord is his Shepherd but he's he's actually making a confession that he is the Sheep David is the sheep and the Lord is the shepherd later on in Psalms 103 David says know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us not ourselves we are his people and the Sheep everybody say we are the Sheep of his pastor and so God Likens us as sheep and uh there in in First Peter 2 and 25 it says that we were as sheep that were going astray but now we have returned to the shepherd and Bishop of our souls and so all through the scripture God Likens us as sheep and he Likens himself as the shepherd he's the shepherd we're the Sheep which you know this shows the type of relationship that we have with him there's a special relationship that Believers have with God and so if if we study these things um then we know what kind of relationship we have now uh for one sheep must have a shepherd and we must have God David was a Shepherd at one time as we know and so he was very familiar with the nature and the the way of sheep he knew how she acted he knew uh their character and and so he knew just how valuable the shepherd was to the Sheep and David was valuable he knew that he knew he was valuable to the Sheep he led them he protected them he fed them he watered them he watched over them he as the shepherd helped bring other Lambs into the world he went after the Lambs that lost their way and brought them back into the fold he kept them from coyotes and from wolves and in David's case we knew that he uh he kept them from the bear and the lion uh this is the the way of a shepherd and and the shepherd as the prophet would tell us that a good shepherd he'd have to know the difference between you know the sounding of a sheep and the sound of a goat and and he had to know his sheep very well and so David understood both the needs of the sheep and the cares that the shepherd had and so we find that sheep are dumb they're helpless they are defenseless and they need to be protected and and and think that's a need they need to be fed they need to be watered they they need because it's a matter of survival to the Sheep ain't that right and so they need a shepherd and God made them that way now you know brother Brown said learning about sheep is not just education but he said it's divine education if you want to know about sheep it's it's a Divine education to know how she are and in studying the Sheep we learn how needy we are for we need to be led we need to be fed we need to be watered ain't that right we need to be protected we need a shepherd this is an optional this is a need that we have as as a sheep of God ain't that rhyme sheep cannot find their own food they can't find food on their own they can't find water on their own they cannot discern the enemy when he's trying to sneak in uh it takes a Shepherd they they rely upon the shepherd's senses they rely upon the shepherd's knowledge they rely upon the shepherd's intelligence can you say man a man sheep cannot fight off the enemy on their own they are defenseless they they are without the shepherd they are nothing but pure prey ain't that right to the Predator so they literally depend on the shepherd to defend them to guide them to protect them and to feed them and to save them and you say man when a sheep gets lost there's absolutely no way he can find his way back he's lost he needs a shepherd and the prophet would tell us see that sheep cannot lead sheep so as we see in the Bible that without a Shepherd the Sheep scatter because they can't lead one another they don't know how to stay together without a shepherd but they they stay together because there's a shepherd and they all rally around the shepherd can you say Amen so we we find that the welfare and survival of sheep is the responsibility of the shepherd so then the sheep have a personal attachment they have this personal relationship with their Shepherd another thing about sheep is that they're they're sacrificial they're a sacrificial animal when you read about the sacrifices and altars made in the Bible It's usually the lamb that is on the altar um when we read about the Exodus it was time for Exodus there the first Exodus and time for Passover it was time for the Tolkien God would provide a lamb a sheep for the people ain't that right because he's a sacrificial animal a lamb was put on the Altar for a sin offering it was a lamb that was killed for the burnt offering it was a lamb that God provided um uh for Abraham's sacrifice God would provide a a Ram uh he lamb ain't that right and so the lamb also is a type of Christ amen the sacrificial animal when Jesus walked on the earth he was God's lamb ain't that right uh the provided sacrifice John uh introduced him as the Lamb of God Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world Peter would tell us that we were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without sparked or blemish ain't that right he was the Lamb of God so you you could see his life would would portray the life of a sheep amen his very own actions and Nature's proved that he was a lamb a man but a lamb nature amen and so we look at this lamb Christ acts 8 32 it tells us he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and we find out that sheep aren't driven they're LED and sometimes Christians may seem gullible because they're dumb helpless defenseless they're not made to be driven they're made to be led they're not made to live on their own they got to have a shepherd they're not made to make it on their own they got to have someone to lead them feed them ain't that right so we see the Life of Christ the lamb Matthew 4 and 1 then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil he was led get that word LED Matthew 26 57 and they that had laid hold on Jesus led him not pushed him not drove him not prodding him they led him not dragging him they led him and you say Amen to carefus the high priest Matthew 27 and 2 and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor I I think it's important that God would let us know that he was led they didn't take him they led him they could have said well the Bible could have said well they brought him you know and and there's many ways to bring a person but they led him and God wants us to know that he was led to Calvary he was led to crucifixion he was led can you say amen amen God didn't drive him out in the wilderness to be tempted he was led there amen see and so Matthew 27 31 and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to be crucified oh my God so then you go back to acts 8 and 32 and like a lamb dumb before his Shearer Saul opened he not his mouth they spat upon him he opened not his mouth they smote him he opened not his mouth they beat him with the whip in the open not his mouth you understand what I'm saying he was a sacrificial lamb ain't that right see he was a lamb now another saying Matthew 21 and 5. tell ye the daughter of Zion Behold thy King cometh unto thee meek keep that word meek keep it in mind Matthew 11 29 it says take my yoke upon you and this is Jesus speaking take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am what meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls brother Brown said a lamb is the meekest and most gentlest of all the creatures there is on Earth there's nothing any more Meeker and gentler than a little lamb so innocent and not self-sustaining it's not arrogant it's gentle Meek little creature ain't that right so when John would tell us Behold the Lamb of God here's the meekness of God here's the gentleness of God a man upon the Earth that was meek in his spirit gentle now it's a lot of this because again he's our example because we're sheep right and so I looked up this word meekness and according to the vines dictionary meekness means gentle mild and if you'll notice that this meekness is to God hello [Music] this meekness is toward God you humble toward God gentle to God because he's got to be led ain't that right you ain't gonna find you ain't gonna find a wolf gentle to the shepherd but you'll find that lamb gentle you'll find the wolf's not being Meek toward the shepherd but but you'll find that the Sheep being gentle to the shepherd you understand what I'm saying so this is a meekness that is toward God the great Shepherd now you you look John 4 34. Jesus says unto them my meat is to do the will of him not them but him hello see Jesus a lamb had to have a shepherd ain't that right and so my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work John 6 38 for I came down from Heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me don't think for a moment that his enemies took his life they didn't take his life he gave his life ain't that right he's a sheep the Bible says he gave himself a ransom for all Matthew 20 and 27. and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many he came he couldn't come in any other way but a lamb a man because his life was a sacrificial life he came to minister and to give his life and you say Amen you see this is what Christianity is about is to minister and to give our life hello so this proved that he was the Lamb of God he came in meekness now one writer said meekness is that temper of spirit in which we accept God's dealing with us as good hello without disputing or resisting so this is why God would depict us as Lambs because it's the most gentlest it's the most meekest animal there is how else could he go to Calvary if he wasn't a lamb [Music] what if he came as a lion he would have destroyed his enemies did he come as a lamb hello you ain't gonna leave no line ain't that right but he was a lamb that was led and so he he could accept God's dealings with him as good ain't that right and as Lamb's meekness is part of a lamb that's the nature that's the character that's what makes it sacrificial that we can accept God's dealings with us as good could you imagine the the shepherd trying to trying to you know Shepherds you know a goat Shepherd some other thing trying to lead them and kick it up a fuss I don't want to go to that pasture I don't want to go there I want to go here and the shepherd's constantly trying to wrestle with it she you don't ever see sheep in a rodeo you'll see the ball you'll see the wild horse but you ain't gonna see a sheep at a rodeo he's not the main he's not the main character at the rodeo right yeah that's right see so we we find that you you you you accept God's dealing with you as good without disputing and without resisting now a lamb first Peter 2 21 speaking of Christ but it says for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example and you say Amen not leaving the wild goat for an example he's not an example to the goat he's not an example to some wild beast out there he's an example to the other sheep hello as as we're talking now we're talking about sheep and what greater example of sheep then we've got in Christ himself and here unto where you call because also Christ suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his footsteps or follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened notch but committed himself to him the shepherd that judges righteously can you say man president said he didn't Rail and Carry On and fuss and stew and go on he just didn't do that now this proves to us that Lambs sheep are not fussy they want to do the will of the father they're obedient they're pliable call them dumb all you want to but they know they got to have the shepherd they know they're not out trying to be the lion they're not out trying to be the goat they're not trying to be nothing else they know God made them to have a Shepherd can you say man it's just a character it's just something there now brother bran would say now you let somebody do something to you or me my would just blow up like a toe frog eating buckshot but felt like an old goose I'll tell you right now you stepped on my toes like that again I'll never go back to that old church again no sir bless God hallelujah see the nazarenes will receive me the pilgrims holding us they'll take me Hallelujah I don't have to do it you don't do it no more all right see the dove takes his flight and you know what if that old hypocrite goes to that church I'll never go again bless God I'll just never do it well now brother Madam is showing us the difference between the nature of a sheep and the nature of a wolf hello try it so now if you notice because again David is saying the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want and and that whole scripture chapter first of all he's putting him his position as she the Lord's position as Shepherd his Shepherd so that means he's the Lord's sheep there's that relationship but you never find in that chapter where David is accusing God David never mentions anything about his problems David never mentions anythings about the trials and tribulations that he goes through or that he had gone through he just said the Lord's my shepherd and when you read that scripture it makes you want to be sheep it makes you want him to be your Shepherd because they get all what an awesome Shepherd God is leads me beside the Still Waters prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and it's all because the Lord's my shepherd but don't forget where God led him many times he was anointed to the throne but he didn't go to the throne immediately but David doesn't tell us these things does he not in this chapter well know that the Lord allowed David to go through many things that David didn't want to go through and it would actually seemingly break David into the point that David would die that David would never go to the throne but one thing through it all after it all David realized he's my shepherd remember he said if it hadn't been for the Lord on my side I've been swallowed up had not been for the Lord on my side you remember them chapters oh that man would praise the Lord why because in the times that you're going through your trials it seems as if you're the one that's doing it it seems as if you're the one that's struggling and making it a long through life it seems as if you're barely surviving not realizing if the Lord wasn't your Shepherd you wouldn't have survived at all David doesn't Point blame to God and he doesn't speak as though he's disappointed in God's leadership because he was a lamb he never mentions the fact that he was rejected of his own people as king right he never mentions the fact that he was sped upon and he knew that the Lord told that man to spit upon him remember the one by David drew his swords and how dare that dog spit on my king I'll take his head off and David says let him alone the Lord the Lord it wasn't his enemy the Lord wasn't David's enemy David the Lord was his Shepherd can you say man and David's going to take a scripture a passage of scripture to write about that Shepherd yeah hello sometimes we focus on everything that's going wrong when in all reality he's the shepherd David didn't stumble into these things the Lord led him just as much as Jesus didn't just stumble into this Wilderness of Temptation he was led to be there amen he just didn't stumble happened to just by chance go into Pilot's Hall he was led there hello David never speaks of the time of years that he was a fugitive and anointed knowing he was anointed to be king and spending many years running for his life from a Mad King that all he would let us know is the Lord's my shepherd hope you understand I know it's a simple but if you're sheep the Lord your Shepherd but one thing David would display as Christ displayed his meekness that they could accept God's dealings with them as good without disputing without resisting and you say man the shepherd was leading and as a lamb David followed sometimes we just want to think it's the world that's that's caving in on us it's life is just treating us bad we just think every day is just a bad day we just think the economy is just rough and if we're not careful we'll start using our lips to complain hello in all reality if you're sheep the Lord your Shepherd another thing about sheep is they forfeit the rights sheep forfeits its rights it Bears woo Prophet said which is a god-given right God gave that sheep the wool and yet it's the only thing that it has and yet it forfeits it sheep forfeit everything that they have it's a sacrificial animal can you say man Prophet said he's willing to lay Upon A sharing block and have every bit of it sheared off of he won't kick and fuss about it just lay him up there put the loops around his legs and he just lays there and you take it from him everything he has that he forfeits it without murmuring about it I wonder today we who are supposed to be the Lambs of God you just cross try Crossing you up one time and watch how much lamb you are you talking about kicking up a fuss well I'll tell you let something go wrong in the church well I'll just quit right now and go over and join the Methodist yes sir I don't have to put up with that that shows what you're made out of another place he says the lamb sacrifices everything he's got the lamb hasn't got nothing but wool and yet he lays there and lets them Shear it off of him and says nothing about it the Bible can share everything all the pride and everything else out of you and if you're a lamb you'll say nothing about it can you say Amen amen that's right but you tried goat one time and you'll have it first kicked up right quick that's the difference between goat and sheep ain't that right now notice Romans 8 14 we know this that Paul said but as many as are Led Led by what the spirit of God the shepherd I want to get into that more later but as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God sheep cheap sons of God are sheep Daughters of God are sheep ain't that right and the Lord is their Shepherd and they follow him now that means that Hollywood isn't going to lead you it means that family and friends aren't going to lead you you understand the shepherd has more influence over you than anything in the world hello that that's the relationship that sheep have with the shepherd let let you walk up to that that that that the sheep and you're not Shepherd of that sheep they ain't gonna know your voice you you're a stranger to them hello you can talk all you want to but let the Shepherds speak once and the Sheep will rally around the shepherd because he sways the influence over them can you say Amen so this modern day Society isn't going to lead you your job is it going to lead you you know so many people today let their unconverted boss lead them around ye is it your spiritual guide he ain't worried about your spiritual walk with God he don't care about church he don't care about the supernatural things all he's worried about is making the money you understand what I'm saying see so so many times though if the boss says you're working late and you you ain't going to church we we just we just automatically fold well it's true but the Lord's got to be your Shepherd hello The Shepherd of the the the Sheep money isn't going to lead you your flesh isn't going to lead you ain't that right the carnal mind isn't going to lead you for David said the Lord is my shepherd He leadeth me Elijah and pass that your flesh would never go he'll Lead You In places that your carnal mind would never take you right you say man so one must possess a sheep like nature in order to be led by the shepherd why sheep trusts the shepherd they depend on the shepherd they have absolute confidence in the shepherd I know there's a big argument upon who's who what and who is our absolute today among the message ranks but you understand that for the Sheep their Shepherd is their absolute his voice is there absolute can you say man notice John 10 and 2. that he that enters in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his not footsteps right the Sheep don't hear him Belch the Sheep don't hear him break a stick that's not what appeals to the Sheep let that Shepherd speak and they hear his voice he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out aren't you glad you're being called by name oh to save the lamb Book of Life been opened our names were written in that book and in this age the voice of the shepherd is speaking as I said before it's the only age that we hear we hear the warning we hear the warning don't don't don't uh don't disregard the voice right remember he's knocking at the door if any man will hear my voice the holy age is this layout of sin age that we hear that warning hear my voice and open up I will come into him and sup with him ain't that right what is it it's it's the word being sounded out the full word the opening of the word the pure word of God and we understand it's the shepherd's voice not just a man talking it's God talking through that prophet can you say man see and he's calling us see calleth his own Sheep by name and lead him out and when he puteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice see the voice of the shepherd is their absolute that's why I say this messages are absolute can you say Amen now they want to put it as just a a voice of another man but I say it's the voice of God to you brother Branham even said it he said I am God's voice to you and he said I felt bad about it the first time for saying that but it repeated it [Music] can you say Amen now they can say we're following a man all they want to I say I see my shepherd aren't you glad that the shepherd or that the Sheep is not it's not following the form of a shepherd they don't know him by Form per se they know him by his voice isn't that amazing how God would make a natural sheep type out the spiritual sheep when God was in Moses the people followed the voice when God was in Noah the elect the Sheep followed the voice All Through the Ages it's been The Voice amen they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee run from him so you you you and I've if you're not the shepherd say if if you go to a natural sheep let's say and you you're about visiting and you see all the sheep and you see the shepherd so you'll never have relationship with that sheep like the shepherd has there's a lot of strange voices in this age brother Brown names a bunch of them voice of Education voice of Hollywood for some pleasure voice of entertainment at religious voices it's just voice after voice after voice and they're sounding in this age at the time the shepherd sounds his voice sure he sounds his voice so that the Sheep know who to follow they know not the voice of strangers the walls of Hollywood is a stranger to sheep voice of education is a stranger hello yeah yeah yeah yeah see so many people go start out with God and they go to them colleges and and they start living out there and we've seen it happen they go shipwreck they come out here they say well we're going to visit church we want to contend Church while we're here and he'll start for a little while and brother Walker you've seen it we know it and and before you know it they go Shipwrecked they no longer come to church they start you know if there's the girls they start wearing you know fingernail polish on the toes and the fingers and this and that and before you know it you don't see them much anymore but I'm telling you it's a voice to get you away from the voice of the shepherd all these voices that notice in the 27th verse John 10 27 my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me they follow me can you say man you know brother Branham in his later maybe one of the last sermons well the last one of the last sermons he preached was leadership you got to listen to that and it sounds as though he's talking to him about himself but it's not he knows he's getting ready to leave but the voice of the shepherd remains and God was telling us as sheep follow come follow me right follow me now listen if if one has not a sheep like nature than the voice of the shepherd means nothing ain't that right the voice of the Lord then becomes quietened by all these other voices and remember the prophet says all these voices are sounding so loud that they're actually putting the voice of the Lord back way somewhere else but the Sheep are following that voice that the world is pushing back ain't that right see now you know I I think I told you mentioned to you that you know brother Branham was was in another country and he was riding with a man I think in a Jeep and they were in traffic and he said all of a sudden they just stopped come to a complete stop in the middle of the road everybody just stopped brother Brown said what what's going on he says get on the bumper and look so he got on the bumper and he's looking and there's a shepherd with a sheep crossing the road remember you mean we're going to stop for this and he says but the shepherd has the right of way everything stops when the shepherd comes you know and brother Brandon typings that out that when the shepherd comes everything gonna come to a stop you're coming for a sheep aren't you glad for that oh yes I'm glad for that but see everything he says given them the right away he said it was a sight to be hoped and he says you know he said I watched that Shepherd come down through a street and in Palestine and different countries the orange everywhere they don't take their food and put them in fine glass counters like we do they just have a little spray coming up or just a bunch of fruit laying out and stuff right on the streets and here come that Shepherd going right towards one of them places and I thought man you're going to have a riot sure enough and as we drove up close to watch the strangest thing was that chipper went down through between those Great Walls of fruit and dainty things and pears and vegetables which the Sheep would love and it sure looked like them sheep would jump from one side to the other but they followed that Shepherd so close that they never looked to the right nor to the left they walked right through every Temptation following the shepherd and I thought oh God a true Born Again sheep of the foe will go through the Temptations of this life following the shepherd for my sheep know my voice and that Shepherd would just speak to them he said I notice in those great times of distress those great Temptations those little sheep looking from side to side and one time a lamb would try uh uh and the mama would nudge him a little bit he said we need some old more some more old-fashioned nudge and mammies with our kitties tonight when they're doing wrong and I noticed that Shepherd stepped out and going like this if he made a step out like this and come back every sheep followed him went straight in the same step they come right up there and go in and go out everyone right following right along with these others and our old brother it's not a sheep that gets out of order it's a goat that'll go aside for the temptation it's a goal that'll go out and grab a pear or whatever he can get a hold of not the Sheep it's the goat can you say man and the only thing that falls out is those who are tottering and waving so we find that a man's nature must be changed from a wolf or a goat to a sheep and if you're God's sheep and the Lord is your Shepherd then you will recognize his leadership you will be grateful for his leadership you will seek after his leadership you will wait for his leadership because now you are sheep you've got the nature of a lamb eat that right I know this is simple but I hope it drive to drive it home Matthew 12 15. Jesus said for whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven the same as my brother and sister and mother read that again for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my mother sister and brother brother sister and mother see in other words the ones who does the will of my father are the ones who are part of me relationship can you say Amen it's it's because he's the lamb we're Lambs he done the will of the father we do the will of the father ain't that right so the ones who are blood relationship they are family now notice second Peter 1 and 3 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partaker of what the divine nature It's the Most Blessed thing to be a partaker of this divine nature that it would be even to be part taker of Heaven that it would be to be part taker of all other other blessings that God has hello people receive blessings of God all around yeah but there's that sheep there's that elect that can actually be partaker of the divine nature it's a blessing and because we are partaker of this divine nature we have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust ain't that right remember the water that flowed from The Rock you know they they painted just a little trickle just a little trickle brother Brown said it couldn't have been a little trickle it had to feed the two two and a half million people and the camels and the goats and all the animals the herds but he said not only that but but towns cities Beyond them they partook of that water that overflowed that flowed down into their cities they were able to partake of it and so is it in this age the Revival has gone to where everyone the world look at how blessed people have been right but then there's that few that are partaker of divine nature now now how do we become partaker I mean what what is this it's the life of the Lamb coming back upon you it's the token the life is the token and the token has to be on display can you say amen for all deceased so the life of the Lamb coming into you makes you a lamb raise some water think of how we used to fuss and kick trying to make our own way but then the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost really comes in it it it doesn't just make you churchy it doesn't just make you well now I got the Holy Ghost I said on the pew no no many people without the logo sits on pews many people without the Holy Ghost believed in a god-centered prophet many many people but but at the same time the the Peter I think it was that would talk about this age that there would be a people that would deny deny the Lord that bought them they would deny him the rights to be to be owner to be leader to to have his way with them so when we say of this divine nature we find that the life is the token and for this time this evening time life this is the evening time it's token time so then if if there's ever a time they have it think of it the voice of the shepherd speaks in this age If any man hears my voice and yet there has to be a life on display life of what the life of the Lamb right he was a lamb and now the life of that lamb has come back upon us the show that we are purchased we are the redeemed so it's at this time that when the voice is uttering there is a sheep the life has entered into us to make us sheep don't worry we only hear that voice and when the life of the Lamb comes into you then the Lord becomes your Shepherd we sing the song where he leads me I'll follow I mean people have sung that in the churches claiming to have the Holy Ghost and still doing the ways of the world see he cannot be your Shepherd I'll tell you partake of the divine nature ain't that right I want you to I want to read this and you know but brother Brown said a young man asked me the other day said if you you think I could or ought to get married brother Brown does such and such girl and said how much do you think of her she said he said I just love her he said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her you can live without her you better not but if it's going to kill you you better get go ahead and get married see and I said yeah and and so what I was trying to tell him is that if you love her so much see now right now before you're married and everything is fine and dandy but after you get married then the tolls and trials of Life come in that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her and she's disappointed in you and yet you still understand one another and he said that's the way it is with Christ we've got to be so in love with him see till when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit see why and the only way that you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you ain't that right so so we find that that you you you're so in love they're they're becomes such an attachment to Christ Our Shepherd that that where we put ourselves at his leadership we we put ourselves at his Mercy hello because there's there's an understanding there's a love there in such a way that he can actually have Sovereign rights in his leadership it can be Sovereign leadership over our lives and wherever he takes us whatever he allows to come whatever it would be we may pray for something and it doesn't happen that way we may Envision something happening and yet it it's totally blocked and we find our Direction going something else but yet we know it's the Lord leading ain't that right then with that meekness we accept his dealings with us as good right that's good without resisting or disputing right as I close I think it's kind of funny how the prophet would use different animals in their nature to show people what they are in their nature and really Bram talking about when he's in in Oklahoma Tulsa and he said I was getting in an awful mess there are them denominations begin swinging around there and I so I was sitting in this building one day and I saw a vision saw a little pretty little old kitten and he was laying on a silk pillow and he was the cutest little fella and I walked over there and he said I'm afraid of a cat but I went over there and I began to rake him and he was going purr purr you know he said you know he's however they do that funny noise you know and I was raking him they all saying pretty little kitty and he disappearing just as fine you know and I looked over this behind his pillow and it it said Pentecostal kitten well I thought now that isn't that strange and I said this has got to be a vision and something said as long as you rake his fur this way it's all right you know but now if you want to see what he's really made out of rake is fur backwards so when I raked his fur back then I stuck out green and he was a monster standing there spitting at me as hard as he could see just rake his fur back a little bit tell him his baptism in the father son holy ghosts of the devil now the Catholic church and Watch What Happens his fur gets up but see it's it's something Al that people are God would use the animals to to do such a thing such now brother Branham in another place if the musicians will come that brother Branham in one sermon was talking about the Gentile woman who Jesus called a dog and we all know the story she's meeting her daughter her daughter was vexed with the Devil and needing deliverance and but even though he called her a dog he insulted her calling her a dog yet she was still persistent she wouldn't quit she wouldn't leave her faith was so great that she wanted that and she had to have that miracle and he said now that wouldn't work on a bunch of Canadians would or a bunch of Americans he called him a dog or something why you're something or another you're a bunch of anglicans you know there's nothing to you something like that all my sakes you'd blow up like a frog getting shot he says see you would have not he said excuse the prayer expression see but um he said you would have thought awful bad about that if Jesus would have said I'm not sent to you anglicans I'm not sent it to you Pentecostals You're simply God you Church of God whatever you are I wasn't sent to you you're nothing but a bunch of dogs I'd have seen that disappointed look and say well I won't have nothing to do with him at all it wasn't right to begin with I'll just go back over to my own church but not her she had Faith she wasn't in a hotbed plant a hybrid some like like some of them today that called themselves Believers can't sit still a minute to the gospel that's what we got today a bunch of hot bed plants you have to Baby them all the time keep them sprayed the bugs off of them that's right and then goes back to that kitten see baby them like a kitten rubbing is for one one way and he'll purr but rub it back once and it shows what's in him can you say man and so we finding that in this age we're really seeing what is in in US [Music] because anyone who is a lamb of God are led by God 's going to have his Sovereign way not just his way but it's a sovereign way it's and Sovereign is it it's not attached to anything it's it's he and he alone he makes the decisions over our lives he plans Our Lives not us he directs our lives and it's it's no other influence but he himself the shepherd ain't that right and then but you notice what Jesus requires notice what this Shepherd requires for those who follow him Matthew 16 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me and whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it is why you you can't try to follow him [Music] without first having a sheep like nature because that's a sacrificial animal right sacrifice is a hard thing brother Brown said we want to make the sacrifice out of will something easy he said that's not a sacrifice sacrifice is something that hurts and cuts that's what is a sacrifice he said you're glad to bring somebody else to church you're glad to put flowers on the Altar and do a little charitable Deeds which is all right but are you the lamb [Music] then you're the one that God wants on the altar it's a sacrificial life giving yourself completely into his will foreign did not Jesus tell us to pray teach us to pray Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven right how can that prayer be fully fully set from heart from our heart if if we have the nature of a goat nature of a wolf nature outside of the nature of a sheep can you say man we're not to tell him what we're going to do we're we're not to tell him the plans that we have made we come to him as sheep and we treat him as the shepherd thy will be done thy kingdom come you do what you think best for me [Music] the Lord is my shepherd right David knew he was an honored to be king and he knew there would have come a time that he would be king but for now the Lord's leading me somewhere else I'm walking in a path of sacrifice [Music] what we don't know is God was molding David or what David may have not known at that time he was molding David can you see man brother Brian said now you're going to have to sacrifice not man and money you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer you're going to have to sacrifice maybe that stubborn wheel to break down in humility you're going to have to he says the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself let him take up his cross and follow me daily so he says how often do you have to sacrifice every day ain't that right for Paul says I Die daily all Lambs of God you love him I've thought of the Prophet talking of the Queen of Sheba and he describes how that there was that longing in that Queen when she heard of the Living God working through solemn and the wisdom of God and oh it reached her ears of the stories and it was so burning in her that she says I'm going and we just think well maybe just getting up and getting the car and going to like we would Walmart or something but no she had across the desert for months she had to go through things that well brother Brown said you know she talked to her maybe talked to her bishop or a priest and her priest says Ah that's nothing of the devil but thus it was still burning in her heart I gotta go I gotta go and and he said well if you go you're going to be excommunicated we ain't gonna have nothing to do with your church one but she had to make the sacrifice she had to go in that hot burning desert when there's when there's there's thieves and robbers and and all of that her life she's putting her life in danger but she made the sacrifice to see the Living God all the Lambs of God look at us how we've made sacrifice after sacrifice maybe content with our organizations our denominations or whatever you hear of people that had their Prestige and and was moving up the ladder but when they heard the message they left it all to see a living God and sometimes even as a church we have to sacrifice things see a living God to see God moving Among Us sacrifice things give up that television give up the movies give up whatever that is holding back from the blessings of God from coming into your home can you say Amen see sacrifice but sheep sacrificed they're the only ones because they're sacrificial animals can you say Amen the world wants to see God religion wants to see God but they can't give it up can't give up they're doctrines and they refuse to give them things up but there's a little bride that says you know I'm willing to give it all willing to forsake it all I want Jesus I want him to Lead Me can you say man where he leads me I will follow [Music] where he leads me I will follow foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] will follow where he leads me [Music] with him [Music] where he leads me [Music] up [Music] here [Music] is bless me where he leads me I will follow [Music] with him [Music] all the way as they just play brother brim said when you come to see God you don't just come on a flower bed of ease you have to make a sacrifice it's a sacrificial way it's a way of death you have to die out to come to him you have to forget all you ever know in order to learn of him empty out that he can fill us and you don't mix it you have to empty out can you say Amen another place he says the Christian Life is a continual sacrifice he that will come after me let him deny himself daily every day not 46 days but every day take up his cross and follow me Christian Life is one continually went oh how the Christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with the grudge he does it with a feeling that he loves God and he's glad that he can do it it's a joy to serve the Lord Jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord It's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of God's sake it's a joy to take a stand for the right and move from the wrong it's a joy to praise him it's a joy to abstain from the things of the world it's in their heart it's a perfect limb to Lenten all the time giving up sacrifice and God's spirit comes into you and changes your desire oh aren't you glad for that it's a joy to serve the Lord for the Lord is my shepherd where he leads leads me I will follow where he leads me I will follow oh where he leads me I will follow I'll go with him with him [Music] foreign [Music] take up your cross and follow Jesus Jesus take up your cross oh every day don't be ashamed to say that you know him foreign count the cost take up your cross follow him singing now or take up your cross [Music] and follow Jesus take up your cross and every day [Music] oh and don't be ashamed to say that you know him count the cost take up your cross follow him say it one more time oh take up your cross [Music] and follow Jesus I'll take up your cross [Music] be ashamed to say that you know him count the cause take up your cross oh count
