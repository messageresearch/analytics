amen well how many believes you're going to see a victory amen that's what we're called to do amen and um I um I think we should um be encouraged be strengthened knowing that the Victory Is Ours amen and uh I think as Paul would say he giveth the victory gives us the victory amen and we have victory over the world over sin over everything thing that the devil would put Upon Us amen I'm so glad for that you love the Lord amen trust everyone had a good day today amen and um um I know it's an off night but it's sure good to see everyone good to see Brother Sam good to have Sister Crystal back uh

glad to have Sister Lisa back and feeling good praise the Lord and I uh think everybody's got their electricity on brother Joe you get your electricity good good and uh I think brother Kevin was saying they lost their power today again for couple ours but got it back on so I guess just keeping all of us keeping our fingers crossed and amen I uh I am so thankful for electricity amen thank God for Thomas ederson I guess he's the one amen but uh uh you know you just uh don't realize how what privileged how privileged we are and until we lose lose what we have amen and I certainly love the the Lord if you have your Bibles and um the musicians can be dismissed but um 1 Corinthians the uh 15th chapter praise the Lord and um so many things going around in the world today so much trouble I know the the calling for peace you know but it just seems like um um just trouble on every side but I am so glad that we have peace in God and uh no matter what comes our way no matter what happens amen we're in his hands and it's an eternal peace amen praise the Lord before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and just talk to our father precious Lord we're so thankful Lord that we have that peace that you've given us Lord that the world can't give the world don't even understand the kind of peace that we have in the turmoil going around in the world today father but oh God we're here today with joy in our our hearts Thanksgiving Lord and our lips praise adoration father towards you we're not worried about our future our future is in your hands and father we're resting in that and we're just asking now that you would speak Words of Life To Us Lord and you know the the things that your people may be going through and I I pray pray somehow that you you would meet them tonight meet every need whether it be healing whether it uh be in need of encouragement whatever it would be father may your words of Life come and create within us Lord what is needed help me to get myself out of the way father may you speak through these mortal lips Lord and father we give you all glory praise and honor we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen now uh 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and we're just going to read the last verse uh 58th verse there uh therefore my brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as say you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen so it says be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord amen uh you can have your seats this evening and um I guess that would be my title is be F steadfast abounding in the work of the Lord and I was just uh kind of just thinking today and pondering on what I could say to maybe help us to encourage and um you know there there's so many many things especially if you've been in in the uh Christian uh few years you know you you think you we've heard everything that can be said and uh but yet I I think the words of God are Eternal and uh that uh you know uh it's it's something that can help us no matter how many times we hear something uh and uh but one of the things that the prophet made clear to us is that we all have a work to do every one of us have something to do uh uh in the Lord and he would tell us that each one of us has a Ministry how many believes that one of the things that I think the devil has a a um his his trick is is to just to tell us you know or and to try to convince us that we ain't gotten no place uh and and maybe we're not doing good or maybe we're just wandering around and and and and and our life isn't that important but it is important it seems like life is being diminished in this age and uh to where it just you know murders and uh suicides and things you know and it's just you know uh uh a lot of folks feeling that their their life isn't a value but brother brandom said even though our our ministry may be peculiar it all works together for the rest of the body ain't that right and so therefore uh we we cannot you know we cannot say well you know the holy man is the pope or the holy man is the bishop or you know looking at something else as something being holy or whatever as as man has for years and has been taught that it's only a certain group or it's only a certain person or a certain office that that is Holy and and and these things but brother brand would say the the holy man is Christ how many believes that the holy man is Christ and the Holy Spirit is in us so that Holy being is is within every one of us so he says well then how can you say the Ley has no word to say each one of you has something to say each one of you has got a work to do each one of you has got to carry a message ain't that right so every one of us has got something to do has got something to say we've got a message to carry amen and so a according to to what Jesus said the ones who are steadfast uh uh the one the Overcomer they're the ones that's going to sit with with him in his his throne amen so we must be steadfast in what God has called us to do now the word steadfast means firmly fixed in place it's it's uh not subject to change immovable loyal constant ain't that right now we're we're we're in a in a a a time of shifting sand everything is moving what used to be is is no longer everything is changing it it don't matter if it's policies or if it's convictions if it's home life it's in the church it's in our nation in our schools uh everything is changing so rapidly that you know it it it it's just mindboggling you know of of how fast things are really changing uh to where it does today doesn't resemble what what it was 50 years ago or or 30 years ago or or whatever and and so I I it comes to mind about you know in the restaurant um when when our church was uh there at the golden Crow and and everybody was coming through and and um uh when everybody come through you know the the young lady told me says boy y'all are ancient you know y'all remind me of the Bible days I said oh really well how's that so all the long hair and the dresses and all that the way y'all dress and you know and I'm thinking but that that was just a few years ago when everybody done that you know in the 50s um or 60s or whatever but uh but it changed so fast that we were dinosaur you know uh to her uh but but you know but here steadfast Amen in this world of ch change and everything just just uh uh uh not not staying the same yet God would tell us be steadfast immovable in the work in the work of the Lord now you know it seemed like maybe our our bodies are changing even and as we get older and and it seems uh in in different ways there's there's things about us that that change and and maybe our thoughts pattern would change as far as what we used to think as young young uh people versus up you know uh in in the older you know I I when I was younger you know I didn't think about you know checking the water before I dove you know into it I um I just saw it was nice and and I knew I could do it you know and and so then my dad comes and checks the water and he about has a cow you know and and um uh because I was ding way up there in waste deep water you know but it never just now for me to my boys to do that today I'd have a cow too but things change as you get older you you start your perceptions change and all that but there's one thing that must not change and that is our steadfastness in what God has called us to do another word for steadfast is is that we could use is the word faithful now uh in in t 2 Timothy 2 and 2 Paul wrote uh Timothy saying the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men amen don't just commit it to just anyone but commit it to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also ain't that right so so then then God is looking for steadfastness he's looking for faithful faithful men and women Amen to carry out the the ministry uh uh first uh Corinthians 4:2 it says it is required in in stewards that a man be found faithful or or steadfast so this is exactly what we are uh and that is stewards we're all stewards of what God has given us a men were were stewards and and and because we're we're all part of the work of the Lord this message that God has brought us in I I believe that he has put us in the message that that we could be stewards of the message how many believes that amen what whatever gift whatever calling whatever Talent whatever uh uh things that God has given us we are stewards of that uh of that Ministry of that gift that calling and and so uh uh well then how do we how how do we come into the work of the Lord do we come into it by accident is it just something that we want to do is it is it something well I I I want to you know I I want to be a deacon so I'm just going to do it or I want to be a musician so I'm going to do it and and and we find out that's not really uh uh uh not the way it it it works uh not everybody's called to be a deacon not everybody's called to be a song leader not everybody's called to be a musician not everybody's called to be a preacher and and all of these things but yet we've all got a Ministry but how did we get here you know I I think um uh uh 1 Timothy 1 and 12 uh Paul would tell about his own Ministry and his own self he says that I I think Christ Jesus our lord who hath enabled me everybody say he's enabled me who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry so Paul even himself is saying I did not become into the ministry by self desire or by my will or by my effort it was God who had enabled me and put me into the ministry a ain't that right and so if if if Paul was put into the ministry by God himself and was enabled by God well then that would show that we're all in in in that way we we are we come into the work by God putting us into the ministry and enabling us I I thought of you know I think it was Jeremiah God told him you know before thou was even conceived in your mother's womb I knew thee and I ordained thee to be a prophet see so so it comes from God Almighty ain't that right so it it is God that hath enabled us I I looked up this word enable it means to empower to strengthen to cause to operate amen now think of that he has enabled us he's caused us to operate he's caused us to function he's the one that's given us the ability to do what we do he's he's given us as as Paul would say I am what I am by the grace of God the grace of God was not just manifested when Paul gave his heart to God it was manifested in every part of his life it it was the grace of God that enabled him to to stand and to declare the gospel to Kings and to uh uh uh to to just regular people it was the grace of God that that Paul had and and of of to where that he could uh separate law and Grace it wasn't his own wisdom it was the grace of God everything thing about his life was by the grace of God God had enabled him and put him into the ministry ain't that right so I think of what Paul said he said he has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works amen but according to his own purpose he he he is its own purpose Heath enabled us according to his own purpose he put us in the ministry according to his own purpose he's he's placed us where he wants us according to his own purpose do you believe that see and so he says his purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the foundation of the world Amen Jesus said also as we all know where he says you know you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and so there for we can truly say he hath enabled us we have been enabled by God remember what Zechariah the prophet would tell us it's not by might God speaking through that Prophet it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord I think every day we ought to we ought to thank God for enabling us Amen to believe this message to live this message to to say Amen to the word of God to be able to come to the house of God amen it's it's by his spirit that we're able to do these things and we're being built up into the Most Holy Faith because God hath enabled us it's it's not us it's not our ability it's not our own thinking but God hath enabled Us by his Spirit can you say man you know uh uh one might say well I I just can't do it and we we must never come into this uh to where Satan gets us convinced that we're not not able to carry out the the the ministry that God has for us we we must never um we we we must never uh uh put ourselves down in in in a in a way to where that we insult God's intelligence by placing us into the ministry to where we say well I just can't do it I'm I'm not and and and and don't get me wrong I I think we all ought to feel in in that sense that that it's not us that we're not able to do it the moment we say well I'm the minister and everybody needs to listen to me well there's something wrong there but but then Satan can get us to the point to where we say well I'm just not a minister and I'm just not good enough and so we we therefore we don't try we therefore we we just sit on a on a Pew backsliding because we just don't feel like we're able to do anything well if if Satan gets us into that place well then God can't use us you you understand what I'm saying amen see so so uh uh anything that God has called us to do you can do it everybody say I can do it you can do it if God has called you and if he's called you then he's enabled you and and and placed you there so so it all has to come from God Jesus was predestinated to do what he did and to be what he was amen and and we can truly say he was enabled by God to fulfill a the purpose that God had predestinated him to amen for Luke 4 and8 and this is where Jesus was amen and this is he he knew that the scripture had spoke of him he he had this understanding that I do have a purpose in life and and and and and my purpose is spoken of in the scriptures and the prophets have spoken of me and and so therefore he could take the scriptures and and and apply it to his life and say this is who I am but but yet he knew that it had to be not just him as a man trying to accomplish what God had called him to do but notice he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me aren't you glad for that the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me well why did he anoint him to preach the gospel in other words to do everything that God had predestinated for him to do God now placed his Spirit upon Him amen and and and uh it not in a measure like maybe we would have but the fullness of the spirit of God Came Upon him and lived in him and anointed him ain't that right he was anointed to preach the gospel to the poor we can say he was enabled Amen to to heal the brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to sit at Liberty them that are bruised to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord see he was anointed he was enabled he was placed in the ministry if if if we could say it that way I understand that he was God but yet he was man amen and and as a man he couldn't do nothing as a man he couldn't raise from the dead as a man he couldn't uh walk up to Calvary as as as just an ordinary individual amen but God was with him God had ordained him for such a Ministry and and no matter how small no matter how great no matter how hard no matter how whatever it was he was able to accomplish what God had had called him to do his purpose in life can you say Amen well that's the same way you could look at your trials you could look at the obstacles and you say well there ain't no way amen and and we're in a generation that we we want it easy amen it's an age where people just want things so easy they don't want fight for it they don't want to have to you know strive for it they they they they you know they want everything their way and and how they want it when they want it and all these things see amen but but we realize that if we're in the ministry in the work of the Lord that is totally different God doesn't give everything the way we want it God doesn't do everything that we we think he should do and and and and everything isn't just handed to us uh on a silver platter that's why he says be steadfast in the work of the Lord there's going to be times that are are good times there's going to be times that are rough times there's going to be times that everybody accepts you and then there's times everybody rejects you and and and all these things this was the Life of Christ amen the one moment they're applauding him the other moment they're driving nails in his hands and and uh you know and and all of these things but be ye steadfast in the work of the lord it's it's not that we demand God to to do things God put us in the ministry in the work of the Lord to fulfill his will and and so you are as as Christ was you are anointed to fulfill the purpose that God has ordained you to fulfill and without that anointing you're nothing without the anointing I'm nothing you understand that see it it's not that what makes me a good preacher is I went to school and and I had Seminary and I can speak good language and and and and and put a program together that's not it it's the anointing that makes the difference can you sayen see so a man will fail now notice a man will fail when he tries to do something apart from what he's anointed to do amen when you when you're anointed then you have the same Authority as or same power as Samson did when he carried away the gates of a city when you're anointed that that's the that's the difference the anointing makes the difference you you have the same Authority as David did amen when he defeated the bear defeated the lion and and ultimately defeated Goliath amen see you have that same Authority when you're anointed you have the same power as as Samson did when he killed a thousand Philistines amen with with the Jawbone of a donkey you have that same Authority Amen to defeat uh the enemy as as shamard did when he defeated and uh uh 600 Philistines amen with just an ox gold see he was anointed to do that you understand see and we're anointed to do what we're doing amen when you're anointed you have the same Authority as Joshua did when he stood there and commanded the son to stand still and the son obeyed his word it was an anointing ain't that right see God had placed him there God had ordained him for the call for the for what he was doing now in the anointing when Jesus said thee Heath anointed me amen well the anointing as the prophet said it didn't make him run around the building and scream and holler and shout and he said then things are blessings he said but that that's not the anointing if you look when when Jesus said Heath anointed me and he and he began to described why he was anointed then the Bible says he just closed the book handed it back and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth can you say Amen so brother Brown said see that's what Jesus done under the anointing so he says see the anointing is not emotions there there's going to be times in your ministry in your in your daily walk where there's not going to be emotions and and Satan will will will cause you to to to to maybe to to wonder you know am am I even in the will of God I I don't see things moving like I used to and and maybe everything's just not exciting as it used to be but see that doesn't change the anointing the anointing is not emotions can you say amen amen and the anointing he said is supreme power in control like knowing exactly what and how and that's what's here can you say Amen see so the anointing don't don't get anointing mixed up with emotions and excitement and I I believe in excitement I love emotions and and I can be an emotional guy you know and and and and you know I I I get excited about things and and and and so uh but that doesn't mean that you know that that that that's the anointing when the emotions leave amen that anointing still there so so that's where Jesus was you know when when he was you know he was anointed when he uh turned the water into wine amen that was an anointing do you believe that but he was still anointed when the 70 walked away from him he was anointed when when he uh uh healed the the the blind man blind bmus and yet he was anointed amen when he began to open the word and said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in me see and and so that there was an anointing and yet different phases of his ministry but he was steadfast and no matter what phase it was whe whether it was uh uh uh uh uh you know uh uh feeding the 5,000 and or or walking up to to golgatha or whatever it was he was steadfast in what God had purposed him to do uh 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul would tell us now he which establishe us us with you in Christ uh and hath anointed us is God Amen your anointing comes from God your calling comes from God your placing comes from God your purpose comes from God you believe that amen we must believe that now brother Bram said speaking of his own Ministry he said it is a privilege to operate myself under the Divine anointing of God's supreme power in whatever Ministry that he would choose that he would yeah chose for me to serve in so I'll say that again it is a privilege he's saying this for himself it is a privilege to operate myself under the Divine anointing of God's supreme power in whatever Ministry that he would chose for me to serve in I just serve the best that I can with all that I have to serve with can you say amen for David when he was when he was faced with the the giant he only had five stones but he would yield that to God he would serve his Ministry he would serve God in whatever he had right Lord Samson the same way shamard the same way all all of them they they whatever they had they it they serve god with what they had with what they had to use ain't that right so he says see I just serve the best that I can with all that I have to serve with and trusting that someday when it's all over over he will say it was well done how many wants God to save that amen I want God to save that about my life it is well done when it's all said and done it it doesn't matter if I preached a 10,000 or just one as long as it was in God's plan as long as I fulfilled the purpose that God has called me I just want to hear him say it's well done for I will hear the same word that the prophet will hear right amen I'll hear the words that you will hear well done can you say Amen so he says see he will say Well done See For What Little I had to do with For What Little I had to do with you don't have a lot you don't need a lot but just what little you have to do with he says I did the best that I could with what I had to do with so I'm trusting that he will understand stand and say Well done is what my desire is I me wants to hear him say Well done well done not not to look at you as some defeated or or uh uh uh I I know he ain't going to look at his bride as that way you may have your scars you may have your battle wounds and and you may have whatever but but that is a true Soldier they didn't just stand on the sidelines and let everybody else fight and let everybody else go through it and let everybody else why we just want to just uh uh skim our way through and and all that no everyone that faces God every one of God's soldiers are going to have Battle Scars they're going to have wounds they're they're going to have scars they're going to they're going to show they're going to have witnesses that they were a soldier in this thing be steadfast true and you say Amen see we're called to do something for the Lord this you know God has given us talents gifts he's given us the message for this day now here's the sobering thing what God has called us to do we will give an account to we will give an account to him for and so this is what brother brandham said we do everything we can reverently right that's what we want to do if if we're ministered you do it reverently you hold that office reverently if you're a deacon if you're a musician if you're just a lay member if you're just a janitor if you're just the a Manor if you're just a singer or whatever if you're just do you know using your 10 strings or I think brother brand called it you know just clapping hands amen whatever God has done you you take that reverently you do it with reverence we do everything we can reverently knowing that we'll have to answer from the least little gift unto the highest at the day of the judgment and I want to be found a good Steward of the Lord's business at that day how mean wants to be good stewards at that day well I want to be I I want to be a good Steward I want to be found faithful I want to be one that was there that stood the test and and kept pressing on regardless so we want to take our calling and our election seriously we want to take what God has called us to do seriously reverently can you say Amen now we know everyone has a different position we all are called to different places and positions and in the body of Christ different callings and and this is what Paul would tell us in Romans 12:4 breaking in as as as we have many members in one body and all men members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another so so we we we're all members of of something uh of the body within the body and and and they all go together to work for the body amen you might be the the little nerve you might be the nerve that gets on you know that hurts a lot you might be the liver you might be the heart you might be what whatever in the body but you you're part of the body you might be the little toenail on the little pinky but you're just as important as anyone else every part of the body has a function and it's a Ministry and if you don't think your little toe's important cut it off and see what happen happens yes it's it's there to help keep us balanced our big toe there to help keep us balanced where we can walk right ain't that right see every little part God put there not just for an addition he put there for a purpose well that's the same way in in in the body of Christ God wouldn't have put us there if if we didn't have a an important role in the body do you believe that amen now now the prophet says now the problem is is we're all wanting to take another person's place and and and and this is where the confusion is amen everybody wants to take another person's Place everybody is is is disregards the other person's place they want to take so they disregard their place they disregard the other person's Place uh there A lot of times there there's you know in in the natural there's a lot of disrespect uh am among this generation we we don't value the other person's place but also we don't value our own position and and then you know uh well you you know the way the world works and the spirit of the age that we're living in but we don't want to spend our time devaluing someone else but we also don't want to spend our time devaluing Who We Are amen and and we do that when we try to take somebody else position when we look and say well I'm just not I'm not getting enough Glory or I'm just not if you know uh I I'm you know I I I'm going to use this for the example but everybody you know God raised brother Andrew Glover you know and and uh uh to be a full-time evangelist he's got such a powerful Ministry God has blessed him in that way and how many young other young ministers want to be just like that oh and they feel like they're not doing much if if they're not doing what he's done but God never called them to be an Andrew Glover Andrew Glover didn't call him to be an Andrew Glover you understand God enabled him to do what he's doing to be what he is you understand what I'm saying so that doesn't take away from our ministry it doesn't take away from the teacher it doesn't take away from the pastor it doesn't take away amen from the helps of governments in the church ain't that right so so God may have called you to preach the gospel but he may have not called you to evangelize so quit trying to evangelize quit quit trying to be out there Wishing Well I wished I could be this and I wished I could do that and I wished I could do this and I you spend your whole life trying to be something else and wishing you were why not enjoy what God called you to be can you say Amen see we we don't want to be an impersonator God never called us to be an impersonator my my liver is not an impersonator my my little pinky on my is on my right left hand is not an impersonator of the right hand it it all goes together it all has a job it all has its own purpose hello you can still say Amen now see so we don't want to be an impersonator of others we want to do what God has called us to do and be steadfast in it can you say Amen see and and so uh now church we will only be effective we will only be effective in the place that God has called us to be my good friend uh Brother Scott Smith he once said to me he said you know God may have called you to pastor but he didn't call you to Pastor every church so then if he called me to Pastor in other words then it's not my choice to say well I'm called a pastor so what church do I want to Pastor God has called me to pastor but then I have to find out what where he wants me to Pastor you understand God May called you to be a musician to help in the church but then you have to find out where what church he's called you to be and then be steadfast see see God wants us all to be steadfast can you say Amen see so a man may do what God has called him to do but yet fail in doing that because he isn't where God wants him to be I'll say that again a man may do what God has called him to do but yet fail in that because he's not where God called him to be can you say Amen see see no one can take my place no one can take your place you can't take mine I can't take yours no matter how much I want to be brother Terry God's called me to preach the gospel God called you to preach the gospel but I can't live my life wishing to be you and you can't try to be me I can't take your we're both preachers brother Amos we're both preachers but I can't take brother amos's place he can't take my place if I try to be brother Amos and and being is God will never bless even though I'm called to be a preacher can you say Amen see so no one can take our place but what God has called us to do we must remember it is a special calling it's special how many believes that I I believe that that me being here it's a special it's an honor that God would Place me here because see if if if I say well I I want to be like someone else and I want to do what they're doing I want to be what they're doing and and and I'll fail in that while they're succeeding in it but as long as I can do and be where God wants me to be I will be successful and so will you can you say amen amen now first Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many right if the foot shall say well because I'm not the hand I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the ear shall say well because I'm not the eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were the hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him amen and you say Amen so we get discouraged sometimes so we want to quit sometimes so we want to just whatever and if we act upon our feelings if we act upon impulse no matter what we do in this life we're still going to give an account true amen no matter how unsuccessful you may feel in your ministry you just can't quit it because you're still going to give an account my feelings does not change God's mind about it the way I think it should or not should or whatever it ain't going to change God's mind so therefore I've got to be steadfast in whatever God has called us to do God has called me to do God called you to do you must be steadfast in that can you say Amen now every Son of God and I hope this all right tonight but every every Son of God has been given the authority that Jesus had do you believe that the same Authority amen you've been given the same Authority we have different callings different positions different Ministries but we all have the same Authority that Jesus had as sons of God brother Bram said from the least member in the body to the greatest we've all been given the same Authority Lord now to think of this of being steadfast uh it would require us then to be prisoners to Christ and you know there's different kinds of prisoners you can be a prisoner against your will but then brother Brandon would call us prisoners he said prisoners of love that's that's the difference God God doesn't have prisoners that are held against their will he has prisoners of love all right they're willful prisoners so you have to be a prisoner to him everybody say I have to be a prisoner if you're going to abound in the work of the Lord if you're going to stand immovable steadfast and abound you've got to be a prisoner to him and not a prisoner against your will but a prisoner of love to where it's it's a desire I love to be a Christian I love to do what he wants me to do see it it becomes a willful surrender it becomes a willful it it it's it's a uh uh it's something that you offer yourself so if a man is a l servant a l prisoner then he willfully surrenders everything the word volunteer is what I'm looking for you become the volunteer you willfully surrender everything to your master because you are a love servant you you you become a prisoner of love and so as loved Servants of Christ then we surrender our thoughts the prophet would say we surrender our own will our motives our desire because see when when we're put in the ministry then we don't run that Ministry based upon our own ideas and our own thoughts because you got to remember Jesus come to that place where he said if it be thy will father let this cup pass from me according to his flesh he did not want to go to Calvary amen but as a love slave as a prisoner of love he would say but nevertheless thy will be done he surrendered himself to the will of the father he surrendered his ambition he he surrendered his dream he surrendered everything right we we surrender as love servants as love slaves we surrender our goals we surrender our dreams our wants our desires can you say Amen say God God didn't call us to abound in what we want God didn't call us to abound in our own dreams and our own desires hello he wants us to abound in the work of the Lord whatever he called you to do abound in that sometimes it's going to go against your will sometimes it's going to it's going to cause you to cry out out your flesh to cry out and scream out if this cup if if it be your will let this let this cup pass from me I I don't want to face this but because you are a love slave you surrender and that's what God wants you to abound in abound in the work of the Lord be steadfast immovable always abounding Lord God didn't call us to be Dwarfs that's right he didn't call us to dry up he didn't call us to to walk away from his purpose so that we could do what we want to do and then when life gets easier we come back and and and and and no no that's not it um brother bran would call it wandering stars or uh the there's another word that he would use it to where we just Bounce from one place to another Bounce from one place to another it's it's kind of like where we we we we going from one Revival to another Revival wherever the move is that's where we want to be wherever the the wherever the thing is is is going that's where we want to be part of but sometimes that's not the part of God's will for you yeah Drifters so see so God doesn't want us to abound in what we want we are to abound in the work of the Lord now when we look look at Joseph in the Old Testament of course you look at his whole life his life was a um well it was ordained of God we see that it was predestined of God every everything about him uh because he was representative of Christ he didn't know he was he was just living his life and look at the ups and downs look at the times you know he was he was in anointed he had dreams he was loved of his father he even had the he was the the the the Lov loved one beloved one his father gave him the the the coat of many colors he he even his own Brothers noticed that he was loved more by his father than they were and and all these things so Joseph had an easy life at the beginning but but then then he was betrayed he was sold he was lied against right thrown into prison everything though of his life was ordained of God now brother brandham said see when he had come when Joseph come to the throne though all of this down here had a meaning it had a purpose to get him up here to the throne and brother brah said see he had power to bind at his own word speaking of Joseph remember he come out of prison and was exalted to the throne he had power to loose at his own word he could say I loose you in the name of my king see because Pharaoh made Joseph his son well see Christ makes his prisoners of love his sons and he gives them power the same kind he had Lord oh don't miss that don't miss that God giv you the power The Authority as Sons don't look at the insignificance of maybe you feel well I ain't getting anywhere well my Ministry is just not like everybody else but you're missing the fact that God gave you the same power so he said see he he gives them power the same thing he had St John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do see so now the prisoner of the love of Christ becomes empowered by his King who is Christ every prisoner of Love That is a prisoner to Christ becomes empowered by his King and verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you shall have what you said if you abide in me and my word abide in you if you're yoke to me because him and his word is the same in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us same yesterday today and forever so if you abide in me not in here and there but abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will or say what you will and it'll be done see he had power ain't that right see now he says now notice before he come out speaking of Joseph he had to be taken out and shaved ain't that right see a few things had to be shaved off before he could meet his King he says oh God sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few off of their own wheel uh shave a few of their own wheels off shows them that they can't do just what they wanted to do and you know what I mean they're not in Liberty to do what they want to do before they come into full power and to and be a love slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be can you say Amen a love slave see you got to abound in the work of the Lord you got to be a love slave you got to be willing to accept his will for your life you got to be willing to accept what he he's called you to do amen ain't that right I hope it makes sense to you tonight but see Moses Moses remember he was called but notice what a prophet said he had to forsake everything he knew forget all his training and everything in order to to know the will of God and to follow God he can't follow anything that man has got got to do and God see the same time you can't follow man and you can't follow God at the same time amen you can't abound in in in your dreams and your ideas and abound in the work of the Lord at the same time cuz somewhere our dreams are going to contradict the will of God for our lives our Ambitions our goals and everything else it's humanly speaking none of us want to go and and die out of Calvary none of us amen want to be rejected none of us want to go through the things that God has called us to do in a in a lot of ways sometimes you got to stand well brother Brown said a man that walks with God has to stand [Music] alone see so he can't follow anything that man has got to do and God the same time is too contrary one to another see our dreams our Ambitions our goals our whatever we want is too contrary to what God wants of us he said you can't be going right and left at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time you can't be following man and God at the same time you're either following God or you're following man and then if you're following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that God to that word to that will and no matter what anything else says you become a prisoner to it now you become abounding you're immovable steadfast can you say Amen now do you realize in as he's put us in the ministry as he's enabled us to fulfill the purpose we are ordained to be sons having authority over the devil you believe that but it's in your position remember brother brand talks about the the the missionary that wanted to go to Africa I think it was in Africa and he went to his board the board of his church denomination or whatever and he told him what he felt God had called him to do and they said oh you can't do that you can't take your family over there he had you know he had little children and and a wife and he said you can't do that there's malaria and there's this and and they just brought up all the dangers he said there ain't no way you can go and his reply was men Brethren all I know is God called me to go and I would be more safer over there in all of that in the will of God than I would be out outside the will of God can you say amen and and that's the same way if we're in the will of God be steadfast in that wheel be steadfast unmovable you're more safe there than you would be anywhere else amen because you're sons of God abounding in the work of God God doesn't leave you helpless sometimes you may feel helpless maybe you think oh God where you at what what's going on on what's Happening may you look at maybe we look at the church or maybe we look at our home maybe we look at our own lives and everything just you know it just doesn't seem to be the happening thing but if you can understand and know and and take the comfort that I am in the will of God and no matter what Devil comes my way I have that Authority Amen to defeat him you believe that you see I I I will tell you and you all know it the devil's going to try to knock you out of your place right he he'll get you to have a complex about yourself well I'm just I'm just not able I just I I just don't know I ain't worth much I ain't just this and I ain't yeah I I just don't know see that's the devil trying to knock you out of your place yeah but everybody laughs at me well they laughed at Jesus too amen they didn't see the significance of Jesus's Ministry but God did Satan is trying to defeat Us in every every aspect church it's almost home time and he's doing everything to try to stop us from coming into our purpose in Christ amen trying to get us discouraged to where we get out of our position he did it to Moses you say Amen look Moses met with God in the back of a mountain out in the desert God specifically told him what he was going called to do take my people you're the one that I've called to lead my people out of Egypt go to the promised land he had specific commission but when he got out of Egypt and bringing that people he got to the Red Sea and Satan thought he had Moses whipped Moses forgot about the commission he forgot about what God called him to do and he began to cry un God but God never looked at him and said well Moses it was my mistake I chose you no he told Moses why are you crying unto me I called you I told you what I've called you to do just be steadfast in it don't leave don't walk away don't falter don't let the enemy cause you to just to wilt I've called you Moses I put you there I'm enabling you ain't changed my mind amen can you say Amen it wasn't Moses now telling themy it was the enemy say I got you now Moses may have not felt the anointing he may have not felt that emotional rush in church he may have not felt like running around glorifying God and whoopee it didn't mean he wasn't called didn't mean he wasn't anointed he just had to stay there true can you say Amen so the devil thought that he had Moses defeated but the but but the Lord spoke to Moses in Exodus 14:15 saying wherefore cist thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward sometimes you you may not have a lot to say to people maybe you're going through a lot of things and maybe they're going through a lot of things and and and and you just don't know what to say but all you know is you got to come back to the word god called us God ordained us you got to stay fast with that word he said he would never leave us nor forsake us that he would be with us till the end of the world no doubt Moses began to talk to the people I don't understand what's going on I know it looks like we're about to fail it looks like the enemy's about to defeat us but I'm telling you God called us to come out look where he brought us this far look what he's done God is with us right right so speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward but lift thou up thy rod and stretch forth out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go and dry land through the midst of the sea you see God never called Moses to be defeated and he never called us to be defeated I say this he never called me to be defeated I don't care what the devil says I don't care what he breathes I don't I don't care the poisonous breath that he tries to breathe God never called Shawn Martin to be defeated and it didn't call you to be defeated he didn't call this church to be defeated can you say amen he didn't he didn't send Moses to do something then only for Moses to get sidetracked with what the enemy's doing what if Moses trying to lead but he's always wondering about what everybody else is doing and wherever the enemy is no he had to stay fast steadfast in what God called him to do just stay steadfast stay unmovable in the work of God can you say Amen don't forget the commission he called Moses to be successful praise the lord lord can you say amen amen why if Moses just threw up his hands and quit I give up I'm tired of this tired of the grumbling tired of the constant challenges just seem like everything just goes wrong every day I'm just tired of it I want to go somewhere else just I'll go to cazoo wherever that's at but one thing we see in Moses's life even through all of his mistakes is he was steadfast he remained steadfast IM movable Lord can you say Amen there was a Joshua and Caleb that made that that stayed steadfast with him can you say Amen I'm so glad that God brought him a prophet our way but I am more glad than ever that he stayed steadfast to the commission that God had given him every challenge he faced he stayed steadfast he showed us how to stay steadfast he believed in the commission that God gave him he truly believed in the mission that God had given him the commission can you say amen and because he believed in it he stood steadfast and I believe the same message I believe that we have been commissioned by the message by God and we must believe in that and stay steadfast we're going home I don't know how many more days we've got to live but stay steadfast could you imagine the very last hour of breath that we had and then we give up I don't want to be that way stay steadfast brother Bill the older I get then I realize I ain't got much time left I don't know even if I had 40 years 50 years that ain't much time I want to do everything that counts for God I want to be counted worthy of God I want to be counted faithful that when when I hear well done thou good and faithful well God ain't lying about me he ain't having to make up something he truly seen my life and saw me steadfast through all my ups and downs and my blunders and my failures and all of that I'm still remaining steadfast through the gospel and God wants to see you steadfast in the work that God has called you to do the glory is not here the glory is over there your rewards not here even though we we have a lot of we we we have blessings that God blesses us with and and and through our journey of life but the real we roar is not here it's over there can you amen that's right see so so God never called see and and and Moses knew the commission it amazes me how many people really don't know if God has sent them you know and so it's it's like they are the ones who decided what they're going to do for God they're the ones that decided to serve God they're the ones that's decided uh to come into the message they're the ones that's decided you understand what I'm saying and and then when the going gets rough then they're the ones that decides to quit and they are the ones that decides to abort and they are the ones that decides to give up on God and and all of these things you understand what I'm saying see and and it's because they have no vision uh uh as to their purpose in life that they have no vision as to what God has called you didn't stumble into this message God called you to this message I didn't stumble into being a preacher God called me to be a preacher God called you to be whatever God he called you to do it's not your choice don't lose the vision can you say Amen you see so they become fickle because they don't know their purpose purp it's it's though they think they're the ones that brought it they're the ones that believe they're the ones that decided and they become fickle because when the trials are there then they wither when the going is good then they come back and it's just back and forth and you cannot trust them with anything because they just may pick up and go on to something bigger and better anytime but God has called faithfulness God has called us to be steadfast you understand Church you you understand that God's called us and and and I know we get weary some sometimes it's a challenge it's a battle but we know we're children of God we know that we are the last age we know that we are a people that God has called out of a people we understand his purpose is calling God is not going to have a bride at the end of the age that is so ate up with bitterness and anguish and so us knowing that we're as I said Sunday we're we're in a we're in an age where there's no love brother brah said there's only love come to the place that only love will be found in the elect but that doesn't mean that it's a it's just something glorious and we're just like oh I'm so full of bitterness fights you just as much as it fights everybody else the thing is is you understand that no bitterness has a place in your heart you got to stay steadfast so you're continually fighting that thing you're fighting that unbelieving spirit because there ain't going to be a bride that's got unbelief in her you understand what I'm saying you you under you then we understand God's purpose therefore we're being steadfast in what God's purpose is is when that unbelieving Spirit tries to come in and we start trying to question the prophet all that we're steadfast to say no that's not what I'm called for amen you've taken the World by by storm but you ain't taking me by storm I'm steadfast in what God has called me to be I'm a son and daughter of God I'm his bride I'm The Virtuous spotless bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen see so then therefore and I'll close but the only way for a man to be steadfast and immovable is for him to receive a revelation from God as to what he is to do what God is purpose for him that must come as a revelation because did not Jesus say it would be only by Revelation that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against only Revelation is the only thing revelation is the only thing that the devil will not be able to Prevail against he can Prevail against gifts he can Prevail against any Ministry but when it comes to Revelation he cannot Prevail the Lord can you say amen amen so therefore what that means is that we cannot be caught in between two opinions and then remain steadfast yes Revelation takes all other opinions away all right amen hello cuz then you're anchored you you know beyond a shout of a doubt that's why you need to have Revelation it every every son and daughter of God must have revelation of God by God that they're a son and daughter of God I'm not a son because my my preacher told me I'm a son I'm not a son because the prophet told me I'm a son I'm a son because God revealed it to me that I am his son am hello so brother Brandon would say you need Revelation when it comes to your healing you need Revelation when it comes to your salvation you need Revelation it it takes Revelation brother Bram says this I think about healing he said if you can ever get yourself shook away from everything else right down to the word there you can build steadfast unmovable always abounding in the works of the Lord not tossed about from here and there trying every prayer line running up and down the streets this one and that one you'll be stable you'll say Lord I believe it because you said so and that settles it all demons out of Torment couldn't shake you away from it you know it see when God has once revealed it spiritually placed it in your heart that Jesus Christ died at Calvary to heal you you are well then all right because it's become a revelation then Satan can't take that away from you your symptoms no matter how bad you get there's a revelation says I'm well well that's the way with salvation it has to be a revelation you have the Holy Ghost that has to be a revelation to you you say well I got the Holy Ghost well how do you know that well cuz I cried I got excited now the Pentecostal way was I I I spoke in tongues I run all over the building I felt good well brothers and sisters there's going to be times that you don't feel good you're not going to run all over the building every service you understand what I'm saying so that Revelation has to be there then you become steadfast that's well so it is in the revelation of what God has for you so he says see when God has once revealed it spiritually placed it in your heart that Jesus Christ died at Calvary to heal you you're well amen no need of coming through any prayer line then you're well just like if every one every one time by the working of Holy Spirit God reveals to you that Jesus died in your stead and it's him Knocking at Your Heart Something's Happened down here in that little heart it's over right God give us Revelation amen can you say Amen now being that we're the last age we have great responsibility Weighing on our shoulders because all the Believers who have lived their life before us in the previous ages they're waiting on us to finish the race you believe it it's like it's like the relay race brother Branson you probably know more about it about the the the running the race but they you know one the race starts and one runs he's got a stick in his hand Paton I guess and he runs around there and he comes to that he come back to the point where he started I I believe but then he passes that he didn't win the race he passed it to another that baton to another Runner then that Runner takes off and he comes back and he passes it on to another and they keep passing it on I don't know how to how many but in this case there was seven runners that would run seven Church age Messengers that that would run and it's the last guy that has to be the strongest he has to be the best because all the responsibility now weighs upon his shoulders and everyone that ran in front of him is now resting in him and what he can do you understand if he can make it it they've made it and when he wins they win and Paul says they without us cannot be made perfect that's true every one of them that has run their race are now looking at us to win ours we're the last group we're the last ones therefore you must be steadfast in movable don't let Spirit of Deception come in discouragement come in don't let It Rock Your Boat don't let it make you shift and and start looking around at other ways and other places and other things you stay steadfast in the work of God for we as the prophet said we are the people who under our messenger are the final voice to the final age there will be no other people after us can you say Amen brother Bram said we are living in the rapturing age the Rapture age he says we are at the closing scene of the world's activities and fixing to enter into that great age that we've all looked for so long the Hebrew prophets have spoke of through the day can you say Amen another place he said it's the ending of time and the blending in of Eternity and church we don't have much time left you understand I know it it you know sometimes you just want to give up what's the use and all these things but you can't give up brother abah said it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any other age so what it means is this is not a cakewalk amen I looked up that word Cakewalk you know what the world Cakewalk it means it's not an easy task it's not going to be an easy victory can you say Amen in Matthew 11:12 Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence and the violent take it by force so you're not going to Coast into Victory you're going to take it can you say Amen if the musicians will come we will not fulfill God's purpose by playing around therefore you cannot not let this layot of spirit get upon you to where you just become satisfied with just a little church service satisfied with just a little thing may may we be so earnestly steadfast and immovable knowing our purpose God never called us to be weak God never called us to be just just halfway doing things church if we can't overcome the things of the world how we what are we doing if if we're being so more enticed into the the pleasures of life than we are into the things of God something wrong you understand what I'm saying but we're the ones that's called to defeat the Devil in every aspect in every way in everything you can overcome that pornography you can overcome that temper you can overcome the bitterness you can overcome all of these things be steadfast and unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord can you say amen amen that's right brother Braham said The Heirs of Promise Abraham Isaac and Jacob and many others they're looking forward to us not to fail for without us they cannot be made perfect they are depending on us let's not fail can you say Amen let's not fail don't get so wrapped up in all this worldly things let's not fail we got a commission don't get so carnal don't go get so wrapped up that you you you lose sight of prayer you lose sight of the things of God where your Ambitions are more on the world than it is of god can you say Amen oh I love the Lord do you love him I love him we could go on and on but be steadfast unmovable in the work of God Amen I'm not turn around by the grace of God I'll wear a shining crown somay and I'll keep holding on oh yes to the nail scarred hand I'm not given up no I'll keep hold let's sing it now with all our hearts oh I'm not
