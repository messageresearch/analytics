[1:09:33] broken we just all worship and love the
[1:09:36] Lord and I'm I'm so thankful for that
[1:09:40] and U we're here for a a special uh
[1:09:45] occasion u a lot of you all and and that
[1:09:49] is uh the dedication of U
[1:09:52] shuel and uh brother shmaya and and
[1:09:55] sister Bethany uh uh their little one
[1:09:59] that God's blessed them with and um I'm
[1:10:02] going to just read a scripture here and
[1:10:06] um it's there in Mark the 10th
[1:10:09] chapter and
[1:10:11] um the 13th verse we'll start there but
[1:10:16] it says and they brought young children
[1:10:19] to him that he should touch them and his
[1:10:24] disciples rebuked those that brought
[1:10:27] them but when Jesus saw it he was much
[1:10:30] displeased and said unto them suffer the
[1:10:33] little children to come unto me and
[1:10:36] forbid them not for of such is the
[1:10:39] kingdom of God verily verily I say unto
[1:10:42] you whosoever shall not receive the
[1:10:45] kingdom of God as a little
[1:10:47] child he shall not enter
[1:10:50] therein and he took them up in his arms
[1:10:55] and put his hands upon them and blessed
[1:10:58] them Lord all through the scriptures we
[1:11:01] can see the heart of God toward
[1:11:05] children and um the Young Generation to
[1:11:09] come is an important to the Lord and
[1:11:13] he's taught us as parents to teach our
[1:11:16] children teach them not just anything
[1:11:19] that we would want but teach them the
[1:11:21] way of God teach them the acts of the
[1:11:25] Lord Lord teach them about the Miracles
[1:11:27] that had happened teach them of the
[1:11:30] things that God has done not just in the
[1:11:33] past but what he's doing in the present
[1:11:36] that when they would grow up and they
[1:11:38] would have their children that they
[1:11:39] could just keep passing this alone and
[1:11:42] they could experience the same God that
[1:11:44] we've experienced and experience the
[1:11:47] same God that our grandparents
[1:11:48] experienced and it it's it's through
[1:11:51] generations that God is preserved his
[1:11:54] testimony his righteousness his acts are
[1:11:57] preserved and I'm so glad that we have a
[1:12:00] Young Generation rising up and um
[1:12:04] children are a blessing unto the Lord
[1:12:07] and sometimes you know um in the age
[1:12:10] that we're living in they're going
[1:12:12] through so much and Satan is attacking
[1:12:15] our young people like never before and
[1:12:18] um I think that behooves us as parents
[1:12:21] to walk very softly before the Lord and
[1:12:24] and just ask for his help his guidance
[1:12:27] his wisdom and um and to put up with our
[1:12:31] children amen and to let them know that
[1:12:35] God loves them let them know that
[1:12:38] they're special let them know you know I
[1:12:40] know we it's easy to let them know what
[1:12:42] they're not doing and and uh what they
[1:12:45] should be doing and but one thing about
[1:12:47] it never never forget to let them know
[1:12:50] that they are beloved of God and God has
[1:12:54] chose them for this generation to carry
[1:12:57] on the message that God has brought and
[1:13:01] I know that if God carries that we as
[1:13:04] you know Elders you know we're not going
[1:13:07] to be around much longer you know I mean
[1:13:09] we got some years I'm not putting doom
[1:13:11] on you you're going to die today but uh
[1:13:14] what I am saying is we're investing in
[1:13:17] this Young Generation amen because uh
[1:13:21] they're going to be pastors one of these
[1:13:23] days singers Housewives and musicians
[1:13:26] and whatever the Lord would have them
[1:13:28] amen to be and so we're so happy for
[1:13:32] brother shamiah and sister Bethany and
[1:13:35] love them dearly and um you know I've I
[1:13:40] guess been here for 13 years now and um
[1:13:45] as most of us know they weren't able to
[1:13:48] have children and been looking you know
[1:13:51] always that desire to have a child and
[1:13:55] even though they had their ups and downs
[1:13:58] and discouragements as we all do they
[1:14:01] still maintained the testimony that
[1:14:04] God's going to give us a
[1:14:05] child and many
[1:14:08] times brother shemiah he would talk not
[1:14:12] as if he's God's going to give it to us
[1:14:14] but when he's going to give it to us and
[1:14:18] he would be under such expectation for
[1:14:20] this and uh I've always admired that
[1:14:23] faith that he had and uh when he told us
[1:14:29] that sister Bethany was expecting I
[1:14:32] thought there there it is God honored
[1:14:35] the faith God proves once again he's God
[1:14:39] Alone he's God Alone amen and I'm so
[1:14:43] glad to serve that kind of a God Amen
[1:14:46] and God
[1:14:48] honoring honoring that that faith and
[1:14:52] they've gone through such a journey
[1:14:55] um you know it looked like maybe that
[1:14:58] sister Bethany wouldn't be able to have
[1:15:00] the child and um she was in danger of in
[1:15:05] her own body and I know what it was it's
[1:15:09] just the devil trying to fight and we
[1:15:11] could look say well she's older and and
[1:15:13] this I just looked at it as Satan was
[1:15:15] trying to take a promise and um but they
[1:15:19] had the Child 3 months 3 months early
[1:15:23] and a pound and a half
[1:15:25] and uh that little baby you know you
[1:15:28] could just basically put him in your
[1:15:30] palm of your hand and and um but that
[1:15:35] set off a journey and they were 3 months
[1:15:37] in the hospital with that that the baby
[1:15:41] and ups and downs the doctors would give
[1:15:43] them bad reports and what to expect that
[1:15:46] would be bad and brain bleeds and such
[1:15:49] and such and you know when talk to them
[1:15:52] and and said well we're just believing
[1:15:54] God to to to to take care of it and God
[1:15:58] did take care of it God did and uh it it
[1:16:02] just surprised even the doctors of what
[1:16:05] God did but we knew what God was doing
[1:16:08] because God had already promised the
[1:16:10] baby it was a miracle to begin with and
[1:16:14] uh so here he is today he's 13 lbs I
[1:16:19] believe and um uh they've they've not
[1:16:23] been able to this is sister Bethany is
[1:16:25] actually first time coming to church uh
[1:16:28] today out of all these months and um the
[1:16:32] doctor wanted them to stay home till the
[1:16:35] baby was able to develop and uh so
[1:16:38] theyve they've gone through a tremendous
[1:16:41] journey and uh that God has kept them
[1:16:44] and um I have just marveled and to see
[1:16:48] God just taking care of him stage each
[1:16:52] stage each each part of the journey and
[1:16:55] here they are today and we're just so
[1:16:57] delighted to have them and have little
[1:16:59] shoe bile amen and um we uh I want to uh
[1:17:05] ask brother
[1:17:07] Sandy uh brother uh shmay is uh father

[1:33:38] without weight for it is in an abundance

[1:33:52] Solomon thanks buddy moreover there are
[1:33:55] workmen with thee in abundance there's
[1:33:57] lots of help hewers and workers of stone
[1:34:00] and Timber and all manner of cunning men
[1:34:04] for every manner of work of the gold and
[1:34:08] the silver and the brass and the iron
[1:34:10] there is no
[1:34:11] number arise
[1:34:13] therefore and be doing and the Lord be
[1:34:17] with thee amen let's just pray one more
[1:34:20] time Heavenly Father we've read your
[1:34:23] word today day and uh we can see the
[1:34:25] great Storehouse of goods that you've
[1:34:27] put up that David had uh been provided
[1:34:30] Lord to create a tabernacle unto the
[1:34:34] Living God and and Lord We've Come Today
[1:34:36] father as Tabernacles your Tabernacles
[1:34:40] Lord knowing that you've provided
[1:34:42] everything we have need of for this
[1:34:44] journey so Lord we just ask now that you
[1:34:46] would bless the word that it would uh
[1:34:49] speak to our hearts today Father open
[1:34:52] our eyes that we might see
[1:34:54] and if there be any Shadow of Doubt I
[1:34:56] pray father that you would cast it out
[1:34:59] in the name of Jesus that your word
[1:35:01] would Prevail we ask it believing in
[1:35:04] Jesus name and the church
[1:35:06] says amen Now set your heart and your
[1:35:10] soul to seek the Lord your God Arise
[1:35:14] therefore and build ye the sanctuary of
[1:35:17] the Lord you may have your seats if
[1:35:18] you'd like to bring the Ark of the
[1:35:21] Covenant of the Lord and the holy
[1:35:22] vessels of God into the house to be
[1:35:25] built to the name of the Lord amen now
[1:35:29] this was a David was getting ready uh to
[1:35:32] build a temple and we knew that uh he
[1:35:34] was living in this great House of Cedar
[1:35:37] and it was perfect uh he had uh nearly
[1:35:40] conquered all of his enemies and he was
[1:35:43] at rest and his mind was thinking I want
[1:35:46] to do something for the Lord I want to
[1:35:48] he's he's his Tabernacle is over there
[1:35:50] in a a tabernacle of skins and uh we we
[1:35:53] can do better than that Hallelujah and
[1:35:56] so he set out to build this Temple now
[1:36:00] uh David being a man of war God said uh
[1:36:03] you know David you've collected God
[1:36:05] bless you but I'm not going to have you
[1:36:07] build the temple seeing you're a a a man
[1:36:10] of war but I'm going to get your son to
[1:36:12] erect this Temple amen but in through
[1:36:16] David's Journey he had collected a great
[1:36:18] abundance of wealth and and I've just
[1:36:20] got some uh um statistics kind of
[1:36:23] written here 100,000 talant of gold
[1:36:27] weighs approximately 3.4 million
[1:36:31] kilograms or 3,400 metric tons it's 7.5
[1:36:36] million pounds of gold and Rome thinks
[1:36:39] they've got gold well David had a bunch
[1:36:41] and the value is around
[1:36:44] 218 billion
[1:36:46] us hallelujah that's a bit of money and
[1:36:49] that's just the gold and silver was a 1
[1:36:52] million talents which had a value of
[1:36:55] about 26.4 us billion dollar in total
[1:36:59] the worth was nearly
[1:37:03] 240 uh billion dollars uh that David had
[1:37:07] acquired you know it wasn't just you
[1:37:09] know his little Treasure Chest that he
[1:37:10] opened up and well here it is but I
[1:37:12] think they would have had to have some
[1:37:14] structures uh to to keep this stuff now
[1:37:17] my my dad's been preaching on gold and
[1:37:19] how gold just doesn't tarnish it it
[1:37:21] doesn't fail if you get perfect 20 4
[1:37:24] karat gold it lasts forever and and you
[1:37:28] know the trials of our faith is more
[1:37:31] precious than that gold even though it
[1:37:33] be tried in the fire what a value God
[1:37:36] has placed on this Temple that he's
[1:37:40] building in you and I
[1:37:42] hallelujah amen so David David had
[1:37:45] accumulated a great Storehouse of goods
[1:37:47] and uh and he built up all the necessary
[1:37:50] wealth and the materials to build on
[1:37:52] this temple of God and men dwelling in
[1:37:54] houses and Tents but where dwells the
[1:37:57] Lord amen and you know I could imagine
[1:38:00] David as he's getting prepared to uh
[1:38:02] speak this uh uh encouraging the people
[1:38:05] he says all you have need of is already
[1:38:09] been provided for the next step of your
[1:38:11] journey God has supplied it all can we
[1:38:14] say Amen we've got the finances we've
[1:38:17] got the materials we have the god-given
[1:38:19] talent Hallelujah we've got the wisdom
[1:38:23] every everything is here God has
[1:38:26] provided for the building of the temple
[1:38:28] now it it didn't come easy there were a
[1:38:31] lot of sleepless nights David fought
[1:38:33] many of battles to get that accumulation
[1:38:36] of of goods to build this Great temple
[1:38:39] of God you know I I could just just
[1:38:41] think of those battles that that he
[1:38:43] would have fought and at times the odds
[1:38:45] to win were utterly
[1:38:47] impossible but God he promised to fight
[1:38:51] our battles aren't you grateful
[1:38:53] Hallelujah
[1:38:54] I can hear David encouraging those
[1:38:55] people saying often I would remember how
[1:38:58] God was with Joshua how Victory came to
[1:39:01] him as long as he stayed in his
[1:39:04] commission oh a bit of a warning there
[1:39:06] Hallelujah he how how he took great
[1:39:09] walled cities crossed the Seas routed
[1:39:12] the enemies with impossible odds even to
[1:39:15] the stopping of the sun hallelujah amen
[1:39:19] sometimes we can almost stop time when
[1:39:20] we're on our knees in prayer and and you
[1:39:22] know the enemy is maybe just right there
[1:39:25] and and well Lord I need just a little
[1:39:27] more time and and so you go to praying
[1:39:30] and it seems as though time just stand
[1:39:32] still for you Hallelujah because we've
[1:39:34] got an enemy that we're after sometimes
[1:39:37] and we're not going to settle for just
[1:39:39] about taking care of most of the enemy
[1:39:41] but we want a total Deliverance
[1:39:43] hallelujah we're looking for full
[1:39:45] Victory can we say amen amen many were
[1:39:50] the afflictions of David Hallelujah but
[1:39:52] God delivered him from the all
[1:39:55] Hallelujah we fought many of battles and
[1:39:57] at times the odds was impossible but God
[1:40:00] has been our captain amen I can hear
[1:40:03] David encouraging the people often I
[1:40:05] would remember about Joshua Hallelujah
[1:40:08] David encouraging himself just like
[1:40:11] Joshua I too was anointed Samuel came
[1:40:15] and he honored me though I was forgotten
[1:40:18] by my daddy and by all of them but yet
[1:40:20] God knew that I was going to be the one
[1:40:23] needed to take this position Hallelujah
[1:40:26] you maybe feel sometimes like you go
[1:40:28] unnoticed like God doesn't even see that
[1:40:30] you're there but he knows his timing is
[1:40:34] always perfect he's just waiting for the
[1:40:36] moment and he will come speak to you you
[1:40:38] could just pull it down here little
[1:40:39] brother Judah
[1:40:40] Hallelujah because God always knows amen
[1:40:44] hallelujah through David's life he would
[1:40:47] have been encouraging them our hardest
[1:40:49] battles were those of distraction
[1:40:53] Hallelujah when we got distracted from
[1:40:56] the true work of what we were supposed
[1:40:58] to do we would be fighting that great
[1:41:01] battle in our thoughts but God had
[1:41:04] promised and never once failed I learned
[1:41:07] David did that we must look to what is
[1:41:10] true no matter how impossible it may
[1:41:13] seem now we're human and there may be
[1:41:16] moments when my own men David speaking
[1:41:19] even myself second guessed their
[1:41:21] callings Hallelujah there's moments in
[1:41:24] life where you know we get moved aside
[1:41:26] and we see that it seems
[1:41:35] like that's not it just wait God will
[1:41:38] bring it to pass according to his will
[1:41:41] you know the scripture says to wait I
[1:41:44] say wait upon the Lord hallelujah be of
[1:41:47] good courage and he will strengthen thy
[1:41:50] heart Hallelujah so we have to be
[1:41:52] careful that the devil doesn't talk us
[1:41:54] out of our callings because he knows
[1:41:57] that we are powerful in our callings
[1:41:59] Hallelujah God has Place certain gifts
[1:42:02] in your life for a reason he didn't make
[1:42:05] a mistake by having you come to earth
[1:42:07] right now you know he could have had
[1:42:09] Elijah for this moment brother he he
[1:42:11] could have had Joshua come today but God
[1:42:13] didn't choose those God chose you to be
[1:42:15] here today Hallelujah God predestines
[1:42:18] his word by bringing it to pass
[1:42:20] Hallelujah so today is the day of our
[1:42:22] visit
[1:42:23] today the day that God needs you to be
[1:42:25] standing in your position ready to take
[1:42:28] the battle it's not a time for another
[1:42:30] but it's your time to arise and be doing
[1:42:34] Hallelujah do you believe that so I
[1:42:36] wouldn't let the devil talk you out of
[1:42:38] your moments I wouldn't allow him to get
[1:42:40] you to sway off into some deep end
[1:42:42] Hallelujah but I would stay instant and
[1:42:45] honest I would be saying Lord here I am
[1:42:49] I'm not going to make my own way but
[1:42:50] Lord I'm ready when you call when you
[1:42:53] call I want to be ready Hallelujah
[1:42:55] myself not being a minister often I've
[1:42:58] got to be ready when I'm called
[1:43:00] Hallelujah I can't just you know uh sit
[1:43:02] back and let everything go easy and then
[1:43:04] all of a sudden get a phone call and
[1:43:06] okay tomorrow I'm preaching it just
[1:43:08] wouldn't work that way but I've got to
[1:43:10] be prepared amen whether I get used a
[1:43:13] lot or whether I get used a little I'm
[1:43:15] I'm perfectly content to be just a shiny
[1:43:17] Little Penny in his hand because I'm in
[1:43:20] his hand then hallelujah it doesn't
[1:43:22] matter to me if I'm a silver dollar
[1:43:24] Hallelujah can we say amen hallelujah
[1:43:27] there's a lot of times that that human
[1:43:30] nature it usually happens to young men
[1:43:31] around 25 Hallelujah where we really
[1:43:34] start thinking that we are something
[1:43:36] We're Young we're strong we don't wake
[1:43:38] up sore Hallelujah we might think it's
[1:43:41] tough when the kid keeps us up for an
[1:43:42] hour praise the Lord but really we're
[1:43:45] just in the learning
[1:43:47] stages
[1:43:49] Hallelujah bless the Lord and we're
[1:43:52] learning that you know uh uh being
[1:43:53] married sometimes it's really important
[1:43:55] to come home and do the dishes brother
[1:43:58] brandom taught us that didn't he there
[1:44:00] was that moment he come home and it was
[1:44:02] just not quite settled down and mom

[1:46:21] somebody it's okay I'm going home on
[1:46:25] Monday amen David could think back in
[1:46:29] zle as he's
[1:46:30] encouraging uh those that were're going
[1:46:32] to build on the temple you can read it
[1:46:35] in 1st Samuel 30 the very time that we
[1:46:38] stood on the battlefield on the opposing
[1:46:41] side of our
[1:46:42] brothers oh just think of that how he's
[1:46:46] encouraging the Saints you know we we
[1:46:48] got into a odd position here and uh here
[1:46:52] we were and our brothers over there but
[1:46:55] somehow God rich in Mercy helped us to
[1:46:59] avoid that conflict oh aren't you
[1:47:01] grateful when God moves on the scene
[1:47:03] when our our human emotion sometimes
[1:47:05] gets us into a spot that is not right
[1:47:08] and but God comes and rescues us
[1:47:11] hallelujah they paid a bit of a price
[1:47:14] they got back to their homes and what
[1:47:15] did they find everything Burnt Over zle
[1:47:19] was nearly a desert Place their wives
[1:47:21] and their children and and all their
[1:47:23] dogs and everything was gone oh what a
[1:47:26] what a
[1:47:28] Time Hallelujah the anguish and the
[1:47:30] thoughts that almost destroyed us all
[1:47:33] but God rich in Mercy we called on the
[1:47:36] name of the Lord and surrendered our own
[1:47:39] thinking and asked for his guidance and
[1:47:42] God Mighty in battle came and brought
[1:47:44] back our families out of
[1:47:47] slavery you know some of them were maybe
[1:47:50] addicted with drugs and some of of them
[1:47:53] was wasting their time maybe gaming and
[1:47:55] and some of them was enticed out into
[1:47:58] the world with the Fashions but we as a
[1:48:01] great Army of Believers commissioned by
[1:48:04] God Ran after them with prayer and we
[1:48:06] fought a bloody battle Hallelujah before
[1:48:09] the fight we felt all washed up and and
[1:48:12] David's men was even in a position to
[1:48:14] Stone him
[1:48:15] Hallelujah but we prayed and we fasted
[1:48:18] he's telling his people calling on the
[1:48:20] name of the Lord there was a group of
[1:48:23] them that wasn't even able to make the
[1:48:24] full Journey because we get tired
[1:48:27] sometimes In the Flesh it wasn't their
[1:48:29] faith it just was that natural human
[1:48:32] side it just got wore down can we say
[1:48:34] that happens sometimes the
[1:48:36] disappointments and the things that
[1:48:38] happens in human life it just gets us
[1:48:40] tired but you know as a body we just
[1:48:43] agree and we pray together we had a
[1:48:45] great testimony today of the little boy
[1:48:47] that was a a gift from God every child
[1:48:49] is but this one's just magnificent
[1:48:51] Hallelujah amen a Binding Together you
[1:48:55] know a
[1:48:56] closeness to pray there's a need there's
[1:49:00] a child that's a a three months
[1:49:03] premature just a tiny little
[1:49:06] being let's bind together they need our
[1:49:09] help God will strengthen them
[1:49:12] hallelujah oh bless the Lord so they
[1:49:15] agreed to leave some of them back there
[1:49:17] praying and seeking God on on our behalf
[1:49:21] that David and those remaining could go
[1:49:23] forward and and overcome the effects of
[1:49:27] Lady AA Hallelujah though they were
[1:49:29] small in number yet God caused a great
[1:49:32] defeat on the devil and restored back
[1:49:35] all of our loved ones Hallelujah it was
[1:49:38] a great battle but our families was
[1:49:40] restored now arise all of you up and be
[1:49:43] doing Hallelujah for all you have need
[1:49:47] of in life's journey God has already
[1:49:49] provided for you Amen in Isaiah 52: one
[1:49:53] the Bible says awake awake put on thy
[1:49:56] strength o Zion put on thy beautiful
[1:49:59] garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for
[1:50:02] henceforth there shall no more come unto
[1:50:05] thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
[1:50:08] Shake thyself from the dust arise and
[1:50:11] sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from
[1:50:15] the bands of thy neck oh captive
[1:50:17] Daughter of Zion I found this so
[1:50:20] interesting to arise and sit down it
[1:50:23] just made me think now to arise is to
[1:50:26] stand and in this context that that part
[1:50:29] to sit down means not be moved establish
[1:50:33] yourself fortify your thinking
[1:50:36] Hallelujah loose means to be freed to
[1:50:39] loosen to open oneself so turn loose
[1:50:44] yourself God has equipped you shake
[1:50:47] yourself you have over every weapon to
[1:50:51] overcome Hallelujah
[1:50:53] aren't you grateful amen we know that
[1:50:56] there was a brother brandom talked about
[1:50:58] that serpent with its charm and and how
[1:51:00] you know its eyes would would look up
[1:51:02] and and there would be that little bird
[1:51:04] that would be flying over and and if it
[1:51:06] could make eye contact with that bird
[1:51:08] right it would just slowly seduce that
[1:51:11] down into its clutches and and it would
[1:51:14] it would be killed and brother branam he
[1:51:17] typed that so many times to us and our
[1:51:20] lives with that lady of SC an atmosphere
[1:51:23] that's all around in the world aren't
[1:51:24] you grateful you can come to church and
[1:51:26] it helps you just focus your eyes off a
[1:51:28] lady you seea Hallelujah that charm of
[1:51:31] the devil that comes into our lives
[1:51:33] sometimes you know it could be just
[1:51:34] something small uh maybe it's a message
[1:51:36] you get from somebody at work and and it
[1:51:39] gets your mind thinking or maybe it was
[1:51:41] a a person you went to school with that
[1:51:43] all of a sudden resurfaces and the
[1:51:45] memories come back of back when you was
[1:51:47] living in a darkened State back when you
[1:51:50] had that Amnesia still on your eyes and
[1:51:52] the Devil's coming and gripping at you
[1:51:54] trying to seduce you back into the
[1:51:57] things of the
[1:51:58] world it's actually really quite simple
[1:52:00] to break that you just have to look up
[1:52:04] you know and see Jesus and the powers of
[1:52:07] Lady AA are totally broken just take
[1:52:10] your eyes off of that whatever is
[1:52:13] pulling you away from God when you get
[1:52:15] down into your prayer closet how many of
[1:52:17] us pray sometimes I made it pretty
[1:52:20] simple sometimes right we pray sometimes
[1:52:22] s amen and we go to we kneel down and
[1:52:25] we're getting ready to pray and all of a
[1:52:27] sudden you know we just get started dear
[1:52:29] Lord thank you for and then that phone
[1:52:31] just
[1:52:32] reverberates oh I didn't put it on like
[1:52:35] it's silent but it's vibrating and maybe
[1:52:38] it's something a bad need oh the devil
[1:52:41] all of a sudden makes you feel really
[1:52:43] spiritual I better check it Hallelujah
[1:52:46] and trying to get you away from
[1:52:48] fellowship with God hallelujah but
[1:52:51] David's telling us to arise build on the
[1:52:55] temple don't be distracted right nor
[1:52:57] left but look to the temple build on the
[1:53:01] temple later on we found out

[1:53:08] have Isaac with me amen and uh he's our
[1:53:11] Miracle boy we just about lost him at

[1:53:19] him a mighty warrior for the faith amen

[1:53:31] yet but you give them a few years girls
[1:53:34] and maybe we'll come back Hallelujah and
[1:53:37] then be
[1:53:41] careful to break the charm of the devil
[1:53:44] to get our eyes off of Lady AIA to get
[1:53:47] our eyes to focus in on what are we here
[1:53:50] for God has brought you here for a
[1:53:52] purpose do you believe that brother
[1:53:54] brandom he preaches the message I forget
[1:53:56] the title of it right now and he starts
[1:53:57] it off saying that the the roof trusses
[1:54:01] are for a purpose you know the house is
[1:54:03] for a purpose they didn't just build it
[1:54:05] here haphazard for nothing the vehicle
[1:54:07] wasn't wasted materials but those
[1:54:10] materials was put together for a purpose
[1:54:13] and God has you here right now for a
[1:54:16] purpose you're not just here to use air

[1:54:38] of the hour that's restored all the
[1:54:40] truth back hallelujah oh bless the Lord
[1:54:43] but you know a gold mine isn't any good
[1:54:45] if you just sit on it I've got the
[1:54:48] message Hallelujah but I don't read it
[1:54:51] it's just not going to help you
[1:54:52] Hallelujah you've got to dig into a gold
[1:54:55] mine to get its wealth out of there
[1:54:57] Hallelujah so so dig down or dig those

[1:55:18] losing battle and my dad always calls
[1:55:20] him a dumb devil he always keeps coming
[1:55:23] back and thinking that he's going to win

[1:55:39] in your mind things that were seemed
[1:55:41] like Mighty mountains but God came and

[1:55:50] last hour to arise amen and to be doing
[1:55:54] you are the one that is designed for
[1:55:56] this
[1:55:58] hour to take the Rapture Hallelujah God
[1:56:02] could have called somebody else he could
[1:56:04] have had but he didn't choose anybody
[1:56:06] else he chose you he knew that you would
[1:56:10] be made of the right materials you know
[1:56:13] when you're building a house you don't
[1:56:14] want the insulation showing up on the

[1:56:57] slain can we say Amen that made us
[1:56:59] sinless spotless perfect and white that
[1:57:02] we could take a Rapture it's not my

[1:59:13] amen so I can't lose you know when
[1:59:15] Joshua went to the walls of Jericho he
[1:59:17] met the angel it was a he he was totally
[1:59:20] convinced in his position
[1:59:23] he pulled his sword out and he said are
[1:59:25] you for us or are you against
[1:59:28] us and the angel just stood there so
[1:59:32] proud said I am the captain of the host
[1:59:37] of Israel the Lord and you know the
[1:59:39] angel did something that was really
[1:59:41] quite odd but it caught Joshua's
[1:59:44] attention he knew the Vindication he had
[1:59:47] heard this before the angel said take
[1:59:50] off your shoes yeah for you're standing
[1:59:52] on Holy Ground Joshua would have thought
[1:59:55] I've heard that testimony before this is
[1:59:59] the mighty one that was in the burning
[2:00:00] bush and he is right here right now and
[2:00:03] we are going to take this Jericho
[2:00:05] hallelujah oh bless the Lord the enemy
[2:00:10] shivering they're a little bit nervous
[2:00:13] because someone is taking God at his
[2:00:17] word
[2:00:18] hallelujah in the message of seeking
[2:00:21] after Jesus brother brandom says and now
[2:00:22] listen to this close any Divine promise
[2:00:25] of God the right mental attitude towards
[2:00:26] any Divine promise of God will we know
[2:00:29] this quote if you could if you can look
[2:00:32] at it right and believe it in that way
[2:00:35] that it's written say God it's your word
[2:00:40] so so now we're not just believing for a
[2:00:42] million dollars you know he promised
[2:00:45] that the righteous wouldn't beg for
[2:00:46] bread but he didn't promise to give you
[2:00:48] a million dollars all right but we got
[2:00:50] to look at what this says right here and
[2:00:53] now stand on that promise not some
[2:00:55] imagination not not some uh
[2:00:59] denominational Rich get rich type of a
[2:01:01] pay your tithe and offering type thing
[2:01:03] Hallelujah you've got something so much
[2:01:05] richer than what that is anyways you've
[2:01:07] got the truth and the truth is making
[2:01:10] you free the truth's going to bring you
[2:01:12] into a Rapture I don't care if I if I
[2:01:14] lose my house if I if I lose my vehicles
[2:01:17] I've got Jesus I don't need all of that
[2:01:19] to make it in a Rapture it makes it a
[2:01:21] little easier down here sure and I work
[2:01:23] hard I've got two businesses and and I
[2:01:25] work 60 hours a week most times I
[2:01:28] believe in hard work you ought to work
[2:01:30] hard if you're not working you better
[2:01:32] get a job right message Believers
[2:01:34] shouldn't be on Social Security unless
[2:01:36] they have to be Hallelujah so work
[2:01:39] hard arise and be doing if you're
[2:01:42] building on the temple it's going to be
[2:01:44] work you're going to get a little sweaty

[2:01:51] the Lord
[2:01:52] and only one Angel and it's not

[2:01:59] Courage for a mom to stand in those
[2:02:02] times of of uh uh complex teenage issues
[2:02:06] but I'll say this as a teenage person if
[2:02:09] there's some here you don't have to be
[2:02:12] like the
[2:02:13] world you can be better than that
[2:02:16] because you've got the Holy Ghost
[2:02:18] Hallelujah anointing your flesh you
[2:02:20] don't have to go through those ups and
[2:02:22] downs and
[2:02:23] emotions Oh They'll be there they're

[2:04:39] god of Jacob for his help whose hope is
[2:04:41] in the Lord his God which made heavens
[2:04:44] and earth the sea and all that therein
[2:04:46] is which keepeth truth forever which
[2:04:49] executeth judgment for the oppressed
[2:04:52] which giveth food to the hungry the Lord
[2:04:55] loosest the
[2:04:56] Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of
[2:04:59] the blind the Lord raiseth them that are
[2:05:02] bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous
[2:05:06] the Lord preserveth The Strangers he

[2:05:22] but God will be ready and forthcoming to
[2:05:24] those who are in the lowest circumstance
[2:05:27] our miseries will be no barrier in the
[2:05:30] way of his helping us aren't you

[2:05:51] or he might call the musicians on
[2:05:56] me David commissioned the people now set
[2:06:00] your heart and your soul to seek the
[2:06:02] Lord your
[2:06:04] God Arise therefore and build ye the
[2:06:08] sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the
[2:06:10] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the
[2:06:13] holy vessels of God into the house Lord
[2:06:16] that is to be built to the name of the
[2:06:18] Lord hallelujah the Bible tells us in
[2:06:21] first Corinthians 6:19 what know ye not
[2:06:25] that your body is the Temple of the Holy
[2:06:27] Ghost which is in you which ye have of
[2:06:32] God and ye are not your own amen you're
[2:06:36] a temple you are the house of God's
[2:06:40] prayer
[2:06:41] Hallelujah you are the house of God's
[2:06:45] praise amen you know the world doesn't
[2:06:49] have any hope outside of you
[2:06:53] bless the Lord your neighbors don't have
[2:06:55] any hope outside of your testimony let
[2:06:58] them do something good for you God will
[2:07:01] reward them for that amen God has put up
[2:07:05] great stores of goods to bring to
[2:07:08] fruition the faith muscles they're
[2:07:11] already within you but they're getting
[2:07:14] exercised exercise for that Rapture
[2:07:18] Hallelujah God's putting up great stores
[2:07:20] it's not complicated Hallelujah we don't
[2:07:24] have to do Penance and beat ourselves
[2:07:26] and torture ourselves when we make
[2:07:28] mistakes we just have to say Lord I'm
[2:07:32] sorry end our
[2:07:34] eyes try again amen hallelujah did you
[2:07:37] know that there's only one difference
[2:07:39] between the righteous and the
[2:07:41] unrighteous they both
[2:07:43] fall but the righteous gets up again the
[2:07:47] only difference is the getting up again
[2:07:50] so fall doesn't separate you from the
[2:07:53] love of God
[2:07:55] hallelujah it's the getting up again
[2:07:57] part so I'm encouraging you
[2:08:00] today there might not be in a trial now
[2:08:03] but the next one that comes along just
[2:08:06] remember this trial is not to break me
[2:08:09] it's not to destroy me but it's to chip
[2:08:12] me and to make me into that perfect
[2:08:14] image of Christ is to get my faith to a
[2:08:17] level that I can take a Rapture
[2:08:19] Hallelujah don't get we in it all look
[2:08:22] to the
[2:08:23] promise look to the temple Hallelujah
[2:08:27] Jesus Christ has provided the way of
[2:08:30] Escape Hallelujah he is the way the
[2:08:33] truth and the life that's the way I want
[2:08:35] to go the Broadway leads to destruction
[2:08:38] the way of those that fall and stay down
[2:08:40] but to the righteous that
[2:08:42] arise Hallelujah we've got a straighten
[2:08:45] narrow road that we're walking oh
[2:08:47] Hallelujah seems like it Teeters from
[2:08:50] one side and God just puts us back in
[2:08:52] the middle of the road and what did he
[2:08:53] see when he seen that the bride uh uh
[2:08:56] preview there was that little bit in the
[2:08:59] very back and they was falling to the
[2:09:01] side and then to the other side and
[2:09:03] brother brandham found himself standing
[2:09:05] on a floor saying get back in
[2:09:08] line Hallelujah so it's not
[2:09:13] complicated we don't have to worry we've
[2:09:16] heard the message Shalom amen it'll
[2:09:18] bring us back in line every time when we
[2:09:22] get unbalanced it'll just restore that
[2:09:24] Faith back to the middle of the road
[2:09:27] hallelujah
[2:09:29] hallelujah amen allow God to drop the
[2:09:33] spiritual Amnesia off of our
[2:09:36] eyes that our attitudes can be right
[2:09:40] amen take your eyes off of the trial and
[2:09:43] look to the
[2:09:45] promise
[2:09:46] hallelujah amen Shake thyself from the
[2:09:50] Dust
[2:09:51] arise and sit down be grounded in faith
[2:09:56] oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the
[2:09:59] bands of thy
[2:10:01] neck God has great things for us coming
[2:10:05] amen you know one of my favorite
[2:10:08] scriptures in the Bible is a
[2:10:10] shadra Paul and Silas in prison and you
[2:10:14] know uh they were doing the king's work
[2:10:18] and in that King's work they got a
[2:10:21] tithing that was a little bit different
[2:10:23] they got
[2:10:24] stripes and you know their offering was
[2:10:27] prison
[2:10:29] time sometimes uh doing the will of God
[2:10:32] puts you in an odd
[2:10:33] spot and but you know they didn't allow
[2:10:36] that to take their eyes off of the
[2:10:39] promise there they was in prison bound
[2:10:43] and I I remember it explained uh that
[2:10:46] that they put their feet in stalks says
[2:10:49] that way those backs that was all torn
[2:10:51] up would be down in the dirt and and in
[2:10:53] the filth of the cell getting infected
[2:10:55] causing a a lasting pain and scarring
[2:11:00] and there they was in this state of
[2:11:02] turmoil this state of great discomfort
[2:11:05] what a trial
[2:11:06] and and there they were surrounded by
[2:11:10] all sorts of prisoners uh people that
[2:11:13] had no hope uh people that had fallen
[2:11:16] away from God maybe brought up in a good
[2:11:18] Christian home but just straight away
[2:11:20] from the faith and
[2:11:22] and there they are and they began to
[2:11:24] sing and you know I don't know what they
[2:11:27] sing but my mind says right now uh only
[2:11:30] trust him only trust him only trust him
[2:11:35] now yes that's right he will save me he
[2:11:39] will save meise the Lord he will save me
[2:11:43] now and you know you could hear that it
[2:11:45] would have probably started a little bit
[2:11:46] soft maybe just a little bit of a hum
[2:11:48] and and and then that that presence
[2:11:50] started started to move out from those
[2:11:52] brothers and and the Prisoner that would
[2:11:54] have been close by he would have been
[2:11:56] like oh I remember feeling a presence
[2:11:58] like that when I was just a child I I
[2:12:01] thought I had I had lost God I I thought
[2:12:03] here I am Bound in prison I I've
[2:12:05] murdered somebody I thought there was no
[2:12:07] hope for me but here God rich in Mercy
[2:12:11] places the SE Gene of God in what seemed
[2:12:14] to be total
[2:12:15] despair but there they were in the will
[2:12:18] of God doing God's bidding yes and that
[2:12:21] spear would have continued moving out
[2:12:23] down the road to maybe a a child that
[2:12:27] that uh was brought out into drugs and
[2:12:31] living in Despair and and all of a
[2:12:34] sudden the prison shook the Bible says
[2:12:39] and the prisoners
[2:12:40] heard they heard the wooing of the
[2:12:43] spirit they felt the presence of God
[2:12:45] come on the scene and and they said oh
[2:12:49] there's hope Jesus has died for me yes
[2:12:54] and you know out of that there rose up
[2:12:56] an Army and the general came and he said
[2:13:00] oh what's happened here all the
[2:13:03] prisoners have escaped and he was about
[2:13:05] to kill himself and Paul said hold your
[2:13:10] sword we are all here and there we could
[2:13:14] see a change that had
[2:13:15] happened sometimes our trials takes us
[2:13:18] just into the perfect will of God
[2:13:20] sometimes those trials that seem like
[2:13:22] they're going to destroy us are just
[2:13:24] getting us into position for God to use
[2:13:27] us can we say Amen aren't you grateful
[2:13:30] for him amen I'm grateful for him bless
[2:13:35] the name we're living in a battle but
[2:13:37] with a mighty conqueror leading us to
[2:13:39] the victory every time David encouraging

[2:13:45] church everything's going to be okay yes

[2:14:03] of your prayer life don't
[2:14:06] worry it's not too late to get it back

[2:14:10] something you go back to where you lost
[2:14:12] it and you know if you've lost the
[2:14:14] presence of God just go back where you
[2:14:17] left it where you laid it down where the
[2:14:19] devil has robbed you of something just
[2:14:22] go back there and just start from that
[2:14:25] place what did Brother brandham tell us

[2:14:36] is here to meet your need if we just uh

[2:15:05] prison

[2:15:28] faithfulness I pray we would remember as
[2:15:30] a stake down in our lives this
[2:15:34] moment that Jesus
