amen and uh there's a lot of people that need the Lord amen and so uh but before we go into uh the word let's just bow our heads and pray and ask the Lord to be with us father Lord we're so thankful that we're your children and we've been brought here by Grace father it's been your grace all along in our lives and Lord we we want to share that to others father we want to share our experience of what you have done for us and the hope that lies within us that there is a future Lord that is so bright for your people no God we're just asking now that you would speak to our hearts Lord let it just anchor in our soul that when we leave this place and we go out and talk to others that we could share what you have done with this to us this morning and I pray father that you are just so saturated by your presence Lord and if there's any spirit that would try to hinder your people I pray that you would drive it from this place Lord we're thankful for what you're doing there in Ohio for the young people oh God you're still alive and well we're so thankful father and we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord Hebrews or Hosea the 12th chapter and we've read this before but the 10th verse it says I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and use similitude by the ministry of the prophets amen you can have your seats this morning and I'm going to turn on these lights here but we um want to just continue with the these thought of ministry and Ministry is a powerful thing and when you think of of it being God's Ministry and what it's for and of course Ministry is the agent in which God accomplishes his purpose and it's an eternal purpose that God has and you see God's not continuing to come up with a plan as time as time goes but um he's uh he's infinite and so he has this infinite knowledge he knew the end from the beginning and so uh and according to Isaiah 46 10 we've quoted it many time read it but he's declared the end from the beginning and so uh there there were a people that was in his thinking that was a a seed germ and uh we know uh brother Branham talked heavily on it especially in the latter part of his ministry that uh God would write these people's names uh in the Lamb's Book of Life and and so I believe that this morning sitting here or maybe even listening in uh that uh there are people that are represented in the Lamb's Book of Life and they have their names there and God wrote our name in that book and that is that nothing can take that away nothing can erase it take it out it's there to stay and I I thank the Lord for that and I I pray that all of us here today have have our names written in that book the Lamb's Book and this shows that we were in his thinking before the foundation of the world that God thought of us and he had us in his mind and and so therefore as the prophet taught us this makes us an attribute of his thinking and um his thoughts are Eternal they are real and therefore uh we are as an attribute of his thinking we are Eternal and um and so uh and and I could say it this way we are real uh this being Sons and Daughters of God is not a figment of our imagination being a Christian is something that we just don't imagine but it's a reality and it all stems from the mind of God and so uh now just reading several quotes but brother Brian said there was one time before the foundation of the world I was eternal when God thought of me I was thought of before the foundation of the world my name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life and so was yours before there was even one grain of sand he says how many knows that that's the Bible he said see how many know that God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world then in God's thinking we were born right into his kingdom then right then we were born into his kingdom and one day there came a body through holy wedlock my mother my father see and they sired me and here I come William Branham represented in a body of Flesh now you know me as William Branham a man God knowed me as William Branham a thought in his own mind and an expression ain't that right so so we we were we want to know what God thought of us now we can think of each other as as as one thing but God's God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts and so we we want to know what he thought of us and so he thinks of you not as a man a woman boy girl he thinks of you as an eternal a lot of his and so he said you in his mind existed before there was a world that's the reason he said he chose you before the foundation of the world it isn't what we think or what somebody else thinks it's what God Eternal see you always was in his thinking it was in him to be man that's the reason Christ was expressed the expressed image now he was to be father he was to be son he was to be savior he was to be healer see there was there was nothing there wasn't even an angel or nothing so then he created the Angels then he become God and he was worshiped then these are the manifestations of his thinking there's nothing wrong everything is going to turn out all right don't be scared God's big timepiece is ticking right along it'll be there it'll have a church without spot or wrinkle for it was in his thinking thank you everything that was in his thinking that was eternal is going to end up just being what he thought it to be it may have not started out to be that way but it will end up that way ain't that right and when I say start it out I'm talking about your natural birth and so it was in his thinking now Jeremiah 29 11 it's it's a scripture we've read here a little bit uh but it says God's saying for I know the thoughts that I think towards you Eternal thoughts saith the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil and to give you an expected end so that's in his thinking there is an expected end at according to what he thought of you ain't that right so what is our expected end the Bible says in Ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious Church everybody say glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so that's that is a unexpected end that we have Ephesians 1 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world what that we should be sinners that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children or Sons by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will that's an expected end that we have Romans 8 29 whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that's an expected end that he has amen and that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called past tense when before the foundation of the world it's all in his thinking and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified see he knows amen the thoughts that he thinks toward us and he's had it all along in this book right here ain't that right amen so we we look again Romans 8 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God and if children then heirs and if and then then heirs Heirs of God and Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ with Jesus Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God why are they waiting for it why are they groaning for it because that's an expected end that God had for you and I for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the very same in Hope ain't that right so he didn't just subject you into this world of sin and Corruption but now he also subjected you to Hope which was in his thinking ain't that right so that's what we're coming to because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God so to come to that expected end there has to be and deliverance a man that takes place within every thought of a man and woman boy or a girl a man that was in God's thinking ain't that right for we know that the whole creation groaneth uh and travail Us in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we everybody say I amen even we ourselves groaning we're groaning why because we were the Eternal thoughts of God Amen and you cannot be anything but what God thought you to be this you your condition tonight amen or today is not Eternal your sickness is not Eternal amen your mind battles is not Eternal your discouragement is not Eternal amen you have you're you're a sin and and and all of these things is not Eternal can you say Amen them things have got to pass away and there's something within us that is groaning it's like the the little chicken uh that's that's not been hatched out of that egg but if there's life in that egg if there's life there and then and then at a certain time that chicken was not made to be in that egg all the time ain't that right it was there for a season but it has to break away and it starts pecking and pecking it you can't crack the egg for it it has to it has to do it with the end and if there's something within it that's groaning to be delivered to be set free and it starts working its way until it finally breaks that shell ain't that right well every trial that you go through everything that you go through either there's a life that's in you and if there's a life in you then there's a pecking that's going on there's something that is causing you Amen to push to break pass this thing you're breaking past your trials you're breaking past the habits you're breaking past the sins and all of these things one these days you're going to break this Old Shell of Flesh amen into another can you say Amen that we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body now so these are these are the Eternal thoughts this is unexpected end that God has for every thought of his eternal thought uh uh those whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life now we talk about becoming the word brother Branham in many places and and to be honest we we uh didn't know what becoming the word was until we began to look into the message and as the prophet that began to tell us a man that it's not a church it's the word it's not denomination it's the word it's it's you say well I'm In Love With Jesus well what are you what Jesus are you in love with your own imagination of him or is it the word ain't that right see it all comes back to the word the word the word the word well we're becoming the word and he says the word becomes you and you become the word see and then another place you become the word as you receive the word ain't that right amen another place he says the word assures us of the promise us because it is the promise it is the promise see this is God's thoughts and Seed form ain't that right it's the word of God it's an expression of God's thoughts and this is the promise not what the doctor told you not what you feel not your feelings and not not your mind amen but this is the promise that comes from the thoughts of God concerning you amen so the word assures us of the promise because it is the promise the word is the promise and the word is the God and the word is ours do you believe that and we become the word and the word becomes us if you abide in me and my word up in you and see then it just becomes one great big family ain't that right so who is part of this one great big family those Eternal thoughts can you say man and they are becoming the word in this age well see so we talk about the word becoming the word well you cannot become the word unless you were a thought because the word is only the expression of a thought can you say amen amen and then we're taking it even a further step is that we're becoming the manifestation of the word so it's it but we start it as a thought which was in God's mind and if you were a thought then you take the process of becoming the word and being a manifested word ain't that right amen you can't be word here today and not and and live and be contrary to the thoughts of God it's all the same channel it's all the same thing it's just uh uh coming in different forms so so a word is a thought expressed and so you cannot become the word amen without being a thought first ain't that right so the Eternal Word is only the expression of God's Eternal thoughts amen Jesus was the word which means that God's thoughts was expressed the prophet said in a human body amen we call it he called him the word he was the word amen but what he was was God's thoughts expressed in a human body ain't that right amen that's why Jesus was his his he said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me what was he going to do express the thoughts of God Amen and that's exactly what we're doing here that's why we're here is we're coming to do the will of the Father which is only what he had thought of us to do and to be before the foundation of the world he thought of a bride amen and that's what we're here to be ain't that right he thought of of a bride that was spotless uh without wrinkle blemish and and all these things he thought of a powerful church he thought of a a church that that was separated from the world and separated from all these things well that's what we're here Amen to do and to be we're here to do the will of him that sent us because it's only God's thoughts expressed in our human body so in the message the Mighty God unveiled before us in 64. uh brother Branham tells us that Jesus came into this world and he expressed exactly what the Old Testament said he would then all those who was redeemable believed it because they themselves were the thoughts of God the attributes of him at the beginning was made flesh and redeemable and was brought back to God and you say Amen amen see so he was the thoughts of God the expressed thoughts made flesh and all of those thoughts that were in that age that believed him they were redeemable ain't that right others live by the law others lived by whatever amen they lived by a word of day past and and and and these things and and that when he came they rejected him and he told them that's the sign that you're of your father the devil ain't that right now John 1 12 Jesus uh or it says here as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God ain't that right now brother brannerman reading that says this he gave them power to become the sons of God because they were redeemable ain't that right they were redeemable they were from the beginning in the expression from the beginning and notice what he says then he says the message of the hour is the expressed thoughts of Jehovah do you believe that the message of the hour is the expressed thoughts of Jehovah now you know uh uh sometime you know we we might think and maybe or before especially before we come into the messages is I I wished I could have been there in the days of Jesus and and and and and got to touch him got to hear him got to got to fellowship with him and and and these things it'd been nice to be there with like Nathaniel and and stand before him or like Peter and and you know the woman at the well and all these things and and and and and and and how we would have loved to been there but you realize you have the same opportunity to accept the same person in this age that they did back then you have the same opportunity to reject as the Rich Young Ruler did or you have that opportunity to accept it because as he was the expressed thoughts of God in a human body so is this message the express thoughts of Jehovah God for this age here in in in in in in this time and I say those who are redeemable will believe this message those who are redeemable a man will believe this message amen it's all set again it's it's the same thing he's the same brother Brown said he's the same in every every way except his Corporal body ain't that right now so so now this is Brother branham's explanation as to why uh uh that that one he says is odd to the other it must be that way it it was always it always has been that way and it always will be that way why because those that are redeemable believe this message with all that's within them see because it is the expressed thoughts of Jehovah that's the way we see this message we don't see it as a seventh grade Kentuckian coming and trying to explain to us the mysteries of God Amen that we see it amen a prophet that caught up in the mind of God Amen and become I'm the expression of God Amen to reveal the expressed thoughts of of you and I see amen even brother Branham didn't even tell her couldn't even tell us amen that we were the germ seed of God do you realize that it look in his his early Ministry he never even talked about being a germ seed of God he never even talked about that stuff amen but after the lamb come and open that book amen and the lamb brought this book down to earth and gave it to that seventh angel amen the message began to take place and become personal then Amen to let you know you've never done it in the first place you've always been Justified you are a gene seed of God to Justified amen and not only that he's already saw you over there amen see it's all a man uh uh uh it's God it becomes the expressed thoughts of God and that's how we take this message a man is the express Parts Express see people people want to dissect it and they want to tear it apart and they and and it sickens my stomach when when people do that and they start now you know uh brother branham's opinion and brother Brandon says I'll take his opinion as we said so many times I'll take his opinion over anybody's opinion any day I I'll I'll take his opinion over scientific facts any day you understand what I'm saying amen because he lived in the presence of that Pillar of Fire he was there constantly under that presence so but this brother Bram says this is why we're ought to one and uh what what ought to the other ought to the world odd see now if you if you go listen to that sermon the Mighty God unveiled before us at the beginning you will hear Brother Brown's sight now many people has wondered why we are so odd and so noisy you know this kind of a different type of convention then this is a different kind of type of convention that what people are used to seeing and usually everything is kind of cut and dried form but when you come to these conventions which has been my privilege now for several years since they first started uh uh and we don't know Harley what we're going to do we just come and surrender ourselves and that's the only thing we know to do and God does the rest so that makes us a very peculiar acting people and you say Amen it makes us a very peculiar acting now that was that was in the beginning of his sermon and then he goes on and he's talking see about about these things and he says and the message of the hour is to express thoughts of Jehovah and that's why we are odd one to the other that's why we're odd to the other is because there's a people that actually believe this that's what made the the people in in in Jesus's day so odd to the church so odd to the world is because they realize this is the one that God promised can you say Amen so see now then he goes and says see the world gets in such a rut till something different makes it so odd tell the people think that it's something it's some something that is wrong people get in such a rut that when God does something outside of that then they look at it and say that has to be something wrong and so we're considered an occult we're considered odd for and and they always you're following a man you're following a man we don't follow a man you know and and and they are so they're so warped in their thinking because this was written amen now I know we all say written by the Holy Ghost but who pinned it you know you understand now God wrote words on the wall amen God wrote the The Ten Commandments amen ain't that right that he took men and he wrote These Pages these words were written by men that God used ain't that right they were under the unction of the Holy Ghost but still it was a man's hand that took a pen and began to scribble the words in in on the pages ain't that right amen well if God can use them men to do that then cannot God raise up a man in this day amen and anoint him and so feel him and use him to where he could express his very thoughts amen we're not following a man we're following the pillar of fire that was over that man in that man that worked through that man ain't that right but see the world gets in such a rut tell something different makes it so odd till the people think that there's something wrong see and so people in this day or Through the Ages that got in the Rut of denominational thinking and traditions of men to where when God sent the message which is God's thoughts amen or the express thoughts of Jehovah's brother bran would say then they think that there's something wrong with it amen because it's out of denominational thinking this message came out of the box it's not in the box as they would say ain't that right see so people have gotten so formal to where they just have a form of religion and the Bible already told us that the people of this age would have a form of godliness and would deny the power of God Amen so when the people amen that accept the power of God and they're not following the trend of just having a form of church having a form of worship having traditional things and and and and their their worship is out of the box their worship is under inspiration their Worship Is by Revelation when we run around the church there's something there that is behind that when we get up and shout and scream there's something behind that and they will say oh that's fanaticism oh they're in the flesh oh they're this see they're so carnal they can't tell the difference between a carnal Pentecostal and a true revelated message believer ain't that right but they've gotten it so there see into such a form that when those who are the redeemable thoughts of God begin to shout and to Rejoice they're considered odd they're considered working up a crowd can you say man but really what it is they're really shouting amen because they see what the message is really about amen see the redeemable thoughts of God are people who lived and are living in their appointed day and age All Through the Ages there has been a people that have lived in the in an age and they are currently living today in uh uh uh uh in this age who are the people of the Living God the Eternal thoughts of God can you say Amen and what they are is they're the sons of God who in God's mind shouted for joy a man before the foundation of the world you shouted for joy can you say it with me I shouted for joy yeah I shouted for joy where in the mind of God amen that's right see so this is why brother Brown says shouting this the shouting religions the oldest religion there ever is was because it started in the mind of God amen so notice in the beginning of the sermon again the Mighty God unveiled before us brother bran said I thought tonight if the Lord was willing I would try to read some scriptures pertaining to this and would speak to you in just a few moments and tried to show you why we are such an odd people we're not people do you believe that we're odd because we see and believe that this message of the hour is the express thoughts of Jehovah and we received it well there there there is a result in receiving it as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God amen and you say man that's right so this message is the perfect word can you say that with me perfect word expressing the perfect thoughts of God now brother Brown says when Satan tempts us we are to resist him in a perfect faith in a perfect word like Jesus did the word of God is perfect we're to have perfect faith in this perfect word and resists Satan ain't that right so so now just bear with me as we continue now as we know we are the Fallen thoughts of God we fail from God's thinking that's what brother Branham said about the woman at the well she she had fallen from God's thoughts and we all did if you were a thought of God in the beginning you came as a fallen thought of God but then Jesus came to be a redeemer and we know what that word is brother Branham showed us and told us that redeem is to pick up that which is falling amen something that had fallen ain't that right so then your Fallen condition did not change you a man uh uh change you in the mind of God what God thought of you has always been because it's an eternal thought so so whether you were in the gutter whether you lived as a prostitute as a drunk as a druggie as a just a religious churchgoer uh or whatever it was a man that you as a fallen thought it did not change change what God saw in you and what God thought you to be ain't that right see so now you may not know what you're to be I may not know what I was to be but God knew God knew from the beginning amen of what you and I were to be second Timothy 2 and 19 the foundation of God stand to sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his ain't that right he knows us so he never got lost you never got lost in the crowd God knows you amen he knew where you've been all alone you might have moved to 50 states in in in 10 years amen but God still knows exactly where you are he knows your number that that's why he would send a prophet and and that Prophet it didn't matter where they were or whatever amen when God would show that Prophet where that man lived that woman lived he would begin to tell their address and you live in a I see a lake and I see this and I see mountains and I see that well you live in such and such Town what was it it was God letting us know that he knows his exactly where we live he knows when you visit the doctor he knows what the doctor looks like he knows what the doctor has told you he knows what you just thought about he knows everything about you can you say amen amen and so uh infinite is his thinking amen that that you cannot get lost in the crowd and you cannot sin solo you cannot be such a scumbag that God don't know what you were in his mind in the beginning [Music] thank you the scars in your life cannot disfigure your disfig you your whatever enough to hide you from God [Music] the message identification 64 to redeem back to a place where it was at the beginning so that none will so none will be picked up but them that was in his thoughts at the beginning he come to redeem not this cannon fodder that we see a rig see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that was in God's thinking at the beginning [Music] this other is just something that mixed around to show the stature see it it's a garden a flower garden that plays its part but the stature is what you want to see the statue of Christ which was God projected in the earth in the form of a man that's the stature you want to see that's the one this other is just makeup parts another place God in the beginning was life the Eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh and Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back to so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning in God's thoughts can you say man this message means nothing to anyone nothing to no one else but but those thoughts of God amen the real Ministry of God means nothing to no one else but it does to the Fallen thoughts of God can you say amen that's right and I'm talking about real Ministry the one I'm part of and that's the message of the hour amen that's right amen say Melchizedek come to to to Abraham not to lot not not the bat not not lot uh brother Branham typed him as the foolish virgin in one place I think and then another place the lukewarm believer and and all these things but lot received a totally different message uh uh God sent Billy Graham or Robert's messages and all them under that that message goes for them that anyone with the message of the hour goes for the bride brother Branham did it we do it right Jesus did it we do it same Ministry the message of the hour you cannot water this message down this message is the message of Jesus Christ it's the ministry of Jesus Christ right so now brother Branham said see the foolish virgin has to suffer for her Deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of Christ calls he is the word that body was rendered and when that body was rendered the bride was in that body because it's all everybody say all the word the bride is all of the word ain't that right so now God knows uh uh who is to make up his word bride the Bible talks about the marriage supper of the Lamb God knows who is going to sit at that that table and who's going to partake of that supper ain't that right the Bible talks about the Millennium God knows who is going to be there the Bible talks about the new city God knows who is going to live in it yeah uh Hebrews 11 16 it says he hath prepared for them for them a city for them it was them the Eternal thoughts of God can you say man for they are the ones that's going to live in the city ain't that right and they're the ones that make up the bride so he hath prepared for them a city Hallelujah he knows you're coming he knows that he's under you you think about you being under expectation he's he's under greater expectation because it's his thoughts his thoughts they came from him he's the one that's been dwelling on them we're just now beginning to come into line with him thoughts and we begin we start now to come into a stock pattern but he's always had them can you say Amen John 14 and 2 in My Father's House Jesus said our many mansions if it were not so I would have told you but I go to prepare everybody say prepare a place for you you who Eternal thoughts of God it's just the truth can you say man now we know others are going to make it but but I'm talking about him preparing amen he prepared that this city is prepared amen for his thoughts sure this this this place is prepared amen for those that were in his thinking before the foundation of the world and you say Amen amen he's preparing a place for his bride so he's speaking to every predestinated seed see so he knows exactly who he's preparing uh uh uh for and and and knows that they're going to be there now if he is gone to prepare a place for his elect then also he is preparing his elect for that place notice the prophet said she is a prepared uh she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy Church it ain't gonna be too much longer can you say man he's been there preparing but he's also been doing something on this Earth to prepare his elect for it amen our opening scripture talks about the ministry of the prophets throughout the ages he has seen His prophets to cut his people out God the prophet said God chopped his people out of the rest of the Nations he chopped his Nation out of a nation and he chops his church out of the churches Revelations 18 4 I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people come out why it's got to be a preparation time come out of hurt my people that you be not partaker of her sins and that you received none of her plagues now how do you come out how how does a man a woman boy girl come out of her now you talking about such a drawing uh drawing card that she's got a power a suction power that she has that she is calls on the World to come right back to her how do we come out of that well Malachi 4 5 says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day and he I'll put it this way and he shall chop you out [Music] that's the way he's done it with all the uh all his people he's chopped him out he shall cue you out can you say man so he's got a Ministry this Prophet that has come has got a Ministry Isaiah 51 and 1 hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the Lord look unto the Rock when you are hewn and to the whole of the pit which you are digged now this word hewn or huge is to cut to carve out of something and according to Hosea 6 5 they are hewed out by the prophets ain't that right so again God took Israel and chopped him out By His prophets brother Brandon said he chopped his Nation from the Nations by the prophets his Vindicated word so it has to be a Vindicated prophet not just anyone running around saying I'm a prophet is to to have authority over you is to have power over you because they may cut you up but they may not cut you out we need someone to cut us out ain't that right so brother Brown says see he has chopped his bride from the denominations by his word promised by Malachi 4 in the last days chopped out his bride hewed her from the rest of the churches hewed out his bride so I say to you today the elect isn't meant to be like the world that's what makes us odd and you say man and it's it's it's impossible to truly follow a man a Vindicated prophet in his message and still be conformed to this world ain't that right a Vindicated Prophet The Prophet said coming to a people is a sign to that people that God cares for them you'll listen to the message he cares do you care amen God showed that he cared for the people by sending them a prophet ain't that right see what good would it be to talk about heaven what good see we we people all around the world for ages have written about songs about heaven talked about heaven how beautiful Heaven Must Be You know uh I can only imagine and and on and on all about heaven amen and and that's great that's wonderful but see Heaven is so far Out Of Reach if you ain't got a prophet to chop you out and prepare you for that place it's true because what good would it be to talk about heaven the Millennium and the Rapture if there wasn't a preparation made there has to be a preparation made ain't that right how could we rejoice in the fact that that we are not going in the tribulation and that we are going to escape the the wrath of God if there wasn't a way prepared for our Escape [Music] in the days of Noah the prophet said God cared for those who cared to escape the Judgment of God and he showed that he cared by sending them a prophet they cared to to escape not too many did but but there were some we didn't know who it was until the message came Noah's message came and and hewed them out and found out there was only eight but it took a message [Music] to bring a separation to call them out ain't that right now the this Prophet uh brother Brown said this Prophet directed them to God's provided way see that's that's God's way of doing things God spoke to Noah which was the word it wasn't the written word then and God told and told Noah to prepare an ark for the saving of the people and to warn all the people that he had one way everybody say one way of salvation one way of Salvation and this man was a Vindicated prophet and proved them the way of Escape see and notice the humble and sincere heard this man and believed him and they escaped what did they escape they escaped the death of the world of sin that was being destroyed in that day they accept the days death root that was laying upon the whole world ain't that right so God sent that prophet and that Prophet showed the way of provision amen and today the ark is the body of Jesus Christ do you believe that well that's what brother Branham said so he cared he so cared for them until he prepared a way that they could come into and would be free from all the judgments that was coming he did that to the elect now we know that see he did that to the elect only to the elected now they was the one who had accepted this germ of Life they were the one who was predestinated to see it ain't that right now God we know that the judgment's coming we know all this is happening but in this day there's been a way that has been preached unto us that only those irredeemable thoughts will accept that it's been prepared in the in in the first Exodus God sent the people a prophet to show that he cared for them destruction was coming upon the land God's going to destroy Egypt so God sent a prophet to them to prepare them to show them away of Escape ain't that right God had told Abraham years before that he would deal with Egypt when the cup of iniquity got sealed up Egypt had heaped their sins so high until God had to send judgment but the prophet said God didn't want to pour out his wrath upon all the people now if you could really understand that God doesn't want to pour His wrath out upon you have you ever just wondered why God opened your eyes about a prophet in this age allowed you to come into the message of the hour and just wholly believe it it's a sign to you God doesn't want to pour His wrath upon you and you say Amen so we we find a man by that prophet's message brother Brown says God separated his people from the unbelieving world and from the coming Judgment of that day see the prophet's message separated them another place he said he sent them his prophet and they separated themselves from unbelief that's the kind that come out that's the kind that believed it they believed Moses's message it's not just saying I believe it but it's actually coming out amen and that shows you believe the message they didn't wander up in Egypt they and so when the darkness came they weren't there when when the plagues come they weren't there they believe the message of the hour now in the eyes of pharaoh Moses was a fanatic Moses was a magician just just a a a hypocrite you know that's what brother Britton said Pharaoh looked at him as as something terrible but to the people that was elected that come out according to God's word I'll bring them out he was a prophet to them he was God's provided way for them laughs how do you look at the prophet amen that's why we don't we don't we don't go around well this is Brother Brown's opinion and this is this and this is this for for me it's God's provided way I've been in the mess of confusion I've been in the place I didn't know who to believe and what to believe and everybody pulling me one way or the other amen and and and and so gullible that you'd you'd go this way and you'd get burnt go that way and you still don't know you're just all confused and everything else but now I believe that God gave me a provided way that's through the prophet of this hour and you say man so it was through the ministry of Noah that God made preparations it was through the ministry of Moses that God made preparation through the ministry of Moses god prepared the people amen for the March to the land of promise and brother Brown says see what was it omnipotence spoke the miraculous took place amen it was through the ministry of Joshua that God prepared amen Joshua was a prophet you know amen and and through that Ministry God prepared the people to come over into the promised land it was through the ministry of the Prophet Elijah that God prepared the elect and turned their hearts back to a living God and you say man and how did he do it he repaired the altar of the Lord yes sir and the Lord answered by fire and consumed the sacrifice consumed this the altar consumed the water it consumed it all and that that fire amen was not a literal fire it was a holy fire Pillar of Fire can you say amen and by that God prepared the people and turned them back Elijah didn't keep the people on idolatry but he brought them out by repairing the altar of the Lord it was through the ministry of John the Baptist that God prepared the heart of the people a man to receive the coming of Jesus now we're living in a time of Exodus as we all know we're living in a in the day when God's Wrath is going to be poured out we're living at what the Bible calls the ends of the Earth amen we're living in the day of the greatest deception ever to come to the Earth we are living also in the day when the lamb has come to claim what he has redeemed aren't you glad for that now church we ought to we ought to we ought to give God glory due to the fact that we know that the lamb has opened the book and why he opened that book was to reclaim those names that he had written before the foundation of the world that you would not be left Amen in the in the Wrath that is to come it's a time of rapture it's a time for the body change it's a time for death to lose its power it's a time for sickness to lose its power it's a time for corruption to lose its hold can you say man and and for that to happen God had to send a prophet to show us a provided way notice what brother Branham here in praying he said may your spirit fall upon us the and anoint the word to our heart say that again may your spirit fall upon us and anoint the word to our heart why that we might go from here this evening better people than we are now two that we might have a closer Insight on Jesus Christ Grant it Lord that we might three understand the day that we're living in and the preparation of God for his people in this hour don't just look at it as God said on the prophet look at it at his God's preparation for this hour can you say Amen this message is a preparation yeah I wished I had time to preach and I wished I was just a preacher I could just preach it's a time for preparation why because God had you he saw you before the world began and this preparation is to take you back for you before you your first mind Battle Before The Devil and first was able to lay his hands upon you amen and before you breathe your first breath as a sinner God had already had plans for you and now he's come to prepare you for them plans this message that our ought to show you and give you hope that God never gave up on you man gives up on you man will say the devil will tell you you cross the line but if your heart is beating up this message and saying God I need you more there's a preparation made for you what we need him to do is his Spirit Fall Upon Us anoint the word to our heart amen that we might understand the preparation of God for his people for the past several years we have been living in the hour of preparation god brother Branham said in another prayer he said Lord we believe that you're you're preparing your people uh uh to believe all things we're living in the hour where you're preparing the people to believe all things he's preparing amen and well here it is I didn't know I'd put it but he says our heavenly father I thank thee tonight because that we're living in the hour of preparation we're living when you're preparing the people to believe all things we believe that's the message of the day the preparation time right the message is here to prepare you you know why the devil fights you so hard and tell you you're gonna miss the Rapture ain't he stupid you're you're living your smack dab living in in in in in God's preparation for you if you was in a Baptist I could understand that if you was in a Pentecostal I could understand that even if he was Apostolic I could understand that stand there hour there's no better way to be prepared for a Rapture there's no better way to get rapturing Faith there's no other way to you can't miss the Rapture if you'll accept the message of the hour and look at it as your way out of here you ought to look at it as you're way out here no wonder the devil fights our young people man but you ain't he ain't gonna win he ain't winning you believe that yeah he says you're calling the people and giving them the Holy Ghost and now you're trying to call out that group out of that group of sons to adopt them see so the preparation is not for you to go to church I mean all the other denominations they'll make you where you go Church they reform you they get you to make a confession we're beyond that and then then they try to get in the Holy Ghost and all that and then then brother Brown says they they think that once you get the Holy Ghost it's over you can settle down but for for for a real true message believer this message ain't gonna let you settle down that's the problem with the churches today they just sit and get formal and die they don't know why they're message believer they don't know what they're doing and and the devil uses them to try to make us a denomination and make us known better than that but I'm telling you this message will not let a True Believer settle down you may have gotten the Holy Ghost but the message will tell you there's more for you can you say man we will never be satisfied until we come into His presence a totally changed the individual and come back to being the original father of God the way God saw us to be you could have the adoption look at brother Branham even I mean he he was there and spoke squirrels into existence and all that and that's fine amen but there was still something groaning why because he was doing all of that in this whole body of Flesh full of aches and the pains and all that but that's not God's intention for us that's not God's Eternal thoughts for us we're to live in a body where death has no hold on us a body of no sickness a body of no pain of no travail a man to where there be just Everlasting joy and peace amen and worship so this message is preparing it's called you out Revelations 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his what his wife not his sidekick beloved wife who is bone of his bone who come from him she has made herself ready ain't that right notice how did she do it and to her was granted given that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the LA fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints now brother Brown says we know that though that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spotter wrinkle and they have everybody say they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready you have the material what material amen the word of God the message of the hour it's only God's provided way to where you won't appear before God Amen in in a naked condition amen but you'll be clothed in the garments of his righteousness and it's been provided to you by the message of this hour that's what I believe how did God prepare the people for the Exodus first Exodus brother Brown said first he sent a prophet with a sign which was Moses so what was the sign Moses was the sign amen and the sign to us is the prophet of Malachi 4. so many people missed the sign sure they do and then he says and the son had a message and the message was to get ready they were going out to the land that was promised then he had identification of this Prophet that a light same light was over the top of him knows how to say things without just really coming out and saying it right a pill or fire followed this Prophet we know that went through the Wilderness with Moses we realize that and then he gave them the people a token for the assurance that they wouldn't have to be scared all upset and nervous where he said when I see that token I'll pass over you now fear is all in the land today the Bible says men's Hearts failing them for fear but God sent us a prophet aren't you glad for that God sent us a token aren't you glad for that amen how did it happen by way of a prophet to show us the real token that death was coming so that you wouldn't have to be scared you wouldn't have to be all trembly and shaky and and worrying about this and worrying about fat and worrying about your children and worrying about this and all of that you got a token to apply with your prayer see so he says see the identification of the messenger a token for the assurance that the way was paid they are headed for the promised land the same thing he has done today what did he do he sent us the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the messenger and the scriptural identification of himself identifies him Among Us the same yesterday today and forever and the token is the Assurance what are we scared about Our Fair is already paid and we are identified with our sacrifice he cannot turn you down he promised it we're identified see Israel coming out of Egypt as I said is like the bride coming out of the church when Moses began his ministry Israel all gathered together in Goshen for prayer and worship exactly come from all parts of the of of the of Egypt that's the bright the way the bride will do it'll come out of all the Oneness twoness threateness and all other other kinds it'll come out and we've done that see we've now the first thing we must think of is come from All Parts come out from amongst belief see now the Holy Spirit promised to call back in the last days come out from among the unbelievers ain't that right so in the end time message and I'll start winding it down but in the end time message uh or the message in time evangelism brother Brown said the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture aren't you glad there's a Ministry of a prophet so in the message Paradox 61 brother Brandon gave us the reason as to why we see the handwriting on the wall today he said God has prepared his church he's prepared his people he's prepared his place and they're waiting for him to come and that's why he says the handwriting is on the wall what is it it's a sign that judgment is here now coming it's a sign that Mercy is lifting it's a sign that Grace is about done hello now this bride what are we seeing her as a finished product she is a word bride not a denominational bride a word bride and see now now and and now listen to me and you can agree or not but this is where I am with it the Bible without a prophet could not produce a word bride the Bible without a prophet could not produce a word bride we've had the Bible for years and years how many agreed to that from the Bible we've had two extreme doctrines in in the ages and that is calvinistic teaching and uh which calvinistic teaching the prophet said came from the Bible they leaned hard on predestination hard on predestination and they took it out so far out in the left field to where they didn't even believe in revivals no more they they they you know but yet brother Brown said predestination is a good thing and is biblical it was used in the days of the martyrs because they certainly believed it ain't that right and then by the time that John Wesley came on the scene they had taken this calvinistic Doctrine so to the extreme that they didn't even represent Christians in Christianity and and all that so God sent John Wesley to preach the other Doctrine and that was armenianism so to bring a balance to Calvinism and you say man now brother Brahman said Armenian teaching comes from the Bible just as well as calvinist did ain't that right but notice what he says now it's got so far away talking about Armenian Doctrine it's got so far away from the the word now to the legalist ideas the legalist teaching in the church so what we have to contend with now now that we contend with is you've got one side that is calvinistic in their teaching and the other one that is Armenian in their teaching and they're they're both extremes this way and that way can you say Amen and it's funny that both of these arrive or it got their Source from the Bible they're they're actually founded from Biblical teachings scripturally ain't that right and yet the calvinist teaching and the Armenian teaching contradicts so so much with one another they're like night and day and yet they both have scriptures to stand on the prophet says they both run out and ride on limbs broke off Made issues now notice what he says because I think this is important God just brought the whole thing back and stuck it in the book of Ephesians and straightened it out yeah yeah sir he takes he takes both sides and puts it all back into balance in the book of Ephesians can you say man and straightens it out notice so it's where we're at one runs this way one runs this way one runs radical this way one runs radical that way that's the way the church is always gone now but if you will know this and I'm talking about preparation of the of the Bride if you'll notice the book of Ephesians is addressed to those that are in Christ Jesus the Saints can you say man brother Brown said see it's addressed to the faithful in Christ the ones that Paul had preached to and brought up matured with the gospel how did they mature under Paul's Ministry and how does this elect mature under brother branham's Ministry that's what brother Graham said we're laying right in the in the presence of the son it's the rising of the Sun and he ties his ministry to that Rising ain't that right now again brother Branham I believe in Paradox he says I think that we are living in the Ephesians again what is he talking about to wear that we don't have to run out on this limb and run out on that limb and run out into this left it's over you cannot do that and be a word bride a lot of doctrines come from the word but they're so far out of balance I think we're living in the Ephesians again back again we are promised that what was left off during those Seven Ages now he says you cannot add it nothing to the book nor take it nothing from it Revelations 22 18 says so who who will ever uh will add one word take one word his part will be taken from the book of life now we cannot add or take so therefore we know that Luther could not get to it Wesley and so forth the reformers knocks Finney Calvin so now on down so forth they didn't get it all but what they had was the Gospel truth but now everybody say now in the last days we are giving the understanding by the word that we are going to understand it because it'll come and efficientates to it and we're here so see we are a bride that is being prepared for the rapture we are being a bride a man being prepared to go back to the Eternal thoughts of God original thoughts of God so with that where do we stand as the bride of Christ we are back we are back to where the word Has Its Right balance everybody say it has its right balance it has its right balance now the bride of Christ is a word bride do you believe that okay so she's a word bride but she is not made up of calvinistic teaching she is not made up of Armenian teaching that's not what makes the word bride so you can sit under a calvinistic teaching amen calvinist calvinist calvinist teach and ain't going to make a word bride you can sit under armenianism holy holy holy holy a sin not this this this this and ain't going to make a word bride can you say Amen she is a word Bride made up by the perfect word can you say Amen now what is the perfect word it's a balanced word everybody say it's a balanced word and it's produced a balanced bride aren't you glad for the ministry God's Ministry the perfect word is a balanced word and has produced a balanced bride amen see so it's a balanced word that is restoring the bride back to the original thoughts of God amen if it was calvinistic teaching God witness sent a prophet if if it was if it was it was Armenian teaching legalistic teaching God witnessing a prophet can you say Amen that's right see so this bride has become the manifested thoughts of God by the perfect word which is a balanced word now brother Branham Likens the word with the message of the hour to that of a prescription that the doctor gives his patient so to make them well the prescription has to be balanced or it'll kill the patient brother Bram said see people don't like to take the doctor's prescription if he's got a remedy that'll cure your sickness and you refuse to take it it ain't the doctor's fault that you die and and I'll say it this way it's not it's not the it's not God's fault it's not the prophet's fault that people miss the rapture see it's your fault because you refuse to take it now if the doctor writes a prescription and you take that prescription to a quiet druggist and he put something in there that ought and be in there it'll kill you that doctor has studied that till he knows that there's so much of that prescription that's poison right to kill them bugs that's in your body there's enough Armenian in it to kill the sin and there's enough antidote in there enough Calvinism in there to upset the poison that it won't kill you right come on now now that's me putting that in there there's enough antidote let's put in there that the poison won't kill you the Poison's in there just enough to kill it out because the doctor wants to make you well the prophet of God will not send a message that kills the people it's the legalist that comes in the church with them and under the messes that won't re that refuses to come under the headship they kill the people it's the Calvinists that come in and and and and and come under and won't surrender to the the headship of the message and they that message message but they take the Calvinism amen and destroy the church to where there's nothing left Holiness is gone the dresses are coming up shorter hello so there's enough antidote in there to upset the poison that it won't kill you it's got to be level if you put too much antidote it won't help the man the patient put too much poison it'll kill the patients it's got to be balanced [Music] well so is it the words got to be balanced so how many believes the prophet brought a balanced word a balanced word brother Andrew preached two powerful sermons last Sunday and while he was preaching he said let the word do the correcting and I I really like that amen but what he was saying is let the balanced word everybody say the balanced word let the balanced word do the correcting why because it's God that is making a bride through the ministry God is going to shape a bride and prepare her and you say Amen you you don't want a you don't want a calvinist to take the word and to do the correcting you don't want a legalist Armenian to take the word and do the correcting look where you end up ain't that right so when we study what the prophet taught and how he lived he went against the grain of both calvinist and Armenian he went against the grain of all of them can you say Amen see so now then we find out then when a calvinist takes the word and he starts doing the correct and you know what he always ends up doing he always ends up correcting the prophet when the Armenian takes the word and starts doing the correct and what does he always do he'll end up always correcting the prophet because the prophet never lined up all the way with Armenian teaching and he didn't line up well all the way with calvinist teaching he had a balance in what he brought because the prophet taught in the loud things in his church and whom that both disagree with so therefore you get them doing the correct and taking that word and doing the correcting and the prophet's going to be among them all of being corrected they make brother Branham out to be a hypocrite they basically say he couldn't live what he preached they make it though that he didn't have the capability to lead the his own family they insinuate that brother Branham was an idolater because of the things he allowed in his home they have all of these reasons as to why brother Branham didn't comply with the way they see things now I think I think we can all agree that brother branham's message was the Fulfillment of Revelations 18 4 come out of her my people help me agree with that I mean that that is total brother Branham says that right 18 4. come out of her my people well this heard that we are called to come out of what is she she's the and her daughters are harlots it's the Catholic church it's the denominational system do you believe that brother Branham says now listen now brother Brown says the Bible calls the Catholic Church a and calls the Protestant Church harlots said that the was the mother of harlots and that and and that is people that's an ill-famed woman who doesn't live true to her marriage vows and we all claim to be the bride of Christ and yet so untrue what would make the intrus by living everybody say by living contrary living contrary not just preaching contrary living contrary to the discipline that God has laid out for his bride to live by he said that's my own opinion the Bible and it is the infallible word of God I believe ain't that right so see being entwined with the and the Harlot uh Protestant daughters calls to us to live contrary Amen to the discipline that God has laid out for his wife to live by so brother Branham in in calling us out he just didn't tell us well the Catholics are wrong the Catholics are wrong denominations are wrong Protestant all this Creed and dog that's wrong but he taught us a new way of living yeah do you believe that so that our lives wouldn't be so entwined in the Harlot system to where we become harlots ourself in our own living to where our homes ain't patterned after the Harlot system that that that that that it's not our churches ain't patterned after a man the Catholic system and the denominations in this age not only did he tell us it's wrong but he gave us a new way of living ain't that right brother Branham see he says this way he says life is what controls us we are known hereby say we are known by the life we live not really by the sermon you live by the life you live and yet say it been said that your life speaks so loud that I can't hear your testimony so therefore to live a sermon would be much better than to preach one so you cannot tell me that God would send a prophet to preach a Divine message and the man couldn't live it it ain't so when a prophet says it's better to live one than to preach one you knew that he knew how to live it just as much if he told us to us men that we ought to run our families and live our families and and control our homes and all that then you can you you good and well know that he knew how to do such can you say Amen why because if he was going to bring us out of the Harlot system he had to come out of that Harlot system so the life you live shows what character you are because your life always builds your character so of course what do they do they want to attack the character his life now Jesus said by the fruit you shall know them so no matter what we would say now listen to this now no matter what we would say and how much we would testify if our lives doesn't coincide with that testimony we are doing the kingdom of God and indebtment by giving that testimony because people know what we are so did brother was brother Branham an indentment to the message that he preached because he couldn't live what he preached far be it for me to judge a prophet first Peter 2 5 tells us that we are Lively stones well brother Brown says what good does a stone do if you haven't got a stone Mason there with a sharp word to cut that stone into a place stone for the building what good does it do to make decisions if you still let the women and the man remain as they were and just join the church it's a pile of stones that's not shaped into nothing what we need is a stone Mason a man with the word of God a Vindicated power to prove that God sent him to shape that church and to cut off the worldly things and shape them into the stones of the Sons and Daughters of God that go into his building now Church we're not looking for a stone Mason God is sitting one to us and is Vindicated his message and his life not just to come out but to place Us in the body preparing us can you say man so if he's going to do that if he's going to shape us If the message if if God is going to take that man and to shape us then he's got to be delivered first of all cannot tell me that he's sitting there bound can't get away from these traditions and all of these things brother brannerman speaking of Moses said he was completely in the hands of God totally delivered from sheep herding to hurt God's sheep and I'm hurrying he was delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there was still murmuring among them can you say man I think when we get really delivered we'll accept the message as it is just accept it I don't have to explain it don't have to argue with it don't have to do nothing just accept it the way God sent it can you say Amen now I'm going to say this and I'll let you go but if he gave us an explanation as to why he did things and allowed things then let's stay with that explanation and I'm gonna bring this now but brother Branham said this he said I want to take this time to express each and every one of you how I am grateful to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house I certainly thank you with all of my heart it certainly did US good this morning he said I got a little boy small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and we had it in the room that's an explanation as to why he had it right so what what I'm saying is we don't need another explanation brother Branham explained it right there he gave us the reason he gave us the explanation I can't understand everything that he said but I just know that this is the explanation that I'm going to stick with it's on tape so I'm gonna say what brother Bram says this is the explanation right so then we we find that I'm we're we're this so now if his children were like mine and yours if they were anything like me when I was a kid mom and dad didn't allow TVs if it was my personal preference I would have had one I know that surprises you your children probably never did but I did and I would have taken it in a heartbeat if my dad would have said John you on television sure do it and if you just take notice of your little kid it's most the time since they ain't got one in the home you go to a restaurant and they're glued to the television we if we ever got a chance we would ask Dad when we went to Grandpa and Grandma's of course uh grandma always they had a television and dad would always tell us now you children don't ask me to watch television yes sir so we went to Grandma could you ask dad and don't tell him just ask him if he wants to stick around we could watch Charlie Chan or something we we knew how to do it Kmart was up the road from from Grandpa and Grandma back then kids could walk without being scared of so we had always asked Dad you know and US cousins all of us wanted me can we go up to Walmart or KMart look around sure okay every time you'd find us right there in the TV section all the Martin kids lined up we didn't hear the dinner bell we didn't hear nothing so now I'm saying all of this because I'm sure brother branham's children was just the same way but you know what brother Brown said I'll never have one of my own and if I had one I'd get a shotgun and blow it out the window door whatever you see they're part of the layout of cnh and all of this layout to see his stuff was coming in but because they had them desires broad Brown says no you're not going to do that I'm not going to have it in my home right but he did allow a Christmas tree not because they were laodicea not because of he was immature not because he couldn't live the message but because he had a little boy five-year-old boy at wanted one that's what he said just stay with the explanation you don't have to like it you don't have to want one I'm not pushing it on you to want one just don't explain any other give any other explanation than what he gave can you say man it's a balanced word so brother Brown said see we rent from a woman that has the television or home I never intend to have one in my house I don't want that thing in my house even though his children having that unconverted desires being in laodicea wanted one but he says I'll never have it in my home I'd blow it out with a shotgun because I don't want nothing to do with that evil thing ain't that right so lay ought to see her or not that thing wasn't coming in his home also remember on tape that brother Branham talks about his unconverted daughter Rebecca remember that she wanted to play that Boogie Woogie and he says you ain't playing it at my home right so what did he do what did she do she goes to the neighbor's house that has a piano so she can play the Boogie Woogie that unconverted girl having them lay Odyssey I mean come on now Boogie Woogie was coming into this layout of cnh and she had all that in her to want to play but he says you ain't playing that in this home ain't that right okay see so now brother Branham says this the true Prophet stands with the true word and doesn't compromise on it anyway in on it in any way ain't that right so either brother Branham said this he was either the true word Prophet or he wasn't if the musicians will come brother Branham in this day where he says this he said in the day that we're living in in a nation where it's been gleaned over and over and over and over by all kinds of everything well it's hard to get people to really just grasp it talk about the message like it is in a Virgin Territory you tell them they believe it and that's the way it goes on but now one will come along with this idea and one will come along with this idea and we got about it 900 and something different denominational churches and each one contrary see his teaching to the other there's got to be somebody wrong and somebody right so now the only proof of it is is bring it back to the Bible and let the Bible see now many times people put their own interpretation but we tried the very best that we can not to put any human interpretation to it just read it like it is and say that's the way it is then I've always noticed if you just take what he says it'll make everything dovetail just exactly right in the scripture it's almost like putting a jigsaw puzzle together you have to look at the pattern before you can get the puzzle right together right if you don't I've always said you'll have in your scene you'll you'll have a cow picking grass on the top of a tree it just wouldn't look right so brother Branham did not have the cowl on top of the tree he had the picture just right [Music] and when God comes everyone that has truly taken this message to heart and believed it with everything that's within them the scene is going to be the most beautiful thing because it'll be what God had in his mind it'll be the manifestation of his thoughts right there do you love the Lord for this message has come to prepare us amen amen isn't the Lord wonderful amen what what song give me the word make it plain and clear to me give me the work [Music] thank you over
