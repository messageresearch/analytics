[12:08] These dark days of
[12:12] Elijah declaring the word of the
[12:17] Lord. And these are the days of Ezekiel
[12:21] and Moses righteousness being restored.
[12:28] And though these are days of great
[12:32] trials of famine in darkness and
[12:37] sword, you are the voice in the desert,
[12:42] crying, prepare ye the way of Lord.
[12:46] Stand before he comes, rising to the

[13:04] [Music]
[13:07] salvation. And these are the days of
[13:11] Ezekiel. The dry bones become as flesh.
[13:18] And these are the days of your servant
[13:22] David rebuilding the temple of
[13:26] grave. Oh, and these are the days of the
[13:31] harvest. The fields are as wide in the
[13:36] world. And we are your labors in your
[13:41] vineyard declaring the word of the Lord.
[13:46] Behold, he comes riding on the cloud,
[13:51] shining like the sun. At the trumpet
[13:55] calls, lift your voice. Is the year of
[14:00] Jubilee and out of Zion's
[14:04] salvation
[14:07] comes. There's no God like Jehovah.
[14:10] There's no God like Jehovah. There's no
[14:14] God like Jehovah. There's no God like
[14:17] Jehovah. There's no God like Jehovah.

[14:35] trumpet call, so there's your voice.
[14:39] It's the year of
[14:40] jubilee. And out of Zion's his
[14:44] salvation comes. Behold, he comes.
[14:49] Riding on the clouds. He's shining like
[14:52] the sun at the trumpet call. So lift
[14:57] your voice. It's the year of Jubilee.

[28:31] Don't pray for
[28:33] us. We want to remember brother Lloyd
[28:35] Shepherd. He is having a lot of back
[28:37] pain and is having uh surgery early
[28:41] June. And we want to remember those who
[28:44] are sick and not able to make it. And
[28:47] also we want to remember our pastor as
[28:49] he brings forth the word and ask brother
[28:51] Amos if he wants to come lead us in
[28:53] prayer and uh pray for the request he
[28:56] had laid here.
[29:00] [Music]
[29:08] Yes. Uh, want to remember, continue to
[29:11] remember the brothers. Brother Brandon
[29:13] Green. Most of you, some of you have met
[29:16] him. West Virginia is going through uh,
[29:19] cancer treatments. And brother Steve
[29:22] Newsome. I understand he's not in the
[29:24] best of a way. He has his good days and
[29:27] bad days. We know him. My wife and I
[29:29] down in Johnson City,
[29:31] Tennessee. A lot of people are sick. God
[29:34] is still the
[29:35] healer. Amen. Brother Bob and home
[29:38] feeling well. He's got much to praise
[29:40] the Lord about. I I just want to give a
[29:43] a praise to God. You know, we were
[29:46] praying for brother
[29:47] uh uh brother brother and sister
[29:50] Farmer's
[29:51] son-in-law, Charles Bradley. Brother
[29:54] Charles Bradley.
[29:56] The other night I gave a testimony. I
[29:58] was asked to give a
[30:00] testimony. My testimony I included this
[30:03] in the testimony. If brother Charles
[30:06] Bradley knowing the tough time that he
[30:09] had while he was here, there was many a
[30:13] prayer went up for him on his behalf.
[30:17] But if he could come back and tell us
[30:18] right
[30:20] now, he would say this, "My God has been
[30:24] good to
[30:25] me." Bottom line in the
[30:28] story, I don't care sometime we've got
[30:31] to suffer. You imagine a man there, he
[30:35] can't hardly get oxygen in his blood.
[30:37] He's got a tank and he's breathing
[30:39] through oxygen.
[30:43] He's got so much to thank God for. There
[30:47] was a time in his life where he walked
[30:49] away from God. He walked
[30:52] away and he come back as a backslider.
[30:56] Recommitted his life to Jesus Christ. He
[30:58] got sick and his lungs filled with
[31:02] cancer. One thing about it, no matter
[31:05] how sick we may get, we got so much to
[31:08] thank him for. Why don't we just give
[31:10] God praise for that? Lord, tonight as we
[31:13] approach your throne of grace and mercy,
[31:16] most of all, we would say even when we
[31:19] don't feel good, we got a whole lot to
[31:22] thank you for, God, to know that we're
[31:26] at peace with you, God. There is no more
[31:30] no more wedge between you and I, dear
[31:34] God. Lord, the way is clear, Lord. Our
[31:38] bodies may be afflicted. We may be
[31:40] troubled in our spirit. But dear God,
[31:43] just to know that we're right with you
[31:46] and know that we're at peace with you.
[31:48] Father God, what more could we ask for
[31:52] to be at peace with you, dear God? So we
[31:55] thank you, God, tonight for each and
[31:57] every answered prayer. Lord, we we think
[32:00] of these requests that's laying before
[32:02] us, Brother Bob. Lord, he's had many of
[32:04] these days come and go. We don't know
[32:07] what lays down the road in front of us,
[32:09] oh God. But we're trusting by your
[32:11] grace. We pray you'd give him a special
[32:13] grace in his body. Seen him the other
[32:15] day, Father God. He looked well, dear
[32:18] God. Lord, the enemy would just come
[32:20] back in. But Lord, again, we raise his
[32:22] spirit. The sta spirit raises a
[32:25] standard. We ask it almighty God, you be
[32:27] with these two brothers. And then
[32:29] there's more just beside that. I think
[32:31] it was also mentioned another prayer
[32:33] request here just escapes my mind a
[32:35] brother shepherd dear God Lord down in
[32:38] his back dear God know what it's all
[32:40] about dear God been there many times but
[32:42] I thank you God tonight I can stand in
[32:45] front of these people and be painfree
[32:48] thank you God for many times that you
[32:51] heal my body many times Lord the same
[32:54] thing dear God oh God Lord we just thank
[32:58] you for your grace and mercy may you
[33:00] bless the remainder of the service. Each
[33:01] and everyone has a special need tonight.
[33:04] May it be met. We pray in Jesus' name.
[33:07] Amen.
[33:14] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[33:18] keeper, light in the darkness. My God,
[33:22] that is who you are. You can be seated.
[33:26] Sister Lisa, do you have a song
[33:29] tonight? Worker, promiseke keeper, light
[33:33] in the darkness. My God, that is who you
[33:37] are. You are the Lord. Way maker,
[33:42] miracle worker, promise keeper, light in
[33:46] the darkness. My God, that is who you
[33:50] are.
[34:50] If I had Hope in this life
[34:57] only I would surely
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:03] be
[35:05] miserable
[35:07] indeed. But
[35:09] this cruel world that surrounds me isn't
[35:15] really my home. You
[35:20] see only
[35:25] temporarily I have the promise of his
[35:32] coming and that is
[35:36] something that keeps me
[35:42] longing
[35:44] for a glad reunion
[35:48] day a great
[35:51] catching
[35:54] away. Come home my bride, I'll hear him
[36:01] say.
[36:05] If I can just hold on, I know that by
[36:10] and by, in the twinkling of an
[36:16] eye, I'm going to spread my wings and
[36:21] fly. I'll gladly leave this world. And
[36:26] I'm sure that I won't take the time to
[36:33] say goodbye. I believe the time is
[36:39] now. I have the promise of his
[36:46] coming and that is
[36:50] something that keeps me longing.
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:58] for a glad reunion
[37:02] day. A great
[37:05] catching
[37:08] away. Come home my bride. I'll hear him
[37:16] say, "I'm longing
[37:20] for a glad reunion day.
[37:25] A great
[37:27] catching

[38:49] I'll take the way with the Lord despised
[38:56] few. I've started with
[38:59] Jesus and I'm going through
[39:05] [Music]
[39:35] I can do all
[39:37] [Music]
[39:38] things through Christ who gives me
[39:42] strength. But sometimes I wonder what he
[39:47] can do through
[39:49] [Music]
[39:51] me. No great success to
[39:55] show. No glory of my
[39:59] own. Yet in my weakness he is there to
[40:04] let me
[40:07] know. His strength is perfect.
[40:11] When our strength is
[40:15] gone, he'll carry us. When we can't
[40:20] carry
[40:23] on, raised in his
[40:25] power, the weak become
[40:31] strong. His strength is
[40:35] perfect. His strength is perfect.
[40:42] And we can only
[40:45] know the power that he
[40:48] holds when we truly see how deep our
[40:53] weakness
[40:56] goes. His strength in us
[41:00] begins where ours comes to an end.
[41:05] He hears our humble cry and he proves
[41:11] again. His strength is
[41:13] perfect when our strength is
[41:18] gone. He'll carry us when we can't carry
[41:24] on.
[41:27] raised in his power. The weak become
[41:33] strong. His strength is
[41:37] perfect. His strength is
[41:43] perfect. And we can only
[41:47] know the power that he
[41:50] holds when we truly see how deep our
[41:55] weakness goes.
[41:58] His strength in us
[42:02] begins where ours comes to an
[42:05] end. He hears our humble cry and he
[42:10] proves
[42:12] again. His strength is
[42:15] perfect when our strength's all
[42:19] gone. He carries us when we can't carry
[42:25] on.
[42:28] Raised in his power, the weak become so
[42:34] strong. His strength is
[42:37] perfect. His strength is
[42:41] perfect. His strength is perfect. When
[42:45] our strength's all
[42:48] gone, he'll carry us when we can't can't

[43:50] up.
[43:54] Lord, come and
[43:58] quench this
[44:01] thirsting of my soul.
[44:08] Bread of
[44:12] heaven, feed me till I
[44:18] want no
[44:21] more. Here's my
[44:24] cup. Fill it up and make me whole.
[44:33] [Music]
[44:34] Oh, fill my
[44:37] cup,
[44:39] Lord. I lift it
[44:43] up,
[44:47] Lord. Come and wait.
[44:51] [Music]
[45:14] Oh,
[45:17] like
[45:19] [Music]
[45:25] it. Amen. Is that your
[45:27] desire or just to
[45:30] fill our cups
[45:33] overflowing? Amen. There's a song that's
[45:36] on my heart.
[45:38] Um, what will it be when we get
[45:45] old
[45:47] [Music]
[45:53] yonder grown on the glassy sea?
[46:02] He'll join our loved ones and crown
[46:08] Christ
[46:10] [Music]
[46:12] forever. All this is just what
[46:18] heaven means to
[46:21] me. Sing it
[46:23] again. What will it be when we get
[46:29] older?
[46:30] [Music]
[46:34] Yonder and
[46:37] join thrown around the
[46:41] glassy
[46:43] [Music]
[46:45] sea there with our loved ones and crown
[46:51] Christ forever.
[46:57] Oh, this is just what heaven
[47:02] means to
[47:06] me. Well, are you looking forward to
[47:09] that
[47:10] time to be with him? Amen. It won't be
[47:14] too much longer, I don't believe. And uh
[47:18] it's good to uh just be here this
[47:21] evening. Amen. With each and everyone.
[47:25] And it's uh good to have I believe
[47:28] brother Sam here with us. God bless you.
[47:32] And uh uh also uh good to have dad and
[47:37] mom here uh with us and and uh Judah did
[47:42] a good job for his first time and 30
[47:46] minute notice. So uh uh done a good job.
[47:50] So appreciate that. Amen. And um um if
[47:56] you have your Bibles, uh the musicians
[47:59] can be
[48:00] dismissed. But um we're going to um
[48:05] first of all, we're going to turn to the
[48:06] book of Mark, the 16th chapter.
[48:12] and
[48:18] um chapter
[48:21] 16 and
[48:28] um I'm very familiar with this scripture
[48:31] but uh Jesus talking not only to the
[48:35] disciples but to the church that he's
[48:38] promised to
[48:39] build and in the 15th U so Mark 16 and
[48:45] 15. And he said unto them, "Go ye into
[48:49] all the world and preach the gospel to
[48:51] every
[48:52] creature. And he that believeth and is
[48:54] baptized shall be saved. But he that
[48:56] believeth not shall be
[48:59] damned. And these signs shall follow
[49:01] them that believe in my name. They shall
[49:03] cast out devils. They shall speak with
[49:06] new tongues. They shall take up
[49:09] serpents. And if they drink any deadly
[49:11] thing, it shall not hurt
[49:13] them. They shall lay hands on the sick,
[49:17] and they shall
[49:18] recover. Then if you'll turn with me to
[49:21] 1 Corinthians the 3r
[49:28] chapter, 1 Corinthians the 3r
[49:35] chapter and going to read the ninth
[49:37] verse.
[49:40] It says, "For we are laborers together
[49:43] with God." Can you say that with me? We
[49:46] are laborers together with God. You are
[49:50] God's
[49:51] husbandry. You are God's building. Amen.
[49:55] If we could just bow our heads in a word
[49:57] of
[49:58] prayer. Lord
[50:00] Jesus, we just thank you for the
[50:03] opportunity to gather together together
[50:05] here on a
[50:08] midweek, Father, just to worship you and
[50:12] to to receive of you, Father. And I pray
[50:17] that you
[50:18] have received of us, Lord, uh, and that
[50:22] our praise have been pleasing to you,
[50:26] Lord, Father. and um our lives been
[50:30] pleasing to
[50:31] you. And Father, we're just asking that
[50:35] you would just come and speak to us,
[50:37] Lord, the words of eternal life. And may
[50:41] they be received within us. Help us to
[50:45] receive them by
[50:47] believing. And Lord, may it have an
[50:50] eternal effect upon us. Lord, I pray,
[50:53] Father, that you would just be glorified
[50:56] this evening and may your presence just
[50:59] uh be felt among us now. We ask it in
[51:03] Jesus Christ's name. And the church
[51:06] says, "Amen." Amen. You can have your
[51:11] seats this evening.
[51:15] um been fighting something for a little
[51:18] bit, but
[51:20] um we're
[51:23] overcomers. And so I think I think
[51:26] everyone's fighting something these
[51:28] days, huh? And so uh but uh the title
[51:32] that I would have is uh uh laboring for
[51:36] the kingdom. Laboring for the kingdom of
[51:39] God. And uh you know there's um and I'm
[51:44] just going to maybe just share from my
[51:46] heart for a few
[51:47] minutes, but um there are sure a lot of
[51:51] things that are going on in the world
[51:53] today. And
[51:56] um as as I guess most of you have heard
[51:59] the the the pope has uh passed away. And
[52:05] um I think that is significance that
[52:09] that it wasn't an accident as far as in
[52:12] God's mind. I I think there was a
[52:15] purpose. But you know I'd read where
[52:18] they're you know um talking it was in
[52:21] the New York Post I believe where
[52:23] they're talking of um an American
[52:27] president or a pope American pope. Um um
[52:31] they've got a Catholic cardinal that's
[52:34] um um up up on the the list in the
[52:38] running to be the next pope. And u I I'd
[52:43] looked it up. I I thought brother Bram
[52:45] said something about an American pope,
[52:47] but he says, "I believe one of these
[52:49] glorious days when this United
[52:51] Confederation of Church goes together
[52:55] and the new pope is brought up brought
[52:57] out of the United States and put over
[52:59] there according to prophecy, then
[53:01] they'll form an image like unto the
[53:04] beast." Yeah. And
[53:06] u and and I don't know what the future
[53:09] is. So I don't I can't say that's going
[53:11] to happen at this time, but we know it
[53:14] will happen. And and but it does it does
[53:18] get you to thinking just how close we
[53:22] are. We have of course we have received
[53:24] our last sign and that was the Messiah
[53:28] sign. But at the same time, as we're
[53:32] seeing things unfold in the world and
[53:35] and all it's doing is bringing us closer
[53:38] and closer and closer to the rapture and
[53:41] the world closer to
[53:43] tribulation and
[53:45] um so with that in mind, you know, uh
[53:49] just been thinking about these things
[53:51] and uh we we've got our meeting coming
[53:54] up and I I truly believe that this could
[53:58] be the last meeting ever that we will
[54:01] hold um uh or host. And in one sense, I
[54:06] hope so. I I hope that's because I'm
[54:08] ready. I I'd like to get out of here and
[54:12] uh to see our Lord and to to you know, I
[54:16] I just I'm ready for that time. And um
[54:21] but you know I'm I'm under
[54:24] expectation as well to see what God is
[54:27] going to do in our meetings uh coming up
[54:32] and you know uh we need God to move
[54:35] don't we? I think that is the desire of
[54:39] every believer is to see God come in a
[54:42] special way and u and and we know that
[54:47] it's uh it's pressing. I think it should
[54:50] be pressing on our hearts
[54:53] um because uh we we've got maybe loved
[54:57] ones that need to be saved. We see the
[54:59] people that are out on the streets and
[55:02] um uh that need God and and I don't
[55:06] think that a person can look out out in
[55:09] the world and not have a feeling
[55:12] uh for lost souls. And uh you know we
[55:17] yes it's troubling the way people are
[55:19] acting and and these things and I I
[55:22] don't know if the last soul is in I
[55:24] don't know but all I know is is brother
[55:27] Brandham said we'd be like that Abraham
[55:29] like Abraham going to the end of the
[55:31] road for the lost and and so I I don't
[55:35] think u I I think that we we should have
[55:38] that desire to see God do something and
[55:42] see souls saved. Do you believe that?
[55:45] And so, um, you know, I believe that,
[55:49] uh, I'm under great expectation for God
[55:51] to do things. I I know we have faced
[55:54] challenges,
[55:56] um, in one way or another. This seems
[55:59] like this year has been a real challenge
[56:02] uh, in in one thing after another, not
[56:05] working right, falling apart, sickness,
[56:08] and and uh, uh, just just whatever. But
[56:11] it does let me know that God's going to
[56:13] do something special.
[56:16] And
[56:17] um because Satan always he he works
[56:21] ahead of time when when he knows that
[56:24] God's getting ready to do something. And
[56:26] I think it was brother Brandham that
[56:28] said when he before he'd get to a
[56:30] meeting, you know, two or 3 weeks
[56:32] earlier, the the hospitals would fill
[56:34] up, the insane asylums would fill up,
[56:36] you know, because Satan was trying his
[56:39] best to stop uh what God uh was getting
[56:43] ready to do. You understand? Uh each
[56:46] year God has has blessed our meeting and
[56:50] has and has shown that he is behind it.
[56:54] Yeah. Uh uh we have witnessed
[56:56] supernatural miracles uh that God has
[57:00] done for people. And
[57:03] um you know every since I I came here 13
[57:08] years ago
[57:10] um you know uh it was my desire to have
[57:13] a meeting to where people could come and
[57:17] fellowship and uh be blessed and uh to
[57:22] where that the the message would be able
[57:24] to have a preeminence
[57:26] uh and and u uh where the the ministers
[57:31] could just preach the message without
[57:33] worrying about what kind of a quote or
[57:36] what kind of this and just preach the
[57:38] message and that the the message would
[57:41] be exalted before the people and when
[57:44] the people would leave that that their
[57:47] hearts would be solidified more and more
[57:51] to the message and that they would be
[57:53] able to see what God is doing within the
[57:56] message and and these things. And so I I
[58:00] wanted to bring in ministers that would
[58:02] do just that. And I believe by God's
[58:05] grace, we've had wonderful ministry
[58:08] uh in our meetings uh that that promote
[58:12] uh the message. And I knew that that if
[58:15] if this would happen, if if the
[58:18] ministers would just preach the message
[58:20] and and these things, then God would
[58:23] come behind it and work supernaturally.
[58:27] Uh, you know, brother Brandham said that
[58:29] the angel of the Lord accompanies the
[58:31] message always. And I truly believe
[58:34] that. I think any man, any minister
[58:36] ought to give their life to this
[58:38] message.
[58:41] And not hold back anything, but say what
[58:44] Brother Brandham said and watch the
[58:46] angel of the Lord back it up. And and in
[58:50] order for that to happen, the the the
[58:52] the minister must believe in the message
[58:54] for himself.
[58:56] uh without question. And so I I
[58:59] appreciate the men of God who have come
[59:01] and ministered in these meetings.
[59:03] They've uh put their heart into each
[59:05] service. Each one of them, I mean, they
[59:08] have come with the burden uh for the
[59:11] people. They have they have known our
[59:14] vision. They've known uh what we've
[59:17] desired. and they have put their
[59:19] shoulder with us to do their part uh to
[59:23] see that God would be pleased with the
[59:26] meeting and um you know when they come
[59:31] they've never come to exalt themselves
[59:34] uh uh to lift their own name or whatever
[59:38] but they they've come to see the people
[59:40] blessed and delivered and healed. um
[59:43] they they love the message and it shows
[59:47] through their preaching. It it uh
[59:49] because it's their life and they are
[59:51] they are dedicated to it. I I holy
[59:55] believe that the bride of Christ is the
[59:58] cream of the crop. I uh I just believe
[1:00:01] that I don't think you'll find any
[1:00:04] better well I know you won't find any
[1:00:06] better young people than that that is in
[1:00:09] the message of the hour. I don't believe
[1:00:12] that you'll find any better parent, any
[1:00:14] better preacher, any better uh officer
[1:00:18] in the church or or helper in the within
[1:00:21] the work of the Lord. You're not going
[1:00:23] to find any more finer people than in
[1:00:26] the message of the hour. It's because
[1:00:29] the message has produced this. It's a
[1:00:32] it's a pure word. It's it's God taking
[1:00:35] that word and doing a creative work
[1:00:38] within the the believer. Amen. And so,
[1:00:42] uh, I I feel honored, uh, to serve the
[1:00:46] bride of Jesus Christ. I, that's been my
[1:00:49] desire, uh, ever since just a boy is
[1:00:53] just I I wanted to help, uh, the people
[1:00:56] of God in some way
[1:00:58] somehow. And,
[1:01:00] um, I I do want to say that I I
[1:01:03] appreciate the work uh that you have,
[1:01:07] uh, put into these meetings. um uh and
[1:01:11] the work that is being put into it now
[1:01:13] for this meeting. And you know, I just
[1:01:16] felt in my heart to try to encourage uh
[1:01:19] maybe bring share a word or two of
[1:01:22] encouragement
[1:01:23] uh to you because I know what you are
[1:01:26] doing isn't easy. Anytime you do
[1:01:29] something for the Lord, it's not easy
[1:01:32] because you're part of you're part of
[1:01:36] the thing that's tearing Satan's kingdom
[1:01:38] down. And so, no matter how little it
[1:01:42] is, uh it may seem insignificant to you,
[1:01:46] but it's important because um uh you
[1:01:51] well, you have a we all have a a work to
[1:01:54] do. And so most of you who are helping
[1:01:58] with the
[1:01:59] preparations, you know, I I I see you
[1:02:02] have to get up, you go to work every
[1:02:04] morning, you work all day, then you come
[1:02:06] and you work. Uh these boys been working
[1:02:10] at the tent until 11 midnight and then
[1:02:14] tired going to bed and getting back up
[1:02:16] doing it all over again. And and then
[1:02:20] others, you know, uh dealing with health
[1:02:23] health issues. uh, Sister Kim and Sister
[1:02:27] Martha and and then I hope y'all don't
[1:02:29] mind me me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:02:29] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:02:29] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[1:02:29] me me me mentioning your name but
[1:02:31] different others and uh but but but when
[1:02:34] I see these things I see you pressing
[1:02:37] through that and uh you know you got
[1:02:40] mothers who have small children to take
[1:02:43] care of and and uh yet they come asking
[1:02:46] if there's anything that they can do and
[1:02:48] wanting just just wanting to be a part
[1:02:51] of of what they believe that God is
[1:02:55] doing and what they're looking forward
[1:02:57] to what God is going to do and to be
[1:03:00] part of it. And many of you have shown
[1:03:04] the desire to want to help and want to
[1:03:07] be part and and and are doing so. And so
[1:03:12] I think it makes a difference.
[1:03:15] Um it makes a difference when people are
[1:03:18] are willing to do something for the Lord
[1:03:22] and uh you know uh I hope it's all right
[1:03:25] but Sister Martha talking to me I think
[1:03:28] yesterday or so but you know she said
[1:03:30] don't worry about us uh we we do we're
[1:03:33] doing what we want to do and uh you know
[1:03:38] and and Sister Hope uh said to me the
[1:03:42] other day she said we want to work and
[1:03:45] she said, "We're happy to do it." And uh
[1:03:48] her and you know uh Sister Becky have
[1:03:51] for the past 2 or 3 years uh they've
[1:03:54] they volunteered to to make 600 to 800
[1:03:58] biscuits and in a single day for the
[1:04:01] meeting and and they volunteered it even
[1:04:03] to do it again this year if need be. And
[1:04:07] uh because the heart is is there and of
[1:04:10] course you know I uh uh uh you you see
[1:04:15] different ones uh getting together. I
[1:04:18] and I I'll be honest I couldn't do it
[1:04:21] with without a a a group of people. Uh
[1:04:24] you know we got brother Kevin in charge
[1:04:26] of the music and he's he's he's getting
[1:04:29] everything organized. Brother TM getting
[1:04:31] everything organized and uh you brothers
[1:04:34] are showing uh other brothers are
[1:04:37] showing the desire to to eagerness to do
[1:04:40] something for God and and these things
[1:04:43] and even up to Sister Jane 86 years old,
[1:04:47] right? You're 86. Nope. 87. Yep. And see
[1:04:51] my memory is failing me. Sister Jane.
[1:04:54] Amen. but uh uh 87 years old and and
[1:04:59] asking to help wanting to do something
[1:05:02] and uh where she is needed and and I
[1:05:05] know there some of you elders aren't
[1:05:07] able to do just to do a whole lot due to
[1:05:10] uh circumstances
[1:05:13] and but even then you've shown that you
[1:05:16] want to do something baking dessert
[1:05:18] cookies whatever whatever is asked uh
[1:05:21] because it's just something that it's a
[1:05:24] willingness
[1:05:26] uh to to to want to uh uh help. And you
[1:05:31] know uh to me it's it's it's the thing
[1:05:34] that brother Brandham prayed for uh when
[1:05:38] he he said, "God, make ministers out of
[1:05:40] these people here. Make workers and
[1:05:42] helpers in every church. Put their souls
[1:05:46] of fire, knowing that they can't stay
[1:05:48] much longer. The hour is drawing nigh
[1:05:52] when the son of god shall come. Ain't
[1:05:54] that right? And so uh uh if needing
[1:05:59] workers, needing ministers, needing
[1:06:02] people to work for the kingdom, to labor
[1:06:05] for the kingdom is is such a time it's
[1:06:10] needed because the hour is is drawing
[1:06:13] late. And I know there's people that
[1:06:15] draw that opinion. Well, we're just
[1:06:16] preaching to the lost or or this this.
[1:06:20] Well, maybe we are, but that's not for
[1:06:23] me to decide. But I I do know that if if
[1:06:27] we have God, there's a love of God
[1:06:30] within us. And I do know that God is
[1:06:32] long-suffering. God is forbearing. And
[1:06:35] God is patient. And and he's, you know,
[1:06:39] and and we say he's the Bible says he's
[1:06:41] not willing that any man should perish.
[1:06:44] And so, um, I I I think it behooves us
[1:06:47] to do everything that we know to do
[1:06:50] until the Lord comes. Amen. I would
[1:06:53] rather wear out than rust out. I I would
[1:06:57] rather, you know, I think uh uh Sister
[1:07:00] Martha again if paraphrase, but she
[1:07:04] said, "I'd rather be exhausted and just
[1:07:07] where I can't do hardly anything because
[1:07:10] I'd done something for God than just uh
[1:07:13] sit around and not do anything." And and
[1:07:16] I I I feel the same way and I'm sure you
[1:07:19] do, too. Um but but I feel you're like
[1:07:23] the house of Stephanus. I believe is is
[1:07:26] the how you would pronounce that that
[1:07:28] Paul made mention of in his letter uh to
[1:07:33] the Corinthians uh there in 1
[1:07:35] Corinthians
[1:07:36] 16:15. But he said this, they have
[1:07:39] addicted themselves to the ministry of
[1:07:42] the saints. They've addicted themselves.
[1:07:45] Now, we all know what addicted is. It's
[1:07:48] it's a habit. It's something you just
[1:07:50] can't stop. You can't quit. It's
[1:07:53] something part of you. It drives you. It
[1:07:55] just no matter if you say just I'm going
[1:07:58] to quit. I'm going to quit drinking. I'm
[1:07:59] going to quit smoking. But you're if
[1:08:01] you're addicted to it, you're going to
[1:08:03] pick it right back up again. Well, these
[1:08:05] these were addicted to the ministry of
[1:08:09] the saints. Amen. And and then in the
[1:08:13] 16th verse, he said to the brethren,
[1:08:16] submit yourselves unto such. See, and to
[1:08:20] everyone that helpeth with us and labor.
[1:08:23] He says, "I am I am glad of the coming
[1:08:26] of Stephanus and the other two men that
[1:08:30] I can't pronounce. For that which was
[1:08:34] lacking on your part, they have
[1:08:37] supplied." Amen. And so they show that
[1:08:40] they were working with Paul. They were
[1:08:42] something that maybe Paul Paul couldn't
[1:08:45] just do everything. And and so he he was
[1:08:49] relying upon these men. And he says,
[1:08:52] "For they have refreshed my spirit and
[1:08:55] yours. Therefore, acknowledge ye them
[1:08:59] that are such." Amen. So, so one writer
[1:09:04] would say, uh, speaking of this, they
[1:09:06] have committed themselves,
[1:09:09] uh, to serve the saints. They they they
[1:09:11] they maybe not were preachers, maybe
[1:09:14] they weren't musicians, maybe they
[1:09:16] whatever, but they've committed
[1:09:18] themselves to to to serve. Amen. in in
[1:09:22] whatever capacity. See, and supplying
[1:09:25] their wants, helping and assisting them
[1:09:29] upon all occasions, both in their
[1:09:32] temporal and spiritual
[1:09:34] concerns. Amen. Amen. See, so they were
[1:09:37] helpers in the kingdom of God, laborers.
[1:09:40] Ain't that right? And so we know we know
[1:09:45] that there will be people who will
[1:09:46] receive eternal life just by simply
[1:09:49] being good to the bride of Christ. And
[1:09:51] and they will make it into heaven just
[1:09:54] just because of that. And I think well
[1:09:57] well what what did they do? Well, the
[1:09:59] Bible says they they clothed they
[1:10:01] clothed them. They provided clothes for
[1:10:04] them and and and when they were naked um
[1:10:07] they visited them in the prisons. They
[1:10:10] gave them drink of water or a drink when
[1:10:12] they were thirsty. They they fed them
[1:10:15] and and all of these things. And yet
[1:10:18] they didn't even know they did it. And
[1:10:20] this now this is not the bride. This is
[1:10:23] people that will make it into eternal
[1:10:25] life by being good to the bride. And
[1:10:28] they didn't even know they did it. They
[1:10:30] just had a heart to help. They just
[1:10:32] wanted to help. And and so brother
[1:10:35] Brandham said, "See, don't fail to get
[1:10:37] this church. Keep this in your heart
[1:10:39] forever. It was so unconsciously done.
[1:10:43] The people don't do it for a line of
[1:10:45] duty. See, a man that gives you
[1:10:48] something or other because he ought to
[1:10:50] do. See, a man that feeds you because he
[1:10:53] ought to do it, he's got a selfish idea.
[1:10:55] It should be your very life, your very
[1:10:58] action. Ain't that right? Well, then I
[1:11:00] got to thinking if if God's going to
[1:11:02] honor them for just being good to the
[1:11:04] bride, his people, what does he think
[1:11:07] about bride being good to bride? Yeah.
[1:11:09] Come on. And and bride serving other
[1:11:12] members of the bride and and especially
[1:11:15] when when we know uh the the power of
[1:11:18] this and the power of unity and and you
[1:11:23] understand. And so, Brother Brandham
[1:11:25] says, "Here's a lovely thing. As you
[1:11:27] serve one another, you're serving God.
[1:11:31] As you serve, not serving yourself, but
[1:11:33] you're serving God as you serve one
[1:11:35] another. And so, this is what I have
[1:11:38] found in you is a a willingness to
[1:11:41] serve. And I've been asked many times,
[1:11:44] and several of you, I'm sure, have been
[1:11:47] asked by different ones outside the
[1:11:49] churches, how do you do it? How how do
[1:11:52] you hold a meeting like that? how how
[1:11:54] you know we know you're a small church,
[1:11:56] but how do you do it? You know, and and
[1:11:59] I was telling one man, I I said, "Well,
[1:12:02] you just got to know my people. You the
[1:12:04] people there at the church, they've got
[1:12:06] a heart to serve." He goes, "Man," he
[1:12:08] said, "I I sure wish we we could get our
[1:12:10] church to do that, you know, and uh and
[1:12:14] you know, but but it's nothing. It's
[1:12:16] it's not magic. It's just the God uh
[1:12:20] that that has given given you a
[1:12:22] willingness to want to do something for
[1:12:25] the Lord. I'll tell you uh uh the the
[1:12:29] vision that I had, I believe God gave it
[1:12:31] to me. Uh the desire that I've had is I
[1:12:34] I it couldn't have been I couldn't have
[1:12:36] done it on my own.
[1:12:38] And um but but we find that uh uh this
[1:12:43] is uh you you have a willingness to
[1:12:46] serve and and and then I find that it's
[1:12:49] not only in our just in our local
[1:12:51] assembly uh but there are brothers and
[1:12:53] sisters from the churches uh outside of
[1:12:57] of our church just volunteering to help
[1:12:59] in any way that they can. And and it's
[1:13:03] it's because it's it's truly a labor of
[1:13:07] love. And that's what Paul called it is
[1:13:09] a labor of love. Not a labor of duty,
[1:13:13] but it's a labor of love. And there's
[1:13:15] there God's got people all around. And
[1:13:18] to think that when it just seems like we
[1:13:21] just can't do it, God just moves on
[1:13:23] somebody else to come along and say, "We
[1:13:27] want to be a part of this." And and and
[1:13:29] and they help. And and I thank God for
[1:13:33] that. And but notice what Paul, the
[1:13:35] Apostle Paul, he says here in in in uh
[1:13:39] Hebrews
[1:13:40] 6:10, he says, "For God is not
[1:13:43] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:13:45] labor of love, which you have showed
[1:13:48] toward his name in that you have
[1:13:50] ministered to the saints and do
[1:13:53] minister." Ain't that right? Now, we
[1:13:55] know so, so God's not not unrighteous.
[1:13:58] He He won't forget your labor of love. I
[1:14:00] know maybe the reward here on the earth,
[1:14:03] you're not getting paid for it and and
[1:14:05] and you're spending maybe many hours and
[1:14:08] hours and it's wearing on your body and
[1:14:10] and you're not maybe seeing the the the
[1:14:13] well, you're not getting paid by the
[1:14:15] hour for it. Uh but but God's got a
[1:14:19] reward uh uh for you. And and that's
[1:14:22] what the Paul is saying is and that's a
[1:14:24] promise that God will not forget your
[1:14:27] your work, your labor of love that you
[1:14:30] have shown toward the saints. And so uh
[1:14:34] um uh you know we we've talked about it
[1:14:38] throughout the times here uh is that
[1:14:41] Moses God gave Moses that vision of on
[1:14:45] on building the tabernacle and and what
[1:14:48] to do and well God gave him that vision
[1:14:51] and and but but God the being a wise God
[1:14:55] knew that Moses couldn't do all of that
[1:14:58] but he would give Moses helpers and and
[1:15:02] give them a willing heart. And then he
[1:15:05] would put his spirit of wisdom uh upon
[1:15:09] these uh these these uh uh helpers and
[1:15:12] and they they would work to make that
[1:15:15] vision become a reality. Ain't that
[1:15:18] right? If you look in the even in the
[1:15:20] first church age, there's always there
[1:15:22] there was helpers even then. um uh and
[1:15:26] and in the church and and uh Jesus uh
[1:15:31] here addresses them uh thou hast labored
[1:15:35] for my name's sake and hast not fainted.
[1:15:39] Thou has labored for my name's sake and
[1:15:41] hast not fainted. And and I like what
[1:15:43] brother Brandham said about these
[1:15:45] laborers. He said these believers
[1:15:48] weren't laboring for Paul
[1:15:51] or for an organization. Amen. See, they
[1:15:54] they weren't doing this for a man. Uh
[1:15:57] they weren't doing it for a denomination
[1:15:59] or some uh organization. They weren't
[1:16:02] committed to programs and institutions
[1:16:05] whereby they built up holdings of a
[1:16:08] value. They worked for the Lord. Ain't
[1:16:12] that right? That's what labors of love.
[1:16:15] That's why he would say, "You've done it
[1:16:17] in my name." Amen. And and and so they
[1:16:20] worked for the Lord. They were his
[1:16:23] servants, not the pawns of an
[1:16:25] organization.
[1:16:27] Can you say amen? And so this is where I
[1:16:30] I I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:16:33] that's what you're doing. You're working
[1:16:35] for the Lord in whatever you do, you're
[1:16:38] working for the Lord. And and I truly
[1:16:41] believe that in the beginning, God uh
[1:16:44] had made man his helper. As we know, uh,
[1:16:48] brother Ram told us these things and and
[1:16:52] even though man had failed, God never
[1:16:55] changed his purpose, uh, for
[1:16:59] mankind and and his desire became, I
[1:17:02] would say, it just become so greater to
[1:17:05] see that man had fallen from where he
[1:17:07] come from and what he was ordained to be
[1:17:10] and he was entrapped in sin and Satan
[1:17:13] using him and and and tripping him up.
[1:17:16] It it must have God's love just must
[1:17:19] have just just got greater for mankind.
[1:17:23] But the Bible says that for God so loved
[1:17:25] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:17:27] son that whosoever should believe in him
[1:17:30] would not perish but have everlasting
[1:17:32] life. And so so we look that that it it
[1:17:36] it was love that caused God to act. It
[1:17:40] it was love that God that caused God to
[1:17:42] leave the comforts of the throne to to
[1:17:45] to leave the comforts of angels bowing
[1:17:48] down before him and and constantly
[1:17:52] praising him ne never taking a breath
[1:17:55] just constantly holy, holy, holy, holy.
[1:17:58] And it was God's love that caused him to
[1:18:01] leave all of that atmosphere, a a
[1:18:03] glorious atmosphere, a heavenly
[1:18:05] atmosphere, to come into an atmosphere
[1:18:08] of sinners and hate and and malice and
[1:18:14] despitefully using him and and all of
[1:18:17] these things and and and so uh uh it but
[1:18:21] it was love that caused him to act. And
[1:18:25] you you may see someone that you love in
[1:18:27] danger and you see them in danger, but
[1:18:29] you love them and you're doing
[1:18:30] everything you can to to help them and
[1:18:34] you're scheming up a plan. You're
[1:18:36] working this out and you don't care if
[1:18:39] they're if they're drowning. You'll go
[1:18:40] out there. You ain't going to think
[1:18:42] nothing of it. You'll you'll do whatever
[1:18:44] you can to save them. It's like that
[1:18:46] mother that had that uh baby, you know,
[1:18:49] her daughter in the fire and she just
[1:18:51] took off running after that baby and she
[1:18:53] clothed that baby, protected that baby,
[1:18:56] didn't care about herself, she ended up
[1:18:58] so scarred and all that, but she saved
[1:19:00] that baby of hers. Well, that's what God
[1:19:04] did.
[1:19:05] Amen. He did that. Amen. And he went
[1:19:08] into action to save us. And when when so
[1:19:11] when God came from spirit from heaven
[1:19:15] into that human tabernacle he his love
[1:19:19] that same love was expressed in a human
[1:19:23] body toward the people. Jesus as as we
[1:19:27] know brother said Jesus was God's love
[1:19:30] gift to mankind.
[1:19:32] And Matthew
[1:19:36] uh Matthew 20 and 28 says, "The son of
[1:19:39] man came not to be ministered unto, but
[1:19:42] to minister." Think of that. God sent
[1:19:44] his son into the world and and yet he
[1:19:47] came not to be ministered. He didn't He
[1:19:49] didn't want to be ministered to. He He
[1:19:52] wasn't seeking to be ministered to. He
[1:19:54] came to minister
[1:19:57] uh uh and give his life a ransom for
[1:20:01] many. Ain't that right? And and Romans
[1:20:04] 5'8 says, "God commendeth his love
[1:20:06] toward us in that while we were yet
[1:20:08] sinners, Christ died for us." So see,
[1:20:11] Christ didn't go to Calvary. He didn't
[1:20:13] go to the cross
[1:20:15] begrudgingly. Amen. And and and saying,
[1:20:18] "I don't know why I was picked to go
[1:20:21] this way. I don't know why my life is
[1:20:24] this, and I guess I'll do it." And and
[1:20:27] you know, and and they're pushing him.
[1:20:30] The Bible says they led him. He was led
[1:20:32] to Calvary. Not pushed, not forced, not
[1:20:35] shoved, but he was led to Calvary. And
[1:20:39] and and and Jesus even said, "No man
[1:20:42] taketh my life from me. I lay it down."
[1:20:46] He willingly laid it down because it was
[1:20:49] God in him. And that same love that
[1:20:52] caused God to to leave heaven and leave
[1:20:56] all of the splendor to come into a human
[1:20:59] body to feel your pain, to feel your
[1:21:01] suffering, that God's love was bleeding
[1:21:05] in that heart. It was beating and it
[1:21:07] drove him to Calvary. Amen. And and of
[1:21:12] course, we've said it before that Christ
[1:21:14] didn't die from loss of blood and
[1:21:16] bleeding out and all these things. He
[1:21:18] died of a broken heart.
[1:21:20] And that's what a prophet said. And so
[1:21:24] uh uh his his entire life was spent for
[1:21:29] others, right?
[1:21:31] And and uh that's what brother Brandham
[1:21:34] said. Uh spent for others is what the
[1:21:36] Bible says. And and and this word spent
[1:21:40] is means used up,
[1:21:43] consumed, worn out. And and so it wasn't
[1:21:47] that he just lived for others, but he
[1:21:50] spent his life for others. It it it
[1:21:54] consumed him. It it his life was used up
[1:21:58] for others and and worn out for others.
[1:22:03] Amen. And so this is exactly what Paul
[1:22:07] in his ministry
[1:22:10] uh uh was saying when he told the
[1:22:13] church, I will very gladly spend and be
[1:22:18] respent or be spent for you. Amen. So
[1:22:22] Paul's life, his Christian life, we all
[1:22:25] know that he had he had the zeal, a man
[1:22:29] uh uh to serve God, but he without
[1:22:32] revelation, he was persecuting the the
[1:22:34] believers and and throwning them into
[1:22:37] prison, treating them rotten and and all
[1:22:40] of these things. You know, it's just
[1:22:42] about as bad as when we talk about each
[1:22:44] other and and and we do things that that
[1:22:48] we shouldn't do to one another and and
[1:22:50] all of these things. But see, that's
[1:22:52] what Paul was doing. Amen. And and he
[1:22:55] was persecuting them and and all of
[1:22:58] that. And and yet these believers, they
[1:23:01] weren't out there drinking and living
[1:23:03] hypocrite life. They they they were just
[1:23:06] just living for Christ. They were
[1:23:09] Christians. And and so in Paul's
[1:23:12] conversion, Amen. he realized that, oh
[1:23:15] it, I'm persecuting people that love
[1:23:18] God. I'm persecuting people that God is
[1:23:21] that they're the elect of God. And so in
[1:23:25] instead of persecuting them, Brother
[1:23:27] Brandham said it must have got to Paul
[1:23:29] when when he watched uh uh uh the deacon
[1:23:33] uh Stephen uh he's the one that that uh
[1:23:37] consented to Steven's death. and and and
[1:23:41] he watched Steven die and it it got to
[1:23:44] Paul so bad that Paul just couldn't
[1:23:47] hardly live with himself in how he
[1:23:50] treated Stephen and and and so um but
[1:23:54] but see he he lived his life after his
[1:23:57] conversion
[1:23:59] uh uh being spent for for the people.
[1:24:03] Ain't that right? And so, Brother Bram
[1:24:05] said, "A man that lives for himself
[1:24:07] doesn't have eternal life." Amen. And
[1:24:10] and I think this is why people and and
[1:24:13] and I'm not being hard toward people,
[1:24:16] but at the same time, there has to be
[1:24:18] answer for everything. And and uh I
[1:24:21] think and and so, Brother Brandham gives
[1:24:23] us that. And uh I think that's why
[1:24:26] people just may not understand why we
[1:24:28] work so hard for these meetings and and
[1:24:31] in in preparation and things. Um uh it's
[1:24:35] it's you know it's it's just something
[1:24:37] that we we want to do for God. And uh
[1:24:42] you know I may not have the type of
[1:24:44] ministry uh to travel around the world
[1:24:47] and hold great meetings and and uh uh be
[1:24:52] an impact to the world uh like a lot of
[1:24:56] evangelists are and ministers and things
[1:24:59] like that. I may not be as talented as a
[1:25:02] lot of folks are and and in in areas or
[1:25:05] or whatever, but see, I got something to
[1:25:08] do for God, right? And and and with that
[1:25:13] and and and and I see God blessing it. I
[1:25:16] if there's anything I see God blessing,
[1:25:18] I see God blessing our meeting. Amen.
[1:25:21] God has blessed it uh abundantly uh in
[1:25:25] ways uh things that maybe we didn't
[1:25:28] think it would ever work out and and I
[1:25:31] don't care if it's from money to
[1:25:34] monetarial things that we just needed or
[1:25:37] uh finding a place for a a a meeting and
[1:25:41] just everything. God just worked it all
[1:25:44] out. And and and we we just stand there
[1:25:47] and just in awe at what God has done.
[1:25:51] And and I I think most of us at least
[1:25:54] could could say amen to that. And and so
[1:25:58] uh I I I you know I I got something that
[1:26:02] I can do. And I I see people getting
[1:26:05] saved, delivered, filled with the Holy
[1:26:07] Ghost. I I see people's lives changing
[1:26:10] directions. So, it lets me know I don't
[1:26:12] have to go around the world to see this
[1:26:15] to happen. I I don't have to be some
[1:26:18] great preacher. I don't have to be some
[1:26:20] uh great talented individual. Amen. To
[1:26:23] see God do something. I I can actually
[1:26:26] do something for God and watch God.
[1:26:28] Amen. Honor what I'm doing. Honor the
[1:26:31] labor that I'm doing because I'm in his
[1:26:35] will. Can you say amen? And it may not
[1:26:38] be filling up our church, but I am
[1:26:40] believing it's filling up the body of
[1:26:42] Christ. And that's the main thing.
[1:26:44] That's what we want. We're not doing
[1:26:46] these things to fill up our church and
[1:26:48] about Faith Tabernacle or about Shawn
[1:26:50] Martin and about how good we are. I just
[1:26:53] want to see souls saved.
[1:26:56] I want to see young people get the Holy
[1:26:58] Ghost.
[1:27:00] I I I want that. I I know there's people
[1:27:03] that have come to our meetings and just
[1:27:05] total
[1:27:08] despair and leave with
[1:27:11] victory. That's worth it all. Can you
[1:27:15] say
[1:27:15] amen? And so whatever way that God uses
[1:27:20] me to make that
[1:27:21] happen, I will gladly
[1:27:24] do. And not do it because it's easy and
[1:27:27] not do it because it's comfortable.
[1:27:31] But I I want to be as
[1:27:33] Paul. I'm glad to be
[1:27:36] spent and I'll be
[1:27:38] respentent for the sake of the
[1:27:42] people. See, it's there always has to be
[1:27:45] the right kind of motive when laboring
[1:27:47] for the kingdom of
[1:27:49] God.
[1:27:51] And brother Bram says what the death of
[1:27:54] Christ was was the sanctified church
[1:27:56] that he might work through to continue
[1:27:58] his work. The other place we God's
[1:28:01] purpose we find here in sending the Holy
[1:28:04] Spirit was one purpose that he might him
[1:28:07] that God himself uh might dwell in his
[1:28:11] church and continue his plans through
[1:28:14] the church that God was in Christ
[1:28:17] continuing his plans through Christ and
[1:28:19] out of Christ and to the church
[1:28:21] continuing his work through the church.
[1:28:23] Can you say amen? Uh, brother Brandham
[1:28:26] in his prayer, he said, "You're here in
[1:28:28] the form of the Holy Ghost to work
[1:28:30] through your church to heal and to
[1:28:33] save." You believe that? Amen. So, so
[1:28:37] this is why we're here. Amen. Uh this is
[1:28:40] why he's filled us with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:43] to use us, put us in a place to where we
[1:28:47] can labor for the kingdom of God to see
[1:28:51] so saved, to see so healed and and we
[1:28:55] can't look at it as though it's
[1:28:57] impossible and we ain't got the means.
[1:29:00] And if you've got God in you, you have
[1:29:02] the means. You have the means to destroy
[1:29:05] Satan in your home, in people's lives,
[1:29:09] in in in in in all of these things. I
[1:29:13] just believe that you got loved ones
[1:29:15] that need saved. You've got the power.
[1:29:17] It's in you. And and and that's what
[1:29:20] God's got you here for is so he can work
[1:29:23] through you to make you a helper for
[1:29:26] him.
[1:29:32] In our opening scripture, we read the
[1:29:34] last commission that Jesus gave the
[1:29:36] church. Go ye into all the world and
[1:29:38] preach the gospel. So So, and I'm going
[1:29:40] to hurry, but stay with me. But the the
[1:29:43] main thing is the gospel, right? The
[1:29:46] gospel must be preached. Amen. And and
[1:29:49] and that that was the main the
[1:29:52] responsibility to the church is make
[1:29:54] sure the gospel is preached. preach the
[1:29:56] gospel around the world. The world's got
[1:29:58] to hear the gospel. And these signs
[1:30:01] shall follow them that believe, right?
[1:30:03] In my name, they're going to cast out
[1:30:05] devils. They shall speak with new
[1:30:07] tongues. They shall take up serpents.
[1:30:09] And if they drink any deadly thing, it
[1:30:11] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[1:30:12] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:30:15] wherever the gospel is. And the prophet
[1:30:18] said, see, the gospel is to be dis
[1:30:20] demonstrated with power.
[1:30:23] That's what makes us come under
[1:30:25] expectation. Every time the gospel, true
[1:30:28] gospel, the message of the hour is
[1:30:30] preached. We're under expectation to see
[1:30:33] God do
[1:30:34] something. Ain't I ain't just saying I'm
[1:30:36] wondering if God's going to do
[1:30:38] something. I'm believing God's going to
[1:30:39] do it. I'm believing God to save your
[1:30:42] loved ones. I'm I'm believing God to to
[1:30:45] bring a deliverance to those that are
[1:30:47] bound. I'm just believing it. That's the
[1:30:50] gospel. Amen.
[1:30:55] Right. Uh 1 Thessalonians 1:5, Paul
[1:30:58] says, "Our gospel came not unto you in
[1:31:00] word only, but also in power and in the
[1:31:02] Holy Ghost." So what is the purpose of
[1:31:06] the gospel being preached? Why? What?
[1:31:09] What? What is this purpose? As brother
[1:31:10] Bram said, if men could realize that
[1:31:12] preaching the gospel isn't to get more
[1:31:14] members in the church, but it's
[1:31:17] consecration to the purpose of the task
[1:31:19] that we must have newborn babes into the
[1:31:22] kingdom of God. Can you say amen?
[1:31:28] So, we don't preach to build up our own
[1:31:29] ministry. We're not preaching to uh
[1:31:31] these preachers don't preach to to build
[1:31:34] up their thing and and and and again
[1:31:36] faith tabernacle or fill up some other
[1:31:38] church or whatever. We just filling up
[1:31:41] the kingdom of God. We want to see
[1:31:43] people birth into the kingdom of God.
[1:31:47] And and when the true gospel is
[1:31:49] preached, then we know that that
[1:31:51] predestinated seed is is hears it.
[1:31:54] They're going to believe it. It's and
[1:31:56] and and I don't care how how hard Satan
[1:31:59] is working and and and what what Satan
[1:32:03] has bound up in their lives. Amen. I've
[1:32:07] seen you you you surely you've seen it,
[1:32:09] too. You've seen people come into the
[1:32:11] house of God with complexes and baggage
[1:32:15] is all over them by the devil and and
[1:32:17] and and all these things and and and let
[1:32:21] God get a hold of him. And and it he he
[1:32:25] he does things that no psychologist can
[1:32:27] do. He does things that no doctor can
[1:32:30] do. He does things that medication can't
[1:32:32] do. He just he just knows how to do it.
[1:32:35] And it's through the preaching of the
[1:32:37] gospel and then the power of God goes to
[1:32:41] work in their
[1:32:43] lives. Well, it did it for the woman at
[1:32:45] the well, right? Amen. It did it for
[1:32:49] Peter. It it did it for the the the uh
[1:32:52] the the saints. It it did it did it for
[1:32:55] me. It did it for you, did it not?
[1:32:58] You're a result of of not because mom
[1:33:01] and dad brought you to church and you're
[1:33:03] sitting there now you just grew up. No,
[1:33:06] you the the power of the gospel had an
[1:33:09] effect upon our
[1:33:11] lives. Amen. And and it did it to you
[1:33:14] know to the people who heard Paul preach
[1:33:17] the gospel. You know according to the
[1:33:19] Bible you know the believers in
[1:33:21] Thessalonica I believe Paul says turn to
[1:33:23] God from idols to serve the living and
[1:33:26] true God. Why? Because he come to a
[1:33:29] heathen people and he just began to
[1:33:31] preach the gospel to them and somehow
[1:33:34] the power of God reached that soul and
[1:33:38] turned them around. That's what makes
[1:33:40] the difference. And and the gospel, how
[1:33:43] many believes the gospel is still
[1:33:45] working today? It ain't changed its
[1:33:48] power. It's not lost its effectiveness.
[1:33:51] Amen. It's effective. Amen. And and so
[1:33:55] it it breaks the power over over a
[1:33:58] person's life and and changes them for
[1:34:02] eternity. I I just believe that. And and
[1:34:05] so the gospel was to be preached to
[1:34:08] everyone in the world so that people
[1:34:10] would have a chance to believe.
[1:34:15] Ain't that right? Amen. We're We're not
[1:34:18] to get We're not here to get people to
[1:34:20] believe in a doctor. We're not here to
[1:34:22] get people Even though doctors are fine.
[1:34:25] Amen. We use them. We're not here to get
[1:34:28] people to believe in scientific
[1:34:29] discovery. Even though we use the
[1:34:32] progress that science has made in some
[1:34:34] ways of cars, electric, and and all
[1:34:36] these things, we're not here to get
[1:34:38] people to believe in educated facts and
[1:34:40] all that. You see, our purpose as
[1:34:42] Christians is to get people saved, to
[1:34:46] get them to believe. Can you say amen?
[1:34:49] Paul, you know, the Philip Philippian
[1:34:51] jailer asked Paul and Silas, "What must
[1:34:53] I do to be saved?" And Paul just told
[1:34:55] him, says, "Well, believe on the Lord
[1:34:57] Jesus Christ, and thee and thy house
[1:35:00] shall be saved." Don't look to me. Don't
[1:35:02] look to Silas. Don't look to some
[1:35:04] church. Just believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:35:07] Christ. And church, if if there's
[1:35:10] anybody that has a has the power to show
[1:35:13] Jesus Christ, it's us believers.
[1:35:17] This message is Christ. That's right.
[1:35:21] You believe it?
[1:35:23] Therefore, it lays upon us. See, the
[1:35:26] soul the soul of man should be our main
[1:35:29] concern more than any materialistic or
[1:35:31] monetary thing. It is the souls of
[1:35:36] man. Brother Brandham talked of how uh
[1:35:40] beautiful Phoenix was. And yet he said
[1:35:42] it's so len down with sin. And Billy
[1:35:45] Paul said, "Well then, Dad, why are we
[1:35:47] here? Why why are you coming here? Why
[1:35:49] do why do you do that?" And his reply
[1:35:52] was, "All over this city is scattered
[1:35:54] the church of the living God. It's that
[1:35:57] group we're holding up before God. It's
[1:35:59] the saints." He said, "As Paul must have
[1:36:02] looked upon Rome with its many thousands
[1:36:06] of population as different places that
[1:36:08] he went, he would see the city turned
[1:36:10] over to idolatry. But there was jewels
[1:36:13] in that city that he had to labor for.
[1:36:16] Can you say amen? I don't know what's
[1:36:19] here in Blackburg, Christiansburg, and
[1:36:22] around the surrounding area. I don't
[1:36:23] know. But there's got to be some jewel
[1:36:25] that we got to labor for. Can you say
[1:36:28] amen? So I'm telling you, your labor is
[1:36:29] not in vain. Amen. One soul, this our
[1:36:33] names will be attached. Amen. To that.
[1:36:37] Can you say amen for eternity? Amen. And
[1:36:40] brother Bram said, "See, the soul is the
[1:36:42] most important thing of anything in the
[1:36:44] mortal cuz that's the thing that lasts
[1:36:47] forever." Can you say amen? So the soul
[1:36:51] of mankind
[1:36:53] uh will be the most important thing to
[1:36:55] any God-called preacher because they
[1:36:58] have the same heart that Jesus had. They
[1:37:00] have God within them. And and so you
[1:37:04] know uh as as I've said you know there
[1:37:07] are there are souls maybe not even
[1:37:09] around here. Uh well I know there are
[1:37:11] around here but but but we're not just
[1:37:14] talking of here. There's people have
[1:37:15] come from all over uh to these meetings
[1:37:18] and and you know there's souls that need
[1:37:21] to be saved. There's souls that maybe uh
[1:37:26] need to be uh uh delivered from from
[1:37:30] complexes, from scars, from habits. And
[1:37:34] maybe people are uh uh in inflicted with
[1:37:39] sickness and disease. And you know,
[1:37:41] maybe young people that growed up in the
[1:37:43] message and yet they're they're fighting
[1:37:45] things in their mind and Satan's trying
[1:37:48] to tell them, "You've crossed the line."
[1:37:50] and and all of these things. And they
[1:37:52] need the gospel. I don't you know, they
[1:37:55] need the gospel to be preached to them.
[1:37:58] And this is why we labor for the kingdom
[1:38:00] of God, right? Whether you're a preacher
[1:38:03] or a lay member. And I think if we are
[1:38:06] convinced of the power that this gospel
[1:38:08] holds, then we'll be convinced that it
[1:38:11] is the gospel that people need.
[1:38:15] Yep. We could be investing our time in
[1:38:17] having a circus. We could be investing
[1:38:19] our time in, you know, having amusement
[1:38:22] park for the church. We We could be
[1:38:25] investing our time for a lot of things,
[1:38:27] but we're convinced there's one thing
[1:38:29] that people need, and that is the gospel
[1:38:33] of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:37] Are you convinced of that? I know you
[1:38:40] are. Because again, the gospel destroys
[1:38:45] demon powers from the people's lives.
[1:38:48] Not every man is called to preach. Not
[1:38:51] everyone is
[1:38:52] called. But if a man is called to preach
[1:38:56] and that calling comes from
[1:38:59] God and a preacher, a preacher is is a
[1:39:04] minister of the gospel. He's and he's
[1:39:06] God's helper. And brother Graham said,
[1:39:09] "Any man that's called to preach the
[1:39:10] gospel is called to heal the
[1:39:13] sick." I believe he's called to save the
[1:39:16] soul. And you know what I mean by all
[1:39:19] that? Of course, you can't heal the sick
[1:39:21] in in
[1:39:22] in having power in only God heals,
[1:39:27] right? Only God saves the soul. Only God
[1:39:31] delivers the people. But see, God works
[1:39:34] through that preacher. He's called. God
[1:39:37] gave him something to preach the gospel
[1:39:39] with. And and he's called. And brother
[1:39:41] Bram said, "The most important thing of
[1:39:43] the day is a good God-scent preacher."
[1:39:46] Aren't you glad for God-Scent preachers?
[1:39:48] I'm so glad for that. Brother Bram said,
[1:39:50] "The closest the pulpit is the closest
[1:39:53] place to heaven on earth, the pulpit."
[1:39:56] Why? This is old piece of wood, but it's
[1:39:59] what's behind it. It's what's coming
[1:40:01] forth. It's the word of God. It can
[1:40:05] change people's directions.
[1:40:08] It can deliver people from hell.
[1:40:11] It can change them so dramatically. Put
[1:40:14] families together.
[1:40:18] Could do it all. Brother Aram said,
[1:40:20] "Which has the greatest authority? An
[1:40:22] angel from heaven or an angel at the
[1:40:24] pulpit?" Then he says, "It's the angel
[1:40:27] at the pulpit."
[1:40:28] Why? There's an authority because it's
[1:40:30] the word of God. Can you say amen? So,
[1:40:35] so a God- called preacher of the day is
[1:40:39] a helper to the messenger that God has
[1:40:42] sent in this day and age. You believe
[1:40:44] that? Amen. We're not to preach our own
[1:40:46] message. We're called to preach. We're
[1:40:48] helpers.
[1:40:50] I think a lot of ministers forget that.
[1:40:53] Yes. But brother Bram said God kept
[1:40:56] raising up not only the messengers to
[1:40:58] each age, but he raised up some
[1:41:00] wonderful helpers for those messengers.
[1:41:03] He gave every aid some wonderful men of
[1:41:06] God and they did everything they could
[1:41:08] to bring the church back to God. So they
[1:41:11] were working under the messenger. They
[1:41:13] were helpers to that messenger. They
[1:41:15] weren't tearing down that messenger.
[1:41:18] They weren't tearing down his
[1:41:21] message. And I believe the ministers
[1:41:23] that are coming to our our our meetings
[1:41:26] and the ministers are even in here. I I
[1:41:28] thank God. I salute my own father. Amen.
[1:41:32] as the minister of the gospel that that
[1:41:35] would not try to build himself but would
[1:41:39] humble himself to come under and just
[1:41:42] preach what a prophet preached.
[1:41:46] That's right. Can you say amen?
[1:41:49] We know Ephesians 4:11 and I'm not going
[1:41:52] to read it, but Paul talked about it. He
[1:41:54] gave some God gave some apostles,
[1:41:57] prophets, teachers, evangelists,
[1:41:59] pastors, teachers, all these things for
[1:42:02] the perfecting of the saints and that
[1:42:04] we'd not be henceforth tossed to and fro
[1:42:08] and and all of these things. Well, what
[1:42:10] is it? They're helpers.
[1:42:12] They're helpers. They got something to
[1:42:14] preach. God sent a message and then God
[1:42:17] sent the five-fold ministry to come
[1:42:19] under that. They subject their ministry.
[1:42:22] They subject their inspiration under
[1:42:26] this headship of the message.
[1:42:29] Can you say amen?
[1:42:31] Amen. And
[1:42:34] and the main agenda that should be and
[1:42:37] will be is God's church. That's the main
[1:42:40] agenda. God's church. Every time the
[1:42:42] minister, a God- sent minister gets up,
[1:42:44] it's for God's church.
[1:42:47] God's church. Can you say amen? That's
[1:42:49] why we put effort into what we study and
[1:42:52] how we preach and we're careful what we
[1:42:54] say and all of these things. We're
[1:42:56] careful how we live. We try everything.
[1:42:58] It's God's church that we're after.
[1:43:02] Can you say amen? I ain't here for
[1:43:03] myself. I'm here for the church. I'm
[1:43:05] here for the people.
[1:43:08] Brother Brham said, "What's the most
[1:43:10] important thing in the world?" It's
[1:43:11] God's church. Somebody say, "God's
[1:43:13] church." God made the earth. He made it
[1:43:16] for a purpose to take a church out of
[1:43:18] it. the bride and that's the most
[1:43:20] important job in the world.
[1:43:24] Brother Brandham had a responsibility as
[1:43:26] you know he had a responsibility. God
[1:43:28] showed it to him. He had the same
[1:43:31] responsibility that Eleazar had. And
[1:43:34] Eleazar had that responsibility. He was
[1:43:37] sent to go get a bride for Isaac. Ain't
[1:43:38] that
[1:43:39] right? And
[1:43:41] and when the Bible opened up and there
[1:43:45] it was. It fell upon Eleazar getting a
[1:43:48] bride for Isaac. And brother Brandham
[1:43:50] said, "That's right with my
[1:43:53] ministry." Can you say amen? Get a
[1:43:57] bride. He Eleazar went right straight
[1:44:00] out and began praying and he met the
[1:44:02] beautiful Rebecca that become the bride
[1:44:05] of Isaac. Just a perfect message back to
[1:44:08] the word. Go get that bride. That's a
[1:44:10] duty. He said, "That's what I'm here
[1:44:12] for. That's what I'm trying to do is
[1:44:14] call out a bride. Well, aren't you glad
[1:44:17] for that? See, and notice we're here
[1:44:21] preaching the same message that Brother
[1:44:24] Brown preached for the same purpose.
[1:44:29] Can you say amen? We could have a tent
[1:44:32] meeting and just have it all emotion and
[1:44:34] excitement
[1:44:36] and have pizza give
[1:44:39] way. Just a gathering.
[1:44:42] But we realize we got a purpose.
[1:44:47] Get a bride.
[1:44:49] Can you say amen? This is why this
[1:44:51] message must be preached. This is why
[1:44:53] we're not ashamed of what a prophet
[1:44:55] said.
[1:44:56] It's why we don't want to water it down
[1:44:58] cuz the message is going to get a bride.
[1:45:02] Get her ready for the rapture. Can you
[1:45:04] say amen? That preachers aren't only the
[1:45:07] only ones that are called to be God's
[1:45:09] helpers. Often times, you know, we get
[1:45:12] the idea that it's just
[1:45:14] preachers and preachers this and but
[1:45:18] that's not true. We all have something
[1:45:19] to do. Yeah. Preaching the gospel is is
[1:45:22] the most important thing there is, but
[1:45:24] God has provided people to help the
[1:45:27] ministry. And and and you can read that
[1:45:29] in 1 Corinthians 12-22 or just the 12th
[1:45:33] chapter. Paul says there's the body is
[1:45:36] one and there's many members that God
[1:45:38] has set in the body, right? And every bo
[1:45:40] every member has a function, but it's
[1:45:42] all in the body. It's to make that body
[1:45:44] work. It's to make the body tick. It's
[1:45:46] to make the body function just right.
[1:45:48] Ain't that right? Amen. From the head to
[1:45:51] the toe to the to the brain to the liver
[1:45:54] to to whatever parts that doesn't even
[1:45:57] seem Amen. necessary. But if God put it
[1:46:00] in that body, it's necessary,
[1:46:04] right?
[1:46:06] So, so we look at all these things and
[1:46:08] brother Bram says I'm not the body of
[1:46:10] Christ. I'm only a member of it.
[1:46:16] So, if the ear would say because I'm not
[1:46:18] of the eye, then I ain't got no use. Or
[1:46:21] if the ear would say, well, because I'm
[1:46:23] not the hand, or the hand say, well, I'm
[1:46:25] not the foot and yada yada yada, you
[1:46:27] know, and and uh then you know we I have
[1:46:32] no use. Well, that that's not true
[1:46:34] because God has set the members, every
[1:46:38] one of them in the body as it has
[1:46:40] pleased him. Can you say amen? So, what
[1:46:44] it does tell us, it takes team effort to
[1:46:47] achieve what God is
[1:46:49] wanting us to achieve for him. Can you
[1:46:53] say amen? Brother Brandham uses the game
[1:46:56] of football for the example. He said,
[1:46:59] "When you're playing a ball game, it's
[1:47:02] football season. The thing we want to do
[1:47:04] is not everybody try to take the ball
[1:47:06] from the man that's got it. He's trying
[1:47:09] to guard that man. Protect him. Let him
[1:47:11] get through. We're trying to make a
[1:47:13] goal." Can you say amen? How many
[1:47:15] believes we're trying to make a goal?
[1:47:17] We're trying to make a goal. Well, most
[1:47:19] of us anyways. We're trying to make a
[1:47:21] goal. But he says, "Could you imagine a
[1:47:24] team so untrained as to find one man,
[1:47:26] their own man, with the ball running to
[1:47:29] the field goal, and then instead of
[1:47:31] trying to knock the enemy away from him,
[1:47:33] the opposing team, to let your own man
[1:47:35] that's got the ball take off with it,
[1:47:38] every man trying to take the ball out of
[1:47:39] his hands." He said, "Well, you're bound
[1:47:41] to lose, right?" And today, we have the
[1:47:44] same thing. When we see God come on the
[1:47:46] scene and going to bless a certain
[1:47:48] thing, let's keep all the enemies away
[1:47:51] from it. Let's use our influences as
[1:47:53] tackles, not runners. Tackles that
[1:47:56] protects the runner. Let's let's let let
[1:47:59] him pack the ball through. See? And
[1:48:02] because there's no opposition, see, all
[1:48:05] he has to do is just keep running. Can
[1:48:07] you say amen? Amen. See why? Because
[1:48:10] we're in our place and and we're
[1:48:12] protecting. We're uh uh uh we see the
[1:48:15] objective here that if he gets the ball
[1:48:17] and he runs and he makes it, then we all
[1:48:20] win. Amen. We all achieved the work.
[1:48:23] We've all worked at it. And all of our
[1:48:26] work is not in vain. Every labor is not
[1:48:30] in vain because I done my part. You done
[1:48:32] your part. The preacher done their part.
[1:48:34] And I I say to you, the preachers are
[1:48:36] coming. And I know they're praying. I
[1:48:39] know they're studying. I know these
[1:48:40] things are coming. But they can't do it
[1:48:43] without us.
[1:48:45] Amen. Yes. That's right.
[1:48:48] the man that's got the ball, don't take
[1:48:50] it out of his hands. He says, try to
[1:48:53] guard him. Can you say
[1:48:55] amen? And so I again, we have some of
[1:48:59] the greatest ministers in the message
[1:49:02] coming
[1:49:03] and I say that because they preach the
[1:49:06] message. They're called called men,
[1:49:09] anointed of God. They don't waste time
[1:49:11] with frivolous things.
[1:49:15] And and as I get ready to wind down now,
[1:49:19] preaching the gospel is going to be the
[1:49:22] most important thing in the meeting.
[1:49:25] It's the most important thing than food.
[1:49:27] It's the most important thing than
[1:49:31] uh whatever we're
[1:49:34] doing. It's the greatest
[1:49:37] thing, but they can't do it all. They
[1:49:41] need us. Somebody say, "They need me.
[1:49:45] Just as Moses needed
[1:49:48] helpers and God sent a prophet in this
[1:49:51] day and we needed him and his message,
[1:49:54] but he couldn't have done what he did
[1:49:56] without
[1:49:57] helpers, making preparation for his
[1:50:00] arrival. He had a secretary that was
[1:50:03] doing work. He had
[1:50:05] um you know, he had uh assistants. He
[1:50:10] had a
[1:50:11] manager and he needed men to arrive
[1:50:15] early to to the service to, you know, to
[1:50:19] hand out uh uh prayer cards. And so, so
[1:50:23] even though the message was important,
[1:50:25] he needed men to to to be out there to
[1:50:29] help that message go. Can you say amen?
[1:50:33] He needed people out there. Brother Ram,
[1:50:35] I was just hearing him say, you know,
[1:50:36] the Lord willing, we're going to go and
[1:50:37] set up a tent a whole
[1:50:40] 15,000. And I thought, oh
[1:50:43] my. And I thought, well, you wouldn't
[1:50:46] have saw Brother Brandham out there by
[1:50:47] himself just, you know, trying to get
[1:50:49] that tent going. No, he had helpers.
[1:50:52] There had to be someone set the tent up.
[1:50:53] There had to be someone set out them
[1:50:55] 15,000 chairs. There had to be someone
[1:50:58] set out the platforms. There had to be
[1:51:00] someone to get the sound going. There
[1:51:02] had to be somebody to get all the music
[1:51:04] together. There had to be somebody so
[1:51:07] that it would prepare for him to preach
[1:51:09] the word. People needed help, right?
[1:51:12] They needed to see God on the scene come
[1:51:15] on the scene. But there had to be
[1:51:17] somebody to have that vision and say,
[1:51:18] "Hold it. Well, I I want to be a part. I
[1:51:21] want to help. I want to be a part of
[1:51:22] this. I I I'm not here to take your
[1:51:25] place, Brother Brandon, but I will. I I
[1:51:27] want to do something to make it easy for
[1:51:29] you that that when you preach,
[1:51:31] everything will be already ready and the
[1:51:33] people can just come, not have to worry
[1:51:34] about a place to sit, not have to worry
[1:51:36] about music, not worried about trying to
[1:51:39] hear you, we'll get all that taken care
[1:51:41] of so that when you preach the gospel,
[1:51:43] may God come and may the fire fall.
[1:51:47] I I think so. You see how it is. Uh uh
[1:51:52] brother Bram talking about Billy
[1:51:54] Paul, how he he'd
[1:51:57] come to do uh the prayer cards and he
[1:52:01] said he's been a great help to me along
[1:52:03] in the meeting cuz I've trusted him.
[1:52:05] Take him out there and give him a
[1:52:08] responsible
[1:52:09] job. He said to see the prayer card job
[1:52:12] is a real responsible job. And so really
[1:52:15] Bram said he's been a help to me. really
[1:52:18] needed
[1:52:19] ushers, right? Amen. He needed He needed
[1:52:22] ushers. He needed people that were
[1:52:24] faithful to that. He needed people that
[1:52:26] didn't say, "Well, I'd rather I'd rather
[1:52:29] I'd rather be sitting up on the
[1:52:30] platform. I' I'd rather be over here
[1:52:32] being the musician." No, someone had to
[1:52:34] be the usher. See, and and so he
[1:52:37] depended he depended upon the prayers of
[1:52:40] the people. So, so see you had people
[1:52:43] there were people laying the groundwork
[1:52:46] of the meeting and and people working in
[1:52:49] the meeting and they were helpers.
[1:52:51] Brother Bram said, "See, I well, here it
[1:52:54] is." He goes, "I trust that by God's
[1:52:56] help next April, I believe." Brother
[1:52:58] Bigby told me that he would like for me
[1:53:00] to return back and having full
[1:53:02] cooperation and fellowship with all the
[1:53:04] other churches all be together. That's
[1:53:06] cooperation. We'd like to bring the tent
[1:53:09] big tent sitting some 15,000 set it out
[1:53:12] here for about four or two weeks uh four
[1:53:15] to four to 6 weeks so we could uh teach.
[1:53:18] Can you say amen? See so so but the the
[1:53:21] preparation in one meeting brother
[1:53:23] Brandham thanked a brother for his help
[1:53:25] saying what a wonderful help he has been
[1:53:27] setting the meeting up has never did it
[1:53:30] before and and he's never seen a meeting
[1:53:32] like this before. He's done a really
[1:53:34] good job. See, another time he he says,
[1:53:38] "Thank you, my kind beloved brethren,
[1:53:40] all of you that's cooperated uh to help
[1:53:43] us in the meeting." Uh uh when at
[1:53:46] brother Joseph Boseay's meeting, Brother
[1:53:49] Brandham said, "We are certainly happy
[1:53:51] to be with brother Joseph Boseay again
[1:53:54] and with his staff and workers and with
[1:53:56] all of you see our friends around in
[1:53:59] Chicago in the vicinity. May the Lord
[1:54:01] richly bless you is my prayer." So he's
[1:54:04] acknowledging that it wasn't just him.
[1:54:06] There were people that was part of this
[1:54:09] meeting. We're just hearing the tapes.
[1:54:12] Yeah. We're just hearing him preach on
[1:54:14] the tapes, but there had to be a tape
[1:54:16] guy. There had to be someone going to
[1:54:18] buy the tapes. There had to be someone
[1:54:20] where brother Ram didn't have to worry
[1:54:21] about all these things. You understand
[1:54:23] what I'm saying?
[1:54:25] So, you know, uh
[1:54:28] um one last
[1:54:30] thing I want to say
[1:54:34] is I've seen that when
[1:54:37] God calls someone to labor in the
[1:54:41] kingdom is is that they're not just only
[1:54:45] willing to work, but they expend
[1:54:48] themselves. They're they're they they
[1:54:51] gladly expend themselves. And I look at
[1:54:54] preachers and
[1:54:56] I not only do I love the way they preach
[1:55:00] and things, but I
[1:55:02] love I I draw strength
[1:55:05] and is when I see them expending
[1:55:10] themselves.
[1:55:12] God- called preachers, they preach when
[1:55:14] they're
[1:55:15] sick, when they're in
[1:55:18] pain, when they are
[1:55:21] discouraged, when when their their maybe
[1:55:24] their home is falling
[1:55:26] apart, when they're going through the
[1:55:28] worst storms of their life.
[1:55:31] Brother Donnie Reagan to see him preach
[1:55:34] right after he lost his
[1:55:36] daughter and to keep carrying on. I
[1:55:40] thought God bless that man for doing
[1:55:44] such. Brother Andrew Glover stood here
[1:55:48] preaching a week or so ago with an
[1:55:52] earachche, hurting bad, but he gave it
[1:55:56] everything he had to preach the gospel
[1:55:58] for us.
[1:56:00] I've seen dad preach while fighting this
[1:56:03] Parkinson's, shaking and barely able to
[1:56:07] talk and have to be carried from the
[1:56:10] platform, but it's in his heart to
[1:56:13] preach the gospel and he'd still be
[1:56:16] preaching. If his voice could do it, you
[1:56:19] get him aside by yourself where you can
[1:56:21] hear him, he'd still he'll preach to
[1:56:23] you. It's because it's something within
[1:56:26] him. I've seen brother Josh Bennett
[1:56:28] preach while having pain with kidney
[1:56:31] stones. And there he is about doubled
[1:56:34] over. But he gets to a pulpit and begins
[1:56:36] to preach to his church the unrichable
[1:56:40] unsearchable riches of Christ because
[1:56:44] they expend themselves to the people.
[1:56:46] I've seen brother Jonathan preach uh and
[1:56:50] and his throat is so swollen and and can
[1:56:53] barely talk, but he's going to give it
[1:56:55] all that he's got. I've seen brother
[1:56:58] Wendle get up and preach and just after
[1:57:00] throwing up in the office and vomiting
[1:57:03] from sickness and he's just so sick, but
[1:57:06] get behind that pulpit trusting God to
[1:57:08] help him through it and and God does it.
[1:57:11] seen brother Ron Spencer preaching with
[1:57:14] this cancer there vomiting and about to
[1:57:17] pass out and all that but getting behind
[1:57:20] the pulpit even having seizures while
[1:57:23] behind the pulpit but but he's not doing
[1:57:26] it to be a show off there's something in
[1:57:29] him he's
[1:57:31] expending he's spending himself for the
[1:57:33] people can you say amen there ain't no
[1:57:37] excuses in a preacher there's just
[1:57:39] nothing just God giving God gave it to
[1:57:42] us and they do it willfully. Ain't that
[1:57:44] right? No complaining with them. They
[1:57:47] just they just do it believing that God
[1:57:50] is going to help somebody through their
[1:57:53] ministry. They may not be able to do it
[1:57:55] good. They may not be able to do it
[1:57:56] right. They may not. But who cares? They
[1:57:59] just know God. Amen. And they love the
[1:58:02] people.
[1:58:05] Laboring for the kingdom. Brother
[1:58:08] Brandham expended himself night after
[1:58:11] night. It marvels me. I mean
[1:58:15] the I love his preaching. I love the way
[1:58:18] he preached. But then you just hear him
[1:58:20] talking and what he had to go through to
[1:58:22] get there. Brother Bram talking. Good
[1:58:26] evening friends. I'm happy to be here
[1:58:28] again tonight in the name of our Lord.
[1:58:31] Hearing that wonderful message just kind
[1:58:32] of inspired my heart. Little tired. We
[1:58:35] drove all night last night and all day
[1:58:38] today and just got back a while ago and
[1:58:40] I rushed right and went
[1:58:42] over. Didn't even know what he had to go
[1:58:45] through. But he's there at a pulpit. He
[1:58:47] could have said, "Man, I'm so tired. I
[1:58:49] can't do it tonight." You understand?
[1:58:51] Then we just say, "Oh, yes, brother
[1:58:52] Brandham. We" But he just couldn't do
[1:58:56] it. Another place, Brother Brandham
[1:58:58] said, "I'm tired and very much worn. We
[1:59:01] just come out of a great healing service
[1:59:03] just a matter of a little while ago,
[1:59:05] horsearo and tired. And I said to
[1:59:07] brother Hutchkins, I said, "Should I
[1:59:10] tonight just preach and go ahead?" I
[1:59:13] said, "I've got to drive all night
[1:59:15] tonight in order to meet another
[1:59:17] appointment tomorrow right after dinner
[1:59:19] at Louisville, Kentucky, driving through
[1:59:21] the turnpikes and so forth tonight." And
[1:59:24] he said, "Oh, I I believe the people
[1:59:26] would be a little disappointed if you
[1:59:28] didn't pray for them." I said, 'Well,
[1:59:31] I'll just speak to them a little while
[1:59:32] and pray. And then I sent my boy in and
[1:59:37] told him to give him to give some cards
[1:59:39] if there was many here to be prayed for
[1:59:41] so we can get the people lined up. So,
[1:59:43] we'll try to do that. Here he's tired.
[1:59:46] Here he's weary. Here he's got a whole
[1:59:48] night of driving. He's got an
[1:59:50] appointment, but for the people's sake,
[1:59:54] he spent himself for the people. Can you
[1:59:58] say amen? Another place. Thank you,
[2:00:01] brother Joseph. Good to be here this
[2:00:03] morning. And fellowship is something
[2:00:05] that's hard to explain, isn't it? I told
[2:00:07] my wife, I'm getting old. Joseph called
[2:00:10] me the other day and we're talking. I
[2:00:12] said, "Say, Joseph, I'm just outside the
[2:00:14] city Sunday morning. I'll be over and
[2:00:17] see you." Oh, he said that nothing would
[2:00:20] please us any better. I thought, well, I
[2:00:23] thought I was at Gary and I was 125
[2:00:26] miles at South Bend. I drove through a
[2:00:29] blinding snowstorm this morning after a
[2:00:32] meeting last night over there in
[2:00:34] dedication of a church and a good
[2:00:37] friend, Brother Tom's from Canada. And
[2:00:39] we drove this morning zigzagging over
[2:00:42] the roads over here in a blinding storm
[2:00:44] to keep our promise to brother Joseph.
[2:00:49] expending. Can you say amen? But it's
[2:00:52] not just preachers that expend
[2:00:53] themselves. It's anyone who is called to
[2:00:56] labor for this kingdom. Jesus said, "He
[2:00:59] that is greatest of all is the servant
[2:01:01] to
[2:01:02] all." Amen. Brother Brham said, "All the
[2:01:06] truly great men of history have been
[2:01:08] servants. They who demanded to be
[2:01:10] served, they who oppressed, they who
[2:01:13] sought to always be at the head have
[2:01:16] gone down in shame. Even the very rich
[2:01:19] are condemned by God when they have not
[2:01:21] used their wealth right. But he says tr
[2:01:24] history tells us that the men who were
[2:01:27] truly great were the ones who served
[2:01:30] others. It will forever praise those who
[2:01:33] did much for
[2:01:35] others. Then he begins to talk of Jesus
[2:01:38] how that Jesus bowed himself over the
[2:01:40] disciples feet to wash them. Old dirty
[2:01:43] stinking feet. And yet the Lord of glory
[2:01:47] bowed himself over their feet and began
[2:01:49] to clean
[2:01:51] them. And then Jesus said, "You don't
[2:01:54] know now what I'm doing, but you will
[2:01:57] know hereafter, but what you see me
[2:01:59] doing, you ought also to do." Can you
[2:02:03] say amen? Yet the musicians will come.
[2:02:08] Brother Abraham said he became a servant
[2:02:10] in order that God could elevate him to
[2:02:12] the highest
[2:02:14] heights. And one day in the judgment of
[2:02:16] the saints, we are going to hear him
[2:02:18] say, "Well done, good and faithful
[2:02:21] servant. Enter thou into the joy of the
[2:02:24] Lord." It is hard to be always a
[2:02:27] servant, but those who spend and are
[2:02:30] spent for others will one day be seated
[2:02:32] with him in his throne, and it will be
[2:02:36] worth it all then.
[2:02:38] So let us labor for the master from the
[2:02:40] dawn till the setting sun. Let us talk
[2:02:43] of all his wondrous love and care. And
[2:02:47] when all of life is over and our work on
[2:02:49] earth is done and the role is called up
[2:02:52] yonder, I'll be
[2:02:54] there. How am I going to be there? Amen.
[2:03:01] Another place he says here, he says,
[2:03:03] "When it's all over someday, and if I
[2:03:06] don't get to eat breakfast with you
[2:03:07] again, when it's all over, we're sitting
[2:03:10] across the table from one another.
[2:03:12] That's the time I'm looking for." He
[2:03:15] said, "No doubt, but little tears will
[2:03:17] run down our cheeks and look across the
[2:03:20] table and get to each other by the hand.
[2:03:23] It'll mean something then. Let's work
[2:03:27] while it's time to work while the sun is
[2:03:30] up. It'll be down after a while. It's
[2:03:33] getting very low now. Then to think that
[2:03:37] while we're sitting there holding each
[2:03:38] other's hands and weeping a little, then
[2:03:40] the great king will come out in all of
[2:03:43] his great robes come down along the line
[2:03:46] and wipe all tears away from our eyes

[2:06:59] little man is having some
[2:07:05] issues and
[2:07:08] um he's not gaining weight, right? not
[2:07:12] gaining weight and he's not able to
[2:07:15] digest the
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:17] food and
[2:07:19] um so their doctor is wanting them to go
[2:07:23] to
[2:07:25] UVA and um get things checked out to see
[2:07:30] what's going on.
[2:07:33] Um they said a baby that's had had birth
[2:07:38] and all that the way he's had it and
[2:07:40] everything should be so further along
[2:07:43] than where he's at. And uh but I tell
[2:07:47] you what, I believe in a mighty
[2:07:51] God that can touch this
[2:07:54] child and make this baby whole.
[2:07:58] and and I know you mothers can
[2:08:02] sympathize with uh Sister Bethany and
[2:08:05] brother Shamaya and you parents. I just
[2:08:09] wonder if maybe we could just stand to
[2:08:11] our
[2:08:13] feet and just from your heart have
[2:08:16] compassion on this child and pray to God
[2:08:20] in your own way. Amen. as we going to
[2:08:23] anoint
[2:08:24] him with
[2:08:27] oil and just believing God to work
[2:08:32] uh
[2:08:34] supernaturally. Amen. Amen.
[2:08:38] Amen. Precious
[2:08:42] father. Oh father, you're the creator of
[2:08:46] life.
[2:08:48] You've seen to it that this child would
[2:08:51] be born in this age and given to these
[2:08:56] parents. Father, we're so appreciative
[2:08:59] of of you, Lord,
[2:09:02] and how your
[2:09:04] heart has been to them to give them a
[2:09:08] precious gift.
[2:09:11] We know that
[2:09:13] children are dear to you,
[2:09:16] Father. And Satan now attacking this
[2:09:19] child at such an early age, so
[2:09:22] innocent. Satan, no respector of
[2:09:26] age. But Father, we're asking that you
[2:09:29] would just step in even now and touch
[2:09:31] this child and drive that spirit away
[2:09:34] from this body.
[2:09:36] May this stomach in the name of Jesus
[2:09:39] Christ start
[2:09:41] functioning. May the gastronomics and
[2:09:44] whatever is wrong, may it come in line
[2:09:47] to your word. Father, may your healing
[2:09:51] touch come even now. May the healing
[2:09:54] angels sweep by and touch this child.
[2:10:00] Oh father, we thank you for
[2:10:03] it and we believe it to be done. We
[2:10:06] believe you to answer the prayer as you
[2:10:09] have so many other
[2:10:11] prayers in Jesus Christ's name we
[2:10:16] pray. Amen and
[2:10:19] amen. We thank you Lord for it.
[2:10:22] Hallelujah.
[2:10:24] Hallelujah. Amen. And we just believe
[2:10:27] for a a complete
[2:10:29] miracle, amen, for this baby. Amen. That
[2:10:33] God will just touch him. Believe he is
[2:10:38] touched. Amen. And as brother Brandham
[2:10:40] said many times, just go praise the Lord
[2:10:43] for it. Just praise the Lord for it.
[2:10:47] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:10:50] Hallelujah. Oh my. Let's sing this song.
