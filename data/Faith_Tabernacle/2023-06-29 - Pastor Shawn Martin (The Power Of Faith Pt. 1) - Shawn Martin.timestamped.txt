[38:50] and Jesus answered and said unto it no
[38:53] man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever
[38:56] and his disciples heard it
[38:59] then the 19th verse says and when even
[39:01] was come he went out of the city and in
[39:04] the morning as they passed by they saw
[39:08] the fig tree dried up from the roots and
[39:11] Peter calling to remember and saith unto
[39:13] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[39:15] thou cursed is withered away
[39:18] and Jesus answering saith unto them have
[39:21] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[39:24] that whosoever shall say unto this
[39:26] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[39:28] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[39:31] his heart but shall believe that those
[39:33] things which he saith shall come to pass
[39:35] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[39:39] therefore I say unto you what things so
[39:41] ever you desire When you pray believe
[39:44] that you receive them and you shall have
[39:48] them what a promise amen
[39:50] let's just bow our heads and talk to our
[39:53] Lord father
[39:55] truly you're moving among the Earth
[40:00] we see that sin is is spreading rapidly
[40:03] and in the world is getting so evil
[40:08] father and you you predicted it would
[40:10] happen it would be this way
[40:13] but Lord we also are a people that
[40:17] that see your hand
[40:20] and you're Supernatural
[40:23] being is present with us
[40:26] father we're so glad for that Lord and
[40:28] this is why we could come together
[40:30] tonight
[40:31] Lord on a Wednesday night under great
[40:34] expectation that you'll be here with us
[40:36] father you promise where two or three
[40:39] are gathered in your name you would be
[40:40] here
[40:41] and Lord we're just now asking that you
[40:44] would have the preeminence in this part
[40:45] of the service anoint Lord the gift that
[40:49] you placed within me help me to get
[40:51] myself out of the way and anoint the
[40:54] people their hearts their ears to hear
[40:57] and receive we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[41:00] name amen
[41:02] you can have your seats this evening
[41:06] and last Wednesday
[41:09] we preached on the subject the power of
[41:13] faith and I
[41:15] I want to continue with that subject
[41:19] and as I stated last Wednesday and we
[41:23] all know it but God God has meant for
[41:28] his people to be a people of authority
[41:32] and uh people of power
[41:35] and
[41:36] um just to look back and and go
[41:41] reminisce of things but in the beginning
[41:45] a man was made to be a god brother Brahm
[41:49] said he's absolutely a god
[41:52] and because he was made in the image of
[41:55] God
[41:55] and we can find that in Genesis he is a
[41:59] Son of God and if he's a Son of God then
[42:02] he's heir to all things
[42:05] uh heir of all that God is and so man
[42:10] was given a domain and that domain was
[42:13] the Earth
[42:15] and God gave him power over the fish the
[42:17] fowl of the air he gave him power over
[42:20] all things of all creation and and he
[42:25] could just speak and everything would
[42:27] obey him what a what a position to be in
[42:30] what a power to be to have and and so
[42:35] God is God Of Heaven and Earth he's God
[42:38] of the universe but Adam he was the
[42:43] ruler in his domain
[42:45] and brother Branham called him a king
[42:48] ruler man was King ruler and so even
[42:52] though uh man has fallen yet he still
[42:56] has that appearance he's still there's
[42:59] something about him and and brother
[43:02] Branham talks about how that uh uh man
[43:06] has light and and of course science has
[43:09] discovered this uh and that's how
[43:11] they're able to do the x-rays and that
[43:14] brother Brown said that we were born
[43:15] with four lights
[43:17] a rays of light
[43:20] and it's in our body and and when we
[43:23] reach he says the age of 20 to 25 then
[43:27] one of those Rays
[43:29] go out and then when we reach 35 or 40
[43:34] or so another ray goes out and and when
[43:38] we get you know uh past 65 well he said
[43:42] we're we're living on our last ray of
[43:44] light
[43:45] uh there and and so uh he he says every
[43:50] time you take an x-ray picture uh you're
[43:53] tearing down them rays that are in your
[43:57] body and he said that's the reason you
[43:59] don't have no more you stick these kids
[44:01] feet in the machines and because it was
[44:05] just tearing the Rays right out of their
[44:07] little body and and so he he goes on and
[44:11] he talks of how that we are full of
[44:13] light cells and which is Cosmic light
[44:17] and and uh and that's what we have as a
[44:21] human being but then the Bible says that
[44:24] God is light and he's a Different Light
[44:28] than Cosmic light it's a it's a
[44:31] different thing and and so and this is
[44:33] what puts us in connection uh here it
[44:36] calls brother Branham says when we're
[44:38] walking in light of God in in in God's
[44:42] light he says see uh as sons of God now
[44:46] you can't just walk in the light of God
[44:48] and not walk as sons of God Amen so when
[44:53] when that light said God comes inside of
[44:56] us it's not a cosmic light then it's
[44:59] it's a different light that that is God
[45:02] and we are sons of God and so he says
[45:06] see God is Not Cosmic light but God's
[45:09] light operated through the cosmic light
[45:13] of our bodies ourselves see he said
[45:16] we're absolutely we were absolutely at
[45:20] one time real genuine sons of God you
[45:24] believe that we were absolutely at one
[45:28] time real genuine sons of God Amen but
[45:33] see sin has had an effect upon uh uh the
[45:37] human uh kind and and upon man to where
[45:40] he's nothing today like God made him to
[45:44] be and and and so brother Branham
[45:47] describes it it's like a seaweed you get
[45:49] in the bottom of a seed a lot of times
[45:52] divers this is they'll get under the the
[45:54] seaweed and before they know it they're
[45:56] wrapped in such a way they can't get out
[45:59] of it well that's what sin has done to
[46:03] the human being that's what communism
[46:05] has done to the Nations that's what
[46:07] that's that's what coldness has done to
[46:10] the church see it's it's intertwined sin
[46:14] has intertwined and a man to where he
[46:18] can't get out of it and and and so uh
[46:22] brother Brown says and then in the human
[46:25] body see it wrapped us he says and it's
[46:28] pushing out this light of God see by
[46:32] denominations and denying faith and so
[46:35] forth uh so forth It's pushed out all
[46:38] the Rays of God's great power of Faith
[46:41] that's in us that should be ain't that
[46:44] right amen see we weren't made to be uh
[46:48] the way we were born in sin and shaping
[46:51] a nickel we weren't made to uh to wallow
[46:55] in sin we we were made to have God's
[46:58] rays of light shine through us a man see
[47:02] and so but but he said see but but
[47:05] slowly uh since the beginning of time
[47:09] it's it's been in uh entwined man and
[47:12] and make it him powerless and and
[47:15] hopeless and and all of these things and
[47:18] he says see they pushed out all those
[47:20] the the Rays in such a place till all
[47:24] we've got is just the lodge and Satan no
[47:27] power of God moving no Supernatural
[47:30] moving no presence of God in the place
[47:33] anymore they're uh uh you talk about the
[47:36] fruits of the spirit it's it's gone from
[47:38] the church you're talking about the
[47:40] attributes of God it's gone from the
[47:43] church to where it's just a lodge amen
[47:46] and he says see now then below the lodge
[47:48] the church is because it's just pushed
[47:51] all all Darkness out and even and and
[47:54] even saying it doesn't happen see
[47:56] denying that it could happen the
[47:58] miracles of god they don't believe that
[48:00] the miracles of god can happen they
[48:02] don't believe uh uh so we set up the
[48:04] psychology we set up uh uh marriage
[48:07] programs we set up the AAA and we set up
[48:10] all these programs of human trying to
[48:14] help human and and look at the mess
[48:16] we've gotten in uh we we've exalted
[48:19] politics so high and every man is
[48:21] disappointed by it amen and and and then
[48:25] we've we we've exalted the the the the
[48:27] sports and we've elevated that them up
[48:30] and and all that made Gods out of him
[48:33] and all that but when it comes to God
[48:35] himself being God then who he is we
[48:38] don't believe in any of that the
[48:39] churches don't believe that see and and
[48:42] and so and and how far different that
[48:44] was from from Adam when he walked the
[48:48] Earth and and so so brother Brown says
[48:51] man has something weighed down inside of
[48:54] him to where if he can only let that
[48:57] light grow and he he talked about that
[49:00] light being like a little old button you
[49:02] know uh he said when a man is saved see
[49:05] he said a little bit of him is is is of
[49:09] God or is God see so when a man repents
[49:12] and he gets the Holy Ghost and he well a
[49:16] little bit of that of of of man is God
[49:19] see now God come inside of him he said
[49:22] that's the little light that comes in to
[49:24] make him quit doing things that are
[49:26] wrong see and and so he says if that man
[49:30] can take all the malice and envy and
[49:33] strife and unbelief out well that little
[49:36] button-like of the light and power of
[49:39] God will keep growing and growing and
[49:42] growing and growing see you it will
[49:45] crowd out all the unbelief ain't that
[49:49] right and this is why we we come to
[49:51] church that's why it's important to come
[49:53] to church that's why it's important to
[49:55] get into the the things of God why we
[49:58] want to get all of that unbelief all
[50:01] that stuff out and if you've got the
[50:03] Holy Ghost you've got the power to do it
[50:06] amen if you've got the Holy Ghost
[50:08] there's something in there that wants to
[50:10] grow and grow and you let that grow then
[50:13] it'll push out everything else that is
[50:15] not like God ain't that right and he
[50:17] says now you don't do that you don't
[50:19] crowd out this unbelief and growing the
[50:21] light growing and all that you don't do
[50:23] it by exhortations of bodily exercise he
[50:27] said you do it by a Sanctified
[50:30] consecrated life that the holy spirit
[50:33] moves through you ain't that right so we
[50:36] need the Holy Spirit to move through us
[50:38] uh uh mightier than ever before amen
[50:42] that's right see let that Holy Spirit
[50:44] grow that light and and so now having
[50:48] said that I believe that God has never
[50:50] intended for us to be victims amen a
[50:54] victim I I looked up that word victim
[50:57] it's someone or something that has been
[50:59] hurt damaged or killed or has suffered
[51:03] either because of the actions of someone
[51:05] or something else or because of illness
[51:07] or a chance uh these things so that's
[51:10] that's a victim uh uh to where you know
[51:14] you get hurt and and you get wounded
[51:16] you're damaged and suffered and and all
[51:19] of these things well I I now all of us
[51:22] right now we can all say we have been a
[51:24] target of the devil amen ever since our
[51:27] birth we've been a Target whether it's
[51:29] been in the physical whether it's been
[51:30] in the spiritual uh uh mental or
[51:33] whatever there we've been targeted see
[51:36] but when God saved us when God saved us
[51:40] he delivered us out of the hands of the
[51:43] enemy do you believe that how many been
[51:45] delivered from the hand of the enemy
[51:47] amen see he delivered us from the hand
[51:50] of the enemy to where Satan can't touch
[51:52] us again now he can touch us physically
[51:55] if God allows him to uh to where you
[51:59] know he can he can we suffer pain or
[52:01] whatever but I'm going to just talk
[52:03] about that that that emotionally I'm
[52:05] talking about spiritually I'm talking
[52:07] about that that inward man a man to
[52:10] where Satan can't touch us again you see
[52:13] God doesn't want us to live the
[52:15] Christian Life dwelling on our hurts can
[52:19] you say Amen
[52:20] and and I find more and more and more
[52:23] people talking about hurts and and and
[52:26] and and and they thrive on that and and
[52:28] when I say they thrive on that it's it's
[52:31] almost like an excuse not to go anymore
[52:33] with God they use that as an excuse to
[52:36] not to believe in Ministry anymore they
[52:37] use it as an excuse a man to not go to
[52:40] church anymore they use it as a as an
[52:43] excuse Amen to we're not not to involve
[52:46] themselves in the in the church anymore
[52:47] they they use it as an excuse not to put
[52:50] their all into the things of God anymore
[52:52] and and it will hurt I used to I've been
[52:55] hurt I've been this and I've been
[52:57] stomped on I've been all of these things
[52:59] well you know uh uh that's not even
[53:02] living the Christian life amen when
[53:05] we're dwelling on hurts when we're
[53:07] dwelling on our wounds when we're
[53:08] dwelling on in all the negative about
[53:11] life that's not living a Christian Life
[53:15] a man because uh there's positive in
[53:18] Christianity that's all there is brother
[53:20] Brown said there's no negativity in
[53:22] Christianity ain't that right see so
[53:25] we've all been hurt at some point in our
[53:28] lives amen and and and I'm sure we could
[53:31] all raise our hands on that in in some
[53:33] way if if even even before you got saved
[53:37] if you're going to do anything for God
[53:39] you're going to get hurt if you're going
[53:40] to uh you can get hurt by your own in in
[53:44] your marriage you can get hurt by your
[53:45] own family in your in your with your
[53:47] children you you can get hurt by your
[53:50] parents you can get hurt by by anything
[53:52] it's just we're subject to them things
[53:55] ain't that right but see Satan is good
[53:58] at what he does and he tries to bring
[54:01] these things upon us but what he does is
[54:05] not permanent not to a Believer not to a
[54:08] Christian amen his work is not permanent
[54:12] ain't that right amen see I I thought of
[54:15] this acts 10 38 the Bible says God
[54:19] anointed Jesus of Nazareth us with the
[54:21] Holy Ghost and with power who went about
[54:24] doing good and healing all that were
[54:27] oppressed of the devil for God was with
[54:30] him ain't that right so that was the
[54:32] ministry that Jesus had amen we read
[54:35] there in Psalms 107 and 20. he sent his
[54:39] word and healed them ain't that right
[54:42] well that's not just a physical healing
[54:44] that's that's the that's the that's body
[54:47] so in mind and spirit amen that's a
[54:49] healing and and the way he does it he
[54:52] sends his word and healed them and
[54:56] delivered them from their destruction he
[55:00] didn't send a psychologist a man to heal
[55:02] them he didn't send a marriage counselor
[55:04] to heal them he didn't send these all uh
[55:08] uh a philosopher to heal them he sent
[55:11] his word so God sends his word to heal
[55:15] our hurts ain't that right and and there
[55:19] is a lot of hurt people in the mess
[55:20] message a man there's a lot of hurt
[55:23] people but it shouldn't it shouldn't
[55:25] surprise us a bit you know when you go
[55:28] to the hospital and you're seeing the
[55:29] the you you're seeing the the emergency
[55:32] room filled up you're seeing all the
[55:34] rooms that are filled up well it doesn't
[55:36] surprise us amen because that's what a
[55:38] hospital is for it's it's it well you
[55:42] don't go to the hospital when you ain't
[55:43] got nothing wrong it's when you got
[55:45] something wrong that that that you go to
[55:48] the hospital because they're there to
[55:50] take care of you they're there for you
[55:52] to recover they're there Amen to help
[55:55] you amen through the situation ain't
[55:57] that right well uh uh then then it
[56:00] shouldn't surprise us that that within
[56:02] the message ranks there's a lot of hurt
[56:04] people a man see but you see the message
[56:07] is the word of God do you believe it and
[56:10] God I believe is sending his people a
[56:14] man to where the message is so that they
[56:17] can be healed ain't that right amen not
[56:19] just any word is is going to heal them
[56:21] God sent his word to heal them his word
[56:25] that's right see amen so so they may
[56:29] have uh all kinds of hurts and their
[56:32] life is a mess and all that but God
[56:34] sends them a man to his word amen to
[56:38] heal them a man see and the Bible says
[56:42] they overcame him by the blood of the
[56:45] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[56:47] ain't that right they overcame everybody
[56:50] say I'm overcoming amen God called us to
[56:54] overcome amen not to sit and cry a bit
[56:57] and then and whine about it amen but to
[57:00] overcome it amen I I know we've all got
[57:03] a different life we've all got a
[57:04] different past we've all got different
[57:06] things and and I guarantee you every one
[57:08] of us wants to sit down and just say
[57:10] I've had enough of it amen but there's
[57:12] something about the word of God Amen
[57:15] that keeps healing our wounds that that
[57:17] that keeps yeah uh uh helping us to
[57:21] recover from everything can you say Amen
[57:23] you cannot keep a Christian down you
[57:26] can't keep him out you you just can't
[57:28] hold him down the word of God has been
[57:31] sinned Amen to heal him and to deliver
[57:34] them from their destructions
[57:37] amen and so now we find that not
[57:40] everybody receives their healing and
[57:42] it's not God's fault amen uh brother
[57:45] Branham said it's just like a man dying
[57:47] on the doctor's steps and refused to
[57:49] take his medicine he said it ain't the
[57:51] doctor's fault it ain't the medicine's
[57:53] fault it's the man because he won't take
[57:56] the medicine that's the way it is with
[57:58] the church today we've got bomb amen see
[58:01] uh uh we got Physicians we got medicine
[58:04] but Sinners die in their seats in their
[58:06] churches and go to torment because they
[58:09] refuse to take the medicine can you say
[58:12] man well I'm telling you we've got the
[58:14] greatest message on the face of the
[58:16] Earth that that is so powerful it'll
[58:19] change your body it'll change your way
[58:21] of thinking it'll change everything
[58:23] about you but you got to take the
[58:25] medicine ain't that right we got to take
[58:28] it see he said it ain't the doctor's
[58:30] fault it's the man's fault that won't
[58:31] come see that's right but we've got a
[58:34] bomb in Gilead amen we got a bomb church
[58:37] can you say Amen you say well you know
[58:40] how you you may look at your life right
[58:42] now and you may look at the Promises of
[58:44] God and say it seems like I'm so far
[58:46] away from that but I'm telling you we've
[58:49] got a bomb we've got a bomb in Gilead a
[58:52] man that'll help you get to that place
[58:54] Amen to where every promise is alive in
[58:57] you
[58:58] that's right Jesus said if you shall say
[59:01] to this mountain be thou removed and be
[59:03] thou cast and to see it shall be done
[59:04] that's what he said ain't that right
[59:07] well how's that going to be amen I'll
[59:09] tell you we got a bomb in Gilead ain't
[59:11] that right he also said in my name they
[59:13] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[59:15] with new tongues they shall take up
[59:17] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[59:19] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[59:21] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[59:23] recover how's that going to be done
[59:24] because we've got a bomb in Gilead ain't
[59:28] that right he sent his word to heal them
[59:31] of their diseases
[59:33] that's right see now you know all them
[59:36] promises you realize them promises that
[59:38] Jesus just and they were just two of
[59:40] them that we I just read amen you
[59:42] realize he's talking to people that have
[59:44] been hurt stop rejected despised and and
[59:47] and and all of these things and and and
[59:50] people whose lives are all messed up but
[59:53] Jesus said if you just believe you can
[59:55] do them things amen he didn't say well
[59:57] if he was born in a new home a good home
[1:00:00] and if you got money in in your account
[1:00:01] you had no battles you've had no hurts
[1:00:04] you've had he's talking about people
[1:00:05] whose lives have been wrecked and
[1:00:07] miserable that there's a problem in
[1:00:09] Gilead a man that can restore that
[1:00:11] situation Amen to where they can be a
[1:00:14] sons of God

[1:03:14] and and sped upon he suffered the
[1:03:17] embarrassment the shame he endured all
[1:03:19] of them things and yet he says I have

[1:03:53] you're going that you're facing with can
[1:03:55] you say Amen it's a spiritual warfare it
[1:03:58] ain't a carnivore Fair it's not a
[1:04:00] natural Warfare It's a spiritual warfare
[1:04:03] the devil's been after this church the
[1:04:05] devil's been after our home the devil's
[1:04:07] been after your home the devil's been
[1:04:09] after your children amen and what else

[1:04:17] thing there is a doctor can't do it when
[1:04:19] the doctors fail they're still a bomb
[1:04:22] can you say Amen when everything else
[1:04:25] fails there's still a bomb in Gilead
[1:04:30] now he says I've overcome so don't think
[1:04:31] you're going to overcome by yourself
[1:04:34] no sir
[1:04:35] notice brother Bram said see that
[1:04:37] quickening power that come upon Jesus
[1:04:39] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:04:42] of the word for that day
[1:04:44] ain't that right that's how Jesus
[1:04:45] overcome you say well he was God well
[1:04:48] good Lord what in the world are you
[1:04:55] you're really getting it too close well
[1:04:59] if you're sons of God what are you
[1:05:03] ain't that right
[1:05:05] Jesus is flesh and blood just like you
[1:05:09] but he had quickening power
[1:05:12] ain't that right he had all of God in
[1:05:15] him he was God
[1:05:17] but brother Bram talked about that ain't
[1:05:19] that right he talked about that like you
[1:05:21] go in the ocean you ain't gonna drink
[1:05:22] all that ocean and you don't have to
[1:05:24] have all that ocean in you to have the
[1:05:26] the the the the the the qualities or the
[1:05:30] minerals and all of that that's in that
[1:05:32] ocean you can take a a a a Dipper full a
[1:05:35] spoonful and drink it and everything
[1:05:38] that's in that ocean you just partook of
[1:05:40] ain't that right yes sir now God is it
[1:05:43] was he was all God the fullness of
[1:05:46] godhead would dwelt bodily in him but
[1:05:48] I'm going to tell you the fullness of
[1:05:50] the godhead is in his church today and
[1:05:52] if you're part of that church the same
[1:05:54] God that was in him in every quality
[1:05:57] every character every attribute hell
[1:05:59] power that was in him is in you
[1:06:02] you try
[1:06:04] so that quickening power that come upon
[1:06:06] Jesus quickened him to manifest every
[1:06:09] promise of the word of that day
[1:06:12] see and and he couldn't have done what
[1:06:14] he'd done church he could not have done
[1:06:16] what he'd done without the quickening
[1:06:19] power
[1:06:20] do you believe that look Luke Luke 4 18
[1:06:23] the spirit of the Lord this is Jesus
[1:06:25] saying it the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:06:27] me amen aren't you glad he identified it
[1:06:30] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:06:32] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:06:35] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:06:37] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:06:39] Deliverance to the captives and
[1:06:41] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:06:43] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:06:45] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:06:47] amen he couldn't have done any of that
[1:06:49] except the quickening power was in him
[1:06:52] and the spirit of the Lord was upon him
[1:06:57] see that he can fulfill every word that
[1:06:59] was spoken of him to do because he had
[1:07:01] the quickening power
[1:07:03] now notice the prophet said the holy
[1:07:05] spirit is here on Earth looking out
[1:07:08] those individuals that God has ordained
[1:07:10] a life in this age aren't you glad amen
[1:07:13] the ministry of God Amen the holy spirit
[1:07:16] that is up on the Earth today amen not
[1:07:19] just to get you to roll on the floor
[1:07:20] amen not just to get you all happy and
[1:07:23] excited and goosebumps and then you
[1:07:25] don't know what you are and who you are
[1:07:26] and how you are and all these sayings
[1:07:29] see that he's here looking out Those
[1:07:31] whom he has ordained to life amen
[1:07:35] they've been trapped in sin they've been
[1:07:37] wounded they've been hurt amen they've
[1:07:39] been almost elderly destroyed amen but
[1:07:41] God is taking them people and he's
[1:07:44] healing them making them sons and
[1:07:46] daughters again restoring them back into
[1:07:49] the position that they were called to be
[1:07:52] in the first place
[1:07:56] now notice he says now so the holy
[1:07:59] spirit is here on Earth looking out
[1:08:00] those individuals that God has ordained
[1:08:03] to life in this age and as soon as it
[1:08:05] finds it it does just like it did on
[1:08:08] Jesus Christ the great super Son of God
[1:08:10] who redeemed us all it comes down and
[1:08:14] takes its place of Abode into the human
[1:08:16] life and notice it brought the
[1:08:19] quickening power
[1:08:21] amen he found you did he not he found
[1:08:24] you you was on your road to whatever
[1:08:27] maybe he was just raised in church man
[1:08:29] and or maybe he was a drunk or it
[1:08:31] doesn't matter what you are or what you
[1:08:33] were a man it took the Holy Spirit to
[1:08:37] find you if he'd never found me I'd
[1:08:39] still be a church member or a backslid
[1:08:42] out in the world somewhere but he found
[1:08:44] me amen and he found you as well amen
[1:08:48] and brought the quickening power to you
[1:08:52] now notice when that goes brother I'm
[1:08:55] talking about the quickening power when
[1:08:57] it fell upon Luther it manifested the
[1:08:59] promise of that hour when it fell up on
[1:09:02] Wesley it manifested the promise of that
[1:09:04] hour when it falls in this day it
[1:09:06] manifests the promise of this hour when
[1:09:08] a fellow from Moses it manifested the
[1:09:10] promise of that hour it fell upon Noah
[1:09:13] it manifested the promise of that hour
[1:09:14] when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the
[1:09:17] promise of that hour see it's the Holy
[1:09:20] Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive
[1:09:22] those people that's been for ordained of
[1:09:25] God to be in the Rapture why is the word
[1:09:28] for the age ain't that right every
[1:09:31] promise that is for this age the Holy
[1:09:33] Spirit has come to make manifest and and
[1:09:37] then you say well am I the one that's
[1:09:38] going if the Holy Ghost has found you
[1:09:41] you're going
[1:09:42] Glory see God going to take all the
[1:09:45] questions out there ain't no point
[1:09:47] there's no point in in us being in the
[1:09:49] message and still wondering if we're
[1:09:50] children of God there's there's no point
[1:09:53] if we're having the holy if we've got
[1:09:55] the Holy Ghost amen God doesn't want us
[1:09:57] just sitting around questioning all the
[1:09:59] time I wonder if I'm going to make it I
[1:10:00] wonder if this and I'm wondering that if
[1:10:02] you could look at the power that has
[1:10:04] come to you it's a quickening power
[1:10:08] it's a quickening power can you say Amen
[1:10:10] see so it's the Holy Ghost if you've got
[1:10:13] the Holy Ghost this is what it's come to
[1:10:15] do to you it's come to you to Quicken
[1:10:18] and make a lie make you alive amen see
[1:10:23] because you're ordained of God to be in
[1:10:25] the Rapture so no question about it I'm
[1:10:27] going in a Rapture that's why we say it
[1:10:29] not I want to meet you in the Rapture
[1:10:31] I'm going to meet you in the Rapture I
[1:10:33] will meet you in the Rapture why because
[1:10:36] the Holy Ghost has come and it's
[1:10:39] quickened
[1:10:41] now
[1:10:42] now brother Brown said notice that is if
[1:10:44] he is a true Eagle he will understand
[1:10:46] the message of the hour if he's a true
[1:10:48] eagle
[1:10:49] now the little Eagle probably in the
[1:10:51] barnyard was eaten all right but he
[1:10:54] knowed it wasn't exactly right but when
[1:10:57] he heard the truth he then received this
[1:10:59] truth and you say man so we got a power
[1:11:02] Jesus overcome the world by power the
[1:11:05] quickening power amen but if you look at
[1:11:08] perfect faith in the message perfect
[1:11:11] Faith he brother Brown said Jesus had
[1:11:13] Faith with his power
[1:11:15] Faith see because faith is what causes a
[1:11:19] man to take action
[1:11:21] if you don't believe it you ain't gonna
[1:11:22] act upon it
[1:11:24] if you don't believe that you're you
[1:11:26] know your your Rich uncle is giving you
[1:11:28] ten thousand dollars you ain't gonna go
[1:11:32] if you don't believe in it you'll just
[1:11:34] kind of laugh at it
[1:11:36] and you say I forget that I ain't gonna
[1:11:38] spin my gas all the way down there and
[1:11:39] look like a fool
[1:11:43] if you really believe it
[1:11:45] if he sends you a letter he calls you
[1:11:47] out and says you know
[1:11:48] I hadn't seen you a while but really
[1:11:50] been thinking about you and you're in
[1:11:52] need and and I'm going to give you
[1:11:54] thousands of dollars here I got to check
[1:11:56] fifty thousand and you really believe
[1:11:57] that
[1:12:00] buddy it wouldn't take much you'd get in
[1:12:02] that car and you'd go
[1:12:05] yeah at least I would
[1:12:08] but uh
[1:12:10] we ain't got no Rich uncle
[1:12:13] so faith is what causes a man to take
[1:12:16] action
[1:12:17] now if Jesus didn't have faith
[1:12:20] he wouldn't have healed the sick or
[1:12:22] raised the Dead
[1:12:24] he would have done just like a lot of us
[1:12:25] and just sit there and cried about him
[1:12:29] and ask God why
[1:12:31] why are you allowing these things to
[1:12:33] happen
[1:12:34] but he had Faith with this power
[1:12:37] if he didn't have faith he wouldn't have
[1:12:39] used the word to defeat the Devil with
[1:12:41] he would have just put up with them mind
[1:12:43] battles and let the devil haunt him and
[1:12:45] haunt him and he would have never spoke
[1:12:46] the word if he didn't have faith that
[1:12:48] the word would work if he didn't have
[1:12:50] faith that the word was for him and
[1:12:52] applied to him he would have never
[1:12:54] defeated the devil with that he would
[1:12:55] have just said shoe devil get away I
[1:12:57] just don't understand everybody forsakes
[1:12:59] me and I just don't know why God's
[1:13:01] putting Temptations I just gave my heart
[1:13:02] to God
[1:13:05] if he didn't have faith he wouldn't have
[1:13:07] surrendered to the father's will
[1:13:10] he wouldn't have surrendered his will to
[1:13:12] the father and be led into the
[1:13:14] Wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[1:13:17] but the Bible says he was led to be
[1:13:19] tempted of the devil he was led in the
[1:13:22] wilderness
[1:13:23] but if he had had not faith in what he
[1:13:25] was and in in God's word amen that he
[1:13:28] would have never surrendered his will
[1:13:31] if he didn't have faith see he wouldn't
[1:13:33] have he wouldn't have surrendered his
[1:13:35] will there at at in Gethsemane when he
[1:13:38] said not my will but thine be done he
[1:13:40] would have never walked up God to
[1:13:42] Golgotha they didn't drive him to
[1:13:44] Golgotha they led him to Golgotha he
[1:13:47] willfully gave his life he'd done it by
[1:13:50] faith
[1:13:53] can you say man he did it by faith yes
[1:13:56] sir see it was in human Faith which
[1:13:59] stimulates the human intellectual uh
[1:14:03] side of man but he had the faith of God
[1:14:06] everybody say the faith of God we talked
[1:14:09] about it see uh uh the other night you
[1:14:12] know the have faith in God it means have
[1:14:15] the faith of God possess the the faith
[1:14:17] that God has ain't that right so God by
[1:14:21] his faith created the world did he not
[1:14:23] amen he would have never created if uh
[1:14:26] there was darkness in in all these
[1:14:28] things it was just it was impossible
[1:14:31] there was nothing to to of of anything
[1:14:34] to excite the mind at all but he had
[1:14:37] faith in his own word
[1:14:39] ain't that rad there was nothing
[1:14:41] positive out there he had desires with
[1:14:43] him but within him amen uh to have
[1:14:47] things amen but if he had not Faith amen
[1:14:50] it would have been a hopeless situation
[1:14:54] it would have just been a dreamer
[1:14:58] but he had faith
[1:15:00] and by his faith he believed in his own
[1:15:03] word therefore he said let there be
[1:15:06] he by his faith defeated All Odds by his
[1:15:10] faith he wrote our names in the Lamb's
[1:15:12] Book of Life yet we didn't even exist as
[1:15:14] human beings yet but by faith he desired
[1:15:17] it
[1:15:18] he desired it it was in him we were in
[1:15:21] him
[1:15:22] there was something in him calling for
[1:15:25] it
[1:15:25] and by faith he acted upon him
[1:15:28] before we even become into existence in
[1:15:31] natural form he had already wrote our
[1:15:33] names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:36] by faith he predestinated us he called
[1:15:39] us by his faith he Sanctified us and
[1:15:42] glorified Us by his face
[1:15:45] so he didn't need us to be here first as
[1:15:47] proof
[1:15:49] he didn't even need us to be born right
[1:15:53] he didn't need us to live a sin sinless
[1:15:56] life on our own before he could call us
[1:15:58] he did it all by faith and here you were
[1:16:02] born a wretched sinner but there was a
[1:16:04] man or there was a God who by faith
[1:16:07] called you to be something different
[1:16:11] ain't that right see he he designed our
[1:16:14] lives he he he not only just started us
[1:16:17] but he put an end to it he's already got
[1:16:20] an expected end for every one of us can
[1:16:23] you say amen and I'm telling you he
[1:16:25] knows you're going to make it brother
[1:16:27] Bram said I saw y'all over there amen I
[1:16:30] don't think he was just talking to that
[1:16:31] group of people there I'm talking I
[1:16:33] thought he I believe he was talking to
[1:16:34] every son and daughter of God and when
[1:16:37] he was over there beyond the curtain of
[1:16:38] dime he saw us there he didn't need me
[1:16:41] to be born on this Earth to see me it
[1:16:43] was God by faith
[1:16:45] God by faith
[1:16:48] he did it by faith faith knows what's
[1:16:50] going to be do you believe that if
[1:16:52] you're guessing at it that's not faith
[1:16:53] if you're wishing for it to be that's
[1:16:55] not faith faith knows it's going to be
[1:16:59] you believe it that's why God already
[1:17:01] decreed the end from the beginning
[1:17:03] it's by faith he ain't he didn't wish it
[1:17:07] to happen he didn't wish you to
[1:17:08] Salvation his faith puts you to
[1:17:10] Salvation decreed you to Salvation he
[1:17:13] already knows it's going to happen
[1:17:15] I hope you understand God's faith
[1:17:18] God's faith God's faith it's going to
[1:17:20] happen
[1:17:23] Faith knows it's going to be and see the
[1:17:25] only way that kind of faith can exist is
[1:17:28] by the word of God
[1:17:31] that's right for Jesus said heavens and
[1:17:32] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:17:34] never pass away and God cannot go back
[1:17:37] on his promises
[1:17:39] because he cannot change ain't that
[1:17:42] right he cannot go back see now now look
[1:17:45] at this uh brother Brown says can you
[1:17:47] imagine how pure and adulterated his
[1:17:49] promises are how infinite can you
[1:17:53] imagine how pure and how infinite his
[1:17:55] promises are he said if I'd go to a
[1:17:58] spring and my grandfather drank out of
[1:18:00] that spring and it was clear and testing
[1:18:02] the water and it was a hundred percent
[1:18:04] pure my father drank out of it it was a
[1:18:07] hundred percent pure all the way down
[1:18:10] through life I drunken out of it and it
[1:18:12] was at a hundred percent pure why I'd
[1:18:15] have enough Faith to go back and believe
[1:18:17] if I take a drink of that water it would
[1:18:19] be all right why see because through all
[1:18:23] the generations it's been proven it's
[1:18:25] been tested to be a hundred percent
[1:18:27] proof
[1:18:28] ain't that right so we we find see he
[1:18:32] said because the stream that's gushing
[1:18:34] it up you see that water see uh where
[1:18:39] it's coming from its foundations down
[1:18:41] there it's bad it's throwing up more
[1:18:44] pure water all the time it can't get
[1:18:47] stagnant
[1:18:49] ain't that right so he says now if it'll
[1:18:51] test 100 pure how much more will the
[1:18:54] promise of God test 100 pure percent
[1:18:57] right because of the basis of it God's
[1:19:01] word comes from God and he is that
[1:19:03] Fountain he is the pure inexhaustible
[1:19:06] Fountain he is the holy fountain
[1:19:10] ain't that right so see the word comes
[1:19:13] from God see and which is infinite pure
[1:19:16] holy and he cannot lie for his God so
[1:19:20] there you are now when God promises
[1:19:22] anything you say that's right
[1:19:26] can you say man when God promises
[1:19:28] anything our answer is that's right why
[1:19:31] it's already been tested
[1:19:34] Noah drank from that Fountain David
[1:19:36] drank from that Fountain amen all the
[1:19:38] prophets of old the Patriarchs amen the
[1:19:41] shamgar drank from that Fountain and it
[1:19:43] tested to be right and now here you are
[1:19:46] it's your time to drink from that same
[1:19:48] Fountain and take thee in the promises
[1:19:50] of God and I guarantee you it's still
[1:19:53] just a pure word of God that's where
[1:19:55] your faith needs to be based off of
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:02] have you ever wondered why brother
[1:20:03] Branham always used stories in the Bible
[1:20:05] almost all of his sermons he's used in
[1:20:08] the story of
[1:20:09] whatever
[1:20:10] why
[1:20:12] because he's taking you back to
[1:20:14] Generations where they tasted of that
[1:20:17] pure water
[1:20:18] they tasted of that word and it never
[1:20:21] failed them
[1:20:22] now you can taste of the same word
[1:20:24] and it'll never fail them can you fail
[1:20:26] you can you say man now people always
[1:20:29] putting their faith in everything else
[1:20:30] but the word of God but if you want the
[1:20:33] face of God it has to come only from the
[1:20:36] word of God
[1:20:38] yes sir see amen so we're not we're not
[1:20:41] coming to doctors Faith we're not coming
[1:20:43] to the you know to to the the
[1:20:45] counselor's Faith or theology Faith
[1:20:47] we're coming to perfect faith
[1:20:50] in perfect word ain't that right
[1:20:53] see so we we find there's always of
[1:20:56] course going to be the mixed multitude
[1:20:57] that we're going to have to deal with
[1:21:00] that's where the negative comes from
[1:21:02] that's where the game Sayers come out of
[1:21:06] and and I looked it up a game Sayer is
[1:21:08] one who contradicts what God says in his
[1:21:11] word
[1:21:12] again Sayer will always contradict What
[1:21:14] God Says in his word
[1:21:16] he just will
[1:21:18] you know it's it's the same thing it's
[1:21:21] always been it's always been that mixed
[1:21:23] multitude that attracts distracts the
[1:21:25] people from the promises of God God does
[1:21:28] something great in the in in a service
[1:21:30] and it'll be the game Sayers to pull
[1:21:32] them off aside and tell about the
[1:21:34] problems and tell them about the wolves
[1:21:35] and tell them all that and if if you if
[1:21:38] you're not careful and you start
[1:21:39] listening to that game say your faith
[1:21:41] that God had just done your faith will
[1:21:43] dwindle
[1:21:46] you got to stay on the word of God ain't
[1:21:48] that right you know Jude 1 11 uh
[1:21:51] mentioned those who perished in the game
[1:21:53] saying of Korah see he was he was of
[1:21:56] that mixed multitude ain't that right
[1:21:58] and there were many who were listening
[1:22:01] to the promises of God and yet they
[1:22:03] perished because they sat and listened
[1:22:06] and come under the influence of the gang
[1:22:08] saying of Korra
[1:22:11] but we are not like them
[1:22:14] everybody say I'm not like them
[1:22:16] and I hope you believe that I'm not like
[1:22:18] them
[1:22:19] let them talk ain't my ears ain't for
[1:22:21] that
[1:22:22] let them do whatever they want to I
[1:22:24] ain't gonna fight with it
[1:22:26] ain't doing that we're not like them we
[1:22:28] don't notice we are of the lineage that
[1:22:31] have taken that that that that have
[1:22:34] taken as the prophet says the power of
[1:22:37] faith and pulled from the supernatural
[1:22:40] God and has received their heart's
[1:22:43] desires
[1:22:44] we are of that lineage of that people
[1:22:47] we've come from that lineage a faith
[1:22:49] seed a faith line a man who have taken a
[1:22:53] man the power of faith and have pulled
[1:22:56] from the supernatural God and have
[1:22:59] received our heart's desire I'm telling
[1:23:02] you can have your heart's desire through
[1:23:05] the power of faith
[1:23:10] now God believed his own word
[1:23:14] and then he asks us to believe his own
[1:23:16] his word also
[1:23:18] ain't that right
[1:23:20] now we know Jesus was God made flesh
[1:23:27] The God Who created All Things by his
[1:23:29] faith
[1:23:32] in The Invisible
[1:23:34] was now expressing himself
[1:23:37] through a human body
[1:23:40] expressing that same faith
[1:23:42] called Jesus Christ
[1:23:45] God
[1:23:46] who created the world by his faith
[1:23:50] expressed his faith by speaking the word
[1:23:52] and it was so
[1:23:54] now he comes into a human body called
[1:23:56] Jesus Christ and he expresses that same
[1:24:00] faith
[1:24:02] I'm gonna get somewhere but you just
[1:24:03] hang in there
[1:24:05] Jesus believed in what the word of God
[1:24:08] said
[1:24:09] did he not he believed in what the word
[1:24:12] of God said why God was in him believing
[1:24:16] his own word
[1:24:17] God was in the human body having total
[1:24:20] preeminence in the body and he was
[1:24:23] believing his own word in what he had
[1:24:25] said through the prophets
[1:24:28] Jesus said it was written with me ain't
[1:24:30] that right it's written of me see and so
[1:24:33] now now men All Around Jesus was putting
[1:24:36] their faith in other things
[1:24:38] some put their faith in the doctor's
[1:24:40] report some put their faith in the
[1:24:41] church some put their faith in the
[1:24:43] Creeds of men or their Church Traditions
[1:24:45] amen they were putting their faith in
[1:24:47] all kinds of things see and and and and
[1:24:49] and that's fine if they want to do that
[1:24:51] but I guarantee every one of them showed
[1:24:53] up disappointed amen church will let you
[1:24:55] down preacher will let you down
[1:24:56] philosophy will let you down Creeks of
[1:24:58] men will let you down doctors will let
[1:25:00] you down can you say Amen but all their
[1:25:03] faith was in that but Jesus had the face
[1:25:06] of God which believes his own word
[1:25:10] the faith of God doesn't rely upon what
[1:25:12] a doctor tells you
[1:25:14] Faith Of God that brother Bram talks
[1:25:15] about the the perfect Faith he said if
[1:25:17] the doctor came to you on a Friday
[1:25:19] morning tells you you're gonna die
[1:25:20] within three days or by Monday morning
[1:25:22] you're going to be dead he said if you
[1:25:24] had that perfect Faith you'd laugh in
[1:25:26] that doctor's face
[1:25:28] now if you have faith in the doctor you
[1:25:30] sit and cry a while
[1:25:32] you eat your last meal
[1:25:34] Last Supper
[1:25:38] call the friends and family hopefully
[1:25:41] you got your wheel out and all these
[1:25:42] things and cross your fingers hoping the
[1:25:45] doctor's wrong
[1:25:46] yeah
[1:25:47] but if you have the face of God
[1:25:50] you look at the doctor and say Doc I
[1:25:52] know that's what you are and you're
[1:25:53] telling me from a scientific standpoint
[1:25:55] but my faith is in the word of God
[1:25:58] and the word of God Says by my stripes
[1:26:01] you're healed can you say Amen so I'll
[1:26:03] take that report over a doctor's report
[1:26:07] see God believes his own word now now
[1:26:10] you know people people sometimes will
[1:26:11] say well if God would just tell me
[1:26:13] personally that the promises are for me
[1:26:15] I I would just have more for more faith
[1:26:18] if he would have just wrote my name in
[1:26:21] uh uh you know there in the Bible and
[1:26:25] and if he would just just spell it out
[1:26:27] for me then then then I can I can really
[1:26:30] regress that but you realize even if
[1:26:32] Jesus told you verbatim called you out
[1:26:35] verbatim you still can't have faith
[1:26:37] unless it's totally revealed to you by
[1:26:39] God
[1:26:43] can you say man but I'm telling you God
[1:26:45] doesn't have to call you by name and he
[1:26:48] doesn't have to reveal it to her or or
[1:26:50] tell you he he didn't have to write you
[1:26:52] know Sean Martin every Pro uh name you
[1:26:55] know the promise there well it belongs
[1:26:57] to Sean Martin well
[1:27:00] when when when the prophecy was given
[1:27:02] forth I will not suffer my Holy One to
[1:27:04] see corruption or leave his soul in hell
[1:27:06] it did not say Jesus Christ so Jesus did
[1:27:10] not have a name personally to where he
[1:27:13] could look and and visibly see his name
[1:27:16] I'll not suffer Jesus Christ amen to
[1:27:20] see corruption and I ain't gonna leave
[1:27:22] amen Jesus Christ so in hell it didn't
[1:27:27] say that but there was a God that was in
[1:27:30] Christ that knew what that scripture
[1:27:32] meant and it knew that it pertained to
[1:27:34] that old body
[1:27:36] and God in Christ believed that word for
[1:27:39] him
[1:27:42] is that all right so God doesn't have to
[1:27:45] believe God doesn't have to do that you
[1:27:47] see every promise everybody say every
[1:27:49] promise
[1:27:50] is to the believer
[1:27:52] every promise is to the believer
[1:27:55] you don't have to have your name
[1:27:56] physically tied to it every promise is
[1:27:59] to the believer so the question is are
[1:28:01] you a believer
[1:28:03] ain't that right see the word of God is
[1:28:05] written to the believer and all things
[1:28:08] everybody say all things are possible to
[1:28:11] them that believe you don't have to sit
[1:28:13] there Tangled Up by the devil all things
[1:28:16] are possible to them that believe
[1:28:19] restoration is pi is possible healing is
[1:28:23] possible
[1:28:24] Deliverance is possible if you're a
[1:28:27] believer
[1:28:31] last Wednesday we talked to the two men
[1:28:33] who needed Jesus
[1:28:35] but each man exhibited a different level
[1:28:37] of faith
[1:28:40] the one man
[1:28:41] had to have Jesus lay his hand on the
[1:28:43] girl
[1:28:44] he was a Jew
[1:28:46] but the Roman soldier who was a gentile
[1:28:48] knew the authority of the word
[1:28:51] and only required Jesus to speak the
[1:28:53] word
[1:28:54] so so his faith was a greater Faith than
[1:28:57] that of the Jew
[1:28:59] ain't that right but both got what they
[1:29:03] needed
[1:29:04] from Jesus because of their faith
[1:29:07] and you say man jerias got what he
[1:29:10] needed and and and the Roman Centurion
[1:29:13] got what he needed but it shows that the
[1:29:16] different levels of faith that a man can
[1:29:18] have
[1:29:19] a man that don't have to settle with
[1:29:22] just a little old faith
[1:29:27] or we can say first level faith as I'm
[1:29:30] saying you know some people have enough
[1:29:31] Faith to get healed others have enough
[1:29:33] Faith to get saved
[1:29:35] others have enough Faith to overcome
[1:29:39] others have enough Faith to believe the
[1:29:41] whole in the atonement in full atonement
[1:29:43] you see the foolish virgin they're going
[1:29:45] to go through the tribulation because
[1:29:46] they rejected the fullness the atonement
[1:29:48] in its fullness
[1:29:51] good people
[1:29:53] Godly holy people
[1:29:55] virgins but they didn't have the faith
[1:30:00] to reach up and grab all of it
[1:30:03] so they reject the atonement in its
[1:30:06] fullness
[1:30:08] amen
[1:30:09] so so we we find the greatest faith that
[1:30:13] a man can have is when he recognizes the
[1:30:16] authority of the word
[1:30:18] and that's all he requires
[1:30:23] he doesn't require feelings
[1:30:26] he doesn't require sensation
[1:30:28] he doesn't require proof
[1:30:32] he recognizes the authority of the word
[1:30:35] just speak the word
[1:30:38] ain't that right
[1:30:40] see faith and gifts are all right but
[1:30:42] gifts will fail
[1:30:44] faith in the land of hands one of hands
[1:30:46] is all right but there's a greater Faith
[1:30:48] than that
[1:30:50] and it's the ultimate faith
[1:30:52] for it's God's faith
[1:30:56] and it's taking God at his word
[1:30:59] is that right
[1:31:01] now I believe this is why God sent us a
[1:31:03] prophet
[1:31:06] of Malachi 4 for the word everybody say
[1:31:09] the word comes to a prophet
[1:31:11] Sensations come to maybe something else
[1:31:14] theology comes to something else but the
[1:31:16] word come to a prophet
[1:31:19] ain't that right and today the believer
[1:31:22] of this day the adorndained believer has
[1:31:25] recognized the authority of the word of
[1:31:28] God
[1:31:30] recognize the authority of the word and
[1:31:33] upon that Faith there will be a rapture
[1:31:38] upon that Faith by that Faith there's
[1:31:40] going to be a body change
[1:31:42] by that faith
[1:31:45] the old is going to be turned young
[1:31:47] again
[1:31:49] ain't that right
[1:31:51] now brother Brahm says I want you I want
[1:31:53] you to get built up now in this holy
[1:31:56] Oracles of God in the faith the faith of
[1:31:58] this hour
[1:31:59] everybody say the faith of this hour
[1:32:01] all kinds of Faith but there's a faith
[1:32:04] of this hour
[1:32:06] the the faith see it's going to take
[1:32:08] more faith than ever was in any age
[1:32:11] for this has to be a rapturing faith to
[1:32:14] be taken up
[1:32:16] oh sure they had a level of Faith back
[1:32:18] and loser but not enough Faith to get
[1:32:21] them out of here
[1:32:22] they had enough faith in Pentecost but
[1:32:24] look where all that went too not enough
[1:32:27] Faith to get us out of here but there's
[1:32:29] a people on this Earth that has
[1:32:31] recognized the authority of the word
[1:32:33] again amen and it's a rapturing faith
[1:32:37] it's a power to change them
[1:32:40] and I say it's changing us now
[1:32:44] yes sir so we want you to believe
[1:32:47] tonight in all that you have seen heard
[1:32:49] the word that you have heard preached
[1:32:52] the signs and wonders that you have seen
[1:32:54] done we want you to accumulate all that
[1:32:57] together in your heart and consider it
[1:32:58] whether that be of God or not
[1:33:02] now that if it's of God if you believe
[1:33:04] it of God what is it going to do it's
[1:33:06] going to build your faith
[1:33:08] that's what it's doing it's going to
[1:33:09] build your faith now Church you realize
[1:33:12] where we're coming from
[1:33:14] look as the church has moved look where
[1:33:16] we've elevated in so much that the
[1:33:18] prophet said we're in an astronaut age
[1:33:23] can't you can't have the message and
[1:33:25] living on a horse and buggy
[1:33:27] that's a slap in God's face in my
[1:33:29] opinion
[1:33:34] if God gave we couldn't have the
[1:33:36] astronaut age spiritually without the
[1:33:39] message of the hour
[1:33:41] but it's a perfect faith
[1:33:43] perfect Faith given to that individual
[1:33:47] makes him an astronaut
[1:33:48] because by that Faith he has the power
[1:33:51] to rise up above everything he rises
[1:33:54] higher than Luther Wesley pinnacock he
[1:33:57] rises above it all he's into orbit
[1:34:06] the power of faith is a creative power
[1:34:09] you believe it
[1:34:11] see you you don't need things to get
[1:34:14] better before the miracle comes your
[1:34:16] faith has the power to create
[1:34:18] God didn't take in this day he didn't
[1:34:21] take dirt and creates and make squirrels
[1:34:24] he spoke his word and created squirrels
[1:34:27] when there was no squirrels
[1:34:31] now
[1:34:34] I think we talked about it last
[1:34:36] maybe not last Wednesday but when Jesus
[1:34:39] performed his first miracle he took
[1:34:42] water and turned it into wine
[1:34:44] see brother Brown said he took water
[1:34:45] which potentially someday might have
[1:34:48] been wine
[1:34:49] but it was water first
[1:34:53] says what did he do when he fed the 5
[1:34:56] 000 people he took something that had
[1:34:59] been like water
[1:35:01] he took a fish that once swam and was
[1:35:04] born from an egg and broke it and
[1:35:06] another fish growed
[1:35:08] onto the creation that was the original
[1:35:10] creation
[1:35:12] he took bread that was once a seed and
[1:35:15] then he turned it into a wheat and then
[1:35:17] into bread
[1:35:19] and then he broke from this bread and
[1:35:21] the creation only molted plaid
[1:35:24] but everybody say but
[1:35:27] in the woods there was nothing there to
[1:35:31] make a squirrel
[1:35:32] Let There Be and there was without
[1:35:36] anything to break it from
[1:35:39] what is it the same Jesus Christ see
[1:35:42] greater things than this will you do for
[1:35:45] I go to my father not take something
[1:35:47] that's been created and break something
[1:35:49] from it and multiply a creation but
[1:35:52] absolutely create
[1:35:55] showing that he's the same Jehovah that
[1:35:58] stood back there and said let there be
[1:36:01] am there was
[1:36:05] his word was made manifesty and when he
[1:36:08] was made Flesh on Earth he he took his
[1:36:11] original creation broke it back and
[1:36:13] multiplied it but now in the last days
[1:36:15] when he comes down Among Us the same
[1:36:17] light that moved down and said let there
[1:36:19] be light he J see he just speak the
[1:36:23] creation into existence greater than
[1:36:25] this will you do for I go to my father
[1:36:27] remember we're at these times
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:34] we're at these times
[1:36:36] and you say Amen
[1:36:38] see so we we have come to where all we
[1:36:43] need is the word to be spoken
[1:36:46] Bridge yeah
[1:36:49] I'm not I'm not saying that laying on
[1:36:52] hands is wrong
[1:36:54] brother Branham did it all of his
[1:36:56] ministry
[1:36:59] but I am telling you this we're in an
[1:37:02] age
[1:37:03] we're in a Time
[1:37:07] where all we need is the word to be
[1:37:09] spoke
[1:37:12] can you say man
[1:37:14] and I want to say it this way the word
[1:37:15] has been spoken through a prophet
[1:37:18] and every promise is at our fingertips
[1:37:21] all that is required of us is to believe
[1:37:26] how many believers do we have
[1:37:28] now all that's required of us is just to
[1:37:30] believe ain't that right
[1:37:32] now see now notice if you will believe
[1:37:35] what he said
[1:37:37] then you will do what he said for it's
[1:37:39] God in you
[1:37:41] believing and performing his own word
[1:37:46] now I'm going to close I want to leave
[1:37:49] this with you
[1:37:50] we have read about
[1:37:52] and talked about the faith that Jarius
[1:37:54] had jerias
[1:37:57] he believed that if Jesus would come and
[1:37:59] if he would just lay his hands upon his
[1:38:02] daughter she would live
[1:38:04] be made well
[1:38:06] we then have read about the faith that
[1:38:09] the Centurion woman had
[1:38:13] and and his faith was if you'll just
[1:38:17] speak the word my servant shall live
[1:38:20] and and we see the power of their faith
[1:38:25] but then let's just for just a few
[1:38:28] minutes look at the faith Jesus had
[1:38:33] because I I think that's important and I
[1:38:35] think that's the faith that we're coming
[1:38:37] to my thoughts of this
[1:38:40] Jesus brother Brown said had perfect
[1:38:43] faith
[1:38:44] it's a different type of faith
[1:38:47] now remember the boy that had an
[1:38:49] absolute epilepsy demon
[1:38:51] see when he met Jesus the disciples
[1:38:54] couldn't do nothing with him so when he
[1:38:55] met Jesus the the boy was threw into a
[1:38:59] harder fit than he had ever had
[1:39:01] and brother Brown said it's because that
[1:39:03] devil knew that he had met faith on a
[1:39:05] different level than what the apostles
[1:39:07] had he had met a perfect faith and
[1:39:10] that's what we must have everybody say
[1:39:12] we must have it
[1:39:13] perfect faith
[1:39:15] to make the perfect word of God perform
[1:39:18] perfectly that's it we must believe it
[1:39:20] without a shadow of a doubt ain't that
[1:39:23] right
[1:39:24] so notice the faith that Jesus had he
[1:39:27] said I can do nothing in myself
[1:39:29] he couldn't heal the Sick by his own
[1:39:31] ability he couldn't raise the dead by
[1:39:33] his own ability he couldn't walk on the
[1:39:34] Water by his own ability but his faith
[1:39:38] wasn't it himself
[1:39:41] ain't that right
[1:39:44] his faith was in the word
[1:39:48] now brother Brandon said he relied upon
[1:39:52] what he was
[1:39:56] he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:40:02] word
[1:40:05] I think that's where our faith is coming
[1:40:06] he had faith in God who made him the
[1:40:10] word
[1:40:11] he was God the word and they was in him
[1:40:15] and that gave him Faith because he
[1:40:18] understood his position
[1:40:24] it's one thing to look at him and says
[1:40:26] oh if I could have that Minister just
[1:40:28] just to pray for me
[1:40:30] it's one thing to say oh if I just was
[1:40:32] with brother Branham if I could just
[1:40:33] been there and he could tell me
[1:40:35] everything what I needed to know
[1:40:37] that's one thing that's good your faith
[1:40:39] there whatever
[1:40:41] but Jesus faith
[1:40:43] he understood his position
[1:40:49] he wasn't looking to say man if I was in
[1:40:50] the days of Joshua
[1:40:52] if I was just in the days of David if I
[1:40:54] could have just been with him no he knew
[1:40:57] his position
[1:40:59] so his faith was in what he was God made
[1:41:04] him to be
[1:41:07] and you say man
[1:41:09] see he had faith in God who made him the
[1:41:12] word he was God the word they was in him
[1:41:15] and that gave him Faith because he
[1:41:18] understood his position another place he
[1:41:21] know what he was because the scripture
[1:41:24] had said he was this
[1:41:26] and hear every scripture tied in to
[1:41:29] prove that he was exactly what the
[1:41:31] scripture said he would be and he knew
[1:41:34] what he was
[1:41:36] blind Bartimaeus knew what he was
[1:41:39] and his faith reached out to him and he
[1:41:41] got healed right the woman at the well
[1:41:43] knew what he was knew who he was he had
[1:41:47] performed the Messiah sign ain't that
[1:41:49] right and and she said sir give me the
[1:41:52] drink you know and and and she went into
[1:41:54] the Town come and see a man who has told
[1:41:56] me all these things isn't this the
[1:41:57] Messiah so her faith uh uh uh by her
[1:42:02] face she knew who he was Mary Magdalene
[1:42:04] knew who he was the Legion of demons
[1:42:08] knew who he was
[1:42:10] ain't that right but the most important
[1:42:14] thing was he knew who he was
[1:42:21] he didn't need people to tell him you're
[1:42:23] the Messiah you're the Messiah you're
[1:42:24] the Messiah you're the Messiah
[1:42:26] he had taken the scriptures
[1:42:29] and by his faith knew that the scripture
[1:42:32] had applied to him
[1:42:35] he was the one that wouldn't see
[1:42:37] corruption
[1:42:39] he was the one whose Soul wouldn't be
[1:42:42] left in hell he was the one and he's so
[1:42:44] relied upon that scripture that he told
[1:42:47] him all that was there destroy this
[1:42:49] Temple and within three days I will
[1:42:51] raise it up again
[1:42:53] what was it it was this God that was in
[1:42:55] him believing that only his own word
[1:43:01] now notice brother Brian said he knew
[1:43:03] with that perfect faith that he was the
[1:43:05] anointed Messiah that the spirit of God
[1:43:07] was upon him
[1:43:08] see so he could do nothing in himself it
[1:43:11] was his faith in God
[1:43:15] ain't that right
[1:43:17] he relied upon what he was and the
[1:43:19] scriptures told him what he was so
[1:43:22] notice in the face of sickness his faith
[1:43:25] controlled him
[1:43:28] in the face of death his faith
[1:43:31] controlled him
[1:43:34] in the time of Temptation his faith
[1:43:38] controlled him
[1:43:40] in the face of rejection and criticism
[1:43:43] his faith controlled him
[1:43:46] brother Brian said Faith perfect Faith
[1:43:48] Masters all circumstances no matter what
[1:43:51] it is it Masters it he said now just
[1:43:54] watch when you believe anything do
[1:43:55] anything and you got faith in what
[1:43:57] you're doing no matter what the
[1:43:59] circumstances is that don't have one
[1:44:01] thing to do with it it Masters that
[1:44:04] circumstance if it's in a room of
[1:44:07] sickness and the Lord's revealed that
[1:44:09] this certain thing is going to happen
[1:44:10] you just speak it and go on
[1:44:14] yeah
[1:44:15] just don't ask any questions it's
[1:44:17] already over just keep going why Faith
[1:44:20] Masters all circumstances well if you do
[1:44:23] this so-and-so's going to do see you see
[1:44:25] well it already got it mastered see
[1:44:28] Faith believes that God will work it out
[1:44:32] what a faith we need eh Faith believes
[1:44:36] that God's going to work it out I don't
[1:44:37] know how he's going to do it but he'll
[1:44:39] do it anyhow see it Masters all
[1:44:42] circumstances that's the faith Jesus had
[1:44:47] Satan was over there in the in the in
[1:44:49] the Temptation trying to twist all the
[1:44:51] scriptures and and even question and put
[1:44:53] the question mark in him if thou be the
[1:44:55] Son of God and every time by faith Jesus
[1:44:59] would take the word and would write back
[1:45:01] to the to the devil
[1:45:03] give it right back give it right back
[1:45:04] why he did it by his faith
[1:45:07] brother Brown said if Jesus relied upon
[1:45:09] what God made him and what the word of
[1:45:11] God said about him then cannot we rely
[1:45:13] upon what God has made us as believers
[1:45:17] these signs shall follow them that
[1:45:18] believe he had Faith what he was and if
[1:45:20] you are a Believer you have faith in
[1:45:22] what you are you are a believer
[1:45:26] you're a believer
[1:45:29] you love him
[1:45:32] a man cannot have faith when his heart
[1:45:35] is condemning him
[1:45:39] in church this is where this is where
[1:45:43] we've got to live a right life
[1:45:46] forsake the world man
[1:45:48] you cannot have this faith
[1:45:51] and and dilly-dallying with the world
[1:45:54] get rid of it
[1:45:56] because you cannot have confidence in
[1:45:58] God toward God if your heart is
[1:46:00] condemning you brother Brian said you
[1:46:02] know what brother said if your heart is
[1:46:04] condemning you you put yourself right
[1:46:05] back as a sinner again
[1:46:08] wow that's what he's saying
[1:46:12] he said when you automatically put
[1:46:14] yourself back there a sinner by knowing
[1:46:16] you're wrong
[1:46:20] now in that sense you know you say well
[1:46:23] I thought I had the Holy Ghost that's
[1:46:24] that's not the point
[1:46:26] the point is is you may have the Holy
[1:46:29] Ghost but if your heart's condemning you
[1:46:32] you can't have confidence in God you
[1:46:35] can't have that Faith you you can't act
[1:46:37] as a son of God
[1:46:39] I'm telling you Church
[1:46:43] we can't be Dilly dealing with the world
[1:46:45] and have this type of faith
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:49] just can
[1:46:52] if our heart condemns us but if our
[1:46:55] heart doesn't condemn us then we have
[1:46:58] confidence toward God then what does he
[1:47:01] say then you can ask
[1:47:04] what you will it'll be given to you
[1:47:06] ask
[1:47:08] see
[1:47:11] you love the Lord
[1:47:15] so we we find the only thing the prophet
[1:47:19] said you have to do then is have faith
[1:47:21] in what you are
[1:47:22] have faith in what you are have faith in
[1:47:26] what the word says you are can you say
[1:47:29] Amen you see well how do I get that
[1:47:31] Faith by the message of the hour
[1:47:33] I know people have used this message for
[1:47:35] legalism and just to beat the people up
[1:47:37] and all that stuff and and they they've
[1:47:39] taken it totally out of context
[1:47:41] and I understand and there's people that
[1:47:43] makes Grace a disgrace and all that and
[1:47:45] and there ain't no no and then then
[1:47:48] everybody just wants to live loose
[1:47:50] well you can't live like that either
[1:47:52] you see the message doesn't come to beat
[1:47:54] you up and it doesn't come to let you
[1:47:56] live in any way all you want to it come
[1:47:58] to let you know you're a son of God
[1:48:01] you're a Son of God God is Holy you're
[1:48:03] going to be holy God but God believes
[1:48:05] his own word you're going to believe his
[1:48:06] word
[1:48:07] right God just he can't stand the sin
[1:48:11] and the mock and the filth well you're
[1:48:13] not going to want to do that either
[1:48:16] ain't that right so he comes to identify
[1:48:18] us not as a church member not just
[1:48:20] somebody that's trying to barely make it
[1:48:22] and all this and just Beggars and
[1:48:24] hopeless and all that he come to
[1:48:25] identify to us that we're sons of God he
[1:48:29] takes that word and interprets it the
[1:48:31] right way
[1:48:33] now believe what the word of God says
[1:48:35] about you amen amen that's all that's
[1:48:37] required believe what the word of God
[1:48:38] says about you can you say man if the
[1:48:41] musicians will come
[1:48:46] Jesus went and laid his hands on the
[1:48:48] girl
[1:48:51] for Jarius
[1:48:54] see he drives went to Jesus and said if
[1:48:56] if you just come why because he
[1:48:58] recognized what Jesus was
[1:49:00] he had that level of faith
[1:49:03] I said if you come lay your hands well
[1:49:05] Jesus went and laid hands why because he
[1:49:08] knew who he was
[1:49:10] Centurion had a greater faith is I don't
[1:49:14] need you to come and lay hands on
[1:49:17] I recognize you as a man of authority
[1:49:20] you speak as one with an authority now
[1:49:23] speak it so Jesus
[1:49:25] spoke the word
[1:49:27] see the Centurion believed in who he was
[1:49:30] and Jesus spoke
[1:49:33] because he believed
[1:49:34] in who he was
[1:49:37] not because the Centurion believed in
[1:49:39] who he was
[1:49:40] Jesus didn't need somebody to prop him
[1:49:43] up
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:45] that's why he could go alone and face
[1:49:48] Calvary
[1:49:49] because he had a perfect faith
[1:49:52] in the perfect word of God
[1:49:54] can you say man you love him
[1:49:57] what the song
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] oh we've got the power
