paying attention to it but there was just something that kind of stood out to me they were saying something along the lines of um you know we can love and serve God in spite of this place but then they said well probably not in spite but because of this place we will learn to love him and serve him in a way that we never did before and I just thinking about you know our trials and things we go through sometimes we're just trying to get through it but if we could just realize that sometimes he puts us there and allows us to go through those things so that he can show himself in a way that we've never seen him before and and we would know him just in a a greater way I just know I want more of him myself we have had enough of getting everything we [Music] want and we are weary of living

good to be here in the house of the Lord and Trust uh you all had a good day today and um uh just always good to serve the Lord amen and we'll take just the good days and that we get and good weather and uh we'll take the bad too but uh certainly enjoy the good amen beautiful day today praise the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and uh it's good to be back home and uh Judah and I had a good trip um there we survived New York amen and that's a different place up there but uh um we uh had a good time with sister Anna and the boys and uh her family and um uh so I know they appreciate the prayers and um the um the texts and calls amen and um we certainly want to keep them uh continue keeping them in our prayer yes and losing a loved one is never easy and uh especially when it comes suddenly as that did but uh we uh originally had planned to arrive up there Tuesday and afternoon and come home start heading home on Thursday so uh we just packed really light and um um uh but we got there and my um um uh as we was visiting you know I I just had my shirt on my pants and you know we did not uh just just relaxing you know and later on the pastor showed up and suit and tie and and everybody started kind of getting dressed and I was like you know what's happening here and anyway they they were having a home service and the pastor asked me to speak and um so anyway it was kind of a sudden thing but we did and and talked to the people a little bit and and uh uh afterward he U he said I want you to speak U uh the uh viewing tomorrow night and I said okay so um um if you have your Bibles we can turn to the revelations the third chapter but so um we get there that evening and uh they have a different way of uh how they do the viewing but uh there was that place was packed I don't know 400 500 maybe or so and um didn't know it at the time but it was a lot of Hindu uh people there and but um um it was my turn to talk we took uh just a few minutes to uh talk to the people and um just kind of went along the lines that I did at brother Walker's funeral speaking of a change and what we have to look forward to and um people really listened intently and um uh when I was finishing up the presence of the Lord just dropped in that place and uh you could just feel his presence and uh so we really thankful to the Lord and uh had a lot of uh people said really helped them they enjoyed it and so you never know what what you plant you know and um so after after that the pastor just um which is sister Anna's brother and brother Isaac he uh just uh more pleaded with me to stay over and I said well I can't and I said I ain't got close for one and uh said I you know the couple Brothers uh had helped rent a car so I said I got to have that car back and um said you know I got to be back at my own service and stuff and so he kept asking and I said no I I can't and uh so we headed home uh Thursday evening after the funeral and got about 2 and a half hours away and I just felt man just felt that I had to go back and um you know I think it's important uh to follow the leading of the Holy Ghost and I know uh you Elders especially and brother Terry you being an elder Minister uh knows how important that is you know and so we um we we you know I text him I said well brother Isaac if you think I can help your people you know I I'll come and um so he he had us to come back and the Lord just uh moved in the services I didn't know it but they had service Friday night as well at their church so we had to speak then and then of course Sunday morning and U that God was gracious and I just pray that it was a help to the the people to the family and uh that God would um just um encourage them Amen brother Anthony was a real Backbone in that church and uh he' done a lot of things and so um Not only was he just a friend a family member but the church lost a a real uh uh support amen and so I know they're they' just all devastated at this time but they're they're strong and they're moving right on and so we thank the Lord for that amen and so uh but the Book of Revelations the third chapter and appreciate Daniel uh for filling in for me on such a short short notice there and uh heard that the service went good so we thank the Lord for that but uh Revelations 3 and I want to start I guess at the the 14th verse and unto the angel of the Church of the Le oans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou W I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked amen if you turn with me also to uh I believe it's the uh Romans the 12th chapter amen and we'll just read the first two verses Romans 12 1 and 2 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living SA sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer father as the songs have been sung and the worship gone forth we pray Lord that it has been acceptable in your sight father Lord and as it's been expressed we want to draw closer to you and that's certainly my desire and I pray father that you would draw us all closer to thee you alone know the the the intent of our hearts Lord our motive father you know the things that maybe we struggle with and the things that we we we want to lay down need to lay down and father just to so we could be more free that we could be more liberated to serve you I pray that you would give us the grace to do that father just bless your word bless the ministering of your word and the hearing is is our prayer we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen you can be seated and good to have uh Kevin back amen and um uh we thought that uh he had taken a bus to Florida amen where it's warmer amen but uh um surprise amen but but uh so here uh I'm if I have a title I'm going to call it overcoming the age of lukewarmness and this is just something that's been on my heart um here lately and um I want to just share with you uh for just a few moments but uh all of us know that there are seven Church ages uh that God has allotted uh the Gentiles and uh it is called the Gentile dispensation uh which is a a space of time in which God has given himself he's allotted himself this time uh to fulfill his purpose and his plan of what he has predestinated to do and that is to uh call out of the Gentiles a people for his name to make up his bride in Acts 15:14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name and so we we find that uh this time is is it's not our time uh per se because we will never in in in our lifetime we will never be done with achievements uh we've always got things to do and that's that's the problem is we're never we we when God turns the corner when God does things in our life so abruptly it it it's it's hard to understand because we're not ready we feel like we're not we're not ready for that uh we're still going down a path and we still figuring things out but so really the time clock is set for him to do what he wants to do and uh uh the Bible also calls it the times of the Gentiles and so but within this time in this time frame we we see uh uh through the message of the hour that there is is is a false Church of false Vine and and so then there's two churches existing uh but only one is being formed at uh to to make up the Bride of Jesus Christ the and and those that um uh are are part of this this body of Christ the bride of Christ uh uh it they are the Overcomers um there and and so uh brother Bram says now of course that false church that false body will always try to usurp the position of the true church and contend that she and not the elect are the real and authentic and the false will try to kill the true so so there has always been a struggle uh in this times of the Gentiles which we even go before that but but uh uh of of a a fight a a a Waring a a a contending or one is trying to kill out and one is trying to to live and and and these things and so but but uh uh even at the beginning of time there's always been two uh um uh and and and so in in the be uh in the Garden of Eden the the Book of Genesis talks about it that there were two main trees that God speaks of and that is the tree of death uh and the Tree of Life One One Tree was good the other tree was evil uh one was a tree of death and the other tree a tree of of Life One produced Life One produced death uh and just them two trees and and then there were two children in the garden there was Cain and Abel and they were Twins and uh uh both offered sacrifices to God but but as we know Cain was the evil one and uh he was his father was the Wicked one for the Bible says he was of that Wicked one and then then you find the other brother Abel he was righteous before the Lord and and loved the Lord and and and so we know his his story things like that but then later on in time there were two other boys that were um uh that that were born of the same flesh uh of Mama and Dad had the same parents and and and they were twins Jacob and Esau and the prophet said one was the elect of God and the other one was a reprobate but if you notice they both worshiped God Cain and Abel both worshiped God Esau and Jacob both worshiped God and so brother Brandon would say in every single case there was uh worship of God involved in every case the evil hated the righteous and persecuted the righteous in some cases the evil destroyed the righteous but notice they were planted together they lived together they both made claims upon God and worshiped God Amen so this this was all the way through the Old Testament then in the New Testament Jesus gives us a parable of of of two sers uh and and they planted seed one planted one seed the other planted another seed and they both planted in the same field so they were planted together they grew up together and matured together and and all these things and so but they planted two different kinds of seed uh uh one uh planted the wheat and and the other planted the tears and we know that God planted the wheat Satan planted the tears and Matthew 13:38 uh Jesus said now the field is the world so really this this wheat and and and tear involves human beings um and and so the the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels see so there at the end time then there's going to be a harvest and of of both ain't that right and so as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their father and so if if you notice not not the wheat that and the tear that are planted in the same field the tear doesn't become the wheat the wheat doesn't become the terror but but yet they they still they they they reap from this they they uh benefit from the rain same rain they benefit from the same sunshine and and they both are growing up see coming to that maturity well then shortly after the day of Pentecost uh uh God planted his church on that day of Pentecost and that was the genuine church that would be the church that God would pattern after uh his All Through the Ages that would be the pattern for all all all all elect down Through the Ages and and uh uh God would be in that church it would be a that that's that's what he would uh uh fulfill his dreams and fulfill his vision and his purpose would be in that in that church but then shortly after the day of Pentecost the the false Vine got intertwined uh uh it it it it intertwined itself around the True Vine and then we find the Deeds of the nicians and so that that Spirit the prophet said has fought the True Vine all the way through through the church ages and will do so until it is destroyed by God so there will always be that friction there will always be a spirit that is Waring against the True Vine that true elect there there will always be a Warfare until that spirit is utterly destroyed ain't that right and so then you you you look in the Book of Revelations that God addresses each church and uh uh and talks about each one he and and and and so the the true the true church the false church God addresses them through the church ages and and uh uh uh and talks about them and and the prophet said he calls them both the true and false he calls them the church see and and it's almost as if he's talking about one church but he's not he's talking about two churches he's addressing two churches he calls them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit for only the elect will not be deceived ain't that right now so so if God has allotted this time himself a time to make up this bride and and bring her to a maturity and reflect himself through her well we we know that this Leota Church age is the last of them it's the last of the of the the Gentile dispensation and that's the age that we are living in which which means that the door of Mercy is about closed we we don't know when that is uh we we do know that the prophet preached souls in prison and and even at the end he's wondering is it already uh you know and he's he's tore up about these things and and uh but but it it had been so real to him uh and and realizing that we are at the end of time and he talks about the things that when he he had went either in a vision or an experience that he went into hell and what he saw in Hell he actually saw on the earth at a mall and he says I'm looking at this and and he says it just well you all if you've heard heard that message uh uh you you know where he was at and it really tore him up that what he saw in Hell was now there in manifesting itself in this dimension of time and and so uh uh and so he he was showing or then then he got that sermon Soul's in prison now and and so but when the the door of Mercy is is closed see then the day of Grace will be over for the Gentiles amen and then then is fulfilled the scripture in Revelations 22:11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still amen and he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that is righteous let him be righteous still he that is Holy let him be holy still amen there comes a time that that what a person is it it'll be forever be there'll be no changing and and and and and this is we're somewhere in somewhere at this time and and of course we know that as long as the bride is on this Earth she'll be doing everything she can to reach souls and but but it it but it shows exactly the times that we're living in and and so uh every predestinated seed at the time when that door is shut every predestinated seed of God will be in and and the bride will be complete and and I I believe that we're just we're just close there somewhere amen where this bride and uh uh uh is complete and and then those who are not part of the Bride well they're just what the prophet would say Canon fod and and and and and so uh uh brother Brandon says in one place it's a fod that'll mix uh with smoke out of Torment he called it Atomic ashes and you know in other words that they're just here for the tribulation and and and they'll it'll just be just Atomic ashes now we understand that there will be people that will make it and receive eternal life but we're talking about the bride of Christ and and and this Bride is a different uh a group of people because they won't have to go through tribulation they they don't have that they have an intimate relationship with Christ today and and so uh but uh uh Canon F it's it's something that's going to be destroyed in other words now in in the beginning of the book of Revelations and and you just have to bear with me but John writes to seven churches uh Revelations 1:4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia and and uh just you know Prophet gives us a little history of it the these churches are in Asia Minor and it it's just it was about the size of a pens of Vania or Indiana just a small little area and and and and so uh uh but he's writing to these churches in Asia Minor for the ages uh were to come in the future the church ages but but see these seven churches were were praised and exalted for what they had done and and and so uh uh the prophet tells us that these these seven churches weren't the only churches that existed at that time there there were other churches that had existed uh uh but why would John write to these seven churches is because that these churches had a characteristic uh about them that would be expressed in the church ages to come and and and the prophet tells us that these churches these seven churches were Gentile churches and uh uh uh and and so and so John did not address the church at Jerusalem which was made up mostly of Jews and and things and the reason why he didn't do that is is because God had already turned from the Jews on and and uh to the Gentiles and and so these churches and the church ages would be to the Gentiles uh uh uh people and so brother bradam said so thus the whole of the church ages is dealing with the gentille and calling out a gentile bride to himself ain't that right amen see and so each one of these churches had a characteristic that was significant uh uh for for the ages uh to come and and brother Brown said that characteristics would would follow down through the age like Ephesus the first church age you know had a characteristics and samna had its own characteristics and pergamus and thyra and and all these things see and so the the characteristic of that church would appear in the church ages uh uh uh uh to come I I hope you understand and so the Ephesian Church Age expressed the characteristics of the Ephesus Church um uh it it told uh it told what the church was and the characteristics of that church uh and again some little history the city of Ephesus was one of the three great cities of Asia it was often called the third city of Christian faith Jerusalem was was the first one uh uh uh Antioch and then Ephesus see and so uh the city of Ephesus it was a city of great Commerce and trade the language was Greek the government was Roman and and Christianity was established uh in Ephesus by by Paul the Apostle amen and and his teachings bore great influence to the Believers there it was in Paul's time that the church was a strong Church a church was a was a a a great church see uh uh but then uh uh if you look um the Ephesian Church age is the first age and brother bradam says it's in this age the church made up of good is made up of good and bad two Vines make the church they are like the wheat and tears growing up side by side but one is true and the other one is false ain't that right now if you look in Revelations 2 and 2 uh uh God is addressing this church age the Ephesus Church age Ephesian I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst bear them cannot bear them which are evil and thou Hast tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and hasth not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember wherefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first Works everybody say the first work Works do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of nicians which I also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches to him everybody say to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so so uh uh uh now the word Ephesus means let go uh uh backsliding relax it was called by God the backsliding church the backslidden age uh um the prophet would say God acknowledged first their Works their labor and their patience God rebuked their living leaving their first love for backsliding and for no longer bearing light so so he says now Ephesus was not a DC church it failed Itself by not continuing in perfect love ain't that right see and and and so then then uh he goes on says and God tells them to remember evidently something had left their mind they had forgot en something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost see they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and wonder of it it was time to go back in mind and then in reality ain't that right see back to when they could say for me to live is Christ back to Purity when ananas and Safar were dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts that defile his name see let those who name his name depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God see look at what you were you once were in your heart and mind and in your life and then go back to it ain't that right now see so that's that was God's uh uh uh uh ad I guess or uh uh to that first church church age was to go back what whatever left in your mind go back amen go back to your origin go back to where God was number one in your life go back to where you were on fire for God go back to where the God could do the mighty Works in in in in your life ain't that right now the the way back is the way of repentance God was telling them to repent and and and go back you see God gave that eisan age a chance to repent just like he did Cain and and yet it refused to do so now we know what repent means it means to turn from to go back and get your first experience ain't that right repent to turn from go back turn from and and go back to your your first experience see in other words do the things that you did at the beginning you know I I think that so many people today need to go back amen and and do their first works and you know it's easy a lot of times to uh uh e Even in our own lives uh to where we we forget about the the things of God and we let the the things of God become common we let the message become common we let our freedoms to worship God become common we we let our Christianity become common and and and see and so you know people used to be on fire for God and you know they they wouldn't let nothing discourage them they would be at church no matter what it it just they they were on fire for God they they wouldn't let little things uh keep them down you know it it just sad when you see matur people get into a go gossiping session and and and things and you're thinking that's not a Christian that's that's not what Christians do is down the church down the people down this down that and so negative about things and it it but but it they feed off of that instead of feeding off the the the the the the life of the word that that we're supposed to nowadays people can't even take time to come to the house of God and just to give things for what God has done for them they've got so many excuses that they live by anymore if they got just a snotty nose uh they can't come to church if they if you know and and God has done so much for people and and and I I just have to tell you it's a backsliding condition that that's what it is amen I know you Justified people justify these things but but I'll just tell you what you are you're backslid it's it's just that way it's it's it's a backslid condition to to uh uh uh when we become so weak in our faith that we can't trust God for things anymore you understand what I'm saying right see so God told them to repent and do the first Works go back to the first works you see Christianity has Works how many believes that Christianity has Works amen see brother Brandon would say it this way you are saved by grace how many believes that you are saved by grace you you cannot Merit your salvation uh nothing that you can do can can Merit the the uh the the uh uh Salvation it's the Grace Grace saves you Grace is what God does for you amen and we're so glad for that amen but notice what he says next Works everybody say works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you amen see works and Grace go together see as if if you know if if I would you know uh you know I don't know I I'll say Sister Kim Sister Kim weeks if if I if I had a million dollars and I gave you uh $500,000 and I say you know you and John y'all go take you a trip to the Bahamas y'all it's all paid for and all that I guarantee you I guarantee you amen someone's going to be excited about it somebody's going to say thank thank you for that and somebody's going to show an appreciation amen because that she didn't have to earn it John didn't have to earn it amen that they didn't have it but I gave it to them amen and then it it it requires not that I demand that they show appreciation but there's something within them that they're Overjoyed about it they're excited about it they they they you you understand and and and there's things that people have done for us that we think oh wow you know and and you can't help but just uh uh go to them and say I thank you for that I send them a card of thanks and send them this uh or whatever see and it's without money or without price God gave you that salvation without you having to do nothing back amen but there's now we return this as a as in an appreciation if God saved your soul there should not be a number of days amen that you would count and say well I've done enough to show my appreciation amen if he saved your soul that means he you're going to live eternally with him amen and that should re that should require a a a a response from us as long as we live whether we're sick or whether we're well whether we're discouraged or whether we're up on the Mountaintop where whether God answers a prayer or whether he doesn't answer a prayer just to know that we're saved amen requires amen a response from us see so works is what you do for God then so God is telling them go do your works again it shows that if there's not a a a a joy to serve God if there's not a joy amen just to to come to the house of God and offer than it shows your back sliding praise the Lord amen that's right now notice he says now he says now young man young woman woman this morning or you old man or woman who's never been a Christian God's continually knocked at your heart oh yes now NOS why he says you might come in at the end of the road but you'll have no joy there will be no stars around you to shine he said I don't want to go like that I want to hear him say it was well done my good and faithful servant I want to show him my appreciation you understand what I'm saying that's why we win souls amen it's not to go go to heaven but to show our appreciation I got to tell somebody what he done for me amen see everything that we do is to show our appreciation he said see my poor little old gray-headed wife how I would love to do something for her that I know she likes because I love her I I know she loves me and if I do that for my wife in the human love what do I have to do to know that God by grace before the foundation of the world seen me a poor little sinner staggering and was going to hell and couldn't help it and he for ordained me and put my name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh I love him do you love him oh I love him I don't want nothing to come between me and and my love for him or my love in him see amen don't want nothing he said see there's no way at all for it to ever tell him of our love see amen no wonder the Bible says Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not Heard neither has it entered in the hearts of men oh my how glorious God is don't you want to trust him if you're weary and tossed about shame on you Christians that call yourself Christians and go around so weary well I don't know if I go to the church well oh you're a poor excuse let me tell you lift up your head straighten up your chest oh my use faith faith is the boss that's right faith has hairs on his chest brother I mean it's gotten big muscles and and when it speaks all the worries drop from one side the other and the devil says now see now you just can't make it you can't do this and you're ashamed to testify that faith will raise up and say shut up I've got the floor amen amen see Faith takes the initiative see so this church should have been red hot they they should have been on fire amen but they they had left their first love and here God is saying go back and do your first works over go back and do your first Works can you say amen amen that's right see of course people don't do that today they don't have that Burly Faith because the prophet already said it faith is slow in these days can't trust God for anything hardly anymore amen some little thing goes on we just grip and fuss and and all of these things instead of saying God you're a way maker you're you're you're more than able and and if it's if it has to do with my brother I'm going to God bless my brother if it has to do with my sister if it has to do with the church if it has to do with whatever God just bless them abundantly I know you're more than able but we don't do that see now see so the faith is slow to where they can't trust God to take care of them all right they have more respect to what some unregenerated doctor has to say about the conditions then they then they do what God has to to say about things God's word says I am the god that Health all thy diseases that should be more than what a doctor would tell you well you're going to die oh you can't go around you got you know you got this and you got that and you got this if it came to God and it's going to take me away from worshiping God if it's going to take me away from the things of God I'll take God's word over over the doctor's word any day can you say Amen but what is it it takes a faith somebody's got to have a strong faith and stand there and say devil put whatever you want on me but God's already said no weapon formed against me is going to prosper can you say Amen Psalms 56:4 it says in God will I will praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me Psalms 1186 the Lord is on my I will not fear what can man do unto me and I'll say it this way what can the the diseases of this world do unto me what can the germs in this world do unto me what can Satan do unto me he can't do nothing for the Lord is on my side how many's got the faith enough to believe that the Lord is on your side see Hebrews 13 and5 let your convers ation be without covet us be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee amen that's a promise can you say amen he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my help helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me so now it was a backsliding age that first age amen and and the summary of that age was fruits without love and it led to apostasy ain't that right so God addresses the age and rebukes it and it looks like he's rebuking the whole church but he's not amen then after he rebukes it then he looks and says but he that overcomes he that overcomes everybody say he that overcomes see amen see he now he's going to address the elect amen he that overcometh amen there's rewards for them that overcome can you say Amen there's always been Overcomers down through the age now the Overcomer is the individual it's not the entire group amen he he that overcome the the in individual see brother Braham said see it shows that it's not the church body that overcomes or it would have said she that overcometh church represents woman ain't that right but he that overcome the individual every one of us as individuals I got to have our walk with God and got to overcome this isn't a group thing that's the thing we want to identify with groups clubs join everybody wants to join something cuz nobody wants to stand out but if you're going to overcome you it's an individual thing amen and you say Amen brother Braham said the individual that overcomes is the bride coming out amen see the age it's not the age that overcomes it's the individual that elect see so so now there there are Overcomers and they are a few that have not defiled their garments can you say Amen brother brand said we used to have a saying years ago keep your skirts clean see it meant don't get involved in questionable things now listen now this is the Overcomer amen we're not worried about what people of the age does we're talking to that Overcomer amen you got to keep your garments undefiled ain't that right keep your skirt clean see don't get involved in questionable things others will be involved and you might be tempted to be involved or somebody might try to involve you but stay clear of it all by steering a course away from it hello now that's that that that's where all of us now all the way down here to this layot of sea and age Amen to that overcomer keep your garments undefiled stay away from the questionable things things that would entice you things well brother Bram called it enticing Spirits so see now in order to overcome in order to keep your garment undefiled you're going to have to have your own convictions amen about things now conviction means a strong persuasion or belief the state of being con vinced I am convinced just like like I am convinced that this message is right that's my conviction amen you don't have to have that conviction but that's my conviction and by that conviction I'll overcome Lord right see so so I I it's a strong persuasion or belief the statement of being convinced the act of convincing a person of error or compelling the admission of a truth so see if you're going to overcome you're going to have to have convictions amen you love him amen you cannot go by somebody else's convictions just like my children they're growing up now they lived under by my convictions but now they're they're they're marrying getting out out on their own now they've got to have their own convictions cuz trust me the devil's going to try to defile their garments just as much as he's tried to defile ours see you you you cannot stand against the Devil by what I believe the only way you'll be able to stand against that Devil Is by your own convictions you understand what I'm saying he that overcometh you know I often I prayed to God God bring give me convictions don't ever let me lose my convictions ain't that right if I don't have convictions that I ain't going to stand for nothing and if I don't stand for something I'm going to fall for anything that's right ain't that right see so you cannot stand for Christ and Bible standards by what someone else's believes it's what you personally believe to be the truth and if you don't know the truth about something it's up to you to search it out ask see seek yeah knock can you say Amen now this is the time that you got to have convictions yeah praise the Lord that's right now the word of God is truth amen so you know there there are a lot of people that have convictions but their convictions don't line up with the Bible and the and the message it's fine to have convictions it's fine but we we want convictions to line up with the God's word amen and the message can you say Amen it's just like this and this is just something very simple and something that I wanted just to put out there you know there are people who have that have convictions about a woman's sleeve length they think it should be such such long and certain certain length and certain this and certain that someone asked me a while back do you preach on on sleeve lengths for a woman I I said well I don't guess I have well you should now wasn't anyone that goes to our church so they started talking about other churches that don't do that and pastors that don't do them things but you know it it was funniest thing because I I uh wasn't even it I just blew it off you know I mean you know I I figured if God deals with me to do it I'll do it but at one day I was studying uh uh a while back uh a after this that that we had the conversation and and and I saw this someone asked the prophet what link should a woman's sleeve be and he says now I don't think that is anything about that I I don't know what I can't back up with the Bible I don't want to say much about it the lengths of sleeves I think being a Christian God would tell you what to do about those things see I believe as a Christian person you you would know about how to do that I don't think God Cuts any certain links or whatever it is as long as you're decent and look honorable and clean can you say amen he said I think that's all right now that's just my opinion now this is me cuz I can't back nothing else up with the scripture see so it it good conviction but our convictions must be based upon the Bible right and the message some some don't think that a woman should have a necklace I you know some was just telling me the other day that they don't believe in in women having necklaces and and all that and and actually went to a scripture to prove their point and I just sat there and listened yes sir yeah I yeah and you know that's fine but when asked if a Christian woman should wear a necklace brother Braham said now this is me not the Lord if you had a pen that you wanted to wear or a little necklace your husband give you maybe you know something like that that you wore now to me I don't think that's bad see now that's just me I make myself clear that's my opinion but I think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it it's the motive behind it you understand what I'm saying see it's the spirit what's motivating you to do those things but anything what what's a woman can have long hair and have pride about it and it's just as wrong as as anything else he said see and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone see if it's getting a hold of you then leave it alone if that's something you're struggling with and it's becoming a pride issue and it's becoming a vanity issue and you see that a spirit is motivating it leave it alone now I'm not to judge that or whatever don't try to make everybody else do it because here's what a prophet is saying you understand what I'm saying he said now I know you Nazarene people it used to be that you wouldn't even AP ize a woman with a wedding ring on what convictions see I don't believe that as necessary in the Bible they wore wedding rings only it was a tablet they called it around their head nine pieces of coin in it but to show that they were married I think that's all right if if women want to dress and make themselves look decent and clean ladylike well I think there's not a thing to that to me see but when you get to go to put that thing into making it a little pride then you're wrong see it's your attitude see do you he said do you women I know this a little lengthy but I hope it helps do you women remember here not long ago that they that they had what they called Scandal skirts I think they're coming out again and they they or or they got worse see they're scandalous now instead you know Scandal but they they used to have a playback not long ago they they had the girls young women of course the old ones do it would do it too because they they all want to be young he I don't mean you sisters I mean the women of the world they'd cut their skirt up high about a foot high every time and then wear some kind of underneath garment to look pretty see well and when they would make a step it would show this underneath garment with the lace and Frills or whatever it was on it see and and and I want to set this our message girls are doing this too you know is is they wear these leg leggings pant leggings and then they're raising their skirts up I think that is just as wrong as anything else hello it's true couple girls a few years ago when skiing they had a little mini skirts on and then but that seemed to be okay because they had their leggings now it's wrong got to have some convictions not everything that the world world says is right is right for you can you say Amen okay some of you did see so there was a girl come to me which was a dunker girl had just received the Holy Ghost she belonged to the assembly of the god that was in Fort Wayne Indiana where I was married and when she come to me a little fine lady she said brother brandom I want to ask you a question I said all right sister what is it she said do you think it's wrong for a girl a Christian girl to wear a scandal skirt and I said sisters this is one thing I just can't understand what is a scandal skirt and she told me what it was and she said it shows the underskirt I said what is in a woman that would want uh would make her to want her to show her underneath clothes to some man that's right you understand what I'm saying so he's not talking about a woman showing her thighs he's talking about a woman showing her underneath garments what is in a woman that would make her want to show her underneath clothes to some men what business has a Christian girl got doing a thing like that he said could you imagine a Christian he said now look a man there's not much to him when it comes to a body if he went half naked there wouldn't be no Scandal to it not holding for for men he said but you know uh uh what kind of a woman would be tempted by a man with his shirt off and shorts on or whatever he had the big old Burly looking thing looks sloppy and sickly see horrible and and these men out here well I think that it' make a woman uh vomit to look at such a thing see he says but now you take a woman and put her like that that's a different tiple but here is the age that we're living in they want to make it to where there's no difference men and women are equal no they're not can you say Amen they're not equal amen he said see so so he said but you take a woman and put her like that that's a different tiple he said you understand but now I think as far as a necklace now if you go to loading yourself up like you went through a 10 cent store down here with a magnet on you he said well he said excuse that I didn't mean to say it like that but that's wrong amen can you say Amen see so then we we must have Bible convictions convictions see and and and our convictions is the doctrine that we live by that's why we don't get convictions by Creed we don't get our convictions by denomination or a Dogma or whatever they've got to be Bible convictions that's why God would send us a prophet to put balance to it that's right can you say Amen see and and that is the doctrine by which we live every every one of you mothers should have a Doctrine convictions on how to raise your your your your children every one of you wives should have convictions on how to to to uh live amen toward your husband in your marriage every one of you fight should have convictions on how to lead your children and your family amen and and how to be a husband to your wife and we should have convictions on how we come to the house of God Amen can you say Amen yes sir see we must have Bible convictions see and and them convictions be our Doctrine because see Doctrine is the backbone of the church that word backbone it's the main support see the major sustaining Factor the foundation or most substantial or sturdiest part of something see so now brother brandham had talked to a boy who had went down a wrong path of life and got into some trouble and he was he was now dying of a veneral disease and things and brother Bram said aren't you ashamed of yourself aren't you Ash ashamed of yourself your mother was a Christian mother what happened and and and the boy explained he said I just got out said see the first cigarette I smoked and some of the boys told me said just be smart and then the girls began to tease me see and I started smoking he did not have conviction of his own his mother was a Christian she wouldn't have done them things but he needed them convictions yeah he said I started you know he said I didn't mean to become that way and I started drinking I didn't mean to just to show a sociable drink and a glass of beer and just one thing left led to another and brother Bram said that's the way it is shun everybody say shun the appearance of evil have this first thing in front of you and when it's evil say no can you say amen he said need to say that no when it comes to your phone no when it comes to looking at pornography no I am a Son of God when it comes to spending your time and wasting your time on on all this entertainment say no I am a Son of God prise the Lord that's right got to have convictions amen see he says see need to say that no that settles it see don't have a wishbone have a backbone like that stand out when you know you're right if you believe in God if you're born again you will do it that's right there's no question about that if you're born again it'll take care of itself can you say amen I understand we we fall we come up short but I I I'm talking about staying in that hell hole staying down the devil got you one trick get up amen amen we should be striving daily to get closer to the Lord see so we're living in a Le oysan age and I'm going to try to wrap it up real soon from what I read in the Bible the Le oysan Church age is the only age that is considered by God to be a lukewarm age it's the last age brother Bram said it's the most dangerous age Paul would say in 2 Timothy 3:1 know this this know also that in the last times perilous time shall come and the word perilous means dangerous to to lower as into a void difficult meaning the idea of reducing the strength now you think of that dangerous times were going to come perilous times because people's strength will be reduced right amen that's right can you say man now watch he goes on in the second verse for men shall be lovers of their own PL of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good traitor he high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and having a for of godliness having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away can you say man now it's not hard for us to see that this is being fulfilled in this day that we're living in people are doing things saying things acting in any old way doing things that is absolutely against God a contrary to God and yet they have a form of godliness that's right it's the age lukewarm amen can't you can't you just now Church you all know where I'm at you know what I'm talking about on people's let down so much in their own lives I said you know brother Braham said faith will be slow now brother Braham said this is the age of hypocrisy lukewarm hypocrisy yeah because it's it's a state of having a foot in the world and the foot in church it's a baeling it's it's it's a it's a place now you know brother Brown said the Holy Spirit had nothing kind to say about this Le oan age you said this age is the worst bunch of them all ain't that right he said all the rest of the Ages were under torments and everything they had they had nothing they was poverty stricken wandered about in sheep skin and goat skins and destitute and sold and burned to death and fed to lions and everything else and still held the faith and this bunch is Rich and they have need of nothing and everything else and a prostitute because it's a lukewarm age people don't trust God anymore to supply their needs they're looking to politicians to do it hello and I'm going to tell you both both both candidates are just as Heathen as Heathen can get when you got a man up there talking filth before all the people just like he did the other day I mean just a perver just filth and then you got preachers praying for him oh God bless him oh God he's the he's the one that's going to get return us back to our ways ways no God sent a prophet to return us back and they rejected that Prophet can you say Amen I'm I'm just saying it but we'll go so far because we want life easy for us we want things just right and he's promised it to us what about God's promises and God doesn't have to talk filth and talk dirty and and and and act like a act like a Christian to get you your vote he's just he's righteous he's gone all out to save you he's gone out to prove that he's the god that you need he'll Supply your every need he'll heal all your diseases he can create when there's nothing there believe it am I remember a man by the name of shouey I believe it was I believe it was him or uh maybe it was M brother McDonald and but he was an older man and talk about how that they they were poures into Times of depression and didn't have food and he was walking somewhere at think to preach or whatever but he was hungry and he didn't know what he was going to do but he was starving and there he was walking on that trail and he said he just got to pray and Lord You're the god that you're the god that supplies the needs Lord I'm trusting you you know what what I'm needing you know I'm hungry all that I I just need some food if you just Supply it he said Lord I just thank you for for hearing my prayer and as he began to walk he walked I don't know how long he how how much more time he walked but he looked and right on that pathway was was a sack and he opened that sack and it was a hot hot meal looked around nobody was around and he ate it God provided can he do do that again sure he can church is coming to a place that we're going to have to trust God that's right amen can you say Amen not depend upon the technology not depend upon the medical and not depend on everything else we got to depend upon the source of it all God that's God but this is a lukewarm age a you know and and and so uh lukewarm is mildly warm lacking conviction or enthusiasm as Webster would say uh lacking conviction or enthusiasm indifferent half-hearted see and and and so then then if that be the case then it shows there's not going to be too many Overcomers in this age now there are going to be Overcomers and them Overcomers are going to be that elect but not too many are cuz they're fighting a war lukewarm where no convictions there's nothing there people standing for truth right they want to fit in they don't want to hurt they don't want to offend they get more mad at the preacher than they do the senator they get more mad at the church than they do the ungodliness out there brother Braham said there'll be just very very few in that in in that Rapture that'll be changed can you say Amen you love the Lord amen so since the first chch AG Jesus has been steadily been pushed out pushed aside until in this last age he has pushed outside the church can you say Amen Darkness crept in the first stage it used to be it would have been a whole whole as the prophet would call it an orbit an orbit Church full of truth but there was a little bit of darkness in it called the nickon and by the next stage more darkness seeped in and by the next stage more darkness seeped in until we're now till now it's it's it's we're so far away can you say Amen now we're living in an age where people just have a form of godliness but they don't have the life don't have an experience aren't hot for God aren't aren't on fire they're professing to be Christian professing to go to heaven doing religious things it used to be just wrong amen for Christians to smoke now they now they don't care they'll do it on a church parking lot used to be just Plum wrong to steal now they'll steal from the house of God they don't care doing religious things having a form of godliness Yet brother Brams would say it's in this last age that we find the blackout of the word the complete apostasy ending in the Great Tribulation see so so they've got the form but they denied the power of the word the Dynamics the token see and what causes the word to be blacked out the invasion of error and now the people sits in lukewarmness and brother Braham said what are they lukewarm to what lukewarm to what the word they're lukewarm to the word he said what what is wrong with these people of the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it can you say amen and they go into complete deception deception can you say Amen if the musicians will come lukewarm to where there's no rugged faith that brother Bram talked about people don't stand for anything anymore if they do stand it's off it's wacko stuff they'll stand for a Creed they'll stand for something that they don't like or the something like that but when it just comes to the balance of the word they can't stand they're Christian by name but lack conviction about the word wishy-washy goes with however the wind goes goes with what they're feeling at the time like you today hate you tomorrow just blending in with the world and don't see the need to live by the word they don't see the the need for Holiness you know it's true sisters blouses and I'm not talking about this church but sisters blouses are be getting lower and lower used to be a shame for Holiness people women to show their cleavage they don't think nothing of it anymore it's a shame used to be a shame to wear tight dresses tight hello short skirts used to be as shame now everybody wants to get ass short as they can without getting preached to then they get preached that they get mad used to be asham but see we're in a Le Osa age God help us to keep our convictions can you say Amen brother brandham said if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God you believe it Hallelujah I love the Lord amen I love the Lord we could go on appreciate your patience amen but oh help us to overcome Church do not get settled in this leoan age don't become part of it we preach about being the bride age and we are I I believe that I believe that's where that elect is brother brand of course we're living in Le otsy and age brother Bram is showing a difference that we're not part of that leodys and age he's he's showing us a contrast there are still a people that believes in Holiness and they're balanced with it there's still a people that believe in godliness and they're balanced with it there's a people that still believes in the nine spiritual gifts and they're balanced with it there's people that still believe in a Pentecostal experience and they're balanced with it it it's a bride that God is promised to pull out he that overcometh he that overcometh can you say Amen oh God help us God bless you is our prayer what's it this is the evening [Music] time it's later than you [Music] [Music] think all things are ready ready [Music] now the bridegroom I hear oh yes yes yes he that hath an ear to hear the evening
