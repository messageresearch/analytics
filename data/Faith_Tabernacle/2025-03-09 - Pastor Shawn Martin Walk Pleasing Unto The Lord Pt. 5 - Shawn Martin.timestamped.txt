[1:14:25] and and

[1:14:31] first two
[1:14:33] verses Ephesians chapter 5 says be
[1:14:38] therefore followers of God as dear
[1:14:40] children and walk in love as Christ also
[1:14:43] hath loved us and hath given himself for
[1:14:46] us an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:14:50] for a sweet smelling
[1:14:52] Savor amen may we just bow our heads in
[1:14:56] a word of prayer
[1:15:00] father it's just good to be able to have
[1:15:05] an understanding that you are
[1:15:07] God when the world is denying you
[1:15:11] denying the
[1:15:13] power of
[1:15:15] godliness Lord you have revealed
[1:15:18] yourself to us
[1:15:21] and we're believing in you Lord Lord and
[1:15:25] no matter what we go through no matter
[1:15:28] the trials and circumstances we're at
[1:15:32] rest knowing that you're God and that
[1:15:35] there's nothing Lord that can Dethrone
[1:15:39] you there's nothing that could hinder
[1:15:41] you and father therefore we know that we
[1:15:45] will make it we're we're
[1:15:48] Victorious and now we just ask Lord that
[1:15:51] you would come Among Us this morning and
[1:15:55] that you would um just speak to every
[1:15:58] heart here father you see
[1:16:02] the subject that we would have what's on
[1:16:05] our heart Lord and pray that you would
[1:16:07] help me just to convey that and Lord
[1:16:11] that it would be planted in our hearts
[1:16:13] that we could leave this place more like
[1:16:16] you we ask it father pray that you would
[1:16:19] forgive us of all of our sins our
[1:16:22] failures Lord and we just humbly now
[1:16:25] just yield ourselves to you in Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ's name
[1:16:30] amen you can be seated this morning and
[1:16:35] um we had a uh a good time in in Arizona
[1:16:40] and appreciate your prayers and
[1:16:44] uh uh believing the the people were
[1:16:49] helped and and edified and and so uh we
[1:16:55] that's that's our heart's desire is to
[1:16:58] help Help the People wherever we go amen
[1:17:03] and um so here I'm going to use the
[1:17:07] title again walk walk pleasing unto
[1:17:10] him and um it just going to be a simple
[1:17:15] subject and um uh but it's something
[1:17:18] that is on my heart so I I pray that
[1:17:21] it'll be a blessing to you in in some
[1:17:23] way uh but um we uh you know uh I I
[1:17:30] think and and of course I think the
[1:17:33] Bible would back it up the message but I
[1:17:37] think the way we we live should be
[1:17:40] pleasing unto God I I think the way we
[1:17:44] talk should be pleasing unto God I I
[1:17:48] think the way we uh think and allow what
[1:17:53] we meditate upon it should be pleasing
[1:17:56] unto our
[1:17:57] Lord uh what we listen to uh should be
[1:18:02] pleasing unto the Lord I I think we
[1:18:04] shouldn't just listen to
[1:18:07] anything um
[1:18:09] um but uh and and when I say that it it
[1:18:12] could be in music it could be in in just
[1:18:17] uh any kind of preaching it it it could
[1:18:20] be gossip it could just it could be
[1:18:23] anything could be just jokes uh you know
[1:18:28] someone telling a joke and if it's a
[1:18:30] dirty joke or unclean we shouldn't
[1:18:32] listen to that but but everything that
[1:18:35] we should do uh do we should walk
[1:18:39] pleasing unto the Lord our marriage
[1:18:42] should be pleasing unto the Lord uh what
[1:18:45] we do on the job it should be pleasing
[1:18:47] unto the Lord um but but also every one
[1:18:51] of us have a
[1:18:52] Ministry um whe whe whether you believe
[1:18:56] that or not and and it's sometimes it's
[1:18:58] hard to really believe and fathom that
[1:19:01] we've got a Ministry and a lot of times
[1:19:04] Satan is good at uh at building
[1:19:07] complexes and um um hang on just a
[1:19:12] moment I'm wired up and got stuck praise
[1:19:15] the Lord amen but uh every one of us uh
[1:19:20] uh we have a Ministry and I think it
[1:19:24] like brother brandom said we should all
[1:19:26] uh it pays us to go uh to the Lord and
[1:19:30] and uh ask him what he would want us to
[1:19:34] do and um um and it may be something
[1:19:38] very small it may seem something
[1:19:40] insignificant and maybe maybe Satan is
[1:19:42] good at at putting that as insignificant
[1:19:46] to us as though we're really nothing and
[1:19:49] it's really nothing special but you have
[1:19:51] a Ministry and the prophet said no one
[1:19:53] can take your place
[1:19:55] so then we we should in our ministry we
[1:19:58] should be pleasing our ministry should
[1:20:00] be pleasing unto the Lord and um and so
[1:20:05] I I believe that as we mature in the
[1:20:08] Lord then our ministry
[1:20:12] matures uh as well and we know uh that
[1:20:16] this is the age of maturing this is the
[1:20:19] time for the manifestation of sons of
[1:20:21] God and that couldn't happen when we
[1:20:24] were children it couldn't happen when in
[1:20:27] in the other ages uh but in order for
[1:20:31] the maturity to take place the
[1:20:32] Pentecostal shuck had to pull away it it
[1:20:36] had to pull away as you know brother
[1:20:38] brandham speaks of that in uh the seed
[1:20:41] shall not be air with the shuck and and
[1:20:43] other places of course but but it had to
[1:20:46] pull away uh before maturity could come
[1:20:50] and and I believe it has pulled away
[1:20:53] that's where we're at I believe it has
[1:20:55] pulled away and that's why we're seeing
[1:20:57] a lot of people walk away from the
[1:20:59] message um is is because it's it's just
[1:21:03] drying up uh the shuck uh and and
[1:21:07] Pentecostal thought Pentecostal thinking
[1:21:10] U traditions and and doctrines and ways
[1:21:14] and all these things that were man-made
[1:21:16] all these things are just pulling away
[1:21:18] and drying up I believe we're at the
[1:21:21] place that we are maturing by laying in
[1:21:24] the Pres presence of the Sun and this is
[1:21:26] where we're at uh this is why there's
[1:21:28] nothing that appeals to us outside the
[1:21:30] message of the hour this is why the
[1:21:33] message is so dear to us and and and we
[1:21:37] we we would rather listen to a me the
[1:21:41] message than we would you know Dr doson
[1:21:43] or uh we would rather get answers from
[1:21:46] the message than we would a psychologist
[1:21:48] or uh some some
[1:21:51] denominational uh thing is because we're
[1:21:54] we're we're ripening the message is
[1:21:57] helping us to ripen and and we're we're
[1:22:00] taking we're we're we're we're building
[1:22:03] our lives by it we're we're molding our
[1:22:06] marriages after it we're molding our
[1:22:08] homes our families our churches
[1:22:11] everything after uh uh the message of
[1:22:15] the hour and and so and and by that our
[1:22:20] our behavior is maturing our thinking is
[1:22:24] mat maturing our faith is maturing our
[1:22:27] attitude is maturing our understanding
[1:22:31] of the word is maturing amen we're not
[1:22:35] standing in in a mass confusion like we
[1:22:38] used to uh because we have answers and
[1:22:41] and the prophet would tell us we have
[1:22:43] the answer to the devil's question amen
[1:22:47] but but we're maturing in these things
[1:22:49] and and the character of Christ is fully
[1:22:54] full
[1:22:55] developing uh within us as
[1:22:59] Believers I you know I I I pray that
[1:23:01] everyone here this morning has a desire
[1:23:05] to walk pleasing unto the Lord uh uh
[1:23:09] Christians every true Christian desires
[1:23:11] to please him I mean uh uh that's
[1:23:23] that's do
[1:23:25] uh it's in other words it's not you know
[1:23:27] as i' I've said before it's not like you
[1:23:29] know uh the the the carrot before the
[1:23:32] horse you know and and horse or donkey
[1:23:36] or whatever he's chasing that carrot all
[1:23:38] day long and they got that carrot to get
[1:23:40] him to moveing you know uh uh but but
[1:23:43] this is something that we can acquire
[1:23:45] we're it's not the promises before us
[1:23:48] and we're not able to obtain but this is
[1:23:51] something as Believers we're able to OB
[1:23:54] Ain uh maybe you know years ago we
[1:23:58] thought that it may not be it wasn't
[1:24:01] possible but we're looking at it and
[1:24:03] we're understanding that it is possible
[1:24:05] it is it is possible to please the Lord
[1:24:08] through maturing amen uh through
[1:24:12] maturity and so only only a Christian
[1:24:16] can walk pleasing unto the Lord only a
[1:24:18] Christian a true genuine Christian can
[1:24:22] walk pleasing amen to to try to please
[1:24:26] the Lord without being a Christian would
[1:24:29] be impossible to do uh when we think of
[1:24:32] Christian the life of a Christian and
[1:24:35] and you just bear with me but the life
[1:24:38] of a Christian is a is a direct result
[1:24:42] of the work of
[1:24:44] redemption uh so it's not something that
[1:24:47] okay I'm I'm going to be a Christian so
[1:24:49] I'm going to go to church or I'm going
[1:24:50] to be a Christian so I'm going to start
[1:24:52] living holy and and a Holiness life and
[1:24:56] or I'm going to be a Christian whatever
[1:24:58] but the life of a Christian is a direct
[1:25:01] result of the work of redemption so you
[1:25:05] don't become a Christian simply by Good
[1:25:07] Will or by joining a church or uh uh you
[1:25:11] know and and therefore we understand
[1:25:15] that uh if you're not in God's thinking
[1:25:19] you you can't be a Christian um and
[1:25:23] that's just the way it is um you you had
[1:25:26] to be in God's thinking brother brandom
[1:25:29] said a Christian is God's thoughts of
[1:25:32] today that he had before the foundation
[1:25:35] of the world so you didn't just start
[1:25:38] being a Christian by desires you was a
[1:25:42] Christian by God's Desire by what God
[1:25:46] saw of you before the foundation of the
[1:25:49] world your beginning as a Christian
[1:25:52] started in the mind of God not at an
[1:25:55] altar amen it it it started as the
[1:25:59] thoughts of God and so uh a a Christian
[1:26:03] is an attribute of God's thinking
[1:26:06] expressed in this day for this day
[1:26:11] that's what a Christian is now we were
[1:26:13] all born as the prophet would say with a
[1:26:16] fallen nature a fallen character he says
[1:26:20] our character was a dying character see
[1:26:23] but in in God but God in love he says
[1:26:27] projected a character without sin he
[1:26:31] projected one without sin and and
[1:26:35] another place he says God's great nature
[1:26:39] projected Jesus Christ ain't that right
[1:26:42] amen his great nature projected Jesus
[1:26:46] Christ another place he said he was so
[1:26:48] perfect with the father uh Christ he was
[1:26:52] so perfect with the father just a body
[1:26:55] that was here called the son that the
[1:26:58] word was him so so God was able to
[1:27:02] project a character that was a sinless
[1:27:05] nature he was able to project a person
[1:27:08] here we are uh born in sin shap it in
[1:27:11] iniquity no hope we were dying and we
[1:27:15] were as as you know the boy that had a
[1:27:18] bunch of birds you know um uh you know
[1:27:22] in a cage or some birds that a cage and
[1:27:25] someone asked you know a man asked him
[1:27:27] what are you going to do with them Birds
[1:27:28] I'm just going to play with them you
[1:27:30] know and and and he said well well you
[1:27:33] know you're going to play with them yeah
[1:27:34] yeah and he said yeah I was able to uh
[1:27:38] uh snare them and and I'm just going to
[1:27:40] play with him then what are you going to
[1:27:41] do with them I'm going to kill them you
[1:27:43] know and and uh uh and so that was the
[1:27:47] intent you know and I thought well
[1:27:48] that's that's a lot of how we were you
[1:27:51] know is is we were snared by the the
[1:27:53] devil and and and all he wanted to do is
[1:27:57] just use us and abuse us and he didn't
[1:28:00] see value in our life and and his intent
[1:28:03] was to destroy us but Jesus come one day
[1:28:06] and and said I I'll I'll I'll pay a
[1:28:08] price for him and and he saw the value
[1:28:11] in it and you know Satan oh you ain't
[1:28:14] going to want them oh yeah I do want
[1:28:15] them and and I don't want you to give
[1:28:18] them to me I'm going to pay for him and
[1:28:20] and so this was the love of God that
[1:28:24] would take uh uh be able to to produce a
[1:28:28] character that would take us from being
[1:28:30] a sinner to a saint that would take us
[1:28:33] from being in in a trapped in a cage to
[1:28:36] letting us be free can you say amen and
[1:28:40] so this was this was Christ um 1 John
[1:28:44] 3:8 we've read it before but just
[1:28:46] breaking in here it says for this
[1:28:48] purpose the Son of God was manifested
[1:28:51] what was the purpose of Christ being
[1:28:53] manifested ested to destroy the works of
[1:28:57] the devil can you say Amen can you say
[1:29:00] that with me to destroy the works of the
[1:29:03] devil that was the purpose of Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ being made manifest it was the
[1:29:09] purpose of his ministry was to destroy
[1:29:13] the works of the devil it's just like
[1:29:15] the the the the creeper that brother
[1:29:18] Braham talks about you know the man uh
[1:29:21] uh he plants his garden and if he
[1:29:24] doesn't take care of the garden a
[1:29:26] creeper will will grow in there and and
[1:29:30] and he will that that creeper will wrap
[1:29:32] itself around that corn that stock of
[1:29:35] corn and and and it will actually begin
[1:29:39] to pull that stock of corn uh you know
[1:29:43] instead of it being straight like it
[1:29:45] should be it'll start perverting it and
[1:29:47] and pulling it down and deforming it see
[1:29:51] and so in in order to to release that
[1:29:55] stock of corn to bring it back up that
[1:29:58] that farmer has to go in there with a a
[1:30:00] tool a a hole and and and break the
[1:30:04] power of that creeper and get it out of
[1:30:07] that garden and and so that the that
[1:30:10] that the the stock of corn can can come
[1:30:13] back up and be what it's meant to be
[1:30:15] ain't that right so this is Jesus he
[1:30:18] came to destroy the works of of the
[1:30:22] devil that creeper that had entwined
[1:30:25] itself around your life and so he wasn't
[1:30:29] here just to mingle with people he he
[1:30:32] wasn't here just uh to receive accolades
[1:30:36] from people and ooh and awe and and and
[1:30:39] all of these things he wasn't here just
[1:30:41] to preach and and to sing and to you
[1:30:45] know have healing campaigns and all this
[1:30:48] he was sent to destroy the works of the
[1:30:51] devil can you say amen and you wouldn't
[1:30:54] be here today I wouldn't be here today
[1:30:57] if that was if that wasn't the case amen
[1:31:00] we can truly say that the works of the
[1:31:03] devil has been destroyed in our lives
[1:31:07] and we know that we we've experienc that
[1:31:10] we can truly say he's nothing but a
[1:31:13] bluff how many believes that he's
[1:31:15] nothing but a bluff amen that's right
[1:31:19] and and so uh um uh he was sent to this
[1:31:23] destroy the works of the devil and yet
[1:31:26] this could not be done without Divine
[1:31:29] love amen uh uh the prophet said love is
[1:31:33] the greatest force uh another place he
[1:31:36] said love is the greatest weapon that
[1:31:39] God ever put into the hands of man amen
[1:31:43] and and you know what good is is is a
[1:31:46] Ministry without love what good is is is
[1:31:51] a gift without love what what good is
[1:31:54] our testifying amen what what good does
[1:31:57] it do without love and so uh you know
[1:32:00] and and I hope I ain't too scattered
[1:32:02] this morning but hopefully I can relay
[1:32:05] what I I feel uh but brother brandom
[1:32:08] says if I had the choice tonight and was
[1:32:11] a sinner and was standing here before
[1:32:13] God and and he said you know now boy I
[1:32:17] I'm going to give you all nine spiritual
[1:32:19] gifts I'm going to let you prophesy give
[1:32:21] you the spirit of Prophecy I'm going to
[1:32:23] make make you a mighty preacher give you
[1:32:25] the word of wisdom and understanding I'm
[1:32:28] going to give you the gift to speak in
[1:32:29] tongues and to interpret I'm going to
[1:32:32] give you a gift of healing that you'll
[1:32:34] have great faith for the sick I'm going
[1:32:36] to do all these things for you I'll give
[1:32:38] you all of that uh or I won't let you
[1:32:40] have any of those things but let you
[1:32:43] have real love in your heart he says I'd
[1:32:45] say God give me love ain't that right
[1:32:49] you see it was love that brother Brown
[1:32:52] said it love is what drove the heart of
[1:32:55] God to send Christ to the Earth ain't
[1:32:58] that right so the ministry that Jesus
[1:33:01] was given and and and everything that he
[1:33:04] he he was able to do it it was all
[1:33:08] inspired by love amen God so loved ain't
[1:33:12] that right and so there's nothing more
[1:33:15] powerful than than love I I I thought
[1:33:18] brother brandham here tell talking about
[1:33:20] a a man that had come to him that was
[1:33:23] was a Pentecostal brother and U he says
[1:33:27] he had seen too many of of these
[1:33:29] meetings and he goes in and his wife is
[1:33:32] a staunch Lutheran and she said well I
[1:33:34] guess you all went down and shouted last
[1:33:36] night and guess you all you know you was
[1:33:39] all speaking in tongues and doing all
[1:33:42] this last night and he got out on the
[1:33:45] floor and he said God I cast The Devil
[1:33:47] out of her you know now he casting the
[1:33:51] devil out of his wife see and and and he
[1:33:54] said um uh I cast The Devil out of her
[1:33:57] almost a divorce case you know and and
[1:34:01] he says a fine man and he come to me and
[1:34:04] he said brother brandom we're going to
[1:34:05] have a divorce I guess and I said you
[1:34:08] know he said I just can't get that devil
[1:34:11] to move out of her I said brother you're
[1:34:13] going at it the wrong way I said you
[1:34:16] know when she starts uh like that just
[1:34:19] say all right dear bless your heart
[1:34:21] honey and be real kind to her see just
[1:34:24] see how much you can do for her he said
[1:34:27] well brother Brandon well how will I
[1:34:29] ever get the devil out of her and I said
[1:34:32] you do as I say and just keep praying in
[1:34:34] your heart see and I said God will take
[1:34:37] care of the rest of it he called me up
[1:34:39] about two weeks two or three weeks later
[1:34:41] and he said my home's revolutionized and
[1:34:44] he said my wife's a different person and
[1:34:47] I said well which is the most powerful
[1:34:49] screaming and kicking and stomping or
[1:34:52] just putting your arms around in love
[1:34:54] see so Jesus was sent to destroy the
[1:34:58] works of the devil but his ministry
[1:35:01] would have done no good if it had not
[1:35:03] love it it wouldn't have helped to to be
[1:35:07] to to to testify of the father it
[1:35:11] without love it it wouldn't have done no
[1:35:12] good all the healing campaigns and
[1:35:14] everything that he' done well see we are
[1:35:17] sent for the same purpose how many
[1:35:19] believes that and I I get it that that
[1:35:22] yeah they they cre crucified him and and
[1:35:25] and and he he he you know he he didn't
[1:35:28] get everybody but he was after that
[1:35:30] elect amen he he was after that elect
[1:35:33] but there was such love for human
[1:35:35] Humanity do you believe that so we're
[1:35:38] we're sent for the same purpose so so
[1:35:41] for you ministers all of us as ministers
[1:35:44] our preaching isn't to make more room
[1:35:47] for for the devil to work in the lives
[1:35:49] of people our our our ministry uh uh you
[1:35:54] know uh our life isn't as for all of us
[1:35:57] our life isn't to be lived in a way that
[1:36:00] would allow the devil to bring more
[1:36:03] confusion to people um you know
[1:36:07] sometimes you hear people talking of the
[1:36:09] Lord and and then you you you know at
[1:36:11] least I used to uh I think well you know
[1:36:15] I you know you see the boxers beating
[1:36:18] one another and blood running out of
[1:36:19] their ears and nose and all that and
[1:36:21] then the winter afterwards say I just
[1:36:23] want to say I thank the Lord God Bless
[1:36:26] America you know and you're thinking
[1:36:28] well how how does that work you know and
[1:36:31] or you hear country singers talking
[1:36:33] about you know tears in my beer and and
[1:36:36] all of these things and and but but
[1:36:38] they're Christians you know and it used
[1:36:40] to you know you think well how in the
[1:36:42] world did that work and or I'd see in
[1:36:45] church and and a lot of hypocrisy and
[1:36:48] things and you think well well how does
[1:36:50] that but but then you come into the
[1:36:52] message and you understand that there's
[1:36:54] an anointing that falls on the just the
[1:36:56] unjust and and and the anointing doesn't
[1:36:58] change what seed it is it just it grows
[1:37:01] they they both mature under the under
[1:37:04] the rain ain't that right but the rain
[1:37:06] doesn't change the uh the weed to the
[1:37:08] wheat it just helps it grow and and so
[1:37:12] we we understand those things now and
[1:37:15] and but yet as as Christians our life
[1:37:18] isn't to be like that our life isn't to
[1:37:21] be lived amen that would allow the the
[1:37:24] devil to bring more confusion and and
[1:37:27] and the same way with the preaching it
[1:37:29] it isn't to to bring more down you know
[1:37:32] to drive the people away from God and
[1:37:35] the realities of God and and all of
[1:37:38] these things and and that happens a a
[1:37:40] lot see we're not to bring a reproach uh
[1:37:43] to the gospel to where it causes people
[1:37:46] not to want to accept Christ if if we're
[1:37:50] on the job or if we're at the store or
[1:37:53] or if we're wherever we're at at school
[1:37:56] or whatever Our Lives um um as as as
[1:38:02] walking pleasing to
[1:38:05] God we we we want our lives that when
[1:38:09] people look at us whether they're
[1:38:11] ridiculing us or laughing and mocking us
[1:38:14] or uh not saying much to us we want such
[1:38:17] a life before them that that they know
[1:38:21] that there's something different about
[1:38:22] that individual you know that that it
[1:38:25] draws them to to want to be what to have
[1:38:29] what we have and and and to become you
[1:38:32] know what we are and and and and uh you
[1:38:36] understand I'm sure so the Bible says
[1:38:39] that God so loved the world God so loved
[1:38:43] the world now you know and and we talk
[1:38:46] that world the bride is going to be made
[1:38:48] up out of every nation tongue Kindred
[1:38:52] and people
[1:38:53] God so loved ain't that right that he
[1:38:57] gave his only begotten son for the
[1:39:00] purpose of not just preaching the gospel
[1:39:02] not just not just singing not just uh
[1:39:06] living a good life but sent his son that
[1:39:10] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:39:13] perish but shall have eternal life so
[1:39:17] God so loved the world that he did not
[1:39:20] want mankind to perish
[1:39:23] sh you believe that he so loved the
[1:39:28] world therefore he produced something so
[1:39:32] that the people would not perish he
[1:39:36] didn't just produce a good Ministry he
[1:39:38] didn't just send his son with a good
[1:39:41] talent to play my music or to to with a
[1:39:45] good personality that would draw people
[1:39:48] uh uh uh to him and there's been many
[1:39:51] good men uh before him and after him
[1:39:54] that have great personalities and men
[1:39:57] that that have that ability to speak and
[1:40:00] and and draw thousands of people that
[1:40:04] can be a political uh uh uh uh speaker
[1:40:08] as as we know the the mega movement
[1:40:11] would just you use that for an example
[1:40:13] how he's able to draw thousands to a
[1:40:16] crowd but that's not what God sent God
[1:40:19] God didn't send a man that just had
[1:40:21] ability to speak and through his speech
[1:40:24] he could draw people he sent his son
[1:40:27] that men may live
[1:40:30] eternally he that was the love that God
[1:40:33] had to the world that he wouldn't just
[1:40:36] send them a great speech maker he
[1:40:38] wouldn't just send them uh some some uh
[1:40:42] healer or or some businessman or or he
[1:40:46] sent him that the world would not perish
[1:40:51] and he and and the the son was sent
[1:40:54] because God so loved can you say amen
[1:40:58] and and and so uh uh his love uh uh
[1:41:02] produced Jesus Christ you know and and
[1:41:06] uh uh Christ is the only thing I've said
[1:41:09] it last time that we spoke here uh that
[1:41:12] that Christ is the only thing that
[1:41:14] Divine love will ever produce amen When
[1:41:18] Love is projected it produces Jesus
[1:41:21] Christ again amen
[1:41:23] it it it doesn't produce a a magician it
[1:41:27] it didn't produce a miracle worker in in
[1:41:30] in a sense of what we would call uh
[1:41:33] people call these things uh it didn't
[1:41:36] send and make a pope or a bishop he
[1:41:40] produced Jesus Christ the word made
[1:41:43] flesh a savior a redeemer someone that
[1:41:46] was able to help man and destroy the
[1:41:50] works of the devil it it did not produce
[1:41:52] a denomination or a scholar it did not
[1:41:55] produce a a a psychologist and and and
[1:41:59] and if it didn't produce psychology back
[1:42:01] then it won't do it today amen it it
[1:42:04] just won't it will only produce the
[1:42:07] person of Jesus Christ and he is the
[1:42:09] word made flesh do you believe that
[1:42:12] that's the Divine love that's true
[1:42:14] divine love true love that's what it'll
[1:42:18] produce is the person of Jesus
[1:42:22] Christ and and so God saw what Satan had
[1:42:25] done to his children and because he
[1:42:27] loved them he sought to rescue them he
[1:42:31] sought to redeem them he sought to
[1:42:33] purchase them and loose them from
[1:42:36] Satan's grip and and so the Bible says
[1:42:40] that God spared not his own son but
[1:42:43] delivered him up for us all amen and and
[1:42:47] and we know how he sent his son right he
[1:42:50] sent his son the prophet said by going
[1:42:52] with him and being in him that's how God
[1:42:55] sent his son amen is is that God would
[1:42:59] be identified with man God would know
[1:43:02] how man felt he he would feel the
[1:43:05] feelings of man amen when someone was
[1:43:08] lonely he would know what it felt amen
[1:43:11] he couldn't do it as a spirit but he
[1:43:13] could do it coming into his son becoming
[1:43:16] human when someone was hungry and and
[1:43:19] beggarly and weak he would know how that
[1:43:21] felt he would know how you teenagers
[1:43:23] feel when you're confused and and you're
[1:43:26] going through the life and you're
[1:43:29] between uh uh uh uh uh the world of
[1:43:32] childhood and the world of adulthood and
[1:43:35] and and these things and and you don't
[1:43:37] know what to do and the pure pressure is
[1:43:39] there he would know how you felt God so
[1:43:46] loved the ministry was more than
[1:43:49] just his ministry was more than just
[1:43:51] healing sick and
[1:43:53] his his ministry was feeling the people
[1:43:57] going through what they they went
[1:44:01] through going through the Temptations
[1:44:04] and overcoming
[1:44:06] them and so the Bible says that God was
[1:44:09] in Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:44:12] himself so he wasn't bringing them to a
[1:44:15] church per se or some group he was
[1:44:18] bringing them to
[1:44:19] himself God was hid in the body of Jesus
[1:44:23] Christ you believe that and so that that
[1:44:26] shows that a a Christian Life cannot be
[1:44:30] lived without God living in the
[1:44:32] individual it was God in Christ it was
[1:44:34] God in Christ can you say man how how
[1:44:38] can it it this way how could we want the
[1:44:40] world re to be reconciled to God without
[1:44:44] God living in us we would have no desire
[1:44:47] for the world or for a burden for the
[1:44:50] world a love for people we we wouldn't
[1:44:53] we would be so consumed with our s our
[1:44:55] business and and our life and and our
[1:44:58] desires and our wants and our cravings
[1:45:00] and and and everything but Jesus he he
[1:45:04] forfeited all that because God was in
[1:45:06] him reconciling the world to
[1:45:09] himself
[1:45:12] amen
[1:45:14] so brother randam said Jesus came to
[1:45:17] break the clouds back so that attribute
[1:45:20] could display itself see so you were
[1:45:23] bound you were an attribute in God's
[1:45:26] thinking and as Sons and Daughters of
[1:45:29] God but you were
[1:45:33] trapped you you you were born in
[1:45:36] sin the desire might have been there to
[1:45:40] to to want to be
[1:45:42] free to to live right and yet you
[1:45:47] couldn't live right because your
[1:45:51] nature the so
[1:45:55] Fallen
[1:45:56] amen I say to you young people if you
[1:46:00] don't get the Holy Ghost the world will
[1:46:02] pull you out it'll draw
[1:46:05] you whether it be the sports where it'll
[1:46:09] be just some ungodly girl ungodly boy
[1:46:14] where it'll be movies television whether
[1:46:17] it be whatever there's so much there's
[1:46:20] so much entertainment out there
[1:46:25] and you well brother brand says about
[1:46:28] Billy Paul I think he said if God
[1:46:30] doesn't get a hold of him and filling
[1:46:31] with the Holy Ghost you know rock and
[1:46:33] roll would get
[1:46:35] him and because it's just naturally you
[1:46:39] know you go to a restaurant and you see
[1:46:40] a little old baby just a bobbing with
[1:46:42] that music you know well that baby's
[1:46:46] unconverted and and there's something
[1:46:48] there that's already as a sinful nature
[1:46:51] that's pulling on that well what
[1:46:53] Christian or what why would we want to
[1:46:55] go with that music why would we give you
[1:46:57] know sway to that music and then we set
[1:46:59] as an onal when when it comes to gospel
[1:47:01] music coming to the church we just sit
[1:47:05] there you know because we don't want to
[1:47:07] get out of
[1:47:08] order but then we go to to whatever and
[1:47:12] that rock and roll or whatever and just
[1:47:13] like you know you know and but what is
[1:47:17] it it's it's something there that's
[1:47:19] already in us to start doing those
[1:47:23] things it's a
[1:47:25] nature and and so if if you don't get
[1:47:28] the Holy Ghost then then there's going
[1:47:30] to be a pool that'll take you out it's
[1:47:33] it's just that way but he come to break
[1:47:38] that
[1:47:40] thing I I tell you we're not serving the
[1:47:42] lord by our own good will our own strong
[1:47:46] desires I promise you
[1:47:49] that CU cuz Satan's got something for
[1:47:52] for every one of us to take us out and
[1:47:56] to to to whatever can you say Amen but
[1:47:59] Jesus came the prophet said to break the
[1:48:01] clouds back so that that attribute the
[1:48:03] thinking of God that thought of God that
[1:48:07] seed of God that God placed in you that
[1:48:09] God thought of you before you ever
[1:48:12] become marred and before you ever become
[1:48:14] in a trap of of Satan and scarred and
[1:48:17] and and the sinful desires and the
[1:48:20] sinful pleasure and the the nature there
[1:48:22] he come to break that thing so that
[1:48:26] attribute could display itself
[1:48:30] hallelu this was the purpose of his
[1:48:33] preaching this was the purpose of him
[1:48:36] Healing The Sick this was the purpose of
[1:48:38] his seeing this is why he died and was
[1:48:41] buried and rose again this was the
[1:48:44] purpose of his life is to break the
[1:48:47] shackles of people's
[1:48:50] lives can you say Amen amen and so the
[1:48:54] prophet would say he he is God's
[1:48:57] expressed word speaking of Christ now
[1:49:00] nothing else could be manifesting other
[1:49:02] characters had all fallen so then you
[1:49:04] see what Jesus come to bring back those
[1:49:07] characters he said no no they were born
[1:49:09] in sin shaped in iniquity he came as a
[1:49:12] redeemer ain't that right he came as a
[1:49:16] redeemer his ministry was a Ministry of
[1:49:18] redemption reconciliation and and and to
[1:49:21] redeem anything thing is to bring it
[1:49:23] back amen bring it back it was God's
[1:49:26] thought you ain't that right think
[1:49:29] little old little you little me no one
[1:49:31] in the world could take my place no one
[1:49:33] can take yours see and you being a
[1:49:36] Christian and filled with the spirit of
[1:49:38] God and before the foundation of the
[1:49:39] world God seen you and know every
[1:49:41] creature that you got and Jesus come to
[1:49:44] bring you back to rescue you ain't that
[1:49:47] right see and and that had to come to be
[1:49:50] a human see as a red redemer the God
[1:49:53] could not do the ministry of redemption
[1:49:56] by a spirit amen he had to become man
[1:50:00] amen a a kinsman redeemer the human body
[1:50:03] to bring you back see that had to come
[1:50:06] to be a human as a redeemer to display
[1:50:09] his attributes as Savior come to redeem
[1:50:12] you and bring you back from where you
[1:50:14] come from can you amen so then only the
[1:50:18] redeemed attributes can be a a true
[1:50:21] Christian
[1:50:23] and and and brother Bram says no man can
[1:50:25] have his sins covered lest his name was
[1:50:27] put on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:50:29] the foundation of the world ain't that
[1:50:31] right so truly it is the grace of God
[1:50:34] that we're standing here today it's it's
[1:50:37] the grace of God that we are
[1:50:39] Christians how many believes that amen
[1:50:43] don't don't don't ever underestimate
[1:50:45] that don't don't ever underestimate and
[1:50:47] think well it's just because I'm just
[1:50:49] you know that's who I am no Satan can
[1:50:51] take you out in heartbeat if it ain't
[1:50:53] for the grace of God in your
[1:50:56] life it's it's just the truth and so we
[1:50:59] must not take these things for granted
[1:51:02] the world has misinterpreted the meaning
[1:51:05] of this word Christian uh you know today
[1:51:08] Christian means going to church or uh
[1:51:11] being religious or talking about God uh
[1:51:14] in the conversations or and and and and
[1:51:18] in this age if a man says he's a
[1:51:20] Christian well he's a Christian
[1:51:21] regardless of how lives regardless of
[1:51:23] how he talks regardless of his behavior
[1:51:26] he's just a Christian you know and that
[1:51:28] has become acceptable amen but the real
[1:51:32] meaning of the word Christian is to be
[1:51:35] Christlike everybody say Christlike
[1:51:38] Christlike Christlike see that's what
[1:51:40] makes the bride different from from the
[1:51:42] rest who is claiming to be Christian
[1:51:44] because there is a a people that is able
[1:51:48] to be
[1:51:50] Christlike can you say Amen see and and
[1:51:53] and so one just can't again as I've said
[1:51:56] just can't decide to be Christlike you
[1:51:59] have to be predestinated for it and and
[1:52:03] if you notice Romans
[1:52:05] 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did
[1:52:10] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:52:14] image of his
[1:52:16] son aren't you glad for that so so it is
[1:52:20] possible to be Christlike you you don't
[1:52:22] have to struggle and and worry and and
[1:52:26] and just be so up and down and just
[1:52:29] wandering and no you can rest rest in
[1:52:33] the predestinated will of God for your
[1:52:38] life now if if we're to be Christlike
[1:52:41] then Jesus was more than just sent here
[1:52:43] just to do his thing but he was set
[1:52:45] forth as an example do you believe that
[1:52:49] and the word example means one that
[1:52:51] serves as a
[1:52:52] pattern to be imitated or not to be
[1:52:56] imitated see so so that that's the
[1:53:00] example in other words you see an
[1:53:02] example and and and some are an example
[1:53:05] that you say now you don't want to be
[1:53:07] like that I don't want to be like that
[1:53:09] you know uh that's that's an example and
[1:53:11] you say no no but see but then you see
[1:53:15] examples that you say now that's way I
[1:53:17] want to be right I see men and uh
[1:53:20] brothers and sisters that I look uh uh
[1:53:22] and and and I see them go through things
[1:53:24] and I see them how they handle it and I
[1:53:26] see their characters about them and and
[1:53:29] I think now god that's way I want to be
[1:53:31] right there amen why it's an example
[1:53:34] well Jesus was the Supreme example that
[1:53:37] we could all as Believers as all as as
[1:53:41] attributes of God's thinking look at him
[1:53:45] and say well not yeah he's a good person
[1:53:47] yeah I I love the way he done those
[1:53:49] things and no no he's our examp
[1:53:53] exle is something that should be
[1:53:55] imitated in our lives in this day do you
[1:53:59] believe that see and and so I guess we
[1:54:03] could say that Jesus was a prototype
[1:54:06] which which is an original model on
[1:54:09] which something is patterned the church
[1:54:12] is patterned after him that's
[1:54:15] right 1 John
[1:54:18] 2:11 it says he he that saith he abideth
[1:54:21] in him
[1:54:22] ought ought himself also to to walk even
[1:54:26] as he walked see an example right so so
[1:54:31] the the person that says I'm abiding in
[1:54:33] Christ well then you ought to walk as he
[1:54:37] walked live as he lived talk as he
[1:54:41] talked right and the ministry that he
[1:54:45] had is the same Ministry that we're
[1:54:49] having now if he has set forth the
[1:54:52] example then then what does John
[1:54:55] 8:29 Jesus said I do always those things
[1:54:59] that please him that's right please the
[1:55:02] father right I do always those things
[1:55:05] that please the father uh you know that
[1:55:09] he's the example so then if you notice
[1:55:11] what Paul says in 2 Timothy 2:4 no man
[1:55:16] Warth that Warth entangleth himself with
[1:55:19] the Affairs of this life that he may
[1:55:21] please
[1:55:23] him who hath called him or chosen him to
[1:55:27] be a soldier can you say Amen see so so
[1:55:31] we looking at Jesus being that example
[1:55:34] you know I always do that which pleased
[1:55:36] the father was it easy for him to do the
[1:55:38] will of the father always absolutely not
[1:55:42] there was always that struggle there was
[1:55:45] always the flesh Waring against the
[1:55:47] spirit always and and and yet he was so
[1:55:52] discipline and and the reason and I have
[1:55:54] to say it uh because I believe it is
[1:55:57] that the the sole purpose was
[1:56:00] love there was such a love there for the
[1:56:05] people can you say Amen so no man worth
[1:56:09] and that worth entangleth himself with
[1:56:11] the Affairs of this life that means that
[1:56:14] that there the yes there's we're always
[1:56:17] going to be tempted there's always
[1:56:18] things in our uh you know the white you
[1:56:21] know the white dog the black dog brother
[1:56:23] brandham gives that illustration of the
[1:56:24] chief you know that that Wars against
[1:56:26] one another and and and he says well
[1:56:29] who's winning remember that he says well
[1:56:32] the one I feed the most right and and so
[1:56:35] then then we understand that and we're
[1:56:37] conscience uh that we want to please the
[1:56:39] father our desires to to to imitate
[1:56:43] Christ right then then we understand the
[1:56:48] Warfare that is always within us there
[1:56:51] there's always that constant Warfare
[1:56:54] amen there's that constant whether to do
[1:56:57] right or to do wrong now people that
[1:56:59] don't care about that they they they
[1:57:01] just don't care people that don't want
[1:57:03] to imitate Christ they don't care they
[1:57:05] can they can drink and talk about God at
[1:57:08] the same time they can smoke and talk
[1:57:10] about God they can go to the movies and
[1:57:12] talk about God they can watch you know
[1:57:14] all kinds of Filth and still talk about
[1:57:16] God and there's nothing there amen
[1:57:18] because the Warfare isn't as as it is
[1:57:21] with and I that are out to please God
[1:57:25] then we understand that there's things
[1:57:27] that can entangle
[1:57:32] us I believe that Jesus loved the people
[1:57:35] enough to
[1:57:37] not tried to do things on his
[1:57:40] own he loved people enough see he he
[1:57:44] rested in the father's will he rested in
[1:57:46] the father's wisdom he rested in the
[1:57:49] father's Plan of Redemption he rested
[1:57:53] ain't that right see and to do something
[1:57:55] on his own would have been to do
[1:57:57] something contrary to the father's Plan
[1:58:00] of
[1:58:01] Redemption ain't that right but he
[1:58:04] realized that God so loved the world
[1:58:07] that he was sent to the
[1:58:09] people to to to to break the bondages to
[1:58:13] destroy the works of the devil ain't
[1:58:16] that
[1:58:18] right this is why Jesus would say in
[1:58:21] John 530 says I can of my own self do
[1:58:24] nothing another place my me is to do the
[1:58:27] will of the
[1:58:28] father uh another place you know John
[1:58:31] 5:30 I seek not my own will but the will
[1:58:33] of the Father which hath sent me and and
[1:58:37] notice then notice and and the father's
[1:58:40] will he's saying I've come to do the
[1:58:42] father's will my meat is to do the will
[1:58:43] of the father but notice John 6:39 and
[1:58:46] this is the will of the father this is
[1:58:49] the Father's will which has sent that
[1:58:52] all that of all which he hath given me I
[1:58:55] should lose
[1:58:57] nothing prise God can you
[1:59:01] amen but should raise it up again at the
[1:59:04] last day and this is the will of him
[1:59:06] that sent me that everyone that seeth
[1:59:08] the son and believeth on him may have
[1:59:10] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:59:13] at the last day ain't that right so he
[1:59:16] knew that he was sent for a group of
[1:59:18] people he knew he knew that and I want
[1:59:21] to say it this way if I
[1:59:25] can your life is not here by
[1:59:31] accident you're you're sent here by
[1:59:35] God to be the bride of
[1:59:37] Christ with the
[1:59:41] ministry and with that in mind
[1:59:45] um you're sent here to affect
[1:59:48] somebody whether you realize that or not
[1:59:52] it's not just the preacher that that has
[1:59:55] the
[1:59:57] ministry but you have a Ministry and
[2:00:01] that is to affect somebody somebody's
[2:00:04] got to be affected by
[2:00:06] you you might be here sent just for one
[2:00:10] person you might be sent here for just
[2:00:13] two people you never know Jesus didn't
[2:00:16] know as far as who was the elect and who
[2:00:20] wasn't but he knew he was sent he knew
[2:00:24] he was sent to break the powers of the
[2:00:27] enemy you understand what I'm saying he
[2:00:29] knew that amen he had to be in the
[2:00:33] father's will he had to stay with the
[2:00:35] father he could not do what he wanted to
[2:00:37] do he could not he had to stay and and
[2:00:40] and therefore he had that's you know he
[2:00:43] had to stay in prayer he had to stay in
[2:00:45] constant fellowship with the spirit that
[2:00:48] was within him yes ain't that right but
[2:00:51] his whole goal was to do the will of the
[2:00:54] father and he knew the will of the
[2:00:55] father was I must not lose one of them I
[2:00:59] must not lose
[2:01:03] one I think if we would understand
[2:01:07] that and the only reason why he could do
[2:01:09] that is because there was the Divine
[2:01:11] love God so loved the
[2:01:14] world could you imagine Jesus coming
[2:01:16] being sent without that same love
[2:01:19] without having that same passion
[2:01:22] and he's working a Ministry he's doing
[2:01:24] these things and people slap him and
[2:01:25] people Mis abuse him and people
[2:01:27] misunderstand him and he said I forget
[2:01:30] them I'm just going to go out in the
[2:01:31] wood
[2:01:32] somewhere but he had the same
[2:01:36] love the very love that the father had
[2:01:39] because it was God in
[2:01:41] him ain't that
[2:01:43] right and and and there's times you know
[2:01:47] if God has sent you maybe he's put you
[2:01:48] on a
[2:01:49] job maybe he's put you in a particular
[2:01:54] situation that maybe even may not be
[2:01:56] pleasant to you but yet he's put you
[2:02:00] there to reach his
[2:02:02] soul true can you say
[2:02:05] Amen maybe someone needs to see a real
[2:02:09] character so God puts us in a place that
[2:02:12] that it just seemed like the pressure is
[2:02:14] there and the world is is is whatever
[2:02:18] and we want to just you know we we want
[2:02:22] we we want to run or we want to give up
[2:02:25] or we want to whatever but God has
[2:02:27] placed you there
[2:02:30] amen for maybe one Soul maybe five Souls
[2:02:35] May what whatever it would
[2:02:37] be and we must we must be at the
[2:02:39] father's
[2:02:41] business ain't ain't that
[2:02:43] right so so Jesus understanding this
[2:02:47] that I should not lose one
[2:02:52] I've said it
[2:02:53] before maybe God has given you a a a a
[2:02:58] personality God has put you in a
[2:03:00] position that I I to reach somebody that
[2:03:03] I would never be able to reach true and
[2:03:06] you're responsible for that
[2:03:08] Soul you're responsible you understand
[2:03:11] what I'm
[2:03:12] saying as much as I am responsible to
[2:03:15] preach the gospel whether I feel like it
[2:03:17] or not I'm responsible for it yes yes
[2:03:22] right God did not give me the gift of
[2:03:25] preaching just to benefit
[2:03:29] me so whether I'm sick or whether I'm
[2:03:31] not I'm
[2:03:33] responsible whether I'm on the mountain
[2:03:35] or whether I'm not I'm
[2:03:38] responsible ain't that
[2:03:41] right not always easy not always fun not
[2:03:44] always whatever but we're responsible
[2:03:47] but so is it with all of us amen see so
[2:03:51] there therefore if Jesus understood this
[2:03:54] that I'm sent for a purpose sent that I
[2:03:58] may not lose one of
[2:03:59] them and he's talking about the bride
[2:04:02] he's talking about but but there there's
[2:04:04] people that may be in your life that God
[2:04:07] has placed you there to be a
[2:04:10] lighthouse and we know it we know that
[2:04:13] it could be our actions it know we know
[2:04:16] it it it could be you know maybe Satan
[2:04:18] trying to get us to do something wrong
[2:04:20] or something to do you know or to give
[2:04:22] up and not care or get so discouraged
[2:04:26] that we just lose our position or we
[2:04:28] just leave or it whatever it would be
[2:04:31] but what I'm saying is we ought to be so
[2:04:33] sensitive to the father's will so
[2:04:36] sensitive to say God every morning that
[2:04:39] we wake up we say father I want to do
[2:04:41] your will who is it that I'm supposed to
[2:04:43] touch who is it that I'm supposed to
[2:04:45] speak to you
[2:04:48] understand Jesus knowing who he was he
[2:04:52] glorified the father not himself he
[2:04:54] glorified the father amen he manifested
[2:04:58] the father he did the works of the
[2:04:59] father ain't that right amen see and and
[2:05:04] and we know that he healed the sick and
[2:05:05] we know that he raised the dead and we
[2:05:07] know that that you know uh Matthew 4:23
[2:05:10] it says Jesus went about all Galilee
[2:05:13] teaching in their synagogues and
[2:05:14] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[2:05:16] healing all manner of sickness and all
[2:05:19] manner of disease among the people his f
[2:05:21] went throughout all Syria and they
[2:05:24] brought unto him all the sick people
[2:05:26] that were taken with uh divers diseases
[2:05:29] and torments and those which were
[2:05:31] possessed with devils and those which
[2:05:33] were lunatic and those that had the py
[2:05:35] and he healed
[2:05:37] them ain't that right why he was sent to
[2:05:41] break the powers of the devil ma uh
[2:05:44] Matthew 8:16 when even was come they
[2:05:47] brought unto him many that were
[2:05:49] possessed with devils and he cast out
[2:05:51] the the spirits with his word and healed
[2:05:54] all that were sick he discerned the
[2:05:56] people's hearts and the intent of their
[2:05:58] thoughts and and and and these things
[2:06:01] you know um and and and and why did he
[2:06:04] do it so he could have a Ministry so he
[2:06:06] could be lifted up no to let the people
[2:06:08] know that God was among them to let them
[2:06:12] know that there was a redeemer among
[2:06:14] them that God had come to save them and
[2:06:17] to set them
[2:06:20] free you believe it and the people saw
[2:06:23] God you believe
[2:06:25] it the people saw
[2:06:29] God the blind man who was healed said in
[2:06:32] John
[2:06:34] 9:33 speaking of Christ he said if this
[2:06:36] man were not of God he could do nothing
[2:06:39] so they knew he was of God that's right
[2:06:42] Nicodemus said to Jesus in John 3:2 we
[2:06:46] know that thou art a teacher come from
[2:06:48] God and no man for no man can do these
[2:06:51] miracles that thou doest except God be
[2:06:53] with them ain't that right so they knew
[2:06:55] that this wasn't just a fleshly
[2:06:57] manifestation they knew this wasn't just
[2:06:59] a some carnal in impersonation they knew
[2:07:03] that this was more than just a man doing
[2:07:05] these things it was God revealing
[2:07:08] himself to the
[2:07:11] people to the people brother Bram said
[2:07:14] Christ could speak and say the words and
[2:07:17] what it was and he said it isn't me it's
[2:07:20] my father that dwelleth in me me and his
[2:07:22] father that's the reason he prayed to
[2:07:24] the father now I won't keep you much
[2:07:27] longer but in him Christ were feelings
[2:07:30] of
[2:07:31] compassion I don't think that a person
[2:07:34] could have God and not have compassion
[2:07:36] true you believe
[2:07:38] it uh scripture speaking of God there
[2:07:42] David said there in Psalms 865 breaking
[2:07:46] in thou Lord are a God full of
[2:07:49] compassion and gracious and long
[2:07:51] suffering and plenteous and mercy and
[2:07:54] Truth ain't that right Psalms 1458 the
[2:07:57] Lord is gracious and full of compassion
[2:07:59] slow to anger and of great Mercy Psalms
[2:08:03] 7837 their heart was not right with him
[2:08:07] neither were they steadfast in his
[2:08:09] Covenant but he being full of compassion
[2:08:12] forgave their iniquity and destroyed
[2:08:14] them not yay many a Time turned he his
[2:08:19] anger away and did not stir up all his
[2:08:21] wrath ain't that
[2:08:24] right and then you find that God being
[2:08:26] in Christ watch the love Jesus so loved
[2:08:30] the people that even when they rejected
[2:08:33] his message they rejected that he went
[2:08:36] up the hill and wept saying oh Jerusalem
[2:08:41] Jerusalem thou which kill us the
[2:08:43] prophets and stonest them that are sent
[2:08:46] unto thee how often would I gather thy
[2:08:49] children together as a hen doth gather
[2:08:51] her brood under her wings and you would
[2:08:54] not ain't that right and the prophet
[2:08:57] said that he was weeping when he was
[2:08:58] saying these words can you imagine the
[2:09:00] love of God in in a man that even though
[2:09:03] the people had rejected him he had
[2:09:05] healed the sick he had raised their dead
[2:09:07] he would he he had done everything to
[2:09:09] manifest God to
[2:09:11] them that he' go up the
[2:09:14] hill and he would just weep I I I would
[2:09:19] say it would been a heavy weeping it
[2:09:20] would be a
[2:09:22] a sorrowful weeping because everything
[2:09:25] that he had done and yet they couldn't
[2:09:27] see
[2:09:28] God and and instead of hardening his
[2:09:32] heart the love of God was still there
[2:09:35] that he would weep and say oh how I
[2:09:38] would gather
[2:09:40] you there was it was a
[2:09:44] compassion brother Bram said of all the
[2:09:47] human emotions that Christ manifested
[2:09:51] the most when he appeared as the son of
[2:09:53] man was this one he wept
[2:09:57] often he wept for the people because why
[2:10:02] it was God that so
[2:10:05] loved and now God had sent and provided
[2:10:09] a remedy a savior a
[2:10:13] redeemer and God himself come and lived
[2:10:16] in that man in that body of Flesh to be
[2:10:20] the Redeemer
[2:10:22] and it was the same God now the god that
[2:10:25] become a man was expressing his love by
[2:10:29] weeping and by Ministry by trying to
[2:10:32] help people by trying to deliver them
[2:10:35] and tried to show them who he really was
[2:10:38] ain't that right showed that he
[2:10:42] cared and he says and yet behind that
[2:10:44] weeping in that Sarah there was still
[2:10:46] God he wept with compassion at the grave
[2:10:50] of Lazarus the prophet
[2:10:52] said and then them same people that had
[2:10:54] rejected him to think of that the same
[2:10:57] people that he's weeping for on on the
[2:11:00] mountain and he's looking at Jerusalem
[2:11:02] and he's weeping with
[2:11:05] sorrow because they've rejected him now
[2:11:10] them same people have hung him on a
[2:11:12] cross and they're wagging their tongues
[2:11:15] at him they're mocking him they're
[2:11:18] saying oh if he be Christ let him come
[2:11:20] down from the cross if he be God and yet
[2:11:24] through all of that that Bleeding Heart
[2:11:26] full of
[2:11:28] love looking down upon all of them and
[2:11:31] saying father forgive them for they know
[2:11:33] not what they
[2:11:35] do it was a love and there's not one
[2:11:38] circumstance that could change that love
[2:11:40] there there was not one situation that
[2:11:43] could change that love for
[2:11:46] them that's why it's easy to love our
[2:11:49] brother it's easy to love one that gives
[2:11:51] us accolades and and Praises us and say
[2:11:55] oh you're doing a good job you know it's
[2:11:57] it's easy to love people that want to be
[2:11:59] around you but what about those that
[2:12:02] well brother Bri said love the man that
[2:12:04] would kill you if he could can you sayen
[2:12:08] then that speaks of a love that we can't
[2:12:10] get on our
[2:12:13] own we
[2:12:15] can't that requires us to look to God
[2:12:18] and say
[2:12:19] God give me that kind of a
[2:12:22] love God be so real in my life let me
[2:12:26] come to that full maturity that
[2:12:27] character fully develop where the love
[2:12:30] of God could so flow through me how many
[2:12:34] wants that
[2:12:36] love I want to imitate it I I I want to
[2:12:40] be part of that and so brother Bram
[2:12:44] talks about how that Christ was the
[2:12:45] expression of what the father is and God
[2:12:48] is love amen
[2:12:52] so he says then Jesus was the full
[2:12:54] expression of love he was loved from the
[2:12:56] very first time that his little baby
[2:12:58] hands stroke the pretty cheeks of his
[2:13:01] mother he was love and he says and I
[2:13:04] think today that's where many is failing
[2:13:07] to recognize that he was
[2:13:11] love 1 John 4:7 says love is of God and
[2:13:16] everyone that loveth is born of God
[2:13:20] right no not human love we know that not
[2:13:22] perverted love not filthy love not lust
[2:13:25] love true not even a love that uh man
[2:13:29] and woman would have for each other and
[2:13:31] that's it should be a strong that's a
[2:13:33] strong love if love is really there but
[2:13:36] we're talking about a love that far
[2:13:38] Supreme true
[2:13:42] amen and this love he that loveth with
[2:13:45] this love divine love is born of God he
[2:13:48] comes from God ain't that right and
[2:13:52] knoweth God and he that loveth not
[2:13:56] knoweth not God for God is love brother
[2:14:00] Braham talked about his own self he said
[2:14:02] sometimes down in my heart I feel the
[2:14:04] Holy Spirit and notice that how he says
[2:14:06] that I feel the Holy Spirit just weeping
[2:14:11] for the people think of that but it's no
[2:14:15] longer in heaven as a spirit God it's no
[2:14:20] longer him in Christ in that human body
[2:14:24] weeping brother Brandon said now he's
[2:14:26] weeping in me I feel that Holy Spirit
[2:14:30] sometime in my heart weeping for the
[2:14:33] people he said oh I feel it I'm tired
[2:14:36] I'm weary I'm wor out my wife says you
[2:14:40] can't go another time honey you're about
[2:14:42] to fall you've ministered all day you've
[2:14:45] been week after week you look awful
[2:14:49] you're so nervous you can't sit at the
[2:14:51] table you're on the middle of the floor
[2:14:53] at night with a pillow in your arms
[2:14:55] praying for it see praying for his
[2:14:58] pillow said you're so nervous stay home
[2:15:02] honey before you die and I said but
[2:15:05] sweetheart them precious Souls out there
[2:15:07] to which Christ died for I must do it he
[2:15:10] said and that's why I'm here I love you
[2:15:14] God revealed that to the people is my
[2:15:16] prayer I'm not sent here to be seen or
[2:15:18] I'm not here to be seen I'm here because
[2:15:21] I love you I'm trying to shake you with
[2:15:23] the gospel out of that formal mody
[2:15:26] condition that the people are in do you
[2:15:29] believe that aren't you glad that there
[2:15:31] was a prophet that loved us am there was
[2:15:34] a prophet that was willing to go beyond
[2:15:36] and above and he's weak he's tired he's
[2:15:38] mental about to have the mental
[2:15:40] breakdowns and and and and his own
[2:15:43] daughter he's his own baby didn't even
[2:15:45] know him when he come home didn't know
[2:15:47] who he was he it broke his heart
[2:15:51] but he had to keep going because the
[2:15:53] holy spirit in his heart was weeping for
[2:15:56] the
[2:16:00] people what a love
[2:16:02] right weeping for the
[2:16:06] people so love brother brah says love
[2:16:10] for the people was one of the first
[2:16:11] characters that draw people to Jesus he
[2:16:14] loved the people and the people knew
[2:16:16] that he loved them because he had
[2:16:17] something to tell them they knew this
[2:16:20] man was acquainted behind the curtain
[2:16:23] Yonder of death they knew that he knew
[2:16:26] something about the world beyond the
[2:16:28] regions Beyond and they so loved to talk
[2:16:31] with him he talked he talked his talk
[2:16:34] was seasoned and mellow he said there
[2:16:37] was something his characters he said I
[2:16:39] doubt whether there'd be an artist could
[2:16:41] ever paint it if it's true in a vision
[2:16:44] one time I saw him and I say that humbly
[2:16:47] because I couldn't say it positively
[2:16:50] positive but if if it is there's never
[2:16:52] an artist could paint that picture of
[2:16:54] his characters he was a man who could be
[2:16:57] Stern and speak and yet he was a man who
[2:17:00] was humble and loving he was so many
[2:17:03] different characters in him that people
[2:17:05] you couldn't paint his picture he was
[2:17:07] God's manifestation of love power and
[2:17:10] deity and everything was in him can you
[2:17:14] say amen I hope I ain't borne you today
[2:17:18] but I hope it speaks to your heart as it
[2:17:21] has spoken to
[2:17:22] mine notice what Peter says to the
[2:17:25] church 1 Peter 4:1 for as much then as
[2:17:28] Christ has suffered for us in the flesh
[2:17:30] arm yourselves
[2:17:32] likewise with the same mind for he that
[2:17:36] hath suffered In the Flesh has ceased
[2:17:37] from sin that he no longer should live
[2:17:40] the rest of his time in the flesh to the
[2:17:42] lusts of men but to the will of God can
[2:17:46] you say amen and we find that doing the
[2:17:49] will of the father is is a sign that
[2:17:52] love has been perfected in us for 1 John
[2:17:56] 2:5 says but who so keepeth his word in
[2:17:59] him verily is the love of God perfected
[2:18:02] hereby know we that we are in him can
[2:18:06] you
[2:18:07] sayen as I said before doing the will of
[2:18:10] God is not the easiest
[2:18:14] thing because in your flesh you want to
[2:18:16] be accepted by all
[2:18:19] men in your flesh
[2:18:21] you you always want the easy
[2:18:24] path in your flesh you want everything
[2:18:26] to be easy and nothing hard and and all
[2:18:30] of these
[2:18:32] things but then when you understand that
[2:18:34] God places you in certain things
[2:18:39] and it would take the love of God to
[2:18:43] keep you there to hold you and not to
[2:18:47] complain and not to
[2:18:49] murmur and not to
[2:18:52] compromise but it would keep your heart
[2:18:55] in
[2:18:56] tuned you understand it keep you
[2:19:01] loving I think of so many times you know
[2:19:04] that Satan has done everything he can
[2:19:08] within the people of God to bring a
[2:19:10] bitterness in them to where they just
[2:19:12] walk away and they have no feeling for
[2:19:14] one another and they can't they can't
[2:19:17] get past the mistakes and they can't get
[2:19:19] past the misunderstanding standings and
[2:19:21] they they just can't get past to where
[2:19:23] it divides and separates and and all of
[2:19:27] these
[2:19:28] things but I pray God give us that
[2:19:31] Divine
[2:19:32] love that we can look past the faults
[2:19:35] that we can look past one another's
[2:19:37] blunders and blemishes and we could look
[2:19:39] past you know the sinner out there we
[2:19:42] could look past all of these things and
[2:19:45] the conditions that people are in and
[2:19:48] instead of breathing fire down we could
[2:19:50] say well
[2:19:51] God help him forgive him you
[2:19:56] understand that we'd be willing to just
[2:20:00] put aside differences just for the sake
[2:20:02] of
[2:20:03] fellowship and
[2:20:05] love to help somebody you see if we if
[2:20:09] if we build ourselves a wall and we
[2:20:12] withdraw ourselves and we're in our
[2:20:13] little corner how do we affect
[2:20:18] people amen can you say Amen
[2:20:24] so our will is in constant is in
[2:20:27] conflict with his
[2:20:29] will and it was the
[2:20:33] same with Christ brother random says our
[2:20:37] dear Lord Jesus himself in the world's
[2:20:40] greatest
[2:20:41] Battleground
[2:20:44] Gethsemane so Jesus went to the greatest
[2:20:47] battle of all Gethsemane
[2:20:52] he cried out in
[2:20:55] despair should he take the sins of the
[2:20:58] world or should he just remain on Earth
[2:21:00] with his beloved disciples which what he
[2:21:03] wanted to
[2:21:05] do but watch his humility as he humbled
[2:21:08] himself not my will but thine be done
[2:21:11] humbled himself to the word the promised
[2:21:13] word of the god of
[2:21:15] heaven and notice then he went a little
[2:21:19] further and if he went a little further
[2:21:22] how much more ought we to go a little
[2:21:24] further and notice the scripture says
[2:21:26] here in Luke that he prayed earnestly
[2:21:29] brother and sister if Jesus had to pray
[2:21:31] earnestly how much more have we got to
[2:21:33] pray earnestly if Christ the god of
[2:21:36] Heaven made flesh had to pray earnestly
[2:21:38] then how much more are we Sinners saved
[2:21:40] by grace pray earnestly if the decision
[2:21:44] throwed the Son of God into despair what
[2:21:46] will it do to you and I and desperately
[2:21:49] we must cry can you say Amen what is it
[2:21:53] because we know that we're sent on a
[2:21:55] mission we know that we must do the
[2:21:57] father's will we must know that his will
[2:22:00] is to be carried out and if we do our
[2:22:03] own will if we do what we want to do
[2:22:05] then you can't do your will and his will
[2:22:07] at the same time so Divine love keeps us
[2:22:10] to the will of the father
[2:22:13] amen the will of the father Divine
[2:22:17] love
[2:22:18] amen if I could set this this way as I
[2:22:21] close is the will of the father
[2:22:22] different for us than it was for
[2:22:25] Jesus I don't think so of course we're
[2:22:28] not required to Die For The People's
[2:22:31] sins as he did and we're we're not the
[2:22:36] Redeemer uh to die and and all of these
[2:22:39] things that's that's not what I'm saying
[2:22:42] but we are to preach the gospel as he
[2:22:44] did we are to do the same works that he
[2:22:47] did we we we we are to heal the sick and
[2:22:50] cast out Devils as he did can you say
[2:22:52] man so this is being this is part of
[2:22:54] being Christlike a Christian and and so
[2:22:58] many people that claim to be Christians
[2:22:59] deny this part they don't believe in
[2:23:02] healing they don't believe in casting
[2:23:04] out Devils they don't they they don't
[2:23:06] believe in the power of God anymore but
[2:23:09] if we're going to be Christlike then
[2:23:11] this is what we're called to do we we
[2:23:14] must not we must in we must not look at
[2:23:17] someone say man that person is so evil
[2:23:21] you know I just don't like that person
[2:23:23] or I just think it's impossible but
[2:23:27] what what if God has put them in our
[2:23:30] lives in some way they may persecute us
[2:23:33] or they may ridicule us or they may bet
[2:23:35] somewhere down inside there's a seed
[2:23:38] there and for some reason God is just
[2:23:41] keeping us there in contact with that
[2:23:43] person that person could be the most
[2:23:45] miserable person and it could be a
[2:23:47] person that is bound by a religious
[2:23:49] spirit that is setting in a church and
[2:23:52] yet that brother Bram said a religious
[2:23:54] spirit is worse than them
[2:23:56] all that keeps people bound they may
[2:23:59] know the Bible they may know the message
[2:24:01] they may know everything but they're so
[2:24:03] Bound in their
[2:24:05] heart but what if God has put us there
[2:24:08] and we must not look at it as an
[2:24:10] impossible situation you understand what
[2:24:12] I'm saying because I guarantee you if
[2:24:15] Christ looked at us and looked at us as
[2:24:17] an impossible situation we would be in
[2:24:20] trouble if he looked at us in his
[2:24:22] discouragements and if he could see and
[2:24:24] say man there ain't no way it would have
[2:24:27] been more easier for him to stay there
[2:24:29] with his disciples that loved him and
[2:24:32] depended upon him but he went beyond
[2:24:35] that and done the will of the father for
[2:24:36] our
[2:24:39] sakes you love
[2:24:41] him so why are we preaching the gospel
[2:24:44] why do we sing why do we play the music
[2:24:47] why do we come to
[2:24:49] church why is that we're out in the
[2:24:51] world in in work and school and and
[2:24:55] wherever why why are all these
[2:24:58] things well Paul in 2 Corinthians 5 and
[2:25:03] 20 says now then now then we are
[2:25:06] ambassadors of Christ it was Christ
[2:25:10] being the ambassador of the father for
[2:25:12] the father sent him to show Christ to
[2:25:15] show God that's what brother Bram said
[2:25:18] he was manifested to show God to the
[2:25:20] people
[2:25:21] but now then we are ambassadors for
[2:25:24] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[2:25:28] us we pray you in Christ dead be ye
[2:25:34] reconciled to God can you say Amen so
[2:25:39] now the holy spirit's in the church
[2:25:41] weeping for the
[2:25:43] people and in the ministry that we're
[2:25:47] in it it's got to be motivated by Divine
[2:25:52] love I I know we we want to make money
[2:25:55] and I know we choose jobs for such and
[2:25:57] these things but our whole motive should
[2:26:00] be
[2:26:02] God give me such love for whoever I am
[2:26:05] to meet
[2:26:06] today that your co-workers or whatever
[2:26:09] it's not just to it's not just for your
[2:26:11] life here so that you can live in
[2:26:14] greatness and ease and all these God's
[2:26:18] put Souls into your hand
[2:26:21] that may not even come to
[2:26:23] church but brother Bram said there's
[2:26:25] people that won't even come to church
[2:26:27] wouldn't even step a foot inside church
[2:26:29] and you're the only Bible you're the
[2:26:31] only God that they will see can you say
[2:26:35] Amen so what good is Ministry without
[2:26:38] love amen what good is gifts without
[2:26:40] love what good is the knowledge that we
[2:26:43] have of the Bible without
[2:26:45] love can you say Amen may God give us
[2:26:49] Divine love
[2:26:51] to where we can see that we are sent by
[2:26:53] our father to be ambassadors in this
[2:26:57] generation I look at so many people that
[2:27:00] are so just confused in this age I thank
[2:27:03] God I've got the answer I know I got the
[2:27:06] answer let me make myself available to
[2:27:09] them don't let them pull on me I want to
[2:27:11] pull on them don't let them have
[2:27:14] influence over me I want to have
[2:27:16] influence over
[2:27:17] them if the musicians will come we were
[2:27:20] at a restaurant the other day in in Ron
[2:27:23] Oak with the family and as we were
[2:27:26] sitting there you know
[2:27:29] I a man on the outside of the
[2:27:32] restaurant it was downtown Ron
[2:27:35] Oak and a man draw our attention as we
[2:27:39] looked at him he's just sitting there
[2:27:42] with the bag of chips talking to
[2:27:44] chips he starts talking to the
[2:27:48] ground you know and people passing by
[2:27:51] would just look at him like he's just
[2:27:55] strange and I told the family I hate
[2:27:58] that devil I hate him that he would take
[2:28:02] a human being and destroy that man
[2:28:05] thought he would be an innocent man an
[2:28:07] innocent baby born innocently something
[2:28:10] happened in his life I don't know what
[2:28:12] it was but the man's mind was totally
[2:28:15] burnt had no hope and I thought oh God
[2:28:19] have mercy on that man
[2:28:21] just have
[2:28:22] mercy and I think of so many people just
[2:28:25] like
[2:28:26] that you just want to help people
[2:28:29] somehow and it wouldn't be good just to
[2:28:31] give them another bag of chips it
[2:28:33] wouldn't be good just to give them what
[2:28:35] they're asking for can of beer that's
[2:28:38] what they think they need but what they
[2:28:41] really need is
[2:28:44] someone to give them a way of
[2:28:48] life what they really need is to accept
[2:28:52] this eternal Plan of
[2:28:54] Redemption can you say man I Don't Want
[2:28:57] to Go to Heaven by
[2:28:58] myself I want to take people with
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:07] me and we look at what brother Bram
[2:29:10] talked of the invasion of the United
[2:29:11] States and we're saying it so real
[2:29:16] today people are just bound everywhere
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:24] my wife talking to an individual the
[2:29:25] other day
[2:29:27] that used to come to this church totally
[2:29:30] backslid now going to
[2:29:34] a Church of God Church of Christ or
[2:29:38] whatever the individual says I but I
[2:29:40] still have I still want to know about
[2:29:42] the message I got
[2:29:44] questions I thought oh God if we can
[2:29:46] reach her somehow reach that individual
[2:29:48] somehow
[2:29:50] let them know that there's truly a God
[2:29:52] that loves her that
[2:29:54] cares I told my wife make every every
[2:29:58] way possible for us to get her reach her
[2:30:01] talk to her fellowship with her make
[2:30:04] yourself available that's what we want
[2:30:06] to do can you say
[2:30:08] Amen church it's not
[2:30:11] us they don't need to see some talent
[2:30:14] that we got there's so much talent out
[2:30:16] in the world they don't need to have
[2:30:18] personality there's so much good
[2:30:20] personalities out there but what they
[2:30:23] want is to see God brother BR say the
[2:30:26] world is crying for
[2:30:30] love he also said that their only love
[2:30:33] will be found is in the
[2:30:35] elect so may we the father be expressed
[2:30:38] through
[2:30:40] us may he weep through
[2:30:43] us may he speak through us may he
[2:30:46] testify through us may be reflected
