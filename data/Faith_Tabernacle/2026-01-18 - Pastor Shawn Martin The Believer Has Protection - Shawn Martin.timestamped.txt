[25:46] So, there's just a lot that are um not
[25:49] feeling well this morning. Amen. Don't
[25:52] see Janice this morning. So, let's just
[25:54] remember her in our prayers this
[25:56] morning. The Lord would just uh go and
[25:58] and be with her. May I? We want to um
[26:03] uh it says, "Please remember Steve
[26:05] Broomfield in our in our prayers this

[26:10] surgery tomorrow." Amen. So, let's just

[26:57] And if you would, if you remember just
[26:59] one of those requests and your brother
[27:02] or your sister standing beside you would
[27:05] remember another, we'll make sure that
[27:07] we cover all the bases. The names
[27:09] already been read, but many times it's
[27:11] good to call those names in prayer. I
[27:14] can't do it all. I only remember about
[27:16] half of them, but if you'll remember the
[27:18] others, I think it'll just make us all a
[27:21] harmonious unit this morning in prayer.
[27:24] Heavenly Father God, we want to thank
[27:26] you, Lord Jesus, for each and every one
[27:28] of your blessings, Lord, that you
[27:30] bestowed upon our lives, oh God. Lord,
[27:33] sometimes we get aches and pains. We get
[27:36] we get uh a little thing that'll bother
[27:39] us here and there, but then we hear
[27:40] about a brother and sister that's really
[27:43] really sick, Lord, running fevers and
[27:46] all of a sudden our little aches and
[27:48] pains and little things that the devil
[27:50] tries to poke us with a needle here and
[27:53] there, dear God, it don't mean anything
[27:55] because Lord, someone else, Lord, needs
[27:58] our prayers, God, more than we do,
[28:01] Father God. We realize we're not so
[28:02] needy after all when we hear about the
[28:05] needs of others, oh God. And Lord, the
[28:07] battles and struggles and sicknesses,
[28:10] God, that many are facing, oh God, Lord,
[28:12] and medical expenses, God, that go along
[28:15] with it, Lord, it strains the budgets
[28:18] many times, God. And Lord, I haven't
[28:20] been there myself, Lord God. I know what
[28:22] it's like, Lord, when money start to run
[28:24] low and doctor bills start piling up,
[28:27] dear God. But Lord, you've always made a
[28:29] way and you will make a way, Father God,
[28:32] where there seems to be no way. And God,
[28:35] this morning, we just want to pray, dear
[28:37] God. Lord, for Sister Kim, Lord, her
[28:40] special request, Lord, for her husband
[28:42] having that surgery, oh God, on her
[28:44] eyes, on Steve's eyes, God, in the
[28:46] morning, Lord God, we just pray, God,
[28:48] you'd guide, the doctor's hands
[28:50] skillfully, Lord, as he's been trained
[28:52] to do. But dear God, there's always a
[28:55] chance of something going wrong. May
[28:57] God, even a simple surgery like that,
[28:59] dear God. And Lord, we pray for a steady
[29:02] hand. Oh God, may you bless his hand and
[29:05] may Steve, Father God, be may his
[29:08] eyesight improve. And Lord God, we pray
[29:11] for these other requests, oh God. Lord,
[29:14] it was mentioned, Lord God, of the
[29:16] different families, Lord, that's here in
[29:18] the church, oh God, that's out sick this
[29:20] morning, dear God. Lord, affliction
[29:23] flying around, bugs flying around trying
[29:26] to attack the children. Lord, from the
[29:28] youngest to the elderly, there God,
[29:30] Satan don't he don't have mercy on
[29:32] nobody. But God, we rebuke the power of
[29:34] the enemy this morning. We stand with
[29:37] our brothers and sisters, oh God, in
[29:38] their afflictions, God. Lord, we we all
[29:41] know what it's like, dear God. And we
[29:43] know that you took 39 stripes on your
[29:46] back for our healing. We pray, God, for
[29:48] your deliverance. We thank you, dear
[29:51] God, for what you're doing. For Sister
[29:54] Kimberly, Lord, our prayers have been
[29:56] with her, dear God. She's with us this
[29:58] morning. May you bless her in her faith,
[30:00] Lord, in her walk, Lord, to even defy
[30:03] weakness to defy whatever, Lord, it
[30:06] took, God, this morning. Her love and
[30:08] joy for you, dear God, overexceeded,
[30:11] Lord, her own feelings, oh God, in her
[30:14] flesh, God. We just pray your blessing
[30:16] over her and brother John. Dear God, we
[30:18] ask it, oh God. Lord, you bless our
[30:20] pastor. She comes to minister the word
[30:22] of God, Lord, again, those that are out
[30:25] sick, Lord, not with us, God, this
[30:27] morning. Be with them in their homes,
[30:29] God, today. May you give them a blessed
[30:31] day. We ask it, Lord, and touch them in
[30:33] their bodies, Lord. Many other requests,
[30:36] oh God, dear God, we just pray for them,
[30:38] Lord, that their needs might be met. In
[30:40] the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[30:45] Oh,

[30:52] And oh,
[30:55] the joy that floods my soul.
[31:02] You see, something
[31:05] has happened. Oh, and now and now I know
[31:12] Jesus touched me
[31:15] and he made
[31:17] me whole. You can be seated this
[31:20] morning. Oh,
[31:22] he touched me.
[31:25] Yes,
[31:27] he touched me.
[31:32] And oh
[31:35] the joy that floods my soul.
[31:40] Mom, do you have a song for us? Oh,
[31:43] something
[31:45] has happened
[31:47] and now I know Jesus touched me and he
[31:55] made
[31:57] me whole.
[32:00] Yes,
[32:02] he touched me.
[32:05] Oh,
[32:07] he touched me.
[32:11] And oh,
[32:14] the joy that floods my soul.
[32:21] Oh, something
[32:24] has happened.
[32:27] And now I
[32:30] hope Jesus touched me
[32:34] and made
[32:36] me whole.
[32:40] Amen.
[33:01] He promised us that he would be a
[33:06] counselor,
[33:10] a mighty God
[33:13] and a prince of peace.
[33:19] He promised us that he would be a father
[33:28] and would love us with a love that would
[33:32] not cease.
[33:37] Well, I've tried him and I found his
[33:41] promises are true.
[33:46] He's everything
[33:49] he said that he would be.
[33:55] The finest words I know cannot begin to
[34:02] tell
[34:04] just how much Jesus really means to me.
[34:13] For he's
[34:15] more
[34:18] wonderful
[34:22] than my mind can conceive. He's so
[34:27] wonderful.
[34:30] And my heart does believe he goes beyond
[34:38] my highest hopes
[34:41] and fondest
[34:44] dreams.
[34:50] He's everything
[34:56] that my soul's
[34:58] ever longed for.
[35:02] Everything he's promised
[35:05] and so
[35:07] much more. More than amazing,
[35:13] more than marvelous,
[35:18] more than miraculous
[35:21] could ever be.
[35:25] He's more than wonderful.
[35:30] That's what Jesus
[35:34] is
[35:35] to me.
[35:44] Well, I stand amazed when I think the
[35:48] King of glory
[35:53] would come to live within the heart of
[35:58] man.
[36:01] And I marvel just to know that he really
[36:06] loves
[36:08] me
[36:10] when I think of who he is and who I am.
[36:20] For he's
[36:22] more
[36:24] wonderful
[36:27] than my mind
[36:30] can conceive. He's so wonderful
[36:36] and my heart does believe he goes beyond
[36:44] all my highest hopes
[36:47] and my fondest
[36:50] dreams.
[36:56] He's everything
[37:01] that my soul
[37:04] could ever long for. He's everything
[37:08] he's promised
[37:11] and so much more. More than amazing,
[37:19] more than marvelous,
[37:23] more than miraculous
[37:26] could ever be.
[37:30] He's more than wonderful.
[37:36] That's what Jesus
[37:39] is
[37:40] to me.
[37:44] Oh, he's everything
[37:48] that my soul's
[37:51] ever longed for. He's everything he's
[37:56] promised and yet so much more. He's more
[38:02] than amazing,
[38:05] more than miraculous,
[38:10] more than marvelous
[38:13] could ever be.
[38:17] He's more than wonderful.
[38:22] More than wonderful.
[38:26] That's what my Jesus
[38:32] is. That's what Jesus is
[38:36] to me.
[38:49] Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[38:52] Amen. Can we sing that song? Jesus,
[38:54] we're dependent on you. Amen. Are you
[38:56] dependent on him this morning? Amen.
[39:01] Oh Jesus,
[39:03] we're depending on you.
[39:08] Oh Jesus,
[39:11] we're depending on you. Yes,
[39:16] Jesus,
[39:19] we're depending on you.
[39:23] Oh, depending on you, oh, to see us
[39:28] through.
[39:30] When they came to the waters,
[39:34] didn't know what to do.
[39:38] There was no one to help them. Couldn't
[39:42] see their way through.
[39:45] Oh, but Lord, you moved the waters
[39:49] and they walked right on through. you.
[39:52] Oh Jesus, we're depending on you.

[40:15] Jesus,

[40:22] depending on you, Lord, to see us
[40:27] through. Now, when our face dried by
[40:31] fire,
[40:32] we still know that it's true.
[40:36] Oh, that Satan is a liar.
[40:40] There isn't much that he can do. And
[40:43] though, and though he's tried to stop
[40:46] us, we know you'll bring us through. Oh
[40:51] Jesus, we're depending on you.
[40:56] Yes,
[40:58] Jesus.
[41:00] Oh, we're depending on you.
[41:04] Yes, Jesus.
[41:08] Oh, we're depending on you. Yes,

[45:02] Aren't you glad that you have a refuge?
[45:06] Amen.
[45:07] God is so good. Amen. Not only to save
[45:11] our soul but to provide something to
[45:13] hide us in. Amen. So glad for that.

[49:00] Shalom.
[49:03] Oh my prince of peace
[49:07] and I worship you because of who you
[49:12] are.
[49:15] Lord, I worship you because of who you
[49:19] are.
[49:22] Can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[49:25] and just love him?
[49:28] The prophet said it's time for King Lamb
[49:31] worship.
[49:32] This is the time for the redeemed to
[49:36] give him glory and worship him for who
[49:40] he is.
[49:42] is show that he's worthy.
[49:45] He showed just who he is and what he is.
[49:50] If he does nothing else for us, it ain't
[49:53] going to stop our praise. It ain't going
[49:56] to stop our worship for we worshiping
[49:58] him for who he is. Hallelujah. We thank
[50:02] you, Father, for it, Lord.
[50:05] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[50:09] The Lord is certainly good to us. Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; And uh it's uh good to just have
[50:16] everyone
[50:18] uh in the house of the Lord, those that
[50:21] um been gone uh due to sickness and
[50:24] things. And Amen. I um glad that u uh
[50:30] the Lord is still our healer.
[50:34] Amen. And um the Lord is certainly good.
[50:38] The musicians can be dismissed.
[50:40] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we're
[50:43] going to turn to um Psalms first of all,
[50:46] Psalms 119.
[50:51] Amen.
[50:54] And um we're going to read u verse 116
[50:59] and 117.
[51:05] Praise the Lord.
[51:10] And uh before we go into the word, may
[51:14] we just bow our heads and talk to him
[51:18] who has wrote the word and can reveal it
[51:22] to us today. Father,
[51:26] as your children, we just humbly bow our
[51:30] hearts, our head before you, Lord.
[51:34] Father, you are truly worthy of all of
[51:36] our worship.
[51:38] And we realize that without you, we are
[51:41] nothing.
[51:43] We can read this book backward and
[51:45] forward and understand it with an
[51:47] intellectual
[51:49] conception and yet not understand
[51:53] your will and your mind.
[51:56] Father, if you just reveal it to us,
[51:59] then we the mind of Christ.
[52:02] And I pray, Father, that you would do so
[52:04] today. Father, any spirit that would try
[52:08] to hinder, disturb the people of God
[52:12] from receiving the word of God, I pray,
[52:15] Lord, that you would just uh uh defeat
[52:18] that enemy this morning. May we have the
[52:22] liberty to speak. May your anointing be
[52:25] upon me and upon the people and help me
[52:28] just to get myself out of the way.
[52:29] Father,
[52:31] we ask these things, Lord, in Jesus
[52:34] Christ's name. And the church says,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. So, uh Psalms um
[52:44] uh 119
[52:46] 116.
[52:49] uh we'll read
[52:51] uh there but it says uphold me according
[52:54] unto thy word that I may live and let me
[52:59] not be ashamed of my hope. Hold thou me
[53:02] up and I shall be safe and I will have
[53:06] respect under thy statutes
[53:09] continually.
[53:11] Amen.
[53:12] Then if you'll go to 143, chapter 143 of
[53:17] the same book,
[53:21] and
[53:24] I want to read verse 9.
[53:32] Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies.
[53:35] I flee unto thee to hide me.
[53:39] Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my
[53:42] God. Thy spirit is good. Lead me into
[53:44] the land of uprightness. Quicken me, O
[53:47] Lord, for thy name's sake, for thy
[53:49] righteousness's sake, and bring my soul
[53:54] out of trouble. Amen.
[53:58] You can uh be seated this morning.
[54:02] And um
[54:06] want to maybe just look at um the
[54:10] believer has protection.
[54:14] And how many believe you got protection?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; I am really glad to have protection in
[54:20] this age. Sure.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; And and so uh needing to be protected is
[54:28] I guess the a main part of our lives uh
[54:33] just in the natural sense ever since the
[54:37] fall of man. Uh man has needed to be
[54:41] protected
[54:42] &gt;&gt; and we have come up with ways to protect
[54:46] oursel
[54:48] uh uh there and and we have clothes uh
[54:52] that protect us from the weather. We
[54:55] have certain things that protect our
[54:57] skin from the sun. We have weapons that
[55:01] protect us from danger uh harm and
[55:06] things like that. We have a house that
[55:09] protects us from the rain, the snow, the
[55:12] cold, the heat. You know, it uh we we we
[55:16] have uh uh protection.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; In Oklahoma, you know, we have what they
[55:22] call storm shelters. It's it's something
[55:25] that uh protects us, you know, when when
[55:29] tornadoes
[55:30] uh come. Uh but there there's all kinds
[55:36] of protection
[55:38] &gt;&gt; that we have come and come up with and
[55:42] and having protection can be a matter of
[55:47] life and death. um uh you know uh uh
[55:51] every once in a while you'll read of
[55:53] people going you know hiking out in
[55:56] Arizona
[55:57] and um you know and and then they're
[56:01] they're lost or they found dead and and
[56:03] and
[56:05] many times it's because they froze or uh
[56:08] they they didn't bring the adequate
[56:11] protection that they needed to hide
[56:14] themselves and and protect themselves
[56:17] from danger and things like that. So if
[56:21] if we didn't have protection, could you
[56:25] imagine if we didn't have that and yet
[56:27] danger was around, then we would fear,
[56:30] we would worry, we would panic, um uh it
[56:35] it would put us in a state of um uh of
[56:39] just fright and and things like that. So
[56:43] protection gives us uh a confidence
[56:47] um you know it gives us confidence
[56:50] boldness
[56:52] &gt;&gt; because we feel that we are safe from
[56:56] danger. We feel we're safe from harm and
[56:59] and uh uh so we're glad for that. Man is
[57:02] always looking for uh a place of safety
[57:08] uh protection.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and so man uh you know the
[57:14] prophet tells us ever since man fell uh
[57:17] man has sought his own way uh to do
[57:21] things and how to live and and and
[57:25] depended upon himself to save himself
[57:28] and things like that and but then we we
[57:31] read there in Proverbs uh 3 and5 and it
[57:36] says trust in the Lord with all thine
[57:40] heart, and lean not unto thine own
[57:44] understanding, and in all thy ways.
[57:46] Everybody say, all thy ways. Acknowledge
[57:49] him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be
[57:54] not wise in thine own eyes. Fear the
[57:57] Lord and depart from evil. Ain't that
[58:00] right?
[58:01] &gt;&gt; So then we find that God wants us to
[58:04] trust him in every aspect of our life.
[58:08] and um you know uh uh for everything
[58:11] that we have need of he wants us to
[58:14] trust him to provide for us or to
[58:17] deliver us to uh provide and and help in
[58:21] the time of need. Uh in the Bible God
[58:24] expresses his desire uh to protect us
[58:28] and he would say I uh I am I am thy
[58:33] shield. I am thy buckler. Right? Uh he
[58:37] proclaims to be uh a hiding place. He uh
[58:42] the Bible says he is our fortress. Um he
[58:45] is a refuge. And and and so in in
[58:50] different words um God is letting us
[58:53] know that he is a a a protector. Amen.
[58:59] And and if there's any a time that we
[59:01] need to know God as a protector, it's
[59:04] it's in this age. Proverbs 18:10, it
[59:08] says, "The name of the Lord is a strong
[59:10] tower, and the righteous, that believer,
[59:13] the righteous run into it, and is safe."
[59:17] Amen.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 32:2, "And a man shall be as an
[59:22] hiding place from the wind, and a covert
[59:25] from the tempest, and as the rivers of
[59:28] water in a dry place, as the shadow of a
[59:30] great rock in a weary land. A man shall
[59:34] be, of course, we know it's speaking of
[59:36] Christ."
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Psalms 46:1, God is our refuge and
[59:41] strength, a very present help in time of
[59:44] refuge or in time of trouble. another
[59:47] place a refuge in times of trouble. So
[59:51] we we look at protection and the word
[59:55] means a a shield, a cover from exposure,
[1:00:01] damage, harm, injury or destruction,
[1:00:05] a uh uh protection to guard or to
[1:00:10] defend.
[1:00:11] And so we we know God to be a our
[1:00:16] protection in many ways. Um you know it
[1:00:20] could be in the natural sense uh uh that
[1:00:24] God uh uh we see God as a refuge. Um uh
[1:00:30] you know uh brother Bram talks about
[1:00:32] that woman coming from a prayer prayer
[1:00:34] meeting and and late at night and uh
[1:00:38] usually people were out walking around
[1:00:41] but um uh this time it was really cold
[1:00:44] and everybody was in the house and and
[1:00:47] just before she left she felt danger.
[1:00:49] She just felt in her heart danger.
[1:00:52] Brother Brham said that was God warning
[1:00:54] her of of danger lurking out there. And
[1:00:58] there's a lot of times that God warns us
[1:01:01] of these things and and and it would be
[1:01:04] good to to to take heed of this and and
[1:01:07] sometime we think well that's just my
[1:01:09] feeling or maybe like that but it could
[1:01:11] be God a man sending out a warning and
[1:01:15] so anyway uh she went ahead and started
[1:01:17] walking and no one out there and and um
[1:01:21] uh she noticed this hideous man walking
[1:01:24] to her and uh and and she could just
[1:01:29] sense the evil uh around this man and
[1:01:32] she had nowhere to go, no place to run.
[1:01:35] The winds were a howling and so no one
[1:01:38] would hear her scream or anything like
[1:01:40] that. And and uh uh uh she began to sing
[1:01:44] the song, "No, never alone. No, never
[1:01:48] alone." And and uh uh but as this man
[1:01:53] was coming, it said out of the clear
[1:01:55] blue, a dog uh from the uh some uh house
[1:02:00] porch uh come running and and stood
[1:02:02] right by her and started growling at
[1:02:05] that hideous man. And that man left. And
[1:02:09] when he left, that dog just went right
[1:02:11] back on the porch and laid down. And and
[1:02:14] the prophet said, "See, that was God
[1:02:17] being a protector."
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; God always takes care of his own. Ain't
[1:02:22] that right? Sometimes he works through
[1:02:24] even a dog or an animal or some other
[1:02:28] way to show his glory and his
[1:02:31] protection. We could all, I believe,
[1:02:34] have a a uh testimony, I'm sure, could
[1:02:37] tell of God's protection uh uh on our
[1:02:41] life. Um to keep us from harm and and
[1:02:45] you know, I've told the story of of how
[1:02:47] that when uh I was just real young and
[1:02:51] uh but bit old enough to remember it. Uh
[1:02:54] but we were coming from Oklahoma to
[1:02:56] Arkansas and dad had stayed home. mom
[1:03:00] was taking her mother, my grandmother,
[1:03:04] which was an invalid uh uh totally
[1:03:07] crippled up with arthritis and taking
[1:03:10] her home to Arkansas and and somehow it
[1:03:13] was raining and the car had either
[1:03:16] pulled out or stopped or something and
[1:03:18] mom slammed on the brakes and we went uh
[1:03:21] around and started spinning and we went
[1:03:23] down a a deep embankment and and uh um
[1:03:28] uh the back wheels ended up in the river
[1:03:30] and and but it was around that time that
[1:03:34] later on, you know, we find out that dad
[1:03:37] was there and he was asleep and the Lord
[1:03:39] woke him up and said, "Pray for your
[1:03:41] family or you'll never see them again."
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And it was such an urgency that dad just
[1:03:48] said he just just fell out of bed and
[1:03:50] just started praying uh for for us. And
[1:03:54] and and see, God is a protector. It's
[1:03:57] it's protection. And and I thank God for
[1:04:01] his protection. Amen. You see, God
[1:04:03] doesn't want us to be anxious. He
[1:04:06] doesn't want us to worry. He doesn't
[1:04:08] want us to be fearful and and about
[1:04:12] anything uh for uh he's promised to take
[1:04:15] care of us. Now Hebrews 13:5 it says,
[1:04:19] "Let your conversation be without
[1:04:22] covetness and be content with such
[1:04:25] things as you have. For he hath said, I
[1:04:28] will never leave thee." Aren't you glad
[1:04:31] for that?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly
[1:04:36] say, "The Lord is my helper." Amen. That
[1:04:39] we can boldly say, I mean, he's letting
[1:04:42] us know that he'll never leave us nor
[1:04:44] forsake us. that we can boldly say, "The
[1:04:48] Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
[1:04:52] what man shall do unto me." Amen. We can
[1:04:56] say it whether we're on the mountain top
[1:04:58] and everything is going good, or we CAN
[1:05:00] STILL SAY IT BOLDLY when we're facing
[1:05:03] our our challenges in life. Amen. The
[1:05:07] Lord is my helper. Last Sunday, I
[1:05:10] believe we talked about our enemy and
[1:05:13] and uh that we're dealing with. And you
[1:05:16] know, your enemy is not uh is not a
[1:05:19] person uh maybe that is spiteful towards
[1:05:23] you or uh uh hateful or uh uh whatever
[1:05:28] that that's not the enemy. and and uh
[1:05:32] you know uh I I know it's hard to
[1:05:35] believe that especially when you're
[1:05:36] dealing with people that's got rude uh
[1:05:38] manners and and uh uh they're hateful
[1:05:42] and they're arrogant and attitudes and
[1:05:44] and all of these things and you know uh
[1:05:48] I see people in the world and even with
[1:05:52] within Christendom and I I I really am
[1:05:55] amazed of how they act and and and how
[1:05:58] what they do you know it's uh It's an
[1:06:01] amazing thing. But but they aren't the
[1:06:04] enemy. They they aren't the enemy. Uh uh
[1:06:07] people, you know, we're we're looking in
[1:06:09] an evil age and people are becoming more
[1:06:12] evil and and uh uh becoming more ungodly
[1:06:16] as time goes. And you know, and then
[1:06:19] this is a prophetic uh thing. In Luke
[1:06:22] 12:53, Jesus foretold of this day,
[1:06:25] saying, "The father shall be divided
[1:06:28] against the son, and the son against the
[1:06:30] father, the mother against the daughter,
[1:06:32] and the daughter against the mother, the
[1:06:34] mother-in-law against her
[1:06:35] daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law
[1:06:37] against her mother-in-law, and and all
[1:06:40] of these things." In other words, Jesus
[1:06:42] is basically saying, "People will not
[1:06:45] have any love for one another." Amen.
[1:06:48] And and so therefore,
[1:06:51] this is what causes arguments to arise
[1:06:54] even more quicker than it was back back
[1:06:57] in the days. Uh this is what causes more
[1:07:00] bitterness and uh dis assimulations and
[1:07:03] and things like that. Look at the
[1:07:06] divorce rate today. It's far greater
[1:07:09] today than it was in any other age.
[1:07:12] Amen. And and the prophet said, "See,
[1:07:15] today, you know, the love is so hard to
[1:07:18] find." Well, the Bible said there come a
[1:07:21] time when there wouldn't even be love
[1:07:25] for one another. The father would be
[1:07:27] against the mother and mother against
[1:07:29] father and children against parents and
[1:07:32] so forth. And the only love would be
[1:07:35] left would just be between the elect.
[1:07:38] And that's about right. Love is a scarce
[1:07:41] thing today. See, and and and so uh uh
[1:07:46] but but then Jesus would tell us, "By
[1:07:48] this shall all men know that you are my
[1:07:52] disciples is that you have love one for
[1:07:56] another." A ain't that right? So then
[1:07:58] there there is a a quality among the
[1:08:01] children of God and that's divine love.
[1:08:05] Amen. Love conquers. How many believes
[1:08:07] that love conquers? Uh uh uh I I know
[1:08:11] the the the world today is uh you know
[1:08:15] their idea is blow people up, blow
[1:08:17] nations up, you know uh uh hang them,
[1:08:21] shoot them, uh uh put them in prison and
[1:08:25] and do away with them and and it's just
[1:08:28] a constant. You read it in the news.
[1:08:30] It's it's a hate. It's a it's a spiteful
[1:08:34] thing. even to the point that if someone
[1:08:36] disagrees uh uh with people, they
[1:08:40] assassinate him. I think of this uh uh
[1:08:42] Kirk u uh whatever his name was uh that
[1:08:46] got assassinated a few months ago and
[1:08:48] the man didn't do squat. He did not do
[1:08:50] nothing. He didn't lift a a finger to
[1:08:53] hurt no one. He just he just voiced his
[1:08:56] opinions. Uh uh and and the people that
[1:09:00] that that he was talking about their
[1:09:03] beliefs, Amen. didn't agree with him.
[1:09:05] They hated him enough to kill him. It
[1:09:09] was just an assassination. See, and and
[1:09:12] so but but it's happening. But but love
[1:09:15] conquers. And I'm so glad that we had a
[1:09:17] prophet, a man, NOT ONLY TO TELL US
[1:09:20] these things, but to show us how how how
[1:09:24] love does. It conquered the bull that
[1:09:27] time that was going to kill brother
[1:09:28] Brandham. Brother Bradom says, "Instead
[1:09:30] of hating that bull, it seems strange,
[1:09:33] but I loved him." Amen. Loving an
[1:09:36] animal. A ain't that right? Ain't that
[1:09:38] amazing? It's going to kill him. Amen.
[1:09:41] Now, uh uh he says, "I just wished I
[1:09:44] could explain it." But it we find also
[1:09:47] that it was love that subdued that demon
[1:09:50] uh that was upon that man in Portland,
[1:09:53] Oregon that was going to kill brother
[1:09:54] Brandham. It it was love. And he says,
[1:09:57] "I didn't hate the man. I loved him. I
[1:10:00] felt sorry for him. That man was bound."
[1:10:04] Can you say amen? See, so a prophet
[1:10:06] wasn't looking at the man. He was
[1:10:09] looking at a demon that was upon that
[1:10:11] man that was causing that man to do
[1:10:14] those things. See, but it also love
[1:10:17] conquered that that that spirit of
[1:10:20] blindness that was upon that Hispanic
[1:10:22] man. Amen. when when he come in, you
[1:10:25] know, uh to the prayer line, I believe,
[1:10:27] and the man didn't have no shoes, didn't
[1:10:29] have a coat, and and just oh, poor uh uh
[1:10:33] uh man, but he was blind. And brother
[1:10:35] Brandham thought, man, if if I had
[1:10:36] shoes, I'd give it to him. He said it
[1:10:38] reminded me of my dad, you know, this
[1:10:40] man did. And he said, if I had my shoes,
[1:10:43] if they would have fit, I I would have
[1:10:45] somehow slipped them off so the audience
[1:10:47] wouldn't see it and I would have given
[1:10:48] it to him. And I would have given him my
[1:10:50] colt. He said, I couldn't do nothing.
[1:10:52] And he SAID, "I JUST BEGAN TO HUG him
[1:10:54] and weep and and and the man began to
[1:10:57] say, I can see. I can see what was it?"
[1:11:00] It was divine love. Amen. That conquered
[1:11:03] that spirit. Now, Brother Brandham says,
[1:11:05] "Let me tell you something, brother.
[1:11:07] You'll never come in contact with a
[1:11:09] greater force in this life than love."
[1:11:13] Yes, sir. He says, "I do not try to
[1:11:15] conquer demons by kicking them. I just
[1:11:18] love God." Love is what God is. God is
[1:11:22] love. Love moves God. God so loved the
[1:11:26] world. See? Amen. See, it's love. Love
[1:11:30] is what conquers. Ain't that right? See,
[1:11:34] but we find that that that love it.
[1:11:37] We're dealing with a a a greater enemy.
[1:11:40] Amen. Than just the natural. Amen. Uh u
[1:11:45] uh and and and we find that Satan
[1:11:47] anoints people and he even anoints
[1:11:50] animals. Amen. At times to cause havoc,
[1:11:53] you know, that's what he done in the
[1:11:55] garden of of Eden. He got on on that
[1:11:57] serpent. Amen. And and caused havoc. AND
[1:12:01] THE PROPHET SAYS THAT IF the devil can't
[1:12:03] get you one way, he will try another.
[1:12:07] Amen. So you just remember that if he
[1:12:09] can't get you one way, he's going to go
[1:12:11] the back door and try another way. If he
[1:12:14] can't get you that way, he's going to
[1:12:15] come another way. He's constantly coming
[1:12:18] at us to try to get us. Can you say
[1:12:21] amen? Now, we see that evil people and
[1:12:25] and and brother Brandham called them
[1:12:26] evil people. Uh uh and and the reason
[1:12:30] why is they're given over to demons.
[1:12:32] That that's that's it. And and but
[1:12:35] they're multiplying daily. Evil acts are
[1:12:38] being committed on a daily basis. You
[1:12:41] know, when I was a kid, you never heard
[1:12:43] of murder hardly. I mean, every once in
[1:12:45] a while you did uh every once in a while
[1:12:47] you heard of a kidnapping here and there
[1:12:50] and it was such a tragedy. I I I
[1:12:52] remember you know that Susan Smith maybe
[1:12:55] some of you remember. Amen. Where she
[1:12:58] said that her children a kidnapper had
[1:13:00] come and got her children and man it it
[1:13:03] moved the nation and and people from all
[1:13:06] over was searching for them two
[1:13:08] children. Found out she pushed her car
[1:13:10] in the lake and drowned them boys. Amen.
[1:13:13] And I I I remember what it done to me,
[1:13:15] but I remember what it how it done how
[1:13:17] the world it impacted this nation that
[1:13:20] some mother would do that. But you
[1:13:23] hardly ever heard them things. But now
[1:13:25] you're hearing it constantly. It It's
[1:13:27] constantly evil is multiplying, evil
[1:13:31] acts being committed. It's got to where
[1:13:34] children of all ages, now when I say of
[1:13:36] all ages, a six-year-old shooting their
[1:13:39] teacher, uh, uh, bringing a gun to
[1:13:42] school, but but children of all ages are
[1:13:45] committing heinous crimes and and things
[1:13:48] like that. But, BUT I I'D SAY THIS, they
[1:13:51] aren't the real enemy, right? They
[1:13:54] aren't the real enemy. We can look at
[1:13:56] these these these uh uh uh murderers and
[1:14:00] perverts and and all this and we could
[1:14:02] say, "Man, that guy ought to die. That
[1:14:05] guy ought to." Now, I understand a
[1:14:07] person's got to pay for their sins, but
[1:14:09] but you know, even brother Brandham
[1:14:11] said, "No man deserves to die." Now, you
[1:14:13] think of that no man deserves to die.
[1:14:15] Amen. And what he is talking about is
[1:14:17] that man's got a soul. Amen. that if if
[1:14:20] THAT SOUL COULD EVER BE CHANGED, that
[1:14:23] man wouldn't do what he's doing. That
[1:14:25] man would change. Can you say amen? But
[1:14:28] see, the the people is not the real
[1:14:31] enemy. Amen. Uh um uh that's why Jesus
[1:14:35] said, "Bless those that persecute you
[1:14:37] because they're not the real enemy."
[1:14:40] It's it it's a total different
[1:14:42] battlefield. It's a totally uh different
[1:14:45] uh thing, amen, that we're facing. See,
[1:14:48] BUT BUT WE FIND THAT PEOPLE HAVE COME
[1:14:51] under the influence of a demonic spirit
[1:14:55] and it causes them to act that way. You
[1:14:59] know, the prophet said demons are
[1:15:01] powerless unless they are embodied.
[1:15:04] Amen. Another place he says demons have
[1:15:07] must have a place, a body or they're
[1:15:11] helpless.
[1:15:13] Can you say amen? Amen. See, they must
[1:15:16] have a place, a body, or they're
[1:15:18] helpless. And and and we see that in the
[1:15:22] case in with the story of the man of
[1:15:24] Geria. Here he was uh uh possessed of of
[1:15:28] many many many many demons. Amen. And
[1:15:31] and um uh they were destroying this
[1:15:34] man's life where he had cut himself and
[1:15:36] he was found naked out in the tombs. And
[1:15:40] and and and you know I that's something
[1:15:42] that brother Brandham really told us is
[1:15:44] that these spirits spirits always take
[1:15:48] you they dwell among the tombs. Amen.
[1:15:51] They dwell among the dead and and that's
[1:15:54] why uh uh uh the denomination has become
[1:15:58] a habitation of devils. Amen. Brother
[1:16:01] Ramon says they're they're tombs. Amen.
[1:16:04] They're they're just dead tombs. Can you
[1:16:06] say amen? And the moment you become dead
[1:16:09] in your life, Amen. Uh uh that's where
[1:16:13] devils hang out. Amen. See, and and so
[1:16:17] uh but BUT WE FIND THAT these demons uh
[1:16:20] uh when Jesus came, they said, "Why why
[1:16:23] have you come to torment us before our
[1:16:25] time?" In other WORDS, WE HAVEN'T
[1:16:27] DESTROYED this man all the way yet.
[1:16:29] Amen. We ain't finished with this man
[1:16:31] yet. Amen. But but but we find that
[1:16:33] Jesus told him, you know, uh uh well,
[1:16:36] they knew they were going to go, you
[1:16:37] know, and they begged Jesus. Brother
[1:16:39] Brown said they begged Jesus, amen, to
[1:16:42] let them go in that swine, heard a
[1:16:45] swine, amen, that was in the field.
[1:16:48] Amen. And and uh because that Jesus
[1:16:52] wouldn't permit them in a human body.
[1:16:55] Amen. And and so you we know what they
[1:16:58] did. Jesus says, "Go." And they went
[1:17:00] into them swine and and they what did
[1:17:03] they do? They caused them swine. Drove
[1:17:06] them swine off of the cliff. Amen. Now
[1:17:09] he would have done it to that person.
[1:17:11] They would have done it to that man. But
[1:17:13] Jesus wouldn't let him do it to that
[1:17:14] man. He done it to them swine. Amen. You
[1:17:17] find people jumping off of buildings and
[1:17:20] and jumping off this and jumping off
[1:17:22] that, ending their life. It's them
[1:17:25] spirits.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Yes sir.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen. He says, "Now remember
[1:17:32] friends, when evil spirits are leaving
[1:17:35] these people, now he's talking about in
[1:17:37] the church." Now when these spirits are
[1:17:40] leaving these people, they're loose in
[1:17:42] the building. Amen. If you come up in a
[1:17:46] few days showing some kind of a
[1:17:48] sickness, remember it's not my fault.
[1:17:50] Now, now you know the way of brother
[1:17:52] Brandham, he always told everybody to be
[1:17:54] reverent. And he told everybody to keep
[1:17:57] their eyes closed. Keep your head bowed.
[1:17:59] Keep your eyes closed because we're
[1:18:02] dealing with spirits. Ain't that right?
[1:18:04] Amen. Now, there were people out there
[1:18:06] that thought, "Oh, that's just old man
[1:18:07] fuddy duddy. He ain't knowing what I'm
[1:18:09] doing." And so now he's telling them now
[1:18:12] and he's trying to warn them. Now, you
[1:18:14] you remember friends, I'm not
[1:18:17] responsible. But when this spirit goes
[1:18:19] out of this individual, it's loose in
[1:18:22] this building. Amen. And so if you show
[1:18:25] up sick and and and he's saying, "I
[1:18:27] ain't my fault. I told you what to do."
[1:18:29] A ain't that right. Amen. See, and so
[1:18:32] God's always a protector. Ain't that
[1:18:34] right? Amen. See, it protects the
[1:18:37] believer. So he says, "See, for you're
[1:18:39] for he" He said, "Remember, it's not my
[1:18:41] fault for you are supposed to do as I
[1:18:43] tell you here. Every spirit in the
[1:18:46] building is subject right now. Now, can
[1:18:49] you imagine a man standing there so
[1:18:52] anointed that it did not matter what
[1:18:54] spirit was in that building, every
[1:18:57] spirit was subject to his words.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Every spirit, he says, is subject right
[1:19:03] now. And demons, as soon as they come
[1:19:06] out, they'll find some place to go.
[1:19:10] Amen. Why? because they have to have a
[1:19:14] body in order to work. So spirits just
[1:19:17] doesn't just go randomly and just hang
[1:19:20] out. They've got to find somebody.
[1:19:23] They're looking for somebody they can
[1:19:25] enter and use for their purpose. Amen.
[1:19:28] So he says, "So be reverent." Now, if I
[1:19:31] didn't know what I was speaking of,
[1:19:32] you'd take my word. See those feelings,
[1:19:35] I feel them as they're still pressing,
[1:19:38] moving in the building like that. And
[1:19:40] all at once they're closed. They're
[1:19:43] gone. See? See? And so uh uh I don't
[1:19:46] know where they went. So he's talking
[1:19:48] about these demons. He says, "I feel
[1:19:49] them and and and these things, but all
[1:19:52] of a sudden they're gone. I don't know
[1:19:53] where they went." See, and if you're an
[1:19:56] unbeliever and and are disobedient,
[1:19:59] you're very much receptical to them.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You become receptible uh uh uh uh
[1:20:07] receptacle to demon powers. Can you say
[1:20:09] amen? Amen. So now, so then we find that
[1:20:13] when the that power is cast out, then
[1:20:17] that demon will go somewhere. If if he
[1:20:21] can if he can get somewhere, he'll he
[1:20:23] he'll go. So we're dealing with a real
[1:20:27] enemy, and that's Satan and his demonic
[1:20:30] spirit.
[1:20:31] Brother Brandon talks about two ushers
[1:20:33] that were standing, one on one side, one
[1:20:35] on the other, I believe. And and and uh
[1:20:38] they were right there with him, when he
[1:20:40] cast out an epileptic spirit. Amen. And
[1:20:44] uh he said when he cast that spirit out,
[1:20:47] he said immediately these deacons fell
[1:20:49] out. They fell down. One fell backwards,
[1:20:52] one fell forward. Amen. See what
[1:20:55] happened? That spirit got them. Got on
[1:20:57] them. And he says, and it wasn't but
[1:21:00] just a little couple days later, they
[1:21:03] found a a nice businesswoman. Uh
[1:21:07] apparently she was in that building or
[1:21:09] something to that effect. But uh uh they
[1:21:12] found her uh a businesswoman of that
[1:21:15] city out in front of a hotel froing like
[1:21:18] a mad mad dog. Amen. In front of a
[1:21:22] hotel. Amen. See, and he says, "What was
[1:21:24] it?" The power of hell was liberated and
[1:21:27] the demons will go from one to another.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Listen another place.
[1:21:34] Listen. Remember this is casting out
[1:21:37] Satan. Amen. Casting out Satan. Ain't
[1:21:41] that what the church is to do? Cast
[1:21:43] Satan out. Cast him out. With my Bible
[1:21:46] over my heart, friends, it's casting out
[1:21:48] powers that's bound those people. And
[1:21:51] whenever that power is cast out, that
[1:21:54] demon will go somewhere if he can get
[1:21:57] somewhere. Ain't that right? Now, to
[1:22:00] think of that, if if the demonic powers
[1:22:02] are real, Amen. It is in this age that
[1:22:06] 200,000 demons have been have have been
[1:22:10] loosed from the uh uh uh the river
[1:22:13] Euphrates. As as the prophet talks about
[1:22:16] I I believe in the feast of the
[1:22:18] trumpets, these demons are destructive.
[1:22:21] Are do you believe that?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; They are.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Well, where are they at? In people.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; They anoint people. Amen. What caused
[1:22:30] Hitler and Mussolini and Stalin to do
[1:22:33] what they did to the Jews? It was them
[1:22:35] spirits
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; that were loosed. Amen. And and brother
[1:22:39] Rams tells us, amen, that these these
[1:22:42] spirits and their characteristics were
[1:22:45] were were displayed through these these
[1:22:48] dictators and and look what they done uh
[1:22:51] uh to the Jews. It was horrendous.
[1:22:53] KILLED WHAT? 6 AND A half million Jews.
[1:22:57] Amen. But it was it was not those men.
[1:23:00] It was demon powers that had caused
[1:23:03] these men to do that. But now these
[1:23:06] demonic spirits are loosed in the in
[1:23:09] ecclesiastical realm. That's what the
[1:23:11] prophet said. They're loosed in the
[1:23:13] ecclesiastical. Ecclesiastical refers to
[1:23:16] religion according to Webster relating
[1:23:19] to a church especially as an established
[1:23:23] institution.
[1:23:25] And then he's got the word paple. Amen.
[1:23:28] And and so we we see this is what's
[1:23:31] bringing on the world council of
[1:23:32] churches. This is what's bringing on.
[1:23:34] Amen. The great tribulation is demon
[1:23:38] powers have been set loose not only in
[1:23:42] the political world. Amen. And and
[1:23:45] dictators and such, but they're they're
[1:23:47] turned loose in the ecclesiastical
[1:23:51] realm. Can you say amen? Now, first
[1:23:55] Peter 5:8, it says be sober. He's
[1:23:57] talking to the believer. Be sober. Be
[1:24:01] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:24:04] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:24:07] seeking whom he may devour.
[1:24:10] Ain't that right?
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; He's the one that seeks to kill, steal,
[1:24:15] and destroy.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his purpose. He if if if
[1:24:20] you have any joy of God, he's out to
[1:24:23] destroy that. If if you have any ounce
[1:24:27] of love of God, I'm not talking the
[1:24:29] human love. I'm talking about love of
[1:24:30] God. He's out to attack that, to destroy
[1:24:33] that. He He wants to destroy your faith.
[1:24:36] He wants to destroy your confession.
[1:24:38] Amen. He wants to take every and strip
[1:24:41] you of everything to where you're
[1:24:44] nothing. You understand? Amen. To where
[1:24:47] you don't depict a Christian. You don't
[1:24:49] reflect Christianity. You don't reflect
[1:24:52] nothing but the world. Amen. See, well,
[1:24:55] that's what he wants to do. Amen. Now,
[1:24:58] Satan's kingdom is the kingdom of
[1:25:01] darkness. Amen. And his power is the
[1:25:05] power of darkness. That's that's that's
[1:25:08] what it is. His influence is the
[1:25:10] influence of darkness. Brother Brandham
[1:25:13] described a demon that he was seeing and
[1:25:16] he described it as a dark, hideous
[1:25:19] thing. Now, Brother Brham saw these
[1:25:21] spirits
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; and and and so that's how he described,
[1:25:25] you know, one at times he would describe
[1:25:28] a demon to be a a dark spirit of
[1:25:31] unbelief. After praying for a woman that
[1:25:34] had cancer, he told her that the cancer
[1:25:36] had left her for he saw a dark spirit
[1:25:41] rise from her. And that's how he knew
[1:25:44] that that cancer had left because that
[1:25:47] dark spirit had had risen from her had
[1:25:51] let go. Amen. He described a deaf spirit
[1:25:54] as as a cold dark shadow. Amen. It it's
[1:26:01] it's spirits of darkness. That's that's
[1:26:04] what it is. Uh uh I think he was praying
[1:26:07] for that uh one girl that had backslid
[1:26:09] and ended up in the bar. Uh Netty or
[1:26:13] something to that effect. But she come,
[1:26:15] brother Brandon said, "Oh, I messed up."
[1:26:16] And da da da. And so, Brother Brandon
[1:26:18] prayed for her and as he was praying, he
[1:26:21] said something dark like a bat uh wing
[1:26:25] come rose out of her and went to the
[1:26:28] couch and and you remember that and that
[1:26:31] drunk, you know, uh he was sitting over
[1:26:33] there and he it scared him so bad he
[1:26:36] took off, you know, and and you know,
[1:26:38] they brother Brandon said he was just
[1:26:40] young and they they got the the the kind
[1:26:43] of got the cushions off the couch trying
[1:26:45] to find what where it went, But see, it
[1:26:47] was something dark. It was just uh uh
[1:26:50] but he saw these things and and and you
[1:26:53] know, if if I can say it without um uh
[1:26:58] uh but but no doubt that that some of
[1:27:00] these people had the Holy Ghost that
[1:27:03] brother Brandham's talking about, you
[1:27:05] know, uh uh dealing, you know, that was
[1:27:08] causing their body to function abnormal.
[1:27:12] uh you know, brother Brandham stops a
[1:27:14] person a prayer line to take, you know,
[1:27:17] to talk to a woman in the audience who
[1:27:19] was dealing with the kidney trouble and
[1:27:21] he tells her her kidney trouble had left
[1:27:24] her. Notice then immediately
[1:27:27] he says, you know, this this kidney
[1:27:29] trouble left you. And immediately he
[1:27:31] starts talking to another woman and he's
[1:27:33] saying, huh, strange kidney trouble,
[1:27:36] too. He said, "See that devil tried to
[1:27:38] get between them two women there just
[1:27:41] then. One warned the other one." See,
[1:27:45] now he's dealing in the spirit world.
[1:27:47] One spirit's deal warning this other
[1:27:50] one. See? And he says, "Just as soon as
[1:27:53] I mentioned you, it went right to that
[1:27:56] woman there, come back and forth, and I
[1:27:59] seen that dark streak leading over and I
[1:28:03] seen what her trouble was. come right
[1:28:06] back and you got the same thing.
[1:28:08] Frankly, you haven't got but one but
[1:28:11] just a half of a kidney. Your left one's
[1:28:14] gone. Your right one is only half. Do
[1:28:17] you want to go back south from here and
[1:28:19] go? Well, you do. He's all right, Miss
[1:28:22] Dobs. You can go back home and be healed
[1:28:25] then if you'll believe with all your
[1:28:26] heart. See, but what was it? It was
[1:28:28] spirits that was in these women. It
[1:28:31] wasn't that they were sinners or
[1:28:33] whatever. It was a spirit tacking in the
[1:28:36] physical realm. Uh, ain't that right?
[1:28:40] Brother Bram said, "If there's any
[1:28:41] sickness, maybe you got something I
[1:28:44] don't know. Maybe you got cancer. Maybe
[1:28:46] you got some kind of female trouble. I
[1:28:49] don't know what it is, but whatever it
[1:28:50] is, that's a disease, which is the devil
[1:28:53] of darkness. It's of darkness. It's not
[1:28:57] of light. Sickness, everybody say
[1:29:00] sickness is of darkness."
[1:29:03] Amen. Sickness is of darkness to kill
[1:29:06] you.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Many time he would pray for a deaf man.
[1:29:11] He say or a deaf person. He say, "Oh
[1:29:13] Lord, you know this this spirit of
[1:29:16] deafness is upon this man to cause him
[1:29:20] to step out in front of a vehicle and
[1:29:23] kill him premature." Yeah.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; So, so even uh just Satan would or or
[1:29:30] the prophet discerned the purpose of
[1:29:32] these things.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. This this dark spirit, he puts
[1:29:36] cancer on a person to kill them. He
[1:29:39] puts, YOU KNOW, HEART TROUBLE, HEART
[1:29:40] DISEASE. He uh to kill, he he causes
[1:29:44] kidneys to malfunction, to kill. He
[1:29:47] causes congestive heart failure. He
[1:29:50] causes strokes. He causes Parkinson's
[1:29:53] and and all that. But it's intent. It's
[1:29:55] it's destructive.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; But we find that the word of God. Amen.
[1:30:04] God says, "I am the God that healeth all
[1:30:07] thy diseases."
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I'm the GOD THAT HEALETH ALL. SO, so
[1:30:13] whatever the attack is in your in your
[1:30:16] body, there is a protection.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; GOD IS OUR PROTECTION. YES.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; But but it's a it's a darkness. What
[1:30:29] what causes people to become critics of
[1:30:31] the message?
[1:30:32] It's it's a spirit of darkness.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said to a man in the
[1:30:37] prayer line and says, "If you had been a
[1:30:39] critic or something, it would have been
[1:30:41] a dark shadow moving in there." Now,
[1:30:44] think of that. Amen. Because he could
[1:30:47] see. He could see in the spirit realm.
[1:30:50] He's telling them if if if you if you
[1:30:54] were a critic, I'd see darkness moving
[1:30:56] around you. But he said you're a
[1:30:58] believer and there's light there. Amen.
[1:31:01] Aren't you glad for that? So So I hope
[1:31:04] you understand that that the spirit's
[1:31:06] influence and they're that you know they
[1:31:09] they're just around there. Sinners uh
[1:31:11] are shadowed by darkness.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand many times would tell a
[1:31:16] man or woman uh you're not a Christian.
[1:31:19] And he says, "I see darkness around
[1:31:20] you."
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because the spirit of
[1:31:24] darkness is is an influencing the
[1:31:28] individuals
[1:31:30] when uh you know uh uh so you know,
[1:31:33] brother Brown said, "A man can wait in
[1:31:35] sin until his soul becomes as black as
[1:31:37] the smuty wolves of hell." Amen. But if
[1:31:40] if that man will accept Jesus Christ as
[1:31:43] a savior, he then finds protection.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:50] from that dark spirit.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; FOR THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HE HAS WASHED
[1:31:54] US, loosed us by his own blood.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that protection?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Then that man will become a new
[1:32:06] creature, and old things passed away,
[1:32:09] and behold, all things become new. Ain't
[1:32:12] that right? Amen.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "No longer is he uh
[1:32:16] of the dark, but he's of the day."
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. See,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; so he says, "Now the children of the
[1:32:24] world, notice the children of the world
[1:32:27] walk in darkness. They walk at
[1:32:30] nighttime. They love darkness." Can you
[1:32:32] say amen? Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; John uh 3:19 says, "And this is the
[1:32:37] condemnation that light is come into the
[1:32:41] world and men love darkness rather than
[1:32:43] light because their deeds were evil."
[1:32:47] So, Satan's kingdom is of darkness. He
[1:32:50] works in darkness and he's of the
[1:32:53] darkness. And uh uh he talks about the
[1:32:56] the the deeds that were evil and and and
[1:33:00] Jesus says their their evil deeds are
[1:33:03] unfruitful works of darkness. Ain't that
[1:33:07] right?
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And and so they love darkness rather
[1:33:10] than light. You know, I I realize that
[1:33:13] Jesus is referring to the spiritual
[1:33:15] darkness and how they love that type of
[1:33:17] a darkness, but did you know that that
[1:33:20] it's also carried out in the natural
[1:33:24] uh the natural uh uh world, natural
[1:33:27] realm?
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And it seems that evil acts are
[1:33:31] committed most at nighttime. Have you
[1:33:34] ever just had your sickness and it seems
[1:33:36] like you get it get more bothered by
[1:33:39] that at nighttime? Uh you could have a
[1:33:42] sore throat or whatever. Maybe not as
[1:33:45] bad in the daytime, but as night begins
[1:33:47] to progress, maybe fever starts getting
[1:33:50] higher and and the throat starts hurting
[1:33:53] and uh more and and these things. Uh but
[1:33:57] but you know, evil acts, they they're
[1:33:59] committed more at nighttime. There's
[1:34:02] some places in the city that you don't
[1:34:03] want to be caught in at at nighttime.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Uh it it it's because evil people seem
[1:34:11] to be boulder at nighttime. Ain't that
[1:34:13] right?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And so why is that? Well, Brother
[1:34:16] Brandham said evil always prowls at
[1:34:20] night.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, they they take uh people
[1:34:24] who take on the the nature of evil
[1:34:28] become night prowlers. They they they
[1:34:31] they seem to like the the darkness and
[1:34:34] the night. You know, a movie star one
[1:34:36] time said that night was made to live
[1:34:38] in. But that's not true. My night was
[1:34:42] made to sleep in.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know, brother Brandham
[1:34:47] or or the Bible says that God separated
[1:34:49] light from darkness. And when he done
[1:34:52] that, there there's different natures uh
[1:34:56] of animals, insects or whatever that
[1:34:59] roam at night.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; They don't like light time.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; And and and and and then there's those
[1:35:06] that uh uh nature that loves light and
[1:35:10] and and they run around in the in in in
[1:35:13] the daytime. things that crawl around at
[1:35:16] night, lizards, snakes, spiders,
[1:35:20] scorpions,
[1:35:22] uh uh you know, roaches, evil things, uh
[1:35:26] creepy things, uh things like that.
[1:35:29] Brother Brown said, "See, they're of the
[1:35:31] kingdom of darkness. They won't
[1:35:34] associate in the daytime with the
[1:35:36] mocking bird and different things
[1:35:38] because they are of darkness. Their
[1:35:41] works are darkness. They're evil things.
[1:35:44] Their life in them is evil. If they bite
[1:35:47] you, it will kill you. If you couldn't
[1:35:50] have some aid right away. See, they have
[1:35:53] fellowship in darkness. He said, "That's
[1:35:55] the reason that people uh uh today, most
[1:35:58] of them sleep half the day and run
[1:36:00] around at night. It's darkness. That's
[1:36:03] when evil is done is in darkness." Ain't
[1:36:07] that right? So, evil starts when the sun
[1:36:11] goes down. Amen. And and the prophet
[1:36:14] said, "Death begins when the sun goes
[1:36:17] down." So the prophet said, he says,
[1:36:20] "Those who prowl at night is evil." Most
[1:36:24] taverns, as we know, most taverns, bars,
[1:36:27] and honky tongs and and all that, that's
[1:36:30] they open up at night. It that becomes a
[1:36:33] a haven, a place to hang out at is is is
[1:36:38] at night. See? And and that's where evil
[1:36:40] acts are committed a lot of times. So,
[1:36:43] brother Brandon says, "Night is very
[1:36:46] evil because it's darkness."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Psalm 74:20 uh and 20 says, "The dark
[1:36:56] places of the earth are full of the
[1:37:00] habitations of cruelty."
[1:37:03] It's darkness. He says, "Night was made
[1:37:06] to rest. The sun goes down. You lay
[1:37:09] down, take your rest, not prowl all
[1:37:11] night and come in at daylight. You're
[1:37:14] you're not supposed to do that. Evil
[1:37:17] things prowl at night. Evil works at
[1:37:19] night. All serpents, lizards, bugs,
[1:37:22] everything travel at nighttime. The
[1:37:24] demon powers prowl at nighttime. See it,
[1:37:29] you know, it was the prophet said it
[1:37:31] was, you know, we read about uh when the
[1:37:34] boat of the disciples about sunk the
[1:37:37] ship, you know, the waves were coming in
[1:37:39] and all that, you know, the prophet said
[1:37:41] that happened at the night time. Amen.
[1:37:43] The devil, he couldn't do anything in
[1:37:45] the day. Jesus was was casting them out
[1:37:49] left and right. See, and he he was
[1:37:51] helpless. He couldn't do nothing. But it
[1:37:54] was at nighttime when the the disciples
[1:37:56] got away from Jesus and and uh uh he
[1:38:00] says Satan got up. Amen. And and uh uh
[1:38:04] uh he says Satan must have come out at
[1:38:07] night time when darkness be to set in.
[1:38:09] He come out of his tormenting pit pits
[1:38:12] looked over the hill and he saw the
[1:38:14] disciples without Jesus. As soon uh he
[1:38:18] says Satan looked over as SOON AS IT GOT
[1:38:20] DARK and he said, "Well, I guess it's
[1:38:21] about time for me to start prowling all
[1:38:24] the nightclubs, honky tons, and
[1:38:25] everything." He said, "I wonder where
[1:38:27] them disciples uh where they are and
[1:38:29] Jesus." And so they looked and as him
[1:38:32] and all of his demons looked there, they
[1:38:34] was out on the sea without him. And
[1:38:37] Satan says, "Now's our chance. They've
[1:38:39] gone off. Now we can get even with
[1:38:42] them." Right? Amen. See, and so it it it
[1:38:45] it's that way. Brother Brandham talks
[1:38:47] about how demons would haunt him at at
[1:38:50] at nighttime. Amen. During the night,
[1:38:54] he'd cast out demons that uh uh from the
[1:38:57] people and so they would come back to
[1:38:59] his room wherever he was AND BEGIN TO
[1:39:02] HAUNT HIM. He he would deal with with
[1:39:05] spirits that he had cast out uh during
[1:39:08] that meeting that night. See, it didn't
[1:39:10] bother him as much as in the day. Uh uh
[1:39:14] I'm sure I'm sure he they they bothered
[1:39:16] him in the day, but not as much as the
[1:39:18] night time.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; I find it interesting and I hope this is
[1:39:21] all right and hope it'll help you. But I
[1:39:23] find it interesting that the Bible would
[1:39:26] tell us when Job offered sacrifices,
[1:39:30] what time of day that Job would offer
[1:39:33] sacrifices for his children.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Job 15. And it was so when the
[1:39:40] days of their feasting were gone about
[1:39:43] that Job sent and sanctified them and
[1:39:46] rose up early in the morning.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Now think of that. He rose up early in
[1:39:54] the morning and offered burnt sacrifices
[1:39:57] or offerings according to the number of
[1:40:00] them all. For Job said, "It may be that
[1:40:03] my sons have sinned and cursed God in
[1:40:05] their heart." Thus did Job continually.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; If you read Psalms 53,
[1:40:14] it says, "My voice shalt thou hear in
[1:40:17] the
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; morning."
[1:40:21] Y'all's not reading them, are you? I
[1:40:23] don't know what's happened. But my voice
[1:40:26] shalt thou hear in the morning, oh Lord,
[1:40:30] in the morning will I direct my prayer
[1:40:33] unto thee and will look up. Psalm 63:1,
[1:40:39] "Oh God, thou art my God, early,"
[1:40:43] everybody say,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; early
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; will I seek thee. Yes.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Now, see, there's something about in the
[1:40:52] mornings when all the demons have gone
[1:40:55] to bed.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said that's that's
[1:40:59] there's a change in the mornings.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; He said because it's the demons, they've
[1:41:04] gone to bed, the morning is quiet, you
[1:41:08] can you can there there's a different
[1:41:10] atmosphere. He would tell us the dew is
[1:41:13] on the ground. It just seems a
[1:41:15] freshness.
[1:41:17] He said, "You can walk out early of the
[1:41:19] morning in that stillness and quietness
[1:41:21] of the morning. The dew has brought the
[1:41:23] fragrance of the flowers. It's
[1:41:25] refreshing to come out into such an
[1:41:28] atmosphere."
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "I think a minister ought to
[1:41:32] come to the platform not loaded down
[1:41:34] with a lot of care, but out of freshness
[1:41:37] of the presence of the Lord. Get out
[1:41:39] early of a morning after all the demons
[1:41:42] have gone to bed and the night rallies
[1:41:44] about over. Then it settles down and
[1:41:46] gets quiet and smell that aroma, the
[1:41:49] sweetness.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; See, so so now if if demons, demonic
[1:41:57] spirits roam about in natural darkness,
[1:42:00] then then what about in spiritual
[1:42:02] darkness?
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; See, and so this is why the scripture is
[1:42:09] so important to know our day and why a
[1:42:12] prophet would really deal with that. And
[1:42:14] that's in Isaiah 60 and2 where it says
[1:42:17] darkness. It talks about darkness
[1:42:20] covering the earth and gross darkness
[1:42:22] the people.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Darkness covering the earth and gross
[1:42:27] darkness the people.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; It seems like Satan in this age is
[1:42:32] having more heyday, more liberty.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; More free at self-will to do what he
[1:42:39] wants.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH. BUT IT TELLS US WE'RE LIVING IN A
[1:42:44] DARK HOUR.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; It it it's darkness that's covered the
[1:42:49] earth. Gross darkness. The people.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; GO LISTEN TO TO SHALOM. BROTHER RAB said
[1:42:57] they're NICE PEOPLE.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES them color their hair
[1:43:02] different?
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Blue, pink, purple.
[1:43:07] What makes them do that? Spirits. It's a
[1:43:11] darkness.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT'S MAKING THIS THIS HATE
[1:43:18] IT IN AMONGST THE PEOPLE? IT'S A SPIRIT
[1:43:21] OF DARKNESS.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Why are they using words uh curse words
[1:43:29] so much? They're just more free. Used to
[1:43:32] you you couldn't find. It was just wrong
[1:43:35] to do curse words. I if if you went and
[1:43:38] heard curse words, a lot of times you'd
[1:43:39] have to do it on a job construction
[1:43:41] site, no tough men sellers and you know
[1:43:44] going to carnivals and you you know
[1:43:46] that's where I learned my first cuss
[1:43:48] word.
[1:43:49] We went to a carnival and I went home.
[1:43:52] We got in the car and I said, "Well,
[1:43:54] blank you.
[1:43:56] My dad about died. He we about wrecked,
[1:44:01] man. He about whooped that devil off of
[1:44:04] me." I'm like, "Dad, I" He go, "Where
[1:44:06] did you get that?" I said, "That guy
[1:44:08] over there that was running the
[1:44:10] machine." I heard him say that. Don't
[1:44:12] you ever say that again. You know, uh
[1:44:15] but but you just never Now our president
[1:44:18] says it a lot of times.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; It it's just common.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Adulteries are just so common.
[1:44:27] Homosexuals coming out of the woodwork,
[1:44:29] man.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:32] Churches are allowing it now. Ministers,
[1:44:35] so-called ministers behind the pulpit,
[1:44:38] homosexuals, transgenders, and and all
[1:44:40] that. What is it? Darkness.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Satan is roaming in the darkness.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And so we see this happening before us.
[1:44:50] Gross darkness uh uh uh the over the
[1:44:54] people, covering the people. Amen. The
[1:44:57] prophet said, "The lid of hell has been
[1:44:58] lifted off and demons are pouring in
[1:45:00] from everywhere."
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; EPHESIANS 6:12, it it it says, "For we
[1:45:06] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[1:45:08] against principalities, against powers,
[1:45:10] against rulers of the darkness of THIS
[1:45:12] WORLD, AGAINST SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN
[1:45:15] HIGH PLACES."
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham said, "Satan is
[1:45:19] always near to try to get something
[1:45:22] fumbled up in your mind."
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Right?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord. You can even be serving
[1:45:28] the Lord
[1:45:30] and and
[1:45:32] sincere, but he's always near to get
[1:45:34] something fumbled up in your mind.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; He does.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Another place says WHEN GOD'S DOING
[1:45:41] SOMETHING, Satan is always present to
[1:45:43] block it or to tear it down or do what
[1:45:46] he can to interrupt it. See, and he
[1:45:48] works in subtle ways.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of God shows a
[1:45:55] comparison between a wolf and Satan. A
[1:45:58] wolf will he will look at a herd and
[1:46:01] he'll find one that will stray from the
[1:46:05] herd.
[1:46:07] And and that's the one and a wolf always
[1:46:10] goes in the pack.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; They know how to hunt. They're very
[1:46:14] subtle when they do it. And the prophet
[1:46:16] begins to talk about it that they
[1:46:18] they've they've got this deer drawn away
[1:46:20] from the from the the rest of the the
[1:46:22] the herd and then they start circling in
[1:46:25] and and that deer may try to run and and
[1:46:29] he says that wolf has got his fangs and
[1:46:31] he will if he can he will reach up there
[1:46:33] and he'll grab that neck and hang on.
[1:46:36] And while he's hanging he's cutting that
[1:46:38] throat. He's cutting that throat. Each
[1:46:40] time he's he's swinging, that throat IS
[1:46:43] BEING CUT UNTIL FINALLY that deer
[1:46:46] falls and before he knows it, that whole
[1:46:50] pack of dogs, wolves have have gotten on
[1:46:54] him.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Now, notice, Brother Brandon types this
[1:46:59] out
[1:47:00] to people
[1:47:02] who who uh uh STRAY FROM THE HOUSE OF
[1:47:08] GOD.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:47:10] HE SAID the believers are the
[1:47:13] protection.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Believers are protection. The church is
[1:47:21] the protection
[1:47:23] amongst the people of God.
[1:47:27] Amen. So he said if Satan can get you
[1:47:30] away from church where you where you get
[1:47:33] the Holy Spirit through the preaching of
[1:47:35] the word, ain't that right? Amen.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; We're washed by the water of the word.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if you get away, start
[1:47:45] staying home from church." Now, I want
[1:47:47] you young people to listen to this. I
[1:47:49] want you parents to listen to this, too.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; You praying for God to help your
[1:47:54] children and then you keeping them from
[1:47:56] church.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Cutting yourself and
[1:48:02] putting band-aids on at the same time?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; I guess.
[1:48:07] Yeah, it's good.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Then you get away. You start staying
[1:48:14] home from church, watching television on
[1:48:16] Wednesday night when you got prayer
[1:48:18] meeting going on. Then you're right on
[1:48:20] your road out.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Now, this is a prophet.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; This is the same one THAT TELLS US ABOUT
[1:48:27] DEMON POWERS AND HOW THEY WORK AND ALL
[1:48:30] OF THAT.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "You're on your road
[1:48:33] out." When your desire becomes more to
[1:48:35] see some television program than it does
[1:48:38] to hear the gospel, there's something
[1:48:40] wrong in your soul.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; So, he talks about the wolves and and
[1:48:46] how that that they work. And he said,
[1:48:48] "Now, SEE, THAT'S THE WAY SATAN does it.
[1:48:51] If he can ever get close enough to you
[1:48:55] to once wrap you in there, the hounds of
[1:48:58] hell will jump right jump right on and
[1:49:02] pick everything there is about you off.
[1:49:04] All your morals, all your decency,
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; all your convictions,
[1:49:11] your love,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; YOUR JOY. HE GONNA STRIP EVERYTHING
[1:49:18] you've got and you'll lay bleached and
[1:49:20] defiled. This is his words. You'll lay
[1:49:23] bleached and defiled before God.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; See, it's it's not good enough
[1:49:36] to say, "Well, last year, you know, the
[1:49:40] Lord really moved for me and I wept. I
[1:49:42] cried.
[1:49:43] What is he doing today?
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; OH, I I WAS SO EXCITED. WHERE'S THAT
[1:49:49] EXCITEMENT AT TODAY?
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; SEE, WHAT IS IT? IT'S IT'S THE HOUNDS OF
[1:49:55] HELL. It's more dangerous than wolves.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; This is the hounds of hell.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, at the time of Passover,
[1:50:08] God showed that the blood of an innocent
[1:50:11] lamb would be used to protect his his
[1:50:15] people from the death angel. Remember,
[1:50:18] God says, "When I see the blood, I'll
[1:50:20] pass over you." See, they needed a
[1:50:23] protection.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; God's wrath was getting ready to be
[1:50:26] poured out. And they needed that
[1:50:28] protection. AND GOD SAYS, "I'LL GIVE YOU
[1:50:31] a protection. That'll be blood."
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't that right?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; AND SO THE PEOPLE HAD TO APPLY THE BLOOD
[1:50:39] on the lentil of the door, the door
[1:50:41] post. Amen. AND THEY HAD TO STAY under
[1:50:44] that blood.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; now, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "IF YOU
[1:50:47] DON'T STAY UNDER THE BLOOD, THE KINGDOMS
[1:50:49] OF SATAN WILL OVERTAKE YOU and carry you
[1:50:53] away if you don't stay under the blood."
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm I'm convinced that people
[1:51:01] aren't staying under the blood.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Sure.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; This world's not staying under the
[1:51:07] blood.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; You see, we keep under the blood through
[1:51:11] the preaching of the word.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And the world didn't want the the word.
[1:51:16] They they didn't want the message of the
[1:51:18] hour.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT WORD TO BE
[1:51:20] RESTORED UNTO THEM.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; But it's through the PREACHING OF THE
[1:51:26] GOSPEL THAT WE STAY UNDER THAT BLOOD.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "The preaching of
[1:51:30] the word brings down the blood veil."
[1:51:33] What is it? It's the bloody bleeding
[1:51:35] word that washes us.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Now, God required a token
[1:51:44] for them and THAT WAS BLOOD. WELL, WHY
[1:51:46] WOULD GOD DO THAT? GO. I was listening
[1:51:49] to the token this morning. Brother Brand
[1:51:50] says it's because the token will keep
[1:51:53] you alive.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? THE TOKEN IS OUR
[1:51:59] PROTECTION. IT KEEPS US ALIVE. IS TO
[1:52:02] PROTECT HIS PEOPLE FROM his wrath.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You see, God's wrath and judgment is a
[1:52:10] horrible thing. You believe that?
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; See, and and so I I'm I'm going to to
[1:52:16] move on. But but we do find that they
[1:52:20] had to stay under the blood and those
[1:52:22] that were outside of the blood, they
[1:52:24] perished. And then the blood had to be
[1:52:27] publicly, everybody say publicly,
[1:52:30] displayed,
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; IT HAD TO BE PUBLICLY DISPLAYED for all
[1:52:35] to see it.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Now, the blood in Hebrews 9:22, Paul
[1:52:40] said, "Without the shedding of blood,
[1:52:43] there is no remission of sins."
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. IF THERE IS NO REMISSION OF
[1:52:50] SINS, THEN SATAN HAS A LEGAL RIGHT over
[1:52:55] us.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. I'm going to try
[1:52:59] I'm going to close here in a minute.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; If there is no remission of sins, then
[1:53:07] Satan has a right
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. to tell us what to do, to
[1:53:12] dictate us, to be able to put anything
[1:53:15] upon us,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; make us do anything he wants,
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; AND IF OUR SINS AREN'T UNDER THE BLOOD,
[1:53:27] we stand as sinners IN GOD'S SIGHT.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD'S wrath is upon us.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:38] Now we find
[1:53:41] the prophet said, "Satan cannot stand
[1:53:43] before the blood." Aren't you glad for
[1:53:46] that?
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now Isaiah 1:18, "Come now, let us
[1:53:50] reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though
[1:53:53] your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
[1:53:54] as white as snow. Though they be red
[1:53:57] like crimson, they shall be white as
[1:53:59] wool." Ain't that right?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; The only way that can happen is the
[1:54:02] blood makes it possible. Brother Bram
[1:54:05] said, "God looking through the blood, he
[1:54:07] doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He
[1:54:11] sees you redeemed."
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; You're redeemed BECAUSE HE ALWAYS SEES
[1:54:16] YOU THROUGH CHRIST.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE REASON WE CAN BE PERFECT. Not
[1:54:22] perfect in the sense of sinless. We're
[1:54:24] perfect in the eyes of God when we're in
[1:54:27] Christ.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S BY THE BLOOD THAT WE STAND
[1:54:31] JUSTIFIED.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:34] Prophet said God required total
[1:54:36] annihilation from sin. See, isn't that a
[1:54:40] word for a Calvinist to say? But that's
[1:54:43] that's right. See, God requires total
[1:54:46] annihilation. And how can you do it as a
[1:54:49] man? You can't. But Christ can for you.
[1:54:53] AND YOU JUST ABIDE IN CHRIST. THAT'S
[1:54:56] ALL. God can't see the sin at all
[1:55:00] because he has to SEE THE BLOOD FIRST.
[1:55:03] AND HE CAN'T SEE through the blood.
[1:55:05] Aren't you GLAD FOR THAT?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; GOD can't see through the blood.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; HE SEES YOU. If he's looking through the
[1:55:15] blood, he sees you white.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; SINLESS.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; SO JUST STAY in Christ.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; That's all. He's now we're we in our
[1:55:27] pilgrimage. We're going to have our ups
[1:55:29] and downs like they did our jubilee
[1:55:30] times that that are up and down, but
[1:55:34] we're on our road.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Now, we know what the token is today
[1:55:40] that God is requiring. It's the only
[1:55:42] time out of the church ages that God
[1:55:45] requiring a token is now in the evening
[1:55:47] time.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; And and
[1:55:50] that token is the life of the lamb. Not
[1:55:53] literal blood, but the life. The life.
[1:55:56] Everybody say the life.
[1:55:58] And and the token is the Holy Spirit.
[1:56:01] It's the seal. Seal signifying ownership
[1:56:06] security.
[1:56:08] Paul says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit
[1:56:10] whereby you are sealed to the day of
[1:56:12] your redemption."
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham said, "You must
[1:56:15] come under this token, God's Holy
[1:56:17] Spirit."
[1:56:19] Don't let your life lay dormant.
[1:56:23] Don't let THE HOLY SPIRIT QUIT operating
[1:56:25] in your life. Yeah.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; I I hope I'm getting it to you the way I
[1:56:29] feel it.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; IT DISPLAYS to you Christ.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT COMES AND lives in you.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; THAT TOKEN, THE HOLY SPIRIT NOW IS
[1:56:44] DISPLAYING itself because it comes and
[1:56:47] lives in you. It shows that Satan has no
[1:56:50] right over you anymore.
[1:56:52] You are an overcomer, not a a victim.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Sin cannot prevail over you. Evil cannot
[1:57:00] overcome you.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Now you say, well then how do we display
[1:57:05] the token? I again listening to brother
[1:57:07] Brandham today and he he he made it so
[1:57:09] simple. He said, you know, if I told you
[1:57:11] that Beethoven or or Shakespeare was
[1:57:14] living in me, I got the spirit of
[1:57:16] Shakespeare. And he said, now he says,
[1:57:18] now there's no way that Shakespeare and
[1:57:21] I could live together because he's a
[1:57:24] poet. I'm a minister.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; So in other for him to live and and
[1:57:30] other words display himself in this
[1:57:32] body, I have to die out to myself.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I have to I have to die out to who I am
[1:57:39] so that he could have preeminence in
[1:57:41] this body. And when he can have
[1:57:43] preeminent in the body, then he says, I
[1:57:46] become a poet.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; HE'S DESCRIBING HOW THAT TOKEN WORKS.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY THAT the token be can BE
[1:57:55] DISPLAYED IS WE'VE GOT TO DIE OUT.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. I'VE GOT THE CARNAL NATURE. I
[1:58:02] DON'T THINK LIKE GOD.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; I DON'T ACT THE WAY GOD WOULD ACT. I'LL
[1:58:07] HANDLE SITUATIONS THE WAY SEAN MARTIN
[1:58:09] WANTS TO HANDLE THEM. BUT IN ORDER FOR
[1:58:12] THE TOKEN TO JUST BE DISPLAYED, SHAWN
[1:58:15] MARTIN'S GOT TO DIE TO HIMSELF.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; AND THEN GOD TAKES OVER THE BODY.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO NOW THE TOKEN HAS TO BE ON
[1:58:29] DISPLAY.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE MESSAGE, NOT
[1:58:33] JUST TALKING ABOUT BEING A CHRISTIAN,
[1:58:35] DISPLAYING THAT TOKEN.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. AND THE TOKEN IS THE
[1:58:40] QUICKENING POWER THAT HAS COME TO US IN
[1:58:43] this day.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRAM SAID, "CHRIST IS THAT
[1:58:46] TOKEN. CHRIST IS THE QUICKENING POWER.
[1:58:49] CHRIST IS THE SEALS."
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS IT ALL. Can you say amen?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why what Paul would say in
[1:58:57] Romans 8:11, "But if the spirit of him
[1:58:59] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:59:01] in you, HE THAT RAISED UP CHRIST FROM
[1:59:03] THE DEAD SHALL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL
[1:59:06] BODIES by his spirit that dwell in you."
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; So the token being on display means it's
[1:59:13] no longer I that liveth, but Christ that
[1:59:15] lives in me.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. So then I want to ask you,
[1:59:23] how can bitterness and hatred and
[1:59:25] division
[1:59:27] prevail over you when divine love is
[1:59:31] having preeminence?
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; True. Come on.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; How you you understand WHAT I'M SAYING?
[1:59:37] HOW HOW CAN FEAR AND UNBELIEF OVERTAKE
[1:59:39] YOU WHEN FAITH IS HAVING THE
[1:59:41] PREEMINENCE? AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:59:43] HUMAN FAITH. I'M TALKING ABOUT DIVINE
[1:59:45] FAITH. I'M TALKING ABOUT A TOKEN BEING
[1:59:48] ON DISPLAY OF DIVINE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; DIVINE IS THE TOKEN. DIVINE GOD.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; THAT DIVINE LIFE IS NOW LIVING in us.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; How can the love of the world possess us
[2:00:05] and dictate us
[2:00:08] when divine holiness
[2:00:11] has taken preeminence in our lives?
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; You love him? Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; See, we're Christians.
[2:00:26] We're not of the darkness. We're of the
[2:00:27] light.
[2:00:29] Remember this gross darkness will cover
[2:00:31] the earth or darkness covering the
[2:00:33] earth. Gross darkness the people. But
[2:00:35] then THE OTHER PROPHECY IS WHAT? ARISE,
[2:00:38] SHINE, FOR THY LIGHT HAS COME.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; THAT TELLS US THAT SATAN CANNOT ROAM AND
[2:00:43] HAVE PREEMINENCE OVER YOU. YOU'RE UNDER
[2:00:46] a light.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; This doesn't mean that,
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; you know, we can that we don't have an
[2:01:00] enemy to deal with. We do have an enemy
[2:01:02] to deal with.
[2:01:04] It doesn't mean that we can dillydally
[2:01:06] around the world and be unscathed.
[2:01:11] Romans 7:21 Paul says, "I find then a
[2:01:14] law that when I would do good, evil is
[2:01:16] present with me. For I delight in the
[2:01:19] law of God after the inward man, but I
[2:01:22] see another law in my members warning
[2:01:24] against the law of my mind and bringing
[2:01:26] me into captivity to the law of sin
[2:01:28] which is in my members." Brother Brown
[2:01:31] said as this, you know, he he's he's
[2:01:33] explaining this scripture, but he says,
[2:01:35] "As long as you're in this life, you're
[2:01:37] going to be sticky and have a carnal
[2:01:38] nature that's going to bother you as
[2:01:40] long as you live. But the inside of you,
[2:01:43] you're born again."
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; And when you're raised up, you're in the
[2:01:49] likeness of Christ and ALL THE SIN IS
[2:01:51] GONE from you. That's the thing.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. So then by having this
[2:01:55] quickening power, this token
[2:01:58] in us and having faith in God's word,
[2:02:03] then we bring our OUTSIDE BODY. HE SAYS
[2:02:07] under subjection to the word by fa by
[2:02:10] accepting what God said.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; How many accepts what God said?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; That's where we're coming to.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; We used to walk after our own ways. We
[2:02:22] used to do what we wanted to do. I want
[2:02:25] you to listen to me now.
[2:02:29] It's the common thing. If someone
[2:02:31] disagrees with you, walk away. If
[2:02:34] someone you know keeps doing WRONG WITH
[2:02:37] YOU, FIGHT BACK.
[2:02:40] IT'S IT'S THE COMMON common thing. Never
[2:02:44] speak that person. NEVER TALK TO THAT
[2:02:45] PERSON. SNOB THAT PERSON. That's common.
[2:02:50] Common thing is if you don't like
[2:02:52] something IN THE CHURCH, START trouble
[2:02:54] in the church. Get your way.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; COMMON THING IS IF YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT
[2:03:01] IS NOT LIVING RIGHT, GO TALK TO THAT
[2:03:03] PERSON OR GO TALK ABOUT THAT PERSON.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; TELL everybody that you what YOU DON'T
[2:03:09] LIKE ABOUT THAT PERSON. THAT'S THE
[2:03:11] COMMON WAY. THAT IS A CARNAL BORN SINFUL
[2:03:14] MAN WAY. THAT'S THE CARNAL NATURE THAT
[2:03:17] WE DEAL WITH. That's right. Amen.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. SIR,
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; THE COMMON WAY, THE SINFUL nature way
[2:03:28] THAT WE THE CARNAL NATURE WAY THAT WE
[2:03:30] DEAL WITH IS WE LOOK TO THE NATURAL
[2:03:33] things
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; to keep our children.
[2:03:42] That's where the church is today. I'm
[2:03:45] not saying that you shouldn't have
[2:03:47] things for the children. We we try, you
[2:03:50] know, as a church or whatever.
[2:03:54] I promise you this looking out to that
[2:03:57] world and let my children hanging around
[2:03:58] with people that are just rotten just
[2:04:00] sinners.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; You won't do that. That's your your
[2:04:04] problem. But you'll deal with that.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. when your your children are
[2:04:08] out there out in the world
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; and they ain't got anything out there to
[2:04:12] keep them
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; and you want to trust in that to bring
[2:04:15] your children to church, keep your
[2:04:17] children like in church. How in the
[2:04:19] world do YOU DO THAT? YOU AIN'T TRYING
[2:04:21] TO RAISING them up to be friends to God.
[2:04:23] You're raising them up to be friends
[2:04:25] WITH THE WORLD BECAUSE you want to be
[2:04:27] friends with them.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; I KNOW IT'S HARD. IT'S hard to text tell
[2:04:36] our young people, AMEN, THE WAYS OF GOD,
[2:04:38] SOMETIMES THEY GET MAD AT US.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; AND LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT'S JUST THE WAY
[2:04:43] IT IS.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; It'd be easy for me to GIVE INTO MY MY
[2:04:50] CHILDREN'S FEELINGS. All my boys, EVERY
[2:04:53] ALL THE TIME THEY were a YOUNG WANTING
[2:04:56] TO GO PLAY BASEBALL, WANTING TO GO PLAY
[2:04:57] SPORTS, WANTING TO GO PLAY THAT, SAID,
[2:04:59] "NOPE, ain't doing it.
[2:05:03] Yeah,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; I knew God HAD SOMETHING FOR THEIR LIFE
[2:05:09] AND I still believe it.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; They may have not understood it, but who
[2:05:13] cares?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I'm looking to a future.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS IT? WE'RE IN A WARFARE.
[2:05:26] RIGHT.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE NATURAL, WE WANT TO JUST DO
[2:05:31] EVERYTHING THAT WE WOULD HAVE DONE IN
[2:05:33] THE WORLD.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; But there's a token.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; That has to be on display.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Can't fight back.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Can't eye for an eye. That ain't That
[2:05:49] ain't the gospel.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; TOOTH FOR A TOOTH. THAT'S NOT THE
[2:05:54] GOSPEL. YEAH.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Divine love is
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; and when that token is displayed,
[2:06:04] there is a divine love that takes over.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; There is something that begins to
[2:06:09] travail in us for people that are lost
[2:06:12] for our our wade word. A there there's
[2:06:15] there's remedies that we begin to seek
[2:06:17] for. OH GOD, AMEN. CAUSE THIS WALL OF
[2:06:20] PARTITION to break.
[2:06:24] THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; LET THERE BE A UNITY BETWEEN US.
[2:06:28] WHATEVER THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO DO, OH
[2:06:31] FATHER, LET ME ACT IN such a way.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; I know the natural as well. If they
[2:06:38] don't call me, I ain't going to call
[2:06:39] them.
[2:06:42] They want to talk to me, I ain't going
[2:06:43] to TALK TO THEM. THAT'S NATURAL. THAT'S
[2:06:45] CARNAL.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; But there's a token.
[2:06:49] Hallelujah.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; So, we're in this warfare whether and
[2:06:58] and and you may have the Holy Ghost. You
[2:07:00] may have these things, but that doesn't
[2:07:01] mean you just relax. You're in a
[2:07:03] battleground.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; You're in a warfare.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? And the
[2:07:09] only way YOU'RE GOING TO STAY UNDER THAT
[2:07:11] blood is the word. The word begins to
[2:07:14] take over. AND YOU SAY, "FATHER, THAT'S
[2:07:16] NOT THE WAY I'VE BEEN ACTING. I WANT YOU
[2:07:19] TO WASH ME. I WANT YOU TO CORRECT ME."
[2:07:21] AND THERE IS A BLOOD THAT WASHES US. IT
[2:07:25] MAY STEP ON YOUR TOES AND YOU MAY HATE
[2:07:27] IT. BUT IF YOU HUMBLE YOURSELF, THERE'S
[2:07:30] A BLOOD THAT'LL BREAK THAT POWER OVER
[2:07:33] YOUR LIFE.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a honing. We're coming
[2:07:41] down to a honing time that God is honing
[2:07:44] us. He's shaping us. He's correcting
[2:07:47] things. HE'S THE ONE THAT'S ALLOWING
[2:07:50] THESE THINGS IN OUR LIFE SO WE CAN SEE
[2:07:52] WHAT WE NEED TO BE.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; That he's our protector. That's right.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; I hope this all right.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Oh," he's praying.
[2:08:03] And he said, "Oh, Satan would take my
[2:08:05] very life,
[2:08:07] but I'm dependent on you, and I realize
[2:08:10] that I shall face demons after a while,
[2:08:14] supernatural beings who will come out in
[2:08:16] that poor old form of a dark cloud going
[2:08:19] on against my very soul."
[2:08:22] Then, Father, if you don't cover me with
[2:08:24] your blood and protection, it would it
[2:08:27] quickly would come upon me and I could
[2:08:30] have no more services, for I would be
[2:08:32] laying helpless.
[2:08:34] Oh, help me thou Lord, help me to be
[2:08:38] sincere, for I realize that we're not
[2:08:41] wrestling against flesh and blood now,
[2:08:44] but spiritual powers.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So we find that Paul
[2:08:49] would tell us, he says, you know, in in
[2:08:52] Ephesians 4:26, "Be ye angry and sin
[2:08:54] not. Let not the sun go down upon your
[2:08:57] wrath, neither," everybody say, neither
[2:09:00] give place to the devil.
[2:09:02] First Thessalonians 5:22, "Abstain from
[2:09:05] all appearances of evil." We could go on
[2:09:07] and on and on, but Brother Brandham
[2:09:09] says, "If you have the spirit of God,
[2:09:11] then it is in you to abstain from evil,
[2:09:14] to do good, to shun evil, and flee to
[2:09:18] righteousness and turn away from
[2:09:19] temptations."
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say it? It's in me.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; It's in me to shun evil.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "As soon as you see sin in any
[2:09:30] form, jump from it. Get away from it. I
[2:09:34] don't care what you have to do.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; If you have to get you a flip phone flip
[2:09:40] phone, get you a flip phone.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I mean, I'm just It's a disgrace
[2:09:45] people having their phones and looking
[2:09:47] at their phones in church. You
[2:09:49] irreverent person.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It's
[2:09:53] totally irreverent.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; When we can't give up the things of
[2:09:57] thing, things of the world, just a
[2:09:59] little time for God.
[2:10:03] Yeah.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; But but see, IT'S COMING ON. SO SO SO he
[2:10:09] Now, I wasn't meant just, you know, I
[2:10:11] don't mean to be hard, but it's just on
[2:10:13] my it's just in my spirit right now,
[2:10:15] okay? And and I'm not here as a chew out
[2:10:17] or anything, but I am telling you, we
[2:10:20] need the spirit of God in our lives.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; It it it it is just so easy to get mad
[2:10:27] at people anymore. IT'S SO EASY JUST TO
[2:10:30] CUT PEOPLE OFF ANYMORE. IT'S SO EASY
[2:10:33] JUST TO CUT OURSELVES AWAY. WELL, I
[2:10:35] DON'T WANT YOU'LL SEE. YOU KNOW, IT'S
[2:10:37] FUNNY THAT MORE PEOPLE SEE HYPOCRISY IN
[2:10:39] THE CHURCH THAN THEY DO OUT IN THE
[2:10:41] WORLD.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; There's hypocrisy in the church. There's
[2:10:47] problems in the church.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW could some guy claiming to be a
[2:10:53] Christian and look at the world AND SEE
[2:10:56] MORE GODLINESS OUT THERE THAN THEY DO IN
[2:10:58] THE CHURCH?
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[2:11:02] Come on.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bradom says he says if you if
[2:11:06] you come to a meeting and you want to
[2:11:08] see see the bad, Satan will be sure to
[2:11:11] show it to you.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; So if you've got in this mind frame that
[2:11:15] everybody's an devil and this person's
[2:11:17] PROBLEM IS THIS. EVERY TIME YOU look at
[2:11:19] that person, Satan's going to show you
[2:11:21] everything bad about that individual.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Change your mind. Say, "God, I'm going
[2:11:26] to love that individual. I'm going to
[2:11:28] I'm going to I'M GOING TO FELLOWSHIP.
[2:11:31] I'M GOING TO GET IN. I'M GOING TO SHOW
[2:11:34] CHRIST.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:42] Well, we could take a vote and you can
[2:11:44] vote me out if you want, but it's just
[2:11:47] it's just way I feel like it's the
[2:11:50] truth. I feel like it's needed.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Feel like the Lord's laid it on my
[2:11:54] heart. So now he says remember he says
[2:11:58] as soon as you see it sin in any form
[2:12:02] jump from it get away from it. I don't
[2:12:04] care what you have to do get away from
[2:12:06] the very appearance of evil.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Because remember to associate with sin
[2:12:11] is death.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You believe that? I'm
[2:12:16] done this preacher too.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Just the same as standing there and
[2:12:20] letting that car strike you. DON'T JUST
[2:12:22] WAIT and see what it'll do. Get out of
[2:12:25] the way.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; The very appearance OF EVIL, SHUN IT
[2:12:29] QUICKLY. When you see A TEMPTATION
[2:12:31] COMING UP and sin, IF YOU KNOW IT'S
[2:12:34] something wrong, that death is lurking
[2:12:35] after you, then get away from it as
[2:12:38] quick as you would get away from an
[2:12:39] automobile approaching you at 90 m an
[2:12:42] hour.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; You'd want to get away FROM IT QUICK.
[2:12:44] GET OUT OF THE WAY. JUMP, SLIDE, run
[2:12:46] away. Just get away from it.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this this morning as
[2:12:50] we close. You don't have to sin.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; You have protection.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said a lot of people
[2:13:05] they sin because they have to sin.
[2:13:07] That's a pitiful shape when you say you
[2:13:09] have to sin.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; But when you realize you don't have to
[2:13:12] sin anymore. There's people that just
[2:13:15] stand up and curse and laugh in your
[2:13:17] face, call you an idiot, and everything
[2:13:19] else. and and they are willfully
[2:13:22] sinners, then there's no hope for them.
[2:13:24] But that man who does something
[2:13:26] constantly, THEY DON'T WANT TO do it. He
[2:13:28] steals, he doesn't WANT TO. HE LIES, HE
[2:13:30] DOESN'T WANT TO. HE DOES THINGS HE
[2:13:32] DOESN'T WANT TO. HE DON'T WANT TO BE A
[2:13:34] SINNER. There's hope for him if you can
[2:13:37] let him see what's the truth. Come up to
[2:13:39] God's promise. Lay your faith on that
[2:13:41] and walk out there to the enemy.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; He just simply can't hold it no longer
[2:13:46] because it's yours.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:13:50] See, people want to blame the devil for
[2:13:52] their failures,
[2:13:56] but brother Brandham in the breach, I
[2:13:57] believe it was, says, "No, the devil
[2:13:59] didn't do it. You just wasn't sealed
[2:14:01] in."
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; So then, see, cuz you're sealed in. When
[2:14:05] you're sealed in, he sealed out.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; You went out to him.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Remember, we're talking about enticing
[2:14:11] spirits, lurements,
[2:14:14] right?
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Lurements. He said, "You went out to
[2:14:18] him. and he couldn't get into you
[2:14:20] because the only way he'd get into you
[2:14:22] is through the same process that you
[2:14:25] have. He'd have to be saved, sanctified,
[2:14:27] filled with the Holy Ghost, then he'd be
[2:14:28] your brother. So, he didn't do it. No,
[2:14:30] no. You just went to the borderline,
[2:14:32] come back lusting for the things of the
[2:14:34] world. He never went all the way into
[2:14:37] Canaan across Jordan to death itself.
[2:14:39] Can you say amen?
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, brother
[2:14:43] Brandham tells of the time he visited a
[2:14:45] man in prison.
[2:14:47] This man was serving time for what he
[2:14:50] had done.
[2:14:52] Brother Brandham took him by the hand
[2:14:53] and began to talk with him. And he asked
[2:14:56] him the question, "Why? Why would you do
[2:14:59] such a thing as this? Why?"
[2:15:04] The man holding him by the hand, he
[2:15:06] began to speak and say, "I was forced
[2:15:08] into what I was doing."
[2:15:11] Told brother Ram said, "He's forced in
[2:15:12] it." And I said, "Be it's only because
[2:15:15] that you permitted it to force you into
[2:15:18] it."
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to do that. No
[2:15:23] man has to drink."
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Notice Brother Brandon says, "Now I'm a
[2:15:30] nervous man, too,
[2:15:32] but there's still no need for it."
[2:15:36] So what I am saying is there is a
[2:15:38] protection of the blood.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A WAY THAT SATAN doesn't have
[2:15:44] to get us.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Satan does NOT HAVE TO PUT A SPIRIT of
[2:15:49] pornography on you. Satan does not have
[2:15:51] to put THE SPIRIT OF HATE upon you.
[2:15:53] SATAN DOES NOT AMEN. HE CANNOT. WHEN
[2:15:56] YOU'RE UNDER THAT blood and you're
[2:15:59] keeping your sins under the blood, SATAN
[2:16:03] CAN'T TOUCH YOU.
[2:16:06] HE CAN SCRATCH AT THE DOOR. HE can
[2:16:09] allure you. He can DO WHATEVER HE WANTS
[2:16:12] TO. BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD
[2:16:14] AND HIDE under his protection, Satan
[2:16:18] can't touch you.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; Let people come and talk about you,
[2:16:25] you'll love them anyhow.
[2:16:28] Let people do you wrong, you'll love
[2:16:30] THEM ANYHOW. YOU'LL SHOW KINDNESS TO
[2:16:32] THEM. Let someone let let some old
[2:16:35] nasty, FILTHY, PERVERTED WOMAN COME
[2:16:38] BEFORE YOU MEN AND THERE'S JUST
[2:16:40] SOMETHING THAT'LL CAUSE YOU TO TURN YOUR
[2:16:41] HEAD.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; But what is it? We allow ourselves to be
[2:16:47] lured. We allow it to be an allurement
[2:16:50] and before you know it, we're we're
[2:16:52] looking at things. We're doing things.
[2:16:54] We're talking things. We're we're we're
[2:16:57] ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT sticky nature.
[2:17:02] But it's come time to play the token.
[2:17:04] Display that token. Can you say amen?
[2:17:07] There is a living God. There is a living
[2:17:09] reality. I love it how brother Brandham
[2:17:12] displayed Christ. But I thought, "Oh,
[2:17:14] God, if that prophet can do it, I can do
[2:17:16] it, too. You can DO IT. THIS CHURCH CAN
[2:17:18] DO IT. YOU CHILDREN can do it."
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you
[2:17:28] is our prayer. The light
[2:17:33] Mercies
[2:17:35] are bright.
[2:17:37] Oh, shine all around us
[2:17:43] by day and by night.
[2:17:48] Jesus,
[2:17:51] the light of
[2:17:53] the world.
[2:17:56] Sing it again. Oh, we'll walk in.
[2:18:02] I thought of how the prophet began to
[2:18:04] talk
[2:18:06] about how they had had company all day
[2:18:09] and
[2:18:10] they finally the last one had left and
[2:18:13] his wife just wore out and she's sitting
[2:18:15] there and she's crying.
[2:18:18] Joseph and Sarah, they're fighting and
[2:18:22] just seemed like a nervousness
[2:18:24] in the in the house. attention.
[2:18:28] I just love how the prophet handled it.
[2:18:32] He didn't say, "Woman, straighten up."
[2:18:36] He didn't say, "Children, behave
[2:18:38] yourself. I'm going to whip you." There
[2:18:41] was just something he realized that a
[2:18:44] spirit was at work,
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; They grabbed that wife and he hug began
[2:18:50] to hug her. And as she's weeping on his
[2:18:53] shoulder, he's praying, "God,
[2:18:56] soften her down. Calm her down. God,
[2:18:59] give me the answer." And as he's
[2:19:01] praying, he said, "Before you knew it,
[2:19:04] she's quit crying. Children's quit
[2:19:07] fussing. They're over there playing." He
[2:19:09] said, "What is it?" It changed the
[2:19:11] atmosphere.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "That's right. Oh, God,
[2:19:15] help us to realize what we're dealing
[2:19:16] with sometimes."
[2:19:20] Oh, we'll walk in
[2:19:23] the light.
[2:19:25] Such a beautiful
[2:19:28] light. Aren't you glad for that
[2:19:30] protection?
[2:19:32] Come where the dew drops
[2:19:36] of mercy
[2:19:38] are bright.
[2:19:41] Shine all
[2:19:44] around us
[2:19:46] by day and
[2:19:48] by night.
[2:19:51] Jesus
[2:19:53] the light of the world. Oh, say it
[2:19:58] again. We will walk in
[2:20:04] the light.
[2:20:06] Such a beautiful
[2:20:09] life.
[2:20:12] Come where
[2:20:14] the dwrops
[2:20:17] of mercies
[2:20:19] are bright.
[2:20:21] Oh, shine all around us by day and
[2:20:29] by night.
[2:20:32] Jesus
[2:20:34] the light of.
[2:20:37] Can you just lift your hands unto the
[2:20:39] Lord?
[2:20:41] Say, "Father,
[2:20:43] help me to abide in you.
[2:20:48] Help me to stay under that protection
[2:20:53] to where I'm safe, my family safe."
[2:20:59] Oh God, we thank you, Lord, for it.
[2:21:02] I pray that you would just bless this
[2:21:04] congregation this morning.
[2:21:12] Help them, Lord,
[2:21:16] as we walk along this journey.
[2:21:20] There's so many things to disturb us
[2:21:23] trying to
[2:21:26] trying to get us to look at this and
[2:21:28] trying to get us to look at that and
[2:21:30] trying to get us offbalanced and fearful
[2:21:34] and worrying and but oh God may we stay
[2:21:39] under that blood
[2:21:42] and trust you
[2:21:45] father I I just believe in it Lord.
[2:21:49] Thank you for protecting
[2:21:52] all these young people here.
[2:21:55] Keep them, Father. Keep them from the
[2:21:57] allurements of the world.
[2:22:00] Oh father,
[2:22:03] so many things to entice them.
[2:22:06] But I pray Lord that they could look to
[2:22:08] your word and
[2:22:11] see that you have called them, that
[2:22:13] you've ordained them
[2:22:15] for a rapture, that it could just be so
[2:22:18] in their heart
[2:22:20] that that crave, that desire will be
[2:22:23] fulfilled in you.
[2:22:26] May they look to you for everything they
[2:22:28] have need of
[2:22:30] is our prayer. Lord,
[2:22:33] may these words that we have spoken this
[2:22:36] morning not be a detriment,
[2:22:40] but Lord, let it be something. Let it be
[2:22:43] life,
[2:22:45] Father, that we could come up higher
[2:22:49] in you, Lord.
[2:22:53] We give you all praise and glory
[2:22:56] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:23:01] our bright.
[2:23:03] Oh, shine all
[2:23:07] around us
[2:23:09] by day and by night.

[2:23:19] the world.
[2:23:21] Can we sing this? I love him. I love
[2:23:24] him.
