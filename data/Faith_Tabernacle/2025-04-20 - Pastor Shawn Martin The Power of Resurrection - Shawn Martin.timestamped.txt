[10:02] His love for
[10:05] me is like your
[10:10] gold. My God is real for I can't feel
[10:15] him in my
[10:19] soul. There are some
[10:23] things I may not know.
[10:28] There are some

[11:36] scorn or can go
[11:39] on and leave me alone.
[11:45] but ask for
[11:48] me. Oh, I'll take God's
[11:53] part. And God is real for I can feel him

[13:20] well this morning? Amen. I want to say
[13:23] happy Easter to everyone this morning.
[13:26] It is good to see everyone. Amen. Maybe
[13:28] we could ask brother Amos to dedicate
[13:30] the service. Heavenly Father God, Lord,
[13:32] we certainly deem it a great privilege,
[13:35] Lord, that we're not the children of
[13:37] death. no longer languishing in death of
[13:41] sin and corruption. Oh God, but we've
[13:43] been raised together with you, Father
[13:45] God. The newness of life, Lord, the
[13:48] death battle is over, dear God, that
[13:50] once reigned in our bodies and in our
[13:52] soul, dear God, we've been raised to
[13:55] life. And we thank you for it because of
[13:57] that great resurrection morning. We now
[14:00] have that portion within us, God. We
[14:02] pray your blessing over the service this
[14:04] morning. Dear God, may we not take it
[14:06] for granted, but may we take it very
[14:08] seriously, Lord, as you're the special
[14:10] featured guest among us in Jesus
[14:13] Christ's name. Amen.
[14:16] [Music]

[33:44] [Music]
[33:49] I was saying about how beautiful the
[33:51] bride is. You know, a lot of people, the
[33:53] world can't recognize it, but I'm glad I
[33:56] recognize it. And people, I remember
[33:58] years ago, I was in a hospital one time
[34:01] and this black guy come by and preacher
[34:04] said, "Uh, where do you go if you die?"
[34:06] I said, "Right now, I go to hell." and
[34:08] and he started testifying to me and I
[34:10] appreciate that. But he just think about
[34:13] how beautiful Christian people are.
[34:16] [Music]
[34:19] I'm certainly glad to be he me right in
[34:23] the middle of and I appreciate it.
[34:26] When she
[34:28] speaks,
[34:29] everybody knows she's different. Yes,
[34:33] sir.
[34:35] for she has only could to save for her
[34:43] all. And through the
[34:46] region she is waiting from the
[34:50] world
[34:52] separate and she's ready now to hear her
[34:57] bridegroom call.
[35:00] [Music]
[35:01] And what a
[35:03] beautiful bride God has
[35:09] chosen. She's made ready and she's
[35:14] ro in his
[35:17] righteousness. She's
[35:20] faithful to the father. She has
[35:24] eyes for no other. And what a
[35:28] beautiful
[35:30] bride she is.
[35:34] [Music]
[35:43] Folks may laugh and call her
[35:50] oldfashioned, but Satan's eating has no
[35:54] claim on her
[35:59] soul. And they don't
[36:02] understand. She holds a key in her hand.
[36:07] And when she's gone, this modern world
[36:11] will be no
[36:14] more. Find what a
[36:17] beautiful bride God has
[36:22] chosen. She's made ready and she
[36:27] rose. In his
[36:30] righteousness, she's
[36:33] faithful to the father. She has eyes for
[36:38] no other. And what a
[36:41] beautiful
[36:43] bride she
[36:46] is. And what a
[36:49] beautiful
[36:51] bride she
[36:57] is. Hallelujah.

[38:54] fearful. The ships seemed so small in
[38:58] the
[38:58] waves and the wind just kept blowing
[39:03] harder and yet they were all still so
[39:07] safe. From out of the dark he came
[39:12] walking. He had never lost them from
[39:16] view.
[39:18] He can see through the darkest of trles.
[39:23] He just wanted them to see it,
[39:28] too. That you'll never be filled till
[39:32] you're
[39:34] empty. Until you're broken, you'll never
[39:38] be
[39:39] whole. Until the potter has tried your
[39:44] vessel with fire, you'll never come
[39:47] forth as pure gold.
[39:51] I didn't know how much he loved me until
[39:56] I'd passed through the storm and looked
[40:00] back. I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[40:05] needed until he was all that I had.
[40:10] [Music]
[40:26] Sometimes the storm that you're
[40:29] facing may seem like your whole world
[40:33] has
[40:34] changed and the fire just keeps getting
[40:39] hotter. As the potterer, he's shaping
[40:42] the clay.
[40:45] Friends, Jesus knows what he's
[40:49] doing. Even though it causes you
[40:53] pain, he just wants us to know the
[40:57] lessons he show. His word remains the
[41:04] same. That you'll never be filled till
[41:08] you're
[41:09] empty. Until you're broken, you'll never
[41:12] be whole.
[41:14] Until the potter has tried your vessel
[41:18] with fire, you'll never come forth this
[41:21] pure
[41:23] gold. I didn't know how much he loved me
[41:28] until I passed through the storm, then
[41:31] look back. I didn't know Jesus was all
[41:36] that I needed. Until he was all that I
[41:40] had.
[41:44] Sometimes the storm that you're
[41:48] facing may seem like your whole world
[41:51] has changed and the fire just keeps
[41:55] getting
[41:57] hotter as the parter he's shaping the
[42:01] clay. Friends, Jesus knows what he is
[42:05] doing.
[42:08] Even though it causes you
[42:11] pain, he just wants you to know the

[42:45] until I passed through the storm and
[42:47] look back. I didn't know Jesus was all
[42:52] that I needed. Until he was all that I
[42:57] had. I didn't know Jesus was all that I
[43:02] needed until he was all that I had.
[43:08] [Music]
[43:14] [Music]
[43:18] you Jesus for the
[43:21] blood
[43:24] of Thank you Jesus, it has washed me
[43:31] white. Thank you Jesus, you have saved
[43:37] my
[43:39] life. You brought me from the
[43:42] darkness into
[43:44] glorious
[43:48] light. I was rich. I remember who I
[43:55] was. I was lost. I was blind. I was
[44:01] running out of
[44:03] time. Sin separated.
[44:08] The breach was far too
[44:10] wide. But for the far side of the
[44:14] chasm, you held me in your
[44:18] side. So you made a
[44:21] way across the great
[44:25] divine. Left behind heaven's
[44:28] throne to build it here inside.
[44:33] And there at the
[44:36] cross, you paid the debt I
[44:39] owe. Broke my chains, freed my soul. For
[44:44] the first time I had
[44:47] [Music]
[44:49] hope. Thank you Jesus for the blood
[44:56] applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed
[45:01] me white.
[45:03] Oh, thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[45:09] life. You brought me from the darkness
[45:14] into glorious
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:18] light. Now you took my place, laid
[45:23] inside my tomb of sin.
[45:26] You were buried for 3 days, but then you
[45:30] walked right out
[45:32] again. Now death has no sting and life
[45:38] has no end. For I have been
[45:42] transformed by the blood of the
[45:48] lamb. Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood
[45:54] of life.
[45:56] Thank you Jesus. You have washed me

[46:14] into glorious light.
[46:19] Oh, thank you Jesus for the blood
[46:26] applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed
[46:31] me white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have
[46:37] saved my
[46:39] life. You brought me from the darkness
[46:43] into glorious light.
[46:47] I love this. Oh, you took my place, laid
[46:52] aside my tomb of
[46:54] sin. You were buried for three days, but
[46:59] then you walked right out
[47:01] again. Now death has no sting, and life
[47:07] has no end.
[47:09] For I have been
[47:11] transformed by the blood of the
[47:15] lamb. Thank you Jesus for the blood of
[47:22] life. Thank you Jesus. It has washed me
[47:28] white. Oh thank you Jesus. You have
[47:33] saved my life.
[47:36] You brought me from the darkness into
[47:40] ghost. Can we stand to our feet and sing
[47:42] it again? Oh, thank you Jesus for the
[47:47] blood
[47:49] applied. Oh, thank you Jesus. It has
[47:54] washed me
[47:56] white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have
[48:01] saved my life.
[48:04] You brought me from the darkness into
[48:08] glorious
[48:12] light. Amen. Are you thankful for the
[48:15] blood this morning? Amen. As we invite
[48:18] our pastor to come because he

[50:47] because he
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] lives. Amen. and so glad that we have
[50:54] that assurance that he
[50:56] lives. And because he lives, we live.
[51:01] Amen. We
[51:02] can face tomorrow, face the future.
[51:06] Amen. We're so glad for that. Amen. What
[51:09] a beautiful day it is to serve the Lord
[51:12] and um to honor the resurrection of
[51:16] Jesus Christ. Amen. and um uh trust
[51:21] everybody's doing well. Amen. And come
[51:25] to worship the Lord.
[51:28] Amen. The musicians can be dismissed. Um
[51:33] if you have your Bibles, we're going to
[51:34] turn to the book of Luke, the 21st
[51:38] chapter. And it's good to have Dad and
[51:40] Mom here with us this morning. And Amen.
[51:44] And um we've just enjoyed having them
[51:48] there at the house.
[51:49] And praise the
[51:53] Lord. So good to be a Christian, huh?
[51:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um maybe before
[52:04] we go into the word, we could just bow
[52:06] our heads and just talk to the Lord.
[52:10] Precious
[52:12] Father, Lord, we're so glad that you are
[52:16] alive
[52:17] and well, Father,
[52:20] and that you reign. You're supreme God,
[52:24] Father. You're you're not defeated.
[52:27] You've proven by the resurrection that
[52:30] you're not defeated, Lord. And you've
[52:34] conquered every
[52:35] enemy. And Father, we're just
[52:39] asking that you would come among us this
[52:42] morning and that you would speak to our
[52:46] hearts, Father, and let this
[52:49] resurrection, let it be more uh real to
[52:54] us than ever before.
[52:56] I pray, Father, that you would just in
[52:59] your special way, that you would touch
[53:02] every heart, those that may be sick,
[53:05] discouraged, needing a closer walk with
[53:08] you or just needing deliverance or
[53:10] whatever it would be, Father, that you
[53:13] would just meet the needs
[53:15] today. We ask it, Father, and we love
[53:18] you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[53:24] So uh Luke uh
[53:29] 21 and
[53:32] um start at the 25th verse. And there
[53:36] shall be signs in the sun and in the
[53:39] moon and in the stars and upon the earth
[53:42] distress of nations with perplexity with
[53:46] uh the sea and the waves roaring.
[53:49] men's hearts failing them for
[53:52] fear and for looking after those things
[53:55] which are coming on the earth. For the
[53:57] powers of heaven shall be
[53:59] shaken. And then shall they see the Son
[54:02] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[54:06] great
[54:07] glory. And when these things begin to
[54:10] come to pass, then look up, lift up your
[54:13] heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.
[54:18] Amen. And you can be seated this
[54:21] morning.
[54:23] And
[54:24] um this uh scripture may seem a little
[54:28] different
[54:30] uh for an Easter
[54:34] uh
[54:36] service, but uh for those of us that
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] uh well, we we should all here this
[54:45] morning u have an understanding of what
[54:48] that means to us. All right. But Easter,
[54:51] you know, of course speaks of
[54:53] resurrection and
[54:56] um Webster Web Webster Yeah. defines
[55:00] Easter as being a a feast that
[55:03] commemorates Christ's resurrection.
[55:06] And that's that's what it is. We we've
[55:09] come together to because of the
[55:12] resurrection of Jesus Christ, we believe
[55:15] that Christ rose. How many believes
[55:17] that? Amen. And um and so um that event
[55:24] happened, you know, 2,000 years ago. And
[55:27] yet it is sacred to us. It's a um we
[55:32] hold it dear. It's uh I don't I don't
[55:35] think that the the resurrection of
[55:37] Christ will ever lose its value to to
[55:41] the believer. Brother Brandham said it
[55:43] was the it's the greatest event that
[55:46] ever happened in the world was the
[55:49] resurrection. And so, uh, the
[55:53] resurrection has a a a meaning to us.
[55:57] And, um, uh, of times maybe we don't
[56:01] understand, you know, what it took to
[56:04] bring an Easter. And uh but yet the the
[56:09] prophet said it took a Gethsemane to
[56:11] make an Easter. It took a Calvary. It it
[56:14] took death uh to to make an Easter. It
[56:18] it was um um uh a time of ugliness and
[56:24] sorrow and loneliness and whatever
[56:29] uh to make an Easter. But the prophet
[56:33] said Christ was great in his death. And
[56:37] u uh but if he only died and never rose
[56:40] again, then he was just another man that
[56:43] died. Ain't that right? Uh uh so we're
[56:48] saying that he's not just another man.
[56:52] Uh and and I believe it was Paul that
[56:55] says that uh he was proven to be the son
[56:59] of God by the resurrection.
[57:02] He healed. He he um uh set free the
[57:06] captive. He turned water into wine. He
[57:09] walked on the water. He he done all of
[57:12] these things. He made a lot of claims,
[57:15] but uh the resurrection proved it. Can
[57:17] you say amen? So Easter is a victory.
[57:21] Easter was a victory. That resurrection
[57:24] morning was a a a victory and and we we
[57:29] know it. Brother Rams talked about it.
[57:31] You've heard it many time, but many men
[57:34] have made claims, great claims, great
[57:37] men, great scholars, great teachers, and
[57:40] and all of these things. Uh they've made
[57:43] claims, but when they went into the
[57:45] grave, they stayed in the grave.
[57:48] uh you know there's that uh con confus I
[57:51] believe it is and and there's uh
[57:53] Muhammad and and uh there there's all
[57:57] all kinds of of uh um uh leaders and and
[58:03] they have their followers even yet today
[58:05] and uh brother Bram talking of that one
[58:08] uh uh that that uh the leaders you know
[58:12] or their followers um his his followers
[58:16] you know bring a horse uh a white horse
[58:18] to the grave and and uh because they're
[58:21] expecting him to rise and well, they've
[58:24] all made claims of these things, but we
[58:27] don't have to wait. Amen. Uh because
[58:31] we're saying that our Lord has risen.
[58:34] Amen. We're not gathered at a grave.
[58:37] We're not gathered at a tomb. We believe
[58:40] he is risen. Can you say amen? And so we
[58:43] we've been able to have this Easter
[58:45] memorial for 2,000 years uh uh as a
[58:50] declaration that uh uh Christ was risen.
[58:54] Jesus was only in the grave for three
[58:56] days. And um so of of of course the the
[59:00] critics, you know, they want proof of
[59:02] his resurrection. And I think that's the
[59:05] way it is. I I think if we're going to
[59:08] say something about something, then then
[59:10] you got to have proof. And and there
[59:13] ain't nothing wrong with the world
[59:15] seeking proof that he is risen. And uh
[59:20] and so uh they they're they're wanting
[59:23] proof. And you know, uh the the the
[59:26] church says, "Well, he is risen uh
[59:29] because he lives in my heart." And and
[59:32] that's that's good. That's that's fine.
[59:35] But uh uh you know, brother Random says,
[59:39] "But you know uh if if you talk to the
[59:44] uh uh the others, Muhammad's and and all
[59:47] these others, they say, "Well, we've got
[59:49] him in our heart, too." And and so um uh
[59:54] then then it it's that that's not what
[59:57] we're talking about. We got to have
[59:58] greater proof than just saying, "He's in
[1:00:00] my heart." Amen. There's a lot of folks
[1:00:03] saying that that Jesus is in their heart
[1:00:06] and and and all of these things. Uh but
[1:00:09] I believe that we have proof and and
[1:00:12] more proof than just saying uh that he's
[1:00:15] in our hearts or uh that I feel him and
[1:00:19] because you can feel a lot of things and
[1:00:22] uh uh that that ain't proof. See, so we
[1:00:26] don't have to we don't have to talk uh
[1:00:29] just talk about an empty tomb. We don't
[1:00:32] have to take people to the Holy Land and
[1:00:35] show them uh an empty grave. Uh we don't
[1:00:39] have to have an Easter play uh each year
[1:00:44] uh to try to convince people that he is
[1:00:47] risen. Can you say amen? Amen. I' I've
[1:00:51] thought of, you know, the two men that
[1:00:53] walked the road to Emmas and, you know,
[1:00:55] they had heard that the grave was empty.
[1:00:58] They they had heard that the tomb uh uh
[1:01:02] uh uh the that the stone had been rolled
[1:01:05] away and that they they couldn't find
[1:01:06] the body. Amen. And and so they're
[1:01:09] walking on the road to Emmas. Amen. With
[1:01:12] this thought in mind that, you know,
[1:01:14] they can't find, you know, the the the
[1:01:17] body and and these things. And and they
[1:01:19] had heard about the angels appearing to
[1:01:22] the women uh there at the tomb. and and
[1:01:26] they called it uh uh the vision, a
[1:01:29] vision of angels that they saw. And so
[1:01:32] they they knew that some of the
[1:01:34] disciples that were with them uh went to
[1:01:37] the grave and found it as the women had
[1:01:40] said. Amen. But but it still wasn't
[1:01:43] proof that he had risen because nobody
[1:01:46] had seen him. Amen. And and so they had
[1:01:49] heard that all these things of the the
[1:01:52] grave empty and they can't find the body
[1:01:55] and and uh the angels had visited and
[1:01:58] and yet after hearing all of these
[1:02:01] things, they're still sad. They're
[1:02:03] walking the road to to Emmas uh uh sad
[1:02:06] and downcast. And so that that would
[1:02:09] tell us that just talking about an empty
[1:02:13] tomb does not convince people of the
[1:02:15] resurrection.
[1:02:17] Amen. Just uh hearing about the
[1:02:20] resurrection does not convince people
[1:02:23] that Jesus is alive. Ain't that right?
[1:02:26] Then we must have a greater proof that
[1:02:29] Jesus Christ is truly living today. The
[1:02:33] Bible says that Peter himself ran unto
[1:02:36] the scepter uh uh and and stooping down
[1:02:40] he beheld the linen clothes laid by
[1:02:43] themselves and departed wandering in
[1:02:45] himself at that which was come to pass.
[1:02:50] See, so he was there. He went in he he
[1:02:53] went to the grave and he saw exactly
[1:02:55] what had been told him. The body's gone
[1:02:58] and the stones rode away. Amen. And yet
[1:03:01] he he he left perplexed. He left more
[1:03:05] confused than he uh uh uh than than than
[1:03:09] before, you know. And so, in other
[1:03:12] words, he he hadn't been convinced yet
[1:03:15] that Christ had risen. He didn't know
[1:03:18] what had happened. You understand? See?
[1:03:20] So uh uh but but the Bible says that
[1:03:24] Jesus appeared to the men on the road to
[1:03:28] Emmas and and yet even though they
[1:03:31] they're looking at his is a at him they
[1:03:35] just see a man that has come. They just
[1:03:37] think it's a stranger that they're
[1:03:39] talking to. And uh because the Bible
[1:03:41] says their eyes were withholden that
[1:03:45] they should not know him. Ain't that
[1:03:47] right? And so while they're talking to
[1:03:50] him and and visiting with him, walking
[1:03:55] with him, they were still sad and gloomy
[1:03:58] and and downcast. Ain't that right? And
[1:04:02] and they're talking to him of what had
[1:04:05] been. They're telling him all of the
[1:04:07] events uh that had happened and
[1:04:10] everything was in past tense and past
[1:04:13] times and and all of that, but they
[1:04:15] didn't know. They didn't know that they
[1:04:18] were walking with the risen Christ
[1:04:21] himself. Amen. See, and and you know
[1:04:24] sometimes uh uh uh people talk about
[1:04:27] their problems and worry about the
[1:04:29] events that have taken in their life
[1:04:32] place in their life or taken place and
[1:04:34] it's as though Jesus Christ really isn't
[1:04:37] risen and and yet he could be among them
[1:04:42] and not even and them not even know.
[1:04:45] Amen. That they're walking with the
[1:04:47] resurrected Messiah today. Amen. But the
[1:04:51] Bible says when he broke bread, Amen. He
[1:04:55] done something. Amen. And he broke bread
[1:04:58] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[1:05:02] him. And they they saw him for the first
[1:05:06] time. Amen. Not just hearing about an
[1:05:09] empty tomb. Not just hearing about
[1:05:11] angels of a visitation of angels. Amen.
[1:05:15] But they saw him. Amen. Amen. Just
[1:05:18] hearing about it, Amen. left him still
[1:05:21] gloomy. But they saw him and they went
[1:05:25] talking about his resurrection.
[1:05:28] not talking about what happened of
[1:05:30] yesterday and we have thought and and
[1:05:33] gathering together and in doom and gloom
[1:05:36] and and downcast, but now they had seen
[1:05:40] him and there they they were convinced
[1:05:44] that he had risen and they went to go
[1:05:47] tell amen about his resurrection. Can
[1:05:50] you say amen? So this is why we are
[1:05:53] talking about his
[1:05:55] resurrection. Amen. We're not talking
[1:05:57] about it because we know that the grave
[1:05:59] is empty. We're not talking about it
[1:06:02] because someone has told us that his
[1:06:04] body isn't there. We're not talking
[1:06:06] about the resurrection from an
[1:06:08] intellectual standpoint. We have seen
[1:06:12] him. How many believes that? Amen. I
[1:06:16] hope you have seen him. We have seen
[1:06:18] him. And so we we we uh uh you know,
[1:06:23] people want to see him alive. Amen. And
[1:06:25] if you're going to talk about a
[1:06:27] resurrection, you want to see the the
[1:06:29] man that you say rose, you want to see
[1:06:31] him alive. Amen. And uh you know uh that
[1:06:36] Muhammad uh told uh uh I I don't know
[1:06:39] maybe Dr. Read, I don't know, but uh he
[1:06:43] says, "Let me see you uh people produce
[1:06:45] or reproduce and prove the resurrection
[1:06:47] of Christ by his life living in the
[1:06:50] church." Can you say amen?
[1:06:53] as as he said he would do. Then I'll
[1:06:56] believe your Christ rose from the dead.
[1:06:59] Amen. So let me see him living. Let me
[1:07:03] see him living and then I'll be
[1:07:05] convinced that he has risen from the
[1:07:07] dead. Don't show me just an empty tomb.
[1:07:10] Don't just talk about an empty grave and
[1:07:12] and and all of these things of of of you
[1:07:16] know uh uh cuz we're we're not talking
[1:07:18] we're not here discussing amen theology
[1:07:21] and my opinion versus your opinion and
[1:07:24] all that. Amen. I want proof. Can you
[1:07:28] say amen? Amen. I believe we are living
[1:07:31] in the day where we can see him. Amen.
[1:07:34] In I in Isaiah uh
[1:07:37] 45:22, God said, "Look unto me and be
[1:07:40] saved, all ye ends of the earth, for I
[1:07:43] am God and there is none else." Amen. So
[1:07:46] if we are to look uh unto him, then then
[1:07:50] we can see him, amen, and and know that
[1:07:53] he is alive. Amen. Don't have to go tour
[1:07:57] the Holy Land, amen, to know he's alive.
[1:08:00] We can see him, Amen, today. Amen. Ain't
[1:08:04] that right? See, and so it's it's at the
[1:08:07] ends of the earth and and uh um that the
[1:08:12] revelation of Jesus Christ is made
[1:08:15] known. Amen. So that all who look can be
[1:08:20] saved. Amen. So uh uh but as as we know
[1:08:25] we don't have to uh to see Jesus in the
[1:08:29] physical body that he lived in uh while
[1:08:33] he walked the earth to know that he's
[1:08:35] alive. Amen.
[1:08:37] um uh you know I I know people cannot uh
[1:08:41] maybe understand that uh they're and and
[1:08:44] and maybe it's because they haven't
[1:08:46] listened to the the prophets um you know
[1:08:50] uh that God has sent down through the
[1:08:52] ages. U you know brother said that's why
[1:08:55] the Pharisees didn't see Jesus. Amen.
[1:08:58] When Jesus walked the earth they didn't
[1:09:00] recognize him. They didn't know that he
[1:09:03] was God. They didn't know that he was
[1:09:05] the promised messiah is because they
[1:09:07] never listened to the prophets. Amen.
[1:09:10] That had foretold of him. Amen. See?
[1:09:13] Amen. But the Old Testament believers,
[1:09:15] the prophets said they had an
[1:09:17] understanding through the word of the
[1:09:19] Lord by the prophets. Can you say amen?
[1:09:22] And I think that's where we're at today.
[1:09:24] We want to see him, but first we want to
[1:09:27] have an understanding. Amen. and the of
[1:09:30] him an understanding of who he is today,
[1:09:34] what he is today, where he is today. And
[1:09:38] that understanding cannot take place,
[1:09:40] Amen. outside the prophet. Can you say
[1:09:43] amen? Through the word of the Lord, by
[1:09:45] the prophets. Amen. So by the prophet of
[1:09:49] Malachiah 4, then we understand that we
[1:09:52] are not to look for the physical body of
[1:09:55] Jesus Christ. And it's not saying that
[1:09:58] we don't believe in the literal coming
[1:09:59] and the uh the physical body, but he
[1:10:02] never promised to to to come on the
[1:10:05] earth. Amen. At the time of rapture uh
[1:10:09] in his physical body. The Bible says we
[1:10:12] will meet the Lord in the air. Amen. So
[1:10:15] we don't do away with this physical
[1:10:16] body. Amen. We're going to see him. But
[1:10:19] but you've got to put it with the
[1:10:21] scriptures. So Jesus uh the prophet said
[1:10:23] Jesus never puts his feet on the earth
[1:10:26] until the church has been raptured and
[1:10:29] took home and the wedding supper's over
[1:10:32] in heaven. Then he returns back after
[1:10:34] the Jewish remnant. Can you say amen? So
[1:10:37] then we are not to look for nail scars.
[1:10:40] We're we're not to look for u you know
[1:10:43] uh the scars from the uh uh the the the
[1:10:46] in his head from the thorns being placed
[1:10:49] upon him. And that that's not what we're
[1:10:52] looking for. That's not proof that he
[1:10:54] has risen. Amen. You could see a man if
[1:10:56] a man walked in today and and he's got
[1:10:59] nail scarred hands and and he's got uh
[1:11:02] uh uh he's got, you know, scars in his
[1:11:05] side and uh from being pierced or or
[1:11:08] whatever, that's still not proof that is
[1:11:10] Jesus Christ. Can you say amen? Because
[1:11:13] it's never promised that that's way.
[1:11:16] It's it's not promised. That's how he
[1:11:19] would come in in this in this coming.
[1:11:22] Amen. See, so if you saw that, it's not
[1:11:25] proof. See, that's what Satan wants us
[1:11:27] to believe. He wants us to get some idea
[1:11:30] that we're looking for a a a physical
[1:11:33] body, a a a physical thing. uh uh and
[1:11:38] you know and and so we're we're the
[1:11:40] world's looking for a a uh uh uh uh well
[1:11:45] his corporal body. But to see Jesus
[1:11:48] alive, we must look for his life being
[1:11:53] displayed. Can you say amen? If he's
[1:11:56] alive, then his life is being displayed
[1:11:59] somewhere. Amen. If if he says look unto
[1:12:03] me and be saved, then his life is being
[1:12:07] displayed somewhere to show that he is
[1:12:11] God, that he is the one, amen, that has
[1:12:14] risen. You see, the life declares him.
[1:12:18] God is a person with the personality.
[1:12:20] Amen. He has his own nature, his own
[1:12:23] characteristics, his own attributes.
[1:12:25] Amen. his uh his own power, his own
[1:12:28] attitude and and all of these things.
[1:12:31] And Jesus Christ was none other than God
[1:12:34] made flesh, right? Amen. Not the second
[1:12:37] person in the Godhead. He was the only
[1:12:40] person. Amen. In in the Godhead, he was
[1:12:43] God made flesh. Amen. The prophet taught
[1:12:46] us that he was the human tabernacle that
[1:12:49] God lived in. He was the body of God.
[1:12:53] Acts 7:48 says, "How be it, the Most
[1:12:56] High dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:12:59] hands, as saith the prophet." See, then
[1:13:02] Paul picks this up in Hebrew, saying,
[1:13:05] "But a body thou hast prepared me."
[1:13:08] Ain't that right? A body thou hast
[1:13:11] prepared me. God being a spirit and and
[1:13:14] yet he would create himself a body that
[1:13:18] all the fullness of the godhead could
[1:13:21] dwell in that body and then the body
[1:13:25] would declare God. Amen. Upon the earth,
[1:13:29] the life of God living in that body,
[1:13:33] amen, and the body declaring the life of
[1:13:35] God. Brother Bram said, "See, it's a
[1:13:38] body that God could dwell in, God can
[1:13:40] walk in, God can see in, God can talk
[1:13:43] in, God can work in." Ain't that right?
[1:13:47] Amen. See, you knew that God was among
[1:13:49] men. Amen. When when Jesus was there,
[1:13:53] Amen. For they even says, "Uh, we know
[1:13:56] that thou come from God, for no man can
[1:13:58] do the things that thou doest. We know
[1:14:01] that something's different about you."
[1:14:03] Amen. Why? because it was a life that
[1:14:07] was being declared. Amen. It wasn't It
[1:14:09] was more than just human life. It was
[1:14:12] more than just whatever. It was the life
[1:14:14] of God. Amen. Declared in that body.
[1:14:18] Amen. 1 Timothy 3:16. And without
[1:14:22] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:14:24] godliness. God was manifested in the
[1:14:27] flesh. Do you believe that?
[1:14:30] 2 Corinthians 5:19, God was in Christ
[1:14:34] reconciling the world unto himself. John
[1:14:37] 1:18, no man has seen God at any time,
[1:14:40] but the only begotten son, the body of
[1:14:44] God. See, the only begotten son which is
[1:14:47] in the bosom of the father, he hath
[1:14:50] declared him. Ain't that right? See?
[1:14:53] Amen. Jesus says, "He that has seen me
[1:14:56] hath seen the father." Amen. Jesus
[1:14:58] didn't even come in his own name. He
[1:15:01] came in the father's name. A ain't that
[1:15:04] right? Yes, sir. See, so the the body of
[1:15:07] Jesus declared the life of God. Amen.
[1:15:11] That body declared the person of God,
[1:15:13] the attitude of God, the power of God.
[1:15:17] It made known the characteristics of
[1:15:19] God. It made known God uh in in uh in in
[1:15:24] every way. Ain't that right? Amen. See?
[1:15:26] And so, uh, what was it that they seen,
[1:15:30] the people seen, uh, the life of God
[1:15:34] flowing through him, that body, ain't
[1:15:36] that right? Amen. Now, we know, Amen.
[1:15:40] that, uh, uh, uh, if a person changes
[1:15:43] bodies, it doesn't change who he is.
[1:15:46] Amen.
[1:15:47] Death doesn't change who you are. Death
[1:15:50] doesn't annihilate who you are. It does
[1:15:53] not annihilate you. Amen. Now, now you
[1:15:56] may leave that body and your body is
[1:15:59] just a corpse. It ain't it ain't doing
[1:16:01] anything. But that doesn't mean that you
[1:16:03] stopped existing. It means that you went
[1:16:06] into another body. Can you say amen?
[1:16:09] That's right. See, and so the body is
[1:16:12] only just the the tabernacle. Amen. Uh
[1:16:16] uh you are what you are in your soul.
[1:16:19] Amen. And your body declares your
[1:16:22] attributes and your nature and your
[1:16:25] character and and all of these things
[1:16:27] and and and and there's a lot of things
[1:16:30] that can happen to this body. Amen. But
[1:16:33] down in that soul is what you are. So
[1:16:37] your body declares your existence. Can
[1:16:40] you say amen? I know you're you're here
[1:16:42] this morning because your body's here
[1:16:44] this morning. And not only that, but
[1:16:46] your body is moving. And I'm not moving
[1:16:49] your body. Someone else ain't moving
[1:16:50] your body. You are living in your body.
[1:16:53] And so your your body is is is uh under
[1:16:57] control. Amen. By your life, your
[1:17:01] nature. See? Amen. So your body
[1:17:04] declares, Amen. that you are here right
[1:17:08] now in this room. Can you say amen? I
[1:17:10] may not see you. Amen. But I see your
[1:17:12] body. Amen. You don't see me, but I see
[1:17:15] your body. Or you see my body. Amen. So
[1:17:18] we have fellowship one with another.
[1:17:20] Amen. Through the body. Ain't that
[1:17:22] right? See, and so death doesn't change
[1:17:25] who we are. It only changes our dwelling
[1:17:28] place. This is why Paul in 2 Corinthians
[1:17:32] 5:1 says, "For we know that if our
[1:17:34] earthly house of this tabernacle be
[1:17:37] dissolved," in other words, if this
[1:17:39] body, Amen, were to turn back unto dust
[1:17:43] and and or ashes or whatever, if is
[1:17:46] dissolved, we have a building of God, a
[1:17:50] body. Can you say amen? A house not made
[1:17:54] with hands, eternal in the heavens. See?
[1:17:57] So, so there is a body. How many
[1:17:59] believes that? Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:18:01] taught us you've got a body that is
[1:18:03] waiting for you. Amen. You're in this
[1:18:05] body, but there's another body that is
[1:18:08] waiting for you. And if death would ever
[1:18:10] take you, it only transfers you from one
[1:18:13] body to another body. That That's right.
[1:18:16] See, but it doesn't change who you are.
[1:18:19] Amen. Now, if your soul has been
[1:18:21] converted here, Amen. I I just love it
[1:18:24] when when a person's soul is converted.
[1:18:27] Amen. Well, see what happens that body.
[1:18:31] Amen. They used to take you what they
[1:18:33] done with that body. They' pick up a
[1:18:35] beer. They would take up a cigarette.
[1:18:37] They would do all kinds of things in
[1:18:38] this body. But when that soul become
[1:18:41] converted, now that body is lifting a
[1:18:44] pans and and that body is declared
[1:18:47] because there's been a change. That soul
[1:18:49] has been converted. Can you say amen?
[1:18:52] Now, if that soul has been converted
[1:18:54] here and you leave this body, Amen. Now,
[1:18:58] you're worshiping here this morning,
[1:19:00] you're praising God, you're singing
[1:19:01] songs, you're you're you're you're just
[1:19:04] loving God. Well, see, death ain't going
[1:19:06] to stop all of that. You just go to
[1:19:08] another body. You'll still be raising
[1:19:11] your hands. You'll still be magnifying
[1:19:13] God. You'll still be praising God.
[1:19:16] You'll still be in love with him. It's
[1:19:18] just you changed bodies. Can you say
[1:19:21] amen? Amen. See, you you know, so if
[1:19:24] you're you're you're so been converted,
[1:19:26] you'll love to worship God. Amen. You'll
[1:19:29] love to come to the house of God. You'll
[1:19:31] love the word of God. You'll love to say
[1:19:34] amen to that word. You'll love the
[1:19:36] people of God. You'll want to be around
[1:19:38] the people of God because there's
[1:19:40] something that's happened to you.
[1:19:44] You'll magnify him. Amen. Well, then
[1:19:47] when you leave this body and go to
[1:19:48] another body, that theophony body, well,
[1:19:51] you're walking. You've got hands, you
[1:19:53] got feet, you got a mouth, you got nose,
[1:19:56] and you got it all. Amen. But you're
[1:19:59] still doing the same things. You're
[1:20:01] still loving him. You're still wanting
[1:20:03] to be around the people of God. That
[1:20:05] doesn't change nothing. That's right.
[1:20:09] Praise be to God. Praise the Lord. You
[1:20:11] know, if you love the things of the
[1:20:12] world here and
[1:20:15] you then when you die, you you'll still
[1:20:18] be that way. I think you know a lot of
[1:20:22] people would be miserable if they went
[1:20:23] to heaven.
[1:20:25] Wow. Cuz there ain't filthy stuff there.
[1:20:28] Come on.
[1:20:29] And so what they are here is what they
[1:20:32] would be there. Exactly. Ain't that
[1:20:35] right?
[1:20:37] See? So, so when you leave this body,
[1:20:40] you'll enter another body and just pick
[1:20:42] up where you left off. See? And so Jesus
[1:20:46] Christ is alive. How many believes that?
[1:20:49] He's alive.
[1:20:51] And he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:54] forever.
[1:20:55] Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:21:00] Abraham said he's the same in powers,
[1:21:02] the same in life, the same in principle,
[1:21:04] the same in love and
[1:21:06] attitude. He still has supreme authority
[1:21:09] over all things. He's still the
[1:21:12] conqueror.
[1:21:13] Hallelujah. He's still never been
[1:21:15] defeated. Do you believe that? He's
[1:21:18] still God.
[1:21:20] Still has the power over every devil of
[1:21:22] hell. He still can can command and
[1:21:26] nature stops. Nature uh uh obeys his
[1:21:30] word.
[1:21:32] Our bodies obey his word. Sickness obeys
[1:21:36] his word. Death obeys his word. He's
[1:21:41] powerful. He reigns. He's supreme. Can
[1:21:45] you say amen? And he still has a body to
[1:21:49] show himself that he's alive.
[1:21:55] That body declares him.
[1:21:58] Praise the Lord. Jesus promised to build
[1:22:00] his
[1:22:02] church. He said the gates of hell will
[1:22:05] not prevail against it. Amen. Because
[1:22:06] he's going to build his church upon
[1:22:08] revelation. Amen. Of who he is. That's
[1:22:12] right.
[1:22:14] Ain't that right? Right? And that's why
[1:22:18] I, if I could say it this way, it's why
[1:22:20] we're getting that revelation of who we
[1:22:22] are. Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] Because we're part of him.
[1:22:28] Paul tells us that the church, that
[1:22:30] church that Jesus promised to build is
[1:22:33] is the body of Christ. Amen. In
[1:22:36] Ephesians, the book of Ephesians, Paul
[1:22:38] says that God hath put all things under
[1:22:40] the feet of Jesus Christ and gave him to
[1:22:43] be head over all things to the church,
[1:22:45] which is his body, the fullness of him.
[1:22:50] What is the church? The fullness of him
[1:22:53] that fleth all in all. Can you say amen?
[1:22:57] Amen. The church is his body. So that
[1:23:00] means the church is to be the dwelling
[1:23:03] place of Jesus Christ. You believe that?
[1:23:07] Amen. God didn't make a mistake. Paul
[1:23:09] wasn't making a mistake when he called
[1:23:10] the church the body. Amen. There's a
[1:23:13] reason why we're called the body of
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ. Amen. Because as that body
[1:23:17] declared him a god in in in 2,000 years
[1:23:21] ago, so is there a body upon the earth
[1:23:23] today that's going to declare the same
[1:23:25] God, the same life, the same works, the
[1:23:28] same
[1:23:29] attributes. Amen. Everything. Ephesians
[1:23:33] 5:28, Paul says, "We are members of his
[1:23:36] body, of his flesh, and of his bones." 1
[1:23:40] Corinthians 12:27. Now ye are the body
[1:23:44] of Christ and members in particular.
[1:23:46] Ain't that right? So believers are to be
[1:23:49] the dwelling place of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:53] First uh uh Corinthians 3:16, "Know ye
[1:23:55] not that you are the temple of God, and
[1:23:58] that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?
[1:24:00] If any man defile the temple of God, him
[1:24:03] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[1:24:06] is holy, which temple you are. Ain't
[1:24:10] that right? Flesh and blood. That's
[1:24:13] right. God taking on flesh and blood
[1:24:16] today.
[1:24:18] Come on now. 2 Corinthians 6:16. What
[1:24:21] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:24:23] idols? For you are the temple of the
[1:24:26] living God. As God has said, I will
[1:24:27] dwell in them and walk in them and I
[1:24:31] will be their God and they shall be my
[1:24:34] people. Can you say amen? Now, this was
[1:24:37] even before he made that promise before
[1:24:39] he even dwelt in the body of Jesus
[1:24:41] Christ. But he dwelt in the body of
[1:24:44] Jesus Christ to make this promise a
[1:24:46] reality.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] It wasn't just his intention to just to
[1:24:53] always live in one body and dwell upon
[1:24:56] the earth.
[1:24:59] Amen to God. Hope you understand.
[1:25:03] That Calvary made a way. The blood made
[1:25:06] a way
[1:25:08] where the church could become his body.
[1:25:12] And it's the mystical body. I thinking
[1:25:14] of that word mystical. having a
[1:25:16] spiritual meaning or reality that is
[1:25:19] neither apparent to the senses nor
[1:25:21] obvious to the
[1:25:23] intelligence. Amen. A body. Can you say
[1:25:26] amen? Amen. Now think of that. God
[1:25:28] taking your body.
[1:25:31] Amen.
[1:25:33] Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:25:36] So this body, Brother Brandham said, is
[1:25:38] made up of men and women who has
[1:25:41] resurrected from sin unto life.
[1:25:44] He says, "God always likes to work
[1:25:47] through men. It's God's program to work
[1:25:49] through men." Do you believe that God
[1:25:53] works through men? He made man his
[1:25:55] helper on earth. He made man a lesser
[1:25:58] God than himself. Ain't that right? So,
[1:26:01] no wonder in John 14 and 21, Jesus says,
[1:26:05] "I will not leave you comfortless. I
[1:26:08] will come to you."
[1:26:12] Bless the name of the Lord. Yes, I will
[1:26:15] come to you. Ain't that right? So, this
[1:26:18] fits with our opening scripture, the son
[1:26:20] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[1:26:23] great glory. It fits with Revelations 1
[1:26:26] or 10:1, the mighty angel coming down
[1:26:28] from heaven. It fits with 1
[1:26:30] Thessalonians 4:16, for the Lord himself
[1:26:33] shall descend with a shout voice and
[1:26:35] trump. It fits with Psalms 102 and 16.
[1:26:38] When the Lord shall build up Zion, he
[1:26:41] shall appear in his glory.
[1:26:44] Can you say amen? What is it? He's
[1:26:47] coming to his body, the bride.
[1:26:53] What is it? It's the word that's coming.
[1:26:56] Can you say that with me? It's the word
[1:26:57] that's coming. Why? He's the word. It's
[1:27:01] the word coming of Christ. It It's the
[1:27:04] coming of the word. Ain't that right?
[1:27:07] John 1:1. In the beginning was the word.
[1:27:10] Everybody say he was the word. See was
[1:27:13] the word and the word was with God. The
[1:27:16] word was God and the word was made
[1:27:19] flesh.
[1:27:21] Ain't that right? Amen. Amen. Talking
[1:27:25] about resurrection now. So he says, see,
[1:27:28] he always used man. When Jesus came,
[1:27:31] that was God in flesh. God working
[1:27:34] through man. God. He was God in David.
[1:27:37] He was God in Elijah. He was God in in
[1:27:41] in Joseph. What was it? It was the word
[1:27:45] working through them.
[1:27:50] It wasn't just an emotional fit. It
[1:27:53] wasn't a fe a feeling. It wasn't just a
[1:27:58] some supernatural experience. It was the
[1:28:02] word working through them. The same word
[1:28:05] that worked through Jesus Christ upon
[1:28:08] the earth worked through them.
[1:28:14] Brother Braden said, "It was God who
[1:28:16] made the promise, the works that I do
[1:28:18] shall you do also." He promised his
[1:28:20] church that he would work in his church
[1:28:23] among his members, his mystic body,
[1:28:26] spiritually speaking, until he came
[1:28:28] again that the same things that he did
[1:28:31] would be confirmed in his church by the
[1:28:34] believers. Don't Don't underestimate
[1:28:37] yourself. Don't don't don't just look
[1:28:40] and say, "Well, I I can't do it. I I'm
[1:28:42] just a victim. I I'm just I I just can't
[1:28:45] I can't overcome. I can't." If you're
[1:28:47] part of the church, you're his body.
[1:28:51] And as he overcome in that body 2,000
[1:28:54] years ago, he's overcoming in your body.
[1:28:57] As he whipped Satan, defeated Satan in
[1:29:00] that body of 2,000 years ago. He's
[1:29:03] defeating that same devil in your flesh.
[1:29:09] Well, Brother Ram said that's what God
[1:29:11] determined. I'm going to whip my enemy
[1:29:13] through them.
[1:29:14] I am going to whip my enemy through
[1:29:17] them. Why? Who's them? The
[1:29:20] church. Ain't that right? They may look
[1:29:23] like peasants. They may not have much
[1:29:25] going for them in the world, but God has
[1:29:27] chosen us to be his body.
[1:29:32] The word. That's right. Amen. So, how
[1:29:35] can God
[1:29:37] work through men and women and boys and
[1:29:40] girls that are just sinful and sinners?
[1:29:47] And Brother Brham says he took the same
[1:29:49] blood from the body that he gave as a
[1:29:53] sacrifice and sanctified a people.
[1:29:58] He didn't worry about your sins. He
[1:30:00] didn't worry about your your complexes.
[1:30:02] He didn't worry about your
[1:30:04] incapabilities. It he it didn't matter
[1:30:06] if you could sing or not. Didn't matter
[1:30:08] if you could preach a fine sermon or
[1:30:10] not. Didn't matter if if you were just
[1:30:12] the most gifted person or
[1:30:15] not. He took that same blood
[1:30:19] from the body that he gave as a
[1:30:22] sacrifice and sanctified a people that
[1:30:25] he himself might live in to continue his
[1:30:30] word.
[1:30:32] Can you say amen? God is in his word.
[1:30:36] God is the word. Amen. And now he comes
[1:30:40] in a people that he is sanctified in
[1:30:43] this day to continue his word to the end
[1:30:47] of the consummation.
[1:30:50] As I said, Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:30:54] in the body of flesh. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:00] God created him a tabernacle for himself
[1:31:02] and lived in it. Brother Brown said he
[1:31:05] walked through it. He talked through it.
[1:31:09] He expressed himself through that body
[1:31:11] of flesh that he might by that one body
[1:31:15] give it as a sacrifice that he might
[1:31:18] bring all of us to him as sons and
[1:31:21] daughters of God that the Holy Spirit
[1:31:23] can speak through us and continue his
[1:31:26] work. Yeah. Well, aren't you glad for
[1:31:28] that? He didn't just save you to make
[1:31:31] you a church member.
[1:31:34] He saved you that he can live in you,
[1:31:36] walk in you, talk in you, express
[1:31:39] himself in you, and continue where he
[1:31:43] left off.
[1:31:45] Amen.
[1:31:49] Yes, sir. That's right. Him coming in
[1:31:52] your body doesn't change him. Amen.
[1:31:54] Doesn't change his attitude. doesn't
[1:31:56] change his power. Doesn't change nothing
[1:31:58] about him. He's God. He just takes your
[1:32:02] body to express that through. He takes
[1:32:05] your body and express his creative
[1:32:07] power.
[1:32:14] Notice the nominal church today, well
[1:32:19] through throughout the ages has
[1:32:21] presented a
[1:32:22] corpse. And you know what a corpse is?
[1:32:25] It's it's it's a body without life.
[1:32:30] It's usually referring to a dead person
[1:32:32] and an animal, the remains of something
[1:32:34] discarded or defunct or
[1:32:38] defunct. And and so they're presenting a
[1:32:43] corpse. Oh, he's
[1:32:46] alive, but it's just a corpse. Yeah.
[1:32:50] And the prophet says they're trying to
[1:32:52] destroy the effects of the word
[1:32:56] and they are doing it with their
[1:32:58] traditions and denominational politics.
[1:33:00] That's right. He says they meet today to
[1:33:04] honor a
[1:33:05] corpse. They go into the place and they
[1:33:07] sing near my God to thee and some kind
[1:33:10] of a slow morg thing like that. It makes
[1:33:14] a weary sound and they come around you
[1:33:17] and say now let us now say the apostles
[1:33:20] creed. Let us re repeat this certain
[1:33:22] certain creed that Dr. So and so of a
[1:33:24] certain so and so and a so and so and oh
[1:33:27] my like you were sorry about it and half
[1:33:31] of them stay at home to watch television
[1:33:33] instead of coming to church on Sunday.
[1:33:36] That's right. See, dead just a corpse
[1:33:39] moving around and then a corpse
[1:33:41] preaching and a corpse trying to tell
[1:33:44] about a corpse that once lived and lived
[1:33:48] in a tomb many years ago. A corpse. See,
[1:33:51] just corpse, corpse, corpse. And they
[1:33:53] are going to honor a Christ that died,
[1:33:56] 1900 years ago. And that's almost
[1:33:59] exactly where the churches are today,
[1:34:01] trying to honor a corpse instead of
[1:34:04] hailing a conqueror. Amen.
[1:34:08] How do you know he's a conqueror?
[1:34:09] Because he's able to conquer this old
[1:34:11] flesh
[1:34:12] and have preeminence in my body. I'm not
[1:34:16] here to honor a corpse of 2,000 years
[1:34:18] ago. I'm telling you, he's risen again.
[1:34:22] He's alive and he's a conqueror because
[1:34:25] I know it. He's conquered me.
[1:34:29] Hallelujah.
[1:34:31] conquered my sins, conquered my
[1:34:34] failures, conquered my
[1:34:38] first birth.
[1:34:42] Amen.
[1:34:44] He must have conquered so much that
[1:34:46] nothing's held against me.
[1:34:50] Wiped it all away. Right. Amen. He said,
[1:34:53] "Glory to God. I'm glad to be a Pentec
[1:34:55] Pentecostal in heart, not by
[1:34:58] denomination. No, sir. the rabbi name
[1:35:00] away from there. We're not coming down
[1:35:03] to honor. We're not coming doing honor
[1:35:05] to some dead man. We're hailing a
[1:35:08] conqueror who conquered death, hell, and
[1:35:11] the grave and sickness and every
[1:35:14] demon. Every unbelief,
[1:35:17] he conquered it.
[1:35:20] Amen, brother. Right. So why would why
[1:35:23] why why would we call the nominal church
[1:35:26] a corpse? because it claims to be the
[1:35:30] body of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:33] And when it claims to be the
[1:35:35] church, then God's going to hold her
[1:35:37] responsible,
[1:35:39] right? Claiming to be the church. It'd
[1:35:42] be something if she just said, "No, we
[1:35:44] don't want nothing to do with it." But
[1:35:46] no, they they're claiming to be
[1:35:48] something. And yet they're not. So
[1:35:52] they're given false representation.
[1:35:55] We are the church. Well, the church is
[1:35:57] to be the body of Christ.
[1:36:01] And when the when the life of Christ
[1:36:03] ain't there, then it's just a corpse.
[1:36:07] Then they're a false representation of a
[1:36:09] living God.
[1:36:13] Can you say amen? It's a dead corpse
[1:36:16] because the life of Christ is not
[1:36:18] pulsating in it. Amen. These so-called
[1:36:21] Christians are nothing but corpse
[1:36:23] because the life of Christ isn't in
[1:36:25] them. Brother Graham said, "See, pastors
[1:36:27] are so busy and people are so busy
[1:36:29] swapping members, just like taking a
[1:36:32] corpse from one morg to another, just
[1:36:35] one place to another." Can you say,
[1:36:36] "Amen." And I say this, dancing and
[1:36:39] shouting and crying is no sign that the
[1:36:42] life of Christ is there.
[1:36:46] Speaking in tongues and prophesying is
[1:36:48] is no sign that the life of Jesus Christ
[1:36:51] is there. Right.
[1:36:53] Being all formal and prim and proper and
[1:36:57] having all your, you know, everything
[1:36:59] just right, that is no sign either that
[1:37:01] the life of Christ is there.
[1:37:09] The Bible foretold of Christ being
[1:37:11] kicked out of his own church in this
[1:37:14] day. Amen.
[1:37:17] And so when they kicked him out, what
[1:37:19] did they kick him out? What do they kick
[1:37:20] out? Well, he's the word. He's the
[1:37:22] manifested word. Amen. And so when the
[1:37:26] church rejected the manifested word,
[1:37:28] they rejected him. So all they have is
[1:37:31] their Easter plays to show that he's
[1:37:34] alive. All they have is their scholarly,
[1:37:37] you know, uh, dried up sermons to
[1:37:40] declare that he's alive.
[1:37:43] All they have is their bubble dancing.
[1:37:45] The prophet would call it bubble dancing
[1:37:47] to show that he's alive.
[1:37:50] They they got professional musicians,
[1:37:52] professional choirs. Everything's gone
[1:37:55] professional.
[1:38:00] But remember what the angels told the
[1:38:03] women of that day at the grave. Why seek
[1:38:05] ye the living among the dead?
[1:38:09] Can you say amen? Amen. See, they
[1:38:12] rejected his very own life when they
[1:38:16] rejected the word because he is the
[1:38:19] word. And Jesus said, "My word is spirit
[1:38:22] and life." Can you say amen? So the only
[1:38:26] way to get spirit and life is by the
[1:38:28] word.
[1:38:29] Can't separate spirit and life and then
[1:38:32] from the word. The word, his word is
[1:38:35] spirit and life and God is the word.
[1:38:39] Amen. Ain't that right? So the life and
[1:38:43] spirit of Christ is connected with the
[1:38:45] word of
[1:38:46] God and the word comes to a prophet.
[1:38:49] Amen.
[1:38:51] Right. Give you some scriptures. Hosea
[1:38:54] 12 and 10. I have also spoken by the
[1:38:57] prophets and I have multiplied visions
[1:39:00] and used similitudes by the ministry of
[1:39:03] the prophets.
[1:39:06] God said to
[1:39:10] Jeremiah, he said, "Before thou camest
[1:39:13] forth out of the womb, I sanctified
[1:39:16] thee, and I ordained
[1:39:19] thee to be a prophet unto the
[1:39:23] nations." Later on, the Bible says that
[1:39:25] the word of the Lord was spoken by the
[1:39:27] mouth of
[1:39:29] Jeremiah, the prophet. Right?
[1:39:33] Luke 170 tells us that God spake by the
[1:39:36] mouth of his holy prophets. Acts 3:18
[1:39:40] tells us that God foretold of Christ's
[1:39:42] sufferings by the mouth of all of his
[1:39:45] prophets. See, God uses the prophets to
[1:39:48] speak. The word come to the prophets.
[1:39:52] Can you say amen? See, so in order for
[1:39:55] them to reject the word, they had to
[1:39:57] there had to be a prophet upon the earth
[1:40:00] to speak the word.
[1:40:04] See, they weren't rejecting creeds and
[1:40:06] dogmas cuz God ain't in creeds and
[1:40:08] dogmas. They they they weren't just
[1:40:11] rejecting they weren't rejecting
[1:40:13] traditions of men because God ain't in
[1:40:15] traditions of men. He's in the word. So
[1:40:18] when Jesus is found on the outside of
[1:40:20] the church get trying to get back in, he
[1:40:23] is the word.
[1:40:26] Amen. Now think think of the power that
[1:40:29] a prophet has.
[1:40:35] Proverbs 18:21, "Death and life are in
[1:40:37] the power of the tongue."
[1:40:39] Think of that. And here the word would
[1:40:43] come to a prophet. Amen.
[1:40:46] What power, what
[1:40:49] authority. So the word, the prophet has
[1:40:52] the word of the Lord in his mouth. Amos
[1:40:54] 3:7. We all know these things. Surely
[1:40:56] the Lord will do nothing. But he
[1:40:58] revealth his secret unto his servants,
[1:41:00] the prophets. Ain't that right? So the
[1:41:03] prophet gives the revelation that he has
[1:41:05] received from God, he gives it to the
[1:41:08] people.
[1:41:09] Hello.
[1:41:12] And then the people have to receive it.
[1:41:14] Now the prophet said when you receive
[1:41:16] the word, you receive him.
[1:41:19] You're not receiving an emotion. You're
[1:41:22] not receiving some feeling. That all
[1:41:26] comes with it. Come on. If you ain't
[1:41:28] got, you know, if your religion ain't
[1:41:30] kicking, it's it's dead, you know. Amen.
[1:41:33] So when you receive the word, you
[1:41:35] receive him. Another place that word is
[1:41:39] life.
[1:41:41] And every time you receive the word, you
[1:41:44] receive life.
[1:41:46] Can you say amen? So then to reject the
[1:41:49] word of the Lord is to reject spirit and
[1:41:52] life.
[1:41:54] To accept the word of the Lord is to
[1:41:56] accept his spirit and his life. Now
[1:42:00] Romans 8:11, if the spirit of him that
[1:42:02] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:42:05] you, he that quicken raised up Jesus
[1:42:08] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:42:10] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:42:12] dwelleth in you. Can you say amen? What
[1:42:15] is he? He's quickening power.
[1:42:19] That power that raised up Christ from
[1:42:21] the dead, raised that body up from the
[1:42:23] grave, that same power is here today.
[1:42:29] You believe it?
[1:42:31] Quicken means to bring to life that
[1:42:34] which is dead.
[1:42:38] I ain't got much longer more, but
[1:42:41] according to Ezekiel's
[1:42:43] visions vision, the true church was a
[1:42:47] corpse until the word came.
[1:42:52] The prophet Ezekiel saw a valley of dry
[1:42:56] bones
[1:42:58] and bones were scattered all throughout
[1:43:00] the valley.
[1:43:03] But then Ezekiel saw that the bones came
[1:43:07] together, bone to his bone.
[1:43:10] Hallelujah. In other words, every
[1:43:14] bone would go to the body it came from.
[1:43:17] Amen. It wasn't disjointed. It wasn't
[1:43:21] That's right. all of these things. But
[1:43:24] then he tells us that there were four
[1:43:26] stages of restoration.
[1:43:30] one the first stage was the s when the
[1:43:33] senuse came upon the bones brother said
[1:43:36] that was Luther's message
[1:43:39] praise God the second phase was the
[1:43:43] flesh came upon the
[1:43:45] bones that was Wesley's message
[1:43:49] third stage was when the skin covered
[1:43:52] them that was Pentecost
[1:43:57] but Ezekiel said there was still no
[1:44:00] breath in them. Go ahead. Hallelujah. It
[1:44:03] was just there as a corpse. Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] They were shouting. They were dancing.
[1:44:08] They were having a good time.
[1:44:12] But there was no breath.
[1:44:17] Now, you know, we've lived through the
[1:44:21] day, as the prophet Zechariah maybe
[1:44:26] said,
[1:44:28] uh, a day where
[1:44:30] there's no light. It's just it's neither
[1:44:35] day nor night.
[1:44:38] Brother Brown said it cloudy day, a
[1:44:40] gloomy day. You we we've seen them days,
[1:44:43] right? It's just cloudy.
[1:44:47] Brother Brham said it was a day where it
[1:44:50] was just hearing the word with no
[1:44:52] manifestation.
[1:44:55] There you go. That's what it was. Just
[1:44:58] neither day nor night. The word was
[1:45:01] being preached with no manifestation.
[1:45:04] Ain't that right?
[1:45:06] But then the prophet uh Zechariah I
[1:45:09] believe says but in the evening time
[1:45:11] everybody say in the evening time it
[1:45:13] shall be light.
[1:45:15] That scripture been laying there for
[1:45:16] thousands of years. But a prophet would
[1:45:19] pick it up in this day and say it's it's
[1:45:21] it's evening time now. Ain't that right?
[1:45:25] Amen. And and what does light do? It
[1:45:28] brings forth life.
[1:45:31] We we we've gone through a season of
[1:45:33] death.
[1:45:34] Amen. But now the earth has gotten
[1:45:37] turned back into the center of the sun
[1:45:39] or or or or got it back in its position
[1:45:42] to where the light could call the life
[1:45:45] out and everything is blooming again.
[1:45:49] Aren't you glad? Amen. Now Ezekiel 37:9,
[1:45:53] then he said unto me, prophesy unto the
[1:45:57] wind. Prophesy, son of man. It took a
[1:46:00] son of man. It took a prophet to
[1:46:02] prophesy.
[1:46:04] Prophesy and say to the wind, "Thus
[1:46:06] saith the Lord God, come from the four
[1:46:09] winds, oh breath, and breathe upon these
[1:46:12] slain that they may live." So I
[1:46:15] prophesied as he commanded me, and the
[1:46:18] breath came into them, and they lived
[1:46:21] and stood upon their feet, an exceeding
[1:46:24] great army.
[1:46:26] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham calls you a
[1:46:29] super race.
[1:46:31] Not just an exceeding great army, but an
[1:46:33] invincible army.
[1:46:36] Hallelujah.
[1:46:37] And when the breath came into her, when
[1:46:40] the breath came into them bones, amen,
[1:46:43] they lived.
[1:46:47] Now the prophet said, see the fourth
[1:46:49] stage, we've gone through Wesley or
[1:46:51] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost. The fourth
[1:46:53] stage was the word. They had a little
[1:46:56] bit of word back in there in in in in
[1:46:59] down through the ages. They had just a
[1:47:01] little word here, little word there,
[1:47:02] little word there. But in this day was
[1:47:05] the full word with an authority because
[1:47:08] a prophet was on the earth and the word
[1:47:10] was in his mouth.
[1:47:13] Amen.
[1:47:15] Brother Brandham called it the message
[1:47:17] of life.
[1:47:19] This message ain't to kill you. It's to
[1:47:22] bring life to you.
[1:47:26] Can you say amen?
[1:47:28] Yes, sir.
[1:47:30] He said the fourth was the word itself,
[1:47:36] the word made flesh,
[1:47:39] fruits of of uh fruits of the proof of
[1:47:43] the resurrection sign that Christ has
[1:47:45] finally after justification been
[1:47:48] planted, sanctifi sanctification been
[1:47:50] planted, baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:52] organizations died out, and Christ has
[1:47:56] again centered himself like fat cap of
[1:47:59] the pyramid. First line justification,
[1:48:02] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:48:04] Ghost. Then the coming of the cap,
[1:48:08] headstone.
[1:48:11] When the Lord hath built up Zion, he
[1:48:13] shall appear in his glory.
[1:48:16] Can you say amen? The bride is finished.
[1:48:20] The bride is built. The body of Christ,
[1:48:22] the prophet said, is is has been
[1:48:24] completed or built. We're here. We're
[1:48:28] not waiting for another age.
[1:48:30] If this message doesn't do it for you,
[1:48:32] you ain't gonna get nothing else.
[1:48:37] That's right. Come on now. Amen. He
[1:48:40] said, "What is it?" That Holy Ghost
[1:48:42] bunch being honed out so that it can fit
[1:48:45] with the same kind of ministry he had
[1:48:49] when he went away. that when he comes
[1:48:52] back, it'll catch the whole thing in the
[1:48:53] rapture where the justified, sanctified,
[1:48:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, that
[1:48:58] pyramid will stand
[1:49:00] again. The house of God will live again.
[1:49:05] And I say, she's living again. She's
[1:49:09] standing again. Thank God for the
[1:49:12] message of the hour. Thank God that
[1:49:15] we're living not in Wesley's day,
[1:49:17] Luther's day, but in the day where the
[1:49:20] message of life has come to bring breath
[1:49:24] into
[1:49:33] us. Malachi 4, Elijah is to come with
[1:49:37] the very word. The word of the Lord came
[1:49:40] to the prophets in the evening lights is
[1:49:43] to come forth is to restore and bring
[1:49:45] back what? See, to turn the hearts of
[1:49:49] the children back to the faith of the
[1:49:51] fathers, to bring back a supernatural in
[1:49:55] the church. Can you say amen? To bring
[1:49:58] back life in the church.
[1:50:03] It's true. She becomes the final voice
[1:50:06] to the final age. She ain't just laying
[1:50:09] there as a corpse not knowing what to
[1:50:10] say. The word is in her mouth.
[1:50:14] Ain't that right? Why? She's accepted
[1:50:17] what a prophet had to say.
[1:50:21] Amen.
[1:50:24] Remember, Brother Brham said, "What a
[1:50:25] resurrection that was." Oh, yeah. And
[1:50:27] what a resurrection this is.
[1:50:30] Can you say amen? Hallelujah.
[1:50:33] Hallelujah. What is it? It's
[1:50:34] resurrection power that the son of man
[1:50:38] has come with.
[1:50:40] Then shall they see the son of man
[1:50:42] coming with power and great glory. Now
[1:50:45] we understand it's resurrection power
[1:50:48] that he's came with quickening power.
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:54] Hallelujah. To bring life into us.
[1:50:58] Amen. Amen. What is it? Brother Brham
[1:51:01] said it's a resurrection for the bride
[1:51:03] age. Hallelujah.
[1:51:06] He said it's a resurrection out of dark
[1:51:08] denominationalism.
[1:51:10] A resurrection out of dark denomination
[1:51:12] will be a message that the full maturity
[1:51:14] of the word.
[1:51:16] Brother Brand was so far beyond his his
[1:51:18] time. He's still far beyond his time.
[1:51:21] But there's a bride that's catching it.
[1:51:23] Amen. Can you say amen? They have no
[1:51:26] idea what he was preaching. They don't
[1:51:28] have a clue of what he was saying. All
[1:51:31] these things that a bride has caught it.
[1:51:33] But why? It's the full maturity of the
[1:51:35] word has come to us.
[1:51:38] Amen. That's right. Brother Brown said,
[1:51:41] "See, a resurrection out of dark
[1:51:43] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:51:46] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:51:48] back again in its full power and being
[1:51:52] waved over the people." Aren't you glad
[1:51:54] it's waved over you? Oh yes. This this
[1:51:58] message has an effect. Yes, sir. It's
[1:52:01] producing great young people. It's
[1:52:03] producing it's producing the best uh the
[1:52:06] best group of people in the world.
[1:52:09] Amen to God. Can you say amen? Our homes
[1:52:13] ain't patterned after Leoa and after a
[1:52:16] Hollywood. It's patterned after the
[1:52:19] message of the hour. It's waved over us.
[1:52:22] It's affected us.
[1:52:25] Amen.
[1:52:28] being waved over the people by the same
[1:52:30] signs and wonders that he did back
[1:52:32] there.
[1:52:35] I don't understand why these guys want
[1:52:37] to pick and fight and all these and
[1:52:40] dwell upon, well, Brother Brham's
[1:52:42] opinion here and Brother Brham's opinion
[1:52:44] there, all these things. No wonder
[1:52:47] they're dead. That's right. That's
[1:52:49] right. It's just an accepting it.
[1:52:53] We see we see we see the authority that
[1:52:56] was in that man's mouth that came from
[1:53:00] him. It wasn't just a man's word. It was
[1:53:04] a message of life. Amen. And as you
[1:53:07] receive the word, you receive Christ.
[1:53:11] Can't separate the message from Christ.
[1:53:15] Amen. They say get them to Christ and
[1:53:17] then get them to the message. How do you
[1:53:19] do that? accept the message then you
[1:53:21] accept Christ. Hallelujah. It is Christ.
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:27] So we find that all day long going back
[1:53:32] to the road to
[1:53:35] men that walked the road to Emmas. But
[1:53:38] all day
[1:53:39] long Christ had been bringing the word
[1:53:42] to the men. Amen. As they walked the
[1:53:45] road to Emmas. But the prophet said but
[1:53:47] there was no signs.
[1:53:49] He was just there talking. He was there
[1:53:51] just preaching. He was just there. But
[1:53:53] there was no supernatural in him.
[1:53:55] There's nothing. Just just talking.
[1:54:00] But he says, "But in the evening
[1:54:02] time, he revealed his resurrection."
[1:54:12] And for 2,000 years now, Christ has
[1:54:15] preached the gospel through his minist
[1:54:17] ministers. For 2,000 years now, Brother
[1:54:20] Brandham said, "Christ has preached his
[1:54:23] gospel, preached the gospel through his
[1:54:25] ministers." That's right. But we are
[1:54:27] living in the evening light. Hallelujah.
[1:54:30] Which is the manifestation of the
[1:54:32] resurrection.
[1:54:34] Can you say amen?
[1:54:36] Not talking about a resurrection, not
[1:54:38] pointing back of 2,000 years ago, but he
[1:54:42] has come into us and brought forth
[1:54:44] another resurrection
[1:54:47] that declares he's alive.
[1:54:50] Aren't you glad he's alive?
[1:54:53] Hallelujah. And John 14:19, yet a little
[1:54:56] while and the world seeth me no more.
[1:54:59] They're just talking about a
[1:55:01] resurrection, but they haven't seen him.
[1:55:04] The world seeth in me no more. Amen.
[1:55:06] See, they have a form of godliness, but
[1:55:09] the prophet said, but they deny that
[1:55:11] there is a resurrection power working
[1:55:13] among the people.
[1:55:15] They have a form of godliness. They have
[1:55:17] their music and they have their they
[1:55:19] have their choirs and they have their
[1:55:21] churches and they have all of these
[1:55:23] things, but they're denying that there
[1:55:25] is a resurrection power. They're
[1:55:28] pointing the people back of 2,000 years
[1:55:30] ago and yet denying that that same God
[1:55:33] has come with a resurrection power and
[1:55:37] is working among the people. Can you say
[1:55:40] amen? But you see me. The world won't
[1:55:45] see me, but you see me.
[1:55:49] Because I live, you shall live also.
[1:55:53] Amen. And at that day you shall know
[1:55:56] that I am in my father. You in me and I
[1:55:58] in you. And we all know brother Bram
[1:56:01] said that is this day. At that day, this
[1:56:04] day there comes a knowledge.
[1:56:09] Amen. That that resurrected Christ is in
[1:56:12] us. Can you say amen? Why? Because as he
[1:56:16] lives, I live also.
[1:56:19] I see him.
[1:56:22] G.
[1:56:24] Brother Bram called it the bride coming
[1:56:26] of Christ.
[1:56:28] Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:56:33] I hope this is all right.
[1:56:36] So, it's not his corporal body that
[1:56:38] we're
[1:56:39] beholding. We're beholding him in his
[1:56:41] revealed
[1:56:43] word. as we get ready to close. Uh, but
[1:56:47] 2
[1:56:48] Corinthians
[1:56:50] 5:16, Paul says, "Though we have known
[1:56:53] Christ after the
[1:56:55] flesh, yet now henceforth we know him no
[1:56:59] more." Though we have known Christ after
[1:57:02] the flesh, yet now henceforth know we
[1:57:06] him no more.
[1:57:08] Brother Brham said, "He is not to be
[1:57:10] known intellectually. He is he is known
[1:57:13] spiritually by spiritual revelation.
[1:57:16] This same one who was known remember Jes
[1:57:21] Peter walked with him and knew him after
[1:57:23] the flesh
[1:57:25] but Paul knew him by revelation.
[1:57:28] I love it. Can you say amen? He is known
[1:57:31] spiritually by spiritual revelation.
[1:57:33] This same one who was known as Jesus
[1:57:35] after the flesh went back to the pillar
[1:57:38] of fire. But he promised he would come
[1:57:40] again and dwell amongst his people by
[1:57:42] the spirit. And on the day of Pentecost,
[1:57:44] that pillar of fire came down and
[1:57:46] separated self in tongues of fire upon
[1:57:49] each one of them. What was God doing? He
[1:57:52] was separating himself into the church.
[1:57:56] Now, you ain't going to know him after
[1:57:58] the flesh because he separated himself
[1:58:01] into the church.
[1:58:04] Amen.
[1:58:06] He was separating himself into the
[1:58:08] church, giving all those men and women a
[1:58:11] part of himself.
[1:58:13] There you go. That's true. Can you say
[1:58:15] amen? Amen. The only way to know him
[1:58:18] today is in the power of his
[1:58:19] resurrection.
[1:58:21] Hallelujah. Yet the musicians will come.
[1:58:26] Brother Bram said it's at the
[1:58:28] resurrection of the church Christ and
[1:58:30] his bride will come together and
[1:58:32] dovetail. Think of that, man.
[1:58:35] Hallelujah. What a what a what a time
[1:58:37] we're living in. At the resurrection of
[1:58:40] his church,
[1:58:43] Christ and his bride will come together
[1:58:45] and dovetail. The writings and promises
[1:58:48] of God will make will be made fulfilled
[1:58:51] there. Where? In the church.
[1:58:54] When church and Christ unite together,
[1:58:58] every promise that was spoken of us will
[1:59:01] be fulfilled. There ain't no habit.
[1:59:04] There ain't no weakness. There ain't no
[1:59:06] sin. There ain't nothing big
[1:59:08] enough. Oh my. We may contend with this
[1:59:11] old flesh and we may contend with a lot
[1:59:14] of these things. Brother said you'll
[1:59:16] always have that sticky nature, you
[1:59:18] know, as long as you're living in this
[1:59:19] body, but it will not stop the promise
[1:59:22] of God at the resurrection of the
[1:59:25] church.
[1:59:26] Hallelujah. So it cannot come together
[1:59:29] unless the same spirit that was in
[1:59:32] Christ is in you and me. And then if
[1:59:35] that same spirit is in there, it'll do
[1:59:37] the same works and live the same kind of
[1:59:40] a separated life and do the works that
[1:59:42] he did. Aren't you glad for that? How
[1:59:44] many's glad you're part of the church?
[1:59:48] Hallelujah. I'm glad I'm part of the
[1:59:50] church
[1:59:51] and the works that he did you can do
[1:59:53] also. It wasn't just to brother
[1:59:55] Brandham. was to all of us. We may not
[1:59:58] do it all.
[2:00:03] But we will do the works.
[2:00:07] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:11] Uh anyway, brother Brandon said, "See,
[2:00:15] the headship and the body has become one
[2:00:18] unit." Think of
[2:00:21] that here at the resurrection of the
[2:00:23] church. You see, Christ and his bride
[2:00:25] will will will come together. But now
[2:00:28] he's saying the headship and the body
[2:00:31] has become one
[2:00:33] unit. Amen. It's God manifested in his
[2:00:37] people. That's the reason the husband
[2:00:40] and wife is no longer twain. They're
[2:00:42] one. God and his church is one. Christ
[2:00:46] in you. God's great revelation. Glory to
[2:00:50] God. even bearing his name. His name is
[2:00:54] Jesus the anointed. The reason he is
[2:00:56] called Jesus, he is the anointed. It's
[2:00:59] the anointed body of Christ proving
[2:01:02] manifested God like that body
[2:01:06] did. You are the anointed body
[2:01:10] manifesting the same God that that body
[2:01:14] did. And that body redeemed every one of
[2:01:18] these bodies. And through there, God
[2:01:21] works his three-fold manifestation going
[2:01:23] to the kingdom. See, risen, paid the
[2:01:27] price. We're redeemed. God has proved
[2:01:30] it, vindicated it, and we stand
[2:01:33] justified in Christ before him because
[2:01:36] he cannot pass judgment. For he's
[2:01:38] already judged that body in which I'm a
[2:01:40] part
[2:01:42] of. How am I a part of it? He says,
[2:01:44] "Well, here it is. It's in me." Amen.
[2:01:49] The word is in me. Is that what he said?
[2:01:53] Here is the secret. The word is in the
[2:01:56] bride.
[2:01:58] You're not accepting this message for
[2:02:01] not. That's not in vain. Every time
[2:02:04] you're believing this message, you're
[2:02:05] listening to the message. You say, "God,
[2:02:07] that's that's right. That's right.
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] If you abide in me and my words in you,
[2:02:14] then what you say, ask the father
[2:02:16] anything in my name, it'll be done
[2:02:18] because it's there. Can you say amen?
[2:02:21] The word is there. It's in
[2:02:24] you. Justified. Glory to God. Oh, if I
[2:02:27] can get the world to see that, why?
[2:02:29] There you are. There is the body of
[2:02:31] Christ living, standing,
[2:02:34] redeemed. Can you say amen? She's no
[2:02:37] longer standing as a sinner. She's
[2:02:40] standing redeemed, justified as though
[2:02:42] she never did it in the first
[2:02:44] place. Satan ain't using her mouth to
[2:02:47] speak evil things and negative things.
[2:02:49] But now the word is in the bride. And
[2:02:52] brother and Paul would say, "And the
[2:02:54] word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and
[2:02:57] in thine heart." That is the word of
[2:02:59] faith which we preach. Can you say amen?
[2:03:03] Justified in his sight. Why are we
[2:03:05] justified? We are his victory. How many
[2:03:08] believes that
[2:03:10] victory? Easter brought a
[2:03:15] victory and this resurrection of the
[2:03:17] church proved and brought a
[2:03:20] victory. We are his
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:25] victory. We come forth in these last
[2:03:28] days with this glorious gospel showing
[2:03:30] his victory. He died for this purpose
[2:03:33] and we are proof of his victory. Amen.
[2:03:36] When we see him coming down and living
[2:03:38] among the church, that's his victory. It
[2:03:40] shows that they couldn't keep him in the
[2:03:42] grave, neither then can they keep us.
[2:03:45] That's right. We're we're bound, right?
[2:03:49] We're already potentially arised because
[2:03:52] we've raised from dead unbelief in his
[2:03:54] word, from denominational creeds to an
[2:03:57] eternal word of the eternal God, which
[2:03:59] is him himself working through us,
[2:04:02] manifesting himself that he is the same.
[2:04:04] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, do
[2:04:07] you love
[2:04:08] him? Hallelujah. He's alive
[2:04:11] and Oh, he's
[2:04:15] alive and
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:23] well. The
[2:04:25] world and he is the
[2:04:32] same. He's the
[2:04:35] same
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:37] yesterday,
[2:04:41] [Music]
[2:04:50] today. Oh, sing it now. He's
[2:04:55] alive and
[2:04:57] well, living in me.
[2:05:00] [Music]
[2:05:03] Bless his holy name. Bless his holy
[2:05:08] name. Oh, he's the
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:12] same. He's the
[2:05:15] same
[2:05:18] yesterday,
[2:05:20] today, and
[2:05:23] forever.
[2:05:25] Jesus is alive.
[2:05:30] Oh, sing it
[2:05:32] again. Oh, he's
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:39] alive.
[2:05:44] Oh, to tell the world.
[2:05:50] [Music]
[2:05:53] Oh, he's the
[2:05:56] same
[2:05:59] yesterday,
[2:06:01] today, and
[2:06:04] forever.

[2:12:25] helped putting the tin up
[2:12:28] [Music]
[2:12:30] and that's just laboring in every
[2:12:33] aspect. I know sister
[2:12:36] Martha's been helping with the uh
[2:12:40] appointment schedule and
[2:12:43] uh those that are in the camp stay there
[2:12:46] and she hadn't been just feeling real
[2:12:49] well, but she's just been a real trooper
[2:12:51] and appreciate that very much.
[2:12:55] and sister Kim putting all her effort
[2:12:59] into it and
[2:13:01] getting everything prepared and these
[2:13:05] boys have been working very late at
[2:13:08] night and u doing the tent and putting
[2:13:12] lights putting all kinds of so I know
[2:13:15] the reward will be great on the other
[2:13:19] side and u looking forward to a
[2:13:22] wonderful time in the Lord
[2:13:25] And I I do ask that you pray for the
[2:13:27] meeting and really just uh ask God to to
[2:13:32] come in a special way and um that
[2:13:35] whoever comes
[2:13:38] will will just be
[2:13:40] blessed. Those if sinners come that they
[2:13:44] could find God or God will find them.
[2:13:48] sick, people needing
[2:13:51] delivered, God would just come and set
[2:13:53] them free. Church, we're going home and
[2:13:56] it's it's almost home time and we must

[2:14:10] meeting, it's it's for the kingdom of
[2:14:13] God. It's preparing. It's making way for
[2:14:16] God to speak to the people through his
[2:14:19] word. Amen. And he sent his word and
[2:14:22] healed them of all their diseases. And I
[2:14:26] just believe in the power of the word.

[2:14:31] wonderful day today in the
[2:14:40] Lord. Okay. Yeah. Uh we'll be praying
