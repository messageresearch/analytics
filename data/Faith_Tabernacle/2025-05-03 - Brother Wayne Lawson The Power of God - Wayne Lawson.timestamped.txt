[7:43] fire that fell at Pentecost which
[7:46] cleansed and made them clean, it is
[7:49] burning now within my heart. All glory

[8:25] or boast of worldly fame, they have all
[8:29] received their Pentecost baptized in
[8:32] Jesus' name and are telling now both far
[8:36] and wide. His power is yet the same. Oh,

[8:42] you one of them tonight? I'm one of

[9:05] of
[9:06] them. Yeah. They were gathered in the
[9:09] upper room, all praying in his name.
[9:13] They were baptized with the Holy Ghost
[9:16] and powerful service came. Now, what he
[9:20] did for them that day, he'll do for you
[9:23] the same. I'm so glad that I can say I'm
[9:27] one of them. Oh, I'm one of
[9:31] them. I'm one of

[9:49] of them. Verse four. How come my brother
[9:53] seek this blessing? It will cleanse your
[9:56] heart from sin. It will start the joy
[9:59] bells ringing and we'll keep the soul a
[10:02] flame. It is burning now within my
[10:05] heart. All glory to his name. I'm so

[10:26] them. I'm one of
[10:29] them. I'm so glad that I can sing. Can
[10:32] you turn around to your neighbor and
[10:34] say, "I'm one of them." I'm one of them.

[33:42] [Music]
[33:48] Amen. Let's just bow our heads and pray.
[33:51] Heavenly
[33:52] Father, Lord, as I bow my head to pray
[33:55] over these prayer requests. Father, I
[33:57] remember your prophet standing on the
[33:58] scene. Father, he said there's not a
[34:00] prayer he's ever prayed, Lord, that
[34:02] you've not answered him or told him why.
[34:04] Now, Father, we come with that
[34:06] expectation, Lord, as we bring Brother
[34:08] Matthew's daughter, Lord, and his wife
[34:10] before you, Father, asking you, Lord,
[34:12] that you would begin to move upon the
[34:14] scene, Father, in such a mighty way,
[34:16] Lord, that they couldn't explain it,
[34:18] Lord. that Lord, they would know that it
[34:20] would have to come from you. Now,
[34:21] Father, Lord, this mother, Lord,
[34:23] bringing this prayer request before you,
[34:26] Father, of her child, Lord, battling
[34:28] these mind battles, Lord. Lord, there's
[34:30] many unspoken prayer requests, Father,
[34:32] battling these very same things, Father,
[34:34] I'm asking you, Lord, as I stand in the
[34:36] gap, Father, with faith, Father, for
[34:38] them during this time, Lord, that you
[34:40] would begin to move upon the scene,
[34:42] Lord. everyone that would have a prayer,
[34:44] Lord, that Lord would be hidden in their
[34:46] heart, Lord, you would begin to move on
[34:47] it, Lord, in such a natural and
[34:49] supernatural way. Now, Father, we commit
[34:52] all of this into thine hands, Lord,
[34:54] knowing, Lord, that every prayer goes
[34:56] answered. Father, we commit this into
[34:59] thine hands. In the lovely name of the
[35:00] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Believe it.
[35:05] Amen. None can contend. Oh, your God.
[35:10] That's just the way it
[35:13] is. For you are God alone. You can be
[35:16] seated from before time
[35:19] begin. Lord, you are on your
[35:23] throne and you are God
[35:27] alone. And right now in the good times
[35:32] and bad as brother Ray Harold comes your
[35:36] throne. Lord, you are God alone. Oh, you
[35:41] are God
[35:43] alone from before time
[35:46] began. Lord, you are on your
[35:50] throne. And you are God
[35:54] alone. And right now, in the good times
[35:59] and
[36:00] bad, you are on your throne. Oh, you are
[36:05] God alone. Sing it again. You are God
[36:10] alone from before time
[36:13] began. Lord, you are on your
[36:17] throne and you are God
[36:21] alone. And right now in the good times
[36:26] and
[36:27] bad, you are on your throne.
[36:31] You are God
[36:35] alone. Amen. Do you believe he's God
[36:37] alone tonight?
[36:40] Amen. Amen. And right after, if we could
[36:42] have Sister Bethany Hatfield come up

[1:04:57] From a heart that he washed me. If I
[1:05:00] run, oh, I'm running. From a pastor he
[1:05:05] redeemed to the world it might look
[1:05:08] crazy. There's just no telling what
[1:05:12] you're going to
[1:05:14] do in our moment. Jesus gets a hold of
[1:05:23] you. Oh for anyone who knows the hope.
[1:05:28] They'll keep them moving on through your
[1:05:30] trouble days.
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:38] Anyone who knows they've got a future
[1:05:41] and a hope beyond the
[1:05:47] grave. No, every life's a different
[1:05:51] story. How he brought us out of darkness
[1:05:55] into
[1:05:57] light. Perfect light.
[1:06:01] Oh, there's no way to keep the bride
[1:06:04] silent. Every breast another chance to
[1:06:10] testify,
[1:06:12] testify. Oh, if I shout, no, I'm
[1:06:16] shouting. From a heart that's been
[1:06:18] washed. And if I run, no, I'm running.
[1:06:23] From a
[1:06:25] hearing to the world, it might go crazy.
[1:06:29] There's just no tell her what you're
[1:06:32] going to
[1:06:34] do. In the moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[1:06:39] you.
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] Oh my I
[1:06:47] see my name he changed as
[1:06:53] justify.
[1:06:55] Oh
[1:07:00] my name is Jesus
[1:07:04] testify. Come on and testify.
[1:07:08] Oh, if I shout, no I'm shouting. From a
[1:07:13] heart that he washed clean. If I run,
[1:07:17] no, I'm running. From a past that he
[1:07:21] reached to the world, it might go crazy.
[1:07:25] There's just no telling what you're
[1:07:28] going to
[1:07:30] do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[1:07:36] you.
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:58] The lost are saved.
[1:08:01] They find their
[1:08:04] way at the
[1:08:08] sound of your great
[1:08:12] name. All
[1:08:15] condemned, feel no
[1:08:19] shame at the
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:22] sound of your great name.
[1:08:27] Every
[1:08:29] fear it has no
[1:08:33] place at the
[1:08:36] sound of your great name.
[1:08:40] The
[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:43] enemy has to
[1:08:46] leave at the
[1:08:49] sound of your great
[1:08:54] name,

[1:10:02] are
[1:10:03] healed. Oh, and the dead are

[1:10:17] Jesus. Oh, worthy is the lamb that was
[1:10:23] slain for us. Oh, son of God and man.
[1:10:28] You are high and lifted
[1:10:31] up. And all the world will praise your

[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:38] name. Can we stand and sing it? All the
[1:10:43] weak, they find their
[1:10:47] strength at the
[1:10:50] sound. Your great
[1:10:53] name. Hungry
[1:10:56] souls receive
[1:11:00] praise at the
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:03] sound of your great
[1:11:06] name. The father
[1:11:09] lives. They find their
[1:11:13] rest at the
[1:11:15] sound of your great
[1:11:19] name. The sick are healed. Oh, and the
[1:11:23] dead are
[1:11:26] raised at the
[1:11:28] sound of your great name.
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:38] [Applause]
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:47] I am lifted
[1:11:52] up. Praise your
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:11:59] name. Amen. Well, how many's been
[1:12:02] touched by the master's
[1:12:06] hand? Bless the name of the
[1:12:12] Lord. I
[1:12:14] have enjoyed the presence of the Lord.
[1:12:17] I've I've enjoyed the the songs that
[1:12:20] have been
[1:12:21] sung. And what makes it so special is
[1:12:26] they're singing from experience.
[1:12:29] They're singing from battles that they
[1:12:33] have fought and they have won. Satan has
[1:12:37] tried to destroy their lives and yet he
[1:12:40] can't he can't take them out. They're
[1:12:43] still singing for the Lord. They still
[1:12:46] love the message of the hour.
[1:12:48] And I tell you what, it's hard just to
[1:12:51] sit down and when you see a real
[1:12:53] believer singing from the heart. It's
[1:12:56] hard just to sit there when you hear
[1:12:58] these preachers preaching from the
[1:13:00] heart. They've gone through their
[1:13:01] battles. They've gone through the
[1:13:03] things. They have faced these things and
[1:13:04] yet they're still believing. How many
[1:13:07] believers do we have in the building?
[1:13:10] Amen. I uh certainly uh you can be
[1:13:14] seated for just a moment, but certainly
[1:13:16] enjoyed the uh the service last night.
[1:13:19] Did you enjoy the service?
[1:13:23] Hallelujah. Uh powerful
[1:13:26] powerful service and um I've just
[1:13:29] enjoyed both and uh both services that
[1:13:32] we've had. and uh brother Matthew uh uh
[1:13:37] Matt Morris preached on the healer, the
[1:13:40] believer and the Pharisee. And u you
[1:13:43] know I uh brother Brandham talking about
[1:13:46] the Pharisee. He was a fundamental
[1:13:48] believer. And uh he said, you know, it
[1:13:52] was that same group of fundamental
[1:13:54] believers that put Jesus Christ on the
[1:13:57] cross and killed him because he had
[1:14:00] signs and wonders and they didn't
[1:14:03] believe it. That same spirit lives among
[1:14:06] churches today, religious people, not a
[1:14:09] bunch of infidels, fundamental. Place it
[1:14:12] right out there and they're exactly
[1:14:15] right. But they have a form of
[1:14:17] godliness. fundamentally right, but
[1:14:21] denying the power thereof. The power of
[1:14:24] what? The power of healing. The power of
[1:14:27] shouting.
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:30] There's something that makes us shout.
[1:14:33] There's something that gets us excited
[1:14:36] about the word of God. And he says it's
[1:14:39] a power. The power of healing, the power
[1:14:41] of shouting, the power of speaking in
[1:14:44] tongues, the power of interpreting, the
[1:14:47] power of the church moving just like it
[1:14:50] did in the beginning. Can you say amen?
[1:14:54] That he said in another place, the
[1:14:56] believers are the ones that's ordained
[1:14:59] and predestinated to the word. The
[1:15:03] minute they see it, they're
[1:15:05] satisfied. How many satisfied?
[1:15:08] That's why we ain't looking outside of
[1:15:10] this message. We're
[1:15:12] satisfied. We're satisfied that God
[1:15:15] vindicated this message. We're satisfied
[1:15:18] that God is moving among us. We're
[1:15:20] satisfied to know that he's still
[1:15:22] healing. He's still saving. He's still
[1:15:25] filling with the Holy Ghost. We're
[1:15:27] satisfied that he is supreme over
[1:15:30] everything and he reigns. And and no
[1:15:33] devil's going to uh uh defeat him. We're
[1:15:36] satisfied.
[1:15:38] Amen. He said life springs in them and
[1:15:42] they accept it. That's the disciples.
[1:15:45] There is no question in their mind about
[1:15:47] it at all. They follow right along. The
[1:15:50] disciples were believers. They just
[1:15:52] believe. And God still has disciples
[1:15:55] here today. Can you say amen? We ain't
[1:15:59] worshiping a man. We are worshiping the
[1:16:02] word. Amen. The person of the word. Can
[1:16:05] you say amen? and he's here among us
[1:16:08] tonight. And I'm excited to see what God
[1:16:12] is going to do for us this evening. And
[1:16:14] if you've come hungering, you've come
[1:16:16] expecting, well, your needs are going to
[1:16:18] be met. I promise you, God won't
[1:16:20] disappoint you at all. Amen. He's just
[1:16:23] that type of God. Amen. If you want to
[1:16:26] criticize, and Satan, as the prophet
[1:16:28] said, Satan will have plenty for you to
[1:16:30] criticize. But if you just get past all
[1:16:33] of that and just say, "God, fill my cup.
[1:16:35] I I I just want more of you. I promise
[1:16:38] you God will meet you right where you
[1:16:41] are. Amen. And uh it's a it's just a
[1:16:44] privilege to have brother Wayne Lawson
[1:16:48] here with us. And uh we certainly love
[1:16:52] him, love his ministry. And um I I I
[1:16:57] think we can truly say most of us
[1:17:00] ministers have been affected by his
[1:17:02] ministry in in one way or another. And
[1:17:06] uh uh one thing about Brother Wayne, he
[1:17:09] just he loves the message. He lives and
[1:17:12] breathes this message. He studies the
[1:17:15] message. That's all he wants is the
[1:17:16] message. And and and I I just I've uh
[1:17:20] you know, it's always a privilege to
[1:17:22] have him because uh I believe the people
[1:17:25] that's all they want is the message. We
[1:17:27] ain't looking for any fang dangled
[1:17:29] revelation out there. We just want the
[1:17:32] message. Amen. And so when we know that
[1:17:35] he gets behind the pullpit, we can just
[1:17:37] rest and knowing that nothing, no
[1:17:39] strange doctrine is going to be
[1:17:40] preached. He's just going to preach the
[1:17:43] message and we can say amen to it and
[1:17:45] watch God come among us. Can you say
[1:17:47] amen? And I believe that's the way it's
[1:17:49] going to be tonight. And if we could
[1:17:51] just stand to our feet, we had just a
[1:17:55] wonderful time of fellowship today with
[1:17:57] the ministers. And uh I certainly love
[1:18:00] and appreciate you ministers very much.
[1:18:02] and uh feel the least among you. Uh but
[1:18:06] I u uh just know that God has called
[1:18:08] great men of God in this hour. Amen. To
[1:18:11] proclaim the message of the hour. And
[1:18:14] I'm I'm thankful for that. But let's
[1:18:16] just sing this song. Here's my cup,
[1:18:18] Lord. Lift it up. Amen. And feel it,
[1:18:22] Lord. And how many's got your cups
[1:18:24] lifted, your soul lifted? Say, God, fill
[1:18:27] me over and over and over. Amen. Here's
[1:18:31] my
[1:18:33] cup,
[1:18:35] Lord. I lift it
[1:18:39] up,
[1:18:42] Lord. Come and
[1:18:47] quench this
[1:18:49] thirsting of my
[1:18:51] [Laughter]
[1:18:55] soul. Bread of heaven.
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:01] Just feed
[1:19:03] me. Well, I want no
[1:19:08] more. Here's my
[1:19:11] cup. Fill it up and make me.
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:27] I did
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:33] I come
[1:19:36] and this
[1:19:38] thirsty
[1:19:39] love my
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:45] soul can
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:50] I meet you I
[1:19:54] want no
[1:19:56] Oh, here's my
[1:20:00] cup. Fill it
[1:20:08] up. Amen. God bless you tonight. It's
[1:20:11] certainly a great honor to be in the
[1:20:13] house of the Lord here under this tent
[1:20:15] tonight. Amen. Where we have seen uh
[1:20:18] such an outpouring through the years of
[1:20:20] the great dynamics of the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:22] And Amen. And it puts an expectation in
[1:20:25] our heart that he'll do it again. Amen.
[1:20:28] Knowing that he is the same yesterday,
[1:20:30] today, and forever. That's one thing
[1:20:31] about God that don't change. He don't
[1:20:33] change from year to year. His uh
[1:20:36] anointing doesn't change from times and
[1:20:38] seasons, but it remains the same. Amen.
[1:20:41] And we certainly are thankful for that
[1:20:43] tonight. I I do want to say I appreciate
[1:20:45] Brother Sean and the Faith Tabernacle
[1:20:47] here for hosting these meetings years
[1:20:49] after year. Amen. I know there's a lot
[1:20:52] of responsibility. There's a lot of a
[1:20:54] lot of money invested. There's a lot of
[1:20:56] things that are done to host these
[1:20:58] meetings. And we certainly amen want him
[1:21:00] to know that we appreciate each each
[1:21:03] year. Amen. And to you that all come,
[1:21:06] God bless you for that. And Amen. Uh we
[1:21:09] certainly want to take just a moment and
[1:21:11] thank the the church and these lovely
[1:21:13] sisters that are doing such a good job
[1:21:14] feeding the people. Amen. God bless you
[1:21:17] sisters.
[1:21:19] It's
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:21] uh I know the Lord sees their
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] labors. We trust that God will bless
[1:21:28] them and reward them with great great
[1:21:31] blessing. Amen. We're uh we want to take
[1:21:34] uh just a moment tonight and amen to
[1:21:36] greet you from the church and uh True
[1:21:38] Word Tabernacle there. And we just want
[1:21:40] to uh ask the Lord that he may be able
[1:21:43] to move on these meetings tonight. And I
[1:21:45] just wonder uh just before we go to the
[1:21:48] Lord in prayer, how many would have a
[1:21:50] need tonight in your life that you would
[1:21:53] need the Holy Spirit to come by and
[1:21:54] touch you? Amen. I'm certainly uh aware
[1:21:58] that he is a high priest that is
[1:22:02] touched by the feeling of our
[1:22:04] infirmities. Amen. We want to if we
[1:22:06] could just to bow our hearts tonight.
[1:22:10] Heavenly Father, we want to thank you
[1:22:11] for this moment, Lord, in time, for this
[1:22:14] season that you have given us to
[1:22:16] live. Father, your prophet said that he
[1:22:19] would rather live now than in any other
[1:22:21] age. And I ask you tonight that your
[1:22:24] mercy would just come, Lord. Shake our
[1:22:28] awareness, Lord, our consciousness of
[1:22:30] this great moment in time. We ask you,
[1:22:34] Father, as we would look upon your word,
[1:22:36] that you would come tonight, Lord, and
[1:22:38] that you would touch the many needs that
[1:22:40] are in this building, the hands that's
[1:22:42] been lifted. Father, I ask you that you
[1:22:44] would come into this meeting
[1:22:45] strengthening hearts and lives. Lord, we
[1:22:48] we need you. And Lord, we believe that
[1:22:51] there is a way that tonight that our
[1:22:54] faith could slip into that unseen realm,
[1:22:57] Lord. And Father, that you would answer
[1:22:59] the need of these hearts, Father. And
[1:23:01] Lord, as we come to preach your word, to
[1:23:04] speak the things which you have placed
[1:23:05] upon our heart, we ask you that your
[1:23:08] great anointing would move through this
[1:23:09] congregation, Lord, blessing your
[1:23:11] people. And Lord Jesus, we ask you now
[1:23:14] that you would take the service, Lord,
[1:23:16] that you would use it for your glory and
[1:23:18] your honor. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:23:21] we pray. Amen. And amen. And God bless
[1:23:25] you tonight. And if you have your Bibles
[1:23:27] with you, Amen. We would like to turn
[1:23:29] into the word of God. Amen. Um I I
[1:23:32] certainly uh am greatly honored to be
[1:23:35] here among all these men of God that are
[1:23:37] here in the last couple services. We're
[1:23:39] going to be turning to 2 Timothy 1 and
[1:23:41] verse 7. Amen. 1 Corinthians 2 and verse
[1:23:45] 4. Amen. And u I I've certainly enjoyed
[1:23:48] those uh two services. What a blessing.
[1:23:51] Amen. And u you know where would we be
[1:23:54] without men of God to carry this
[1:23:56] word? Amen. And it's such a blessing to
[1:23:58] have them. Amen. In 2 Timothy chapter 1
[1:24:03] and verse 7, for God hath not given us
[1:24:06] the spirit of
[1:24:07] fear, but of
[1:24:09] power and of love and a sound
[1:24:13] mind in 1 Corinthians 2 and verse
[1:24:18] 4. And my speech and my
[1:24:22] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:24:25] man's wisdom, but in the demonstration
[1:24:28] of the spirit and of power. May God
[1:24:32] bless his word tonight. As you could be
[1:24:34] seated, if I could, I'd like to speak to
[1:24:36] you a little bit tonight. If I take a
[1:24:38] title, I want to talk to you about the
[1:24:40] power of God. About the power of God. My
[1:24:45] heart is uh full tonight of so many
[1:24:47] things uh that God has given us in this
[1:24:50] great age and amen under this messenger
[1:24:53] of all these great truths that's been
[1:24:55] restored to the church and the the
[1:24:57] things that God has done for us. But
[1:24:58] just in praying over the meeting and
[1:25:00] asking the Lord for direction, I just
[1:25:02] felt this slip into my heart. Amen. that
[1:25:05] I would speak to you tonight and and and
[1:25:07] uh just remind you that we serve a God
[1:25:11] and that God is has a power. And I want
[1:25:14] to talk to you tonight about the power
[1:25:17] of God. I don't I don't believe
[1:25:19] anybody's ever heard or thought about
[1:25:22] the power of God, but what didn't want
[1:25:24] to experience it. I really don't never
[1:25:26] know anybody that has ever uh uh thought
[1:25:29] so much or seen the ex the real
[1:25:32] manifestation of God and not want to
[1:25:34] want to have a part of that or to be a
[1:25:37] part of that. And and you know I I I in
[1:25:40] saying that tonight and we we we think
[1:25:42] about Amen. Uh about that. But can
[1:25:46] anyone have the power of God? That would
[1:25:48] be the the question, wouldn't it? Can
[1:25:50] anyone experience this? Could could
[1:25:52] anyone possess the power of God? Could
[1:25:55] Could anyone be able to partake of the
[1:25:58] great things of God? Amen. Can anyone
[1:26:00] have it? And I I would like to answer
[1:26:02] that as a real definitive yes they
[1:26:05] can. Yes, they can. The old can
[1:26:08] experience it. The young can experience.
[1:26:11] The educated, the uneducated, the
[1:26:14] wealthy, the poor. Amen. The colors, the
[1:26:17] races, every walk of life. Any man that
[1:26:20] would desire to experience God has a
[1:26:23] possibility to do so tonight. Amen. And
[1:26:26] and I say this, Jesus said, "If thou
[1:26:29] canst believe, all things are possible
[1:26:33] with God." If you remember the man took
[1:26:35] his child and threw it at the feet of
[1:26:37] Jesus and said, "Lord, Amen. I I if thou
[1:26:40] can't do anything." And the Lord's come
[1:26:42] back and he says, "If thou can't
[1:26:44] believe." Amen. It's not the question
[1:26:47] tonight of whether God can do it. The
[1:26:49] question tonight is, do we believe it?
[1:26:52] Amen. And if we can believe it tonight,
[1:26:54] all things are possible to them that
[1:26:57] believe. For it's more even, as the
[1:26:59] scripture would say in Mark the 16th
[1:27:01] chapter, that we were to go into the
[1:27:04] world and to preach the gospel to every
[1:27:06] creature. So, how far is it the power of
[1:27:09] God is reaching unto the whole world?
[1:27:11] Amen. And how many is going to be able
[1:27:14] to get a hold of it? every creature. He
[1:27:16] that believeth is baptized and shall be
[1:27:19] saved. But he that believeth shall not
[1:27:21] shall shall shall be damned. And these
[1:27:24] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:27:27] For in my name they shall cast out
[1:27:29] devils, and they shall speak with new
[1:27:32] tongues. They shall take up serpents,
[1:27:34] and if they drink any deadly thing, it
[1:27:36] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[1:27:37] hands upon the sick, and they shall
[1:27:41] recover. I believe tonight that the
[1:27:43] power of God is not just something that
[1:27:45] is accessible, but I believe it's been
[1:27:48] promised. I believe the power of God has
[1:27:50] been promised to every believer that can
[1:27:53] believe upon the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:56] As they asked the Lord in Acts 1 and8,
[1:27:58] they said, "Lord, when shall the kingdom
[1:28:00] be restored?" And Jesus said, "It's been
[1:28:03] put in the times and seasons, and my
[1:28:04] father has put it in his power, but ye
[1:28:08] shall receive power." after that the
[1:28:10] Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:28:12] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:28:15] Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria
[1:28:18] and unto the uttermost parts of the
[1:28:20] earth. For we recognize that, amen, that
[1:28:23] the power of God comes to the believer
[1:28:26] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:28] Now, I know there's a lot of people
[1:28:30] don't even believe in the baptism of the
[1:28:32] Holy Ghost. But let me assure you
[1:28:33] tonight, it's just as real as it ever
[1:28:36] was. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:39] just as much as a reality tonight as it
[1:28:42] was the day that Jesus made the promise.
[1:28:44] And he said, "Behold, Amen. Go ye in the
[1:28:47] city of Jerusalem and carry there until
[1:28:50] you be endued with power up on high."
[1:28:54] Amen. The Bible calls this, "I will send
[1:28:56] the promise of my father upon you." Of
[1:28:59] course, he's speaking of this in Luke
[1:29:01] 24:49. He's speaking of Isaiah the 28th
[1:29:04] chapter when it is promised that a rest
[1:29:07] would come unto the church with
[1:29:08] stammering lips and other tongues shall
[1:29:10] they speak these unto my people and a
[1:29:12] refreshing from the presence of God
[1:29:14] would come upon the church. There is a
[1:29:16] promise tonight that God would give a
[1:29:19] promise of the Holy Ghost to the church
[1:29:21] and it would give power unto that
[1:29:23] church. Not only is it a promise that
[1:29:26] you can experience it, but according to
[1:29:28] the Bible, this power is to work through
[1:29:31] every believer, but in the Bible, it
[1:29:33] says in John 14:12, "Verily I say unto
[1:29:36] ye, he that believeth on me, the works
[1:29:40] that I do shall he do also, and greater
[1:29:43] works, and this shall ye do because I go
[1:29:47] unto my father." Amen. Now Jesus as he's
[1:29:50] leaving is telling them, amen, the works
[1:29:53] that I do shall ye do also. Now in John
[1:29:57] 14:16, just a couple verses later, Jesus
[1:30:00] begins to say that I will pray the
[1:30:02] father, and he shall give unto thee
[1:30:05] another comforter that he may abide with
[1:30:07] you forever. So many people would run
[1:30:09] out then and say, see there, there's a
[1:30:11] great difference between Jesus and the
[1:30:14] Holy Ghost. And there's a great
[1:30:15] difference between the father and Jesus.
[1:30:18] But Jesus said, "I will pray the Father,
[1:30:20] and he shall give unto thee another
[1:30:22] comforter, that he may abide with you
[1:30:24] forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom
[1:30:27] the world cannot receive, because it
[1:30:30] seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but
[1:30:34] ye shall know him, for he dwelleth with
[1:30:38] you, and shall be in you." Watch this
[1:30:41] now. And I will not leave you
[1:30:44] comfortless. I will come unto ye yet a
[1:30:48] little while and the world shall see me
[1:30:50] no more but ye shall see me because I
[1:30:54] live ye live also. Amen. And at that day
[1:30:57] ye shall know that I am in the father
[1:31:00] and the father is in me in me and I in
[1:31:03] you. So tonight the power of God is
[1:31:06] residing resting in the church of the
[1:31:09] living God. You are the place where God
[1:31:12] has promised to display his power in the
[1:31:15] last days. He said, "I'll go away." That
[1:31:17] corporal body was going to leave the
[1:31:19] earth, but that was going to be sent
[1:31:20] back to the church. The spirit of Jesus
[1:31:23] Christ called the Holy Ghost, which is
[1:31:26] not an emotion, which is not a good
[1:31:28] feeling, which is not a doctrine, but a
[1:31:30] person. And the person of Jesus Christ
[1:31:33] has promised to come into this building
[1:31:35] tonight. He said, "Where two or three
[1:31:37] are gathered in my name, there I shall
[1:31:40] be in the midst of them, then the power
[1:31:42] of God is present tonight in this
[1:31:44] building. Just as real as it was the day
[1:31:48] that he walked on the Sea of Galilee,
[1:31:50] just as real as he was at the tomb when
[1:31:53] he met Mary. just as real as he was in
[1:31:56] Acts the 2nd chapter when he filled them
[1:31:58] with the Holy Ghost. That same pillar of
[1:32:01] fire, not a corporal body, a
[1:32:03] supernatural body of the light of God is
[1:32:06] still alive. It's still real. It's still
[1:32:09] in the church. It's abiding. The power
[1:32:12] of God is here and it's real and you can
[1:32:16] have a part of it tonight. If thou canst
[1:32:19] believe all things
[1:32:24] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. People
[1:32:27] say, "Oh, that's back in the days of the
[1:32:30] apostles. That's back in the days of
[1:32:34] Pentecost." My goodness, friends, how
[1:32:37] the church of the living God has been
[1:32:40] growing from those dark ages, how
[1:32:43] they've been growing up from the feet
[1:32:45] unto the head. And that head is Christ.
[1:32:48] That intelligence, it's how the body's
[1:32:51] going to move is by that head. You know,
[1:32:53] the Bible said that the government shall
[1:32:56] be upon his shoulders. In Isaiah 9 and6,
[1:32:59] it says it very clearly that the
[1:33:01] government shall be upon his shoulders.
[1:33:04] And the prophet of God said this very
[1:33:05] clearly. He said, listen, what is that
[1:33:08] shoulders? He said, it's the body.
[1:33:11] It's the body. It's the body of
[1:33:13] believers that the government of God is
[1:33:15] to be on those shoulders. What is the
[1:33:17] shoulders? but the body. So there's
[1:33:20] where the real true church speaks in his
[1:33:23] power. Theirs where apostolic power
[1:33:26] returns to this church is when the
[1:33:29] government shall be upon their
[1:33:31] shoulders. There is coming a real
[1:33:34] church. I believe it. I believe there's
[1:33:36] a real church. And may I say tonight, I
[1:33:39] don't believe there's coming a church. I
[1:33:41] certainly believe there's a church. And
[1:33:43] I believe it's arrived. I believe we
[1:33:45] have said for years there's coming a
[1:33:47] bride. But I believe we can announce it
[1:33:50] tonight. The alpha has become the omega.
[1:33:53] The bride is on the scene. She's here
[1:33:56] tonight manifesting in the power of God.
[1:33:59] I know and realize, amen, that people a
[1:34:02] lot of times they said, "Brother Wayne,
[1:34:03] the power of God." Amen. How could it be
[1:34:06] here? The prophet of God said it like
[1:34:08] this. You'll never bring a church to
[1:34:10] life. You'll never do it on some
[1:34:12] tradition. You might bring members by
[1:34:14] the millions, but you'll never bring the
[1:34:16] power of God until we get back to that
[1:34:18] original word again. Amen. World falling
[1:34:21] apart. Brother B said the church cannot
[1:34:23] run without the power of God through
[1:34:25] that word. And the Holy Ghost will only
[1:34:28] confirm the word of God. And that's what
[1:34:30] it's here to do. The anointing is here
[1:34:33] to confirm the word. May I say to you
[1:34:35] tonight, we have the word. I believe
[1:34:38] we've had the messenger of the age.
[1:34:40] We've had our seventh angel. We've had
[1:34:42] the shout. We've had the opening of the
[1:34:45] book. We've had the restoration of the
[1:34:47] apostolic doctrines. Amen. But when God
[1:34:50] sent his word, he was going to send the
[1:34:53] anointing with that word, the power of
[1:34:55] God to fulfill it and to make it live.
[1:34:59] What good is a dead letter without a
[1:35:01] power to make it live? Now, the power of
[1:35:04] God that was in that bridegroom is the
[1:35:08] same power to be in that bride.
[1:35:11] When God took our Lord Jesus up to the
[1:35:14] up to the cross, he took him to Calvary
[1:35:17] and he tore him apart. And y'all know
[1:35:20] the symbology was making a covenant that
[1:35:23] you would tear a an animal apart. And
[1:35:26] brother Bam said they would stand on
[1:35:27] each side of the of the beast and they
[1:35:30] would they would prophesy over it one to
[1:35:32] another and anybody that broke the
[1:35:34] covenant was like the dead beast. And
[1:35:36] brother man said, "But God took the body
[1:35:38] of Jesus for our covenant." And he tore
[1:35:41] the body of Jesus apart for you and I.
[1:35:44] And when he broke that covenant, he said
[1:35:46] what he did is he tore the spirit from
[1:35:48] the body and took the body up into
[1:35:51] heaven. He said then he sent that spirit
[1:35:54] back on Easter morning. Amen. And he
[1:35:57] sent that spirit back down to the
[1:35:59] church. So the church when this covenant
[1:36:02] is brought into full strength. Now, the
[1:36:04] prophet is teaching us here that when
[1:36:06] that spirit was given back there, amen,
[1:36:08] on the day of Pentecost, he was telling
[1:36:10] us it wasn't even in full strength at
[1:36:12] that time. Of course, it was given, but
[1:36:15] it hadn't been made to the place of
[1:36:18] manifesting the son of man as of yet. It
[1:36:21] was manifesting the son of God. Amen.
[1:36:23] And then that first church, amen, the
[1:36:26] word of God was real and the word of God
[1:36:28] was powerful. Amen. But it was right
[1:36:30] there. Amen. that God was teaching us
[1:36:33] that someday, amen, this same spirit was
[1:36:36] going to return in the latter days and
[1:36:39] it would return in its full strength in
[1:36:42] the church of the living God. This
[1:36:44] covenant when it is confirmed, these
[1:36:46] people that go into this body here of
[1:36:48] the bride, it'll be the exactly same
[1:36:51] spirit that was upon Christ, it'll do
[1:36:54] the same things, have the same ministry,
[1:36:57] have the same power. It'll come together
[1:37:00] word by word, the same.
[1:37:04] It'll be the same spirit that was upon
[1:37:07] him that'll be upon this bride. You
[1:37:11] never heard brother Random stand there
[1:37:13] in a prayer line with that Messiah sign
[1:37:15] and say, "This is what Paul did."
[1:37:19] Every time he was reinstating the
[1:37:21] ministry of Jesus Christ because there
[1:37:24] had been a dispensational change. This
[1:37:27] bride had turned a corner from the son
[1:37:30] of God dispensation that the son of man
[1:37:33] now was descending into the age that
[1:37:36] here it is in the bride form. There is
[1:37:39] to be a display of the omnipotence of
[1:37:42] God that he could take a church out of
[1:37:44] dead creeds and denomination and fill it
[1:37:47] with the power of God until the strength
[1:37:49] would return just like it was in Jesus
[1:37:53] Christ. Oh yes, sir. Somebody said,
[1:37:56] "Well, I thought it was long dead." I
[1:37:58] want you to know it's alive.
[1:38:01] Amen. Just like a seed goes into the
[1:38:04] ground, it has to die in the ground,
[1:38:06] doesn't it? It has to die. And Jesus
[1:38:09] died when they put him in the tomb.
[1:38:11] Brother Brandon said, "Don't think he
[1:38:13] was partly alive." He was dead. The body
[1:38:16] was dead. Brother said he was so dead
[1:38:18] the heavens shut up. The sun wouldn't
[1:38:20] shine. The earth was quaking. He was so
[1:38:23] dead he was a cold, dead formal thing
[1:38:25] laying in that grave. Amen. But see, God
[1:38:29] couldn't leave it there because it was
[1:38:31] his body.
[1:38:33] And the way he identified that's my body
[1:38:37] is when the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:38:40] returned into that tomb. He didn't get
[1:38:42] in the rock. He didn't get in the tomb.
[1:38:45] He didn't get on the seats. Amen. He got
[1:38:48] into his body and raised him up and
[1:38:51] shook him before the world. Amen. To let
[1:38:53] them know that Jesus is not just a man.
[1:38:57] He is God's supreme deity. He was the
[1:39:01] body of almighty God. I tell you
[1:39:03] tonight, I certainly believe he's still
[1:39:06] Amen. that same God and that same
[1:39:08] reality. My when I think about it
[1:39:11] tonight, I think about the power of God
[1:39:13] that would enter that enter that life.
[1:39:15] Brother man will tell us this. He said
[1:39:18] see what happens. He says it's the first
[1:39:20] time of course when Jesus was rose from
[1:39:22] the dead. He said now it was just like
[1:39:25] when he was resurrected he says see like
[1:39:28] Christ was the first one that was raised
[1:39:31] from the dead. I love that. Don't you?
[1:39:34] Christ was the first one that raised
[1:39:36] from the dead. And he said when he come
[1:39:38] out of that tomb, he was waved over
[1:39:41] those other seeds.
[1:39:44] He was a waving of a sheath. Now, what
[1:39:47] was he being waved for? He was waving to
[1:39:51] let them know that it had
[1:39:54] returned. Brother said, "And what was
[1:39:57] it? The first one to come to maturity.
[1:39:59] It was the first one to prove it was a
[1:40:02] wheat. Hallelujah. I'm sure you see what
[1:40:05] I'm talking about. When that body of
[1:40:08] Jesus come out of that tomb, he was the
[1:40:10] first one from the dead. And he was
[1:40:13] waved over the people that the maturity
[1:40:17] of the power of God had returned in that
[1:40:19] body and lifted him. And he lifted him
[1:40:21] up. And brother Bam says, "See, oh, you
[1:40:23] see what I'm talking about? It was waved
[1:40:25] over the people." And now for the first
[1:40:28] time, I love how he says things, you
[1:40:30] know, just in case you think this has
[1:40:32] been happening down through the ages, he
[1:40:34] clarifies it for you. And for the first
[1:40:37] time, there will come forth for the
[1:40:39] bright age, a resurrection out, a part
[1:40:43] denominationalism. There'll be a message
[1:40:46] that the maturity of the word has
[1:40:49] returned again in its full power. I got
[1:40:53] a message. The power of God has returned
[1:40:58] in his full power. Everything and
[1:41:00] everywhere, everything that was in that
[1:41:03] first power is in this power. It is a
[1:41:06] resurrection. What a message of full
[1:41:08] maturity of the word of God. I tell you
[1:41:11] what, this bride ain't left without a
[1:41:13] message. Makes me want to run to the
[1:41:16] hilltops. Get the loudest mic I could
[1:41:19] find. I got a message. I'm running with
[1:41:22] a message. The power of God has returned
[1:41:27] to the church. You are not a powerless
[1:41:29] church. You are not a powerless people.
[1:41:32] We are not a bunch of weaklings looking
[1:41:34] for a hiding place. I tell you, it's the
[1:41:37] church of the living God that's been
[1:41:39] anointed with the power of God as she
[1:41:42] might be in the place God called her to
[1:41:44] be in.
[1:41:46] And for the first time,
[1:41:51] the word of God is turned back into its
[1:41:53] power and being waved over the people.
[1:41:57] Yes, sir. By the same signs and the same
[1:42:01] wonders.
[1:42:03] Oh my goodness. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:07] Why was Brother Bam telling all those
[1:42:09] testimonies?
[1:42:11] It certainly wasn't to lift himself up.
[1:42:14] Brother man was not telling you about
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:17] manifestations and the power of God that
[1:42:20] could speak a squirrel when there was no
[1:42:23] squirrel. He could talk to a storm and
[1:42:26] make it leave and finish his Tampa trip.
[1:42:29] He could go on a walk with God and turn
[1:42:32] back into a young man again. It was done
[1:42:35] by the power of God. There was no school
[1:42:37] out there on the mountain. There was no
[1:42:39] schoolhouse over there in the woods.
[1:42:42] Amen. But the one that wrote the Bible
[1:42:44] was right there dwelling in a human
[1:42:47] being and the power of God was working
[1:42:49] through him. So he was telling you, "Man
[1:42:52] can't create, but I created out there in
[1:42:54] the woods. Man can't speak away cancers,
[1:42:58] but I spoke away cancer. Man cannot tell
[1:43:01] a storm or stand still, but I stole a
[1:43:03] storm to stand still." What's he telling
[1:43:05] you? It's back. It's back. It's not just
[1:43:09] back to Pentecost. It's back to the
[1:43:12] Garden of Eden where Adam was over the
[1:43:17] atmospheres. Hallelujah. There has been
[1:43:20] no sons manifested like this since the
[1:43:23] days of Adam and Eve. And God has
[1:43:25] restored to you,
[1:43:27] [Applause]
[1:43:31] church. You got more power than
[1:43:33] justification. You got more power than
[1:43:36] just sanctification. You got more power
[1:43:38] than just a baptism of the spirit. But
[1:43:41] that same Jesus that raised from the
[1:43:43] dead has returned in the form of the
[1:43:47] bride of Jesus Christ manifesting his
[1:43:50] word. There's been a
[1:43:54] marriage and in this evening time there
[1:43:57] shall be light. Brother man said the
[1:44:00] same great power of Christ that would
[1:44:02] raise the church like it did back there
[1:44:04] in the western people. He said that same
[1:44:06] great church. Amen. How it would do it
[1:44:09] there and how it would do it here. It's
[1:44:11] the great power of Christ that would
[1:44:14] come upon the
[1:44:16] church. That is evening time
[1:44:22] evangelism. Oh, how this message changed
[1:44:27] evangelist. How it changed pastors and
[1:44:30] teachers and apostles. We're not just
[1:44:33] repeating some creed we learned from
[1:44:35] some doctor of divinity. We have
[1:44:38] experienced the power of the living God.
[1:44:41] We have received invitation that God has
[1:44:44] sent a prophet and we now have the word.
[1:44:50] Not the common theology but the word and
[1:44:53] power.
[1:44:55] It's different folks. Word and power is
[1:44:57] different than word and theology. And I
[1:44:59] and I I say very clearly. Amen. Because
[1:45:01] look, the the the word, brother Bam says
[1:45:04] it very Jesus says it.
[1:45:07] Amen. It'll just kill you if it's a dead
[1:45:09] letter.
[1:45:12] [Applause]
[1:45:14] But this word returned
[1:45:16] with power.
[1:45:19] It returned in power.
[1:45:22] That we wouldn't lean on
[1:45:24] theology. Yes, sir. That we wouldn't
[1:45:27] lean to
[1:45:28] education. We wouldn't lean to the
[1:45:30] intellect. Come on. I can hear the
[1:45:33] prophet saying it now. Don't lean to
[1:45:35] your own
[1:45:39] understanding. For there's a way that
[1:45:41] seemth right unto a man. But the end of
[1:45:45] that way, the world is falling apart
[1:45:47] again because they didn't take the
[1:45:50] thinking man filter and realize you
[1:45:53] can't think your way out of it. You
[1:45:55] can't figure your way out of it. Come
[1:45:56] on, church. Amen. How many nations today
[1:45:59] are looking at tribulation ready to fall
[1:46:01] at any time? And some are saying even
[1:46:04] let tribulation come. Persecution's
[1:46:06] going to drive the church together. Oh,
[1:46:08] I know you had some early quotes like
[1:46:10] that. But don't miss the corner of 1964
[1:46:13] and feast of trumpets when brother
[1:46:15] teaches us it won't be persecution.
[1:46:17] It'll be the revealing of the word that
[1:46:19] sets the bride into this rapture. What
[1:46:22] did he say? Not persecution, but the
[1:46:24] power of God will put this bride in the
[1:46:28] rapture. Listen, if you want to go in
[1:46:30] the rapturing of the church, you better
[1:46:32] exercise in the power of God that'll
[1:46:35] manifest his word in this age. This is
[1:46:38] not a dead letter.
[1:46:42] This is the power of God under
[1:46:43] salvation.
[1:46:47] Oh, I think about this. Amen. I think
[1:46:50] about this. That same spirit in Matthew
[1:46:54] 28:18, the Bible said Jesus said, "All
[1:46:57] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:47:01] earth." Reverend said, "All power." If
[1:47:03] there was another God, he didn't have
[1:47:04] any power.
[1:47:08] You got a God in this world. He's a
[1:47:10] powerless God.
[1:47:13] Amen. But my Bible said all power.
[1:47:16] That means omnipotence. All
[1:47:19] right. Now watch Brother Band tell us
[1:47:21] this in the Patmas vision. Remember and
[1:47:23] keep this in mind. That's quote.
[1:47:25] Remember and keep this in mind. All that
[1:47:28] God
[1:47:29] was he poured into Christ. He was the
[1:47:33] fullness of the Godhead bodily. He's
[1:47:34] quote Colossians. And all that was in
[1:47:37] Christ, he poured it.
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:42] and all that was in Christ,
[1:47:46] healings and miracles, the divine powers
[1:47:50] and
[1:47:51] manifestations, everything that made the
[1:47:54] word come to pass in his life, he's
[1:47:57] going to pour it into the church because
[1:48:00] it was God who was above us and it was
[1:48:03] God who was with us. But tonight, my
[1:48:07] friend, the promise of God is God is in
[1:48:10] us. Not just any God, not a not an idol,
[1:48:14] not a God of our imagination, but the
[1:48:16] God of heaven. Elohim himself has
[1:48:19] descended into the church to manifest
[1:48:22] his power in the age that I'm living in.
[1:48:25] Let me say the same power that raised
[1:48:27] Jesus from the dead is right here in
[1:48:30] this building now, abiding in the body
[1:48:33] of the church of the living God. For I
[1:48:35] am the vine and ye are the branches and
[1:48:39] without
[1:48:41] me you will do nothing.
[1:48:46] I remember as a young preacher I read
[1:48:48] that scripture one day and I was
[1:48:50] meditating Lord what does it mean? What
[1:48:52] does it mean? And I can't can't tell you
[1:48:54] how uneducated I was when I first become
[1:48:57] a Christian. And I'll just tell you
[1:48:58] simply I didn't know if Matthew was Old
[1:49:01] Testament or New. So if that tells you
[1:49:03] anything, I actually I met the author
[1:49:06] before I read his book.
[1:49:14] How do you know you met the author? Cuz
[1:49:15] I agreed with everything he wrote.
[1:49:19] And I studying over that scripture one
[1:49:21] day. What's that really mean? Without
[1:49:23] me, you can do nothing. And I was
[1:49:25] sitting in a little church. So, I walked
[1:49:26] in, sat down, and they were just having
[1:49:28] a little uh Saturday night or Wednesday
[1:49:29] night service, some midweek type
[1:49:31] meeting. And I just came in, sat down,
[1:49:33] and the brother, the pastor saw me come
[1:49:34] in, and I just a young preacher, and I
[1:49:36] ain't preached, but a couple times I
[1:49:38] come in, sat down, and he looked over at
[1:49:40] me. He said, "Brother Lawson, come bring
[1:49:41] the word
[1:49:43] tonight." All right. I didn't have
[1:49:45] nothing but that scripture I've been
[1:49:47] thinking about. So, I started down that
[1:49:49] path. I'm the vine, you're the branches,
[1:49:51] and without me, you'll do nothing. And
[1:49:53] when I got toward the end of the sermon,
[1:49:55] I remember it like it was yesterday, I
[1:49:57] started preaching on that without me,
[1:49:59] you will do nothing, but with me, you
[1:50:02] can do all things. And I said to I said
[1:50:04] to the little church there, I said,
[1:50:06] "Listen, if you come in here tonight and
[1:50:08] you are depressed or you're under some
[1:50:09] kind of anxiety, you don't have to leave
[1:50:12] here like you came, but you can be free
[1:50:15] right now. And listen, just as sure as
[1:50:17] I'm standing here, I seen a a black uh a
[1:50:20] black thing come right off of the a
[1:50:22] woman sitting on the end of the left
[1:50:23] pew. And she'd come right out like that
[1:50:25] and went right down the hall and out the
[1:50:28] back door. It was so real. I turned
[1:50:30] around and asked the preacher behind me,
[1:50:32] "Did you see that?"
[1:50:36] Because you see, we had entered a
[1:50:38] spiritual realm. Now the brethren didn't
[1:50:40] see it with his own eyes, but I had been
[1:50:43] asking the Lord, what does that
[1:50:45] scripture really mean? Do you see? We
[1:50:48] can as a man take words of intellect and
[1:50:51] stimulate the intellectual power.
[1:50:53] And we can take and put words together
[1:50:56] to itch the ear and to make you think
[1:50:58] that we're something as we speak and
[1:51:00] spellbound the people by our abilities
[1:51:03] to speak. But you don't move spirits
[1:51:06] with education.
[1:51:07] You don't move spirits by intellectual
[1:51:10] conceptions. Without me, you can heal no
[1:51:14] one. Without me, you can save no one.
[1:51:18] Without me, see the works that I do, you
[1:51:21] shall do because I will be in you. I'll
[1:51:25] tell you something tonight. If you want
[1:51:27] to see the power of God, let a believer
[1:51:29] just begin to believe that he's the same
[1:51:32] yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:51:34] you'll see miracles begin to take place
[1:51:36] on the most simple scriptures because it
[1:51:39] doesn't come by knowledge. It comes by
[1:51:42] heartfelt faith in the word of God. I
[1:51:46] certainly am a believer tonight and I
[1:51:48] believe the same power that was in Jesus
[1:51:50] Christ is in the church of the living
[1:51:52] God.
[1:51:54] I believe it. I believe brother Bam said
[1:51:56] and that same power hallelujah. Let the
[1:52:00] fundamentalists say, let them people who
[1:52:02] deny the power of God say it's wrong.
[1:52:05] But the same power that spoke the world
[1:52:08] into existence is in those people that's
[1:52:11] got the Holy Ghost. Men and women, it's
[1:52:14] time you found out who you are. The
[1:52:17] devil's just trying to hide you back,
[1:52:19] tell you some little trotten down
[1:52:21] something, but you're not. You're sons
[1:52:24] and daughters of
[1:52:25] God. Make the announcement. Deity is not
[1:52:29] in
[1:52:31] heaven. Deity is in you. You are the
[1:52:35] tabernacle of the deity of almighty God.
[1:52:39] Come on now. Let's deify Jesus Christ.
[1:52:41] Could we? Let's deify him. Let's not
[1:52:43] leave him as the second person of a
[1:52:45] Godhead. Jesus is both Lord and Christ.
[1:52:49] Somebody said, "Brother Wayne, you ain't
[1:52:50] got no scripture to call him God." But
[1:52:52] when Thomas laid his hands upon his
[1:52:54] scars, he said, "My Lord.
[1:52:58] and my God. He was more than a man. He
[1:53:02] was supreme deity.
[1:53:05] Say what does that matter? Because if
[1:53:07] you can see the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:53:10] and you say deities and you say Jesus is
[1:53:13] in you.
[1:53:15] I've got a three-year-old or
[1:53:16] fouryear-old granddaughter. She'll tell
[1:53:18] Jesus is in my heart. Well, let me say
[1:53:21] this. He's the kind of God with the kind
[1:53:23] of power that you can't dilute him.
[1:53:27] If you put God in a three-year-old,
[1:53:29] there's power in a three-year-old. If
[1:53:31] you put God in an old woman or a young
[1:53:34] woman or an old man or a young man or an
[1:53:38] educated or an uneducated man, it don't
[1:53:41] make any difference. Get God in them and
[1:53:44] power will be in them because he is the
[1:53:47] omnipotent
[1:53:49] God. Hallelujah. He's the omnipotent
[1:53:53] God.
[1:53:54] I know people get to the place they get
[1:53:57] discouraged. I get it. They get
[1:54:00] discouraged. But let me tell you this.
[1:54:02] The same power that was in Jesus Christ
[1:54:04] is in every son and daughter of God. And
[1:54:07] all that was in God has been poured into
[1:54:10] the church. The power that has been put
[1:54:13] in you is a resurrected power.
[1:54:18] I know y'all know the difference.
[1:54:20] There's the power of resurrection, but
[1:54:22] then there's resurrected power. In other
[1:54:25] words, power that have been used in
[1:54:27] other ages or other times. Now, if I
[1:54:31] said to you, I drop this
[1:54:33] handkerchief and but I reach in my
[1:54:36] pocket and get another that looks like
[1:54:38] it, that is a replacement of a
[1:54:41] handkerchief. But if I reach down and
[1:54:44] get the same handkerchief, I have
[1:54:47] resurrected the handkerchief. Listen.
[1:54:50] And the power that was in Jesus Christ,
[1:54:53] Amen. The prophet of God said, has been
[1:54:56] resurrected in its last day. His
[1:55:00] resurrection power has been resurrected
[1:55:03] for the church of the living God. We're
[1:55:06] not operating under a different power.
[1:55:10] It's the same.
[1:55:13] the same in every aspect
[1:55:16] except for the corporal body.
[1:55:20] Now, that's some pretty powerful stuff,
[1:55:22] folks.
[1:55:24] I know that we're in an age lots of
[1:55:26] discouragements are happening.
[1:55:29] And I know when it comes to the power of
[1:55:31] God, it's a great journey and requires
[1:55:34] pressing.
[1:55:35] requires pressing through trials and
[1:55:38] discouragement, disappointments, fusses,
[1:55:40] feuds, issues of every kind to try to
[1:55:45] get the church to stop.
[1:55:48] Isn't this something Brother Brandham
[1:55:49] says, he said, they said, "Brother
[1:55:51] Brandom, the people, if you're not
[1:55:52] careful, you'll take them too far."
[1:55:56] He said, "I'll tell you what. Why don't
[1:55:58] they point it to millions that didn't go
[1:55:59] far enough?
[1:56:01] [Applause]
[1:56:03] We're not trying to take you too far. We
[1:56:06] just want you to go to your potential.
[1:56:09] We want you to get to the what God
[1:56:11] promised you you can have. If he
[1:56:14] promised a million dollars, why would
[1:56:16] you stop at a h 100,000,
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:22] brother Dale? It belongs to us. I want
[1:56:25] everything that belongs to me.
[1:56:29] If you wasn't here Wednesday night, go
[1:56:31] listen to that sermon cuz he piled up
[1:56:33] some realities. It belongs to you.
[1:56:37] Amen. And the prophet of God speaking
[1:56:39] about Elijah and Elisha, he said, Elijah
[1:56:42] told that young Elisha, you better turn
[1:56:44] around and go back cuz this is going to
[1:56:46] get a little hard.
[1:56:49] Do you you do you hear that? Amen.
[1:56:52] Elijah told his followers, you better
[1:56:54] just go on back if you want cuz this
[1:56:56] going to get a little hard.
[1:56:58] So if you're not in it for the finish,
[1:57:01] you might as well just go
[1:57:04] home cuz this is not going to get
[1:57:07] easier. This is not going to get easier.
[1:57:10] Manifesting the supernatural is not
[1:57:12] going to get easier. Having tent
[1:57:14] meetings are not going to get easier.
[1:57:16] Having the power of God is not going to
[1:57:18] get easier. that every gun in hell is
[1:57:22] trained against the sons and daughters
[1:57:24] of God that believe in the power of God
[1:57:28] through the manifesting of his spirit.
[1:57:31] I'll tell you, every devil in hell has
[1:57:32] come out against it. And everything that
[1:57:34] could discourage a man, woman, or child
[1:57:37] has been thrown at us. And even Elijah,
[1:57:41] even the messenger said, "This is going
[1:57:43] to get hard."
[1:57:47] Now y'all, I'm I'm a studier. Brother
[1:57:49] Bam, y'all know that. And I heard him
[1:57:51] say, "If somebody tells you this is a
[1:57:53] flyer, beta ease," he said, "they're a
[1:57:55] liar."
[1:57:57] He said, "Either they're a liar or
[1:57:59] they've never experienced the walk."
[1:58:03] In other words, they don't know what
[1:58:04] they're talking about. But even the
[1:58:06] angel told Brother Random, "Thou hast
[1:58:08] chose
[1:58:11] the harder way." Remember, there's an
[1:58:14] easier route. You can feed the cattle on
[1:58:16] the other side of the river, but broad
[1:58:19] is that way. That it leadth unto
[1:58:23] destruction, but a hard way the children
[1:58:26] have walked. Amen. But the prophet told
[1:58:28] us very clearly that the way, Amen, is
[1:58:30] for character building.
[1:58:33] Because power,
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:36] the power of God without character,
[1:58:41] it's demonic.
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:44] But when you get the power of God with
[1:58:46] the character of God, oh brother, it's
[1:58:49] fit to rule.
[1:58:53] Brother Bam said, "Oh, that man of God
[1:58:56] who's once faced this." He said, "Let me
[1:58:58] tell you this." Or been throw across his
[1:59:01] shoulder, that robe of God's
[1:59:02] righteousness and power. He said, "It's
[1:59:05] not too easy for that man to turn back."
[1:59:09] Now, I tell you what, I I know what I'm
[1:59:11] talking about. If you ever if you ever
[1:59:13] had that throat across your shoulders
[1:59:14] once, you ever stand and see the power
[1:59:17] of God raise the dead or open blind eyes
[1:59:20] or heal the sick or take a drunk and
[1:59:22] make him sober, make a preacher out of
[1:59:24] it. You ever see that, you're not easily
[1:59:27] displayed or turned away from that. Oh,
[1:59:30] the way may get hard, but that don't
[1:59:33] mean we just tuck tail and run. We're
[1:59:35] not a bunch of cowards.
[1:59:38] We're not afraid to stand with the power
[1:59:41] of God. Oh, Brother Wayne, what about
[1:59:43] all the fanaticism? What about it? Why
[1:59:47] is everybody always worried about the
[1:59:48] fanaticism when we got all this
[1:59:52] real? Take your eyes off of the
[1:59:55] fanaticism and get it back on the real
[1:59:58] as a real power. There's a real
[2:00:03] message. Come on, church. There's a real
[2:00:05] seven thunders. There's a real bride
[2:00:08] age. There's a real son of man. There's
[2:00:10] a real coming of the Lord. There's a
[2:00:13] real message. There's real shouting.
[2:00:16] There's real worship. There's real
[2:00:19] dancing. There's a real experience with
[2:00:25] God. I don't care what the fanatics are
[2:00:28] doing. I don't even care. Help me see
[2:00:31] the power of God.
[2:00:33] [Applause]
[2:00:35] Brother Bam said, he said, I say this
[2:00:37] when I heard the pastor say this morning
[2:00:39] that many people are becoming
[2:00:40] discouraged.
[2:00:43] He said, "What we need, brother, is to
[2:00:44] take courage. What we need is to be
[2:00:48] encouraged. Trials may come, but we was
[2:00:51] never promised to be immune from them."
[2:00:54] But he'll give us grace to go through
[2:00:56] them.
[2:00:58] Hallelujah.
[2:01:00] Brother Wayne, I'm in the greatest trial
[2:01:01] of my life. Get ready. Somebody get
[2:01:04] ready. You're about to experience the
[2:01:07] greatest grace of your
[2:01:10] life. He said with every temptation, he
[2:01:13] offers a way of escape. And if the
[2:01:17] temptation is great, brother, the escape
[2:01:19] is going to be
[2:01:21] wonderful. Amen. This world's getting
[2:01:23] worse and worse. Tribulation is coming.
[2:01:26] Gross darkness is upon us. But God has
[2:01:30] provided a way of escape. We're going
[2:01:33] home on a cloud of power and the glory.
[2:01:37] I'm talking about the power of God. It's
[2:01:39] going to sweep through the church one of
[2:01:41] these mornings between 6:00 and 9. And
[2:01:44] this little bride is going to be caught
[2:01:47] up. Make fun of them if you want to, but
[2:01:50] it's going to be the ride that I take
[2:01:52] from one dimension to
[2:01:54] [Music]
[2:01:55] the cuz it ain't just power. It's
[2:01:58] healing power. Transforming power. power
[2:02:02] to change a body.
[2:02:08] What we need is to be encouraged.
[2:02:11] I don't know about y'all, but I need
[2:02:12] some encouragement.
[2:02:16] [Applause]
[2:02:19] We never was promised to be immune from
[2:02:21] these things,
[2:02:24] but when they come, we get discouraged
[2:02:25] by them and think, man, something must
[2:02:28] be wrong. Well, something might be
[2:02:30] right.
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:35] What you focusing on?
[2:02:38] [Applause]
[2:02:40] Brother Josh shared Revelation one time
[2:02:42] preaching on that preaching on that
[2:02:45] theophony. You know, Jesus went to hell
[2:02:47] and preached. Brother Bam said he was
[2:02:49] preaching in the same kind of body he
[2:02:50] met Melazedc
[2:02:52] in. He shared a revelation on it. He
[2:02:54] said, he said the disciples are up there
[2:02:56] walking around whining. Peter done them
[2:02:58] went and got naked, went fishing. He
[2:03:00] said, "Cuz they don't think nothing's
[2:03:01] happening.
[2:03:03] And Jesus is down there whipping all of
[2:03:05] hell, taking the keys of death, hell,
[2:03:08] and the grave. And you don't think
[2:03:10] nothing's happening. But in the unseen
[2:03:12] realm, that same supernatural being that
[2:03:16] was with Melazdc, Amen, is right here in
[2:03:19] this building tonight. Elohim,
[2:03:22] Mechazedc, Jesus Christ, is here and
[2:03:26] he's alive.
[2:03:28] And I don't know if you can see what's
[2:03:29] happening, but there's things happening
[2:03:32] in this building right now, whether you
[2:03:34] can see them or not. Amen. They're
[2:03:36] taking place. Healings are manifesting.
[2:03:39] People are getting courage when they
[2:03:41] have been discouraged. Life is coming to
[2:03:43] dark places.
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:52] So, Brother Wayne, what about the
[2:03:53] mountain? Let me tell you that. If the
[2:03:54] mountain's too high to go over and the
[2:03:57] sea's too deep to go under and it's too
[2:04:00] wide to go around, he'll give you grace
[2:04:02] to get through it.
[2:04:05] Don't worry about it. Keep your eyes on
[2:04:08] Christ. He can take us through. Come on,
[2:04:12] church. We've read too much about Moses
[2:04:14] to worry about any Red Sea.
[2:04:18] We're serving the God of power. We we've
[2:04:22] read too many stories of how the Red Sea
[2:04:25] opened. Amen. And God led them across on
[2:04:27] dry ground.
[2:04:30] Y'all know what opened that sea? It was
[2:04:33] wind. Now, if you ever if you ever
[2:04:36] question what I'm telling you, that wind
[2:04:38] opened that sea. God sent it. That wind
[2:04:41] opened it about in the middle of the of
[2:04:43] the winter whenever the big blows start
[2:04:45] up there at Lake Erie. Me and Zach put
[2:04:48] our boat in right there in Hiron and
[2:04:50] it's about 7 8 sometimes 10t of water
[2:04:53] where we put our boats in. But when a
[2:04:55] big blow comes, he's saying right there.
[2:04:57] When a big blow comes, that 6 or 8t of
[2:05:00] water will disappear over to New York.
[2:05:03] It'll pile up at Buffalo over there and
[2:05:05] our ramps will go completely dry. It'll
[2:05:08] drop that lake 6 foot because the blow
[2:05:10] blows that water. Well, listen, that's
[2:05:12] just a natural average thing that
[2:05:14] happens. But when God's children
[2:05:16] couldn't get over the sea, brother Ben
[2:05:18] said God's path led right through that
[2:05:21] sea.
[2:05:23] Come on, he led through the middle of
[2:05:25] the sea. But because of the power of
[2:05:27] God, Amen. All they had to do was follow
[2:05:29] the pillar of
[2:05:31] fire and a wind be to blow and begin to
[2:05:35] make that sea stand up.
[2:05:39] I tell you what, if you want to talk
[2:05:41] about the power of God, he made that sea
[2:05:43] stand right up and then it blowed to the
[2:05:46] to the soil was
[2:05:48] [Music]
[2:05:50] dry cuz he didn't want them to have to
[2:05:52] walk on any more
[2:05:53] [Applause]
[2:05:56] mud.
[2:05:58] Brother, you ever see the power of God
[2:06:00] displayed that way? You'd get your
[2:06:02] tambourine,
[2:06:04] [Applause]
[2:06:05] too. Come on, Sister Tannis. That's
[2:06:08] right. Sometimes people get all messed
[2:06:11] up because somebody rejoices or shouts a
[2:06:13] little. All I got to say is maybe you
[2:06:15] ain't had an experience lately with the
[2:06:18] power of God that'll make you feel like
[2:06:20] moving in the power of God. This power
[2:06:23] I'm talking about, it's got a power to
[2:06:26] give you a breakthrough. It'll break
[2:06:28] through your Red Sea. It'll break
[2:06:30] through the shell of your
[2:06:32] discouragement. It'll break through
[2:06:33] anxiety and nervousness. It's the power
[2:06:36] of
[2:06:39] God. It's
[2:06:42] power. Y'all know the story. They got on
[2:06:45] the other side of that seat and Miriam
[2:06:47] picked that up. Brother Ram said she
[2:06:49] turned around and seen.
[2:06:51] She seen them old things laying dead.
[2:06:55] She seen them dead. And to see, yeah,
[2:06:58] she felt like dancing.
[2:07:01] Yeah, she felt like rejoicing. She seen
[2:07:04] her enemy was
[2:07:07] dead. What did the prophet hear in this
[2:07:10] last day? It's only 6 in long. Your
[2:07:13] enemy is dead. Let me tell you, you
[2:07:16] might have been fighting something
[2:07:17] coming in this meeting. Why don't you
[2:07:19] hear the word? Your enemy is dead. God
[2:07:22] killed that devil, but you might find
[2:07:25] liberty in the power of
[2:07:27] [Applause]
[2:07:29] God. He's here tonight to open red seas.
[2:07:33] [Applause]
[2:07:34] I got to I got to preaching about this
[2:07:36] one time and got to thinking about how
[2:07:38] when they got on the other side, Amen.
[2:07:40] They got over there, they got to hearing
[2:07:42] noises, thought it might have been war.
[2:07:44] Somebody getting killed over there on
[2:07:46] the other side. And finally, somebody
[2:07:49] asked up the line, "Brother Sean, what's
[2:07:51] going on up there?" And passed through
[2:07:53] about 2 3,000. What's going on up there?
[2:07:57] About three or four more thousand.
[2:07:59] What's going on? What meanth these
[2:08:03] noises? And somebody on the other side
[2:08:05] turned back and begin to shout, "We got
[2:08:08] to the other
[2:08:11] side. We've had a
[2:08:16] breakthrough." About 2 or 3,000 people
[2:08:18] down the line. It's a
[2:08:22] breakthrough all the way to the back.
[2:08:24] It's a breakthrough. I think the dancing
[2:08:28] started out in the back of the line. Oh,
[2:08:30] they hadn't got out on the other side,
[2:08:33] but they knew they were following the
[2:08:34] one that can bring a breakthrough to
[2:08:37] every life. Let me tell you, he can
[2:08:39] bring a breakthrough. Amen. To brother
[2:08:41] Mark, or brother Wayne, Brother Andrew,
[2:08:44] Brother Jonathan. He can bring a
[2:08:46] breakthrough to your
[2:08:49] life. I'm serving the God of the
[2:08:52] breakthrough.
[2:08:55] Chickens break through shells. Salmon
[2:08:58] break through dams. Amen. Life breaks
[2:09:00] through the
[2:09:02] concrete. He's a God of
[2:09:08] breakthroughs. You go on and serve a
[2:09:10] dead God if you want to, but my God is
[2:09:12] alive. He rose up on the third day and
[2:09:15] sits in power tonight.
[2:09:23] [Applause]
[2:09:28] Ah, hallelujah. He's a God of
[2:09:37] power. If thou can't believe all things,
[2:09:47] power. You talk about power. Brother Bam
[2:09:50] called it omnipotent power.
[2:09:55] All power.
[2:09:58] Oh, I tell you what, Russia, they got
[2:10:01] powerful bombs.
[2:10:04] Brother man said, "I got news for you.
[2:10:07] Atomic warfare is not the most powerful
[2:10:09] weapon.
[2:10:19] It's not the most powerful weapon.
[2:10:23] The devil is not the most powerful
[2:10:25] thing.
[2:10:28] Come on church.
[2:10:33] A
[2:10:34] believer in contact with his maker.
[2:10:40] That is the most powerful
[2:10:44] thing. To you that's sitting here
[2:10:46] tonight, I am looking at the most
[2:10:49] powerful force on planet Earth.
[2:10:52] [Applause]
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:57] Oh, glory be to God.
[2:10:59] [Applause]
[2:11:01] No, Elisha, you just stay back here and
[2:11:04] settle down.
[2:11:06] We're going to teach some theology after
[2:11:07] a while.
[2:11:09] Someday
[2:11:12] you good student, you can be a dean of
[2:11:13] the college here.
[2:11:19] But could you imagine a man of God
[2:11:23] being satisfied
[2:11:26] as a dean of a college
[2:11:29] when the power of
[2:11:31] God is laying right there?
[2:11:38] Can you imagine
[2:11:40] that we could get satisfied
[2:11:42] with a little education
[2:11:46] when the power of almighty God is right
[2:11:50] here?
[2:11:54] Brother Wayne, are you saying that the
[2:11:56] church could have the power of God? I'm
[2:11:59] saying that you've been promised the
[2:12:01] power of God. Amen. And let me not just
[2:12:04] say the power of God, but when Elisha
[2:12:08] saw Elijah cross over, he asked him. He
[2:12:11] said, "What is it that you're hanging
[2:12:12] around for? What do you want?" And he
[2:12:14] told him very clearly what he wanted. He
[2:12:16] said, "I want a double portion."
[2:12:21] That's just like that greedy bride.
[2:12:26] You say, "Preacher, Amen. Why do you
[2:12:28] always ask for a double of stuff?"
[2:12:30] because I've been
[2:12:33] promised. That if you would ask
[2:12:35] abundantly, your joy could be made
[2:12:40] full. You have not because you ask not.
[2:12:43] But if you could ask,
[2:12:46] Lord, I want a double portion. Amen.
[2:12:48] Somebody said, "Well, you mean a double
[2:12:49] portion of what Brother Brandham had?"
[2:12:51] Brother Brandham said, "A double portion
[2:12:52] of what Jesus had."
[2:12:56] He said, "If we ever needed a double
[2:12:58] portion, we need it now.
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:01] But see Elisha's whole heart and motive
[2:13:04] became that power. His whole heart and
[2:13:07] motive, brother Bam said he become
[2:13:08] single and
[2:13:10] I he said so he wouldn't be satisfied
[2:13:13] with something else somebody gave him.
[2:13:15] He wanted Elijah's robe. And brother Bam
[2:13:17] said that's the same as it is with the
[2:13:18] church. We don't want no moth eating
[2:13:21] denominational robe.
[2:13:24] He said put the robe of the church on.
[2:13:25] He said it don't do nothing but bind
[2:13:27] you.
[2:13:28] They used to teach the power of God, but
[2:13:30] they don't no more. So if you put the
[2:13:33] robe on, you can't preach but what they
[2:13:35] preach.
[2:13:37] You can't say but what they say.
[2:13:41] There's anything I hate is that old
[2:13:43] nickelan spirit trying to put
[2:13:46] pressure over the bride of Christ that
[2:13:49] she don't have a right to every promise
[2:13:52] that God made her in this age. Listen, I
[2:13:55] don't want to be rude, but I don't need
[2:13:57] somebody's permission. I do not need a
[2:14:00] bishop to give me permission to receive
[2:14:02] God and every promise he's got. Somebody
[2:14:05] said, "Well, they're going to cut you
[2:14:06] off." I got my own
[2:14:09] tapes. I got my own
[2:14:13] Bible. I've been given the source of
[2:14:16] eternal life.
[2:14:19] Cut me off if you want to, but I'll
[2:14:21] shout on the back side of the desert in
[2:14:24] the presence of the pillar of
[2:14:27] fire. It don't matter, brother Andrew.
[2:14:30] Amen. I want God at any cost. Give me
[2:14:34] the power of God at the cost of
[2:14:36] somebody. He's a fanatic. He's this. I
[2:14:38] don't care. Call me any dirty name you
[2:14:40] want to.
[2:14:43] Give me the power of God.
[2:14:48] Trouble of it today is we yoke ourselves
[2:14:50] up with a bunch of denomination.
[2:14:57] But the power of God, Amen, is not
[2:15:00] yolked up to nobody but God.
[2:15:06] Well, you know, I'll go get under so and
[2:15:07] so's ministry and that's where I'll get
[2:15:09] the power of God.
[2:15:13] I'll just preach this way a while. I'll
[2:15:15] go and get under this guy and that's
[2:15:17] where the power of God will be. I'll go
[2:15:19] down here in the desert. That's where
[2:15:22] it's going to be. I I I'll go over here
[2:15:24] and they'll run from the east and the
[2:15:26] west and be tied and tossed by every
[2:15:30] wind of doctrine. But you won't find the
[2:15:32] power of God yolked up with nobody but
[2:15:35] God.
[2:15:39] You want to get power, get in the
[2:15:41] presence of almighty God and let him
[2:15:44] burn the sin and unbelief out of your
[2:15:46] life until that great lick of fire
[2:15:49] begins to blow up on the
[2:15:54] inside. Oh, I know it's too hard and
[2:15:58] there's too much discouragement. Y'all
[2:16:00] just stay here.
[2:16:04] Amen. Elisha couldn't think that way. He
[2:16:06] had already felt the power of God.
[2:16:11] Now, I'm not reading out of an almanac,
[2:16:13] folks.
[2:16:16] If you're craving to see the power of
[2:16:17] God, there's a power of God somewhere.
[2:16:21] As long as a human hungers and searches
[2:16:24] and calling for the power of God,
[2:16:25] there's got to be a power somewhere to
[2:16:27] respond to that.
[2:16:29] If you're if you're thirsting and
[2:16:32] desiring the power of God, I got a cure.
[2:16:36] [Applause]
[2:16:36] [Music]
[2:16:38] Just like a hungry man, they got a cure
[2:16:40] after church. They'll cure your hunger.
[2:16:42] They'll feed you up good. But if you're
[2:16:45] looking for the power of God,
[2:16:47] denominational porridge ain't going to
[2:16:49] fix it.
[2:16:51] It ain't going to cure it. But the cure
[2:16:54] would be a double portion of Almighty
[2:16:56] God. Can I say something just real flat?
[2:16:59] God hates a powerless
[2:17:02] [Applause]
[2:17:05] religion. God hates a powerless
[2:17:09] religion. God hates a powerless
[2:17:11] religion. You see, but the power of God
[2:17:14] that has been released to the church, it
[2:17:17] is a power and it has a loosening power
[2:17:20] in it.
[2:17:22] Yes, it has a power that can loosen the
[2:17:26] church.
[2:17:27] Now, when I say to you that you have
[2:17:30] power, let it be known, I mean power by
[2:17:33] authority.
[2:17:37] It means power by authority.
[2:17:40] Is that right? Amen. I I've learned
[2:17:43] something lately. Amen. I don't know. I
[2:17:45] I know you've all studied pardons, but I
[2:17:46] I got pretty interested in pardon power
[2:17:48] here a while back because of the
[2:17:50] elections and all that was going on with
[2:17:51] all these pardonins. I got interested in
[2:17:53] all that and I thought, where did the
[2:17:55] idea even come from? Of course, we know
[2:17:57] it was biblical, but we found out that
[2:17:59] it came out of England years ago. And
[2:18:02] kings actually believe they were kings
[2:18:04] by divine right, they call it. And in
[2:18:06] that divine right, they believe that a
[2:18:09] king had the act of a sovereign grace or
[2:18:11] they could impart a sovereign act of
[2:18:14] mercy. So if they deemed someone had
[2:18:16] been wrongly judged or caught up into
[2:18:18] something, they reserved a power that
[2:18:21] could just pardon the individual and let
[2:18:23] them go. Well, that pardon was carried
[2:18:25] over to the United States of America
[2:18:27] when George Woren started using it. Now
[2:18:29] y'all know George. Amen. When the first
[2:18:31] rebellion come up in America, Amen. He
[2:18:34] figured out a way to solve a rebellion.
[2:18:36] Cuz see, when two sides get to fighting,
[2:18:39] if you can't pardon one side or the
[2:18:42] other, then you'll never be on the same
[2:18:44] side again.
[2:18:48] Right? Now, now, now think about this
[2:18:51] because the way to stop rebellion is
[2:18:55] make everybody on the same side.
[2:18:57] [Applause]
[2:18:59] Now, you was on a different side than
[2:19:01] God. And Adam put you on the wrong side
[2:19:04] and we was on this side. But Jesus
[2:19:07] Christ,
[2:19:10] y'all know he did it by the power of the
[2:19:11] blood. Brother man said he didn't just
[2:19:14] make a a bridge between us and God. He
[2:19:17] said he removed the gap
[2:19:21] that we're on the same side.
[2:19:24] So a pardon power puts you back in the
[2:19:27] same place you was before the rebellion
[2:19:30] happened in heaven.
[2:19:35] Now now that pardon was used again with
[2:19:38] Abraham Lincoln in the civil war.
[2:19:41] Now, what he did in the Civil War, it's
[2:19:43] pretty pretty amazing to study, is
[2:19:45] Abraham Lincoln made a actually what
[2:19:47] they call a blanket pardon and said
[2:19:50] anybody that would come back to the
[2:19:52] State of the Union and pledge allegiance
[2:19:53] to it and drop their arms could be
[2:19:55] pardoned from the crime of the Civil
[2:19:58] War. So, that's a way to heal America
[2:20:02] was that the pardon would be given.
[2:20:04] That's actually the Liberty Bell took a
[2:20:05] took a took a a a tour across America at
[2:20:09] that same time and they they struck the
[2:20:11] Liberty Bell. Amen. Because everybody
[2:20:12] could be free from their confusions and
[2:20:14] their divisions. And
[2:20:18] my I'd like to ring a Liberty Bell in
[2:20:20] the
[2:20:21] [Applause]
[2:20:26] message. I'd like to preach a message.
[2:20:28] We're on the same side.
[2:20:38] We're on the same side.
[2:20:42] So, I got interested. You know, I found
[2:20:45] out, you know, brother Bram said it
[2:20:46] talks about a pardon's only a pardon if
[2:20:48] received as a pardon. If you get into
[2:20:50] history, do you Abraham Lincoln made a
[2:20:53] bunch of pardons and they actually are
[2:20:55] floating all over the internet. You can
[2:20:56] get little Google pictures of them where
[2:20:58] he just wrote it on a little maybe a
[2:21:00] little napkin or some little postcard or
[2:21:02] he wrote it all over kinds of all kinds
[2:21:04] of papers and everything and it really
[2:21:06] didn't matter the paper was on it. And
[2:21:09] people would hold those pardon papers
[2:21:11] and carry them around with them. If
[2:21:12] somebody challenged them, they could
[2:21:14] just show them the pardon paper.
[2:21:16] That's why that when brother Bam talks
[2:21:18] about the man didn't want to believe
[2:21:20] that it was Abraham Lincoln signature on
[2:21:23] the paper is because the paper didn't
[2:21:25] reflect that it was a king's message
[2:21:29] but it held the same authority
[2:21:32] and the messenger that was running did
[2:21:35] not have any real power
[2:21:39] but he was holding power
[2:21:42] and he was given access to power and was
[2:21:45] liberating ating someone with with this
[2:21:47] was this. Now, I can't find the exact
[2:21:50] Lincoln one, but I found a different one
[2:21:52] that is uh that actually is in Supreme
[2:21:54] Court law right now. You go look up the
[2:21:56] law, but it actually says that before a
[2:21:59] pardon can be a pardon, a pardon must be
[2:22:01] delivered.
[2:22:04] The law states a pardon must be
[2:22:06] delivered. And the same law states that
[2:22:10] a delivery is not complete until
[2:22:12] acceptance.
[2:22:15] So you can take it and you can preach
[2:22:17] it, but it's not complete until it's
[2:22:22] accepted.
[2:22:25] And then it becomes pardon power or
[2:22:28] loosening power. Now, we found out that
[2:22:31] that was used again with Nixon and Ford.
[2:22:33] Remember when Nixon resigned? Amen. Ford
[2:22:35] actually pardoned Nixon, ruined his
[2:22:36] political career by doing so. Nobody
[2:22:39] wanted him to be president after that
[2:22:40] cuz they was all mad at Nixon, you know.
[2:22:42] But he ruined his political career by
[2:22:43] his pardon. But but what's amazing is
[2:22:46] what's amazing is is that that that that
[2:22:50] Biden brought this back
[2:22:52] up when he pardons all of these people
[2:22:55] at one time and he had pardoned y'all.
[2:22:58] Y'all I know some of you probably mad
[2:23:00] about it, but but he pardoned a bunch of
[2:23:02] them criminals that was with him.
[2:23:09] You can't argue if they're politicians.
[2:23:12] They're all criminals.
[2:23:16] They're just criminals. There's some
[2:23:18] caught and some not.
[2:23:21] But they're all the same.
[2:23:24] But he did something that I thought was
[2:23:26] amazing. He gave a preemptive pardon.
[2:23:31] In other words, he pardoned them before
[2:23:34] they ever even went to trial.
[2:23:37] Come on. In other words, he dismissed
[2:23:39] the case before it was ever brought up.
[2:23:43] And I thought, dear Lord, if President
[2:23:47] Biden can preemptively pardon his
[2:23:51] family, no wonder that the blood of
[2:23:54] Jesus all the way from Calvary, he could
[2:23:58] cry, "Father, it is finished." Because
[2:24:02] power and power reached you and I. Amen.
[2:24:06] Before we was even born, we were already
[2:24:09] under a pardon from Almighty God.
[2:24:14] [Applause]
[2:24:17] So when Trump comes in office, he just
[2:24:19] pardons everybody that was in that in
[2:24:21] and I mean 1,600 of them got pardoned
[2:24:23] all at one time. It's pretty crazy. But
[2:24:26] one the one that really got me was when
[2:24:28] pardon you remember when Trump was the
[2:24:30] president of the first goround there was
[2:24:32] a black lady down in Memphis Tennessee
[2:24:34] that was serving a life sentence for
[2:24:36] some kind of a drug charge and most
[2:24:38] everybody else gets out in a year if
[2:24:39] they didn't go to jail but this poor
[2:24:40] lady and somebody interceded on her
[2:24:43] behalf and he he gave her a clemency and
[2:24:45] let her out of jail early in his first
[2:24:47] term but in his second term when he come
[2:24:50] back he said now he got that woman back
[2:24:52] up into the president's office and he
[2:24:55] said I'll tell you what I'm going do.
[2:24:56] I'm not just going to cut your term
[2:24:58] short. He said, I'm just going to pardon
[2:25:00] you all
[2:25:03] together. And then he says to her,
[2:25:06] because you understand your people and
[2:25:08] all the people that's been uh in trouble
[2:25:10] with drugs and things, I'm going to ding
[2:25:14] you the first pardon Zar of the
[2:25:17] presidential executive branch. and he
[2:25:19] gave a woman that had been in prison for
[2:25:23] drugs a complete pardon and then gave
[2:25:26] her pardon power. So she's around now
[2:25:30] going around places offering pardons to
[2:25:33] people who are still in jail. I said,
[2:25:35] "Glory to
[2:25:36] [Applause]
[2:25:37] God. God took me out of jail, gave me
[2:25:41] the Holy Ghost, but then he put a pardon
[2:25:44] over my life. You never done it in the
[2:25:47] first place." And then he gave me this
[2:25:49] holy Bible and said, "You go around and
[2:25:53] you pardon my people. I'm going to make
[2:25:55] a pardon zar out of you." I tell you
[2:25:58] tonight, this bride is holding pardon
[2:26:02] power. You got a right tonight to preach
[2:26:05] this message of truth to this world. And
[2:26:08] if you can believe it, you're
[2:26:11] free. If you can believe it, you're free
[2:26:13] tonight. And the pardon of God is upon
[2:26:15] your life. Listen, I don't I don't know
[2:26:18] about you all, but I thank God tonight
[2:26:20] that he took this power and set this
[2:26:22] liberty of this church and gave us a
[2:26:25] promise that we would be able to loose.
[2:26:28] Amen. That God would be able to bring
[2:26:30] the God of miracles alive in the church
[2:26:33] under the power of promise in this age.
[2:26:37] Now, I know that some people say, "Well,
[2:26:39] Brother Wayne, there are things going
[2:26:41] into my life that you can't get me out
[2:26:44] of. There are situations that the power
[2:26:48] there's nothing that's left that could
[2:26:50] break the problem or that could destroy
[2:26:52] the issues that's upon my life. But let
[2:26:54] me say to you tonight, amen, there is a
[2:26:57] power tonight that has been released
[2:27:00] under this message that can expose the
[2:27:03] source of the trouble you're in.
[2:27:08] This message doesn't just deal with the
[2:27:11] problem. It deals with what's behind the
[2:27:16] problem. Yes, sir. As a man brought his
[2:27:19] wife to a to a meeting of brother
[2:27:21] Brandhams and she was human demonp
[2:27:23] possessed. Brother said, "Poor woman had
[2:27:25] lost her mind. She hadn't spoken
[2:27:27] months." Brother Brandham said, "She
[2:27:28] come in there and he said, I reached
[2:27:30] down there to pray for her and he said,
[2:27:32] man, that woman was 10 times stronger
[2:27:35] than a normal man." He said, I said, "Oh
[2:27:38] my goodness, what am I dealing with?" He
[2:27:39] said, "I ran back up on the steps and
[2:27:41] stood beside the man." He said, "I told
[2:27:43] you, Brother Bam, you don't want to you
[2:27:44] don't want to you don't want to hold her
[2:27:46] hand. You don't want to get near her.
[2:27:47] She'll hurt you." And Brother Brandham
[2:27:49] said, "I got up on the steps, said that
[2:27:50] woman come crawling across the the the
[2:27:52] floor on her back chasing me." He said,
[2:27:55] he rolled over and said, "William
[2:27:57] Brandom, what have I got to do with
[2:27:59] you?"
[2:28:02] And the man looked at Brother Bam said,
[2:28:04] "Brother Bham, she ain't spoke no words
[2:28:06] in a long time. said, "She don't know
[2:28:08] who you are, let alone who she is or
[2:28:10] nothing else." Brother Brandham said,
[2:28:12] "That's the devil talking out of her."
[2:28:14] The man said, "Brother Brandon, we've
[2:28:16] sold everything we had to get her in
[2:28:18] this meeting tonight." Said, "We can't
[2:28:20] just turn around and go home." He said,
[2:28:22] "She's kicked all the windows out of the
[2:28:24] car. We don't We've sold them." I think
[2:28:26] he said he sold his mules and and got
[2:28:28] everything he could just to get her to
[2:28:30] the meeting. And brother Bam said, "I
[2:28:31] turned and looked at the man." He said,
[2:28:33] "Have you heard my story about the
[2:28:35] angel?" Come on. Man said, "Yes, Brother
[2:28:38] Brandham. We've heard." He said, "Do you
[2:28:40] believe
[2:28:41] it?" He said, "Yes, Brother Brandham. I
[2:28:44] believe it." Brother Brandham said,
[2:28:45] "Then thus saith the Lord."
[2:28:48] Oh, church of the living God. That thus
[2:28:52] saith the Lord brought a deliverance to
[2:28:54] that life. There was no intellectual
[2:28:57] powers. There was no psychology powers.
[2:29:00] There was no drug powers. But the power
[2:29:03] of God brought to us by the message was
[2:29:06] a deliverance for that woman's life.
[2:29:10] A power that can break every spell over
[2:29:14] lives. A power, let me just say very
[2:29:18] clearly that can break the hold that
[2:29:20] Satan has over your home, that has over
[2:29:23] your family, the spell Satan has cast
[2:29:27] against your against your humanity,
[2:29:29] against the healing in your body. Many
[2:29:32] people sitting here tonight either are
[2:29:34] under some kind of pressure or they have
[2:29:37] family that is in some kind of great
[2:29:39] amen issues and trials going on
[2:29:42] everywhere. But there still remains a
[2:29:44] power
[2:29:45] tonight. A power that can break the
[2:29:48] curse of this enemy that hasn't come
[2:29:50] upon the church. Oh, I love how Brother
[2:29:52] Bam said it. He said, "I was sitting
[2:29:55] there one day." He said, "I had that
[2:29:56] dream, remember?" And he said, "I seen a
[2:29:59] bunch of good people and they were in a
[2:30:00] cage." And he said, "Those bars were
[2:30:04] holding them in. Man-made bars were
[2:30:07] holding the people in." You know what
[2:30:08] brother Brandham said? The woman told
[2:30:09] Brother Brandham said, "They're good
[2:30:10] people." Brother Brandham, he said,
[2:30:12] "They have just misunderstood you."
[2:30:17] Oh, how many times has misunderstandings
[2:30:21] built cages?
[2:30:24] Come on,
[2:30:25] church. How many times has
[2:30:28] misunderstandings put problems in homes
[2:30:31] and families? and the devil standing
[2:30:33] back laughing because a young believer
[2:30:36] or a young family seemed so encased by
[2:30:39] the situation. But I love how brother
[2:30:41] Brandham stood back. He said, "And I
[2:30:43] looked and he said, the Lord," Amen.
[2:30:45] said, "Free him." And he looked back and
[2:30:47] he said, "I I I didn't have the muscles
[2:30:49] to do it. I was just a little fella." He
[2:30:51] said, "But I heard the sweetest
[2:30:53] voice. Free him. Turn them loose." And
[2:30:57] brother Bram said, I reached back and
[2:30:59] said, "Oh, house of hell. Yeah. Give way
[2:31:04] in the name of Jesus Christ. He said,
[2:31:07] "And the bars begin to break and the
[2:31:09] people begin to run, I'm free. I'm
[2:31:12] free." And I'll tell you something
[2:31:14] tonight. Amen. If we could hear the
[2:31:17] power of this message coming right to
[2:31:19] our house and address, we could realize
[2:31:22] tonight there's not one person would
[2:31:24] have to leave this building tonight
[2:31:26] bound. Not one young person would have
[2:31:28] to leave bound in pornography. Not one
[2:31:31] young person would have to be under the
[2:31:33] power of lust. Not one young person
[2:31:36] would have to be here tonight under the
[2:31:38] the power of alcohol or drugs. Not one
[2:31:42] believer would have to suffer with
[2:31:44] neurotics and anxiety and depression.
[2:31:48] Oh, house of hell. The power is in the
[2:31:52] name of Jesus Christ. I'll tell you
[2:31:55] tonight, if you begin to say that name
[2:31:57] over the situations of your life, there
[2:31:59] is power in
[2:32:02] it. Come on. Come on.
[2:32:06] There's power in the name.
[2:32:09] Listen, I I I know you know these
[2:32:12] things, but when David met his Goliath,
[2:32:15] what did he do? He said, "Now you come
[2:32:17] to me.
[2:32:20] You come to me with just stabs and
[2:32:23] swords,
[2:32:25] but I'm coming in the name of the Lord
[2:32:28] God.
[2:32:29] Think about this. In the name of the
[2:32:31] Lord.
[2:32:33] Brother Ram. Josh. Brother Ram said that
[2:32:35] was the rod that was in Moses's hand.
[2:32:40] That was what was David's secret was the
[2:32:43] name of the Lord. He said in the name of
[2:32:45] Jesus is the secret of this bride
[2:32:47] church.
[2:32:49] If the devil could ever get that name
[2:32:52] out of your hands,
[2:32:56] Brother Bam said it would be like taking
[2:32:58] the rod out of the hand of Moses. You
[2:33:01] see that name is where the access of
[2:33:03] power lays. That name now, now can we
[2:33:06] take a moment? Is is everybody okay?
[2:33:08] That that power is in that name. Now you
[2:33:12] you I'm just going to preach tonight and
[2:33:14] I hate that I got to leave. But I I just
[2:33:16] want to I want to say something. That's
[2:33:18] what the devil's always been after is
[2:33:20] the name.
[2:33:24] The fullness of that name.
[2:33:27] Did if you if you uh if you're a Bible
[2:33:29] student history lesson, I I I'm I'm not
[2:33:32] going to stay here a long time, but I I
[2:33:35] had a little travel in history, Bible
[2:33:37] history, and and and looked at some
[2:33:40] things that are pretty amazing. Do y'all
[2:33:42] know that the early Christians were
[2:33:44] actually crucif crucified and they were
[2:33:47] they were beaten and they were
[2:33:49] persecuted by the pagans?
[2:33:53] Who who was beating them up early? was
[2:33:56] the pagans.
[2:33:58] And you know, all the way up to 300
[2:34:00] years after Christ, they were they were
[2:34:02] persecuted and hung and beat and
[2:34:04] destroyed. But in but in 303, now this
[2:34:07] is real crucial to our churches. In 303,
[2:34:11] they passed a law outlawing Christianity
[2:34:14] in the Roman Empire. And for 10 years,
[2:34:18] it was the bloodiest persecution the
[2:34:20] church had ever faced until
[2:34:23] Constantine of 313
[2:34:26] when he passed a law, the edict of
[2:34:28] Milan. And actually when he passes this
[2:34:31] law, he actually makes it legal to be a
[2:34:35] Christian.
[2:34:37] But there was so many arguments among
[2:34:40] the Christian people of what true
[2:34:42] Christianity was because there was
[2:34:45] idolattors
[2:34:47] and they had come into the church what
[2:34:49] they called nicicoatans.
[2:34:53] Now this is really a powerful point.
[2:34:56] Do you know about those nickelans?
[2:34:58] Brother Brandham said what they were. He
[2:35:01] said they conquered the leoty.
[2:35:04] Come on. He said there was a time when
[2:35:07] the church of the living God, if he had
[2:35:09] operated under the power of God and it
[2:35:12] met in little store rooms and houses and
[2:35:15] wherever they could get together and
[2:35:17] they would get together and the power of
[2:35:18] God would fall and brother said people
[2:35:20] started getting the Holy Ghost and they
[2:35:22] started going home and their masters
[2:35:24] started seeing the outpouring and the he
[2:35:26] said then the higher ups got to saying
[2:35:29] they'd like to go to them meetings and
[2:35:30] they'd like to see the power of God. He
[2:35:32] said, "And when they got to doing it,"
[2:35:34] he said, "All of a sudden, they begin to
[2:35:36] want to change the way it was done."
[2:35:40] That's right. He said, "And anybody that
[2:35:43] didn't come under that change was
[2:35:45] labeled a heretic."
[2:35:49] So all of a sudden, they wanted to take
[2:35:52] over and begin to dictate to the church
[2:35:55] what kind of worship you could perform
[2:35:58] in the church of God.
[2:36:01] So they became the nicicoatans and you
[2:36:03] all know about them. But in but in 313
[2:36:07] Nick Constantine said y'all can all be
[2:36:09] Christians and everybody was arguing. So
[2:36:12] he comes together in 3:25 and he says
[2:36:15] let's do this. Let's make a let's make a
[2:36:17] union. Let's make an ecumenical. Let's
[2:36:21] discuss this and get something everybody
[2:36:23] can agree on and then we'll call that
[2:36:25] the church.
[2:36:27] The problem is
[2:36:29] is the only people that gave up
[2:36:31] anything was the Christians
[2:36:35] because the pagans kept their idols.
[2:36:38] They kept their names. They kept
[2:36:41] everything else and they just titled it
[2:36:44] Christian Catholics.
[2:36:46] And took away the deity of the name of
[2:36:49] Jesus Christ. I got the paperwork right
[2:36:51] here of the very words they wrote and
[2:36:53] they they called it the Nian council
[2:36:55] where they made a trinitarian God of
[2:36:58] father, son and holy ghost in equal
[2:37:00] majesty
[2:37:03] and called it Catholic Christianity and
[2:37:06] in AD 3:25 it was passed and they
[2:37:09] elected a pope who become over the
[2:37:11] bishop of the Roman Catholic Church but
[2:37:13] by the time of AD 380 just 60 years
[2:37:17] later they passed a law called the edict
[2:37:19] of Thessalonica. Amen. And made it
[2:37:22] outlawed any religion but the Catholic
[2:37:25] religion.
[2:37:27] So from 8030 380 all the way to
[2:37:31] 80500 68 million Christians were killed.
[2:37:35] You said preacher what's the what's the
[2:37:37] point behind this? Because what they did
[2:37:39] is they separated it between the formal
[2:37:42] and the heretic.
[2:37:44] Anybody that didn't worship in the
[2:37:46] formal way was considered heretic. And
[2:37:49] they were liable. Amen. That they could
[2:37:51] be killed. They could be punished. They
[2:37:54] could be talked about. They could be
[2:37:56] beat. They could be ridiculed because
[2:37:58] they were labeled a bunch of holy
[2:38:00] rollers.
[2:38:02] And the devil has always labeled God's
[2:38:05] church holy roller. Amen. Spiritual
[2:38:09] people. But they were spiritled. And
[2:38:12] they wouldn't give up the power of God
[2:38:14] or the power of the church. They
[2:38:16] wouldn't give up the power of God. And
[2:38:18] they would stand there with the power of
[2:38:21] God. And they were beaten and burned and
[2:38:23] fed to lions, but they could not be
[2:38:26] discouraged.
[2:38:30] Oh, church of the living God. What did
[2:38:32] that devil want to do? Wanted to dictate
[2:38:34] the worship.
[2:38:36] And that's the same thing that devil
[2:38:38] wants to do tonight is dictate how we
[2:38:41] worship God.
[2:38:44] There was a lady in brother Bram's
[2:38:45] meetings. Amen. She come, Brother Bam.
[2:38:47] She said, "Brother Brandham, I was in
[2:38:49] your meeting the other night." He said,
[2:38:50] "It got to feeling so good." And she
[2:38:52] said, "I tell you what, those people got
[2:38:54] to shouting and hollering amen while you
[2:38:56] was preaching." She said, "I wanted to
[2:38:58] jump right up and just shout amen right
[2:39:01] in the middle of them." And brother
[2:39:03] Brandham said, "Well, why didn't you?"
[2:39:05] And she said, "Well, Brother Brandham,"
[2:39:07] she said, "I'll tell you this." She
[2:39:09] said, "I almost did, but just as I got
[2:39:12] ready to jump up, the devil told me I
[2:39:14] wasn't worthy. He told me that I had no
[2:39:18] rights to worship God like that. Brother
[2:39:21] Brandham said that's exactly when you
[2:39:23] ought to have got up and done
[2:39:26] it. Don't you let a devil dictate when
[2:39:30] you're going to worship God. He'll beat
[2:39:33] you up. He'll call you bad names. He'll
[2:39:36] say every dirty thing about you. But I
[2:39:38] don't care what the devil don't like.
[2:39:41] I'm going to worship God. I'm going to
[2:39:44] praise God in the power of his
[2:39:48] resurrection. The way that you call
[2:39:51] heresy is the way that I worship the
[2:39:54] Lord God of
[2:39:56] Abraham. You say, "Preacher, what's got
[2:39:58] a hold of you? You can't cheap. You
[2:40:00] can't cheapen my worship. You can't
[2:40:03] cheapen it down to the place where I'm
[2:40:05] not going to worship." Oh, y'all just
[2:40:06] got cheap worship around here.
[2:40:09] That's what the devil says. You know why
[2:40:12] he says that? To keep you from
[2:40:14] worshiping.
[2:40:15] [Music]
[2:40:17] Listen, I I I'm not a crazy man. The
[2:40:19] devil wants to cheapen worship. Look
[2:40:21] what he said. Look what he said to
[2:40:22] Job's. You remember when God and the
[2:40:24] devil were talking about Job? You
[2:40:26] remember what he said? He said he only
[2:40:28] worships you because you got a hedge
[2:40:30] built around him.
[2:40:32] Look what he done. He cheapened Job's
[2:40:34] worship to just good times.
[2:40:38] God, if you gave that man some hard
[2:40:40] days, he wouldn't worship you like that.
[2:40:44] God, if you took the protection away
[2:40:46] from him and he had to be sick a few
[2:40:48] days, if trouble come to his church a
[2:40:51] few days, if trouble comes to the family
[2:40:53] a few days, he just wouldn't worship you
[2:40:56] no more. Well, let me tell you this,
[2:40:58] devil. We don't have cheap worship
[2:41:01] around
[2:41:02] here. And the Bible says God said, "Go
[2:41:05] ahead, devil.
[2:41:08] Just don't take his life. You'll know
[2:41:11] what happened. We remember when
[2:41:12] everything was taken from Job, messenger
[2:41:15] after messenger run in and gave him bad
[2:41:17] news. You shouldn't worship God cuz your
[2:41:20] children just died. You shouldn't
[2:41:22] worship God cuz you lost your house. You
[2:41:24] lost your car. You lost your animals.
[2:41:26] You lost your farm. Job, you've lost
[2:41:28] everything. And that man of God and
[2:41:30] hearing it, he lifted his head. He said,
[2:41:32] "The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh away.
[2:41:35] Blessed be the name of the Lord. And he
[2:41:39] fell down and began to worship God.
[2:41:43] Listen, I want every devil out of hell
[2:41:45] to know we will worship
[2:41:51] God. By the way, you've lost your mind.
[2:41:54] No sir, brother. We will worship the God
[2:41:57] of
[2:41:59] [Applause]
[2:42:01] Abraham. People think that they can put
[2:42:03] it out. You know, if you talk bad enough
[2:42:05] about it long enough, if you make it
[2:42:07] sound bad enough and and you make a
[2:42:09] ridicule enough of it that everybody
[2:42:12] will stop, right?
[2:42:14] That's what they did with Jesus. All the
[2:42:17] Pharisees around said, "Don't you have
[2:42:18] nothing to do with him. Don't you have
[2:42:20] nothing to do with him." Amen. And they
[2:42:22] had that to Jesus come to the meeting
[2:42:24] and didn't even get didn't even get his
[2:42:26] feet washed.
[2:42:29] But brother Bam said one little woman.
[2:42:33] She ruined the whole plan cuz brother
[2:42:36] she broke out. Come into that room,
[2:42:39] brother Wendle, and she had that oil in
[2:42:41] her hand. She broke the lid off and
[2:42:44] poured it on the feet of
[2:42:46] Jesus. Little things in the Bible mean a
[2:42:49] lot.
[2:42:51] She broke off the brother Gabe. She
[2:42:52] broke it off. You know what that means?
[2:42:55] It means she was going to pour it all
[2:42:57] out. She wasn't going to put the lid on
[2:43:00] it for tomorrow night. But she broke it
[2:43:02] off because she was going to pour out
[2:43:05] everything that she had at the feet of
[2:43:08] Jesus. Let me tell you, I worship my
[2:43:11] God. Amen. The way they call heresy and
[2:43:14] shouting and praising and tongue talking
[2:43:17] and dancing and enjoying the things of
[2:43:20] God. We will worship him in spirit and
[2:43:23] in truth.
[2:43:27] I'm not worshiping because I have power
[2:43:29] over the devils. I'm worshiping because
[2:43:32] my name
[2:43:35] has been put in the lamb's book of life
[2:43:37] from the foundations of the
[2:43:41] world. Come on, church. Y'all know we're
[2:43:44] in the time of the opening of the
[2:43:46] book. It's a different age than any
[2:43:49] other age that's ever come.
[2:43:51] You're living in the age when the book
[2:43:53] has become open. Now, there's been a lot
[2:43:55] of ages and there's been a lot of people
[2:43:57] in that book, but not everybody knew
[2:43:59] their names was there.
[2:44:01] But in our age, brother Sean, in our
[2:44:04] age, a mighty angel descended out of
[2:44:07] heaven with an open book in his hand.
[2:44:10] Amen. The Bible tells us when that book
[2:44:12] was opened up that John, a type of this
[2:44:15] bride, got so excited and he began to
[2:44:19] worship, he worshiped until everything
[2:44:23] in heaven.
[2:44:25] And everything in the earth heard I John
[2:44:29] say,
[2:44:32] I tell you what, I don't even think we
[2:44:34] got started worshiping God yet. I think
[2:44:36] we ought to worship till everything in
[2:44:38] the heavens hear us, until everything in
[2:44:41] the hell hears us, until everything in
[2:44:43] the earth hears
[2:44:46] us. Don't let a devil dictate your
[2:44:49] worship. We're the sons and the
[2:44:52] daughters of God. We've got a right to
[2:44:55] dance. We've got a right to shout and
[2:44:58] worship and praise God.
[2:45:04] Hey, we got a right to this. We don't
[2:45:07] just want it. It belongs to us.
[2:45:12] [Applause]
[2:45:17] Power. Let our musicians come. Power to
[2:45:20] worship.
[2:45:23] The power of God to worship God.
[2:45:28] You don't think it don't take power to
[2:45:29] worship him? Amen.
[2:45:32] You can't even call him the Christ
[2:45:35] without the Holy Ghost.
[2:45:39] Come on, church.
[2:45:42] You ain't never worshiped God until you
[2:45:44] got in the spirit of God.
[2:45:47] Hallelujah.
[2:45:49] I got a ton of it here, so I ain't going
[2:45:52] to preach it all.
[2:45:55] There's a power that comes into the
[2:45:58] believer
[2:46:00] that releases them to worship God.
[2:46:03] Listen, there's there's a there's a
[2:46:05] gazillion hindrances.
[2:46:08] There's a million reasons you shouldn't
[2:46:10] tonight.
[2:46:14] You ain't worthy, right?
[2:46:17] You ain't worthy, right?
[2:46:20] We're not worshiping you. That's right.
[2:46:23] Amen. We are not worshiping your
[2:46:25] worthiness.
[2:46:29] He is worthy.
[2:46:35] He is worthy of all of our praise.
[2:46:40] You can't shout too
[2:46:42] loud. You can't cry too loud. Come on,
[2:46:48] church. It's a power.
[2:46:52] Satan wanted to get that power out of
[2:46:54] the name of the church. He He wanted to
[2:46:56] get the name of Jesus away so that you
[2:46:58] couldn't access that power through that
[2:47:00] name.
[2:47:04] Sitting in here tonight, Brother Diego,
[2:47:07] God bless his heart, back there
[2:47:11] translating him and Brother Ronnie been
[2:47:13] doing a lot of mission work down in
[2:47:15] Mexico over the last few years. God has
[2:47:18] really began to use them in a in a
[2:47:20] special way in the mission work there.
[2:47:23] Some of these things are not widely
[2:47:24] broadcast, but they're being done all
[2:47:26] the same.
[2:47:29] Just this last Easter down there in
[2:47:31] Mexico, the Holy Spirit began to pour
[2:47:34] over a service. In one of the last
[2:47:37] services, the pastor's mother-in-law was
[2:47:39] sitting
[2:47:40] there, 78 years old, lost her hearing
[2:47:45] completely when she was a little girl.
[2:47:48] Some of the very parts for the hearing
[2:47:50] wasn't even in her
[2:47:51] [Music]
[2:47:53] ears, completely
[2:47:55] destroyed. But in the prayer line in
[2:47:57] that meeting, God restored that woman's
[2:47:59] healing, gave her hearing
[2:48:02] again at 78 years old.
[2:48:06] You're not too old to be
[2:48:07] [Music]
[2:48:09] healed. Brother Wayne, I'm old. I'm
[2:48:12] about to die. You don't have to die
[2:48:15] sick. You're not too old for the healing
[2:48:18] of
[2:48:19] God. Lots of people in Brother Bram's
[2:48:21] meetings was healed with hearing
[2:48:23] problems. You know, there's many many of
[2:48:25] them I I've studied this in depth
[2:48:27] through the years, but many people come
[2:48:30] in Brother Bram's prayer line. He'd
[2:48:31] start talking to them and maybe they
[2:48:33] were needing some kind of healing and
[2:48:35] he'd say, "I see that you're smoking
[2:48:37] cigarettes."
[2:48:39] He said, "Now, if you would repent of
[2:48:41] that, God will heal you."
[2:48:44] And he'd pray and they receive all kinds
[2:48:47] of different healings, but I I heard one
[2:48:50] one day, this boy walks in the prayer
[2:48:52] line and he can't hear. He's
[2:48:55] deaf. And brother Ram's praying. He
[2:48:57] said, "God," he said,
[2:48:59] "Normally, I would preach the gospel to
[2:49:02] this man and ask him for a
[2:49:05] repentance." And then if he would
[2:49:07] repent, he would receive his healing. He
[2:49:10] said, "But in this case, Lord, I'm
[2:49:12] asking you to give him his healing
[2:49:14] first.
[2:49:16] Heal his ears, Lord, so he can hear the
[2:49:20] gospel."
[2:49:22] [Music]
[2:49:23] Because if you could hear the
[2:49:27] [Music]
[2:49:29] gospel, some of us that are in the
[2:49:32] minister chats, different ones of
[2:49:34] them, just last fall, Sister Jessica
[2:49:38] Alvareo right there at Brother Diego's
[2:49:41] church, we sent out a a long prayer. I
[2:49:44] still got the prayer request, but Jim,
[2:49:45] you probably read
[2:49:47] it. She was battling with leukemia for
[2:49:49] over a year. grew worse and worse in her
[2:49:51] spinal cord. At the end of February this
[2:49:54] year, the cancer had spread into every
[2:49:56] vital organ into her lungs. She was in
[2:50:00] ICU on life
[2:50:02] support. Doctors had said she's come to
[2:50:04] her
[2:50:05] end. Brother Ronnie and brother Diego
[2:50:08] was getting ready to leave on a mission
[2:50:10] trip and he thought he might have to
[2:50:12] cancel
[2:50:13] it. So, he went up to the to the
[2:50:15] hospital. He didn't want to leave her.
[2:50:17] If she was passing, he wanted to remain.
[2:50:19] He went up to them the night before and
[2:50:21] he asked the Lord, "What do you want me
[2:50:22] to do?" The Lord said, "You go. I'll
[2:50:26] take care of
[2:50:28] her. Everything will be all
[2:50:31] right." Two weeks
[2:50:33] ago, she was remitted with not one trace
[2:50:38] of cancer at
[2:50:39] [Applause]
[2:50:44] all. You read the prayer request that
[2:50:47] was on that chap. We still got the
[2:50:50] request in there. Completely
[2:50:53] healed because the power of God is still
[2:50:59] alive. It's the same
[2:51:02] yesterday today.
[2:51:05] And forever. I say tonight, his power is
[2:51:08] still real.
[2:51:10] His power is still real. Maybe you bow
[2:51:12] your hearts with us. I know we're going
[2:51:14] to have a prayer line tomorrow
[2:51:17] night, but I just want to pray with you
[2:51:19] tonight. I want to ask the
[2:51:21] Lord. Maybe there's a special need in
[2:51:23] your life. If there's something you
[2:51:26] need, I just wonder maybe you'll just
[2:51:29] lay your hand one on the other
[2:51:31] tonight. Believers all over this
[2:51:35] building. Almighty
[2:51:39] God, though who we worship
[2:51:42] tonight, we worship the God of heaven.
[2:51:46] Lord, we worship the God that hung the
[2:51:49] stars and the moon, the
[2:51:52] sun, Lord, that built this earth and the
[2:51:55] atmospheres
[2:51:56] thereof. We worship you who built the
[2:51:59] human body, Lord, that designed
[2:52:01] it. Father, some here tonight are sick
[2:52:04] in those bodies, Lord.
[2:52:06] And God, you have proven beyond a doubt
[2:52:09] that you are the
[2:52:10] healer. We ask you tonight that you
[2:52:12] would come into this meeting. You would
[2:52:14] heal the bodies. Lord, you would touch
[2:52:15] the lives. We ask you tonight, Father,
[2:52:18] maybe one here tonight that are under
[2:52:21] depression. Maybe an anxiety has come
[2:52:24] into their life, complexes that begin to
[2:52:26] to deteriorate faith. I pray that the
[2:52:29] power of God would break the hold of
[2:52:31] that enemy right here in this building
[2:52:33] tonight, Lord. Father, I pray as we
[2:52:36] worship the God of salvation, the God of
[2:52:38] healing, the God of mercy, the God of
[2:52:40] deliverance, may you show yourself alive
[2:52:43] among us, Lord. May, Father, miracles
[2:52:46] begin to take place in this building
[2:52:47] tonight, Father, out across the airwaves
[2:52:50] as people begin to listen to these
[2:52:52] sermons. I pray that healing virtues
[2:52:55] would flow wherever your word reaches
[2:52:58] tonight, Lord. May they be reminded that
[2:53:01] you are a God of power. I ask you father
[2:53:04] in the name of Jesus touch your children
[2:53:07] Lord wherever they may be
[2:53:09] father I pray it in the name of Jesus
[2:53:13] [Music]
