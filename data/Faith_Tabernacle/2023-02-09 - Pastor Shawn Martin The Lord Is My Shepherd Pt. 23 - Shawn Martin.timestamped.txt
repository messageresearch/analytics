[42:39] sent your word and healed them of all
[42:41] their diseases and there's power in the
[42:45] word of God
[42:46] we've seen it happen how the word would
[42:49] just break the Fetters off the people
[42:52] and bring Deliverance we've seen the
[42:56] blind eyes come open just by the
[42:58] preaching of the Gospel we've seen
[43:01] things that take place just by Your Word
[43:04] going forth and the people just believe

[43:24] have Glory and Honor we ask these things
[43:27] in your precious name Jesus Christ and
[43:30] the church says
[43:32] amen amen we look in here at the Psalms
[43:37] the 23rd chapter
[43:39] and starting at the first verse the Lord
[43:42] is my shepherd
[43:45] I shall not want
[43:47] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[43:51] Pastures
[43:55] I've got an echo
[43:59] oh you're you're just fine brother Joe I
[44:02] just I I just don't like to hear myself
[44:05] preach no
[44:08] you're fine
[44:10] so second verse he maketh me to lie down
[44:14] in Green Pastures he leadeth me
[44:16] beside the Still Waters
[44:19] he restoreth my soul
[44:22] he leadeth me in the paths of
[44:25] righteousness for his namesake amen you
[44:29] can have your seats this evening
[44:32] a man
[44:34] and uh I want to I guess just continue
[44:39] uh with the title the Lord is my
[44:42] shepherd been on it for a little while
[44:44] but uh and I and I thinking of that he
[44:48] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[44:52] and it you know we we've talked about
[44:55] the the the the two paths the Broadway
[45:00] uh and the narrow way and and how that
[45:04] the Broadway leads to destruction and
[45:08] many there be that that follow this path
[45:12] and uh then the the other path the
[45:16] narrow way uh lead us to life and few
[45:20] there be few there be that that follow
[45:24] this path and so uh we we know that this
[45:29] narrow path is is a path of Life David
[45:34] calls it the path of life and and and
[45:37] and and here in the psalm 16 11 that
[45:41] would show me that will show me and or
[45:44] we'll put it this way that will reveal
[45:46] to me the the the path of life so so the
[45:51] path of life is not mistakenly found
[45:54] it's it's revealed it has to be revealed
[45:58] uh uh to those that will walk this path
[46:02] and so a few there be that that follow
[46:06] or walk on this path amen and so
[46:10] therefore uh uh David uh tells us uh
[46:14] well I I'm gonna put it in in my way of
[46:17] thinking that it's the Lord that reveals
[46:19] it to us for for David said the Lord is
[46:23] my shepherd and and he leadeth me he
[46:27] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[46:30] and so all throughout the Bible it talks
[46:33] about a path and and so I believe that
[46:36] these Paths of righteousness is the same
[46:39] path it's a path of life it's a narrow
[46:42] path it's it's a path that that there's
[46:45] blessings in that path but the Lord is
[46:48] the one that leads us in in these paths
[46:52] you believe that and so now brother
[46:54] Branham he he said now you have to have
[46:57] a guide you have to have a guide if you
[47:00] don't know where you're going and so
[47:02] this is why that that we have to have
[47:05] the Lord as our Shepherd to lead us in
[47:08] these Paths of righteousness and and he
[47:11] says now you don't have to have a guide
[47:13] uh uh to lead you down the Broadway
[47:15] that's what Brad Graham says you you
[47:17] don't have to have a God he said you
[47:19] know all the alleys and everything else
[47:21] else you know all the way to sin you you
[47:25] know all about every sin there is to
[47:27] know you know all the shortcuts you know
[47:30] you you've been around a long time see
[47:33] so you don't need a guide uh uh to take
[47:36] you down this this broad way and and
[47:39] there's no need of somebody telling you
[47:42] about that path no one has to teach you
[47:45] how to steal this is what he's saying
[47:47] now there no one has to teach you how to
[47:49] steal no one has to teach you how to lie
[47:51] no one has to teach you how to commit
[47:54] adultery no one has to teach you how to
[47:57] curse no one has to teach you how to do
[47:59] these evil things because you you know
[48:02] all about that we were born in sin
[48:05] shaped in iniquity coming to this world
[48:07] speaking lies and uh conceived in sin so
[48:11] so we we know all about this and brother
[48:13] Brown said it's posted on he said
[48:16] everywhere on every tree amen if you
[48:19] want to learn about Sin if you're amen I
[48:21] mean even even just a little stage uh uh
[48:25] you know take take it your your little
[48:27] babies and and how they start throwing
[48:29] the temper tantrum and we even when they
[48:31] begin to speak amen they begin to speak
[48:34] lies and and they'll they'll bite and
[48:37] and they'll hit and at a little Age and
[48:40] and these things because that's that
[48:42] that you they don't need a guide to tell
[48:45] them about this that old carnal nature
[48:47] is is this way but the Lord is my
[48:50] shepherd amen so so he's wanting to take
[48:54] us away from that broad way and bring us
[48:57] into a narrow way that that we don't
[48:59] know nothing about and and so the Lord
[49:02] is my shepherd He leads me in the paths
[49:05] of righteousness so we need a God do you
[49:08] believe that we we need a guide
[49:11] um you know I I thought of this as
[49:14] Joshua you know we we talked about
[49:16] Joshua last weekend and his ministry
[49:19] versus uh Moses's Menace history but but
[49:23] Joshua told told Israel as they were
[49:26] fixing to go over into the promised land
[49:29] uh uh there in Joshua 3 and 3. he said
[49:33] when you see the Ark of the Covenant uh
[49:37] of the Lord your God and the priests
[49:40] that uh the Levites bearing it then you
[49:43] shall remove from your place and go
[49:46] after it now now remember that when you
[49:48] see the Ark of the Covenant so then then
[49:52] we know that the the what what is the
[49:54] Ark of the Covenant the word ain't that
[49:56] right amen don't follow nothing else but
[49:58] the word amen and so he says when you
[50:01] see the word amen begin to go then you
[50:04] follow after don't get ahead of the word
[50:06] don't get beside the word that you
[50:09] follow after the word ain't that right
[50:12] and he said yet there shall be a space
[50:15] between you and it about 2 000 cubits by
[50:18] measure come not near unto it see let it
[50:22] be the priests amen uh uh uh bearing
[50:25] that word don't come near it that you
[50:29] may know the way by which you must go
[50:31] ain't that right amen for you have not
[50:34] passed this way uh uh heretofore in
[50:39] other words you you ain't been this way
[50:40] before amen so God would set a guide for
[50:44] the children of Israel and that would be
[50:47] the word of God Amen and the word of God
[50:50] would take them into the promised land
[50:52] because they hadn't been there and they
[50:55] needed a god ain't that right a man so
[50:58] the word was their guide or we could we
[51:01] could uh identify it as the spirit of
[51:03] Truth amen because you remember when
[51:07] Joshua he didn't know what them tell the
[51:10] names of them tribes meant but uh uh Yet
[51:13] brother Brown told us that uh uh when
[51:16] the mothers were given birth to the
[51:18] children they they would place them in
[51:21] the promise land while they were in
[51:23] travail years before they got to the
[51:25] promised land and and they would call
[51:27] their name and their name men a uh a
[51:31] certain position uh in the in the
[51:33] promised land and so they didn't know
[51:36] what their name meant Joshua didn't even
[51:38] know what their name meant but the
[51:40] spirit of Truth was with them amen and
[51:42] and it began to be revealed by to Joshua
[51:46] and Joshua would set each tribe in the
[51:49] in the land ain't that rhyme a man so so
[51:52] we we find a man that there was the
[51:56] spirit of Truth the word uh remember the
[51:59] Book of Joshua parallels the book of
[52:02] Ephesians and brother Branham said the
[52:04] Book of Joshua should be called the book
[52:06] of Ephesians of the Old Testament so so
[52:10] we know where we positionally stand that
[52:13] we are in the Ephesus again at the book
[52:16] of Ephesians is is a book of positioning
[52:20] it's it's dealing with our placing is
[52:23] dealing with our adoption it's it's
[52:25] dealing with what we are in the word of
[52:28] God and it's all predestination ain't
[52:31] that right amen the book of Grace the
[52:34] and that's what Joshua's Ministry was
[52:37] was the ministry of Grace amen so today
[52:40] as we we understanding now that we are
[52:44] in an Ephesus again a positioning and as
[52:48] Israel the natural people needed a God
[52:51] so do we need a guide as well see and so
[52:55] uh uh now it it came time uh for for uh
[53:00] the church amen uh to cross over into
[53:04] the promised land we we are we are at a
[53:07] place and and I hope you understand
[53:09] exactly where the position that the
[53:13] Church of the Living God is at right now
[53:15] we are I and and I'm gonna have to say
[53:18] it this way I believe we've crossed
[53:20] we've crossed across the into the
[53:22] promised land we are in the promised
[53:25] land amen and and and remember it was
[53:29] only in the promised land that
[53:31] everything that God had predestinated
[53:33] for them in that land now become a
[53:37] reality they were no longer talking
[53:38] about it long no longer prophesying
[53:41] about it no longer uh singing about it
[53:44] and dreaming about it and longing for it
[53:47] it was now right there before them ain't
[53:50] that right but they needed to God they
[53:53] had to have a guide to take them into
[53:55] the land hey can you say amen and so we
[53:58] have never been this way before do you
[54:00] believe that if you go listen to the
[54:03] guide or and I believe it's the god
[54:05] brother Branham tells us we've never
[54:07] have been this way before you can look
[54:10] at history and you can say that through
[54:13] all of history there's the church today
[54:15] has never been this way before can you
[54:18] say Amen Paul waited for the
[54:20] manifestation of son of God they talked
[54:22] about it they talked about the Rapture
[54:24] they talked about adoption they talked
[54:27] about all uh uh the church coming back
[54:29] into a Oneness amen and being the the
[54:32] the the body or the fullness of him that
[54:35] filleth all in all and here we are in
[54:38] this day they talked about it but I'm
[54:41] telling you we're not prophesying about
[54:42] it we're not dreaming about it amen but
[54:45] I'm telling you young people I'm telling
[54:47] you parents and your preachers and
[54:49] myself we are there in the land can you
[54:53] say man and we've never been this way
[54:55] before so brother Brown says don't you
[54:58] don't don't travel your denominational
[55:00] Roots now stay right behind the word can
[55:04] you say man amen don't don't follow
[55:07] Pentecostal Traditions don't follow what
[55:10] they done in the Pentecostal age amen
[55:12] because it's going to bring you a bunch
[55:14] of confusion ain't that right stay
[55:16] behind the word
[55:18] ain't that right stay behind the word he
[55:21] says because you've never you haven't
[55:23] passed this way before so another place
[55:26] he says here we are right everything
[55:28] right at the door and the people still
[55:31] following after their Creed he said you
[55:33] better stay behind the word the word
[55:36] will lead you across don't be led by
[55:39] Sensations don't be led by visitations
[55:41] don't be led by amen some Supernatural
[55:44] power or some Supernatural thing out
[55:46] there you remember this Satan can
[55:49] transform himself into an angel of Light
[55:51] just as much as anything else he can
[55:54] impersonate just as good as the bad the
[55:57] rest of them can you say amen amen
[55:59] that's exactly right so he says stay you
[56:02] better stay behind the word for the word
[56:05] will lead you cross amen he said because
[56:09] the word is Christ and Christ is God and
[56:12] God is the Holy Ghost so stay behind the
[56:15] word oh yes sir stay with that God
[56:18] everybody say stay with that God Amen
[56:21] now that's a warning for you and I
[56:23] remember he knew I believe he knew he
[56:25] was going to leave amen and and and and
[56:27] and so or the Holy Spirit did anyways
[56:30] and here we are what's 50 60 years now
[56:33] as his brother Bradham and it has left
[56:36] the scene and it's gotten more crazier
[56:38] it's gotten more fanatical it's gotten
[56:41] more dangerous it's gotten more
[56:43] deceiving amen and yet we hear the voice
[56:46] of a prophet screaming out stay behind
[56:49] the words can you say man you don't need
[56:52] another Prophet to come do you amen with
[56:54] us saith the Lord just stay with the
[56:56] word that God restored unto you stay
[57:00] right behind that word can you say amen
[57:03] he said don't get in front of it you
[57:05] stay behind it let it lead you
[57:09] don't you lead it
[57:12] you let it go let him lead you can you
[57:16] say Amen see we know nothing about that
[57:19] road we know nothing and and I'll say it
[57:21] this way we know nothing about the paths
[57:23] of righteousness we've we've never in
[57:25] for our age we've never been this way
[57:27] before so see you're you're you're
[57:31] you're you're you're in a different land
[57:32] Church hey you understand what I'm
[57:35] saying you are in a different land
[57:38] that's exactly right see and uh then
[57:41] what's been down Through the Ages and so
[57:43] uh uh to the ones who have crossed over
[57:46] Jordan you are in a different land your
[57:50] surroundings are different don't you
[57:52] look at uh at church natural amen and
[57:55] say that's your surroundings no you're
[57:56] in a different land you can you say man
[57:59] amen don't look at science and all these
[58:02] other things and say oh and get come no
[58:04] no that's not your land you are in a
[58:07] different land where the blessings of
[58:08] God the promises of God and the things
[58:11] that were in the mind of God that has
[58:13] been hidden is now being revealed Amen
[58:17] to the church can you say amen I hope
[58:19] that makes sense to you amen but it's
[58:22] another land brother Brown said it's a
[58:23] Heavenly land and so he says you're born
[58:26] again Heaven he's born again you are
[58:29] born again so he says you are in the
[58:32] promised land amen yes sir so he says
[58:36] here you can look you know your way
[58:38] around he's talking about in the world
[58:40] now just just the world common Flesh and
[58:42] Blood Man uh woman boy girl he said you
[58:45] you know your way around here oh yes you
[58:48] know you know how to stand on a certain
[58:50] hand of cards and you know what the dice
[58:53] you know when it Rose what it means and
[58:56] everything like that but when it comes
[58:57] to nobody the Holiness and righteousness
[59:00] and the power of God and how the Holy
[59:02] Spirit operates and what it does you
[59:05] better stay right behind that word can
[59:07] you say man we're not just Faith
[59:09] Tabernacle we're not just your average
[59:11] Church goer amen we are people that were
[59:14] predestinated to a land that was
[59:16] predestinated for us the supernatural
[59:19] belongs to us the promises belong to us
[59:21] don't try to operate this Christian life
[59:24] amen based on a carnal mind and off your
[59:26] own works and all of these things you're
[59:28] in a different land stay behind the word
[59:31] can you say Amen you might be able to
[59:33] run a business good that don't you try
[59:35] to run the church like a business it
[59:37] takes the supernatural
[59:39] can you say Amen see you've never passed
[59:43] this way before so Jesus said those that
[59:46] pass this way now he's talking about the
[59:48] uh the the the the uh the narrow way the
[59:52] the the the the the the the paths of
[59:54] righteousness though Jesus said those
[59:57] that pass this way these signs will
[59:59] follow them ain't that right my name in
[1:00:03] my name they'll cast out Devils speak
[1:00:05] with new tongues or take up serpents or
[1:00:08] drink deadly things and it won't harm
[1:00:10] them if they lay their hands on the sick
[1:00:12] they shall recover most of them refuse
[1:00:15] it and deny it and say it's not even
[1:00:18] inspired but they're not following the
[1:00:20] guide they're following a man-made Creed
[1:00:23] that you better stay right behind the
[1:00:26] word because you haven't passed this way
[1:00:28] can you say amen amen that not just any
[1:00:31] man is going to work the third pull amen
[1:00:34] this is something that's going to take a
[1:00:36] God to get us there and you've not
[1:00:38] passed this way so stay behind the word
[1:00:40] of God
[1:00:42] ain't that right so see so we we find
[1:00:45] Jesus said the works that I do shall you
[1:00:48] do also even greater than these shall
[1:00:52] you do ain't that right that's a promise
[1:00:54] and you're in the promised land and
[1:00:58] you've never done that before we've
[1:01:00] we've never come into that place of the
[1:01:02] greater word we've seen what a prophet
[1:01:04] done amen but now that them greater
[1:01:06] worse wasn't just applied to brother
[1:01:08] Branham it was applied to the Church of
[1:01:10] the Living God and he's brought us over
[1:01:12] into the promised land you've not gone
[1:01:15] this way before but don't you let
[1:01:17] unbelief amen discourage you from and
[1:01:20] don't you let the Giants take the take
[1:01:22] your faith away you stay behind the
[1:01:25] promise the word of God
[1:01:27] hey can you say Amen everything that
[1:01:30] Jesus Promised everything that this
[1:01:32] Bible promised for us today it's now
[1:01:35] reality because you're in the Promised
[1:01:37] Land
[1:01:38] ain't that Ryan
[1:01:40] amen so brother Branham says you'll come
[1:01:43] to church and you hear somebody raise up
[1:01:45] and hollered glory to God hallelujah why
[1:01:48] you'll say my goodness they never did
[1:01:49] that in my church I'll get up and walk
[1:01:51] out he said be careful
[1:01:53] stay behind the word
[1:01:55] stay behind the word and let the God
[1:01:58] lead you and then it's hard for people
[1:02:00] to believe in the Supernatural amen but
[1:02:03] stay behind the word
[1:02:05] hey hey Ryan see so we we find a man uh
[1:02:10] the trouble of it is brother Brown says
[1:02:12] the people that come to church they just
[1:02:14] said a few minutes and when something
[1:02:15] goes on that they're not used to they
[1:02:18] get up and walk out
[1:02:20] ain't that right he says another places
[1:02:22] I admire a little woman from a cold
[1:02:25] formal church just had prayer for her
[1:02:27] God's going to heal that little woman
[1:02:29] but she didn't understand this and she'd
[1:02:31] know nothing about it she'd come in and
[1:02:33] she said she didn't know but I told her
[1:02:36] come on and see me and she was kind of
[1:02:38] timid and backward but the guide kept
[1:02:41] telling her move on move on and he said
[1:02:45] she got it
[1:02:46] she got exactly what she needed because
[1:02:49] the God was leading her to it aren't you
[1:02:52] glad that God's been leading you it led
[1:02:54] us to the message did it not it's
[1:02:56] leading us see he says see it's because
[1:02:59] the holy spirit that guides us into
[1:03:02] these things it's it's the holy spirit
[1:03:04] that guides us now in Scripture that I
[1:03:07] want to look at is Psalms 32 and 8 and
[1:03:11] and I hope we've made sense so far that
[1:03:13] we need a guide but notice what the
[1:03:16] Bible says there God says it I will
[1:03:18] instruct thee and teach thee in the way
[1:03:21] that thou shalt go I will guide thee
[1:03:25] with mine I
[1:03:27] ain't that right and so by this
[1:03:30] scripture just by this scripture alone
[1:03:32] we can understand the importance of God
[1:03:35] sending to us the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:03:38] for a true Prophet sees through the eye
[1:03:43] of God and tells us what has been tells
[1:03:47] us what is and tells us what's going to
[1:03:50] be ain't that right so God promised to
[1:03:54] lead his people amen by his eye amen and
[1:03:58] by looking through the eye of God Amen
[1:04:01] we talked about it the other day but the
[1:04:03] prophet name amen 2500 years ago or
[1:04:07] around that time amen back in the Years
[1:04:10] could look ahead to this day and tell us
[1:04:14] about our cars that we would have tell
[1:04:16] us about the highways tell us about the
[1:04:19] wrecks that would happen they were
[1:04:20] jostling a man see and and the staying
[1:04:24] see and he was able to do that by
[1:04:27] looking through through the eye of God
[1:04:28] ain't that right every god-sent Prophet
[1:04:32] has been able to foresee the future by
[1:04:35] looking through the eye of of God and so
[1:04:38] that's what a prophet is called he's
[1:04:40] called a Seer a man he's able to get
[1:04:43] lifted up and he's able to see what a
[1:04:47] natural man cannot see and and and so we
[1:04:50] find that he sees things that are
[1:04:53] impossible for us to see and that's why
[1:04:56] we needed to profit in this day amen we
[1:04:59] didn't need a theologian amen he
[1:05:01] couldn't look through the eye of God we
[1:05:03] we didn't need just some uh irregular
[1:05:06] preacher amen we we uh uh uh we needed a
[1:05:11] prophet see because he can look through
[1:05:14] the eye of God the prophet of our day
[1:05:16] read the same Bible that we have been
[1:05:19] reading for centuries but he saw things
[1:05:22] that the brightest mind could never see
[1:05:25] ain't that right God could take a
[1:05:29] seventh grade hillbilly Kentucky and
[1:05:31] amen and reveal the word to us that that
[1:05:35] the brightest the most educated preacher
[1:05:37] could never uh uh uh uh see in in here
[1:05:42] ain't that right see but God promised
[1:05:44] that he would guide us by his eye ain't
[1:05:47] that right so therefore a prophet of
[1:05:50] this day was able to give us the the the
[1:05:53] correct interpretation of the word of
[1:05:57] God Amen now if the word is going to be
[1:05:59] our leader then we're going to have to
[1:06:01] have the the correct interpretation of
[1:06:03] the word ain't that right we're not
[1:06:05] going to accept anything as the word of
[1:06:07] God Amen but I tell you what we've
[1:06:10] looked at it and we've understood that
[1:06:12] today God would send the prophet of
[1:06:14] Malachi 4 and he saw things that were
[1:06:17] totally different amen because he was
[1:06:19] looking through the eye of God he was
[1:06:21] able to give the interpret correct
[1:06:23] interpretation of dreams that God gave
[1:06:26] he was able to see Visions he was able
[1:06:28] to see in people's lives and tell them
[1:06:31] things that they themselves either
[1:06:34] forgot about or or or didn't even know
[1:06:39] about see and and he was able to tell
[1:06:42] the kind of disease a person had that
[1:06:45] even the doctor didn't even know how how
[1:06:48] to describe it they they couldn't even
[1:06:50] find these diseases and yet there was a
[1:06:53] prophet that would tell them and even
[1:06:55] when the doctor would keep it from the
[1:06:57] patient amen that they were dying there
[1:06:59] was the spirit of God the prophet
[1:07:01] looking through the eye of God and could
[1:07:04] tell him now the doctor don't want you
[1:07:05] to know this but you're dying and you
[1:07:07] ain't got much to live it's going to
[1:07:09] take the grace of God what what man
[1:07:11] could do that that wasn't a physician he
[1:07:13] wasn't trained in science he wasn't
[1:07:15] trained in the medical fields and all
[1:07:17] that see it was through the eye of God
[1:07:20] that he could deceive these things amen
[1:07:23] now prophets are human beings just like
[1:07:25] you and I and that right they are men of
[1:07:29] like passion just as we are but God
[1:07:32] would enables him Amen to look through
[1:07:36] his eye so to guide his people amen now
[1:07:40] this is important church amen you've got
[1:07:42] to have a guide and you got to know who
[1:07:44] your God is amen because a goat will
[1:07:47] lead you to death ain't that right but
[1:07:49] but the prophet or David that would
[1:07:51] declare to us that the Lord is Our
[1:07:54] Shepherd and if the shepherd The Lord Is
[1:07:56] Our Shepherd then the Sheep's got to
[1:07:58] know the way of the shepherd amen the
[1:08:00] Sheep's got to know how the shepherd
[1:08:02] Works can you say amen that's right and
[1:08:05] we we just believe that and so prophets
[1:08:08] to whom the word of the Lord came were
[1:08:12] the the mouthpiece of God ain't that
[1:08:15] right the prophet Isaiah had thus saith
[1:08:18] the Lord the prophet Moses had thus
[1:08:20] saith the Lord every Prophet down
[1:08:22] Through the Ages a true prophet of God
[1:08:24] had thus saith the Lord ain't that right
[1:08:27] amen God would use their lips Amen to
[1:08:31] speak his word and so the the Bible is
[1:08:34] the word of God and I'm getting
[1:08:36] somewhere now so stay with me that the
[1:08:38] Bible is the word of God that was spoken
[1:08:42] from the lips of mortal men that they
[1:08:45] were prophets amen and not one prophecy
[1:08:48] ever failed and and and even though a
[1:08:51] prophet was maybe 400 years from uh
[1:08:54] separate from the other one they would
[1:08:56] all speak the same thing they didn't
[1:08:58] have the whole Bible like we did but yet
[1:09:00] their prophecies was in continuity all
[1:09:04] the way down why they were looking
[1:09:05] through the same eye and that was the
[1:09:08] eye of God a prophet with decease and he
[1:09:11] would be buried but the same Eternal God
[1:09:13] had the same Eternal eye amen and
[1:09:16] therefore he would raise up Prophet
[1:09:18] after prophet and they could look
[1:09:20] through the eye of God Amen until what
[1:09:22] would be until what has been and tell
[1:09:25] what is going on can you say Amen oh my
[1:09:29] and to think of it we rest our hopes
[1:09:31] upon what they've said we rest Our Hope
[1:09:34] amen not Upon A man we're not following
[1:09:37] a man we're not following his idea we're
[1:09:40] following amen the voice of God
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:09:45] so a prophet is important to us because
[1:09:49] God speaks to them now this is how
[1:09:52] important a man a prophet is to us and
[1:09:56] and and of Psalm 17 4 David would say by
[1:10:00] the word of thy lips by the word of thy
[1:10:04] lips I have kept me from the paths of
[1:10:06] the Destroyer
[1:10:08] so so think of that by the word that
[1:10:11] came from his lips can you say Amen not
[1:10:14] David's lips amen but God's lips but we
[1:10:17] know God the only lips that God had was
[1:10:19] a prophet that would have thus saith the
[1:10:21] Lord ain't that right amen for brother
[1:10:23] Brown said they were the mouthpiece of
[1:10:25] God Amen Israel knew the importance of a
[1:10:28] prophet if they wanted to hear from God
[1:10:29] Amen they needed a prophet go to the
[1:10:32] prophet let's let the prophet speak for
[1:10:34] us ain't that right and then we needed
[1:10:37] it now so God has not left us without a
[1:10:40] God Amen it's because now now notice
[1:10:44] it's because of the message of the hour
[1:10:47] that we are able to look through the eye
[1:10:50] of God Amen we are able to look for the
[1:10:53] message came by the prophet looking
[1:10:56] through the eye God's eye ain't that
[1:10:58] right amen now if a man isn't looking
[1:11:01] through the eye of God he's blind amen
[1:11:05] and he does not know where to go ain't
[1:11:07] that right amen and he walks in darkness
[1:11:10] for he cannot see Amen brother Branham
[1:11:13] said we will not walk in darkness as
[1:11:16] long as we look through God's eye and
[1:11:18] you say amen amen this will not be a
[1:11:21] book of Darkness if you can look through
[1:11:23] God's eye can you say amen amen and I'm
[1:11:26] so glad that we've got a message of the
[1:11:28] hour today amen because it is the
[1:11:31] interpretation uh that have come by
[1:11:34] looking a prophet looking through God's
[1:11:36] eye amen safe amen and I just personally
[1:11:40] believe amen that there are ministers
[1:11:42] today amen that are under the same
[1:11:44] inspiration they're not bringing a new
[1:11:46] message amen but they're listening to
[1:11:48] them tapes they're studying the message
[1:11:50] amen and they're seeing something that
[1:11:53] the prophet caught amen and I believe
[1:11:55] that the people of this age is seeing
[1:11:58] something that the prophet caught and
[1:12:00] the book as it became a new book to
[1:12:02] brother Branham it's becoming a new book
[1:12:04] to us it's becoming a new book to you
[1:12:07] mom and dads amen it's becoming a new
[1:12:10] book to you young people because you're
[1:12:12] able amen by the prophet and the
[1:12:15] interpretation to look through the eye
[1:12:17] of God
[1:12:19] [Applause]
[1:12:20] see by the message of the hour
[1:12:22] we're able to see what has been and what
[1:12:25] is and what shall be
[1:12:27] amen by the message of the hour we're
[1:12:30] able to see ourselves in the word of God
[1:12:32] ain't that right amen I just thank God
[1:12:36] for for his All-Seeing Eye a man see so
[1:12:40] the Bible is the only book The Prophet
[1:12:42] says that can tell you uh where you come
[1:12:46] from who you are and where you're going
[1:12:49] this Bible
[1:12:51] ain't that right but it took God's eye
[1:12:54] to reveal it it took a prophet being
[1:12:57] able to see a man through a different
[1:13:00] lens through a different eye a man then
[1:13:02] a theologian what a theologian was
[1:13:04] seeing amen see this Bible has been
[1:13:06] sealed up meaning that there could not
[1:13:09] be an understanding of it it's been a
[1:13:12] mysterious book can you say man and the
[1:13:15] Mysteries have been probed at throughout
[1:13:18] these denominational years the prophet
[1:13:20] said and so we we find in Revelations 10
[1:13:24] 7 that that uh if foretold of the
[1:13:28] seventh angel coming and revealing the
[1:13:31] Mysteries that had been hidden in the
[1:13:33] word it would take the bloody bleeding
[1:13:36] Lamb of God Amen to step forward and
[1:13:40] take the book out of the right hand of
[1:13:42] him that's set upon the throne and the
[1:13:44] loose the seals thereof amen and then we
[1:13:47] find in Revelations 10 1. amen now we're
[1:13:51] looking through the I've got now amen
[1:13:53] and we're seeing a man that that Mighty
[1:13:56] Angel descending from heaven with an
[1:13:58] open book and we know it to be only
[1:14:01] Christ it could be the spirit of truth
[1:14:03] that has come in this day ain't that
[1:14:06] right amen now the prophet would tell us
[1:14:08] the first thing that represented that
[1:14:10] Redemption come the lamb that had been
[1:14:13] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:14:15] he took the book Glory opened the book
[1:14:18] tore off the seals and sent it down to
[1:14:21] the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal
[1:14:24] it to his people and the prophet said
[1:14:27] that that seven angel had to be a
[1:14:29] prophet for the word of God to come to
[1:14:31] amen but he wouldn't get his own
[1:14:34] interpretation now he would look through
[1:14:36] an eye the same God that promised to
[1:14:39] guide his people by this eye amen he
[1:14:42] would raise up that Prophet Amen to
[1:14:45] guide us today do you believe that amen
[1:14:48] we're being guided amen so the 7 of
[1:14:51] Angel brother Brown said winds up all
[1:14:54] the loose sins that these fellas probed
[1:14:56] at and the mystery comes down from God
[1:14:59] as the word of God and reveals the
[1:15:02] entire revelation of God not one mystery
[1:15:05] is closed not one mystery is hidden
[1:15:08] everything is opened up we don't need a
[1:15:12] nice day messenger amen we don't need
[1:15:14] another Prophet to come and reveal
[1:15:16] something we don't need brother Branham
[1:15:18] to come back and open up the seals the
[1:15:21] entire revelation of God has been made
[1:15:26] known can you say amen that's why we
[1:15:29] stay with the prophet of the age amen
[1:15:32] the seventh angel messenger ain't that
[1:15:35] right so you you remember now John
[1:15:38] foresaw the lamb opening the book and
[1:15:42] when the book came open John Saul his
[1:15:45] name on it
[1:15:46] he saw his name on the book ain't that
[1:15:50] right and I just saw this in if you
[1:15:51] notice John in the Revelation he was
[1:15:54] Guided by the by by one of these seven
[1:15:56] angels even he himself had to be guided
[1:16:01] ain't that right and he said it was one
[1:16:04] of the Seven Angels amen and he speaks
[1:16:06] of the Seven Angels uh uh there in
[1:16:08] Revelations chapter one amen and that
[1:16:11] angel amen told him that he was a
[1:16:14] prophet amen remember he was going about
[1:16:16] John was going to Bow Down and Worship
[1:16:18] Him amen he said oh no no no don't
[1:16:20] worship me worship God Amen I'm just of
[1:16:23] your fellow brother and one of the
[1:16:24] prophets ain't that right amen see amen
[1:16:27] but it was a prophet that was God John
[1:16:30] not a reformer it was a prophet amen
[1:16:33] that would guide John and and and of
[1:16:35] course John represents the Bride of
[1:16:37] Jesus Christ can you say Amen but I say
[1:16:41] this the book amen the book remains
[1:16:43] mysterious if you're not looking through
[1:16:46] the eye of God
[1:16:47] right can you say Amen now and I'm
[1:16:51] getting somewhere now but hopefully
[1:16:53] tonight but brother Branham said you
[1:16:55] cannot read this Bible as you would a
[1:16:57] newspaper ain't that right the Bible is
[1:16:59] a love letter
[1:17:01] can you say man it's it's a love letter
[1:17:04] if you're getting law out of this book
[1:17:05] amen for this age you've missed it it's
[1:17:09] a message of Grace it's a love letter
[1:17:11] and brother Branham said the real
[1:17:13] message is hidden between the lines see
[1:17:16] it's going to take an eye not your eye
[1:17:18] not your understanding it would take the
[1:17:21] eye of God Amen that we could see
[1:17:23] through and really see what it is yes my
[1:17:26] name is Sean Martin is not in there but
[1:17:29] when I look through the eye of God I see
[1:17:31] that I'm in here I'm part of every
[1:17:34] promise yes sir amen and you can't take
[1:17:38] that away from me Hallelujah I've
[1:17:40] already looked through the eye of God
[1:17:42] ain't that right amen see so you cannot
[1:17:45] understand this amen you cannot
[1:17:47] understand God's love letter amen his
[1:17:50] Secrets Amen to his bride amen through
[1:17:54] by having some theological
[1:17:56] interpretation of it ain't that right
[1:17:58] Luke 10 21 Jesus said I thank the old
[1:18:02] father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[1:18:05] thou has hid these things from the wise
[1:18:08] and prudent amen seeds so it's the wise
[1:18:11] it's hid from the wise and prudent amen
[1:18:15] job speaking here in job 12 25 5 they
[1:18:20] grew up in the dark without light and he
[1:18:23] maketh them to stagger like a drunken
[1:18:26] man amen job 17 3 for thou has hid their
[1:18:30] heart from understanding therefore Thou
[1:18:33] shalt not exalt them now as I've been
[1:18:38] reading these scriptures and stuff I I
[1:18:39] just get excited and and hopefully you
[1:18:42] know the spirit of God would just take
[1:18:44] it into you of what a blessing it is
[1:18:46] Amen to have a greater understanding
[1:18:50] than just a carnal understanding of this
[1:18:53] Bible amen because you'll never be able
[1:18:55] to see the things that God has in this
[1:18:58] Bible except we look through the eye of
[1:19:01] God can you say amen amen and soak here
[1:19:04] amen he's hid their understanding
[1:19:07] therefore he shall not exalt them this
[1:19:10] tells us that God exalts his people by
[1:19:13] giving them the understanding or the
[1:19:15] river Revelation ain't that right and
[1:19:18] this is why Satan hates Revelation amen
[1:19:21] he hates it amen for the prophet said he
[1:19:24] knows that if the people get the true
[1:19:26] revelation of the true church and what
[1:19:28] she is she and what she stands for that
[1:19:32] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[1:19:35] an invincible harm man amen see
[1:19:38] revelation will Elevate you up amen from
[1:19:41] from just a a beggar Amen to a child of
[1:19:45] the king it will Elevate you amen it'll
[1:19:48] elevate your prayer it'll elevate your
[1:19:51] your worship it'll Elevate you your
[1:19:54] faith it'll Elevate you all together
[1:19:56] because you're not coming to church as a
[1:19:58] vagabond you're not coming to church
[1:20:00] thinking that you're just a coincidence
[1:20:02] you're not coming to church just
[1:20:04] thinking that you're just never gonna
[1:20:05] make it amen in question how can I and
[1:20:09] God why and and I just don't know but
[1:20:12] now that Revelation has elevated you
[1:20:14] amen into a position mission that you
[1:20:17] can now tell the devil get out of my
[1:20:18] life get out of my home get out of my
[1:20:21] church leave my daughter alone leave my
[1:20:24] son alone leave my husband alone
[1:20:27] amen see it elevates you but he will not
[1:20:31] Elevate those that has hid the mystery
[1:20:34] from can you shave man but what God is
[1:20:37] Grace to you that God would reveal he a
[1:20:40] hidden word to you amen because he's
[1:20:43] elevating you that's what he's doing he
[1:20:45] gave us a prophet to see through the eye
[1:20:47] of God that you could see what he is
[1:20:50] seeing by Revelation and you're elevated
[1:20:55] do you believe that this bride is
[1:20:58] exalted above demon powers
[1:21:00] do you believe that for the Bible says
[1:21:03] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[1:21:04] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:21:07] against it and the prophet said it's the
[1:21:09] revelation of Jesus Christ and you're
[1:21:12] part of Jesus Christ the revelation of
[1:21:15] this day is you being missed Jesus
[1:21:18] Christ you are that anointing you are
[1:21:21] the predestinated seed of God
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:25] yes sir
[1:21:27] you're exalted above demonic powers
[1:21:30] this bride is exalted above negative
[1:21:32] voices
[1:21:33] this bride is exalted you're more
[1:21:36] exalted than the president of the United
[1:21:38] States your prayer is more powerful than
[1:21:40] an angel's prayer can you say man that's
[1:21:43] what the prophet says your prayer gets
[1:21:45] somewhere with God more than an angel
[1:21:47] you mean more to God than an Angelic
[1:21:50] being for you've got the blood of Jesus
[1:21:53] Christ flowing through your veins
[1:21:58] now God has hid these things
[1:22:01] Paul said from that wise and prudent and
[1:22:04] has revealed them unto babes and the
[1:22:07] prophet said such as will learn
[1:22:09] ain't that right
[1:22:10] now listen now we know we're living in
[1:22:13] the time of Capstone
[1:22:15] of the Capstone
[1:22:16] The Seven Ages have run out
[1:22:19] amen now it's time for the Capstone do
[1:22:21] you believe that that's what this
[1:22:23] message is it's the Capstone the
[1:22:25] Capstone finishes the work do you
[1:22:27] believe that it's not the beginning of
[1:22:29] the work it's the completion of the work
[1:22:31] amen see uh uh the Great Pyramid amen
[1:22:35] it's it's a it's still a mystery today
[1:22:37] of how man built that amen but it was
[1:22:40] never complete amen because the Capstone
[1:22:43] was never laid upon it ain't that right
[1:22:45] amen that's right see they didn't put
[1:22:48] the Capstone on it amen but but then and
[1:22:51] and and and we know that the pyramid the
[1:22:54] Great Pyramid is god's second Bible amen
[1:22:57] and and Enoch's the one that built that
[1:22:59] under inspiration and and and and and
[1:23:01] and so uh uh but they didn't put the
[1:23:04] Capstone on it and and I believe it was
[1:23:06] inspired that they didn't to show that
[1:23:09] Jesus Christ the Capstone would be
[1:23:12] rejected when he's first came ain't that
[1:23:15] right he was rejected amen but see in
[1:23:19] this Sage everybody's saying this age
[1:23:22] Jesus comes as the Capstone
[1:23:24] [Applause]
[1:23:26] can you say man to the bride
[1:23:28] and he will not be rejected by her again
[1:23:31] he ain't gonna be rejected he's going to
[1:23:34] be received and the Bible's already
[1:23:37] promised that they would cry Grace Grace
[1:23:39] unto The Headstone as he comes down amen
[1:23:43] he's resting up on her
[1:23:46] finishing her off she becomes power of
[1:23:49] his power life of his life word of his
[1:23:52] word Spirit of his Spirit she is him
[1:23:57] Ain't That Rock she becomes the
[1:24:00] Masterpiece that God started in the day
[1:24:02] of Pentecost
[1:24:04] that's right see so Christ the Capstone
[1:24:07] comes down upon the bride and she and he
[1:24:11] becomes one and the same
[1:24:13] now brother Brown said Christ will have
[1:24:15] to be in the church the anointed of the
[1:24:17] word to make everything fulfilled keep
[1:24:19] that in mind everything fulfilled amen
[1:24:22] see that's and that's the Capstone that
[1:24:25] comes upon the last Church age not the
[1:24:27] laodicea now it's a calling out of that
[1:24:30] a bride out of a church a church out of
[1:24:33] a church and otherwise just like he
[1:24:36] called a nation out of a nation in Egypt
[1:24:38] now we're living in that day and we're
[1:24:40] grateful for these great things that
[1:24:42] we've been seeing ain't that right now
[1:24:45] if you'll put that picture up amen now
[1:24:47] our American dollar testifies of the day
[1:24:50] that we're living in ain't that right
[1:24:53] amen here's the pyramid there amen and
[1:24:57] then right under that it says under the
[1:24:58] pyramid it says the Great Seal and
[1:25:01] brother Brown says now why didn't they
[1:25:02] put the Seal of the American seal on it
[1:25:05] amen which is the eagle amen he said
[1:25:08] because that's not God's sealed this is
[1:25:10] God's seal testifying of the age that
[1:25:12] we're living in and if you notice
[1:25:15] there's the Capstone coming down and
[1:25:17] what's in that Capstone it's an eye can
[1:25:20] you say man amen it would be the eye
[1:25:23] that God promised Amen in in in Psalms
[1:25:26] that I would guide thee with my eye amen
[1:25:30] and even an American our government has
[1:25:33] to testify of it they don't understand
[1:25:35] what they're saying that God would say
[1:25:37] there would be a Prophet come out of
[1:25:39] this nation and he would be the one to
[1:25:41] get to the people and lead them into the
[1:25:43] plan to promise and what we see is an
[1:25:46] eye amen can you say Amen God's showing
[1:25:49] that he's true to his word and even the
[1:25:52] prophet said and even our own government
[1:25:54] is testifying of it
[1:25:57] I'm bored hey
[1:26:00] do you love him
[1:26:03] Hallelujah
[1:26:05] it's our own American dollars testifying
[1:26:07] of the Capstone coming
[1:26:09] down in this day
[1:26:11] and the Capstone the prophet said is a
[1:26:13] great big eye amen see what is it it's
[1:26:15] the eye of God the spirit of truth
[1:26:18] that's leading us into all truth the
[1:26:21] Capstone Ministry can you say Amen now
[1:26:25] if you'll give me some time amen I'm
[1:26:27] trying to hurry amen but this reminds me
[1:26:29] of what Paul wrote in Ephesians now and
[1:26:33] he's praying for this day Ephesians 1
[1:26:35] 16. I cease not to give thanks for you
[1:26:38] making mention of you in my prayer that
[1:26:42] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:26:44] father of Glory may give unto you the
[1:26:47] spirit of wisdom and understanding of
[1:26:51] spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the
[1:26:53] knowledge of him can you say Amen Spirit
[1:26:57] of wisdom and Revelation that the eyes
[1:27:00] of your understanding be enlightened
[1:27:02] that you may know what is the hope of
[1:27:05] his calling and what the riches of the
[1:27:08] glory of his inheritance is in the
[1:27:10] Saints and what is the exceeding
[1:27:12] greatness of his power to usward who
[1:27:15] believe according to the working of his
[1:27:17] mighty
[1:27:20] is this all right
[1:27:23] so as the Sheep of God
[1:27:27] we're able
[1:27:29] to look through the eye of God by the
[1:27:30] prophet of Malachi 4 that seventh angel
[1:27:35] First Corinthians 2 and 9 but as it is
[1:27:37] written
[1:27:38] I
[1:27:40] I hath not seen
[1:27:42] nor ear has heard
[1:27:44] neither has it entered into the heart of
[1:27:46] man the things listen I'm still talking
[1:27:49] about the paths of righteous I actually
[1:27:50] hadn't left it yet
[1:27:53] the things
[1:27:54] that God has restored or has has uh
[1:27:58] prepared for them that love him
[1:28:02] but everybody say but aren't you glad
[1:28:05] for that changes the scene right there
[1:28:07] it changes from hopeless to now hope it
[1:28:10] changes from impossible now to possible
[1:28:13] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[1:28:18] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[1:28:21] things yea the Deep things of God them
[1:28:24] things that have been hidden for ages
[1:28:26] and ages before the foundation of the
[1:28:29] world has now been revealed by the eye
[1:28:32] of God can you say Amen now we that's
[1:28:35] that's that's important amen see
[1:28:38] Deuteronomy now listen to this one
[1:28:40] Deuteronomy 29 and 29 the secret things

[1:28:45] belonging to the Lord Our God but those
[1:28:48] things which are revealed belong to us

[1:29:12] belong to us not only us but to our
[1:29:16] children forever

[1:29:51] home of the Earthly bride and the
[1:29:53] Heavenly bridegroom that belongs to us
[1:29:57] these things that the prophet revealed
[1:29:59] amen is is a revelation that because God
[1:30:03] gave them to you
[1:30:05] adoption belongs to us the manifestation
[1:30:09] of God belongs the sons of God belong to
[1:30:11] us amen that which is beyond the curtain
[1:30:14] of time belongs to us not just the
[1:30:17] Earthly things amen but that which is an
[1:30:19] eternal things a man belongs to us God

[1:30:30] it belongs to us and our children
[1:30:32] forever
[1:30:33] can you say that with me it belongs to
[1:30:35] us
[1:30:36] and our children forever
[1:30:39] how you going how's it going to do it I
[1:30:40] don't know I I ain't no I ain't no
[1:30:43] whatever I I can't tell you how it's
[1:30:45] going to be done it'll be done
[1:30:47] it belongs to us
[1:30:49] can you say man
[1:30:51] see looking through the eye of God now
[1:30:53] we see we know we understand that's the
[1:30:58] key we see we know we understand the
[1:31:03] things that belong to us or that aren't
[1:31:06] ordained for us see when they come into
[1:31:10] the promised land hey man they just
[1:31:12] didn't go around say no I wonder if
[1:31:13] that's mine I wonder what this is I
[1:31:15] wonder no it all belonged to them
[1:31:16] everywhere they look every ground inch
[1:31:19] of ground that they stepped on it was
[1:31:20] mine it was theirs they didn't have to
[1:31:23] guess they didn't have to bargain they
[1:31:25] didn't have to go around amen having a
[1:31:27] survey of the land to see what what part
[1:31:29] is theirs and all of that they just knew
[1:31:31] they were in now in the promised land
[1:31:33] they had to win to moab's land and they
[1:31:36] couldn't possess that they went through
[1:31:38] Esau's land and they couldn't possess
[1:31:40] that amen the church has gone through
[1:31:42] seven ages and there's nothing that we
[1:31:44] could have possessed but now's the day
[1:31:46] now is the time that every promise in
[1:31:49] the book is mine can you say man amen
[1:31:53] the sixth Church age couldn't lay claim
[1:31:55] to the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:31:58] but you're that people that can lay
[1:32:00] claim to it
[1:32:04] see we know
[1:32:06] we see we understand
[1:32:08] the things that's been ordained for us
[1:32:11] because God has led us by his eye
[1:32:16] isn't that wonderful
[1:32:18] God's lettuce he's stay true brother
[1:32:20] Bill
[1:32:21] he stayed true to his word
[1:32:24] hey amen
[1:32:28] hey
[1:32:30] brother Brown said God's eye
[1:32:33] reflects his will
[1:32:36] his spirit
[1:32:37] and his word
[1:32:40] see so looking through the eye of God
[1:32:42] now if you're looking through the eye
[1:32:43] God what you're going to see is God's
[1:32:44] will for you
[1:32:45] your spirit
[1:32:47] in you working for you
[1:32:50] 'll see his word
[1:32:52] you'll see the promises
[1:32:54] ain't that right couldn't see it through
[1:32:56] a theologian
[1:32:57] nope nope no they can't give you
[1:32:59] promises
[1:33:00] yeah that's true
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] now so then then we realize now that
[1:33:07] Deuteronomy 28 29 does not apply to us
[1:33:11] for God says here thou shall grope at
[1:33:13] Noonday as the blind groupeth in the
[1:33:15] Darkness
[1:33:16] and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways
[1:33:19] and that shall be openly oppressed and
[1:33:21] spoiled forever and no man shall save
[1:33:24] thee
[1:33:25] oh I'm so glad I'm not in that scripture
[1:33:31] but we are in it identified in what
[1:33:33] David said he leadeth me
[1:33:35] in the paths of righteousness
[1:33:38] do you realize the prophet said the
[1:33:40] beginning of righteousness is God's
[1:33:43] truth revealed
[1:33:45] that's the beginning
[1:33:47] of righteousness
[1:33:49] the path opens up for you
[1:33:51] when God begins to reveal the truth
[1:33:55] he begins to reveal the promises
[1:33:58] he begins to reveal can you say Amen oh
[1:34:01] see the word of God was revealed to
[1:34:04] Jesus
[1:34:05] he knew what he was sent to do he knew
[1:34:08] that he was to fulfill the scriptures
[1:34:11] he said to John it's becoming to us to
[1:34:14] fulfill all righteousness see it's up to
[1:34:17] us brother Brown said it's up to us to
[1:34:20] fulfill all righteousness can you say
[1:34:23] Amen now see what is righteousness it's
[1:34:25] his word
[1:34:27] righteousness every promise that has
[1:34:29] been laying here that's his
[1:34:31] righteousness amen and now the the
[1:34:34] revealed word the revealed truth has
[1:34:36] opened up the paths of righteousness can
[1:34:39] you say Amen that you could walk in them
[1:34:42] and what what it means is that now
[1:34:44] you're walking and fulfilling the
[1:34:46] promises
[1:34:48] you're not walking the Broadway God has
[1:34:52] showed you this way and and it's now
[1:34:54] become a personal revelation it's become
[1:34:56] a personal book every promise now
[1:34:58] becomes personal uh personal it's mine
[1:35:01] healing is mine Deliverance is mine
[1:35:03] whatever I have need of he is my Jehovah
[1:35:06] Jireh he is my Jehovah Shalom he is my
[1:35:09] amen my banner he is my victory
[1:35:13] it's mine
[1:35:20] so brother Branham says what is
[1:35:22] righteousness his word
[1:35:24] and it has to be fulfilled
[1:35:27] can you say man
[1:35:29] so these these Paths of righteousness
[1:35:31] have been are foretold in the scriptures
[1:35:36] see the word of God is not just being
[1:35:38] made up as we go along
[1:35:40] nope it's been these paths have been
[1:35:43] forordained
[1:35:45] before the foundation of the world we've
[1:35:48] read these scriptures we know them but
[1:35:49] we find comfort in them Romans 8 30
[1:35:51] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[1:35:54] he also called and whom he called then
[1:35:56] he also justified in whom he justified
[1:35:58] then he also glorified ain't that right
[1:36:01] it's already done it's a subtle thing oh
[1:36:04] my we didn't know it but it had to be
[1:36:06] revealed can you say man now we're
[1:36:08] walking the past now we know what we're
[1:36:10] walking what kind of paths we're really
[1:36:12] walking can you say man it's something
[1:36:14] that's already been declared it's
[1:36:16] something that's already been finished
[1:36:17] it's something that's already been
[1:36:19] predestinated for me to walk
[1:36:21] [Applause]
[1:36:23] listen uh uh we read it last Wednesday I
[1:36:26] believe Ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:36:28] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[1:36:32] good works ain't that right which God
[1:36:35] hath before ordained that we should walk
[1:36:38] in them
[1:36:39] ain't that right so it's already been
[1:36:42] set in motion amen and there is a people
[1:36:44] on Earth who are predestinated to
[1:36:47] fulfill it remember the land was
[1:36:49] predestinated to a certain people and
[1:36:51] there was a certain people that was
[1:36:53] predestinated to walk into that land and
[1:36:55] there was not one that was missing there
[1:36:57] was not one that God had already
[1:36:58] foreordained a man that would walk in
[1:37:01] that land that was already there oh
[1:37:04] church I mean I'm so glad that God saved
[1:37:06] me for this last stage
[1:37:08] you're not a coincidence God foresaw you
[1:37:11] in this age you would be the people to
[1:37:14] take the land you would be the people
[1:37:15] that God would send a Prophet by through
[1:37:18] his eye and would lead us into the
[1:37:19] promised land and show us every promise
[1:37:23] that belongs to us
[1:37:26] the paths of righteousness
[1:37:29] we didn't know anything about it
[1:37:32] until a prophet came along
[1:37:35] and looked through the eye of God
[1:37:38] notice what he saw
[1:37:40] a week ago and more and more on to what
[1:37:42] he saw but
[1:37:44] he said there that morning
[1:37:50] he's talking about he's telling the
[1:37:51] people he's talking about the going
[1:37:53] beyond the curtain of time
[1:37:55] and he said there that morning the
[1:37:57] quickening power come and he let me look
[1:37:59] over the curtain
[1:38:01] and I saw
[1:38:03] all of you there
[1:38:06] I just don't believe that he's just
[1:38:07] talking about that that group that was
[1:38:09] sitting there
[1:38:11] I believe he saw every predestinated
[1:38:14] believer
[1:38:16] so I'm going to just lay claim I believe
[1:38:17] he saw Sean Martin
[1:38:20] can you say men why he was looking
[1:38:22] through a different lens
[1:38:24] looking through a different eye
[1:38:26] and he said I saw you there
[1:38:28] can you say amen he was looking through
[1:38:31] the eye of God Paul being a prophet
[1:38:33] looked and Saul that we have already a
[1:38:35] body waiting for us when we leave this
[1:38:37] Earthly uh body and he said we have one
[1:38:41] waiting the prophet said we already have
[1:38:43] one it's there see and see we we find
[1:38:47] amen how could Paul say that because he
[1:38:49] was looking through the eye of God
[1:38:51] now we can say that's nothing but the
[1:38:55] truth
[1:38:57] are you with me now why because we're
[1:39:00] looking through the eye of God
[1:39:04] we're seeing ourselves
[1:39:07] you with me if John could see himself
[1:39:10] from the book when the book opened then
[1:39:12] John represented us now church either
[1:39:15] the book is closed or it's not
[1:39:17] but it's open
[1:39:20] ain't that right the book is open so
[1:39:22] then that means that if if John typed us
[1:39:25] as the bride then we can look at the
[1:39:28] book and see ourselves
[1:39:30] all right
[1:39:32] come on now
[1:39:35] brother Branham in looking through the
[1:39:36] eye of God said if God when I was an
[1:39:39] alien from him so loved me till he
[1:39:41] stooped down to get me and pick me up
[1:39:44] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:39:45] to use me
[1:39:47] he's got a purpose in doing so he's seen
[1:39:49] something in me seen something in you he
[1:39:51] hadn't he had a reason to save you look
[1:39:53] at the people that's unsaved today look
[1:39:55] at the millions he could have took
[1:39:57] beside you but he took you
[1:39:59] and no one can take your place
[1:40:03] now now how can he say that because he's
[1:40:05] looking through the eye of God
[1:40:08] no one can take your place
[1:40:11] you're in God's economy no one can do it
[1:40:14] that's his love to you
[1:40:16] see it's already done so then as the
[1:40:19] prophet would tell us that takes all the
[1:40:21] fear away from us
[1:40:23] do you believe that because when God
[1:40:25] makes a decree there's nothing that's
[1:40:28] going to stop it
[1:40:30] isn't that wonderful
[1:40:32] when God makes a decree there's nothing
[1:40:35] going to stop it now I'm getting ready
[1:40:38] to close but God said to Jeremiah in
[1:40:40] Jeremiah 1 4 before I formed Thee I knew
[1:40:43] thee before I formed thee in the belly I
[1:40:46] knew thee and before thou camest forth
[1:40:48] out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[1:40:51] ordained thee a prophet before uh unto
[1:40:55] the Nations ain't that right brother
[1:40:57] Brown said see what what did Jeremiah
[1:40:59] have to do with that nothing God did it
[1:41:02] so it's God's Sovereign Grace that he
[1:41:04] does things and God has a church that's
[1:41:07] going to appear without spot or wrinkle
[1:41:09] he's already said it
[1:41:12] do you believe that he's already said it
[1:41:16] and he's not guessing as to who's going
[1:41:18] to be there he's already knows who's
[1:41:20] going to be there and I believe I'm
[1:41:21] looking at him
[1:41:25] that church he said is for ordained
[1:41:30] do you believe it
[1:41:32] oh isn't the Lord good
[1:41:35] amen amen I got a lot more but I'm gonna
[1:41:38] just I'm not going to close I know it's
[1:41:39] a Wednesday night
[1:41:41] but if the musicians will come but I
[1:41:44] want you to notice what Israel or God
[1:41:46] tells Israel as a nation
[1:41:48] there in Isaiah 41 and 8.
[1:41:55] but thou is alert my servant
[1:41:58] Jacob whom I have chosen the Seed of
[1:42:01] Abraham my friend
[1:42:03] thou whom I have taken from the ends of
[1:42:05] the Earth and called thee from the chief
[1:42:07] men thereof and said unto thee Thou Art
[1:42:10] my servant I have chosen thee and not
[1:42:12] cast thee away
[1:42:13] fear thou not for I am with thee be not
[1:42:17] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[1:42:21] strengthen thee yeah I will help thee
[1:42:23] yea I will uphold thee with the right
[1:42:25] hand of my righteousness or the right
[1:42:28] hand actually means power with the power
[1:42:31] of my word in other words
[1:42:33] see again there in Isaiah 43 and 1. uh
[1:42:37] uh God speaks to Israel but now thus
[1:42:39] saith the Lord that created the old
[1:42:41] Jacob and he that formed the O Israel
[1:42:43] fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[1:42:46] called thee button thy name Thou Art
[1:42:49] mine when thou pass through the waters I
[1:42:52] will be with thee and through the the
[1:42:55] rivers they shall not uh overflow thee
[1:42:59] and when thou walkest through the fire
[1:43:01] Thou shalt not be burned neither shall
[1:43:03] the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the
[1:43:06] Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy
[1:43:09] savior I gave Egypt for thy Ransom
[1:43:12] Ethiopian seba for thee since thou was
[1:43:15] precious in my sight thou has been been
[1:43:18] honorable and I have lovely therefore
[1:43:21] will I give men for thee and people for
[1:43:23] thy life fear not for I am with thee I
[1:43:26] will bring thy seed from the East and
[1:43:28] gather thee from the West now seek God
[1:43:30] now you think of this God now knowing
[1:43:33] he's prophesying amen say I will say to
[1:43:36] the north give up and to the South keep
[1:43:39] not back bring my sons from afar and my
[1:43:42] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[1:43:43] even everyone that is called by my name
[1:43:46] for I have created him for my glory I
[1:43:49] have formed him yea I have made him I
[1:43:53] believe this prophecy applies to both
[1:43:55] spiritual and and and natural people but
[1:43:58] looking at the natural people for nearly
[1:44:01] 2 000 years now Israel as a people have
[1:44:04] been scattered throughout the world
[1:44:06] ain't that right they've been scattered
[1:44:08] throughout the out the world Amen and
[1:44:11] and and there has not been a nation of
[1:44:14] Israel uh for nearly 2 000 years
[1:44:18] amen scattered abroad it looked hopeless
[1:44:21] but there was a promise that God made
[1:44:23] concerning to that natural people that
[1:44:25] no matter how scattered you are see it
[1:44:28] was already ordained it was a path that
[1:44:30] was already fordained God knew that this
[1:44:32] would happen but he said I'm not I'm not
[1:44:34] forsaken thee so when you feel forsaken
[1:44:37] when you feel alone when you feel like I
[1:44:39] forgot you remember this I gave people
[1:44:42] for thy life I gave Egypt for a ransom
[1:44:45] for thee amen I have loved thee amen
[1:44:47] when thou was small amen everything that
[1:44:50] God had toward Israel is still there can
[1:44:53] you say amen amen see and so but today
[1:44:56] we look and there are the Jews now
[1:44:58] they're gathered they're in their
[1:45:00] Homeland amen and so we see that once
[1:45:03] again Israel stands as a nation which
[1:45:07] testifies of this promise that God
[1:45:09] didn't forget the promise God had
[1:45:12] already forordained it to happen but he
[1:45:14] says after time I'm gonna gather thee
[1:45:17] I'll say to to the South I'll say to the
[1:45:19] Lord the East the West give them up and
[1:45:22] they had to give up and there they stand
[1:45:25] as a nation that is a miracle
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:34] then we find there in Revelations that
[1:45:36] God prophesied again
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:42] that there would be a certain number out
[1:45:44] of each tribe
[1:45:46] he's going to seal
[1:45:49] hello
[1:45:53] twelve thousand out of each tribe
[1:45:57] which equals to what 144 000.
[1:46:00] and God's promised that
[1:46:03] but we know as the prophet told us that
[1:46:05] the only way that God could deal with
[1:46:07] him is as a nation
[1:46:09] he deals with us as individuals but as
[1:46:11] to Israel as a nation
[1:46:13] so in order to seal them he had to bring
[1:46:15] him back to their Homeland
[1:46:17] and now they are they're there
[1:46:21] and no doubt that maybe there's some
[1:46:23] stragglings around throughout the
[1:46:25] Nations that
[1:46:26] that through these wars and things that
[1:46:28] are going on that God's bringing them in
[1:46:31] because it's time
[1:46:33] and God's going to keep his promise
[1:46:35] and God knows exactly who he's going to
[1:46:37] seal and I believe that I believe that
[1:46:40] there are people living on the earth of
[1:46:42] Jews that are going to be part of that
[1:46:44] number
[1:46:45] just as much as I believe that there are
[1:46:47] people that are leaving on this Earth
[1:46:49] that'll never taste death that they're
[1:46:50] going to be in a Rapture I just believe
[1:46:52] that that's how close we are
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:58] Say Amen
[1:47:00] so he's always predestinated
[1:47:04] when God speaks it's going to happen
[1:47:08] and this is what these Paths of
[1:47:10] righteousness
[1:47:12] these are ordained paths that God has
[1:47:14] predestined his word
[1:47:16] concerning this Bride for this age
[1:47:20] and it's going to be fulfilled
[1:47:23] he's leading us aren't you glad for that
[1:47:26] I wished I could get into the history of
[1:47:28] it and these things and go more but we
[1:47:31] see that what the church has gone
[1:47:33] through
[1:47:34] through church history
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:38] 66 million Christians
[1:47:41] martyred
[1:47:43] the church lived on
[1:47:46] because there were promises for this day
[1:47:49] that had to be fulfilled
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:52] Satan couldn't kill that seat off
[1:47:55] but here we are glorious
[1:47:57] here we are Triumph
[1:47:59] because we're Guided by his eye
[1:48:02] into these Paths of righteousness
[1:48:05] and all we can say it's been God's grace
[1:48:07] in our lives do you love him
