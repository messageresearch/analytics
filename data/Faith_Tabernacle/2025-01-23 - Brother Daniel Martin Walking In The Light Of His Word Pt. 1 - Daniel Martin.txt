an honor and a privilege to come to your house once again father Lord though it's really cold outside father but Lord You've allowed us to come a building Lord where we've got heat father Lord and Lord I pray Lord we feel your presence already Lord and I pray that you would just walk down the aisles tonight Lord I pray that you would Minister to every heart father Lord Lord I pray that you would help me move myself out of the way Lord I pray that you would just speak through me Lord take this nervousness away father Lord Lord Just Have Your Way tonight is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen do you love the Lord tonight amen the musicians can be dismissed if we could turn to uh John chapter [Music] 8 man I really thank the Lord for heat am man I'm a big baby when it comes to cold anymore I don't like it but John chapter 8 starting uh let's read the 12th verse it says then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life and if we could also turn over to uh um Zechariah Chapter 14 man he says I am the light of the world Amen Zechariah 14:7 it says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that the evening time it shall be light amen you can have your seats tonight amen I've got a real simple thought I um it's a vast subject um and I am not going to uh but maybe just take the very very very teeny tip of it tonight and I'd like to uh study more of it myself but if I would give a title tonight I would like to title it maybe walking in the light of his word and um I'd like to maybe start off with a illustration and and you know a lot of times we uh uh a lot of our hunting friends know that um you know we like to try to go hunting in the mornings and we uh I like to try to get to my to my stand a little before daylight to try not and spook anything and and a lot of times when you're sitting there and waiting for the sun to come up um and as the sun Sly starts to slowly come rise your your eyes will begin to play tricks on you a lot of times and and and and uh you know I'm not going to lie sometimes it can be a little little creepy sitting there in the dark in the woods and uh but sometimes you just begin to wander as the sun comes up you you start to see things and you wonder if that is a deer or or uh that over there looks like a bear or over there looks like someone standing there looking at me you know and and sometimes it can be be a little little little creepy but as the Sun starts to rise and and as the Shadows begin to fade away and and you begin to see the area for what it really is and and and that deer that that you thought was actually a bush and that bear was actually a log and that person that you thought was standing there was only a tree and when the sun begins to shine in its power my my fear begin to flee my my my my Superstition begins to go away because there was something greater than darkness that was in that was there amen and that's the same thing with the word of God when the light of God uh God's word Rises all superstitions all fears denominational ideas and things spread away and it shows it just exactly what it is amen God in the beginning said let there be light and there had to come come forth light amen there didn't come when he said let there be light there didn't come some artificial light or or anything like that but when but but there had to come A True Light and the and the King light and it only comes that that true light only comes by the word of God Amen and God separated the light from darkness in the beginning and the word of God made manifest always separates the light from the darkness amen people can rise up with this people can rise up with that Superstition they can rise up with that fear they can rise up with that idea and and many man's ideas have risen up in this age but when the king light raises up and vindicates its word and proves its light it shuts all other lights out amen and Jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mine be truth amen his word is light amen do you believe that his word is light and when the light of his word begins to shine all superstitions and all man's made ideas just slowly Fade Away amen because his word is superior over all man's words amen now when uh we know that in the beginning God planted his seed upon the Earth and if you go read in the Book of Genesis uh it talks about it there and the Earth was full of darkness and in order for that seed to come forth in order for that seed to have life it needed light amen and it's been the same throughout the ages brother brandom said God has foretold us that what would take place in each age and the only thing he needs is the manifestation of the light of God upon that scripture to make it live for that age and it will do it as long as the light can get to the word amen when that light can get to the word then something's got to uh uh spring forth amen if the word is gerti it'll make it live it's it's a it's a promise for that day Amen brother brandham says you might plant wheat at one time or a grain at another time depending on the season God's word comes in season the law and the grace and so forth as we went down Through the Ages and each time it's lit up by the manifestation of the light spreading forth the life that's in the seed amen and so we find out that the Sun that we are now enjoying the Sun that when when the Su in when God said let there be light that that sun that we we go outside and we we we accept its its raise and we enjoy its Sunshine is the manifestation of God's word spoken in Genesis amen God spoke and said let there be light and anytime God says Let There be something has to come forth amen and and if God had said let there be light and and a rabbit came forth forth then God's word would be a lie amen but God's word cannot lie and when God said let there be light something had to take place Darkness had to fade away because light had to come forth amen but whatever God spoke had to come according to his word amen and we realize that God's light of the day is his sign the s o n amen God's light for this day is his son in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God and the full manifestation of God's word was made known through his son the s o n Jesus Christ amen now we can be there can be no life outside of light brother brandham says a natural or spiritual life produ or light produces life amen can you say that with me light produces life amen now you take a plant if you keep it in a dark room or or a place where it doesn't get much sun eventually it's going to die amen that that uh uh that sun that that that light amen that light produces the life and it's the same thing with the human body if your body doesn't get enough sunlight it would lead to a number of health issues amen uh uh uh when if your body doesn't get that light amen [Music] we lost our sound guy amen amen so so if your body doesn't get enough sunlight it would lead to a number of issues health issues and only light can come by the word of God Amen God's word is the light when it's manifest manifested amen just mute [Music] the amen do you love the Lord amen only light can come by the word of God God's word is the light when it's manifested and each AE God has lotted so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to manifest his word amen to manifest that word Luther had a portion and then the people denominated it amen Wesley had a portion of light for his age and then it went off and they denominated and they failed to get back to the word and then he come down to the age that we're in now where God said that I will restore all that was lost amen and all that he was he poured into the church manifesting himself in his people amen not just a portion but all that God was he poured in this last day amen when he sends his light and makes it known to the people the world rejects it amen if you go look through all out the Bible throughout the ages anytime God sends forth his light there's always a people that will reject that light amen and the first church was cut down through Ro Roman paganism and but in the evening time amen that same light not a different light but it was that same light uh that was brought forth through the first church and was cut down is the same light that has come in this evening time Amen to restore the whole word of God the full manifestation of Christ in his church amen the world rejected it the world calls it crazy the the world calls it make belief but it's life to the believer amen this this this light in this day is life to the believer and God has an elected little group who is walking in the light of his word amen now Jesus had been prophesied for thousands of years or for 4,000 years that he would come as Messiah and when he came he manifest manifested every promise of Messiah but yet the people of the world the churches and so forth know nothing about him because they got in some other thing that kept them away from knowing this brother brandham says if you take a man who was meant to dwell under the natural Sun excuse me and he went and put himself into a basement and closed all the blinds and blocked every ray of light and just refused to recognize that the sun is shining he denied denies its lifegiving resources he denies the very light that would show him where he is going he denies the very light that shows him where he come from amen and it's the same thing today there are many people who has refus to recognize that the so wind is shining today amen they've locked themselves up in man's ideas they've locked themselves up in man's Creeds they've locked themselves up in some denominational idea and the and there are traditions and they are denying the power thereof amen now we all know that Jesus lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible that was prophesied of him a virgin shall conceive and she did amen his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God was prophesied of him happened when he come on the earth and the World missed it oh my that's the saddest part the world missed it and why the people could not see that was because they were living in a glare of another light amen they were living in the glare of another day amen a glare is a false light and and that's what's the matter with the world today they are trying to live in a glare of light that Shin in another day amen and you can't live under this evening light you can't live under the life for this this day H and Luther's day you can't you can't be living under the evening light and still live under Luther's day and Wesley's day you can't H you have to live under the light that was meant for this day for this hour amen I remember as a kid we would we would travel to Arizona to go see my grandparents and and I remember when when I was real little Arizona on the roads it would become so hot and and that it would cause them Gage and I would ask Dad when we going down the road go is that water right there in the middle of the road man that it looks like a huge just a pond of water in the road and he would say no son that's just a mirage and Mirage is a false conception of the son and when you get there it has it hasn't produced a thing but something false and brother bam says and you can't walk in the glare of the sun because it's a mirage always showing you something that that isn't there amen and when people try to tell you that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever they're living under a mirage they're living under another light amen his word says He is the same yesterday today and forever amen walk in the light of his word and the world is living under a mirage of just joining Church a mirage of saying some Creed there there is nothing there living under a mirage of justification they're living under a mirage of sanctification but when you start living under the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it will shine its warming rise of the Holy Ghost amen upon you amen it will make you a new creation oh my amen in Christ Jesus don't walk in some glare of another age amen that's what the world does the world is walking in in a glare of another age am man now the glare was all right in in the other age it was all right for them Christ was the uh uh the scriptural light for that day he was the light he he wasn't the light until he come on the earth to vindicate the promised word Amen brother BR says you know he said there John was a bright and Shining Light and you love to walk in his light for a season amen and Jesus said that John had been prophesied by Isaiah for 72 years before the birth that a voice of one would be crying in the wilderness and then also Malachi the last of the prophets 400 years before his coming in the third chapter of Malachi he says behold I will send my messenger before my face to prepare the way and here was John on the earth making that written word live amen and he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness and he was also preparing the way for the Messiah amen before the Messiah and Jesus said you love to walk in his light because because he was that light that bright and Shining Light and John said now I must decrease I must decrease and my light must go out I have served my time that prophesied of me now hear ye him he is the one follow him he is the light of the world Amen now the Jews thought they were worshiping in the True Light they thought they were worshiping the same God that they turned down the very one that they thought that they were worshiping they were crucifying amen they were making fun of the very God they were mocking and made him a laughing stock they were crucified uh God the very God that brought them amen H that thought they were worshiping now we know that something is getting ready to take place in the end time do you believe that we know that that that we're here at the end time and we see that what the world is doing and we see the signs of the end time and it's become later than we think amen we're coming to the end but the hour is at hand when the light is shining the gospel light is shining its power of resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he laed that for this day amen the world can't accept it but God has a a people who has accepted that amen and he He he'll get his message over because he always done it he will always do it God will always have a people who will get his message across the earth oh my and today people are thinking that they're walking in the light but they're walking in the glare of a light amen they follow traditions of their father they F the first thing you know they rejected the very light that they claim to be worshiping amen and it doesn't matter how many years your grandpa has been preaching if it doesn't line up with the word then it is false Amen brother bham says Christ Works thly Vindicated uh who he was he has been thly Vindicated by the word and by the works that he was doing but none of them wanted to believe it he proved his light was the word the word said search the scriptures but the Traditions they were living in of was a glare of another age they said Moses We Believe well we don't know where you've come from where did you get your education what what can you prove that you're this his Works testified who he was they were reading the scriptures but they couldn't see it my Works identify me amen the Pharisees the Sadducees they all they had got the world so gummed up like it did in all the ages they could not see the real light and it put their eyes out amen they were used to walking in the glare the next day it'll be this the next day it'll be that and we'll join this and we'll join that but it's a false Mirage it's only a mirage amen we can't live by yesterday's light yesterday light yesterday's light is history now we know nothing about it you can't get warmed by the sign that shines yesterday and that's what's the matter with the church today that the that's what's the matter with the people they're trying to live by what happened yesterday amen you can't get warned by a painted fire amen it has no heat in it yesterday's son has no heat in it amen Jesus Christ is just as real today as he ever was amen his power is living in his presence his living presence is just as real as it ever was today amen low a little while on the won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world and the works that I do shall you do also even greater this shall you do because I go to my father amen the great promises today amen the world is as as blind as they can be amen there's a people who is walking under the light of the world of the word amen not a mirage amen we're not walking on under a mirage we're not walking under a light of yesterday amen yesterday is history but we are walking under the present light amen that was sent for this day the True Light for this hour amen the natural sunlight is sent to the Earth to ripen the grain for the advancing Harvest amen there is time in a season to plant the seed and there is a time in a season for that seed to be ripened amen I'm sure we've all planted something at some point so we know that what I'm talking about you can't go and plant corn in the middle of November because it is not the time nor the season for the corn to be planted in November amen sure the the seed you can put the seed in the ground and sure the sun shines down on that seed but it is not to season it won't rip it because the season isn't ready amen and when you plant the seed and it's due season when you begin to plant that that corn when it when it's supposed to be planted then you can watch that seed take its root amen and bring forth uh fruit amen and so must God's wheat and grain ripen in the season it's in amen the grain has to mature with the light but the thing of it today brother Bram says the church grain doesn't want to mature oh my it wants to stay like it was back in ausa Street it wants to stay back in the healing Revival they they they they seen what it what what happened over there and they're fine with that they're relaxed with that amen that's what they want they want to bring the life from Luther's day and China in this day they want to bring the light from Wesley's day and shine it in this day they were all right they were the light of that hour but this is another hour this is another day amen and we have another light am amen shine and this is the advancement of the Gospel amen and it's come to its maturity do you believe that amen and it can't come to its maturity under Luther's Luther's light it can't come under its maturity under Pentecostal light amen it can't come under what Luther said and and what Wesley said and what the rest of them says we're living in the light that's predicted for this day amen we're in the seventh Church age not the Third not the fourth we're in the seventh Church age amen the grain should be able to receive it if it doesn't it falls and it means nothing to it the grain is matured when the light if it goes ahead with the light amen but you see today we find people like they like what it was in that day and they're trying to live back in that glare amen the church should ripen as the wheat ripens amen and the church should bring forth the bread of each age that Jesus Christ commanded man shall live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Amen not just part of God's word not just the portion of the word but every word of God Amen every age amen the bread that we need is in the Bible brother Bram says the bread that we need is in the book and it's the complete revelation of God's plan it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ anden we can't add anything to his word we can't take anything away from his word and if you do then your name is being blotted out of the book of life amen amen we've got to preach it just the way that the word says amen we've got to sing it the way that the word says and God will manifest it amen every promise that he promised he will manifest it just the same we're not supposed to take or just leave it the way it is and God will take care of the rest amen Luther turned on the light for his age brother Bram says Luther turned on the light for his age and when the light moved on they stayed there come on and they built an organization and they said oh but this is the light amen brother Bram says amen and Wesley did the same thing Wesley turned on his light amen and when the light moved on they stayed there and they organized amen and said oh but this is the light and brother brandham says that then come along the Pentecostals and show them up that God still sends down the baptism of the Holy Ghost he still brings down his power of healing which they've denied what do they do walked right away from it then because it was another light and as the light moved on the Pentecostals decided they they wanted to stay instead of moving on with the light amen and they built an organization amen and said but we have the light and God has walked away from it and it's bringing forth a bride and elect out of that group oh my move with the light walk in the light of his word amise amen we are in bright time this is bright time this is selecting time do you believe that all that the caterpillar left said Joel in 2:28 all that the caterpillar left the pmer worm eating and all the pmer wor left the locust did eat and then when they did that uh then what did they do after the reformers over the light begin to dim out instead of walking on and further into the light they organized it amen the Catholic Church rejected Luther Right Wesley rejected Luther and so also uh uh the Pentecostal rejected Wesley and the Holy Spirit today has rejected the Pentecostals but there came another messenger Amen to point us not to gifts to not point us to speaking in tongues amen but Jesus Christ manifested in the light of his word amen God sent another messenger for our day to point us to Jesus Christ amen Let's Open the Eyes of our understanding amen and let's see that the day let's see that the day that we're living in amen the light has come amen it's bright time it's going home time this is the final day amen Lord the Bible said in Malachi 4 he would send forth and restore again on original faith that was with the people amen he promised it amen God promised God made a promise amen and he sent his word and the and the prophets came because the word came to the prophets and they had the word and they made it live amen and God promised to do it again in these last days what God has promised that he will do to turn on a light that can vindicate the pro PR scriptures of today Jesus said as it is written in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and there is lots down there in the world down there in Sodom with all the sin lukewarm there is a messenger down there preaching to them to him too then there is Abraham's group The elected the pull out the one with the promise waiting truly for the n oh my L was looking for a son also but not in the form that Abraham was looking for what happened God came down and manifested himself in flesh and declared that he was the word amen for the word is sharper and more powerful than to any two wedges Sword and the discerner of thoughts that's and the discerner of thoughts that's in the heart Jesus said so shall it be again at the coming of the son of man and we are here we are here amen God came down a m manifested himself in flesh again oh my to declare that he is the same yesterday today and forever oh my amen I thank God for what happened back there amen it had to come and I thank God for it but what about today what about today don't look to a mirage stay under the True Light oh my it's a new age it's new Mana amen Christ amen Christ was the tree of life that was in the Garden of Eden amen yesterday's man is contaminated amen it's no good amen today is the new Mana amen and they said brother B says they cut him down and hung him on a Roman Tree to make fun of him what did he do God raised him up in the Third Day from the dead and today there is a brid tree it started back there at the beginning way back at the day of Pentecost then what did they do they just kept organizing and God keeps cutting off the branches they organized Lutheran cut off the branches Wesley cut off the branches Pentecost cut off the branches the limb the limbs are withered and dried up and they'll be taking taking them from the tree so that the fruit can bear itself right on top of the tree amen but God is going to have a bride tree amen all that the cankerworm is eaten and all that the caterpillar has eaten he said I will restore sayeth the Lord amen all that was lost throughout the ages has now been restored in these last days amen God said he would have a people for his name's sake and here we are tonight amen making that word live because we have become one with Christ amen the Lord Brother brandham says like my hand here in a shadow it's a shadow only darker as my hand become becomes one it's a negative here amen if you you could see the shadow here amen and it's a negative here and a positive here as a negative and positive it gets denser darker darker and darker and finally it collaps together together and the negative and the positive become one that's when the church in Christ unites together as a bride with the same spirit that was in him and and will be upon her when the church comes from justification and sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost into the last days and holding her down for the coming of the Lord do you see it you know what I mean it's Christ now taking the racks of yesterday the Lutheran the Methodist the Presbyterian and so forth and he's putting them through a process what kind of a process a process of the Holy Spirit what they had plus making it to he he is uh pressing his own image when the church and the Christ becomes one we're in Union with him Amen brother brandham tells the story of the policemen and the and the Welsh Revival amen we all know that and and some great men here in the nation uh brother bam says so they would go over and and see the wal Revival and what would be taking place and they went went over and find out they wanted to find out which building it was held in so they went out they got to Wells they looked around begin to ask where the building was then they seen a little happy officer amen he was just sitting there and he was just dangling his his his little uh billy club and and he's got his little old hat on and and he was sitting there and and these men walked up to him and said sir can you tell me what building the wst Revival is held in and he says yes sir I am it I am the Revival Amen brother Bram says why he was shedding forth the joy and the light of the Welsh Revival within him he was so filled with the Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh Revival amen as we Believers amen oh my we as Believers uh should be so full of Christ that be we become one with Christ amen when people ask us where is the god of today where is Jesus Christ of today amen you're not pointing them to a mirage a man's made ideas but you can point them to the True Light of the hour amen walk in the light of the message oh my the world is growing darker and darker but fear not there shall be light in the evening time you are she oh my Psalms 119 105 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path if the musicians will come and as long as we're walking in the light we can't be subject to Darkness this as long as you're walking in God's light you can't be subject to Darkness for Darkness has no dominion over light oh my you come in this room with the light off and it's dark and you can't see your way through and you're walking through and you're tripping over everything but when someone can come over here and they can flip on the light amen then Darkness has to fade away amen because light has taken its place oh my walk in the light of his word and I believe there is a people here tonight who can say that we are walking in the light of his word amen and darkness has no dominion over us oh my walk in the light of his word amen do you love the Lord amen song Walk In The Light such a beauty for life it comes where the Dew drops of Mercy our bride oh shine all around us by day in by tonight for it's Jesus the light of the world can we sing it again oh we walk in the light oh such a beatiful light oh just come where the DW drops of Mercy are bright

unto the Lord we will walk in the light are you glad to walk in the light amen becoming the light becoming the reflection of the light oh so thankful Lord shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world as they just play softly we thankful for the sermon tonight and I can't thank the Lord enough for the light that we have been given and that he's made us a reflector of that that light and because we could be reflecting something else we could be wrapped up in the the times and you know in in what the world is thinking to be a golden age and you know we're looking forward to a golden age but it's not coming from a political regime it's it's a golden age where I think brother Amos was put it on our ministers Chad of you know he's talking how that the inauguration uh reminded him of the day that we will Crown Christ King of Kings and and you know that is so true you know our golden age is coming and there is a golden age that is coming and uh this is just a mirage this is just something that seems to be good that I promise you it's it's not amen the world is falling apart everything is crumbling around us and nothing will be rebuilt back it can't be but there is a golden age and that's what we're reflecting the light has come amen that we could reflect such a kingdom as that and I'm I'm so glad for that church this world is not our home amen we're just passing through amen but if God had not sent the light where would we be today we'd be walking in darkness we would not be walking without understanding but not only that we would be reflecting the age of the This Modern Age but but we're not part of that and I'm so glad for that thank God for a prophet thank God for the Revelation thank God for [Music] predestinacion tonight and appreciate uh brother Daniel studying and laboring there and we just pray that God just continues to uh give him uh greater understanding and revelation of the message and I think we all need that amen I want more of that as well and that God just gives us a greater understanding not knowledge you know what I mean we can have knowledge but an understanding I think any any understanding that God will give us it'll be more seeing ourselves in in the message and part of this and what God is doing and that we're part of a kingdom that cannot be shaken can you say amen amen well we love you and there is a song and it's a little it's a kind of a choppy one a fast one or whatever you want to call it and uh simple course but we're going to try it we'll walk in the light will walk in the light will walk in

and appreciate everyone that was able to come and we want to remember those that are sick and weren't able to make it this evening and uh also uh this coming Sunday uh we'll be having a church dinner after the service and uh so we look forward to a time of Fellowship and uh just keep that in mind uh we've got our meeting uh coming up here in a uh a couple months already and uh so looking forward to that and uh going to try to have a meeting um and and I'll send out a text for those that are uh kind of a head of things uh leading in their department and uh so we can and kind of discuss these things um uh the upcoming meeting and so we're going to be nice to be able to do it um this Sunday if we can uh but if it's not going to work out then we can do it planned for next Sunday but we need to start having U kind of getting together and getting things uh planned out figured out and um and also I just pray for some reason uh Camp Christie has um uh is allowing or allowing someone to use the camp right before our meeting and um or they're working out a deal with someone which means we can't set up the tent uh they don't want us setting up a tent until a week before for the meeting and um I don't know you know we're going to talk and find out if they're trying to push us out or what I don't know but um just asking y'all to pray that uh we can we can have availability uh we usually set up the tent at least two weeks or a little bit before that uh so we can have plenty of time being a small Church um and we're putting on such a big meeting we we need time and uh to be able to do everything and why they done that I don't know uh but the Lord knows and so we just we just need to pray and ask God to make a way where we can and um uh be able to set up uh uh the way we normally do and it just be a real help for us and so so uh anyways I'll keep you updated on that but um um again God bless you uh stay warm and um keep everyone in your prayer one another and um uh keep brother Matthew in prayer I know you know him being on the road and and doing the job that he does we certainly appreciate his labors and his effort to keep keep us safe and I know he needs our extra prayer amen so appreciate brother Matthew and appreciate all of you all very much and so God bless you and uh may we just bow our heads in a word of prayer father we're so thankful
