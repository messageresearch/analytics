[38:45] Glory we pray in Jesus name amen and
[38:50] amen and God bless you if you have your
[38:53] Bibles tonight we just like to look in
[38:54] the book of Ephesians uh the first
[38:57] chapter and we want to look in the ninth
[39:00] and the 10th verse man it's good to have
[39:03] brother Isaac with us tonight he drove
[39:06] us all the way down and amen he got that
[39:09] wife and little baby at home but he come
[39:11] to be a part of the services and we
[39:13] appreciate him driving us over and being
[39:16] a part
[39:17] amen Ephesians chapter
[39:20] 1 and verse 9 and verse
[39:23] 10 now having made known unto us us the
[39:28] mystery of his
[39:30] will according to his good pleasure
[39:33] which he hath purposed in
[39:36] himself that in the dispensation now
[39:40] that word dispensation you could use a
[39:42] different word that to it's it's
[39:44] actually the translation in the Greek
[39:46] would be
[39:48] Administration so if you say
[39:49] dispensation is like if you have a big
[39:52] tub of soap you know you got a big five
[39:53] gallon bucket of soap you want to put it
[39:55] in the put it in the bathro bathroom you
[39:56] don't put five gallon in the bathroom
[39:58] you put it in a dispenser so that's the
[40:01] dispensation or the way that something
[40:04] is dispensed he said that in the
[40:06] dispensation of the fullness of times
[40:09] that he might gather together in one all
[40:12] things in
[40:13] Christ both which are in heaven and
[40:17] which are on earth even in
[40:21] him amen we ask the Lord to bless his
[40:23] word you could be seated tonight uh I
[40:26] want to if I can just speak to you from
[40:29] these scriptures for a little bit here
[40:31] tonight and I want to take here from
[40:33] this topic amen last night speaking
[40:36] about he has come as the rain and I want
[40:38] to speak to you a little bit tonight on
[40:40] this he has come to reveal the mystery
[40:43] of his will he has come to reveal the
[40:47] mystery of his will amen God don't do
[40:50] anything without a purpose right so if
[40:52] he's so if he's coming in this age we're
[40:55] living in the there's a purpose behind
[40:57] his coming amen and I I want to uh maybe
[41:00] on the the front of this just read you
[41:03] something I think is very powerful it's
[41:04] a bit of a it's a bit of a uh just a uh
[41:08] a definition of the word mystery having
[41:10] made known the mystery of something amen
[41:13] making known unto us the mystery secret
[41:15] of his will his plan or of his purpose
[41:18] that is in accordance with his good
[41:21] pleasure his merciful intention which he
[41:24] previous purposed and set forth in him
[41:26] planned for the maturity of the times
[41:29] and the climax of the ages to unify all
[41:31] things and to head them up and
[41:33] consummate them in Christ both things in
[41:35] heaven and in Earth now this this word
[41:38] mystery here is the word Mysterion which
[41:42] means literally something into which one
[41:44] must be initiated before it is fully
[41:47] known the word mui is the word initiate
[41:50] or to instruct and that anything which
[41:54] is concealed or hidden we commonly use
[41:57] the word to denote that which is above
[41:59] our comprehension or that that's
[42:02] unintelligible but this is never the
[42:04] meaning of the word in the New Testament
[42:07] it means there is some Doctrine or some
[42:10] fact which has been concealed or which
[42:13] has not been before fully revealed or
[42:16] has been set forth only by figures and
[42:19] symbols then the doctrine is made known
[42:22] it may be as clear and plain as any
[42:25] other so it's something that has been
[42:27] laying in Scripture that has been hid
[42:30] but it's been laying there maybe in
[42:31] types like Ruth and Tamar and it's been
[42:34] laying there in all kinds of types and
[42:36] you remember brother Bram said the seven
[42:37] seal was in every type that was in the
[42:39] scripture but it was actually laying
[42:41] there now it was hid from the eyes and
[42:43] it was unknown but then when it's
[42:45] revealed it's as easily understood as
[42:48] any other Doctrine in the scripture
[42:51] because then it's revealed you have the
[42:53] answer to it now we find out the prophet
[42:55] tells us something in the adoption uh
[42:58] part part four brother R will say see
[43:01] there's there's something tied to this
[43:02] in the mystery and I want to give you
[43:04] something he says here he said there's
[43:06] three things in this mystery he said
[43:08] there will be the mystery of his coming
[43:10] amen number one the mystery of his
[43:12] coming and then there will be the
[43:14] mystery of his will and then the mystery
[43:16] of us sitting together now here's the
[43:18] beautiful thing according to Revelations
[43:20] the 10th chapter that when the seventh
[43:23] angel begins to sound the mystery of God
[43:26] would be finished so tonight we're not
[43:28] speaking amen of it in a mystery form
[43:31] we're speaking of it in a plain form yet
[43:34] we call it a mystery but it's no longer
[43:37] hid from the church and and and and any
[43:40] hillbilly preacher could could preach it
[43:42] plainly at this point because the
[43:45] prophet has made it clear to the church
[43:47] so so we don't we don't have to have
[43:49] some uh high class guy or some great
[43:51] intellectual mind amen we could just
[43:54] simply take what the prophet of God said
[43:56] and it would been just as clear because
[43:58] it's a reality Amen in this generation
[44:01] amen now we are living according to the
[44:03] Feast of the trumpets the prophet of God
[44:05] said he said the people he says now
[44:08] that's believe in him how will they know
[44:11] unless they're constantly in the word of
[44:13] what he is now Daniel said the wise
[44:15] would know but the foolish and the
[44:18] unwise they wouldn't know and they shall
[44:20] know their God now he shall appear in
[44:23] the last days to bring the people back
[44:25] to the word so the bride will know her
[44:27] husband her mate the revealed word now
[44:31] what's the mate of the church the
[44:33] revealed word what was brother bam doing
[44:36] bringing us the revealed word he says
[44:39] now see her mate the revealed word
[44:41] that's why this has to happen it wasn't
[44:44] the reformers was it in Luther was it in
[44:47] Wesley was it in the Pentecostals he
[44:49] said scripture says it wasn't but it
[44:51] will come and that is his promise for
[44:54] this age we are living in the age his
[44:58] coming will be in amen oh my now we're
[45:01] not just talking about his physical body
[45:04] we're talking about the coming of the
[45:06] son of man we're talking about God
[45:09] revealing himself in the token
[45:12] manifestation amen apart from the
[45:14] Rapture of the church see the whole
[45:15] world knows about the physical Return of
[45:18] the Lord amen that we're supposed to go
[45:20] meet him in the air what the world
[45:22] missed was amen the revealing of the son
[45:26] a man on the earth before we meet the
[45:28] Corporal body that's in heaven simply
[45:31] told with Abraham that there was a
[45:33] coming to midic before there was a
[45:35] coming of Isaac amen now we see this
[45:37] that the mystery of course amen is the
[45:40] mystery of his coming that he would have
[45:42] a coming mystery of the coming the
[45:43] mystery of his will now listen the
[45:45] mystery now brother Ram says see the
[45:48] scripture packed me back and Sh it the
[45:50] mystery of his coming the mystery of his
[45:52] wheel the mystery of us sitting together
[45:55] now the mystery of his is coming it's a
[45:56] very powerful thing because amen many
[45:59] sitting here tonight when you say the
[46:01] mystery of his coming you're looking off
[46:03] into something you don't understand but
[46:05] really you have the uh most of you uh
[46:08] even our young people hold the knowledge
[46:11] of it but the terminology amen sometimes
[46:14] gets lost in it and then they think it's
[46:16] some big something that they couldn't
[46:18] able to accept but then the Lord would
[46:21] show us easily now we use the word in
[46:23] the church Elohim and how many ever
[46:25] heard brother mam talk about it in the
[46:27] beginning was the word and the Word was
[46:29] with God and brother M said see back
[46:31] there he said there it was God he said
[46:33] self-existent one and brother R will
[46:35] switch the word God and he'll use the
[46:37] word Elohim because he said the word God
[46:39] now you got to be careful he said
[46:41] because God means in the English an
[46:44] object of worship he said so you could
[46:45] worship your piano he said you could
[46:48] worship your car he said see you make it
[46:50] a God he said but none of them is Elohim
[46:53] which is a self-existent one who then
[46:56] became worshiped right so then when you
[46:58] look into this then you see that
[47:00] whenever you go into the the secular
[47:02] world and they believe in polytheism and
[47:04] they think about all these Gods amen
[47:06] then they're going to take the word
[47:07] Elohim and they're going to tell you
[47:09] Elohim is plural amen and it is a plural
[47:12] word it's a it's a Hebrew word which is
[47:14] plural for it means uh uh uh Elohim
[47:16] means more than one it's an Elohim but
[47:20] you got to understand that Elohim does
[47:22] not mean more than one person it means
[47:25] more than one attribute so God is plural
[47:28] but he's not plural in person he's
[47:31] plural in attributes and then therefore
[47:33] we see that this is the mystery that was
[47:36] given unto Abraham that caused now
[47:39] remember who Abraham was he was living
[47:41] down in the valley of shenar confusion
[47:43] the fall out of Babylon when all the
[47:45] tongues were there and everybody spoke
[47:47] different languages and different ideas
[47:49] and they had all these gods they were
[47:51] worshiping but the truth of the one God
[47:54] came unto him and and then later he was
[47:56] out on the plains remember why God
[47:58] called him out cuz he said it's easier
[48:00] for me to call you out of Babylon and to
[48:03] make you a nation under yourself CU
[48:05] you're never going to convince all these
[48:08] trinitarians that there's only one God
[48:10] so you come out of that denomination out
[48:13] here to a place where I will make you a
[48:15] nation under yourself and your stars and
[48:18] the Sea will and the Sands of the sea
[48:20] will number the number of your children
[48:22] that's going to believe in only one God
[48:24] now then you see the revelation of it
[48:26] come near that when Abraham was sitting
[48:29] at the tent door one day and three men
[48:31] walk up to him and he said Lord amen now
[48:35] there's the Revelation and brother B
[48:36] said that Revelation put him in
[48:38] condition for the changing of his body
[48:41] look at what that Revelation did he
[48:42] could see three of them and he could say
[48:45] Lord because he already understood that
[48:47] the god of Heaven cannot be confined to
[48:50] one attribute he is a one person but he
[48:53] has many attributes and that attribute
[48:55] of God came down in the form of a man
[48:58] had dust on his clothes amen was weary
[49:01] in his body they washed his feet they
[49:03] fed him meat he had conversation with
[49:05] him but Abraham called him Lord later
[49:08] amen Paul speaking of him amen talk
[49:11] about when Abraham met him as mdct and
[49:14] he was a man he was a king he was a
[49:16] priest and he met him but then then
[49:19] Abraham am man of course Paul said then
[49:21] he was a man and he said what kind of
[49:23] man was he that Abra paid ties to him so
[49:26] brother Bram said he was a man but then
[49:29] he also said he was without beginning of
[49:31] days or ending of life so whoever he was
[49:33] he's still alive tonight so what kind of
[49:36] man was he he was the kind of man that
[49:39] God had picked up the elements and
[49:41] stepped into a body and begin to speak
[49:43] now Jesus seeing that same picture
[49:46] looked into the Old Testament picked out
[49:48] the story of Abraham and told the end
[49:51] time generation that as it was in the
[49:54] days of lot so shall it be in the coming
[49:57] of the son of man as it was in the days
[49:59] of Noah so shall it be in the coming of
[50:02] the son of man he lives two Secrets out
[50:04] right he says lot and Noah but amen the
[50:07] hidden part is Abraham and Enoch amen
[50:10] but there would be a generation that
[50:12] would receive the revelation of Elohim
[50:15] and know that when God returns in the
[50:17] end time it will be the one God the same
[50:20] God in the power of the Holy Ghost will
[50:22] drop down in the church and he will pick
[50:25] up human bodies and use them so much
[50:27] that we will know it's the Lord speaking
[50:30] through a man to show the Dynamics of
[50:33] the revelation of Jesus Christ may I say
[50:35] tonight Jesus is not a second person of
[50:38] a godhead Jesus is the fullness of the
[50:41] godhead bodily in a man and that Jesus
[50:44] is not in a tomb tonight that Jesus has
[50:47] been raised up to sit on the throne of
[50:49] God and he sent back the spirit of God
[50:52] into the
[50:54] church hallelujah hallelujah that's not
[50:57] another God come
[50:59] on it's the same
[51:01] one it's the coming of
[51:04] Elohim now you can go look through these
[51:07] quotes and I don't have time to lay it
[51:09] all in there tonight so we're going to
[51:10] preach it but you can go look it up if
[51:11] you like to study the message it's a
[51:13] powerful study just type in Elohim and
[51:16] look at that Elohim back in the bride
[51:19] Elohim
[51:20] materializing it's been the picture of
[51:22] God the whole time Elohim he said there
[51:25] he was the very life that was in the
[51:28] thinking of God of you is in the body
[51:30] tonight and he's already seen us
[51:32] gathered around his throne in the end do
[51:35] you see the mystery of Elohim is that
[51:38] God doesn't change so you're dealing
[51:42] with an unchanging God now that's
[51:43] powerful Church he's an unchanging God
[51:47] in other words he never changes his
[51:49] nature that's the rule of Malachi when
[51:52] he said I am God and I change not so God
[51:56] doesn't change he never changes his
[51:58] nature so whatever he was he is that's
[52:01] why it says Jesus Christ the same
[52:04] yesterday today and forever so if he
[52:07] don't change his nature then what does
[52:09] he change brother Ram reveals it to the
[52:11] church he said that's where the
[52:13] scripture said that God was in the form
[52:16] of a servant he said that word form
[52:18] there is the word imor I'll pour out my
[52:21] spirit in the last day the word Kos
[52:23] which in Hebrew and in the Greek is
[52:26] showing the Revelation that it would be
[52:28] God who would be changing his mask it
[52:31] would not be another God he wouldn't
[52:33] change his nature he wouldn't change his
[52:35] person he would only change the mask
[52:38] that he was wearing the God that was
[52:41] above us became the God that was with us
[52:45] and became the god that is in us that's
[52:48] why it is Body Spirit and soul the God
[52:51] that was only in the body realm went
[52:53] into the spirit realm but but tonight
[52:55] he's in the realm of the Soul because
[52:58] the Son of God didn't start on any day
[53:02] you were Eternal to begin with and
[53:04] you're as much a part of God as God
[53:07] himself is God you have received Zoe
[53:10] life eternal life my goodness we're not
[53:13] talking about another God we're talking
[53:15] about the same God in Bride
[53:19] form it's the same
[53:22] Jesus in Bride form let me just point a
[53:26] couple little quotes here she
[53:30] is y'all y'all know what I'm talking
[53:32] about the seven seal brought
[53:35] him back to the Earth she
[53:40] is the word coming in to the
[53:45] bride see it's the bride coming of
[53:48] Christ now it's powerful if you go
[53:50] listen to the rising of the sun it's a
[53:51] little different than the way it's
[53:53] written cuz whoever was transcribed
[53:55] describing it when they wrote it in the
[53:56] book If you read it it don't sound the
[53:57] same they put a little comma in there
[53:59] it's a good study go go look look and
[54:01] see where they put the comma you see
[54:03] people's Revelation amen the bride
[54:05] coming of Christ and then they put a
[54:06] comma in there and then they act like
[54:09] amen it's just coming out of the church
[54:10] this not talking about just the bride
[54:12] coming out of church it's talking about
[54:14] Christ coming in the bride form amen
[54:17] what are we talking about we're talking
[54:19] about him packing three names when when
[54:22] God comes brother B said he comes under
[54:25] three different now we're not talking
[54:26] about Redemptive names he comes under
[54:28] three manifestation of names he's the
[54:31] son of man he's the son of God and he
[54:35] also is the son of David now it wasn't a
[54:38] different person y'all remember this now
[54:40] cuz it remember it wasn't a different
[54:41] person because when Jesus was there on
[54:43] the earth it was blind bardus it was
[54:46] seeing him coming by and he said thou
[54:48] son of David have mercy on me and Jesus
[54:51] Stood Still and turned around and said
[54:54] what do you have need of and blind
[54:55] bardus got his eyes didn't he amen under
[54:58] the administration of son of David that
[55:01] same man standing there there was a
[55:03] little woman a sarapan which was a
[55:05] gentile and she said unto him thou son
[55:08] of David have mercy and he never even
[55:10] turned to look at her the Bible said she
[55:13] worshiped louder and he spoke not a word
[55:17] unto her but when she changed her
[55:19] approach under the person of Jesus
[55:22] Christ she said Lord have mercy on me
[55:26] there it is the son of man is Lord to
[55:29] the Gentile Church we're talking about
[55:31] restoring lordship we're talking about
[55:33] going back to the Garden of Eden where
[55:36] he is the lord of the church he's not
[55:38] just a king he's our Lord he's our
[55:41] savior he's our God the lordship of this
[55:44] church returns under the adoption
[55:46] anointing in the last days do you see
[55:48] it's the same person but a different
[55:53] Administration uh you you come down to
[55:55] these you come down to these little
[55:57] little small towns where they just got
[55:59] one person one clerk you know and
[56:01] they're working and they're working in
[56:03] the you going in the DMV or the vehicle
[56:06] place and you need a you need a license
[56:08] plate and you say I need a license plate
[56:09] on this old truck this he you can't get
[56:11] it here you got to go to the title
[56:12] department where's the title department
[56:15] it's down there at the end of the desk
[56:17] and you walk down to end of the desk and
[56:18] they roll their chair over to the end of
[56:20] the desk it's the same person come on
[56:23] but it's a different office
[56:25] and we're dealing with the same person
[56:27] in a different office it is the coming
[56:31] of the son of man it's not a mystery it
[56:34] has been revealed in simple Kentucky
[56:38] English to let the church know the
[56:40] coming of the son of man was manifested
[56:43] through a prophet of God to let you and
[56:46] I know that we have come to the time of
[56:48] the rapturing of the church we are a
[56:51] generation of people that shall not
[56:53] hinder them with sleep in the ground but
[56:56] we have come to the age of the
[56:58] glorification of the church by the voice
[57:00] of the son of man we shall raise from
[57:03] the dead it's the coming of Elohim see
[57:07] it's the mystery of his coming he had to
[57:11] come to Abraham as Elohim before Isaac
[57:15] could come brother M said you you you
[57:18] see it in the time he said Isaac they
[57:21] needed a change of that
[57:23] body they need needed a change of the
[57:25] body to meet Isaac Jesus is our Isaac
[57:29] and we need a change of body to meet him
[57:32] but what is it going to change our body
[57:34] I tell you what changed Abraham's body
[57:36] was the coming of Elohim amen and the
[57:38] thing that'll change the body of the
[57:40] church tonight is the coming of this
[57:42] message it is the coming of
[57:46] Elohim on the earth to a bride to
[57:50] manifest his life now I'll read you a
[57:52] couple quotes here for the message of
[57:53] the trial that y'all know so y'all know
[57:55] in 1933 the angel appeared to brother
[57:57] bam and said as John the Baptist was
[57:59] given a message you've been given one
[58:02] right and he said that would be amen the
[58:05] for run the second coming so brother B
[58:08] then goes around the world with this
[58:10] message and by 1964 he's putting it on
[58:14] trial and he's saying there's a lot of
[58:17] prosecutors out here asking me if I was
[58:21] supposed to do that where's he at that's
[58:24] what they were asking go back and listen
[58:25] to the message of the trial brother
[58:27] Brandon was saying they're saying you
[58:29] said you had a message to forun his
[58:31] coming where's he at where's he at and
[58:34] brother Ram begins to answer and he says
[58:37] I call your attention to the scriptural
[58:39] blind prosecutor all right this is going
[58:42] to sound ridiculous but they're
[58:44] scripturally blind he said in St Luke he
[58:47] said the 17th chapter as it was in the
[58:50] days of the son of man now you want to
[58:52] know where this man is he's the same yes
[58:54] yesterday today and forever you want to
[58:58] know where the nail scars and the prints
[59:00] and things are any hypocrite could do
[59:03] that the Life of Christ returns in the
[59:07] form of the Holy Ghost not nail
[59:10] scars wo brother amen to make
[59:14] intercession he said right now that body
[59:17] is setting at the right hand of God to
[59:19] make intercession but the Holy Ghost has
[59:22] come to carry out his works it's the
[59:25] Holy Ghost I want you to know in John
[59:28] 14-5 in the trial in Topeka 1964 brother
[59:32] Adam says see he said now listen every
[59:34] knee shall bow and every eye should see
[59:36] him and every tongue could confess he
[59:39] only promised to turn into Power of the
[59:43] spirit and vindicate the
[59:45] word he never Pro in this age he never
[59:49] promised I'm I read above it he said
[59:51] I'll call your attention to this Jesus
[59:52] being here with nail scars in the hand
[59:54] he never made such a
[59:57] promise woo Glory he never made such a
[1:00:01] promise now now let me just let me just
[1:00:03] pull you into this you remember brother
[1:00:05] brandom when he was talking about Martin
[1:00:07] and he said Martin saw Jesus appear with
[1:00:09] a crown and he said there he was with
[1:00:11] thorns Crown he had a crown he had th
[1:00:14] scars in his hands he said the Lord
[1:00:17] Jesus stood there crowned before him he
[1:00:19] said Martin picked up his ink well and
[1:00:21] threw it at him he said because he knew
[1:00:24] the scripture said that the Saints would
[1:00:26] crown him in the Millennium he knew
[1:00:28] whoever was standing there was an
[1:00:30] impostor he looked like Jesus but it
[1:00:33] wasn't Jesus because he knew the
[1:00:35] scripture of his age and brother Randon
[1:00:37] was saying look if there was a man
[1:00:38] walked in here tonight with nail prce in
[1:00:40] his hand we couldn't accept him because
[1:00:42] it wasn't the promise the promise was
[1:00:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost living as
[1:00:47] a son of man among the church and that
[1:00:50] will carry a bride out of this Dimension
[1:00:53] and we will meet him in the air with all
[1:00:56] of his thorns and his crown and we'll
[1:00:58] see him in his glory and in his power
[1:01:00] there is a real Corporal body but we are
[1:01:03] going to meet that body in another
[1:01:08] dimension amen now might not fit
[1:01:11] tradition but it fits the
[1:01:14] scripture Christ according to the trial
[1:01:17] will return in the form of the word
[1:01:19] working in human beings showing the
[1:01:21] signs and
[1:01:22] wonders he said I love how brother B
[1:01:25] says things he said Jesus was God In the
[1:01:28] Flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight
[1:01:32] it's still God manifesting In the Flesh
[1:01:35] the son of man revealing himself the
[1:01:37] church in human flesh making himself
[1:01:40] known well I think we could I think we
[1:01:43] could preach right there for an hour I'm
[1:01:44] not going to do it but I think we could
[1:01:46] preach a while if that was God
[1:01:48] manifested In the Flesh then he's
[1:01:50] telling you the same thing in your flesh
[1:01:54] is still God manifested In the Flesh let
[1:01:58] me just say it to you like this the Lord
[1:02:00] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:02:01] shout and with a voice how far is he
[1:02:03] coming down then okay amen so so we can
[1:02:06] get him down to a prophet almost
[1:02:08] everybody agrees he came down to
[1:02:10] prophetic form now amen let me ask you
[1:02:13] this did he just stay there is that as
[1:02:16] far as this message came to brother
[1:02:19] random himself and then there was
[1:02:21] nothing behind that but I believe that
[1:02:23] God came to a prophet to be introduced
[1:02:26] so he could work to the church as the
[1:02:29] word of God the word couldn't come to
[1:02:31] denomination it had to come to a prophet
[1:02:34] but once it came to the prophet it was
[1:02:36] introduced as a Vindicated word and then
[1:02:39] the church would be able to move into
[1:02:40] that and now him in you is the same word
[1:02:44] that was in the beginning and the glory
[1:02:46] of God is in the church by the word
[1:02:49] being in the church amen I want you to
[1:02:51] think about it tonight shake it off of
[1:02:53] you I don't care and what you think
[1:02:55] about yourself God has descended to the
[1:02:57] form of the Bride of Jesus Christ some
[1:03:01] of you are poor some of you are
[1:03:03] illiterate some are high some are big
[1:03:05] what difference does it make at Calvary
[1:03:08] we all became the same and God filled
[1:03:11] the church with the power and with the
[1:03:14] anointing of
[1:03:16] God hallelujah I don't know how to
[1:03:18] explain it any better than this let me
[1:03:19] just say it like this we y'all know what
[1:03:21] uranium
[1:03:22] is you know that stuff they got that
[1:03:25] skull and ex's on you know kills people
[1:03:28] they die uranium or or or let's just say

[1:03:33] a big pile of nucleus waste and you put
[1:03:36] it in a trash bag and hand it to
[1:03:39] somebody is it any less powerful because
[1:03:42] it's in a paper
[1:03:44] bag come on would you would you take
[1:03:46] uranium in a paper bag and say oh don't
[1:03:48] worry it won't hurt you because it's not
[1:03:50] powerful in that bag could you take it
[1:03:53] and put it in a plastic bag let me ask
[1:03:55] you what about a Lowe's bag what about a
[1:03:57] Walmart bag what amen what about a Gucci
[1:04:00] bag amen amen what about putting it in
[1:04:03] Amen in Louis Paton amen would it be
[1:04:06] would it would it be better then I don't
[1:04:08] care how much that bag cost you that
[1:04:10] uranium will still be uranium and listen
[1:04:13] God has come into this church in the
[1:04:16] last days and you can put it in a silk
[1:04:18] suit you can put it in a pair of
[1:04:20] coveralls you can put Oh Glory to God it
[1:04:24] ain't education it ain't Society it's
[1:04:27] the god of Heaven has descended out of
[1:04:29] heaven and he's in the Church of the
[1:04:31] Living God and if he's in you he's as
[1:04:34] much God as when he was in the days of
[1:04:36] our Lord Jesus he's as much God as he
[1:04:39] was in the days of Peter it's the
[1:04:41] mystery of the coming of the
[1:04:44] Lord
[1:04:48] hallelujah put it in a woman put it in a
[1:04:51] man put it in a child put it in an elder
[1:04:53] he's still God he still got the power
[1:04:57] tonight to raise the dead to change
[1:04:59] Hearts listen this ain't just God With
[1:05:02] Us it's God in
[1:05:06] us hallelu Jesus Christ will come down
[1:05:09] in human
[1:05:12] flesh so how
[1:05:14] far let me ask you where you where you
[1:05:16] going to put the barrier so he can come
[1:05:19] down to
[1:05:21] where am I wish I was a better
[1:05:24] exemplify but let me just let me just do
[1:05:27] this can I borrow his chairman amen
[1:05:31] we're going to preach on object lessons
[1:05:34] now all
[1:05:36] right here it is this is a this is a
[1:05:41] barrier and God is standing just out
[1:05:45] there and the church was trying to get
[1:05:47] to him but the denomination was here
[1:05:51] another denomination was here schools of
[1:05:54] Society was here and they all had that
[1:05:57] barrier what William brandham did is he
[1:06:01] come and did
[1:06:03] this and he just moved that thing right
[1:06:06] out of the way and he said look guys
[1:06:09] there he is and he broke through the
[1:06:11] barriers of unbelief and made a way for
[1:06:14] the church brother bam now here's the
[1:06:17] problem we got now amen people saw what
[1:06:19] God done in brother brandom so they take
[1:06:21] brother brandom now and they put brother
[1:06:23] random in that place so now you can't
[1:06:25] get to God because you're trying to act
[1:06:27] like brother bam you can't have a gift
[1:06:30] cuz you're trying to be like brother bam
[1:06:31] you can't have the word listen they
[1:06:33] won't even let us preach the gospel no
[1:06:34] more you got we can't even get it in a
[1:06:37] preacher we got to leave it in the tape
[1:06:38] or leave it in a book but God never come
[1:06:41] in this age to stay in a book or to stay
[1:06:43] in a tape he came to develop a bride in
[1:06:47] the image of God before the foundation
[1:06:49] of the world so I say tear down every
[1:06:51] barrier I say move every the image I say
[1:06:55] let the spirit of God flow in the church
[1:06:58] with authority and with
[1:07:01] power this message didn't come to block
[1:07:04] it this come it come to make a
[1:07:07] way Hallelujah he's returned to the
[1:07:12] earth I challenge you to believe I'll
[1:07:14] just use brother bram's words all right
[1:07:16] that Jesus is revealed in the form of
[1:07:19] the son of man in human flesh through
[1:07:21] the bride's body
[1:07:25] it's the bride coming of Christ brother
[1:07:27] brandom calls it the secret
[1:07:30] food not everybody can eat it give some
[1:07:34] people
[1:07:35] indigestion but to the church it's bride
[1:07:39] food amen Do You Hear What Paul was
[1:07:42] saying he said got some things to teach
[1:07:45] he said but see you can't hear them now
[1:07:47] he said having need for the milk he said
[1:07:50] there's a lot of things I'd like to say
[1:07:52] but you're dull of hearing that early
[1:07:54] Church couldn't take the revelation of
[1:07:56] mecdc it couldn't take the revelation of
[1:07:59] Elohim amen but he knew that was coming
[1:08:01] to day when he said it in Hebrews 11
[1:08:04] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:08:06] he knew there'd come a capping to this
[1:08:08] pyramid he knew there would come a day
[1:08:10] when the mystery of the son of man would
[1:08:12] become so real that our young people
[1:08:15] could take it our elders could take it
[1:08:17] everybody could believe it because they
[1:08:19] were born of God to believe
[1:08:22] it come on you were made to believe
[1:08:27] it Hallelujah now I'll take brother
[1:08:29] bram's own words his ministry was to
[1:08:33] declare him and he said and he's here
[1:08:38] now another way in Christ the mystery he
[1:08:39] said it the headship is here amen Christ
[1:08:44] the Risen Lord the headship is here now
[1:08:48] what has he come for to reveal his will
[1:08:53] yeah that's the mystery is the will of
[1:08:57] God that's what the church needed was to
[1:09:00] know the will of God you know uh I I was
[1:09:04] I had the privilege of being over in
[1:09:06] Israel and uh we were over and we
[1:09:08] watched the temple Institute they were
[1:09:09] building the Temple over there and uh I
[1:09:11] think it's Rabbi Rickman and them they
[1:09:13] got what they call a Sanhedrin Council
[1:09:15] basically and they're restoring
[1:09:17] everything and they can't build the
[1:09:19] Temple of course because you can't get
[1:09:20] on Temple Mount to rebuild nothing cuz
[1:09:22] it's uh it's just it's a Muslim
[1:09:24] stronghold so because the Muslims have a
[1:09:26] stronghold but you can go up there if
[1:09:28] you got the right guides and I we
[1:09:30] actually got the blessing of going up on
[1:09:31] Temple Mount but you can't pray up there
[1:09:34] you can't can't say the name of the Lord
[1:09:36] you can't bow your head pray nothing
[1:09:37] like that you can just be up there and
[1:09:39] the Muslims I think they're scared of
[1:09:41] prayer you know but amen but what we got
[1:09:45] up there is it was powerful some of you
[1:09:47] may have heard this before but I thought
[1:09:48] it was pretty powerful cuz we start we
[1:09:50] start walking and this guy brother
[1:09:52] brother Rickman he looks over at us and
[1:09:54] he goes they won't let us pray up here
[1:09:56] he said but you guys know the Book of
[1:09:57] Joshua don't you and we're all preachers
[1:09:59] you know we yeah we know the Book of
[1:10:01] Joshua he said then come and walk around
[1:10:03] it with me so there he was up there
[1:10:06] putting
[1:10:07] footsteps amen around that around that
[1:10:09] Temple amen now he took us down off of
[1:10:12] the Temple Mount took us in this room
[1:10:14] where they're building these artifacts
[1:10:15] and they got they got the manur the
[1:10:18] seven candlesticks they've got it built
[1:10:19] solid gold it's worth millions it's
[1:10:21] beautiful they've got pots they've got
[1:10:24] the ash plate and they've got the bronze
[1:10:26] Altar and they've got a lot of the
[1:10:28] articles that was needed in the in the
[1:10:30] uh in the temple that's already built
[1:10:32] cuz they said when the temple comes we
[1:10:34] we want these things finished cuz we
[1:10:36] can't work on the Temple we'll work on
[1:10:37] these then when the Temple's finished
[1:10:38] we'll just move them all in I said well
[1:10:41] that's pretty good thinking he said but
[1:10:42] right now he said now they may have
[1:10:43] figured it out since i' since that's
[1:10:45] been 10 years ago but he said the thing
[1:10:47] we're working on right now is the
[1:10:49] curtain that goes into the holies of
[1:10:51] holies and I said we're working on it I
[1:10:53] said well how long's that take to make
[1:10:55] he said well he said we're trying to
[1:10:56] figure out what shade of
[1:10:58] blue I said shade of blue he said yeah
[1:11:00] he said you know how many shades of blue
[1:11:02] there is see that they they had to have
[1:11:04] a is it a it's a blue curtain right they
[1:11:06] had to have a blue curtain I think it's
[1:11:07] golden labeled or something like that
[1:11:09] but it was a blue curtain they had to go
[1:11:10] in well the the shade of blue some of
[1:11:13] these guys had spent 20 years studying
[1:11:15] the scripture to figure out which shade
[1:11:17] of blue Moses was talking about now can
[1:11:19] you imagine dedicating your whole life
[1:11:23] to figure figing out what shade of blue
[1:11:25] the curtain was and it's important in
[1:11:28] their religion because that's life and
[1:11:30] death right now think about this because
[1:11:32] how many shades of blue are there and
[1:11:34] how many opinions are there of what
[1:11:36] shade blue that is now here's here's the
[1:11:39] thing you think about this so there's
[1:11:40] maybe there's some important guys and 40
[1:11:43] or 50 of them decide it's this shade of
[1:11:45] blue and there's less important guys and
[1:11:47] they decide it's this shade of blue and
[1:11:49] then there's some uh maybe a group of
[1:11:51] sisters and they say it's this shade of
[1:11:52] blue so so what shade is it who's we who
[1:11:55] are we going to follow the most popular
[1:11:57] the most uh outdated are we going to who
[1:12:00] how what are we going to do how are we
[1:12:02] going to follow see but but what they
[1:12:04] need is they need
[1:12:07] Moses cuz if Moses would walk in the
[1:12:09] room he'd just say thus sayith the lord
[1:12:11] it's this shade the argument would be
[1:12:13] over do you see at the last 2,000 years
[1:12:17] we've had them arguing over water
[1:12:19] baptism we've been arguing over
[1:12:21] predestination we've been arguing over
[1:12:23] the order of the church we've been order
[1:12:25] all the baptism and we've been ordering
[1:12:27] over the new birth and we've been
[1:12:29] arguing over all these things but what
[1:12:31] we really needed was a
[1:12:34] prophet and thanks God we've got a
[1:12:37] prophet that revealed the will of God
[1:12:41] concerning the church in the last day he
[1:12:44] brought us out of confusion I don't know
[1:12:47] about you amen God brought us out I
[1:12:50] ain't going back I'm not going back in
[1:12:53] the man manmade ideas and he thinks this
[1:12:55] and he thinks that and they think that I
[1:12:57] believe there'll be a bride that'll stay
[1:13:00] right with this word it's the will of
[1:13:02] God for the bride to stay with the
[1:13:04] message of the hour
[1:13:07] hallelujah
[1:13:09] hallelujah when the word is opened up
[1:13:12] according to Daniel chapter 12 the wise
[1:13:14] is going to understand in Ephesians
[1:13:17] chapter 5 and verse 14 he says awaketh
[1:13:19] Thou that sleepest and arise from the
[1:13:21] dead Christ shall give thee light see
[1:13:23] then thou works circumspectly not as
[1:13:26] fools but as wise Redeeming the time
[1:13:29] because the days of evil be ye therefore
[1:13:32] not
[1:13:33] unwise but understanding what the will
[1:13:37] of the Lord is what makes one wise is to
[1:13:41] understand the will of God there would
[1:13:44] be no reason in this generation for us
[1:13:47] to not know the will of
[1:13:49] God we should know the will of God on
[1:13:52] his word in this season
[1:13:53] we have had a prophet among us there
[1:13:56] should be no question on it Amen brother
[1:13:59] Ram said see here's the thing the voice
[1:14:00] of his sign 1964 he tonight unless we
[1:14:04] know the word of God we don't know what
[1:14:07] to do we can have faith until we know
[1:14:10] what is the will of God then if we know
[1:14:12] it is the will of God the word of God
[1:14:14] says something then we can gladly follow
[1:14:17] it if a prophet gave you the word he
[1:14:20] gave you the will now how many knows the
[1:14:22] first two pools of brother Bam's
[1:14:24] Ministry was not the perfect will of
[1:14:26] God he said so he said actually what it
[1:14:30] done is it produced a lot of
[1:14:32] impersonations right amen but there was
[1:14:34] a true Vindication of the Messiah sign
[1:14:37] that was sent into the age but after
[1:14:39] brother bam left almost every
[1:14:40] charismatic preacher started with gifts
[1:14:43] of discernment because they wanted the
[1:14:46] people to look at them the way they
[1:14:48] looked at brother brandom and that's why
[1:14:50] you and I I'm not going to go to call
[1:14:51] the names tonight but there's some chis
[1:14:53] guys used to carry tents around and they
[1:14:55] go around and brother Roy ruseberry was
[1:14:57] in their meetings actually and he and
[1:14:59] I'm not going into all that but I'll say
[1:15:01] it like this hey man brother Roy said
[1:15:03] I've seen the real and I've seen the
[1:15:04] false and he said I stood right there
[1:15:07] and saw that man under an anointing but
[1:15:09] when he started prophesying it was
[1:15:11] completely wrong he said but I sat in
[1:15:13] brother brandom's meetings and I heard
[1:15:15] him prophesy and it was 100% correct but
[1:15:18] you see what happens is the
[1:15:20] impersonation is devaluing the reality
[1:15:23] of what it was and brother man said see
[1:15:25] they'll be able to impersonate these
[1:15:26] first two he said but now that third
[1:15:28] pull they won't be able to impersonate
[1:15:30] cuz they don't know what it
[1:15:33] is he said the devil y'all don't tighten
[1:15:36] up on me now I'm not calling you
[1:15:37] impersonators amen the devil see the
[1:15:40] devil amen he he can impersonate God but
[1:15:44] he can't be
[1:15:45] God is that right he can't be God that's
[1:15:49] why I always think never I got to be
[1:15:51] careful but I never thought much about
[1:15:52] one pre preacher impersonating another
[1:15:55] cuz they you know there's never two
[1:15:57] preachers identically the same so when
[1:15:59] you see two preachers the same one of
[1:16:01] them's a
[1:16:02] fake every time reminds me of a story
[1:16:05] brother told me one time he said he was
[1:16:06] down in a meeting down in down in
[1:16:08] Florida he said there's an old boy up
[1:16:10] there preaching he said there was a
[1:16:11] drunk sitting on the front row he's
[1:16:12] preaching away said this old boy is
[1:16:14] preaching away and and and he's
[1:16:15] preaching away and all of a sudden the
[1:16:17] old drunk hollered out Billy
[1:16:19] Graham that old boy he changed Tunes in
[1:16:21] a little bit old boy holled out or
[1:16:23] Roberts and little Betty changed Tunes
[1:16:26] holled out another famous preacher oh
[1:16:27] boy said hey would you shut up I'm
[1:16:29] trying to preach he said the real you
[1:16:32] amen see amen he was he was he was
[1:16:35] always somebody else you know amen but
[1:16:37] in the message of the hour amen we're
[1:16:40] not impersonating nothing amen the
[1:16:43] reality is amen you are the highest form
[1:16:46] of life that has ever been sent to the
[1:16:48] Earth we are not acting like other ages
[1:16:51] other Ages were acting like you we are
[1:16:54] not their type they were our type come
[1:16:58] on church amen we shout and dance but
[1:17:00] we're not acting like the
[1:17:03] Pentecostals we had the shout and dance
[1:17:06] in the beginning where where you before
[1:17:09] the foundation of the world come on it's
[1:17:12] been moving from the positive to the
[1:17:14] negative to the positive the whole time
[1:17:16] amen listen this has never been the
[1:17:19] perfect word prde until the hour you're
[1:17:22] living this is the mind of God
[1:17:25] concerning his
[1:17:27] bride hallah now that third pole is the
[1:17:30] perfect will of
[1:17:32] God now here's the here's the beauty of
[1:17:35] it is the word comes to a prophet right
[1:17:40] so when the word comes to a prophet
[1:17:42] that's the perfect will of God
[1:17:44] concerning the
[1:17:46] age now I just love how brother brandham
[1:17:49] says according to Revelations 10 the
[1:17:51] mystery will be finished see the real
[1:17:54] thing the real thing will be revealed
[1:17:57] now I I'm not going to have time to dig
[1:18:00] deep in this but I want to just I want
[1:18:01] to just put it out
[1:18:03] here in the beginning when Eve fell in
[1:18:06] the Garden of Eden what did she fall
[1:18:10] from she fell from the
[1:18:14] word right it was a word issue she fell
[1:18:19] from the word and everything else is an
[1:18:21] attribute of coming out of the word now
[1:18:24] watch so when God prophesied unto her
[1:18:28] that I'll give you a woman's seed
[1:18:30] brother bradam tells us what he's
[1:18:31] actually predicting is that the word
[1:18:34] would once again come to you see she
[1:18:36] lost her she lost her chance at it but
[1:18:40] God is prophesying the word is going to
[1:18:42] come back but between the time she lost
[1:18:46] the word and the time the word comes
[1:18:49] back people have to live they've got to
[1:18:52] make it so what does God do he begins
[1:18:55] the whole thing by going in and finding
[1:18:58] Adam and Eve in a in a garment remember
[1:19:00] they had dressed theirselves in fig
[1:19:01] leaves and brother B said and God wanted
[1:19:03] to have a Garden of Eden conference and
[1:19:05] they wasn't dressed for it he said so he
[1:19:08] stripped their fig Leaf off and killed a
[1:19:10] lamb and threw a bloody skin and said
[1:19:13] wear that to the conference so he gave
[1:19:15] them something to wear to come into the
[1:19:18] presence of God which would be a
[1:19:20] temporary garment until that immortal Ro
[1:19:23] would be restored back to the church
[1:19:25] again so everything from the time of
[1:19:28] Adam now look what they done they went
[1:19:30] right up to the gate and build an altar
[1:19:31] and shed the blood that was as close as
[1:19:32] they get to the presence of God the
[1:19:34] substitute couldn't go in the garden it
[1:19:37] was at the Gate of the
[1:19:39] garden
[1:19:41] right that runs deep now folks amen they
[1:19:45] couldn't get in they were at the gate
[1:19:46] but they couldn't get in and then it was
[1:19:48] there at that where the presence of God
[1:19:50] was and Cain fled but from the time of
[1:19:52] of Eve all the way to the time of Jesus
[1:19:55] everything they had was a
[1:19:57] substitute the Lambs of of the token and
[1:20:00] Moses's laws the Tabernacles it was all
[1:20:04] substitutes but what happened was is the
[1:20:07] people got so enriched in the
[1:20:10] substitutes that when the perfect word
[1:20:12] came to them they were not ready to
[1:20:15] release the substitute and take a hold
[1:20:18] of the word now brother brandom says
[1:20:21] here's the thing he said watch this he
[1:20:23] said they all missed
[1:20:25] it now now you think about this John
[1:20:28] prophesied from the book of Isaiah the
[1:20:30] Lord Jesus prophesied from the Garden of
[1:20:32] Eden and the the Pharisees missed
[1:20:36] it brother bam said the disciples missed
[1:20:39] it I can read you the Scripture it said
[1:20:41] the disciples asked him saying why is
[1:20:43] that El lias said must first come and he
[1:20:45] said see they missed John the
[1:20:47] Baptist they missed the prophet and they
[1:20:51] missed the Messiah all right they missed
[1:20:53] both the prophet and God Amen and they
[1:20:56] missed it brother B said the disciples
[1:20:58] missed it the people missed it the
[1:21:00] Pharisees missed it he said everybody
[1:21:03] missed it come on now now here's the
[1:21:05] here's the real catch it wasn't even
[1:21:07] prophesied to be a
[1:21:10] secret it wasn't even supposed to be a
[1:21:13] secret and they missed it anyhow because
[1:21:16] they were blinded by the substitutes
[1:21:19] amen but watch now when they turned it
[1:21:22] down brother BR said oh he said see
[1:21:24] that's the thing he said somebody said
[1:21:26] well if everybody's going to miss it he
[1:21:28] said well then he said there ain't no me
[1:21:29] need of me trying he said but see he
[1:21:32] said you got to have that kind of Faith
[1:21:34] he said the kind of Faith you got to
[1:21:36] have is if everybody else misses it I'm
[1:21:38] going to be
[1:21:39] there brother man said see there's no
[1:21:42] need to be trying but that shows you
[1:21:43] ain't got the right kind of faith yet he
[1:21:45] said because somebody's going to get it
[1:21:48] now watch somebody got it but it had to
[1:21:50] be showed to them watch this when when
[1:21:53] Jesus went to Apostle Peter he didn't
[1:21:56] have it he wasn't catching it but Jesus
[1:21:59] went to him to be sure he didn't miss it
[1:22:02] oh brother Amen brother B said when he
[1:22:04] went down there and he began to show
[1:22:06] that mexic sign over Apostle Peter he
[1:22:08] said he said oh there he was it ruffled
[1:22:10] his feathers he said he was all starchy
[1:22:12] and a religious man he said but when
[1:22:15] that struck over his life he said he
[1:22:17] said I love how how brother Ram says
[1:22:20] things he says it was that little
[1:22:21] eternal life seed down on the inside of
[1:22:24] Peter he said and when it be to strike
[1:22:26] over him he said see why it happened so
[1:22:30] quick because Peter immediately was
[1:22:32] ready to follow Jesus he said how did
[1:22:35] that happen so quick he said see back
[1:22:38] there in the beginning now this is third
[1:22:39] and fourth seal brother said it like
[1:22:41] this he said back there in the beginning
[1:22:43] when the heavens and the Earth was
[1:22:44] without form and void and darkness
[1:22:47] covered the Earth he said there were
[1:22:49] seeds laying underneath that Earth he
[1:22:53] said and darkness covered the seeds in
[1:22:55] the water but when God said let there be
[1:22:58] light he said the clouds parted back and
[1:23:01] the sun struck the seeds and they were
[1:23:04] already there so they come to life he
[1:23:07] said and that's what happened to Apostle
[1:23:09] Peter when the light struck the seed it
[1:23:12] was an immediate response because the
[1:23:15] seed was already there oh Church of the
[1:23:19] Living God can you imagine that little
[1:23:21] woman at the well as she stands with
[1:23:23] eternal life seed in her amen but there
[1:23:25] was a cloud that was covering her of an
[1:23:28] immoral life but when the Vindicated
[1:23:31] word of God came under her what it done
[1:23:33] it broke down the barriers of unbelief
[1:23:36] and the seed lived
[1:23:38] again can I say it to you it didn't take
[1:23:40] an all night prayer meeting folks it
[1:23:42] didn't take two nights and five days to
[1:23:45] figure out what it was she began to
[1:23:47] scream amen I know thou the prophet thou
[1:23:51] the Messiah and you know what she did
[1:23:53] she didn't then then she just decided
[1:23:55] Well you know what I've seen it I'll
[1:23:56] just sit down and quit no the Bible said
[1:23:58] she put down her water pot and ran into
[1:24:00] the City and said come see a man and
[1:24:03] many believe because of her testimony
[1:24:06] amen she was just a woman but she was so
[1:24:08] influenced by the Vindicated word that
[1:24:11] she was leading people to the word of
[1:24:13] God and they say tonight the word has
[1:24:16] returned and influenced the church there
[1:24:19] was a seed in you that's the reason
[1:24:22] believe it that was a seed in you and
[1:24:25] God wouldn't let you miss
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:29] it it's the will of God it's the will of
[1:24:33] God
[1:24:35] seeall now brother Ram said what did
[1:24:37] they do they missed
[1:24:40] him the Living Word now he said that
[1:24:44] second Eve done what the first Eve
[1:24:47] did remember he said they did it at NAA
[1:24:51] though right he said the first Eve did
[1:24:53] it in the garden and the second did it
[1:24:56] in nah she committed the same thing she
[1:25:01] let the word slip away from her and
[1:25:04] brother Bram said but watch when the
[1:25:06] word went away from her there was
[1:25:09] already a promise laying in the
[1:25:10] scripture and Malachi 4 said I shall
[1:25:14] restore by the spirit of Elijah in Joel
[1:25:17] chapter 2 said I shall restore sayith
[1:25:19] the Lord before she ever fail God had
[1:25:23] already made a promise of restoration
[1:25:25] isn't that powerful but until the time
[1:25:28] of restoration now here's the beauty
[1:25:30] because the Bible said in Acts chapter 3
[1:25:32] that the heavens must receive Jesus
[1:25:34] Christ until the restitution of all
[1:25:36] things and they haven't even fail in NAA
[1:25:39] yet but there's prophecy of a
[1:25:41] restitution of all things according to
[1:25:43] Daniel 12:4 in the last days the book
[1:25:45] would be open according to Revelations
[1:25:47] 10: 7 the seventh angel will reveal the
[1:25:50] mysteries of the book and if those
[1:25:51] Mysteries are the word he would have to
[1:25:53] be a prophet and according to Malachi 4
[1:25:56] Elijah should come before the great and
[1:25:58] Dreadful day of the Lord so it couldn't
[1:26:00] be restored until the last age amen and
[1:26:03] they fell back there in the third age
[1:26:06] but between the third and the seventh
[1:26:07] age God gave them the
[1:26:11] substitutes and he by Grace under the
[1:26:14] blood let them come to him smoking ptes
[1:26:19] having trinitarian
[1:26:21] baptisms
[1:26:25] now you explain it to
[1:26:27] me people said well the Bible's my
[1:26:29] absolute then Martin Luther didn't make
[1:26:33] it come on church so what is the
[1:26:37] absolute brother Wayne the revealed the
[1:26:38] will of God when God gives Revelation
[1:26:42] you got to go back in the Bible now you
[1:26:44] Enoch didn't have a
[1:26:46] Bible Abel didn't have a Bible job
[1:26:49] didn't have a Bible Noah didn't have a
[1:26:51] Bible there wasn't a written manuscript
[1:26:53] until Moses but they all had absolutes
[1:26:57] because God revealed to them and in the
[1:27:00] last days he said the Revelation would
[1:27:02] come to us through a prophet so when God
[1:27:04] revealed Reformation through Martin
[1:27:06] Luther they had a substitute until the
[1:27:09] time that another Revelation broke and
[1:27:12] when the Revelation broke on
[1:27:14] sanctification justification couldn't
[1:27:16] couldn't work no more but it was only a
[1:27:19] substitute sanctification and when the
[1:27:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost fell there in
[1:27:24] 1906 it wasn't the true baptism it was a
[1:27:27] Reformation of gifts that was a
[1:27:29] furtherance of the Son of God age under
[1:27:31] the dispensation of the Son of God it
[1:27:33] wasn't the true baptism of the Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost it was a
[1:27:37] substitute you see that it was a
[1:27:39] substitute because the word hadn't been
[1:27:43] restored what's the beauty of this the
[1:27:45] whole thing was waiting on the word and
[1:27:48] when the word comes the substitutes
[1:27:51] won't work no
[1:27:53] more now that matters to you more than
[1:27:56] you know let me just let me give you a
[1:27:58] phrase now let's get them to the Lord
[1:28:01] and then get them to the
[1:28:03] message now let's rephrase that let's
[1:28:06] get them to the
[1:28:08] substitute and then see if we can get
[1:28:10] them to the real that's like standing in
[1:28:13] the days of John the Baptist and saying
[1:28:15] let's take them to Mosaic law all right
[1:28:18] to see if we can introduce them to the
[1:28:19] present word come on come on so preacher
[1:28:22] what are you saying what I'm trying to
[1:28:24] be clear as I know how the message of
[1:28:27] the hour is not something different than
[1:28:30] the original
[1:28:33] word everything through the church Ages
[1:28:36] was a substitute until the original came
[1:28:40] this is the original thought God had
[1:28:43] concerning the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:46] what is it it is the original thought
[1:28:49] come on everything else was a substitute
[1:28:52] until the word broke open and now by the
[1:28:55] third pool you're seeing what God really
[1:28:58] had in his mind to begin with this is
[1:29:00] the real thought God had this is not a
[1:29:03] substitute this is the resurrection of
[1:29:06] the reality of almighty God you are
[1:29:09] looking at the real real reality of what
[1:29:12] God thought in the beginning we have
[1:29:14] returned to the true baptism of the Holy
[1:29:17] Ghost listen Church it is the adoption
[1:29:20] of the church it is the Manifest St
[1:29:22] ation of the son of man it is a bride
[1:29:24] age a harvest age a son of man age an
[1:29:27] adoption age it's any kind of age am
[1:29:30] it's the fullness of the ages in one
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:37] moment what are we talking about we're
[1:29:39] talking about the will of
[1:29:42] God a prophet came to reveal the will of
[1:29:47] God concerning your life the original
[1:29:50] will think of it they missed
[1:29:54] it now let me let me let me just give
[1:29:56] you what a prophet said in the third
[1:29:58] seal it's always powerful he said that
[1:30:00] see the bride hasn't had a Revival yet
[1:30:03] there's been no Revival no manifestation
[1:30:05] of God back there to wake that bride up
[1:30:07] we're looking for it it'll take the
[1:30:09] seven on none Thunders now it says it
[1:30:11] take Revelations 10 let's just say it
[1:30:12] like that so you can get it what it'll
[1:30:14] take to have Revival now is Revelations
[1:30:17] 10 because the substitutes have come all
[1:30:19] the way up all right to the word you see
[1:30:23] that the substitutes brought us all the
[1:30:26] way to the Reformation of gifts but not
[1:30:28] the word so the only way to break into a
[1:30:31] Revival past the Reformation of gifts
[1:30:34] was the word would come and when the
[1:30:36] restoration of the word would be a
[1:30:39] restoration of power when you restore
[1:30:41] the word you restore the church back to
[1:30:44] its original condition I tell you what
[1:30:46] don't you look back and say I wish we
[1:30:48] was like they used to be listen this
[1:30:50] bride has went all the way back to the
[1:30:54] back to the book of Acts back to the day
[1:30:56] of Pentecost amen but also back to the
[1:30:58] Garden of Eden when Eve stepped out of
[1:31:01] the will of God now there she is walking
[1:31:04] back in the will of God by the power of
[1:31:07] God what is it amen there's been no
[1:31:10] manifestation of the Bride now now you
[1:31:12] guys you guys got to got to bear with me
[1:31:14] saying this cuz there's a lot of
[1:31:15] revivals but brother Bram said no bride
[1:31:19] Revival third seal 19 19 63 we've
[1:31:23] already had Durban South Africa we've
[1:31:25] already had the India meetings we've
[1:31:27] already had World revivals in St Louis
[1:31:29] and and Jonesboro up in Canada around
[1:31:32] the world hundreds of thousands of
[1:31:34] Miracles have been done signs and
[1:31:36] wonders and manifestations of every kind
[1:31:38] you could think of he said but there's
[1:31:40] been nothing to wake up that bride wo
[1:31:43] brother what's it going to take to work
[1:31:45] that bride the original word and when
[1:31:48] the word is restored the bride is
[1:31:51] restored because she's a word bride of a
[1:31:54] word groom amen there will be no
[1:31:57] difference between the bride and her
[1:31:59] husband if he's the word she's the word
[1:32:02] if she's the word he's the word and how
[1:32:05] you going to have itless you got a
[1:32:07] profit Oh Glory to God we have received
[1:32:10] the word in our age hey we've returned
[1:32:13] back to manifestation of a real original
[1:32:16] bride
[1:32:18] church it's the bride on am what to
[1:32:23] restore the
[1:32:25] word I ain't even going to answer to all
[1:32:27] the intellectuals it's the word is the
[1:32:29] word intellectually listen the word
[1:32:32] without the spirit is
[1:32:34] dead on let's just dismiss all
[1:32:37] that in the beginning was the word the
[1:32:40] word was before there was written text
[1:32:42] it's Angelic right Loos of
[1:32:45] God now it's the original thought and
[1:32:47] pattern of God not a bunch of dry
[1:32:49] intellect getting together and teaching
[1:32:51] let me see what brother Bram said he
[1:32:53] said we passed out tracks but we've
[1:32:54] never had the
[1:32:57] gospel right cuz it comes with power and
[1:33:00] then he actually can you believe it
[1:33:02] Elijah making fun of preachers he he
[1:33:04] actually makes fun of them he said the
[1:33:05] preacher ain't got enough power to break
[1:33:07] an
[1:33:08] egg he said all they got is the power of
[1:33:11] argument it's intellectual power but the
[1:33:14] bride has received Rapture power they'
[1:33:17] received an anointing of the word that
[1:33:19] come from the beginning has been
[1:33:21] restored to the church the original
[1:33:23] thought process of God the bride hasn't
[1:33:25] had a Revival yet but it would take
[1:33:27] something to wake her up and brother Ram
[1:33:29] says see but if they would plead the
[1:33:31] promise it would become effective to
[1:33:34] them now you can't have Brides Revival
[1:33:37] till you know the promise of the
[1:33:40] age now now if if if all you're thinking
[1:33:43] about is the coming of the Lord as being
[1:33:45] his Corporal body and US leaving here
[1:33:48] then you're never going to see a bride's
[1:33:50] Revival because the bride's Revival is
[1:33:53] what takes place between a prophet
[1:33:55] bringing a message and the church
[1:33:57] leaving the Earth that section in there
[1:34:01] will be the ministry of the son of man
[1:34:04] Reviving the word that was written of
[1:34:07] you to begin with there Isaiah 7 Malachi
[1:34:10] Isaiah 7 was in the scripture but it was
[1:34:12] a dead letter wasn't it but it was
[1:34:14] Isaiah's words but one day we seen Jesus
[1:34:17] walking on the shores of Galilee it was
[1:34:20] the Revival of of Isaiah 7 standing
[1:34:23] there in shoe leather and people were
[1:34:25] looking for the Messiah and John was
[1:34:27] saying I'm not looking for the Messiah
[1:34:29] right there he stands come on church
[1:34:32] amen Jesus looked at philli and they
[1:34:34] said show us the father he said have I
[1:34:36] been so long with you and yet you have
[1:34:38] not known me when you see me you have
[1:34:40] seen the father amen people say well I'm
[1:34:42] looking for the bride I'm looking for
[1:34:44] the bride's revival can I say we've been
[1:34:46] so long with you and you don't know who
[1:34:49] the bride is come on Church this is
[1:34:52] God's Revival it's been written in the
[1:34:55] Bible for 2,000 years but tonight it
[1:34:58] lives it lives it walks it breathes it
[1:35:02] manifests itself this is the Revival of
[1:35:06] the word of God throughout the ages you
[1:35:08] are not a substitute you are not a
[1:35:11] partial word you are the full
[1:35:13] manifestation of the mind of God from
[1:35:15] the foundations of the
[1:35:18] world hallelujah it's the will of God
[1:35:23] hallelujah it's his will it's his will
[1:35:27] manifesting if you know the promise you
[1:35:29] can have
[1:35:31] Revival the promise is son of
[1:35:34] man that promise makes it live brother
[1:35:37] Bram said now here's the thing they're
[1:35:40] fasting and praying looking for the
[1:35:43] bride's Revival he said but see they've
[1:35:45] missed the Awakening of the
[1:35:47] Bride Revival see and Awakening of the
[1:35:51] bride are the same
[1:35:53] things we're looking for an Awakening
[1:35:56] what are we talking about the scriptures
[1:35:58] to
[1:35:59] awaken for for to
[1:36:03] live now see they didn't recognize it
[1:36:08] because they didn't know the
[1:36:11] scripture look at Jesus in that day he's
[1:36:14] fully manifesting the word and they're
[1:36:17] looking right at him right but instead
[1:36:20] of having reval
[1:36:22] they're crucifying him
[1:36:24] all they could have had the joy of the
[1:36:29] Lord the voice of the bridegroom was
[1:36:32] among them and they crucified him and
[1:36:36] they could have rejoiced in
[1:36:39] him come on church because they didn't
[1:36:42] know who he was that's why they cried
[1:36:44] out who is
[1:36:46] this yeah come on that's why they tried
[1:36:49] to that's why they tried to quiet down
[1:36:51] the church listen you ever get a you
[1:36:54] ever get a church seeing the promise of
[1:36:55] this age and you ain't got to pep her up
[1:36:59] come on all this all these people say
[1:37:01] well y'all's always pumping up the
[1:37:02] people no no and y'all got this all
[1:37:05] wrong amen if if you ever really see
[1:37:08] that the people are taught the promise
[1:37:11] amen then you you don't have to pump up
[1:37:13] a people amen what you got to do is just
[1:37:15] give them a place on come on Amen and
[1:37:19] and and you know what'll end up
[1:37:20] happening you'll end up hearing people
[1:37:21] tell you the way they told Jesus won't
[1:37:23] you calm these people down well I didn't
[1:37:25] pump them up so I don't feel like I
[1:37:28] already to have to calm them
[1:37:32] down
[1:37:34] hallu plead the promise can I read
[1:37:36] something to you here brother BR said
[1:37:37] God promised in this last day he would
[1:37:39] manifest and would vindicate his word to
[1:37:42] her and still she wouldn't do it God
[1:37:45] promised it to her by the servants the
[1:37:47] prophets God promised through Jesus
[1:37:49] Christ now if you'd like to take notes
[1:37:50] this is a good one
[1:37:51] God promised through Jesus Christ God
[1:37:54] promised through Joel God promised
[1:37:56] through Paul God promised through
[1:37:58] Malachi and God promised through John
[1:38:01] the
[1:38:02] Revelator he's telling you if you plead
[1:38:04] the promise you will see an effective
[1:38:08] Revival and he said now these promise
[1:38:10] came through these men Jesus Joel Paul
[1:38:13] Malachi
[1:38:14] John he said and Paul and he says it
[1:38:17] like this now if you want to write them
[1:38:19] down John Jes Jesus did it a promise in
[1:38:22] John
[1:38:23] 14:12 Joel promised it in Joel 238 Paul
[1:38:28] promised it in 2 Timothy 3 Malachi
[1:38:31] promised it in Malachi 4 John promised
[1:38:34] it in John in Revelation chapter 10 and
[1:38:36] Luke of course was in 17 amen now to
[1:38:39] this church what is it it's the
[1:38:41] Incarnate Word made flesh Among Us Again
[1:38:46] amen so watch what brother random says
[1:38:47] he said justification sanctification
[1:38:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word
[1:38:54] see it was the Incarnate Word he'll say
[1:38:56] it again justification made a way for
[1:38:58] sanctification it made a way for the
[1:39:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:39:02] baptism made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:39:04] itself to come right down into
[1:39:06] Perfection back to the word again to
[1:39:09] manifest itself now somebody said well
[1:39:12] you are you saying 1906 was the true Bap
[1:39:15] no it was the Shu and the bride was the
[1:39:18] seed it wasn't the real thing it was the
[1:39:21] substitute waiting for the restoration
[1:39:24] of the word look at what it is amen Amen
[1:39:27] brother B says see but we would have
[1:39:29] missed
[1:39:30] it but God called our
[1:39:33] names see we would have never seen this
[1:39:36] but when God called our names what did
[1:39:38] he do he revealed that will and brought
[1:39:41] the anointed word to us now here's the
[1:39:44] thing when you see that the Revival of
[1:39:46] this last day amen comes from the word
[1:39:50] amen look at Luke 24 when they're
[1:39:52] walking on the road to EMAs and they're
[1:39:54] with the resurrected word now they don't
[1:39:57] know who they're
[1:39:58] with they don't know who they're talking
[1:40:00] to and they're talking about the wrong
[1:40:03] things and it's apparent they said Jesus
[1:40:05] said what's this conversation you're
[1:40:06] having and why are you so sad and they
[1:40:09] said well haven't you heard of these
[1:40:10] things and he what things you talking
[1:40:12] about see not nothing in in in his
[1:40:15] message concerning the things they were
[1:40:17] describing see but then he turned them
[1:40:21] and took the prophets and the promises
[1:40:25] of this hour all right and brother man
[1:40:27] said he began with Moses and preached it
[1:40:30] through the scripture but then he took
[1:40:33] them in the little room and showed the
[1:40:34] Messiah sign and ignited their
[1:40:39] faith and that what what what happened
[1:40:41] when the promise was pled they took a
[1:40:45] Revival two of them ran all the way back
[1:40:48] to the city amen he is not dead he is
[1:40:51] alive because the promise become
[1:40:54] effective to them look when I when I say
[1:40:56] this amen that's the thing that will
[1:40:58] cause Revival in our churches in the end
[1:41:01] time it's the promise of this message
[1:41:05] it's when you see that what God Said in
[1:41:07] the word actually is
[1:41:09] happening my it'll cause a it'll cause a
[1:41:13] strength to come into the church look
[1:41:15] what he says in John 3 and verse 29 he
[1:41:18] that hath the bride is the bridegroom
[1:41:20] but the the friend of the bridegroom
[1:41:22] which standeth and heareth him rejoices
[1:41:24] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:41:26] voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:41:30] he must increase but I must
[1:41:33] decrease now look at what John's talking
[1:41:36] about he saying Jesus here is the
[1:41:38] bridegroom and he says these people are
[1:41:41] the bride he said but I'm just a friend
[1:41:43] of the bridegroom now watch here you got
[1:41:46] brother Ram standing in the same place
[1:41:47] John was standing in and he says and he
[1:41:50] re rejoiced at the voice of the
[1:41:53] bridegroom now that rejoicing was coming
[1:41:57] because the word was Vindicated among
[1:42:01] them when you see here the Josh John
[1:42:04] according to John chapter 3 it was the
[1:42:07] bridegroom's voice therefore their
[1:42:10] Joy was fulfilled when you're when when
[1:42:14] you're when you when you see the message
[1:42:17] that there's a voice in that Pillar of
[1:42:19] Fire see he didn't come just to
[1:42:24] come he came to reveal the will of
[1:42:30] God you you you see the adoption is to
[1:42:34] follow the leadership of God the sons of
[1:42:37] God are led by the spirit of God and the
[1:42:41] whole creation groaneth and waiteth
[1:42:43] until people are LED tell the
[1:42:45] manifestation of the
[1:42:47] sons how are you going to have
[1:42:49] manifested Sons until the will of God is
[1:42:53] released from his
[1:42:55] mind so no Baptist could adopt this
[1:42:59] church no lutherans could adopt the
[1:43:02] church it would take a prophet coming
[1:43:04] for our
[1:43:05] adoption that would bring a restoration
[1:43:08] of the word to bring the church into
[1:43:10] manifestation which would be the voice
[1:43:12] of God now here's the thing when the
[1:43:15] truth of the word is revealed it causes
[1:43:19] stimulating power amen
[1:43:22] brother Ram says it I I love how he says
[1:43:24] it in the third seal this whole thought
[1:43:27] line substitute to the promise it's in
[1:43:29] the third seal and in the middle of the
[1:43:31] third seal he comes down he said but I'm
[1:43:33] going to get to the good part now and he
[1:43:34] goes over to Revelation 6 and he reads
[1:43:36] it and he says it he says see there was
[1:43:39] a voice came out of the throne that said
[1:43:42] hurt not the oil and the wine and
[1:43:44] brother man said that wasn't one of the
[1:43:46] creatures that said that he said that
[1:43:48] was a lamb that said that don't hurt the
[1:43:50] oil and the wine now what's the oil
[1:43:53] brother Ram said it's a type of the
[1:43:54] spirit in the church he said what is the
[1:43:57] wine he said it is the stimulation of
[1:44:00] the revelation of the word so oil and
[1:44:03] wine go together in worship listen now
[1:44:07] now here's a word from the third seal
[1:44:09] don't hurt the oil and the wine because
[1:44:13] it was all they had left listen I I want
[1:44:16] to say tonight I I I I know I know that
[1:44:19] fanaticism comes and I I know we're
[1:44:21] living in fanatical ages amen but listen
[1:44:23] I I hear guys get up and preach against
[1:44:25] the movement of the Holy Ghost and it
[1:44:27] just Grieves me it just geves me to no
[1:44:29] in because I mean half the time oh God
[1:44:32] can can can I preach but Sean half the
[1:44:34] time the guys that are trying to
[1:44:35] straighten up the gifts in the church
[1:44:37] don't even have gifts in their church
[1:44:38] but they're watching somebody else's
[1:44:40] program and they're correcting some
[1:44:42] other Church in their church and they're
[1:44:44] killing the move of God because they're
[1:44:46] trying to correct other people other
[1:44:48] places come on Church they see somebody
[1:44:51] out there shouting so they come here
[1:44:53] amen or wherever their church is and
[1:44:54] they preach against shouting they preach
[1:44:56] against the move they preach against
[1:44:57] this and the next thing you know you
[1:44:59] can't even get enough moisture in the
[1:45:01] church to spit you go to have a meeting
[1:45:03] and everybody sits down they're scared
[1:45:04] to death something's going to be
[1:45:05] fanatical or something listen this bride
[1:45:08] will not be
[1:45:10] deceived this bride will not be deceived
[1:45:13] and we don't have to sit around like a
[1:45:14] bunch of fearful people fearing the move
[1:45:17] of God and fearing the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:19] fearing the gift of God listen there's a
[1:45:22] God that has come to set this church in
[1:45:24] order in the last day and if it gets too
[1:45:27] far out the holy spirit will do it
[1:45:31] himself come on we might as well go
[1:45:33] ahead and preach haven't we if we can
[1:45:35] get the pastors to keep from correcting
[1:45:37] all the other pastors and everybody
[1:45:38] criticizing everybody else and he
[1:45:40] watches him and he watches him and then
[1:45:42] they correct one another back and forth
[1:45:43] well I think it's time to preach to our
[1:45:45] people again amen amen if you got to
[1:45:47] shut off for streaming shut off for
[1:45:49] streaming but let's let's get back to

[1:45:54] the wine let the Holy Ghost return in
[1:45:58] power and in manifestation you know what
[1:46:01] we need we need an oldfashioned
[1:46:02] refilling of the Holy Ghost to come down

[1:47:30] need we need it back in the church these
[1:47:32] dry intellectuals that's that's coming
[1:47:34] against the move of the spirit they just
[1:47:36] need a move of the spirit in the heart
[1:47:38] they just need a Revival come on church
[1:47:41] that's all we need a Revival in the
