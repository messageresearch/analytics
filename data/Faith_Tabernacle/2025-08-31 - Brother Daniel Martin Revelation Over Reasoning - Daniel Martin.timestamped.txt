[11:07] Ask me why I'm happy. So I'll just tell
[11:11] you why. Because
[11:14] all my sins are gone.
[11:19] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[11:22] where they are, I say,
[11:26] "My sins are gone."
[11:29] Oh, there underneath the blood on the
[11:33] cross of Calvary,
[11:36] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[11:41] In the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[11:44] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[11:49] My sins are gone.
[11:51] [Music]
[11:52] Was at the old time altar where God came
[11:56] in my heart. And now
[12:00] my sins are gone.
[12:03] Oh, the Lord took full possession. The
[12:07] devil did depart. I'm glad. Are you glad
[12:11] my sins are gone?
[12:14] Oh, there underneath the light. On the
[12:18] cross of Calvary,
[12:20] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[12:25] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[12:28] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[12:33] My sins are gone.
[12:36] Now when Satan comes to tempt me and
[12:40] tries to make me doubt, I say
[12:44] my sins are gone.
[12:47] Oh, you got me into trouble, but Jesus
[12:51] got me out. I'm glad
[12:55] my sins are gone.
[12:58] Oh, there underneath the blood on the

[13:45] cross of Calvary,

[14:01] My sins are gone.
[14:03] Oh, they're underneath the blood on the
[14:07] cross of Calvary.
[14:09] As far removed as darkness is from dawn
[14:14] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[14:18] That's good enough for me. Can we sing
[14:20] that fourth verse?

[15:53] How do you describe?
[15:59] Oh, a love that course from east to west
[16:04] [Music]
[16:05] and runs as deep as it is wide.
[16:10] [Music]
[16:12] Lord, you know all our hopes
[16:17] [Music]
[16:18] and you know all our fears.
[16:22] [Music]
[16:25] Oh, and words cannot express the love we
[16:29] feel
[16:31] but we long for you to hear.
[16:34] [Music]
[16:38] So listen to our hearts
[16:42] [Music]

[17:02] Oh, and we will use the words we know to
[17:08] tell you what
[17:11] what an awesome God
[17:14] you are. When words are not enough
[17:19] to tell you of our love, Lord, listen to
[17:23] our hearts.
[17:27] Now if words could fall like rain.
[17:34] Oh, from these lips of mine.

[23:59] and I began to cry.
[24:07] And my mind just fails to know
[24:14] exactly
[24:16] why.
[24:20] Oh, I can't explain
[24:24] with tongue or pin
[24:28] the spirit's groanings
[24:31] deep within.

[29:22] Gater is he that is in me.

[30:06] roaring lion, and he's roaming to and
[30:10] fro.
[30:12] He's seeking whom he may devour. The
[30:16] Bible tells me so.
[30:20] Oh, many souls have been his prey. to
[30:24] fall in some weak hour. Oh, but God has
[30:29] promised us today his overcoming
[30:34] power. Oh yes, greater is he that is in
[30:38] me.
[30:40] Greater is he that is in me.
[30:44] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[30:48] is in the world.
[30:51] And on the day of Pentecost,
[30:55] a rushing mighty wind,
[30:58] it blew into the upper room and baptized
[31:04] all of them.
[31:06] And with a power greater than any
[31:11] earthly foe,
[31:14] oh, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[31:17] going to let the whole world know.
[31:20] Sister Janice, do you have a song?
[31:22] Greater is he that is in me. Oh, greater
[31:26] is he that is in me.
[31:29] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[31:34] is in the world.
[31:38] Amen. Are you thankful for that this
[31:40] morning? Amen.
[31:43] [Music]
[31:58] [Music]
[32:02] The crowd was great,
[32:06] but she knew
[32:08] she had to reach him
[32:14] far. It was her last hope of ever
[32:22] being healed.
[32:25] [Music]
[32:28] So she pressed through the crowd. She
[32:33] reached out and touched his garment.
[32:41] right there. And there
[32:45] her miracle
[32:48] was fulfilled.
[32:54] There's a miracle
[33:00] in the making.

[33:34] in the making for you today.
[33:42] Now, have you prayed and prayed and
[33:47] still you've heard no answer?
[33:54] And has your faith grown weak and you
[33:59] feel
[34:01] you're all alone.
[34:03] [Applause]
[34:06] Don't give up
[34:10] for the God you serve. He won't leave
[34:15] you.
[34:18] There's a miracle for you, my child, if
[34:23] you'll just keep holding on.
[34:30] Yes, there's a miracle,
[34:34] [Music]
[34:36] in the making.
[34:43] One just for you. The father is working
[34:48] it
[34:50] right now.
[34:52] [Applause]
[34:54] Your prayers have been heard
[34:58] and the answers on the way.
[35:05] Yes, there's a miracle
[35:10] in the making for you today.

[35:51] Amen. Are you thankful for that? There's
[35:53] a miracle on the way. Amen. Can we just
[35:56] stand to our feet?

[39:22] was more subd than any beast of the
[39:26] field which the Lord God had made. And
[39:29] he said unto the woman, ya, hath God
[39:31] said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of
[39:34] the garden." And the woman said unto the
[39:38] serpent, "We may eat of the fruit." And
[39:41] so, so she remembered what God said.
[39:44] Amen. She said, "We may eat of the fruit
[39:47] of the trees of the garden, but of the
[39:50] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[39:52] of the garden. God hath said, Ye shall
[39:56] not not eat of it, neither shall ye
[39:58] touch it, lest you die." And the serpent
[40:02] said unto the woman, "But ye shall not
[40:05] surely die. For God doth know that in
[40:09] the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
[40:12] shall be open." See, he started to
[40:15] reason with her. And ye shall shall be
[40:18] as gods, knowing good and evil. And when
[40:22] the woman saw that the tree was good for
[40:24] food, and that it was pleasant to the
[40:27] eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
[40:30] one wise, she took of the fruit thereof,
[40:33] and did eat, and gave also unto her
[40:36] husband, which uh with her, and he did
[40:41] eat. Also, if we could turn to Deuteron
[40:44] Deuteronomy
[40:46] the 28th uh chapter.
[40:54] So, she heard the voice of God tell her
[40:56] not to eat of the of the tree. Amen. But
[41:00] then Satan started to reason with her.
[41:03] Amen. So, now we turn to dut Deuteronomy
[41:06] 28:1
[41:07] and we'll read down to the seventh
[41:09] verse.
[41:11] And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt
[41:13] hearken, if thou shalt listen diligently
[41:17] unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to
[41:21] observe and do all his commandments,
[41:23] which I command thee this day. Amen. So,
[41:27] so he's saying here that if you will
[41:29] listen to his voice that if you will
[41:31] obey his voice
[41:34] then he starts reading then he starts
[41:36] telling of all the blessings that you
[41:38] will receive if you hearken unto his
[41:40] voice. He says, "Which I command God
[41:43] with thee, uh, that will set thee," he
[41:45] said, "The Lord thy God will set thee on
[41:48] on high above all nations of the earth,
[41:51] and all these blessings shall come on
[41:54] thee, and overtake thee. And if thou
[41:56] shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord
[41:58] thy God, blessed shalt thou be in the
[42:01] city, and blessed shalt thou be in the
[42:04] field." Amen. Blessed shall be the fruit
[42:07] of thy body, and the fruit of thy
[42:09] ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the
[42:11] increase of thy kind, and all the flocks
[42:14] thy the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed
[42:17] shall be the ba thy basket in thy store.
[42:21] Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest
[42:23] in, and blessed shalt thou be thou goest
[42:25] out. The Lord shall cause thine enemies
[42:28] that rise up against thee to be smitten
[42:31] before thy face.
[42:33] They shall come out against thee one way
[42:36] and flee before thee seven ways. Amen.
[42:39] Can we just bow our heads for a moment?
[42:42] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we just
[42:44] count it an honor and a privilege, Lord,
[42:46] to to come into your house, Lord, once
[42:49] again to hear your word, Father, Lord,
[42:51] to give you worship. And Lord, I pray
[42:54] that you uh just felt welcome, Lord,
[42:57] here this morning. And I pray that you
[42:59] would just have your way, Lord. But I
[43:01] pray that you would just speak, Lord, to
[43:02] the to the hearts of your people, Lord.
[43:05] I pray that you would just uh move in a
[43:08] special way, Lord. Just just walk down
[43:10] these aisles, Lord, and just touch every
[43:13] heart, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would
[43:15] just give us the revelation of your word
[43:17] this morning, Lord. Lord, let let us not
[43:20] be just hearers only, Lord, but doers,
[43:23] Father, Lord, of your word. Lord, we
[43:25] love you. We thank you for all that
[43:27] you've done, Lord. We ask it all in your
[43:29] name, Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You can
[43:33] be seated.
[43:37] Amen. I'd like to um
[43:41] Amen. So, the scripture we just read, it
[43:43] was speaking to Israel. Amen. If you'd
[43:47] hearken to the voice
[43:50] uh if you would hearken to the voice of
[43:52] God, it was speaking to Israel there,
[43:54] the natural seed of Abraham in that day.
[43:58] Amen. But this scripture scripture
[44:00] actually pertains more to us as we are
[44:03] the spiritual or the supernatural seed
[44:06] of Abraham. Amen. And I was reading it
[44:09] the other day and and I I um it actually
[44:13] I it uh I get a scripture every morning
[44:17] at at 8. My phone sends me a scripture
[44:19] and I was reading it and I and I read
[44:22] the first couple verses and it just
[44:23] blessed me. So, I opened it up and I
[44:25] just I read the whole thing and and so
[44:28] uh but but it says that if we would just
[44:31] hearken to the voice of God and not
[44:34] reason with it, it says these blessings
[44:37] shall come to us. Amen. And I just love
[44:39] that this morning, all the benefits of
[44:41] God belong to us. Amen. And if I were to
[44:45] uh give a title, I I couldn't think of
[44:47] what to title it, so I just I title it
[44:50] revelation over reasoning. Amen. And so
[44:53] we need revelation in this day. Amen.
[44:56] And brother Brandham says we should pray
[44:58] for revelation more than anything. More
[45:01] than anything we should pray for
[45:02] revelation. And I know I I mentioned
[45:05] this a lot, but but as we know as we
[45:08] were reading in the opening scripture
[45:09] there that Adam and Eve were in perfect
[45:11] harmony with God. Amen. Do you believe
[45:14] that they were in perfect harmony with
[45:16] God? They were one with God. And brother
[45:18] Brandham says in the message oneness.
[45:21] Now when Adam and Eve listened to the
[45:24] lie of the devil, the holy image of God
[45:26] left them. Their fellowship was broken
[45:29] with God. Their fellowship of oneness
[45:32] with God was broken. My all because they
[45:35] they listened to what the devil had to
[45:37] say. Amen. Their fellowship of oneness
[45:40] was broken with God. And I want you to
[45:42] catch this now. The very minute they
[45:45] listen to the lie of the devil, he says
[45:47] that broke their fellowship. And the
[45:50] very minute that you listen to the lie
[45:52] of the devil, it'll break your
[45:54] fellowship. And that that's the very
[45:57] minute that you go out of the presence
[45:59] of God like she did is when you fail to
[46:02] take God's word as just as it is. Amen.
[46:06] So we know that there are many voices in
[46:09] the world today. My we have so many
[46:12] voices out there. Uh there's voices of
[46:14] entertainment. There's there's voices of
[46:17] comedy. There's there's so many voices.
[46:20] All the junk on TV and and the movies.
[46:24] There's there's voices in the politics.
[46:26] There's there's voices of fashion. And
[46:29] and these voices are trying to creep its
[46:31] way into the church. Amen. They're
[46:33] trying it's trying to Satan is trying to
[46:36] to uh to squeeze us in here. And there
[46:39] are so many voices in the world, so many
[46:42] things to attract our attention away
[46:44] from God. Amen. And and and how do we
[46:48] recognize the voice of Satan? Brother
[46:50] Brandham says Satan's voice is anything
[46:53] that is contrary to the voice of God.
[46:56] Amen. Anything that is contrary to the
[46:59] voice of God is a lie. Amen. And Satan
[47:02] has one purpose in his mind, and that's
[47:05] to get you to disbelieve God's word.
[47:08] Amen. Do you believe that? Satan is
[47:10] trying to get you to reason with God's
[47:12] word. Amen. And brother Brandham says,
[47:15] "No wonder the voice of God is a rare
[47:17] thing today. It's smothered out by so
[47:19] many different voices. So many things
[47:21] that dam and take away. It's got to a
[47:24] place until it dulls our senses, until
[47:27] we can't hear the voice of God." But but
[47:30] then he goes on to say, "Oh, but in the
[47:32] midst of all of that, in the midst of
[47:35] all of these voices, in spite of every
[47:37] dueling and every voice that's in the
[47:39] world today, some of them has pleasure
[47:42] voices. Some of them are sinful voices
[47:44] to lure the people. But in spite of
[47:47] every bit of that, the truth of God
[47:50] still remains. Amen. He that will hear
[47:52] my voice and come after me, men and
[47:55] women will hear the voice of God, God
[47:58] still wants to speak to every individual
[48:00] that'll open their ears to hear God's
[48:03] voice. Oh my.
[48:06] Amen. And now, what is that voice of
[48:09] God? The voice of God is the word of
[48:12] God. Amen. The voice of God is his word.
[48:15] John 5:24. Listen to this. Verily,
[48:18] verily, I say unto you, he that heareth
[48:22] my voice. Amen. He that He that heareth
[48:25] my voice, he that understandeth my voice
[48:28] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[48:30] ever have everlasting life, and shall
[48:32] not come into condemnation, but is
[48:35] passed from death unto life. Amen.
[48:38] Brother Brandham says, I've got a lot of
[48:39] quotes here, so you just have to bear
[48:41] with me. Brother Brandham says, "Now, I
[48:43] could walk out here and say to the
[48:44] drunker, do you believe?" Sure. A man
[48:47] with a with another's wife, do you
[48:49] believe? Sure. Did you sit in the
[48:51] meeting last night to hear the word?
[48:52] Sure. You believe it? Sure. He is saying
[48:55] that. Uh but the original interpretation
[48:59] of this word, he that understandeth my
[49:02] word. So you can go down the street and
[49:04] you ask, did you hear his word? Oh yeah,
[49:06] I heard his word. Well, did you sit in
[49:08] church this morning? Yes, I sat in
[49:09] church and I and I listen and so so he
[49:12] is saying that he that understandeth my
[49:14] word and will believe on him that sent
[49:17] me, he that understandeth, that is who
[49:19] it's made known to. Amen. Jesus said,
[49:22] "No man can come to me except my father
[49:24] first hath draw him." Amen. And all that
[49:28] my father hath given me, they will come.
[49:31] My sheep, my doves, hear my voice. A
[49:35] stranger will not follow. And what is
[49:37] the voice of God? It is the word of God.
[49:40] That's any man's voice. But what's any
[49:42] man's voice but his word? It's the word
[49:45] of God. They shall hear the word of God.
[49:49] Amen. And how do we hear? How do we
[49:52] understand the word of God? Amen.
[49:54] Spiritual revelation. Amen. And and God
[49:58] can only give the revelation. And we've
[50:00] got all kinds of uh Bible seminars.
[50:03] We've got all kinds of of Bible
[50:05] colleges. We've got all kinds of uh of
[50:08] people putting on big conventions and
[50:11] and we've got apps on our phones now and
[50:14] and all of these things are trying
[50:15] they're trying to understand the voice
[50:18] of God and and understand his word.
[50:20] They're trying to understand who Christ
[50:22] actually is. So they begin to reason
[50:25] with it. Well, we don't understand it.
[50:27] So they put their own ideas in it. Well,
[50:29] we don't understand it here. So they
[50:30] just add things to it or they take away
[50:33] things from it. My. So they begin to
[50:35] reason with it and it's only taken the
[50:37] people further and further away from
[50:39] God. Oh my. But the Bible and the church
[50:43] is absolutely a revelation. Amen.
[50:46] Matthew 16:E3
[50:49] says when Jesus came into the coast of
[50:51] uh of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his
[50:55] disciples saying whom do men say that
[50:57] the son of man am? And they said, "Some
[50:59] say thou art John the Baptist. Some say
[51:01] Elijah Elias and and others say Jeremiah
[51:05] or one of the prophets." And he said
[51:07] unto them, "But who do you say that I
[51:09] am?" And Simon Peter answered and said,
[51:12] "But thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[51:14] living God." And Jesus answered and said
[51:17] unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
[51:19] Barjona. Blessed art thou, Simon
[51:22] Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not
[51:25] revealed it unto thee. schools didn't
[51:28] reveal it unto thee. Uh denominational
[51:31] ideas didn't reveal it unto thee. These
[51:33] colleges didn't reveal it unto thee. But
[51:36] my father which is in heaven hath
[51:38] revealed it unto thee. Oh my. And I say
[51:42] also unto them, thou art Peter, and upon
[51:44] this rock. Oh, you got the Catholic over
[51:47] here trying to raise Peter up. But over
[51:49] here he says, "And I say unto thee, thou
[51:52] art Peter, and upon this rock, upon this
[51:55] revelation, I will build my church, and
[51:58] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[52:01] against it." Oh my, are you thankful for
[52:04] that this morning? Amen. Satan hates
[52:07] revelation. Satan hates this revelation.
[52:10] Brother Brandham says, "Why does he hate
[52:12] revelation?" Why is he so against
[52:14] revelation? is because that the entire
[52:18] cannon of God's word and God's church is
[52:21] solemnly built upon revelation.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; And another place, brother Brennham
[52:28] says, "The devil hates every bit of
[52:30] scripture there is, but he hates worse,
[52:32] Genesis and Revelations." He attacks
[52:35] Genesis because the authent authenticity
[52:38] of it because he wants to make the
[52:39] people believe that it wasn't so. He's
[52:42] trying to tell people, "Oh, well, it was
[52:43] just a fruit. Oh man, that that never
[52:46] happened. And and and he's trying to get
[52:48] the people to to reason with it. Amen.
[52:51] And Genesis didn't come about the way
[52:53] that God said they did. And and had
[52:56] something else caused this creation.
[52:57] They say it was a great big bang and and
[53:00] all these things. Then he attacks it
[53:02] that way. And he attacks the people away
[53:04] from revelation because it reveals Jesus
[53:07] as being God and him being the devil.
[53:10] Amen. And he's doomed. Brother Brandham
[53:12] says he is doomed. And the glory of of
[53:15] the sanctified church is going home to
[53:17] God. And the doom of the false prophets
[53:20] and all them that lie and do everything
[53:22] and do everything going to is going to
[53:25] be cast into a lake of fire.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Satan knows his ending.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Satan knows he's done. Satan knows he's
[53:34] doomed.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Another place he says what he
[53:40] started out with with in Genesis, he
[53:42] will finish in Revelations.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why he hates
[53:46] Revelation. The word of God exposes the
[53:49] devil. The word of God exposes who the
[53:52] devil is. Amen. It tells what he is. So
[53:54] what is he what does Satan do? He tries
[53:57] to cause confusion. Amen. He's trying to
[53:59] get the people to reason with the word
[54:01] of God. Amen. It started in the
[54:03] beginning of time and it's still his
[54:05] tactic today. Amen. He's got one purpose
[54:08] in mind and that's to destroy you. Amen.
[54:11] This uh the thief cometh not but to
[54:14] steal. Amen. John 10:10 says the thief
[54:17] cometh not. Satan cometh not but for to
[54:20] steal and to kill and destroy. Amen. But
[54:23] I have come that they might have life
[54:25] and that they might have it more
[54:27] abundantly.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; We look back to the garden. Eve stopped
[54:34] to reason
[54:36] when she quoted the word to him, "God
[54:38] said, 'You should not eat thereof, for
[54:40] the day you eat thereof, that day we
[54:42] die." So, she's quoting the word to
[54:45] Satan. She's telling Satan what God
[54:48] said. And Satan, listen to this now.
[54:51] Satan never disagreed with her cuz Satan
[54:56] knows that the word of God is true. So,
[54:59] he didn't he didn't say, "Oh, no. I
[55:02] don't think that's right." He didn't say
[55:04] that at all. Satan never disagreed with
[55:06] her. He said, "Certainly." That's right.
[55:09] But he said, "You see, you need some new
[55:12] light." Oh my.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He always tries to make the grass
[55:17] greener on the other side of the fence.
[55:19] Oh man. But he says, "You see, you need
[55:22] some new light. Something a little
[55:23] different from what God said. And if you
[55:26] do it, you'll just be a little smarter.
[55:28] Your eyes will be open." But she said,
[55:30] "Well, God said, but we will die." And
[55:33] he said, "Oh, surely." See, there you
[55:36] come. Just that much. Surely you won't
[55:39] die. See, just one word. That's all it
[55:43] took. And it caused a separation.
[55:47] Just one word. Just one word caused a
[55:50] separation between God and man.
[55:54] And he said, "Oh, surely you won't die."
[55:56] And it caused a separation. Anything
[55:58] that is contrary to the word of God is
[56:01] nothing but a devil. Anything that is
[56:04] contrary to the word of God is a lie.
[56:08] Amen.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; I don't care.
[56:11] I don't care if your mommy said she had
[56:13] a greater revelation. I don't care if
[56:16] your daddy said she he had a greater
[56:18] revelation. I don't care if your
[56:20] favorite preacher said he had a greater
[56:22] revelation. If it's contrary to what God
[56:25] said that it's false, that it's a lie,
[56:29] that it's of the devil.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Take God at his word.
[56:35] Now, sin had caused a separation between
[56:37] God and man. Brother Brandham says,
[56:40] "Adam tried to make himself a way back
[56:42] to God."
[56:45] He tried to make a way back to God by
[56:47] covering himself with fig leaves.
[56:49] Brother Brandham says it was a religion.
[56:52] Amen. He tried to cover himself with the
[56:55] his own religion, making himself he was
[56:57] trying to make salvation without an
[57:00] atonement.
[57:01] And brother Brandham says it worked as
[57:04] long as God wasn't around. Oh my, it
[57:08] worked as long as God wasn't around. And
[57:10] we find that man still doing the same
[57:13] thing today. They're joining a church.
[57:15] or putting his name on a book, trying to
[57:16] find a way, saying a few prayers a
[57:18] certain way or repeat repeating a couple
[57:21] of creeds, trying to find salvation
[57:24] without an atonement.
[57:26] They were driven from the garden because
[57:28] of transgression. All the blessings, all
[57:32] the blessings that we were talking about
[57:34] has been cut off because of
[57:36] transgression. But brother Brennham says
[57:39] in another place he goes, "So there I
[57:41] can imagine seeing the poor little Eve
[57:45] when she looked at Adam, her long blonde
[57:47] hair hanging down her back, those big
[57:51] bright blue eyes that looked looked like
[57:53] the the skies
[57:55] where God had made them. The tears
[57:58] pouring down mixing with the blood on
[58:00] the garments. Oh my. Flapping down
[58:04] around her body. Amen. So they gave her
[58:07] the fig leaves. Adam had tried putting
[58:09] on fig leaves,
[58:11] but God knew that wasn't going to work.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; There had to come a death. Amen. There
[58:16] had to come there had something had to
[58:18] die. So what did he do? He killed a lamb
[58:20] and he clothed them with the blood of
[58:23] the sheep's kids. And brother Brandham
[58:25] says, "And as they were walking out and
[58:29] tears pouring down, mixing with the
[58:31] blood on the garments and flapping down
[58:33] around her body, Adam with his strong
[58:35] body caught caught her and leaned over
[58:38] and put his b caught her and leaned her
[58:41] over on his bosom. And there there the
[58:45] tears mingling, falling as it ran
[58:47] through the sheep skins. Blood dripping
[58:49] down, blood all the way there. Now he
[58:52] says, "You have to depart out of my
[58:55] presence." And I can see Adam and Eve
[58:58] with their arms around one another going
[59:01] and moving out like this. Them old sheep
[59:04] skins flopping around their legs, bloody
[59:08] beating on their leg. Brother Brandham
[59:10] claps his hands together. And then I can
[59:13] see all the space which was God had no
[59:17] beginning of days, ending of years. He's
[59:19] forever and ever. And I can see all that
[59:22] great space between them. As Adam was
[59:25] walking away, Eve was walking away. God
[59:27] was sitting there watching them go the
[59:29] other way, watching that blood garments
[59:32] just beating on their legs as they were
[59:34] going away. Amen. And he couldn't stand
[59:38] it. He moved down. Oh, he moved down to
[59:40] it moved down to the very heart of God.
[59:43] And it spelled L O V E. God so loved he
[59:47] just couldn't see them go. He called
[59:50] them back and he says, "I'm going to put
[59:51] enmity between your seed and the Satan's
[59:55] seed." Amen. That's it, church. It
[59:58] wasn't just some kind of religion.
[1:00:01] It wasn't uh some man's ideas. It It's
[1:00:04] the bloody bleeding lamb. Amen. And if
[1:00:07] it was the budding bleeding lamb back
[1:00:09] there, then there's got to be the blood
[1:00:11] today.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Reasoning will say just shake the
[1:00:16] preacher's hand. Reasoning will say just
[1:00:19] sign a creed. Reasoning will say uh go
[1:00:22] by the way a man's ideas. Reasoning will
[1:00:25] say just be just be a church hopper and
[1:00:28] keep going until you find something that
[1:00:30] pleases you. Just keep going till they
[1:00:32] till you find something that suits your
[1:00:34] needs and till you feel accepted. But
[1:00:37] it's by revelation.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my revelation says it was the
[1:00:42] bleeding bloody bleeding lamb.
[1:00:46] That's right.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Stay with Revelation of God's word. And
[1:00:51] until you come under that atonement, you
[1:00:53] will remain a sinner, separated from
[1:00:56] God.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to catch the
[1:00:59] revelation.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11:4
[1:01:03] says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a
[1:01:06] more excellent sacrifice than Cain."
[1:01:09] Brother Brham says, "Cain worshiped."
[1:01:11] Cain built him a church and an altar.
[1:01:14] Cain worshiped at the altar. Cain made a
[1:01:17] sacrifice. He was just as religious as
[1:01:21] Abel was.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Cain was just as religious as Abel was.
[1:01:26] But Cain brought works, fruit of the
[1:01:29] field, fruits of the field, and laid
[1:01:32] them on the altar. Now, surely Cain
[1:01:34] thought that that's what uh brought us
[1:01:36] out of the Garden of Eden, fruit,
[1:01:38] something that I have to toil and bring
[1:01:40] back. And now he did it by a natural
[1:01:43] view. knowing that the tree was a
[1:01:45] forbidden fruit. So he brought fruit
[1:01:48] back and laid it on the altar.
[1:01:52] But Abel
[1:01:54] by spiritual revelation
[1:01:56] revealed to him by God through his faith
[1:01:59] that it was not fruit. It was the blood
[1:02:02] that caused it. So by spiritual
[1:02:05] revelation at the first church buildings
[1:02:08] that was ever made, the first altar
[1:02:10] directed there was a pro and a con. able
[1:02:13] by spiritual revelation. So there was no
[1:02:16] written word of God revealed to him that
[1:02:18] it was not the fruits or the works of
[1:02:20] your hands. He brought blood and offered
[1:02:23] blood and it testified for him that he
[1:02:26] was righteous because it was spiritually
[1:02:28] revealed to him.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Abel didn't have scriptures to go back
[1:02:34] to and look. But God gave him the
[1:02:37] revelation. God gave him a spiritual
[1:02:40] revelation that it was by the blood and
[1:02:42] not fruit.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Cain had reason. Cain had reason with
[1:02:48] the word and God rejected him for it.
[1:02:52] Amen. Abel had revelation given by God
[1:02:55] that it was the blood signifying that
[1:02:58] one day that one day there would come
[1:03:01] another bloody bleeding lamb. Amen.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. a redeemer that would
[1:03:07] break the separation of sin and bring us
[1:03:09] back to the presence of God. Amen. And
[1:03:12] that's why Satan is so against
[1:03:13] revelation.
[1:03:15] Anything that's revealed, spiritual
[1:03:16] revelation, Satan is against it because
[1:03:19] he knows that once you catch the
[1:03:21] revelation, you will become an
[1:03:23] invincible army. Once you catch the
[1:03:25] revelation, once you know who you are in
[1:03:28] Christ, once you know what Christ has
[1:03:30] done for you, you will become an
[1:03:32] invincible army.
[1:03:35] Oh my. Amen. How many believes that the
[1:03:38] word of the Lord comes to a prophet?
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says John was the
[1:03:43] greatest of all the prophets because the
[1:03:45] rest of them spoke of Jesus. Amen. Since
[1:03:49] Eden, since the garden, they all spoke
[1:03:51] of a of a of a lamb to come. They all
[1:03:54] spoke of Jesus to come. And all them
[1:03:56] look forward to his coming. All them
[1:03:58] look forward to this great time. But
[1:03:59] John says, "Behold the lamb of God that
[1:04:03] taketh away the sin of the world." He
[1:04:05] intro he introduced the world, the
[1:04:07] Messiah that he had been pro that that
[1:04:11] had been prophesied since Eden. He was
[1:04:13] the forerunner of the Lord Jesus. So we
[1:04:16] know that that that John the Baptist was
[1:04:18] the first forerunner of Christ. Amen. To
[1:04:21] prepare the way. And all the prophets
[1:04:23] spoke
[1:04:25] about what was now made manifest through
[1:04:27] a body of Jesus Christ. And yet the
[1:04:30] people didn't recognize it. Oh my. Oh,
[1:04:33] they they they were religious people.
[1:04:36] And man, the Pharisees and the
[1:04:37] Sadducees, they they were all religious
[1:04:40] people. They knew the scrolls. They but
[1:04:42] they lacked revelation. They believed
[1:04:44] and followed the teaching of Moses. And
[1:04:46] Moses's message was great for his day.
[1:04:49] But when Christ came, they failed to
[1:04:52] recognize Christ in their day.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the only way we can know
[1:04:57] God is by revelation. The only way we
[1:05:00] can know God is by spiritual revelation
[1:05:03] by the Holy Ghost. Amen. 1 Corinthians
[1:05:05] 12 verse three says and that no man can
[1:05:09] say just break it in here that no man
[1:05:12] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[1:05:15] the Holy Ghost. No man can say that
[1:05:18] Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:21] Amen. And that's why it's so important
[1:05:23] that we know without a shadow of a doubt
[1:05:26] that we are filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:28] It is important that our children get
[1:05:30] the Holy Ghost. It's important that we
[1:05:33] as parents stay under the influence of
[1:05:36] the Holy Ghost. Amen. It's the grad
[1:05:39] revelation in your life. Amen. John 14
[1:05:43] verse 15 says, "And if you love me, keep
[1:05:46] my commandments and I will pray the
[1:05:48] father, he shall give you another
[1:05:50] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:05:52] forever. Even the spirit of truth whom
[1:05:54] the world cannot receive." They can't
[1:05:56] receive it because it see because it
[1:05:59] seeth him not. They don't understand,
[1:06:02] neither knoweth him, but ye know him,
[1:06:05] for he dwelleth with you, and shall be
[1:06:07] in you, and I will not leave you
[1:06:09] comfortless. I will come to you. Amen.
[1:06:13] Yet a little while the world seeth me no
[1:06:15] more, but ye shall see me, because I
[1:06:17] live, you shall live also. And at that
[1:06:20] day ye shall know that I am in the
[1:06:22] Father, and ye in me, and I in you. What
[1:06:26] a revelation.
[1:06:28] Oh my. Peter told everyone to repent and
[1:06:30] be baptized that they should receive the
[1:06:33] gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise
[1:06:35] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:06:39] them that are far off, even as many as
[1:06:41] the Lord our God shall call. And the
[1:06:43] same Holy Ghost, the same Holy Ghost
[1:06:46] that fell on the day of Pentecost, is
[1:06:49] the same same Holy Ghost that is fallen
[1:06:53] on you. Oh my.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost that fell on
[1:06:58] Pentecost is real for the church
[1:07:01] tonight.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Don't reason with it. Don't reason with
[1:07:05] the God's word. Amen. Just believe it.
[1:07:08] Just accept it and believe his word.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; What is faith? Brother, Brother Brandham
[1:07:14] says,
[1:07:16] "Now faith is a revelation from God."
[1:07:19] Now, faith is a revelation. There's
[1:07:21] where I want to stay there just a
[1:07:23] moment. It's a revelation. He has
[1:07:25] revealed it to you by his grace. It's
[1:07:28] nothing you did. It's nothing than
[1:07:30] nothing you did. You didn't work
[1:07:32] yourself up to into faith. You ever have
[1:07:35] faith, it's given to you by the grace of
[1:07:37] God. And God reveals it to you.
[1:07:39] Therefore, faith is a revelation. And
[1:07:42] the whole church of God is built upon
[1:07:46] revelation. Brother Bronham says, "A
[1:07:49] Baptist minister told me not long ago,
[1:07:50] he says, I just can't accept
[1:07:53] revelation." I said, "Then you can't
[1:07:56] accept the Bible. You cannot accept
[1:07:59] Christ because he is the revelation of
[1:08:03] God." Amen. He's God revealed in flesh.
[1:08:06] Therefore, the whole church is built on
[1:08:09] divi divine revelation. That's right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I hope this is making sense.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And we see that throughout time that
[1:08:21] people begin to separate themselves from
[1:08:23] God.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says we got two
[1:08:27] churches at hand this morning. One of
[1:08:28] them is the church of Pentecost that was
[1:08:30] organized at the day of organized at
[1:08:33] Pentecost by the Holy Spirit which is a
[1:08:35] spiritual birth. The second is the
[1:08:38] church of the Roman Catholic that was
[1:08:39] organized in Nia Rome and this is what
[1:08:43] and this one is an an intellectual
[1:08:46] membership from the church come come all
[1:08:49] the protestants come all the
[1:08:51] denominations so when they created that
[1:08:53] denomination there in Nia Rome that's
[1:08:56] where it first started that was the
[1:08:57] first organization amen that was the
[1:09:00] first denomination and the first church
[1:09:02] of Rome had in injected dogmas they were
[1:09:05] baptizing in the father, son, and holy
[1:09:08] ghost. And they were claiming that Jesus
[1:09:10] was born in December when he was born in
[1:09:13] the springtime, brother Brandham says. A
[1:09:15] and they were introducing this uh to the
[1:09:18] people and they started accepting that
[1:09:20] they started to reason with the word and
[1:09:22] they started organizing and and creating
[1:09:24] denomination. Amen. They were
[1:09:28] and there and they were leaning to their
[1:09:30] own understanding and they were began to
[1:09:32] reason there. And for a thousand years
[1:09:34] after Na Rome, it remained dark. Amen.
[1:09:37] That was through the dark ages. Amen.
[1:09:40] And that seed that was planted on
[1:09:42] Pentecost had basically rotted out
[1:09:44] during the dark ages. Amen. And we
[1:09:47] needed something. We needed something to
[1:09:50] bring that seed back to life. Bring it
[1:09:53] back to the original foundation that his
[1:09:56] word was built upon. Amen. Back to that
[1:09:58] original Pentecostal experience. Amen.
[1:10:02] Not a Pentecostal idea, not a
[1:10:04] Pentecostal denomination, but a
[1:10:06] Pentecostal experience as it was back on
[1:10:08] the day of Pentecost. Amen. The
[1:10:11] revelation of Jesus Christ in these last
[1:10:13] days. Amen. You take a grain of wheat.
[1:10:17] Amen. I'm not a farmer, but you take a
[1:10:20] I'm just kind of reading here what the
[1:10:22] prophet says, but you take a grain of
[1:10:24] wheat and you plant it and you watch it
[1:10:25] grow. You have to stock the shack. And
[1:10:28] when it pulled away the shock, when you
[1:10:30] pulled away the shock, there is the
[1:10:31] grain. There is there is the actual
[1:10:34] grain right there. The the the real
[1:10:36] thing. And when Martin Luther came being
[1:10:38] the stalk, he was given the revelation
[1:10:40] of justification. They shall live by
[1:10:42] faith. And there that seed started to
[1:10:45] take form. And then come Wesley, him
[1:10:48] being the tallest sanctification. And
[1:10:50] that seed still started to grow. Amen.
[1:10:53] It wasn't the real thing yet, but it
[1:10:55] started to grow. It was still growing.
[1:10:57] Amen. And now when we come into Leodysy,
[1:11:00] a church age, Pentecost, restoration of
[1:11:03] the gifts, that that being the shack,
[1:11:06] which is the next stage of the coming
[1:11:08] forth of the grain.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yet the church world went on building
[1:11:12] denominations. They went on building
[1:11:14] their own ideas. They went on building
[1:11:17] off of their own creeds and their own
[1:11:19] dogmas. Amen. And they they went on.
[1:11:21] They heard justification and they
[1:11:23] reasoned reasoned with it and they
[1:11:25] organized. Then we go a little further
[1:11:27] down with sanctification. They too
[1:11:29] reasoned with it and they organized. But
[1:11:32] the seed didn't stop growing. Oh my. I'm
[1:11:35] sorry I spilled all the water. Oh my.
[1:11:38] That seed didn't stop with Wesley. That
[1:11:40] seed didn't stop with Luther. It just
[1:11:43] kept on growing. Hallelujah. We come
[1:11:45] down on the Pentecostal age, the Leonian
[1:11:48] age, and it looked like the real thing.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; It looked like the real thing. The Amen.
[1:11:55] They were speaking in tongues. They
[1:11:56] danced. They prophesied. It looked like
[1:11:59] the real thing. Amen. Like it did in
[1:12:01] Pentecost. Amen. The Bible says it would
[1:12:04] be so close that it would almost deceive
[1:12:06] the very elect if it were possible. They
[1:12:09] had a form of godliness, but they denied
[1:12:12] the power thereof. But the life of thy
[1:12:14] she seek didn't stop there. Amen.
[1:12:17] Because God had a people reserved for
[1:12:20] his name's sake. Oh my. And there shall
[1:12:23] be light in the evening time. And God
[1:12:26] was finished with the Pentecostals.
[1:12:29] Amen. I've got to slow down here. I wish
[1:12:32] I had the voice. Amen. God was finished
[1:12:35] with the Pentecostals. So as the shack
[1:12:38] begin to pull away, now we come into the
[1:12:42] astronaut age. Now we come up just a
[1:12:45] little bit higher. Oh my, the life of
[1:12:47] God resting in his bride.
[1:12:52] Oh my, we can forget about the horse and
[1:12:55] buggy. We can we can forget about the
[1:12:58] automobile. We can forget the ideas of
[1:13:00] the airplane. We are now astronauts.
[1:13:04] Amen. We're flying higher than
[1:13:06] denominations. We're flying higher than
[1:13:09] creeds and man's ideas. We're flying
[1:13:12] higher than unbelief. Amen. Brother
[1:13:14] Brandham says as he was baptizing, the
[1:13:17] spirit of the Lord spoke to him and
[1:13:18] said, "As John the Baptist was sent for
[1:13:22] the forerunner of the first coming of
[1:13:23] Jesus Christ, your message will bring
[1:13:27] the second coming of Jesus Christ."
[1:13:29] Amen. Fulfilling Malachi 4. Amen.
[1:13:32] Brother Brandham didn't come with a
[1:13:34] message to make us feel good. Amen. This
[1:13:37] message was sent to the leot uh this
[1:13:39] message wasn't sent to Leoa to only
[1:13:43] organize another religion. It was sent
[1:13:45] to us in the in these last days because
[1:13:48] God promised he would restore us back to
[1:13:52] him.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Back to the original Pentecostal
[1:13:56] experience.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That where I am, you may be there
[1:14:01] also.
[1:14:02] Amen. This message came to get our eyes
[1:14:05] off of the denominational ideas. This
[1:14:07] message came to get our eyes off of
[1:14:09] creeds and dogmas and point us to the
[1:14:12] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was sent to get a bride ready
[1:14:18] to meet our bridegroom.
[1:14:20] Amen. It was sealed up. No one could
[1:14:23] open it. The shields were sealed. No one
[1:14:26] could open it. No one was worthy. But
[1:14:28] now in these last days, that seal has
[1:14:31] been broken.
[1:14:33] Oh my. That's it. Amen. Revealing
[1:14:36] Christ. Christ back in the church again.
[1:14:41] Making himself manifest in a in a in a
[1:14:44] people
[1:14:46] in you and me for his purpose. Amen. For
[1:14:50] his desires. Amen. What a revelation.
[1:14:55] Brother Brandham says that's why Satan
[1:14:57] is so against the ministry today because
[1:14:59] what is it? The revealing of Christ. Let
[1:15:03] the church go on with its great
[1:15:04] denomination organization. It's
[1:15:06] literally and its little flowery
[1:15:08] messages and so forth. Let them go on.
[1:15:11] Satan won't bother that. They don't have
[1:15:13] no troubles. Everybody pats them on the
[1:15:16] back. When there comes a time that God
[1:15:18] through the Holy Ghost reveals Christ
[1:15:20] back in the church with the power and
[1:15:22] demonstrations of healing the sick and
[1:15:24] making the sign and making the signs
[1:15:25] that he said would follow the believers
[1:15:28] come to pass. That's when Satan rolls
[1:15:31] over in his bed. He doesn't uh he does
[1:15:34] something about it then. But until that
[1:15:36] time, Satan don't care how much church
[1:15:38] you join. He don't care how much he
[1:15:42] don't care how many times you just come
[1:15:44] and be a benchwarmer. He don't care
[1:15:46] about that. Amen. But when Christ
[1:15:49] reveals to you that he is the son of God
[1:15:52] and the works that he did, you shall do
[1:15:55] also, not some other works, but the same
[1:15:58] works.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Satan hates that. Satan hates
[1:16:03] revelation.
[1:16:05] John 14:12 says, "Verily I say unto you,
[1:16:07] he that believeth on me, the works that
[1:16:10] I shall do, he uh shall do also, and
[1:16:14] greater works than these shall he do
[1:16:16] because I go unto my father. These shine
[1:16:19] shall follow them that believe."
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that becomes a
[1:16:24] revelation, brother, you're near the
[1:16:26] kingdom. Then on this rock, I'll build
[1:16:28] my church and the gates of hell. She
[1:16:31] cannot prevail against it because this
[1:16:33] man or woman that's ever been in the
[1:16:36] back desert alone like Moses was. And
[1:16:39] the revelation of God has been made
[1:16:41] manifest to him or her through the Holy
[1:16:44] Ghost. There is nothing that can shake
[1:16:47] him. There is nothing that can stop him.
[1:16:50] Oh my, he's just as sound and solid as
[1:16:53] he can be.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Satan hates revelation.
[1:16:59] He doesn't like it at all. It upsets his
[1:17:01] plans. Why? Because there is power in
[1:17:04] this message. He doesn't want you to
[1:17:07] catch the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:17:10] because there is power in this message.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And God hates a powerless religion. And
[1:17:17] when you can come under the presence,
[1:17:19] when you can come under the power of the
[1:17:21] revelation of this message, you have so
[1:17:24] much power. The prophet of God says you
[1:17:27] can go create a world and live on it.
[1:17:29] Amen. That's how much power you have.
[1:17:32] The power that Christ had is now living
[1:17:34] in you this morning.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says, "Satan
[1:17:41] knows that if the people can get the
[1:17:43] true revelation of the true church and
[1:17:46] what she is and what she stands for and
[1:17:50] that she can do the greater works, she
[1:17:53] will be an invincible army. Don't reason
[1:17:57] with it. Just believe it. Satan will try
[1:18:01] and get you to reason with that.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Satan will try to
[1:18:08] to reason with you. Reasoning will tell
[1:18:11] you that you're not loved.
[1:18:16] Reasoning will tell you that you're just
[1:18:18] too weak.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Reasoning will tell you that you're a
[1:18:22] failure. Reasoning will tell you that
[1:18:25] you're not strong enough. But
[1:18:28] revelation,
[1:18:29] oh my, that'll make a Baptist shout. But
[1:18:33] revelation,
[1:18:35] Revelation says you're more than
[1:18:38] overcomers through Christ Jesus.
[1:18:40] Revelation says you are love. Revelation
[1:18:44] says you were in the mind of God before
[1:18:47] the beginning of the world. Revelation
[1:18:50] says you do have a purpose.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; That's what revelation does.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It tells you who you are.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. God didn't choose you to be a
[1:19:02] Hitler.
[1:19:04] God didn't choose you to fulfill
[1:19:06] Hitler's position. He didn't choose you
[1:19:08] to be a Goliath. And now you're going to
[1:19:10] face David. God didn't choose you for
[1:19:13] that. He didn't choose you to fulfill
[1:19:15] the devil's works. He chose you for his
[1:19:18] benefits. He chose you for his purpose.
[1:19:21] He chose you to defeat Goliath. Amen. He
[1:19:24] chose you to be a devil stomping child
[1:19:28] of God this morning.
[1:19:30] Amen. He predestinated you. He's called
[1:19:33] you. Amen. He's preferred. He preserved
[1:19:37] your generation. He watched over your
[1:19:40] grandpappa. He watched over you all
[1:19:42] throughout the generations. He protected
[1:19:44] him. He protected your grandma. He
[1:19:46] protected your grandpa knowing that you
[1:19:48] would come in these last days and
[1:19:50] fulfill his desires.
[1:19:55] Oh my. It's time we let the message
[1:19:58] influence us in this age.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; It's time we let the message influence
[1:20:03] us. Oh my. For you become the word as
[1:20:06] you receive the word.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; You become the word as you receive the
[1:20:11] word. Amen. Play the tapes in your home.
[1:20:15] Play the tapes on your job. Amen. Play
[1:20:17] the tapes in your car. Never get so busy
[1:20:20] that you can't push play on a tape.
[1:20:23] Amen. There's power in those tapes.
[1:20:26] There's power in the voice of God.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; When you listen to a tape, don't let it
[1:20:33] go in one ear and out the other. Don't
[1:20:35] just push play and never really catch
[1:20:37] the revelation of what he's trying to
[1:20:39] say.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Never push a play. Never push play on a
[1:20:43] tape without asking God to reveal to you
[1:20:45] what the prophet is trying to say.
[1:20:51] Let it influence you.
[1:20:54] Let it influence your home life. Let it
[1:20:57] influence your work life. Let it
[1:20:59] influence your family.
[1:21:02] There's power in this message. There's
[1:21:04] power in the message.
[1:21:08] There was a brother I heard this this
[1:21:10] brother tell the story and he said it
[1:21:13] was okay if I shared it.
[1:21:16] But there was a brother that went to a
[1:21:17] tire shop to get his tires done on his
[1:21:20] car
[1:21:22] and he ran into someone he knew uh from
[1:21:25] church
[1:21:27] and they began to talk and asked and you
[1:21:31] know he asked the man how his how he was
[1:21:33] doing. He asked the man how his wife was
[1:21:34] doing. the brother. He asked the brother
[1:21:37] how the how he was doing and things and
[1:21:40] they began to talk and they and they
[1:21:43] just started caring this conversation
[1:21:45] and he started to to talk about his
[1:21:48] wife. He started to tell how much his
[1:21:51] wife was just a religious person. how
[1:21:54] much his wife was just was just, you
[1:21:57] know, uh
[1:22:00] just uh that his wife, you know, telling
[1:22:02] just just praising his wife. And they
[1:22:05] and as they begin to talk, the man start
[1:22:08] the gentleman started to tell the
[1:22:09] brother uh how his wife would just just
[1:22:13] constantly just listen to tapes. When
[1:22:16] she'd wake up in the morning, she would
[1:22:17] play a tape. When she'd go to bed at
[1:22:20] night, she would play a tape. when she
[1:22:22] would walk through the house, work
[1:22:24] through the house, she would play a
[1:22:25] tape. When she'd go through the grocery
[1:22:27] store, she had a play tape or a tape
[1:22:30] playing. And he said, "As a matter of
[1:22:32] fact, when I brought my wife's car in
[1:22:34] this morning, I turned on the car and
[1:22:35] there a tape started playing." And the
[1:22:39] brother was like, "Well, praise the
[1:22:40] Lord. You know, that that is wonderful.
[1:22:42] we should always play the tapes, you
[1:22:45] know, and uh she'd go to bed listening
[1:22:48] and the first thing, you know, and um he
[1:22:52] said, and so a couple days later, this
[1:22:55] brother a couple days later went to the
[1:22:57] grocery store
[1:22:59] and as he was walking through the
[1:23:00] aisles, he had seen somebody that looked
[1:23:02] familiar. So he was walking and he and
[1:23:05] he's walking, he glanced over and he
[1:23:07] seen him. So he stopped. He was like,
[1:23:08] "That looks like so and so." So he
[1:23:11] walked over there and sure enough it was
[1:23:13] the man that he was talking to a couple
[1:23:15] of days earlier and she was sitting
[1:23:18] there wearing a pair of pants. He was
[1:23:20] just sitting there bragging about how
[1:23:22] much she listens to the tapes and here
[1:23:24] she is wearing a pair of pants in the
[1:23:27] store. She was letting the message go in
[1:23:30] one ear and out the other. She knew she
[1:23:33] was listening but she wasn't hearing it.
[1:23:36] She had to play him, but she wasn't
[1:23:38] catching the revelation.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; So when you play a tape, catch the
[1:23:45] revelation of what the prophet is
[1:23:47] saying.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; It will change your life.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:23:53] Let God reveal it to you. Amen. Let let
[1:23:57] the word of God have preeminence in your
[1:23:59] life. In your home, in your car, at
[1:24:02] work. Let God have preeminence.
[1:24:06] Amen.
[1:24:08] Satan is fine with you listening to a
[1:24:09] tape every day. Satan is fine with you
[1:24:12] listening to a tape every night.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's fine with you doing that.
[1:24:16] He's fine with you with you doing that
[1:24:19] just as long as you don't start praying
[1:24:21] for revelation. He's okay with you
[1:24:23] listening to all the messages you want.
[1:24:27] But as long as you don't start getting
[1:24:28] the revelation,
[1:24:30] amen, Satan is fine with you going to
[1:24:32] church just as long as you become a
[1:24:34] benchwarmer. He's fine with you just
[1:24:36] going to church or and doing these
[1:24:39] things as long as you fall asleep. As
[1:24:41] long as you just sit there and let your
[1:24:43] mind wander, he's fine with you doing
[1:24:45] that. But as long as you don't catch the
[1:24:49] revelation of Jesus Christ, he's okay
[1:24:51] with that. But when Satan Satan loses
[1:24:55] all of his power and influence when he
[1:24:58] comes under the presence of God.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; So as long as you listen to the tapes
[1:25:04] and don't get the revelation, as long as
[1:25:06] you listen to your favorite preacher and
[1:25:08] don't get the revelation, you're okay.
[1:25:11] But when you catch the revelation, Satan
[1:25:15] is defeated.
[1:25:22] He loses all of his power and influence
[1:25:24] under the presence of God.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; So he'll try and get you to reason with
[1:25:28] the word.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; He knows how much power is in this
[1:25:31] message. He knows how much power is in
[1:25:34] God's word. So what does he do? He'll
[1:25:36] try to get you to reason with it. As
[1:25:38] long as he don't get you to get that
[1:25:40] power. Amen. He'll tell you that the
[1:25:42] days of miracles is passed. He'll say,
[1:25:45] "God can't heal cancer anymore. that God
[1:25:47] can't dissolve a kidney stone anymore,
[1:25:50] that God can't bring the dead back to
[1:25:52] life anymore. He'll tell you them things
[1:25:54] are of the past. But Revelation says
[1:25:57] that it's Jesus Christ the saying
[1:26:00] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. You
[1:26:03] can defeat every devil this morning.
[1:26:06] You've been given the keys of death,
[1:26:09] hell, and the grave.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; You've been given the keys. Amen. You
[1:26:14] don't have to feel something. You don't
[1:26:16] have to be a preacher or some great
[1:26:18] evangelist. You don't need some someone
[1:26:21] to prophesy over you. You just need a
[1:26:24] revelation.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You just need a revelation. And if you
[1:26:30] have the Holy Ghost inside your soul,
[1:26:33] see, that's the thing. A lot of people
[1:26:35] get the Holy Ghost from their flesh.
[1:26:38] It'll make them stop their lying. It'll
[1:26:39] make them stop their their their their
[1:26:42] telling the dirty jokes. make them stop
[1:26:44] watching them the dirty movies that Holy
[1:26:47] Ghost on the flesh can do that. But when
[1:26:49] you get the Holy Ghost in your soul,
[1:26:51] then you have the power and the
[1:26:53] authority to claim every promise of God
[1:26:57] this morning. Amen. You have the power
[1:27:00] to cast down them reasonings.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Sickness is under your feet this
[1:27:07] morning.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Cancer is under your feet this morning.
[1:27:14] Fear is under your feet this morning.
[1:27:17] Complexes is under your feet this
[1:27:19] morning. Catch the revelation. You're
[1:27:23] free this morning. Satan is defeated.
[1:27:28] Oh my. But as long as you keep reasoning
[1:27:31] with God and as long as you keep
[1:27:33] questioning, well, I don't know. Well,
[1:27:35] is he talking about this day? I is the
[1:27:38] promises for me in this day. You're just
[1:27:40] opening the door for Satan to come in.
[1:27:43] But resist the devil and he will flee
[1:27:46] from you.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Voices of reason says you have to wait
[1:27:51] till the millennium to be sons and
[1:27:53] daughters of God. But Revelation says
[1:27:56] you are now. You don't have to wait.
[1:27:59] Revelation says you are now sons and
[1:28:02] daughters of God. Oh my. Voices of
[1:28:05] reason will say the greatest revival was
[1:28:08] over 50 years ago. But the revelation
[1:28:10] says the greatest revival is now. We are
[1:28:15] now in the bride's revival. Oh my.
[1:28:18] Voices of reason will say you have to
[1:28:21] hear your favorite preacher to get a
[1:28:23] revival.
[1:28:25] You have to hear your favorite pastor to
[1:28:27] be in revival. Amen. Reason will say you
[1:28:30] have to go from youth camp to youth camp
[1:28:33] to be in revival. Voices of reason says
[1:28:36] you have to go to a certain pastor's
[1:28:39] church to be in revival. But Revelation
[1:28:42] says you are the revival.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; You are the revival.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; We can go on vacation and be in revival.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; We can go to work and be in revival. We
[1:29:02] can go to the grocery store and be in
[1:29:04] revival. Oh my. We can come here on a
[1:29:08] Wednesday night and be in revival.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we've been given the
[1:29:15] revelation
[1:29:16] that God is back in his church again.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:24] I pray that you can catch it this
[1:29:26] morning.
[1:29:29] You are unstoppable.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You are unbeatable this morning.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:40] As long as you keep wondering if God is
[1:29:42] here, as long as you keep looking to see
[1:29:45] if he's here, you will miss it. But once
[1:29:49] you catch the revelation,
[1:29:52] you will know that he is here.
[1:29:56] Oh my. Hear his voice calling out the
[1:30:00] message of the hour. Prove that he is
[1:30:02] among his people performing shines and
[1:30:05] wonders. Oh my goodness.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham says, "I understand
[1:30:11] that there'll come scoffer in the last
[1:30:13] days.
[1:30:15] I understand that there will be nations
[1:30:17] against nations in the last days. I
[1:30:20] understand that there will be a title
[1:30:21] wave in the last days that the musicians
[1:30:24] will come.
[1:30:25] I understand that there will be fearful
[1:30:28] sights like flying saucers in the heaven
[1:30:31] mysterious sights and men's hearts will
[1:30:34] be failing for fear.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; There will be a perplexity of time and
[1:30:39] distress amongst the people.
[1:30:41] I read that there'll be that that
[1:30:43] they'll all go into organizations and
[1:30:46] dominations and have a confederation in
[1:30:49] the in the last days. I understand that
[1:30:52] women will bob their hairs in the last
[1:30:54] days.
[1:30:55] I understand
[1:30:57] they'll wear short short clothes and
[1:30:59] walk in high heeled shoes tinkling as
[1:31:02] they go in the last days. I understand
[1:31:05] that the moral will be very low in the
[1:31:07] last days.
[1:31:11] I understand that the preachers will be
[1:31:13] false shepherds in the last days that
[1:31:15] they'll compromise and will not feed the
[1:31:17] people the word of God
[1:31:20] but will go after creeds and things
[1:31:21] instead.
[1:31:23] But I understand
[1:31:26] there'll be a voice come in the last
[1:31:28] days, crying out in the wilderness,
[1:31:32] calling the people back to the original
[1:31:35] message, back to the things of God. I
[1:31:39] understand by the book that those things
[1:31:43] will take place.
[1:31:46] I believe that's where we're at today.
[1:31:49] Do you believe that? I believe we've
[1:31:52] heard the voice in this last days and
[1:31:56] it's calling us to come up higher. Come
[1:31:59] up higher. Come up higher than the horse
[1:32:01] and buggy. Come up higher than the
[1:32:04] automobile.
[1:32:05] Come up higher in the revelation. Come
[1:32:09] up higher than the airplane.
[1:32:12] We're now eagles. We're now eagles.
[1:32:14] We're going to be sure and above the
[1:32:16] heavens.
[1:32:18] Oh my,
[1:32:21] we are a blessed people this morning.
[1:32:27] Amen. We are a blessed people.
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:36] Brother Brham says, "I understand.
[1:32:38] I understand all these things are going
[1:32:40] to come to pass. It shouldn't surprise
[1:32:42] us that they're trying to get the gays
[1:32:44] and all the pride stuff out. They're
[1:32:47] trying to just just the world is just
[1:32:49] getting worse. It shouldn't surprise us.
[1:32:50] The Bible spoke of it. But it also spoke
[1:32:54] of us. It also spoke of us in these last
[1:32:57] days that we don't we don't have to be
[1:33:00] subject to those things that we don't
[1:33:02] have to listen to reasoning.
[1:33:04] Amen. We're more than conqueror
[1:33:07] conquerors through Christ.
[1:33:09] Amen.
[1:33:13] Brother Mark, if you could could you
[1:33:15] turn that scripture uh Deuteronomy 28,
[1:33:21] I'm going to start out. I wasn't going
[1:33:23] to read it. I didn't finish reading it
[1:33:25] in our opening scripture, but we talked
[1:33:27] about the blessings of the Lord, but
[1:33:29] Deuteronomy 28:8, we'll start there. We
[1:33:33] left off at verse 7,
[1:33:36] but I just want to read what the
[1:33:37] blessings if you would just hearken to
[1:33:39] the voice of God. I wanted to read to
[1:33:41] you all the blessings that would belong
[1:33:43] to yours. It says, "The Lord shall
[1:33:45] command the blessing upon thee and thy
[1:33:47] storehouses,
[1:33:49] and all that thou setest thy thy hands
[1:33:52] unto, and he shall bless thee in the
[1:33:54] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
[1:33:58] And the Lord shall establish thee and a
[1:34:01] holy people unto himself, as he hath
[1:34:04] sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the
[1:34:07] commandments of the Lord thy God, and
[1:34:08] walk in his ways. Verse 10.
[1:34:13] And all the people of the earth shall
[1:34:15] see that thou art called by the name of
[1:34:18] the Lord, and they shall be afraid of
[1:34:21] thee. And the Lord shall make thee
[1:34:24] plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy
[1:34:26] body, and in the fruits of thy cattle,
[1:34:28] and in the fruit of thy ground, in the
[1:34:30] land which the Lord swear unto the
[1:34:32] fathers to give thee.
[1:34:35] The Lord shall open unto thee his good
[1:34:38] treasures, the heaven to give thee rain
[1:34:41] unto thy land in the season, and to
[1:34:44] bless all the work of thine hand. And
[1:34:46] thou shalt lend unto many nations, and
[1:34:49] thou shalt not borrow.
[1:34:52] And the Lord shall make thee the head,
[1:34:55] and not the tail, and thou shalt be
[1:34:57] above, and thou shalt be above only, and
[1:35:01] thou shalt not be beneath. If thou shall
[1:35:05] uh if thou hearken unto the commandments
[1:35:07] of the Lord thy God, which I command
[1:35:10] thee this day, to observe and do, and to
[1:35:13] do them,
[1:35:14] and thou shalt not go aside from any of
[1:35:17] the words which I command thee this day,
[1:35:20] to the right hand, or to the left, or go
[1:35:23] after other gods to serve them.
[1:35:28] But God has preserved you.
[1:35:31] Oh my.
[1:35:33] Oh my. I just I could just feel like I
[1:35:36] could just go on and on. Hey man, what
[1:35:40] song are we singing?
[1:35:46] My God is faithful.
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] His promise is true.
[1:35:55] So I'll speak to the mountains.
[1:36:00] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:36:03] [Music]
[1:36:06] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:36:10] greater than you.
[1:36:15] Oh,
[1:36:17] why should I worry when giants come

[1:43:50] So you just have to bear with me on
[1:43:52] that. But um you know I I pray that it
[1:43:55] blessed someone today.
[1:43:57] Amen. I know it blessed me. Amen. So we

[1:44:12] Kevin, Melissa, all them. Uh they were
[1:44:15] brother Ron's Kevin Melissa and sister
[1:44:17] Kim and John, brother John there. So
[1:44:21] let's just remember them in our prayers
[1:44:23] that the Lord would just bring everyone
[1:44:25] home safely. We want to remember those
[1:44:27] that are just not feeling well uh

[1:44:45] instead of on Wednesday. Amen. That
[1:44:48] would be a week from this coming
[1:44:49] Tuesday. So, let's just keep that in our

[1:45:26] has changed my whole life.
[1:45:32] Oh, if anybody
[1:45:36] asks you

[1:46:35] with her yesterday and um she's feeling
[1:46:39] very lonely without brother Terry being
[1:46:41] there. So let's just just remember her
[1:46:44] that the Lord would just go down and
[1:46:46] comfort or give her a blessing. Amen.
[1:46:48] Maybe we could uh just bow our heads for
[1:46:50] a moment and uh we can ask uh brother

[1:46:55] of prayer.
