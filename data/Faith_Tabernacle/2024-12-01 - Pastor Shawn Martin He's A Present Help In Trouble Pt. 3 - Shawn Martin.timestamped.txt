[49:05] though the mountains be carried into the
[49:08] midst of the
[49:09] sea though the waters thereof Roar and
[49:13] be troubled though the mountains shake
[49:16] with the swelling
[49:17] thereof Sal amen you can have your
[49:24] seats this morning
[49:27] and um I guess the past few Services we
[49:31] just kind of talked upon or use the
[49:35] title he is a present help in
[49:38] trouble and I'm glad that he is and um
[49:43] that uh it is written that we could be
[49:46] reminded of it amen that God is a help a
[49:51] present help when we think of times of
[49:54] trouble maybe we can think of many
[49:57] instances in the
[49:59] Bible where uh God was a present hell
[50:03] and we could go all the way back in the
[50:05] beginning after that Adam had
[50:08] fallen and um the holy image of God left
[50:12] him and and there he was U become a
[50:17] sinner um because of his Disobedience no
[50:21] hope um ever getting back to God no hope
[50:25] of Fellowship
[50:27] he was under that the law of god of
[50:31] death and yet God was a present help in
[50:36] the time of trouble and God provided an
[50:39] atonement we could look at Noah and how
[50:43] that God was fixing to um uh destroy the
[50:48] Earth and bring judgments upon the land
[50:51] that God was a present help to that
[50:54] righteous group that had elect Amen in
[50:58] Noah's day you can look at shamard and
[51:02] how that the enemy had been coming in
[51:05] and taking his crops and and and but God
[51:09] was a present help in the time of
[51:12] trouble and and shamard the Bible says
[51:16] he he just took an ox gold and slew 600
[51:20] I believe
[51:21] Philistines that day amen you could look
[51:24] at Rahab the Harlot and of how that um
[51:28] um Joshua coming in and and uh um
[51:32] they're going to take that City and the
[51:34] walls you know uh the people in that
[51:37] city is under judgment and uh and and
[51:41] they all knew
[51:42] it they they were quaking scared but
[51:47] there Rahab the Harlot and she didn't
[51:49] deserve Mercy but she was kind to uh the
[51:54] Servants of the Lord and God God was a
[51:57] present help in the time of trouble for
[52:00] her and and her and her family under
[52:04] that token amen was spared the three
[52:08] Hebrew children God was a present help
[52:11] the Apostle Paul when he was Shipwrecked
[52:14] there and out on that island God was a a
[52:17] a present help in the time of trouble
[52:20] see it's always been that God has has
[52:24] always been there and and I'm I'm sure
[52:26] that we could all look and and in our
[52:30] personal lives and and think of
[52:32] instances of where God was a present
[52:35] help in the time of our trouble amen and
[52:39] in the Old Testament we look and how
[52:42] that uh uh uh God was a present help to
[52:45] the nation of Israel and uh God had uh
[52:51] uh told you know uh uh Abraham that that
[52:56] he seed uh him and his seed would
[52:58] possess the gates of their enemy and
[53:01] here Israel was in bondage for 400 years
[53:04] to the Egyptians and and uh uh uh hard
[53:09] hard labor uh uh great stress and their
[53:13] backs beaten and all of these things but
[53:15] God had made an unconditional Covenant
[53:19] to to Abraham that that they would
[53:22] sojourn into this land for 400 years but
[53:26] at that time I would deliver them and so
[53:31] uh uh uh uh God had made this Covenant
[53:35] and and not only that uh uh he had given
[53:39] them a land of inheritance before they
[53:42] had ever become slaves and and uh you
[53:46] look at Deuteronomy
[53:48] 15:4 it says the Lord shall greatly
[53:51] bless thee in the land which the Lord
[53:53] thy God giveth thee for an inheritance
[53:56] an to possess it amen and and under this
[54:00] promise that God would give Abraham uh
[54:03] uh they would become a mighty nation and
[54:06] they would possess the gates of their
[54:08] enemy and and God also promised that uh
[54:12] uh the the the that they wouldn't just
[54:15] remain they wouldn't be slaves uh uh
[54:18] forever but that he would come and and
[54:21] deliver them and and so uh uh it was
[54:25] after the 400 years the 400 years
[54:28] somewhere in there that uh the Bible
[54:31] says that Israel began to cry out unto
[54:33] God uh for deliverance and and and God
[54:38] God uh the Bible says here in Exodus 2
[54:42] 24 God heard their
[54:46] groaning God heard their groaning now
[54:48] they weren't crying for you know uh a a
[54:52] a new house or a new pickup truck or
[54:55] they weren't crying about little things
[54:57] that maybe we cry about but they were
[55:00] crying for the right purpose they they
[55:03] wanted Deliverance amen from the bondage
[55:06] that they were in they they wanted a
[55:09] living God to come and and to to deliver
[55:13] them and God heard their groaning and
[55:16] God remembered his Covenant with Abraham
[55:19] with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked
[55:23] upon the children of Israel and God had
[55:26] respect unto them aren't you glad for
[55:28] that amen so God was a present help in
[55:32] the time of trouble and God delivered
[55:35] them from the hand of of the enemy amen
[55:40] now they they after they had come
[55:42] through out of Egypt now they had to
[55:45] make their Journey uh uh to the land of
[55:49] inheritance that God had given them and
[55:52] and so uh but you look at Israel Israel
[55:55] didn't come out of Egypt a well equipped
[55:58] Army a military might a military power
[56:03] uh they they were just Shepherds they
[56:05] they were defenseless and and and they
[56:08] they come out they they didn't have
[56:11] doctors they didn't have nurses they
[56:12] didn't have Medical Aid they didn't have
[56:15] anything even brother BR said they
[56:17] didn't even have Red Cross amen uh uh
[56:20] that would follow them they didn't even
[56:22] have clothed stores that that they could
[56:25] pass uh as they're they're they're you
[56:27] know going going to the the the the
[56:30] Homeland amen but the thing of it is
[56:33] they didn't need it any of these things
[56:35] for God was a present help in the time
[56:39] of trouble amen he was a present help
[56:42] Exodus 23:20 God would tell them behold
[56:45] I send an angel before thee to keep thee
[56:48] in the way and to bring thee into the
[56:51] place which I have prepared amen now
[56:55] that was enough God didn't have to go
[56:57] through detail of how he was going to do
[56:58] it he just said I'm going to bring thee
[57:01] into the land which I have prepared amen
[57:04] and whatever it takes to bring you there
[57:06] I will be a present help in the time of
[57:09] trouble and we find that God God
[57:11] preserved their clothes and and how he
[57:14] done it I don't know but we know good
[57:16] and well that they were years uh
[57:18] traveling in the promised land and and
[57:21] there was children that started out
[57:23] maybe babies that had had started out of
[57:26] Egypt and and and they as they grew
[57:29] somehow or another their clothes were
[57:32] preserved there and their clothes either
[57:35] grew with them or or whatever but God
[57:37] clothed them God took care of them when
[57:40] they needed food God fed them amen sent
[57:44] food out of the heaven Amen to to
[57:47] sustain them when they needed water amen
[57:50] uh God provided a rock and the Bible
[57:53] says that rock followed them through the
[57:56] Wilderness and that Rock Paul says was
[57:58] Christ amen and it wasn't just a little
[58:01] trickle of water coming out it had to
[58:03] water not only 2 and a half million
[58:05] people but it had to water all the
[58:08] livestock and all of these things and it
[58:10] was such a great force of water that
[58:12] come out of that rock that even the the
[58:16] the Nations amen uh uh uh that were
[58:19] maybe downhill from it or whatever amen
[58:22] benefited from the water that flowed
[58:24] unto them amen see God was a present
[58:27] help to his people amen see and and so
[58:32] he sent that angel and and that angel
[58:34] was the angel of the Covenant which we
[58:36] know was Jesus Christ amen and that
[58:40] angel God kept them from being destroyed
[58:43] he kept them from being cursed by balum
[58:47] he kept them from dying of thirst and
[58:50] hunger amen even when sickness come into
[58:54] the camp God was present there amen and
[58:58] provided an atonement amen uh uh that
[59:02] they could recover from their sickness
[59:04] think of that amen God wasn't there just
[59:08] as a as a a judgment that they would be
[59:11] destroyed like uh uh like so many other
[59:14] nations amen but this was a people of
[59:17] God that and and we know why God you
[59:20] know why the the fiery serpents came God
[59:24] sent fiery serpents into the of Israel
[59:27] for their murmuring and they complaining
[59:29] and they griping against Moses and
[59:32] against God and and all of these things
[59:34] and he sent fiery serpents that and and
[59:37] admit the people that many of them died
[59:40] amen and if God had not been there as a
[59:43] present help to show Mercy unto them
[59:47] amen all of Israel would have been wiped
[59:49] out but God was there as a present help
[59:53] amen I'm so glad for that amen see so
[59:56] God made sure that the people made it
[1:00:00] amen to to wherever he was leading them
[1:00:04] amen now notice that Jesus left us a
[1:00:07] promise in John 14 And1 let not your
[1:00:11] heart be troubled you believe in God
[1:00:13] believe also in me in my father's house

[1:00:24] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:00:27] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:00:30] myself that where I am there you may be
[1:00:34] also amen now that's a promise that is
[1:00:36] what God has determined is that he would
[1:00:39] go to prepare a place that where you he
[1:00:42] is you may be there also now in the
[1:00:46] journey there there's been sickness
[1:00:48] there's been all kinds of things Amen to

[1:00:55] but I'm so glad glad that God is a
[1:00:58] present help in the time of trouble amen

[1:01:05] concerning us do you believe that he
[1:01:07] kept his word for a natural people and
[1:01:10] he's going to keep his word for his
[1:01:12] spiritual people amen amen now that
[1:01:15] natural people was a natural Seed of
[1:01:17] Abraham but we are of the faith Seed of
[1:01:20] Abraham of that rawal seed a super seed
[1:01:24] a super race a super super Church ain't
[1:01:27] ain't that right so God is going to keep
[1:01:29] his word and everything that we have
[1:01:32] need of uh is ours that's right amen
[1:01:36] that's what a prophet said everything
[1:01:38] that you have need of is yours and

[1:02:20] the strength to get there I I I I need
[1:02:24] whatever amen it takes to get me there I
[1:02:27] need it amen see now God has given us
[1:02:30] the strongest weapon there is in all the
[1:02:33] world and that's prayer amen the prophet
[1:02:36] said the Christian doesn't realize what
[1:02:39] a force he has when he kneels on his
[1:02:42] knees before almighty God In The Name of
[1:02:45] Jesus Christ he doesn't realize what
[1:02:48] power that is if the people could only
[1:02:51] realize that what is given right unto
[1:02:54] them as any or anything that you ask for
[1:02:58] will be given if you can appropriate the
[1:03:02] faith to believeing amen now as
[1:03:06] Believers we we realize that we're
[1:03:08] living in the mill ofcs of time amen
[1:03:11] church we ain't got much time Amen to to
[1:03:15] be uh playing around amen we ain't got
[1:03:18] much time to be holding grudges we ain't
[1:03:20] got time Amen to to to be looking at the
[1:03:24] world and being entertain AED and
[1:03:26] enticed by the things of the world we're
[1:03:28] living in the middle ofcs of time if
[1:03:31] there's ever a time that we need to be
[1:03:33] prayed up it's now if there's ever a
[1:03:35] time that we need to get serious with
[1:03:37] God and serious with our Christian faith
[1:03:39] and serious about this message and
[1:03:41] serious about our personal lives amen it
[1:03:44] is now amen we ain't got time to be LAX
[1:03:47] we ain't got time to be lukewarm we
[1:03:49] ain't got time amen trying to decide
[1:03:51] what we want to do amen whether we want
[1:03:53] to follow God all the way or or or or
[1:03:56] whatever see amen see and just uh I I
[1:04:00] believe that we're living in such a time
[1:04:02] I I maybe we don't even realize how late
[1:04:05] we uh uh the hour is but but we're
[1:04:08] really living in in the milliseconds
[1:04:10] amen and just as it was in in uh the
[1:04:14] last few hours of Jesus's uh mortal life
[1:04:18] a uh uh more prophecies are being
[1:04:21] fulfilled in uh uh today then then uh
[1:04:25] any other of the six Church ages uh uh
[1:04:30] uh you know all the prophecies
[1:04:32] concerning Jesus's life there was more
[1:04:34] fulfilled in the hour the last hour of
[1:04:38] his life here on this Earth than there
[1:04:41] was the rest of his life see and I
[1:04:43] believe that's the same way prophecy
[1:04:46] after prophecy after prophecy is being
[1:04:49] fulfilled in this in this time that
[1:04:52] we're living in amen and so one of the
[1:04:55] prophecy sees that that speak of this
[1:04:57] day is found in uh Daniel 12 and 1 it
[1:05:01] says and at that time shall Michael
[1:05:03] stand up the great Prince which standeth
[1:05:06] for the children of thy people and there
[1:05:08] shall be a time of trouble everybody say
[1:05:11] a time of trouble there shall be a time
[1:05:14] of trouble such as never was since
[1:05:18] before uh the uh since there was a
[1:05:20] nation even to that same time and at
[1:05:24] that time thy people
[1:05:26] Amen brother Braham said thy people
[1:05:28] 144,000 Jews shall be delivered everyone
[1:05:33] that shall be found written in the book
[1:05:35] now now think of that no there there's
[1:05:37] never going to be a time of trouble like
[1:05:39] coming amen you think you've got trouble
[1:05:42] amen there ain't no trouble like the
[1:05:44] trouble that is is coming amen the time
[1:05:47] of trouble amen now that time of trouble
[1:05:49] is the Great Tribulation uh which is at
[1:05:53] at hand and and and so uh uh uh this
[1:05:56] time of trouble amen is not just a
[1:05:59] personal trouble that maybe you go
[1:06:01] through we all have personal troubles we
[1:06:04] we go through things that we've got to
[1:06:06] overcome we've got to ask God for help
[1:06:08] amen we've got to ask God to to deliver
[1:06:11] us to to to keep us to preserve us and
[1:06:14] all of these things I uh you know but
[1:06:17] this time of trouble is going to be for
[1:06:19] the whole world Amen Ain ain't just one
[1:06:22] nation going to go through it not just
[1:06:23] one group of people but the whole world
[1:06:26] is going to be affected by this time of
[1:06:29] trouble amen you see in this time of
[1:06:32] trouble The Mercy Seat now becomes the
[1:06:35] Judgment seat because there's no blood
[1:06:38] upon the altar there's no blood left uh
[1:06:42] uh upon the seat amen now another
[1:06:45] scripture for us to ponder is found in
[1:06:48] in Psalms 27
[1:06:51] 1-5 it says the Lord is my light and my
[1:06:55] salvation
[1:06:56] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the
[1:06:59] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:07:02] afraid when the wicked even my enemies
[1:07:05] my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:07:10] they stumbled and fail though and ho
[1:07:14] should encamp against me my heart shall
[1:07:17] not fear though War should rise against
[1:07:20] me in this will I be confident one thing
[1:07:24] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[1:07:26] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[1:07:30] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[1:07:33] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:07:36] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[1:07:40] trouble everybody say in the time of
[1:07:42] trouble amen he shall hide me in his
[1:07:46] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:07:50] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:07:54] rock now believe uh here we read where
[1:07:57] Daniel's talking about a time of trouble
[1:07:59] like never before uh coming upon the
[1:08:02] Earth amen and I believe that David is
[1:08:05] talking about that same time of trouble
[1:08:07] amen see uh speaking of the same thing
[1:08:11] that Daniel is and and Daniel is
[1:08:14] speaking of the elected group of of Jews
[1:08:17] being delivered in the time of trouble
[1:08:20] amen uh uh at that time all thy people
[1:08:24] which is written in the book shall be
[1:08:26] delivered amen but notice David is
[1:08:30] speaking of another group amen and that
[1:08:33] is the Gentile bride being hid away at
[1:08:37] the time of trouble in the time of
[1:08:40] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:08:45] amen I'm going to be safe in this time
[1:08:47] of trouble amen I'm going to be
[1:08:49] protected from it can you say amen amen
[1:08:53] see so now brother brandham took this
[1:08:55] prophecy for that was a prophecy that we
[1:08:58] just read amen he took that prophecy and
[1:09:02] he used it as an opening his opening
[1:09:04] scripture when he preached on the
[1:09:06] Rapture amen the Rapture he tied the
[1:09:09] Rapture of the Bride to that scripture
[1:09:12] being hid away in the time of trouble
[1:09:16] amen he's going to hide me amen and and
[1:09:19] so now brother brandham says Any teacher
[1:09:22] uh that that uh knows that the church
[1:09:25] Church goes in the Rapture before the
[1:09:27] tribulation sets in aren't you glad for
[1:09:30] that amen a time of trouble amen is
[1:09:33] coming church amen like you've never
[1:09:35] seen before amen and you don't want to
[1:09:37] be left behind amen but thank God he's a
[1:09:41] present help in the time of trouble amen
[1:09:44] that he will cide us away amen and keep
[1:09:48] us now what is the Tribulation it is a
[1:09:51] time of purification purification it
[1:09:55] means cleansing sanctifying uh uh uh
[1:09:59] purifying see and so it's it's a getting
[1:10:02] rid of all the filth and all the
[1:10:05] ugliness and and all the things that are
[1:10:08] unpure see and so we find that the Earth
[1:10:12] has to go through purification amen the
[1:10:15] church not the bride but the church has
[1:10:19] to go through purification the foolish
[1:10:22] virgin see amen and remember uh uh
[1:10:26] brother Brown said she doesn't go
[1:10:27] through the tribulation to get saved
[1:10:30] because she already is saved notice he
[1:10:34] said the sleeping virgin the Gentile
[1:10:36] virgin is not to be saved during that
[1:10:38] time she's already been saved but has
[1:10:42] been rejected in the bride and she only
[1:10:45] goes through the tribulation see period
[1:10:48] for the time of purification because she
[1:10:51] has rejected Christ the word for her
[1:10:54] purific
[1:10:56] then she has to suffer for her Deeds but
[1:10:59] the bride who has become the word a
[1:11:02] complete atonement was made of Christ
[1:11:06] because he is the word can you say Amen
[1:11:09] So speaking of the the foolish virgin
[1:11:11] she is not saved during that time she's
[1:11:14] saved now from Eternal death but she'll
[1:11:17] have to go through the tribulation
[1:11:18] period for the purification ain't that
[1:11:21] right so then we find that the the
[1:11:24] 144,000 Jews must go through
[1:11:27] purification as well see so the bride of
[1:11:30] Christ is the only one that does not go
[1:11:34] through the tribulation amen she's the
[1:11:37] only one that does not have to be
[1:11:40] purified and God is a present help in
[1:11:44] the time of her trouble trouble coming
[1:11:47] but God shows himself to be a present
[1:11:50] help I'm so glad for that amen the
[1:11:53] prophet said the reason why she doesn't
[1:11:55] go through it is the bride is Forgiven
[1:11:58] aren't you glad you're
[1:11:59] forgiven amen I the bride Is Forgiven so
[1:12:03] she goes straight to glory in a Rapture
[1:12:06] amen well what purifies her she is
[1:12:09] purified the prophet said by the blood
[1:12:12] of Jesus Christ she needs no
[1:12:16] purification see Romans 8:1 there is
[1:12:20] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:12:23] which are in Jesus Christ who walk not
[1:12:26] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[1:12:28] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:12:31] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:12:34] sin and death so there is no
[1:12:36] condemnation against her in her upon her
[1:12:40] amen She is totally free from the
[1:12:43] condemnation amen John 5:24 verily
[1:12:46] verily I say unto you he that heareth my
[1:12:49] word and believeth on him that sent me
[1:12:53] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:12:57] into condemnation but is pass from Death
[1:13:00] unto life oh I'm so glad for that see
[1:13:04] that's a promise there amen God knows
[1:13:07] exactly what he's doing amen now church
[1:13:10] he knows what all the trouble is in this
[1:13:11] world he knows it the the people may not
[1:13:14] know it amen the politicians don't know
[1:13:17] it the sinner doesn't understand
[1:13:18] everything they know trouble's coming
[1:13:20] they don't understand it but God knows
[1:13:23] amen God knows see and he he's not about
[1:13:25] to fix it all amen but what he is going
[1:13:28] to do he's going to take you out of this
[1:13:30] amen he's here as a present help Amen in
[1:13:34] the time of trouble to hide you
[1:13:37] away amen now brother Brown said see
[1:13:40] would you choose a woman you had to
[1:13:42] purify before you married her well see
[1:13:45] Christ's bride is chosen and she is
[1:13:47] elected and she is God's bride the Bride
[1:13:50] of Jesus Christ another place God gave
[1:13:53] the promise that we would not eat even
[1:13:55] stand at the Judgment so freely did he
[1:13:59] take my place until I'm absolutely free
[1:14:03] and when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned how
[1:14:06] can he take me out of the pawn shop I've
[1:14:09] got a clear receipt see how can he be my
[1:14:12] redeemer and take me from the pawn shop
[1:14:14] and the broker still say I belong to him
[1:14:18] amen you understand that amen Satan will
[1:14:20] lied to us and so so sad that many of us
[1:14:24] believe he lies but I'm telling you amen
[1:14:28] Jesus Christ is your Redeemer he's got
[1:14:30] the receipt that he paid the price and
[1:14:33] now Satan has no claim upon you you're
[1:14:36] you're Justified you're
[1:14:38] free how many's free you believe that
[1:14:41] you're free Hallelujah see amen see so
[1:14:45] he says see uh uh uh how can he be my
[1:14:49] redeemer Jesus and take me from the pawn
[1:14:51] shop and the broker of the devil still
[1:14:54] say I belong to him he said I've got a
[1:14:57] written receipt amen I've got this I've
[1:15:00] got the message that tells me that I'm
[1:15:03] Justified I never did it in the first
[1:15:05] place I've got a re written receipt
[1:15:08] wrote by the blood of Jesus Christ now
[1:15:11] Church you know the the the prophet said
[1:15:13] that the word is a bloody bleeding word
[1:15:16] amen that receipt amen is dripping with
[1:15:18] blood amen yes sir see so we're living
[1:15:23] in a time of trouble today we're living
[1:15:25] in a time of trouble and and brother
[1:15:28] brandham would call it a dark day the
[1:15:31] time of trouble it's a dark day amen and
[1:15:35] and so a day of Darkness now the Bible
[1:15:38] has already prophesied of it Isaiah 60
[1:15:42] and2 be before Behold The Darkness shall
[1:15:45] cover the Earth and gross Darkness the
[1:15:49] people so this is a time of trouble amen
[1:15:52] Darkness covering the Earth gross
[1:15:55] Darkness covering the people it's over
[1:15:57] the people it's possessing the people
[1:15:59] the people are blinded it's a time of
[1:16:02] trouble and and and a trouble a time
[1:16:06] like never before known upon the Earth
[1:16:09] amen see and so what is this gross
[1:16:11] Darkness amen the prophet would call it
[1:16:14] dark hearts or unbelief amen see and
[1:16:18] it's speaking of this leodys and age
[1:16:21] brother Bram said this Le oysan age goes
[1:16:24] into
[1:16:25] total darkness see and it isn't going to
[1:16:28] get brighter there is no politician
[1:16:31] that's going to make it brighter for you
[1:16:33] amen the only thing that can make it
[1:16:34] brighter is the word of God Amen for
[1:16:37] this
[1:16:38] age do you believe that amen so then
[1:16:42] it's only going to get darker and darker
[1:16:45] and darker amen it it's just that way
[1:16:49] amen and what is it the prophet said the
[1:16:51] Gentiles are shutting their hearts from
[1:16:54] the message amen they sit in unbelief
[1:16:58] you know we have the biggest churches
[1:17:00] and when I say we I'm talking about just
[1:17:02] christiandom amen but we have the
[1:17:04] biggest churches than ever before amen I
[1:17:07] think Oklahoma just toss so Al's got you
[1:17:10] know two or probably three or four
[1:17:13] churches with no less than 5,000 members
[1:17:17] in it and and you know we we've got
[1:17:20] these things we've got the best dressed
[1:17:21] people the best fed people the you know
[1:17:24] more money than we've ever had before
[1:17:27] and yet the prophet says we've got more
[1:17:29] sickness than ever before we have more
[1:17:31] ad adultery than ever before we've got
[1:17:34] more sin than ever before amen and and
[1:17:38] brother Bram said it's because we've got
[1:17:39] more unbelief than there ever was in
[1:17:42] this day why because gross darkness is
[1:17:46] come uh and and and the Darkness is
[1:17:48] cover the Earth gross Darkness the
[1:17:50] people and the people are sitting with
[1:17:53] more unbelief than in in in the time of
[1:17:56] History amen and the prophet says that
[1:17:59] you know he's talking about Satan uh I
[1:18:01] think it's the God of this evil age amen
[1:18:05] uh Satan the God of this world says he
[1:18:07] is making a better world for them to
[1:18:10] live in by his knowledge apart from the
[1:18:13] never failing word of God Amen they're
[1:18:16] preaching their own knowledge they're
[1:18:18] declaring their own knowledge apart from
[1:18:20] this word but this is the knowledge you
[1:18:22] ought to be conscious of this is the
[1:18:23] knowledge that you ought to know not not
[1:18:26] the knowledge of news not the knowledge
[1:18:28] of science not the knowledge of a
[1:18:29] politician not the knowledge of of
[1:18:32] education but the knowledge of this word
[1:18:35] can you say amen amen he said see uh uh
[1:18:39] uh he's he he says he's making a better
[1:18:42] world for them to live in by his
[1:18:44] knowledge apart from the never-failing
[1:18:46] word of God but by his coming together
[1:18:49] in denominations and Creeds and
[1:18:51] intellectual and scientific and so forth
[1:18:55] he is making a better world for man to
[1:18:57] live in and ignoring the promise of God
[1:19:00] that the only time the world will be fit
[1:19:03] to live in is in the Millennium do you
[1:19:08] understand that church the only time for
[1:19:10] this world to be fit to live in is in
[1:19:13] the
[1:19:15] Millennium that's right see you know my
[1:19:18] opinion he's made a better world to sin
[1:19:21] in instead of to live in amen
[1:19:25] another place he says he's made it a
[1:19:27] better place to die in than to live in
[1:19:31] sir what is it it's gross Darkness so
[1:19:35] what's caused the unbelief and and well
[1:19:37] in one place he says denominational
[1:19:39] seeds being planted brought forth more
[1:19:42] unbelief all the time another place
[1:19:45] ministers has organized themselves and
[1:19:48] got great denominations and taken in
[1:19:51] anything and so forth and just anything
[1:19:54] making a church member see and so then
[1:19:58] then we find that according to Isaiah's
[1:20:02] prophecy that we just read Isaiah UH 60
[1:20:05] and2 two things are happening at the
[1:20:08] same time so let's just read that again
[1:20:10] and start at the first verse Isaiah 61
[1:20:14] arise shine everybody say arise shine sh
[1:20:18] arise Shine for thy light is come oh a
[1:20:23] present help in the time of trouble
[1:20:26] arise Shine for thy light is come and
[1:20:29] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:20:33] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[1:20:35] Earth and gross Darkness the people but
[1:20:38] the Lord everybody say the Lord see
[1:20:41] shall arise upon thee and His glory
[1:20:44] shall be seen upon thee now we know what
[1:20:48] this is It's the revealing of the son of
[1:20:51] man the light that is risen upon thee
[1:20:56] amen uh uh and His glory being seen upon
[1:21:00] thee is the son of man being revealed
[1:21:03] promised in Luke
[1:21:05] 17:30 so not everyone is is part of this
[1:21:09] dark day or this time of trouble amen
[1:21:13] see they're not part of this see because
[1:21:16] there is a light shining in the darkness
[1:21:19] in the time of trouble amen oh aren't
[1:21:22] you glad for that amen yes sir see great
[1:21:26] lack the prophet said is breaking forth
[1:21:29] from the kingdom of God to take its
[1:21:32] place of this gross Darkness coming upon
[1:21:36] the Earth amen thinking of this light
[1:21:40] first John 1:5 tells us that God is
[1:21:43] light so this light that Isaiah is
[1:21:45] talking about is not coming from any
[1:21:48] other source than God himself God is
[1:21:52] light amen Jesus said I am the light of
[1:21:57] the world now it's not two lights two
[1:22:00] different lights it's it's one light can
[1:22:03] you say amen God is light amen see and
[1:22:07] it was God in Christ the Bible says
[1:22:11] reconciling himself at the world to
[1:22:14] himself God in Christ manifesting
[1:22:18] himself to the world the Bible would
[1:22:20] also say in him in Christ dwelt the
[1:22:23] fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[1:22:27] therefore the light had become flesh in
[1:22:31] the body of Jesus Christ aren't you glad
[1:22:35] for that now Isaiah 49 and6 God for told
[1:22:40] of Jesus coming to the Earth he said it
[1:22:44] it is a like thing that you that thou
[1:22:46] should us be my servant uh uh to raise
[1:22:50] up the tribes of Jacob and to restore
[1:22:52] the preserved of Israel I will also give
[1:22:56] thee for a light to the
[1:22:59] Gentiles that thou mayest be my
[1:23:02] salvation unto the end of the Earth
[1:23:05] think of that I will give thee a light
[1:23:09] to the Gentiles amen Not only was he
[1:23:12] going to restore Israel amen and and uh
[1:23:16] uh uh the elect of Israel but he would
[1:23:19] be given as a light to us Gentiles that
[1:23:23] he may be the Sal ation amen unto the
[1:23:26] end of the Earth amen now when Simeon
[1:23:30] saw the Christ child there in uh Luke
[1:23:34] 2:30 we read that he said mine eyes have
[1:23:37] seen thy salvation which thou has
[1:23:41] prepared before the face of all people a
[1:23:45] light to lighten the Gentiles and the
[1:23:48] glory of thy People Israel oh my so in
[1:23:53] this day of of Darkness this this time
[1:23:56] of trouble amen see that's coming upon
[1:23:59] the the face of the Earth Christ is a
[1:24:03] present help Amen to us amen if you
[1:24:07] notice what David said there in Psalms
[1:24:09] 27 and one again the Lord everybody say
[1:24:13] the Lord the Lord is my light and my
[1:24:19] salvation which when he came it was in
[1:24:22] Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that
[1:24:26] the Lord is the strength or sustainer of
[1:24:29] my life of whom shall I be afraid amen
[1:24:34] so the light that is shining upon thee
[1:24:38] in this age is the Lord himself Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ amen now if you look at it in
[1:24:46] Psalms 119 and
[1:24:48] 115 it says Thy word everybody say Thy
[1:24:52] word is a light
[1:24:55] is a light unto my path you see the
[1:24:58] prophet would tell us today the light of
[1:25:01] God is the word of God made manifest
[1:25:05] that's the light made manifest see the
[1:25:09] Lord is my light that's what the
[1:25:11] psalmist said and then he turns around
[1:25:13] and says Thy word is is my light the
[1:25:16] Lord is my light and thy word is my
[1:25:19] light see not the letter of the word
[1:25:23] amen that that's not it the prophet
[1:25:25] would tell us it's the spirit of the
[1:25:28] word which is the Lord
[1:25:31] himself can you say Amen it's the spirit
[1:25:34] of the word that is quickening the
[1:25:37] letter of the word quickening that word
[1:25:41] into us and making it live aren't you
[1:25:45] glad for that trying to show you the
[1:25:47] Lord is our present help amen people
[1:25:51] wondering where the Lord is I'm telling
[1:25:52] you where it's at he's your present help
[1:25:55] in the word made manifest in this age
[1:25:58] for he is our
[1:26:01] light gross Darkness covering the people
[1:26:05] gross Darkness on the Earth but there is
[1:26:08] a light that is keeping the darkness
[1:26:11] away from
[1:26:13] you aren't you glad for that now so
[1:26:17] brother Braham said see the word itself
[1:26:20] is spirit it's spirit in word form then
[1:26:25] when you see when it is quickened or
[1:26:29] brought to life the spirit of the word
[1:26:32] goes to work and acts and acts can you
[1:26:36] say Amen so many people in churches
[1:26:39] today serving a god of history but God
[1:26:43] is a present help in the time of trouble
[1:26:47] how do we know that he's present is
[1:26:50] because this word is being made manifest
[1:26:55] now think of it 2 Corinthians 3:17 the
[1:26:59] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[1:27:03] of the Lord is there is Liberty amen the
[1:27:07] spirit of the word is the Lord
[1:27:11] himself amen not just some emotion not
[1:27:16] just something that gets us excited but
[1:27:19] the spirit of the word comes upon the
[1:27:21] word and it quickens it to our hearts
[1:27:25] if that same spirit that dwelt in Jesus
[1:27:27] Christ and raised him from the dead if
[1:27:30] that dwell in you it will also Quicken
[1:27:32] your mortal Spirit or your mortal body
[1:27:35] ain't that right so the light that is
[1:27:37] shining in this dark day in this time of
[1:27:40] trouble is the word being manifested by
[1:27:43] the spirit of the word the Lord this is
[1:27:47] why we can say that brother brandham was
[1:27:50] beyond the shadow of a doubt the prophet
[1:27:52] of Malachi 4
[1:27:54] can you say Amen why the light
[1:27:57] came and it manifested the the the word
[1:28:01] of Malachi 4 and it become flesh we're
[1:28:04] not looking for a prophet of Malachi 4
[1:28:06] we can truly say he's come and we can
[1:28:10] identify it as brother brandham being
[1:28:13] Malachi the prophet of Malachi 4 amen
[1:28:16] we're not looking for names brother
[1:28:17] brandham was that one he was the prophet
[1:28:21] that God promised the sin he was the
[1:28:23] seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 so so
[1:28:27] we're not looking for a seventh angel to
[1:28:29] come we're not there and there's no
[1:28:32] scripture for an eighth angel either to
[1:28:34] come amen so we're not looking for
[1:28:36] eighth Angel eighth messenger the angel
[1:28:39] the seventh angel has come and we're not
[1:28:42] looking for a name to place it upon we
[1:28:45] know who it was it was brother brandom
[1:28:48] he was the seventh angel can you say
[1:28:50] Amen see the light has come the
[1:28:53] scriptures have been manifested to us
[1:28:56] and fulfilled his ministry fulfilled
[1:28:58] Luke 17:30 it fulfilled Zechariah 4 it
[1:29:02] fulfilled Daniel 2:45 and so many other
[1:29:05] scriptures in the Bible that we could
[1:29:07] just keep going going going amen his
[1:29:09] message was connected to Matthew
[1:29:13] 25 amen the voice of the bridegroom for
[1:29:16] brother brandom said The bridegroom's
[1:29:18] Voice or the the the the the call of the
[1:29:21] bridegroom will come out of this talking
[1:29:24] about the
[1:29:25] message can you say amen amen amen it
[1:29:29] was also his ministry was connected to
[1:29:32] first Thessalonians
[1:29:37] 4:16 can you say amen that's right see
[1:29:41] so now how do we know all of this how do
[1:29:44] we know that God had come in this time
[1:29:48] and took a a a a a a man by the name of
[1:29:52] William brandham and fulfilled the the
[1:29:54] scriptures by his ministry well the same
[1:29:57] Supernatural sign that was performed
[1:30:00] before uh uh to to Abraham and to Sarah
[1:30:05] to prove that God was present with them
[1:30:08] that it wasn't just an ordinary man
[1:30:12] standing there but it was God
[1:30:17] himself can you say
[1:30:19] Amen that same sign was also performed
[1:30:24] in our day to let us know that it was
[1:30:27] more than just a prophet that came to us
[1:30:30] it was God manifesting himself through
[1:30:34] that
[1:30:37] body can you say
[1:30:40] amen God performed that sign the first
[1:30:43] time in a word
[1:30:44] body brother Bram called it a
[1:30:47] theophany
[1:30:49] amen then he Al then he come down later
[1:30:53] and formed that same sign in a body that
[1:30:58] was created in the womb of
[1:31:02] Mary then he he died he he shed his
[1:31:07] blood and now all the way down to this
[1:31:11] age he's been able to take a redeemed
[1:31:15] body come into that body and perform the
[1:31:20] same sign that he did to Abraham and
[1:31:23] Sarah aren't you glad for that it was
[1:31:26] God in flesh we do not believe that
[1:31:29] brother Brandon was God that's right
[1:31:32] some some goofballs
[1:31:34] do and and they are deceived of the
[1:31:37] devil to worship brother
[1:31:40] brandom and to say that he was God
[1:31:42] that's that's false brother Bram hit
[1:31:44] against that you know good and well he
[1:31:46] did right we don't believe in such a
[1:31:49] thing but we do believe that he was the
[1:31:52] vessel that God used
[1:31:54] to identify himself as a present help in
[1:31:58] the time of
[1:32:00] trouble you believe it this is why we
[1:32:03] hold to this message with everything
[1:32:05] that's within us we're not looking for
[1:32:07] no new message we're not looking in
[1:32:09] being entertained by everything else God
[1:32:12] sent us a prophet God identified himself
[1:32:15] in that Prophet not just to tickle our
[1:32:18] fancy but as a present help in the time
[1:32:23] of trouble
[1:32:26] can you say Amen brother Braham said
[1:32:29] today that we're now living in God has
[1:32:33] come on the scene to vindicate and prove
[1:32:35] his promises so is the light of the hour
[1:32:39] so we can Rise and
[1:32:42] Shine the light shines upon us again
[1:32:45] today the word is being made manifest
[1:32:49] it's the promised
[1:32:51] light aren't you glad for that
[1:32:54] oh my not a star
[1:32:57] light not electrical light but a Divine
[1:33:02] Light the very light that God promised
[1:33:05] to send in the age of Darkness amen
[1:33:09] darkest age the most time of trouble
[1:33:12] than ever before and God would send a
[1:33:15] light to shine upon us so we can truly
[1:33:18] say he is here as a present help in the
[1:33:22] time of trouble can you say Amen now if
[1:33:26] he is
[1:33:28] present and he's here as a help in time
[1:33:32] of trouble what kind of a help is he is
[1:33:35] he here to help to get America running
[1:33:40] again is he here to help you in this
[1:33:44] time of season to help you fulfill your
[1:33:47] wish
[1:33:50] list is he here to help you know uh us
[1:33:55] As Americans to conquer the other
[1:33:59] nations what kind of a help is he he's a
[1:34:02] present help in time of trouble
[1:34:06] so you know if you looking a lot of
[1:34:09] people looking at thing life and these
[1:34:11] events and all these things in so many
[1:34:13] different
[1:34:18] directions so is is God a present help
[1:34:22] to help us as a America to become
[1:34:24] respected again among the
[1:34:28] Nations well I'll tell you what kind of
[1:34:30] a help he is because if you can identify
[1:34:35] him that he come and you can see him
[1:34:39] through the eyes of the
[1:34:41] message and what he is here what this
[1:34:45] message had to do what it was for how it
[1:34:48] is to affect us 1 Thessalonians 4:16
[1:34:52] says for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:34:56] from heaven with a what a shout and the
[1:35:00] prophet said that's the
[1:35:04] message and you say
[1:35:07] Amen so the prophet didn't come to get
[1:35:11] us wrapped up in
[1:35:13] politics I know we all use that well
[1:35:15] brother Randon was in politics you know
[1:35:17] he voted and he done this you missed the
[1:35:20] whole stinking point
[1:35:25] most people that are voting is for
[1:35:27] America to
[1:35:28] becom Great
[1:35:33] again but God isn't a help for
[1:35:37] that because the prophet said the world
[1:35:39] is getting darker and darker and darker
[1:35:41] it's going to continue to get dark this
[1:35:44] world he's already preached the messages
[1:35:47] this world is falling apart he said you
[1:35:50] can put Abraham Lincoln's in every
[1:35:52] County you can put George Washington's
[1:35:54] and every whatever it will never
[1:35:58] help so if you're looking for God to be
[1:36:01] a present help in that way you're going
[1:36:03] to be
[1:36:08] disappointed but it says for the Lord
[1:36:10] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:36:15] shout he's going to come to
[1:36:18] help he sent a message with a shout with
[1:36:22] the voice of the AR AR angel with the
[1:36:24] Trump of God and notice now what is this
[1:36:27] going to
[1:36:28] do is it going to make the economy
[1:36:32] work is it going to bring the inflation
[1:36:34] down
[1:36:36] again no the dead in
[1:36:40] Christ are going to rise
[1:36:44] again the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:36:47] first then we everybody say
[1:36:51] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:36:56] caught up together with them in the
[1:36:59] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:37:02] shall we ever be with the Lord I say he
[1:37:06] is a present help in time of
[1:37:10] trouble hiding us
[1:37:18] away if you don't know the time and
[1:37:20] season you're living in God does
[1:37:24] God never sent this message before
[1:37:28] time in other words so we got you know a
[1:37:33] hundred years left or uh 200 years left
[1:37:37] and so he brings a message to get us
[1:37:39] Rapture Ready to get out of here and now
[1:37:43] what do we do we just waiting for
[1:37:45] America to become great and we looking
[1:37:46] for all peace in the world and we're
[1:37:48] looking for Unity in the Nations
[1:37:51] no you realize the events that are
[1:37:53] taking place is simply because the world
[1:37:56] is falling
[1:38:01] apart
[1:38:03] hello so we which are alive and remain
[1:38:08] shall be caught up together with him in
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:11] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:38:14] so shall we ever be with the Lord you
[1:38:16] see he is here everybody say is here do
[1:38:19] you believe he's here well if you

[1:38:33] to let us know Jesus Christ is
[1:38:37] here not a god of
[1:38:40] History this Prophet brought him out of
[1:38:43] history and if we put him as a god of
[1:38:46] History it's our
[1:38:48] fault if we put him as a god of
[1:38:50] yesterday a god of brother brandham and
[1:38:52] cannot be a god for us it's our fault
[1:38:55] because that's not
[1:38:57] true the god of brother brandham should
[1:38:59] be a god of
[1:39:01] you should be the god of sister Melissa
[1:39:05] weeks as much as it is to brother
[1:39:07] brandham it should be a god of Shawn
[1:39:09] Martin as much as it was to brother

[1:49:06] the end of everything everything has
[1:49:08] come to its end and at that time God
[1:49:11] would say look unto me I am the present
[1:49:16] help in the time of trouble look unto me
[1:49:19] and be ye saved yes sir amen
[1:49:23] and you
[1:49:24] sayen you see we see the Nations
[1:49:27] uniting the prophet said the churches
[1:49:29] are
[1:49:30] uniting communism is
[1:49:33] uniting in that message uniting time and
[1:49:36] signs I believe that's how he put it
[1:49:39] amen the title of it everything is
[1:49:42] uniting politics uniting Nations uniting
[1:49:46] you know e everything coming together
[1:49:48] it's all uniting but notice what a
[1:49:51] prophet said it's time everybody say
[1:49:54] it's time it's time that the Saints
[1:49:57] shall arise to unite with those that are
[1:50:00] living to go and Unite with Jesus Christ
[1:50:03] for eternity that's the time that we're
[1:50:06] living in church he is a present help in
[1:50:10] the time of
[1:50:12] trouble don't discount him don't short
[1:50:17] Change God like he doesn't know what
[1:50:20] he's doing God why are you allowing all
[1:50:22] this trouble why are you allowing the
[1:50:23] discomfort why are you allowing our
[1:50:25] taxes to go up and the inflation and
[1:50:27] everything else to go up why are you
[1:50:28] allowing it if you could only know that
[1:50:30] he's here as a present help not to make
[1:50:33] you comfortable in this life this
[1:50:35] world's got to fall apart but he's here
[1:50:37] he's came with power to take you
[1:50:45] home notice what God promised to do in
[1:50:49] this time Ezekiel 34 and12
[1:50:53] as a Shepherd seeketh out his flock in
[1:50:56] the day that he is among his sheep that
[1:50:59] are
[1:51:01] scattered so will I seek out my sheep
[1:51:04] and will deliver them out of all places
[1:51:08] where they have been scattered in the
[1:51:10] Cloudy and dark
[1:51:12] day so now God is Promised I'm going to
[1:51:15] seek out my sheep and I'm going to
[1:51:17] deliver them out of all places where
[1:51:21] they've been scattered in the cloudy and
[1:51:23] dark day now this is
[1:51:27] speaking of the elect being gathered
[1:51:30] together both the Jew and the
[1:51:34] Gentile see during the tribulation
[1:51:37] period God is going to call out his
[1:51:40] elect a
[1:51:41] Jew you know brother Braham said
[1:51:43] according to the election there will be
[1:51:46] 144,000 according to the election that
[1:51:49] will believe the message out of
[1:51:51] literally million
[1:51:53] that'll be
[1:51:54] there isn't that
[1:51:56] amazing and he said the same thing it is
[1:51:59] in the Gentile Church there is a bride
[1:52:02] and she is elected and he will be called
[1:52:05] according to the election so so notice
[1:52:08] he said this all types the church
[1:52:10] perfectly the elected Believers others
[1:52:13] do not believe you can just tell it you
[1:52:15] tell a man a truth and let it be proven
[1:52:17] by the word and then Vindicated well I
[1:52:20] don't believe it but see all that is
[1:52:24] written in the book shall be delivered
[1:52:26] there's not going to be one one
[1:52:29] predestinated seed Left
[1:52:32] Behind hello that's right we understand
[1:52:37] what's happening in the Jew in the
[1:52:39] Jewish the Jews have been scattered for
[1:52:41] what 2,000 years but all of a sudden
[1:52:44] that fig tree is starting to
[1:52:46] bloom amen it's starting to come and and
[1:52:49] the the blooming the budding of that
[1:52:51] that fig tree is the prophet would say
[1:52:54] was Israel becoming a
[1:52:56] nation so they have been been a nation
[1:52:59] since 19 what 48 46 something like that
[1:53:03] I think 48 may be declared but she's
[1:53:06] been a
[1:53:07] nation and just the other day the San
[1:53:11] Hedon
[1:53:13] Sanhedrin uh Council
[1:53:15] courts
[1:53:17] um uh joined together or came together
[1:53:20] and they all voted that all Jews must
[1:53:23] come
[1:53:24] home and they have sent out
[1:53:27] worldwide for all the Jews come home
[1:53:30] it's time come home whether you're
[1:53:33] American Jew Russian Jew polish jew all
[1:53:37] these things come on home it's time now
[1:53:42] church I don't know where all that is
[1:53:44] but I do know there's a prophecy that
[1:53:46] God promised he would bring all those
[1:53:48] his sheep
[1:53:50] back that's been scattered he's going to
[1:53:53] bring them back but also there's an
[1:53:56] elected
[1:53:59] bride that is going to be gathered
[1:54:02] too and she is being gathered under this
[1:54:08] message can you say
[1:54:11] Amen see it's a time of
[1:54:14] Deliverance amen a time of
[1:54:18] deliverance we know that you know the
[1:54:21] the the 144,000 God's going to visit
[1:54:24] them again their eyes are going to be
[1:54:26] opened and they're going to see the
[1:54:28] atonement they're going to see what
[1:54:29] you've been
[1:54:30] seeing they're going to see that that
[1:54:33] Christ was that true atonement and
[1:54:34] they're going to be brought back to that
[1:54:36] true atonement see and and but that's
[1:54:39] that's in the tribulation
[1:54:41] but God has been dealing with the
[1:54:43] elected
[1:54:45] Gentile that
[1:54:47] briad and he's been Gathering them and
[1:54:50] it's a time of Deliverance for them but
[1:54:52] not only just for her but also the
[1:54:57] earth the earth will be
[1:55:00] delivered and it's been in birth pains
[1:55:03] you go listen to birth
[1:55:04] pains brother Bram talks about the Earth
[1:55:07] it's it's starting to be in birth pains
[1:55:09] and it started showing the birth pains
[1:55:12] its first show of birth pains was in the
[1:55:14] world first world
[1:55:16] war and and he said it was one of the
[1:55:19] first birth Pains of her going into
[1:55:21] labor
[1:55:23] and he said because of that time for her
[1:55:25] we we had brought forth the bombs and we
[1:55:27] had machine guns and poison gas and he
[1:55:30] said everybody was scared to death of
[1:55:32] that great weapon of poison gas he said
[1:55:35] you know that was the first birth Pains
[1:55:37] of the Earth but then we had a second
[1:55:40] world war uh yeah second world war and
[1:55:44] and the Earth P the birth Pains of the
[1:55:46] earth become more
[1:55:48] greater and and it was at that time that
[1:55:52] the atomic bomb was invented and he said
[1:55:55] the Earth had to almost give way because
[1:55:57] it would destroy an entire city he said
[1:56:00] it was much greater pain of destruction
[1:56:03] of the earth than the Pains of the first
[1:56:06] world war and he said she knows that her
[1:56:09] time of Deliverance is at hand that's
[1:56:13] the reason she's so nervous flustrated
[1:56:16] as she is is because that there is an
[1:56:18] hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air
[1:56:21] that could destroy of the whole world
[1:56:24] not just a city the whole
[1:56:26] world and he said one nation is scared
[1:56:29] of the other no matter how little it is
[1:56:31] they got those missiles that they claim
[1:56:34] uh one of them they can direct them by
[1:56:36] the stars and drop them anywhere in the
[1:56:39] world they want to Russia he says as
[1:56:42] I've heard on the news the other day she
[1:56:44] claims that she can destroy this nation
[1:56:46] and keep the atoms or things from
[1:56:48] breaking up her Nation we don't know
[1:56:51] what to do about it everyone is making
[1:56:53] these claims and it's so see so people
[1:56:57] science has broken into God's Great
[1:56:59] laboratory until they're going to
[1:57:00] destroy themselves God lets always lets
[1:57:04] wisdom destroy himself see God doesn't
[1:57:07] destroy anything man destroys himself by
[1:57:10] wisdom and as he did at the beginning
[1:57:13] taking Satan's wisdom instead of God's
[1:57:15] word now she knows she must give way she
[1:57:20] cannot stand so the Earth
[1:57:23] knows that she can't stand any much
[1:57:26] longer we we've got missiles R Rush is
[1:57:30] even saying they've got they've got a
[1:57:32] what a bomb or a missile or whatever I
[1:57:34] can't remember what they even call it
[1:57:35] that is so fast that we can't even
[1:57:38] detect it and and and and and everything
[1:57:41] is being set up now they're talking
[1:57:44] about peace peace through strength but
[1:57:48] you remember what a prophet said Jesus
[1:57:50] said himself when they cry peace peace
[1:57:53] certain
[1:57:55] destruction can you say Amen but in the
[1:57:59] time of trouble he's a present
[1:58:05] help no wonder Satan attacks this
[1:58:08] message no wonder he gets our eyes
[1:58:11] looking at all the other things and
[1:58:13] maybe the negatives and maybe the things
[1:58:14] that we don't understand instead of
[1:58:17] looking at the positive things that is
[1:58:20] been made clear to us
[1:58:22] amen can you say
[1:58:25] Amen so here people and I won't take
[1:58:28] much longer but to think that people are
[1:58:30] looking to a political genius to stop
[1:58:34] the birth
[1:58:37] pains and bring peace to the earth I
[1:58:41] will tell you right now it will not
[1:58:50] happen whatever happens
[1:58:52] it will not stop the Perth
[1:58:55] paines it's time to go home it's time
[1:58:59] for this old corrupt world to give way
[1:59:03] to an eternal thing it's time for
[1:59:06] mortality to give way to
[1:59:08] immortality it's time for the
[1:59:10] governments of the earth that has been
[1:59:12] controlled by Satan to give way to a new
[1:59:15] government to a new kingdom and that's
[1:59:18] an eternal
[1:59:20] Kingdom can you say Amen
[1:59:23] now the prophet says the world knows
[1:59:25] that her birth pains are so great she's
[1:59:27] got to give away there's going to be a
[1:59:30] new birth born at hand and I'm thankful
[1:59:33] for that he said I'm tired of this one
[1:59:36] how many's tired of this
[1:59:38] one I'm tired of this one and anyone
[1:59:41] knows that here is the place here is a
[1:59:44] place of sorrow and death why would we
[1:59:47] want this to
[1:59:49] continue it's a place of corruption sh
[1:59:52] it's a place of
[1:59:55] evil it's a place that Satan controls
[1:59:59] all
[2:00:00] nations he's in control of it it's his
[2:00:05] these kingdoms of the Earth are Satan's
[2:00:08] right so anyone knows that it's a place
[2:00:10] of death and sorrow and all kinds of
[2:00:13] discrepancies and so forth but I'm glad
[2:00:16] that she has to give way I'm glad that
[2:00:18] the time is at hand as John said of
[2:00:22] even so come Lord Jesus can you say Amen
[2:00:28] oh to think of it a time of trouble and
[2:00:30] a time of Deliverance a time of trouble
[2:00:34] for the world but a time of Deliverance
[2:00:36] for God's elect Amen brother Bram said
[2:00:39] Jesus is here now and this is your
[2:00:42] opportunity this is the day of salvation
[2:00:45] now is the time call upon him this is
[2:00:48] the hour this is the time of Deliverance
[2:00:51] this is the time God's calling out his
[2:00:54] people not another time now is the day
[2:00:57] he's manifesting himself showing
[2:01:01] himself and we can truly say he is a
[2:01:04] present help in the time of trouble
[2:01:09] Hallelujah now if you look at it if you
[2:01:12] want to see how that God is a help to us
[2:01:16] in this day it's important to see how he
[2:01:20] works
[2:01:22] and brother Braham said when God is just
[2:01:24] about to do something to deliver his
[2:01:27] people God sends a message to the
[2:01:32] people it's so
[2:01:35] simple he says as we'll catch in the
[2:01:37] breaking of the
[2:01:38] seals he said but we find out in the
[2:01:40] breaking of the seals it's so simple
[2:01:43] that the smart miss it a million miles
[2:01:48] can you say Amen when God got ready to
[2:01:51] deliver his children from Egypt he sent
[2:01:54] a
[2:01:55] man named Moses to deliver
[2:01:58] them Moses was just an ordinary man that
[2:02:01] came from an ordinary Jewish Family his
[2:02:04] parents were just ordinary slaves
[2:02:06] nothing special about them they were
[2:02:08] just out there making brick for the
[2:02:10] enemy they were their backs were just as
[2:02:12] beaten as the others and scarred and all
[2:02:15] that but see from that family the
[2:02:18] prophet said God brought forth an order
[2:02:21] ordinary child a simple human
[2:02:25] being but that child was foreordained to
[2:02:29] be a deliver for God's people can you
[2:02:31] say Amen which shows us and brother
[2:02:34] Brandon would say this God had to let
[2:02:37] Moses be trained in all the wisdom of
[2:02:40] the world so that he would fall and make
[2:02:42] a mess of
[2:02:43] himself God had to let Moses be trained
[2:02:47] in all the wisdom of the world and
[2:02:50] become a a a man of might in in the in
[2:02:54] the nation of Egypt and all these things
[2:02:57] so that he would fall and make a mess of
[2:02:59] himself now why was this brother Brown
[2:03:01] said to show us that Deliverance does
[2:03:04] not come by the wisdom of the
[2:03:07] world don't look to a politician for
[2:03:10] deliverance that's right don't look for
[2:03:12] a denomination for deliverance don't
[2:03:15] look to yourself for deliverance can you
[2:03:18] say amen God had to let Moses fall
[2:03:22] so that we wouldn't be looking to some
[2:03:24] intellectual giant to bring Deliverance
[2:03:26] in this day brother Bram said God today
[2:03:29] is not going to deliver his people by
[2:03:32] education he never promised to do it
[2:03:35] he's not going to deliver them by
[2:03:36] theology he never promised to do it he's
[2:03:38] not going to deliver them by science he
[2:03:40] never promised to do it he's not going
[2:03:42] to deliver them by denomination he never
[2:03:44] promised to do it but he will deliver
[2:03:47] them by the power the supernatural power
[2:03:51] of the changing their lives and molding
[2:03:54] them into children of God aren't you
[2:03:58] glad for that you love the Lord amen as
[2:04:02] the musicians
[2:04:04] come God is a present help in the time
[2:04:08] of
[2:04:10] trouble God is a present help I'm so
[2:04:14] glad for
[2:04:15] that
[2:04:18] amen not only is he a present help in
[2:04:20] your in your person personal life when
[2:04:23] you're going through
[2:04:25] trials but if we could see him as a
[2:04:27] present help
[2:04:30] now as a way time of
[2:04:33] Deliverance is this what this message is
[2:04:36] is to bring us into a place to get us
[2:04:38] ready for
[2:04:39] Rapture to build rapturing Faith within
[2:04:43] us that we could go home he's come to
[2:04:46] hide us
[2:04:47] away Amen in time of
[2:04:50] trouble God bless you what song maybe we
