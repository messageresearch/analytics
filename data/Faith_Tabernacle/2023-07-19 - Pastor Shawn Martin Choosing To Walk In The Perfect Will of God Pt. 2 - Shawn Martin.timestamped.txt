[43:53] but if you have your Bibles we're going
[43:56] to turn to the book of Colossians the
[43:58] fourth chapter
[43:59] and we were praying for sister Rhonda
[44:04] and sister Lisa's sister
[44:07] and um but I heard that she has actually
[44:11] able to make it home I come back home
[44:14] and
[44:15] doing well and so we thank the Lord
[44:19] for answering the prayer
[44:22] amen I just believe that God is a prayer
[44:25] answering God
[44:27] no matter what it looks like no matter
[44:29] what in the impossibility God can answer
[44:32] the prayer seeing him do it time and
[44:34] time again amen
[44:36] a man
[44:39] um before we go into the word let's just
[44:41] bow our heads and talk to our Lord
[44:45] and ask for his help Father
[44:49] we come to you as your children with
[44:52] Humble Hearts
[44:54] Lord we're needy people
[44:57] father we're not self-sufficient Lord we
[45:01] we need you Lord we need you in every
[45:04] part of our life
[45:07] father we've seen you answer the prayers
[45:09] we've seen you
[45:11] protect and deliver and set free and
[45:15] God you provided in so many ways
[45:18] and Lord if you've done it back then you
[45:21] can do it now again
[45:23] and I pray father that every need here
[45:26] present whether physically mentally
[45:28] spiritually
[45:30] that they would be mad Lord
[45:32] father we would give you all praise and
[45:35] glory for it and
[45:36] we pray Lord that you would just bless
[45:39] the ministering of your word
[45:41] father your word is already blessed but
[45:43] now we just pray that you would help us
[45:45] the speaker and the hearer
[45:47] and may your word Lord just be effective
[45:50] in every life
[45:52] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[45:55] amen
[45:57] Colossians the fourth chapter we'd read
[46:01] this last Wednesday
[46:04] and
[46:07] it
[46:09] I'm not good at the pronouncing these
[46:11] names but everpus
[46:14] something like that
[46:16] which is one of you this is Paul writing
[46:19] to the Colossians
[46:21] this this brother who is one of you a
[46:24] servant of Christ saluteth you always
[46:26] laboring fervently for you in prayers
[46:30] and notice that you may stand
[46:33] perfect
[46:34] and complete in all if I say all
[46:39] the will of God
[46:42] you can have your seats this evening
[46:46] and uh
[46:48] I guess again I'm going to use the title
[46:52] choosing to walk in the perfect will of
[46:55] God
[46:56] and I pray this will be of some help to
[47:00] you and especially to you young people
[47:03] who are at a Crossroads in your life
[47:08] and um
[47:10] standing in the
[47:14] the will of God perfect and complete
[47:18] is something that we should all desire
[47:21] from the eldest to to the youngest who
[47:26] I guess who who can pray in in
[47:30] accordingly
[47:31] but we know that the will of God is the
[47:34] plan of God for our lives and it's a
[47:37] it's not just a random thing but it's a
[47:40] predestinated plan
[47:43] and so we we realize that it it this
[47:48] plan is off based off the purpose of God
[47:51] which Paul would tell us it's an eternal
[47:54] purpose
[47:56] and it's a it's a predestinated plan
[47:59] and God's plan God's purpose uh existed
[48:06] before the foundation of the world
[48:09] and and only God could do this
[48:12] but
[48:14] if we could call it millions and
[48:15] millions billions or whatever of years
[48:18] if there was such a thing
[48:21] uh before creation this plan was in
[48:27] existence in God's mind
[48:29] and we talked about I think it was
[48:31] Sunday the premeditated thoughts of God
[48:34] and and so we we look Isaiah 46 and 9
[48:40] God speaking through the prophet Isaiah
[48:43] says remember the former things of old
[48:45] for I am God and there is none else I am
[48:49] God and there is none like me declaring
[48:52] the end from the beginning
[48:55] from ancient times the things that are
[48:57] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[49:00] stand and I will do all my pleasure
[49:02] calling a ravenous bird from the East
[49:05] the man that executeth my counsel from a
[49:07] far country yea I have spoken it and I
[49:11] will also bring it to pass I have
[49:14] purposed it and I will also do it ain't
[49:18] that right
[49:19] so then uh uh and I'm so glad for the
[49:22] predestinated plan of God a man that God
[49:26] could uh foreordain everything and and
[49:30] then we we find that that the way that
[49:34] God
[49:35] how that God could predestinated the
[49:38] plan is by his foreknowledge
[49:41] that he doesn't have a mind like you and
[49:44] I we don't know what tomorrow holds we
[49:46] can plan for tomorrow but we still don't
[49:49] know what it holds uh our life might be
[49:52] cut short tonight amen and uh uh so many
[49:56] things can change our plans but God has
[49:59] an infinite mind
[50:01] that that he he can tell the end from
[50:05] the beginning
[50:07] and he can declare it he knows what will
[50:09] be ain't that right now I want you to
[50:12] listen to that he knows what will be so
[50:16] just reading some some quotes here
[50:20] um God foresaw and predestinated a world
[50:24] of sons and daughters and he
[50:27] predestinated them to be there ain't
[50:31] that right
[50:32] see God could predestinate by
[50:34] foreknowledge he foreknew what would be
[50:37] not willing that any should perish but
[50:41] that all would come to repentance but
[50:43] being infinite and God he could
[50:46] predestinate and foretell by
[50:49] foreknowledge
[50:51] ain't that right this is what this whole
[50:54] Bible is is a foretelling of the future
[50:57] of things that would be and what will
[51:00] come and and well that was God he spoke
[51:03] through prophets but it wasn't their
[51:06] mind they didn't know they didn't know
[51:07] how a lot of things like Isaiah would
[51:09] say Behold a virginship and say well how
[51:12] in the world is the Virgin going to
[51:13] conceive never been done before but but
[51:15] Isaiah wasn't going by what he thought
[51:17] or what what he he saw in in his own
[51:21] natural ability that was God speaking
[51:23] through that man so it was an infinite
[51:26] god with an infinite knowledge declaring
[51:29] what was already going to be and it
[51:31] happened just exactly the way he said it
[51:34] would be so it wasn't a man's words
[51:36] ain't that right so God knew now notice
[51:40] by foreknowledge God knew exactly who
[51:43] would be saved and who would not be
[51:45] saved see so as we talk you know uh
[51:49] we're going to the marriage supper of
[51:51] the lamb and and and and there's a table
[51:54] going to be there right and and and and
[51:57] and so we're all going to be gathered
[51:58] around this table but but it isn't God
[52:01] now saying okay now I wonder who's going
[52:04] to make it you know uh uh boy that guy's
[52:07] really going through a lot of troubles
[52:08] right now and I he I don't know you
[52:11] better hold that chair right you know
[52:13] because I don't know you know and then
[52:15] you see someone just backslide I just
[52:17] scratch his name out you know there
[52:19] ain't no hope that ain't God
[52:21] he's you know it's it's not taking the
[52:24] chair adding the chair taking a chair
[52:25] you know what I'm saying well God
[52:27] already knows who will and who wouldn't
[52:29] see and and so uh he knew exactly who
[52:33] would be saved and who would not be
[52:35] saved he didn't want the people to be
[52:37] lost it's not his will that any should
[52:40] be lost
[52:41] it's his will to save everyone but he
[52:44] knew from the beginning who would and
[52:48] who would not that's the reason he could
[52:51] foresee this thing will happen that
[52:53] thing will happen or this will be that
[52:55] or this person will be a certain way see
[52:58] he could for know it because he's
[53:01] infinite and if you don't know what it
[53:03] means that means there's nothing that he
[53:06] don't know
[53:07] foreign
[53:08] there's nothing he's infinite he knows
[53:11] how many heart at times your heart's
[53:12] going to be
[53:14] during your whole lifetime brother Billy
[53:16] knows how many heart how many times your
[53:19] heart will beat by the time you're born
[53:21] to the time you die and not only just
[53:23] you but all the billions of people on
[53:25] the Earth and not just to humans but the
[53:27] animals and the birds and and on and on
[53:29] and on he's infinite
[53:31] so he has that kind of knowledge there's
[53:33] nothing that can escape his his
[53:35] knowledge
[53:36] so way back in in the beginning uh
[53:39] another quote when he's seen that there
[53:42] were some people who was going to desire
[53:44] to be saved some people who was going to
[53:46] want to be saved some people who would
[53:48] be loyal in their heart they wanted to
[53:51] be saved see he saw that he knew that so
[53:54] then he began to make preparation for
[53:58] their salvation or they will never be
[54:01] saved
[54:02] ain't that right so so he knows that
[54:06] anything in perfect cannot come into
[54:08] heaven see and and yet he knew that
[54:11] there would be a people that if given
[54:13] the chance they would choose to go to
[54:15] heaven they would want to go and so
[54:18] therefore he has to make a way of
[54:21] perfection for that ain't it ain't that
[54:24] right he made a preparation for healing
[54:26] he made a preparation for victory he
[54:29] made a preparation for deliverance he
[54:31] made a he made a preparation for the
[54:34] translation of their body amen and and
[54:37] he knows how many is going in a Rapture
[54:40] they're they're he already knows that
[54:42] and and and not only that he already
[54:44] knows who's gonna who's gonna be on the
[54:46] other side and and so that's why uh uh
[54:50] uh it's not a body that will be made
[54:52] when you get there that body's already
[54:55] waiting for you
[54:57] well that's what Paul said see if this
[55:00] the Earthly Tabernacle of this uh body
[55:03] be dissolved we have one waiting
[55:06] ain't that right see so now now those
[55:10] who accept his provided way are the sons
[55:14] of God for they have the gene seed of
[55:17] God within them they are the very
[55:21] attributes of God they are the Eternal
[55:23] thoughts of God that's what it means to
[55:26] be father ain't that right if father's
[55:28] got to have sons
[55:30] and and they come from the father they
[55:32] that there's a gene seed within them
[55:34] that is of the father
[55:36] they look like the father act like the
[55:38] father think you you see what I'm saying
[55:41] and and and so their their attributes of
[55:43] the father sons and daughters are
[55:46] attributes of the father and God is our
[55:49] father so to claim that God is our
[55:52] father is to say I am an attribute of
[55:55] God I am a gene seed of God I came from
[55:58] God ain't that right and so then uh uh
[56:03] uh they are the ones that God called and
[56:06] well Paul talks about it we've read it
[56:08] many times them he he predestinated and
[56:12] those that he predestinated he called
[56:13] and then he called he justified and then
[56:16] he justified he already glorified ain't
[56:19] that right and so he's already made a
[56:21] place for them in glory ain't that right
[56:24] so by foreknowledge God knew the one
[56:28] that would be a shyster and the one that
[56:30] would be a gentleman and a Christian see
[56:33] so therefore he had to send Jesus today
[56:36] I have to save that man that he foreknew
[56:40] that wanted to be saved God done that he
[56:44] he already acted not upon you but he
[56:47] acted upon what he already knew
[56:50] ain't that right so so another one a
[56:54] quote is God before the foundation of
[56:56] the world looked down through the stream
[56:58] of time and saw everything that would be
[57:00] therefore he could call and elect those
[57:03] who he knew uh that he would put uh in
[57:08] his building so so this purpose God has
[57:11] a purpose again for for everything now
[57:14] now this may be a striking but it's true
[57:18] uh uh there but but uh we know that
[57:22] there are more people on this Earth than
[57:24] just Sons and Daughters of God
[57:27] ain't that right we we know that and and
[57:30] yet this fact doesn't come by surprise
[57:34] God God knew that they would be here
[57:37] ain't that right and and so the only way
[57:41] though that they could come was through
[57:44] the fall of Adam
[57:46] ain't that right see the only way they
[57:49] couldn't have come by the spoken word
[57:52] because they were not a word Gene ain't
[57:55] that right and that's why they don't
[57:57] receive a new birth now I I let's just
[58:00] get it down now because the world Paints
[58:02] the the picture of Christ today that is
[58:05] a defeated Christ that he went to
[58:07] Calvary and he and he and he gave his
[58:10] life and he done everything that he'd
[58:12] done and and exhausted himself and yet
[58:15] he's being so rejected today and it just
[58:18] looks like his purpose for going to
[58:20] Calvary is defeated but it's not
[58:23] defeated
[58:24] ain't that right God's got a purpose and
[58:27] and and so therefore God come to redeem
[58:31] those that he foreknew would accept that
[58:35] so so we find that that not everybody is
[58:39] going to be born again not everybody can
[58:41] have the new birth there's only a slight
[58:44] group of people that can have a new
[58:47] birth and that was them ones that were
[58:49] to come in the original by the spoken
[58:52] word of God now now notice the new birth
[58:55] uh for just a moment First Peter 1 and
[58:59] 23 and I'm just laying something I'm
[59:00] going to get somewhere but being born
[59:02] again not of corruptible seed uh uh but
[59:06] of Incorruptible everybody say
[59:08] Incorruptible by what the word of God
[59:12] being born again not a corruptable seed
[59:14] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[59:17] which liveth and abideth forever
[59:21] so that's where the eternal life is
[59:24] is the New Birth by the word of God can
[59:27] you say Amen
[59:28] see so so we find that that that there
[59:32] is a a multitude and this is what the
[59:34] Bible speaks of it it it only does not
[59:37] only just speak of of the Bride amen but
[59:40] it speaks of The Sinner and the ungodly
[59:42] appearing before the Judgment thrown and
[59:44] it it it it talks about the foolish
[59:47] virgin as as well as the wise version
[59:49] which we know the wise version is the
[59:52] bride of Christ and but yet there is
[59:54] that foolish virgin and and and it
[59:56] speaks of the friends of the Bride in in
[59:59] Matthew 25 and where where they're at
[1:00:02] the the the white Throne judgment and
[1:00:04] and and and and God would say to them
[1:00:06] because when I was naked you clothed me
[1:00:08] when I was poor yeah yeah you gave me uh
[1:00:12] uh uh uh food or when I was hungry you
[1:00:15] gave me food when I was thirsty and they
[1:00:16] said well when did we do all of these
[1:00:18] things he said when you've done it unto
[1:00:19] the lease of these my brethren you did
[1:00:22] it unto me ain't that right see so
[1:00:25] there's there's all kinds of people that
[1:00:27] this Bible talk talks about but there's
[1:00:30] only one group of people that God that
[1:00:33] come from God that are sons of God Amen
[1:00:36] that can be reborn again
[1:00:40] ain't that Ryan
[1:00:41] so so we we find that that none of all
[1:00:45] this none of this uh uh catches God by
[1:00:49] surprise you realize that God knew that
[1:00:52] that uh the the the the the the the the
[1:00:54] angel uh Lucifer you realize that God
[1:00:57] knew what he would do
[1:00:59] and what he would be before he created
[1:01:02] him
[1:01:03] God knew that ain't that right but God
[1:01:06] went ahead and created him because it
[1:01:10] fit in his plan
[1:01:12] God knew what Pharaoh would do
[1:01:16] and what he would be before he even
[1:01:18] created pharaoh before Pharaoh ever come
[1:01:21] to this earth God knew what he would be
[1:01:23] and yet God would allow him to come into
[1:01:25] this Earth and be what he was
[1:01:29] because it fit in God's plan
[1:01:33] and you say man well God could have said
[1:01:35] well I don't want uh you know in his in
[1:01:37] his foreknowledge he could have he could
[1:01:39] have saw this if I if I if I allow
[1:01:41] pharaoh to be born this is what he's
[1:01:42] going to be this what he's going to do
[1:01:44] this is the nature and and and and and I
[1:01:46] I could sin my Prophet to him and and
[1:01:48] give him the message of the hour and
[1:01:50] he'd refuse it reject it even though I
[1:01:52] do sign so he could have said well I'm
[1:01:54] just going to scratch that idea I don't
[1:01:56] want a pharaoh as such a man as him to
[1:01:58] be ever be born
[1:02:00] that God allowed him to be born to fit
[1:02:03] his plan
[1:02:04] ain't that right well look at this
[1:02:06] Romans 9 17 for the scripture saith unto
[1:02:09] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[1:02:12] I raised thee up that I might show my
[1:02:15] power in thee and that my name might be
[1:02:18] declared throughout all the Earth and
[1:02:20] yet Pharaoh never accepted God he he
[1:02:23] never amen surrendered his will to God
[1:02:26] but yet God knew that God knew he
[1:02:29] wouldn't do it and yet he would have him
[1:02:31] to be born come into this Earth set upon
[1:02:34] the throne amen just forward the sole
[1:02:37] purpose that God's power might be
[1:02:39] magnified
[1:02:42] so the actions of Lucifer never caught
[1:02:44] God by surprise God already knew what
[1:02:46] would happen God knew what Cain would be
[1:02:49] and how he would be born and yet he
[1:02:52] permitted it to happen
[1:02:53] he knew that Cain would not accept the
[1:02:56] Revelation that Abel had
[1:02:58] ain't that right so so we find that God
[1:03:01] purpose within himself he purposed
[1:03:05] within himself to save Mankind and he
[1:03:08] had a plan as to how he would do it
[1:03:10] ain't that right but yet again he knew
[1:03:14] that all men would not accept his
[1:03:17] provided plan
[1:03:19] ain't that right but he could have
[1:03:21] stopped it from men from from rejecting
[1:03:24] him by not letting them be born that he
[1:03:27] allowed it to happen
[1:03:30] ain't that right God purpose to to give
[1:03:33] man a protection
[1:03:35] not not guns not weapons not not like
[1:03:38] that his protection would be his word
[1:03:41] ain't that right it's protection but yet
[1:03:44] he knew that the majority of people
[1:03:45] today would turn it down
[1:03:47] ain't that right yet he permitted them
[1:03:50] to be born anyhow anyway so to fulfill
[1:03:54] amen his plan it was all in his plan you
[1:03:58] see as we've been taught there has to be
[1:04:00] a contrast between right and wrong there
[1:04:03] has to be a contrast between good and
[1:04:05] evil there there has to be a contrast
[1:04:07] between light and darkness the truth and
[1:04:10] the LIE honesty and deception all of
[1:04:13] these things and and what it does is
[1:04:15] Darkness magnifies what God is because
[1:04:17] he is light
[1:04:19] ain't that right amen we we would never
[1:04:21] know God we would never value what God
[1:04:23] is if we hadn't experienced the darkness
[1:04:26] in our life
[1:04:27] we we would know the the protection of
[1:04:30] God if we never needed that protection
[1:04:32] we would never know God as a savior
[1:04:34] except we needed to be saved so God had
[1:04:38] to allow these things he permitted man
[1:04:40] he permitted he created the devil
[1:04:42] knowing what he would do he would tempt
[1:04:44] Eve he created Eve knowing what she
[1:04:46] would do
[1:04:48] ain't that Ryan
[1:04:50] now notice uh uh Paul says in First
[1:04:53] Corinthians the 11th chapter and 18th
[1:04:55] verse first of all when you come
[1:04:57] together in the church I hear that there
[1:04:59] be divisions among you and I partly
[1:05:00] believe it for there must be everybody
[1:05:03] must be also heresies among you that why
[1:05:08] why what's must there be heresies among
[1:05:11] you that they which are approved may be
[1:05:13] manifest among you ain't that right so
[1:05:16] the make-believer shows the unbeliever
[1:05:18] ain't that right amen defeat shows
[1:05:21] victory everything is a contrast
[1:05:26] it's true
[1:05:27] amen so division has to come just to
[1:05:30] show up to Unity
[1:05:32] see things prove the people as to what
[1:05:36] they are
[1:05:37] ain't that right so so there there had
[1:05:40] to be somebody a man when Jesus come to
[1:05:43] the Earth amen now the Bible says he was
[1:05:46] foreordained the lamb slain before the
[1:05:48] foundation of the world so he was
[1:05:50] already predestinated for ordained to be
[1:05:52] the Lamb of God when he came to this
[1:05:55] earth he had a Ministry well there there
[1:05:58] had to be people on the Earth that would
[1:06:01] believe him as the Messiah to accept him
[1:06:04] as as the Messiah but then there also
[1:06:07] had to be a people on the Earth that
[1:06:10] would crucify him
[1:06:12] ain't that right for it was already
[1:06:14] declared that he would be crucified he
[1:06:17] would die and he would take our sins as
[1:06:19] our substitute
[1:06:22] ain't that right
[1:06:24] so see there's not one person who has
[1:06:27] been on Earth or is currently now living
[1:06:30] on Earth that is not fulfilling the plan
[1:06:33] that God has for them
[1:06:35] the devil Works according to God's plan
[1:06:38] do you realize that so everything that
[1:06:41] happens in our life is according to the
[1:06:43] plan of God
[1:06:46] it's true The Good The Bad
[1:06:48] it's happening for God's purpose we go
[1:06:52] through sad times we go through happy
[1:06:53] times we go through through great times
[1:06:55] lonely times we we go where we're up on
[1:06:58] the mountain then we're in the valleys
[1:07:00] and and and and it seems like ours our
[1:07:02] life has more than four seasons
[1:07:08] and and yet Romans 8 28 says and we know
[1:07:12] that all things work together for good
[1:07:15] to them that love God to them who are
[1:07:18] the cold according to his purpose ain't
[1:07:20] that right so if the devil's bothering
[1:07:22] you it's still working for your good if
[1:07:25] you're going through a valley it's still
[1:07:27] working for your good if you're going
[1:07:30] through a time of loneliness and you
[1:07:32] don't understand and everything just
[1:07:34] seems to be caving in it's still working
[1:07:36] for your good
[1:07:38] because God's Got A Plan
[1:07:41] he's got a wheel
[1:07:43] and believe it or not sunny days ain't
[1:07:45] always just part of the will of God
[1:07:48] cloudy days rainy days
[1:07:51] the sun helps to crop the rain helps the
[1:07:53] crop
[1:07:54] and you got to have both days
[1:07:57] ain't that right
[1:07:59] So the plan of God if I could set this
[1:08:01] way the plan of God includes everyone in
[1:08:04] some way or another
[1:08:06] now the the prophet of God taught us
[1:08:09] that God has a permissive will and a
[1:08:11] perfect will
[1:08:13] and and uh uh the the permissive will is
[1:08:18] something that God has permitted to
[1:08:20] happen permitted to be but it is
[1:08:23] something that is only temporary
[1:08:26] you with me
[1:08:27] see so most everything that you see in
[1:08:31] this world
[1:08:33] I'd say 99 percent
[1:08:36] of the things that you see in this world
[1:08:38] or abide the permissive will of God
[1:08:42] see the world and its condition is
[1:08:44] permitted by God but it's only temporary
[1:08:47] this world's got to fall apart
[1:08:50] it's got to see civilization as we know
[1:08:52] it's got to Cease the politics have got
[1:08:54] to come to its end everything is coming
[1:08:56] to its end
[1:08:57] it was permitted by God but it wasn't to
[1:09:01] remain
[1:09:03] ain't that right the trials that we face
[1:09:05] is permitted by God but it's only
[1:09:07] temporary you realize our sinful life
[1:09:10] was only permitted by God but it's only
[1:09:14] temporary
[1:09:16] man
[1:09:17] the sacrificial lamb of the Old
[1:09:19] Testament was was permitted by God but
[1:09:22] was abolished when the true lamb come
[1:09:25] it was permitted but it wasn't the main
[1:09:28] the the main purpose or the the the
[1:09:30] perfect will
[1:09:34] now I I will say to you today we are
[1:09:37] coming can you repeat that with me we
[1:09:40] are coming to the perfect will of God
[1:09:44] that's why the world is shaking that's
[1:09:47] why politics is is is is is the way they
[1:09:50] are that's why the governments the
[1:09:51] Nations everything is shaking the way it
[1:09:54] is I mean Paul even told us there uh
[1:09:57] well God says not only will I shake the
[1:09:59] the the heavens I'll shake the Earth
[1:10:02] also and and there's going to be a great
[1:10:04] shaking and that which can be shaken
[1:10:06] will be shaken and that which we can we
[1:10:08] can will remain which shall remain and
[1:10:12] and so that which remains is the perfect
[1:10:14] will of God and and and politics is not
[1:10:17] in the perfect will of God our
[1:10:20] automobiles are not the perfect will of
[1:10:22] God everything that we have according to
[1:10:24] science and education and it's it's
[1:10:26] brought us a long ways but it's not the
[1:10:28] perfect will of God actually those
[1:10:30] things are killing us faster it's making
[1:10:32] us weaker it's it's making us more
[1:10:34] sickly
[1:10:38] the kingdoms of this world is of the
[1:10:42] devil and that's what he says that's
[1:10:44] what the devil said uh to Jesus at Mount
[1:10:47] uh not Mount Transfiguration but the uh
[1:10:50] temptation
[1:10:51] when he was tempted for 40 days he said
[1:10:53] all these kingdoms belong to me
[1:10:58] amen God's God's perfect Kingdom God's
[1:11:01] God's perfect desire will for a kingdom
[1:11:03] is not fussing and fighting killing one
[1:11:06] another
[1:11:09] can you say Amen
[1:11:11] amen and and the thing is is people want
[1:11:13] to hold on to these things
[1:11:15] they're wanting America to keep lasting
[1:11:17] and and I'm glad to be an American I'm
[1:11:20] I'm not anti-American but I'm telling
[1:11:22] you what the Bible says it ain't it
[1:11:24] ain't just America it's it's all the
[1:11:26] world we're going to change
[1:11:29] and not just that our bodies for in for
[1:11:31] corruption cannot inherit corruption
[1:11:34] there's going to be a changing of our
[1:11:36] bodies
[1:11:38] sickness is is a permissive will of God
[1:11:42] and you say Amen uh uh uh trials and
[1:11:46] headaches and and all of these things
[1:11:48] that we go through
[1:11:50] Temptations It's it's only a permissive
[1:11:52] will of God
[1:11:54] to work something within us
[1:11:57] and to show what God really is
[1:12:01] so we're coming to the perfect will of
[1:12:03] God not what God permitted that what God
[1:12:06] ordained
[1:12:08] now most people hate the perfect will of
[1:12:10] God and and I have to say it because
[1:12:12] it's because they weren't ordained to it
[1:12:15] and and I'm going to use this scripture
[1:12:17] and and I I think it's applicable but
[1:12:20] Paul would tell us there in First
[1:12:22] Corinthians 13 that which is done in
[1:12:24] part shall be taken away when that which
[1:12:26] is perfect has come
[1:12:28] there's some things that have to be done
[1:12:30] away with
[1:12:32] and and and and and
[1:12:34] you can you say well that's that's out
[1:12:36] of the context of what Paul is saying
[1:12:38] I'm telling you well everything about us
[1:12:43] that is temporal has to be done away
[1:12:45] with
[1:12:46] and can only be temporal or done away
[1:12:48] with when that which is perfect is come
[1:12:51] and you say man and we know that which
[1:12:54] is perfect is here
[1:12:56] and he's going to change it all back to
[1:12:58] what he wanted it to be in the first
[1:13:00] place and that's what's in our soul is
[1:13:02] Desiring for the perfect will of God to
[1:13:05] be done
[1:13:07] if not we just go pick it like everybody
[1:13:09] else does if not we just get into big
[1:13:12] frenzy like everybody else does on the
[1:13:14] on politics
[1:13:15] and government and all of these things
[1:13:17] but we're not worried about them things
[1:13:19] Jesus said when you see these things and
[1:13:21] begin to see these Saints lift your head
[1:13:23] up your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:13:25] it's the perfect will of God coming
[1:13:31] now are are we just robots that that do
[1:13:36] as we're told
[1:13:40] that's computed in us no sir
[1:13:44] according to the Bible we're free moral
[1:13:46] agents
[1:13:48] ain't that right
[1:13:49] meaning that we have the right to choose
[1:13:51] and what we want to do and what we don't
[1:13:54] want to do and and we may even call that
[1:13:56] a right but
[1:13:58] I call it a responsibility that is
[1:14:00] weighed Upon Our shoulders
[1:14:02] it's laid upon us and and we read this
[1:14:04] scripture last Wednesday Deuteronomy 30
[1:14:07] and 19 God says I call Heaven and Earth
[1:14:11] to record this day against you that I
[1:14:13] have set before you life and death
[1:14:15] blessings and cursing therefore choose
[1:14:17] life
[1:14:19] that both thou and thy seed may live
[1:14:21] ain't that right
[1:14:23] so we've been set on free moral agency
[1:14:25] and that's the way it was with man in
[1:14:27] the beginning Adam and Eve they God told
[1:14:30] them what to do and what not to do and
[1:14:33] then gave them the choice they had to
[1:14:36] choose
[1:14:37] what what they would do now it's not
[1:14:40] that God didn't know what they would do
[1:14:43] but yet they had to do it they had to
[1:14:45] make it
[1:14:48] ain't that right
[1:14:49] so God didn't make Eve do what she did
[1:14:54] he didn't make her do it but he knows
[1:14:56] she would do it
[1:14:58] ain't that right so she had to make her
[1:15:00] choice between God's word and Satan's
[1:15:03] lie
[1:15:04] two reports what God Said and what that
[1:15:07] serpent said ain't that right and of
[1:15:09] course she chose what the lie and walked
[1:15:13] in God's permissive will
[1:15:15] the Rich Young Ruler was given the
[1:15:17] choice
[1:15:18] uh to sell all that he had and to follow
[1:15:20] Jesus Jesus himself gave him the
[1:15:23] opportunity
[1:15:25] he had the choice man we know what what
[1:15:28] he did he made the choice not to do that
[1:15:30] and yet the Bible says that Jesus loved
[1:15:32] this man
[1:15:33] he loved this young man and yet he could
[1:15:36] not tamper with the choice
[1:15:40] hello
[1:15:43] so see being a free moral agent you can
[1:15:46] take an attitude against something or
[1:15:47] you can take an attitude for it
[1:15:49] something it's just like God can send a
[1:15:52] gift to us
[1:15:53] uh uh but it depends on what attitude
[1:15:56] you take towards it
[1:15:58] God sent his son
[1:16:00] to be a gift to the world
[1:16:02] ain't that right
[1:16:04] well we find that that the woman with
[1:16:07] the issue of blood in her mind in her
[1:16:10] heart she said within herself if I can
[1:16:12] just but touch the hymn of her garment I
[1:16:14] shall be whole
[1:16:16] doctors she had tried doctors she had
[1:16:18] spent all of her money and she only grew
[1:16:20] worse she said if I can touch them if I
[1:16:23] can just touch the Garment I don't even
[1:16:24] have to he don't have to touch me you
[1:16:25] don't have to see me you don't have to
[1:16:27] say anything to me you don't have to
[1:16:28] have a vision of me or anything if I can
[1:16:30] just Touch the Hem of His Garment
[1:16:32] that'll do it for me
[1:16:34] and she touched the Hem of her garment
[1:16:37] and she received her healing now the
[1:16:40] Roman soldiers slapped him in the face
[1:16:41] touched him
[1:16:43] spit upon him and he did not get the
[1:16:46] same virtue he didn't feel nothing
[1:16:50] that that woman did with the issue of
[1:16:52] blood it's the attitude that they took
[1:16:54] toward him
[1:16:56] then you say man see so so he had done
[1:16:59] Miracles and he had done this and he had
[1:17:01] done all kinds of things Jesus did but
[1:17:03] the Bible says he went into one town in
[1:17:04] his own town I believe it was and and
[1:17:07] did not one miracle
[1:17:11] see it was their attitude that they took
[1:17:13] toward Jesus
[1:17:15] ain't that right see so we find that God
[1:17:18] is not making us do anything that we
[1:17:20] don't want to do people are not made to
[1:17:22] go to hell
[1:17:23] people are are not made to sin man is
[1:17:26] not made to sin
[1:17:28] God doesn't make us live in sin and and
[1:17:31] and I'll be honest the devil doesn't
[1:17:33] make you live in sin either
[1:17:35] you're a free moral agent if the devil
[1:17:37] can make you do something then you're
[1:17:39] not a free moral agent
[1:17:41] and you say man
[1:17:43] many times we blame the devil for our
[1:17:45] sins but you cannot blame the devil
[1:17:48] brother Brown said this could you
[1:17:50] imagine Noah going up and say well
[1:17:51] perhaps I'd better build me an ark
[1:17:53] because it might rain no the word of God
[1:17:55] was revealed to him why if he had just
[1:17:57] took it like that see the first golfer
[1:18:00] come by and say well look at that little
[1:18:01] old holy ruler well he would have thrown
[1:18:03] the whole thing up and said my let's
[1:18:05] quit
[1:18:06] see that's the way people do when you
[1:18:08] say I started that the devil made me go
[1:18:11] back
[1:18:12] he says the devil didn't make you do
[1:18:14] that you did it yourself
[1:18:16] people backslide and the devil didn't do
[1:18:18] it they did it let's just face it now
[1:18:25] so everyone that comes to God has got to
[1:18:28] be tempted and tried do you believe that
[1:18:31] and and and and you young people realize
[1:18:33] that now you're going to be tempted and
[1:18:35] tried not every part of your life is
[1:18:37] going to be sunny days
[1:18:40] now you know to where you're just
[1:18:41] feeling so great and feeling like a
[1:18:43] Christian feeling on top of the mountain
[1:18:44] like I'm gonna make it
[1:18:46] there's gonna be time that you're going
[1:18:48] to be so discouraged so low and
[1:18:49] everybody ain't gonna be patting you on
[1:18:51] the back
[1:18:53] but you got to be have that
[1:18:55] for everyone that comes to God's got to
[1:18:57] be tempted and tried ain't that right
[1:18:59] but see a a real believer that has heard
[1:19:02] the word of God he recognizes it to be
[1:19:04] the word of God and then acts upon it
[1:19:07] and you say man people claim to have the
[1:19:10] Holy Ghost and yet live so worldly and
[1:19:12] they say well the devil made me do it
[1:19:13] but you know the Bible says in Ephesians
[1:19:15] 4 30 it says grieve not the spirit of
[1:19:18] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[1:19:22] of your Redemption what SEALs you the
[1:19:25] Holy Spirit ain't that right the spirit
[1:19:26] of God seals an individual a man to the
[1:19:30] day of their Redemption seals them into
[1:19:33] the body and seal means that you are
[1:19:36] what secured
[1:19:38] now just say bear with me now the seal
[1:19:40] means that you are secured it's to your
[1:19:44] uh uh uh uh destination ain't that right
[1:19:47] so the Holy Spirit cannot be broken
[1:19:50] brother Brown said see you you all heard
[1:19:52] me say that people say whether the devil
[1:19:54] made me do this no the devil didn't do
[1:19:56] it you just wasn't sealed in
[1:19:58] so calls when you're sealed in he's
[1:20:01] sealed out
[1:20:02] and he says now you went out to him he
[1:20:05] couldn't get into you because the only
[1:20:07] way he'd get into you is come to the
[1:20:09] same process that you have and then he'd
[1:20:12] be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy
[1:20:13] Ghost then he'd be your brother
[1:20:15] ain't that right so he says you just
[1:20:17] went to the borderline come back less
[1:20:19] than for the things of the world he
[1:20:21] never went in all the way over into
[1:20:23] Canaan across Jordan the death to itself
[1:20:27] ain't that right now just in the natural
[1:20:30] uh uh because that we are free moral
[1:20:33] agents nobody no nobody can make you uh
[1:20:38] maybe be a bad analogy but we'll say you
[1:20:42] know make you eat the food you want to
[1:20:44] eat
[1:20:46] my my little ones might attest to that I
[1:20:50] don't like broccoli but I gotta eat it
[1:20:54] if you're driving down the road
[1:20:56] and and and there's no one that can tell
[1:21:00] you you know you you you go here and you
[1:21:02] go to this certain restaurant and and
[1:21:05] you uh you eat there
[1:21:07] no what what these companies do what
[1:21:10] these restaurants do what is they they
[1:21:12] have these Billboards they have these uh
[1:21:16] TV commercials they have these radio
[1:21:18] commercials they they do everything they
[1:21:21] can to influence you to turn off that
[1:21:25] exit
[1:21:26] and go to whatever McDonald's or
[1:21:29] whatever
[1:21:30] they make it so appealing that you would
[1:21:33] choose
[1:21:36] never been a time that I was forced by
[1:21:39] gun to walk into Outback
[1:21:47] so all they can do is entice you
[1:21:50] so to influence your decision
[1:21:52] I have you know I go if you go to the
[1:21:55] fair you go somewhere like that or the
[1:21:57] where the food vendors are
[1:22:00] I like going you know where the food
[1:22:03] vendors are
[1:22:04] because there's such an aroma
[1:22:07] and it makes you hungry and you're like
[1:22:10] man
[1:22:12] you know I don't know if y'all have I
[1:22:14] haven't uh but you walk out of the
[1:22:17] restaurant and you're full but there's
[1:22:18] another restaurant and there's smell
[1:22:20] that smell that they're cooking is just
[1:22:22] rifted right drifted right under your
[1:22:24] nostrils and
[1:22:25] ah that smells good well you know it's
[1:22:29] it's a something to entice
[1:22:31] but you know and you come under that
[1:22:34] influence and and you know
[1:22:37] if you you know you I gotta make note we
[1:22:39] got to go there again we got to go there
[1:22:41] sometime or forget it I'm going now
[1:22:43] you know and and and
[1:22:46] you you know someone's well but the
[1:22:49] price is high who cares it smells good
[1:22:52] man you know but but what they've done
[1:22:55] is they've been able to channel that to
[1:22:57] where it calls you to choose to code to
[1:22:59] their place
[1:23:01] well then I've also been you know place
[1:23:04] you know where you smell that and you're
[1:23:05] like man that smells good and the next
[1:23:07] person beside you you're like that is
[1:23:09] nasty
[1:23:11] and and they get sick
[1:23:14] brother Andrew
[1:23:18] and and you're like why man
[1:23:21] I mean
[1:23:23] so but it makes them walk away so so
[1:23:25] what I'm saying is free moral agency got
[1:23:28] in intended for this to happen
[1:23:31] and and which means that the devil
[1:23:34] cannot make you do something that you
[1:23:37] don't want
[1:23:38] and God does not make you do something
[1:23:41] that you don't want
[1:23:43] hello see but it's whether or not each
[1:23:48] one can influence you to choose
[1:23:51] now I'm just going to keep on going here
[1:23:53] but in your first birth you are a sinner
[1:23:56] because Adam represented you
[1:23:58] ain't that right you're born in sin
[1:24:01] you're Renegade to start with
[1:24:04] in every one of us and we could not help
[1:24:06] ourselves so the question was asked how
[1:24:09] are we ever going to be saved
[1:24:11] we're already Sinners because Adam
[1:24:14] represented us we had no choice in that
[1:24:16] matter
[1:24:17] ain't that right
[1:24:19] but then the prophet says but Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ came to receive represent us
[1:24:24] before God as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:24:27] and he sent the holy spirit that is now
[1:24:30] brooding over the place trying to bring
[1:24:33] us back to birth to die out to ourselves
[1:24:36] and be reborn again to Sons and
[1:24:39] Daughters of God to take God at his word
[1:24:42] and to believe God's word
[1:24:45] so see in your old birth that that sex
[1:24:47] Birth by your your parents you you were
[1:24:50] born a sinner and and and and you were a
[1:24:53] sinner by representation
[1:24:55] ain't that right but it's in your new
[1:24:57] birth
[1:24:59] that you have a representation by Christ
[1:25:03] that your new birth is greater than your
[1:25:06] old birth
[1:25:08] your old birth was just temporary
[1:25:11] he was a sinner but that was temporary
[1:25:13] God didn't see you as a sinner in his
[1:25:16] mind God didn't plan for you in his
[1:25:19] perfect will to be a rock no good
[1:25:21] scumbag
[1:25:24] but he permitted it
[1:25:26] that he might be your savior not just
[1:25:28] your father your savior your Redeemer
[1:25:31] your healer your deliverer so God would
[1:25:35] permit this thing can you say man but
[1:25:37] I'm telling you right now if God Saves
[1:25:39] you he doesn't want to look at you as a
[1:25:41] sinner
[1:25:44] and if you're ever sealed by the Holy
[1:25:46] Ghost you can never be a sinner again
[1:25:51] you're sealed
[1:25:54] and you say Amen you're sealed
[1:25:57] so in your new birth you're a Christian
[1:25:58] by representation in Christ the second
[1:26:01] Adam now Paul calls him that I believe
[1:26:03] the second man Adam
[1:26:05] see the first Adam represented you and
[1:26:08] you're a sinner because he fell
[1:26:11] but the second man Adam come and he
[1:26:13] never fell
[1:26:15] and he went to Calvary and he paid your
[1:26:17] debt he was representing you
[1:26:23] I didn't have the choice as to how I was
[1:26:26] born
[1:26:30] or how I was when I was born
[1:26:32] we didn't have them choices God made us
[1:26:35] the way we are
[1:26:37] ain't that right he gave us our own
[1:26:40] personality gave us our stature he gave
[1:26:42] us whatever it is
[1:26:44] so we are what we are in our natural
[1:26:47] birth
[1:26:48] without a choice
[1:26:52] maybe some have a problem with lying
[1:26:54] maybe some have problem with rebelling
[1:26:57] maybe some have a problem with temper
[1:26:59] whatever but that comes by your natural
[1:27:01] birth
[1:27:03] sinful nature
[1:27:05] but notice what what brother Brown says
[1:27:08] if he made me what I am without having a
[1:27:11] choice and yet I was made in God's image
[1:27:14] and brought forth yet through a sinful
[1:27:15] act that God permitted to be done a her
[1:27:18] uh a a a perverted act by holy wedlock
[1:27:21] from mother and father if the spirit
[1:27:24] moves me or Woos and we come back and
[1:27:27] say yes we make our choice yes great God
[1:27:30] you made me and I loved you and you're
[1:27:32] my Creator and I'm sinful and I'm
[1:27:34] ashamed of it then he places in me
[1:27:37] eternal life
[1:27:39] then if he gives me eternal life by me
[1:27:42] answering back to his call the choice
[1:27:46] see and made me what I am without having
[1:27:48] a choice how much more can he raise me
[1:27:51] up after I've made that choice and field
[1:27:53] been filled with the Holy Spirit see the
[1:27:56] holy spirit is God's own life and you
[1:27:58] can know no more lose that life than God
[1:28:02] can lose himself
[1:28:04] why because the life that he imparts to
[1:28:07] you is an eternal life
[1:28:10] but that life is imparted by the choice
[1:28:12] you've made
[1:28:14] you don't have the choice about the
[1:28:16] nature you had when you was born in your
[1:28:19] natural birth
[1:28:20] but when he come wooing you
[1:28:22] said come to me
[1:28:24] you made that choice
[1:28:26] and he gave you his own life
[1:28:29] you can never lose that life
[1:28:31] can you say man it's an eternal life
[1:28:34] I trust that we've all here have made
[1:28:36] the decision to accept Christ
[1:28:38] as our personal savior
[1:28:42] and that we've all received the Holy
[1:28:45] Ghost and if you haven't
[1:28:47] you you you must be born again
[1:28:51] you need the Holy Ghost more than
[1:28:53] anything in your life
[1:28:55] you need the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:28:57] the Seal of God upon your life and
[1:28:59] that's the approval that's God's showing
[1:29:02] his approval of your faith in him
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:07] the Seal of God
[1:29:09] but a man that is saved doesn't have to
[1:29:12] get saved over and over and over again
[1:29:16] a man that is filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:18] doesn't have to keep getting the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost to make sure that he's not lost
[1:29:25] I understand there's the refeeling of
[1:29:27] the Holy Ghost and we all need that
[1:29:29] but it does not make you more saved than
[1:29:33] the first one
[1:29:37] if you genuinely got the Holy Ghost
[1:29:39] that's the seal God sealed you and as
[1:29:42] the Bible says then you cease from all
[1:29:44] your labors
[1:29:45] you've entered to God's rest
[1:29:47] which is an eternal rest
[1:29:52] but having said that spiritual growth is
[1:29:56] something that we all have to have and
[1:29:59] we all must want is spiritual growth
[1:30:03] and if you've received the life of God
[1:30:05] within you then that life must grow
[1:30:08] ain't that right
[1:30:10] and and I I will I was talking to uh
[1:30:14] Mark the other day and and I was
[1:30:16] explaining to him
[1:30:18] a little bit we talked about it before
[1:30:21] here but when when a mother is Mama is
[1:30:24] expecting a child
[1:30:26] she's got life within her different than
[1:30:29] her own it's it's a it's but it's it's a
[1:30:32] a body that is growing
[1:30:35] that mother begins to take on different
[1:30:37] appetites different things and
[1:30:40] and and and things that she used to like
[1:30:43] she doesn't like
[1:30:44] some of the things that she's never
[1:30:46] liked she's beginning to like now
[1:30:48] developing a taste she's craving it
[1:30:51] and it's not mama that's craving it it's
[1:30:53] that body within her
[1:30:55] that's craving for this life or craving
[1:30:57] for these things and it's it's calling
[1:30:59] it's not calling out for something
[1:31:00] foreign it's calling for things that
[1:31:03] were already there what it's made of
[1:31:05] and it's developing and it's got to have
[1:31:07] these things in order to to to to to to
[1:31:10] develop correctly
[1:31:12] ain't that right well see that's that's
[1:31:15] that life but but it's a body and and
[1:31:18] and so now the the the body that that
[1:31:20] little baby is forming but it's living
[1:31:23] off the life of Mama
[1:31:26] but but when we're born again we receive
[1:31:28] another life that's within us ain't that
[1:31:31] right we see receive another life that's
[1:31:34] within us and then all of a sudden we
[1:31:36] start craving things that we never crave
[1:31:38] before
[1:31:40] we we start Desiring things that we
[1:31:42] never we never had a desire for we start
[1:31:45] liking things that we never liked before
[1:31:48] and what is it it's a life
[1:31:51] it's not the body like the baby and the
[1:31:53] mother of her womb it's a life
[1:31:57] it's the literal life of God that is
[1:32:00] developing within this whole body
[1:32:05] then you say man but it's an eternal
[1:32:08] life
[1:32:09] and the things of this world is foreign
[1:32:12] to that life
[1:32:13] so it starts craving something eternal
[1:32:17] craving a a new body craving uh uh a
[1:32:22] fellowship with God craving a place
[1:32:24] where we'll never die never get sick
[1:32:26] never get old again
[1:32:28] something that is craving
[1:32:31] within this whole body
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:36] Say Amen
[1:32:39] so see that life
[1:32:41] calls for growth
[1:32:45] it has to grow
[1:32:47] is that right
[1:32:49] in in order for it to grow now
[1:32:53] you're faced with choices
[1:32:55] every day
[1:32:57] something that maybe if you were relaxed
[1:33:00] if you're just a sinner you were more
[1:33:01] relaxed
[1:33:03] but all of a sudden there's something in
[1:33:04] you
[1:33:06] just ain't gonna let you get get content
[1:33:08] with life here in this world
[1:33:10] something within you that just keeps
[1:33:12] craving
[1:33:13] but you got to make choices
[1:33:16] and you say man
[1:33:18] for me to think
[1:33:20] that because I chose to accept Christ as
[1:33:22] my savior and he filled me with this
[1:33:24] Spirit based off my choice that that's
[1:33:26] the only choice that counts that's wrong
[1:33:29] can you say Amen
[1:33:31] now now and and I won't keep you much
[1:33:34] longer but Matthew 16 24. it says then
[1:33:37] Jesus said unto his disciples If any man
[1:33:39] will come after me
[1:33:41] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:33:44] cross and follow me
[1:33:46] now this wasn't this didn't happen just
[1:33:48] when you got saved and then that's it
[1:33:51] when you gave except to the Lord as your
[1:33:53] personal savior then that's it
[1:33:55] you're not just coasting now well I got
[1:33:57] filled with the Holy Ghost so I just
[1:33:58] coast and happy go lucky we just do
[1:34:00] anything we want to no no no no that's
[1:34:02] not true
[1:34:03] hello
[1:34:05] that's not true you got to take up your
[1:34:07] cross
[1:34:08] everybody say I gotta take up my cross
[1:34:11] now notice this he takes up his cross
[1:34:14] and follows now cross is a symbol of
[1:34:17] death and agony
[1:34:19] now the prophet says he that will be a
[1:34:21] Christian let him strip himself of his
[1:34:23] own thoughts let him strip himself of
[1:34:26] his own works let him strip himself of
[1:34:28] everything denying himself and take up
[1:34:30] that consecrated cross and follow daily
[1:34:35] daily ain't that right so every one of
[1:34:38] us has to follow daily if we're going to
[1:34:41] serve God and we've made that choice God
[1:34:43] I'm going to serve you I give you my
[1:34:45] heart I don't want nothing else because
[1:34:46] you've got to keep making them choices
[1:34:53] in the prayer
[1:34:57] that Jesus taught us to pray in one part
[1:35:00] it says we pray thy will
[1:35:02] not my will be done but thine be done
[1:35:06] in Earth as it is in heaven
[1:35:08] ain't that right
[1:35:10] and and you gave your heart to the Lord
[1:35:13] filled with the Holy Ghost but that
[1:35:15] doesn't complete all God's will in you
[1:35:20] hello
[1:35:22] so we we find that God now we we find
[1:35:25] we're wanting to know God's will there's
[1:35:27] something that is craving to know
[1:35:29] craving Desiring to walk in God's will I
[1:35:32] I just can't be happy go lucky anymore
[1:35:35] he used to be happy-go-lucky if the
[1:35:37] friends want me to go here I just went
[1:35:38] just have a good old time can't do that
[1:35:40] no more something's in me calling
[1:35:43] something else
[1:35:45] I'm becoming more heavily minded I don't
[1:35:47] understand everything but something's
[1:35:49] calling
[1:35:50] ain't that right see so so then you're
[1:35:54] you're you're you're bought with the
[1:35:56] price something that life has now
[1:35:58] possessed your body
[1:36:02] let's change your desires
[1:36:05] change your motives changed everything
[1:36:08] ain't that right we live in a day where
[1:36:10] where where where uh I don't I can't
[1:36:13] remember what kind of a generation this
[1:36:14] is Generation X GX GC whatever you know
[1:36:17] whatever anyway these Millennials is
[1:36:20] that it did I get it right millennials
[1:36:22] but we're living in a time of
[1:36:24] happy-go-lucky no responsibility
[1:36:27] we don't think about choices who cares
[1:36:29] about choices live like now
[1:36:31] you know and and and you've got you've
[1:36:34] got these young people destroying I've
[1:36:37] been reading where they they go to a gas
[1:36:39] station and and hundreds of them and
[1:36:41] they'll just sit there and just break
[1:36:43] glass and Rob and Rob and take
[1:36:45] everything out and who's gonna catch
[1:36:47] them
[1:36:48] they're they're they're becoming
[1:36:49] absolutely out of control
[1:36:55] video game life is worthless to them
[1:36:59] you understand what I'm saying they feed
[1:37:01] on video games they feed off this no
[1:37:03] responsibility take out the trash what
[1:37:04] is trash
[1:37:06] don't tell me what to do
[1:37:08] why do you go to school to learn what
[1:37:09] trash not only needs his mom or dad tell
[1:37:11] you what it is
[1:37:13] kick you in the city and go do it
[1:37:17] but we don't have responsibilities today
[1:37:20] yeah everybody wants to think for
[1:37:22] themselves and be what they want to be
[1:37:23] and no one's going to tell no
[1:37:24] restrictions but when you're filled with
[1:37:27] the Holy Ghost that stops
[1:37:30] because God takes over from there
[1:37:35] and you say man
[1:37:37] now God has to show us his will so that
[1:37:40] we can know what it is
[1:37:42] now if you're when you're filled with
[1:37:44] the Holy Ghost you start Desiring God
[1:37:46] I want to know your will
[1:37:48] something then you is you're wanting to
[1:37:51] know I want to know I want to know
[1:37:54] and and we find Paul says as it is
[1:37:57] written I didn't write the the scripture
[1:37:58] as far as where it's at but as it is
[1:38:01] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[1:38:03] neither has it entered into the heart of
[1:38:05] man the things that God has prepared for
[1:38:06] them that love him
[1:38:08] but God has revealed unto us by his
[1:38:10] spirit
[1:38:11] for the spirit everybody say the spirit
[1:38:14] searches all things yea the Deep things
[1:38:18] of God
[1:38:19] can you say man
[1:38:21] now the will of God is written out in
[1:38:24] his word you believe it
[1:38:26] the will of God is written out in his
[1:38:28] word but it's hidden to the unbeliever
[1:38:30] to where he cannot see it
[1:38:33] but in this day God has revealed it to
[1:38:36] us through a Vindicated prophet
[1:38:39] and and I I I'll say it this way we have
[1:38:42] found out
[1:38:44] that God's will for our lives in every
[1:38:47] every aspect of Our Lives
[1:38:51] is found in here
[1:38:53] one thing that this message does to us
[1:38:56] it tells us look to hear
[1:38:59] you don't have to have psychologists you
[1:39:01] don't have to have marriage seminars
[1:39:04] you you don't have to have Bible
[1:39:06] Seminary or
[1:39:07] training and counselors and
[1:39:11] you don't have to have all of that
[1:39:14] we have the answers
[1:39:20] God's will for every situation in our
[1:39:23] lives is written in the scriptures
[1:39:27] you name it there it is
[1:39:29] for your marriage for your family for
[1:39:31] your church for your ministry
[1:39:34] for you as an individual
[1:39:37] over employee employer
[1:39:39] running a business everything
[1:39:42] it's all found in the in the word of God
[1:39:45] and you say man
[1:39:47] but his will has to be a personal
[1:39:50] revelation
[1:39:52] to us and then
[1:39:55] we must choose as to whether we're going
[1:39:58] to walk in it or not
[1:40:00] ain't that right
[1:40:01] now now something I I do want to say
[1:40:04] this is in the Old Testament the
[1:40:05] children of Israel asked for the law
[1:40:08] but they had a different reason for
[1:40:10] asking is is they wanted it so that they
[1:40:13] could do something to inherit God's
[1:40:15] favor to Merit God's favor it was a it
[1:40:19] was it was on the basis of God we we can
[1:40:22] do this we got to handle don't you worry
[1:40:23] about it and we want something to do
[1:40:25] with we didn't want it they didn't want
[1:40:26] to accept God's grace they didn't want
[1:40:28] to accept God's unconditional Covenant
[1:40:30] they wanted something else
[1:40:32] so they've done it by their own works
[1:40:34] and they did the law
[1:40:36] but they did not obey it from the heart
[1:40:40] ain't that right so when the testing
[1:40:43] times came they rebelled against the
[1:40:45] word of the Lord when troubles come they
[1:40:48] they they they complained and they
[1:40:49] griped and they argued when God would
[1:40:52] send them through things and temptations
[1:40:54] and when they ran out of food amen they
[1:40:56] start complaining when they run out of
[1:40:58] water they started complaining when
[1:40:59] everything began to complain and to
[1:41:02] gripe and all of these things see it was
[1:41:04] not done from the heart
[1:41:09] ain't that right they grumbled about
[1:41:11] their choices you mean I got up you you
[1:41:14] mean I got to follow that you mean I got
[1:41:17] to go all the way out through this
[1:41:18] Wilderness why why didn't we go through
[1:41:19] the why didn't we go through the Bahamas
[1:41:22] just to get to the promised land
[1:41:26] and you know what their reactions were
[1:41:28] and what they said we added better in
[1:41:30] Egypt 400 years of slaves
[1:41:34] And yet when the Trials come we had it
[1:41:36] better
[1:41:38] see they obeyed not from the heart
[1:41:41] that God God promised and I didn't give
[1:41:43] you this scripture but Ezekiel 36 26.
[1:41:47] he made a promise saying a new heart
[1:41:49] also will I give you and a new spirit
[1:41:51] will I put within you and I will take
[1:41:54] away the Stony heart out of your flesh
[1:41:55] and I will give you in heart a flesh
[1:41:58] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:42:00] cause you to walk in my statues and you
[1:42:03] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[1:42:05] you shall dwell in the land that I gave
[1:42:07] your to your fathers and you shall be my
[1:42:09] people and I will be your God
[1:42:13] so God was looking for a people in his
[1:42:16] plan he knew that there would be a
[1:42:18] people that he would bring to himself
[1:42:21] and he would pour His Spirit into them
[1:42:23] and they would it would cause them to
[1:42:27] desire him
[1:42:30] and notice it was after the day of
[1:42:32] Pentecost that Paul would say you were
[1:42:35] Servants of sin
[1:42:37] but you have obeyed from the heart that
[1:42:39] form of Doctrine which was delivered you
[1:42:42] can you say man
[1:42:44] so even though we have made the decision
[1:42:45] to follow Christ and have received the
[1:42:47] Holy Ghost it does not make our everyday
[1:42:50] decisions easy
[1:42:55] amen
[1:42:59] I think of often times that God shows us
[1:43:03] his will to us
[1:43:06] and down in our hearts we know what he
[1:43:08] wants
[1:43:11] and I'm speaking to you young people now
[1:43:13] he knows we know what he wants
[1:43:16] because there's something in us that it
[1:43:19] tells us
[1:43:20] don't do that
[1:43:21] do this
[1:43:23] do this we know it
[1:43:26] but then yielding
[1:43:29] yielding to that
[1:43:31] is hard for us to do
[1:43:33] and I'm speaking to Holy ghost-filled
[1:43:35] people that's I'm referring to that I
[1:43:37] mean we know the sinner is just
[1:43:39] rebellious
[1:43:40] I'm talking about holy ghost-filled
[1:43:42] people we struggle
[1:43:44] sometimes to yield to God's will
[1:43:49] you say man
[1:43:52] we are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:43:54] children of God and we are children of
[1:43:58] obedience if the world is called by the
[1:44:00] scriptures children of Disobedience and
[1:44:02] God's children are children of obedience
[1:44:06] but it doesn't it's not a cakewalk
[1:44:09] there's the struggles
[1:44:12] because our carnal nature does not want
[1:44:14] to submit to God and we all we all deal
[1:44:16] with the carnal nature
[1:44:19] can you say Amen The Sinner and the Holy
[1:44:22] Ghost
[1:44:23] the Holy Ghost does not do away with our
[1:44:25] Humanity it does not do away with our
[1:44:27] carnal nature we have a human nature
[1:44:29] from our first birth we all know that
[1:44:31] nature carnal he wants to have its own
[1:44:33] way he wants to lie steal cheat Rebel
[1:44:35] and and all of these things it cares
[1:44:37] nothing about God or the will of God
[1:44:39] ain't that right it only seeks to please
[1:44:42] Itself by fulfilling the lust of the
[1:44:43] flesh
[1:44:44] Romans 8 7 the carnal mind is enmity
[1:44:47] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:44:49] law of God neither indeed cannot be it
[1:44:51] can be see so so we are finding out
[1:44:54] today that the Human Nature has no
[1:44:58] boundaries
[1:44:59] as to how far it can go in sin
[1:45:03] homosexuals transgenders
[1:45:06] murders left and right
[1:45:09] I mean I mean even children that that
[1:45:12] you'd never thought possible
[1:45:14] and yet look what's happening it's the
[1:45:16] human nature
[1:45:20] that Satan is working through
[1:45:23] can you say Amen
[1:45:27] and they have nothing to stop it they
[1:45:29] have nothing
[1:45:31] education can't stop it
[1:45:33] well anyways I ain't gonna get into all
[1:45:35] that but education science stuff can
[1:45:37] stop it
[1:45:39] only one thing you see but the Holy
[1:45:41] Ghost Field person has another nature
[1:45:43] living within them
[1:45:46] and you say man you still have that
[1:45:48] human nature
[1:45:50] the brown said as long as you're in this
[1:45:52] life you're going to be sticky and have
[1:45:53] a carnal nature that's going to bother
[1:45:54] you as long as you live but the inside
[1:45:57] of you you're born again
[1:46:00] with God's nature
[1:46:02] can you say man
[1:46:04] see in the Holy Ghost is the nature too
[1:46:06] and it feeds off the word of God
[1:46:09] ain't that right and so we have this
[1:46:12] warring within our members as we talked
[1:46:14] about where where it's it's that human
[1:46:16] nature that carnal nature and and and
[1:46:18] and and God's nature and they're warring
[1:46:22] together
[1:46:23] we read you know where program talk
[1:46:26] about the old Indian chief just got
[1:46:27] converted and someone asked him how are
[1:46:30] you doing Chief and he said well me good
[1:46:32] and me bad and he's like what do you
[1:46:33] mean me good and me bad he's well is
[1:46:35] ever since I got converted I got two
[1:46:36] dogs fighting within me a black dog and
[1:46:38] a white dog and he's just constantly
[1:46:40] fighting one another
[1:46:42] and they asked him so well Chief who
[1:46:44] who's winning he said well it all
[1:46:45] depends which one I feed the most ain't
[1:46:47] that right so and brother Brown said how
[1:46:50] true that is he says it just depends on
[1:46:52] the warring of the body that's in you it
[1:46:54] depends on which one you cater to which
[1:46:57] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[1:47:00] after the things of the world or the
[1:47:01] spiritual nature after the things of God
[1:47:04] ain't that right and the world has been
[1:47:06] feeding off that carnal nature the
[1:47:08] things of the world
[1:47:10] man can we go on and on Hollywood with
[1:47:13] their television has has been the
[1:47:16] inspiration behind these maniacs
[1:47:19] because they feed off of it they feed
[1:47:21] and feed and feed
[1:47:24] ain't that right
[1:47:26] but see being that we are free moral
[1:47:29] agents we have this warring that that is
[1:47:31] within us it causes this warring within
[1:47:34] us
[1:47:35] but if you have the Holy Ghost you have
[1:47:37] the ability everybody say I have the
[1:47:39] ability
[1:47:40] to take God's way
[1:47:44] if you've got the Holy Ghost you have
[1:47:46] that ability
[1:47:48] don't note you've sat there and say well
[1:47:50] I can't help it you can help it
[1:47:55] just make the choice
[1:47:59] nothing happens overnight you know it
[1:48:05] you read about someone killing
[1:48:07] themselves well how's that setting to
[1:48:10] you
[1:48:10] it didn't happen overnight
[1:48:13] you'd been feeding them thoughts
[1:48:16] you've been thinking about things
[1:48:18] Satan been working on him
[1:48:21] ain't that right
[1:48:22] well I'm going to tell you right now
[1:48:23] you're not overcoming overnight
[1:48:27] it ain't just going to be a miracle that
[1:48:28] happens
[1:48:30] the Rapture just ain't a miracle that
[1:48:32] happens
[1:48:33] you gotta think about it
[1:48:35] you gotta dwell upon it you gotta feed
[1:48:39] upon these things
[1:48:40] can you say Amen
[1:48:42] can't just sit there and watch
[1:48:43] television and get waste your life away
[1:48:45] on the movies and the video games and
[1:48:47] the cussing and the swearing and the and
[1:48:48] the filth and the bars and the and the
[1:48:50] hunky Tonks and the sex and all of that
[1:48:53] and then all of a sudden you're in a
[1:48:54] Rapture that ain't gonna happen
[1:48:57] you got to make your choice
[1:49:00] and every day you follow to take up your
[1:49:03] cross
[1:49:07] see the perfect will of God is coming
[1:49:11] and there's a people on this Earth that
[1:49:12] are saying thy will be done
[1:49:15] amen thy kingdom come
[1:49:17] life will be done in earth in me
[1:49:22] God's will must be done in me
[1:49:27] in the will of God is done by us making
[1:49:31] that conscience choice
[1:49:34] God
[1:49:36] I forsake the world for you
[1:49:39] I forsake my negative thoughts I forsake
[1:49:41] my unbelief for you
[1:49:44] just like tonight you're hearing one
[1:49:47] report but you'll go out there and
[1:49:49] you'll hear others
[1:49:50] you can sit in a church and you can hear
[1:49:52] that God Is A Healer and then you go out
[1:49:53] and hear what the doctor says there's no
[1:49:55] hope for you
[1:49:56] it's what choice you wake
[1:49:58] it's what you believe and what you
[1:50:00] decide to believe
[1:50:02] you can go around saying well doctor
[1:50:04] says I ain't going to live so you can go
[1:50:07] lay in bed and cover yourself up and
[1:50:08] just wait to die
[1:50:10] or you can take God in his word and says
[1:50:12] no
[1:50:13] God says he's the god that healeth all
[1:50:15] my diseases
[1:50:16] it's the choice you can either live and
[1:50:18] defeat or you can live in Victory
[1:50:21] you understand what I'm saying
[1:50:23] and and so
[1:50:26] the nature of God is within you crying
[1:50:29] out for the will of God to be done in
[1:50:30] your life but it does not take away the
[1:50:34] responsibility of you choosing
[1:50:37] if if you allow me to read this
[1:50:39] scripture before we close Romans 6 and
[1:50:41] 12 let not sin
[1:50:44] therefore reign in your mortal body that
[1:50:46] you should obey it in the lusts thereof
[1:50:49] see you you fulfill sin by your own
[1:50:52] lusts
[1:50:53] and then lust has got to die
[1:50:55] can you say man
[1:50:57] the Holy Ghost does not you have in the
[1:50:59] Holy Ghost does not take away that that
[1:51:01] them things Temptations and all that
[1:51:03] that's how the devil's able to tempt you
[1:51:07] is is Through The Human Side the
[1:51:09] passions and all of that
[1:51:13] when you say man
[1:51:17] so neither yield you your members as
[1:51:19] members of unrighteousness Unto sin but
[1:51:22] yield everybody say yield yourselves to
[1:51:25] God
[1:51:26] as those that are alive from the dead in
[1:51:28] your room your members as instruments of
[1:51:31] righteousness unto God for sin I wish I
[1:51:34] could just have a time to preach it but
[1:51:36] sin shall not
[1:51:39] have dominion over you
[1:51:42] sin shall not have dominion over you for
[1:51:46] you are not under the law but under
[1:51:48] grace What then shall we sin because we
[1:51:52] are not under the law but under grace
[1:51:53] God forbid
[1:51:55] no ye not that to whom you yield
[1:51:58] yourselves servants to obey his servants
[1:52:01] you are to whom you obey how do I obey
[1:52:05] them how do I become a servant to sin
[1:52:07] yielding
[1:52:09] how do I become a servant to God
[1:52:11] yielding can you say man you yield that
[1:52:15] to whom you yield your servants to obey
[1:52:17] his servants you are to whom you obey
[1:52:19] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:52:21] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[1:52:24] think that you were the Sinners Servants
[1:52:26] of sin but you have obeyed from the
[1:52:28] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[1:52:30] delivered to you uh being then made free
[1:52:33] from sin you become the Servants of
[1:52:36] righteousness
[1:52:37] can you say Amen
[1:52:39] all do you love the Lord
[1:52:43] I believe if a man has received the Holy
[1:52:46] Ghost then
[1:52:48] he will make choices to serve the Lord
[1:52:51] according
[1:52:53] according to his word
[1:52:55] can you say Amen
[1:52:57] yes sir I I just believe that
[1:53:01] and and so
[1:53:04] you have people that that that that that
[1:53:05] that receive the holy or claim to have
[1:53:08] the Holy Ghost but totally reject What
[1:53:10] God Says in his word
[1:53:12] and and you can't I I believe that the
[1:53:15] choice that a man makes tells what he
[1:53:17] really has inside of him
[1:53:19] can you say man
[1:53:22] so we we look at these things and if the
[1:53:25] musicians will come
[1:53:29] the Bible says John 16 how be it when he
[1:53:32] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:53:33] lead and or he will guide you into all
[1:53:35] truth
[1:53:37] God doesn't feel someone with the Holy
[1:53:40] Ghost based on chance
[1:53:43] saying well I'm going to give this
[1:53:45] person my spirit and give him a try and
[1:53:48] see what he does
[1:53:51] he gives you the Holy Ghost because he
[1:53:54] foreknew what you would do
[1:53:56] hello
[1:53:58] Bram says before there was a world you
[1:54:01] were in God's thoughts to give you the
[1:54:02] Holy Ghost
[1:54:04] because he knew that you'd be wanting it
[1:54:06] and he chose you himself he said he
[1:54:08] chose you in Christ before you or Jesus
[1:54:10] any of you was on the earth and He sent
[1:54:13] Jesus to die to prepare the way to sin
[1:54:16] the Holy Ghost to you to bring you to
[1:54:19] himself
[1:54:23] the trouble today I find is that people
[1:54:25] don't guard their choices
[1:54:31] they don't take much stock in as to the
[1:54:34] choices they make
[1:54:37] they want to do it they do it they don't
[1:54:39] they don't
[1:54:41] and if we're not careful
[1:54:43] we can take predestination the wrong way
[1:54:48] you see predestination does not force
[1:54:50] people to be what they are and to do
[1:54:52] what they do
[1:54:54] again every man woman boy or girl has to
[1:54:58] make their choice
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:01] then you say Amen
[1:55:03] and your everyday choice
[1:55:06] to walk
[1:55:07] in the perfect will of God triumphs over
[1:55:12] the enemy
[1:55:14] it's a slap to the Devil's face in the
[1:55:17] devil's face
[1:55:20] as he says I got him I'll forever hold
[1:55:22] them
[1:55:24] but God calling you God wooing you
[1:55:28] God send in the gospel to preach to you
[1:55:30] and then you make that choice to him
[1:55:35] the devil realizes right then that he's
[1:55:36] lost his hold
[1:55:38] that God already foreknew it
[1:55:42] your choices don't surprise God
[1:55:44] already knew it can you see man
[1:55:50] do we fall and make mistakes yep
[1:55:53] but we don't mean to
[1:55:56] do we make bad choices yeah
[1:55:58] but we don't mean to
[1:56:01] and the prophet says you will do wrong
[1:56:03] but you don't do it willfully you're
[1:56:05] trapped in anything you're trapped into
[1:56:06] or do something that you don't mean to
[1:56:08] do it's not sin yet because you'll
[1:56:10] repent the minute you see that you're
[1:56:11] wrong
[1:56:12] you'll quickly turn
[1:56:14] say I didn't mean see that and you'll
[1:56:16] say that all through life
[1:56:18] a man don't want to be and that's the
[1:56:20] reason we're so stupid and so in dark
[1:56:22] down here on Earth but as there's a
[1:56:24] blood atonement for us to keep us
[1:56:25] covered all the time can you say man you
[1:56:29] love him
[1:56:31] oh the Lord is wonderful
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:41] and Jesus was his name
[1:56:48] born in
[1:56:50] a man
[1:56:53] Danger
[1:56:55] two years old a strange
[1:57:03] a man of sorrow
[1:57:11] can we go up a key
[1:57:12] [Music]

[1:58:26] that in the dead of night

[1:59:19] lightly we are not one that just turns
[1:59:21] and walks away
[1:59:24] he had an influence on her life
[1:59:27] [Music]
[1:59:28] these are all in all
[1:59:31] bless the name of the Lord
[1:59:34] the great
[1:59:37] Creator
[1:59:40] he became my savior
[1:59:47] and all
[1:59:51] all God's fullness
