Falling Away people are falling away from the message and and they've got their so-called uh ideologies and things and just to be honest in my opinion they were never convinced about it amen but it's good to be among Believers here that are convinced a man not because some man came but God himself supernaturally has Vindicated this message we have rested Our Hope on we've rested our faith upon and we know it's going to bring us through do you believe that amen I believe it's going to bring some young people through I believe it's going to bring adults through and it's bringing us preachers

the power of your majesty may you walk in this building tonight and begin to walk the aisles Lord I pray you break every Federal I pray the spirits of doubt and unbelief would have to turn loose tonight Lord healings and miracles would be released in this building father we lift you above every Power above every sickness above every disease and we believe you tonight oh God now we invite you as a congregation hands laid one on the other we're praying father that you would move Upon Us in a special way tonight we ask it in Jesus name amen and amen and God bless you tonight amen if you have your Bibles we would like to just go into the word of the Lord amen what a tremendous time to serve the Lord amen Hebrews the 11th chapter in the first verse Hebrews 11 and 1. all right Hebrews 11 and 1. Hebrews 11 and 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear as the Lord the bless his words you could be seated tonight I'm going to if I can tonight to speak to you on faith without fear faith without fear on the way down the Lord put some things on my heart and I told my wife I said I have a direction I just don't have the title I would like so I titled everything under the study faith and I thought I'll just name it faith until brother Wendell come in last night and said I'm just going to preach on faith and so I said we must be talking to the same inspir Inspire amen and so I just um just today the Lord added that to me faith without fear amen and that's exactly what I believe that as the Church of the Living God that we can experience I believe we can experience faith without fear amen now the scripture tells us amen of course that faith is a substance and brother Adam is very clear in teaching this that faith is a positive in other words he says it's a it's a positive it's a substance not imagination faith is not just a feeling or something that you would like to be but faith is actually a substance and it's positive amen as as something that God gives you now when I declare this brother Bradham from the message of super sense in 1959 he preaches it after super sign and in this he is describing the senses of the body and he says God gave you five senses to contact your Earthly home now he gave you of course your sight your taste your feel your smell your hair all of those are senses but we have to be honest most everyone has them unless something has caused a problem everyone has those senses and they're to the Natural man so everyone with a natural birth has natural senses and is to contract to contact the Earthly home now those five senses were given to you to contact but they were never given to you to guide you in this life because the senses of your body can be fooled amen they they your your ever sense that you have can be deceived in some sort of fashion so what we find out is the sea but brother Bram says but see but a Christian of course by a second birth was given an extra sense he goes beyond the five senses and he has added to him the sense of Faith which brother bam calls it a super sense and he says it's just as real as your taste feels smell in here I mean all the way back to Faith is the substance 1947 brother Adam actually has people come on the stage and and he stands in front of them and he says I see you you're here and then he'll put them behind him and he can't see him give him a mic and he'll make them say something and he'll say I can't see them but they're here here and he say anybody argue with me that they're not here see he was showing that one sense can make a declaration of something being there even when the other senses are not aware so you can all close your eyes right now take your hand send it over next to the person besides you you can still feel them and and you know sometimes even even that way when your eyes are closed you'll reach over to feel is somebody still there amen and you only have to have that one sense to declare something that you totally cannot see with your eye but that sense is positive and you would argue with someone that someone is there and you're only doing it from that one sense and that sense is a natural sense that can be deceived so how much greater is it then than the sense of Faith which God gave us that it alone can be the thing that declares something to be true when all of your other senses says it's not there but the face sense can declare something that is not in any other sense it'll make you believe something that you can't taste it you can't smell it you can't feel it you can't hear it but you certainly believe it and somebody says why do you believe it he said because I have a sense that tells me that it is real and is just as real as what I see here taste fill or smell so brother man said see then these five senses are given to you by God and they are to be used but when the five senses act contrary to the word then they are lying amen then they are lying he says anything contrary is alive so the sixth sense it cannot lie to you it is a super sense Amen in super sense brother man said the super sense is the Holy Spirit it is the faith that of God that dwells in you that's pretty powerful isn't it the faith of God that dwells in you in other words it's not your faith it's God's faith that dwells in you the same one that in the beginning said let there be a heavens and earth and there was nobody there to believe it except God and God believed his own word and saw it come to pass now that God with that faith has come into this dispensation and resides in the heart of Believers that are born of a new birth and by that alone can believe the word when everything else says it's not true but there's something on the inside of you that believes it anyhow because there's a face sense there that is making you aware of something you can't taste it feel it smell it hear it but sometimes you need to change channels you need to get out of the channel of your sense or out of the channel of your memory or out of the channel of your race reasoning and getting to a faith Channel where all things are possible because faith is the only hope that you have to get something that you can't get any other way faith is real it is a substance it is a sense it is positive and it literally dwells in the people if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the six it will guide you and bring you through all other senses it will guide you through all other senses for it so far above the natural sense the spiritual man is so far above the natural is so far as high as the heavens is above the natural man has five senses it makes you believe things you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think five senses would ever make you think about that and the devil can get into them five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense it's far beyond his reach it comes from God it's called Faith a natural man does not have that that's why natural people by a natural birth thinks you're a fanatic when you say things that you have received in faith because he only proof you have is that you have faith and they don't have that so they can't understand it but you understand it and you believe it and it seems ridiculous to everybody but you and the one that gave it to you which is God that sixth sense you see what it is it's a sixth sense what is it for brother Madam I love his brother said what is the sixth sense to do then what is it given to you for what is it to do he said this The Sixth Sense come for this The Sixth Sense come for this reason the Sixth Sense is Faith the super sense The Sixth Sense come for this reason only about the third time he says it he said this was to make your five senses in you deny anything that's contrary to the word of God in other words amen that's what the Sixth Sense is given to you for is to give you a power to deny your own senses that you were born see because originally Adam would have walked by the six sins Adam would have been LED amen by the faith sense he lived in another realm but when he clogged up the channels that God had gave him he fell from that Dimension and man is bound in a sixth sense bound existence in other words their existence is bound what they can see taste feel smelling here but when a man gets a new birth he changes into another sense of the six which lifts him into another realm where he can operate and be led and be guided by a complete different realm than others amen that's why amen the intellectual will never reach what I'm talking about that's the reason you cannot teach somebody into this that's the reason you'll never do it it takes Faith to get there hey man do you see sometimes we're trying to encourage people that has never had a new birth amen until you have the new birth you don't understand Faith so it's impossible to educate you to it but if you have something in you you can't believe it amen I I have to be honest sometimes people just need saving Jesus said without the new birth you cannot see the kingdom of God sometimes it ain't saving it's like a it's like a story told of an airplane pilot flying over the ocean and he he wrecks and bustes his head on his helicopter or his airplane he's out there in the ocean he's bleeding and the sharks are gathering around him amen somebody sees him drops a smoke bomb after a while Coast Guard he comes and picks him up now when the Coast Guard come to get him did the man need encouraging or did he need savings did he need a class on how to swim better amen he's in the water with the sharks what he needs is saving not encouraged and sometimes what people really need is an old-fashioned experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost where they can believe for the impossible where they can believe things that's beyond the realm amen because they need saving not encouraging but if a man ever gets saved then you can begin to encourage him by the message of the hour because then there is something to get a hold of faith will take a hold of the word of God faith will take a hold of the word of God now I know I'm not supposed to take off my jacket in a tent meeting but I'm gonna have to do it guys amen hallelujah do you love him tonight amen I think somebody come to have church the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you then it's not you believing that you have let God get in you and he believes his own word amen it'll make you deny anything contrary The Sixth Sense has come upon the human being to make him deny this is a totally different quote to make him deny anything that's contrary any symptom any symptom that's contrary to the promise the sixth sense says it's not there can you imagine amen a sane and sensible person denying completely that there is anything wrong with them when they're sick and everybody knows they are but there's something in them that will not acknowledge it [Applause] now you know you know uh people that have cancer if they call it the first stage of it is denial they'll say people have denial now that's the a natural man don't want to be sick so he tries to deny that it's really there but when William Branham teaches this and how can overcome he said no that's not what we're talking about he said what we're talking about is knowing the devil is real he said we know it's real we know it's a real cancer we know it's a real problem he said the difference is we know that somebody in US is greater than the one that's in the cancer so we're not safe in the cancer ain't Fair we're not saying the problems not fair we're saying greater is he that is in you and he that is in the well greater is he that's in you than that's in the cancer greater is he that's in you that's in the diabetes I'm talking about God getting in the People by a super sense and believing his own word about what he said I believe and I believe God out has gave something in this age and we are overcoming because we have recognized the devil and everything he's doing against the church and we're saying sure he's real sure he's there but I'm saying God is greater he's greater than every Affliction he's greater than him listen I don't think we could really exalt Jesus Christ as high as he deserves to be exalted for Jesus was exalted above everything that has a name of every sickness disease every Affliction and the Bible said we have been lifted up with him and all things have been placed under our feet lifted by faith lifted by faith into a realm you may think I'm crazy but in Romans 4 and 17 the Bible said it is written I have made thee the father of Nations before whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and called the things which not be as though they were now y'all know that's the scripture right in Romans amen how many times have you heard brother Branham say that was Abraham's confession Paul says it was God's confession that God called Abraham a father when he'd had no children and called things that were not as though they were but if you keep studying brother bam knows the Bible's written that way but he also calls it Abraham's confession because Abraham did not stagger at the promise of God through unbelief but rather confessed the same way his father confessed Abraham talk like his daddy and he said things that were not as though they were and things that were as they were not because he had a super sense he believed God when it was impossible he believed God when everything was against him amen his evidence was not in his body nor in Sarah's body his evidence was in that milk Hasidic that came to him and spoke to him and the Bible said Sarah received and believed the one who spoke was faithful to consider the promises of God what is it faith is the substance of things hoped for but it is an Evidence of Things Not Seen it's an Evidence now you literally have an Evidence to say things that you cannot see the prophet of God said in the Unseen he says it like this he said listen and a man's physical being to be taken care of is no reason at all God put him on the earth he does but what does he do with a physical being amounts very little it's what his soul is what counts it's the inward man that did not come from the earth it came from heaven and that's the Eternal part of a human being but yet strange he tries to figure out his own way to find it in the scriptures when a man chooses to walk in his own way and do what he wants God just lets him alone man must not think for himself but he met let the mind of Christ be in him and we are not to think for ourselves we are to call anything contrary to what he said as though it was not no matter what our eyes cling to be we do not live by what we see we live by what we believe then the prophet of God said we by no means are able to lead ourselves by this since-bound existence so that's why God give us Faith amen that it might declare that our senses was wrong and the word of God Is Right that we could live by it you know when Paul says it in First Corinthians 4 amen Paul actually says our light Affliction was but for a moment worketh for us and exceeding Eternal weight and Glory while we look not at things which are seen But at things which are not seen for things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal [Applause] the things you don't see are more real than the things you see [Applause] now nobody's going to think I'm crazy for declaring there's a tent here tonight nobody's going to think I'm crazy for declaring peoples in this building tonight because everybody by the sense of sight can confirm what I'm saying to be true if you don't have any sight you can hear what I'm saying to be true matter of fact my Apple watch said I was in a loud noise Zone I said Glory Apple's about to learn something about the house of God [Applause] do you see what it is then then the things which you will see are actually more real than the things amen the things you don't see is more real than the things you see and we don't even hesitate to declare things we see but the things we don't see are actually more real and we should have a stronger declaration of the Unseen than the scene we should be more ready to say what we don't see by our eyes than what we see by our eyes man I know y'all gonna think I'm crazy when it's over but I believe in radical faith I believe prophet of God said when you know where you're going you can have radical Faith amen you you think brother Wayne you're crazy saying and sensible is what we need go see what brother bam said about that get a hold of the word of God and you're sane and sensible in heaven you might not be on the earth because all of our family has convinced considered nuts for years amen our Church of the Living God has always been odd boss but the church has always been founded on the Unseen realms on the Unseen Realms now things that are actually in this building right now can we declare a little bit of the Unseen I know I got but how many Believers I got in here with me tonight how many believers they got in here with me tonight amen now the prophet said in John 14 and my father's house of many mansions Fellowship by Redemption 1955. he said a body is a dwelling place and for the scriptures verify the same thing now if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting mortal beings is only one who lives in Mortal habitations Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations and the place that we go until we return back is not a place of brick and mortar or clay or precious stones or Jewels it's a place or a condition that we move out of this Dimension that we go into he said into another dimension and it's a house a tabernacle a Dwelling Place Jesus said destroy the Tabernacle I'll Build It Up in three days they thought he was speaking to Solomon's Temple but he was speaking of his own body and he was going to prepare a place for every believer that the very moment we step out of this Mortal regions we don't have to go out into a myth or in some Supernatural Spirit but we go out into a tabernacle or a dwelling place that that it might be right here in the building this morning in a place where no radio activity or nothing else can touch it but God and God Alone now I cannot believe that there is a house way out yonder but I believe that the house God was speaking of is Right present here now you see what the prophet saying he said Heaven is not way out there on the cloud somewhere he said it's right here amen it's right here now your eyes cannot declare it but it's here just the same it's as real as the people are in this building to your natural eye there is a host that is in this building tonight that you cannot see with your natural eye the Saints of every ages have gathered up in this building with us tonight the angels of heaven have gathered up in this place with us tonight the prophet of God said they're present here with us right now he said I believe that's where Jesus is today the resurrected Lord Jesus is not younger somewhere A Million Miles Away he's right here present with us now Hallelujah you had a little while and the world seeth me no more it's the scripture low I'll be with you even in you until the end of the world and Heaven's not a million miles away it's right here in this building tonight the prophet said just in another dimension a dimension that radio can't touch a dimension television can't touch but a place your faith can contact [Applause] I tell you what brother bam said he said it's just moving a little faster he said coming right through this building now is televisions and pictures but it's too fast for our eyes now that's a radio on television so we don't even have to go to the spiritual to get to the Unseen amen how many ever seen the covet virus but it's real well most people believe it isn't it sorry if you don't believe that amen but but but germs are real right you don't have to say a germ they made you feel the sickness of it you'll you'll see a disease cross through and you never seen that happen because it dwells in an unseen whale but it's effective and Powerful in that Realm but it's motivated by demonic life y'all know that's right and it's in an Unseen World and the prophet says it just like that color is coming through here now nobody would argue that not in this not in this age when Paul preached it things that are real or in the Eternal can you imagine but not now most people sing the television most people have seen a radio and they've heard the sounds coming from another place the problem is we have a limited sight and television and radio has allowed us to dip into the Unseen by natural powers but they're there sure and it affects you come on you know what I'm talking about I remember when I was a kid people used to I remember as a little boy I remember the old pastor we was under I think every other service he preached against television it's going to send you to Hell one day I got studying the message I realized television didn't have the power to send me to hell but I did realize it had the power to take my victory because if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life there ain't enough televisions there ain't enough Devils there ain't enough hail there ain't enough drugs there ain't enough alcohol there is nothing there is nothing can change the seed that God anointed you with when you were born into this age somebody said I don't believe in that stuff well amen read the message once in a while [Applause] don't believe the power of new births was in you when you were born let me just say this to you to you about the first bar where'd you get that power the first lie you ever told what about the first drink he ever took what about the first thing you ever stole that power was in you from a perverted birth amen and you were born to a natural seed but there was another Birth by another seed it was a new birth of the gene seed of almighty God [Music] [Applause] somebody shout hallelujah there's seed in the field I studied out here a while back I got to see him people didn't like us praising God and shouting and rejoicing amen they didn't like it at all I got to study and brother man said the praise poured out the anointing he said it was just the rain on the crop and other people said well you know Devils can shout and and Devils can holler and I finally told him I said yeah that's true but have you ever read that there's more seed in the field than devils have you ever read hey matter of fact the devil maybe that's the only Pride or the only thing that people ever receive in this Dimension but God put his seed in this age that's why the rain's coming it's not coming for the for the Burr it's not coming for the cuckoo bird it's coming for the wheat seed that God planted so what you see cannot change your seed come on Church let's go I mean it's not what you see that changes your seed it's how it affects the seeds you already are and if you're amen if you was in that serpent seed you love that Hollywood you love that thing it'll just carry you all places you want to go you can go amen all kinds of places and in natural realm you can fold into Dimensions you right in your living room through the through the through the through the prospect of Television amen but what about the places that God can take his seed by the power of vision and the spirit of God and begins to drop in the sanctuary he can transport a person he can take them out of depression into the joys of the Lord he can take him out of nervousness to the power of praise and of Happiness I'm talking about a God that has the power of Transportation in his Spirit realm in a spirit world [Applause] televisions only a perversion of the Unseen whim that God unlocked in the 1940s 50s and 60s that's when television came in power in America but God had another Seer on the earth declaring the eternals to the Church of the Living God whew now that seed declares that he's in this building tonight there's a declaration the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God is standing here and the reason you can't see him is because our hearts have not become tuned down to it yet now the reason we can't see the television pictures with our natural eyes because our eyes can't tune to that channel to see it but it's there it's absolutely there now look at the prophet tell us in the Easter seal he said I stood there and I looked over the time I seen tens of thousands of thousands coming young men and women throwing down their arms and screaming and look back and I was laying there on the bed Lord let me look past the curtain of time what is it it's a quickening power that will catch us away the quickening power that came what was it that took brother random off of his bed into that sixth Dimension and his body never moved he said I would stand he was 20 feet from his body you go listen he was still in the bedroom with his body laid on the bed and was looking into a dimension with millions of believers screaming we wouldn't be here if you hadn't come well I'm identified there he was not a million miles from his bedroom he was seeing that right there because that realm is not a Million Miles Away it's right here do you see what it is amen it's it's an atmosphere now they're having problems with the Dew in the tent how many how many can witness that you thought it was rain it wouldn't rain these these heaters are propane and they're going up and they're they're causing humidity and the humidity is trapped above you and it's colder on the outside than it is the inside so the two Dimensions coming together on that skin creates an effect what you have is a tent skin and two dimensions are pressing together on it and water's coming out of it nobody put no water up there the rain ain't leaking through it's a brand new tent there's nothing wrong with a tent it's called condensation because of two Rams touching the same thing but we're on this side and it's on that side and it's the only thing that's between it is the veil of the flesh do you know what the prophet of God said he said he was praying he said Lord let your angels come in this building tonight he said let them lock their wings Above This Crowd and he said May the Dew drops of Mercy begin to drop on the Church of the Living God I tell you if you get wet off of this tent tonight somebody ought to shout and run the Isles to faint amen that you have been affected by the another atmosphere why setting under this tent I know somebody's going to leave here and think I'm a fanatic that's all right amen I might beep and leave me alone I'm happy like this we were sitting in my living room not too long ago brother Spencer was sitting there with us and brother Erickson three or four of the brothers Elders we were all sitting around the table amen and we began to talk about a visitation he had had with the presence of the Lord when he began to tell about it the power of God dropped there right right around my table and we were sitting there and the spirit of God began to deal with needs and and it was just a powerful moment in the Lord that God was just dealing with our hearts that was a presence fell over the entire living room somebody recorded it if you'd like to hear it someday maybe and they started singing the baby started getting quiet and brother Jonathan all of a sudden I realized that my hands were getting wet and I thought what is happening here my hands that was exposed that was a Mist like something like it was raining in the open right on my hand sitting in the middle of that I told the brothers I said I never in my life experienced something like this it's like literally I'm standing there and stuck my hand and it was raining somewhere but not at my table but I I could feel the Mist coming up on my hand do you see because there's other dimensions now I don't know if you if you can believe this far but I remember preaching in Africa not too long ago brother Eric mccocco sent an email to our church to testify of many people that saw it while we were preaching there in West Africa amen I was standing there and the power of God began to move and they said you begin to disappear behind the cloud why would they couldn't see me no more they were just hearing a man preaching out of a cloud now I didn't tell it all over the world because I figured probably somebody think I was crazy but just the other day in Windows 10 meetings out there in Oklahoma amen our young people begin to create such an atmosphere amen that while one of my brothers were preaching the cloud the glory cloud of God came down and began to feel the building listen it's not a million miles away as an atmosphere that's created by the word of God we are believers in a Superman natural god with Supernatural manifestations in the power of God I refuse to sit down and shut up when I can see it with my eyes I can see it by my faith my faith says it's there amen it's not a lie it's not a fanaticism it's not an embellishment it's the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in this age can you imagine looking right at something and everybody telling you you're crazy but you can see it you know it's real you know it's powerful you know how I feel but God rich and mercy has given us a vision to pierce to pierce this six since Ram into the power of God now this other dimension right here now today just imagine that his presence is here right now brother just imagine he's here in the form of the spirit and it's blending with our spirit and our eyes can't see him because they're yet physical unless something would happen that we could see the vision but here just as visible just as real as he was the day he spoke to Mary at the grave you've read Luke 24 and you wished you would have been there with Mary and you've talked about the two on the road to Emmaus and you wished you would have had that seat or that place to walk with him that day the prophet of God said he's just as real as when he met cleophus on the road his presence is here and it can be felt with that feel of the inner charge that's on the inside of the human body called the New Birth the soul has been magnetized unto him and once in a while when you let your mind be concentrated on him Believing on him after a while something a reality something that we can feel begins to sweep over us it's a Vindication of his resurrection when you just begin to get your mind on him that's why Satan's got all these Mind Games going that's why the politics and the and the intellectuals and all the situations in the world anything so you won't think on this anything so you won't dwell on this but if you begin to focus your mind on the resurrection of the Lord Jesus while you begin to Behold Him you begin to be changed you begin to be loose from the mannerisms and the ideas and the prospects of your tradition and your religion and all of a sudden a Superman is born into a natural realm no who he is knowing where he comes from understanding the things of God because it's just as real going on in this building right now now see here's the thing until this age we can only declare it by preaching the word but God let him invent a camera and the movie stars are using it but go home and study Google go go study uh it's not Google Chrome it's Kodachrome Kodak color photography do you all know when that come into existence when a prophet was on the Earth because God had recorded in the Bible what the bride looked like in the Supernatural realm while she was enthroning the power of God and they talked about it in the scripture you hear it described when Ezekiel says he was a wheel that was in the middle of the wheel now in Revelation chapter 4 part 2 I believe it is brother Brown breaks into Revelation chapter four and said behold that John said behold I was looking at the throne and it says and when I saw it it appeared unto Jasper and sword and stone and he said in a rainbow it was about the throne and brother man looked at that and he said now isn't that amazing that John saw that light and the color of it in emerald green like a burning fire of green blazing out of the center of that fire and when he sees that he said see John saw that he said now that was the bride's light that John was seeing if you want to study it he said go to Revelation 21 and the Bible said in that Temple amen that her light amen was the lamb her light was Jesus Christ and he picks up that word her light he said now what does her light look like he said let's go back to the Old Testament and see if it's not the same yesterday today and forever so he goes back in the Old Testament to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1 and verses 26 can you pull that up for me Ezekiel 1 26 and verses 27 it's a very powerful 27 28 it's a very powerful reading of the scripture we'll just read this portion you need to read the whole chapter but we're not going to read the whole chapter tonight pull it up and above the firm and it was over their heads was like a likeness of a throne and I'm gonna I'm going to express and explain to you what you look like in the Supernatural and above the firmament above that was over their heads was the likeness of the throne is the appearance of sapphire stone and likeness of the throne was the likeness of the appearance of a man above it now before you think I'm a crazy how many knows that God has three Thrones first one was in heaven second Christ and third one's where in the bride it's in the bride now watch what he says and the appearance of it was like a man and I saw as the color of an Amber amen and Amber and the Amber brother keeps going over Amber as the appearance of a fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upwards from the appearance of his loins even downward and I saw as it was the appearance of a fire and it had a brightness round about it Ezekiel was seeing what John was seeing and he's trying to explain what he's seeing this man covered in fire from his lines Upper from his lines downward he was saying it by Vision he was declaring it by Vision other people were scratching their head what's he talking about I've been saying nobody looks like that amen but all of a sudden in the age we're living in God sent a representative upon the Earth that represented the Bride of Jesus Christ now Shake somebody and tell them we don't believe brother Adam was Jesus but we certainly believe that Jesus sent him [Applause] he represents the bright part of the ministry of Jesus Christ which identifies all of you sitting here tonight now we see this happening and by Grace brother Jim somebody snapped a photo of brother Branham in California can you pull up the photo you can see brother by Adam standing here he's preaching five minutes before this another photo is taken don't show any of that fire I grew up with this on my wall as a kid my mom used to have it I never knew what it was never understood it one day I was studying Revelation chapter four and brother random begins to read the scripture of Ezekiel 1 he said there it is he said caught by Kodachrome in messiah in 1961 brother William said we got a picture of it the same way they saw it he said there it is that take the picture of it exactly like Ezekiel Saw it there is what Ezekiel Saw and you say preacher you're lifting up a man well wait a minute now amen you're not actually seeing God because God is Immortal and invisible and he's in his throne [Applause] The Man became the Throne of God and look at the glory that's around that man because God is in that man now for the last 50 years they've shouted their heels off about what God did through brother random but I think it's high time for the bride of Christ to recognize he was representing this entire Pride Church brother Ron what was around that Prophet is around every believer sitting in this building tonight amen you don't have to be an old person but God has thrown in the Bride of Jesus Christ and the glory of God and the power of God and the revelation of God is whipping back and forth through this building you feel the atmosphere of it your senses declare as something greater than just a preacher something greater than just a man amen but somebody is declaring by faith there's another dimension and your faith is saying that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth and anointing to anointing another dimension another Ram I don't have time to go into it but I'll do this for you amen right there's a rainbow around about him seven colors brother Ram said we're standing there he said what does it represent he said the first rainbow was to Noah and Noah's seen it in the sky how many remembers Noah's seen it in the sky in Genesis 9 he said you'll never understand why it's there unless you read Genesis 8. see you can see the rainbow but why is it there why is the rainbow there brother Ben said because in Genesis 8 Noah made an atonement he made a sacrifice and when God accepted the sacrifice the rainbow was the visible Covenant that is sacrifice had been accepted amen and you'll never understand that picture until you read the book of Matthew and you see that they took a supreme sacrifice and they sacrificed the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and our father accepted the blood of Jesus so the power of the blood shows up on the bride in the last day listen this Glory that you're caring is not free this Glory that's your experience and it's not free this is a blood Pride this Throne was bought by the blood of Jesus Christ Satan tried to give it to him he wouldn't take it [Applause] but he died for it because when they come to claim it he did not want the devil having any claim against you because you are his throne No Angel No Angel ever rested in the heart of the Bride this body was reserved for Jesus Christ by the spirit to come into the church with anointing and power amen I tell you what it is it's the power of God and it's come upon the church and to explain this you have to believe in the blood no no brother Brandon was not born of a virgin he was a sex-born man with problems and mistakes had children of his own put a cross on his mirror to keep his eyes from wandering on the lust of some woman he was a man the same as you're a man a passion like you a passion but the blood of Jesus Christ and so atone for the power and the sin had been erased until a man could stand there and the glory of God could come upon him he could speak a squirrel speak the storms away it was the blood somebody hollering the blood the blood did it that's what produced this is the blood now you know you know good and well we got more than one picture and I'm not going to show them all tonight I want to show one more can I show one more picture [Applause] so why are you showing pictures well you know with spiritual Amnesia you know with natural Amnesia they show pictures of home and they flash pictures of Mama and Daddy they patch pictures of the family until maybe they might recognize where they really come from well let's flash another picture and see if you recognize there's that great Pillar of Fire that was witnessing Sam Houston Coliseum that is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit form which is the Angel of the Covenant of the Lord I just came into this age it's not a Mystic friends it's not a psychology show it's not a figment of imagination it is the reality that's the same God that wrote this Bible is still alive and he's with his children in power and anointing Hallelujah that's Daniel 7 Revelations 10 1 and also Revelations 1. you can find it in the Bible I'm talking about Sam Houston Coliseum with a pillar of fire amen what is it we didn't take these pictures I wished I had an hour on pictures tonight we didn't take these pictures hey man did you take them did y'all take them in your family take them you know where they come from our critics and you know what I guarantee you they wished they would have stayed home because this is one preacher that will not be intimidated to quit showing the picture because you make me some fanatic I will not be shut up I will not be settled my faith declares that the saint Jesus that Paul man is a saint Jesus that's in this day and I pray somebody believe it will be tonight until every devil is broken until every Power is broken if thou cans believe all things are possible if you can get them to believe the story of the Angel not even cancer is going to stand in your way cancer has been defeated afflictions have been defeated Miracles are upon the church this is him all right I'll tell you what it is it's a charge of faith don't you water this down to emotion how dare you to look upon the glory of God and water it down to some emotional workup it's the power of God oh they're just Pentecostal there ain't a drum playing there ain't a guitar playing there ain't nobody singing But brother there's a music to the ear of the Bride of Jesus Christ there's a music going up right now that the Angels wished they could have saw it the Angels desired the hearing but blessed are your eyes and blessed are your ears not only are we solve it not only have we believed it we have been called to preach it without excuse [Applause] I know they hate it I like to show whatever service that is a picture of the same thing that led Moses through that wilderness that is the same thing that Paul met on the road to Damascus and said who are you Lord he said I am Jesus I have come from God and I have went back to God and brother bam said that same pillar for her promised to return in the last day and I'll tell you I salute the return of our Lord Jesus Christ in the form of the spirit of God I'll tell you what I feel like blowing up in 42 ways Hallelujah there's a power it's a reality [Applause] it's the angel of the Covenant is what Paul met it's called the pillar of Fire what is it amen amen you know you know brother Bram taught us that Elisha never brought the Angels when gehaza was scared you know brother Bram said God didn't create Angels out there he said when gehaza said what are we going to do Elisha what are we going to do how are we going to get this done unveiling of God brother Bam's unveiling of God brother bam said he didn't bring angels He just opened his eyes he didn't bring Angels he opened his eyes and when his eyes were opened the heels were full of the angels of God they were there the whole time he just opened his eyes come on on the road to Emmaus he walked in the room and the Bible said when he broke the bread their eyes were opened Jesus didn't come Jesus didn't appear he was already talking to him but when their eyes were opened the scriptures was alive in the midst of them because they could see laughs I know people think God's out of angels sorry the Bible said that Jesus could have called 12 Legions how many is Legion 72 000 is a legion and Jesus could have called 12 72 000 Legions of angels amen do you imagine if that was what was around the Son of God what did he put around his bride in Psalms 34 David said the angels of the Lord encamp about them that fear Him we're in the tent tonight but I guarantee you the angels of the Lord have encamped about this place it ain't just Camp Christian this is Camp Heaven the Throne of God is in the building tonight his throne is upon the air and the angels have gathered around them locking their wings demons are fleeing powers are leaving anointings are being broken classes are being took off [Music] hallelujah what is it about is the angels of God it's God Amen the angels of God are encamped about it brother Brandon with with sight was telling us that you are the reflection of the supernatural how many knows you're the pull of Bethesda did you know that in the Bible when the angel came on the pull of Bethesda it troubled the waters and people stepped in and were healed brother random said them Waters represented Humanity he said so when the angel steps into the waters he said you see normal people acting differently you see drunkards getting saved you see people giving their lives to Christ it's a troubling of the one what is it it's two anointings the natural world the supernatural world coming together upon skin but now you're typed as Waters and somebody said well I tell you what they stood down and waited for that water to be troubled for days you know what the prophet of God said I'm announcing to you the waters are troubled now [Applause] I'm announcing to you amen this day in your ears the waters are troubled now [Applause] those afflictions and troubles you've been struggling with this is the season for it now not in a million miles amen it's right here tonight what is it it's a sign that God's getting ready to do something [Applause] now I know y'all didn't come in here feeling just exactly like you're feeling right now what happened what happened come on you bumped into something [Applause] said preacher you always talking about atmosphere I tell you why because even the sickest man bumping the right atmosphere and he'll be healed the most troubled person you know can bump into the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and five minutes in his presence and be completely changed I think we ought to get an Atmos where every person can be sick that could be healed and you may think that I'm a little crazy so brother when you ask for too much do I really I tell you what we're under we're under an Elisha anointing how many knows that the prophet of God said in Elisha followed Elijah because he had already felt the power and he wasn't willing to turn around so he went all the way to the Jordan but once he crossed the Jordan Elijah turned and looked at him and said what are you hanging around for why do you keep following this Elijah Ministry what do you want from me and by the band said when Elisha looked at him he said I want a double portion of what you got swamped what he had I wanted a portion of it the Bible said you have asked a hard thing Elijah said you have asked a hard thing brother babe said well why don't you go ahead and ask if you're going to ask why don't you ask abundantly at your joy before why ask her halfway well I asked for just a little Victory why not ask for a holy ghost blessing that'll dance you out of that nervous problem and get you back into the power of God why not move into a realm where all things are possible why you want to stop halfway why do you want to let your pride pull you back from the base of the you're on the realm of the greatest thing you've ever experienced throw down your fear and believe God you've asked a hard thing you ask a hard thing well let me tell you this if I get to ask tonight I'm asking that every young person in this building filled with the Holy Ghost can that ever cancer case relief you miraculously healed I'm praying that every will get up and walk in every blind we'll see so by the way you asked too much Elijah said to him if you see me when I go you can have what you asked brother man said that Elisha never took his eyes off of him from that moment on and you know it matters what you're looking at and what you can believe for if you're looking at this world you're defeated but if you're looking at the promises of God your faith says it's possible your faith says it can happen let me ask you how long has the devil kept you beat out of your portion how long is the devil made you believe that you can't really live free you can go to church and you can enjoy church hood and you can have friends but you can't have Liberty well let me tell you that's a lying devil he was lying from the beginning and if you can have any God you can have all of God because you never earned it you never begged for it but by the blood of Jesus Christ he set the power back in the church to liberate these people you've asked a hard thing but go ahead and believe for it the prophet of God said he didn't ask for a person asked for a double of it now to you to study the Bible you know that's the law of the firstborn he wanted the inheritance you ain't got no children Elijah I want everything I want the whole thing you know brother bam said that was Jesus Christ from the church he said you can't have a double portion what brother Branham had Jesus said you could have a double what he had he said that's the cure for our age a double portion angels I know years ago I preached on angels I feel like doing it right now angels in the atmosphere you know if an angel is going to show up he don't just show up for nothing every time an angel showed up Supernatural things took place an angel never showed up just to prod you to do something natural and never Angels never showed up to push you to do something you could do without God but every time an angel come on the scene somebody did something that was superhuman have you ever wondered why the angels have filled the junction of time and right here when the dimensions are crossing Angels everywhere talked about everywhere TV's talking about it preachers are talking about it everybody's talking about it because the angels of God have come to prod this Pride into a rapturing faith don't you stop short of this message let the power of God take you in the Revival of the whole thing now you said well that was just for prophets brother Adam said prophets don't go to sleep they change dimensions while they're in the Pulpit they go into another dimension brother man said you might call it getting in the spirit he said and that's where a big part of my life is something inside of him would change he said but you need to enter that Realm can you imagine tonight that a prophet is inviting you to walk in the realm of another dimension he's saying that you need to go in there that you can move from one realm to another you said brother Wayne I can't do it you could if you'd look to the Unseen as long as you're looking at the natural there's a barrier of hair and somebody says well you're fanatical for praying that way you're fanatical for believing that way you're you're just oh man you think you're spiritual you believe in about dimensions and spirits and jumping and shouting but you you got all these things going on what's wrong with you as long as you're looking at all of that it is an impossible feat for you but if you look to the Unseen you can break every barrier of every sound every preacher's voice that ever said it's not possible every formal devil that's ever said you can't be you can't do it can't happen if you look to the Unseen by promise you can break out of those barriers and fly like the eagle and God made you to be come on Eagle it's your time to fly you wouldn't put here to sit on the roost tonight The Winds of Change have dropped down in this building tonight and the Breezers are blowing all the way from Glory breaking the latter rain and the thunderstorm of seven Thunders igniting the soul I believe is casting them in the realms foreign what an eagle tie fire you've climb the easier it is after a while the breaking of all those barriers the man becomes so surrendered he said preacher what are you talking about you all know that somebody gets under a demonic anointing and they get so surrendered they flop on the ground you've seen them you've seen them amen over the ended they walk up the walls walk across coals ten times the strength of a normal person amen you know why they do it because they're fully surrendering to a demonic form but if this if the elect of God if the called of God would lose their fear of the anointing of God and just begin to surrender themselves we're not going to surrender ourselves to the unknown it's to the Unseen I don't have enough time to go there but people today say that we're trying to get people come to alter and empty your mind and all that stuff and all that's what brother Brown was saying about them people back there we're not trying to get somebody to come to the unknown it's the Unseen we know him very well we know he's in this building we know he's here for every person and wants to come to him it's the Unseen it's not the unknown now there's a promise in this Bible that says you can have a perfect faith that will Master every circumstance I know they've told you that when you get in the Millennium you're going to get a kind of Faith but this promise is not for a millennial people this is for a people who lives in laodicea come on church this is a seven Church age and it's called laodicea but there is a faith that can move down in the heart of a believer that can pull him up into an eagle age where he is not a part of laodicea anymore it's there it's going on I can see it but I am not bound to it nor am I a part of it I have been called out unto the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] thank you amen what is it amen it matters amen it matters What Faith Can Do I could run a list of them tonight by faith rehab you can fill in the blank by faith Moses by faith Noah by faith Sarah by faith Abraham by faith Solomon by faith Samson by faith shame God that was before the cross that was before the blood but by faith the Bride of Jesus Christ will overcome ever a laodicean devil you want to talk about Heroes of Faith I'm looking at the greatest light that has ever struck the Earth since her husband was here now she is on the earth as the light of this age representing the another book of Acts well we might as well shout a while because that Devil's short crying [Applause] because I tell you what there ain't no give up in her there ain't no quitting her there's no fear in her there's no Reserve in her there's no regret in her there's no retreat in her she's on fire for God and she's going to stomp out every devil and gets in her way because she's the Bride of Jesus Christ she's anointed for the season and for the hour I won't shut up I won't sit down I won't quit I won't give my mock-up I tell you Satan I'm still here it's time to recognize your origin you as a son to begin with [Applause] God never created you fall and he created you a son now y'all y'all gonna have to believe something way more Supernatural than I believe to believe that you've changed species the prophet of God said it ain't so he said you're a new creature created in Christ Jesus back to the original right how many Christians we got in here tonight any of you ever fall sure you did amen somebody somebody's pretty limber give me a call come here young man I want you to stumble right there and fall right there just stumble down and fall won't you do it and I want you to get right back up is your name still the same are you still a human being he went down a human being he got up a human being his name was the same when he got up as he went down why do you let Satan make you think that because you stumbled or because you fell that he had the power to change who you are I'm still who I am I still believe what I believe I still have the power amen of Christ Rising on the inside of me it's not a change of species we are the sons and daughters of God not what we're going to be brother Jim What We Are Tonight Satan you got your hands full not in 10 years not in five years not tomorrow but right now in this building there are children of God who are anointed to destroy the works we don't need miracles in the Millennium we need them now and that's why God puts you here to break the barriers of unbelief [Applause] so by the way what we need I'll tell you what we need we need some preachers and teachers that'll call it present tense can somebody please tell them that we don't have to wait for another day [Applause] tell somebody next to you not tomorrow tonight we don't have to put this off to another day we are right now sons of God right here in this building tonight we are here and Satan we are on your hands oh yeah well next week just wait till next week I tell you I know you come here real sick but you just wait till next next year you're going to get your miracle next next year I'll tell you what you do amen next week when you get home you're going to get your Miracle then amen We Believe Miracles sure you'll get them next weekend I'll tell you what there's come in a great Revival it's coming in this future age things are going to be rising up things are going to start happening amen that is the voice of the devil [Applause] at the best it's the voice of Hope and brother bam said hope you need it he said but it's the greatest enemy faith has he said because hope will tell you it's right hope will tell you it can happen he said but hope puts it off for another day he said that when Faith Rises up faith says it's all ready done faith is not looking for tomorrow faith says it's done it's already done it's not gonna happen it's not going to take place it's not God can do it it's God has done it and it's right now and it's in this place we are more than conquerors in Christ amen we are more than able to take this land not tomorrow not the next day but tonight we are the sons and daughters of God and the Holy Ghost will take the promises and call them present tense he's not the I was he's not the I will be he said I am but I am Moses tell him the I am sent you I'm telling you the I am sent me to this tilt tonight to tell you I'm not I was I'm not I will be I am and I am and in here tonight for every situation somebody shot Hallelujah Brotherman said in the True Divine gift of God will recognize the cross and call it a finished work any Divine gift of God if you are hearing from a Divine gift of God it will say the cross finished it it don't need payment it has been paid for somebody shout paid for this tent is not getting paid for it's paid for thank God for some brothers thank God for some churches that got together amen and and pulled together to pay for the tent it's paid for amen it's not coming we're not going to have church in it next year it's not on its way and wait till we get that new tin it'll fit more people and this is going to happen and this is going to happen the 10 is here the 10 is paid for it the tent was a vision somebody ordered it but tonight we are shouting under that tent that has been prepared for you ah come on Church of the Living God we had a prophet with a tent vision and it's been paid for and you are the tent of the Bride of Jesus Christ [Applause] now y'all know y'all y'all heard about atmosphere with Moses and the and the Aaron's rod and you've heard about all the atmosphere right y'all know Moses built that place it was just a field to Moses built it but then it became a place of a meeting place with a pillar of fire came over the word and they identified themselves with God and let me tell you what this is happening what's going on in this building tonight is that same light that ordained that first hint and in the middle of the Bible brought another tent and God has brought a tilt in this age and he said I will meet you now what are we talking about we're talking about taking the word and nothing else come on now don't leave me on faith I'm talking about faith based on word and nothing else he said he's here he's here I'm sick he's here I feel bad he's here I can't see it he's here amen he said I'll be with you even in you he's here he's more real than the things that I can see is real he is here amen and when the people begin to recognize his presence and they take his word and they begin to put the word of God before God as an ignition and a power that begins to happen do you know brother bam said that's the way Miracles are performed do y'all know Miracles is a gift in the Bible and it's not in another age it's in this one do you know the gods you're serving is a Jehovah of Miracles he's not just a Divine healer he's a miracle working God you said preacher I need a miracle how do I work a miracle you don't have to be special you don't have to be a preacher you can work a miracle just like Mary worked a miracle that's what brother Branham said he said how did she do it he said she took the word and begin to thank God before she felt the first thing now though some guys took that and made it the baptism of the Holy Ghost sorry Mary went to the upper room just a few days later and got drunk on the spirit amen now you see you take that word and you said what are you talking about tonight maybe you're sitting here tonight and you want the Holy Ghost and you don't really feel the holy you don't feel that but you know it's true don't you know it's true in Acts 2 it said repent and be baptized how many is repented have been baptized it says in you shall somebody call her shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so couldn't God lie no sir God can't lie then the word has given me permission to testify that every one of you that had been water baptized and repented in the name of the Lord I can say you have received the Holy Ghost and if you keep saying it you will work a miracle in your life demons will die unbelief will disappear and it the spirit of God will take every promise and call it present true brother Ben said it like this maybe you come up in a prayer line he said you come up in that prayer line he said you've got something going on with you he said and you get prayer he said you're hurting Justice bad as you were he said but when you begin to pray for that person you're hurting just as bad as you were he said but when you begin to leave he said no the pains are still racking your body you know there has been a victory by your faith so you got a right to leave the prayer line and tell everybody you know you're healed by the way but I'm still feel bad such senses feelings are not what declares the word of God we declare our faith when everything else is lie in faith will give us such truth brother I'm sick to his belly couldn't keep his beans down they said brother ma'am you're doing okay he said I pushed it down said I'm doing just fine they said brother Wayne ain't you lying he said no I'm confessing [Music] line of confession amen don't you know what that means to confess don't you know what it means to ignore the devil and everything he wants to you and just say it anyhow just lose your fear of whether God can do it or not and just say it anyhow let me just say something real quick that devil of fear is an absolute Tormentor and let me say something to you young ladies God never sent the spirit of fear God didn't send it I want you to tell somebody God didn't send it God did not give you that fear God didn't give it to you I can show it in the Bible that God never gave the spirit of fear God never gave the spirit of fear matter of fact it only come in the Garden of Eden after man fall and when they failed brother Brown said the greatest curse had ever struck Humanity Was Fear but fear is going to come because fear is trying to back you off of the promises of God but Paul said we have not received the spirit of fear again to go into bondage but we have received the spirit of adoption we're why we cry Abby father and like and lack that ones of hold Amen Let us cry with them we are more than able to take this land and there's no Giants and there's no weapons and have been formed against us that can stop us if it's Jericho we're going to March the walls down because that's how Miracles are performed we believe God before we see anything the shulamite woman the will of their path believed Elijah and was fed from her beliefs brother babe said Joshua walk down the walls and shouted while the walls were yet standing you say preacher what are you doing I'm giving you permission to shout [Applause] let me just tell you something you don't have to work up this bride just give her some room just tell her it's okay that's been too many Devils it's tried to step on the prosperity and the power of the blessing of the Holy Ghost in the church I think it's time for somebody to Fan the Flames of praise and worship again and remember that not even the angels can worship the way this bride can worship I told these preachers standing there tonight I said I guarantee you there are people in that tent tonight that came just so they could dance I guarantee you there are people that's in this building tonight that came all the way from their home just so they could dance in the power of God and be with a bunch of people that believed in the spirit I hear you since Janet it's a long drive but you won't be disappointed because you come to a place where you can play your tambourines You Can Dance you can chat you can Rejoice you can enjoy God because the blessings of Abraham have come by the blood of Jesus Christ yes we believe in it yes we make room for it I wish brother Bobby was here tonight from up there amen at brother Roy Shrewsbury is one night I was dancing in the spirit on brother Roy's platform and Bobby got up behind me and I was dancing he got the dancing song leader you know up in age and all of a sudden he started screaming y'all know brother Bobby he started screaming throwing his knee like this running all over the building he said brother Wayne that knee has been tore up for years he said but while you were dancing he said I just want to dance too and he started hobbling on that knee amen but after a little dancing all of a sudden that Miracle work in God began to take the pain out of the knee I think if you got any problems tonight it's time to remember how to dance amen it's time to remember how to worship God Amen you got nervous problems it's time to remember out of worship God if you're depressed tonight it's time to remember how to worship God I don't think we need to pass out the nerve pills I think we need to pass out praise and let the Holy Ghost come back in the church I know that fear I know what it's doing it's Mountain upon the people making them nervous and scared to worship her praise or enjoy God I Stay Away With Fear tonight God didn't send it but he did send us [Music] for in my name they shall cast out Devils

people left in this age I told that testimony about Anna and brother Nathan standing right here needed a miracle in his body to have another child and he come through a prayer line at brother Nathan's Bryant's and God gave him a miracle and we got little Rosie here tonight she just turned a year old and you said preacher why are you telling that let me tell you the reason I was at Cloverdale two years ago on August and I was preaching their meeting and I gave the testimony of Anna and of this baby and of sister Stephanie and brother Bryce and when I started telling that testimony there's some liquor brother Ryan was sitting there playing had just come through his fourth miscarriage and they literally just drugged into camp and while he was sitting there deciding that there was no hope there was nothing that could ever be when I told the testimony the voice of God spoke to him said you'll have a son and you'll call his name Samuel do you know what he did he put the tape in front of the whole world and he showed the video of me testifying and the video of the baby that he was holding because testimonies caused testimonies cause testimonies cause testimonies if you want to see a miracle working God get to Worship in a miracle working God you want to see a miracle tell somebody God does Miracles he still changes lives he still heals the sick he still raises the Dead you're not gonna sell me on a dead tradition when there's the Living God in our midst [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so I've never seen a miracle where's Ann Martin at right now and Martin's here somewhere amen sister Ann right there you see how nice she's standing up hey remember when she was just a baby I was on the phone with the Shriners a buddy of mine was amazing I called him because that child had a hip that wouldn't stay in joint and brother Sean didn't have the funds for the surgeries that was needed and him and I just took our first trip to New Mexico and while we were on our way to New Mexico they called us and they said I think brother martin prayed for her and said something miraculous has happened the baby's hip popped back in place and it's completely healed a miracle every time she walks in the door a miracle walked in the door we have forgotten what God can do if a man will just believe God faith without fear faith without fear of rejection without fear of failure without fear of the devil God will do what he said he will do New Mexico's right there wave your hand amen the first trip brother Sean and I made together your sister your aunt Rachel fell down and broke her ankle and you're I mean she she may get on to me but her husband ain't ashamed of being a Catholic but she got to got him to pray for her we pray for her in the room and they took her to the doctor and when they took her she was praying Goblin heal her because she was in trouble for coming to a fellowship and her husband was Catholic and he was mad at her because she went and he was really mad at her because she broke her ankle and they took the pictures on a Friday I believe it was what we prayed for and before they walked out of the door brother Manuel turned and looked at her son and said it's going to be okay well the son called from the hospital with the x-rays he said Uncle Manuel I thought you said it was going to be okay Mama's legs broke he said honey I'm telling you God said it'll be okay it's going to be okay on Monday the Doctor Who seen her in the LR said look I can't fix this leg it's too bad you come back Monday and see The Specialist and he'll probably have to put a plate or do some surgery and on Monday morning they took her back to the specialist amen and when they done the cert when they done the the scans on it they come back and said we don't need to do any surgery the husband got mad and he said what do you mean making me come all the way down here and you ain't even gonna perform and then the doctor said wait wait wait wait wait don't you get mad at her her leg was broke I got the pictures but it ain't broke no more because she knows a miracle working God is in this building tonight let our musicians come tonight I believe it's time to remember the god that we serve let our faith go without fear lose the fear of proclaiming a miracle working God if he can't work no higher than your testimony don't keep him bound I said brother Wayne what can God do I'll tell you what he can do he can do anything but Mary when Mary said she was going to have a baby without a without a man the angel said all things are possible with God you know what that means it means no word ever left God's mouth without the power to fulfill it that no word God ever spoke has the power that's left his mouth that cannot be fulfilled because he had the power when he did it you say preacher them things happen well they happened over there and they happened over here well there's brother Roberson sitting right there I'm looking at him that was healed last year in this prayer line miraculously or he wouldn't be standing here tonight and he ate he ain't just barely here he's been standing as long as you young men have been standing and they wasn't supposed to be here that need that as a blood disease right and it was supposed to take his but God Rich had mercy said well that's just one without just another one standing right there sister Tara I tell her amen wave your hand like this amen she was in these meetings sitting in a in a chair in her back tore all up I don't remember what service it was amen but all of a sudden Jesus came by I don't think she's missed one since because it can happen in this building tonight [Music] the miracle work in God [Music] Miracle work in God [Music] you know [Music] it ain't been too many it ain't been too long ago my daughter Bethany was going through a real severe depression [Music] it was severe enough that we had to we had to do we had to do something [Music] it wasn't just something you could say just forget it was there was something needed the doctor told me he said well what you need to do is Adopt A friend of mine he said you need to admit it to the ER and let them take her through a mental ward Port things out brother Donnie Reagan a good friend of mine I found him I said brother Reagan Bethany's going through a little struggle here and the doctor says telling me I need to do he said brother Wayne if they had the answers he said I would advise you to take her there he said but you know they don't have the answers you need [Music] I turned around and looked at Bethany I said Bethany you tell your dad where you want to go what you want to do that Devil's not staying here no longer and she said Daddy would you take me down to see brother Ron I said yes I will and we loaded her up and we drove down there to Virginia and brother Ron took time from his schedule and made time to see me we were in the hotel room the night before we were listening to brother Ronnie long preach a sermon at my church back in Ohio unknown to me he had been fasting and praying for about three days for Bethany because he knew the seriousness of the issue we were listening to the sermon in our hotel room on a Thursday night and while he was preaching he got to tell him the story of how Ahab went to the Isaiah how he went to the temple and prayed and that he was encompassed by a great company and that God told him that battle wasn't his it was the Lord's that he need to prepare and when he was saying those words the power of God dropped in that hotel room I've never told this ever to anybody I fell on my face in the middle of that hotel room and for I don't know how long I laid an intercessory prayer in another language in another dimension the next morning we got up and brother Ron met us and when we started talking he can tell you the anointing came back on me and I just went over and laid out in his floor an intercessory prayer for over an hour I was communicating with God in another language people don't believe in speaking tongues I do if you don't if you don't throw your Bible away but while we were in that place God gave brother Ron the words and he spoke those words and I went home with a different girl that demon was completely broken from that child [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I've never shared that publicly ever but I'm sharing it tonight because I believe there's some young people that need to know that that Spirit of depression is a demon and it'll take your life if you let it but there's men of God on this Earth that don't just take you to a psychologist it's okay if that's the only place you got to go but there's a God there's a real God that you can meet tonight [Music] and tonight I have a lovely daughter and a son-in-law and gonna have me another grandbaby my daughter Mariah was eat up with a with a spirit that the devil hates me he attacked my babies my daughter Mariah was suffering with an anxiety I preached a sermon called casting out fear and while I was preaching it brother Tim the spirit left her immediately it's a preacher why are you telling these things because I'm telling you Daddy it's your house and you don't have to lay down to that devil [Music] you don't have to just lay down and say hey man there ain't nothing we can do yes there's something you can do there is a God among this bride there's a power in a reality that can change things changes has already taken place in this building this girl's standing right here right now that has been delivered while we were preaching this word now why is sweeping over the room right now how many would say brother Wayne I want it right now that's just about our hearts tomorrow night we're going to have a prayer line right now I want you to put your hand on somebody the other hand I want you to put your hand on that person that's standing beside you and I want you to pray almighty God father as we lay our hands one on the other Lord your word has come and taken us into Realms God that the devil cannot hold us powers of Hell cannot destroy us but Lord Jesus you have given your word and we believe it without fear without failure father we are standing here tonight based upon the very promises that you have made in this age there are young people in this building tonight that have been bound with depression but father tonight I pray that the curse be reversed
