Affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall my soul hath him still in remembrance and is humbled in me but this I recall to my mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not now that's a very powerful word compassion because compassion is not human sympathy it's the Divine will of God so we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion saith my soul and therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him amen let's just bow our hearts together tonight how many have a special need upon your heart something you would desire from the Lord amen I believe he's here tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Wednesday afternoon father I know they've pressed over many things throughout the day throughout the week to be here tonight and Lord I am a firm believer that Lord you do not gather your children together Lord without having something for them Lord that's the blessing of following this revealed end time word is that whenever Believers come together underneath the opes of that word it is a Divine invitation for you to come among your church and to speak to the needs of your people and tonight Lord I'm inviting you may you come and be the speaker here tonight father you see these things I have on my heart but Lord without your anointing and quickening power it'll just be a few thoughts but Lord if you'll come by and pick it up then you'll be able to place it in the heart of these people and Lord I know every devil is already defeated Lord every sickness is already healed Lord every bondage is already delivered every empty vessel already is filled by the promise of your word now help us tonight God lord to look at the promise and to accept the promise and Lord whatever you have have on your your heart for this meeting we'll be sure to get out of th way and have your way Among Us Lord bless this assembly God have your way tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's name and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this evening as you have your seats I I want you tonight by the help of the Lord for just a few moments here I want to speak to you on his mercies amen are new Every Morning amen his mercies are new every morning I wonder how many could witness tonight that his mercies amen are new every morning you know I think of the two attributes of the Lord Jesus Christ and I just have to say this I am I am very thankful amen for these two attributes and that is the mercy and Grace amen I believe tonight that our God Amen is rich in Mercy I believe he's rich in Mercy and I believe that he is wonderful in Grace am then he is rich in Mercy and he is wonderful in Grace now as we look at these two attributes of God amen amen we could never cover the depths amen of the mercy and the grace of God Amen that God has so generously given Amen to satisfy our hearts now brother B says something very powerful he says I have nothing amen that I could offer God I'm just asking amen for divine mercy and Grace amen I have nothing that I could offer God but I'm asking for divine mercy and Grace another place he said we come amen confessing our wrongs all of our evil doings and thinkings amen and asking for divine mercy and Grace see we unmar anything father we have no merit that we could offer amen but we come in his Merit so here amen we have no merit of our own amen but he has given us his marriage amen that we might come that he freely gave us and told us in the gospel amen that if we would ask we would receive amen if we would seek we would find if it if we would knock amen it's shall be open I tell you tonight amen that is a beautiful promise that if we will ask we shall receive amen amen if we'll knock it shall be opened amen amen if we will seek for it we shall find it so here amen we're not doing these things in in vain amen but we're doing them under a provision of God Amen that when we ask we're going to receive and when we knock it's going to be open and when we seek we're going to find amen because God Amen is rich in Mercy amen God is rich in Mercy I don't know brother Judah if you could EQ this or something it's a little muffled in my ear amen amen but tonight I believe that God Amen is rich in Mercy now in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse one amen Paul says you hath he quickened amen who were dead in trespasses in sin we in time past ye walked according that's good to the course of this world Amen according to the prince of the power of the air amen the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience he said among whom also we all had our conversations in time past Amen in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind I want you to watch this and we're by Nature amen the children of Wrath even as others so amen we were by Nature the children of Wrath amen but we were not by seed the children of Wrath amen now watch what he goes on to say but God Amen who is rich in Mercy amen for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin amen has quickened us together with Christ amen and by Grace ye are saved amen can I say this tonight that Mercy amen and grace are in direct connection amen amen you cannot have the grace of God Amen without having the mercy of God and you cannot have the mercy of God without having the grace of God Amen because God is rich in Mercy that word mercy is kindness or Good Will towards the miserable amen and the Afflicted amen it is joined amen with a desire to help them amen I love how the Greek breaks this word mercy down it speaks of mercy of men towards men so that means to exercise the virtue of Mercy Amen to show oneself merciful amen the mercy of God towards men Amen in the general Providence the mercy in of God in providing amen and offering to men salvation by Christ amen then he speaks of the mercy of Christ whereby at his return Amen to judgment he will bless the true Christians amen with eternal life amen now let me just go ahead and say this thank God Amen that we're following a prophet amen who has made a distinction between the church and the bride amen and said listen you're not the church amen that's waiting to receive eternal life amen but you are the bride who already has amen you already have eternal life and John 5:24 says it very beauti he said we have passed amen from Death unto life let me say this tonight amen no matter what you're going through you already already have eternal life amen I don't know what tomorrow holds but I know what I have amen I have eternal life amen I don't know when the Rapture is going to happen but I have this confirmation Amen in the depths of my soul tonight amen that I have passed from Death unto life and the prophet of God said you once in times past was dead amen you were dead even many here tonight one time amen you can look back and know that you were dead amen but now aren't you dead tonight amen as you were then amen you deserve to be that way because you was a sinner amen but God who is rich in Mercy amen all these things that we were amen but God can I say this amen we were dead but God we was on our way to hell but God Amen we was headed to a sinner's grave and a devil's hell but God Amen who is rich in Mercy amen made a pass by our way amen and Quicken de seed on the inside of our soul listen I'm so glad that he is rich in Mercy if he was just rich in money if he was just rich in materials which he is amen but yet the greatest thing being rich in Mercy what a great word that is how that we were once dead amen sister Jane we once were dead amen but praise God tonight we're not dead amen we we Bound by our sin nature amen but praise God tonight we're not bound amen one day we couldn't worship God Amen but tonight because there's a mercy seed and there's an atonement of blood upon that Mercy seed amen there's a right in the house of God Amen for every believer to worship God in the power of his resurrection in the mercy and Grace that he's bestowed hey I don't know about you I don't desire the Judgment of God Amen I desire his Mercy right say most gracious Holy Father as we approach thy Divine throne of grace amen we're standing in the shadows of thy Justice we would ask Lord that by your grace amen that you would forgive us of our sins and trespasses amen we desire Mercy amen can I see a show of hands how many can say Lord amen I'm Desiring Mercy amen do not judge us according to our lives and our works amen do not give us Justice amen but give us Mercy let me say this God promised amen he would give us the desires of his of our heart amen then if our heart's desire amen is to be a beneficiary of his Mercy then he has provided a way for us to receive amen a benefit of that Mercy amen I'll say this tonight God is rich in Mercy I probably say that a lot tonight amen but brother Tim God is rich in Mercy amen can I say this his mercies are unlimited amen he is rich in Mercy and he is loyal to his promise if God promised to heal you if you have faith tonight it's either right or wrong it's right or wrong if he promised to save you no matter if you are a bootlegger if you are a dope fiend if you're whatever you are amen if you're a prostitute whatever it is amen Jesus Christ will stoop down and he will receive you hey that ought to make you take your sad shoes off and put on your joy shoes in the house of God Amen it don't matter what condition you're in amen there's a God who is rich in Mercy he'll reach down to a prostitute he'll reach down to a dope fiend I say if he'll reach down to a drunkard he'll reach down to a discouraged church member he'll reach down to a broken situation hey because he's God and his mercies are new ever morning and he's not limited to the condition he's not limited to the situation hey you remember the Affliction and you remembered All the Troubles amen but I come by tonight to tell you remember his Mercy because he rich and mercy and his mercies are unlimited if you come to him he will in no wise cast you out you believe that do you believe tonight if you take your burdens to the Lord he will in no wise cast you out if you take your problems to the Lord he will in no wise humiliate you amen but he will extend a hand of Mercy to you because he's the God who is rich in Mercy well I tell you I've been trying to contain this for a couple days amen I believe his mercies are unlim ited amen can I say that again his mercies are unlimited and I believe that tonight his mercies to you is unlimited his mercies is unlimited to the drunkard it's unlimited to the dope fiend it's unlimited to The Prostitute amen but don't leave it out there church a prophet of God said the same Mercy that can minister to them is the same Mercy that can minister to you I'll say this brother brandom said my Ministry amen is to declare him amen that he which is Christ is here can I say this if he is here amen then his mercies are here if he is here amen his grace is here if he is here his power is here brother said just imagine what Jesus is doing right now amen the holy spirit is ruing over you amen his mercies and power amen is coming into your body right now amen making you well the angels of God Amen are hovering around you you listen friends I don't know what you're going through tonight amen but that ought to make you shout aloud in the house of God Amen that God who is rich in Mercy has dispatched Angels into this building and they're hovering over you right now and they're wanting to send Mercy into your life they're want to bring healing into your body listen I am a strong believer we don't have to leave here like we came amen there's a God in Israel and there's an angel in this building who has come down to minister to The Heirs of Salvation and he's here tonight amen let his Mercy come into your heart let his Mercy come into your home let his Mercy come into your family he is rich in Mercy and his mercies are unlimited hey the mercy of God Amen is more than just human sympathy it is divine compassion from God I love searching the scriptures amen because when you read through the Bible amen you will find out what Mercy is what Mercy does and what Mercy has the power to do you will find what Mercy is what Mercy does and what Mercy has the power to do in Psalms 103:1 17 we find that Mercy is eternal and it's boundless amen the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children amen sister an I'm sorry I didn't get you the scriptures Amen in Joel chap 2:2 you will find that the mercy of God Amen encourages repentance he said there fore also now sayith the Lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning now watch verse 13 and ren your heart amen and notot your garments and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful he is slow to anger and of great kindness and he repenteth him of the evil amen here Joel is saying amen that God is not waiting on you to get everything right before he extends Mercy amen he said don't worry about rending your garments amen just Rend your heart and if you can get your heart fixed oh come on now amen people get worried about makeup and short hair and what they got to wear and what they can't wear amen but if you just get your heart right amen if you just Rin your heart Amen to the unlimited mercies of God Amen he will change your hair he will change your clothes he will change your music he will change your entertainment I'm talking about a God who is rich in Mercy and if he's rich in enough to change our clothes and he's Rich enough to change what we wear and change the places we go hey then some morning between 6:00 and 9 he's going to be rich enough Amen to change an old man back to a young man again he's going to be rich enough to raise those that have been in the grave for years and bring them out of the grave in an immortal body hey I'm talking about God who is rich in Mercy who is Mercy is here in the power of administration amen the mercy of God forgives sin I like that one brother shiah the mercy of God forgives sin in Micah 7:8 he says who is a god like unto thee amen that parth iniquity and passees by the transgression of the remnant of his Heritage he retaineth not his anger forever amen because he delighteth in Mercy in other words he's a God that does bring correction but he does not hang the correction over you for the rest of your life come on God will correct you because he's not a do to old grandpa but he won't be 20 years later amen still telling you about how he had to correct you amen 20 years ago amen his mercy endureth forever amen he delighteth in Mercy now watch he will turn again and he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea then now will perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham which thou has sworn amen unto our fathers from the days of old in Titus Chapter 3 and verse three we find that Mercy amen is what makes salvation possible the Bible says for we ourselves also amen were sometimes foolish how many how many can agree there we were sometimes disobedient we've all been there he said deceived amen serving divers lust and Pleasures amen living in Malice and envy and hateful and hating one another but after the kindness and the love of God our savior toward man appeared amen not by the works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he has saved us by the washing of the Regeneration amen and the renewing of the Holy Ghost you know what that word renewing means amen it is a renovation it is a complete change for the better what are you saying preacher I'm saying when the mercy of God walks in amen it'll renovate a home it'll renovate a church it'll renovate a family it'll renovate a Ministry I say oh God come down tonight in your unlimited mercies and perform a renovation on every heart on every young person on every family every home we need a change church we don't need a new home we don't need a new car we need a body change and the only thing that can provide that is the god who is rich in Mercy who is slow to anger and retaineth not wrath now watch what he said he shed on us abundantly amen through Jesus Christ Our Savior that being justified by his grace we should be made Hees hallelujah hallelujah we brother Terry we've been made hes amen according to the hope of eternal life listen tonight if you're waiting on eternal life we can't have church tonight if you're waiting on eternal life I can't preach the promises to you but if you have already received the eternal life of Jesus Christ then right here on a Wednesday night amen you can shout on the devil's head you can Rejoice over the problem because the grace of God and the mercy of God has made you subject Amen to the hope of eternal life amen through Jesus Christ Hallelujah God made promises to each age and he promised that in each age something would happen then he then the very way that he said it would happen is the exact way it will come to pass I love what brother B says and when their eyes were open they knew him 64 he said and as we see the prophecies fulfilled today that the Church of how we become rich in the things of the world and think we have need of nothing and he said we were we were naked blind miserable and didn't know it but father we ask for Grace then that you open our eyes to the understanding of Thy word that we might understand the hour We're living that we might prepare ourselves for his appearing as we truly believe it's at hand can I say this every age God promised a message every message God sends to an age comes with two elements you know what those elements are amen the first one is Mercy and the second one is Judgment now let me say this to reject the message is to accept the Judgment amen but to accept the message amen is to reject the Judgment in other words if you can accept the mercy of God you are you are bypassing the Judgment of God if you if you bypass the mercy Mery of God you are accepting the Judgment of God y'all remember blam tells that story about the man that went out and found gold and he said he he had a whole slew of gold and the next morning he was going to go cash it in he said he was making all kinds of plans for what he was going to do amen amen with all that money brother Kevin he was getting from that gold you know he said but then about about 2:00 in the morning he said his old dog out there amen got to bark and and he said he went out there and he said what's the matter with you shut up he said I'm trying to sleep he said tomorrow I'm going to cash in the gold he said I'm going to retire pretty you know brother B said about about 30 minutes later he started barking again he said he went out there and took his shotgun and he shot the dog he said when he shot the dog he said what he done was he silenced the voice of of warning of Mercy that was announcing amen that judgment is at hand now can I preach here for a second brother B said in the in the very hour he said they came in robbed the man took the gold and killed him and it was all because he shot amen the voice of warning because he got a little high Mighty and didn't think he needed what a prophet said anymore he got a little H Mighty and didn't think you needed to say I'm wrong and a prophet is right but you know what I say tonight I say God forbid the day ever come amen that we shoot these tapes down and we shoot this message down listen America is going to be craters the world is falling apart Russia is hollering Iran is moving hey there's a bride on the earth tonight who is heard the voice of mercy and the voice of Mercy has made an announcement that God has provided a way to escape the judgment and is coming upon this Earth I tell you what you ought to do tonight you ought to shout hallelujah your babies are safe your family is safe your church is saved everything about you is saved because you heard the voice of Mercy in the time of judgment Hallelujah I refuse I refuse to turn these tapes off and replace them with some charismatic preacher I refuse to shut my message books and open some Theology of some denomination I refuse Amen to lay aside the Seven Seals and follow some education I am a Son of God who is quickened by the mercy of God I got to stay under the provision of God in the age I'm living in judgment's coming church but we've heard the voice of Mercy hallelujah hallelujah judgment's on its way but we've heard the sound of Mercy now you all know according to Hebrews 6 that we're living in the hour of the second crucifixion of Jesus said like this he said see the first one was flesh physically he said the second one is word spiritually now in Luke 23:33 brother uses this for his sermon the indictment he says and then they were come to place which is called Calvary and there they Cru crucified him now watch the malf facturers one on the right and one on the left can I break it down the way a prophet did there Jerusalem the most holy place they the most holy people crucified the most violent death and killed the Prince of Peace amen him the most precious person there Jerusalem Holy place they holy people killed crucified him the most holy person brother takes that scripture and preaches a sermon called the indictment and he says I must show and will show that The Same Spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucifixion and is doing the same thing he said I must do that if it's going to be a crucifixion that they've crucified I must show to the people that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then come on Church amen 2,000 years ago they used to cat A N Tails 2,000 years ago they used a hammer 2,000 years ago they used to whip amen but today the same devil that anointed them to pick up the hammer is the same devil that anoints people to receive a bad attitude come on now amen towards the word of God and they don't even realize that their attitude amen is crucifying the word of God AR fresh well I might as well preach I'm here had I amen they get up and say well you know I believe brother br's a prophet but we got to look at this amen your attitude amen is crucifying the effect of the message well I believe brother Ram was a prophet but you know amen we got to stay with the Bible amen I'm just going to go ahead and preach since I'm here amen that's the most sickening worst insult that you could give to a Vindicated Prophet is that he's taught something that you can't find in the Bible I say everything he found amen any priest can be found the Bible and somebody asked me one time hey said brother Andrew you ain't got no scripture for that I said oh but I it's called Malachi 4:5 and 6 come on now a amen it's not that we don't have scripture it's that they won't accept the scripture we have but I believe church amen his mercy and his grace has brought us a message in the hour of judgment Amen to escape the perversion and the religious confusion that's upon this Earth so they crucified physically Jesus Christ the son of God and now today by the same word by the same Holy Spirit and the same word he said I wish to show the churches where they stand that they're doing the same thing today and the Bible said they would do it and prove that it's the day we're living in it could not been done a few years ago I say 50 years ago it could not have been done but today this is very timely and it could not have been done maybe 10 years ago come on now if your study is the message you know where I'm at I'm in I'm in 1963 and a prophet of God was preaching in 1953 and he St 10 years later and said 10 years ago what I'm saying couldn't have been said and what they're doing couldn't have been done he said because we are at the end time and I believe as his servant that we're just about to cross from this land to another the time for repentance for a nation is gone I believe that this nation amen cannot repent the nation you're living in he said it cannot repent because it is crossed amen between the line of mercy and judgment he said I believe believe amen that she's toddling in the balance now you all know I'm in Daniel 5 where there was a vision and a handwriting on the wall and it said that they found warning amen they're weighed in the balances and found warning can I say this friends we're not in the balances tonight we're walking in the promises of the word of God in the hour that we're living in I love what Matthew 5:7 says amen everybody feel good tonight amen blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy listen blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy Ram comes along and says now that's the only way to obtain Mercy is to follow the instructions that God has given us to follow in that's the only way somebody say the only way only way he can show Mercy is when we follow what he said do he said I'm so glad to know that the first revelation of Christ is Mercy and the second Revelation is Judgment oh God thank you for these who has taken Mercy to tonight amen they're on Mercy's Road brother Terry when I read that I about had to shout amen I'm not on the road to judgment I'm not on the road to tribulation we're not on the road to some type of some type of religious come on now amen we're not on that road but the message of the hour has placed us brother Sean on Mercy's road then friends amen we're walking by Mercy we're living by Mercy we're praying by Mercy we're singing by Mercy hey I might as well just go ahead and say it amen and God is here tonight in a manifestation of the same Mercy that he had back there I love Lamentations 3:22 amen is it okay to preach a little bit here amen it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed amen that just that just grabbed me brother Shi it's of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not I want you to look at this word consumed it means to be complete it means to be finished it means to be at the end it means to cease it means to be exhausted it means to be spent it means to be completely crossed over listen the Bible said it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not exhausted it's of the Lord's mercies that we have not ceased oh God it is of the Lord's mercies that we're not all spent out amen now why because they are new Every Morning his mercies are new every morning now come on church either you believe the Bible or you don't come on Amen either you're letting your situation dictate scripture or you're going to let scripture dictate the situation and I think it's high time Amen to let scripture dictate our situations you say well preacher I got a bad report of the doctor amen so you're going to let

Mercy has the ability Amen to walk into sick cases and change the doctor's report come on can I get a witness here tonight that Mercy has got two feet and mercy can walk in a situation hey I remember when I first started preaching I heard somebody say it and I think I ran all over the place with it brother Tim somebody said when Mercy Mercy Walked In they said when Justice was about to hang me amen Mercy Cut the Rope now come on if you got the justice of God Amen we would have done been hung by our mistakes we would have done been hung by our failures we would have done been hung by our first birth amen but God who is rich in Mercy has the ability to walk into situations and literally change the outcome you me prove it to you by the Bible it's in Daniel 3 there were three Hebrew boys who were going in the furnace prophet of God said they were there were three more down there he said they pledged their loyal to the cause who were truly Abraham's seed and that was Shadrach meach and abedo and they were put to the test now here's what they said if you do not bow when you hear the harps are playing and the trumpets are sounding if you do not bow to our religion and get away from them things you're standing for and you're all wet anyhow your religion is no more than anybody else's he said don't we hear that all the time but the religion of Jesus Christ is different he said the power of his resurrection is different we are a different people we are A peculiar people we are a royal priesthood I love this brother Brian amen God makes a difference come on Friends amen we're

didn't let the doctor's report consume her but she let her praise and her worship and her faith and her loyalty to who she was as a daughter of God Amen cons the circumstances well you know what I say it's time to do it's time to release your Eagle wings it's time to release your identity as a Son of God and let your word identity amen consume the devil in front of you I believe it I believe it's time to be like Shadrach mesach and abedo they said now listen you have to become one of us amen it would have been all right with Shadrach mesach and abedo if they want to become one of them but

preaching this to you I've been down this Road I've walked this road as a young man I've walked it when the trials and the pressures and the situations were trying to consume my identity but God who is rich in Mercy would not allow me to go back to be an alien alienated from God because of the conditions of my life if you don't do it then get listen if you don't become one of us then you don't do it then we got a door there the furnace can be opened up and throw you into it and you'll wish you become one of us can I just go ahead and say it brother brother Cole can I go ahead and say it amen

pressure to say the message is the absolute i w get in trouble you're in the world they need a break every now and again cuz it's just too much pressure to say that that third pool is in the bride they need a break every now and again cuz it's just too much to say Amen that God was with his prophet and that Prophet was the breach between the seven chages and the Seven SE it's too much to say what a prophet said but you're looking at one Holy Ghost filled Son of God that will not take a holiday and Retreat from saying what the prophet said because I know what the devil's trying to do he's trying to change our identity he's trying to get us under enough pressure that we back off of the message and we back off of this area and before long we become a spineless amen wishy-washy Christian but Faith Tabernacle you've crushed too many waves you've crossed too many mountains you've crossed too many valleys Amen to lay down now it's time to tighten up the armor it's time to cast off the

furnace they remembered the promise of their God what did the Lamentations three said this will I recall to my mind amen my soul hath him stealing remembrance and is humbled in me can I say this that's why the devil hates you amen because it's it's not just your flesh remembering who you are it's not just your spirit remembering who you are but there's a soul on the inside of you that has come predestinated from the almighty god listen and when my flesh forgets who I am and when my spirit forgets Who I Am My Soul remembers I was on my way to hell but God who is rich in Mercy stooped down and picked me up and turned me around and set me on Mercy's Road Hallelujah if anybody got a right of Praise if anybody got a rightous shout it's those who can remember from their souls who they

all of a sudden amen we don't even feel the Flames brother Sean and they looked around and all of a sudden they said where in the world is that breeze coming from where is that breeze coming from amen because it wasn't till they got in the fire that they met the fourth man when they got in the fire brother Daniel is when the Fourth Man showed up and when the fourth man walked in there you know what he done he walked in his Mercy glory to God he walked in his Mercy he walks right in that fiery furnace and he began to talk to him brother Terry I love what brother BR says he said he began to talk to them about their future he be to talk to them about their future they're in the middle of a fiery furnace amen but the Fourth Man shows up come on church he couldn't show up in the ring he couldn't

the night if the Watchman of Israel ever slumbered or slept we are sustained by the mercies of God listen Man's whole life his bodily his mental and spiritual is sustained by the mercy of the Lord can I say what the what what what this says it's of the Lord Mercy that we are not consumed intellectually it's of the Lord's Mercy that's just a commentary take or leave it it's of the Lord's Mercy that

going to have a spell all by myself amen anybody get on the same page with me amen continual evolution of thought amen continual wear and tear on the brain amen the daily anxiety of the mind but against this is set the all renewing energy of the Holy Ghost who gives the strength day by day repairing the waste of faculty and renewing the resources of power come on Church we've laid aside our mind and we have received the mind of Christ and because of his mind the Mind battles can't consume us because of his mind the wear and tear and the anxiety cannot consume us because the all renewing energy of the Holy Ghost has been set against amen the ambush of Hell listen friends it's time to remember the devil could get you he would have already done it but he hadn't got you cuz he can't get you because the Holy Ghost has already sealed you until the day of your Redemption listen come on devil throw what you want to but the Holy Ghost has sealed this old boy soul and his mercies are new

don't even pray what good is your listen I didn't come to preach nothing deep I come to preach my heart are you hearing me amen just give in just give up amen but then all of a sudden the Holy Ghost Rises up and says devil you've gone as far as you're going to go you've talked as long as you're going to talk now let me talk a little bit if it wasn't for the Lord who was on your side amen greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world if God before you then who can be against you and all of a sudden there is a down deposit of the mercies of God and they begin to refresh your praise and all of a sudden your prayer turns into worship and it turns into praise and the devil says not again not again but you know what I want to tell that devil stick around as long as you want to but there is no limits on the mercy of God somebody ought to shout right there cuz I know you know what I'm talking about I know you know what I'm talking about devil wear your mind out and they said they done they thought they text they wrote they thought I've been there amen I've been there amen I'm just going to preach since I'm here I've been there I've been there when the devil wanted me to throw my hands and say well what's the use anymore I've been there when the devil said everything you tried has fallen apart but it's in those lonely hours I can raise up my hands Jo and I can remember amen my soul begins to remember that my God has never failed me he's never forsaken me he's never left me he's never condemned me he's the god who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah he's the God who is the all consuming God he repairs he comes in the night seasons and repairs he repairs The Faculty of the mind you know how repairs it by taking your mind away and giving you his mind and then you wake up in the morning and you start thinking like he thinks and you start talking like he talks can I just be real can I just be real amen amen you start thinking like he thinks talking like he talks but as you War all day long the devil does everything he can to get you away from that mind come on that's why your prayer is important and listen them tapes is important listen this ain't an education this ain't some PowerPoint get up 10 steps to a healthy home and 10 steps to a healthy marriage amen this is the power of the Regeneration through the renewing of the Holy Ghost listen the same holy ghost that renew your soul is the same holy ghost that can renew your mind listen Faith Tabernacle I think we can start thinking like God again I honestly believe it sister Faith I believe right here tonight amen that the mercies of God can consume That Old Devil of anxiety can consume That Old Devil of condemnation in just a few minutes sister Jane That Old Devil can be under your foot and you can be consumed in the fire of God and the worship of God the end time is a very battles some time right amen but it's of his mercies brother Tim we are not consumed intellectually brother said according to Matthew 24 and 2 Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit speaks of this intellectual age at the end time what's the matter don't take place in America the power of God because it's the intellectual time they want someone who can speak not of judgment not of these things because it breaks them up from their Fellowship because it breaks them up from their clubs and their lodges and their ungodly things that they belong to said that's what got the church in trouble today is too many educated preachers oh God too many educated preachers without being born of the spirit now I might as well just say it if you ain't God it you can't preach [Music] it hello somebody if you ain't got it you can't preach it well that devil don't like it but I ain't back backing up if you ain't got it you can't preach it so that's why they resort to psychology and they resort to education and they resort to this idea and this program because they haven't been on the backside of the desert Amen in a war against the devil and the pillar of fire come down and equip them to face the devil you know what I say I say God bless them they can do what they want but ask for me in my house we're not listening to intellectual speeches in the stad of preaching the power and the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what God is in trouble today we don't need any more high schools and education for preachers we need God called men that's filled where the Holy Spirit and not some man-made Theology of some denomination can I say it and say it plain we've had enough intellectual speeches come on Church we've had enough intellectual speeches brother said them intellectual speeches are deceptive he said they're polished up he said I don't believe in intellectual speeches I believe in the word itself and then stay with that promise Until It's Made manifest and fulfilled then you've got it see that's what the church needs today is the power and the truth again intellectual Giants have come in and they've got all pushed in and they pushed Christ Plum out of his church he's standing knocking to the door of his own house trying to get back in oh God no other age was it ever that way but it is in this age this intellectual age but you've got your soldiers harnessed that's why the devil hates these kind of meetings amen is because God has got some soldiers that are harnessed to the power and the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and they believe that if you start looking long enough you'll boil it down to a spirit now we might as well say it listen people say well I don't think every problem is a spirit problem well that's because some intellectual polished up souser has convinced you it's not and N can I preach brother Sean and nine times out of 10 why they don't want to believe it's your spirit problem is because the only way you can get rid of it's cast it out and the only way you can cast it out is the Holy Ghost come on the scene come come I've been there I've been in some prayer lines and seen some demons manifest themselves it ain't a pretty sight amen and I've seen some guys amen stand there and say now come on let's talk hey hey wake up look at me amen that ain't the time to talk amen that ain't the time to cancel that devil that's the time to say Satan you're trespassing on God's precious property and by the authority and the power of the word of God I serve you eviction notice and I say take your hands off of God's Property what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's time it's time I amen I'm out of time amen but it's time to put that devil in his place it's time to move I said it's time to move church it's time to move this ain't a this ain't a leot ofan church this is a bride church it's time to move where we going Andrew we're literally moving into another manifestation of another Ephesians listen we have been positionally placed because Ephesians amen parallels Joshua remember said Ephesians is the book of redemption can I say this this is an Unstoppable Exodus can I say it to you like this brother Terry on the morning when they left Egypt when they went in their tents they were wore out they were B over they were stooped over their shoulders were stooped amen they couldn't hardly breathe amen some of them were barely just dragging amen with lashes in their back and blood coming out of those lashes just barely got them just barely got them sewed up the night before and they got open the next morning amen amen I'm going to close on this point okay but his mercies are new Hallelujah every morning that makes me want to do a dance his mercies are new every morning when they went in there y'all just dramatize me okay imagine brother Terry amen they walk in there and as they're walking in there the blood is oozing out of their back and maybe they're hard to hear and and Moses stands out there and says now everybody go in your tents and eat the lamb go in your tents and eat the lamb now imagine Grandma and Grandpa going in there and Grandpa's hard of hearing and he says what do he say Grandma I'm I'm poor job at dramatizing me give me some Grace grandma said listen he said eat the lamb grandpa said I don't like ham they said no lamb lamb lamb lamb eat it I ain't got no teeth eat it anyhow gum it Hallelujah whatever you do digest that lamb and they got in there and they begin to tear off them lamb chops they begin to tear off that lamb and they begin to eat the deity of Jesus Christ and then they begin to eat the greatest battle ever fought and then they begin to eat Christ is the mystery of God revealed and when Moses seen him go in the tent when Moses seen him go in the tent they were all bleedy they were all bruised they were all beat down and stooped over but on the morning of Exodus when Moses walked out there amen they've been in there eating that lamb and Sister Kim Grandma was out there doing jumping jacks and Grandpa was out there lifting weights he was saying what are we going to do we're going to the promised land listen when they woke up his mercies was New Church of the Living God I say to you tonight go home and turn on a tape go home and have an oldfashioned prayer meeting go home and say Satan you've come in this home and now foul Spirit you've encroached and encroached long enough but as for me in my house I've come under the Revelation that his mercies are new every morning and Satan this is your last day of depression in this home this is your last day of nervousness in this home this is your last day of confusion in this home his mercies are new every morning and I'm going to feed on a word that'll release those Mercies in my soul and when I wake up in the morning I'll say greater is he that is in me what are you saying preacher it's an Unstoppable Exodus I sat there preaching to that brother Ted brother Shan he said something pretty good he said now he said a lot of people don't like getting old he said but I'm actually enjoying it he said I'm enjoying getting old he said it's getting fun I got thought where's he going with this he said every morning I wake up and say where's the new pain going to be today I thought well I guess I guess that's one way to look at it he said it's fun and then he said you know why it's fun he said because when that pain shows up quickening power is right behind it woo Glory come on church amen so focus on the pain or get ready to receive the quickening power and the quickening power can bring a change listen friends don't you realize that's why you're going to wake up one morning with all them old aches and pains but then all of a sudden his mercies are new every morning and the Rapture you've been hearing and the words you've been feeding on is going to consume old age now can I say
