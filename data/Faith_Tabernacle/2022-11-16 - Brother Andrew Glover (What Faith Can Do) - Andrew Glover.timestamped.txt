[13:35] we're headed to Nashville for a new
[13:37] treatment to start tomorrow in uh in the
[13:41] morning it's called Uh a certain thing
[13:44] it's an IV radiation it targets cancer
[13:48] cells wherever they are in the body and
[13:51] so it has of course the the usual
[13:53] symptoms but she says I'm believing for
[13:56] maximum cancer busting effects and
[13:59] minimal side effects
[14:01] and said he's done it many times before
[14:04] I've no reason to doubt him now
[14:07] there are four of these treatments one
[14:10] every eight weeks she said I'll also be
[14:13] receiving the Santa dostan
[14:17] shots every four weeks so she said these
[14:21] shots usually make me feel pretty cruddy
[14:24] for several weeks but God is more than
[14:27] able to take care of this as well and so

[42:23] behind this sacred desk once more father
[42:25] we are very well aware that your
[42:27] presence is in this building Lord as
[42:30] your Believers have begin to lay aside
[42:32] the thoughts and cares of life and Lord
[42:35] we have begin to lift up your name and
[42:37] to sing the songs of zine and Praises
[42:39] unto Your Name Lord I believe that your
[42:42] word tells us that you inhabit the
[42:43] Praises of your people and Lord I
[42:46] believe that you have descended in this
[42:48] building tonight as the Praises have
[42:50] begun to go up now Lord as we come to
[42:52] this portion of this service to open
[42:54] your word father we've been taught that
[42:56] anyone with physical strength can open
[42:57] this book but it'll take you Lord with
[43:00] spiritual strength to open our
[43:01] understanding that we could receive
[43:03] something that would be more than just
[43:05] an idea or would be more than just a
[43:07] scripture or a quote but father it would
[43:09] be an edification to the lives of your
[43:11] Believers and Lord I pray tonight for my
[43:14] brothers and sisters here father you see
[43:16] every need oh God you see every
[43:18] situation the diseases in the sickness

[43:27] healing would come into sick bodies
[43:28] tonight Lord I pray that those that are
[43:31] discouraged and depressed father would
[43:32] be encouraged and would be lifted by
[43:34] your presence oh God for those that are
[43:36] Lord empty tonight I pray Lord that you
[43:39] would feel them dear God With the
[43:40] blessings according to Faith oh God lord
[43:42] if there be one here without the baptism
[43:44] of the Holy Ghost in fire they don't
[43:46] know you in the power of your
[43:47] resurrection and The Parting of your
[43:49] blood I pray tonight would be the night
[43:51] that would transform their lives forever

[43:55] here tonight Lord that stands higher
[43:57] than the other one or better father we
[43:59] stand on the same ground Lord Redeemed

[44:04] myself to you may you anoint those
[44:06] speaker and hear a father may you speak
[44:08] through me and may you hear through the
[44:10] Believers Lord and father when this
[44:11] meeting would be dismissed may it be
[44:13] another Emmaus walk Lord road walk
[44:16] experience oh God that we would say did
[44:19] not our hearts burn within us it's not
[44:20] as brother Andrew or another man talked
[44:23] to us along the way but Lord as you come
[44:25] and revealed yourself and Lord we'll be
[44:27] sure to give you all the praise all the
[44:29] honor and all the glory for it's in the
[44:31] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[44:33] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[44:35] Believers says
[44:37] amen and amen the book of Hebrews the
[44:39] 11th chapter in the 32nd verse I want to
[44:43] look there I know you know this chapter
[44:46] by heart it's speaking of The Heroes of
[44:48] Faith but he comes down here in the 32nd
[44:51] verse Paul and says what shall I more
[44:53] say for the time would fail me to tell
[44:56] of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson
[44:59] and of jephthah of David also and Samuel
[45:02] and of the prophets who through faith
[45:04] now notice this who through faith
[45:06] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[45:09] obtain promises stop the mouths of lines
[45:13] quench the violence of fire escape the
[45:15] edge of the sword and out of weakness
[45:17] were made strong we're wax violent in
[45:20] fight and turned to fly the armies of
[45:22] the aliens women received their dead
[45:24] raised to life again and others were
[45:26] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[45:28] they might obtain a better resurrection
[45:30] and others had trial of cool markings
[45:33] and scourging yay moreover of bonds and
[45:36] imprisonment they were still own they
[45:37] were sawing asunder they were tempted
[45:39] they were slain with the sword they
[45:41] wandered about in sheepskin and goat
[45:42] skins being destitute Afflicted and
[45:45] tormented of whom the world was not
[45:47] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[45:50] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[45:52] earth and these all having obtained a
[45:55] good report through faith received not
[45:58] the promise for God having provided some
[46:00] better thing for us that they without us
[46:03] should not be made perfect amen we asked
[46:06] Lord this evening to add the blessing
[46:08] and to the reading of his word as you
[46:09] can be seated here this afternoon
[46:11] I I trust that everyone is feeling well
[46:15] and amen here to receive from the Lord
[46:17] tonight I want to for a few moments if I
[46:20] could to speak tonight if I title this
[46:21] to all I want to speak to you on the
[46:23] thought of What Faith Can Do What Faith
[46:27] Can Do I was listening to a tape the
[46:29] other day in 1959 bloodbam's preaching
[46:31] blind Bartimaeus and he said now Jesus
[46:34] could not have heard his voice he was a
[46:36] hundred or two hundred yards from him
[46:37] and people were screaming he wasn't
[46:39] listening to them and they was fussing
[46:41] at him but he was thinking of Jerusalem
[46:43] he said but that blind Beggar's Faith
[46:46] stopped him and he turned he said what's
[46:48] going on and he said bring him here he
[46:51] said what was taking place that
[46:53] insignificant beggar stopped Jesus on
[46:56] his road to Jerusalem he said now your
[46:59] faith can do the same thing tonight he
[47:02] turned around and he began to look and
[47:04] said bring him here what was happening
[47:06] God provided a lamb for blind Bartimaeus
[47:09] eyes he said that same lamb is United
[47:12] tonight for every person and everywhere
[47:14] he's passing by he said let your faith
[47:18] stop him think about that that Jesus was
[47:21] on his road to Jerusalem and they were
[47:23] they were criticizing him they were
[47:25] talking they were doing all kinds of
[47:26] things he meant but he was not even
[47:28] paying attention to what the critics was
[47:30] saying he had he had a vision he had a
[47:33] he had a purpose he had something that
[47:35] he was going to accomplish and as he's
[47:37] walking there's a man that's not even
[47:38] within maybe seeing distance of him he's
[47:41] about 200 or 300 yards away amen but
[47:44] there was something in that man that
[47:46] connected with Jesus and it literally
[47:48] caused Jesus to stop and turn around and
[47:51] say bring him to me and the prophet of
[47:53] God said that was not Bartimaeus his
[47:55] religion it was not his social standing
[47:57] it was not what family he come out of
[47:59] Amen but it was the faith of Jesus
[48:01] Christ that was in Bartimaeus amen that
[48:04] caused Jesus to stand still and I love
[48:06] where the Prophet says and your faith
[48:08] can do the same thing tonight amen that
[48:10] tells me that the faith of God is not
[48:13] dead amen laying in a tomb in Jerusalem
[48:16] but the faith of God is alive and it's
[48:18] well and it's in the hearts of his
[48:20] Believers tonight I think of what the
[48:22] disciples said when they come to Jesus
[48:24] and they said Lord increase our faith
[48:26] how many could say here tonight amen
[48:28] Lord increase our faith amen the Bible
[48:31] says in Hebrews 11 verse 1 it says now
[48:33] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[48:35] for amen it's the evidence of Things Not
[48:38] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[48:40] good report amen notice this through
[48:42] faith we understand that the worlds were
[48:44] framed by the word of God so that things
[48:47] which are seen were not made of things
[48:49] which do appear in the message believe
[48:51] in God he said I'm going to teach a
[48:52] little bit about faith that's what we
[48:54] all need a whole lot of this and he said
[48:56] faith is not an Evidence it's only a
[48:59] substance he said Faith itself is a
[49:01] substance and an Evidence of things amen
[49:04] that the senses of the body will not
[49:06] declare and I thought maybe in teaching
[49:08] this that it would spur your faith up
[49:10] amen deceit to get it to a level Amen to
[49:13] where God can move into you and he can
[49:15] bless you then the prophet was not
[49:17] teaching on faith Amen to condemn the
[49:19] church but he was actually preaching on
[49:21] faith to elevate the church to a place
[49:23] amen that the god of the Bible the god
[49:26] that went by blind Bartimaeus the god
[49:28] that stopped the Widow of saints the
[49:30] Widow of named son rather amen from
[49:32] dying and brought him back to life that
[49:34] same God is in the midst of his church
[49:36] desire and to bless his church amen and
[49:39] when our faith is down there's not much
[49:40] he can do amen though when our faith
[49:42] gets raised to a level amen then we'll
[49:45] see more than church annity but a
[49:46] prophet said amen we will see Apostolic
[49:49] times how many can say I want to see
[49:51] amen Apostolic times the prophet of God
[49:54] said we're trying to give the church
[49:55] into the place to where we can really
[49:57] approach and see Apostolic times
[50:00] moving Among Us that's what we all
[50:03] hunger for is it not amen and it's just
[50:05] laying right at the door we see it but
[50:07] we want to see more of it amen we see
[50:10] healings but we want to see more of them
[50:11] we see amen deliverages but we want to
[50:14] see more of them we see Miracles amen
[50:16] but we want to see more of them is that
[50:18] right amen we see people receiving the
[50:20] Holy Ghost but we want to see more of it
[50:22] we we see people receiving Revelation
[50:24] but we want to see more of it amen than
[50:26] if there's a desire to see more of it
[50:29] amen then there's a God who will honor
[50:31] the desire to see more of it he said we
[50:33] want it in such a way that it'll flow
[50:35] amen and it'll be a help to us and it'll
[50:37] flow out to others now when you start
[50:39] talking about faith the prophet of God
[50:41] says usually people that has Faith amen
[50:44] has experience so he's showing you amen
[50:46] that experience brings Faith amen a
[50:49] person who normally has faith has
[50:51] experience amen and experience brings
[50:53] Faith now I'm just going to lay a
[50:55] foundation here for a second the prophet
[50:57] of God said that faith is not seen he
[50:59] says seen is not believing he said
[51:02] understanding is believing now we see
[51:04] another one you don't doubt amen have
[51:06] heard them say seeing is believing
[51:08] that's an old proverb but that doesn't
[51:10] work because man can sit and look right
[51:12] straight at anything and they'll not see
[51:14] it he said the word see the English word
[51:16] see has so many different meanings to it
[51:18] amen see s-e-a amen might mean a body of
[51:22] water and then s-e might mean to
[51:24] understand or it might mean to look at
[51:25] there's just all kinds of words you can
[51:27] use amen but when you say seen is
[51:30] believing then you're mistaken but when
[51:32] you understand it you believe it when
[51:34] you understand it you believe it Jesus
[51:36] said except a man be born again he
[51:39] cannot see the kingdom in other words he
[51:41] cannot understand the kingdom because
[51:43] the kingdom is the holy spirit in you so
[51:47] you have to understand what that is that
[51:49] is in you and the only way you'll
[51:51] understand it is compare what it makes
[51:54] you do with what the Bible said it would
[51:55] make you do amen amen if faith is in
[51:58] your heart amen there's no question
[52:00] whether it's not bear or not amen
[52:02] because your actions will be manifesting
[52:04] what the Bible said a person who
[52:06] possesses faith will be manifesting he
[52:08] said then your problem solved see he is
[52:11] that Holy Spirit now we all know this by
[52:13] heart that Faith must have amen a
[52:15] resting place and the prophet said
[52:17] anything that's contrary to the word of
[52:19] God Amen faith in God can have no
[52:21] resting place unless it's a promise of
[52:23] God and then it takes its Eternal stand
[52:26] notices it does not take its temporary
[52:28] stand it does not take its momentarily
[52:31] stand amen but it takes its Eternal
[52:33] stand Amen in other words that if faith
[52:36] is based upon the promise of God Amen
[52:39] then conditions will not change a
[52:40] person's faith if faith is built upon a
[52:43] promise of God then circumstances will
[52:45] not cause one to back off of that
[52:47] promise amen may have been anointed by
[52:49] that promise to believe that promise and
[52:51] faith will bring the promise to pass
[52:53] amen I love the way the prophet says it
[52:55] he says faith is the foundation of all
[52:58] things now we start talking about
[52:59] Foundation you can automatically go to
[53:02] Second Peter the first chapter and there
[53:04] you'll find that Peter actually outlines
[53:06] what the prophet of God calls amen the
[53:09] stature of a perfect man and he says see
[53:11] right there there are seven Divine
[53:13] virtues now these are not natural
[53:14] virtues amen but these aren't Divine
[53:17] virtues in the in the book of second
[53:19] Peter 1 verse 3. he said according it's
[53:21] his divine power hath given unto us all
[53:23] things that pertain unto life and
[53:25] godliness through the knowledge of him
[53:27] that has called us to glory and to
[53:29] Virtue whereby are given unto us
[53:31] exceeding great and precious promises
[53:33] amen that by these you might be
[53:35] partakers of the divine nature have an
[53:38] escape the corruption that is in the
[53:40] world through lust and beside this
[53:42] giving all diligence watch this add to
[53:44] your faith amen virtue into your virtue
[53:47] knowledge now right there is the very
[53:49] first virtue that the prophet is going
[53:51] to show us amen as the foundation of the
[53:54] stature of a perfect man amen is the
[53:56] virtue of Faith he said and you must be
[53:59] born again and when you're are born
[54:00] again he said you cannot be born again
[54:02] without having faith that's right so you
[54:04] see I've got the very Foundation faith
[54:07] is the foundation of all of it amen so
[54:09] the foundation of virtue is Faith the
[54:12] foundation of knowledge is Faith among
[54:14] now the foundation of temperance is
[54:16] Faith amen now come on if we're going to
[54:18] start at the foundation we've got to go
[54:19] to the top amen and at the top is the
[54:22] Capstone amen but notice the Capstone is
[54:24] coming down upon the foundation's tone
[54:27] and the foundation stone is Faith he
[54:29] said see without faith it is impossible
[54:31] to please God for he that coming to God
[54:33] must believe that he is and a rewarder
[54:36] of those that diligently seek Him and
[54:38] when you're a skeptic of the Bible when
[54:40] you're a skeptic of the word being right
[54:41] you might as well stay back until you
[54:43] first believe it amen because what is
[54:45] sin it is unbelief and there is only two
[54:48] elements that control the human being
[54:50] that's either doubt or faith you're
[54:53] either controlled by doubt or you're
[54:54] controlled by faith you're possessed of
[54:57] one that dominates your life so it just
[54:59] depends on how much Faith you have is
[55:02] how high you can rise
[55:04] how much Faith you have is how high that
[55:07] you can rise now we know that Faith
[55:09] actually makes it impossible amen our
[55:11] faith actually makes it possible rather
[55:13] Amen to please God in the book of
[55:15] Hebrews 11 6 Paul says without faith it
[55:19] is impossible to please him for he that
[55:21] cometh to God must believe that he is
[55:23] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[55:25] diligently seek him remember says in
[55:27] perfect Faith now Faith he that cometh
[55:30] to God must believe that he is and it's
[55:32] impossible to please God without faith
[55:34] you cannot please him if you say you
[55:36] believe God you've never seen him see
[55:38] amen then you've got to believe it by
[55:41] faith and if you could see him it would
[55:43] be no more faith if you could see him it
[55:45] would be no more faith anything that the
[55:48] senses declare is no more faith it's a
[55:50] scientific fact see it's not no more
[55:53] faith amen but you have to accept him by
[55:56] faith and if you could see God it would
[55:58] remove God from being a supernatural God
[56:00] to be in a scientific fact amen but I
[56:03] want to propose to you to not that my
[56:05] God is not a scientific fact amen my God
[56:08] it's not a he is not a scientific God he
[56:11] is not an intellectual God he is not a
[56:13] he is not a psychology God my God is a
[56:16] God who stepped out on nothing and
[56:18] created everything my God is the god
[56:21] that said let there be and there was my
[56:23] God he said God Amen that put the moon
[56:25] in the sky he put the sun in his place
[56:27] he put the sea in his place come on
[56:30] Church our God is not done to us by
[56:32] science our God is not known to us by
[56:34] education our God is known to us by the
[56:37] Simplicity of the faith of Jesus Christ
[56:39] and his return to this age my God is not
[56:42] a scientific fact my God is a living
[56:45] breathing press and reality he's a
[56:47] mighty God he's a he's a holy God he's a
[56:50] faithful God he said God that's never
[56:52] made one promise but what he was able to
[56:54] keep my God is not a scientific fact my
[56:58] God is a faithful God I love here in the
[57:00] book of Hebrews 11. now this is just
[57:02] Bible commentary note so you can take
[57:04] him or leave him in Hebrews 11 Paul says
[57:06] about 15 times he says these words by
[57:10] Faith by faith amen by faith and that
[57:13] means a living acts of faith it is a
[57:16] faith that knows and follows God it
[57:18] communes and fellowships with God it
[57:20] does not matter what a person does
[57:22] without faith he cannot please God
[57:25] without faith a person has to plow
[57:27] through this life all alone and handle
[57:29] all the trials and all the Temptations
[57:31] and all the sufferings and all the
[57:33] accidents and all the diseases and death
[57:35] by himself without faith a person stands
[57:38] all alone in this world Amen utterly
[57:40] without God it is impossible for him to
[57:44] please God and I say this to you
[57:45] according to a prophet that God never
[57:48] intended for his word to be accepted by
[57:51] intellectualism but he intended for his
[57:53] word to be accepted by faith he intended
[57:56] for his word to be preached by faith he
[57:58] intended for his word to be received by
[58:00] faith and the same faith it is preached
[58:02] by is the same Faith it's received by is
[58:05] the same faith that manifests the
[58:07] promise amen that you're receiving by
[58:09] faith amen listen Church neither did he
[58:11] intend for the word amen to be hidden in
[58:14] the mind amen but to be hidden in the
[58:16] heart I love what the prophet of God
[58:18] preaches he does not preach belief from
[58:20] the head he preaches believe from the
[58:24] heart
[58:25] is that okay he doesn't say belief from
[58:28] the head he says believe from the heart
[58:30] in the Book of Proverbs 23 verse 7 the
[58:33] bible says as he faketh in his heart
[58:35] amen so is he eat and drink saith he to
[58:39] thee but his heart is not with thee in
[58:41] Psalms 119 verse 11 David says amen Thy
[58:44] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[58:47] not sin against thee look here in Romans
[58:49] the 10th chapter and the 10th verse Paul
[58:51] says amen with the heart man believe if
[58:54] let's say that together with the heart
[58:56] man believeth unto righteousness and
[58:59] with the mouth confession is made unto
[59:01] salvation but say that with the heart
[59:03] man believeth
[59:05] with the mouth he confesses
[59:09] see with the heart he believes and with
[59:11] the mouth he confesses now right there
[59:13] Paul has just connected your heart to
[59:16] your mouth he is right there just made a
[59:18] Divine connection between the heart of a
[59:20] man and the mouth of a man amen because
[59:23] whatever is in the heart of a man is
[59:25] going to cross the lips of a man
[59:27] whatever is is on the control tower of
[59:30] the heart of a man is what he's going to
[59:32] speak by and I might as well preacher
[59:33] for a minute amen I think it's time to
[59:36] clean our hearts up I think it's time to
[59:38] get rid of all the negativity I think
[59:39] it's time to get rid of all the all the
[59:41] doubt and unbelief and skepticism amen
[59:44] because if negative is in your heart
[59:46] amen negative will come across your lips
[59:48] amen but if positive is in your heart
[59:50] amen then out of your heart your mouth
[59:53] is going to speak positive things there
[59:55] is a connection between the heart of a
[59:57] man and the mouth of a man amen and the
[59:59] Heart Believer from the righteousness
[1:00:01] and the mouth confesses is made into
[1:00:03] salvation remember said a man can have
[1:00:05] an intellectual Faith he said that's the
[1:00:07] reason you see people carrying on and
[1:00:08] she do under the name of Christianity
[1:00:10] it's only intellectual Faith what do you
[1:00:13] mean by intellectual faith brother man
[1:00:15] believeth unto salvation now Faith
[1:00:18] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[1:00:20] word now I could preach the word you
[1:00:22] could accept it and say that's all right
[1:00:23] yeah I believe that well if that's all
[1:00:25] the further it ever goes then you'll
[1:00:27] never get very far with God that's
[1:00:29] intellectual Faith he said that's the
[1:00:32] reason people doesn't get healed is
[1:00:34] because they only have an intellectual
[1:00:36] view of it amen what their mind
[1:00:38] conceives the mind will reason the mind
[1:00:40] will say it cannot be I'm no better my
[1:00:43] sense of science says that my harm is no
[1:00:45] stronger than it was yesterday my sense
[1:00:47] of feeling says I don't feel any
[1:00:49] different than I did yesterday he said
[1:00:51] reasoning mental theology will reason
[1:00:53] out and say wait a minute I believe
[1:00:55] that's foolishness amen intellectual
[1:00:57] faith will do that but when once that
[1:00:59] faith comes down into that compartment
[1:01:01] down here it'll never question this up
[1:01:04] here amen all it's absolutely a fact and
[1:01:07] it'll agree with every Divine word of
[1:01:10] God if faith is in your heart it will
[1:01:12] degree it will agree with every Divine
[1:01:15] word of God I love this tonight amen
[1:01:17] that the prophet says the reason people
[1:01:19] doesn't get where they should be it
[1:01:21] becomes a mental conception of God
[1:01:24] but when that mental conception you
[1:01:26] believe him by an intellectual Faith but
[1:01:29] that won't do it it's got to be a born
[1:01:31] again experience where your faith is
[1:01:33] brought down into this compartment here
[1:01:35] and no matter what it looks like faith
[1:01:38] says it's so anyhow no matter how dark
[1:01:40] it is faith says it's going to be okay
[1:01:42] no matter how cold it is faith says it's
[1:01:45] going to be okay no matter how weak you
[1:01:47] may be amen faith will confess the
[1:01:49] Divine promise of God's Divine word
[1:01:51] because this is not intellectual Faith
[1:01:54] this is not mental theology this is not
[1:01:56] so this is not schooling this is Faith
[1:01:59] now when you start looking at this
[1:02:00] intellectual faith I find it amazing
[1:02:02] that we have got intellectual Faith amen
[1:02:05] that has produced intellectual
[1:02:06] conceptions and I'll just go ahead and
[1:02:07] say it they produced intellectual Faith
[1:02:10] intellectual conceptions have produced
[1:02:12] total failures come on Church
[1:02:13] intellectual faith has produced
[1:02:15] intellectual conceptions which has in
[1:02:18] return produced total failures but look
[1:02:20] what Jesus said in Mark 11 23 he said
[1:02:22] rarely ask verily I say unto you you
[1:02:24] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:02:26] mountain be thou removed now I want you
[1:02:28] to catch something here whosoever shall
[1:02:31] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[1:02:34] and be thou cast in the sea what's he
[1:02:36] saying he's saying be thou removed he's
[1:02:38] saying be thou cast in the sea and shall
[1:02:41] not doubt in his heart
[1:02:44] are you with me Paul said for with his
[1:02:46] heart a man believeth unto righteousness
[1:02:48] and with his mouth he confesseth unto
[1:02:51] salvation and Jesus says whatever you
[1:02:54] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[1:02:56] and be thou cast in the sea and shall
[1:02:58] not doubt in his heart amen but Shall
[1:03:01] Believe those things which he saith amen
[1:03:03] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:03:05] whatsoever he saith amen there's that
[1:03:08] connection again that whatever is in the
[1:03:11] heart is what's going to be crossing the
[1:03:13] lips and Jesus said if there's doubt in
[1:03:15] your heart there'll be doubt crossing
[1:03:17] your lips and the mountain will not move
[1:03:19] and the Sea will stay in place amen but
[1:03:21] if faith has taken the control tower in
[1:03:24] the heart of the believer when that
[1:03:25] heart speaks Mountain be thou removed
[1:03:28] and see be cast Into the Depths amen
[1:03:30] something is going to move because it's
[1:03:32] more than a heart of Doubt speaking it's
[1:03:34] a heart of Faith speaking and he shall
[1:03:37] have whatsoever he's saith listen this
[1:03:39] believe from the heart he says well it
[1:03:41] seems like then upon thinking those
[1:03:42] things that there could be a place in by
[1:03:44] reading the word of faith that would go
[1:03:46] beyond the intellectual conceptions Into
[1:03:48] the Heart for Jesus said if Thou shalt
[1:03:52] say in thy heart now we get all
[1:03:54] frustrated in our minds right we go out
[1:03:56] and say oh I sing that done and once in
[1:03:58] a while it just hops Skip and so forth
[1:03:59] but it seems like it just can't get
[1:04:01] moving rights it's because we try to mix
[1:04:04] be intellectual with the supernatural
[1:04:06] they have no dealings with each other at
[1:04:09] all
[1:04:11] intellectuals will say one thing and
[1:04:14] Supernatural will say another and any
[1:04:16] man that's ever led by the spirit
[1:04:18] somebody say led by the spirit any man
[1:04:21] that's ever led by the spirit of God
[1:04:23] does not take any thought of any
[1:04:25] intellectual but he's LED from his heart
[1:04:28] by the spirit of God he's LED from his
[1:04:32] heart by the spirit of God then in other
[1:04:34] words what's your belief and you did not
[1:04:36] learn to believe you was led to believe
[1:04:38] in other words what you're confessing
[1:04:40] you did not learn to confess you was led
[1:04:43] to confess it I'll tell you this the
[1:04:45] problem of God said whatever God leads
[1:04:47] your soul to believe that is yours
[1:04:49] everywhere the soul of your foot sets
[1:04:51] upon that is your Possession come on
[1:04:53] church I know it may be a Wednesday
[1:04:55] night but let's have church anyhow I
[1:04:57] don't think we got to sit around here
[1:04:58] and our lips all bound up with
[1:05:00] depression and our lips all bound up
[1:05:02] with negativity amen we got a right to
[1:05:04] speak the word we've got to write to
[1:05:06] confess the word we got a right to speak
[1:05:08] the promises I'm on church we got a
[1:05:10] right to speak positive while we're
[1:05:12] surrounded by negative we got a right to
[1:05:14] speak Unity while we're surrounded by
[1:05:17] division we got a right to speak Faith
[1:05:19] amen when unbelief endowed is prevailing
[1:05:22] on every hand we are not the children of
[1:05:24] unbelief we are not the children of
[1:05:26] doubt we are the children of Faith by
[1:05:28] the promise of God
[1:05:30] we got a right to speak the word we got
[1:05:32] a right to confess the word we gotta
[1:05:34] right to confess these promises we have
[1:05:37] been led to believe
[1:05:39] I'm on Church we've been led to believe
[1:05:41] now then this word he is Left Behind on
[1:05:43] the printed page is a part of him when
[1:05:46] you accepted by faith into a
[1:05:48] Spirit-filled life he said his word was
[1:05:51] life
[1:05:52] is that right Jesus said his word was
[1:05:56] life amen but that is exactly what he is
[1:05:58] John 14 6 he said I am the way I am the
[1:06:01] truth and the life Romans 8 9 he says if
[1:06:04] any man have not the spirit of Christ he
[1:06:06] is none of his there it is he is spirit
[1:06:09] and he is life that is exactly what the
[1:06:12] word is that is exactly what Jesus is he
[1:06:16] is the word so when a spirit born
[1:06:18] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[1:06:21] word into his heart and places it up on
[1:06:24] his lips it's the same as deity speaking
[1:06:27] Every Mountain has to go amen Satan
[1:06:31] cannot stand before that man I'm on
[1:06:33] church amen that's why the prophet said
[1:06:35] that deity is not in heaven but deity is
[1:06:38] in the earth then pray tell me brother
[1:06:40] Tim where is deity it's not in heaven
[1:06:42] tonight it's in the heart of humanity by
[1:06:45] the new birth and the baptism of the
[1:06:47] Holy Ghost come on church all that God
[1:06:50] was he poured into Christ and all that
[1:06:52] Christ was us he poured into the church
[1:06:55] when that word is in the heart it's
[1:06:57] placed upon the lips that's the same as
[1:07:00] deity speaking Every Mountain has to go
[1:07:02] amen Satan cannot stand before that man
[1:07:06] every Mountain has to go among church if
[1:07:09] you forgot who you are you'll come in
[1:07:11] here tonight with a mountain in front of
[1:07:12] you and you won't even open your mouth
[1:07:14] and confess that Mountain's got to go
[1:07:15] deity's not in heaven deities in your
[1:07:18] heart tonight and that mountain that's
[1:07:20] stopping you from praising God that
[1:07:22] melting is stopping you from receiving
[1:07:24] an answer that mountain is stopping you
[1:07:26] from believing the word with a pure
[1:07:28] unadulterated faith I say it's time to
[1:07:30] loose your voice and speak the word with
[1:07:32] authority and anointing behind it and
[1:07:35] move forward Church deities not in
[1:07:37] heaven deity is in you are you hearing
[1:07:40] me I tell you the reason why the people
[1:07:42] are backing off the spoken word is
[1:07:44] because enticing Spirits have been LED
[1:07:47] out into the church come on now the
[1:07:49] father God said amen I'm feeling
[1:07:51] something cold up here if it could be
[1:07:52] cut off be great amen now today so many
[1:07:54] people listen to enticing Spirits
[1:07:56] instead of taking the word of God Amen
[1:07:58] Spirits they're in the world they're
[1:08:00] demons and they go out into places and
[1:08:02] they get amongst men and ministers and
[1:08:04] they get amongst church members and they
[1:08:05] get amongst good people and they cause
[1:08:07] them to come into an illusion and they
[1:08:09] say things and do things and teach
[1:08:11] things and practice things that's
[1:08:13] contrary to the word of God today
[1:08:15] ministers other congregations are
[1:08:17] allowing their people he said to play
[1:08:19] cards in the church and they say well
[1:08:21] that's Catholic amen that's not Catholic
[1:08:23] he said that's Protestant too what
[1:08:24] they're trying to do is a
[1:08:26] substitutionary something they're trying
[1:08:28] to adopt some new plan they're trying to
[1:08:30] adopt education to take the place of the
[1:08:33] Holy Ghost you will never be able to do
[1:08:36] it
[1:08:37] God never intended for a man to be led
[1:08:40] by education he never intended for man
[1:08:43] to be led by science he never intended
[1:08:45] for man to be led by technology he
[1:08:48] intended for man to be led by the Holy
[1:08:51] Ghost through the faith of the Holy
[1:08:52] Ghost that's why Malachi 4 amen was
[1:08:55] returned and restored what he did not
[1:08:57] restore the science he did not restore
[1:09:00] the education he did not restore
[1:09:02] intellectualism He restored the faith of
[1:09:04] God among church then tonight friends we
[1:09:07] are not sitting here as a partially
[1:09:09] restored church we are not sitting here
[1:09:11] as a partially restored people but the
[1:09:14] same faith that was in the beginning in
[1:09:16] the alpha bride will return in the Omega
[1:09:19] bride under the voice of the seventh
[1:09:21] angel and the same faith that was in
[1:09:23] blind Bartimaeus that caused Jesus to
[1:09:25] stand still that faith has returned to
[1:09:27] the church among friends amen make us
[1:09:30] subdue kingdoms they could stop fires
[1:09:32] they could put out Devils amen through
[1:09:34] faith and that is not another fave it's
[1:09:36] the same faith and that faith has been
[1:09:39] restored to the church may I propose to
[1:09:41] you tonight and declare that the faith
[1:09:43] of Jesus Christ is not dead it is alive
[1:09:46] and well
[1:09:49] come on somebody the faith of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ is not dead it's alive and it's
[1:09:55] well
[1:09:58] all said in Galatians 2.
[1:10:00] 2 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless
[1:10:02] I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:10:05] listen to these words and the life which
[1:10:07] I now live I live in the flesh come on I
[1:10:11] don't have time to preach there the life
[1:10:13] I now live I live in the flesh Paul did
[1:10:16] not become an angel after he met the
[1:10:18] pillar of fire on the road to Damascus
[1:10:19] he remained a human being he remained a
[1:10:22] man with false he remained the man with
[1:10:24] failures amen but he also received
[1:10:26] something that could mortify the Deeds
[1:10:28] of his flesh and could bring that flesh
[1:10:30] subject to the promise of God's Divine
[1:10:32] word and Paul could say the life I now
[1:10:35] live I live in the flesh and I live by
[1:10:38] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[1:10:41] and gave himself for me I live what the
[1:10:43] prophet of God said he said resurrect us
[1:10:46] to a living faith in the Living Word of
[1:10:49] this day then I'll say it to you like
[1:10:50] this denominationalism has done
[1:10:52] everything they can Amen to crucify the
[1:10:56] faith of Jesus Christ but the message of
[1:10:58] the hour was sent Amen to resurrect amen
[1:11:02] the faith of Jesus Christ by the
[1:11:04] quickening power of the Holy Ghost then
[1:11:06] in the Bible says it like this amen
[1:11:08] because I live ye live also
[1:11:11] come on now because I live ye live also
[1:11:14] he said see speaking to his wife because
[1:11:18] I live ye live also what a resurrection
[1:11:21] that was but what a resurrection this is
[1:11:24] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:11:27] alive in Christ Jesus by God's quick and
[1:11:30] empowered he was waved to them the word
[1:11:33] which he was was way back to them on the
[1:11:35] day of Pentecost he said the word made
[1:11:38] manifest what was way before the church
[1:11:40] on the day of Pentecost was the word
[1:11:43] made manifest now and I say it is to be
[1:11:46] waived again in the last day I'm on
[1:11:48] church amen what brought Jesus out of
[1:11:50] the Grave I'll tell you what did it was
[1:11:52] the faith of God what brought him across
[1:11:54] the river what brought him across the
[1:11:56] sea in the storm what's the faith of God
[1:11:58] how did he stand there and say you call
[1:12:00] me be Elsie Bob but when you've seen me
[1:12:02] you've seen the father how did Jesus
[1:12:04] overcome up on the mountain that day
[1:12:07] amen how to do all these things he did
[1:12:09] it by the faith of God and that faith
[1:12:13] that faith has returned to the church
[1:12:15] tonight
[1:12:16] that faith it was in the groom oh my
[1:12:19] these things bless my heart that faith
[1:12:21] it was in the groom has been resurrected
[1:12:23] in the bride that's why you're still
[1:12:26] pursuing your enemy that's why you're
[1:12:28] still taking inheritance that's why
[1:12:30] you're still possessing promises it's
[1:12:32] because the faith that was in the groom
[1:12:34] has been resurrected in the bride and
[1:12:36] what is that Faith the prophet said
[1:12:38] faith is something that's revealed to
[1:12:41] you
[1:12:42] that it's not yet but you believe it
[1:12:44] will be he said what is faith faith is a
[1:12:47] revelation of the will of God
[1:12:51] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[1:12:53] so he says by Revelation then I think
[1:12:57] tonight we could go through Hebrews 11
[1:12:59] and we could read by faith Moses and we
[1:13:01] could say by Revelation Moses we can
[1:13:04] read by faith Enoch and according to a
[1:13:06] prophet we could say by Revelation Enoch
[1:13:09] see what it was he said the Revelation
[1:13:11] the spiritual Revelation that the
[1:13:13] churches today don't even believe in
[1:13:15] they believe in a dogmatic teaching of
[1:13:17] some system he said but see Faith cometh
[1:13:20] by hearing
[1:13:21] I know this is simple but I pray to help
[1:13:23] then Faith come about hearing and
[1:13:25] hearing the word of God
[1:13:28] Faith cometh by hearing
[1:13:31] and hearing the word of God look at this
[1:13:33] in perfect Faith he says now Faith we're
[1:13:35] told in the Bible that Faith cometh by
[1:13:37] hearing now you cannot be saved without
[1:13:39] faith and faith is something that you
[1:13:41] have to believe it's there that really
[1:13:44] nothing else will declare it's there but
[1:13:46] faith
[1:13:48] faith is something that you've got to
[1:13:51] believe is there when really nothing
[1:13:53] else will declare it's there but it's
[1:13:55] there anyhow but brother Walker the only
[1:13:57] favor to declare it to you is your faith
[1:14:00] my listen to this he said like my little
[1:14:03] ego story works is Faith expressed last
[1:14:05] night he knew when he heard the scream
[1:14:07] of that mother Eagle now listen there's
[1:14:09] a lot of difference between that and the
[1:14:11] cluck of the hen
[1:14:13] are you hearing me there's a lot of
[1:14:15] difference between the scream of an
[1:14:17] eagle and the clerk of the hymn I got to
[1:14:19] preach on this other day and something
[1:14:20] come to me amen do you realize that that
[1:14:22] eagle amen had been birthed under a
[1:14:25] chicken in a barnyard Little Junior got
[1:14:27] down to monitor do you realize he had
[1:14:29] never heard a scream of an eagle
[1:14:32] he had never heard his mama scream he
[1:14:34] had never grown up here in Eagle Scream
[1:14:37] the only thing he ever heard was the
[1:14:39] clucking of a hymn then pray tell me
[1:14:42] amen when Mama eagle flew over the
[1:14:44] Barnyard amen what school did Junior go
[1:14:47] to to learn the sound of a scream of an
[1:14:49] eagle tell me what education did Junior
[1:14:51] sit under Amen to learn what the scream
[1:14:54] of an eagle sounded like amen but there
[1:14:56] was something on the inside of him it
[1:14:58] was a gene seed of an eagle he was an
[1:15:00] eagle from his birth he was an eagle
[1:15:02] while he was in the barnyard he was an
[1:15:04] eagle while he was clucking around with
[1:15:05] the chickens I'm on church and the
[1:15:07] brother said you weren't a Christian
[1:15:09] yesterday you always were a Christian
[1:15:11] amen see you didn't want to be amen a
[1:15:13] sinner but you become a sinner by nature
[1:15:15] but now you heard the gospel and Faith
[1:15:18] cometh by hearing he said Revelation
[1:15:21] comes by hearing
[1:15:24] when Junior heard the scream of the
[1:15:27] eagle it did not make him an eagle it
[1:15:30] did not make him as oh it did not make
[1:15:33] him a Son of God he always was the son
[1:15:35] of God he always was an eagle the only
[1:15:38] thing that Junior heard when he heard
[1:15:40] the scream of that eagle was a
[1:15:42] revelation of who he really was that's
[1:15:44] why Baptist ideas wouldn't satisfy you
[1:15:46] that's why Pentecostal Traditions amen
[1:15:48] made you sick at your stomach amen
[1:15:50] because you was an ego he was an eagle
[1:15:52] from the DNA of almighty God the only
[1:15:55] thing you needed was not an education
[1:15:57] was not a religious Seminary what you
[1:15:59] needed was to hear something that
[1:16:01] sounded like that Gene that was on the
[1:16:03] inside of you and the only thing that
[1:16:05] sent about that Gene was the word of
[1:16:07] almighty God delivered to you by the
[1:16:09] faith of God
[1:16:11] yeah
[1:16:13] it's a revelation of who you are when
[1:16:17] that eagle screamed he heard who he was
[1:16:19] he heard who he always was listen
[1:16:22] friends Jesus himself had faith I love
[1:16:26] this Jesus himself had Faith he said the
[1:16:30] only thing you have to do then is have
[1:16:32] faith in what you are
[1:16:35] have faith in what the word says you are
[1:16:41] the scream of the eagle said Junior was
[1:16:44] an eagle
[1:16:45] Junior received the Revelation and got
[1:16:48] up off the ground oh my and Jesus had
[1:16:52] faith in the word of God that said what
[1:16:54] he was it is written of me didn't David
[1:16:57] in the Psalms and the prophets all them
[1:16:58] speak of him he said I am the bread of
[1:17:00] life that come from God out of heaven
[1:17:02] I'm the Tree of Life from the Garden of
[1:17:03] Eden I am all these things I am that I
[1:17:06] am and he knew with that perfect faith
[1:17:08] that he was the anointed Messiah that
[1:17:11] the spirit of God was upon him he said
[1:17:13] now I and myself do nothing but it's my
[1:17:16] faith in God and God was in him the word
[1:17:18] made manifest and when the word of God
[1:17:21] comes in you it's made manifest for you
[1:17:24] are a Believer and a Believer is the
[1:17:27] faith of God that moves in you
[1:17:30] a Believer is the faith of God that
[1:17:34] moves in you see I love this a Believer
[1:17:36] is the faith of God that moves in you
[1:17:38] then a Believer has got to recognize
[1:17:40] their position as a believer
[1:17:44] I know that's simple but you got to
[1:17:46] recognize your position as a Believer
[1:17:49] you're not a doubter you're not a
[1:17:52] skeptic you're not a Critic you're a
[1:17:54] Believer see then in the Book of Romans
[1:17:56] the 10th chapter when you get home you
[1:17:58] get time to read and it's a powerful
[1:18:00] reading you'll read through there and
[1:18:01] see how that Paul will actually rightly
[1:18:03] divide amen between Faith and Hope he'll
[1:18:06] say it like this the prophet he'll say
[1:18:07] now Faith is Burly he said the greatest
[1:18:10] enemy faith is God is Hope amen because
[1:18:12] a person becomes so hopeful till they
[1:18:14] leave away from Faith he said now hope
[1:18:16] will agree with the Bible hope will say
[1:18:18] it's true hope will say I believe every
[1:18:20] bit of it I believe that sword of God I
[1:18:22] believe that God will keep his promise
[1:18:23] hope believes all that but hope then
[1:18:25] says now I believe that God will heal
[1:18:27] but look at my condition
[1:18:30] hope will confess a portion of the word
[1:18:32] but then he'll back up and say well I
[1:18:35] don't know about my condition I don't
[1:18:37] know if God can handle my condition but
[1:18:39] look what the Bible says about Abraham
[1:18:41] it says who against hope believed in
[1:18:44] hope that he might become the father of
[1:18:46] many nations to that which was spoken so
[1:18:48] shall thy seed be the father God said
[1:18:51] when a faith really takes a hold nothing
[1:18:53] else stands now let me say it to you
[1:18:55] like this we are not the recipients of
[1:18:58] Abraham's hope we are the recipients of
[1:19:01] Abraham's Faith we're not Abraham's hope
[1:19:04] seed or Abraham's Faith seed the Bible
[1:19:07] said that he would stand there and he
[1:19:09] would call those things which were not
[1:19:11] as though they were see what Abraham's
[1:19:13] Faith was his faith was more than
[1:19:15] expectation are you hearing me his faith
[1:19:19] was more than just I'm expecting I'm
[1:19:21] expecting I'm expecting I'm hoping I'm
[1:19:23] hoping but his faith actually moved
[1:19:25] under an anointing to become a
[1:19:27] manifestation look in Genesis 18 10 the
[1:19:30] Bible said he said I will certainly
[1:19:31] return unto thee according to the time
[1:19:33] of life and lo Savor thy wife shall have
[1:19:35] a son and Sarah heard in the tent door
[1:19:37] which was behind him now listen Abraham
[1:19:40] and Sarah were old and well-stricken in
[1:19:43] age
[1:19:46] come on now the angel just leaves her
[1:19:49] house and says you're going to have a
[1:19:50] child and Abraham's old and he's well
[1:19:53] stricken and ageless and the rest of
[1:19:54] this amen and it cease to be with Sarah
[1:19:57] after the manner of women so Abraham
[1:20:00] could look and Abraham and Sarah's womb
[1:20:02] was dead her milk veins would dried up
[1:20:04] her hair was gray her face was wrinkled
[1:20:07] his life was gone amen Abraham and
[1:20:09] Sarah's body was in a terrible condition
[1:20:11] but their faith was in good shape
[1:20:15] are you hearing me their body was in a
[1:20:18] terrible condition but their faith was
[1:20:20] in a good shape some of y'all may be
[1:20:22] sitting here tonight Sandra Andrew how
[1:20:24] can things ever turn around how can
[1:20:26] things ever get better I see this and I
[1:20:28] see that and I see this amen but I come
[1:20:30] to tell you get your eyes off the
[1:20:32] condition and get your eyes back on the
[1:20:34] faith of the promise of God I want to
[1:20:37] tell you this your faith is in a lot
[1:20:39] better condition than your conditions
[1:20:40] are
[1:20:43] well I hope that's okay so then what
[1:20:46] faith does and when faith comes in faith
[1:20:49] actually transforms our expectations
[1:20:51] into manifestation look what Paul says
[1:20:54] he should be Earnest Romans 8 19 the
[1:20:56] earnest expectation of the creature is
[1:20:59] waiting for what for the manifestation
[1:21:03] amen of the sons of God remember said if
[1:21:07] you just rely on Hope then You Hinder
[1:21:09] Faith he said hope looks for something
[1:21:11] way off but Faith claims it right now
[1:21:13] see faith says God said so and it's mine
[1:21:16] that settles that I don't care if I'm
[1:21:17] still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm
[1:21:20] still sick back don't have nothing to do
[1:21:22] with it I believe it anyhow it's mine
[1:21:25] right now God said so and that settles
[1:21:28] it see that's Faith but hope says God
[1:21:30] said so I'm expecting to get it someday
[1:21:33] you see I'm expecting someday and as
[1:21:35] long as Satan can put you off to another
[1:21:37] day that's as good as he wants that's
[1:21:39] right you'll never get it just believe
[1:21:41] that you got it right now it's your
[1:21:44] personal property he said Faith acts now
[1:21:47] it's positive so what is creation
[1:21:49] waiting on they are waiting on the
[1:21:51] manifestation of the sons of God I love
[1:21:55] that word manifestation it means to be
[1:21:57] revealed foreign
[1:22:00] they are waiting on the revealing of the
[1:22:03] sons of God it means to disclosure of
[1:22:05] Truth it is concerning things before
[1:22:07] unknown it is used in advance by which
[1:22:10] things are states are persons amen
[1:22:11] hitherto withdrawn from view are made
[1:22:13] visible to all manifestation it is the
[1:22:16] appearance how do you remember a few
[1:22:18] minutes ago when I showed you that there
[1:22:19] was a statue of perfect man what did I
[1:22:21] tell you the foundation of it was
[1:22:23] Faith the foundation of the pyramid was
[1:22:27] Faith adoption number two in the Bible
[1:22:29] we're living in the last days he says
[1:22:31] we're at the top of the pyramid
[1:22:34] the Crawfish is the cancer age and the
[1:22:37] Zodiac in the time of the coming the Leo
[1:22:39] the Lion the captain Stone in the days
[1:22:41] of the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:22:43] in the Bible see where we're at we're
[1:22:45] right at the end time but this is the
[1:22:48] day of the manifestation of the sons of
[1:22:51] God can I reach another adoption part
[1:22:53] four did you know that men that are sons
[1:22:56] of God are amateur Gods how many ever
[1:22:58] know about how many knows Jesus said
[1:22:59] that which God said in Genesis 2 that
[1:23:02] they were Gods because they had full
[1:23:03] domain over Dominion of the world he
[1:23:05] give him dominion over all things he
[1:23:08] lost his godship he lost his sonship he
[1:23:12] lost his domain and Satan took it over
[1:23:14] oh my here we are Satan took it over he
[1:23:17] took over his sonship he took over his
[1:23:19] godship he lost it amen watch this but
[1:23:22] brother we are waiting for the
[1:23:23] manifestations of the sons of God who
[1:23:26] will come back and take it over again
[1:23:28] waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:23:30] the pyramid gets up to the top amen the
[1:23:33] full sons of God will be manifested when
[1:23:36] the power of God will walk out and will
[1:23:38] take every Power that Satan's got away
[1:23:41] from him yes sir it belongs to you among
[1:23:45] church are you hearing me the foundation
[1:23:47] brother Amos that was at the bottom of
[1:23:49] the pyramid would be the same Foundation
[1:23:51] that would return at the top in the
[1:23:54] manifestation of the sons of God and
[1:23:57] they would not be Jesus coming down and
[1:23:59] send Satan take your hands off of God's
[1:24:00] Property but it would be in a five foot
[1:24:02] frail body who would stand on a platform
[1:24:04] and turn this back and say I take every
[1:24:07] spirit in this building under my control
[1:24:09] for the glory of God where was that
[1:24:11] Faith coming from it was coming from the
[1:24:13] restoration of the truth of the word of
[1:24:15] God
[1:24:17] I pray that's just making sense go right
[1:24:20] back to Genesis he said watch for the
[1:24:23] manifestation of the sons of God I love
[1:24:25] this when true Sons
[1:24:28] boy Sons
[1:24:32] true Sons
[1:24:34] born Sons
[1:24:36] field Sons speak
[1:24:42] let me read that again
[1:24:46] true Sons
[1:24:49] born scent
[1:24:51] field sense
[1:24:54] believe
[1:24:56] is that what he said no he said speak
[1:25:01] and their word is backed
[1:25:04] so it's in your heart
[1:25:07] is going to come across your lips
[1:25:09] and when you speak that word there's
[1:25:11] going to be an authority come behind
[1:25:13] that word and he said I believe we're on
[1:25:15] the border of it right now say to this
[1:25:18] mountain let it be so brother I desire
[1:25:20] so and so a certain thing I'm a Believer
[1:25:22] in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the
[1:25:24] name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a
[1:25:26] manifestation oh brother my crop is
[1:25:28] burning up out yonder I haven't had any
[1:25:30] rain I'll see rain in the name of the
[1:25:32] Lord God bless your crop he said what
[1:25:34] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:25:37] sons of God God ordained it at the
[1:25:39] beginning
[1:25:40] then what was at the beginning will
[1:25:43] return at the ending what was in the
[1:25:46] alpha will be in the Omega what was in
[1:25:48] the foundation will be in the Capstone
[1:25:51] now do you realize that Matthew 21 when
[1:25:54] Jesus come around in town how many
[1:25:55] members had
[1:25:57] Jesus come riding into town amen I I
[1:26:00] wonder if I if I could get some water
[1:26:01] would be good Matthew 21 they come
[1:26:04] riding in the town and what were they
[1:26:05] under they was under the expectation of
[1:26:08] the manifested son somebody say son
[1:26:10] s-o-n the manifested son singular they
[1:26:14] were waiting for the the the coming of
[1:26:17] the manifested son singular but in
[1:26:19] Romans 8 the Bible says that we are
[1:26:21] under the manifestation of the
[1:26:22] expectation rather of the manifested
[1:26:24] sons so what was in the sun will be in
[1:26:28] the sons the father God said it is very
[1:26:30] apparent that she ought to be called bad
[1:26:32] for she was predestinated in him came
[1:26:34] from the same Source was eternal with
[1:26:36] him and is now manifesting God in a many
[1:26:41] membered body whereas once God was
[1:26:43] manifested in one member even our Lord
[1:26:46] Jesus Christ amen thank you brother
[1:26:49] amen praise the Lord in a many membered
[1:26:52] body let me say it to you like this he
[1:26:54] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:57] in every way except a Corporal body so
[1:27:00] people say well does he not have a
[1:27:02] Corporal body he does have a Corporal
[1:27:03] body and remember he said all Bible
[1:27:05] Believers believe he will return a
[1:27:08] physical literal Corporal body of Jesus
[1:27:10] Christ but listen to this he said one
[1:27:12] day he's coming back in flesh again he
[1:27:15] said but once Jesus was a God man he
[1:27:17] said now he was part God he was part man
[1:27:19] in one sense and the other he said see
[1:27:21] the lamb was one creature the dove was
[1:27:23] another creature when the Dove and the
[1:27:25] lamb United together God was manifested
[1:27:27] in the flesh that's right and now he's
[1:27:30] manifested in your flesh sure
[1:27:34] by being adopted Sons and Daughters to
[1:27:37] the kingdom of God through the baptism
[1:27:38] of the Holy Spirit that's right you
[1:27:40] become joint heirs with the Lord Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ old church you've got the power
[1:27:45] if you got the faith to use it with
[1:27:47] you've got the power but you've got to
[1:27:49] have faith to use that power with then
[1:27:51] what was the Super sign the super sign
[1:27:53] amen was God manifested in flesh how
[1:27:57] many knows the prophet that God says it
[1:27:58] like this he said there's doors to doors
[1:28:01] in the heart he said there's a door of
[1:28:03] Pride he said there's a door of lust he
[1:28:06] said there's all kinds of doors he said
[1:28:07] rather he said the door of Pride he said
[1:28:09] lust will try to get in there he said
[1:28:11] then there's a Door of Faith he said now
[1:28:13] what will happen he is he said the
[1:28:15] people will let Creeds and traditions
[1:28:17] stand in front of the door of faith and
[1:28:19] will literally bar that door and won't
[1:28:21] let Jesus Christ get in there he said
[1:28:23] because if Jesus got in there he said
[1:28:26] the first thing he would do is he would
[1:28:28] cry out I'm the same yesterday today and
[1:28:31] forever and he said everybody whatever
[1:28:33] he said everything would have to confess
[1:28:35] that's the truth he said but when that
[1:28:37] door is open to Jesus Christ he said
[1:28:40] then you receive Christ's faith in there
[1:28:42] and Christ's Faith recognizes the word
[1:28:46] what are you saying I'm saying that the
[1:28:49] faith of the Son of God has returned in
[1:28:51] the heart of manifested sons of God and
[1:28:54] they are performing The Works of
[1:28:55] almighty God you're not just human
[1:28:58] beings you're not just church members
[1:29:01] you are anointed Messiah
[1:29:04] now can I read this to you I know I'm
[1:29:06] reading a lot but I'm laying some word
[1:29:07] in tonight I pray that's okay Revelation
[1:29:09] 2 13 Jesus says This I Know Thy works
[1:29:13] and we're thou dwellest even where Satan
[1:29:16] said is and now hold as fast my name and
[1:29:20] what it has not denied my faith even in
[1:29:25] those days where an Antipas was a
[1:29:27] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[1:29:29] he said we're Satan dwelleth so in Acts
[1:29:32] the third chapter the 16th verse you
[1:29:34] read that the Bible says in this and his
[1:29:36] name through faith in his name hath made
[1:29:39] this man strong now y'all remember what
[1:29:40] this was there was a man who was lame
[1:29:42] who had been sitting by the gate called
[1:29:44] beautiful right and Peter and John pass
[1:29:47] by him and they didn't have they didn't
[1:29:49] have money they didn't have silver they
[1:29:51] didn't have gold but they perceived that
[1:29:53] they had faith and they said Silver and
[1:29:55] Gold Have I None but such as I have give
[1:29:58] I Thee right and when they said that he
[1:30:02] said immediately he received strength
[1:30:04] stood up on his speed and ran into
[1:30:06] Solomon's porch rejoicing not when that
[1:30:08] man done that it caused quite a stir
[1:30:12] I mean he was a church disturber
[1:30:15] I mean it cost a big stir and look what
[1:30:18] it says in Acts 3 16 it says the faith
[1:30:21] which is by him hath given him this
[1:30:23] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:30:26] all I love how Brethren picks this up in
[1:30:28] the church age book he said when Peter
[1:30:29] was asked how the mighty Miracle had
[1:30:31] taken place up on the once again
[1:30:33] a beautiful he explained it on this wise
[1:30:35] and his Jesus name through faith in his
[1:30:38] Jesus name hath made this man a formal
[1:30:41] strong yea the faith which is by
[1:30:44] from him Jesus hath given him the man
[1:30:47] this perfect soundness in the presence
[1:30:49] of you all
[1:30:51] are you ready for this see there it is
[1:30:55] Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about
[1:30:58] the miracle Peter did not claim it was
[1:31:01] his own human Faith any more than he
[1:31:03] claimed it was his own human name he
[1:31:05] said that Jesus name used in the faith
[1:31:06] which is from Jesus performed that great
[1:31:08] work this faith is what the Lord was
[1:31:11] speaking about in Revelation 2 13 it was
[1:31:14] his faith it was not faith in him but it
[1:31:17] was his own faith he had given to the
[1:31:19] Believers oh God
[1:31:22] Romans 12 3 says the corner has got to
[1:31:24] dealt to every man notice this The
[1:31:26] Measure of Faith in the pergamian church
[1:31:28] age they were humanized and salvation
[1:31:30] haven't turned from the truth that
[1:31:32] salvation is of the Lord having cast
[1:31:34] aside the doctor of election and opened
[1:31:36] wide the church door and their
[1:31:37] Fellowship to any and all who subscribed
[1:31:39] to their tenants never mind the word but
[1:31:42] in this age of Rapid degradation I'm
[1:31:44] closing here in a minute there will
[1:31:46] still the few who had the measure of
[1:31:48] that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:31:51] not only use that faith in Acts of power
[1:31:53] but withstood those who dared to say
[1:31:56] that they were saved simply on the
[1:31:58] grounds of joining a church they knew
[1:32:00] that no man could truly believe unto
[1:32:01] eternal life and the righteousness of
[1:32:03] God apart from the measure of the faith
[1:32:05] of the Lord Jesus himself as today
[1:32:07] church is filled with mental believers
[1:32:09] who endorse the Virgin birth the shed
[1:32:11] blood going to church taking communion
[1:32:13] and are not reborn at all even so on
[1:32:15] that third age was the same problem
[1:32:17] listen human Faith wasn't enough in and
[1:32:20] it's not enough now it takes the very
[1:32:22] Faith to the Son of God Amen to drop
[1:32:25] into a man's heart so that he can
[1:32:27] receive the Lord Of Glory into the
[1:32:28] temple not made with hands this was a
[1:32:31] living faith this was the same faith
[1:32:34] that Paul said I live by the faith of
[1:32:36] the Son of God Paul did not say that he
[1:32:38] lived by faith in the Son of God it was
[1:32:40] the faith of the Son of God they had
[1:32:41] given him life and kept him living a
[1:32:43] Christian Victory no they had not denied
[1:32:45] salvation or Supernatural from start to
[1:32:47] finish they kept alive the truth of his
[1:32:49] name and his faith and they were blessed
[1:32:51] by the Lord and accounted Worthy of him
[1:32:57] Jesus name
[1:33:00] are you awake
[1:33:02] Jesus name
[1:33:04] Jesus faith
[1:33:06] comes together at the top of the pyramid
[1:33:10] the same faith
[1:33:13] in a manifested adopted Sons and
[1:33:16] Daughters of God listen friends we're
[1:33:18] not looking back at what used to happen
[1:33:21] there's people sitting right here
[1:33:23] tonight with Jesus faith Jesus name
[1:33:27] and they're seeing Jesus's miracles
[1:33:31] performed every day
[1:33:35] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:33:38] the faith of God
[1:33:40] is back
[1:33:42] in the Earth today
[1:33:45] your faith
[1:33:48] can stop God
[1:33:50] your faith
[1:33:52] can speak and squirrels come into
[1:33:54] existence
[1:33:55] your faith
[1:33:57] can stand to look at a storm and say go
[1:34:00] back and let the sunshine
[1:34:02] are you hearing me
[1:34:04] the faith
[1:34:05] of an insignificant beggar
[1:34:08] 200 yards away from Jesus
[1:34:11] walk into Jerusalem
[1:34:13] ignoring the criticism
[1:34:15] ignoring the naysayers
[1:34:18] doing the father's business
[1:34:20] felt a pool
[1:34:22] from an insignificant blind man
[1:34:25] and he turns and he says why bring him
[1:34:29] here
[1:34:30] why why should we bring him there Lord I
[1:34:33] perceive I've been touched by something
[1:34:37] can I propose it to you like this that's
[1:34:40] the faith that was in the shoot em out
[1:34:42] woman
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:44] can I say it to you like this that's the
[1:34:46] faith that was in the woman in Memphis
[1:34:53] an insignificant remember I said a
[1:34:55] little insignificant black lady in the
[1:34:57] ghettos of Memphis
[1:35:00] walked in there and saw her boy laying
[1:35:02] there dine
[1:35:03] and went back to the Bible and said God
[1:35:06] this is my son you gave him to me and
[1:35:09] eyes is like that shoot them out woman
[1:35:11] okay
[1:35:13] I'm like that shoot him out woman Lord
[1:35:15] here's the sick boy on his deathbed
[1:35:17] here's your word but where is your
[1:35:19] Elijah
[1:35:20] he said something moved her to the
[1:35:23] outside of her house and she went and
[1:35:26] stood against the post now I I pray it's
[1:35:29] okay to share this it's not been
[1:35:31] confirmed okay it's just been it's been
[1:35:33] told me several times actually in
[1:35:35] Memphis right now if you go look I've
[1:35:37] tried to I've tried to confirm it but I
[1:35:38] can't really but I think it's a good
[1:35:40] point to make if it's really confirmable
[1:35:41] we'll confirm it one day in Memphis
[1:35:43] there is a pyramid Bass Pro Shop it is
[1:35:47] said to believe that we're that pyramid
[1:35:49] sets today is where that woman's house
[1:35:52] was when brother Brandon walked by now
[1:35:54] if you go look at it according to GPS
[1:35:56] it's really not that far away from the
[1:35:58] airport again it's not been confirmed
[1:36:00] but I can't help believe brother Sean if
[1:36:02] there's not something significant about
[1:36:03] that she stands out there against that
[1:36:06] against that that mailbox that fence
[1:36:08] post and remember said here I am flying
[1:36:11] home and all of a sudden there comes an
[1:36:13] announcement we gotta land the plane
[1:36:15] Rick I'm getting ready to land this one
[1:36:17] okay we've got to land the plane amen
[1:36:19] you realize on that plane was
[1:36:21] businessman was important people was
[1:36:24] people of renowned but there was a woman
[1:36:26] on the earth
[1:36:29] whose Faith was stronger than any CEO of
[1:36:32] any company on that plane her faith was
[1:36:34] stronger than any important businessman
[1:36:36] or accountant on that plane and all of a
[1:36:38] sudden the plane ride's going smooth
[1:36:40] there's no issues everybody's doing good
[1:36:43] and all of a sudden the light comes on
[1:36:44] and the captain looks at the co-pilot
[1:36:46] and says what does that mean he gets the
[1:36:48] manual out he says it means ground the
[1:36:50] plane right now isn't it strange they
[1:36:53] didn't ground it 100 miles away they
[1:36:54] didn't ground it 200 miles away they
[1:36:56] grounded it right where the face of that
[1:36:58] woman was crying out for the god of the
[1:37:01] Bible to come by her way and confirm a
[1:37:03] promise come on now remember he said
[1:37:07] they put me up in that Peabody Hotel
[1:37:08] right he said I got up there in that
[1:37:10] Peabody Hotel he said next morning went
[1:37:12] out to mail some letters he said as I
[1:37:14] was going down the road I was singing
[1:37:16] I'm one of them said just met up with
[1:37:18] you Pentecostal people the other day I'm
[1:37:20] one of them he said I realized I've
[1:37:22] mailed all the letters for the Amos it
[1:37:24] was time to turn and go back but there
[1:37:27] was a voice of Faith there was a pool of
[1:37:29] Faith there was a cry of faith brother
[1:37:31] to him that was saying I got a boy
[1:37:33] that's dying I got a boy that's on his
[1:37:35] way to hell if God don't intervene
[1:37:38] and the insignificant faith of that
[1:37:40] woman kept on pulling Elijah against his
[1:37:43] own scientific understanding I got to
[1:37:45] get back the plane's going to leave I
[1:37:47] got to get back but he said I kept on
[1:37:48] following the leading to the Holy Spirit
[1:37:50] and he said all of a sudden I walked
[1:37:52] down into a neighborhood and there was a
[1:37:54] woman and she looked at me and said
[1:37:56] morning person he said I tipped my hat
[1:37:58] and said wait a second how did you know
[1:38:00] I was a person
[1:38:02] how did you know I was a person she said
[1:38:04] I've been waiting on you I've been
[1:38:07] waiting on you do you see what happened
[1:38:09] the faith of that woman got in touch
[1:38:11] with the faith of almighty God and it
[1:38:13] got in touch with his prophet and that
[1:38:15] insignificant woman's Faith landed a
[1:38:17] plane
[1:38:20] oh God these things are too rich to
[1:38:23] think about sometimes landed that plane
[1:38:25] and he said I'll walk there and she said
[1:38:27] listen God give me a boy and he's gone
[1:38:30] away from God and he's laying in there
[1:38:32] dying would you come in and pray for him
[1:38:34] she said he said yes I will he said I
[1:38:36] walked in that little Shanty he said
[1:38:38] I've been in King's palaces he said
[1:38:40] never felt more welcome in all of my
[1:38:42] life foreign
[1:38:45] walk in there and say do you know who I
[1:38:47] am
[1:38:48] I'm William Branham I'm Elijah I prayed
[1:38:51] for thousands but he walked in there and
[1:38:54] he said ma'am he said how about you pray
[1:38:56] first

[1:39:01] laying there moaning and groaning and
[1:39:03] saying oh it's getting dark oh it's
[1:39:06] getting dark oh it's getting dark he
[1:39:09] said all of a sudden that woman began to
[1:39:10] pray he said by the time she got done
[1:39:12] praying I knowed she had talked to God
[1:39:15] before he said she got done praying I
[1:39:17] said a prayer and said by the time I got
[1:39:19] done praying that boy started saying oh

[1:39:25] it's getting light in here he said what
[1:39:27] happened he said I left there he said I

[1:39:31] airport he said I just knew when I
[1:39:33] walked in I'd miss my flight he said but
[1:39:35] as soon as I stepped in the door they
[1:39:37] said last call

[1:39:42] said and I got on my flight he said in
[1:39:44] two years later standing in a train
[1:39:46] station a boy come up to me and said sir
[1:39:49] you don't remember me but I remember you
[1:39:51] my Mama Prayed and you come by our house
[1:39:53] and you prayed over me and God healed me
[1:39:55] and listen he didn't just heal my body
[1:39:57] but he saved my soul and the father God
[1:40:00] said see that is the benefit of form the
[1:40:03] leadership of the Holy Ghost then I say
[1:40:05] Faith Tabernacle why don't we live up to
[1:40:07] our name unless the faith of God Amen
[1:40:09] drop into our hearts unless the face of
[1:40:11] God speak across our lips and confess
[1:40:13] the promise of God's word and no matter
[1:40:15] how dark ugly cold it gets we'll speak
[1:40:18] the word and we'll confess the promise
[1:40:20] and we'll move forward let our musicians
[1:40:22] come tonight
[1:40:23] [Applause]
[1:40:26] the faith of God
[1:40:28] has connected in the heart
[1:40:31] and the heart and the mouth
[1:40:33] had been connected
[1:40:35] and now there's a bride
[1:40:37] manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[1:40:40] confessing the word
[1:40:42] with authority
[1:40:47] brother Andrew
[1:40:49] well that mountain moved
[1:40:52] well that mountain move
[1:40:55] can I tell you what a prophet said
[1:40:57] he said there's no more guesswork
[1:41:04] can I just tell you what he said
[1:41:07] he said I want you to get this now the
[1:41:08] church has got to lift itself from the
[1:41:09] power of God we are too close to the end
[1:41:12] I believe the church is in condition
[1:41:14] where we can teach a little deeper
[1:41:15] things
[1:41:16] and rub some of this make-believe out
[1:41:18] see and get into something real
[1:41:19] something that you know
[1:41:21] and if you say brother random that isn't
[1:41:23] the light yeah I know it's the light how
[1:41:25] do you know it's a lot I'm looking at
[1:41:26] how well how do you know that couldn't
[1:41:28] be wrong my sight has always declared to
[1:41:30] me that was lightsy
[1:41:32] and that's the reason I believe in those
[1:41:34] visions
[1:41:35] because it's always declared to me the
[1:41:37] truth
[1:41:38] because it comes from the word
[1:41:41] then if he says it that settles it now
[1:41:44] when it's declared like that there's no
[1:41:46] more guesswork
[1:41:48] it's going to be
[1:41:51] then you hear it thus saith the Lord see
[1:41:53] because it's beyond the human thinking
[1:41:58] it's up into the Realms of the Lord's
[1:42:00] thinking
[1:42:01] but you're standing here just as a
[1:42:02] branch producing the fruit that's in the
[1:42:04] vine and see God uses man and man only
[1:42:07] what are you saying I'm saying what a
[1:42:09] prophet said there's no more guesswork
[1:42:12] in it
[1:42:13] somebody might say brother Andrew what
[1:42:14] is guesswork it's the process of trying
[1:42:16] to guess or estimate something without
[1:42:18] knowing all the facts for information
[1:42:20] can I tell you some other words for
[1:42:21] guesswork guessing
[1:42:24] uh Superstition assumption perception
[1:42:28] suspicion speculation hypothesia
[1:42:31] theorizing prediction expectation
[1:42:33] approximations rough calculations
[1:42:35] feelings hunches guesstimates
[1:42:37] perfect faith
[1:42:39] has removed every one of them
[1:42:41] and the prophet said there's no more
[1:42:43] guesswork in it
[1:42:44] we find the faith of God
[1:42:47] is in the church once you stand your
[1:42:49] feet with us this evening
[1:42:53] do you love the Lord
[1:42:56] how many can say Lord
[1:42:58] thank God we've made it to the top of
[1:43:00] this pyramid
[1:43:04] thank God we made it
[1:43:06] to the top of this pyramid
[1:43:09] thank God we've moved
[1:43:11] and we're built upon the foundation
[1:43:14] thank God we're built upon the
[1:43:16] foundation
[1:43:18] the foundation of faith
[1:43:20] and what was manifested by the Bob at
[1:43:22] the bottom
[1:43:23] is being manifested
[1:43:25] at the top
[1:43:27] I know I've shared this testimony here
[1:43:29] but I just feel led to share it again is
[1:43:31] meeting like this one day out and same
[1:43:33] at Browning's church I was preaching got
[1:43:34] to preaching along these lines about
[1:43:35] manifest adopted Sons
[1:43:38] and I said God's faith is in your heart

[1:43:42] speak the word

[1:43:46] I said you got the right to fire the
[1:43:47] devil tonight

[1:43:54] son-in-law and he had been suffering in
[1:43:56] his shoulder and his going through
[1:43:58] therapy and stuff and he had to show
[1:44:00] that shoulder problem and I said you got
[1:44:01] a right to fire that devil and when I
[1:44:04] said that I didn't know what he's going
[1:44:05] through he spoke out and said I fired
[1:44:07] the demon of shoulder pain

[1:44:28] listen friends whatever mountain is
[1:44:30] before you tonight

[1:46:09] tonight that the devil has paralyzed
[1:46:11] their vocal cords
[1:46:13] he's paralyzed their voice Lord and it's
[1:46:14] been years since they actually
[1:46:17] took the word into their heart and
[1:46:19] placed it up on their lips from their
[1:46:21] heart Dear God
[1:46:22] [Music]

[1:57:38] that away from you now you know we've
[1:57:40] got as Jesus said you know there's that
[1:57:43] four kinds of grounds and one of them
[1:57:46] grounds you know is when he when they
[1:57:48] went to trials it went through uh hard
[1:57:51] times in that and Satan was able to take
[1:57:53] that word away from him you know then
[1:57:55] the cares of life and all that took the
[1:57:58] word away from them but then there was
[1:58:00] that ground that was fertile a man that
[1:58:02] would not that's if Satan could not take
[1:58:05] that seed away can you say man could not
[1:58:09] take that seat away and they produced a
[1:58:11] hundredfold amen so we're we're that
[1:58:15] we're that people that's producing a
[1:58:17] hundredfold amen and so amen
[1:58:21] praise the Lord amen so uh it's it's

[1:59:18] we had good Services there at brother
[1:59:21] Josh
[1:59:22] Bennetts and pray that we were a a
[1:59:26] blessing there and
[1:59:29] we want to remember this Sunday
[1:59:33] uh uh instead of having one service
[1:59:37] we're going to have two and uh it's
[1:59:40] going to the morning service be at 10
[1:59:42] evening regular time at four and uh
[1:59:46] being it's the Thanksgiving that really
[1:59:50] that snuck up on us fast and knew it was
[1:59:53] coming I just didn't know
[1:59:55] how soon but um so
[1:59:59] um we usually have
[2:00:01] um Sunday night before Thanksgiving we
[2:00:03] usually have testimony in song and uh so
[2:00:08] that that's what we're going to be
[2:00:09] having uh Sunday night is uh testimonies
[2:00:13] if you got a testimony of what the Lord
[2:00:15] done for you this year uh we we would
[2:00:19] love to hear hear about it and if you
[2:00:22] got a song we want you to sing it and uh
[2:00:26] we always just it's just a good time and
[2:00:30] so uh if if you're able to come we would
[2:00:34] certainly enjoy that amen and so
[2:00:39] um
[2:00:40] trying to think here
[2:00:42] um Wednesday night next Wednesday night
[2:00:45] Thanksgiving Eve we will not be having
[2:00:47] service
[2:00:48] so we want to remember that and and then
[2:00:54] um
[2:00:55] don't want to put too much on you but
[2:00:57] we'll I'll have sister Martha to send it
[2:01:00] out as well but then the following
[2:01:02] Sunday after Thanksgiving we'll just
[2:01:05] have one service at 11. and so just keep
[2:01:09] that in mind but uh but as for now we'll

[2:01:23] invite your friends to come amen and I
[2:01:28] had heard that
[2:01:30] a young lady and her husband was here
[2:01:33] last Sunday and we want to keep them in
[2:01:36] prayer brother Kevin I had spoke to the
[2:01:40] young lady
[2:01:41] at on the job site actually it was
[2:01:44] pretty pretty early huh and uh it's
[2:01:47] actually it was actually dark uh uh and
[2:01:51] he was just by himself on the job in his
[2:01:54] van and waiting you know for uh I don't
[2:01:57] know to get lighter get and get
[2:01:59] motivation to get out you know I don't
[2:02:01] know uh but uh I just say it was the
[2:02:06] Lord that kept him there but uh he uh
[2:02:09] pitched dark and and he knocked on the
[2:02:12] on the window and uh it would have
[2:02:15] scared me and uh but he rolled down the
[2:02:18] window and there's this lady uh there
[2:02:21] and I I don't know the whole
[2:02:23] conversation he could tell you more
[2:02:25] about it but yeah she told him she said
[2:02:28] something woke me up and told me to walk
[2:02:31] down here she says I'm needing I'm
[2:02:33] needing help and
