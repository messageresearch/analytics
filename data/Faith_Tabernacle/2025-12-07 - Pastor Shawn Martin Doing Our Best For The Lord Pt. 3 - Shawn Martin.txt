But uh we want to keep Brother John Weekes in our prayers. Um he goes in for surgery on Wednesday to have his pacemaker uh replaced. So let's just keep him in our prayers. Um also um Sister Hope put in a request this morning.

Uh so we want to keep uh the the the father and the family in our prayers. Amen. Uh the mom and and brother are distraught in need of our prayers this morning. So let's just remember them. And also uh grandma uh is in our need of our prayers. They found a spot where the cancer used to be and they don't know what it is yet. Um, so there the doctors think it might be cancer again, but they're going to try to run some tests and just see. So, let's just pray that the Lord would just be with her and dissolve that spot. Amen. And we want to uh remember Sister Martha, Sister Kim Weekes, and um, Sister Janice, and um, all of them in our prayers this morning. Amen. How many has an unspoken request by lift your hands? Man, the Lord sees every need this morning. And let's remember our pastor that the Lord would just move in a special way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said uh by this shall all men know that you're my disciples that you have love one for another. And one way to express that love is to pray for the people that we have uh been mentioned here this morning. Uh we've got another request here and I have brought this name up here before. Uh brother Leonard Seismore. He's been a pastor over in West Virginia for many years. I'll just read what his wife uh has sent me and I asked for an abbreviated version but this is what she sent me and it's got an update or two with it. She says, "My husband, brother Leonard Sismore from United States has been given a diagnosis of mystic brain cancer. The reason it is considered mystic is because the brain only produces one tumor of original brain cancer. If your test shows multiple tumors on your brain, then your cancer has traveled from a different organ and attached itself to your brain." According to what was told us at the West Virginia University Thomas Memorial Hospital in Charleston, original brain cancer will always only have one tumor. In the event there are more than one tumor on the brain, it's not true brain cancer, but cancer has dissected and travel from a different organ. At this time, at least four tumors can be seen on brother Leonard's brain, which tells us he does not have brain cancer, but some other cancer that has made its way to his brain. He has a PET schedule in the early part of January done in our patient clinic, outpatient clinic that should tell us exactly where the main mother tumor is hidden at. Regardless of the original source, Leonard has made the decision along with mine and our two daughters to not forego any treatment for the affected organs. It would either be it would be either chemo or radiation therapy. For the brain, he would have to have a needle biopsy through his skull and one of the tumors to retrieve a sample. Leonard is 80 years old. He only has 40% lung function from his work on strip mines. He has a pacemaker and has aphib. We both agree that when his time comes to leave this earthly home, an earthly body, he will step into that beautified body we are promised by our savior. Thank you so much very much for your prayers. An update. Leonard got a diagnosis of mastic brain cancer that has traveled to his brain from another organ. And she goes on to say there's four tumors on his brain, but with all the test scans, MRIs, biopsies, they could not tell us where the cancer traveled from to his brain. His power of concentration is extremely poor. If he tries to read the scripture, he has to read it several times to remember what he has read. and uh mind that add he has pastored a church over there in near Pineville, West Virginia uh for many many years and uh he's represented this message and uh so let's just if you would I met the brother already I actually spoke from their pulpit over there one time and u they're fine people but he's really needing a touch of God whatever the Lord's will would be but we're going to pray for his healing as well as the rest of these request us. God is a problem solver. I'm glad he's a I know he's a problem solver cuz he solved many of mine. I was one of his biggest problems. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He solved my problem. Amen. So, let's remember these requests. I know there's a whole lot to read there, but so we understand what's going on there and these other requests. This explosion, this loved one that's passed away and the others in emergency uh situation. But let's look to the Lord in prayer. Our gracious God, this morning, Lord, as we all join our hearts together in prayer, we come before you knowing that you're the great high priest of our confession, ever interceding for us. Lord, each and every one of us, you intercede for, Lord. You intercede for your children through their good times and through the bad times, through their weaknesses, through their strengths. Oh God. Lord, there's some of us that have been blessed in different ways. And then some of us, Lord, we have to compensate, Lord, through other means, God. Maybe we don't have a strong body, Lord, like somebody else. Or we've been afflicted or some tumor, some cancer, some some sort of illness or arthritis or some sort of devil, a spot has been found on this sister, Lord God. And Lord Jesus, God, you know about these things. And we know these bodies are temporary homes, God. We don't We know that we can't take away the wrinkles. We know we can't take away the the the bone joint, Lord, that material that seems to evaporate, Lord, out of them joints. But God, we know that healing is still the children's bread. You promise that our yoke would be easy and our burden would be light. And God, sometimes a body, we know that the devil attacks his vulnerability, Lord, because of the fallenness, Lord, that it is in the state it's in. Lord, Satan just he ways, Benny. God, we're not giving him any credit, but we know he's got that punch coming. But Lord, help us TO REALIZE THAT WE'VE ALSO GOT A PUNCH we can deliver back to the devil with the sword, which is a word. And father God, the word is in our lips and it's nigh us. And dear God, we know that you are you bore us our stripes for our healing so that we could serve you better in this body. We don't ask for Lord, we are asking for a body change and we know that at the appropriate time that will come, that will happen. But God, until that time, may you give us strength and healing in our body. When we think of this brother, pastor, brother Leonard over there that's served this church, oh God, for many years, Lord, he's worked in the coal mines. And Lord, only 40% of his lungs is is working, oh God. And Lord, he's fighting this tumor now. And I think Lord when I went with him Lord to the last time I seen him to visit that neighbor down the street that he took the church age book down there Lord and he was witnessing to him about the message and instructing him in the in the word. Oh God I pray Lord Jesus you remember all of his labors Lord. God, we just ask you'd move. And Lord, the the word was this morning, they can't even have service because brother Leonard's not in the shape that he should be in. Father God, to have service, God, we pray you'd be with that little church, Lord. And all the other churches, Lord, a church in Pennsylvania, church out there, Brother Marty Mccomomas, Lord, without a pastor now, Lord, another one in North Carolina and here and there. There's a bunch of them, dear God, that need pastors. Lord, it's just the same thing. Lord, you didn't bring a disjointed body. You didn't bring a freak body. Lord, if there's a true assembly somewhere, dear God, there's a pastor for it. Bottom line and the story, that's your word. You promise that God, you promise to raise up five-fold ministry, evangelist, pastors. Dear God, may you raise them up. We pray with each and every request this morning. Lord, bless our pastor as he comes to minister the word of God. May we have receptive hearts and ears to hear the word of the Lord. May it be come. May our revelation to open all our hearts to revelation. Lord, enlighten our eyes. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. We give you thanks and glory. Prayer request that was read Wednesday night.

The devil, you know, devil devil won't show me. Oh, you still got that temper, but forgive me. I may not have much money and my health is not the best. And when trials come against me, I don't always pass the tests. But when I stop and count my blessings, I couldn't ask for more. For everywhere I look, dear Lord, there's something to thank you for.

Amen. We're living in a rough world today. And uh Satan is he's not just he's no uh respector of age. And uh but we're just going to ask God's blessings upon this little little guy. Amen. Father, Lord, we've been just so glad that you have blessed brother Branson and Sister Anne and their home with this lovely child. Father, children are a blessing to us, Lord. And this is a commandment, a desire, Lord, from you that we would have children and that we would raise them in the fear of you. Now, Father, we're just asking that you would touch this child, Lord, and be with him, Lord, through the years, Lord, when he grows up, Father, that your presence would always be near him, Father, that you would direct his feet. Lord, into the paths of righteousness. Father, we know that Satan is lurking, Father. There's so many enticements in the world to draw children today. That Father, we're asking that you would keep him and bless him. Father, may he know you and experience you at an early age. Father, is our prayer. and may he commit his life to you as he grows. I pray that you would give brother Branson, Sister Anne, the wisdom, Father, uh, on how to raise a child, Father. There's going to be times of perplexity. There's times when they ain't going to know what to do. But, Father, may they hold to your hand. May they Lord look to you and seek your guidance and your word Father. And Lord I know Father that you will you will answer their prayer. Father unite them all together. Make them one and may they be one with you. May you be the center of their home, their life and everything that they do. We ask it, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. Praise the Lord.

Well, do you love the Lord? Amen. Praise the Lord. I wasn't able to bring my iPad. So, we're going to use my laptop, but we could stand to our feet. Amen. and um enjoyed the uh the songs and the worship today. Praise the Lord. And I hear it is Brother Terry and Sister Alice's 52nd anniversary today. Well, God bless you all. Amen. Praise the Lord. We uh certainly love brother Terry and sister Alice and they have been a blessing to us uh through the years. They've been coming and um just good to see that God's blessed their life together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um so we also want to remember brother Wayne will be here with us coming up here in a couple weeks I guess week and a half uh but um uh on the 19th through the 21st uh Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And so, uh, looking forward to what God has in store, uh, for us and, um, just encourage you to be praying, uh, for the services and God would just speak to our hearts. Amen. In a special way. Uh, if you have your Bibles, we're going to turn first of all to the book of Matthew, uh, the 9th chapter. Matthew the 9th chapter. We read this verse um last Wednesday and I think last Sunday as well, but so um Matthew 9 and we'll start at the 35th verse. And Jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest. Amen. Then if you'll turn the book of John the uh 15th chapter in John chapter 15 we'll read a few verses here Jesus saying I am starting at the first verse I am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in He that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, um that he may bring forth more fruit. Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide me. I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit. For without me, you can do nothing. Can you repeat that? For without me, you can do nothing. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, we're so thankful for the opportunity be gathered together, Lord. Not just a gathering, but we're gathered around your word. This place has been set aside not for games and and activities, Lord, but it's it's been set aside that we could come and hear your word and hear what you would have to say to us that we could draw strength and find help in time of need. Father, we're so thankful that we have a place to come to. And we're just asking now, Lord, that you would speak to our hearts. Father, anoint me, Father, as I would yield myself to thee. And Lord, that you may have your way and speak me to your people. And I pray that you would help the people just to surrender themselves, Lord, and get themselves out of the way, Lord, that your word could have preeminence. Any spirit that would try to hinder the service, may you drive it away, Lord, and may your word have the freedom here this morning. Any sick among us, may you heal them. any bondages, Lord, that the people may be in, I pray you deliver them. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You can have your seats this morning. I uh again want to just take the simple thought of uh doing our best uh for the Lord. And um you know I I consider it a real honor, amen, to be able to do something uh for the Lord to work for the kingdom of God. And it has, of course, I was uh raised in church, but it was always my uh desire uh to do something for God, &gt;&gt; to to to work for God. and um and I'm I'm glad that um he chose me to do something. It's it's it's very humbling and I I really think we all feel that way. Uh is is I think every believer wants to do something for the Lord and um in whatever way it would be and and so um whatever it is as we have talked about uh we want to do our best. Um, we're living in a an age uh where it was uh prophesied uh there in Revelations the 3 chapter speaking of this Leoysian age that that people would be lukewarm. They would uh be neither hot nor cold but lukewarm. They'd be complacent. So they'd be Christian, claim Christianity, but yet be worldly at the same time. Have one foot in the church, one foot out in the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so they wouldn't really be on fire for God. And so this is the challenge that we have being that it is the spirit of the age that we're living in is Satan would love to get us complacent. He would love to get us to where we're just mediocre Christians and, you know, and and to where church becomes more of an entertainment to us than anything else. And and we're not here to be entertained. &gt;&gt; Uh God didn't call us or save us that we could be entertained and make a church uh a showmanship. Uh but he's called us that we could do something for him and to be the best and and that means putting our whole soul, mind, our heart, uh everything that we are into it. And we we should invest our strength, our energy, our time. We should invest everything that we have uh in into the kingdom of God. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I look back at, you know, in the Bible and reading of the characters in the Bible and how they invested their time and their energy and you read the Fox's book of martyrs and uh other books of history of of the early church down through the ages and how they they took Christianity seriously. uh um they they were real Christians and they they gladly stood up for the cause of Christ. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But we think of this uh you know we we know that God wants to use the church. Uh the church is his body and so uh um uh we are his hands, we are his feet, we are his mouthpiece. Uh uh we are it. I mean you know as as we we know that uh you've not seen me. I've not seen you. You see my body. &gt;&gt; I'm living in my body. &gt;&gt; I and and you're living in your body. And so we fellowship through the body. We I'm able to speak through my body. I'm able to use my hands and and and these things. But when I leave, my body stays and it'll go in the ground. Uh unless I'm uh unless we, you know, uh are here when the rapture takes place. But if God were to take me home today, I would leave and and go into another body and yet the the this body would just be laying dormant and and would have to be buried. Uh so the body declares life. It declares my presence and and I know you're here because your body's here and and I I hear you sing and and see you moving and and so then then I know that you're you're living in that body. And so when the Bible says that we are the body of Jesus Christ, then we don't have to wonder where where he's at. If Christ can reflect himself through his body, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and and so uh God takes this body because he redeemed me. He takes your body because he redeemed you. &gt;&gt; He saved you. He He sanctified you. And then he fills you with the Holy Ghost, his own life, his own spirit. Ain't that right? Amen. and and he does that uh to do a work in you. And so now God's ways are totally opposite from man's ways. man, when he looks uh when he wants to use somebody um if if u if I'm going, you know, if I've got a job and and I'm and and I want to hire somebody uh to work for me and I want to use his his skills and all that, I want the best. I I I want the best that I can get. you know, I thinking of, you know, our president and uh uh you know, he's he's he wants the smartest, the brightest, you know, and that's all he hangs around with is is he loves smart people, you know, and he wants abled people and and if you're going to work for him, he he wants the best and and the most skilled and and the the most perfect uh that you can be. He demands that. He requires that. and and and well, we we should we we should want the best. If if you're going to hire someone, you're going to want someone to to really do the work, build your name up and build your your business up and and all of these things. But the when when God uses people, he goes opposite. It's it's kind of uh uh amazing, but he uses people that are full of weaknesses. Yes, &gt;&gt; he uses people that that aren't able. &gt;&gt; Amen. He uses people that ain't really got the skill uh and and the ability and and and so uh you you would think that would be degrading on his name. You think it would be degrading on his part to to choose people that have no ability that that are in their weak weaknesses and and all of that. So I want to say this. You don't have to pretend to be something great for the Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a great resume to be used of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you don't have to present your best in the in the sense of of of of a list of accomplishments that you've done. And and hopefully God will hire you. Hopefully God will use you for his kingdom. You don't have to have great credentials for God to use you. Uh the prophet said there's so many of us likes to testify or likes to think that we're insufficient and therefore we make that an excuse. Well, I have no education. I have no ability. I'm unable to do this or to do that. And if you keep that up and do that in that way, keep going like that, then you can't mount to anything. But the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses, God uses that to tackle the very job with. Tackle the job with. He waits for us to get to that condition so that he can use us. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, we take the excuses and we say, "Well, I I I can't do this and I'm I'm insufficient and I'm this." And God takes that very thing to do the job with. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So it it's it's an opposite of of how that God works contrary uh to the way we do. We want to be our best. We want to we we go to school to achieve and to become smarter and and and and the more we know, Amen, the better job we have, the better income we can make and and all of these things. But when it comes to God, the weaker you are, the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And and so one of the reasons why we we come to church is to learn our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Not learn our strengths, but learn our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; And and you know that that we the prophet said we come to learn our faults. Not not so we can be condemned but that we might know how to better ourselves. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And sometimes our faults is our abilities. &gt;&gt; Sometimes our faults is our own strengths. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Because we lean to ourselves. We lean to our own understanding. We lean to what we can do instead of letting God do the work. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we we find that uh uh if we come to church for any other reason than this, the prophet says, "I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church. We must come to find our weaknesses, &gt;&gt; find our bad places, and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I'm just going to take my time for a few minutes now. Now, he says, you know, I I'll admit that people study too much and try to go too far ahead and and try to think too hard and sometimes they have mental breakdowns and things on account of studying about the Lord. You see that all the time. You got so many books out there and and uh written and commentaries and and different ideas of uh people they spend a lifetime trying to study about God, get to know more about God and and yet it does not bring them to more of a reality to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just a knowledge of God. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And and so he he says now he said, "But you must quit that. You don't have to do that. The only thing you have to do is fall in love with him and just go right on loving him. Ain't that right? It's not trying to push into something or make yourself something that you're not. &gt;&gt; Remember, we talked about being impersonated. We don't want to be impersonators. We don't want to claim something that we're not. Can you say amen? Amen. Uh uh so it's not trying to make yourself self something you're not. Just go ahead and let God use you the way he wants to use you. &gt;&gt; Just yield yourself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Just yield yourself. See, commit yourself. Walk on happy, singing, rejoicing. Can you say amen? So, it's not trying to learn about God. It's not PUSHING OURSELVES INTO SOMETHING that we're not. Just let go and let God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, God uh chooses us because we are not not because we're strong, but because we're in a condition of weakness. &gt;&gt; We don't like weakness. Man don't like weakness. We try to cover up our weaknesses. If there's anything, we're going to show our strengths, not our weaknesses. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We we'll go hide somewhere and and and show our weaknesses there when no one's around. But when we're around, we want to be bad, you know, tough and and strong and and all of these things. See, BUT GOD TAKES our weaknesses and and you'll see that throughout the Bible. Amen. We find people who are the weakest and the rejected by the outside world. And yet they're God's heroes. &gt;&gt; People that are weak, people that are rejected by the world, they are God's heroes that conquer up in the front line takes those who uh feel themselves unworthy. Ain't that right? So then why would God take a man that is is weak and and uh um DOESN'T REQUIRE ability from a man is because he God says it and I believe Isaiah that he says I will share my glory with no man. &gt;&gt; God ain't going to share his glory with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. I God didn't choose me to preach because I'm a talented preacher. &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it. I I'd just be honest. I' I've thought of our prophet and and you know night after night that that uh you know he would stand there preaching and and there would be scholars and men of welllearned and and according you know when you compared the prophet to to to these guys prophet wasn't much of a preacher you know he couldn't say eloquent words he he couldn't say things right And and even one of those scholars told him said, "You don't even know your Bible." You know, but one thing the reply was, "But I know the author." &gt;&gt; Amen. I know the author. Ain't that right? Amen. And and I thought, you know, Brother Brandham actually built a complex and uh uh because of of him, you know, having to preach and his language wasn't good and his vocabulary and and here's all these men behind him and he's telling the people, he says, "I built the complex." He says, "I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I'm here and and and and these things." But then he says, "But it's him. &gt;&gt; But it's him." AND THAT'S WHAT MADE HIS MINISTRY DIFFERENT WAS THERE WAS A PILLAR OF FIRE WITH HIM. THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS WITH HIM VINDICATING everything that man said. &gt;&gt; SEE, GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE ELOQUENT PREACHER. GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO have educated preacher. GOD WOULD TAKE A MAN that he could use and show his glory through. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, we think of that God knows how to get the job done. Do you believe that? Amen. If God's called you, he knows what he's doing. And if he's called you for a task, he knows how to get the job done. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. If he's called you to raise your children in this age and and and and raise them to the fear of the Lord, he knows what he's doing &gt;&gt; and he knows HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES us parents are our backs are against the wall. We, you know, we we we uh uh don't know what to do. We don't have answers for everything. And and the things that we thought was good, WE FIND OUT IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD. And and and we're trying. It's just kind of amazed because they don't have textbooks for children, you know, AND AND EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT AND THINGS COME UP AND BUMPS ALONG the road and all of that. Amen. But what we count upon is not our own ability, but we rest in his ability. He knows how to get the job done. HE KNOWS HOW TO GET US THROUGH THIS MAZE. HE KNOWS HOW HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. CAN YOU say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. See, and so he's able. Not only does he know how to get the job done, he's able to get the job done. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then God just needs a body to work through. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; GOD JUST NEEDS A BODY. AMEN. I I want God to use my body. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what he wants. He just needs a body to work through. He doesn't need us to tell him how to do it. &gt;&gt; He He doesn't need us to educate him. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? SOMETIME WE CAN GET SO CHURCHY and so THAT WE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN GOD DOES. &gt;&gt; WELL, WELL, we He doesn't want us for that. &gt;&gt; He wants us that we could you he could use us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on now, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, we find that the Bible tells us that each one of us are a vessel. We're considered to be vessels. Uh I I looked it up in in Webster dictionary. vessel is a container such as a cup, a bowl, uh uh some kind of a dish or a bottle or something and it's for holding something. See and and and then he goes on to say a person into whom now he's saying that the vessel is a person can be a person into whom uh some quality such as grace I put deity is infused &gt;&gt; ain't that right &gt;&gt; now now this was empty at one time &gt;&gt; and THEN THEY PUT WATER in it &gt;&gt; now AS LONG AS THIS IS EMPTY it does us no good &gt;&gt; it's just going to sit in the shelf, BUT IT WAS FILLED WITH SOMETHING FOR a purpose &gt;&gt; that I might use it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's a vessel. &gt;&gt; Something to be used for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. WELL, GOD WOULD DESIGN man to be a vessel, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not not not to be self-sufficient, &gt;&gt; right? I if IF YOU'RE NOT FILLED UP, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST GOING TO SIT on a shelf. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; BUT BUT A VESSEL IS A HUMAN. NOW, we talking ABOUT THE HUMAN VESSELS THAT SOMETHING CAN BE INFUSED, POURED INTO AND INFUSED. &gt;&gt; SO, the purpose of the vessel is to pour something in it and use it. Ain't that right? See, and it cannot be used unless there's something in it. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, uh, to get us to understand what we really are, God uses, you know, uh, different things to show us what we are, uh, like in our, in our opening scripture, he says, I am the br uh, the vine. You are the branch. Well, there's a reason he's telling us this. Because a branch can't bear fruit without the vine. &gt;&gt; The vine is the lifeline. &gt;&gt; The the life starts from the vine &gt;&gt; and pours and flows through the branch. &gt;&gt; But the vine needs the branch because the vine cannot bear fruit without the branch. Can you say amen? So the vine, as long AS THE BRANCH IS ATTACHED to the vine, LIFE CAN FLOW THROUGH THAT branch and bring forth life that is in the vine. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? AMEN. SO YOU TAKE THAT BRANCH AND CUT IT OFF FROM THE VINE. AMEN. It ain't IT AIN'T SELF-SUFFICIENT. GOD DIDN'T MAKE THAT BRANCH SELF-SUFFICIENT. That branch NEEDS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE VINE. &gt;&gt; IF IT'S NOT ATTACHED TO THE VINE, IT'LL DIE UP AND ROT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AND THAT'S WHAT JESUS IS TELLING US. AMEN. That if you're not attached to me, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND DRY UP. FOR WITHOUT ME, YOU CAN DO NOTHING. YOU CAN PREACH, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED TO ME, IT'S NOTHING. YOU CAN SING, YOU CAN PLAY THE MUSIC, YOU CAN CLAIM CHRISTIANITY, YOU CAN DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED TO ME, YOU'RE NOTHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; For sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's right. &gt;&gt; So the prophet says the vine with all its energy cannot produce anything unless the branch is willing to receive the energy. Now God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit. Now, if he's dependent on you, let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? AS THE LIFE OF CHRIST just trying to pour itself into us, LET'S OPEN UP OUR CHANNELS. GOD, FREE US FROM ANY DOUBT THAT WOULD HINDER THAT LIFE FROM FUNCTIONING IN US. Can you say amen? BECAUSE WE FIND OUT THAT THE BRANCH IS A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Not an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember Jesus went and done miracles in his own town. And he did not one miracle because of the unbelief of the people. Amen. And no matter how much power is in the vine, no matter how much energy is in that vine, and no matter HOW MUCH LIFE IS IN THAT VINE, if the if if if the branch is an unbeliever, amen, THEN THE LIFE CAN'T FLOW, GOD CAN'T BRING HIS POWER AND MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN. Can you say amen? It takes a believer. &gt;&gt; SO GOD, TAKE ALL DOUBTS AWAY FROM US. TAKE TAKE ALL FEAR AWAY FROM US. TAKE ALL SKEPTICISM AWAY FROM US THAT we can open up our channel &gt;&gt; and let you flow through. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; the Bible tells us that men again humanity are vessels but not all are the same kind of vessel. Not all are used for the same purpose. So I want to read a scripture Romans 9:22. It says, "What if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction." &gt;&gt; So there's vessels that Paul would say they're vessels of wrath and they're fitted to destruction. Then 23rd verse. And that he might make known the riches of his glory, not on the vessels of wrath, but on the vessels of what? &gt;&gt; Mercy, &gt;&gt; which he had all for prepared unto glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we just don't want to be a vessel. Amen. But there's vessels of wrath. Amen. That are fitted to destruction and they're being used in their own way. Amen. But then there's vessels of mercy. God makes known his glory. Amen. And these vessels were prepared before the foundation of the world. Amen. In another place, the Bible tells us that there are vessels of honor and there's vessels of dishonor. Amen. Vessels of wrath, vessels of dishonor, vessels of mercy, vessels of honor. Can you say amen? See, and each of these vessels are filled with uh uh uh something different from the other. Like in Romans uh 1:29, Paul talked of a people being filled. Everybody say filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetedness, uh maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malign, whisperers. Ain't that right? Amen. See, so this this is what these vessels were filled with in in in indignation, wrath, and and fornication, and and all of THESE THINGS. NOTICE WHAT KIND OF VESSEL Judas was. Luke 22 and3 then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscar being the of the number of the 12 and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him Jesus unto them. See? Amen. So he was a vessel. Amen. But he was filled with Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan entered into him. Can you say amen? What was he? a vessel of wrath, a a vessel of of of dishonor. Ain't that right? Luke 4 uh tells us that Jesus taught in the synagogue. And in the 28th verse, it says that and and and all they in that synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath. Not filled with repentance, not filled with agony, but filled with wrath. Synagogue back then is a church today. Amen. Uh we call it church. They called it synagogue. And all that were in that church in that synagogue when they heard HIS TEACHINGS, THEY ALL of a sudden were filled with wrath. What? Oh my. Amen. How how would God fill somebody with wrath when they're hearing the word of God? Well, God wouldn't DO THAT. AMEN. GOD WOULDN'T POUR WRATH INTO A VESSEL WHEN the word is coming forth and ALL THEY'RE FILLED WITH IS ANGER and wrath. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So if you go to Acts 13:44, and the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. And when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming. See, so these were vessels we could say of dishonor. Now the Bible tells of another people that on the day of Pentecost there was 120 gathered up in the upper room and when the Holy Ghost came they were all filled. Can you say amen? filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Filled with THE HOLY GHOST. WHY? GOD FOUND VESSELS. GOD FOUND vessels that would open themselves up. Amen. Unto him. And they were praying. Oh God made the PROMISE COME. OH GOD, SEND US THE PROMISE. AMEN. AND THEY WERE VESSELS OPENING UP THEMSELVES TO HIS SPIRIT and he filled them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul prays that the church might be filled with all the fullness of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In Matthew 25, Jesus speaks of the 10 virgins. There were five wise and five foolish. &gt;&gt; And he says that the five five wise took oil in their vessels. &gt;&gt; Amen. with their lamps. Now, we know this is speaking of this age that there are people that they were all virgins, clean, spotless, holy, of the same material, but there were virgins that did not put oil in themselves. &gt;&gt; But then there was the wise that had oil. &gt;&gt; They kept oil in their vessel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See? See? So vessels, vessels of honor. See, so we are made to be filled up &gt;&gt; so that we can be used. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham praying. He says, "God, fill us with deity." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fill us with deity. fill us with power and energy until our souls are a flame. That our strength will be him, our testimony will be God, our words will be his, then devils will tremble. &gt;&gt; The world will shake and rock under the impact of it. Lord, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I think that should be the prayer of all of us today is God fill US WITH DEITY. FILL US WITH THY POWER. &gt;&gt; FILL US WITH THY WORDS THAT WHEN WE SPEAK IT'S YOUR WORDS. &gt;&gt; FILL US WITH THY ENERGY THAT WHEN WE MOVE IT'S IT'S YOUR ENERGY. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? FILL US WITH YOURSELF THAT OUR ATTITUDE IS YOUR ATTITUDE. OUR MOTIVE IS YOUR MOTIVE. &gt;&gt; So fill us Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see in another place he said breathe on us Lord. fill us with the oxygen of the word in the power of his resurrection so that we can stay alive in this last wicked day. You think of it, that's a prayer now because we're living in a time when the death angel is coming just as it was in the first Exodus where the death angel, God says, "When I see the blood, I'll pass over you." If there was no blood on that home, death struck. &gt;&gt; And in this age, so is it. The death angel is coming. Amen. It's going throughout the land and people are spiritually dying. The revivals of what used to be. Amen. What Luther stood for in his day, the Lutheran do no longer stand for in that day. What Wesley stood for in his day, the Wesleyans no longer stand for that. Amen. The power of God that moved. Amen. These denominations are drying up and church people are drying up. You can go to church and be dead. Amen. dried up without a spiritual uh uh experience with God, without any kind of relationship. We don't want to come to church and not have a relationship WITH GOD. WE DON'T WANT TO RAISE CHILDREN WITHOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. WE DON'T WANT TO PROCLAIM CHRISTIANITY WITHOUT KNOWING THE SUPERNATURAL POWER AND EXPERIENCING THE SUPERNATURAL. I SAY, GOD, FILL US UP. BREATHE INTO US A BREATH OF OXYGEN OF YOUR WORD that we may stay alive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not a form of godliness and deny THE POWER THEREOF. GIVE US THAT POWER. &gt;&gt; Fill us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fill us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, God wants to fill us with himself. It doesn't matter how perfect the vessel is. That's right. The question is is what is this vessel filled with? &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a perfect vessel. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be just so perfectly formed. And you don't have to be an able vessel. You just need to be a open vessel. &gt;&gt; Open to the right kind of things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You see, when the vessel is filled with God himself, then the shikina glory will return again to the house of the living God, which is the human body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, that that that's what we want is we don't want the shakina glory leaving us. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Are are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the shakana glory that we need. Remember when when in the Bible when when that when that rod Amen. and Aaron's rod. Amen. It It was almond rod, I believe. But it was dead. It It was detached. IT WAS NO LIFE IN IT. BUT WHEN IT COME INTO THE PRESENCE OF SHAKINA GLORY. AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THAT ROD BUDDED. IT BROUGHT FORTH. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? What we need in OUR LIVES IS THE SHAKINA GLORY. AMEN. I DON'T WANT TO JUST read about him. I DON'T WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT HIM. I WANT THAT SHAKINA GLORY TO COME INTO ME and cause my life to bud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can know what God has done in this day. You can even believe in what God has done in this day. But if you're detached from the shakina glory, &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what &gt;&gt; it doesn't do you any good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is true. You see, we desperately need the shikana glory in our lives or we will desperately fail. &gt;&gt; We'll miserably fail. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now notice, I hope this all right this morning. Acts 19:11, it says, "And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them." Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exor exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth." &gt;&gt; Now, it tells you right then, they didn't know Jesus for himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were only quoting what Paul preached. &gt;&gt; They were only saying Jesus whom Paul preaches. So it tells you they didn't know the Jesus that Paul preached. &gt;&gt; And yet they were wanting to do what Paul was doing. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And they thought well they looked at Paul working miracles and all that. They thought that was just Paul. So so let's just do it. We'll we'll do it ourselves, you know. And and so and and he says uh um we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches and and there were seven sons of onekeva a Jew and chief of the priest which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are you?" And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overcame them, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Notice the difference between Paul and the seven sons ofKeva. See, now Acts 13:9 tells us that Paul was filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? Paul was filled &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He He wasn't filled with entertainment. &gt;&gt; He wasn't filled with anger. He wasn't filled with doubt. He was a vessel filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And back into the scripture that we just read. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul. &gt;&gt; This wasn't Paul doing this. God was doing it. &gt;&gt; Paul was just a vessel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So God performed the hands miracles from the hands of Paul. Whereas these seven sons were out on their own trying to do what Paul was doing. Paul was doing the work of the Lord by the spirit of God dwelling in him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see, it's going to take the supernatural to do the work of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not I'm not saying, you know, uh I I believe if God's called a man to do something, God equips that man. Amen. &gt;&gt; He equips him with the talent to to um to do to do what he's able to do. Uh thinking of brother Kevin uh such a guitar player. Well, God gave him that talent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and God gives you talent to sing. God gives you talent to preach. God gives you gifts and and these things, but it takes the supernatural, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Kevin could be out just like so many others. Ched Atkins and well, I don't know too many of them out there that could take his gift, his talent, and play out for the world. &gt;&gt; Sure. They're they're good. &gt;&gt; There's guys out there that's playing in the honky tonks and all that. Just good guitarists, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and there's some of them if you paid them maybe good money, they would come in the church and play, &gt;&gt; same talent, &gt;&gt; same everything. &gt;&gt; But what would be the difference? &gt;&gt; Amen. It would be a vessel &gt;&gt; that is anointed of God &gt;&gt; that when he gets UP AND PLAYS THE THE the the uh the guitar, Sister Rihanna, Ryanna playing the piano, I tell him the other night, I said, you know, uh uh you guys are just good. &gt;&gt; NOT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE JUST able to do something, but they're anointed when they play. JUST A SPIRIT OF GOD JUST IN THEIR MUSIC. WHY? IT'S A VESSEL &gt;&gt; THAT HAS SURRENDERED to God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; See, so we find that it's going to take something supernatural because as the Bible says, we're not wrestling against flesh and blood. You believe that &gt;&gt; we're not wrestling. Spirits coming up against us all the time. &gt;&gt; Spirits are working on people all the time. Sure. &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brown would call them precious people. &gt;&gt; People that ain't recognizing the spirit that is trying to to to war against them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. It it it it is it isn't the person that causes havoc. It's it's not the person that's that it's it's a spirit that that causes disunityity. It's a spirit that brings division. IT'S THE SPIRIT THAT TRIES TO WRECK UP OUR FAMILY. It's a spirit that tries to it works AND THEN IT TRIES TO GET US to become bitter. IT TRIES TO GET US TO BECOME ANGRY. IT TRIES TO GET US TO TO FIGHT BACK. YES. &gt;&gt; You understand WHAT I'M SAYING? IT'S ALL A SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS MOTIVATED BY A SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT SATAN DON'T REALIZE IS WE ARE NOT VESSELS OF DISHONOR. &gt;&gt; WE ARE VESSELS THAT HAVE BEEN DEDICATED UNTO GOD. REMEMBER there were vessels, amen, for the tabernacle THAT THAT GOD REQUIRED THEM VESSELS TO BE NOT USED FOR ANY OTHER thing than for his purpose. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? THEY WERE VESSELS UNTO THE LORD. They were considered holy vessels, not defiled vessels. AND YOU REMEMBER WHEN THAT OLD WICKED KING OF BABYLON TOOK GOD'S VESSELS AND BROUGHT THEM INTO HIS BANQUET OF CELEBRATION AND FILLED THEM WITH HIS WINE FOR HIS PURPOSE. THE HANDWRITING came on the wall AND HIS KINGDOM WAS FINISHED. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We are NOT VESSELS OF WRATH. WE ARE NOT VESSELS OF DISHONOR. AMEN. THEREFORE, WE GUARD OURSELVES. UH AMEN. SATAN, you cannot use us. Uh, SATAN, YOU CANNOT DEFILE US. UH, SATAN, WE ARE SOLD OUT TO GOD. WE HAVE BEEN DEDICATED UNTO GOD. &gt;&gt; We're not wrestling against flesh and blood. that Paul would tell us, we're wrestling against principalities, against powers, &gt;&gt; against the rulers of darkness of this world, against prince uh spiritual wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; Therefore, Paul would tell us the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. &gt;&gt; It ain't with this fist. It ain't with a gun. &gt;&gt; It ain't with words of of anger. &gt;&gt; It's not with the lawyer. IT'S NOT WITH WITH WHATEVER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE ARE NOT CARNAL, &gt;&gt; but they are mighty through GOD TO THE PULLING DOWN of every stronghold. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The armor that we must have on is supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray this makes sense to you today. Lord, &gt;&gt; the man, the woman, the girl, the boy that God uses is just a natural vessel, natural human with frailties, &gt;&gt; disappointments, &gt;&gt; weaknesses, &gt;&gt; mistakes, &gt;&gt; complexes, perplexed at times, distressed at times. They feel the effects of of things in the world. And and yet God doesn't need our natural ability. God doesn't need us to feel perfect for him to use us. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you, God doesn't even need you to feel saved &gt;&gt; as long as you are saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God can use you when you don't even feel like you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; As long as you know you got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can use a preacher when he don't feel like he's a preacher. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the way he wants it, don't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can take a Christian when he don't feel like he's a Christian and use him. &gt;&gt; See, it's not how we feel. It's not how we are. We are just his vessel that he's filled up. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, he doesn't need our natural ability. Man always wants to lead or lend to God his ability and what he can do. &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't take much longer. But Moses did that. He saw the need of the day. Prophet said he was a smart man. He was the coming Pharaoh. He had psychology. He had power. He had physical strength. He had everything. So he said, "Well, I'm equipped. I know all of it. &gt;&gt; And if there's a man in the land that's able to do it, &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; So I'm the man of the hour. So I'll step out." And he went out to accomplish a work that was right. a work that was right that God had called him to do &gt;&gt; and in the will of God. See, he he accomplished a work that was right and in the will of God and he offered his natural abilities and God refused it &gt;&gt; because God could not use one thing that Moses had to offer. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So because even though he was he was in the will of God as far as doing what God had called him to do, he was raised up for this purpose was to lead the people out, but because he was trying in his own ability, he failed miserably. And the only thing he ended up with was a dead Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then we find that God had to take him out into the desert for 40 years &gt;&gt; to get all of his knowledge out. &gt;&gt; To strip him of his will, to strip him of his ability, to strip him of his knowhow, to strip him of his want to, to strip him of everything, &gt;&gt; his theology, his ambition. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Paul was the same way. God took him out in the desert to strip him of his own abilities, his own will, his education, &gt;&gt; his ambitions, everything to where Paul became a nobody. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Look at Paul. He was a well-learned man. He was a scholar. Could speak any near any language there was in the world at that time. He was a well-trained in psychology. He was brought up under the strict sect of Pharisees. His father was a Pharisee. He was a Pharisee. And he was the strictest of Pharisees. He had great authority. In Philippians 3 and 7, Paul says, "But what things were gained to me, I COUNTED LOSS FOR CHRIST." &gt;&gt; NOW, before he got converted, he wasn't willing to lay down everything down. &gt;&gt; That's what he WAS USING TO WORK FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DIDN'T NEED THAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; TRUE. &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING GOD A SERVICE. &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU CAN USE ME. I'M TALENTED. I'M KNOWLEDGEABLE. I was reared up in education. I'M THE STRICTEST OF THEM ALL. ACCORD CONCERNING THE LAW, I'M BLAMELESS. &gt;&gt; AND NONE OF THAT MATTERED. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's good. HE SAID, "YAY, DOUBTLESS AND I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I HAVE SUFFERED THE LOSS OF ALL THINGS, &gt;&gt; and do count them but dung that I may win Christ &gt;&gt; and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." Good. &gt;&gt; So, he had to forget how strong and how great he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He had to realize that he could not depend on himself. He had to forget all the training that he had. &gt;&gt; Now, notice God got Paul to a a a a a place that he could use him. Notice the the place that Paul, this educated scholar, this this wellrefined man in 1 Corinthians 2 and one. And I, brethren, when I came to you came not with excellency of speech or wisdom. Whoa, that's that's not the the the Paul that we knew in the beginning. &gt;&gt; The saw declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, say Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, &gt;&gt; and in fear, and in much trembling. &gt;&gt; And my speech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of men, wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet said he didn't want to know their abilities because he knew there was nothing in them. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's why church, we're we're all in the same boat. The older I get and and and the Lord, you know, the more schooling I get, I realize I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; But I look at a people who's nothing. &gt;&gt; I I I I don't expect it from you. It's got to take God. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It It takes God to do it. It takes GOD FOR ME TO STAND up here to preach. It takes God FOR YOU TO TO DO WHAT YOU'RE doing in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to know their abilities because he knew that there was nothing in them. He had determined to only recognize the crucified savior among them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, I WAS WITH YOU IN WEAKNESS. NOT IN GREATNESS AND PIETY. &gt;&gt; Not in strength. &gt;&gt; I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. This was a man who had turned the world upside down. &gt;&gt; This was a man of great ministry and authority and God done many things in his life. And here he was confessing that he had come in weakness and not as a trained scholar. He came in fear, the prophet said, lest he would step off the path somewhere. It wasn't that he was scared of anything. He was just scared that he would displease God in some way and that he would get his own ability mixed into it. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET SOMETHING THAT HE HAD learned and give it to the people. And he came in much trembling because he could not trust in his own ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "If there's anything that our schools need today, if it's anything our churches need today, is a stripping of themselves of your own thoughts and your own abilities. Strip yourselves before God unless you would try to do something within yourself." He said, "You've got to become a nothing, not a know-it-all, not a great somebody, but a nobody. You got to come to dust. You got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing. And don't ever rise above that. For as soon as you rise above it, you rise above God. You've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus. You You got to keep yourself off your high horse." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He says, "If you notice in the Bible, it's always those who are trying to get away from it that God uses." &gt;&gt; Not men that say, "Well, I can do it. I can do it. You need me." But it's men that says, "Oh, no. I I'm not fit for the job. I I can't do it. I'm I'm not able to do it." And as long as man wants to do something and thinks he's got the ability, he can put the job over. God can never use that man. &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Man, look at Moses running. Look at Paul running and the rest of them trying to get away from it. Another place he says, notice it takes the weakness and the rejected, the weakest and the rejected. And practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person. A person that was rejected, a person that thought he was insufficient, a person that had no ability at all, then that person's just in good shape. so God can start using them. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T AND they ain't got nothing, THAT'S WHEN GOD CAN TAKE A HOLD of them and do something with them. &gt;&gt; But when we think that we're able to do it, then God can't use us because we're wanting to do it ourselves. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He says, then the other side, we get these feelings and we think then that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it. than if we just listen to the call of God. That's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of a shape. So he can when we are in sufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit. As long as we think that we can do it then we can't do it. But when we get to a place where we know amen that we can't do it then we yield oursel to God and he does it. So then IF IT'S US TRYING to do it we'll fail. BUT IF WE'LL JUST YIELD OURSELVES TO GOD, THEN GOD CAN'T FAIL. &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that God cannot do, and that's fail. He can do anything else but fail. He cannot fail. So, as long as we're trying in ourselves and depending on our own ability and so forth, while we'll do nothing, but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing, then God can use us. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's one of the most important things that we must master." Remember he said especially you young ministers and lay members alike one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master the thought of human ability. If we ever get to a spot where we think that we can do it with our own intelligence and our own abilities. We've got to master that in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So then it tells us that everything that we are has to be surrendered to God. And it may not be much. It may not. You look in the Bible of the the woman when Elijah uh called drought upon the earth, he said it wouldn't rain for three and a half years except at his word. And he was sent down to a widow woman of Zerapath. And this woman's husband had died. He had been a real godly man. She was left with a child. There was death all around. Nobody had anything. She She only had just a little. The Bible says she just had a little meal. That's it. And she says, "I'm I'm going to prepare this meal. Just one last. I'm going to prepare it. Then me and my son's going to die because that's all." She couldn't go borrow cuz no one had anything. &gt;&gt; She had come to her weakest point. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; TO WHERE SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER. &gt;&gt; And as she was on her way to get the sticks or to prepare, she hears a voice say, "Bake me a cake first." She turned around and there's a prophet Elijah. &gt;&gt; Make me the cake first. If you'll do this, the mailbarrow will never run dry. Yours of oil will never run dry. Lord, &gt;&gt; it'll last you. It'll sustain you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the words of a prophet, she yielded what she had. to the Lord. She recognized that this man wasn't just an average man. This was a prophet that carried the words of God and she built it and she did accordingly. And when she surrendered what little she had to God, God blessed it. &gt;&gt; And he kept using it and using it and using it. God sustained her. Take the other little woman that had sons and there she was in debt and her her husband had died and she was getting her son's going to be sold taken into slavery and she ran to the prophet of God. And the prophet asked her says, "Well, what do you have in your house?" She says, "All only I've got is just a vessel, a vessel full of oil. That's all I got. Just a little vessel of oil." He says, "You go borrow from the neighbors. You go to the neighbor's house and you take all the vessels they've got and you bring it into your home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you take from that vessel and just pour it into the other vessels. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as she began to pour &gt;&gt; and it would look like what she little she had, she surrendered it to the words of a prophet to his message and she poured it. And when that vessel become full, she looked and the vessel was still full. &gt;&gt; THE VESSEL SHE POURED FROM WAS STILL FULL. &gt;&gt; AND SHE POURED IT INTO ANOTHER VESSEL AND IT WAS STILL FULL. SHE POURED IT INTO ANOTHER VESSEL AND IT WAS STILL FULL. SHE HAD SURRENDERED what little SHE HAD TO THE MESSAGE THAT A PROPHET HAD BROUGHT HER. &gt;&gt; CHURCH, God gave us a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrender what little you have to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surrender what little you have. You say, "Well, I I I'm not I'm just not good singer. I'm I'm not a good father. I'm not a good mother. I I'm I'm not a good whatever. You don't have to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, just surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't got much money. Well, take what little money you got and surrender it. &gt;&gt; Just surrender everything that you are to the message that God has brought through a prophet in this age. &gt;&gt; And you find God start using you. You find that God starts pouring himself into you. &gt;&gt; Pouring himself and pouring himself. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God use us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; bless his holy name. &gt;&gt; I pray it was a help to you today. Doing our best for the Lord may not be much that we have to offer, &gt;&gt; but take everything that you got and surrender it to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not surrendering it to the world. You're not letting your vessel be filled up with trash. See, humans are like sponges. When we feed off of the things of the world, we start becoming that. It's &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; Hanging around smoking and hanging around, you know, the ungodly believers and just we hanging around that stuff. Hanging around that. And what we're doing is we're soaking things up to our spirit. We're soaking up things &gt;&gt; and it's taking us to where God can't fill us with his own glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if we can stand here today and empty ourselves out, say, "God, I filled myself up with so much negativity, so much world that I just want to surrender it. I want to just empty myself out and let you just pour yourself into me." And if I'm full of you, then Satan can't pour in his bitterness. Satan can't pour in lust. Satan can't pour in anything. So God, fill me. Is that your desire today? Amen. in me. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use me. Here I am. Here I stand. Lord, my life is in your hand. Lord, I'm hoping to see your desires revealed in me. So I give myself away. Hallelujah. Oh, I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. Oh, I give myself away so you can use me. Take my heart. Take my life as a living sacrifice and all my dreams. All my plans, Lord, I place them in your hands. I give myself away. Sing it as a prayer to him. Oh, I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away. So you sing it again. Oh, I give myself away. Glory, glory. Hallelujah. Oh, take my heart, take my life. Let it be a living sacrifice. And all my dreams, all my plans, Lord, I place I'll place them in your hands. Lord, I give myself away. Fill me with your spirit. Fill me with your deity. Halleluah. Oh, I give myself away. I give myself away so you can. Oh, sing it again. I give myself away. Bless the name of the Lord. Here's my heart. I am here. I stand. Lord, my life is in your hands. And Lord, I'm longing to see your desires revealed in me. So I give myself away. I give myself away. Hallelujah. Oh, I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use me. Can you lift your hands unto the Lord and worship him? Oh, bless the name of the Lord. Bless the name of the Lord. We don't have to try to fix it. We don't have to try to do anything. Just surrender ourselves to him. Oh, let you, Lord, fix the problems. God, let you fight the battles, God. Let you open the doors for us. Hallelujah. Bless the name of the Lord. Bless the name of the Lord. Give myself. I give myself to you. My life is not my own. To you I belong. I give myself. Can we sing that again? Oh my life. It's not my own. To you I belong. I give myself. I give myself to you. Oh, I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. I give myself away. Oh, you I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. Lord, surrender my life. I give it all to you. I surrender. Lord, I surrender. Lord, I surrender my life. I give it all to you. Say that as a prayer now. I surrender. I surrender. I I give it all to you. I surrender. I surrender. Lord, I surrender my life. I give it all to you. Is that the way you feel this morning? There's that song Don Brother Donnie Reagan wrote it. Something about my life waste. Um would y'all know that song? Something I surrender I give it. &gt;&gt; All that I years I've wasted. &gt;&gt; All those wasted hours. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All those wasted hours and minutes. They're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more of you in me. Let's sing it out a prayer now. I need more love. That's the way it's got to be. I till there's no room left in me. All those wasted hours and days, they're yours now. From the start to the finish. I need more in me. Can we sing that one more time? Oh, I need more. Is that the way you feel? That's the way it's got to be. I till there's no room left in me. All those wasted hours and they're yours now from the start to the finish. I need more as they just play softly. May we keep that in our mind. It's not a natural, you know, we're in the season of Christmas and they have, you know, many displays there are of a little Jesus in a manger. But today, we are that manger. We are the one that he comes to live in. Not as a baby but as fullness of God, full deity, full power, not infant, but God in us ruling and reigning and declaring himself as God. And I'm so glad for that. May God bless you today. We love you. Stay warm. You were supposed to have a snowstorm again tomorrow. And so uh uh some is amen, some of them. No, no, I'm in between. But uh uh may you stay safe and once again, it's just really good to have all of visitors. Brother Chandler and his friend. God bless you all and always good seeing you and u sister Dia appreciate you. Amen. Very much. And um um may you have a wonderful day. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Amen. And ask maybe brother Will and dismiss this in prayer.
