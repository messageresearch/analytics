[18:01] not one need that's been read across

[18:54] [music] the name that is above every
[18:55] name. That your great anointing would
[18:57] come in this building. And Father, when

[19:03] subjective to it. And Father, I pray
[19:05] tonight, [singing] every hand that was

[19:12] knee turn into a testimony right here in
[19:14] this meeting, Lord, Father, we [music]
[19:16] pray as the [singing] man of God would
[19:17] come to bring your word. Father, may you
[19:19] anoint him and use him in a special way.
[19:22] Father, I [music] pray that if there be
[19:23] an empty vessel here tonight, may they
[19:25] [singing] receive the Holy Ghost, Lord.

[19:28] refilling of your spirit, [singing]
[19:29] Lord. We surrender our hearts into your
[19:32] hands. Have your way among us tonight.

[19:35] these needs. It's already done. It's a
[19:37] finished work now. Lord, we believe you
[19:39] to bring it to pass in [music] every
[19:41] body. [singing] We love and thank you

[27:57] would [music] not be denied.
[28:02] I would [singing] not be denied.
[28:06] Oh, [music]
[28:07] since Jesus came and he made [singing]
[28:10] me whole, I would not be [music] denied.
[28:17] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[28:19] praise? Hallelujah.
[28:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. As we turn it over to
[28:26] our pastor, I need thee. Oh, I need
[28:29] thee.

[29:34] Oh bless [singing]
[29:36] me now [music]
[29:39] my sioravior [singing]
[29:44] I come

[29:50] thee [music] once again sing it as a
[29:52] prayer. Oh I need
[29:57] every day we [music and singing] need
[29:58] him. Every hour, every moment.
[30:03] Oh [singing]
[30:04] yes. Every
[30:08] hour
[30:10] [music] I need thee.
[30:15] Oh, bless [music]
[30:17] me now, [singing]
[30:20] my savior.
[30:24] [music]
[30:25] I come [singing]
[30:28] to [music]
[30:30] thee.
[30:34] [music] You know, it's a good thing
[30:37] to know that it's not that we [music]
[30:39] just have this desire for him and need
[30:43] him, but he has shown [music] himself to
[30:46] be alive and well.
[30:49] And [music] as the prophet said, "My
[30:51] message is to declare that he's here.
[30:54] He's here among [music] us. We're not
[30:56] just
[30:59] serving some mythical god or some far
[31:03] out in the universe [music] and can't
[31:05] reach him, but he's here and he's
[31:08] promised [music] that where two or three
[31:09] are gathered in his name, he'll be here
[31:12] in in in our midst." And [music] I just
[31:15] believe that with all my heart.
[31:18] The prophet told us that God is more
[31:20] willing to meet our need [music] than
[31:22] you are to receive it. And uh so if
[31:25] you're desperate and you're really
[31:27] hungering to have your need met, just
[31:29] [music] imagine God is more willing. God
[31:33] is more willing and more anxious. And
[31:36] Amen. And I just believe that these
[31:38] [music] this meeting has been ordained
[31:40] of God. And I am looking forward to a
[31:43] wonderful time in the [music] Lord.
[31:45] Amen.
[31:46] And I'd like to just welcome uh all of
[31:50] the visitors. [music]
[31:51] Amen. And uh good to have brother
[31:53] Jonathan. Amen. And brother Andrew,
[31:56] ministers of the gospel. [music] And uh
[31:58] preaching this message. And I uh
[32:01] appreciate them very much. And just
[32:03] [music]
[32:04] all the um uh all of you who have
[32:08] [music] come and the locals as well. And
[32:11] we just love the Lord. How many's
[32:13] looking forward to a great [music] time?
[32:16] Amen. I certainly am. And um we know
[32:19] that um [music] uh how it works. The
[32:22] prophet told us it's not the minister.
[32:25] [music] The minister's got a job to
[32:27] [snorts] do and that's get himself out
[32:29] of the way. God's put a [music] a gift
[32:32] in in him and has ordained him for such
[32:35] a time as this. But he's also ordained
[32:38] us. [music] Amen. For such a time as
[32:40] this. And he's placed a faith within us.
[32:43] Amen. To [music] where we can pull on
[32:45] that word. Amen. And when we pull on the
[32:48] word, God begins to operate through the
[32:51] man of God and he begins [music] to
[32:53] speak to our hearts. Amen. And um so uh
[32:57] we're just really honored to have
[32:59] brother Wayne uh here. It's been a
[33:01] [music] little while since he's been
[33:02] here and uh uh but we really uh glad
[33:06] that he's um uh come our way and we just
[33:11] want [music] him to take his time and uh
[33:14] whatever the Lord has laid on his heart
[33:16] to preach it. Amen. And we're um we're
[33:19] message believers. He's [music] a
[33:20] message preacher. Amen. And uh so we
[33:23] ought to just have a wonderful time cuz
[33:26] the prophet said the angel of the Lord
[33:27] accompanies this message [music] always.
[33:30] Amen. And I believe the angel of the
[33:32] Lord to be here with us. Amen. So, let's
[33:35] just sing as we invite Brother Wayne to
[33:37] come. [music]
[33:38] Amen. Uh let let's just sing uh Only

[35:26] good time to have a meeting. Amen. And
[35:28] remember the good things of God and his
[35:30] blessings upon [music] us. It's always
[35:32] an honor to be with brother Sean and the
[35:34] tabernacle here. And we certainly thank
[35:36] you [music] for the invitation. and uh
[35:38] we've been uh we've been a little busy
[35:40] pastoring and uh so we haven't [music]
[35:42] been traveling quite like we had been in
[35:44] the past, but it's always a blessing to
[35:46] come and and to fellowship with you all
[35:49] and trust the Holy Spirit would take
[35:51] something and and bring it from the word
[35:53] [music] tonight to bless you and uh amen
[35:55] to do something in your heart to lift it
[35:58] and to bring faith and and give grace.
[36:00] And I know certainly that [music]
[36:02] amen that his children he he cares for
[36:05] very much, Lord. And uh so we just ask
[36:08] [music] him to bless you tonight. And
[36:10] amen. If you would tonight, maybe just
[36:12] bow your [music] hearts with us. If we'd
[36:14] just like to approach him in a word of
[36:16] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[36:18] tonight. We thank you for the grace that
[36:20] you have shown us to be here today. We
[36:23] [music] thank you, Lord, for the great
[36:25] angel that that accompanies your word.
[36:28] And we [music] ask you tonight, Lord, as
[36:30] we invite you to the platform to take a
[36:32] hold of your word, we're asking [music]
[36:34] that you would use this word tonight,
[36:36] Lord, to bless your children, Father,
[36:39] that you would bless them that hear
[36:40] these things. That Lord, that you may
[36:43] bring the revelation and the spirit
[36:45] [music] of wisdom among us, Lord, that
[36:48] Father, our understanding could be open,
[36:50] Lord, and and faith could soar into our
[36:52] hearts to [music] see the grace of God
[36:54] as it unfolds. And Lord Jesus, we invite
[36:57] you [music] tonight in the name of Jesus
[37:00] Christ, we pray. Amen and amen. [music]
[37:04] And God bless you tonight. If you have
[37:06] your Bibles, we'd like to go into the
[37:07] word of the Lord. Amen. I certainly want
[37:10] to appreciate the men of God that
[37:11] traveled down with me today and uh say
[37:14] God bless them and thank them for their
[37:17] for their fellowship and and to be here
[37:19] tonight. Amen. I know they're very busy
[37:22] and so for them to take time to be here,
[37:25] it's a real honor to have them. And
[37:27] Amen. always a great blessing of course
[37:30] to come see our buddy, Brother Shawn. We
[37:32] been buddies a long time and a man been
[37:35] up and down the road and back together.
[37:37] And Amen. I always I can always we we
[37:40] met a lot earlier, but I can always
[37:42] remember when brother Sean went on the
[37:44] road with me first is when Anne was a
[37:46] baby. So, anytime you see Ann walking,
[37:49] you that's that's the age of our
[37:51] friendship with brother uh brother Sean
[37:54] on the road actually uh traveling with
[37:55] us and and we had a we had a wonderful
[37:58] year that year. First year he went out.
[38:00] I I don't know. He went out and I don't
[38:01] think he come home for a month or
[38:03] something. And Amen. God was using him
[38:05] in such a way and blessing the people by
[38:07] the gift. And Amen. We certainly uh
[38:09] appreciate brother Shawn a real a real
[38:12] minister of this word and real powerful
[38:14] preacher. And amen, we're uh we
[38:17] certainly know that you're well taught
[38:18] here and a tremendous balance preached
[38:21] from the scriptures. And amen, we just
[38:23] pray that the blessing of Abraham would
[38:26] rest upon you tonight as we approach
[38:28] him. And I've been in a little bit of
[38:30] study back home on the book of Hebrews.
[38:32] And uh you know when you get to studying
[38:34] on something, it it kind of sticks out
[38:36] in your heart. And I want to read from
[38:38] the book of Hebrews tonight, the seventh
[38:40] chapter. And I'm going to read about 10
[38:42] verses here. Um this is a beautiful uh
[38:45] text, something that that I really
[38:47] personally enjoy uh this scripture and
[38:50] and the thing that uh that Paul was
[38:53] bringing close to our hearts here. And
[38:55] then brother Brandham of course picks us
[38:57] up. Um in Hebrews 7 and verse one uh for
[39:01] this Melchazdc
[39:03] the king of Salem and the priest of the
[39:06] most high God who met Abraham returning
[39:10] from the slaughter of the kings and
[39:11] blessed him. Now he's quoting from
[39:14] Genesis the 14th chapter.
[39:16] And to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[39:20] part of all first being by
[39:23] interpretation
[39:25] the king of righteousness. Brother Bram
[39:27] said, "Of course, that's King God." And
[39:30] after that also the king of Salem,
[39:34] which is the king of peace. Brother Bram
[39:36] said, "The king of Jerusalem, Salem,
[39:38] Jerusalem," he said, "which was King
[39:40] Theophony,
[39:42] without father,
[39:44] without mother, without dissent,
[39:48] having neither beginning of days, nor
[39:51] the end of life, but made like unto the
[39:55] Son of God." Now notice that he was made
[39:57] like unto the son of God abideth a
[40:01] priest continually. Now consider how
[40:04] [clears throat] great this man was unto
[40:07] whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the
[40:10] tenth of his spools. And verily they
[40:12] that are of the sons of Levi, who
[40:15] receive the office of the priesthood
[40:17] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[40:18] people according to the law, that is of
[40:20] their brethren, though they come out of
[40:22] the loins of Abraham. But he whose
[40:25] descent is not counted from them
[40:28] received tithes of Abraham, and blessed
[40:30] him that had the promises, and without
[40:33] all contradiction, the less is blessed
[40:35] of the better. And here men that die
[40:37] receive tithes. But there he receiveth
[40:40] them of whom it is witnessed that he
[40:42] liveth. And as I may say, Levi also who
[40:47] received tithes paid tithe in Abraham.
[40:49] For he was yet in the loins of his
[40:51] father when Melazdc met him. May God
[40:54] bless the reading of his word tonight.
[40:55] As you could be seated, if I would uh
[40:58] take a title tonight, I'd like to speak
[41:00] to you the next little bit. I want to
[41:02] talk to you about a the effect of
[41:04] revelation of Melazdc. The effect of
[41:07] revelation of Melazdc. Uh this this man
[41:11] Melazedc, if you are familiar with the
[41:13] message of the hour, uh this is a very
[41:15] um a very familiar name. We you hear it
[41:18] talked about a lot. Uh, and it's it's
[41:20] beautiful because actually it's only
[41:23] spoken of a few times in the Bible. And
[41:25] if you're an Old Testament reader, you
[41:27] know, uh, that there's only two of the
[41:29] Old Testament uh, uh, writers that wrote
[41:32] of him. And of course, Abraham met him
[41:34] uh, in Genesis the 14th chapter. And
[41:36] then David speaks of him in the book of
[41:38] Psalms. Uh, and now both of those men,
[41:41] both Abraham and David, when Jesus was
[41:44] born, they attributed that he was the
[41:46] son of both David and Abraham. So, it's
[41:49] pretty amazing that the two that spoke
[41:50] of him had the attributed that he was
[41:53] their son. And so, uh, as Paul would
[41:57] pick those things up and then place them
[41:59] in the scriptures, uh, we still know
[42:02] that Mazdc, uh, the who he was and what
[42:05] he represented laid a great mystery and
[42:07] a great secret. And, uh, brother Brandon
[42:09] will tell us something as he himself
[42:11] preaches out of this scripture in the
[42:13] book of Hebrews. He preaches a couple
[42:15] parts. Hebrews chapter 7. And then
[42:17] again, he'll preach another sermon,
[42:19] Melchazdc, the grace pre great priest
[42:21] and king. And then I I think the
[42:23] capstone of those sermons as he
[42:25] preaches, who is this Melazdc? Amen. To
[42:29] answer that. And in the front of that
[42:31] book, he says, I I would like you to
[42:33] think about how great this person is.
[42:36] Amen. Uh how great this man must be. And
[42:39] and and brother Brown was specific
[42:41] saying this, how great the person. And
[42:43] then he says the man uh because you
[42:46] can't forget that what Abraham met was a
[42:49] man. And and so he was a person. He was
[42:51] yet a man. And he says now who who is
[42:54] this man? And brother Madam says
[42:56] theologians has had ideas but since the
[42:59] opening of the seals the mysterious book
[43:01] that's been mysterious according to
[43:03] Revelations 10 1-7. All the mysteries
[43:06] that's wrote in this book that's been
[43:08] hid down through the age of the
[43:09] reformers is supposed to be brought into
[43:12] view by the angel of the last church
[43:14] age. Now how many knows that's right?
[43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's supposed to be
[43:18] brought out and all the mysteries of
[43:20] this mysterious book is to be revealed
[43:22] to the layout of messenger of that age.
[43:25] And seeing there is much dispute about
[43:27] the person and this subject I think it
[43:30] behooves us to break into it and find
[43:32] out who it is. Now, I've always the
[43:35] first time I ever read that quote, it
[43:37] was amazing. Brother Terry, to me that
[43:39] brother Bram first of all draws out
[43:41] there's a question about it because some
[43:42] thinks it's a priesthood and some thinks
[43:44] it was a man and some thinks it was a
[43:46] myth and and brother Bram says but
[43:48] because there is a question about it
[43:50] because there is a question concerning
[43:53] the subject. He said, "Then the seventh
[43:55] angel is going to solve the subject."
[43:57] And he said, "So it behooves me that I
[44:00] would speak on it." And I said, "Well,
[44:02] what he did is he's not only telling you
[44:04] who Melkazedc was, he was telling you
[44:06] who he was." Amen. That it was his job
[44:09] to do it. Amen. That that if there is if
[44:11] there is an idea tonight of who
[44:13] Melkazedcict is, that answer would be
[44:16] coming from the seventh angel. He has
[44:19] supreme subject or authority upon who
[44:21] that is. Amen. And who this person is.
[44:24] Well, now, first of all, we realize that
[44:26] it is a person. Amen. And it's not just
[44:29] a myth because we realize uh the
[44:31] scripture says consider how great this
[44:33] man is. Amen. So Paul called him a man.
[44:37] Amen. But when when Abraham spoke to
[44:39] him, Abraham called him Lord. So he was
[44:42] both God and he was a man. Right? And
[44:45] brother Bam says he was a person. And
[44:47] whoever the person is, he's eternal. He
[44:50] said because watch he said he had no
[44:51] mother or no father. He never had a time
[44:54] he began and he never had a time he
[44:56] ended. So whoever the person is, he is
[44:59] eternal. Amen. And brother Bram said,
[45:01] "And whoever that person is, he's still
[45:03] alive tonight." Amen. So that eternal
[45:06] person, Amen, it has to be eternal
[45:08] person, and there's only one eternal
[45:10] person, and that's God.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; I like that. Don't you? Brother Ram
[45:14] said, "Then the thing that I contend, in
[45:16] other words, my argument on the case he
[45:19] says is that it was God." Because
[45:21] there's only one person that can be
[45:24] immortal. Amen. It was God. And God was
[45:27] changing himself into a person. That's
[45:30] right. No father, no mother, no
[45:31] beginning of days and no ending of life.
[45:34] Amen. He said, "There it is." Do you
[45:35] see? When you're reaching out into that
[45:37] scriptures, many time people try to
[45:39] teach on the three personalities of the
[45:41] Godhead. But you can't have a
[45:43] personality without being a person. It
[45:45] takes a person to be a personality,
[45:47] right? So they're just one God and it's
[45:49] just one person. And in 1 Timothy 6,
[45:52] Paul, the same writer of Hebrews 7 says,
[45:54] "Which in times he shall show who is the
[45:57] blessed and only potent, the King of
[46:00] Kings and the Lord of Lords, who only
[46:02] hath immortality, dwelling in light,
[46:05] which no man can approach, whom no man
[46:07] can see nor have seen, to whom honor and
[46:10] power everlasting." So the the idea of
[46:13] God being one person in this world we're
[46:15] living in, of course, Amen. There's so
[46:18] much confusion upon God. It's a world of
[46:20] atheism and agnostics where where
[46:22] everybody don't know. You know, it's a
[46:24] lot of times you'll meet people and
[46:26] you'll say, "Well, what do you believe?"
[46:27] And they'll say, "Well, I'm agnostic."
[46:29] Now, what they're really saying is that
[46:31] they just don't know. They can't be an
[46:32] atheist because they really know there's
[46:34] something out there. Amen. And they
[46:36] can't be a believer because they can't
[46:37] put a name on it. But so therefore,
[46:40] they're they don't know then. And that's
[46:42] exactly what Paul was talking about when
[46:44] he went into the city. I believe it was
[46:46] there in Mars. And he said he found,
[46:48] amen, a a a a altar that was to the
[46:50] unknown gods. You know, they had all
[46:52] these altars lying down the street and
[46:54] this altar is to this one and this one's
[46:55] to this one. And then they had one altar
[46:58] to the unknown god. Well, that's the god
[47:01] that brother Brandham come to reveal was
[47:03] the unknown god. The one that created
[47:06] the heavens and the earth. But but to
[47:08] speak about that god, you're going to
[47:10] have to have revelation. Now, now
[47:12] revelation it it means to uncover
[47:15] something. When you're looking at
[47:16] brother Brandham and he said Melazdc he
[47:18] says was to come into view. The
[47:20] revelation by by the seventh angel was
[47:22] to bring these things into view. And
[47:24] what revelation means it means an
[47:26] unveiling or something that was
[47:29] previously hidden is going to be brought
[47:31] into view. Amen. In other words, the
[47:33] thing that has been covered up is going
[47:35] to get uncovered. And William Brandom
[47:37] didn't come to cover up God. He come to
[47:40] uncover him. Amen. The uncovering was
[47:43] for the purpose of manifestation and it
[47:45] would take a revelation. Brother Bam
[47:47] said that Greek word revelation means
[47:49] apocalypse or in other words it's the
[47:50] unveiling or the uncovering of something
[47:53] like a like a a person that's been
[47:55] working on on something. Brother Bam
[47:57] uses it a a painter or sculpture been
[48:00] working on a statue and he's working
[48:02] underneath a cover but when he gets it
[48:04] completely finished and he takes the
[48:06] cover and you can see what the work has
[48:08] been all the way through. You know, if
[48:10] he took the cover off and it was just a
[48:13] big rock with feet, you wouldn't know
[48:14] what it was talking about. If he took
[48:16] the cover off and it was just a an
[48:18] emblem with no face or with no hair, you
[48:21] wouldn't know who the person was. But
[48:23] once it is complete, then you can take
[48:25] the veil off of it and say, "This has
[48:28] been the work of God the whole time." So
[48:30] the seventh angel comes for the purpose
[48:32] of uncovering or taking the veil off of
[48:35] that which was previously been hidden.
[48:38] It's a revelation. Now you can look at
[48:40] the book of revelations itself and
[48:42] understand it takes something or
[48:43] requires something to read the book of
[48:45] revelations because it's in symbology.
[48:48] So it's going to take someone to unveil
[48:50] it because it's been hidden from the
[48:52] natural reader. It's hid from
[48:53] intellectual minds. And so it's going to
[48:56] take it. But we don't only mean the book
[48:58] of revelations. But brother Random says
[49:00] revelation is tremendously important.
[49:02] And not only the book, he said, but I'm
[49:04] talking about all revelation. All
[49:06] revelation is supremely important. And
[49:08] brother Brandham had so much to say
[49:10] about it. He says, "Matter of fact, you
[49:12] cannot even overemphasize the need of
[49:15] revelation." Do you know that there's
[49:16] only one way to know God, and that's by
[49:19] revelation? Do you know God has a way to
[49:21] bring revelation, AND IT'S BY a prophet?
[49:24] Amen. And people say, "Well, Brother
[49:26] Wayne, I can't get this Godhead figured
[49:28] out, and we can't get it, and you know,
[49:30] we got to study the Greek, and we got to
[49:31] get the Hebrew, and we got to get it all
[49:33] straight." Listen. Amen. There's a lot
[49:35] of people a lot smarter than we are. And
[49:37] there's a lot of people with a lot
[49:38] better educations than we have and they
[49:41] still can't get it straight. So, it's
[49:43] going to take A REVELATION FROM GOD to
[49:45] straighten it out or it won't never get
[49:47] straightened out. Amen. I I love him for
[49:49] it. Don't you? Brother Bam said there
[49:50] was a fella come to him and he calls the
[49:52] name of the church. He said a Baptist
[49:54] man called him up. Brother Brham was a
[49:55] Baptist and and this Baptist fell called
[49:58] him up and he said, "Hey, Brother
[49:59] Brandham," he said, "Uh, he said, "I
[50:01] heard you talking about the Godhead. I
[50:02] need to come up and straighten you up on
[50:04] it." And he said, "When you got time,"
[50:05] Brother Brandham said, "Well, for that I
[50:07] got time right now."
[50:09] &gt;&gt; And that fell went up there and he said
[50:11] he got to talking to him and he said, "I
[50:12] just can't see how you can say there's
[50:14] just one God." And brother Brandham
[50:16] said, "Well," he said, "You got to let
[50:17] all your thinking go and just believe
[50:19] the word of God." And and the fell said,
[50:21] "Well, yeah." He said, "But even the
[50:23] greatest theologians can't figure that
[50:25] out." And brother Brandham says,
[50:27] "Because it comes by revelation." Amen.
[50:29] you you will never get a group of men to
[50:32] to to be able to teach this in a way
[50:34] that you can understand it. But it'll
[50:36] take the revelation for the Bible says a
[50:39] man can't call Jesus the Lord without
[50:42] the Holy Ghost. It would take the Holy
[50:44] Ghost to unveil the revelation of the
[50:46] Godhead to an individual. And of course
[50:48] that Baptist man said to brother Bram,
[50:50] he said, "I can't accept revelation."
[50:52] And brother Bam said, "Then there's no
[50:53] way for God to deal with you. then
[50:56] you've cut yourself off from God if you
[50:59] can't receive revelation. Now that's
[51:01] that's the the age that we're living in.
[51:03] Now you've got to realize that we are
[51:06] living in the age of revelation. Amen.
[51:09] This the age that we are living in now
[51:12] is the age of revelation. This is the
[51:14] unveiling of God. This is the ministry
[51:18] of the age was to unveil the God that
[51:20] had been hid through the ages but is to
[51:23] be unveiled in the LAST DAY. AND THAT
[51:25] unveiling would bring a faith, a divine
[51:27] faith within the church FOR THE CHANGE
[51:29] OF ITS BODY. AND WITHOUT REVELATION, WE
[51:31] AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. Without revelation,
[51:33] we ain't changing nothing. But with
[51:35] revelation, we have the ability, amen,
[51:38] to change in the moment, in the twinkle
[51:40] of AN EYE. BECAUSE EVERYTHING FROM THE
[51:42] NEW BIRTH TO THE CHANGE OF OUR BODY
[51:44] COMES through revelation. My goodness.
[51:47] Yes, sir. I believe that revelation is
[51:49] supremely important to every believer.
[51:51] And there is no other way to know God
[51:53] only by revelation. Amen. There is only
[51:56] one God manifested in the flesh. And
[51:58] that ought to settle it cuz God comes in
[52:00] a human form. Amen. They didn't they
[52:03] didn't make him another God. He was God.
[52:05] The same God. And it's a revelation then
[52:07] of how God can be one.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Now, somebody said, "Well, brother
[52:12] Wayne, amen. Back in those days, it was
[52:14] in the days of Paul. It was a
[52:16] revelation." Amen. And in our day, it's
[52:19] a revelation. And it will require
[52:21] revelation. Now, brother Brandon then
[52:24] says to us, we don't need a new Bible.
[52:27] We need revelation. You see what he was
[52:29] telling the the world that you don't
[52:32] need a new transcript. You don't need a
[52:34] Greek revelation. What you need is a
[52:36] prophet to come among you and to give
[52:39] the revelation. Amen. That would gather
[52:41] the bride and bring them rapture in
[52:43] faith. Well, I think we can announce it
[52:45] tonight. Amen. I think that we can say
[52:48] that that's not as something that's
[52:49] coming. Amen. I believe this day this
[52:52] scripture has been fulfilled and we have
[52:54] received of God in this generation.
[52:57] Amen. God sent it and we believe it and
[52:59] become a part of it by the grace of
[53:01] almighty God. Now this this idea of
[53:04] Melazdc, how many knows it's an end time
[53:07] revelation?
[53:09] &gt;&gt; So whatever you read about Melazdc up to
[53:11] the ministry of brother Brandham, Amen.
[53:13] I I hate to tell you but it's a lot of
[53:15] guessing. That's right. Come on.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's men guessing and poking in
[53:20] the dark of what they think it was. But
[53:23] according to the scripture, it would be
[53:25] revealed in the last day. Now, I say the
[53:27] scripture because in the book of Hebrews
[53:29] the 5th chapter when Paul is talking
[53:31] about Melkazedc and he says in the 11th
[53:34] verse of whom many I have many things to
[53:36] say, but being there hard to utter
[53:39] because you're dual of hearing. Now
[53:41] watch what he says. For when the time
[53:43] you ought to be teachers, you have need
[53:44] of one teach you again, the first
[53:46] principles of the oracles of God, Amen,
[53:49] become such as we have need of milk and
[53:51] not of strong meat. For everyone that
[53:54] useth the milk is unskillful, and the
[53:56] word of unrighteousness, for he has
[53:58] obeyed. But strong meat belongth to them
[54:01] that are of full age, even those by
[54:04] reason have their So strong meat
[54:06] belongth to full age. Now Paul is not
[54:09] trying to belittle the Hebrews. He's
[54:12] just saying that you're not ready to
[54:14] receive the revelation of what I got to
[54:16] say ABOUT MELAZDC. YOU'RE YOU'RE not
[54:19] going to be able to receive it in this
[54:20] age. Now, according to Paul in the same
[54:23] writer in Ephesians the 4th chapter, he
[54:25] also says that we would come into the
[54:27] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[54:29] the son of God and to a perfect man unto
[54:31] the measure of the stature of the
[54:33] fullness of Christ. So he is pointing to
[54:35] a future work of God in the church which
[54:38] brother Brandham pulled out in the
[54:40] stature of the perfect man and builds it
[54:42] up through the rainbow colors. Now now
[54:44] folks this whole Bible times time that
[54:46] just ties together because he builds it
[54:48] up through the rainbow colors right and
[54:50] then caps it off in the ledian age and
[54:53] brings down divine love which is the
[54:55] ministry of Jesus himself. NOW PAUL
[54:58] SPEAKING in Hebrews 5 says it's coming.
[55:00] In Hebrews 6, he introduces two seeds
[55:03] and lets you know that either you're the
[55:05] seed of God or you're seed of the devil.
[55:08] Come on, church. And when he gets done
[55:10] saying that, he gets very clear. And
[55:12] then he says, "But then God, Amen, made
[55:15] Abraham a promise." And when he did, HE
[55:17] SWORE BY HIMSELF. NOW, WHEN HE SWORE by
[55:19] himself, what's he talking about? HE
[55:22] DIDN'T SWEAR JUST BY any mask. HE DIDN'T
[55:24] SWEAR JUST BY ANY DISPENSATION. BUT THE
[55:27] GOD WHO ALWAYS WAS MADE A PROMISE UNTO
[55:30] ABRAHAM. AMEN. Now that God came in
[55:33] different forms and even appeared to
[55:35] Noah in colors.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Those same colors he
[55:39] appeared to Noah in in a promise is God
[55:42] put himself in the heavens and made a
[55:44] promise by himself to Noah. And that
[55:47] same God appears in Revelations the 10th
[55:49] chapter IN THE FIRST VERSE. THE MIGHTY
[55:51] ANGEL COMING OUT OF HEAVEN. AMEN. COMES
[55:54] WITH A rainbow about his head. And the
[55:57] same God THAT WAS TALKING TO PAUL IN
[55:59] HEBREWS 5 AND IN HEBREWS 6 OPENS UP
[56:02] HEBREWS 7, BUT IT'S NOT UNTIL
[56:04] REVELATIONS 10 THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND
[56:07] OUT IT ALL TIES TOGETHER. MY, we got a
[56:10] message, folks, that don't do away WITH
[56:12] THE BIBLE. IT TIES THE ENTIRE BIBLE
[56:14] TOGETHER. WE HAVE RECEIVED OF GOD IN
[56:17] THIS AGE THE REVELATION that's been
[56:19] promised to this dispensation. Amen.
[56:22] It's here we find out this seventh age,
[56:25] the whole story is going to be told for
[56:27] the first time. Amen. We've had a part.
[56:30] We've had people that told parts and and
[56:32] now you you're talking to a preacher
[56:34] tonight. Amen. That one of the great
[56:36] things that I believe is William
[56:37] Brandham preached what Paul preached.
[56:39] But Paul didn't preach all of what
[56:41] brother Brandham taught in the fullness
[56:43] of the revelation.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; You get what I'm saying? Paul said, "The
[56:47] Lord shall descend from heaven with a
[56:49] shout, voice, and trump." made it sound
[56:50] like it was one, didn't it? Brother Ram
[56:52] took it and expanded and showed you
[56:54] shout voice trump was three different
[56:56] things that come throughout the process
[56:58] of time. He preached what Paul preached,
[57:00] but he brought the clarity that Paul
[57:03] said would come in THE LAST DAYS. NOW,
[57:05] WHY DIDN'T it come in Paul's day? Why
[57:08] didn't it come in Luther's day? Because
[57:10] you wasn't here then. AND THERE WAS
[57:13] NOBODY ON THE EARTH THAT COULD
[57:15] COMPREHEND THE REVELATION THAT WAS GOING
[57:17] TO BE COMING. IT WOULD TAKE AN ATTRIBUTE
[57:19] OF GOD, AMEN, TO TO UNDERSTAND THE
[57:22] THINGS THAT GOD WAS going to bring in
[57:24] this age. Now, you're not intellectually
[57:26] going to understand all this. You know
[57:28] that.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; And intellectually, you might not
[57:31] remember all this, but there's something
[57:32] in you knows is right.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; There's something in you knows is right.
[57:38] When you hear it preached, something in
[57:40] you said, "Amen to the word of God."
[57:43] What is it? It's revelation. This whole
[57:45] thing has come together and God sent a
[57:48] prophet to unveil it.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I've often said it like this. You
[57:51] You take a You take a a book and Amen.
[57:54] And brother Brother Jonathan, you got a
[57:56] Bible? Hold your Bible up right there.
[57:57] Amen. Now, watch. Amen. This is a veiled
[58:00] work, right? This is a prophet. He
[58:03] unveiled that Bible. But what happened
[58:05] is when he unveiled the word, then a
[58:08] veil come over the person looking at the
[58:11] open word. So now the whole congregation
[58:14] sees an open book and one man can't see
[58:16] it. And the man that can't see it is
[58:19] trying to stop the men that can see it.
[58:21] AMEN. BUT IT'S STILL A REVEALED WORK.
[58:24] IT'S NOT HERE TONIGHT. WE'RE NOT HERE
[58:26] GUESSING AND AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[58:28] WHAT THIS thing means. We have HAD A
[58:30] PROPHET AMONG US. THERE'S A DIVINE
[58:33] REVELATION THAT HAS DROPPED INTO THIS
[58:35] AGE TO GIVE MEN AN ABSOLUTE THAT WE know
[58:38] what WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE KNOW WHERE
[58:40] WE'RE STANDING. WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE
[58:42] GOING. The veil has been taken off.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And I have refused. And you have
[58:48] refused. The veil of tradition that
[58:50] would recover the thing God unveiled.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Prophet said it means this. And somebody
[58:56] comes along and says, "It don't mean
[58:57] that." He put a veil on you if you don't
[58:58] refuse it.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Do you see that?
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And I'm not wearing any of the veils.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want no denominational
[59:05] veil.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The pillar of fire has literally
[59:08] come among us to unveil our eyes. Amen.
[59:12] That we might be able to see according
[59:14] to scriptures. Amen. That allowed to see
[59:17] an age. He said, I pray that you would
[59:20] pray that you get eyes to have that you
[59:22] might be able to see. Is that right? And
[59:24] brother said it's going to take more
[59:25] than congre in this age. Amen. We're
[59:27] going to have to HAVE THE HOLY GHOST,
[59:29] THE FIRE OF GOD. Come on, friends. And
[59:32] brother man said he's going to have to
[59:33] come into the heart to heal your
[59:35] blindness because there's a door in your
[59:37] heart that would keep you from seeing.
[59:39] Your faith will keep you from seeing
[59:40] what is. But if the Holy Ghost gets in
[59:43] that door, it'll open the faith side and
[59:46] you'll be able to see exactly what God
[59:49] was spoken up in this age. We're not
[59:51] waiting for a prophet to speak it. It's
[59:53] been spoken.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it is? He has come
[59:57] here to change hearts, to unveil God.
[1:00:00] Amen. Now, if he's unveiling him, what
[1:00:03] is he unveiling him as? Amen. He was
[1:00:06] unveiled as Jesus in that day, but he is
[1:00:09] unveiled as the bride in this day. As
[1:00:12] Jesus was the Old Testament fulfillment
[1:00:15] of the promises, this bride is the
[1:00:17] fulfillment of the New Testament
[1:00:19] promises. She is a living, walking,
[1:00:22] written epistle of almighty God. Not two
[1:00:25] tables of stone. Amen. with the fleshly
[1:00:28] tables of heart written by the pillar of
[1:00:30] fire in this age to manifest all that
[1:00:33] God has given. We don't have any excuses
[1:00:35] tonight friends. We have received the
[1:00:37] divine will of God that we might walk
[1:00:39] into them in this age. Now I find out
[1:00:42] that God is changing mask. That's the
[1:00:45] promise and that's the thing he is
[1:00:47] doing. Now, if you how many how many you
[1:00:50] ever played in a film or not a film, but
[1:00:52] in a in a in a play or some little
[1:00:55] Christmas thing or some little fil uh
[1:00:57] little little thing you have and and you
[1:00:59] know, when I was in high school, I
[1:01:00] played I played in a in a high school uh
[1:01:02] play and and I played two different
[1:01:04] guys, you know, I don't know how I got
[1:01:06] away with that, but I did it anyhow, but
[1:01:08] I played two different guys, but I was
[1:01:10] the same person in both acts. Now, now
[1:01:13] when you when you start making a an act,
[1:01:16] let's just say that you're going to play
[1:01:18] uh you're going to play a certain
[1:01:19] person, then you have to study the
[1:01:21] character, you have to study the role,
[1:01:23] you have to study what they do, and then
[1:01:25] you step into that and you become
[1:01:28] somebody you're not because you're
[1:01:30] acting out something. But in the case of
[1:01:33] this word I'm talking about, you're not
[1:01:35] acting out somebody else's role. Amen.
[1:01:38] You're now putting on who you originally
[1:01:42] were to begin with, but it was not
[1:01:45] revealed to this day.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now God does not move from
[1:01:52] person to person. He moves from mask to
[1:01:55] mask.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; God does not change from personality to
[1:01:58] personality. That's not the way God
[1:02:00] changes. God changes the mask, but not
[1:02:03] the person. He changes the mask, but not
[1:02:06] the attitude. He changes the mask, but
[1:02:09] he does not change who he is. And if he
[1:02:12] was something in another day, amen. The
[1:02:15] principal theme of this Bible is he is
[1:02:17] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:02:21] Y'all know that's the way brother Bam
[1:02:22] picked the church age messengers, right?
[1:02:24] Because he's the same yesterday and
[1:02:26] forever. So he could go through the ages
[1:02:28] and pick the messengers that didn't
[1:02:30] change the personality of God. Do you
[1:02:32] see? There it is. And God promised in
[1:02:35] this day in this layout as soon church
[1:02:37] he would take the the the the mask off
[1:02:39] of the whole thing.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; It would be that we would see it God
[1:02:44] immorate
[1:02:47] in a man called Jesus. God immorate in
[1:02:50] his church. God above us. God with us.
[1:02:53] God in us. It's the condescending God.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's exactly what he's doing is
[1:03:00] it was God who was above us. It was God
[1:03:03] who was with us. Now it's God that is in
[1:03:07] us. It's the Holy Spirit. Now notice
[1:03:11] those of you that have eternal life was
[1:03:15] with him and in his thinking before
[1:03:18] there was an angel, a star, a cherubam,
[1:03:21] or anything else. I I tell you what, you
[1:03:24] could just stop and preach a month right
[1:03:25] there.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Before there was an angel, well, the
[1:03:27] devil is an angel, isn't he? He's a
[1:03:30] fallen angel. But before he was fallen,
[1:03:31] he was a created angel. He was a cherub
[1:03:33] in heaven. Amen. And God created you. He
[1:03:37] was in his mind before that devil was
[1:03:40] ever created. And when the devil ain't
[1:03:42] no more, will still be in the presence
[1:03:44] of God. Because that which is eternal,
[1:03:47] if you have eternal life, you always
[1:03:50] was.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Now, not your being here, but the shape
[1:03:55] and the form of the infinite God. Now,
[1:03:59] who has eternal life in here tonight?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that beautiful? Your eternal
[1:04:04] life don't begin in heaven, but eternal
[1:04:07] life begins in the new birth. That that
[1:04:09] gene that's in you born again, there is
[1:04:12] that eternal life. And brother Bam says,
[1:04:14] "Now watch." He says, "Now we find him
[1:04:16] at the beginning, his attributes, and
[1:04:19] now you were with him then. Then is when
[1:04:22] the book of life comes into view."
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we read over in Revelation 13
[1:04:28] and8 that of course is the lamb's book
[1:04:30] of life. And brother Bam said, "Now
[1:04:32] think of this. Before Jesus was born,
[1:04:34] 4,000 years before he came on the earth,
[1:04:38] that Jesus in God's mind died for you."
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And the book of life was made and your
[1:04:45] name was on the book of life before the
[1:04:48] foundation of the world. That's the
[1:04:49] Bible truth. Your name was ordained of
[1:04:52] God and placed on the book of life
[1:04:55] before the foundation of the world. You
[1:04:57] were there in his attributes. Amen. Now,
[1:05:01] I don't want to put on a class, but can
[1:05:02] you say it with me? Attributes. Amen. I
[1:05:05] don't know if I pronounce it right, but
[1:05:06] you know what I mean. Amen. You were
[1:05:08] there in his attributes. You don't
[1:05:10] remember it because you're a part of his
[1:05:13] life.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; See, you're a part of God when you
[1:05:17] become a son or daughter of God. Now,
[1:05:19] notice you were there in his attributes
[1:05:21] and you don't remember it. Now, I've
[1:05:23] used this a few times throughout the
[1:05:24] years cuz I don't know a better way to
[1:05:26] say it. Amen. Is that there's things
[1:05:28] that are true you don't remember. You
[1:05:30] you can agree to that. Amen. And if you
[1:05:32] know your birthday, then you're you're
[1:05:34] admitting that you tell things for truth
[1:05:37] that you don't personally remember. You
[1:05:39] don't remember being born. You don't
[1:05:40] remember the day. You don't remember
[1:05:41] what it's like. Your mama remembers all
[1:05:44] that. And your mama uh uh speaks of it,
[1:05:47] but she writes it down. and and they
[1:05:49] they talk about the first steps you made
[1:05:51] and all those things and you'll tell it
[1:05:53] like you were there like you have memory
[1:05:56] of being there but you really don't but
[1:05:59] you're adopting the memory of your
[1:06:01] mother as your own memory. Amen. And the
[1:06:03] prophet is telling you you were actually
[1:06:06] there. You don't remember it. But I have
[1:06:10] been sent from God to give you a memory
[1:06:13] of where you was before you was here.
[1:06:16] Thank God we can trust that that prophet
[1:06:19] knew more than just an educated man or
[1:06:22] an intellectual man. It's a
[1:06:24] pre-incarnate knowledge of where we was
[1:06:27] AND A VINDICATED VOICE IS SAYING YOU
[1:06:29] WERE THERE.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Then you're adopting the
[1:06:33] word for your memory.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you remember the
[1:06:37] future. Amen. You adopt the word for
[1:06:39] your memory. Now if if you if you watch
[1:06:42] the scriptures this Mazdc now who he is
[1:06:45] is going to appear in this revelation.
[1:06:48] Now this one revelation of Melkazdc is
[1:06:50] going to fit over your life in a lot of
[1:06:52] ways but this Mazdc revelation. Now
[1:06:55] let's break into it in John chapter 1.
[1:06:58] Amen. Let's pull up the first verse. For
[1:07:00] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:07:03] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:07:07] Now you you watch this. John begins the
[1:07:10] Bible begins his verses by saying in the
[1:07:13] beginning was the word. Brother Brandham
[1:07:16] goes to this scripture. He said what was
[1:07:18] before the beginning then?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; He now you got to answer that before you
[1:07:23] can answer who Melazdc is. He said what
[1:07:27] was it before the beginning? He said do
[1:07:30] you see when you worship God the English
[1:07:33] word God means an object of worship. So
[1:07:35] maybe it could be a piano. Maybe it
[1:07:36] could be your husband, your job, because
[1:07:39] it just means an object of worship.
[1:07:41] Amen. But our God is known as Elohim,
[1:07:46] which is self-existent, right? Amen. So
[1:07:48] the God we're talking about is a
[1:07:50] self-existent one. In other words, he
[1:07:53] existed before there was anything.
[1:07:55] Before there was a beginning, before
[1:07:57] there was a word, there was Elohim. And
[1:08:00] before the beginning, there was Elohim.
[1:08:03] And in Elohim was attributes. And in
[1:08:06] those attributes, you were right there
[1:08:08] IN THAT ATTRIBUTE. THE SAME AS JESUS
[1:08:11] CHRIST WAS in the attribute. You were in
[1:08:14] the attribute. Amen. Who you are, what
[1:08:16] you were going to be, everything about
[1:08:18] you was in God before the first word was
[1:08:22] ever spoken. You were already in the
[1:08:25] life source of almighty God. Woo. Glory
[1:08:28] to God. Think about tonight. In the
[1:08:31] beginning was the word. So number one
[1:08:34] was the attribute stage of God. Jesus
[1:08:37] himself the our savior Jesus was in the
[1:08:41] attribute of God. Now the second part of
[1:08:44] that says in the beginning was the word.
[1:08:47] Now the word is where God began to go
[1:08:50] toward mankind. The word brother in
[1:08:52] questions and answers on Genesis says
[1:08:54] there it was. He said that little halo
[1:08:56] of light come out of God and begin to
[1:08:58] soar around. He said there it was in the
[1:09:01] beginning was the word. Let there be
[1:09:03] light. Amen. Now, we know that's not the
[1:09:05] sun, the moon. They're created a little
[1:09:07] later, but this is the existence of God
[1:09:10] moving toward humanity in the form of
[1:09:13] the pillar of fire. Amen. Now, God
[1:09:15] hadn't changed any, but he started to
[1:09:17] become a have a mass that you could see
[1:09:19] the visible presence, but it was just a
[1:09:21] mass that the same God that was in the
[1:09:23] attribute was hiding behind that fire.
[1:09:26] Are you with me? HE WAS HIDING behind
[1:09:28] that fire, and he was known as the word.
[1:09:31] Now we could we could say in the
[1:09:32] beginning was the theophony and the
[1:09:35] theophony was go of God and the
[1:09:36] theophony was God because brother Bam
[1:09:38] said watch in the beginning was the
[1:09:40] word. That was the second stage God took
[1:09:43] toward man. It's called the word. It's a
[1:09:46] theophonic form of God. This is the form
[1:09:49] he appeared in when he talked to Moses
[1:09:52] at the rock. This is the form he was in
[1:09:54] when he was the burning bush. Amen. That
[1:09:57] Moses met on the mountain. This is the
[1:09:59] form he was in when he met Abraham.
[1:10:02] Every time he met him, when Noah met
[1:10:04] him, when Job met him, when he saw the
[1:10:06] wilder, that God appeared throughout the
[1:10:08] Old Testament in a theophonic form. But
[1:10:11] in the 14th verse, John said, "In the
[1:10:14] beginning was the word, and the word was
[1:10:15] with God. But then the word BECAME
[1:10:18] FLESH, AND GOD begot his own son, Jesus
[1:10:22] Christ." Now, friends, I'll tell you
[1:10:24] what a powerful reality. Three things.
[1:10:27] Three things, brother Josiah. Attribute,
[1:10:29] word, flesh. Attribute, word, flesh. You
[1:10:32] can teach the entire mystery of
[1:10:34] Melchazdc from John. Attribute, word,
[1:10:37] flesh. Now, well, you say, "BROTHER
[1:10:38] WAYNE, WHY is it important?" Because you
[1:10:41] need to realize there is a difference
[1:10:43] between you and Jesus Christ. Jesus went
[1:10:46] from attribute to the word to the flesh.
[1:10:49] You bypassed the word and went from the
[1:10:52] attribute to the flesh. Amen. So if
[1:10:56] you're going to know what you're missing
[1:10:57] is you're missing the word. Come on
[1:11:00] church. Then music ain't going TO PUT US
[1:11:02] BACK. Intellectuals ain't going TO PUT
[1:11:04] US BACK. JUST PRAISE AND WORSHIP AIN'T
[1:11:07] GOING TO PUT US BACK. BATH AND LUTHERAN
[1:11:10] AND METHODIST message are not going TO
[1:11:11] PUT US BACK. IT'LL take the word.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; WE MISS THE WORD. SO WE MISS the word.
[1:11:18] WE GOT TO GO BACK BY THE WORD.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Now now you see then the attribute Amen.
[1:11:24] itself is being expressed and then
[1:11:27] secondarily he became the word and then
[1:11:30] the word became flesh.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why when Paul says
[1:11:36] he was like unto the son of God because
[1:11:39] it was the word created a body of flesh
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; and talked to Abraham.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't a begotten body.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; It was a created body. It had not come
[1:11:51] through the womb of a woman in a fallen
[1:11:54] state. Amen. It He was only a borrowed
[1:11:57] vessel, a created body. I hope you're
[1:11:59] hearing me. Amen. Because that is
[1:12:01] exactly what Jesus pointed at when he
[1:12:04] pointed at the sign of the Messiah.
[1:12:07] First, he was spirit God. Second, see,
[1:12:09] he began to be a theophony and then he
[1:12:12] became flesh. He met he met Abraham in
[1:12:16] the form of the word.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way he met him. And see
[1:12:22] tonight. Amen. Then before the word was
[1:12:25] attribute, that's where you were.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; That's where you were. People say,
[1:12:30] "Well, I was a part of God." Do you see?
[1:12:32] Then you you wasn't just like a human
[1:12:34] walking around in heaven. You were a
[1:12:37] part of the attribute of God in his
[1:12:40] life, in his thinking. Amen. And watch
[1:12:43] what he says. Now, we see the attribute
[1:12:45] sons of his spirit have not yet entered
[1:12:48] into the word form. That's right. Not
[1:12:50] into the theophony. They bypassed that.
[1:12:52] Right. Amen. Now, the difference between
[1:12:54] you and him as a son. He at the
[1:12:56] beginning was the word, an immortal
[1:12:58] body. And you, he came and lived in the
[1:13:01] person of Mazdc. Now, later you don't
[1:13:03] hear about mezazedc because he comes
[1:13:05] Jesus Christ, right? Amen. See, but you
[1:13:08] bypass that.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; You bypass that with this natural birth.
[1:13:14] Now, I think it's powerful. Amen.
[1:13:16] Because it means if I bypassed it then I
[1:13:19] must have one.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; If I bypassed it then there must be
[1:13:22] something for me. Amen. But you see you
[1:13:25] bypassed it. Amen. And come into this
[1:13:28] earth. Amen. In a fallen condition of
[1:13:31] your birth. Now there is where all of
[1:13:33] your problems started. Listen you would
[1:13:35] have never had the first problem had you
[1:13:38] went from attribute to word and then to
[1:13:40] flesh. But because you bypassed the word
[1:13:43] you got all of these issues. Wasn't born
[1:13:45] in Eden. is born in Leodysa and you were
[1:13:48] born through all kinds of of of trouble.
[1:13:51] Amen. And matter of fact, the attribute
[1:13:53] that's born is so much God, but the body
[1:13:55] itself ain't.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; The human body it's born into. Matter of
[1:13:59] fact, many people are trying to
[1:14:01] disqualify people from the rapture
[1:14:04] because of the way their human body come
[1:14:06] in the earth. Amen. A an attribute son
[1:14:09] could be born in a fallen condition, but
[1:14:12] there is no condition you could be born
[1:14:14] into that God couldn't redeem you from.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's a question they
[1:14:20] asked brother Bham about illegitimate
[1:14:21] children. And brother Bam said, "I see
[1:14:23] how they could be uh uh how they could
[1:14:25] be uh uh saved but not in the rapture."
[1:14:27] Amen. And and he says this and then they
[1:14:29] go to brother Bandom, Sister Dalton,
[1:14:31] Brother Jim Dalton's mother, and asked
[1:14:33] Brother Bandom about that because she
[1:14:35] had some illegitimacy in their family.
[1:14:37] maybe her dad or somebody. And she asked
[1:14:39] Brother Bam directly about that
[1:14:41] question. And Brother Bam sat down and
[1:14:43] pinned an answer and said, "Sister
[1:14:45] Dalton, I want you to know that by
[1:14:47] Adam's fall, we are all illegitimate
[1:14:50] children,
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; but through the second birth, we are
[1:14:54] made legitimate sons by JESUS CHRIST."
[1:14:57] LISTEN FRIENDS, WE ALL WAS BORN INTO A
[1:15:01] FLESH THAT WAS FALLEN. AND THIS FLESH IS
[1:15:04] A FAILURE. BUT THERE IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF
[1:15:07] GOD ON THE INSIDE OF THAT FLESH. AND THE
[1:15:10] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR CAME AFTER THAT
[1:15:12] ATTRIBUTE. He didn't come after your
[1:15:15] genetics. He didn't come after AMEN YOUR
[1:15:18] CHILD BIRTH AND YOUR CHILD NAME AND AND
[1:15:20] the school you went to or the home
[1:15:22] you're born into. He come after the gene
[1:15:25] OF GOD THAT'S LAID DOWN INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:15:28] THANK GOD THERE'S AN ATTRIBUTE OF GOD on
[1:15:30] the inside of believers today. Amen.
[1:15:33] That means that you are redeemable.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you what, a beautiful
[1:15:39] thing. Brother Bam said he came to be a
[1:15:41] redeemer.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; He came to be a redeemer.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; And what does redeemer means? He says it
[1:15:47] means to bring back.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what was what was wrong with that
[1:15:51] priest when Jesus met him and he
[1:15:53] couldn't take him back cuz he didn't
[1:15:55] come from there. And Jesus was exactly
[1:15:58] the word. But finally Jesus said, "You
[1:16:00] don't receive me cuz I you got no place
[1:16:02] in you for me. My my word don't have no
[1:16:05] place. You didn't bypass the word
[1:16:08] because you wasn't there to start with."
[1:16:10] But had you bypassed the word, then my
[1:16:12] ministry would redeem you back to what
[1:16:15] you were. Now I I think it's powerful
[1:16:17] because that man had never been in the
[1:16:20] thinking of God or the word could have
[1:16:22] took it back to the thinking of God.
[1:16:25] That's why the woman at the well could
[1:16:27] easily believe when the Pharisee
[1:16:30] couldn't believe. She was in a worse
[1:16:32] moral state, but she was in a better
[1:16:35] spiritual state because she had
[1:16:37] something to represent her in the
[1:16:40] presence of almighty God. She had been
[1:16:42] in the thinking of God. Woo! Glory to
[1:16:46] God. Brother Bam said in the third seal
[1:16:49] that light struck that seed that had
[1:16:51] been laying there that was spoke by God.
[1:16:54] That seed in you, Amen, lays there that
[1:16:57] God himself placed in you. That seed was
[1:17:00] on earth and when God moved the water
[1:17:01] away, the sun hits it and it comes right
[1:17:03] up. Brother talking about the questions
[1:17:05] and answers in Genesis and he said there
[1:17:07] were seeds laying beneath the waters
[1:17:09] that was on the earth. Earth was out
[1:17:10] form and void and darkness would cover
[1:17:12] the earth. Now look at the condition
[1:17:14] folks. Darkness covered the face of the
[1:17:16] deep. The earth was without form or void
[1:17:18] and waters was just covering the thing.
[1:17:21] But there was a seed under there. There
[1:17:23] was a seed under there. And when God
[1:17:26] began to shine light, it struck a seed.
[1:17:30] And a seed produced life. IT DOESN'T
[1:17:32] MATTER HOW DARK THE WATERS. IT DOESN'T
[1:17:35] MATTER THE GENE POOL THAT YOU WERE BORN
[1:17:38] INTO. COME ON, LILY. IT DON'T MATTER THE
[1:17:41] POND YOU WERE BIRTHED IN. BUT WHEN THE
[1:17:43] LIGHT STRIKES THE SEED, THERE'S
[1:17:45] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT'S
[1:17:47] GOING TO RESPOND BECAUSE YOU GOT
[1:17:50] SOMETHING TO RESPOND WITH. I tell you
[1:17:52] tonight, if you can amen THE MESSAGE OF
[1:17:55] THE HOUR, YOU OUGHT TO JUST THANK GOD
[1:17:57] THAT THERE'S A BLESSING in your life
[1:17:59] that you can LOVE THIS MESSAGE. I DON'T
[1:18:01] CARE WHETHER YOU GOT A GOOD CAR OR A
[1:18:04] GOOD HOUSE. THERE'S A SEED ON THE INSIDE
[1:18:07] THAT CAN AMEN THE WORD OF GOD, BROTHER.
[1:18:09] WHEN THE CARS ARE GONE AND WHEN THE
[1:18:11] HOUSES ARE GONE AND WHEN THE WORLD HAS
[1:18:13] FELL APART, WE'LL SET INTO THE PRESENCE
[1:18:16] OF THE LIVING GOD. BECAUSE WE CAME FROM
[1:18:19] GOD, WE CAN GO BACK [screaming] TO GOD.
[1:18:21] HEY, IT'S GOD redeeming what belongs to
[1:18:24] him.
[1:18:26] [applause]
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the Holy Spirit will
[1:18:30] take that and dry that water and quicken
[1:18:32] that seed. He'll penetrate.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Hey, I I you you you bring me the
[1:18:38] condition. And I'll show you scriptural
[1:18:40] answer.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I I I can't because ain't nobody
[1:18:44] worshshiping that woman that well.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And how many times did brother Brown use
[1:18:50] that as an example
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; to show you it wasn't the condition. It
[1:18:55] wasn't the education. It wasn't the
[1:18:57] religion, it wasn't the moral setting,
[1:19:00] it was the seed and the sign. THE LIGHT
[1:19:04] STRUCK THE SEED AND SATAN. Hold it no
[1:19:07] more,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; brother. I tell you. Amen. I know what
[1:19:11] I'm talking about. That's the way he
[1:19:13] brought fishermen and woodsman and
[1:19:15] farmers and tax collectors and harlots.
[1:19:17] They seen what the scripture said it
[1:19:19] would do it doing it and they came to
[1:19:22] it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. So, Brother Wayne, why is
[1:19:26] it that they did it so easy and others
[1:19:28] find it so hard? I I'll answer it with
[1:19:30] Peter. Brother Bam says, he said to him,
[1:19:32] "Your name is Simon and your father's
[1:19:34] name was Jonas." He said, "That deflated
[1:19:36] that fisherman." He said, "That little
[1:19:39] eternal life seed struck."
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; That little eternal life seed might have
[1:19:47] been the smallest thing about you. It
[1:19:50] might be invisible to the naked eye, but
[1:19:52] the moment the light strikes it, you'll
[1:19:54] know it's there because it'll begin to
[1:19:56] awaken changes on the inside. See, you
[1:19:59] you you didn't know about it,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; but that that the message is touching
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; came from God before angels and cherabs
[1:20:08] and the world.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; It is eternal
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and it's laying inside you.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And the message come to discover where
[1:20:16] is that?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Where is that hidden in human beings? He
[1:20:21] wasn't looking at conditions. He was
[1:20:23] searching for the seed.
[1:20:26] Now, Brother Ram says that you're sons
[1:20:27] and daughters of God before sun, star,
[1:20:30] moon, anything. You're only the physical
[1:20:32] manifestation of the attribute that was
[1:20:34] in God at the beginning. Only one form
[1:20:37] of eternal life, and that was you.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; You don't know nothing about it. And
[1:20:41] there it is again. You didn't know when
[1:20:43] you was in your earthly father, but you
[1:20:46] are manifested in his image.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; There it is. See, and therefore, as sure
[1:20:51] as your a gene had to be in your father
[1:20:55] before your natural birth, your
[1:20:57] spiritual gene had to be in God.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You I I did some study on
[1:21:04] this the other day on this word gene.
[1:21:06] And and up till the mid-40s, it was just
[1:21:08] a name, brother. It was some It was some
[1:21:09] brother's name, Jean. Amen. But in the
[1:21:12] mid 40s, there was a lot of discoveries
[1:21:14] in the DNA world. And they begin to dis
[1:21:17] discover the traits and the existence of
[1:21:20] DNA and they started naming it gene. And
[1:21:24] brother Brandon starts using this word
[1:21:26] other than a name. He starts using it in
[1:21:29] the late 60s. Now, now it's it's it
[1:21:31] don't make much sense until you really
[1:21:34] realize the the implications that he's
[1:21:37] placing this is he's saying that God had
[1:21:40] a gene in him the same as your father
[1:21:42] has a gene in you. Amen. Now, now what
[1:21:44] that means is hey man that now now there
[1:21:47] there's a lot of discoveries and I won't
[1:21:48] preach all this but I I'm just going to
[1:21:50] place this in here that a gene basically
[1:21:54] is what covers carries the traits like
[1:21:56] if you're going to be tall you're going
[1:21:58] to be skinny you're going to be beh have
[1:22:00] hair not have hair uh I if you're going
[1:22:03] to have brown eyes black eyes if you're
[1:22:05] going to be a human all that's in a
[1:22:07] trait like that's the trait of your
[1:22:08] father you somebody said well I've seen
[1:22:10] you laugh and you look like your dad
[1:22:11] that trait come through a gene
[1:22:13] Okay, you call it a gene, but a gene is
[1:22:16] only is only a section of DNA, Amen,
[1:22:19] that's wrapped in the chromosomes of
[1:22:21] your life. Now, every molecule in your
[1:22:23] body, Amen, has molecules are real
[1:22:26] small, aren't they? Inside the inside of
[1:22:29] your molecule is something called a
[1:22:30] nucleus. And inside of the nucleus is a
[1:22:32] DNA. A collection of those DNAs are
[1:22:35] called genes, which carry the traits.
[1:22:38] They're wrapped in chromosomes which you
[1:22:40] have 23 from your mama and 23 from your
[1:22:43] daddy. So those chromosomes are laying
[1:22:46] there. If you took the DNA and you
[1:22:48] unstrung it off of those chromosomes,
[1:22:51] they say you could take it and stretch
[1:22:53] it to the sun and back 60 times. That's
[1:22:57] how many that's that's how long the DNA
[1:23:00] is in your life. That records the traits
[1:23:04] of your life. So what you what's that
[1:23:06] mean? It means when you eat a bite of
[1:23:07] food that your food don't say what you
[1:23:10] are, your genes says what you are. So
[1:23:12] your genetics, your DNA actually
[1:23:15] actually copies the food that comes in
[1:23:18] your body and takes the 23 amino I think
[1:23:20] it's 23 amino acids. Nine of them are
[1:23:22] essential. Amen. They actually come from
[1:23:24] things you take in. And when you take in
[1:23:26] that food, your DNA says this amino acid
[1:23:29] goes with this amino acid. this goes
[1:23:31] this many and puts it together and it
[1:23:33] forms a tissue which forms organs which
[1:23:36] forms follicules of hair and eyes and so
[1:23:38] every bit of that is controlled by
[1:23:41] what's inside you and it tells the food
[1:23:44] what to build in you now now now listen
[1:23:48] folks I'm saying that because I could
[1:23:50] eat all the food I want to eat and I'll
[1:23:52] never be as tall as Josiah
[1:23:55] look a dog could eat a steak every night
[1:23:58] right beside you and it'll still be a
[1:24:00] dog when it gets it's done.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; But a dog has DNA same as you have DNA.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; But your DNA is a is a higher species
[1:24:08] and it has a way to develop the foods
[1:24:11] you eat. So they have now what they call
[1:24:12] gene expression. And there's certain
[1:24:15] foods you can eat that can unlock
[1:24:17] certain genetics that's in your body.
[1:24:20] And you could get healthier. You could
[1:24:21] get Amen. You can get uh maybe quicker
[1:24:23] thinking. And it has to do with the
[1:24:25] foods you're eating. But you can never
[1:24:28] add to those genes. The genes are in you
[1:24:31] through a birth through your mama and
[1:24:33] your daddy. Come on church. And God put
[1:24:36] his traits in you through a genetics of
[1:24:40] his word by an attribute and sent the
[1:24:43] message. Come on now. Somebody else can
[1:24:46] eat who's this mechazedc. Amen. And it
[1:24:49] don't change them a bit. But when you
[1:24:51] pull in who's this Melkisedc unveiling
[1:24:53] OF GOD POWER TRANSFORMATION ALL OF A
[1:24:56] SUDDEN IT STARTS UNLOCKING GENETIC
[1:24:58] EXPRESSIONS AND YOU FIND THAT YOU'RE A
[1:25:01] DIFFERENT PERSON BECAUSE OF THE FOOD
[1:25:03] YOU'RE EATING BUT IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS
[1:25:06] A GENE in you to begin with. If you
[1:25:09] wasn't an attribute you can eat the same
[1:25:12] message but it will never touch your
[1:25:13] life.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh, the grace of God had put
[1:25:20] something in you that knows what to do
[1:25:22] with this word. YOUR INSIDES. AMEN. YOU
[1:25:26] YOU you've [laughter]
[1:25:27] never eat a sandwich and and and said to
[1:25:29] yourself, "Now you bread molecule, you
[1:25:32] get over that ham and you take a hold of
[1:25:34] the dairy, that cheese, and y'all go fix
[1:25:36] my lung. You just eat it and it
[1:25:38] happens."
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; You just come to church and the pastor
[1:25:44] starts preaching.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. Don't you ever
[1:25:46] underestimate a good sermon.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Bram said there's a
[1:25:50] development of a body in you. And he
[1:25:52] says, "And God will call a man to the
[1:25:54] pull pit to preach the vitamins you have
[1:25:56] need of." [laughter]
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And you know when you know when you're
[1:26:00] really needing something is when you got
[1:26:01] strange appetite.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And that's true. Amen. And whenever the
[1:26:07] strangest of that appetite pulls for the
[1:26:09] message and that preacher starts
[1:26:10] preaching, Amen. things start happen to
[1:26:12] you. Now what the devil will do is get
[1:26:14] you on your memory. I've got more people
[1:26:15] come up to me said, "Brother Wayne, I
[1:26:17] wish I could remember all them quotes
[1:26:18] you use." Amen. But you know, listen,
[1:26:20] it's not so important that you remember
[1:26:22] it. It's real important you eat it.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; I say this guy said to his wife one time
[1:26:28] said, "I I'm I'm going to quit church."
[1:26:29] And they went down to the pastor's house
[1:26:31] said, "I'm going to quit church." Said,
[1:26:32] "What are you going to quit for?" He
[1:26:33] said, "I've been coming to this church
[1:26:34] 20 years." He said, "I can't tell you
[1:26:36] sermons you preached for 20 years. I
[1:26:38] barely can remember what you preached
[1:26:39] last Sunday." Said, "I don't even know
[1:26:40] what no good this doing for me." And
[1:26:42] fella kind of looked over at the man's
[1:26:44] wife. He said, "Well," he said, "Uh," he
[1:26:46] said, "Uh, is that your cook there?" And
[1:26:48] he said, "Yeah." He said, and he asked
[1:26:49] him how old he was, and he's like 50, 60
[1:26:51] years old, however old he was. And he
[1:26:53] said, "Well," he said, he said, "Do you
[1:26:55] remember what you had for breakfast last
[1:26:57] year?" He said, "No." He said, "Remember
[1:26:58] what you had for supper?" Like, no. He
[1:27:00] said, "You remember last week?" He said,
[1:27:01] "No." He said, "See, it's not so
[1:27:03] important that you remember the food you
[1:27:04] ate, but it's real important you eat it
[1:27:07] because your life is coming from what
[1:27:09] you're eating." And listen, it's not
[1:27:11] that you can remember every scripture or
[1:27:13] you can remember every verse, but
[1:27:15] there's a gene in you that when you hear
[1:27:18] the message of the hour, IT IS
[1:27:20] DEVELOPING A CHRISTLIKE NATURE ON THE
[1:27:22] INSIDE OF YOU. AND THE BAPTIST MESSAGE
[1:27:25] IS NOT BRIDE FOOD.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IT'LL TAKE THE OPENING
[1:27:30] OF THE WORD BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE.
[1:27:33] You're here. That's why you crave this
[1:27:35] message. Come on, friends. That boy
[1:27:38] sucked on that bicycle pedal because he
[1:27:41] missed something in his birth and you
[1:27:43] missed something in your birth. You'll
[1:27:45] come off the lamb's BOOK OF LIFE AND NOW
[1:27:47] YOU HAVE TURNED BACK TO THIS MESSAGE AND
[1:27:49] IT MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE MUD TO SOMEBODY
[1:27:52] else but to you and me it's a lifegiving
[1:27:54] source that's opening the genetics.
[1:27:57] Oh, glory to God. I'M A SON OF GOD FROM
[1:28:01] THE INSIDE OUT. BROTHER,
[1:28:03] you can't you can't tell me I'm not.
[1:28:06] I was in the loins of God
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; before there was a speck of stardust.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; That was what was going on with that
[1:28:13] girl. She was existing in God's
[1:28:16] thoughts.
[1:28:17] And brother Brown said, "There it is.
[1:28:20] There's eternal life, the eternal
[1:28:22] thoughts of God." Let me ask you, are
[1:28:24] the thoughts of God eternal?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; If you can see that, you can see many
[1:28:28] things. [snorts]
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Now, God ain't adding to his knowledge
[1:28:32] now or ever. Was he ever? Now you say,
[1:28:36] "Preacher, why you say this?" Because
[1:28:38] the predestinate is the only thing
[1:28:39] considered redemption.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; If this message come for redemption and
[1:28:44] it came to you,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; listen, God didn't send the mail to the
[1:28:47] wrong address.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; God has never missed.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And if that message was directed to your
[1:28:54] address, it's because something
[1:28:56] redeemable was inside there. He come
[1:28:58] right down to your address. And brother
[1:29:00] Bam would tell him, "You live on this
[1:29:01] street, your name is this." cuz he
[1:29:03] didn't want to miss the mail that God
[1:29:05] was sending to him. This message came to
[1:29:08] you because THERE WAS SOMETHING IN YOU
[1:29:10] THAT GOD WAS TRYING TO GET BACK THAT
[1:29:13] BELONGS to him.
[1:29:15] When you start realizing that word
[1:29:16] redeemed means to be brought back, then
[1:29:18] ain't nothing can keep you from it.
[1:29:20] Amen. That's why Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:29:23] stands there and talks about that little
[1:29:24] eagle and he said when mama eagle
[1:29:26] screamed, I boy, that'd be a preaching
[1:29:28] thought tonight, wouldn't it? When that
[1:29:29] mama eagle screamed, baby eagle heard it
[1:29:31] and responded because it was an eagle.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Its grandpa was an eagle. Its great
[1:29:37] grandpa was an eagle. He He could have
[1:29:39] said, "Oh, thank you, Lord, for changing
[1:29:41] me from a chicken to an eagle." That
[1:29:44] would have been a false doctrine. And
[1:29:46] the next morning, he got up and couldn't
[1:29:47] fly AS HIGH AS MAMA. AND HE SAID, "OH, I
[1:29:50] DON'T KNOW IF I'M AN eagle anymore." He
[1:29:52] was eagle TO BEGIN WITH. HE'S ALWAYS
[1:29:55] EAGLE. HE WAS JUST IN THE WRONG PLACE.
[1:29:58] And your birth put you IN THE WRONG
[1:30:00] PLACE. BUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS
[1:30:04] COME TO REDEEM YOU BACK TO WHAT God has
[1:30:07] called and thought of you. Hallelujah.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Talk about food.
[1:30:13] Where the carcass is there, the eagles
[1:30:15] are going to gather together. Brother
[1:30:17] Bam, what is the eagles? Believers,
[1:30:19] what's the carcass? The present word.
[1:30:23] And when you recognize this message is
[1:30:28] eagle food,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; you've heard from your theophony.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; I thank God that the theophony has a
[1:30:35] voice. [laughter]
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You've heard from your
[1:30:40] theophony. Well, then I'll tell you
[1:30:42] this. That means you got one.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, Samuel went there
[1:30:46] and so does every son of the faith go
[1:30:49] there when they turn from here. You've
[1:30:51] already got it. Amen. Thank God for the
[1:30:54] opening of these seals. The true
[1:30:55] revelation of Melkazedc comes in view.
[1:30:58] He was God the word. Then he became God
[1:31:00] in the flesh. Here it is. Amen. They
[1:31:03] That's him. That's the king. Amen.
[1:31:05] That's the king. That's him coming. Now
[1:31:08] watch. Now if you if you start if you
[1:31:10] start seeing the progression of
[1:31:13] revelation from attribute to word to
[1:31:16] flesh then you're seeing that you
[1:31:19] started at the same place. You just
[1:31:21] skipped a portion.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; You took the bypass
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and you ended up in a place without
[1:31:27] coming through there. It doesn't mean
[1:31:30] the attribute is not there because the
[1:31:33] attribute was passed through. Even
[1:31:35] though you were born of a natural sex
[1:31:37] birth, God still lays the gene in there
[1:31:41] for your new birth.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I got quotes and I know some people
[1:31:46] don't like that church age book, but
[1:31:47] it's the truth. Brother man said, "You
[1:31:50] didn't get a you didn't come to the
[1:31:51] altar and get a new birth to get the
[1:31:53] seed." He said, "You've come to the
[1:31:55] altar and had a new birth because you
[1:31:57] did have a seed." Yes,
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; the seed is what gives you spiritual
[1:32:06] revelation.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I I when I when I think about this
[1:32:09] and and and and and you as well, you
[1:32:12] know what I'm talking about. There's
[1:32:13] some people that can quote the scripture
[1:32:15] back and forth, up and down, but have no
[1:32:18] clue what it's talking about.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; They can quote it and they can talk
[1:32:22] about it. Amen. But they can never see
[1:32:25] they can never see the change. They can
[1:32:27] never see the expressions of God.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Now what is actually happening is you're
[1:32:33] dealing with the changing of God and
[1:32:37] people can know what God was
[1:32:41] but they miss what he is.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; They know what happened
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; but they don't know what's happening.
[1:32:48] Amen.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Now, now, Brother Brandham will will lay
[1:32:53] this out and take just a moment and and
[1:32:55] in and just just a moment we'll
[1:32:56] continue. But, Brother Brandham will
[1:32:58] take this and lay this out and he'll
[1:33:00] take this to the word proven his word,
[1:33:02] 1964. And brother Bam will pick up the
[1:33:04] story. Now, I I I titled this the effect
[1:33:08] of revelation in Mazdc. And brother Bam
[1:33:10] will pick up this story and he'll talk
[1:33:12] about, have y'all ever not Have y'all
[1:33:14] noticed? I noticed this. Have you ever
[1:33:16] noticed when brother Brandham talks
[1:33:18] about uh Melchazdc, he often talks about
[1:33:22] him being at the tent door of Abraham?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; There's about three or four different
[1:33:26] appearings there and he never
[1:33:28] differates. Brother Bam talks about them
[1:33:31] like they're all the same thing.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. When brother Brandham does this,
[1:33:36] he talks about in Genesis 18, right? So,
[1:33:39] so Abraham separates from Lot in Genesis
[1:33:42] 13. Genesis 14, he meets Melkazedc,
[1:33:45] serves communion. In Genesis 15, he gets
[1:33:48] he gets the the revelation,
[1:33:50] justification or sanctification there,
[1:33:52] and he gets the confirmation of
[1:33:53] covenant. Then in over in Genesis 17, he
[1:33:57] meets the Lord God Almighty. In Genesis
[1:34:00] 18, Elohim comes to his tent door. Yeah.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham says, "But what
[1:34:06] was the effect of the revelation of
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Melazdc?"
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; That when he walked up to the tent door,
[1:34:14] there was three of them. And the
[1:34:17] revelation of Melazdc caused him to look
[1:34:19] at three and say, "My Lord."
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Now, watch.
[1:34:26] Revelation of Melkazedc allowed Abraham
[1:34:30] to see I I don't I don't think you're
[1:34:32] slow. I'm slowing down because I want
[1:34:34] you to catch the point.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation of Melazdc
[1:34:39] was when he came as Elohim to the tent
[1:34:42] door of Abraham.
[1:34:44] Abraham knew who he was.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; He didn't look the same. He wasn't
[1:34:50] wearing the same clothes. He was in a
[1:34:52] company of three. But Abraham knew who
[1:34:55] he was and said unto him, "My Lord."
[1:35:00] Brother Bam says, "Was his revelation
[1:35:02] right?" He says, "Watch the next verses.
[1:35:05] Go get thy wife Sarah."
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "There it is." How do you know
[1:35:10] he was married? How did he know his her
[1:35:12] name was Sarah? How did he know the
[1:35:14] promise was the baby? And when he and
[1:35:16] when he called the promise, she laughed
[1:35:18] in her heart. And the Bible says she was
[1:35:21] in the tent behind him. And he said,
[1:35:24] "Why did Sarah laugh?" Boam said,
[1:35:25] "There's the vindication of who he was
[1:35:28] talking to."
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation was to
[1:35:32] witness that Elohim was in A DIFFERENT
[1:35:35] BODY, BUT IT WAS THE SAME ANGEL.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; NOW, brother Wayne, you said, "What are
[1:35:40] you talking about?" Now, we have been
[1:35:42] promised a revelation of Melazdc. It's
[1:35:44] an end time revelation. What is the
[1:35:47] effect of the revelation of Melazdc? And
[1:35:49] why is it important to us? Because when
[1:35:52] we see the SAME ELOHIM USE THE BODY OF A
[1:35:55] SIXTH GRADE Kentucky hillbilly, WE CAN
[1:35:58] IDENTIFY THAT'S THE SAME ELOHIM THAT WAS
[1:36:01] BACK THERE IN THE BIBLE. COME ON,
[1:36:04] CHURCH. AMEN. William Brandon was the
[1:36:06] veil. But what WAS USING HIM WAS THE
[1:36:09] SAME ANGEL THAT WAS AT THE TENT door of
[1:36:11] Abraham. I tell you, amen. It's an
[1:36:14] effective revelation. If you catch it,
[1:36:16] then you'll see that William Brandom,
[1:36:18] Amen, wasn't the messenger after all.
[1:36:20] Amen. There was somebody else on the
[1:36:22] scene. There was somebody else among us
[1:36:24] that was an eternal ONE THAT HAD BEEN
[1:36:27] WITH ABRAHAM WAS NOW WITH THE SEED OF
[1:36:30] ABRAHAM. AND THE REVELATION OF MELAZDC
[1:36:33] HAD CAME TO FATHER ABRAHAM HAS COME TO
[1:36:35] THE SEED OF ABRAHAM. And he, oh God, the
[1:36:39] one that was at the tent door of
[1:36:40] Abraham, has come to the tent door of
[1:36:42] the bride. And he's done the same
[1:36:44] miracle to the bride that he did to
[1:36:46] Abraham.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter] Come on, church.
[1:36:50] Y'all know what I'm talking about. He
[1:36:52] showed that sign to Abraham and gave
[1:36:54] Abraham a message. And the next thing
[1:36:56] that happened, Abraham's body was
[1:36:57] changed. Jesus did the same sign. And
[1:37:01] Amen. They had a resurrection. Amen. And
[1:37:03] they had a change. Amen. Uh uh they had
[1:37:06] a resurrection. Amen. And they had a
[1:37:08] rapture BACK THERE. WHEN THE THIRD time
[1:37:11] this same sign comes on the earth,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; there's a resurrection. There's a
[1:37:15] rapture. And the body change.
[1:37:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; The effect of the revelation was, "Let
[1:37:24] me turn my back to you and see if it
[1:37:27] ain't the same angel."
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; That did y'all hear them pre-ervice
[1:37:32] quotes. Huh? Hey, brother Bam said,
[1:37:35] "I'll turn my back to you so you can see
[1:37:38] it's not William Brandom."
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The effect of the
[1:37:44] revelation was that man was looking at
[1:37:47] the veil and calling it man. BUT LOOK
[1:37:50] BEYOND THE VEIL AND SEE THAT GOD IS IN
[1:37:53] BRIGHT FORM manifesting himself in the
[1:37:57] last days.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Now that was not Jesus talking to
[1:38:01] Abraham.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; What's the effect of revelation? The
[1:38:05] effect of the revelation of Melkazedc
[1:38:07] itself. Brother said that wasn't Jesus
[1:38:09] talking to Abraham. Who was it? It was
[1:38:11] Elohim, the word
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; discerning the heart of Sarah.
[1:38:17] So the world is looking for Jesus with
[1:38:19] nails guard hands
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; to come back on the earth and manifest
[1:38:24] himself as he did as Jesus of Nazareth.
[1:38:28] They're looking for crown of thorns,
[1:38:30] nail prints. They're looking for that
[1:38:32] ministry. And brother Bam said that's
[1:38:34] not the promise.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; The promise is the son of man would be
[1:38:38] revealed. That was not Jesus at the tent
[1:38:42] door of Abraham. That was Melchazdc.
[1:38:45] Come on now. BUT MELAZDC BECAME JESUS.
[1:38:49] And Jesus is alive. And he's RIGHT HERE
[1:38:52] IN THE BUILDING. BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING
[1:38:54] AT HIS PHYSICAL BODY. BUT THE WORD, THE
[1:38:57] THEOPHONY OF GOD HAS COME AMONG US AS
[1:39:00] THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Look at him stand there. Amen. Brother
[1:39:04] man, turn his back and say, "The same
[1:39:06] angel."
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now, if you had the effect
[1:39:09] of that same revelation Abraham had,
[1:39:11] which is promised to the seed, the end
[1:39:14] time revelation would let you call that
[1:39:16] God.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And then, see, people get all messed up.
[1:39:19] See, right? Because the minute you do
[1:39:21] it, then they try to make Brother
[1:39:22] Brandham God.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Then you have made him an antichrist.
[1:39:26] You've took the veil and made it God.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I don't know how to Let
[1:39:31] me just say it like this. Let Let's just
[1:39:33] say there's a big curtain up here,
[1:39:34] right? And I went in and stood behind
[1:39:36] the curtain and I veiled myself from you
[1:39:38] and I'm talking to you and you're
[1:39:40] listening to me and you can hear my
[1:39:42] voice and my accent and you know me. You
[1:39:44] say, "Brother Wayne's talking to us."
[1:39:46] There would not be one moment, amen,
[1:39:48] that you would think that curtain was
[1:39:49] Wayne Lawson.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; The curtain's hiding Wayne Lawson.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That curtain is not Wayne Lawson.
[1:39:56] William Brandon was not Jesus Christ. HE
[1:39:59] WAS HIDING THE PRESENCE OF GOD FROM THIS
[1:40:02] AGE. GOD WAS USING A MAN TO PROVE to you
[1:40:06] that he is alive.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Whoever that person is, he's still alive
[1:40:12] tonight.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus was not there discerning Sarah's
[1:40:19] mind. Brother Bam said it was a man in
[1:40:21] human flesh. Abraham called him Elohim.
[1:40:24] See,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and it was the days of Sodom. Watch
[1:40:26] close now.
[1:40:29] And so shall it be at the coming of the
[1:40:31] son of man. We're in Luke 17:30. Now,
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; when the son of man is being revealed,
[1:40:36] not no more as a church, but the bride
[1:40:38] is called in the day when the son of man
[1:40:40] is revealed. So, we're talking about
[1:40:41] bride ministry. Now,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; see what to join the church to the head.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; To unite the marriage of the bride.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; What's the message for? It's to unite
[1:40:53] the bride to her head.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom call will come right
[1:40:59] through this. Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [panting]
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; The channel that God chose to call you
[1:41:09] is going to come right through this
[1:41:10] message.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Do you see that attribute?
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you. Hey, attribute.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Do you see? God is going to use the
[1:41:18] channel of a prophet to bring your
[1:41:21] missing parts.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I'm going to unite you
[1:41:27] to to the headship of this word. Amen.
[1:41:30] And if we live long enough, if we live
[1:41:33] long enough, somebody is going to take
[1:41:36] on the theophonyy while they yet live.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody's going to die. Amen.
[1:41:41] The bride's going to resurrect and take
[1:41:43] on theophony and be changed. BUT THERE'S
[1:41:45] A PROMISE IN THE BIBLE THAT SOMEBODY'S
[1:41:47] GOING TO REMAIN ALIVE AND THE PARTS OF
[1:41:51] THAT MESSAGE is going to connect YOU TO
[1:41:53] YOUR THEOPHONY AND CHANGE IN THE MOMENT,
[1:41:55] IN THE TWINKLE OF AN EYE. THAT'S WHY NOT
[1:41:57] any message will do us. Amen.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; That's why theology ain't going TO WORK
[1:42:03] FOLKS. THAT'S WHY THE PSYCHOLOGY CAN'T
[1:42:06] BE OUR GUIDE. WE HAVE GOT TO BE TOOK
[1:42:09] BACK TO THE MIND OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; YOU see the effect of Melazdc the
[1:42:14] revelation let you know uniting with the
[1:42:17] message is uniting with God. the really
[1:42:20] attribute and when this attribute then
[1:42:22] brother Bam said the bridegroom call
[1:42:24] comes through this and you will see the
[1:42:26] son of man come down in human flesh not
[1:42:28] virgin flesh not created flesh redeemed
[1:42:31] flesh
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; you'll see the blood works
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; you'll see this come together and
[1:42:36] brother Bam says see that the church has
[1:42:38] to be the word he is the word and the
[1:42:40] two unites together now I want you to
[1:42:42] watch I'm going to move on amen I might
[1:42:44] revisit this tomorrow but I want to move
[1:42:46] on for now but watch what he says that
[1:42:49] message is coming to marry or to put
[1:42:51] together or to make a union between the
[1:42:54] two.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's making a union between the
[1:42:59] two. It's to bring Amen. a redeemable
[1:43:03] attribute, its ability to be redeemed.
[1:43:06] Now, Brother Brandham will go in and
[1:43:07] he'll talk about the woman at the well.
[1:43:09] And he'll say, "The woman at the well,
[1:43:10] remember again, he'll say, "Now, when
[1:43:12] she got spoke to, she responded
[1:43:16] differently than the Pharisee. Now watch
[1:43:19] the difference between intellectual
[1:43:21] faith and revelation. Intellectual
[1:43:23] faith, brother Bram says, watch the
[1:43:26] Pharisee had learned because of
[1:43:28] intellectual conception. He was born in
[1:43:31] the right lineage. He was a Levite, but
[1:43:34] he only knowed it by intellectual
[1:43:36] conception. And when the light of the
[1:43:38] hour, see, he learned it by what had
[1:43:41] happened, not what was happening.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; There you go. So that Pharisee could say
[1:43:46] to you, look the the book of Moses says
[1:43:49] and the law says and this says and this
[1:43:51] is what happened on Sinai and this is
[1:43:53] how many days and this is the stretch of
[1:43:55] the temple and how it he could break the
[1:43:57] whole thing down.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; But when the word become alive,
[1:44:03] he believed the word that was written
[1:44:06] and turned down the LIVING MANIFESTATION
[1:44:08] OF THAT WORD SO HE COULD know it by what
[1:44:11] had happened, not what was happening.
[1:44:12] That's right.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Brother Ram said, "But that
[1:44:15] woman at the well knew what was
[1:44:16] happening.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; That attribute that was in her. It
[1:44:19] picked up what was what was happening."
[1:44:22] Now, now folks, I I don't mean it to
[1:44:24] sound wrong, but we've had we've had
[1:44:26] we've had Baptist buzzards and Lutheran
[1:44:28] buzzards and Wesleyan buzzards. We don't
[1:44:30] want to be message buzzards. We don't
[1:44:33] want to be Amen. roosting around on what
[1:44:35] happened back in the 50s and the 60s and
[1:44:38] everything God is and what he done IS
[1:44:40] BACK THERE. THERE'S a whole group THAT'S
[1:44:42] TAKING US BACK THAT WAY.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AMEN. Telling you to
[1:44:46] vote your pastor out and just play a
[1:44:48] tape. You know, there there's a there's
[1:44:50] a movement going on that's trying to
[1:44:52] keep a person stuck on what had
[1:44:54] happened.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But there's something happening tonight.
[1:44:58] YOU SAY, "PREACHER, WHAT IS HAPPENING?"
[1:45:00] THE WORD THAT was on THOSE TAPES ARE
[1:45:03] TAKING THE FLESH. THEY'RE MOVING INTO
[1:45:05] THE CHURCH. THERE'S BEEN A UNION between
[1:45:08] the bride AND THIS MESSAGE. THE SEVENTH
[1:45:11] SEAL IS LIFE.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; He's living. HE'S ALIVE. AND HE'S RIGHT
[1:45:16] HERE TONIGHT IN THE FORM OF THE BRIDE OF
[1:45:19] JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. Brother man said it
[1:45:22] like this. He says, "How would it be
[1:45:24] done?" It's happening right before you
[1:45:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus. What is
[1:45:30] it, brother Wayne? What's happening?
[1:45:31] It's a spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:45:34] church. When the flesh is becoming
[1:45:36] united with the word and the word is
[1:45:38] becoming flesh, that's what's happening.
[1:45:41] The message is becoming FLESH AND THE
[1:45:44] FLESH IS BECOMING THE MESSAGE. IT'S THE
[1:45:46] POWER OF TRANSFORMATION. YOU DON'T THINK
[1:45:49] YOUR WEDNESDAY night matters, but every
[1:45:51] time you take a bite, there's an
[1:45:53] unlocking of a gene of GOD ON THE INSIDE
[1:45:56] of you. Amen. And watch it begin to
[1:45:58] stack up. Watch a Wednesday stack on a
[1:46:01] Sunday and a Sunday stack on a
[1:46:03] Wednesday. AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU'VE
[1:46:05] MOVED FROM an infant TO A GROWN MAN THAT
[1:46:07] HAS STRENGTH AND HAS POWER. YOU got
[1:46:10] there ONE BITE AT A TIME. And if you're
[1:46:12] going to get maturity in this message,
[1:46:14] you'll get it one sermon. You'll get it
[1:46:16] one message. You'll get it one quote
[1:46:18] here a little, THERE A LITTLE, LINE UPON
[1:46:20] LINE.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; MY LORD, THERE'S A BRIDE [screaming] ON
[1:46:24] THE SCENE. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening. Listen. And
[1:46:31] there's nothing can stop it.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I know what I'm talking
[1:46:37] about. Your bad mood can't stop this
[1:46:39] message.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Your your bad year can't stop this
[1:46:42] message. Your your gan lineage can't
[1:46:44] stop THIS MESSAGE. THE DEVIL can't stop
[1:46:47] it. People get say, "Well, I tell you
[1:46:48] what, we got all these haters now, and
[1:46:50] they're going to stop the message."
[1:46:51] Nonsense.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; They'll never stop this message. They'll
[1:46:56] never stop the attributes of God. AMEN.
[1:46:58] THEY'LL BURN. WE'LL BURN BRIGHTER AND
[1:47:00] BRIGHTER UNTIL THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[1:47:03] WE MIGHT BE IN A MINORITY, BUT WE'LL
[1:47:05] HAVE A MAJORITY OF POWER BECAUSE THE
[1:47:07] POTENTIAL OF THIS MESSAGE IS IN THE
[1:47:09] BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. Nothing's going
[1:47:12] to hinder it. Nothing's going TO STOP
[1:47:14] IT. THE DEVIL DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
[1:47:16] TO STOP THE GENES OF ALMIGHTY GOD. He is
[1:47:20] a tool in the hand of God. And what he
[1:47:23] means for evil, God will make it turn TO
[1:47:26] GOOD. IF GOD BE BEFORE YOU, WHO CAN BE
[1:47:29] AGAINST YOU? [laughter] NAY, IN ALL
[1:47:30] THINGS, WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS IN
[1:47:33] CHRIST JESUS. I TELL YOU WHAT, the devil
[1:47:35] got his hands full. The effectiveness of
[1:47:38] the revelation of Melazdc will tell you
[1:47:40] that you were right there with Job
[1:47:43] before the foundations of the WORLD
[1:47:45] SHOUTING FOR JOY. AMEN. AND I WAS
[1:47:48] SHOUTING BEFORE THERE WAS A DEVIL. And I
[1:47:50] can tell the devil tonight, if you want
[1:47:52] to watch me, COME ON AND WATCH ME. BUT
[1:47:54] I'M GOING TO SHOUT. I'M GONNA PRAISE.
[1:47:57] I'M GOING TO REJOICE. I'M GOING TO
[1:47:59] PREACH THIS MESSAGE BECAUSE I'M a
[1:48:01] believer.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; No, you ain't going to stop this
[1:48:07] message.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; No, you you sooner try to stop the sun
[1:48:14] from rising.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to happen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, this message is moving forward.
[1:48:20] Amen. I'll tell you folks, it's the
[1:48:23] truth.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Amen. Brother Bram says
[1:48:26] it. He says, listen, he says he said
[1:48:29] what would take place in this age and
[1:48:31] here it is happening
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; and the Satan is trying his best to keep
[1:48:35] you from seeing it.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's what he's trying to do. He's
[1:48:38] trying to keep you from seeing what's
[1:48:40] happening.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going on whether you know
[1:48:44] it's going on or not. There is a union
[1:48:46] happening between this bride and his and
[1:48:49] her lover, the word of God. Every time
[1:48:53] you hear the message, every time a man
[1:48:55] of God preaches this word, you become a
[1:48:58] little more what you're supposed to
[1:48:59] become. The more you feed ON THIS
[1:49:01] MESSAGE, YOU BECOME MORE of what you're
[1:49:03] supposed to become. I BELIEVE THE THIRD
[1:49:05] PULL HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE
[1:49:08] ELEMENTS of your body.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; I believe it can unlock things in you.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "These are mysterious
[1:49:18] happenings, but you'll understand it."
[1:49:20] That's right.
[1:49:22] You'll understand it
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; cuz this church is built on the
[1:49:25] revelation of the word of the season,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; a present truth. Listen, hell ain't
[1:49:30] against denomination, folks.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; No, brother Wayne, if we're in the will
[1:49:34] of God, why is everything against us?
[1:49:36] I'll tell you why. Cuz Satan and all of
[1:49:38] his angels against the revelation that
[1:49:40] Christ is here now.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; As long as you want to put him in
[1:49:44] another age, folks, I know what I'm
[1:49:46] talking about. Denomination, all Amen.
[1:49:48] They devil ain't against it.
[1:49:50] They're on his team.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why don't they have that
[1:49:55] same trouble over at this Baptist
[1:49:57] group?" Well, it's because he's on their
[1:49:58] team.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; He ain't fighting them.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; What do you think the mark of the beast
[1:50:05] is?
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; It's denomination.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; The daughter of the great harlot is
[1:50:11] denominational systems.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Right. Hell ain't fighting that.
[1:50:18] Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; It's fighting this message.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SAID the gates of hell
[1:50:26] will be against it, but it will never
[1:50:29] prevail.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It'll never prevail because revelation
[1:50:34] will prevail over the devil every time.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; What's What's happening, brother Wayne?
[1:50:40] What's happening? I tell you what's
[1:50:41] happening. I tell you what's happening
[1:50:42] tonight. The sons and daughters of God
[1:50:44] are on this earth and this message is
[1:50:46] lightening coming into their soul to
[1:50:49] enlighten who they were before.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; What they're doing here now and how
[1:50:53] they're going to get out of here.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; This message is unlocking the part of
[1:50:57] you that nothing else could unlock. It's
[1:51:00] bringing into what is happening in your
[1:51:02] day. It's the manifestation of the hour.
[1:51:05] Now, when I say that to you, when you
[1:51:07] read about Melazdc, and I'll be closing
[1:51:10] here soon. When you read about
[1:51:11] Melkazedc, you read how that he come to
[1:51:14] Abraham. And when he come to Abraham, go
[1:51:16] read Genesis 14 and see when he came, he
[1:51:19] came with o he come with wine and bread.
[1:51:22] He didn't have a lamb.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Elohim the word didn't have a lamb in
[1:51:28] Genesis 14 or in Genesis 18. But in
[1:51:32] Matthew the 3 chapter, Jesus stands in
[1:51:35] the river Jordan and Elohim
[1:51:39] fills that human temple and says, "This
[1:51:43] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:51:46] pleased."
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; And the God of heaven claimed a lamb.
[1:51:51] And it wasn't David's lamb. It wasn't
[1:51:53] Isaiah's lamb. It was God's lamb.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; This wasn't one Moses was carrying.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; This wasn't one David was carrying.
[1:52:01] Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; This wasn't one that Joshua carried.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; THIS ONE GOD [screaming] HIMSELF CLAIMED
[1:52:07] a human body and sacrif
[1:52:11] God set in here.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; You said, "Bro, what are you talking
[1:52:14] about?" God Mechazedc claimed a lamb.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; But he's not here tonight claiming a
[1:52:19] lamb. He's here claiming a bride.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; He's claiming a bride. He's claiming
[1:52:26] flesh that the gene of God is laying in.
[1:52:29] And he's saying, "Hey, man. You belong
[1:52:31] to me before you were your mom and dad's
[1:52:34] child. Before you were in this earth,
[1:52:36] you already belong to me, and I'm here
[1:52:39] to lay claim on what is mine."
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Now, has y'all ever st study the
[1:52:44] claiming work? I'm not going to preach
[1:52:45] on tonight. Do you ever study the
[1:52:46] claiming work? And you hear preachers
[1:52:47] talk about redemption claims and they
[1:52:49] talk and you say, "Why are they always
[1:52:51] on that redemption claims?" Because
[1:52:53] brother Brandham says he morphs himself
[1:52:55] in what he claims.
[1:52:58] He immores himself in what he claims.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; And today he is claiming a bride
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; because he is going to immor himself in
[1:53:11] bride form. So what's happening, brother
[1:53:13] Wayne? It's the bride coming of Jesus
[1:53:16] Christ. Come on. That's why I teach it's
[1:53:19] a bride age. IT'S THE BRIDE COMING OF
[1:53:22] JESUS CHRIST. THIS AIN'T JUST ANOTHER
[1:53:25] AGE. THIS IS THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD
[1:53:28] COMING TO MANIFESTATION IN THE FLESH OF
[1:53:31] OUR BODIES. You say, "Brother Wayne, I'm
[1:53:33] nothing." I agree. Your human body is
[1:53:35] nothing. It came like every other body,
[1:53:37] but there's a gene in you had come from
[1:53:39] almighty God and he sent this message
[1:53:42] for you.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe you were born to a certain family.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're born to a certain family
[1:53:50] and that family line's got high temper.
[1:53:54] Half of your life you fought with high
[1:53:56] tempers and it and it and it's totally
[1:53:58] disturbed your life and it's always
[1:54:00] coming at you and it's always saying
[1:54:02] I'll be here forever. I'm going to take
[1:54:04] this life. But then there's something on
[1:54:06] the inside of you.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; There's something in you. This message
[1:54:10] will come over your life and it'll say
[1:54:12] look, amen. Before the temper was passed
[1:54:15] through a human trait, there was a gene
[1:54:18] of God put in you THAT HAS THE POWER TO
[1:54:21] OVERCOME IT.
[1:54:25] The message of the hour is here to claim
[1:54:27] you.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; To immorate in you.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; God's not God's God's brother said it.
[1:54:35] He said, "The pillar of fire is here to
[1:54:36] change our hearts."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here tonight
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; to change the mask of God.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; He's putting on the mask of the bride
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. So, by the way, what's
[1:54:51] happening? I tell you what's happening.
[1:54:54] The message of the hour is taking over
[1:54:56] your life.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; And the more it takes over,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; it's going to bring forth full sons,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; full daughters,
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; of the living God. I believe tonight,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that it's the same Jesus
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; in the form of the bride.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; In the form of the bride. Come,
[1:55:20] musicians come, the same Jesus
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; in the form
[1:55:27] of the bride.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; So, brother Wayne, I come into this
[1:55:31] earth in this in this condition.
[1:55:34] Friends, listen. There's not a condition
[1:55:36] that can stop it.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said it's unstoppable.
[1:55:42] He said, "An attribute
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; that cannot be destroyed." I like that
[1:55:48] quote.
[1:55:51] He said, "An attribute son."
[1:55:54] Do do you know an attribute son is the
[1:55:56] son that was in the life? Attribute son.
[1:55:59] But we're moving from attribute son
[1:56:03] to manifested son.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And this message is moving you there.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Do you see? He's claiming you to immorph
[1:56:14] you.
[1:56:16] Can you imagine
[1:56:19] that you
[1:56:22] and who you are and all you are
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; but he come to claim
[1:56:28] you. [music] I mean think of brother
[1:56:30] Brandham picking up the story of Abraham
[1:56:32] and Sarah and going there and Sarah
[1:56:33] laughed and he talked about that and
[1:56:35] then he goes over [music] and says watch
[1:56:36] King Amalcch took her and brother Bram
[1:56:40] said God went over there and said to
[1:56:41] King Amalcch you give her back.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. you give her back. Why? Because
[1:56:48] the seed was going to come through her.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam said, if he'd do that
[1:56:52] for the natural line, what about the
[1:56:54] supernatural line? This this royal seed
[1:56:56] of Abraham.
[1:56:58] No wonder a prophet would [music] look
[1:57:00] at the church and say, "Don't touch her
[1:57:02] again.
[1:57:04] You trinitarian spirit, don't touch her
[1:57:06] again.
[1:57:07] I claim her in the name of Jesus."
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? I take every spirit
[1:57:12] in here under my control. What was he
[1:57:14] doing? [music]
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He was TELLING THE DEVIL, "GOD'S GOT
[1:57:18] ATTRIBUTES on this earth.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; MY MESSAGE IS GOING to live."
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody's looking back here to Brother
[1:57:28] Random. You know, they're looking back
[1:57:30] to the prophet just back that way.
[1:57:33] And they're trying to discuss, was
[1:57:35] Brother Brandham, was he right? Was he
[1:57:36] wrong? Did he [music] did he mess up
[1:57:38] here? Did he lie here? Do do you not
[1:57:40] realize that's the devil
[1:57:42] [music] trying to get you to look back
[1:57:45] all those years ago at what happened
[1:57:50] when God's doing something tonight and
[1:57:52] [music] it takes the focus of the
[1:57:54] happening away from the church.
[1:57:58] But listen, we're going to express it
[1:58:00] anyhow.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; We're going to express bride anyhow. He
[1:58:04] can bring all he wants to bring, but
[1:58:07] we're going to go right on being bride
[1:58:09] anyhow.
[1:58:11] You know, in things that are to be, he
[1:58:13] said it was your duty [music] to express
[1:58:14] the gene of God to this age. It's your
[1:58:17] duty to express. You got a duty to
[1:58:19] express to [music] this age the gene of
[1:58:20] God. This is bride's revival. Don't
[1:58:22] y'all believe that? This is bride's
[1:58:25] revival. So, well, the church ain't full
[1:58:27] tonight. That don't mean one thing.
[1:58:28] Bride's revival is not numbers.
[1:58:31] Brother Bram said it [music] very
[1:58:33] clearly. He said it's not. He said the
[1:58:34] lake of Michigan had a great revival and
[1:58:36] not 1 ounce more water was in that lake.
[1:58:38] [music] And he said so we find there
[1:58:41] will never be another name added to the
[1:58:42] lamb's book alive either. [music]
[1:58:45] But this message is a bride's revival to
[1:58:47] awaken that which was already on the
[1:58:49] book. It's the gene expression of God
[1:58:52] coming forth off the book. And you are
[1:58:56] that gene.
[1:58:58] Now [music] I'm going to say brother
[1:58:59] Bram talks about that man went down
[1:59:01] there and God sent him to a town to hold
[1:59:03] a revival and said when he got down
[1:59:05] there said he got up there going going
[1:59:07] to rented a [music] little room there
[1:59:09] and was cleaning off the window you know
[1:59:10] and going to hold a revival right there
[1:59:12] in that place and a bully in the town
[1:59:14] come up there and said you ain't going
[1:59:15] to hold no revival here and he said
[1:59:17] [music] oh yeah he said well God sent me
[1:59:19] down here to do it it's my duty God sent
[1:59:22] me say I got a gene I got to express God
[1:59:25] sent me to do it in this town [music]
[1:59:26] right here and he said going to start
[1:59:28] cleaning that wind. And that fella said,
[1:59:29] "Look, you ain't going to hold a revival
[1:59:31] here. You're going to have [music] to
[1:59:33] whip me first."
[1:59:35] And brother Bam said he crawled off
[1:59:36] there and smacked the old boy. Got right
[1:59:38] down on top of him and started whipping
[1:59:40] him [music] good. And he said, "If I
[1:59:41] must fight, if I must rain, decrease my
[1:59:43] courage, Lord." He got him whipped good.
[1:59:45] Whipped that bully and stood him up on
[1:59:47] his [music] feet. He said, "Now church
[1:59:48] starts at 7:00." And brother Bam said he
[1:59:51] was there at night on the front row and
[1:59:53] got saved. [music] But see, there might
[1:59:56] be a bully you're going to have to whip
[1:59:57] in your life because God has sent you to
[2:00:00] this age to express [music] this message
[2:00:01] in this age. And if there's an old if
[2:00:04] there's an old depression bully mounting
[2:00:06] up on YOUR LIFE, NO REVIVAL HERE, WILL
[2:00:09] YOU JUST TELL HIM, "SATAN, YOU DON'T
[2:00:11] HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THIS REVIVAL."
[2:00:13] [music]
[2:00:15] I wish somebody preached with me
[2:00:17] tonight. Is there a gene expression in
[2:00:20] this word THAT'S IN THIS PLACE TONIGHT
[2:00:22] THAT'LL SAY, "SATAN, YOU'LL NOT STOP
[2:00:24] THIS ONE."
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP THIS ONE.
[2:00:30] GOD HAS CLAIMED ME TO REMORPHE in me.
[2:00:33] AND I SAY THIS, I'LL COME AGAINST
[2:00:35] EVERYTHING SATAN'S got to do what God
[2:00:37] called me to do. Brother, I tell you,
[2:00:40] it's not the dog in the [music] fight.
[2:00:42] It's the size of the fight that's in the
[2:00:43] dog.
[2:00:47] Brother Mark, [music] you can do it.
[2:00:50] You got what it takes in you to do it.
[2:00:53] [music] He claims what he more. Could
[2:00:55] you stand to your feet with me tonight?
[2:00:57] I say, God,
[2:00:59] I know it's the first [music] night of a
[2:01:00] meeting,
[2:01:03] but it feels pretty good.
[2:01:06] It just feels pretty good.
[2:01:12] So the next time you hear a preacher
[2:01:14] preaching on God claimed [music] you, he
[2:01:16] didn't claim you to have you. He claimed
[2:01:18] you to immorate in you [music] to
[2:01:21] express himself in you. Let's just bow
[2:01:23] our head. Almighty God, we thank you
[2:01:25] [music] tonight. We thank you for the
[2:01:27] revelation of Melazdc that's coming this
[2:01:29] age. Lord, I I don't know what the
[2:01:32] people come expecting tonight, but these
[2:01:34] things are upon our hearts. Lord,
[2:01:36] [music] these things that you have
[2:01:38] placed upon our heart, I pray they'd be
[2:01:39] a blessing to your children in this age.
[2:01:42] Lord, your gene, your children, your
[2:01:47] attribute sons and daughters that are
[2:01:49] [music] in this place. Father, I pray
[2:01:51] the message of the hour becomes so real.
[2:01:55] I pray that it takes preeminence over
[2:01:58] everything else in their [music] lives,
[2:01:59] Lord. And Father, tonight we surrender.
[2:02:02] We surrender everything that we are. We
[2:02:05] ask you Lord,
[2:02:07] Lord, move through us in a way that you
[2:02:09] would see fit. We ask you for that great
[2:02:12] moving of your anointing, Lord. In the
[2:02:15] name of [music] Jesus Christ, we pray.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. [music]
[2:02:24] Yes. We thank you for it, Father. We
[2:02:27] thank [music] you for your spirit
[2:02:28] tonight.
[2:02:30] ask you
[2:02:32] for [music] just [singing] who
[2:02:35] I am.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; You can tell [singing] them
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:02:43] [music] redeemed.
[2:02:46] [singing]

[2:03:04] my life.
[2:03:09] And if [singing]
[2:03:11] I [music]
[2:03:13] ask you
[2:03:15] just who
[2:03:18] I [music] am,
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; you can tell them [singing]
[2:03:23] that I am
[2:03:26] redeemed. [music]
[2:03:26] [singing]
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I [singing] am redeemed. [music]
[2:03:36] I've been I've been [singing] born with

[2:03:47] life. [singing]
[2:03:51] And if anybody
[2:03:55] ask you
[2:03:57] for [music] just [singing] who
[2:04:00] I am,
[2:04:02] you can tell [music and singing] him
[2:04:05] that I am. God bless you tonight.
[2:04:09] [music and singing]
[2:04:10] Yes, Lord.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I am
[2:04:16] redeemed. [singing]
[2:04:17] [music] I've been bought
[2:04:21] a price.
[2:04:23] [music]
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus

[2:04:47] that I [singing] am
[2:04:50] redeemed. Aren't you glad you're
[2:04:51] redeemed? Sing it again. [music]

[2:05:38] Oh, who I am, Lord. [music]
[2:05:43] It's who I [singing] am.
[2:05:47] I can [music] see now
[2:05:51] who I am.
[2:05:54] [music] A part of my [singing] savior,
[2:05:59] a part of his word.
[2:06:02] [music]
[2:06:03] It's a revelation. [singing]
[2:06:07] It's predestination [music]
[2:06:11] of who I [singing] am.
[2:06:16] [music]
[2:06:17] This victory
[2:06:19] that day he [singing] set me free
[2:06:23] [music]
[2:06:24] and made my heart [singing]
[2:06:28] his very [music] throne.
[2:06:32] My life is [music and singing] no longer
[2:06:34] mine.
[2:06:36] I'm a prisoner of love divine
[2:06:40] and [singing] now I live.
[2:06:44] You praise the praise
[2:06:45] [singing and music] name. Oh, sing it
[2:06:48] now. Who I am, Lord. [music]
[2:06:53] Who I [singing] am.
[2:06:56] [music]
[2:06:57] I can see now
[2:07:01] who [music and singing] I am.
[2:07:04] a part of my savior,
[2:07:08] [singing and music] a part of his word.
[2:07:13] It's a revelation. [singing and music]
[2:07:17] It's predestination
[2:07:21] of who I am.
[2:07:24] [singing and music]
[2:07:25] On Calvary, he died
[2:07:29] to redeem his [singing and music] lost
[2:07:31] bride.
[2:07:33] the King of Kings
[2:07:37] became. [singing]
[2:07:38] Well, aren't you glad for that?
[2:07:41] This [music] is God's great mystery
[2:07:43] [singing]
[2:07:45] of love expressed to me
[2:07:49] that Christ and [music and singing] I
[2:07:53] might be made one. Glory to God. Oh, who
[2:07:58] I am, [singing] Lord.
[2:08:01] It's who I am.
[2:08:05] And I [music and singing] can see now
