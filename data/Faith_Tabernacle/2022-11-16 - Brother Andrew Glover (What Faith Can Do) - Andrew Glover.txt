God has opened our eyes in this evil age to truth amen I know it may be a Wednesday evening and it may be cool on the outside but it's a privilege to be gathered in this building tonight because we're

to be in the house of God tonight amen we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord and if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we'll invite you in the scriptures to the book of Hebrews the very familiar reading the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter and we want to say we appreciate your prayers and and support for us while we were gone this past weekend some meetings Aaron Saskatoon up in Canada and the Lord just met with us in a very special way there and blessed the assemblies there and it was a real wonderful time in his presence and so brother Kelly Hildebrandt sends his greetings to the church and to brother Sean so we want to be sure and relate that this evening and I tell you it is a wonderful time to be able to get together with Believers amen because when Believers get together something good always happens amen and I believe the same God that's met with us before is going to meet with us here tonight amen let's just buy our hearts together for a word of prayer just before we read the word and let's just ask the Lord to open his word to us tonight Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here and Lord we step behind this sacred desk once more father we are very well aware that your presence is in this building Lord as your Believers have begin to lay aside the thoughts and cares of life and Lord we have begin to lift up your name and to sing the songs of zine and Praises unto Your Name Lord I believe that your word tells us that you inhabit the Praises of your people and Lord I believe that you have descended in this building tonight as the Praises have begun to go up now Lord as we come to this portion of this service to open your word father we've been taught that anyone with physical strength can open this book but it'll take you Lord with spiritual strength to open our understanding that we could receive something that would be more than just an idea or would be more than just a scripture or a quote but father it would be an edification to the lives of your Believers and Lord I pray tonight for my brothers and sisters here father you see every need oh God you see every situation the diseases in the sickness is Lord that are roaming throughout the land and afflicting Lord left and right oh God I pray that your spirit of healing would come into sick bodies tonight Lord I pray that those that are discouraged and depressed father would be encouraged and would be lifted by your presence oh God for those that are Lord empty tonight I pray Lord that you would feel them dear God With the blessings according to Faith oh God lord if there be one here without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire they don't know you in the power of your resurrection and The Parting of your blood I pray tonight would be the night that would transform their lives forever Lord for Lord truly there is none of us here tonight Lord that stands higher than the other one or better father we stand on the same ground Lord Redeemed by your grace father now Lord I submit myself to you may you anoint those speaker and hear a father may you speak through me and may you hear through the Believers Lord and father when this meeting would be dismissed may it be another Emmaus walk Lord road walk experience oh God that we would say did not our hearts burn within us it's not as brother Andrew or another man talked to us along the way but Lord as you come and revealed yourself and Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter in the 32nd verse I want to look there I know you know this chapter by heart it's speaking of The Heroes of Faith but he comes down here in the 32nd verse Paul and says what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of jephthah of David also and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith now notice this who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lines quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword and out of weakness were made strong we're wax violent in fight and turned to fly the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cool markings and scourging yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were still own they were sawing asunder they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskin and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise for God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen we asked Lord this evening to add the blessing and to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I I trust that everyone is feeling well and amen here to receive from the Lord tonight I want to for a few moments if I could to speak tonight if I title this to all I want to speak to you on the thought of What Faith Can Do What Faith Can Do I was listening to a tape the other day in 1959 bloodbam's preaching blind Bartimaeus and he said now Jesus could not have heard his voice he was a hundred or two hundred yards from him and people were screaming he wasn't listening to them and they was fussing at him but he was thinking of Jerusalem he said but that blind Beggar's Faith stopped him and he turned he said what's going on and he said bring him here he said what was taking place that insignificant beggar stopped Jesus on his road to Jerusalem he said now your faith can do the same thing tonight he turned around and he began to look and said bring him here what was happening God provided a lamb for blind Bartimaeus eyes he said that same lamb is United tonight for every person and everywhere he's passing by he said let your faith stop him think about that that Jesus was on his road to Jerusalem and they were they were criticizing him they were talking they were doing all kinds of things he meant but he was not even paying attention to what the critics was saying he had he had a vision he had a he had a purpose he had something that he was going to accomplish and as he's walking there's a man that's not even within maybe seeing distance of him he's about 200 or 300 yards away amen but there was something in that man that connected with Jesus and it literally caused Jesus to stop and turn around and say bring him to me and the prophet of God said that was not Bartimaeus his religion it was not his social standing it was not what family he come out of Amen but it was the faith of Jesus Christ that was in Bartimaeus amen that caused Jesus to stand still and I love where the Prophet says and your faith can do the same thing tonight amen that tells me that the faith of God is not dead amen laying in a tomb in Jerusalem but the faith of God is alive and it's well and it's in the hearts of his Believers tonight I think of what the disciples said when they come to Jesus and they said Lord increase our faith how many could say here tonight amen Lord increase our faith amen the Bible says in Hebrews 11 verse 1 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for amen it's the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report amen notice this through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear in the message believe in God he said I'm going to teach a little bit about faith that's what we all need a whole lot of this and he said faith is not an Evidence it's only a substance he said Faith itself is a substance and an Evidence of things amen that the senses of the body will not declare and I thought maybe in teaching this that it would spur your faith up amen deceit to get it to a level Amen to where God can move into you and he can bless you then the prophet was not teaching on faith Amen to condemn the church but he was actually preaching on faith to elevate the church to a place amen that the god of the Bible the god that went by blind Bartimaeus the god that stopped the Widow of saints the Widow of named son rather amen from dying and brought him back to life that same God is in the midst of his church desire and to bless his church amen and when our faith is down there's not much he can do amen though when our faith gets raised to a level amen then we'll see more than church annity but a prophet said amen we will see Apostolic times how many can say I want to see amen Apostolic times the prophet of God said we're trying to give the church into the place to where we can really approach and see Apostolic times moving Among Us that's what we all hunger for is it not amen and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it amen we see healings but we want to see more of them we see amen deliverages but we want to see more of them we see Miracles amen but we want to see more of them is that right amen we see people receiving the Holy Ghost but we want to see more of it we we see people receiving Revelation but we want to see more of it amen than if there's a desire to see more of it amen then there's a God who will honor the desire to see more of it he said we want it in such a way that it'll flow amen and it'll be a help to us and it'll flow out to others now when you start talking about faith the prophet of God says usually people that has Faith amen has experience so he's showing you amen that experience brings Faith amen a person who normally has faith has experience amen and experience brings Faith now I'm just going to lay a foundation here for a second the prophet of God said that faith is not seen he says seen is not believing he said understanding is believing now we see another one you don't doubt amen have heard them say seeing is believing that's an old proverb but that doesn't work because man can sit and look right straight at anything and they'll not see it he said the word see the English word see has so many different meanings to it amen see s-e-a amen might mean a body of water and then s-e might mean to understand or it might mean to look at there's just all kinds of words you can use amen but when you say seen is believing then you're mistaken but when you understand it you believe it when you understand it you believe it Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom in other words he cannot understand the kingdom because the kingdom is the holy spirit in you so you have to understand what that is that is in you and the only way you'll understand it is compare what it makes you do with what the Bible said it would make you do amen amen if faith is in your heart amen there's no question whether it's not bear or not amen because your actions will be manifesting what the Bible said a person who possesses faith will be manifesting he said then your problem solved see he is that Holy Spirit now we all know this by heart that Faith must have amen a resting place and the prophet said anything that's contrary to the word of God Amen faith in God can have no resting place unless it's a promise of God and then it takes its Eternal stand notices it does not take its temporary stand it does not take its momentarily stand amen but it takes its Eternal stand Amen in other words that if faith is based upon the promise of God Amen then conditions will not change a person's faith if faith is built upon a promise of God then circumstances will not cause one to back off of that promise amen may have been anointed by that promise to believe that promise and faith will bring the promise to pass amen I love the way the prophet says it he says faith is the foundation of all things now we start talking about Foundation you can automatically go to Second Peter the first chapter and there you'll find that Peter actually outlines what the prophet of God calls amen the stature of a perfect man and he says see right there there are seven Divine virtues now these are not natural virtues amen but these aren't Divine virtues in the in the book of second Peter 1 verse 3. he said according it's his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and to Virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises amen that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature have an escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence watch this add to your faith amen virtue into your virtue knowledge now right there is the very first virtue that the prophet is going to show us amen as the foundation of the stature of a perfect man amen is the virtue of Faith he said and you must be born again and when you're are born again he said you cannot be born again without having faith that's right so you see I've got the very Foundation faith is the foundation of all of it amen so the foundation of virtue is Faith the foundation of knowledge is Faith among now the foundation of temperance is Faith amen now come on if we're going to start at the foundation we've got to go to the top amen and at the top is the Capstone amen but notice the Capstone is coming down upon the foundation's tone and the foundation stone is Faith he said see without faith it is impossible to please God for he that coming to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him and when you're a skeptic of the Bible when you're a skeptic of the word being right you might as well stay back until you first believe it amen because what is sin it is unbelief and there is only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith you're either controlled by doubt or you're controlled by faith you're possessed of one that dominates your life so it just depends on how much Faith you have is how high you can rise how much Faith you have is how high that you can rise now we know that Faith actually makes it impossible amen our faith actually makes it possible rather Amen to please God in the book of Hebrews 11 6 Paul says without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him remember says in perfect Faith now Faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is and it's impossible to please God without faith you cannot please him if you say you believe God you've never seen him see amen then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith if you could see him it would be no more faith anything that the senses declare is no more faith it's a scientific fact see it's not no more faith amen but you have to accept him by faith and if you could see God it would remove God from being a supernatural God to be in a scientific fact amen but I want to propose to you to not that my God is not a scientific fact amen my God it's not a he is not a scientific God he is not an intellectual God he is not a he is not a psychology God my God is a God who stepped out on nothing and created everything my God is the god that said let there be and there was my God he said God Amen that put the moon in the sky he put the sun in his place he put the sea in his place come on Church our God is not done to us by science our God is not known to us by education our God is known to us by the Simplicity of the faith of Jesus Christ and his return to this age my God is not a scientific fact my God is a living breathing press and reality he's a mighty God he's a he's a holy God he's a faithful God he said God that's never made one promise but what he was able to keep my God is not a scientific fact my God is a faithful God I love here in the book of Hebrews 11. now this is just Bible commentary note so you can take him or leave him in Hebrews 11 Paul says about 15 times he says these words by Faith by faith amen by faith and that means a living acts of faith it is a faith that knows and follows God it communes and fellowships with God it does not matter what a person does without faith he cannot please God without faith a person has to plow through this life all alone and handle all the trials and all the Temptations and all the sufferings and all the accidents and all the diseases and death by himself without faith a person stands all alone in this world Amen utterly without God it is impossible for him to please God and I say this to you according to a prophet that God never intended for his word to be accepted by intellectualism but he intended for his word to be accepted by faith he intended for his word to be preached by faith he intended for his word to be received by faith and the same faith it is preached by is the same Faith it's received by is the same faith that manifests the promise amen that you're receiving by faith amen listen Church neither did he intend for the word amen to be hidden in the mind amen but to be hidden in the heart I love what the prophet of God preaches he does not preach belief from the head he preaches believe from the heart is that okay he doesn't say belief from the head he says believe from the heart in the Book of Proverbs 23 verse 7 the bible says as he faketh in his heart amen so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee in Psalms 119 verse 11 David says amen Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee look here in Romans the 10th chapter and the 10th verse Paul says amen with the heart man believe if let's say that together with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation but say that with the heart man believeth with the mouth he confesses see with the heart he believes and with the mouth he confesses now right there Paul has just connected your heart to your mouth he is right there just made a Divine connection between the heart of a man and the mouth of a man amen because whatever is in the heart of a man is going to cross the lips of a man whatever is is on the control tower of the heart of a man is what he's going to speak by and I might as well preacher for a minute amen I think it's time to clean our hearts up I think it's time to get rid of all the negativity I think it's time to get rid of all the all the doubt and unbelief and skepticism amen because if negative is in your heart amen negative will come across your lips amen but if positive is in your heart amen then out of your heart your mouth is going to speak positive things there is a connection between the heart of a man and the mouth of a man amen and the Heart Believer from the righteousness and the mouth confesses is made into salvation remember said a man can have an intellectual Faith he said that's the reason you see people carrying on and she do under the name of Christianity it's only intellectual Faith what do you mean by intellectual faith brother man believeth unto salvation now Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word now I could preach the word you could accept it and say that's all right yeah I believe that well if that's all the further it ever goes then you'll never get very far with God that's intellectual Faith he said that's the reason people doesn't get healed is because they only have an intellectual view of it amen what their mind conceives the mind will reason the mind will say it cannot be I'm no better my sense of science says that my harm is no stronger than it was yesterday my sense of feeling says I don't feel any different than I did yesterday he said reasoning mental theology will reason out and say wait a minute I believe that's foolishness amen intellectual faith will do that but when once that faith comes down into that compartment down here it'll never question this up here amen all it's absolutely a fact and it'll agree with every Divine word of God if faith is in your heart it will degree it will agree with every Divine word of God I love this tonight amen that the prophet says the reason people doesn't get where they should be it becomes a mental conception of God but when that mental conception you believe him by an intellectual Faith but that won't do it it's got to be a born again experience where your faith is brought down into this compartment here and no matter what it looks like faith says it's so anyhow no matter how dark it is faith says it's going to be okay no matter how cold it is faith says it's going to be okay no matter how weak you may be amen faith will confess the Divine promise of God's Divine word because this is not intellectual Faith this is not mental theology this is not so this is not schooling this is Faith now when you start looking at this intellectual faith I find it amazing that we have got intellectual Faith amen that has produced intellectual conceptions and I'll just go ahead and say it they produced intellectual Faith intellectual conceptions have produced total failures come on Church intellectual faith has produced intellectual conceptions which has in return produced total failures but look what Jesus said in Mark 11 23 he said rarely ask verily I say unto you you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed now I want you to catch something here whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea what's he saying he's saying be thou removed he's saying be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart are you with me Paul said for with his heart a man believeth unto righteousness and with his mouth he confesseth unto salvation and Jesus says whatever you say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart amen but Shall Believe those things which he saith amen shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen there's that connection again that whatever is in the heart is what's going to be crossing the lips and Jesus said if there's doubt in your heart there'll be doubt crossing your lips and the mountain will not move and the Sea will stay in place amen but if faith has taken the control tower in the heart of the believer when that heart speaks Mountain be thou removed and see be cast Into the Depths amen something is going to move because it's more than a heart of Doubt speaking it's a heart of Faith speaking and he shall have whatsoever he's saith listen this believe from the heart he says well it seems like then upon thinking those things that there could be a place in by reading the word of faith that would go beyond the intellectual conceptions Into the Heart for Jesus said if Thou shalt say in thy heart now we get all frustrated in our minds right we go out and say oh I sing that done and once in a while it just hops Skip and so forth but it seems like it just can't get moving rights it's because we try to mix be intellectual with the supernatural they have no dealings with each other at all intellectuals will say one thing and Supernatural will say another and any man that's ever led by the spirit somebody say led by the spirit any man that's ever led by the spirit of God does not take any thought of any intellectual but he's LED from his heart by the spirit of God he's LED from his heart by the spirit of God then in other words what's your belief and you did not learn to believe you was led to believe in other words what you're confessing you did not learn to confess you was led to confess it I'll tell you this the problem of God said whatever God leads your soul to believe that is yours everywhere the soul of your foot sets upon that is your Possession come on church I know it may be a Wednesday night but let's have church anyhow I don't think we got to sit around here and our lips all bound up with depression and our lips all bound up with negativity amen we got a right to speak the word we've got to write to confess the word we got a right to speak the promises I'm on church we got a right to speak positive while we're surrounded by negative we got a right to speak Unity while we're surrounded by division we got a right to speak Faith amen when unbelief endowed is prevailing on every hand we are not the children of unbelief we are not the children of doubt we are the children of Faith by the promise of God we got a right to speak the word we got a right to confess the word we gotta right to confess these promises we have been led to believe I'm on Church we've been led to believe now then this word he is Left Behind on the printed page is a part of him when you accepted by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said his word was life is that right Jesus said his word was life amen but that is exactly what he is John 14 6 he said I am the way I am the truth and the life Romans 8 9 he says if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it up on his lips it's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go amen Satan cannot stand before that man I'm on church amen that's why the prophet said that deity is not in heaven but deity is in the earth then pray tell me brother Tim where is deity it's not in heaven tonight it's in the heart of humanity by the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on church all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was us he poured into the church when that word is in the heart it's placed upon the lips that's the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go amen Satan cannot stand before that man every Mountain has to go among church if you forgot who you are you'll come in here tonight with a mountain in front of you and you won't even open your mouth and confess that Mountain's got to go deity's not in heaven deities in your heart tonight and that mountain that's stopping you from praising God that melting is stopping you from receiving an answer that mountain is stopping you from believing the word with a pure unadulterated faith I say it's time to loose your voice and speak the word with authority and anointing behind it and move forward Church deities not in heaven deity is in you are you hearing me I tell you the reason why the people are backing off the spoken word is because enticing Spirits have been LED out into the church come on now the father God said amen I'm feeling something cold up here if it could be cut off be great amen now today so many people listen to enticing Spirits instead of taking the word of God Amen Spirits they're in the world they're demons and they go out into places and they get amongst men and ministers and they get amongst church members and they get amongst good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that's contrary to the word of God today ministers other congregations are allowing their people he said to play cards in the church and they say well that's Catholic amen that's not Catholic he said that's Protestant too what they're trying to do is a substitutionary something they're trying to adopt some new plan they're trying to adopt education to take the place of the Holy Ghost you will never be able to do it God never intended for a man to be led by education he never intended for man to be led by science he never intended for man to be led by technology he intended for man to be led by the Holy Ghost through the faith of the Holy Ghost that's why Malachi 4 amen was returned and restored what he did not restore the science he did not restore the education he did not restore intellectualism He restored the faith of God among church then tonight friends we are not sitting here as a partially restored church we are not sitting here as a partially restored people but the same faith that was in the beginning in the alpha bride will return in the Omega bride under the voice of the seventh angel and the same faith that was in blind Bartimaeus that caused Jesus to stand still that faith has returned to the church among friends amen make us subdue kingdoms they could stop fires they could put out Devils amen through faith and that is not another fave it's the same faith and that faith has been restored to the church may I propose to you tonight and declare that the faith of Jesus Christ is not dead it is alive and well come on somebody the faith of Jesus Christ is not dead it's alive and it's well all said in Galatians 2. 2 I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me listen to these words and the life which I now live I live in the flesh come on I don't have time to preach there the life I now live I live in the flesh Paul did not become an angel after he met the pillar of fire on the road to Damascus he remained a human being he remained a man with false he remained the man with failures amen but he also received something that could mortify the Deeds of his flesh and could bring that flesh subject to the promise of God's Divine word and Paul could say the life I now live I live in the flesh and I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I live what the prophet of God said he said resurrect us to a living faith in the Living Word of this day then I'll say it to you like this denominationalism has done everything they can Amen to crucify the faith of Jesus Christ but the message of the hour was sent Amen to resurrect amen the faith of Jesus Christ by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost then in the Bible says it like this amen because I live ye live also come on now because I live ye live also he said see speaking to his wife because I live ye live also what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quick and empowered he was waved to them the word which he was was way back to them on the day of Pentecost he said the word made manifest what was way before the church on the day of Pentecost was the word made manifest now and I say it is to be waived again in the last day I'm on church amen what brought Jesus out of the Grave I'll tell you what did it was the faith of God what brought him across the river what brought him across the sea in the storm what's the faith of God how did he stand there and say you call me be Elsie Bob but when you've seen me you've seen the father how did Jesus overcome up on the mountain that day amen how to do all these things he did it by the faith of God and that faith that faith has returned to the church tonight that faith it was in the groom oh my these things bless my heart that faith it was in the groom has been resurrected in the bride that's why you're still pursuing your enemy that's why you're still taking inheritance that's why you're still possessing promises it's because the faith that was in the groom has been resurrected in the bride and what is that Faith the prophet said faith is something that's revealed to you that it's not yet but you believe it will be he said what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God faith is a revelation of the will of God so he says by Revelation then I think tonight we could go through Hebrews 11 and we could read by faith Moses and we could say by Revelation Moses we can read by faith Enoch and according to a prophet we could say by Revelation Enoch see what it was he said the Revelation the spiritual Revelation that the churches today don't even believe in they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system he said but see Faith cometh by hearing I know this is simple but I pray to help then Faith come about hearing and hearing the word of God Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God look at this in perfect Faith he says now Faith we're told in the Bible that Faith cometh by hearing now you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith faith is something that you've got to believe is there when really nothing else will declare it's there but it's there anyhow but brother Walker the only favor to declare it to you is your faith my listen to this he said like my little ego story works is Faith expressed last night he knew when he heard the scream of that mother Eagle now listen there's a lot of difference between that and the cluck of the hen are you hearing me there's a lot of difference between the scream of an eagle and the clerk of the hymn I got to preach on this other day and something come to me amen do you realize that that eagle amen had been birthed under a chicken in a barnyard Little Junior got down to monitor do you realize he had never heard a scream of an eagle he had never heard his mama scream he had never grown up here in Eagle Scream the only thing he ever heard was the clucking of a hymn then pray tell me amen when Mama eagle flew over the Barnyard amen what school did Junior go to to learn the sound of a scream of an eagle tell me what education did Junior sit under Amen to learn what the scream of an eagle sounded like amen but there was something on the inside of him it was a gene seed of an eagle he was an eagle from his birth he was an eagle while he was in the barnyard he was an eagle while he was clucking around with the chickens I'm on church and the brother said you weren't a Christian yesterday you always were a Christian amen see you didn't want to be amen a sinner but you become a sinner by nature but now you heard the gospel and Faith cometh by hearing he said Revelation comes by hearing when Junior heard the scream of the eagle it did not make him an eagle it did not make him as oh it did not make him a Son of God he always was the son of God he always was an eagle the only thing that Junior heard when he heard the scream of that eagle was a revelation of who he really was that's why Baptist ideas wouldn't satisfy you that's why Pentecostal Traditions amen made you sick at your stomach amen because you was an ego he was an eagle from the DNA of almighty God the only thing you needed was not an education was not a religious Seminary what you needed was to hear something that sounded like that Gene that was on the inside of you and the only thing that sent about that Gene was the word of almighty God delivered to you by the faith of God yeah it's a revelation of who you are when that eagle screamed he heard who he was he heard who he always was listen friends Jesus himself had faith I love this Jesus himself had Faith he said the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are the scream of the eagle said Junior was an eagle Junior received the Revelation and got up off the ground oh my and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets all them speak of him he said I am the bread of life that come from God out of heaven I'm the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I and myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you see I love this a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you then a Believer has got to recognize their position as a believer I know that's simple but you got to recognize your position as a Believer you're not a doubter you're not a skeptic you're not a Critic you're a Believer see then in the Book of Romans the 10th chapter when you get home you get time to read and it's a powerful reading you'll read through there and see how that Paul will actually rightly divide amen between Faith and Hope he'll say it like this the prophet he'll say now Faith is Burly he said the greatest enemy faith is God is Hope amen because a person becomes so hopeful till they leave away from Faith he said now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it I believe that sword of God I believe that God will keep his promise hope believes all that but hope then says now I believe that God will heal but look at my condition hope will confess a portion of the word but then he'll back up and say well I don't know about my condition I don't know if God can handle my condition but look what the Bible says about Abraham it says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be the father God said when a faith really takes a hold nothing else stands now let me say it to you like this we are not the recipients of Abraham's hope we are the recipients of Abraham's Faith we're not Abraham's hope seed or Abraham's Faith seed the Bible said that he would stand there and he would call those things which were not as though they were see what Abraham's Faith was his faith was more than expectation are you hearing me his faith was more than just I'm expecting I'm expecting I'm expecting I'm hoping I'm hoping but his faith actually moved under an anointing to become a manifestation look in Genesis 18 10 the Bible said he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Savor thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard in the tent door which was behind him now listen Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age come on now the angel just leaves her house and says you're going to have a child and Abraham's old and he's well stricken and ageless and the rest of this amen and it cease to be with Sarah after the manner of women so Abraham could look and Abraham and Sarah's womb was dead her milk veins would dried up her hair was gray her face was wrinkled his life was gone amen Abraham and Sarah's body was in a terrible condition but their faith was in good shape are you hearing me their body was in a terrible condition but their faith was in a good shape some of y'all may be sitting here tonight Sandra Andrew how can things ever turn around how can things ever get better I see this and I see that and I see this amen but I come to tell you get your eyes off the condition and get your eyes back on the faith of the promise of God I want to tell you this your faith is in a lot better condition than your conditions are well I hope that's okay so then what faith does and when faith comes in faith actually transforms our expectations into manifestation look what Paul says he should be Earnest Romans 8 19 the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for what for the manifestation amen of the sons of God remember said if you just rely on Hope then You Hinder Faith he said hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now see faith says God said so and it's mine that settles that I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick back don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now God said so and that settles it see that's Faith but hope says God said so I'm expecting to get it someday you see I'm expecting someday and as long as Satan can put you off to another day that's as good as he wants that's right you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property he said Faith acts now it's positive so what is creation waiting on they are waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God I love that word manifestation it means to be revealed foreign they are waiting on the revealing of the sons of God it means to disclosure of Truth it is concerning things before unknown it is used in advance by which things are states are persons amen hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestation it is the appearance how do you remember a few minutes ago when I showed you that there was a statue of perfect man what did I tell you the foundation of it was Faith the foundation of the pyramid was Faith adoption number two in the Bible we're living in the last days he says we're at the top of the pyramid the Crawfish is the cancer age and the Zodiac in the time of the coming the Leo the Lion the captain Stone in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the Bible see where we're at we're right at the end time but this is the day of the manifestation of the sons of God can I reach another adoption part four did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many ever know about how many knows Jesus said that which God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they had full domain over Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over oh my here we are Satan took it over he took over his sonship he took over his godship he lost it amen watch this but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top amen the full sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to you among church are you hearing me the foundation brother Amos that was at the bottom of the pyramid would be the same Foundation that would return at the top in the manifestation of the sons of God and they would not be Jesus coming down and send Satan take your hands off of God's Property but it would be in a five foot frail body who would stand on a platform and turn this back and say I take every spirit in this building under my control for the glory of God where was that Faith coming from it was coming from the restoration of the truth of the word of God I pray that's just making sense go right back to Genesis he said watch for the manifestation of the sons of God I love this when true Sons boy Sons true Sons born Sons field Sons speak let me read that again true Sons born scent field sense believe is that what he said no he said speak and their word is backed so it's in your heart is going to come across your lips and when you speak that word there's going to be an authority come behind that word and he said I believe we're on the border of it right now say to this mountain let it be so brother I desire so and so a certain thing I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's a manifestation oh brother my crop is burning up out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll see rain in the name of the Lord God bless your crop he said what waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning then what was at the beginning will return at the ending what was in the alpha will be in the Omega what was in the foundation will be in the Capstone now do you realize that Matthew 21 when Jesus come around in town how many members had Jesus come riding into town amen I I wonder if I if I could get some water would be good Matthew 21 they come riding in the town and what were they under they was under the expectation of the manifested son somebody say son s-o-n the manifested son singular they were waiting for the the the coming of the manifested son singular but in Romans 8 the Bible says that we are under the manifestation of the expectation rather of the manifested sons so what was in the sun will be in the sons the father God said it is very apparent that she ought to be called bad for she was predestinated in him came from the same Source was eternal with him and is now manifesting God in a many membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you brother amen praise the Lord in a many membered body let me say it to you like this he is the same yesterday today and forever in every way except a Corporal body so people say well does he not have a Corporal body he does have a Corporal body and remember he said all Bible Believers believe he will return a physical literal Corporal body of Jesus Christ but listen to this he said one day he's coming back in flesh again he said but once Jesus was a God man he said now he was part God he was part man in one sense and the other he said see the lamb was one creature the dove was another creature when the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh that's right and now he's manifested in your flesh sure by being adopted Sons and Daughters to the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right you become joint heirs with the Lord Jesus Christ old church you've got the power if you got the faith to use it with you've got the power but you've got to have faith to use that power with then what was the Super sign the super sign amen was God manifested in flesh how many knows the prophet that God says it like this he said there's doors to doors in the heart he said there's a door of Pride he said there's a door of lust he said there's all kinds of doors he said rather he said the door of Pride he said lust will try to get in there he said then there's a Door of Faith he said now what will happen he is he said the people will let Creeds and traditions stand in front of the door of faith and will literally bar that door and won't let Jesus Christ get in there he said because if Jesus got in there he said the first thing he would do is he would cry out I'm the same yesterday today and forever and he said everybody whatever he said everything would have to confess that's the truth he said but when that door is open to Jesus Christ he said then you receive Christ's faith in there and Christ's Faith recognizes the word what are you saying I'm saying that the faith of the Son of God has returned in the heart of manifested sons of God and they are performing The Works of almighty God you're not just human beings you're not just church members you are anointed Messiah now can I read this to you I know I'm reading a lot but I'm laying some word in tonight I pray that's okay Revelation 2 13 Jesus says This I Know Thy works and we're thou dwellest even where Satan said is and now hold as fast my name and what it has not denied my faith even in those days where an Antipas was a faithful martyr who was slain among you he said we're Satan dwelleth so in Acts the third chapter the 16th verse you read that the Bible says in this and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong now y'all remember what this was there was a man who was lame who had been sitting by the gate called beautiful right and Peter and John pass by him and they didn't have they didn't have money they didn't have silver they didn't have gold but they perceived that they had faith and they said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee right and when they said that he said immediately he received strength stood up on his speed and ran into Solomon's porch rejoicing not when that man done that it caused quite a stir I mean he was a church disturber I mean it cost a big stir and look what it says in Acts 3 16 it says the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all I love how Brethren picks this up in the church age book he said when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place up on the once again a beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name through faith in his Jesus name hath made this man a formal strong yea the faith which is by from him Jesus hath given him the man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all are you ready for this see there it is Jesus name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith any more than he claimed it was his own human name he said that Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus performed that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 2 13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith he had given to the Believers oh God Romans 12 3 says the corner has got to dealt to every man notice this The Measure of Faith in the pergamian church age they were humanized and salvation haven't turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord having cast aside the doctor of election and opened wide the church door and their Fellowship to any and all who subscribed to their tenants never mind the word but in this age of Rapid degradation I'm closing here in a minute there will still the few who had the measure of that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only use that faith in Acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church they knew that no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus himself as today church is filled with mental believers who endorse the Virgin birth the shed blood going to church taking communion and are not reborn at all even so on that third age was the same problem listen human Faith wasn't enough in and it's not enough now it takes the very Faith to the Son of God Amen to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith this was the same faith that Paul said I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the Son of God they had given him life and kept him living a Christian Victory no they had not denied salvation or Supernatural from start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name and his faith and they were blessed by the Lord and accounted Worthy of him Jesus name are you awake Jesus name Jesus faith comes together at the top of the pyramid the same faith in a manifested adopted Sons and Daughters of God listen friends we're not looking back at what used to happen there's people sitting right here tonight with Jesus faith Jesus name and they're seeing Jesus's miracles performed every day what are you saying preacher I'm saying the faith of God is back in the Earth today your faith can stop God your faith can speak and squirrels come into existence your faith can stand to look at a storm and say go back and let the sunshine are you hearing me the faith of an insignificant beggar 200 yards away from Jesus walk into Jerusalem ignoring the criticism ignoring the naysayers doing the father's business felt a pool from an insignificant blind man and he turns and he says why bring him here why why should we bring him there Lord I perceive I've been touched by something can I propose it to you like this that's the faith that was in the shoot em out woman [Music] can I say it to you like this that's the faith that was in the woman in Memphis an insignificant remember I said a little insignificant black lady in the ghettos of Memphis walked in there and saw her boy laying there dine and went back to the Bible and said God this is my son you gave him to me and eyes is like that shoot them out woman okay I'm like that shoot him out woman Lord here's the sick boy on his deathbed here's your word but where is your Elijah he said something moved her to the outside of her house and she went and stood against the post now I I pray it's okay to share this it's not been confirmed okay it's just been it's been told me several times actually in Memphis right now if you go look I've tried to I've tried to confirm it but I can't really but I think it's a good point to make if it's really confirmable we'll confirm it one day in Memphis there is a pyramid Bass Pro Shop it is said to believe that we're that pyramid sets today is where that woman's house was when brother Brandon walked by now if you go look at it according to GPS it's really not that far away from the airport again it's not been confirmed but I can't help believe brother Sean if there's not something significant about that she stands out there against that against that that mailbox that fence post and remember said here I am flying home and all of a sudden there comes an announcement we gotta land the plane Rick I'm getting ready to land this one okay we've got to land the plane amen you realize on that plane was businessman was important people was people of renowned but there was a woman on the earth whose Faith was stronger than any CEO of any company on that plane her faith was stronger than any important businessman or accountant on that plane and all of a sudden the plane ride's going smooth there's no issues everybody's doing good and all of a sudden the light comes on and the captain looks at the co-pilot and says what does that mean he gets the manual out he says it means ground the plane right now isn't it strange they didn't ground it 100 miles away they didn't ground it 200 miles away they grounded it right where the face of that woman was crying out for the god of the Bible to come by her way and confirm a promise come on now remember he said they put me up in that Peabody Hotel right he said I got up there in that Peabody Hotel he said next morning went out to mail some letters he said as I was going down the road I was singing I'm one of them said just met up with you Pentecostal people the other day I'm one of them he said I realized I've mailed all the letters for the Amos it was time to turn and go back but there was a voice of Faith there was a pool of Faith there was a cry of faith brother to him that was saying I got a boy that's dying I got a boy that's on his way to hell if God don't intervene and the insignificant faith of that woman kept on pulling Elijah against his own scientific understanding I got to get back the plane's going to leave I got to get back but he said I kept on following the leading to the Holy Spirit and he said all of a sudden I walked down into a neighborhood and there was a woman and she looked at me and said morning person he said I tipped my hat and said wait a second how did you know I was a person how did you know I was a person she said I've been waiting on you I've been waiting on you do you see what happened the faith of that woman got in touch with the faith of almighty God and it got in touch with his prophet and that insignificant woman's Faith landed a plane oh God these things are too rich to think about sometimes landed that plane and he said I'll walk there and she said listen God give me a boy and he's gone away from God and he's laying in there dying would you come in and pray for him she said he said yes I will he said I walked in that little Shanty he said I've been in King's palaces he said never felt more welcome in all of my life foreign walk in there and say do you know who I am I'm William Branham I'm Elijah I prayed for thousands but he walked in there and he said ma'am he said how about you pray first how about you pray first and a boy laying there moaning and groaning and saying oh it's getting dark oh it's getting dark oh it's getting dark he said all of a sudden that woman began to pray he said by the time she got done praying I knowed she had talked to God before he said she got done praying I said a prayer and said by the time I got done praying that boy started saying oh Mama it's getting light in here oh Mama it's getting light in here he said what happened he said I left there he said I started back to the point back to the airport he said I just knew when I walked in I'd miss my flight he said but as soon as I stepped in the door they said last call last call for Louisville Kentucky he said and I got on my flight he said in two years later standing in a train station a boy come up to me and said sir you don't remember me but I remember you my Mama Prayed and you come by our house and you prayed over me and God healed me and listen he didn't just heal my body but he saved my soul and the father God said see that is the benefit of form the leadership of the Holy Ghost then I say Faith Tabernacle why don't we live up to our name unless the faith of God Amen drop into our hearts unless the face of God speak across our lips and confess the promise of God's word and no matter how dark ugly cold it gets we'll speak the word and we'll confess the promise and we'll move forward let our musicians come tonight [Applause] the faith of God has connected in the heart and the heart and the mouth had been connected and now there's a bride manifested Sons and Daughters of God confessing the word with authority brother Andrew well that mountain moved well that mountain move can I tell you what a prophet said he said there's no more guesswork can I just tell you what he said he said I want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself from the power of God we are too close to the end I believe the church is in condition where we can teach a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out see and get into something real something that you know and if you say brother random that isn't the light yeah I know it's the light how do you know it's a lot I'm looking at how well how do you know that couldn't be wrong my sight has always declared to me that was lightsy and that's the reason I believe in those visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it thus saith the Lord see because it's beyond the human thinking it's up into the Realms of the Lord's thinking but you're standing here just as a branch producing the fruit that's in the vine and see God uses man and man only what are you saying I'm saying what a prophet said there's no more guesswork in it somebody might say brother Andrew what is guesswork it's the process of trying to guess or estimate something without knowing all the facts for information can I tell you some other words for guesswork guessing uh Superstition assumption perception suspicion speculation hypothesia theorizing prediction expectation approximations rough calculations feelings hunches guesstimates perfect faith has removed every one of them and the prophet said there's no more guesswork in it we find the faith of God is in the church once you stand your feet with us this evening do you love the Lord how many can say Lord thank God we've made it to the top of this pyramid thank God we made it to the top of this pyramid thank God we've moved and we're built upon the foundation thank God we're built upon the foundation the foundation of faith and what was manifested by the Bob at the bottom is being manifested at the top I know I've shared this testimony here but I just feel led to share it again is meeting like this one day out and same at Browning's church I was preaching got to preaching along these lines about manifest adopted Sons and I said God's faith is in your heart I said like this you got the right to speak the word you got the right to speak the word and I said you got the right to fire the devil tonight and I told a little simple illustration when I told that illustration brother Brian Hanna was sitting back where you are brother Sean brother Wayne's son-in-law and he had been suffering in his shoulder and his going through therapy and stuff and he had to show that shoulder problem and I said you got a right to fire that devil and when I said that I didn't know what he's going through he spoke out and said I fired the demon of shoulder pain went home that night and was doing stuff and his wife come in and said have you done your your exercises or therapy or whatever and he said you know come think of it he said I fired that devil in service night and he said my shoulder ain't even hurting me now completely well what are you saying I'm saying the faith of God in Jesus name has returned to flesh listen friends whatever mountain is before you tonight it does not have a right to stay there when a Spirit-filled son spirit-born son takes the word of God in his heart confesses it on his lips it's the same as deity speaking let's bow our hearts together tonight maybe you're here tonight and you need a a miracle

trust that you were blessed and if you were well it's probably your fault amen because uh that was some good preaching right there amen and uh I tell you what don't let the devil just steal that away from you now you know we've got as Jesus said you know there's that four kinds of grounds and one of them grounds you know is when he when they went to trials it went through uh hard times in that and Satan was able to take that word away from him you know then the cares of life and all that took the word away from them but then there was that ground that was fertile a man that would not that's if Satan could not take that seed away can you say man could not take that seat away and they produced a hundredfold amen so we're we're that we're that people that's producing a hundredfold amen and so amen praise the Lord amen so uh it's it's good just to have everyone who was gone over the weekend uh back in the house of God and brother Jr and his family and Daniel and his family been gone and so we we certainly glad to have them back and um and Josh good to have you uh here and with us and brother Tim and sister Theresa with us God bless you all amen and just always glad to have the people of God and appreciate brother Terry and brother Josiah even for taking the services uh Sunday and I just heard a good report and so we thank the Lord for that and we had good Services there at brother Josh Bennetts and pray that we were a a blessing there and we want to remember this Sunday uh uh instead of having one service we're going to have two and uh it's going to the morning service be at 10 evening regular time at four and uh being it's the Thanksgiving that really that snuck up on us fast and knew it was coming I just didn't know how soon but um so um we usually have um Sunday night before Thanksgiving we usually have testimony in song and uh so that that's what we're going to be having uh Sunday night is uh testimonies if you got a testimony of what the Lord done for you this year uh we we would love to hear hear about it and if you got a song we want you to sing it and uh we always just it's just a good time and so uh if if you're able to come we would certainly enjoy that amen and so um trying to think here um Wednesday night next Wednesday night Thanksgiving Eve we will not be having service so we want to remember that and and then um don't want to put too much on you but we'll I'll have sister Martha to send it out as well but then the following Sunday after Thanksgiving we'll just have one service at 11. and so just keep that in mind but uh but as for now we'll look forward to what God has in store for us Sunday morning amen and so invite invite your friends to come amen and I had heard that a young lady and her husband was here last Sunday and we want to keep them in prayer brother Kevin I had spoke to the young lady at on the job site actually it was pretty pretty early huh and uh it's actually it was actually dark uh uh and he was just by himself on the job in his van and waiting you know for uh I don't know to get lighter get and get motivation to get out you know I don't know uh but uh I just say it was the Lord that kept him there but uh he uh pitched dark and and he knocked on the on the window and uh it would have scared me and uh but he rolled down the window and there's this lady uh there and I I don't know the whole conversation he could tell you more about it but yeah she told him she said something woke me up and told me to walk down here she says I'm needing I'm needing help and um so she just kind of talked to him a little bit about just needing the Lord and but she said something just woke me up and I walked here said my husband's still in bed asleep don't know I'm here and but said you know you know so brother Kevin told her he's a Christian and and just began to talk to her and told her about the service so her and her husband came Sunday and we pray that they were blessed and but we want to keep them in prayer I don't think these things are coincidental amen and I believe she came to the right person that could talk to her about the Lord and so keep them in prayer keep one another in our prayer I have noticed that uh sister Brenda's not here tonight sister Alice and different ones so I don't know if sickness or what but we want to just keep them in our prayer that the Lord will just touched them amen praise the Lord keep brother Andrew in your prayer that the Lord will just give him strength in his body let's just bow our heads and as we dismiss and Daniel do you want to pray for us
