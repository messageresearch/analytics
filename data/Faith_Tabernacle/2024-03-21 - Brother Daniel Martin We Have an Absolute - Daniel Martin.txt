we love you and we thank you Father have your way tonight as our prayer in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight the musicians can be dismissed amen I enjoyed the uh the song specials tonight but if you could turn your Bibles to uh uh the book of Acts man acts chapter 2 amen if you're there say Amen Acts 2 verse 25 says for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou Willl not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thou Hast made known to me the ways of life thou has make me full of joy with thy countenance men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried and his uh Seiler is with us unto this day therefore being a prophet and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption amen can can we s can we read that 25 and 26 again for David speaketh concerning him I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall Rest In Hope because thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither W thou see thy Holy One to see corruption amen you can be seated amen I just have a really simple thought on on my heart um I I know you all know this but I pray that it can be a blessing and encouragement to you in some way but if I were to maybe have a a title tonight I would like to U maybe titled it we have an absolute and um I'm thankful that we have an absolute tonight amen and U and the absolute according to the Webster dictionary is says it's perfect in itself it's Unlimited in power uh primarily and ultimate and absolute it's the last word it's the amen it's unlimited there's nothing else in its way it's the Supreme it's an it's it's an ultimate amen and if we're ever going to accomplish anything we must first have an absolute now anything tied to uh any great achievement in the world today has been an absolute and uh to every person everything that's been done there has to been an absolute connected with it and man cannot by no means achieve anything until there comes somewhere where they recognize that there is an absolute and there's got to something for It's the final tying post as brother brandham says that absolute it's that Ty that final tying post we can take uh construction for an example when when you are to build a house uh you know you must you must have a blueprint to be your tying post it's got to be your absolute it's got to be something that you depend on and uh that blueprint is the very that you depend on to get your house to be what it was meant to be in the first place and without that blueprint you would just have a lot of guess work you know you you would just say well I I don't know what we're going to do we can put this over here we can put that over there I don't know the original plan to it and then the next thing you know you've got a lot of Chaos in your houses is just an Ever So in ever which way and and uh you know we'll put it over here we'll put the bathroom over here to see what happens you know and and you know even though the plumbing is over here let's put it over here and and it just causes chaos so we must stick to that to that blueprint and um you know and if I were to have someone here uh you know help me build a house you know maybe brother Bill and maybe I asked brother bill that I wanted uh to build a house and and I wanted to put a bathroom they say we want to put a bathroom over here and uh and you know and I begin to start working on it well brother bills has a you know maybe a little question so he walks over there to the blueprint and uh he looks at it and he maybe comes to me and he says well why why are you putting it over here well because I want to I want to put over here well that's not what the blueprint is saying and I can fuss with him I can argue with him I can complain I can do everything I can to to say that it goes here but the solute says that the bathroom goes over there and that's the same thing today and and you know I can I can fuss we gives you the right you know and and and then he walks over there and and he tells me and that the blueprint is our absolute amen and God has given us a set of blueprints today amen he's given us a set of blueprints to follow and there are many people in the world who is reading this blueprint there's many people in the world reading it and not understanding this blueprint so uh uh uh so uh when they begin to put their own ideas they begin to put their own interpretation and and in the end all they've built is fine churches all they've built is fine denominations all they built uh on an absolute a foundation of man's Creeds and ideas amen and what happens when someone doesn't understand a set of blueprints so what we get the architect in there if we start reading this blueprint and we don't understand it we get the architect in there and you said hey you Design This you you tell me what why this goes here you tell me why this goes over here and then and if you can explain it to me then I'll do it I'll be able to I'll begin to catch that Revelation and I'll begin to build according to the blueprint amen and the man who designs the blueprint needs to explain what we don't understand amen and it's the same thing today with the Bible we've got a lot of people giving their own ideas we've got a we've got a lot of people giving their own interpretation and and it's put us all in confusion is what has happened what it's done and and so we needed a a guide we needed we needed a blueprint we needed uh we we what we didn't understand and what we needed was we needed someone who uh wrote the word we needed someone we needed an architect who wrote the blueprints in the first place to come in and explain it amen so so uh so as we begin to uh and so what we needed was that architect the man who designed the plan so what happened what what happened happen we we couldn't understand this Bible we had we had the Baptist saying that that they were the right ones and we had the Pentecostal saying that they were the ones and it was putting everybody in confusion and so what we needed was we needed we needed a prophet to come in this day to explain to us the blueprints amen amen and we needed someone uh to to uh to to dissolve all the doubts amen and and and and God brought us a message that we can anchor Our Lives upon and we can watch it line up with the original word right amen because of this message we now have an absolute amen it's become our tying post and I can tie my family to it I I can tie my time to it I can tie my faith to it Jesus says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words will never fail amen that's my absolute amen now uh Paul had a Christ centered life and um uh if it's okay I'm going to take Paul as an example here for for a few minutes and uh Christ was Paul's absolute and but before Paul had a great teacher he was taught under G uh gel um he had a great teacher he was under uh the denomination of his Pharisee background he was taught he was schooled and he was uh uh brother brandham said he had a great background right brother Bram says he was a scholar beforehand he was a mighty man in the scriptures but he didn't have any TI poost but the Sanhedrin that was his only tist was the Sanhedrin that would that would back him up and and a diploma from a great teacher he was a great man in his field but he was waving only thing that he had his absolute would only be as strong as his or organization was that's all the stronger he could be and he was working faithful to that and was taking Christians and binding them and making uh making Havoc of them and even Stone Steven so so we take Paul you know H he was well-learned he was uh he was a great scholar uh he was under that uh uh he was under the teacher that uh that was well known this teacher if you look up his name uh Galeo if I can say it right uh if you look him up he the history tells you all about him and and Paul was under that leadership but it was the wrong absolute Paul had the wrong absolute he become unstable he was persecuted the Christians he even stoned stepen my and and now he was on the road brother Bram says to Damascus with all of his education set under a great teacher and how that he had been taught in all the Jewish religion and yet with all that he was flimsy and did not have the ability to do certain things see his absolute was his teaching his uh whatever gal said that's the way it went he and he become unsteady amen until one day on his way to Damascus to persecute the Christians all of a sudden there was a light and a thunder and he was spitten and he fell to the ground and he looked up and there was a light shining and that same light that led the children of Israel through the through the Wilderness amen that same light that that that that appeared to to Mary it had now appeared to uh uh to to to Paul amen and it come and blinded his eyes amen and it was so promised so real to him until it blinded eyes he couldn't see totally blind with a pillar of fire blazing him right in the face and he heard a voice saying saw saw why why persecutest thou me and he said Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus that was all Paul needed to know once he recognized who he was and he received it and he then had an absolute that would never fail amen he was never the same after that he went straight uh uh from church to church from place to place trying to build up that which he had tried to tear down why his teachings didn't do it for him his knowledge of the Scrolls didn't do it for him amen it was an absolute he had to come face to face with the pillar of fire he had to come face to face with uh Jesus Christ amen but that one time in his presence that one time that light has changed his life amen he started walking different he started talking different and every one of us here tonight needs to come before that uh Pillar of Fire we we need to have a face to face you begin to walk different you'll begin to start talking different amen and when we can surrender our ownselves when we can surrender our own ideas and come face to face with that light right amen we'll start walking different we'll start talking different amen those things that we once depended on will no longer have an effect on our Lives why because we've let the word of God have prance in our lives amen prise the Lord amen no matter how many people would try to come to to Paul and tell him that he was a fanatic and they maybe called him a Holy Roller and told him that he was crazy and and called him this or they called him that he could stand there and take them to back to the place where he had met the master amen he could take them to the place uh he could take them to that absolute that he had depended on to bring them through a shipwreck amen delivered him from being stoned he was uh delivered from a poisonous snake he just shook that snake Into the Fire amen he knew where his faith was amen he was tied down to the word of God Amen and without an absolute our lives would be a wreck amen without an absolute our lives would be a wreck and man it's just like a ship a ship has an absolute yes sir and that ship's absolute is the anchor excuse me now when the ship is tossed ing Waters where easily it could be thrown against a rock or or busted up or it hit the ground where the water is not deep enough and the great swells coming up H will The Flash the ship will turn over it's got to have deep Waters to float in in order for that ship to stay alive it's it's got to be in the it can't it can't go into shallow Waters it can't go it's got to have something that to keep them in that deep amen and if he begins to and and if he goes into the shallow Waters maybe the waves had come and it would knock and beat against that ship and that ship would sank and a ship with the anchor uh brother Bram says a ship with the anchor that Great Mighty T of metal that it drops down a Ste and it goes down and it goes down until it hits the top of the bed of the ocean somewhere in the top of a mountain and that great anchor pulls and the waves Rock the ships till it strikes its great big Spears into a rock and there the ship has an absolute it's anchored where uh might where the waves might toss it about but still that ship can stand just perfectly still where it's anchored because it has an absolute to it amen that ship can be tossed about and the storms can rage on and the waves can just just flood over the ship but as long as there is an anchor there that ship will not be moved oh amen we can put put our absolute in our jobs we can put our absolute in our family when a man and a woman gets married there has to be an absolute to that marriage or it won't last amen if you put your absolute in in his or her beauty well that beauty will eventually fade you know the wrinkles will begin to come that old age will settle in and and if you're not anchored my amen and if you put your absolute in his being nice and him being sweet maybe maybe you've seen his ni side and I know my wife sees my nice side all the time you know and uh well that's not true so you know maybe as we're dating you know and as as a young couple is dating they see they you know they become all lovey doy and and you know it's all about her it's all about him and and you know you never see an argument you're always talking soft and you're all the time sending the flowers where where Now you kind of forget to send in the flowers and you know and and you know if you're not careful it can cause a a Havoc you know but but if you put your absolute and him being nice all the time amen wait till you have your first fight amen it's not loveby deby all the time but if you put your absolute and what brought your marriage together in the first place which should be your love amen let the arguments come let the beauty fade let the storms rage on because at the end of the day you can always come back together because it was love it was the absolute that you built your marriage upon oh amen our job can be our absolute it can dictate how you run your how your life is run your girlfriend your boyfriend can be your absolute we can put our absolute in our guns tonight your money can be your absolute amen which you can tie yourself to but what are you going to do when you have no job what are you going to do when when your girlfriend or your boyfriend decides to leave you what are you going to do when when your guns fail what are you going to do when your money is all gone amen what are you going to do when your medicine runs out or it don't work for you hey man what are you going to do when your friend leaves you you've got to have some place where you can tie down to something that'll never fail something that'll never leave you in your darkest times amen amen I'm talking about an absolute tonight amen amen we must always use the word of God because there's no other TI poost that's great as that because both heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail what a TI poost oh myall if you're if Christ is your absolute then let the storms rage on Let the Fire Fall let the waves rise if you are tied to him in that manner no matter what anybody says how hard the per persecution gets how bad the storm seems to be how it looks and possible for it to happen if something has happened in you that Christ becomes your absolute or any promise in the Bible becomes your absolute if you are sick and you are praying for healing and something Becomes of that strikes that promise in the Bible I've got it there's nothing that's going to wave you from it amen I've anchored my soul in the Haven of Rest when all else fails when when when everything when I feel all alone I have something that I can cleave to oh oh my have anchored my soul amen Amen brother Bram says what the Christian needs today in this atomic age in this time of uncertainty you need something besides just an experience of joining Church you need an anchor an absolute that you know because he's the absolute oh because churches will fail and people will fail but Christ cannot fail he's the absolute to the believer and if Christ is your absolute you are tied to him and if he is your absolute you are tied to him then you're tied to the word oh my Christ and the word is the same amen now God is going to put us to the test to see if we really believe him to be our absolute he's going to put our faith to the test amen we must know who we really have our anchor tied to amen he's going to send us tests he's going to send us trials he he may send some friends or family some someone off the street street but but he's going to put our faith to the test Amen brother Bram says some of them today it's going to get more than ever as the days go by that we're going to see people with this as Jesus said form of godliness and just a form it's coming into we've had it in the Methodist the Baptist and so forth for years and now it's creeped over into the Pentecostals and may I say this it's creeping into the message amen it's it's somewhat creeped into the message ranks that we we have people saying oh I believe the message but it's time to take uh but it's time to take God at his word and well I believe the message but if you can't find it in what brother Brenham says in the word then you don't have to believe it oh come on now well that's just brother Brandon's opinions and well I don't know if he really meant that well brother Brandon was using psychology brother Brandon continues to say now little Roots Will Rise Up from off the highway come in and wrap around and around that tree and you think it's very Innocent but the wrong uh but the first thing you know it's got such a hold on on you until it pulls you the wrong way makes you lean the the wrong way and so uh Phil uh uh philosophies and things entered among us until it's be begin to pull us towards the world you take a sharp twoed sword of God and cut free from everything and stay right on that word cuz that is the ultimate that's the absolute to every believer amen amen the Bible says There Will arise fall false Christ and false prophets and we'll try to deceive the very elect if it were possible amen I'm so thankful it's not possible oh man this word is why we press through every battle amen as long as we're anchored in the word of God nothing can move you stay with the word stay with the message amen this word is why preachers preach day and night and they they're tired and their bodies are run down down but they keep pressing on because it's life to the believer this message is life to every believer amen this message has put families back together this message has put set the captives free I've seen it I'm a witness of it oh my this message can take a ranked Sinner and turn his life around no theology can do it no uh no uh man's ideas can do it right but it's the unadulterated word of God that does it amen and that's where I place my absolute because it can't fail amen amen that's why Paul he was taken to Rome to be beheaded he could have possibly gathered an army to fight back he could have possibly escaped made somehow he could have possibly escaped his captives but he could look death in the in the face and and say oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your victory oh history says that as the guards were leading Paul to The Chopping Block as soon as he as soon as Paul seen it he broke free from the guards and he and he ran to the block and placed his head there waiting for them to take his life why because he had an absolute that death wasn't the end it was just the beginning oh my many Believers were fed to the Lions many were f h burned at the steak many were ripped apart many were flayed alive why because uh many of the women many of the women had their their babies just ripped out of them oh my and age after age they gladly suffer for the gospel's sake why because they knew there had to come a final day there had to come a final age there one day there there had to come to an end of all the trials there had to come an end to it so they pressed on and they kept pressing on they kept passing that Paton until now it's finally reached your hands now it's up to you to finish the race oh my and let me say this don't let your trials bring you down don't let bitterness bring you down don't let disappointments in yourself bring you down disappointments in others bring you down Paul says in Romans 8:35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ so tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Pearl or sword for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 39th verse nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen we've got one goal in mind and that's Heaven we've got one goal in mind and that's to reach the end that's that's to see those Pearly Gates amen oh my we whether we go by the grave or whether we go by the Rapture our goal is to reach heaven hallelujah amen we must stay true we must never waver to the left or to the right we must keep our Compass focused on the word keep it focused amen the death isn't death isn't H the end for our believer amen that's why when we lose the loved one we don't have to take to the bottle when lose a loved one we don't have to take the pills we don't have to take the drugs amen we don't have to live a depressed life we have a word that says we're going to see them again and I've anchored my soul into that word amen that's what's kept us pressing through after Mom pass that's what's kept us our alive that's what kept us our heads up that's why this message has has kept us going we've never looked back cuz death is not the end hallelujah amen it's the beginning hallelujah amen as believers we must have an absolute yes sir we must have something we can anchor our faith upon Lord brother brandham says and if a man or a woman is filled with the Holy Spirit your heart within you will punctuate every promise of God with an amen that's right now see you must get that absolute that's something that's real that identifies you with Christ and his word yes the word is Christ and you must be sure that you can say Amen to that word or your absolute is wrong you've got it build on some Creed you say oh I believe Christ but I don't believe that stuff I believe Christ but I don't believe this then your absolute is wrong your absolute is in some Creed and not in Christ because Christ is the word amen we can take we can be like the foolish man who built his house upon the sand oh no or we can be like the wise man who built his house upon a rock and that rock being Christ amen that foolish man you see he might have built a beautiful home he he could have had the finest of everything in the world he had the world had to offer yeah no matter how beautiful that house was oh it was great it was big oh he invited his friends to come look at it and it was oh it was a beautiful mansion you know maybe he maybe maybe it was big enough and to to have the prayer meetings maybe it was big enough to to to to have the young people over for a Bible study or or for some fellowship you know he may may maybe he built that you know as a religious man maybe this man was religious you know and he he he was trying to do God of service and maybe he built this big mansion for the glory of the Lord you know and yet the foundation that he built his house upon was weak amen oh uh it was beautiful yet it was built on man's tradition it was built on man's Creeds and ideas yet it was not it was n strong enough to handle the trials oh it wasn't strong enough to handle the Temptations amen it wasn't strong enough to accept Jesus Christ as the same yesterday today and forever oh that's what he built his house upon amen it wasn't strong enough to accept brother brandham as fulfilling Malachi 4 oh it wasn't accepting it was built for for uh taking what brother brandham says is the absolute oh it wasn't strong enough and yet it fell to the ground because it was built on the wrong absolute amen but that wise man you see maybe it wasn't so fancy maybe his house wasn't so big and you know may may maybe it wasn't much to look at maybe it wasn't maybe it wasn't big to hold the parties and and carrying on and things like that but yet him and his family could sleep peacefully every night no knowing he had built his house on the right foundation oh my and how the storms came how the trials would come and and The Temptations would come and and knowing and they beat on that house over and over and over again yet he could go to bed every night and get some rest every night knowing he had built on the right foundation amen it would be built to withstand everything the devil would throw at it am amen why because it was built on a firm foundation on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds is sink in sand Amen Let Them Thorns rage on Let The Tempest blow amen as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord amen Let The Trials come let the sickness come let the winds blow my house is built on a firm Foundation right my life is built on a firm foundation amen we have a right to every word of God Amen that's right Hitler was Germany's absolute whatever Hitler said had to go because he had the final say so Pharaoh was EG Egypt's absolute they had to do everything Pharaoh said because he was their absolute and brother BR says if we were to go down to Egypt today and and and look where Pharaoh once ruled in Egypt it would be empty and they they've had to dig 20 ft down uh just to find where he once ruled and they've made some historic out of the place and everyone that had placed that had placed Pharaoh that have placed Hitler as their absolute perished with them my what a terrible absolute to place your absolute into into something that's going to perish into something that can't help you into something that will perish maybe before you will amen they they put their absolute in in Hitler and put their absolute in pharaoh and so many other people today they're putting their absolute in Trump today you know they're looking for Trump to come back to be their Savior and and you know Trump May passed and and Hitler they passed and yet those people were standing there like now they were left without an absolute and then they ended up perishing with her absolute oh my now we have an absolute in our ball game games amen football uh for those who know a little bit about football referee is the absolute for baseball it's the Umpire amen is the absolute now sometimes you know we don't like his decisions but but it's the absolute we don't like what the Empire calls out we don't like what the referee calls out oh we've seen it with our own eyes and we know it was this and we know it was that but once the referee has made the call once the the the empire the Empire the Umpire has made that final call that's that's final that's the final word once he says it's out it's out it don't matter what you say oh you can argue with it oh my but it's the final say he has the final say amen he might say it's a strike or whatever he might or whatever it is we can argue with him but the absolute in that ball game you can fuss you can throw your hat out there and protest but it's a strike anyhow now if we think a minute what if what if there was no ire to the game what if there was no referee to the game amen what if there was no absolute in the game the game would be in chaos you would have this side coming over and and saying they did it and then sometimes sometimes when we play volleyball you know we some of us say it was out and the other on say it was in and and so when we're going back and forth we we take an elder we take someone and we say well you are the final you are the final decision whatever you say goes so he becomes our absolute right and without that absolute we have a bunch of chaos amen and you know red light is an absolute brother Rand says that the red light is the absolute to the traffic H what what if that red light doesn't work amen what what what if the red light went out when you get there well one says well I got here first and the other one says well I'm in a hurry to work well it doesn't matter I was here first and next thing you know you got someone else coming you got a four-way stop and and and it's kind of comical when when you get on there uh when you get online and and you look at other countries uh how they have their traffic and their signals it is absolute chaos I mean

over there it's just it's just absolute crazy and see there there's no absolute over there there's no absolute to say well you have to stop and this one has to go there's no absolute to to make the decisions amen and it's the same in the church world today it's gotten to such a jam the the red light must be out somewhere and if the Catholic is right then the Protestant is wrong if the Methodist is right then the Baptist is wrong if the Pentecost is right then the rest of them is wrong and it's created a bunch of chaos amen the next thing you know the pope has become their absolute the bishop

well it's okay to wear your high heels well well it's okay to wear your minis skirts or your boys to wear your shorts as long as it's at home see and they're teaching this in the church and and it's causing a confusion among the people because they've thrown the absolute out the door and you've got one saying yeah well this is the way now well well well we was taught before that it wasn't well it is now and next thing you know there goes the absolute you've got chaos over here you got chaos in this house Chaos on that job site chaos in this place or that place because they kick the absolute

my and it's caused a traffic jam it's confusing the young people amen if the word says so if the word says for men not to put on the shorts or wear anything that don't pertain uh don't wear anything that pertaineth to a woman well that's the final word don't do it that's the final word amen if the if the word says you know for women not to cut their hair it don't mean you can trim your hair it's the same thing amen the words is against it the last woman that was that wore makeup in the Bible was fed to dogs amen that's just what the word says and we must stay with the word stay with the word that's right amen we've got churches today taking the pillar of the fire out of their own out of their churches out of their homes telling our young people that if you can't find what brother Brer says in the Bible then then those were just his opinions they're kicking the absolute out the window my this message didn't come to put us into confusion it come to take us out of confusion oh my this this message came to get rid of all the confusion it came h to get us ready for a Rapture oh my this messages are absolute and let me say this brother BR if brother brandham says it then I believe it amen I may not understand it but Jesus didn't ask his disciples if they understood it he asked if they believed it my Jesus says Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it that's the absolute that's the absolute tonight Lord amen and whoever show out or or take uh uh one word to it or take one word from it same will be taken his part out of the book of life we have to get back to the absolute amen Christ and this message is the same you can't separate it and if you and if you made Christ your absolute then you've made this message as your absolute amen God sent us a message to A Perfect Bride he sent a a perfect message to A Perfect Bride to get us ready to a perfect home oh my quit looking for something else quit looking there's nothing else coming oh my this is it Joyce Meyers didn't do anything for my home H TD Jake didn't do anything for my home focus on the family didn't do anything for my home I've seen this message bring marriage back together I've seen it I've seen this message uh men the broken homes I've seen this message bring home the prodical child no psych no psychology could do a psychologist oh they might help your mentalness they might help you just to help the people get through their hard times when people want to take to the bottle they take to a psychologist my this message is our anchor amen it's our Tian post when life becomes hard and and when life becomes Topsy Turvy and all El seems to fail give me the word I'll take the word every time oh my it's withstood the test of time that's my absolute it's withstood every age every age there was trials after trial testings after testing and yet each one could stand strong each one could press the battle and now it's coming now it's entered into this age this word is now made flesh in this day oh man now we can have a hope oh we can we can lift our heads High we we Christians can be the happiest people on Earth why because we have a word that can't fail oh my amen amen there's been times that that the pressure around me has just become great and I thought that I couldn't bear it anymore many times I've wanted to end it all growing up as a teenager the teenager life it can be hard sometimes and sometimes you people just don't understand you it feels like as a teenager and and just the pressure of life just just just just trying to weigh you down a many of times many of times sad to say many of times I wanted to end it all but there was something that kept holding me when I wanted to let go there was something holding me I wasn't doing it it was helping me Faithfully to overcome my trials to overcome The Temptations that's what the word does Amen overcoming fear and anxiety that's what the absolute does Amen just like a tree that's been planted by the water there has to there has to come a wind there has to come a little shaking so its roots can dig itself deeper and deeper into the ground can you imagine that if there was nothing to move that tree if there was no trial if there wasn't anything to move that tree back and forth its roots would stay on the ground there wouldn't be nothing that would shake it that would loosen the dirt for him to grab deeper in there and if there was no wind if there was nothing there it would end up shriving up and dying oh my but when that wind comes and when the pressure of life seems to wear down on that tree and and as that tree is swaying back and forth that Tree finds that that this shaking this this trial allows it to move so it's deeper so it's Bru can just dig deeper and deeper into its absolute it can dig deeper and deeper into the ground where where one day when the wind comes it won't move at all when the when the trials seem to come it oh yeah it'll be a little tosy and it'll be a little tury but but the the but it's strong it's build it's absolute I mean you you can you can you can take a strong oak tree or or whatever out there and and you can you can get hundreds of feet away and you begin to dig in the ground and as you further you go you end up hitting a rot you may be in a field and you're like where in the world I'm I'm far away from that tree and yet I've hit a route it's because because over the years over the time the testing and the trials as it come it was able to it was able to build its Firm Foundation it was it would begin to to be to build itself on a steady ground oh my and it's the same with every believer tonight yes when the Winds of Life seem to BU us down and we don't know which way is up and we're just swaying back and forth in our trials and and it seems that God has forsaken us remember there is H there the trials are there ah to help us dig our faith further in our absolute and them trials that come begins to shake us not only that not not so we could give up hope not because not because oh yeah we may feel weak at the moment but as you would find out as you would be shaken by this and as that you would find that if you would just take your faith and you would just wrap it around the word of God you will find that you would become steady that you would become strong oh my amen 1 Peter 4:12 says beloved think it not strange the the concerning the fiery Childs which is try to uh which is to try you James 1:2 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience why because the trials create a character in US brother BR says and that's why the holy spir and that's what the holy spirit is trying to find today is character you can't have character until you've got faith and Faith produces a character and the only thing that's going to help us build our faith are the trials oh my and and watching us overcome as we're overcoming and as we're overcoming and as we're we're placing our faith in this word we find that our faith become our faith in the absolute becomes stronger amen amen he may allow sickness to to come just to see what where you're going to put your faith amen he allows the sickness and comes of the diseases to come to see if your faith is in the doctor or if it's in his word amen he'll allow Satan to attack your finances oh my he'll allow it to happen to see if your faith is in him or if your faith is in your job or your Banker Oh Come on he's going to put us to the test amen he'll allow this to come he'll allow that to come just so we can H anchor ourselves into our absolute amen James 1:2 says blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him Amen brother BR says he that endureth there it is hold on take God out of his word believe every word of it no matter what anything else says or does believe it anyhow no matter what the circumstance looks like believe God anyhow amen Romans 4: 19 says be not weak in faith or being not weak in faith speaking of Abraham he considered not his own body now dead and when he was about hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded he was fully persuaded that he was able to perform amen fully persuaded I I like that word amen amen yes brother Terry I accept amen he was fully persuaded amen he could he could have looked at the circumstances he was old amen sah was old he had plenty of time to to complain about it he could have he could have H had so many excuses uh uh that he could have used yet he knew who his absolute was amen he was strong in faith amen as each day passed maybe Sarah would say well what are you working on today Abraham well I'm working on that baby crib you know and well a couple days later what you working on today Abraham well I've just finished some toys what about you Sarah you finished the baby Clos yet see they were just strong in faith every day every day just growing stronger and stronger not wavering to the left not wavering to the to the right but every day The Roots Began to just wrap around the word of God and their faith would grow with it amen they staggered not at the promises of God they had an absolute amen what about the three Hebrew children they they wouldn't bow down to an idol they wouldn't bow down to man's ideas and Creeds and denomination they wouldn't bow down to worldly Fashions they wouldn't bow down to the things of the world they knew who uh they would have th uh they knew they would be thrown into a fiery furnace but the Hebrew children believed God so they made it seven times hotter than the furnace had ever been they said our God is able to Deliver Us from this furnace

bought Sanctified son and daughter of God tonight oh you may be going through your worst trial yet you may be going through the fiery furnace right now but keep your absolute on the word amen oh if he

do everything he can to meet your need oh my put your faith in the absolute tonight amen if the musicians will come put your Fai in brother Brenham says let's go back to an old story that's familiar to us all in the days when sin had heaped into the world till God got sick and tired of it and the world was going to be destroyed and God gave no one an absolute that was his word and no matter matter that absolute was of the saving of the people the absolute was of the saving of the people Noah knew that the world was going to die and God gave him the absolute and that was his word now to save his people from Death now what was the absolute to save the people from uh uh death in Noah's time what what was the absolute in Noah's time to save the people from Death it was the word of God Amen that was the absolute no matter what anybody else said science said there was no rain up there we can shoot a moon with uh shoot the moon with our instruments there's no rain there how how is rain going to come down if God said that there would be rainfall God can put rain in the skies if he said so no one went right about his business he relaxed and prepared an ark for saving of the people for there was an absolute given to the people that they would be saved if they took God's provided way for this absolute my my I when I read that I oh my I just I had a just a shout and fit Within Myself That Noah could relax 120 years I mean wow 120 years everyone coming up to him says it's not going to rain Noah every day he had to hear the negative every day he had to hear what them people were complaining about oh science said this and science said that the the psychologist said this and said that and theologian said this and said that but he had his anchor in the word of God Amen he he seen God work before he seen God do it many a times and now he knew he could place his absolute on the word of God Amen I I I just excited by Brother Shmi and sister Bethany's testimony
