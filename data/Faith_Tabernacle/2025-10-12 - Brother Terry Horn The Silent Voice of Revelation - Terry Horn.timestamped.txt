[12:49] had a good week in the Lord? Things
[12:52] sometimes don't go our way, but they
[12:53] always go God's way. So, it's good to
[12:56] get on board with him. What do you say,
[12:58] brother Will? God bless you this
[13:00] morning, all of you that are gathered
[13:02] here this morning. Amen. And let's sing
[13:05] a song here of uh reach out and touch
[13:09] the Lord as he goes by. Amen. I trust
[13:13] that you've been reaching out to him. I
[13:15] have every every day this week, I have
[13:17] reached out to him and he's reached out
[13:19] to me. You know, there's one thing about
[13:21] it. God's always reaching out. We're the
[13:24] ones that kind of hold back. This
[13:27] morning, let's reach out to him.
[13:30] Reach out and touch the Lord
[13:35] as he
[13:38] goes by.
[13:41] You'll find
[13:43] he's not too busy
[13:46] to hear your heart's cry.
[13:52] He's passing
[13:54] by this moment.
[13:57] Your needs
[14:00] to supply.
[14:03] Reach out
[14:05] and touch the Lord
[14:08] as he
[14:11] goes by.
[14:13] I'm reaching out to touch the Lord
[14:20] as he
[14:22] goes by.
[14:25] You'll find he's never too busy
[14:31] to hear your heart's cry
[14:36] his pass and by this moment
[14:42] your needs
[14:44] to supply.
[14:47] Reach out

[14:53] as he
[14:56] goes. Let's lift up those tired hands.
[14:58] Reach out and touch the Lord

[15:10] You'll find
[15:12] he's not too busy

[15:21] Well, he's passing by
[15:24] this moment.
[15:27] Your need
[15:29] to supply.
[15:32] reach out
[15:35] and touch the Lord
[15:38] as he
[15:41] goes by.
[15:43] [Music]
[15:45] Amen. I'm going to go ahead and we're
[15:47] going to take the prayer request before
[15:49] the Lord. Let's remember, you know,
[15:54] sometimes people in our church are
[15:55] overlooked
[15:57] and they have a routine responsibility,
[15:59] a very important responsibility.
[16:02] And that is Sister Kim Broomfield. I
[16:04] know she's put there's a request here
[16:06] for her and she's got a special request,
[16:08] but let's remember her. She has
[16:11] faithfully for many years taking the
[16:14] Sunday school class for the children
[16:17] downstairs. And this morning while we
[16:19] were all meeting down there, I could
[16:22] hear some of the children. You know
[16:23] what? That was music to my ears.
[16:28] You know, I'm so glad that we've got
[16:30] young people, children, and families and
[16:34] so forth like that. And we've got
[16:36] somebody that's so dedicated like she is
[16:38] for many, many years taking that Sunday
[16:42] school class. So, let's especially
[16:45] remember her. God will just anoint her,
[16:49] bless her, and just give her everything
[16:53] that she attempts to do and lead our
[16:56] children in the direction they should
[16:58] go. Amen. That's a very important part
[17:02] of our church. So, let's remember her.
[17:05] And then there's others, you know, that
[17:07] we take for granted. Our brother uh
[17:09] Josiah here and brother Tim and others
[17:12] standing out here direct traffic in.
[17:15] That's a big responsibility. It's a
[17:18] dangerous intersection out here and we
[17:21] appreciate them. Too many times we did
[17:23] you ever thank them when you you know
[17:25] they waved you in you come in. Did have
[17:28] you ever thanked them for directing you
[17:30] in and standing out there in the weather
[17:32] sometimes and
[17:35] we we appreciate everybody. This is a
[17:38] body. If there's, you know, if in your
[17:40] physical body, if one part of your body
[17:43] is not getting right blood flow or you
[17:45] got a pinched nerve, you know about it,
[17:47] don't you? If it's in your little toe or
[17:50] if it's in your ear or wherever, you
[17:54] know about it. The whole body feels it.
[17:57] And if we're connected and we're
[17:59] compacted together, then we should be
[18:01] feeling these things and saying, "Woe
[18:03] unto us." We ever get numb
[18:07] where we don't feel the rest of the
[18:09] body's pain and woe unto us. So, let's
[18:13] be connected with one another. Um, also
[18:18] uh have uh let's remember brother Terry
[18:20] this morning, brother Shawn take care of
[18:24] these local folks first before I mention
[18:26] others. Uh also there was a uh mother
[18:31] Menanite mother and father whose child
[18:34] we had prayed for the doctors had kind
[18:37] of given a grim prognosis.
[18:40] a Menanite couple, I understand. And
[18:43] unfortunately, God saw fit to take their
[18:46] little baby. So, they're having the
[18:48] funeral today, the mother and daddy. And
[18:52] un just the way things go sometimes in
[18:55] life, but she's got a double whammy. She
[18:58] lost her father, the mother did. Uh so,
[19:02] let's let's remember her. And that was
[19:04] just recently, too. So, let's remember
[19:07] that family and those relatives. And you
[19:09] know, hey, that's what it's all about.
[19:11] And that's a co-orker of somebody here
[19:14] at the church, Sister Faith or Sister
[19:16] Ann, I'm not sure who, but anyway, let's
[19:19] remember them in prayer. Also, one of
[19:23] our local folks here, Brother Bob.
[19:26] He wasn't feeling well today. So, we
[19:30] want to remember him. I'm going to ask
[19:32] brother Josiah here in a minute if he
[19:34] don't mind to come and pray over these
[19:36] requests. Um, also let's remember, I did
[19:40] mention brother Terry this morning as he
[19:43] comes to minister. Now, um,
[19:48] let's see. Let's also remember brother
[19:50] Shawn. They're traveling and then we
[19:54] have brother Kevin and Sister Ray Lee. I
[19:56] understand they're out at uh the tent
[19:59] meetings out west somewhere. So, let's
[20:01] remember them as they'll be traveling.
[20:04] And then outside of our assembly,
[20:07] uh, I got a prayer request early this
[20:10] morning. There's a brother in
[20:12] Pennsylvania that I've come to know. His
[20:14] wife was taken the emergency room.
[20:17] Sister Irene Leart,
[20:19] uh, she had a blood clot. So, I haven't
[20:22] heard any updates on that. And then also
[20:25] in in the local area here, a brother
[20:28] that we all know, Brother Steve Alvis,
[20:31] some of you may know and some of you may
[20:32] not know, but he had a bad fall
[20:35] uh here a few weeks ago and it really
[20:38] messed up his lower arm. Uh broke some
[20:42] bones in it, required a plate, screws.
[20:45] Uh this week has been really trying for
[20:48] him. you know, he's had to keep that
[20:50] thing dry. Don't mess with it and watch
[20:52] what he does, you know, uh, and, uh,
[20:56] he's got to watch out for infection. Um,
[20:59] he's had to hold hold his arm up in the
[21:01] air. So, and he's going to work, so he's
[21:04] been a real trooper, but he had to have
[21:06] his understand sister Elizabeth had to
[21:08] drive him to work cuz he he couldn't do
[21:11] it, of course. So, let's remember him
[21:13] that God will give him a speedy
[21:15] recovery.
[21:17] And then we have uh Sister Pamela. Uh
[21:20] she uh texted me the other night and was
[21:24] requesting prayer, something going on in
[21:27] her body.
[21:29] Um, also I want to remember
[21:33] um
[21:36] my brother tried to reach me this
[21:38] morning and I'm not sure little unusual
[21:41] cuz he knows I go to church but my
[21:43] oldest brother Larry and uh if you would
[21:47] remember him in prayer too. Amen. So
[21:50] it's it's quite a list of prayer
[21:52] requests here. We've mentioned them by
[21:54] name and I'm going to ask brother Josiah
[21:57] if he would just take us to the Lord in
[21:59] prayer. Let's just stand at this time if
[22:01] you would.
[22:04] And if you would just go ahead and ask
[22:06] God's blessing over the offering too
[22:08] while you're here.
[22:10] My gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[22:11] we love you and Lord how we thank you
[22:14] father for all the many wonderful things
[22:16] you've given us Lord.
[22:18] Father God, we thank you for your
[22:20] presence here this morning, Lord. And we
[22:22] thank you, Father, for the never- ending
[22:24] promise, Lord, that what whatsoever we
[22:26] have need of, Lord, you're here to
[22:27] fulfill it. Lord, you see these prayer
[22:29] requests we have now, Father, we ask
[22:32] you, Lord, just to come down and touch
[22:33] them, each and every one this morning,
[22:35] Lord, we ask you, Lord Jesus, just to
[22:38] just to move on their behalf, Father.
[22:41] Lord, we ask you, Father, just just to
[22:44] bless the minister, Lord, as he comes to
[22:46] to bring forth the word. Father, we ask
[22:48] you, Lord, just to give him a real
[22:50] special anointing
[22:52] anointing this morning, Lord. Ask you
[22:54] bless the tithes and the offerings and
[22:55] the giver and receive both. We pray in
[22:57] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brothers. How many
[23:01] appreciates, Brother Josiah?
[23:04] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[23:07] Amen. and thank God for what the Lord's
[23:08] done in his life and in all of your
[23:10] lives. Brother John, good to have him
[23:13] with us and going to Virginia Tech. I
[23:16] know he would coveret your prayers and
[23:17] your interests in his life. Good to see
[23:21] all of our folks with us this morning. I
[23:23] was thinking Sister Kimberly was here,
[23:25] but let's go ahead and going to ask the
[23:27] ushers if they would come at this time
[23:29] and we'll receive our morning tithes and
[23:31] offerings. Amen. And let's sing a song
[23:34] here as they do that. Amen. Um,
[23:41] oh, I want to see him as I journey
[23:43] through this land.
[23:45] Amen. You can go ahead and receive the
[23:47] offering.
[23:49] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[23:54] face
[23:56] there to sing forever
[23:59] of his saving grace.
[24:02] On the streets of gloryy.
[24:05] Let me lift my voice.
[24:09] Cares all pass. Home at last. Ever to
[24:13] rejoice
[24:15] as I journey through this land. Singing
[24:19] as I go.
[24:22] pointing souls to Calary,
[24:25] to the crimson flow.
[24:28] Many arrows pierce my soul from without.
[24:35] But my Lord leads me on. Through him I
[24:39] must wait.
[24:43] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[24:48] face.
[24:50] dare to sing forever

[25:17] the night. Yes, it might be. But I'll
[25:20] cling more close to him. He will keep
[25:24] and he has.
[25:26] Satan stares me vex my soul. Turn my
[25:30] thoughts aside.
[25:33] But my Lord goes ahead, leads whatever
[25:37] be.
[25:40] [Music]
[25:41] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his

[26:02] Cares all pass. Oh my at last. Ever to
[26:07] rejoice.
[26:11] And in the valley slow I looked toward
[26:14] that mountain high.
[26:18] And behold my savior there leading in
[26:22] the flight.
[26:24] With a tender hand outstretched toward
[26:28] that valley low
[26:31] guiding me I can see as I onward go.
[26:40] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[26:45] face.

[26:57] Let me lift my voice.
[27:01] Cares are passed. Home at last. Ever to
[27:06] rejoice.
[27:10] When before me billows rise from the
[27:14] mighty deep,
[27:18] Lord directs my bar. He does safely keep
[27:24] and he leads me gently on through this
[27:28] world below.
[27:31] He's a real friend to me. Oh, I love him
[27:36] so.
[27:40] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[27:45] face.

[28:11] offering. Hallelujah.
[28:13] Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord this
[28:15] morning?
[28:17] Do you love one another?
[28:19] &gt;&gt; All right, turn around. Start shaking
[28:21] hands with people and tell them you love
[28:22] them.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; Love you all.
[28:33] Yeah. It's like, "Do you love your
[28:36] enemy?" All right, turn around and say,
[28:37] "No, we're brothers and sisters this
[28:39] morning." Now, hopefully we're not
[28:41] enemies. If we do, we got to make it
[28:42] right. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, you're
[28:46] coming up here. All right. Lord have
[28:48] mercy. Oh my. Well, church, the house of
[28:54] God's a place of reconciliations.
[28:57] Amen.

[29:01] can be seated now if you would. Amen. Um
[29:05] what a fellowship. What a joy divine
[29:08] leaning on the everlasting horns.
[29:12] Old song but never never loses its
[29:15] meaning. You know, there's a lot of them
[29:16] old songs that sometimes we don't sing
[29:19] them as much anymore. We don't sing them
[29:21] at all. But I, you know, I I remember
[29:23] songs that when I was out in
[29:25] denominations, I mean, everything I
[29:26] heard wasn't all bad. Don't get me wrong
[29:29] on that. And I'm not looking backwards.
[29:31] But I mean, I thank God for that because
[29:34] I remember that song they sang at the
[29:36] camp meetings, whiter than snow,
[29:39] whiter than snow. Lord Jesus, I long to
[29:42] be whiter than snow. And that stuck with
[29:45] me for years and years. And I have not
[29:47] heard that probably 40, 50, 50ome years
[29:51] or more. But you know, these old songs,
[29:53] they just don't lose their meaning.
[29:56] Amen. They're they're good for today.
[29:58] They still apply. Let's sing that song
[30:00] this morning. What a fellowship. What a
[30:05] fellowship.
[30:07] What a joy divine leaning on the
[30:12] everlasting
[30:14] arm.
[30:16] of blessedness.
[30:18] What a peace is my leaning on the
[30:24] everlasting
[30:26] arms.
[30:29] I'm bleeding
[30:32] leaning
[30:35] safe and secure from all along.
[30:41] Leaning,
[30:44] leaning,
[30:47] leaning
[30:49] on the everlasting
[30:52] arms.
[30:55] Oh, how sweet to walk in his pilgrim
[31:00] waying
[31:03] on the everlasting
[31:06] arms.
[31:08] Oh, how bright the path goes from day to
[31:13] day. feeding
[31:15] on the everlasting
[31:18] arm.
[31:21] Ling,
[31:25] leaning,
[31:28] safe and secure from
[31:31] [Music]
[31:34] leaning,
[31:37] leaning.
[31:40] I'm leaning
[31:42] on the everlasting
[31:45] arms.
[31:48] What have I to tread? What have I to
[31:54] fear? Feeding
[31:56] on the everlasting
[31:59] arms.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] And blessed peace with my Lord so
[32:06] nearing
[32:09] on the everlasting
[32:12] arm.
[32:15] Leading
[32:22] safe and secure from all alarm.
[32:28] Leading
[32:31] feeding,
[32:34] leaning on the everlasting
[32:39] arms.
[32:42] Praise the Lord. Are you leaning on his
[32:44] arms? Amen. It's a friend that sticketh
[32:46] closer than her brother. Sister Hope,
[32:48] would you happen to have a song for us
[32:49] this morning?
[32:51] I'm going to ask after she sings sister
[32:54] horn Alice to come and prepare to sing
[32:56] for us.
[33:14] I was alone in my darkness.
[33:18] I could not find my way.
[33:22] Jesus shined his light on me and turn
[33:27] all my nights today.
[33:31] Save
[33:33] by grace.
[33:36] I've been saved by grace.
[33:40] My name is in the book of life and my
[33:45] sins are washed away.

[33:50] Saved
[33:52] by grace.
[33:55] I've been saved by grace.
[33:59] It's not what I deserve, but I'm saved
[34:04] by grace.
[34:09] When I reach thy city
[34:13] and those gates swing open wide,
[34:17] I'm going to sing redemption story
[34:22] of how he brought me to the other side.
[34:27] I'm saved
[34:29] by grace.
[34:32] I've been saved by grace.
[34:36] My name is in the book of life and my
[34:41] sins are washed away.
[34:46] Saved
[34:48] by grace,
[34:50] Lord. I'm so saved by grace.
[34:55] It's not what I deserve, but I'm saved
[35:00] by grace.
[35:01] [Music]
[35:05] When we reach that city
[35:09] and those gates swing open wide,
[35:13] we're going to sing redemption story
[35:18] of how he brought us to the other side.
[35:23] Well, saved
[35:25] by grace.
[35:28] We've been saved by grace.
[35:32] Our name is in the book of life and our
[35:38] sins are washed away.
[35:42] Saved
[35:44] by grace.
[35:47] We've been saved by grace.
[35:51] It's not what we deserve.
[35:56] It's not what we deserve. But we're
[36:00] saved by grace. Peace.
[36:03] [Music]
[36:07] [Applause]
[36:43] I love Jesus. Yes, I do. He loves me. I
[36:50] know it's true.
[36:52] And one day I'll look upon his face. I
[36:58] know.
[37:02] But I'll wait until that day when my
[37:08] Lord calls me away.
[37:12] For it's just a little while and we'll
[37:17] be home.
[37:21] Almost home.
[37:25] We're almost home.
[37:30] [Music]
[37:31] All the time
[37:35] it's drawing near.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:40] And a heavenly light it shall come down.
[37:45] Change my body and I'll not be found.
[37:50] or it's just a little while and we'll be
[37:56] home.
[37:57] [Music]
[37:59] Sometimes it seems so hard to wait, but
[38:05] his promise won't be late, for he always
[38:12] keeps his word. This I know.
[38:19] So I'll just keep pressing on.
[38:24] I believe it won't be long for it's just
[38:31] a little while and we'll be home.
[38:36] [Music]
[38:39] Almost home.
[38:42] We're almost home.
[38:48] All the time
[38:52] it's drawing near
[38:57] and a heavenly light it shall come down.
[39:02] Change my body and I'll not be found for
[39:08] it's just a little while and we'll be
[39:13] home.
[39:16] Oh, a heavenly light, it shall come
[39:20] down. Change my body and I'll not be
[39:25] found. For it's just a little while and
[39:31] we'll be home.
[39:35] [Music]
[40:02] Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[40:03] Good be Christian. Thank you. Musicians
[40:05] love the Lord with all of our heart.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Thank God he sent us a prophet. Thank
[40:12] God we have a message. Message of
[40:14] deliverance.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Message to make us free. You shall know
[40:19] the truth and the truth shall make you
[40:21] free.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say set you free. You know,
[40:25] set free and make you free is almost
[40:27] like two different things. You know, you
[40:29] can I used to use a kind of example. Uh
[40:33] you can put cattle in a crowd and
[40:36] they're all crowded in. But if you open
[40:38] a gate, you have set them free. But if
[40:41] some way ma miraculously you can just
[40:44] lift the whole crowd fence above their
[40:46] head, you've made them free. They're
[40:48] made free. So you shall know the truth
[40:50] and the truth shall make you free. Amen.
[40:54] While you're turning, while you're
[40:55] standing and turning to the book of
[40:57] John, Romans, I'm sorry. We're going to
[41:00] read out of John a little later. Uh
[41:03] we're actually going to read one verse
[41:04] out of John. Romans chapter 10 verse
[41:06] 13-18. Then John 10:27.
[41:10] Well, we got a something a little bit
[41:12] different this morning. I trust it's
[41:13] going to be enjoyable. I have enjoyed
[41:16] studying it, thinking about it for a
[41:18] good long time while now. But um
[41:22] actually, I was thinking about some
[41:24] things. You know, there's something
[41:26] mystic about the heart and I wrote down
[41:29] some things here and I'm going to half
[41:31] of my sermon is going to be asking you
[41:33] people questions. So, I want you to
[41:34] thank class. You got to thank this
[41:36] morning. put on you spiritual spiritual
[41:39] thinking chaos this morning. Uh B, you
[41:42] know, I'm going to read you some phrases
[41:44] of of scripture just quickly as before
[41:47] we read our scripture. Out of the
[41:49] abundance of the heart, the mouth
[41:50] speaketh. Satan chose the heart. Satan
[41:54] chose the head. God chose the heart. As
[41:57] a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he.
[42:00] Brother Bram said, "Your heart is the
[42:02] control tower." Now remember Ra Rahab
[42:05] after 40 years you know we have heard
[42:07] all these things and our hearts did melt
[42:10] obviously you know where we're going
[42:11] with this with the heart and you think
[42:12] about there's something about the heart
[42:16] David was a man after God's own heart
[42:19] just scriptures God judges judges a man
[42:21] according to the desires of his heart
[42:24] your heart is controlled by one of two
[42:26] things faith or doubt
[42:29] Elijah was uh was to turn the heart of
[42:32] the children back to the fathers.
[42:35] The angel told brother Vanam, "It'll
[42:38] come to pass that you know the very
[42:39] secrets of their hearts."
[42:43] The prophet told David, "Do all that's
[42:45] in your heart."
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Your heart. Your heart.
[42:49] So I know we we we know this and but I
[42:53] want to rather really reinforce how
[42:55] important it is to believe what the
[42:58] prophet said. Nothing new, but and we
[43:00] know that how important it is. But just
[43:02] want to kind of reinforce that this
[43:04] morning. All right. We want to read in
[43:06] the book of Romans chapter 10 verse 13.
[43:14] Romans 10:13.
[43:21] It says, "For whosoever shall call upon
[43:24] the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[43:28] Then how shall they call on him who they
[43:30] have not believed? And how shall they
[43:33] believe in him who they have not heard?
[43:37] And how sh how shall they hear without a
[43:40] preacher? And how shall they preach
[43:42] except they be sent? Now these these
[43:44] questions Paul is getting to a point and
[43:48] a principle here. How shall they preach
[43:50] except they be sent? as it is written,
[43:52] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[43:54] preach the gospel and bring glad
[43:57] of good things. Excuse me.
[44:01] Verse 16, but they have not all obeyed
[44:03] the gospel. For Isaiah said, Lord, who
[44:06] hath relie believed our report? So then,
[44:09] faith cometh by hearing.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Say, faith come by hearing and hearing
[44:16] by the word of God. Now, keep that
[44:18] because we're going to expound on that.
[44:21] But I say, "Have they not heard?"
[44:23] Yes, they heard. The sound went out.
[44:26] Have they not heard? Yes, barely the
[44:27] sound went out into all the earth, and
[44:29] the words unto the ends of the world.
[44:31] But you know, they didn't believe. But
[44:32] they did hear, but they didn't believe.
[44:35] Wonder why they didn't believe. Now read
[44:37] also in John 10:27,
[44:40] one verse.
[44:42] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[44:45] and they follow me.
[44:48] Brother, well, the Bible says except a
[44:50] man be born again, he cannot see the
[44:53] kingdom. So, there's a certain there's a
[44:55] certain voice in seeing because see
[44:57] don't mean just to look. See means to
[44:59] understand.
[45:00] And brother man said, if you don't see
[45:02] Christ in every verse, he said, go back
[45:03] and read it again because you've missed
[45:05] something. So, there's some voice behind
[45:08] seeing and understanding.
[45:11] You know, I thought about even the we're
[45:13] going to let you pray in just pray and
[45:15] be seen just a minute. When the mama
[45:17] eagle screamed,
[45:19] she had a certain voice. Now, the the
[45:22] other chickens in the in the barnyard,
[45:23] they heard the same voice, but it didn't
[45:25] move them at all, but it moved that
[45:27] little eagle.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, it did.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; It was something different about that
[45:30] eagle's voice that the chickens couldn't
[45:32] pick up. They had no receiver to pick it
[45:34] up. I want to ask some other questions
[45:36] here. What caused all the apostles,
[45:39] except for John, to die a martyr's
[45:42] death? all the devotion that they had
[45:44] for the Lord Jesus. What caused all of
[45:46] them to give their life in cruel death
[45:48] as a martyr? What spoke to them? What
[45:52] changed them?
[45:53] &gt;&gt; What quickened them? What anchored them?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; What voice can change an entire nature
[45:59] of a human being?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Actually, I'm going to tell you what
[46:02] we're going to speak about. We're going
[46:03] about the silent voice of revelation.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; What voice can change the nature of a
[46:08] whole human being? In other words, sh
[46:10] change, if you want to say it this way,
[46:12] a hog to a lamb. What voice can do that?
[46:15] How can how can you change a person's
[46:17] nature, what you're born with?
[46:20] What voice can bring understanding to
[46:22] the secrets of the Bible? What voice can
[46:25] take away fear of all the jungles of
[46:27] Satan's paradise? What voice caused you
[46:30] to the truth? What voice?
[46:35] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we
[46:39] think about these scriptures that we've
[46:41] read, these little questions that I've
[46:43] asked. But there's a great great truth
[46:45] in here and a great understanding that
[46:47] we know much about it, Lord, and much we
[46:50] don't know because there's some what
[46:52] something mystic when we talk about the
[46:55] supernatural and the unseen and those
[46:57] things that are not related to see,
[46:59] taste, feel, smell, hear or the five
[47:01] senses on the spirit, Lord. But we know
[47:03] that the the heart is actually
[47:05] controlled by one thing, one of two
[47:08] things, faith or doubt. So I pray you'll
[47:10] help us get hide me behind the cross.
[47:12] Bless the the service, the congregation,
[47:14] all the words that are said. We ask Lord
[47:16] that you just take control in the name
[47:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[47:21] bless you as you're seated.
[47:24] Silent voice of Revelation. kind of a
[47:27] maybe a little interesting title but I
[47:30] think uh we'll all understand a little
[47:32] bit better as we go and I'm sure we
[47:33] already understand but just in some
[47:35] things that we want to cover now there
[47:37] was a man that uh came to brother Ram
[47:40] one time and he said now brother Ram I
[47:41] want to straighten you I'm going to read
[47:42] a lot of quotes so we all in the message
[47:44] we love quotes
[47:47] a man came to brother man said I want to
[47:49] straighten you out on the trinity he
[47:50] said if you got time he said I got time
[47:52] right now because I want to be straight
[47:54] we'll lay aside everything else So he
[47:56] come up, brother Ram, I want to teach
[47:58] you uh that you know and he come up and
[48:01] said, "Brother Ram, you teach that
[48:02] there's just one God." And I said, "Yes,
[48:04] sir." He said, "Well," he said, "I
[48:06] believe there's one God, but one God and
[48:07] three persons." And Brother Ben said,
[48:10] "Sir, repeat that again." And he said,
[48:12] "I believe there's one God and three
[48:14] persons." And he, Brother said, uh,
[48:16] "What school did you go at?" He told me
[48:18] the name of that Bible college. Brother
[48:19] said, "I can believe that."
[48:22] So you cannot be a person without
[48:24] personality. And if you're a
[48:25] personality, then you're one personality
[48:27] to yourself. You're a separate
[48:29] individual being. And he said, 'Well,
[48:31] this is what the other guy said. He
[48:32] said, 'Well, the theologians can't even
[48:34] explain that. And brother said, it's by
[48:36] revelation. And he said, I can't accept
[48:39] revelation. Of course, we know later
[48:41] that was a church cry preacher. And he
[48:43] said, "There's no way for God to ever
[48:45] get to you because it's hid from the
[48:46] eyes of the wise and prudent prudent and
[48:49] revealed to babes. Revealed revelation
[48:52] revealed to babes as will accept it,
[48:55] learn." And he said, "There's no way for
[48:57] God to get to you. You just close
[48:58] yourself off from him." The whole Bible,
[49:01] the whole Bible is a revelation of God.
[49:03] The whole church is built upon
[49:05] revelation of God. There's no other way
[49:07] to know God, only by revelation. to whom
[49:11] the son of God reveal himself.
[49:13] Revelation is revelation. Revelation is
[49:17] everything is revelation. So not to
[49:19] accept revelation then you just a cold
[49:22] theologian and there's no hope for you.
[49:23] So we know it's all by revelation.
[49:28] And brother B said in pass Patton's
[49:30] vision said you can only be the Bible
[49:33] can only be known by revelation and you
[49:35] can only be saved by revelation.
[49:38] For by grace are you saved through faith
[49:40] and that not of yourself. It's a gift of
[49:42] God and faith is a revelation. Faith is
[49:45] a revelation. Amen. Brother man said
[49:48] when you're born again, you've heard
[49:49] from your theophony. Now, what was your
[49:52] theophony speak? If you've heard from
[49:54] your theophony, what is that? Now, if
[49:56] I'm too loud, you turn me down. I don't
[49:58] want to be too loud. You turn me down
[50:00] before you can just barely hear me.
[50:05] Okay. All right. I don't like to be too
[50:07] loud anyway. Now, when the seals were
[50:09] open, you saw your name there. I want to
[50:11] ask you, when you saw those seals open,
[50:12] you saw your name. What voice spoke to
[50:14] you and said, "There's my name." Well,
[50:16] we didn't see John Doe or or William or
[50:19] Terry or Alice or Amos. We didn't see
[50:21] that. It didn't say William Brandon, but
[50:23] you identified with that. There's
[50:25] something there. You saw your name.
[50:27] There's something that spoke to you and
[50:29] said, "That's me."
[50:30] &gt;&gt; There's something when that little eagle
[50:32] heard that mother eagle's crink. That's
[50:34] me. That's the voice that I can
[50:36] identify.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though it was something
[50:38] audible, but it wasn't uh it was audible
[50:41] to the chickens, too.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; But it was different.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is kind of interesting. I
[50:48] know we probably all have heard that in
[50:50] 1933 when brother was baptizing on the
[50:52] Ohio River and that voice said, "As John
[50:54] the Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[50:56] coming, you'll have a message that will
[50:57] forrun the second coming." And brother
[51:00] Bam said, I think he told Billy Paul
[51:02] this something. He said, "And the hope
[51:03] was standing there and she heard that
[51:05] voice." said, "Bill, that's your voice.
[51:07] That was your voice."
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Was it me? That was your voice. Now,
[51:12] what? Why is that? And we'll get to that
[51:14] a little bit later. I don't have all the
[51:16] answers to this, but it's just something
[51:17] to think about.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Ma'am also said the bride
[51:21] will be the final voice to the final
[51:22] age. So, there's something about that
[51:24] voice that he wants us to get a
[51:27] revelation of.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; He He's And the Bible says, "I'll be
[51:32] with you, even in you." It's Christ in
[51:33] you. The hope of glory is actually your
[51:35] tabernacle and deity.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Now speaking about this silent voice of
[51:40] revelation, revelation is nothing new to
[51:42] the believers and we know that the whole
[51:44] church is built on revelation. But we
[51:46] want to look at some of these different
[51:47] aspects. If we ask you what really is
[51:50] revelation Jesus said my sheep hear my
[51:53] voice. So we we know his voice after
[51:57] 8033 his voice was silent but we are
[52:00] still still hearing his voice.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Even though his voice literal voice
[52:04] is not recorded on tape and we haven't
[52:06] heard that for 2,000 years but we are
[52:08] still hearing his voice. So who gives a
[52:11] revelation or who can only can you get
[52:14] only who gives only true revelation? Can
[52:17] you receive a false revelation? Uh can
[52:20] you receive a revelation based on
[52:22] somebody else's revelation?
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my lot of questions here. So let's
[52:26] start with a couple of quotes here.
[52:28] Brother Ram said, he said, "If a person
[52:30] ever has a revelation of God move on
[52:33] their heart," now he's talking about not
[52:34] just any revelation, but he's talking
[52:36] about redemption, you know, being a word
[52:38] birth, being born again. If you ever
[52:39] have a revelation of God move into your
[52:42] heart, it changes your whole motives.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; It changes your life. It changes your
[52:47] appetite from everything that from
[52:49] everything that you once was to what you
[52:52] are now. Everything has been changed.
[52:54] That's when you know you got something
[52:56] from God. That's the word birth. And
[52:58] first of all, we know it's not the flesh
[53:00] and we know it's not the spirit, but
[53:02] it's on the soul.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Not see, taste, feel, smell here. Not
[53:07] conscience, rages, memory,
[53:09] affectionation, imagination. Those those
[53:11] five on the spirit realm, but it's in
[53:13] the heart. That's where the word birth
[53:15] takes place. Not the flesh, not the
[53:17] spirit, in the soul. Now that's why
[53:20] Malachi 4 is to her turn the heart the
[53:23] heart the heart not the mind not the
[53:25] intellect but the heart back to the
[53:27] faith of the fathers but the heart is
[53:28] where you revelation your head is
[53:30] information your heart is revelation we
[53:33] get information in our head we get
[53:35] revelation in our heart
[53:36] &gt;&gt; amen
[53:36] &gt;&gt; so that's why it's something about the
[53:38] heart not this vessel not this pump in
[53:41] your body but that's the that's the if
[53:44] you want to call it the container of the
[53:45] soul somewhere that brother talks about
[53:47] that little spot in there they couldn't
[53:48] even find a blood cell but in your soul
[53:51] that's your heart. That's what he's
[53:53] talking about. Now when when when we
[53:57] talk about what voice is speaking let's
[53:58] say when two people of the same church
[54:01] and or even the same family and they
[54:03] receive a different revelation or a
[54:05] different understanding or no revelation
[54:07] at all but you're in the same place,
[54:10] same preacher hear the same words, one
[54:13] heard this, one heard that like the
[54:15] little eagle and the buzzard. He called
[54:17] me an eagle. He called me a buzzard.
[54:20] Why? What's the difference? What
[54:22] happened? Brother Ben says in this
[54:24] message, he says, "The Bible wasn't
[54:26] written then back in the days and of
[54:28] Cain." So Cain, his brother who sat
[54:32] under the Listen, this is really, really
[54:34] interesting this quote. So Cain, his
[54:36] brother who sat under the same teaching
[54:38] of father and mother. Now that's really
[54:41] important. Hea, we're assuming that Cain
[54:44] and Abel was taught the same thing from
[54:46] mom and dad. his brother who sat under
[54:48] the same teaching of father and mother
[54:50] came down and brought fruit to make an
[54:52] offering. But Abel by revelation he saw
[54:56] that it wasn't fruits that brought us
[54:58] out of the garden of Eden as some people
[55:00] still think it was but it wasn't fruits
[55:03] it was the blood of his father.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; So he came and offered the blood of a
[55:08] lamb by divine revelation. Listen what
[55:12] he says next. He said, "No one had to
[55:14] tell him anything about it, but he by
[55:17] faith, and this is really interesting
[55:19] what he says here, he by faith seen the
[55:21] son of God seen the son of God coming
[55:24] and offered a lamb and figurative type,
[55:28] seeing that Jesus was the lamb slain
[55:30] before the foundation world. And God
[55:32] testified that's the truth. God will
[55:35] always testify of the truth." Now, I ask
[55:37] you, what voice did Abel hear? What kind
[55:40] of a voice did Abel hear? Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Uh he he said under the same teaching as
[55:45] as Cain did.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Cain didn't hear that voice.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; So it must have been a silent voice.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said no one had to
[55:55] tell him anything. That's really
[55:57] interesting. Now let's look at the next
[55:58] quote. This next quote it deals with a
[56:00] person making deci make a decision based
[56:03] on somebody else's revelation.
[56:05] You might find this really interesting.
[56:09] Brother said, "Recently, I was some six,
[56:11] eight months ago, I was sitting home one
[56:13] day. I just fixed to go to Denver,
[56:14] Colorado to a convention, and this
[56:16] little fell," he's talking about,
[56:17] Brother Argright. "This little fell
[56:19] moved into the house." He said, "Brother
[56:21] Brandom, I have a great revelation from
[56:24] the Lord."
[56:26] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "The Lord's
[56:28] putting Zurich, Switzerland on my heart
[56:30] to go over there." And said, "Would you
[56:33] want to go with me?" And I said, 'Well,
[56:36] I got one night over here at Denver and
[56:38] then I got go to another meeting. I
[56:40] said, not to board it. Why? Then brother
[56:43] B said, the more I thought of it, why it
[56:46] seemed to me that if I knowed that
[56:49] brother Arurbrite had a revelation for
[56:51] something, it was good and it come from
[56:54] God.
[56:55] Wow.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Now, and then I'll come in a minute and
[57:00] then and we went to Switzerland and the
[57:02] Lord gave us 50,000 souls and went from
[57:05] there to Darua Germany and he gave us
[57:08] 50,000 more souls. That made about a
[57:11] 100,000 souls in that little campaign.
[57:14] How blessed we are. Now, I say this,
[57:16] that might be good if you're a word
[57:17] prophet, but I wouldn't want to trust
[57:20] another person revelation. Now I could
[57:22] the reason I say this is this.
[57:25] I would almost guarantee you that when
[57:27] brother Brandham said when brother
[57:29] Argent was saying I've got a revelation
[57:30] from God, brother Brandham I'm sure went
[57:33] and prayed about that before he went
[57:34] over there and God said go ahead on.
[57:36] Okay.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Now uh
[57:40] if you you know but I I believe I'd be
[57:44] real careful. Well listen what did
[57:45] brother when the when the seals was
[57:47] broke? What did brother say? And that
[57:48] angel came to him every day in that
[57:50] little room. He said, "The angel gave me
[57:52] the revelation of those each one of the
[57:54] seals." Then I spent the rest of the
[57:55] afternoon uh going in the Bible going
[57:58] back and checking out what the angel
[57:59] told me to make sure it lined up with
[58:00] the scripture. So it's always got to be
[58:03] the scripture based on the word of God.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; So faith cometh by hearing and that by
[58:09] the word of God. And faith is a
[58:10] revelation is something that's been
[58:12] revealed to you. And we talk about the
[58:14] silent voice of revelation. something
[58:16] that's been revealed to you. Now, I want
[58:19] to stop right here and I got I may have
[58:21] told this some years back when I was
[58:23] preaching, but I want to bring it in
[58:24] because there's a principle in here that
[58:26] I want to talk about.
[58:30] When I came into the message, and I'll
[58:32] try to make it real short. uh about 45
[58:35] years ago, there was a girl that worked
[58:38] and uh and her husband, we worked
[58:40] together at the post office and they
[58:42] gave uh she gave Alice a church age book
[58:44] because it's kind of she asked her uh
[58:46] did you really know what happened to
[58:48] Garden of Eden? He said, "Yeah, well, I
[58:50] I think I do." Said, "Well, I've got a
[58:51] book I want you to read and tells all
[58:53] about what happened." So, she read the
[58:55] book and of course, she couldn't put it
[58:56] down. And that's I mean, she just
[58:58] believed it automatically, the original
[58:59] sin. Read the church age book. And so
[59:02] for about four or five, six months, uh,
[59:03] I wouldn't listen to tapes. She was
[59:05] starting to listen to tapes and I I I
[59:07] just, you know, I was deacon in
[59:09] Pentecostal Holiness Church and I
[59:11] thought, well, you know, this is this is
[59:12] okay. I I can see the worldliness
[59:14] creeping in, but whatever. So finally
[59:16] after about four or five months and I
[59:18] said, well, you know what? I'm going to
[59:20] listen to a tape. I'm gonna sit down
[59:21] with her and listen to a tape and I'll
[59:23] listen to what Brother Ram had to say
[59:25] and I'll see where he's wrong and I'll
[59:26] prove he's wrong and, you know,
[59:27] everything will be okay, you know. So,
[59:30] uh, we um sit down one Sunday afternoon
[59:32] and listen to a tape and of all tapes
[59:34] that she got to me to listen to first.
[59:36] First tape I ever listened to was Life
[59:37] Story. So, I we sit down together and
[59:40] listen story. Nothing was ever said and
[59:42] and I weeped and cried and boohooed a
[59:44] little bit and she did too. You know how
[59:46] touching Life Story is. You know, Los
[59:48] Angeles 1959
[59:49] and uh 49 I think it is. 49. Anyway,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; 59. Yeah. Anyway, so you know, at we got
[59:57] down to the end, we turned the tape
[59:58] recorder off, nothing was said. We just
[1:00:00] waited maybe a minute and I made this
[1:00:03] statement. I wouldn't even listen to
[1:00:05] tapes before. And I I didn't say
[1:00:07] anything against the message, but you
[1:00:09] know, I just didn't want to really want
[1:00:10] to I was satisfied, I guess. But after I
[1:00:13] got down to the tape, end of the tape, I
[1:00:15] asked her one question. I said, "Have
[1:00:18] you got any more?"
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:00:21] And I can say this my hand my hand on
[1:00:24] the Bible before God from that very
[1:00:25] moment from that very minute. Now there
[1:00:28] there's there there is no doctrine in
[1:00:31] life story. There's nothing that you
[1:00:32] need to there's nothing life story about
[1:00:35] uh doctrine or straightening things out
[1:00:37] or whatever. It's all about his
[1:00:39] hardships in his life. But from that
[1:00:42] moment forward I never question one
[1:00:45] thing the prophet said from that day to
[1:00:47] this day. Now I want to ask you what on
[1:00:49] that Sunday afternoon what changed me? I
[1:00:52] mean totally changed me. I mean totally.
[1:00:55] There had to be something changed my way
[1:00:57] of thinking my focus. Was it was it just
[1:01:00] the Was it just the literal voice of
[1:01:03] William Brandom or was there maybe a
[1:01:04] voice behind that voice? I guess
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; we might want to look. Remember I was
[1:01:11] raised in church of Christ. They refuse
[1:01:13] I was raised in church of Christ. They
[1:01:14] refuse all revelation.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; I spent about 5 years in Pentecostal
[1:01:19] holiness church. They don't believe in
[1:01:21] predestination. They don't believe uh
[1:01:23] New Testament prophets. They don't
[1:01:24] believe Elijah had come. But that voice
[1:01:26] instantly changed my life just in life
[1:01:29] story. And I believe what the man had to
[1:01:32] say,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; right, brother?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Now, there's got to be a scriptural
[1:01:35] answer for what happened on that day.
[1:01:38] We're going to try to look at and I like
[1:01:40] I say I don't have all the answers but
[1:01:42] I'm a little bit more focused than I
[1:01:44] used to be. Uh what we're going to read
[1:01:46] in John 6:26 we'll read in just a minute
[1:01:49] is is it's really profound and it's very
[1:01:52] very simple but it's uh it's the very
[1:01:55] essence and focus on brother Ram's theme
[1:01:58] of only believe. All things are possible
[1:02:00] if you can only believe. And then I want
[1:02:02] to ask this question to you. Why did the
[1:02:05] angel tell brother in 1946 when he got
[1:02:07] his commission? He said if you can get
[1:02:09] the people to believe you,
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; he didn't just say only believe. He said
[1:02:14] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:02:15] be sincere you pray not nothing will
[1:02:17] stand your way not even cancer. So I got
[1:02:20] I began to thinking about that if you
[1:02:21] can get the people to believe you.
[1:02:25] So in looking all this up you know we
[1:02:28] know the purpose of the first and second
[1:02:29] pull was to get the people to believe to
[1:02:32] help their faith. All things are
[1:02:33] possible if you can only believe. But
[1:02:35] now in this scripture, John chapter 6,
[1:02:38] uh we'll start at verse 26 if you want
[1:02:41] to pull it up. John 6:26,
[1:02:43] starting there. Uh Christ is feeding the
[1:02:46] 5000 and Christ walks on water. And then
[1:02:48] he said there's a great multitude
[1:02:50] followed him because they saw the
[1:02:51] miracles which he did. And then he says
[1:02:53] in verse 26,
[1:02:56] he says John 6:26 said, "Verily, verily,
[1:02:58] I say unto you, you seek me not because
[1:03:00] you saw the miracles." They did see the
[1:03:02] miracles, but you don't see me because
[1:03:04] of the miracles, but because you did eat
[1:03:07] the loaves and were filled. Now, many
[1:03:10] followed him because of the miracles.
[1:03:11] Many fallen because they the they
[1:03:15] particularly the loaves and the fishes,
[1:03:16] you know, just carnal things. He said,
[1:03:19] uh, labor not for the meat which
[1:03:21] perisheth,
[1:03:23] but for the meat which is endureth ever
[1:03:25] everlasting life, which we know that of
[1:03:27] course is the word. It's the only thing
[1:03:28] that can endure. Labor not for the meat
[1:03:30] which perisheth, but for that meat which
[1:03:33] endureth unto everlasting life, which
[1:03:35] the Son of man shall give unto you, for
[1:03:38] him God the Father has sealed.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Then he said unto them, then they said
[1:03:44] unto him, this is so interesting. Okay,
[1:03:46] they wanted, they got a question, what
[1:03:48] can we do? It's like on the day of
[1:03:50] Pentecost, what can we do to be saved?
[1:03:51] They asked Jesus and they said to him,
[1:03:54] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:03:57] works of God? I mean, that's a that's a
[1:03:59] good question. What can we do that we
[1:04:01] can work the works of God?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Now, is his answer astounding or not?
[1:04:06] And here it is. Don't miss this. This is
[1:04:10] God in simplicity. Jesus answered and
[1:04:12] said unto them, "This is the work of
[1:04:14] God.
[1:04:16] That you believe on him who he hath
[1:04:20] sent."
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Believe on him who he hath sent.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Well, some people think,
[1:04:28] well, sure, you got to believe on the
[1:04:30] Lord Jesus Christ. But that's not all
[1:04:32] that God sent. Did God send John the
[1:04:36] Baptist? Did he require them to believe
[1:04:38] his message? Sure they did. Of course,
[1:04:41] we know God sent Christ. Hear ye him.
[1:04:44] Did God send brother Random? Did God
[1:04:46] send Malachi 4? The B, it plainly says,
[1:04:50] "Behold, I send unto you." Behold, I
[1:04:53] send unto you, Elijah the prophet. and
[1:04:56] he'll turn the heart of the children
[1:04:57] back to the father. Believe on whom I
[1:05:00] have said. That is so simple. God in
[1:05:03] simplicity, but it's so profound and is
[1:05:05] so much overlooked.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; True, brother.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, we believe we got to believe on the
[1:05:09] Lord Jesus Christ. But what about Paul,
[1:05:12] Arinius, Martin, Columbus, Luther,
[1:05:15] Wesley? But what about those messengers?
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody can't believe on them.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That is true. that Elijah,
[1:05:25] that prophet, he was sent that he might
[1:05:28] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:05:29] fathers. Faith of the fathers. Turn our
[1:05:31] hearts back to the faith of the fathers.
[1:05:33] Now,
[1:05:36] why was the major theme of this message
[1:05:38] only believe we can already see believe
[1:05:42] on whom he hath sent? Why did the angel
[1:05:45] at Greens Mill tell brother Ram if you
[1:05:46] can get the people to believe you? And
[1:05:49] so I just, as I said a minute ago,
[1:05:51] there's no doctrine in life story.
[1:05:52] There's no uh anything in life story
[1:05:54] that would question about doctrine in
[1:05:56] the Bible. But there's an answer there.
[1:05:59] There's got to be an answer there. We
[1:06:00] going to find out a little bit a little
[1:06:02] bit more. Then what voice did I hear on
[1:06:05] that Sunday afternoon? As I just said,
[1:06:06] the only voice I heard was William
[1:06:08] Brandon's voice. Perhaps maybe I heard
[1:06:11] another voice, a silent voice. Now,
[1:06:13] let's look at the scripture of Romans
[1:06:16] 10, our text
[1:06:18] a little bit and we'll kind of break it
[1:06:19] down a little bit. Now, I want you to
[1:06:21] know now and in that day we of course we
[1:06:24] all know the scripture is for many
[1:06:26] generations and and we're today there's
[1:06:28] a church on every corner and I would say
[1:06:30] probably everybody in America has heard
[1:06:32] of the name Jesus Christ, you know, and
[1:06:34] he's a savior and he's come to redeem
[1:06:35] the world and so forth like that. But
[1:06:38] now Paul's a different when Paul is is
[1:06:40] speaking these to the Romans. Paul is
[1:06:42] actually introducing the Lord Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ to to Gentiles and they're
[1:06:47] heathens and they they know nothing
[1:06:49] about salvation. They know nothing about
[1:06:51] Jesus Christ. They know nothing about I
[1:06:53] mean they didn't even know the law as
[1:06:55] far as the Jews had know. So they they
[1:06:58] were trying to bring them out of Judaism
[1:07:00] into grace. And they never heard about
[1:07:02] the grace of God. They never heard about
[1:07:04] Jesus. They didn't know anything about
[1:07:05] the Holy Ghost. They didn't know what to
[1:07:07] believe on, how to believe, where to
[1:07:09] believe or anything. They didn't know.
[1:07:10] So that's why Paul needs scripture, he's
[1:07:13] kind of given a a protocol of of what is
[1:07:16] the what is the interest to be able to
[1:07:19] believe.
[1:07:21] And because in Acts 19:5 he said, "Have
[1:07:23] you received the Holy Ghost? H you
[1:07:25] believe?" Said, "Well, we hadn't even
[1:07:26] heard whether there be any Holy Ghost."
[1:07:27] They never heard about any Holy Ghost.
[1:07:29] So you see, they were they were they
[1:07:31] were brand new in this. So they didn't
[1:07:33] they didn't know. They didn't
[1:07:34] understand. So let's look at this for a
[1:07:36] minute. So then faith cometh by hearing
[1:07:39] and hearing by the word of God. Now say
[1:07:42] in our text for whosoever shall for
[1:07:45] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:07:46] Lord verse 13
[1:07:49] shall be saved. So we have call
[1:07:52] name Lord saved. All these things are
[1:07:55] new to them. So then he's asking them
[1:07:58] how and he it says it four times. How
[1:08:00] how how then shall they call on him whom
[1:08:04] they have not believed? And how shall
[1:08:07] they believe on him that they have not
[1:08:10] heard?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And how shall they hear without a
[1:08:15] preacher? And then how shall they preach
[1:08:18] except they be sent?
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of question. That's valid
[1:08:22] questions for people that are brand new.
[1:08:23] They didn't know know anything of these
[1:08:25] things. So Paul is setting a protocol
[1:08:27] for faith cometh by hearing. Now to save
[1:08:30] time I'm going to give you and he said
[1:08:32] now how how how so I'm going to give you
[1:08:34] and we don't have time to go into it.
[1:08:36] This this is how that uh this protocol
[1:08:39] that Paul has given this is how that
[1:08:41] you'll know how to call upon the name of
[1:08:44] the Lord. Now first of all and you don't
[1:08:46] have to write these down but this is
[1:08:47] this is another sermon in itself but I
[1:08:50] just going to read you you it's got to
[1:08:52] be a proper messenger. It's got to be
[1:08:54] the proper message. The message must be
[1:08:56] preached and properly delivered. The
[1:08:58] message must be properly heard and
[1:09:00] considered. And the message they heard
[1:09:02] must be sincerely believed. And then the
[1:09:04] message you believe then you must act
[1:09:07] upon it. Then the result of acting upon
[1:09:09] the message is a new birth. So that's
[1:09:11] just that's the way that you hear how
[1:09:13] can you do these things. So we know
[1:09:15] that. So we and then brother man makes
[1:09:17] this interest interesting statement in
[1:09:20] birth pains and we're when you even
[1:09:22] think about a new birth pains birth
[1:09:25] pains you know he's talking about the
[1:09:26] the wars and so forth birth pain veins
[1:09:28] but really subliminally he's talk birth
[1:09:30] pains new birth new birth and he makes
[1:09:33] this statement he said we are promised a
[1:09:35] new birth according to Malachi 4.
[1:09:39] Wow, what an interesting statement.
[1:09:41] There's nothing in Malachi 4 about a new
[1:09:43] birth. That's just I'll send you Elijah
[1:09:45] the prophet. But he said, quote unquote,
[1:09:47] we are promised a new birth according to
[1:09:50] Malachi 4.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And I have thought about that for years
[1:09:55] and years and year and years and years
[1:09:57] and years. And you say, "Well, there's
[1:09:59] nothing in Malachi 4 about a new birth."
[1:10:01] Oh, yes there is. But it's a silent
[1:10:03] voice.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; It's a silent voice.
[1:10:06] Oh yes, there is a silent voice because
[1:10:08] it's to your heart. It's to your heart.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, a silent voice because it was a
[1:10:14] proper message, brother Bram. It was a
[1:10:16] proper messenger. It was properly
[1:10:18] delivered. It was properly considered
[1:10:20] and it was properly acted upon and which
[1:10:22] resulted in a new birth. Remember, he he
[1:10:25] Elijah shall turn the heart,
[1:10:28] not the head, the heart of the children
[1:10:31] back to the fathers.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Not the head. Why? Why why didn't why
[1:10:36] didn't brother M say we are promised a
[1:10:38] new birth according to Acts 238. Why
[1:10:40] didn't he say that? He noted Acts 238.
[1:10:42] He said we are promised a new birth
[1:10:43] according to Malachi 4. So there's
[1:10:46] something about that messenger him send
[1:10:49] God sent that messenger. There's
[1:10:50] something about that tied into a word
[1:10:52] birth. A real word birth. When the full
[1:10:55] word has come, when the seals are open,
[1:10:57] when the full word is coming to
[1:10:59] manifestation,
[1:11:01] there's something about that voice,
[1:11:03] brothers and sisters. Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; There's something about that voice I
[1:11:05] heard on that Sunday afternoon. I can't
[1:11:07] explain it all. There's something about
[1:11:08] hearing that voice.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You can you can be uh going through a a
[1:11:14] trial, having a hard day, get up in a
[1:11:16] bad mood, whatever, and turn on a tape.
[1:11:18] And what is that tape? Ju just turn on a
[1:11:20] tape. Something about that voice.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Can't tell me otherwise. I know it to be
[1:11:24] true. You know it to be true also.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; There's something comforting about that
[1:11:29] voice.
[1:11:30] But Paul goes on to say in Romans 10:16,
[1:11:33] but he said, "But part of our text, but
[1:11:36] they have not obeyed the gospel for is
[1:11:39] well not part of our text, but for
[1:11:40] Isaiah said, Lord, who hath believed our
[1:11:43] report?"
[1:11:44] That's an interesting word. Who hath
[1:11:46] believed our report? So then faith
[1:11:48] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:11:50] word of God. Who hath believed our
[1:11:52] report? Very interesting. Now let's look
[1:11:55] at this quote just a minute. Very
[1:11:57] striking. We talk about revelation. What
[1:11:59] is revelation? How where do you get
[1:12:00] revelation? If I could put it this this
[1:12:03] way, what means or what vehicle brings
[1:12:05] revelation to you?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; So when faith cometh by hearing, faith
[1:12:09] also comes by reading. What if you can't
[1:12:12] hear?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Ever think about that? What if you can't
[1:12:17] hear? What if you're deaf? There's no
[1:12:18] hope for you to be saved because faith
[1:12:20] cometh by hearing.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So whether hearing or reading, brother
[1:12:24] says in this message, revelation of
[1:12:25] Jesus Christ. Now the first three verses
[1:12:28] we uh we have here now lay in the
[1:12:30] background. First the revelation of
[1:12:32] Jesus Christ. Second it was given to
[1:12:33] John by an angel. And the third blessed
[1:12:35] the blessing to them that read. And if
[1:12:38] you can't read blessed him that hears.
[1:12:41] If you can't read just hear it. That's
[1:12:42] all. Blessed he that readeth. And if you
[1:12:44] can't read blessed he that hears for the
[1:12:47] time is at hand. Now imagine what the
[1:12:50] canon of this meaning of John the writer
[1:12:51] here in writing this out. This is John
[1:12:53] saying blessings and so forth. Now what
[1:12:56] I think it was in the Old Testament, the
[1:12:57] priest stood up in the morning and read
[1:12:59] the scriptures, the congregation
[1:13:00] listened. Many could not read. So he
[1:13:03] said, "Blessed is he that readeth and he
[1:13:05] that heareth." So whether or not you
[1:13:07] heed it, read it or hear it, you're
[1:13:10] blessed. So he's saying the same thing.
[1:13:12] Whether or not you read it or you hear
[1:13:14] it, you're still have access to that
[1:13:16] revelation.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; The reader and the hearer, the one who
[1:13:21] reads and hears is blessed. So if you
[1:13:23] just sit and listen at all, you're
[1:13:25] blessed. Bless he that readeth and he
[1:13:26] that hears. So we we've we've got that
[1:13:29] settled. Now watch this. Faith cometh by
[1:13:31] hearing. Now this is I want to go real
[1:13:34] slow on this quotation. Faith cometh by
[1:13:38] hearing and that by the word of God. You
[1:13:41] got on your spiritual bonnets.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem said and power of God. He
[1:13:47] said, "What is it? What is a revelation?
[1:13:51] What is faith? We know faith is a
[1:13:53] revelation
[1:13:54] is God by the spirit revealing you
[1:13:57] something that he is going to do or that
[1:13:59] he's promised. Okay, pretty simple.
[1:14:02] Reveal to you something he's going to do
[1:14:03] or something he's promised.
[1:14:06] Now, if you only hear
[1:14:09] faith cometh by hearing, but hearing is
[1:14:12] not faith.
[1:14:16] Read again. Now, if you if you only
[1:14:18] hear, in other words, you just hear it.
[1:14:19] Remember we read you the in the in in
[1:14:21] our part of our text. Yes, the words
[1:14:24] went out. They heard the words, but they
[1:14:26] really didn't hear.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; That's why in each one of the church
[1:14:28] ages said, "He that hath the ear to
[1:14:30] hear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:14:33] to the churches."
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith come by hearing, but hearing
[1:14:37] is not faith.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; So you got to you've got to be able to
[1:14:40] discern it. Hearing is not faith.
[1:14:41] Brother man says, "A loaf of bread is
[1:14:43] purchased for 25 cents." was back in the
[1:14:46] 60s. But 25 cents is not the loaf of
[1:14:49] bread. So here, hearing, hearing, here
[1:14:53] it is. Hearing only brings the word that
[1:14:56] produces faith. Faith cometh by hearing
[1:15:00] and that by the word of God. Hearing
[1:15:03] only brings the word or reading only
[1:15:05] brings the word which produces faith.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; But you've got to have that faith.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; You can only be saved by faith. And
[1:15:15] faith is revelation. You can only be
[1:15:17] saved by revelation. You can only
[1:15:18] believe by revelation. The whole church
[1:15:20] is built on divine revelation.
[1:15:23] But faith cometh by hearing that by the
[1:15:25] word of God. So hearing it is not
[1:15:27] hearing only brings the word which
[1:15:29] produces faith. But faith is a
[1:15:31] substance. Now here we go. Faith is a
[1:15:33] substance. Something actually you often
[1:15:35] moments can say is tangible. It's a real
[1:15:38] substance. Something that you can anchor
[1:15:39] to of things hoped for. the evidence of
[1:15:42] things that you don't see, taste, feel,
[1:15:43] smell, or hear.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; That's what faith is all about. But it
[1:15:47] is real. It's a substance. It's a real
[1:15:49] genuine substance.
[1:15:52] You You can ask any of those uh as we
[1:15:56] talked about any of the apostles,
[1:15:57] disciples, they all died as a martyr.
[1:16:00] You don't think they had faith or
[1:16:01] revelation? It was substance to them.
[1:16:02] They're willing to give their life for
[1:16:04] it.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; They know it was real. You could, you
[1:16:07] know, you couldn't talk them out of it.
[1:16:09] Even Peter being crucified upside down.
[1:16:12] Oh, beautiful. Amen. See then faith is
[1:16:15] the substant hope for evidence not thing
[1:16:18] seen. See then you see you hear the word
[1:16:22] God reveals it to you that it is the
[1:16:25] truth and by the spirit revealed truth
[1:16:29] confirms your faith to God.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Boy, I just I love that quote. Read that
[1:16:34] part again. Faith is the substance
[1:16:36] things of things hoped for the evidence
[1:16:38] of things not seen. Then you see you
[1:16:41] hear the word God reveals it to you
[1:16:43] that's the truth by the spirit is
[1:16:45] revealed.
[1:16:47] God reveals it to you that it is the
[1:16:49] truth and by the spirit revealed truth
[1:16:51] confirms your faith to God. Do you get
[1:16:54] it? And everybody says
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Now it's interesting if you read out of
[1:16:59] the infantic dialogue which it's
[1:17:01] actually just the it's not a
[1:17:02] translation. It's actually word by word
[1:17:04] what the original Greek was. It it reads
[1:17:06] this way. So faith come by the report
[1:17:08] and report through the word of God. Same
[1:17:10] thing but just using a different word
[1:17:12] but it's interesting how he uses the
[1:17:13] word. Faith comes from a report. So okay
[1:17:16] we know faith is a revelation. Therefore
[1:17:18] revelation comes by hearing or
[1:17:20] revelation comes from reading. But we
[1:17:22] know revelations comes from a report and
[1:17:24] all true revelations come from God. We
[1:17:26] establish that all true revelation comes
[1:17:28] from God. Now there's false revelation.
[1:17:31] Okay. Faith come by hearing but hearing
[1:17:34] is not faith. Revelation comes by
[1:17:36] hearing but hearing is not revelation.
[1:17:38] Hearing only brings the word that
[1:17:40] produces faith or revelation.
[1:17:43] Now you know there's a lot of negative
[1:17:45] information on the internet you know
[1:17:47] about the message so forth. But when
[1:17:48] people hear that or when you just happen
[1:17:51] to see something on there what voice are
[1:17:53] you actually hearing or seeing?
[1:17:57] You run across something negative on
[1:17:59] what what what there there's a
[1:18:00] subliminal voice under what you're
[1:18:02] hearing or reading. Negative or
[1:18:04] positive. That's right.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Actually, it's it's a silent voice
[1:18:06] trying to speak to you. It was Satan is
[1:18:08] what I say what it is, right? It's Satan
[1:18:10] right now. He's trying to say, you know,
[1:18:11] here's here's some of the air. Here's
[1:18:13] some things. Here's the part you don't
[1:18:14] really believe. You know, you believe
[1:18:16] this part, but here's the here's the
[1:18:18] backside of Israel, if you will.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Is there's a lot to this actually
[1:18:24] anointing or this silent voice, if you
[1:18:26] will. uh about these things. Remember
[1:18:28] it's a voice behind the voice. I want to
[1:18:31] look at an example here.
[1:18:34] We know that Satan can Satan can mimic
[1:18:36] or impersonate only anything God has or
[1:18:40] and he can pervert it. He can't create.
[1:18:42] So Satan copies everything God does in a
[1:18:44] perverted way. So faith revelations come
[1:18:47] by hearing and that by the word of God
[1:18:50] or hearing the truth. So then obviously
[1:18:52] Satan has a perverted way to look at
[1:18:54] that. So doubt cometh by hearing and
[1:18:57] that by reasoning. Fameth faith cometh
[1:19:00] by hearing and that by the word of God.
[1:19:01] Doubt cometh by hearing and that by
[1:19:04] reasoning.
[1:19:06] What did what did Eve do?
[1:19:09] She heard she God already gave her the
[1:19:11] truth. She already told her the truth.
[1:19:12] Then Satan come with his little
[1:19:15] subliminal voice said, "Surely now you
[1:19:17] know he's a loving God. You want to be
[1:19:18] able to know all things and be as uh no
[1:19:21] good from evil. Surely you won't die."
[1:19:23] What voice was that? What was that under
[1:19:27] that? She did. She She listened to that
[1:19:29] subliminal voice that she You know what?
[1:19:32] That sounds mighty good. You know, I
[1:19:34] mean, I was the man said she wanted some
[1:19:36] new light if she just stayed fortified
[1:19:38] behind the word. But she reasoned.
[1:19:41] That's the whole thing. She reasoned it.
[1:19:43] We're not supposed to reason nothing. We
[1:19:46] just believe it. That's why the whole
[1:19:48] thing is based on revelation. Faith is a
[1:19:51] revelation. Amen. You got to believe it.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can apply that from Eve all
[1:19:57] the way down to where we are today.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing the word, a true
[1:20:01] report. Faith comes by from a report, a
[1:20:04] true report. And I want to give I want
[1:20:07] to touch on a little bit on this uh
[1:20:10] Israel. And I have I preached on this
[1:20:12] before, but I want to bring it in
[1:20:13] because this is really striking here.
[1:20:15] How when the children of Israel left
[1:20:16] Egypt and they made it to Kadesh Barnea
[1:20:19] and then of course they sent the spies
[1:20:20] over and the Eve report. So, just take a
[1:20:23] few minutes. I'll try to be just as
[1:20:24] brief as I can on, but it's so it's so
[1:20:27] uh uh astounding what what happened when
[1:20:31] they came back with that evil report.
[1:20:34] And so, we pick it up right here in
[1:20:35] Numbers 13:30. And Caleb still the
[1:20:38] people before Moses and said, "Now, the
[1:20:40] the bottom line is they really didn't
[1:20:42] believe the prophet Moses somewhat, but
[1:20:44] they really didn't have a revelation
[1:20:47] that whatever that prophet said, he's
[1:20:49] going to take us through. He's going to
[1:20:50] take us through. He's going to take us
[1:20:51] through." They really didn't have that.
[1:20:53] And this proves it. And Caleb stealed
[1:20:55] the people before Moses and said, "Let
[1:20:57] us go up now. They've they've they've
[1:20:59] come all the way to Kadesh Barnea." They
[1:21:00] left Egypt, two years journey to Kadesh
[1:21:03] Barnea. Kadesh Barnea actually was a
[1:21:05] little oasis. They had some springs
[1:21:06] there. And God was going to give them a
[1:21:08] little rest before they entered into the
[1:21:09] promised land. It was only three about
[1:21:10] three days journey from Kades to go into
[1:21:12] the land of Canaan because you know the
[1:21:14] spies went there and spied for 40 days.
[1:21:16] So they were real close only three days
[1:21:18] journey. So they had come to Kades and
[1:21:21] Caleb still the people said let us go up
[1:21:23] at once and possess it for we're well
[1:21:25] able to overcome it.
[1:21:28] Remember Joshua and Caleb they saw the
[1:21:29] very same thing that the other 10 saw
[1:21:31] brought back the Eve report. So they've
[1:21:34] come back with the Eve report and said
[1:21:36] but the men that went up with now let me
[1:21:40] just slow down a minute. Joshua and
[1:21:42] Caleb they come back with a positive
[1:21:43] report said we're let's go take the
[1:21:44] land. We're well able to take it. Then
[1:21:48] the 10 the 10 spies that came back with
[1:21:50] negort, they got up and spoke to the
[1:21:52] people after Joshua and Caleb spoke. But
[1:21:55] the men that went up with him said, "We
[1:21:59] be not able to go up against the people,
[1:22:01] for they are stronger than we."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Remember, doubt cometh by hearing.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Doubt cometh by doubt cometh by
[1:22:09] reasoning. You can hear what they got to
[1:22:11] say, but doubt cometh by reasoning. the
[1:22:14] land to which we have gone to search it
[1:22:15] is the land that eatth up the
[1:22:17] inhabitants that now really that was
[1:22:19] somewhat of a lie. I mean it was halfway
[1:22:21] true because it it means it's too
[1:22:23] dangerous to conquer. Uh it's too strong
[1:22:26] and the people are too tall and they
[1:22:28] live in four to five cities and their
[1:22:30] their fear their their faith or lack of
[1:22:33] faith was based on human strength. But
[1:22:35] God never told them to go over there and
[1:22:37] take the land by human strength. He said
[1:22:39] I'll be with you. I'll fight your
[1:22:40] battles.
[1:22:42] That's why he told him, you know, you've
[1:22:44] got to listen to the prophet of God,
[1:22:45] what he told you. In other words, he's
[1:22:48] saying it's a death trap. It eats up the
[1:22:50] people. It's a death trap if you go over
[1:22:52] there. And he said, "The land eatth up
[1:22:54] the inhabitants thereof. And all the
[1:22:55] people we saw there are men of great
[1:22:57] stature." They did see the uh the the
[1:22:59] the
[1:23:01] um the achans and all these long necked
[1:23:04] and these giants and so forth, but that
[1:23:05] wasn't all the people they saw.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; It wasn't all the people saw. and some
[1:23:10] reading some of the history. I think
[1:23:11] Caleb while they was over there 40 days,
[1:23:13] he he
[1:23:15] I'd like to preach on Caleb sometime,
[1:23:17] but he I think he went up and he
[1:23:19] probably searched out Horeb because
[1:23:20] Mount Horeb because that's when he said,
[1:23:22] "Give me my mountain because that was
[1:23:23] three 3,000 feet above sea level and
[1:23:26] that was like a the the prize of the
[1:23:29] land over there and that's why Caleb and
[1:23:31] God gave him that land. Gave him that
[1:23:33] mountain."
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, baby. Okay.
[1:23:39] Oh, but and and then verse 33 says, "And
[1:23:43] there we saw giants, the sons of Anoch,
[1:23:46] which come of the giants, and we uh
[1:23:49] which come of the giants, and we were in
[1:23:51] their own sight as grasshoppers. And so
[1:23:53] we were so and so we were in their
[1:23:56] sight." Who told them that? Who told
[1:23:58] them that? They said, you know, we look
[1:24:01] at you, you know, just grasshoppers.
[1:24:02] We're giants. You're Who told them that?
[1:24:04] That was their reasoning. There is.
[1:24:07] Yeah.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; God God had already promised the land.
[1:24:10] Yes, he knew who was over there. God had
[1:24:12] already done the reconnaissance. He
[1:24:13] said, "I'm going to give you the land.
[1:24:14] It flows with milk and honey. You don't
[1:24:17] you don't need a spy mission. You don't
[1:24:18] need that."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It was actually the people that
[1:24:21] requested the spy mission.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So what validates the report? They gave
[1:24:28] Joshua and Caleb gave a positive report.
[1:24:32] The 10 spies gave a negative report.
[1:24:35] Joshua and Caleb had a voice. The 10
[1:24:37] spies had a voice.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Now the whole congregation, they heard
[1:24:41] all 12 of these voices.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; So Isaiah is saying as we read then he
[1:24:47] asked a question in verse one or we read
[1:24:50] that in Isaiah 53:1. Who hath believed
[1:24:52] our report?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And to whom of the arm of the Lord
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; and and to whom is the arm of the Lord?
[1:24:59] And what's that last verse? Last word
[1:25:01] revealed.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Who has believed who have believed
[1:25:05] our report? Who who that two and a half
[1:25:07] million people heard the report of the
[1:25:10] 10 spies and they believed that report
[1:25:12] by reasoning
[1:25:15] but the sound went out. Caleb Joshua and
[1:25:19] Caleb the sound went out. Why didn't
[1:25:20] they believe Joshua and Caleb?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Who hath believed our report and to whom
[1:25:25] is the arm of the Lord revealed?
[1:25:27] Revealed revelation. So what was the
[1:25:30] result of believing the Eve report?
[1:25:33] Here's the result. Think about just that
[1:25:36] one evening, that one day, that one
[1:25:38] return, that one giving out a report,
[1:25:41] reading the report or speaking the
[1:25:43] report. Here's the result of that
[1:25:44] report. And all the congregation lifted
[1:25:47] that voice and cried. And the people
[1:25:49] wept that night. So the evil report from
[1:25:52] 10 spies caused the whole congregation
[1:25:54] to believe a false revelation which
[1:25:57] actually ended up in death. Yes.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And God cannot give a false revelation.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; But they believed a false revelation
[1:26:07] because they believe what those 10 spies
[1:26:09] came back with a negative influence, a
[1:26:11] negative report.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; And all the children of Israel murmured
[1:26:15] against Moses, against Aaron. And the
[1:26:18] whole congregation said unto them,
[1:26:19] "Would God that we had died in the land
[1:26:22] of Egypt, or would God we had died in
[1:26:24] the wilderness? And wherefore hath God,
[1:26:27] listen, listen, listen to their speech.
[1:26:29] Wherefore hath God brought us into this
[1:26:31] land to fall by the sword that our wives
[1:26:34] and our children should be pray their
[1:26:36] children's don't want to made it
[1:26:37] through. Should be pray not better for
[1:26:39] us to return to Egypt. And they said one
[1:26:42] to another, "Let us make a captive and
[1:26:44] return back to Egypt." Can you believe
[1:26:47] Can you believe that?
[1:26:50] I mean they of listen the the 10 plagues
[1:26:53] that they saw leaving Egypt, the
[1:26:55] dividing of the Red Sea, the smiling of
[1:26:58] the firstborn, all the plagues, that was
[1:27:00] the that was the greatest display of
[1:27:02] miracles at any one time in the whole
[1:27:05] New Testament. at one at one time, at
[1:27:07] one seas, at one uh one happening, the
[1:27:10] greatest display of miracles and they
[1:27:12] saw all of that and oh then they when
[1:27:14] they went to the Red Sea and part of
[1:27:16] that and oh they rejoiced when all the
[1:27:18] uh the the Pharaoh's army was drowned
[1:27:20] and they were all killed and they're on
[1:27:21] the other side and we're safe and oh
[1:27:23] we're just a few days we're going to be
[1:27:24] in the promised land and everything's
[1:27:26] just going to be wonderful. God brought
[1:27:27] us through two years journey come to
[1:27:31] Kades Barnea and they said you know what
[1:27:35] we Joshua came said here's the land
[1:27:37] let's go take it and they said you know
[1:27:39] what uh maybe we better send out some
[1:27:41] spies and see which way we ought to go
[1:27:43] and what we ought to see and just just
[1:27:45] to make just to make sure
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; that's paraphrasing but that's basically
[1:27:49] what they were saying
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; this is this is one of the greatest
[1:27:53] paradoxes to me in the Bible
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; true
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; all that they saw for the coming out of
[1:27:58] Egypt and everything and then the people
[1:28:00] request listen the people requested the
[1:28:02] spy mission.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Now you go read the Bible it does it
[1:28:05] sounds like and God uh uh or
[1:28:10] orchestrated it and Moses orchestrated
[1:28:12] it. But here's what really happened. You
[1:28:14] go read Deuteronomy 126. I wonder if we
[1:28:17] can bring that up.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Can we bring up Deuteronomy 126? with
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:24] they requested the spy mission
[1:28:28] let's see let's say notwithstanding
[1:28:32] let's see verse 27
[1:28:39] maybe let's let's go go back to verse 24
[1:28:42] I don't have it my notes
[1:28:49] anyway it's I'm not sure what it is. But
[1:28:51] anyway, you can read it in the first
[1:28:53] chapter of Deuteronomy where it said,
[1:28:55] "We we we
[1:28:57] uh came to Moses and we we they
[1:28:59] requested that the spy mission and so
[1:29:01] forth." We'll find it in a minute. But
[1:29:04] you see the they they requested the spy
[1:29:06] mission and they asked Moses. It sounded
[1:29:09] good to Moses. Moses said, "Okay, I give
[1:29:11] you permission." Okay. Then Moses qu
[1:29:14] asked God about it and God said, "Okay,
[1:29:17] okay. If that's what they want, give it
[1:29:18] to them." It's just exactly what
[1:29:20] happened with Balam the second time and
[1:29:22] you know God his first decision was
[1:29:24] don't go don't go but he said no maybe
[1:29:26] I'll go back and ask God again you know
[1:29:27] and then the third time I'll ask God
[1:29:29] again and finally God said well go ahead
[1:29:30] on if you're going to be stubborn go
[1:29:31] ahead on
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; same thing say it's exactly the same
[1:29:35] thing that's why God permitted the spy
[1:29:38] mission but he but
[1:29:42] what a what a paradox
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; the whole the whole spy mission was the
[1:29:46] result of their unbelief They really
[1:29:48] didn't believe Moses' word. They really
[1:29:50] didn't believe it.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It led it made it led immediately
[1:29:54] to their complaining and rebellion and
[1:29:56] finally death. And even after right
[1:29:58] after this happened, the the 10 leaders,
[1:30:00] those 10 spies, which were the leaders,
[1:30:02] the princes of all the 10 tribes, they
[1:30:05] were struck with a plague and died.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Now, God would know why. Listen, when
[1:30:10] you think about why would God need to
[1:30:13] send out a spy mission and and say, "Now
[1:30:15] what? Now here's the land." He done told
[1:30:17] him what he he told them there's seven
[1:30:18] nations that that own the land. They've
[1:30:21] already uh uh cultivated the fields.
[1:30:23] They've built cities. You know, they've
[1:30:25] got growing corn. All you got to go in
[1:30:28] there is just defeat them and take the
[1:30:29] land. He's already done all the
[1:30:30] reconnaissance. Why does he need to Why
[1:30:33] do the people need to go out and say,
[1:30:34] "You know what? We better go over and
[1:30:36] spy out the land just to see what's over
[1:30:37] there. We We're not sure what this
[1:30:40] prophet said."
[1:30:44] They listen to the wrong voice.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; 122. Let's bring that up. Deuteronomy
[1:30:51] 122. Thank you, brother Amos.
[1:30:57] If you read the first three chapters of
[1:30:58] Deuteronomy,
[1:31:00] Moses, right before he wasn't permitted
[1:31:01] to go into the promised land, but right
[1:31:03] before Moses died, all the those at 20
[1:31:06] years old and and older were the ones
[1:31:09] that went in. So he's given a a
[1:31:11] discourse, a review of from Egypt to the
[1:31:14] promised land through the 40 years. I
[1:31:16] mean, if you want to get a a review of
[1:31:18] the whole
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; journey, read Deuteronomy 1, 2, and 3.
[1:31:22] It's a review of of everything. Moses is
[1:31:23] given a complete detailed review of the
[1:31:26] 40 years.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So here's what they say in verse 22. And
[1:31:30] ye came near me. He's talking about the
[1:31:32] congregation. And you came near unto me,
[1:31:34] every one of you, and said, we will send
[1:31:38] men before us. and they shall search out
[1:31:40] the land and bring us word again about
[1:31:43] what way we must go up into what cities
[1:31:46] we should go up into. The people came to
[1:31:49] Moses and requested spy mission and it
[1:31:52] actually was ultimately their demise,
[1:31:54] their death or resulted in their
[1:31:57] wandering. They want you know what they
[1:32:00] God's punishment was. Okay, they you
[1:32:02] went over there. You spied out the land
[1:32:04] for 40 days. Okay, I'm going to punish
[1:32:06] you. Actually, they first two years they
[1:32:09] could in three days journey they could
[1:32:11] have been in Canaan. That is true.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; But God said, "Okay, because you were
[1:32:14] disbelieve my word. I'm going to punish
[1:32:16] you. You're going to wander in the
[1:32:18] wilderness for 40 years." Because
[1:32:19] despite out the land for 40 days,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; one day for one year.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; They could have made it in three days.
[1:32:24] So five days from the time live in
[1:32:26] Egypt, they could have been in Canaan
[1:32:28] because of their unbelief.
[1:32:31] They wandered for 40 years.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Wow.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; In the wilderness.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; But God was going God gave them a little
[1:32:40] oasis. Uh Kades Barnea. The word Kades
[1:32:44] Barnea actually means a holy place in
[1:32:46] the desert of wandering. He gave them
[1:32:48] and they had springs there. He gave them
[1:32:49] just a little bit of a rest before
[1:32:51] they're going to cross over. But they
[1:32:52] didn't want to believe what God said.
[1:32:54] Wow.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Oh mercy.
[1:32:58] They listened to the wrong leaders and
[1:33:00] got the wrong revelation. Let me say
[1:33:02] this. When we think about revelation,
[1:33:04] you know, we think about, you know, some
[1:33:06] deep mysterious doctrine and Bible
[1:33:08] teaching and truth and so forth, but
[1:33:10] revelation just means something re is
[1:33:12] revealed to you as far as just
[1:33:14] revelation. And like I said, look what
[1:33:16] Eve was deceived. She got a false
[1:33:17] revelation. Satan. She actually
[1:33:22] she actually believed what Satan told
[1:33:25] her. She actually believed it because
[1:33:27] the Bible says, "For Adam was not
[1:33:28] deceived, but Eve being deceived was in
[1:33:30] the transgression." She actually thought
[1:33:33] that that was true. And that's why she
[1:33:34] did what she did. She was actually
[1:33:36] deceived
[1:33:38] because of a false revelation. The same
[1:33:40] thing about the 10 10 spies actually it
[1:33:43] ultimately produced death.
[1:33:45] Don't the Bible say that they'll be
[1:33:47] given over to a repbate mind to believe
[1:33:49] a lie and be damned by it?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; You know, and it just it just has
[1:33:53] intrigued me and it won't be too much
[1:33:54] long, but it intrigued me. Uh when
[1:33:57] brother Ram was explaining the scripture
[1:33:59] said, "Your fathers did eat mana in the
[1:34:01] wilderness and they're everyone dead."
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thought, "Well, sure, they're
[1:34:04] dead. They've been dead 2,000 years." Uh
[1:34:06] dead. That's eternally separated. He
[1:34:08] said, "Not a one of them, Joshua and
[1:34:10] Caleb, was the only two out of those
[1:34:12] original that went over. The rest of
[1:34:14] them died, eternally separated. And he
[1:34:16] said, "Everyone of them lost."
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's serious.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's like like it's like
[1:34:20] they're they're they're Hebrews. They're
[1:34:22] God's chosen. He brought them out of
[1:34:24] Egypt.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; He showed them all these miracles and
[1:34:26] everything. How important it is to stay
[1:34:30] with what the prophet said.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; We believe that. We hear that. Nothing
[1:34:35] new to us. Not nothing new to you. But
[1:34:37] I'm telling you, we don't know what we
[1:34:39] don't know how much of the squeeze is
[1:34:41] what it's going to try. It's I know it's
[1:34:43] going to try our faith. We don't know
[1:34:44] how much. I hope we just just like any
[1:34:46] day like today. Boom. We're gone out of
[1:34:47] here. I hope it happens that way. But,
[1:34:49] you know, perhaps if it don't, but I'm
[1:34:51] telling you, brothers and sisters,
[1:34:52] you're going to have to know where you
[1:34:54] stand.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; I don't want to scare you, but hey, God
[1:34:58] gives supreme grace in the supreme hour.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. You don't have to worry. So,
[1:35:08] Revelation really it means something
[1:35:10] revealed. But uh as we said, he was
[1:35:12] deceived by false revelation.
[1:35:15] So what voice are we really listening
[1:35:17] to? Uh what voice were they listening
[1:35:21] to? What voice did I hear when I heard
[1:35:23] last story? I heard the audible voice,
[1:35:25] but there was a voice behind their
[1:35:27] voice.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; They heard the voice of the 10 spies. We
[1:35:30] can't do it. But what why did they why
[1:35:32] God done said you got the land? Why
[1:35:34] didn't they just take what Joshua and
[1:35:36] Caleb? What voice told them, you know
[1:35:38] what? these 10, they make more sense
[1:35:40] than these two.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But, you know, it's just it's just I I
[1:35:49] know it's it's hard for us to really put
[1:35:51] oursel back into that time and believe
[1:35:53] that, but we still have the same thing
[1:35:56] today. We still have the same thing
[1:35:57] today.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; The devil comes to you, he comes to me,
[1:36:00] he comes to everybody. Oh, yeah. There
[1:36:02] was going to be rapture, but you're not
[1:36:03] one of them. There's only going to be a
[1:36:04] few, brother Man. to be just a few, but
[1:36:07] you know, there'll be several, but you
[1:36:08] won't be one. Just all of these things
[1:36:10] the devil comes to you. Comes to all of
[1:36:11] us. We know that, you know,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; but greater is he that's within us than
[1:36:15] he that's in the world. Satan, get
[1:36:17] behind me. Resist the devil, he'll flee
[1:36:19] from you. Turn on a tape. Believe what
[1:36:21] the prophet has said, you know, just,
[1:36:23] you know, I mean, we just uh it's it's
[1:36:26] it's going to be sticky till we get out
[1:36:27] of here. But that's why we got to stay
[1:36:29] in those tapes, stay in the word,
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; you know, read your Bible, go to church,
[1:36:33] pray, stay in a spiritual atmosphere as
[1:36:35] much as possible because the devil's a
[1:36:37] slicker.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Remember, Satan has a voice. He can
[1:36:45] speak. He can whisper. He can anoint. He
[1:36:46] can deceive. He can twist the truth.
[1:36:49] Because they doubted God's prophet,
[1:36:51] Moses said that they despised. This is
[1:36:54] Moses said they despised the promised
[1:36:56] land. They despise the promised land.
[1:36:59] You want to read that? Pull up Psalms
[1:37:02] 106 verse 24. This is I mean then we're
[1:37:05] going to move on and close. This is how
[1:37:08] how could it be in the eyes of God?
[1:37:10] Psalms 106:4 says, "Yay, they despised
[1:37:14] the pleasant land. They believed not his
[1:37:18] word, but murmured in their tents and
[1:37:21] hearkened not to the voice of the Lord."
[1:37:24] really it was the voice of the prophet
[1:37:26] which was the voice of the Lord.
[1:37:28] Therefore, because of they disbelieved,
[1:37:31] because they doubted, therefore he God
[1:37:34] lifted up his hand against them to
[1:37:36] overthrow them in the wilderness. How
[1:37:39] striking. They they sealed their they
[1:37:42] sealed their destiny by the fa in the
[1:37:46] first two years of the wilderness
[1:37:47] journey. They sealed their destiny in
[1:37:48] the first two years by listening to 10
[1:37:50] false witness witnesses.
[1:37:53] That's how important true revelation is
[1:37:56] to us. Amen.
[1:38:00] It's just it's just it's it it
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; I I thought about it for years and
[1:38:04] years, but it's still just
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; It just blows my mind, so to speak.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; The ill fate of two million Israelites
[1:38:12] at Kades Barnea was solely the result of
[1:38:14] a negative influence and recommendation
[1:38:16] from 10 leaders.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Amen. God gave them the land. God
[1:38:23] gave them the land and those 10 leaders
[1:38:25] talked him out of it.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; That's a sad picture. That's a sad
[1:38:29] picture. God gave them the land and man
[1:38:31] talked him out of it. That's like
[1:38:33] brother Bren said or somebody said we we
[1:38:34] know it's the truth. If God if somebody
[1:38:36] somebody gives you a revelation then
[1:38:38] somebody else can talk you out of it.
[1:38:40] God has to give the revelation. And when
[1:38:41] he gives you the revelation it's
[1:38:43] anchored. Ain't nobody gonna talk about
[1:38:45] it. That's why it's so absolutely
[1:38:47] imperative that we believe and follow
[1:38:48] what the prophet taught and said and
[1:38:52] Paul said if we are angels of heaven
[1:38:54] believe preach any other gospel what I
[1:38:56] preach let him be accursed
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; in 1946 brother when he got his
[1:39:02] commission I'm going to bring this last
[1:39:03] thought we close he said if you can get
[1:39:06] the people to believe you be sincere
[1:39:09] when you pray nothing will stand in your
[1:39:10] way not even cancer why did he say you
[1:39:14] very interesting
[1:39:17] In this one uh in the church age book he
[1:39:21] says in the days of the voice of the
[1:39:22] seventh angel master when he shall begin
[1:39:24] to sound the mystery of God shall be
[1:39:26] finished as he is declared to his
[1:39:28] servants of prophets. See when you think
[1:39:31] about the mystery and finished really a
[1:39:34] mystery is a truth unknowable except to
[1:39:37] be given by divine revelation
[1:39:39] and finished means to be brought to a
[1:39:43] pop proper understanding to be finished
[1:39:46] to be
[1:39:47] to be brought to a proper proper
[1:39:49] understanding of the timelines something
[1:39:51] on that order there there it is he God
[1:39:54] is sending a vindicated prophet he
[1:39:57] speaking of God is sending a prophet
[1:40:00] after almost 2,000 years, he is sending
[1:40:03] someone who is so far from organization,
[1:40:05] education, and the world of religion
[1:40:08] that as John the Baptist and Elijah
[1:40:11] Bolt, he will only and now he's talking
[1:40:15] about the prophet, he will only hear
[1:40:17] from God. He will have thus sayith the
[1:40:20] Lord and he will speak for God and he
[1:40:23] will be God's mouthpiece
[1:40:25] and he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6
[1:40:28] will turn the hearts of the children
[1:40:30] back to the fathers he the seventh angel
[1:40:32] messenger will bring back the elected in
[1:40:35] the last days and they speaking of us
[1:40:38] they will hear a vindicated prophet and
[1:40:41] give the exact give they will hear a
[1:40:43] vindicated prophet give the exact truth
[1:40:45] as is as is with Paul he will restore
[1:40:48] the truth as they had it. And those
[1:40:51] elect
[1:40:52] with him in that day will be the ones
[1:40:55] who truly manifest the Lord and be his
[1:40:59] body and be his voice
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; and perform his works.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah, they will.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That's what you are.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; That's what you've been ordained to be,
[1:41:10] designated to be, predestinated to be.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You're the final voice to the final age
[1:41:15] under your messenger. That's good,
[1:41:17] brother.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Under your messenger.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Don't get away from that. Under your
[1:41:22] messenger.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say one day he said uh uh when
[1:41:27] he was translated they said all these
[1:41:29] brands? No, these not all brands. You're
[1:41:30] converts. So I want to see Jesus. He's a
[1:41:32] little bit higher. But one day he'll
[1:41:34] come to you and you will present all
[1:41:36] them to the Lord Jesus. Each messenger
[1:41:39] will present his group to the Lord
[1:41:41] Jesus.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; The Lordise.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; What what a time a glorious time that'll
[1:41:45] be. Amen. So
[1:41:48] he will only hear from God. He will have
[1:41:50] thus sayith the Lord. He'll speak for
[1:41:51] God. He's God's mouthpiece. He'll
[1:41:53] restore the truth. Those that believe
[1:41:56] what the prophet said, they will one
[1:41:58] that will actually be the final voice in
[1:41:59] the final days. Now that's good enough
[1:42:01] for me. Now here's why brother M said if
[1:42:04] you can get the people to believe you.
[1:42:06] Very interesting.
[1:42:08] God knows this that the angel Lord who
[1:42:10] met me said if you can get the people to
[1:42:13] believe you be sincere when you pray
[1:42:17] there'll be nothing stand before your
[1:42:19] prayer there'll be nothing just think of
[1:42:22] that no matter what disease you have
[1:42:25] excuse me it won't stand before prayer
[1:42:28] if you will believe now what must you
[1:42:31] believe now he's asked question what
[1:42:33] must you believe
[1:42:37] letting that soak What must you believe?
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Believe in God first.
[1:42:44] Now, we know brother, I'm not a
[1:42:45] trinitarian. Believe in God first.
[1:42:48] Believe in the son of God, Jesus Christ.
[1:42:51] Believe in the Holy Spirit. Believe in
[1:42:53] angels. And then you've got to believe
[1:42:56] me.
[1:42:58] You got to believe God, the Holy Spirit,
[1:43:00] Lord Jesus, which is God in another
[1:43:01] form, the angels. He said, "You've got
[1:43:02] to believe. You got to, in other words,
[1:43:04] you got to believe the word. You got to
[1:43:05] believe the authority. And then you've
[1:43:07] got to believe me.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And then you've got to believe me that
[1:43:11] I'm telling you the truth. Do you
[1:43:13] believe that? Now that's wonderful.
[1:43:14] Another another quote he says.
[1:43:18] He said uh he's rehearsing what the
[1:43:20] angel told him. Said, "Do not fear."
[1:43:22] When that voice spoke, I know was the
[1:43:23] same one. He looked at me. His eyes
[1:43:25] looked at me kindly uh not to look
[1:43:28] sympathizing with it angel, but said,
[1:43:30] "Do not fear." said,"I am sent from the
[1:43:32] presence of God to tell you that your
[1:43:34] peculiar birth, peculiar birth and
[1:43:37] peculiar life has been to indicate that
[1:43:38] you'll take a gift of divine healing to
[1:43:40] the people of the world." I said, "Sir,
[1:43:42] I'm un I'm uneducated. I couldn't go."
[1:43:46] He said, "If you'll get them to believe
[1:43:48] you, and if you'll be sincere when you
[1:43:51] pray, nothing shall stand before your
[1:43:54] prayer if you can get them to believe
[1:43:56] you." I said, "I bet they won't believe
[1:43:59] me, sir." He said, "You'll be given two
[1:44:02] signs." The prophet Moses was given two
[1:44:03] signs to get the people to believe you
[1:44:06] is really the issue.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; It's really the issue. Now, how can you
[1:44:12] explain all that? I don't have to
[1:44:14] explain all that. All I know is what he
[1:44:16] said. We've got to believe what what do
[1:44:18] we read in our text? What how can we do
[1:44:20] the works of God? Musicians come on. How
[1:44:23] can we do the works of God? Believe on
[1:44:26] him who he hath sent. Brother Bram said
[1:44:30] one place, one of the hardest things in
[1:44:32] the world is paraphrase and one of the
[1:44:33] hardest things in the world is to get
[1:44:35] one human to believe another human.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Get one human being to believe another
[1:44:40] human being.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; But God uses human beings to preach the
[1:44:46] gospel. God used Moses. God used all the
[1:44:49] different prophets he had. God used each
[1:44:51] one of them to to bring his word. Surely
[1:44:53] God would do nothing except to reveal
[1:44:55] the secrets to his servants, the
[1:44:56] prophets.
[1:44:59] Oh, to get you
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; get you people to believe is really the
[1:45:02] issue.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; And then he he goes on to say he said
[1:45:05] then one of them was detecting diseases
[1:45:07] just by holding the person's right hand.
[1:45:08] He said then if you'll be sincere it'll
[1:45:10] come to pass. You can tell the very
[1:45:12] secrets there of the hearts and the
[1:45:14] things that they're doing wrong to build
[1:45:15] faith in the people to be in faith and
[1:45:18] to vindicate that God will send it to
[1:45:21] you. Amen.
[1:45:24] In closing here, another quote.
[1:45:27] A momentary late in church age. A
[1:45:29] momentary cons consideration of church
[1:45:31] history will prove how accurate this
[1:45:33] thought is. In the dark ages, the word
[1:45:36] was almost entirely lost to the people.
[1:45:38] But God sent Luther with the word. The
[1:45:40] Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[1:45:42] This religion. Look how it comes down.
[1:45:44] The Lutheran spoke for God at that time.
[1:45:45] Luther's message was correct. That's
[1:45:47] right. for that day. But they organized
[1:45:50] and again the pure word was lost for
[1:45:52] organization tends to toward dogmas and
[1:45:54] creeds and not simple word. They could
[1:45:57] no longer speak for God. They could and
[1:46:00] then they couldn't.
[1:46:02] Then God sent Wesley and he was the
[1:46:04] voice with the word for that day. The
[1:46:06] people who took his revelation from God
[1:46:09] became the living epistles read known of
[1:46:11] all men for that generation. Now this is
[1:46:14] this we know this.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. But it's so profound.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; When the methods failed, God raised up
[1:46:21] others. And so has gone down through the
[1:46:22] years until in the last days, there is
[1:46:25] again another people in the land who
[1:46:28] under their messenger will be the final
[1:46:31] voice to the final age.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; He didn't say they might be some maybe a
[1:46:37] few of them might might overcome. They
[1:46:40] will be they will be they will be the
[1:46:43] final voice to the final age.
[1:46:46] Amen.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "But then if you really if your
[1:46:51] faith has been built on if your faith
[1:46:53] has been built on somebody, some divine
[1:46:56] healer or somebody professing that's got
[1:46:58] something when they have it, then you're
[1:47:01] gone. But your if your faith is built on
[1:47:03] the word of God, all devils out of hell
[1:47:06] couldn't ever deny make you deny it. All
[1:47:09] devils out of hell could not make you
[1:47:10] deny it."
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That's why those uh 12
[1:47:14] apostles outside of John
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; died a martyr's death. I don't care what
[1:47:18] death it doesn't matter. Put the sword
[1:47:19] through me. I'm not going to deny the
[1:47:20] Lord Jesus. I'm not going to I'm not
[1:47:22] going to deny my revelation. No. No. He
[1:47:25] said it's not up here mental theology.
[1:47:29] It's down here in your heart. It isn't
[1:47:31] the intellectual faith up here. Remember
[1:47:34] he said, you know, the first second
[1:47:36] pool. What? Why? One place he said the
[1:47:38] first second pool wasn't really the
[1:47:39] perfect will of God. Why? because it
[1:47:41] caused carnal impersonation. He said the
[1:47:43] third pull will not be a public show.
[1:47:45] It's a secret. It's a secret. It won't
[1:47:47] be a public show at all.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; But you'll know. We'll know. We'll know.
[1:47:51] Amen. He said it's a faith that's sunk
[1:47:54] in your heart. That's why it's the
[1:47:56] heart. The heart. The heart. The heart.
[1:47:57] The heart. It's your faith that sunk in
[1:48:00] your heart. No matter how dark the road
[1:48:02] looks, you still shout the praises of
[1:48:04] God because you know God's revealed it
[1:48:06] to you. And that settles it. Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; God's revealed to you. That settles it.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. God's
[1:48:15] revealed to you. It's the word of God.
[1:48:17] We know it's the truth. That settles it.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why people sometime
[1:48:23] needs instructions. Having knowing where
[1:48:25] your faith lays, not upon man, not on
[1:48:27] somebody's ritual, not some curious
[1:48:30] feeling or something other like that.
[1:48:31] Your faith is built on the word of God.
[1:48:33] That's where your That's where faith
[1:48:35] takes its resting place. You love him,
[1:48:38] brother. God bless you, saints.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. How many
[1:48:46] appreciates that word this morning?
[1:48:48] Amen. Amen. I uh I was thinking there a
[1:48:54] song we could sing. Amen. Whose report?
[1:48:58] Y'all going to have to help me with
[1:48:59] that, but I think it's very fitting.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Whose report you're going to believe?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. There's another song I wish
[1:49:05] we could learn it sometime. And for the
[1:49:07] Episcopals Church. Well, it's not
[1:49:08] Brother Episcopals anymore, but they
[1:49:10] sing it up there. Uh uh I I believe the
[1:49:14] true report. And that's a good one, too.
[1:49:17] I hope we can learn to sing that
[1:49:19] sometime. But whose report will you
[1:49:21] believe? I can truly say I believe the
[1:49:24] report. Amen. This is a time of
[1:49:27] restitution of all things under Malachi
[1:49:30] 4.
[1:49:32] He said about you know the new birth and
[1:49:36] uh Jesus said he'll restore all things a
[1:49:39] l it was under revelation 10:7 the
[1:49:43] mystery of God should be finished. So
[1:49:45] all these things that's been mysterious,
[1:49:47] you know, and I was thinking just as
[1:49:49] brother Terry was reading those last
[1:49:51] comments, we actually understand
[1:49:53] Wesley's message more better than
[1:49:56] actually he did.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Luther's message the same way all the
[1:50:02] messengers even in Paul's day. This
[1:50:06] ain't discredit, but it's the the
[1:50:09] prophet messenger was to really open up
[1:50:12] the the book is open. from cover to
[1:50:16] cover.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God for it. Let's sing that
[1:50:19] song. You'll have to help me. Brother
[1:50:21] Branson, help me out singing and see if
[1:50:23] you can sing over top of the drums.
[1:50:26] Amen. Whose report will you believe?
[1:50:39] Whose report
[1:50:41] will you believe?
[1:50:44] He shall believe the report of the Lord.
[1:50:52] His report says I am healed.
[1:50:57] His report says I am sealed.
[1:51:03] His report says I am free. His
[1:51:10] report says victory.
[1:51:16] Whose report
[1:51:18] will you believe?
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:27] Whose report will you believe?
[1:51:35] His
[1:51:38] [Music]
[1:51:40] report says I am healed.
[1:51:45] His report says I am sealed.
[1:51:50] His report says I am free.
[1:51:56] His report says victory.
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:03] Whose report
[1:52:05] will you believe?
[1:52:09] We shall believe the report of the Lord.
[1:52:14] Whose report
[1:52:16] will you believe?
[1:52:20] We shall believe the report of the Lord.
[1:52:26] His report says I am healed. Glory. His
[1:52:32] reort says I am sealed.
[1:52:37] His reort says I am free.
[1:52:43] His report says victory.
[1:52:50] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:52:52] Amen. You believe the report this
[1:52:54] morning. and you believe the report to
[1:52:56] you directly this morning that no matter
[1:52:59] what you've been struggling with. Amen.
[1:53:02] And something that's been bothering you,
[1:53:04] do you believe the report of the Lord?
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give God the opportunity, you
[1:53:09] know. Amen. You know, I don't want to
[1:53:11] preach after our brother. And it was
[1:53:12] good. Amen. And they were the ones that
[1:53:15] came up with the idea of sending. You
[1:53:18] see, God had already done all the leg
[1:53:21] work. He had already did it. But they
[1:53:23] come up with this thing and you know,
[1:53:25] even Moses went along with it. Amen. You
[1:53:28] see, even Moses was a man just like you
[1:53:30] and I. But you know, but thank God
[1:53:33] Joshua and Caleb, we're the type of
[1:53:35] Joshua and Caleb today. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:39] Amen. Amen. So, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:42] Let's remember those who are traveling
[1:53:44] and um Amen. And I I you know, you start
[1:53:47] to thank people for certain things here
[1:53:49] in the church, doing things, and you
[1:53:51] always overlook, let's remember those
[1:53:54] the sisters that are cleaning the church
[1:53:56] and the restrooms and all that.
[1:53:58] Everybody that plays a part, these
[1:54:00] plants, you know, somebody takes care of
[1:54:02] them. And everybody that has a part,
[1:54:05] musicians, big or small, even the one,
[1:54:08] you know, you put in the offering plate,
[1:54:09] you know, that's all God sees it. And
[1:54:12] God knows whether our heart's in it. We
[1:54:14] got a stingy heart, you know, or or
[1:54:16] we've got a liberal heart towards the
[1:54:18] Lord to support, keep the lights on,
[1:54:20] keep the heat in here, keep the air
[1:54:21] conditioner going, what have you, the
[1:54:23] upkeep of the building. Amen. Everyone
[1:54:26] plays a part. So, may God bless you.
[1:54:28] Remember our pastor as he travels.
[1:54:30] They're finishing up the services out
[1:54:32] there or brother down at brother Fred
[1:54:34] Mullins. I believe they was that's where
[1:54:36] he was. So, anyway, let's remember
[1:54:39] everyone in prayer. And in closing,
[1:54:41] Amen. Let's just bow our heads. So, I'm
[1:54:43] going to ask brother Will if he would
[1:54:44] dismiss with prayer this morning.
