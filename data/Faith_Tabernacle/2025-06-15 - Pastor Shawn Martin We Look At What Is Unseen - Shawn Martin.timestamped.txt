[38:52] fathers, happy Father's Day and trust
[38:55] you uh just have a wonderful day. I I
[38:59] know the um
[39:01] uh the home life is being attacked today
[39:05] and and to be honest, we are a uh my
[39:08] opinion a rarity uh these days. Um uh
[39:13] but um I thank God for the message of
[39:17] the hour. I thank God for his spirit
[39:19] that um uh lives within us and it makes
[39:24] us uh just uh want to hold hold steady.
[39:28] Amen. And um so I I really appreciate
[39:32] you fathers u standing there for your
[39:36] family and uh being true examples
[39:40] of u what God intended family to be.
[39:43] Amen. And um if there's ever a time we
[39:46] should honor uh parents or or children
[39:49] should honor their fathers, it's now.
[39:52] And uh wives should honor their
[39:55] husbands, it's now. Amen. And the attack
[39:58] um being attacked, mothers and fathers
[40:01] and husbands, they're being attacked.
[40:04] And Satan is just trying to make us just
[40:07] another
[40:08] um statistic in this age. But um uh
[40:13] we're we're holding holding fast. Amen.
[40:16] If you have your Bibles, we're going to
[40:17] turn first of all to the book of Psalms.
[40:20] And um we're going to read a few
[40:23] scriptures here that um
[40:31] Psalms
[40:33] 20 or uh actually let's go to
[40:36] Deuteronomy
[40:38] 29:29.
[40:41] Amen. Um,
[40:44] I believe that's where I'm wanting to
[40:46] go,
[40:47] but um,
[40:51] praise the Lord.
[40:53] Deuteronomy
[40:55] 29 and 29.
[40:58] Yeah.
[40:59] It says, "The secret things belong unto
[41:02] the Lord our God, but those things which
[41:05] are revealed belong to us and to our
[41:07] children forever, that we may do all the
[41:10] words of this law."
[41:13] Then if you'll turn to First Corinthians
[41:17] um 2.
[41:20] 1 Corinthians chapter 2.
[41:24] Amen.
[41:26] and um see if I can find it.
[41:38] 1 Corinthians 2 and nine. We'll start
[41:42] there. But as it is written, I hath not
[41:45] seen nor ear heard, neither have entered
[41:47] into the heart of man the things which
[41:50] God hath prepared for them that love
[41:52] him. But God hath revealed them unto us
[41:55] by his spirit. For the Spirit searchth
[41:58] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[42:03] For what man knoweth the things of a
[42:05] man, save the spirit of man which is in
[42:07] him? Even so the things of God knoweth
[42:10] no man, but the spirit of God. Now we
[42:12] have received not the spirit of the
[42:14] world but the spirit which is of God
[42:17] that we might know the things that are
[42:20] freely given to us of God. Amen. Then uh
[42:25] second Corinthians
[42:27] uh the 4th chapter.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:34] Second Corinthians chapter 4.
[42:38] And uh we'll start at the
[42:41] let's see I believe it's the 17th verse
[42:47] says for our light affliction
[42:49] which is but for a moment workketh for
[42:52] us a far exceeding and eternal weight of
[42:54] glory while we look not at the things
[42:57] which are seen but at the things which
[43:00] are not seen. For the things
[43:03] uh which are seen are temporal, but the
[43:06] things which are not seen are eternal.
[43:08] So we look not at the things which are
[43:11] seen, but at the things which are not
[43:14] seen. Amen. Let's just bow our heads.
[43:22] Okay. All right. We sure will. And and
[43:25] that does rem remind me, I didn't bring
[43:27] it to Daniel, but um my um um my aunt's
[43:33] husband
[43:35] um uh brother Donald Bendabout, he's
[43:38] going to be having open heart surgery
[43:40] Tuesday
[43:42] and um they said he could go anytime and
[43:46] um so uh he's in really bad need of
[43:50] prayer. So let's just pray for these
[43:52] needs as well. Father,
[43:56] Lord, we come to you as your children,
[43:59] Father. Lord, uh based off the blood,
[44:03] based off your promises,
[44:06] Lord, and you have petitioned us to come
[44:08] before your throne of grace boldly,
[44:11] Father, to find help in time of need.
[44:14] And Lord, we're just asking that you
[44:16] would touch our sister Alice, Father, as
[44:20] Lord, she's having this dizzy spell. and
[44:23] uh fighting this inner body, Father. And
[44:27] we're just asking that you would just
[44:29] set her free from this, Father. There's
[44:33] nothing too hard for you. And Father,
[44:36] she's been faithful to come to the house
[44:38] of God this morning and Satan trying to
[44:41] uh to disrupt her, Lord, from hearing
[44:44] the word and not enjoying it. And I
[44:47] pray, Father, that you would just go out
[44:50] where she's at, Father, and remove this
[44:53] uh uh symptom from her, Father. And I
[44:56] pray that you would touch Brother
[44:58] Donald, Lord, um as he is facing this
[45:02] open heart surgery. And Father, it's a a
[45:06] dire need that he he has this, Lord,
[45:08] done. And I pray that you would be with
[45:11] him, Father. And Lord, just bring him
[45:14] through this, Lord. And father, keep him
[45:18] uh uh with us, Father, is our prayer,
[45:22] Lord. And I pray that you would just
[45:24] bless the reading of your word today.
[45:26] Bless the ministering of your word. We
[45:28] know it's hot, Father, but pray that
[45:30] something would be said to help your
[45:32] people in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[45:37] amen. Uh you can have your seats this
[45:40] morning. And uh I uh I won't take long
[45:45] I uh I was given a u given a uh a cert
[45:50] this morning and uh I said don't worry
[45:53] about that. I already got one made and
[45:56] it's supposed to last for five hours. So
[46:01] and uh so anyways, but it was a it was
[46:04] fun. And it was a uh they were kidened.
[46:08] And so um but uh just just briefly
[46:13] um you know we're we're being tested,
[46:17] we're being tried
[46:19] um and and
[46:22] uh you know just it just seems like
[46:26] everything is Satan is attacking on
[46:29] every hand. And uh you know uh the
[46:34] prophet said there is so much fear in
[46:37] the world today
[46:39] um that uh u in the church today and
[46:44] brother Brandham said this this fear is
[46:46] that people are afraid that God won't
[46:49] keep his word. Uh that's that's the fear
[46:53] that God just won't keep his word. And I
[46:55] was listening to him today in in the
[46:58] covenant uh that God made with Abraham
[47:01] and he said that's one of the greatest
[47:03] curses that's in the church today is the
[47:07] people who are afraid to lay a hold of
[47:11] God's word the promise. Now think of
[47:14] that who that that's amazing of how
[47:17] people would be afraid to lay a hold of
[47:19] the the only thing that could help us
[47:22] but they're afraid to lay a hold of
[47:24] God's word. the promise. But he says,
[47:26] "How could God ever take one of his
[47:29] words back?" Why? It would be easier.
[47:33] Now, notice what he said. "It would be
[47:36] easier for all the stars to just vanish
[47:39] out of the skies, the sun, the moon, and
[47:42] the earth to pass away than it would be
[47:46] for God to take his word back."
[47:48] it would be easier uh uh uh for this to
[47:52] happen because uh he says the word of
[47:55] God is eternal and it's forever right.
[47:59] How many believes that it's forever
[48:01] right? So so there's not one time that
[48:04] it'll be wrong. It's forever right. But
[48:08] God's word cannot pass away. So he says,
[48:11] "How I love to rest my weary soul upon
[48:16] every word of it." Ain't that right? It
[48:19] just seems like when you just uh uh hang
[48:23] it up there and say, "There it is." See,
[48:25] it's got to happen. See? Uh cuz God said
[48:30] so. How many believes that? And if God
[48:33] promised it, God has to keep his his
[48:37] word. Amen. Uh you know we the Bible
[48:41] tells us that we are hes
[48:45] and u uh which means that we have an
[48:48] inheritance and you know we could go uh
[48:51] quite along
[48:53] in depth on that inheritance and things
[48:56] but uh uh but an inheritance is
[49:00] something that has been given to us. Uh
[49:03] you don't earn it. you don't um uh you
[49:08] know uh you don't get it on your own is
[49:11] someone just gives it to you and it's
[49:13] left to you and so the one who receives
[49:16] the inheritance is called an heir and
[49:21] you know uh we we've heard it brother
[49:23] Brandham has dealt with it on this law
[49:25] of adoption and I I'm I'm guessing he's
[49:28] probably uh one of the only ones uh that
[49:33] has dealt with the law of adoption uh
[49:36] out of the ministers around and still
[49:38] yet I don't I outside of the message uh
[49:42] but but we wouldn't the law of adoption
[49:45] wouldn't really mean much to us if we
[49:47] didn't have the message and brother
[49:49] Brandham really focused on that uh and
[49:52] and of course he he talks about you know
[49:55] the law of adoption is when the son is
[49:57] is adopted and and when he is adopted he
[50:01] comes into his inheritance. So he's born
[50:04] a son uh uh but the inheritance is the
[50:09] kingdom that his father uh owns or has
[50:14] um and it's given over to him. So I
[50:17] think most of us know what brother
[50:18] Brandham says about the that there but
[50:21] brother Brandham says when the child was
[50:23] born he was a son but his conduct had to
[50:27] do with his inheritance. Ain't that
[50:30] right? And so uh then then we know how
[50:33] that the father he would be so busy with
[50:35] his kingdom and and the things taking
[50:38] care of the uh checking this field out
[50:41] and the servants over here and he just
[50:43] had a vast uh land and and and kingdom
[50:47] and so he he couldn't take care of of
[50:50] the son properly. So he would hire him a
[50:53] tutor and and uh set that tutor over the
[50:57] the the child and the tutor would teach
[51:01] uh the child the way of the father. And
[51:04] brother Brandham tells us of how that
[51:06] the the tutor had to know the father. He
[51:08] was he was basically best friends. Uh he
[51:11] was a trusted uh uh man and uh the
[51:16] father could trust him. And so uh uh the
[51:18] tutor would teach the child the ways of
[51:20] the father. the the um the conduct of
[51:24] the father, how the father conducted his
[51:26] business and things and and he would
[51:28] tell about all the father's kingdom and
[51:32] how the father run the kingdom and and
[51:35] what the father liked and what he didn't
[51:37] like. And so uh um and then if the child
[51:41] was obedient to the the the the tutor
[51:45] and really listened to the tutor, well
[51:47] then the the the child then he he would
[51:51] al he would start walking the way the
[51:54] father walked. He would start talking
[51:56] the way the father talked. He would
[51:58] start thinking the way the father uh uh
[52:02] thought. He would start handling things
[52:04] the way the father would handle things.
[52:07] Amen. And so his his character was being
[52:11] molded into the father's character and
[52:14] the likeness of the father. Uh not maybe
[52:17] just in looks but in character because
[52:21] he he was he was he was subjecting
[52:24] himself to the tutorship that was set
[52:28] over him. and and and so uh then if the
[52:32] child was of good character, then he was
[52:35] interested in the father's business, he
[52:37] was studious about the father's
[52:39] business, everything was about the
[52:41] father's business. and and and then of
[52:44] course, you know, the tutor would uh uh
[52:47] send word back uh uh to the uh father
[52:50] and and because the father wanted to
[52:52] know what kind of a character his son
[52:54] had and and things and because he wasn't
[52:57] going to give the kingdom over to
[53:00] someone that that wasn't wasn't going to
[53:03] take care of the kingdom. I mean, the
[53:05] father had spent all this time guarding
[53:07] that kingdom and building that kingdom
[53:09] up, and he wasn't going to give to
[53:11] somebody that wasn't appreciative of it
[53:14] and wasn't going to run it right and was
[53:16] just going to let it go down into the
[53:18] ground and and all of these things. You
[53:20] understand what I'm saying? See, and and
[53:22] so he wanted a a son the uh that that
[53:25] had the same appreciation for it, had
[53:28] the same desire to keep it going, had
[53:31] the same thought, the same motive, the
[53:33] same ambition and all of these things.
[53:35] And he would take care of it and he
[53:37] would he would be careful on how he ran
[53:39] the business and and all of these
[53:41] things. See? And so uh uh uh uh uh then
[53:46] the the the prophet said if the son was
[53:47] obedient, then the tutor could say to
[53:49] the father, "Oh, that fella, he is one
[53:51] of the smartest little chaps I've ever
[53:53] seen. Even though he's youthful, amen,
[53:56] he's just a chip off the old block.
[53:58] That's all. He loves you. He's just
[54:00] exactly like you. He's about your
[54:02] business. He stands exactly firm on what
[54:04] you say. And he's just like you. Ain't
[54:07] that right?" So then the father would
[54:09] set up a time and he would call an
[54:12] assembly and he would adopt this child
[54:14] and and his son into the family and and
[54:18] then the son uh uh he he had come to
[54:21] that maturity and now he was placed over
[54:24] the inheritance or over the kingdom. He
[54:27] was given full authority. He spoke in
[54:30] the father'sstead. The father would just
[54:32] kind of back off from the scene. Amen.
[54:35] And the son stepped forward. Amen.
[54:37] Everything was under his command. Uh his
[54:40] signature on the check was just as good
[54:42] as the father's. Ain't that right? And
[54:44] and so I want to just say it this way.
[54:47] It's not that God's not wanting us to
[54:49] wait till we get to heaven to have our
[54:51] inheritance. I I believe that our
[54:54] inheritance is right before us and is is
[54:57] obtainable even now. Amen. So you
[55:02] remember Jesus uh being on the mount
[55:05] transfiguration
[55:07] uh the prophet said he was adopted. That
[55:09] was his time of adoption. I know some
[55:11] don't believe that uh and and some
[55:14] ministers but but he was adopted on
[55:17] Mount Transfiguration. And the father
[55:19] said, "I placed him positionally. That's
[55:21] my son. I placed him positionally.
[55:24] That's my son. What he says, I'll back
[55:27] up. He's kept my words. He's fought
[55:29] through all these denominations and
[55:31] everything else and has kept the faith.
[55:34] See, he pulls no punches. He's been
[55:36] true. He's always about my work. And
[55:38] when people look at him, they see me.
[55:41] See, this is my son. Hear ye him. Ain't
[55:46] that right? So, so Jesus said, "Come to
[55:48] his place of adoption." But but the
[55:50] Bible says that uh uh we are
[55:53] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[55:57] which means we have an inheritance
[56:01] uh which means that I am an heir you are
[56:04] an heir of of an inheritance. Ain't that
[56:07] right? And so the prophet talked about
[56:10] how that we have come through this
[56:11] church organization
[56:13] uh the dispensation of church
[56:15] organization. We have we have come
[56:17] through the dispensation of the
[56:19] outpouring of the Holy Ghost and now
[56:21] we're living in the dispensation of
[56:25] adoption. Ain't that right? We are
[56:28] living in this dispensation of adoption.
[56:31] Now, we wouldn't know that if it had not
[56:33] been for a prophet, amen, to tell us the
[56:36] day, the age, the time that we're living
[56:39] in. Now, the prophet said the your
[56:41] adoption is not your birth. So when
[56:44] they're teaching that adoption and the
[56:46] birth is the same thing, it's not. The
[56:49] prophet said your adoption is not your
[56:51] birth. Your adoption is your placing.
[56:54] When you were born again, John 1:17, he
[56:57] says, I believe we when we are born
[56:59] again of the spirit of God, we are sons
[57:02] of God, but we were predestinated. And
[57:04] he says, now that's what I'm trying to
[57:06] get to you is for the sons of the last
[57:09] day. We were predestinated unto
[57:12] adoption. Another place. If Christ is in
[57:15] you, then your faith is like the faith
[57:17] that was in Christ. I want to say that
[57:19] again. If Christ is in you, then your
[57:22] faith is like the faith that was in
[57:25] Jesus Christ. You believe the father for
[57:28] you are sons and daughters of God by the
[57:30] adoption by Jesus Christ. Ain't that
[57:34] right? In 1955, brother Brandham said
[57:37] this. He said the Holy Spirit will move
[57:39] in not with a new birth for we have
[57:42] received that through Christ but God
[57:44] will adopt his church then and then
[57:47] she'll be clothed in the power of the
[57:50] resurrected Lord. Now that was in 1955
[57:53] and I believe that that that happened
[57:55] exactly the way he said it. Amen. In in
[57:58] 63. Amen. But so so he says here and
[58:02] this is I think important. Let us be
[58:05] subject in faith. Everybody say, "In
[58:07] faith, let us be subject to him in faith
[58:13] who is our father and live." Ain't that
[58:16] right? So, so then that that's what
[58:19] we're required to do. That's the only
[58:21] way you can be subject unto God the
[58:24] Father is be subject to him in faith. In
[58:28] faith. Can you say amen? Amen. Be
[58:31] subject in him. In other words, taking
[58:33] him at his word. Amen. And and we know
[58:36] that uh uh to be subject to him in faith
[58:40] is to be subject to the word in faith
[58:43] because he is the word. So we're subject
[58:46] to the word in faith. And so then Paul
[58:49] would say in Ephesians 1:1, we have
[58:52] obtained an inheritance being
[58:54] predestinated according to the purpose
[58:56] of him who workketh all things after the
[58:59] counsel of his own will. Ain't that
[59:02] right? And so we we find that uh uh we
[59:07] are heirs uh to the promise. And uh well
[59:11] then how can we be heirs? You know uh
[59:14] Paul would tell us there in Romans 8:17
[59:18] he tells us that we are heirs of God.
[59:22] Now think of that we are heirs of God.
[59:26] Amen. And so how can we be heirs of God
[59:29] except we be a son of God, a son, a
[59:32] daughter of God. Ain't that right? Amen.
[59:35] And and what makes us a son of God is is
[59:38] according to Genesis, we were made in
[59:41] the image of God. Ain't that right?
[59:44] Amen. This makes us a little amateur
[59:47] God. Amen. as the prophet said, you
[59:49] know, and Genesis 1:26, God said, "Let
[59:52] us make man in our image, after our
[59:54] likeness, and let them have dominion
[59:58] over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[1:00:00] of the air, over the cattle, over all
[1:00:02] the earth, over every creeping thing
[1:00:04] that creepeth upon the earth." Ain't
[1:00:06] that right? So, we are to have dominion.
[1:00:09] And then he says, "Multiply, be fruitful
[1:00:12] uh uh and replenish the earth and subdue
[1:00:14] it and have dominion." Amen. Over the
[1:00:18] fish of the sea, over the fowl of the
[1:00:19] air, over every living thing that moveth
[1:00:22] upon the earth. So, Brother Brham said,
[1:00:24] "Man in the beginning, when he was made,
[1:00:28] a man is a God." Ain't that right? He's
[1:00:32] absolutely a God. For he was made in the
[1:00:35] image of God, being a son of God. Then
[1:00:38] he is heir to all that God is.
[1:00:44] Not that God has. Not being heir to all
[1:00:46] that God has, but heir to all that God
[1:00:49] is. Whatever God is, we're heir to that.
[1:00:53] Ain't that right? Yes, sir. See, that's
[1:00:56] why Peter would talk about being uh made
[1:00:59] partakers of the divine nature of God,
[1:01:02] the very God. So, it's not just having
[1:01:05] faith, it's it's God's own faith. It's
[1:01:08] not just having love, a human love, but
[1:01:11] it's God's own love. God is love and and
[1:01:14] and these things. Ain't that right? So
[1:01:17] then uh uh we're we're heirs to this.
[1:01:20] Now when we when we talk of of of
[1:01:23] tutorship uh being under tutorship and
[1:01:26] conduct and all that you know a a lot of
[1:01:29] times we automatically seem to want to
[1:01:31] go to the rules of the church and a code
[1:01:35] of ethics and dos and don'ts and and and
[1:01:39] it goes back to legalism and what do I
[1:01:42] have to do what do I not have to do and
[1:01:44] and all of these things and then when we
[1:01:46] get you know we fail and we make a
[1:01:49] mistake or whatever ever. Then we think,
[1:01:51] "Oh, no. I'll never get adopted." And
[1:01:53] and now I got to go back to the
[1:01:55] beginning and start all over again and
[1:01:58] and all of these things. But, you know,
[1:02:00] I I don't believe that's what it's all
[1:02:02] about. God never wanted us to go in that
[1:02:04] direction. But I believe it is it is it
[1:02:08] is faith in God's word. It's when we can
[1:02:11] go through things and totally take God
[1:02:14] at his word and believe it regardless.
[1:02:18] Just believe it. Now, I know we're going
[1:02:20] through a lot of trials. I I know that.
[1:02:22] But but but you got to understand what
[1:02:24] God is is wanting. And what God is
[1:02:27] proving, he's proving our faith in his
[1:02:31] word. Now, he's already gave him the
[1:02:34] word. He's already He's already sent the
[1:02:36] tutor. The spirit of truth shall come.
[1:02:39] And and when that spirit of truth came,
[1:02:41] amen, and opened the book, God had a
[1:02:44] prophet upon the earth. Amen. because he
[1:02:46] does nothing except what he first
[1:02:48] reveals it to his servants to prophets.
[1:02:50] Ain't that right? Brother Brham said
[1:02:52] when that mighty angel come with an open
[1:02:54] book, the seventh angel would be on
[1:02:56] earth at the same time. Amen. And the
[1:02:58] and the mighty angel would hand that
[1:03:00] book, hand the revelation, hand that
[1:03:03] Amen. that open uh uh the mysteries,
[1:03:07] everything be given to that seventh
[1:03:09] angel. Amen. To reveal it to his people.
[1:03:12] Ain't that right? Amen. And now so so we
[1:03:15] don't need another message. We don't
[1:03:17] need another messenger. We don't need
[1:03:19] someone other prophet to rise up on the
[1:03:21] scene to lead us into the promised land.
[1:03:23] Amen. What we need Amen. Now, now God's
[1:03:27] already proven the word. God's already
[1:03:28] proven that this message is right. How
[1:03:30] many believes that? So the message is
[1:03:32] not on trial. Amen. If if someone's
[1:03:35] trying to put this message on trial,
[1:03:37] he's he's he's long gone. You you don't
[1:03:40] have to listen to that guy. Amen.
[1:03:41] Because the message has already been
[1:03:43] proven over and over and over and over
[1:03:46] that it's right. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:03:49] But what is on trial is our faith to
[1:03:52] whether we're going to take God at his
[1:03:54] word regardless of the situation and
[1:03:57] just take it at his word and say, "God,
[1:03:58] that's for me. I believe it regardless."
[1:04:01] Can you say amen? We're we're at that
[1:04:04] place that God that we're subjecting
[1:04:07] ourselves to the tutorship or to the
[1:04:10] word of God in faith. In faith. Can you
[1:04:14] say amen? You you can say, "Well, I I'm
[1:04:16] sure you know, I've you know, you can
[1:04:19] you can have your long hair. You can not
[1:04:21] wear your makeup. You can have the
[1:04:22] sleeves all the way down to your your
[1:04:24] fingertips, and you can have your skirts
[1:04:26] all the way down past your your your
[1:04:28] toes. and and and and we we could have
[1:04:31] uh you know, no beards and no no
[1:04:33] sideburns and no rings and we could have
[1:04:36] that all. It's it's already been done
[1:04:38] all down through the ages. Amen. But
[1:04:41] that's not subjecting yourself to the
[1:04:43] word. Amen. Cuz I've seen people do all
[1:04:46] that stuff and never have faith in the
[1:04:47] word of God. They doubt a prophet. They
[1:04:50] don't believe the prophet. And then then
[1:04:52] some of them will say, "Well, yes,
[1:04:53] Brother Bram's a prophet, but I don't
[1:04:55] have to believe everything he said."
[1:04:57] Amen. And then they try to correct the
[1:04:59] prophet and then they go this way and
[1:05:00] they go that way. See? So, so that's not
[1:05:03] what that's not what God's looking
[1:05:04] after. He's looking for somebody to take
[1:05:07] faith and in faith subject themselves to
[1:05:11] the word.
[1:05:13] Can you say amen? Got to subject
[1:05:15] ourselves to the word. Oh, do you love
[1:05:18] him? Amen. And so we find that Amen.
[1:05:23] that all
[1:05:25] uh then then we find that God wants us
[1:05:28] to believe his word. In Hebrews 6:17,
[1:05:31] Paul said we are heirs of promise. So
[1:05:34] we're not just heirs of God, but we are
[1:05:36] heirs of promise. So everything that God
[1:05:39] has promised, I'm an heir to. You are an
[1:05:42] heir to. It's his word. Ain't that
[1:05:44] right? Amen. See, we are heir to. His
[1:05:47] word is his promise. And and so then uh
[1:05:51] uh uh every every promise that God has
[1:05:54] made to us is in his written word. Do
[1:05:57] you believe that? Amen. Uh uh you know
[1:06:00] and and I'll just say I don't believe
[1:06:01] that brother Brandham preached anything
[1:06:03] outside this Bible. Now now you say,
[1:06:05] "Well, I don't see it verbatim." You may
[1:06:07] not see it, but you know what? We
[1:06:09] wouldn't have seen a lot of things if it
[1:06:10] hadn't been for a prophet. Amen. To take
[1:06:13] us back to the word of God. Amen. and
[1:06:15] began to point things in this Bible that
[1:06:18] we had no idea. Amen. And then we find
[1:06:21] out that these promises belong to us. We
[1:06:24] find out it's not just a book of
[1:06:26] history, but everything that they
[1:06:28] witnessed and they testified of and
[1:06:30] their life lived, it was testifying of
[1:06:33] not only Christ as the bridegroom, but
[1:06:35] of of Christ as the bride or as the
[1:06:38] bride. Well, we are part of Christ.
[1:06:40] Ain't that right? And so we we find that
[1:06:43] that his word is a word of promise. And
[1:06:46] it's in this written Bible uh uh written
[1:06:49] in the Bible. It tells us of God's plan.
[1:06:51] It tells us of God's will. Amen. It it
[1:06:54] tells us and and we find out that we've
[1:06:56] got an expected end. Do you believe
[1:06:58] that? That's that's what God says in in
[1:07:01] Jeremiah. I believe. Amen. I know the
[1:07:04] thoughts that I think of of you.
[1:07:05] Thoughts of peace and not of evil. So
[1:07:07] you'll never get God to think evil of
[1:07:09] you. Satan. I don't care what Satan
[1:07:12] does. He's the accuser of the brethren.
[1:07:14] But he cannot go so far as accusing you
[1:07:17] to where it gets God to change his mind
[1:07:19] about you. Amen. Satan is the accuser of
[1:07:22] the brethren, but it's already been
[1:07:24] written that God has thoughts of peace
[1:07:27] toward me and not of evil. And he's got
[1:07:30] already an expected end for me. Can you
[1:07:32] say amen? Well, that's what I'm heir to
[1:07:35] because it's written in the word. It's a
[1:07:37] promise that I am heir to. Can you say
[1:07:39] amen? I've got an expected end. Amen.
[1:07:43] And and I I looked up that word accuse
[1:07:45] because Satan is the accuser. And that
[1:07:48] word accuse means to charge with a fault
[1:07:51] and to blame. And and when you're
[1:07:54] looking at the flesh, he's got plenty.
[1:07:57] He's got plenty to to bring accusation
[1:08:00] about. Amen. But but there's a blood.
[1:08:05] God, he wanted sons and daughters. He
[1:08:08] wanted to return the kingdom back to the
[1:08:11] sons of God. Amen. And so he had to
[1:08:14] there's only one way he could do it. He
[1:08:16] created a a sea of forgetfulness which
[1:08:19] is the blood of God. Can you say amen?
[1:08:22] The blood of Jesus Christ is that sea of
[1:08:25] forgetfulness. Amen. And your sins are
[1:08:28] lost forever. There is no such things as
[1:08:31] sins when it's in the sea of
[1:08:33] forgetfulness. The blood. Brother
[1:08:35] Brandon says why? Because that blood is
[1:08:37] like a bleach. It breaks every power. It
[1:08:41] sends it back to where it came from. And
[1:08:44] now you stand justified.
[1:08:47] Well, aren't you glad for that? Amen.
[1:08:50] So,
[1:08:52] our final end is in the written word of
[1:08:54] God. Hallelujah. Amen. It's in the
[1:08:57] written word. And I uh had a quote and
[1:09:00] I'm going to read it if I can find it
[1:09:02] now and then I'm going to let you go cuz
[1:09:06] I know it's hot and uh my 5hour button
[1:09:11] can wait.
[1:09:16] Uh
[1:09:19] but I do want to if I can find it.
[1:09:25] Um because I I think it's important that
[1:09:29] we understand who we are and what we
[1:09:32] are. Can you say amen? And and I think
[1:09:35] this is um yeah, this is it. And and
[1:09:39] brother Brandham,
[1:09:41] I'm going to read you two quotes,
[1:09:45] but Brother Brandham says, "When Satan
[1:09:47] tempts us," everybody say, "When Satan
[1:09:49] tempts us,
[1:09:52] we are to resist him in a perfect
[1:09:55] faith."
[1:10:00] Can you say amen? Can't say, "Well,
[1:10:02] Satan, I spoke in tongues. Get thee
[1:10:05] behind me." Can't do that.
[1:10:08] You'll laugh at that.
[1:10:10] Well, I pay my tithes and offerings
[1:10:12] every Sunday. Can't Can't do that.
[1:10:15] Better not resist him that way.
[1:10:18] Well, I'm letting you know I've never
[1:10:21] walked into a barroom. You can't resist
[1:10:23] him that way. You got to resist him in a
[1:10:26] perfect faith in the word.
[1:10:30] Can you say amen? to where we're not
[1:10:32] questioning God's way, not questioning
[1:10:34] God's will, not questioning, we just
[1:10:36] believe it. If God said it, I just going
[1:10:38] to believe it. Ain't that right? Now,
[1:10:41] now I I I understand that, you know,
[1:10:46] resisting Satan with the perfect faith
[1:10:48] is is hard sometimes because you got to
[1:10:51] be sold out to this word. You you have
[1:10:52] got to be totally sold out and and you
[1:10:56] cannot you you cannot question as to
[1:10:59] say, well, how long is it going to take?
[1:11:01] How when when is the victory going to
[1:11:02] come? When is the when is the answer
[1:11:04] going to come? That is not up to us to
[1:11:07] decide that. God knows when he's going
[1:11:10] to answer. God knows that. But we've
[1:11:13] still got to resist with the perfect
[1:11:14] faith. Don't don't let Satan move us
[1:11:17] from it. Don't let Satan get us to
[1:11:19] question it. Don't let Satan get us to
[1:11:20] start doubting. Don't let Satan get us
[1:11:23] to start wondering when it's going to
[1:11:24] happen and and all of these things. If
[1:11:27] God said it, I believe it. You know, I
[1:11:30] and and I'm just going to tell off on
[1:11:32] myself, but you know, I was telling my
[1:11:33] wife the other day, I said, I just, you
[1:11:35] know, I I I'm just uh I I'm I'm just I'm
[1:11:40] a failure at everything. You know, I was
[1:11:41] really going through the mlly grubs and
[1:11:44] um and I said, I'm not a preacher. I'm
[1:11:46] not this and I'm not that, and I'm not
[1:11:48] that. and she just rolls her eyes. And
[1:11:51] but I I I got w got out of the room and
[1:11:55] I was walking down and just something
[1:11:57] came to me where brother Bren says, "The
[1:12:00] moment you say you're not saved is the
[1:12:02] moment you're not saved."
[1:12:05] And I thought, "Oh, I better watch my my
[1:12:08] mouth, huh?" And then I started just
[1:12:11] saying, "Well, I am saved. I am a
[1:12:13] Christian.
[1:12:15] I am victorious. I don't feel like it,
[1:12:18] but I am. Because I've got something to
[1:12:21] confess by. I Satan don't care about my
[1:12:25] feelings. God don't care about my
[1:12:27] feelings. If you understand what I'm
[1:12:29] saying. Other words, I cannot make a
[1:12:31] case to God and sit here at an altar and
[1:12:34] just cry and boo. I've just had so much
[1:12:36] trouble and I just had so much this and
[1:12:38] I Oh, you poor little thing. I'll help
[1:12:41] you out. That's not it. We've got to
[1:12:43] resist Satan by perfect faith. Now we've
[1:12:46] already got the perfect word. The
[1:12:48] perfect word has been restored. Right?
[1:12:50] So, so then the trial is is our faith.
[1:12:53] The trying of your faith workketh
[1:12:55] patience. Ain't that right? So he says
[1:12:58] when Satan tempts us, notice we are to
[1:13:00] resist him in a perfect faith in a
[1:13:03] perfect word. Now, who who else has to
[1:13:07] where you going to find a perfect word
[1:13:08] outside this message? You ain't going to
[1:13:10] do it. They want to pick it apart. They
[1:13:13] want to dissect it. But what they're
[1:13:14] doing, what ministers are doing is
[1:13:17] taking the perfect faith away from the
[1:13:19] people to where they don't have a leg to
[1:13:21] stand on. Because if brother Brandham is
[1:13:23] wrong here, then he must be wrong here
[1:13:26] somewhere else. And if he's wrong there,
[1:13:27] then where where am I going to really
[1:13:29] stand at? So you've got to stand with
[1:13:33] resist the devil. Amen. In a perfect
[1:13:35] faith, in a perfect word like Jesus did.
[1:13:40] Jesus resisted him because he had uh uh
[1:13:44] he had the word of the prophets.
[1:13:47] You believe that he had the prophets,
[1:13:49] amen, to rely upon. Amen. To know what
[1:13:53] he was. He took the scriptures, the same
[1:13:56] scriptures, the same book that we're
[1:13:58] looking at, the same promises. Amen. It
[1:14:01] was written in the scrolls at that time.
[1:14:04] Amen. But he could read about it and he
[1:14:06] could say, "That's me." by revelation,
[1:14:08] by faith, by perfect faith in that
[1:14:11] perfect word, he could take Isaiah's
[1:14:13] prophecy. He could take David's
[1:14:15] prophecy. He could take Ezekiel's
[1:14:17] prophecy. He could take Jeremiah's
[1:14:20] prophecy. He could take Moses's
[1:14:22] prophecies. Amen. And resist the devil
[1:14:24] by them.
[1:14:29] And this book has been open to us. Amen.
[1:14:33] Can you say amen? I I believe that. See?
[1:14:36] Amen. So, we're not sitting here
[1:14:38] wondering what our promises are. God has
[1:14:40] made sure we know. God has made known
[1:14:43] these promises for this bride. Now,
[1:14:46] we've got a perfect faith. We got to
[1:14:48] resist that devil. I I I can't help. If
[1:14:52] I could if I could keep the devil from
[1:14:53] coming from you and tempting you, I'd do
[1:14:55] that. But I ain't I can't. And God ain't
[1:14:58] going to do it. God wants you to resist
[1:15:00] him by perfect faith to show you to show
[1:15:04] him you're not like Eve.
[1:15:07] You're not going to sit there and let
[1:15:09] the devil run all over you and twist
[1:15:10] your mind up and get you away from the
[1:15:12] word of God. You're going to stand there
[1:15:15] and resist the devil in a perfect faith
[1:15:18] in a perfect word.
[1:15:22] He said, "The word of God is perfect,
[1:15:23] and we're to have perfect faith in this
[1:15:26] perfect word and resist Satan."
[1:15:30] Now, someone's dear brother was telling
[1:15:32] me the other day, he said, "Well,
[1:15:34] Brother Brham didn't have perfect faith
[1:15:37] and he didn't have perfect love."
[1:15:39] And I thought, "Oh, Lord,
[1:15:44] if he didn't have a perfect faith, where
[1:15:46] are you standing?"
[1:15:48] but you'll never find Brother Brandham,
[1:15:50] even though he had his faults and even
[1:15:52] though he had his ups and downs,
[1:15:54] even when he told his wife, I I'm not a
[1:15:56] preacher. I ain't, you know, and I'm not
[1:16:00] this. And he he had mully grubs. He He
[1:16:04] had times that he felt sorry for
[1:16:05] himself. There was a time that he told
[1:16:07] God, "You owe me. You owe me an
[1:16:09] explanation."
[1:16:12] Remember that? Telling God something. He
[1:16:14] said, "Boy, I really found out real
[1:16:16] fast. He don't owe me nothing. Amen. He
[1:16:19] said, "God, let me sit there on an
[1:16:20] island by myself."
[1:16:22] You don't let me think about that for a
[1:16:24] while. You know what I'm saying? But
[1:16:27] you'll never find Brother Brandham
[1:16:28] questioning the word of God. He had a
[1:16:31] perfect faith. And I believe he had a
[1:16:33] perfect love. I believe it was that type
[1:16:36] of love that subdued that bull that day.
[1:16:38] I believe it was that perfect love that
[1:16:40] subdued that that that them hornets.
[1:16:42] Amen. I can't explain everything, but
[1:16:45] all I know is I believe he had a perfect
[1:16:47] faith in the message that he brought to
[1:16:49] us. And we've got to have that same
[1:16:51] perfect faith. So he says, now I want
[1:16:55] you to listen. This is our last quote.
[1:16:58] Brother Brandham said, when you and the
[1:16:59] word becomes one,
[1:17:01] when you and the word becomes one, every
[1:17:03] promise, glory to God, every everybody
[1:17:06] say every every promise is yours.
[1:17:11] It oys you.
[1:17:15] So I say that again. When you and the
[1:17:17] word becomes one, how how how does this
[1:17:20] happen? Believing. Amen. Taking God at
[1:17:24] his word.
[1:17:26] Don't let nothing else have preeminence
[1:17:28] in your life but this. You say, "But oh,
[1:17:30] I've got so many faults that I've just I
[1:17:32] just don't know. I I just every time I
[1:17:35] take one step forward, I go backwards.
[1:17:38] Believe every word of God. Believe every
[1:17:41] word of God. Because you ain't gonna do
[1:17:42] it by worrying. You ain't gonna do it by
[1:17:45] griping. You ain't going to be able to
[1:17:47] do it by changing everybody. You ain't
[1:17:48] going to be able to by doing it by
[1:17:50] changing the church and changing, you
[1:17:52] know, the preacher, changing the
[1:17:53] deacons, changing your spouse, changing
[1:17:55] your children, changing every, you know,
[1:17:57] you can keep trying and trying and
[1:17:58] trying and trying. You can even keep
[1:18:00] trying to change yourself. It ain't
[1:18:01] going to work.
[1:18:03] But perfect faith in this perfect word
[1:18:05] will. So he says when you and the word
[1:18:08] becomes one, every promise, glory to
[1:18:10] God, every promise is yours. It obeys
[1:18:13] you. Now notice what he says. Then you
[1:18:17] want to watch what you want to do.
[1:18:21] Amen. Watch what you want to do. You
[1:18:24] wouldn't put your hand in a fire just to
[1:18:27] say, "See me do it." Oh, no. No. But if
[1:18:31] there's something in that fire and I got
[1:18:34] to reach that I've got to reach for it
[1:18:37] will obey me.
[1:18:39] That's right. See, so you want to watch
[1:18:43] what you're doing. Amen. Oh, we're not
[1:18:48] just doing it just to do it.
[1:18:50] But whatever you have need of and
[1:18:52] there's danger in the way,
[1:18:55] you can make it obey you.
[1:18:58] Can you say amen?
[1:19:00] You love him. This is where we're at
[1:19:03] today. This This is where we're at. I
[1:19:05] believe with all my heart. And if I can
[1:19:08] just encourage you, believe the word of
[1:19:09] God. Believe the word of God regardless
[1:19:14] if the musicians will come. You love the
[1:19:17] Lord.
[1:19:19] Amen.
[1:19:21] Now, um uh as they come,
[1:19:25] um I had mentioned we was going to have
[1:19:26] prayer meeting tomorrow. Uh but the way
[1:19:29] it is right now, we probably won't cuz
[1:19:33] it's hot. And so we'll have u uh we'll
[1:19:37] do the prayer meeting next Monday, the
[1:19:39] Lord willing. Amen. But uh do you love
[1:19:43] him?
[1:19:44] Amen. He's so good to us. Amen. And I uh
[1:19:50] but church, you got to believe that
[1:19:51] word. Amen. The the the things have been
[1:19:55] set before us. uh examples have been set
[1:19:58] before us. And you know, I I I think of,
[1:20:03] you know, like uh Noah,
[1:20:07] as far as I know,
[1:20:09] God only come to him once telling him
[1:20:12] that it was going to rain and gave him
[1:20:14] all of that, but then he had to wait 120
[1:20:16] years by faith. By faith. You know, the
[1:20:21] Bible doesn't say that he had
[1:20:22] visitations every day of an angel. It
[1:20:25] doesn't say that he, you know, he lived
[1:20:27] on the mountain tops and all that. Uh,
[1:20:30] uh, but by faith, 120 years, he preached
[1:20:33] the same message by faith. God didn't
[1:20:35] tell him when it was going to happen. He
[1:20:37] just said it's going to happen. And Noah
[1:20:39] was so so solid on that, so believed it
[1:20:42] that he just went around preaching. And
[1:20:44] he he was willing to be called a nut,
[1:20:49] willing to be cast out of society, ma
[1:20:52] made fun of and laughed at, but it
[1:20:54] didn't matter to him. He so believed
[1:20:56] God's word. And yet, he didn't even have
[1:20:59] that word proven to him before he could
[1:21:01] believe it. You know what I mean? He
[1:21:03] never saw rain himself. Just God said
[1:21:06] it's going to rain and he believed it.
[1:21:09] We've had the word. If you if you need
[1:21:11] healing in your body, you've got proof
[1:21:13] that God does that stuff.
[1:21:16] Whether it's cancer, whether it's
[1:21:18] Parkinson's, whether it's tuberculosis,
[1:21:20] whether it's a heart problem, whatever
[1:21:23] it is, we've got proof after proof after
[1:21:25] proof. We've seen God do it. You
[1:21:28] understand what I'm saying? But no, it
[1:21:29] didn't have no proof of rain. He didn't
[1:21:32] say, "God, can you give me a little
[1:21:34] sample
[1:21:35] of what it's going to be like, how it
[1:21:37] is,
[1:21:40] but he believed it." And 120 years, he
[1:21:44] preached it by faith. Abraham the same
[1:21:47] way. Abraham, you know, he was going to
[1:21:50] have a child. God said he was going to
[1:21:52] have a child. Never had it done before.
[1:21:55] That's right. Had a old man, an old
[1:21:57] woman going to have children. Never saw
[1:21:59] that. never never seen it done. But God
[1:22:02] said, "You're going to have it done.
[1:22:03] It's going to be done." He had to wait
[1:22:06] 25 years,
[1:22:08] but regardless, he believed. He
[1:22:11] believed. Can you say amen?
[1:22:14] Oh, why should I worry when trials can
[1:22:20] gi my name?

[1:39:24] maybe you're sick and you just ain't
[1:39:26] seeing anything happen. Oh, just start
[1:39:29] claiming them, claiming your
