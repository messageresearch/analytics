truly Lord that freedom is a wonderful wonderful thing we're not bound by the law of sin and death anymore spiritually but even the natural and that's the most important thing but even the M Natural Freedom and Lord I was thinking about those precious people Lord I don't know how many of them still alive trusted they all are the hostage are still there but tomorrow will be one year 365 days that they've been down in those tunnels and never even haven't even seen the sunlight the day the daytime T night they don't know if it's day they don't know if it's night and Lord it's just a you talk about bondage and what a what a horrible bondage uh that is and and knowing that death would Loom uh every day upon them but father the the worst prison I know of is to be in the prison of the denominational walls of unbelief and the what we were Lord in Lea but we're so thankful oh God how thankful we are that we've been released for those uh walls of bondage into the Glorious light of the truth and truly Lord As we sing them two songs of Freedom today we're thankful that we have been set free dear God we just praise your name for that praise the Lord you be with us we think about sister py she's been set free she was in bondage of pain and these things that she's suffered for days weeks and even years really Lord she's been set free in that theophany body there's no there's no bondage there but certainly has been made free and we're thankful for that be with the family encourage their hearts Lord for the not only the lost but thankful for the promotion of our dear sister

better to sing this morning than my favorite song here lately um my I was thinking sometime in the night just kind of came to me been a lot of hurt this week a lot of Devastation and yet um I don't think I've heard of any of God's people losing their lives in this in the in the flooding and all it I was thinking about brother Forton where I'm from we sit in the foothills of the mountains and the um powers that be say that we should have had worse flooding there and yet I think I think of that church sitting on the hill and I think of God's bride there and towns had to be destroyed and I'm so sorry heartbroken over it but towns had to be destroyed to protect God's bride in Rutherfordton North Carolina and that's simple but I believe with all my heart God protected his his children I do y'all sing it with me [Music] I've seen God's people Pray by a hospital bed I've seen them struggling for their daily bread see them at the grave of one who left us too young and I've heard them crying out for their wayward but I've never no never seen The rightous Forsaken seen them with tears in their eyes I've seen them with their hearts breaking I've seen them tested seen them tried seen them with their face Shake on but I never no never seen the rightous was [Music] forsaken no never seen the righteous forsaken seen him with tears in their eyes I've seen them with their face shaken I've seen them tested seen them try seen a with their face Shake on that I never no never see the righteous [Music] forsaken I've seen them when it seemed like there was no help Insight I've seen when it seemed that life was nothing but Bri but in the midst of Heaven something else was going on that may have been all by themselves but they were never [Music] alone Hallelujah no never seen the righteous forsaken I've seen them with tears in their eyes I've seen them with their face shun seen them tested seen them Tred seen them with their face shake up but I never know never seen the righteous [Music] forsake take it with me oh I never know never seen The rightous Forsaken I've seen them with tears in their eyes I've seen them with their hearts breaking I've seen them tested I've

certainly don't amen but uh it's certainly good to be here brother will sister hope it's just good to have you sister Becky good to have you I heard you finally got your electric turned on so this is good amen and uh they uh they got hit pretty hard uh down that way and uh but uh glad glad they're here this morning amen and that's that's all thank you but um certainly appreciate the musicians amen and uh they make us sound good amen but um um just good to have everyone in the house of the Lord and uh different ones are out of town and so we want to keep them in our prayer um uh we've got communion this evening and so we want to remember that at 4:30 and um I'm so glad brother Kevin is uh doing good recovering from that eye surgery and um but uh um also I don't know if it was mentioned this morning but we do want to pray for um sister Tanya Gordon and um she is you know she's really gone through so much and um she just buried her husband three months ago something like that two months ago but they found her daughter the other day uh deceased and and it's just uh you know it's she's buried her dad uh recently her brother then her husband and now her daughter and so I know I know she would really appreciate the prayer and then also uh I had met um a lady there actually had sister Psy's um uh a week or two ago just before sister paty went into the hospital U her name's Ethel Harvey but she's asked for prayer I saw her yesterday at the grave site and just asked uh for prayer and she's really went through a lot herself lost three children all within just one right after another then lost her husband and uh she's 80s some years old she just lost her brother um couple days ago well 10 11 days ago and uh sister paty actually had asked me uh to go see him uh while she was in the hospital and so I told her I would but uh before I could do that he had passed away and so anyway we want to keep her in our prayer uh just so many needs that are present you know um the family that was mentioned today that lost their husband and children lost their daddy tragic tragic thing that just happened yesterday and they're going to be very scarred and um they really really need our prayer and so we we want to keep them in our prayer and you know uh there's people that have lost their homes lost everything that they have lost their loved ones through this flood of last week and we just want to keep them in our prayer as well I think how blessed we are to be able to have what we have know what we know be able to come to church still our homes are intact everything that we have and yet people are suffering but um before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and um ask prayer for these needs Lord Jesus father I know that we uh had requests but these two maybe have not been mentioned Lord Ethel Harvey she's asking for prayer and Lord I don't even know where she is with you if she knows you at all but I pray that you'd be merciful to her here she's an elderly lady now and but Lord I remember your Prophet talking about the convert that he had won over to the Lord at 90 years old father I pray that you would show mercy and that you would just bring her into a greater relationship with you Lord I I just ask that you'd be with all those that are hurting Lord and suffering through these this flood that took place father be merciful to them and Lord if there's anything that they get out of this may may they see you in your reality may you draw them close may they look to you father for comfort for help Lord that they could trust you Lord is that's that's our prayer and sister Tanya uh Gordon Lord uh suffering lord of the loss of her child I pray that you would comfort her Lord and Lord may she just hold fast the Faith Lord knowing father that you've got it all in control you know all things father we pray Lord and I pray that you would bless the reading of your word the ministry Lord and help me just to yield myself to you father Lord for we're nothing without you we need you more today than we ever have father may you just work among us today Father meet every need that is present maybe someone watching online and they they've got needs father may you go to where they're at we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn first of all got a few scriptures here but first of all acts 1 and8 and um also um uh sister Britney uh reserved a place at a park nearby for next Sunday after the morning service for Fellowship so if you would um I'm sure she will um send out or whatever we're going to do um we may just go get something and just every each individual do what they want to do as far as food and then if you want to meet over there I'm sure it'll be enjoyable have some fellowship so uh but acts 1 and8 uh it says but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth then if you'll turn with me to uh uh The Book of John one John the first chapter and we're going to start at the 10th verse verse and read a few verses here it says he speaking of Jesus was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the of man but of God then turn with me John 15 um and we'll start at the first verse John 15 and one I am the Vine I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit um he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abide abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall everybody say it shall be done unto you ain't that right all right one more uh Luke 12 Luke 12 and uh we're going to start at the sixth verse so you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you um then of course we read where he said that unto them that received him to them gave he power if you abide in me my words abide in you you shall ask what you will so it surely doesn't give us a picture of a defeated Church ain't that right and then uh Luke 12 and um we're going to start at the sixth verse six and S are not five sparrows sold for two far thingss and not one of them is forgotten before God but even the very hairs of your head um are all numbered fear not therefore you are of more value than many sparrows can you sayen you can have your seats this morning I had uh was really really trying to get on another thought and um um concerning of the age that we're living in and and the world condition and things but uh it just uh it just wasn't happening and uh so yesterday I just like Lord I I need your help I I don't know why this is going just you know just something just wasn't I don't know how I guess you preachers know how that is you you you you're really trying to go One Direction and and and just you just something just not right and so um it just uh come on this uh today and I pray that it'll be a blessing but you know there are so so many things that are going on in the world today um that it can actually be overwhelming if you just look at it so much negative uh uh in in the land um and uh I I tell you Satan is working over time um you know um he's uh because he knows his time is up how many knows his time is up not your time but his time but he wants to make us think our time is up but his time is up and so he is working over time and people are left devastated whether it be by national events International or whether it be just be personal events uh Church events or whatever but they're they're left devastated confused worried broken frustrated um and it could be about the job it could be politics religion it it just don't matter it just seem like everybody's got a sad story to tell these days and uh um uh you know and if you know if we had a a uh confession you know I'm I'm sure all of us here could really give give some stories of what we were going through or been going through and um I'm sure then we'd try to top one of them off you know as as we go and um you know it's kind of like um one one uh they were having a testimony service in a Pentecostal church and uh everybody got to talking and one guy said well I just want to thank the Lord for saving me he said I was so bad that everybody every all my friends were scared of me you know and and um you know and then another one got up and well I was so bad that the town was scared of me you know and it was just getting really bad finally the pastor got up and say I got to fix this you know he goes well I'm going to tell y'all right now I was so bad even the devil was scared of me and so uh you know but but everybody uh we just so many things in the negative but I am I'm truly glad that uh we have a father that cares about us he he knows uh he cares for us and and he cares so much for us that he promised to never leave us nor forsake us but that he would be with us uh to the end of the age and he's promised to always be with us he he cares so much for us that that he predestinated us and and which that that truly means that you and I are secured if if you can believe that uh uh he's he secured us because in this predestination he he called us but not only called us he chose us not only did he choose us he justified us and not only did he justify us he glorified us so it's already taken care care of um you you haven't reached your glorification but but you know that it's already taken care of and that's where we're headed and that's what gives us hope in in a hopeless age uh when when there's nothing to believe in yet we believe in it because we we've been predestinated and if you don't believe in predestination I don't know how you going to have faith amen because that's just the way it is but uh uh we were pre-planned uh uh that's the only way he could have predestinated us as we were pre-planned uh so God's plan is not he's not just coming up with something as we go along it was already done before we ever come here and and so then as the prophet would tell us we are the premeditated thoughts of God and and so uh uh Ephesians 1 and4 according he as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will no one made him to do this this was out of the good pleasure of his will it pleased him to choose you it pleased him to predestinate you and and and and so and it pleased him to secure you it pleases him to be with you it it pleases him to go in the valley ales with you and and in your trials with you and in the darkest times of your life it pleases him to go with you amen and and um uh no one is making him do such and so brother brandham said God is true to his promise how many believes that God is true to his promise no matter what he has to do bankrupt the heavens he will before he would let his word go defeated he never made a promise that he cannot keep and this predestination is nothing but promises about your life he promised amen if if he Glory If he if he called you that's a promise if he chose you that's a promise if he justified you that's a promise if he glorified you that's a promise and he'll B bankrupt heaven to make sure that that promise comes to pass amen see so God prepared everything for us ahead of time he prepared this Earth because he knew that we were coming he he as as the prophet said he some like the valley some like mountains some like deserts some like whatever and he created this he prepared this for for us his children see amen and and so he prepared the Earth and and he he actually prepared our makeup our our way of of of what we are our being and What Makes Us tick he he prepared that Amen brother Bram said you were in God's thinking and he might have had to breed this with that and down here and down here like a man making Chimes for the church puts in so much brass and so much iron and he and and gets it just at the right pitch see the motor knows how to put it in if he doesn't then he doesn't get the right gream and sometimes we think that we're a mistake sometimes that we think oh uh I'm I'm just nut but just a a a flub and and a uh a a a failure no you're not God made you exactly the way you are so that he could get the right tune the right thing out of your life ain't that right now many many times we become a hindrance to the will of God uh uh and and that is uh because uh we get in the way of God but that does not mean that God made a mistake in how he made us see so we just have to fully surrender ourselves so that he can use us to what he uh deems best for our lives amen amen and and that is the truth so he prepares these things he's prepared a lamb for us he prepared an atonement for us he prepared the high priest for us uh to intercede uh uh for for our our sins and our confession he prepared healing for us he prepared deliverance and victory and and salvation for us and he's even prepared a city for us John didn't just see a city coming down he saw a city prepared amen for us can you say Amen he's prepared a place for us for he says I go away uh that that where I am you may be also and he say I go to prepare a place for you ain't that right amen so it it's it's all preparing God is already into our future and and he's already seen it and he's already working in our future future he's already and he's guiding us to where amen that he has prepared amen he prepared a way for us to go from the sand of the sea to to shining as stars of the heaven God prepared a way amen for that see because he cares for us if we could just get that into our hearts and and and really really uh uh be satisfied with his preparation for us and and ready that God knows everything about us amen he knows and he cares everything that we have need of was redeemed at Calvary amen Jesus Christ as we know paid the price of redemption and gave us everything that belongs to us now you think of that you before you could have made the decision before you could have said God I want it he's already prepared it he prepared it amen and and paid the price of redemption that that when Satan would come to you and tell you you're a nobody and and and that you'll never make it and you could look at Calvary and say but Satan the price was paid for and it was given to me at Calvary everything that Christ redeemed is mine and you don't belong and you have no right to it anymore amen you see Christianity is based on the finished works of Christ do you believe that it's not based upon on Promises of tomorrow it's based on the finished work of Christ amen that's what your Christianity is amen if you need salvation this morning you cannot be saved and and and you think of that now the brother brandom said that and that must have been a profound statement that morning when he said it that if you need salvation this morning you cannot be saved but he said look you would have to accept your salvation that was paid for you 1900 years ago see Jesus saved you when he died that's when you he saved you but you have to accept it when he knocks at your heart and then you accept your salvation can you say Amen how many's accepted your salvation I I've accepted what he done at Calvary amen see well then you accept your salvation you accept Jesus as your personal savior well that goes with healing if you need healing this morning you you can't get healed the only way you what you can do is you can accept your healing he's already healed you 2,000 years ago amen you you say well I need help well you can't get help this morning in in that way he's already done that amen if you need Deliverance he's already delivered you amen if you need it he's already done it it's your faith is based upon a finished work of Calvary amen God ain't doing anything right now he's already done it amen he's not making a way for your salvation he's already done it he's not making way for your deliverance he already done it he's not making a way for you to go in a Rapture he's already done it at Calvary it's the finished work can you say Amen you were healed at Calvary 1 Peter 2:22 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live under righteousness righteousness by whose Tripes ye were healed amen not a can continue you were healed were healed past tense can you say Amen see so every Redemptive blessing amen belongs to the believer already that's what he's done to prepare for us amen see so then faith is not based upon what God is going to do oh I've got faith in God well what faith are you having in God is it what he's going to do no it's not based upon what will happen or what is going to happen and all of these things it's based upon the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary amen that's where your Fai should be directed is at Calvary can you sayen Faith knows that I'm Healed well how would you know you're healed because at Calvary it was paid for amen I know I'm saved amen why do I know I'm saved because I look at Calvary it was paid for amen it was paid for brother Bram said Divine Healing is based upon the finished work of Jesus Christ at Calvary it's a finished work can you say that with me it's a finished work it's a finished work salvation is the same way you wasn't saved last week 40 years ago you were saved 1900 years ago when Jesus died at Calvary but you accepted your pardon so many years ago and so many nights ago and so forth amen the same way he was wounded for our transgressions with this strip we were healed it's a past tent you know I'm studying about Israel and the 144,000 and things and you know brother Brown said that God redeemed Israel at Calvary too he said the problem was they wouldn't accept their pardon they they wouldn't accept their pardon but he redeemed them just as much as he redeemed you at Calvary but here we are as Gentiles accepting our pardon and one of these days there'll be 144 Jews that will accept their pardon it isn't that Christ will die for them he's already already done it but now their eyes will come open and see the true atonement Christ the lamb but I'm so glad that we can see that atonement right now and accept everything that Christ has done for us a finished work yes sir brother Bram said see C the Judgment was paid all that God required was paid for at Calvary and when he died at Calvary he bowed his head as far as the Aton was made and everything that you've got need of in this journey from Earth to Glory it was already made ain't that right and he screamed it is finished amen it is finished that's what he said right it is finished he said see there can be nothing else added to it nothing else taken from it amen you can't add anything to to to what Calvary was and you can't take anything from it what Calvary was he said it is finished amen see the the plan of God is finished the Bible is finished the atonement is made the devil is defeated amen when was he defeated 2,000 years ago he was defeated in your life 2,000 years ago Amen brother BR said you're dealing with a defeated enemy that's all we're doing we're dealing with a defeated enemy and he nothing but a bluff the problem is we listen to his lies we listen to things that he tells us amen and he ain't got no power over us that's how much God cares if we can look get your eyes up and look at Calvary you can see what he's done for us God cares do you believe it amen it is finished in Hebrews 12:2 Paul tells us that Christ is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God you see if Jesus hadn't finished the job amen then the prophet said he would have not sat down he said no man sits down until his job is over amen but it was finished it was so finished that there was nothing else for God to do there was no acts of redemption left Amen to do at at Calvary it was finished so so he sat down at at at at the right hand brother Braham said see Jesus took his blood he went through the heavens of heaven and condemned every devil now you think of that that's what Jesus Jus done he condemned every devil amen not you the devil condemned you but Jesus didn't condemn you he condemned every devil every devil that bothers you Jesus is already condemned it's condemned he has no right he has no power he has no authority Jesus himself condemned him condemned every devil took the keys of death hell and sat down Lord to show us it's finished aren't you glad for that it's finished so notice when you become a Christian the prophet said God gives you a checkbook in there with Jesus name signed at the bottom of it for everything for everything everybody say everything come on now don't don't don't don't undermine what God has done cannot undermine the power of the Cross and the power of the blood that was shed amen because the blood was shed now he's invited you to come and he's handed you a checkbook amen he's telling you every promise that belongs to you amen you don't have to sit there and bargain with the devil you don't have to sit there and whine about it amen it's given to you sign he's already signed his name he's already signed his name at the bottom of it for anything that you've got need of while you're in life's journey are you afraid to cash it oh my don't be afraid to cash it amen don't don't be afraid to act a morning he said fill it out send it to the hel uh the helicopter head headquarters and see what God will do about it can you say amen amen fill it out fill it out amen and then send it back to the headquarters and see what God will do I guarantee you God will act upon it I believe that God will give it to you do you believe that God will give it to you you should never let your prayer be as oh oh God I hope you're going to do it I pray it will I don't know that ain't even a faith amen that if your faith is really amen anchored in true Faith it'll be anchored at the finished work of Calvary amen there's no guilt there is no condemnation there is no devil amen that can stand there and can accuse you amen before God Amen God has made a a way Amen to where you could come and ask amen with faith and he will do it Lord he cares and then Christ sent that back his Spirit as an Earnest of our inheritance in other words it is a down payment to let you know that your salvation is secure now it's becoming a personal thing for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son well that's fine amen but but now when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it's a personal assurance that he included you at Calvary can you say amen he secured your salvation he secured your destiny he secured your healing he secured your deliverance he secured your your Victory he secured everything that you have need of it's in the bank write the check you know people are usually applying raising the dead and Healing The Sick and C casting out devils and speaking in tongues and and all these things to the Bible days they say well that was in the days of the Bible I you may have talked to some of them that that that do that it's it was if that was in Jesus's day that was all in in that day but the prophet said but as long as the holy spirit is here we still live in the Bible days do you understand that you live in the Bible days what do you mean are we wearing robes are we wearing sandal oh no that's not it but the same God that was back there is the same God today if you need the dead raised he'll raise up the dead amen if you need the blind to see he'll he'll cause your eyes to come open if you need healing of arthritis of cancer of whatever it is that same God is here to heal you why because he's given you the earnest earnest can you say amen amen in in 2 Corinthians 6:10 Paul would tell us that we possess all things everybody say we possess all things I possess all things we're possessors of all things and and that word possess is to have to already have not want not looking forward to in the future but already have it amen see all things to hold as a as property to own not not renting not borrowing I own it see to have as an attribute to seize and take control of to take into one's own possession so then if we possess all things and we're in control of we own it amen then all things are ours it's it's ours even this Earth Is Ours do you believe that we possess this Earth we may not possess politics we may not possess the government of this Earth but we possess a kingdom that cannot be shaken we possess the Earth Jesus says the meek will shall possess uh inherit the Earth where we're possessors of it do you believe that so so see you may be poor but you're rich amen see why because we possess death hell the grave because Christ conquered it for us this is why Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 15:55 oh death where's thy sting see grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through Jesus Christ Our Lord see so then there's no grave powerful enough to keep our body down if we would go by the way of the Grave yet we are possessor of death we possess the grave the grave doesn't possess us death doesn't possess us we possess death can you say Amen amen this is why Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption Amen and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption this Mortal shall put have put on IM mortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory death you don't have to fear death you possess it you own it you rule it praise the Lord ain't that right then the prophet would tell us you not only possess things that are seen you possess things that are not seen amen you know in the beginning God wanted light yet there was no light to be seen no light to be had nothing visible to show that there was light but God being the possessor of things that are not seen he spoke it the Lord let there be light and he brought light out he created the light by his creative word ain't that right see he possessed it see and so just because things cannot be seen doesn't mean that they aren't there are you with me now I'm I I'm talking about you now just because things are not seen don't mean they can't be had don't mean that it's impossible do doesn't mean that it it's not there you possess things that cannot be seen ain't that right see you may not see Victory but you possess it it's there amen you may not see your healing but you possess it you may not see the Breakthrough that you want and that you're needing but you possess it can you say Amen you possess it that's why God would say ask anything in my name amen ask anything what do you mean ask things that I can see no ask things that you cannot see you don't have to live in in in defeat just because you cannot see Victory doesn't mean you can you have to live in defeat you possess things that cannot be seen ask God want a light the there was no light so he just quit gave up on his dreams it's impossible I can't have it I want it but I can't have it no he was possessor of things that cannot be seen can you say Amen you talking about the power of Calvary that when Calvary came he redeemed it to you he redeemed all things to you you think he would call you to be a Christian and then you live here a defeated life and just beat up by the devil and can't make it what a God that would be but when he redeemed you at Calvary he gave it all back to you things that are seen things that aren't seen can you say Amen now what right what right do we have to lay claim to the promises of God what right do we have to act as though we possess all things what right do we have to act like we're Kings we were born like Beggars ppers and now we act like kings prise the Lord that looks hypocrisy oh no not if you're a child of God not if your faith is based upon a finished work yes sir Calvary not only made you a church member Calvary not only saved you so you'd come to church and learn about God Calvary brought you to a place of kingship that you could act like God that you could speak like God that you can live like God see we possess a kingdom right how many believes we possess a kingdom through Calvary we possess a kingdom they talk about politic they talk about all this stuff it's a joke a j they really think they've got power but you got power you got more power than Angels Hallelujah you believe it you know they talk about these UFOs unidentified now we know what they are brother Ram said they're Angels investigating Angels but they they've taken pictures of these UFOs in in hurricanes in tornadoes and and one of them right in a hurricane in the middle of a hurricane the winds and everything blowing like crazy they say that that thing just stood there never moved never done one thing just stood right in the middle of all that wind of all that chaos and just stood there that was power that that was something that was Supernatural that has so baffled the human mind even the smartest men they don't know how that can do that and then disappear just like that with such speed that we don't even know about we can't even comprehend that type of speed and yet they can do that there's a supernatural so there they know there's a supernatural element there that they cannot explain but how much more Supernatural do you have to stay in the Hurricanes of life to stay in the turmoil of life and you're remaining exactly put with your faith in contact with your joy in contact with your convictions in intact amen and there the world don't know how to explain it I'll tell you what it is it's a supernatural God that is given you a power and authority that the world knows nothing of you possess a Kingdom can you sayen see now now look uh Revelations 1:6 it says he hath made us Kings and priest amen he hath made us then then Psalms 103 it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves so this isn't us this isn't a church making us this isn't a preacher this isn't some fleshly thing that is making us amen what we are God has made us Kings and Priests God has made us Sons and Daughters of God God has made us amen what we are not we ourselves not some denomination man-made Creed man-made idea politician whatever you want to call it Ephesians 2:10 notice what he says for we are his workmanship everybody say I am his workmanship amen I am his workmanship we are his workmanship notice cre aided in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them notice now we are created unto good works and have been ordained to walk in them not when we get to heaven not when everything is all Rosy and and not everything is going good and we're just it's all flowery and the sun is shining no God created you under good works and ordained you should walk in him when the sun is shining or when it's not when it's raining or when it's not when you're on the Mountaintop or when you're in the valley God ordained you that's a predestinated Act of God you realize that we were created for no other purpose now come on Church you was not created to be defeated you was not created to go in the valley and stay in that Valley you was not created to to Bear bring forth NE negative to have a negative testimony to have a negative life to have negative negative negative negative feed off the negative and live off the negative and be the negative you was not created to be powerless or to live defeated you wasn't created to live like Beggars talk like Beggars or to act like Beggars you were created to be Kings and Priests unto God for you are his workmanship created everybody say created oh my created unto good works now see now if you notice uh brother Brown said that Jesus put an emphasis on his own Works while here on Earth see Jesus here in John 14:11 he says believe me that I am in my father or I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake believe me for the works that I do so see he there was the work there see amen and in in John 10:32 Jesus says many good works have I showed you from my father many good works because Jesus was not without works amen see and and and and so brother brandom said now notice the works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him for it was a great part of his ministry amen not just sitting on a Pew not just saying amen not just preaching a little sermonette and not just but but good works amen he manifested The Works of the father he said the works that I do is not me but it's my father that dwells on me in me ain't that right so so he manifested the works good works see well we have been created unto good works can you say Amen see and this creation comes by the creative word of God and not by sex Blood by sex blood of your father is you're you're you're a nobody you're you're defeated you were born defeated you were born without Hope come on Church you were born in in the chicken yard you you were just born I mean it it you there was nothing about your first birth that was any positive about you at all ain't that right and you were condemned but we were created Created unto good works and it that creation did not come by sex blood but it come by the creative word of God can you say for what good works could come by sex blood amen you might be a genius you might get the world together and and and get it all well they're they're going to get a one world government and all these things amen and they call that good works but it's all bringing the wrath of God upon them can you say man so the good works that a man can do amen he he could he could give his arms and he could he could uh feed the poor and he could have charity functions and he could have missions and he could do everything uh well they're all doing it you got the movie stars you got uh uh well Trump and you got all kinds of people giving billions millions of dollars out here to all these things and that's fine amen but that's not the good works that Jesus is talking about amen you had to come amen through the blood to come into this good works we were created in Jesus Christ can you say Amen created in Jesus Christ unto good works now now now notice what brother BR said these Works were to inspire faith in him the works the works that we have been created unto was to is in to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him can you say Amen so so we can give arms to feed the poor we we can give things out out in the world and we can be involved in this and and in that and and and in this function and that function to help the the needy and then and that's that's just fine amen but them do not tie you Amen to relationship with the father but the works that Jesus did tithed him in relationship to the father can you say Amen for one place they said no man can do these things that you do we know that thou art a teacher from God we know you come from God you you have to be cuz no man can do the works that you do can you sayen well that's the good works that you have been created unto is to show amen give the people faith in him because it shows that there's a relationship between you and the father there's a lot of people going to church and living defeated lives Liv that's right can you say Amen but how do you show God in that a lot of people talking negative well you know how it is it's it's there but see these Works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul described as created in him now notice 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation old things everybody say old things are passed away my my old past is passed away my my I lived as a begar but that's passed away I acted as a begar but that's passed away I was a sinner but that's passed away I was a slave to the devil but that's P that was my old life that come through a sex blood but now I am a new creation in Christ Jesus and behold all things are become new right amen you know what that means leave your past behind that's right can't serve God and live in defeat can't serve God and living in bitterness with your past you got to you got to disconnect from the past whatever was in the past that's in the past I'm going to serve God can you say Amen you say well I don't know how to do it I'll tell you how to do it there's a Calvary that paid a price that the devil cannot defeat you Hallelujah he has no right to you anymore hallelujah it's the truth I thank God for Calvary sometime we just get in our mind that God doesn't care for us that is the biggest lie of the devil that's right amen is that the truth or not is that a is it a lie from the devil or not yesterday morning I woke up I I don't know it it's about 4:00 and man you talking about the devil bombarding me with all kinds of things I mean the future look Bleak my past look Bleak the present looks so dark and it just like there was no way out it was just like you just a big old failure and I'm in the dark you know laying in my bed trying to go to sleep and this is just running in my mind everything that's going on he's already got he was already painting my future how Bleak and how dark and what are you going to do and I was thought devil I've already been down that road before I listen to you once I ain't going to listen to you again so I got up I don't know about 5:00 yesterday morning I just started studying and this how I come up with this so if it ain't for you it's for me cuz I want the devil to know there's a finished work I'm part of that finished work and I don't care what he has to say I don't care how dark it gets he can paint the darkest picture to me I ain't going to believe it I'm going to accept my pardon I'm going to accept it on the basis of God's word on the basis of God's promise I am a new creature I am a new creation them ain't just words that is a reality he has no right over my soul he has no right over my thoughts he has no right over me I ain't a slave to that stupid devil now you can sit there and you can pity patter and you can you can cry in your tears and you can just sit there and let the devil beat you up till he ruined your life right and what he'll do is he'll get you to quit he'll get you to forget about God's blessings he'll forget about amen cause you to forget about amen God's future for your life you'll forget about how faithful you should be and what God has really done for you God has done so much for us he's done so much amen that's old things are passed away you know what that means that everything that the devil had on me is gone it's over and all things are become new brother Ram said even though man was of the old order or old creation we are not a new we are now a new creation in Union with Christ not a creation in Union with our parents brother BR said our sex blood has been dismissed whatever habits they had whatever uh uh uh uh things that come down that family tree it can be broken off it was broken off at Calvary I don't have to accept it you know how it is if you have little issues you go to the doctor and they'll ask you did your dad have it that's right did your mom have it and they want to search down that tree cuz they think oh yeah see if if they had it you got it you'll be acceptible to it and you know what the devil tells us oh yeah well if your dad had cancer you'll have cancer if your mom had cancer you have cancer you don't understand what I'm saying well Grandpa died of heart attack you know and dad got heart problem you're going to have heart problem no I ain't I don't have to have that well it's just the truth I don't have to have that my grandmother went as an enet into the grave as as just a little young lady I mean uh I I think there were still some children at at home and went into a wheelchair her her bones all twisted up and and and and just just her feet her toes everything just so de you know just Twisted I just remember crying and crying and crying that's all I knew really about my grandmother she just so in pain they they didn't have all this medicine that they have today for for arthritis and and these things you know but I remember I very remember it attacking my mother the same way and the devil kept telling her your mama had it you're going to have it you you got to have that you got to accept that and I remember waking up in the night's going to the bathroom and she's walking the floors in the middle of the night and saying Satan I rebuke you I will not claim this I will not take that amen why her faith was in the finished work of Calvary amen and that is the same way with you I know people are losing your their minds I know people are committing their suicide I know people are walking away from this message I know people amen are just giving up but you don't have to do that amen you are a new creation you are a new people you are by Blood Bought amen created in Christ Jesus for a victory and I say to you a total Victory total Victory you believe it yes sir now Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on a new man and I'll say it this way I remember my grandfather and I love my grandfather and he was just a a genuine good man but he a lot of hurts down the road because he was good to people he got beat up one time and and might have even been a couple times and and just one thing after another and finally he got bitter and that's that's what I remember of my grandpa just a bitter man and and I I remember one time I I I've watched my dad he was kicked out of church and several times a couple times out the Pastor's house and and uh oh just a lot of things that went on in the church and and they did not like my dad uh lot of a lot of some of the people in the church because they were attacking the pastor my dad stood with the pastor and and so Dad stood between them and the pastor and and they tried to sway him and he wouldn't be swayed and so they turned against him and and I remember all this stuff as as a preacher's kid amen and and I I remember my dad uh telling Mom one time and probably didn't even think I was listening amen but he said you know jene he said you know bitterness tries to gets a hold of my heart so much amen and and and tries to take me down and and I want to get so bitter toward people and so bitter but he says I remember my dad and and and what it did to him and how it affected him and and and he said jene I tell the devil every day I don't have to be that way I will not be bitter I will not give in to you can you say man there's a time that we stand and say I refuse to give into this Old Devil amen you're going to have your battles you're going to have your things but don't you give into it and I look at my dad and so many times bitterness has try to take over me and I tell the devil if Dad can do it I'll do it amen because I see my dad so full of love and so full of grace toward people and I say I refuse to be bitter I refuse amen by Jesus Christ I refuse why you don't have to accept it you don't have to live in defeat come on Church you were created in Christ Jesus under good works to where the devil don't have to destroy your life like he's done so many others amen now Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on the new man everybody say the new man new man which after God this new man is after God then the likeness of God is created in righteousness and true Holiness now notice what brother Bram said this new creation is not the old creation made over see it's not whitewashing the ouse it's not a a new creation uh not the new creation is not an old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is New Creation it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of Flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue uh through Godly Isaac uh line see but uh uh but now out of every kindered tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation oh God that's awesome Amen I hope that helps you amen God creating many sons amen and what he's doing is he's creating himself in you so another place brother brah said we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father see created in him to act like our father to talk like our father uh to to to live like our father well then our father is all powerful our Our Father Reigns over all our our father has supreme authority our father is is omniscient I he's om omnipotent and and and so when our father speaks everything bows and come subject to his word can you say Amen oh he cares amen he cares he didn't make you Christian enough just to sit in a Pew he went all the way to make you a new creation and what he's doing he's creating himself in you that you can be just like him that's truth can you say Amen so brother Braham said by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God this is the true revelation of God what is it Christ in you the hope of glory this was his purpose this purpose took form through election see that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will and by his omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass he hath made us possessor of all things Goden we're a new creation is this all right now notice Matthew 21 and 21 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you if you have faith and doubt not you shall not only do this which is done to the Fig Tree but also if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive is that right that's do that new creation see Matthew 18:18 verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for whether two where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in their midst can you say with me I am a new creation I'm a new creation amen that word speaks to me I he's not speaking to sex born children he's people he's speaking brother Bill to New Creation this is a new creation that they could take in their mortal lips the words of God and speak it and watch it come to pass don't dwell on the negative amen absolutely are you with me yes don't dwell on the negative negative I don't care what negative you've got going on in your life don't you dwell on it am that's good you start dwell on that negative Satan will get you to where you're justifying the way you act and way you feel before you know it you ain't even going to praise God anymore you ain't going to look at the promises anymore if he has his way you won't even pray no more if he has a real way you won't even be in the house of God no more yeah think about it oh my and then if he really has his way oh he'll get you to kill yourself it hello so brother Bram said your old life has to die everybody say my old life has to die and the new one has to be born again and then see you're no more the creature you was at all the devil has no more rights to me no wonder I stand Justified as though I never did it I'm not that creature that I used to be that's when you become uh come behind the blood fortified with the word don't try to explain nothing just believe it and go on just say Lord I believe savior raise my faith in thee till I can move a mountain I just believe it well Satan get you to reason well but look at what this and I don't care I just believe it I believe it I believe it everybody say I believe I now it's more than just saying I believe it you go home and you believe it you act like you believe it you live like you believe it you speak like you believe it believe that's right Hallelujah Romans 8:1 there there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus no condemnation to that new creation in Christ Jesus those that are created in Christ Jesus there's no condemnation to them that's true who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death now if you bear with me this creation that we're speaking of this new creation it comes by rebirth see 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed sex seed sex act see of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever ain't that right see so our new birth comes from an Incorruptible seed which is the word of God that's the part that's predestinated that's the part that will never change that's the part that God will bake up a bankrupt heaven to bring the pass that's right this other life's going to die and you say Amen so so by the word of God now brother Bram said we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed therefore we're reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken they can dance they can shout they can do whatever but there's nothing to Quicken but when the emotions are gone when your shouting is over and and and and your feeling is over and you don't feel like you're going to make it there is something down inside that's being quickened [Applause] right so God put a word seed Jean seed in us do you believe that I believe it's amazing brother Brandon did not preach about Jean seed did not even mention Jean seed until the I think the last six sermons of his life and then he's just a jean seed Jean seed Jean seed Jean seed Amen brother Ram said see inside of your spirit you've got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God another place the third Rim is is the soul you got your flesh spirit and then the Soul that's predestinated by God there is where the real G uh seed germ lays is in there now notice another place in God's own mind we are a germ of the gene of God we are so then the Soul is the real you that Soul that's been quickened Hallelujah hello amen now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you New Birth your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of the Lord I hope this is making sense to you in some way you're back everybody say I'm back I'm back I've arrived honey I'm home you're back to the original word of the Lord yeah before you got s you was just defeated Satan just let he you would just a slave that old stupid devil but that's not what the word of God called you to be you were so Laden down with sins and depression and you had no hope you live for this life prise the Lord but that wasn't what God called you to do down inside there was that c Gene and then it was quickened now that old life is gone and you've come back to the original word of the Lord Sons and Daughters of God how dare we live like or act like or talk like we're sons and say we're sons and then live below our privileges live as though we have no hope live as oh I've been changed I've been reborn and we live in the dumps and we live depressed and we live and the devil is infecting our lives till we ain't got nothing to live for about it Hallelujah come on now you're back to the original word everybody say I'm back to that original word now brother Bram says in another place we have become from Mortal beings from time beings to Eternal beings when the word of God lit our souls and we become Sons and Daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be Sons and Daughters of the Father God God in heaven crying Abba Father Can you say Amen so so listen we're not just Christians in the way the world thinks of a Christian and considers a Christian to be but we are Sons and Daughters of God which means we are part of God can you say Amen we are not trying to be sons of God right it's it's like the apple seed is not trying to produce the tree and trying to produce the apples it's already within it it has the authority to be what God called it to be there's a law of life within it it possesses life it possesses a certain nature it possesses a law and it just brings forth of its kind and we are of the same material like God we are of the same material as God is we are power of his power word of his word life of his life Romans 8:29 for whom he did for know them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say say to these things if God before us who can be against us if the situation is against us then then if God before us then there is no situation amen that is against us that can that can affect us can you say Amen now this Bible is prophetic do you believe that amen it's full of Prophecy uh second Peter 1:21 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy ghost now what is prophecy then prophecy is to foretell to forecast to call it before it happens so our life amen and I'm getting ready close now but our life was already foretold in the scriptures you you think that the Bible only spoke of of the tribulation and foret toed of of the heathens and for toad of judgment and for toad of you know uh whatever of the world condition The Way It Is Well it for told of all that but it also within all of this it for tells of you amen and you say Amen see so here we come now in this day not to try to be what was prophesied we ain't trying at all we're not trying to become Sons and Daughters of God we're not trying to be Christians we're not trying to be the manifestation of the sons of God we already are amen 1 John 3:2 beloved now we are the sons of God so then the word seed that predestinated Gene seed of God inside of us is now matching every prophecy that was spoke of in this Bible That's Right amen can you say amen I wish I could go on wished I had the time good preach but you can take a little apple seed just take the apple seed and if you know all about that a tree take a man that really knows apples trees and all that and knows everybody that he can take that apple seed and tell you what kind of apples it's going to produce what kind of bark is going to be on that tree he could probably tell you just the standard size of that tree and how it's going to be he could tell you all about that just by knowing what seed that is why because he's been able to study other ones just like it ain't that right now Church brother brandham there's a reason why brother brandham told stories in the Bible he constantly pulling up stories of this Bible amen why I believe God had him to do it so you would know what you're going to be praise the Lord right David slew his giant David slew The Lion and the bear Joshua spoke and called the son to stand still shamard took an ox gold and slew 600 Philistines I believe it was Yeah by himself amen Samson took the gates of a city when it was they were trapping him and he just took the gates of City off its hinges and walked up the hill with it ain't that right Samson took a Jawbone of a donkey and slew a thousand Philistines we could go on and on and on what does it tell us we're part of this that Jean seed that's in us we're part part of it am that's the way you're to be sister Brenda that's the way you're to be that's right sister Rihanna that's the way you're to be you're part of this thing I cannot say I cannot look at your life and say you're a defeated person I cannot say that that's not your future because you're part of what was in the book this is what your prophecy is God's called you ordained you to overcome your enemy God's called us to ordain he's or dained us to be this we can't be nothing else God showed us no matter how many Devils come no matter how strong the enemy was Samson took a thousand of them and defeated them how many spirits may be coming against you but you'll stand there because it's in your jean seat it's in there God look at Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell upon on them God planted a seed it was a Pentecostal Church a Pentecostal seed man look what they done they were so quickened by the Holy Ghost to where that Phillip he was preaching a meeting and then in the middle of that meeting was translated and was not found over there he was found over hundreds of miles away in another place so Quicken read the book of Acts not one devil could defeat them prise the lordes Paul and Silas they're Bound by preach from preaching the gospel beating their backs bloody and there they were in a prison bound but they began to sing songs of Deliverance and the angel of the Lord came in and eled them man you're part of that seedall you love him thank you Jesus if musicians will come hallelujah how great he is don't look at the negatives right you'll get depressed by looking at that that's right amen you'll quck God by looking at that you'll think there ain't even a god living by looking at all the negative think about that but you look at the promises and realize that's me that's right I am part of it can you lift your hands unto the Lord and just Love Him worship Him blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord oh Lord Jesus we love you how we thank you for your promises thank you for calling us out of this whole world

reason to keep your head down there's no reason to live defeated there's no reason to walk in misery I know this world's rough and I know you're facing challenges and I know you face disappointments and I know I do too we all go through these things but oh it never changes the fact that we're sons of God you remember what brother brandham talked about that slave that was taken from Africa and he was taken over here into America Amica as a slave and there he worked you know and and and finally someone come and he was want to buy some slaves and he looked at the owner of the slaves and he saw this this one man and his his back was bleeding just as much as the others but he had his shoulders squared his head high the smile on his face Standing Tall while the others was just bent down under the load and just oh just barely going but he he was different and that that man says I want to buy that guy yeah he says oh no you can't have him he said he ain't for sale he said well what makes him different from the rest of them he stand so tall he says do you feed him any different nope do you give him a better housing than it nope does he have a better lifestyle nope he's like with the rest of them amen he has to work hard just like the rest of them goes through everything just like the rest of them he said well what makes him different he said I you know I wondered about that too and I got to checking into it then I then I found out his history over there where he came from his father is a king of a tribe and he knows that he is the son of a king and just because he's in This Strange Land and he's under this this burdensome trials and all that he's not forgot that he's a son of a king he conducts himself like a son of a king he lives like a son of a King He Walks Like a son of a king he talks like a son of a king we couldn't break him we can't break him because he knows who he is in church that's the same way we know who we are we know know who we are we know what voices to listen to and what not to listen to and anything that is negative about your life and Satan's talking to you in a negative way you know that's of the devil and it's an ungodly thing and you cast that thing aside and say I'm a child of the king oh yeah but you fall and I don't care I got up and I'm a child of the king yeah but you just you're just running real low right now I don't care
