[44:05] you'd help me get myself out of the way
[44:07] and Lord that you could just use these
[44:11] mortal lips father and to speak your
[44:14] words of life to your people and pray
[44:17] Lord that you'd help the people to to
[44:20] understand Lord and Lord make your
[44:23] scriptures clear to us father Lord draw
[44:26] us closer as our prayer in Jesus
[44:30] Christ's name amen you can have your
[44:34] seats this
[44:36] evening and um I guess if I had a title
[44:39] be the second death has no power and
[44:42] we'll try to um not keep you long uh
[44:46] this evening but I do think it amazing
[44:49] how God shows his goodness to us and um
[44:54] he's all the time you know trying to
[44:57] show his love to us and his mercy and uh
[45:02] but here in the the first
[45:04] reading um there in in the second
[45:07] chapter of Revelations uh God is
[45:11] rewarding those who
[45:14] overcome and
[45:17] um I um I I think the um God is looking
[45:23] for Overcomers in this age and amen um
[45:27] the
[45:28] ones it's it's the Overcomers who who
[45:31] overcome the age that they live in and
[45:35] of course we realize that we're living
[45:37] in the Le odsan age so this is the age
[45:40] that we've got to
[45:41] overcome and and and this is the age of
[45:45] lukewarmness and so brother Ram said
[45:48] each son out of each Church age overcome
[45:52] the temptation of that age and so we we
[45:58] understand the temptation of the age is
[46:02] is lukewarmness to to keep us religious
[46:05] but yet um uh keep us without there's
[46:10] really the the power of God and and uh
[46:14] what God has for us but the Overcomer is
[46:18] the one who that God can put his hand
[46:22] upon as a witness in the Earth and and
[46:26] uh so then that that means that there we
[46:30] it's it's a challenge for us to come up
[46:33] higher than just being
[46:36] religious uh but that God could make us
[46:41] a witness uh here on in this leodys and
[46:45] age there has always been the prophet
[46:48] said an overcomer that's come out of
[46:50] each age God has always had a witness
[46:54] and and he still has his Witnesses today
[46:58] but it's been very few uh very few
[47:01] Overcomers um if you listen to the
[47:04] message how can I overcome the prophet
[47:07] talks about it and and there were like
[47:10] only eight Overcomers in Noah's day um
[47:14] and he said there's no doubt perhaps
[47:17] millions of people in that age and and
[47:20] you think of that millions of people but
[47:23] only eight Overcomers
[47:26] uh and he says they were genuine they
[47:28] they were eight real genuine
[47:32] Overcomers if you look in the days of of
[47:35] Daniel and um uh brother Brown said
[47:39] there was only four Overcomers in that
[47:42] age that could stand the test of fire
[47:44] and lion and of course the Bible says
[47:48] that he that cometh to God must first be
[47:50] tried it must be first must be tested
[47:54] and and for you young people to remember
[47:57] that that that there's always going to
[48:00] be testings and I buddy them them
[48:03] testings can be the can be
[48:06] hard um testings uh require us to have
[48:11] faith require us to Be steady require us
[48:14] to stay
[48:16] true uh because uh we don't have an
[48:19] infinite mind that we don't
[48:22] know uh we we can't we can't figure it
[48:25] out it's not like a math problem 4 + 4
[48:28] is 8 it's it's not like that but but it
[48:32] requires us to trust God that he knows
[48:35] what he's doing and so brother brandom
[48:38] says see that that only shows a true
[48:40] child then seed to be tested and when
[48:43] the test comes on you can't overcome
[48:47] unless there's a test given to you and
[48:49] when the test is given it's to see
[48:52] whether you can overcome or not and so
[48:55] God loves us and and God wants the best
[48:58] out of us but you see the war that is
[49:01] going on is Satan is bragging that he
[49:04] can take us out you know the story of
[49:06] job right uh Satan was bragging about
[49:10] job and and saying you know if you just
[49:12] take off the Hedge from him of course
[49:14] he's got it made he's got it easy but
[49:16] you you you just let me have him for a
[49:18] little bit and I'll get him to curse you
[49:20] to your face and uh and but God was
[49:24] bragging on Joel
[49:26] and he says yeah go right ahead and try
[49:28] it you know so God sent job through some
[49:31] trials but it it wasn't it and and of
[49:35] course it was Al it was definitely
[49:37] beneficial for job for for in the end he
[49:40] says I've heard of thee with the hearing
[49:41] of the year but now my I see a the so
[49:44] job received great Revelation in in
[49:47] during them times but it's it was in
[49:50] them times that he had to stay true to
[49:52] God and I mean his his friends were were
[49:56] criticizing him and saying it's all your
[49:58] fault and and his his wife even said you
[50:01] know what job give up man just curse God
[50:04] and die get it over with you know and
[50:06] and so those that were intimate around
[50:09] him uh uh uh was really the ones that
[50:13] was really putting him to the test and
[50:15] so to speak of course he lost his
[50:18] children he lost everything and and all
[50:20] of these things but uh but God was
[50:23] really just it was It was a battle not
[50:26] with job at all the Bible says that
[50:28] job's heart was perfect it it was
[50:31] between God and the devil and job just
[50:33] happened to be the guy that was picked
[50:36] and so um and and and actually God is
[50:40] the one that brought job's name up you
[50:42] know and so um uh anyways but James 1:12
[50:47] it says blessed is the man that endureth
[50:50] Temptation for when he is tried he shall
[50:53] receive the Crown of Life with which the
[50:55] Lord has promised to them that love him
[50:58] ain't that right so every Overcomer has
[51:01] to be put to the test and and uh the the
[51:04] the size of of of the Bride in Daniel's
[51:08] age if you want to call that or elect
[51:10] was four people uh uh that that was
[51:13] Daniel and and meach Shadrach and abedo
[51:17] and and yet the prophet said there was
[51:19] about 2 million people of the Jews uh
[51:23] there in in in
[51:26] uh captivity as well as the Ford but
[51:29] they're the only ones that overcome
[51:31] brother Brandon would even include uh in
[51:33] lot's day and how that there were only
[51:35] three Overcomers in lot's in lot's time
[51:39] uh uh that was lot and his daughters and
[51:42] and you remember Lot's wife started out
[51:45] right she she was leaving too uh but
[51:48] then she uh uh turned around and looked
[51:52] back and and and that's that's something
[51:55] that we we got to think about is that
[51:57] she made her choice to leave but after a
[52:00] little bit she couldn't stand it she had
[52:03] to look back and so um and and brother
[52:07] Bram said many of you have has left too
[52:10] many of youve uh left the things to take
[52:13] your stand after you search it through
[52:15] the scripture and find it's right you've
[52:18] seen the Vindication of almighty God not
[52:20] by some what somebody said uh but what
[52:23] was vindication see what the Bible said
[52:27] would be and here it is doing it you saw
[52:29] it was the truth so you set out to leave
[52:31] Sodom leave the denomination leave the
[52:34] things that bind you to a Creed and to
[52:36] follow Christ by the Holy Spirit
[52:38] vindicating himself by the written word
[52:40] of God other words you took the Bible
[52:43] instead of the Creed ain't that right
[52:45] but see it wasn't in her heart to leave
[52:48] she left but it wasn't in her heart to
[52:51] leave and so brother Brown said she
[52:53] still loved the world so it's possible
[52:56] he says that you can make a start and
[52:59] still be the world in you you can leave
[53:03] the world and yet the world still be in
[53:05] you see she never overcome and even
[53:09] though she was well on the road it
[53:12] finally overthrow her see she had to
[53:15] take that one big long last look and
[53:19] that's where she got caught so don't
[53:22] even look back don't have no desire
[53:26] keep going put your mind on Calvary and
[53:30] keep moving towards Christ can you say
[53:34] Amen you see that when you do start out
[53:37] and you and you're and you're starting
[53:38] to serve the Lord and and things the
[53:40] devil will always throw it into your
[53:43] facei of of what good is it doing you
[53:46] what what what rewards is there what
[53:49] what benefits is there what if what if
[53:52] you you you give your whole life to God
[53:54] and and then nothing uh uh uh transforms
[53:58] out of that but there's always some
[54:00] discouragement always something and
[54:03] that's why you can't have one ounce of
[54:05] the world in you so keep moving keep
[54:09] your mind on Calvary and moving towards
[54:12] Christ out of the two and a half million
[54:15] people that left Egypt there was only
[54:17] two Overcomers out of that group and
[54:20] that was Joshua and Caleb and and we
[54:22] know they all saw the works of God they
[54:24] all saw the manifestation of the spirit
[54:27] they all saw the mighty Miracles that
[54:29] was done in Egypt and things and so they
[54:33] all started out but the prophet said it
[54:35] just wasn't in their heart Amen to to to
[54:39] move on and and so they didn't overcome
[54:42] and they perished in the wilderness and
[54:44] and so the testings and the trials uh uh
[54:48] there to show really what's really down
[54:51] deep in our heart I if if if serving the
[54:54] lord If the message message if if what
[54:56] we say is true is it really down into
[54:58] our hearts can you say Amen in John the
[55:01] Baptist age brother Ram said there was
[55:03] only six Overcomers uh in in that age
[55:07] and yet the rest of them offered their
[55:09] sacrifices and they done their Duty uh
[55:13] as as what they were but the ones that
[55:16] overcome these six they were the elected
[55:19] uh that was called by God and and so it
[55:22] it is such a blessedness
[55:25] uh to be Overcomers in this age as as
[55:28] you can read through the history
[55:30] Biblical history and you see of
[55:32] Overcomers that that stood the test you
[55:35] read the the fox's book of Martyrs and
[55:38] and how through them Dark Ages there
[55:39] were Overcomers that that that that they
[55:42] were willing to give everything that
[55:44] they got even the parents seeing their
[55:47] their their children suffer and and be
[55:50] torn apart and burned and and all of
[55:52] that just to try to get the mom and dad
[55:55] to recant and yet they wouldn't recant
[55:57] and and and uh uh them themselves being
[56:02] uh uh fled alive and and tortured and
[56:05] burned to the steak and and uh fed to
[56:08] the Lions but they were
[56:10] Overcomers amen they they did not want
[56:13] to go back and and yet they had just a
[56:16] little bit of of light amen they didn't
[56:18] have the light that we have today and so
[56:21] when you see that they had overcome
[56:23] young people overcome and and and adults
[56:26] overcome and everybody that had claim
[56:29] well we are it's our turn it's this is
[56:33] the greatest age of overcoming than ever
[56:37] before do you realize that amen God
[56:41] would pick you for the hardest age the
[56:44] greatest age to overcome amen this is
[56:47] the age uh that is increased with goods
[56:50] and thinks that she has need of nothing
[56:53] and yet the Bible says that she's
[56:54] wretched blind miserable and naked and
[56:57] knoweth it
[56:59] not notice what brother brandham called
[57:01] this age he says this lazy loose happy
[57:04] gol lucky joking sinful age of lust that
[57:08] we're living in now it's a wonder that
[57:11] God just doesn't say step back church
[57:13] I'll just liquidate the whole group what
[57:16] an age that we're living in and he will
[57:19] do that one of these days too we know
[57:21] it's coming there isn't to be no sparing
[57:24] to this because he's already someone
[57:26] died for those who wanted to escape but
[57:29] he'll take those who was or who has
[57:31] accepted Christ and become Christians
[57:34] and he'll they'll be taken out of the
[57:36] Wrath aren't you glad for that amen but
[57:39] notice this lazy loose happy go lucky
[57:43] joking sinful age of lust well see
[57:47] that's the age that we have to overcome
[57:50] ain't that right uh uh uh that's the age
[57:54] brother said there's more sin in this
[57:57] age that has ever been and the powers of
[58:00] Satan is many times harder to fight
[58:05] against than it was in any age right
[58:08] here the powers of Satan is harder to
[58:11] fight against than any other age but
[58:14] there is an overcomer that's going to
[58:18] overcome aren't you glad for that amen
[58:22] so uh uh it's harder uh and and here
[58:26] Jesus talks about in Luke uh
[58:29] 11:24 when the unclean spirit is gone
[58:31] out of a man he walketh through Dry
[58:34] places uh seeking rest and finding none
[58:38] and he saith I will return unto my house
[58:41] when I came out and when he find when he
[58:43] cometh he findeth it swept and garnished
[58:46] then he goeth he and taketh to him seven
[58:49] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[58:53] and they enter in and dwell there and
[58:56] the last state of that man is worse than
[58:59] the first and so this explains uh uh why
[59:03] we are fighting the hardest battle in
[59:06] this age than ever before uh it's it's
[59:10] because the enemy has come Amen in the
[59:13] name of a church it's it's so deceiving
[59:16] and and it's the greatest deception uh
[59:19] and and Matthew
[59:21] 24:24 it says for there shall arise
[59:24] false Christ and false prophets and show
[59:26] show signs great signs and wonders in so
[59:29] much that if it were possible they shall
[59:31] deceive the very elect ain't that right
[59:34] and and so this is the age that that
[59:37] it's in all of the evil that's been
[59:40] through every age is wind up in this age
[59:43] right here amen and and so uh uh brother
[59:48] brandom said people uh can live a clean
[59:52] life a holy life not not be sinful
[59:56] adulterers drinkers liars and gamblers
[59:59] in other words not be any of that and
[1:00:01] they can live above that and still not
[1:00:04] with it ain't that right and then he
[1:00:07] says this is the age of personal life of
[1:00:12] Jesus Christ ain't that right so if
[1:00:15] there's ever a time that that we've got
[1:00:18] to overcome and keep in the Life of
[1:00:22] Christ it is now amen don't let nothing
[1:00:27] take the life from you don't let nothing
[1:00:30] take the spirit of God from you ain't
[1:00:33] that right do whatever you can to to
[1:00:36] keep on the fire in line is is basically
[1:00:40] it and keep in the spirit of God ain't
[1:00:42] that right and so uh uh but but
[1:00:46] overcoming is something that God does
[1:00:48] not take lightly uh uh for he rewards
[1:00:53] those that over overcome and he rewards
[1:00:56] them the best that he can give them if
[1:01:00] if there was anything greater that God
[1:01:02] could give he would have given it but he
[1:01:05] rewards you as an overcomer with the
[1:01:08] best he could give you think of that
[1:01:12] amen and so for him to reward his elect
[1:01:15] by them not being part of the second
[1:01:19] death is a blessing and a comfort to us
[1:01:23] amen it's it's a comfort and and so uh
[1:01:27] even though this was uh partaking or or
[1:01:30] a promise of Ages of an age before the
[1:01:33] Le osia yet we can take comfort as as a
[1:01:38] as the last age we can take comfort
[1:01:41] knowing that this promise is also to us
[1:01:44] who overcome in this age amen because uh
[1:01:49] brother Brandon would say now le osia
[1:01:51] that's the last age there's going to be
[1:01:53] some Overcomers in there he said watch
[1:01:56] Che says they remember each age uh uh
[1:01:59] each Church age the one preceding it
[1:02:02] inherits all that the other ones offered
[1:02:06] ain't that right so us being the last
[1:02:09] Church Age We inherit as Overcomers all
[1:02:14] the rewards amen that was given to the
[1:02:17] previous ages ain't that right and and
[1:02:20] so not being part of the second death
[1:02:23] what a reward now now death uh it we
[1:02:28] know that death represents uh is
[1:02:32] separation and and so some people may
[1:02:35] think that death is just a physical
[1:02:38] thing where a person separates from
[1:02:40] their loved ones and and and well that
[1:02:44] that is death to where that when your
[1:02:47] loved one dies you can't you can't go
[1:02:49] where they're at you can't talk to them
[1:02:51] you can't see them you can't you know uh
[1:02:54] you can't hear their voice and you can't
[1:02:56] have that fellowship and and and death
[1:02:59] has separated them from us who are still
[1:03:02] alive and and if if you've ever had that
[1:03:05] experience of losing a loved one uh uh
[1:03:09] it it it it really brings a uh real
[1:03:13] meaning of what death does and so uh but
[1:03:17] second Corinthians 5:6 Paul would tell
[1:03:20] us that we are confident I say and
[1:03:22] willing rather to be absent from from
[1:03:24] the body and to be present with the Lord
[1:03:27] so absent death physical death takes us
[1:03:30] from our physical body but it doesn't do
[1:03:33] away with us as as an individual uh for
[1:03:37] he says to be absent from the body is to
[1:03:39] be present with the Lord even the
[1:03:42] prophet goes beyond the curtain of time
[1:03:44] and he sees people who had once lived on
[1:03:48] Earth that was separated from their
[1:03:50] loved ones here on Earth but yet the
[1:03:52] prophet saw them in another body and and
[1:03:56] and they were Fully Alive ain't that
[1:03:58] right amen so they were in a body but
[1:04:01] they were not in the one that they had
[1:04:03] here on this Earth amen so we we could
[1:04:07] call that kind of a death maybe the
[1:04:09] first death uh because the Bible talks
[1:04:12] about the second death amen and and so
[1:04:15] we we would call that the first death
[1:04:17] maybe uh uh but but the second death is
[1:04:20] a spiritual death which is a separation
[1:04:24] as well and and John 10 and 10 Jesus
[1:04:28] says for the the thief cometh not but
[1:04:31] for to steal and to kill and to destroy
[1:04:35] but I am come that they may have life
[1:04:39] not physical life but but spiritual life
[1:04:43] and that they might have it more
[1:04:46] abundantly ain't that right so then he
[1:04:49] that overcomes will not be part of that
[1:04:52] spiritual death it it there will be no
[1:04:56] separation now the second death is the
[1:04:59] death of the soul and and um you know we
[1:05:04] we today we see that spiritual death is
[1:05:06] on in the land today upon people uh uh
[1:05:10] and and and yet they're living uh um uh
[1:05:13] in the physical real in their body
[1:05:16] natural life but spiritual life is gone
[1:05:20] and and 1 Timothy 5:6 she that liveth in
[1:05:24] pleasure is dead while she liveth ain't
[1:05:27] that right so you see The Sinner is
[1:05:30] separated from God there there is no
[1:05:33] Fellowship there is no conscience of God
[1:05:36] there is no friendship with God there is
[1:05:39] there there is yo yeah they they learn
[1:05:41] about God but that's not what we're
[1:05:43] talking about we're talking about
[1:05:45] intimate relationship with God and and
[1:05:48] that soul is separated from God uh uh
[1:05:52] you know brother brandom says this I
[1:05:53] love lovely young woman she may be
[1:05:55] pretty and she'll dress up really nice
[1:05:57] and go down the street and the boys will
[1:06:00] whistle at her and she'll twist her
[1:06:02] shoulders and giggle and smoke her
[1:06:04] cigarettes and she thinks that's living
[1:06:06] but the truth of it is it's death see
[1:06:10] it's life to the flesh but it's death to
[1:06:13] the spirit and the Soul see so so so
[1:06:16] people think that this is life and and
[1:06:19] yes you are living and and yet but the
[1:06:23] the greatest life would be eternal life
[1:06:26] can you say amen and and even though we
[1:06:29] weep at a at at the first death that we
[1:06:32] would call First death and and a
[1:06:33] separation from our loved ones and and
[1:06:36] that is horrible but the greatest thing
[1:06:38] that would be horrible is that be
[1:06:40] separated from God our creator to to
[1:06:44] where that we would live in this life we
[1:06:46] would we would be able to touch we'd be
[1:06:48] able to talk we'd be able but we'd have
[1:06:50] no conscience I could have conscience of
[1:06:52] you but we'd have no cons ience of God
[1:06:55] Amen be because we're separated sin
[1:06:58] separates that individual from being
[1:07:00] conscience and the fellowship with God
[1:07:03] can you say amen amen but but the the
[1:07:05] life of this world that people think is
[1:07:07] life and yet brother Brown says this
[1:07:10] death people are so miserable in this
[1:07:12] life have you ever just thought of it
[1:07:14] living in the Sin and oh yes they they
[1:07:16] could have money they could have riches
[1:07:18] they could have anything that they want
[1:07:20] and they're so
[1:07:22] miserable uh uh to where that that men
[1:07:25] take a gun and blow their brains out and
[1:07:28] and and try to end their life in such uh
[1:07:31] horrible ways because it's a life that
[1:07:34] that is death it's it it's because when
[1:07:37] a man is separated from his creator and
[1:07:41] and from that Fellowship there's a
[1:07:43] longing there's a misery there is a a a
[1:07:47] uh uh whatever you wanted to call it but
[1:07:49] you you couldn't call that kind of life
[1:07:52] you know that uh uh uh uh uh a life that
[1:07:55] David was speaking of uh it's it's a
[1:07:58] perverted life it's a life that the
[1:08:01] devil is trying to have you to live can
[1:08:03] you say amen amen see uh and so uh uh uh
[1:08:08] we we find here that that Romans 6 and
[1:08:11] 23 for the wages of sin is death amen uh
[1:08:16] Ezekiel 18 and20 the soul that sinth it
[1:08:21] shall die ain't that right so in other
[1:08:24] words that the the soul shall be
[1:08:26] completely separate to where it will be
[1:08:29] no more it'll be totally annihilated
[1:08:32] ain't that right and and and so but but
[1:08:35] think of it how many people are living
[1:08:37] today uh uh in the physical amen but God
[1:08:41] can't get to that Soul amen can't get to
[1:08:45] that Soul it see it's it's a separation
[1:08:48] out out of fellowship with God and I I
[1:08:51] thought of the the uh uh brother Bram
[1:08:54] talking about that girl that that you
[1:08:56] know was sitting in the back of the
[1:08:58] preacher's daughter I think pastor's
[1:09:00] daughter and he he was preaching and and
[1:09:02] at the end gave the altar call and he
[1:09:04] told that lady girl he said it's your
[1:09:05] last night you need to come to the Altar
[1:09:07] and of course she didn't and met him
[1:09:09] outside after church and said don't ever
[1:09:11] talk to me like that again don't
[1:09:12] embarrass me like that and and and and
[1:09:15] so they got to talk in there and and and
[1:09:18] he left her and and saw her I think a
[1:09:20] year later or sometime after and there
[1:09:22] she was smoking a cigarette hair all
[1:09:24] messed up and more just disheveled and
[1:09:27] and and things and and and he he she saw
[1:09:30] him and and and and she said hey preach
[1:09:33] you know and so he stopped to talk to
[1:09:35] her and he says you know she said you
[1:09:36] know you you well he off she offered him
[1:09:38] a cigarette and he says no ma'am I don't
[1:09:40] want that and he says how could she how
[1:09:42] dare she offer a minister a cigarette
[1:09:44] and and so he he says you know you
[1:09:47] you're right preacher that that night
[1:09:49] says you you were right says God was
[1:09:51] calling for you know and and says you
[1:09:53] know wife I'm uh she says you know in in
[1:09:56] the conversation she say I can see my
[1:09:58] mother soul in hell and frying and and
[1:10:01] she's I just laugh about it you know and
[1:10:03] he says see that just shows that she
[1:10:05] went too far but God couldn't reach that
[1:10:07] Soul God God it was a separation you
[1:10:11] understand what I'm
[1:10:12] saying you know uh uh the the real
[1:10:15] saying true gospel you know when when a
[1:10:18] person is separated and and if you
[1:10:21] notice brother Brandon says the real
[1:10:22] true same God gopel can't even reach
[1:10:24] them even though they are religious yet
[1:10:29] religious but yet having no fellowship
[1:10:32] with God uh no peace no no no Comfort it
[1:10:36] it it's it's it's this second death is
[1:10:39] is is is a powerful thing uh brother
[1:10:42] brand talked about that lady who
[1:10:44] attended a famous Church most of you
[1:10:45] know it and and you know uh uh she sung
[1:10:49] in the choir and and things and and
[1:10:51] brother Brandon says I always doubt Ed
[1:10:54] uh of her Christian experience of being
[1:10:56] born again yet she was a good moral
[1:10:59] woman and and as far as she knew but she
[1:11:03] was married got married to a boy named
[1:11:05] John and and you know after a while uh
[1:11:09] John uh moved to a bigger city or
[1:11:12] whatever because of uh uh work uh for a
[1:11:16] better job and things and so uh the the
[1:11:19] the church that they started to attend
[1:11:23] uh was wasn't as spiritual as the one
[1:11:25] that she went to and and her I think it
[1:11:28] was her uncle that pastored the first
[1:11:30] church but she moved they moved to
[1:11:32] another one and this woman you know
[1:11:34] began to get mixed up in with other
[1:11:36] women and and started to copy after them
[1:11:39] and impersonating them and and and
[1:11:41] things and brother Brown said that's
[1:11:42] that's what's the matter with our
[1:11:44] country today with our churches one's
[1:11:46] trying to copy after the other and they
[1:11:49] sat with their head in the televisions
[1:11:51] and things and trying to impersonate or
[1:11:53] copy after some filthy thing they saw on
[1:11:56] television and then bring it into the
[1:11:58] Church of the Living God and sainted
[1:12:00] women and men do the same thing or claim
[1:12:02] to be sainted you you see and and and
[1:12:05] and I'll say it this way this is one of
[1:12:07] the reasons why people can't go on with
[1:12:09] God is because they're too busy
[1:12:12] wondering what everybody else is doing
[1:12:13] and trying to copy what everybody young
[1:12:16] people do not copy after other young
[1:12:18] people get your own experience with God
[1:12:22] Amen because even your friends even
[1:12:24] being raised in messes churches that
[1:12:26] does not mean that they have an
[1:12:27] experience with God make sure that you
[1:12:30] have your own identity with Christ and
[1:12:34] not worrying about everybody else what
[1:12:36] everybody else is doing sometimes you
[1:12:39] just got to stand alone on your own two
[1:12:42] feet with your own convictions and no
[1:12:45] matter what everybody else says and it's
[1:12:47] in them times that maybe you don't even
[1:12:49] feel God but but God is bragging on you
[1:12:53] you and he's looking for an overcomer
[1:12:56] you remember God's not going to Baby
[1:12:59] everybody he's not going to Baby
[1:13:02] us well it's true amen it's not parental
[1:13:06] love that God loves us with its elective
[1:13:09] love and and so therefore uh uh you you
[1:13:13] can't you can't get into what what this
[1:13:16] one's doing and what's that one doing
[1:13:18] and and looking around to where you
[1:13:20] forget what God wants you to be be be
[1:13:23] one that God can call you out of and
[1:13:26] stand and be identified as a witness for
[1:13:29] God Amen see so you can't mix oil and
[1:13:33] water together because it won't work
[1:13:35] brother brandom says how are you going
[1:13:36] to believe the supernatural how are you
[1:13:38] going to get anywhere when you're
[1:13:39] mingling with the world ain't that right
[1:13:42] so so another place the Bible says if
[1:13:44] you love the world or the things of the
[1:13:46] world the love of God's Not in you now
[1:13:49] that may rub just a little bit but it'll
[1:13:51] do you good think of it he said said
[1:13:53] brother we got to meet Christ in
[1:13:55] judgment someday woe unto the man who
[1:13:57] will stand behind the pulpit and use his
[1:13:59] influence to flatter some people instead
[1:14:01] of preach the gospel like God said to do
[1:14:04] it got to be told the truth and that's
[1:14:06] what we need today is more of the truth
[1:14:08] bring brought out in its light ain't
[1:14:11] that right and and so uh uh uh uh this
[1:14:15] woman you know being around these other
[1:14:17] and trying to be like everybody else and
[1:14:19] tried to fit in with the crowd and and
[1:14:21] whatever see I I I think that's why the
[1:14:24] devil gives us complexes and especially
[1:14:26] you young people having complexes but
[1:14:28] but even adults get complexes and and
[1:14:31] and because you want to fit in you want
[1:14:33] to be accepted you you you you you you
[1:14:36] you want to be able to rub shoulders and
[1:14:38] be liked and be this and be that but see
[1:14:41] you you God's called you for a purpose
[1:14:45] and and and Satan will put them
[1:14:46] complexes on you and and and try to get
[1:14:49] you bound up Amen to where you're so
[1:14:52] afraid of what what your friends are
[1:14:54] going to say and what they're going to
[1:14:55] think about you and all of that but you
[1:14:57] can't worry about that just stand with
[1:15:00] God and overcome the age that you're
[1:15:04] living in so this woman started wearing
[1:15:06] the Scandal clothes and shorts and got
[1:15:09] getting out there and mowing the yard
[1:15:11] with them and and uh you know her dad
[1:15:14] rebuked her and the others did as well
[1:15:16] and but she thought she was good as the
[1:15:18] rest of them then she started smoking
[1:15:20] and then she started doing other things
[1:15:22] that were wrong and and then after a
[1:15:25] while some slickster come along and and
[1:15:27] begin to swoo her while her husband's at
[1:15:29] work and things like that and and we all
[1:15:32] know this the story he was married to
[1:15:33] another woman and and then convinced her
[1:15:36] to run away with him and so she she ran
[1:15:40] left John and went with this guy and and
[1:15:43] and you know uh brother Brown said you
[1:15:46] know the first thing they'd get back
[1:15:47] there and she'd put on her little
[1:15:48] clothes move the yard when he'd come in
[1:15:51] and he you know what he brother Brown
[1:15:53] says what you wearing them for not to
[1:15:54] appear before God but to appear before
[1:15:56] men ain't that right amen women put on
[1:15:59] them sexy clothes not not for God they
[1:16:02] they they doing that for men amen but
[1:16:05] you know so anyways uh uh uh they get
[1:16:09] they ran off they get married and before
[1:16:10] you know it he leaves her and goes to
[1:16:12] for another woman and and it just once
[1:16:15] one thing and after another and after
[1:16:17] another and it just begin to compile and
[1:16:20] and she kept all this time kept playing
[1:16:22] the piano in the church and and and
[1:16:25] things like that and so she ended up
[1:16:27] living with a common law husband and and
[1:16:30] uh uh I believe it was brother Neville
[1:16:33] you know or some minister went over and
[1:16:35] talked to her and trying to woo her and
[1:16:38] she you know uh to bring her back call
[1:16:40] her back and she says hey I'm all right
[1:16:42] I'm just as good as anybody you know and
[1:16:45] and these things and so one day she
[1:16:47] ended up with cancer and and the doctor
[1:16:50] told her says I've done all that I can
[1:16:52] do for you you know and and uh you're
[1:16:54] going to die get you know prepare for
[1:16:57] death and things like that so brother
[1:16:59] Neville actually went to go see her in
[1:17:02] in the hospital and thought you know if
[1:17:03] I could just get her to surrender to
[1:17:05] Christ then you know I maybe I can get
[1:17:08] brother brandom to come over and pray
[1:17:09] for and things like that and and so a
[1:17:12] servant of God went over there and she
[1:17:14] just baled him out and and uh uh she let
[1:17:18] him know that she didn't sin for him
[1:17:20] didn't want him there and uh said I'm
[1:17:23] just as good as you are and and yet you
[1:17:26] know she was smoking cigarettes right
[1:17:28] after another and all that and yet
[1:17:29] claiming to be saved and and things like
[1:17:31] that see and brother brandom he he says
[1:17:34] now why why why would she act like that
[1:17:37] what was it brother BR said this she
[1:17:39] grieved the holy spirit away from her
[1:17:43] she grieved the holy spirit away from
[1:17:45] her and so this is what the Bible again
[1:17:49] says the soul that sinth or the soul
[1:17:52] that disbel believes that Soul shall die
[1:17:56] or separate can you say amen and so uh
[1:18:00] uh uh you know th this is the comfort
[1:18:03] that the Overcomer has is because if we
[1:18:07] would be separated from one another in
[1:18:09] death amen we may be a we may do that
[1:18:12] death may come for us every one of us uh
[1:18:15] or some of us or one of us to where that
[1:18:18] God takes us home and we're separated
[1:18:20] from each other but one hope that we
[1:18:22] have
[1:18:23] is that we'll never be separated from
[1:18:26] our God can you say amen and and see the
[1:18:30] soul has separated from her and the soul
[1:18:33] is in her heart and and the pro you know
[1:18:36] well the Bible says you believe from the
[1:18:37] heart ain't that right so when the soul
[1:18:40] separates and and then the heart can't
[1:18:43] believe it it has nothing to believe
[1:18:46] with and brother BR says see people
[1:18:48] don't get religion in their head by a
[1:18:50] book knowledge you get religion in the
[1:18:53] Heart by an experience in the heart and
[1:18:54] the heart will always agree with the
[1:18:57] Bible but the head will reason ain't
[1:18:59] that right the devil works in the mind
[1:19:02] and he says now he says see her mind
[1:19:05] would tell her now it's reasonable if
[1:19:07] these women can do it then why can't I
[1:19:09] see they're called Christians they have
[1:19:11] good standing in the church they're good
[1:19:13] standing in the community so why can't I
[1:19:16] be that see I'm a Christian like they
[1:19:18] are and if they can do that then it's
[1:19:20] reasonable that I should be able to do
[1:19:22] it too
[1:19:23] and because then I'll be one of them if
[1:19:25] I don't they'll think I'm an old fogy if
[1:19:27] I don't do this then they'll think I'm
[1:19:29] better than they are ain't that right of
[1:19:31] course we don't want to be better than
[1:19:32] other people right and so then we got to
[1:19:34] lower our standards a little bit so we
[1:19:36] fit into the crowd so we'll be accepted
[1:19:38] we got to have a good testimony anyway
[1:19:40] after all amen ain't that right and if I
[1:19:42] just live a little bit above them
[1:19:43] they'll reject me they'll think I'm a
[1:19:45] little goofy and a little funny and all
[1:19:46] that and then I can't win souls that way
[1:19:49] right see it's all the reasoning
[1:19:51] reasoning reasoning and and all these
[1:19:53] things see and he says that's reasoning
[1:19:56] I'll get uh you know it'll get you in
[1:19:58] bad every time no matter what your
[1:20:00] intellectual knowledge tells you don't
[1:20:02] you believe it if it's contrary to the
[1:20:05] word of God ain't that right take thus
[1:20:08] sayeth the Lord first stay with that no
[1:20:12] matter and your soul will always agree
[1:20:16] with that word that's right ain't that
[1:20:19] right see so what is it then that's the
[1:20:21] Overcomer the Overcomer is agreeing with
[1:20:24] the word of God rejecting the reasoning
[1:20:26] rejecting everything and just staying
[1:20:29] right with the word of God you can love
[1:20:31] people and stand with the word of God
[1:20:33] Amen oh yeah they'll say you're hateful
[1:20:35] and you're being you're being too rigid
[1:20:37] you're being too judgmental all that
[1:20:39] just stay with the word of God can you
[1:20:41] say Amen the sign that you do love
[1:20:43] people is the sign that you'll tell them
[1:20:45] where they're wrong the sign you do love
[1:20:47] people is not just going around putting
[1:20:48] your arms around making everybody feel
[1:20:50] comfortable amen and oh you're okay and
[1:20:53] you're okay we support you whatever you
[1:20:54] do that ain't love amen that that's a
[1:20:57] that's a a perverted love that sends
[1:20:59] people to Hell amen but if you really
[1:21:02] love people you'll stand for what's
[1:21:03] right you'll tell the truth regardless
[1:21:06] of what happens amen though the world
[1:21:08] forsake me I'll still follow Christ amen
[1:21:12] that's the greatest love that you can
[1:21:13] give a person is when you stand for the
[1:21:15] truth let your light shine and in their
[1:21:18] darkness and they're sailing the Seas of
[1:21:20] life and they're about to shipwreck
[1:21:22] hopefully they'll look to you as the
[1:21:23] lighthouse and see that there is a truth
[1:21:26] in this thing can you say amen and that
[1:21:28] you can lead them back to
[1:21:31] truth you ain't leading them to Truth by
[1:21:34] patting them on the back all the
[1:21:36] time so brother Brown said her pastor
[1:21:39] come down there and he seemed to think
[1:21:41] that she was all right so her brother
[1:21:43] drove you know from the house and went
[1:21:45] on her thinking she was right on she had
[1:21:47] intellectual faith and she said I
[1:21:50] believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:21:51] God I've accepted him years ago my
[1:21:53] personal savior she said I can play in
[1:21:56] in the church I have my places in
[1:21:58] society I'm just as good as anybody else
[1:22:00] and my pastor he says brother Neville
[1:22:03] said well but what about this common law
[1:22:05] husband and she said the same's door o
[1:22:07] the same doors open that you come in at
[1:22:10] and he left and he says you know I want
[1:22:12] to bring brother brandom over and she
[1:22:14] said I don't want to see him and he went
[1:22:16] on back and the only thing he could do
[1:22:17] see and brother said to me said what
[1:22:19] about that brother brandom I said watch
[1:22:21] her at the in be sure that you're
[1:22:24] standing near her when her time comes to
[1:22:26] leave here so she went on a few months
[1:22:28] and kept getting worse finally
[1:22:30] hospitalized her and one day when all of
[1:22:32] them was standing around and she was
[1:22:34] going out to meet God all at once when
[1:22:36] this intellectual begin to break in here
[1:22:39] see remember your mind is controlled by
[1:22:41] your brain and your nerves and blood and
[1:22:44] whenever those human elements fail to
[1:22:45] function this brain here the
[1:22:47] intellectuals began to break and when it
[1:22:50] began to break she realized this soul
[1:22:52] that sinned that disbelieved and cast
[1:22:56] off to one side began to catch up with
[1:22:58] her and when she seen that coming she
[1:23:00] cried out oh I'm lost can you say amen
[1:23:04] and the Pastor said now here here here
[1:23:06] you're getting beside yourself she said
[1:23:08] don't speak to me he said don't you
[1:23:11] speak to me you're lost she says I'm
[1:23:13] lost and they went and got the doctor
[1:23:15] and she got beside herself they gave her
[1:23:17] a hypo and they shot a Hyo and she and
[1:23:20] and she I'm lost I'm lost I'm going to H
[1:23:22] and they said give her another and they
[1:23:23] kept giving her a hypo until finally her
[1:23:26] breath faded out screaming I'm lost I'm
[1:23:28] lost he said see the hypo stop this
[1:23:31] confession with these lips and when the
[1:23:33] intellectual was breaking but that soul
[1:23:36] that had sinned before God she'll have
[1:23:38] to live with it throughout all ages to
[1:23:41] come can you sayen so what a a a time
[1:23:45] what would it would be to be separated
[1:23:48] amen uh uh from God you you can have all
[1:23:51] your college you you can have all your
[1:23:53] education you can have all the wealth
[1:23:55] that you want but remember all of that
[1:23:57] comes to an end to one of these days
[1:23:59] everything comes to an end I I you know
[1:24:02] and and you just forgive me I hope it's
[1:24:04] all right but I I was just talking to my
[1:24:06] wife and you know I got to think about
[1:24:08] brother Brandon when he says I you know
[1:24:10] what if I had I think it was 10,000
[1:24:12] years to live without God 10,000 years
[1:24:15] to have anything I wanted on this world
[1:24:18] but at the end of the 10,000 years I'm
[1:24:20] done it's over with you know and and but
[1:24:24] said then you know if if I had what what
[1:24:26] did he say have nothing but yet have
[1:24:28] Christ and no you know he said I choose
[1:24:30] that more than than than anything else
[1:24:32] you know and I thought well you know I
[1:24:34] was telling my wife the other day just
[1:24:35] so struck me what if we chose that what
[1:24:38] if we chose that and and we've only got
[1:24:40] one month left of the 10,000 years one
[1:24:43] month left what do we do next there'd be
[1:24:46] nothing you understand what I'm saying
[1:24:48] no hope whatsoever it's it's over so the
[1:24:50] 10,000 years of of all the wealth all
[1:24:54] the things that you want in this world
[1:24:55] do anything you want no parents to tell
[1:24:57] you no preacher no nothing no no laws
[1:25:00] nothing you just get anything you want
[1:25:02] it's yours and yet at the end of them
[1:25:05] 10,000 years you've done it all these
[1:25:07] years and then you got a day to live
[1:25:10] what
[1:25:11] next all of that would be
[1:25:15] nothing when considering to live
[1:25:17] eternally with
[1:25:20] God now this is what we have made the
[1:25:22] choice is is we we have we we we could
[1:25:26] live it up we could have anything that
[1:25:28] we want we we could be whatever but we
[1:25:30] have made the choice as an overcomer
[1:25:32] we're going to overcome we're going to
[1:25:34] overcome can you say amen and God's
[1:25:36] promised this now listen in your deepest
[1:25:39] trials in your hardest times in the
[1:25:42] times when it seems all hell is breaking
[1:25:44] loose there is a promise that you'll not
[1:25:47] be part of the second death keep
[1:25:49] standing for God keep standing true for
[1:25:52] this message keep pressing on and sin or
[1:25:56] or Satan will never be able to separate
[1:25:59] you I don't care how hard the trial is
[1:26:01] amen the trial could not separate God
[1:26:04] from job and job from God he could not
[1:26:07] separate Satan could not separate that
[1:26:09] Faith from God Satan could not separate
[1:26:11] that relationship with God Satan could
[1:26:14] not separate God Amen from getting to
[1:26:17] job and giving him a revelation I see uh
[1:26:20] uh what is it uh I shall see My Redeemer
[1:26:23] even though the skin worms eat this body
[1:26:25] yet in my flesh I'll see my redeemer why
[1:26:28] because sin could not separate job from
[1:26:31] his creator ain't that right amen and
[1:26:34] there is a people on this earth that is
[1:26:36] overcoming that is enduring and no
[1:26:39] matter how hot it gets and no matter how
[1:26:41] alone they feel and no matter how
[1:26:43] wretched it may be and no matter how
[1:26:45] poor they are amen God still has keeping
[1:26:48] a relationship with him amen and staying
[1:26:51] with him and they keeping that intimate
[1:26:54] relationship oh do you love him second
[1:26:58] Peter 7:10 it says Godly sorrow now
[1:27:00] listen Godly sorrow worketh repentance
[1:27:03] to Salvation not to be repented do amen
[1:27:07] but sorrow of the world worketh
[1:27:11] death separation right so brother Brown
[1:27:15] said she she could go to church and act
[1:27:17] like a saint and that don't have one
[1:27:19] thing to do with it but she's dead while
[1:27:22] she's living look what the denominations
[1:27:24] has done for her they made her a Handler
[1:27:27] of the holy word which is contrary to
[1:27:29] the Bible they made her a preacher it's
[1:27:31] forbidden of the scripture even makes
[1:27:33] her now become ruler mayor Governors
[1:27:36] everything in the country and a minister
[1:27:38] in the house of God when she's guilty of
[1:27:40] every sin that's ever committed she is
[1:27:42] the cause of it right see now I'm not
[1:27:45] I'm he says I'm not speaking of Rights
[1:27:47] he said but she is guilty she is the one
[1:27:49] that caused every baby to be born blind
[1:27:51] she is the one that caused every grave
[1:27:53] to be dug she is the one that caused sin
[1:27:55] sickness sorrow an ambulance can't ring
[1:27:57] unless a woman caused it no crime can be
[1:27:59] done no sin no death no sorrow no
[1:28:01] suffering but a woman done it and God
[1:28:02] forbids her to go to the pulpit to
[1:28:04] preach but they yet they do it anyway
[1:28:06] see amen he says and what is it it's
[1:28:09] denomination that's that's what it is
[1:28:11] but to those who overcome amen shall the
[1:28:15] second death shall have no power over
[1:28:18] them I I I think it's worth overcoming
[1:28:21] don't you amen you see there is a
[1:28:23] spiritual drought amen that is going on
[1:28:26] throughout the land today and the thing
[1:28:29] brother Braham said that has caused it
[1:28:31] is sin and unbelief by false teachers
[1:28:33] and modernists in the church had brought
[1:28:36] the place to this coming on uh coming
[1:28:39] judgment they have turned from God's
[1:28:41] word and his prophit to a modern
[1:28:43] theological terms of the word and and so
[1:28:46] whenever there's a drought death follows
[1:28:49] it ain't that right when there's a
[1:28:51] drought death follows when there's a
[1:28:53] famine F death follows see and and so
[1:28:56] we're in a in a time that the prophet uh
[1:28:59] uh Amos I think that that that that
[1:29:02] talked about a famine in the land and
[1:29:04] and and uh not for bread or water but
[1:29:06] for hearing of the word so so that means
[1:29:09] that if there's the famine then there's
[1:29:11] death that's going to come and and we're
[1:29:13] seeing that today death is all over the
[1:29:16] place spiritual death is taking place
[1:29:19] but yet through it all God has promised
[1:29:21] the over Comer amen uh reward ain't that
[1:29:25] right now notice in the drought uh uh
[1:29:28] second uh Revelations 2 and 17 to him
[1:29:31] that overcometh everybody say to him
[1:29:33] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[1:29:38] the Hidden
[1:29:39] Mana Hallelujah in the drought there's
[1:29:42] going to be a hidden mana and and what
[1:29:44] is the hidden Mana it's the revealed
[1:29:46] word ain't that right it's the revealed
[1:29:49] word now Matthew 4:4 man shall not live
[1:29:51] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:29:54] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:29:56] famine will not come to that man that
[1:29:59] eats of the word the revealed word ain't
[1:30:01] that right so notice the hidden Mana is
[1:30:04] what the Overcomer through every age has
[1:30:07] fed on Amen uh the hidden mana and this
[1:30:11] message is the hidden Mana for the
[1:30:14] Overcomer of this age do you believe
[1:30:17] that Amen in the drought God has
[1:30:19] promised the Overcomer you will not part
[1:30:22] of the second death amen why because God
[1:30:25] has provided a hidden Mana a hidden Mana
[1:30:29] it's hidden from everyone else but he's
[1:30:31] reserved it he's got this Mana for his
[1:30:34] elect in this
[1:30:37] age in the time of spiritual death
[1:30:40] caused by spiritual drought the life of
[1:30:42] the Overcomer is sustained he shall not
[1:30:45] be part of the second death ain't that
[1:30:47] right amen so the Overcomer is the man
[1:30:50] that perfectly overcomes the prophet
[1:30:52] said the man that really sits down and
[1:30:54] throw aside throws aside everything else
[1:30:56] besides the word amen see so in closing
[1:31:00] the religious people today are like Esau
[1:31:03] he traded the birthright for a mess of
[1:31:05] pottage and brother Brown says Esau
[1:31:08] morally was a better man than Jacob but
[1:31:10] he didn't have respects to his
[1:31:11] Birthright which was the word see uh uh
[1:31:16] the word his the Covenant right the
[1:31:18] promise amen so how many knows that the
[1:31:20] birth Rights was the word the promise
[1:31:22] the Elder son but he was a good man a
[1:31:25] moral man like the nominal Christian
[1:31:27] today a good man he didn't lie he didn't
[1:31:29] steal he was a good to his daddy he done
[1:31:32] all these things but you see his
[1:31:34] Birthright see he said he didn't care
[1:31:36] about that what difference does that
[1:31:38] make I'm an Israelite anyhow I belong to
[1:31:40] it anyhow but it was his birth rights
[1:31:42] that counted his natural was all right
[1:31:46] but his spiritual was all wrong ain't
[1:31:48] that right see so his natural was all
[1:31:51] all right naturally he was a good man he
[1:31:53] was a daddy's boy and he was a great
[1:31:56] Hunter he was moral he was honest he
[1:31:58] didn't cheat didn't lie didn't steal
[1:32:01] naturally he was good but spiritually he
[1:32:04] was all wrong ain't that right see so
[1:32:07] it's spiritual death now notice as as
[1:32:10] again as we get ready close 1
[1:32:12] Corinthians 15:54 Paul said so when this
[1:32:15] corruptible shall have put on
[1:32:17] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[1:32:19] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:32:21] to pass the say that is written death is
[1:32:24] swallowed up in Victory aren't you glad
[1:32:28] for that death is swallowed up in
[1:32:32] Victory amen hallelujah I just love the
[1:32:35] Lord I just you know I believe that this
[1:32:37] is applicable not applicable not only to
[1:32:40] the physical but to the death to the
[1:32:42] spiritual as well death is swallowed up
[1:32:45] second Corinthians 1:9 it says but we
[1:32:49] had the sentence of death in ourselves
[1:32:51] that we should not trust in ourselves
[1:32:54] but in God which raiseth the Dead who
[1:32:57] delivered us from so great a death and
[1:33:00] doth deliver in whom we trust that he
[1:33:03] will yet Deliver Us can you say Amen if
[1:33:06] he has delivered our soul from Death
[1:33:08] then can we not believe him that he will
[1:33:11] raise this old body up even though it's
[1:33:13] in ashes and even though it's gone into
[1:33:15] dust and even though it's just nothing
[1:33:17] but a spoonful of dust amen God will
[1:33:20] raise this up again amen and we will
[1:33:23] live eternally before
[1:33:26] him notice second Timothy 1 and9 it says
[1:33:30] who has saved us and called us with an
[1:33:33] holy calling not according to our works
[1:33:36] but according to his own purpose and
[1:33:38] Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:33:41] before the world began but is now made
[1:33:43] manifest by the appearing of Our Lord
[1:33:46] Our Savior Jesus Christ who has
[1:33:48] abolished death aren't you glad he
[1:33:50] abolished death who did he do it for for
[1:33:53] you the elect amen the Overcomer he
[1:33:56] abolished death and hath brought life
[1:33:59] and immortality to light through the
[1:34:02] gospel when did he bring life and
[1:34:05] immortality to light in this age a
[1:34:08] prophet stepped over beyond the C
[1:34:09] curtain of time and he began to let us
[1:34:12] know what it's all about can you say
[1:34:13] Amen aren't you glad for that amen
[1:34:16] Revelations 1:7 when I saw him I fell at
[1:34:20] his feet as dead and he laid his right
[1:34:22] hand upon me saying unto me fear not
[1:34:25] amen fear not elect fear not Overcomer I
[1:34:29] am the first and I am the last I am he
[1:34:32] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:34:35] alive forever more amen and have the
[1:34:38] keys of hell and of death church he
[1:34:42] holds the power to sustain life aren't
[1:34:47] you glad for that do you love him if the
[1:34:50] musicians will come
