[46:36] key might be be FL SE somewhere in there

[46:50] discomfort to remind us of our
[46:54] needs whenever we're track it in words

[1:01:49] iav that thou mayest see as many as I
[1:01:54] love I rebuke and chasen be zealous

[1:02:07] and will s with him and he with me to
[1:02:12] him that
[1:02:13] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[1:02:15] in my
[1:02:17] throne even as I also overcame and and
[1:02:20] sat down with my father in his throne he
[1:02:25] that hath ear let him hear what the
[1:02:28] spirit sath to the church amen then um
[1:02:34] The Book of Romans the 12th
[1:02:37] chapter and uh read the uh first
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:43] two verses there I believe Romans
[1:02:51] 12 and um we'll start at the first verse
[1:02:57] says I beseech you therefore Brethren by
[1:02:59] the mercies of God that you present your
[1:03:03] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:03:05] acceptable unto
[1:03:07] God which is your reasonable service and
[1:03:11] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[1:03:13] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:03:17] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:03:20] acceptable and perfect will of God Amen
[1:03:25] let's just bow our heads Hearts to the
[1:03:29] Lord precious
[1:03:32] father
[1:03:34] we humbly ask father that you would just
[1:03:38] be with us
[1:03:39] now as we come to this part of the
[1:03:42] service which we believe to be the most
[1:03:46] important father for it's your word that
[1:03:49] you have hid us behind it's your word
[1:03:51] that we live
[1:03:52] by we can't live by anything else but
[1:03:56] your word and we just ask that you would
[1:03:59] just Inspire it to us father and may it
[1:04:04] be planted deep in our hearts help us
[1:04:08] Lord to
[1:04:09] receive father and that we may grow
[1:04:12] thereby I pray that you would not only
[1:04:15] anoint me but anoint the people as well
[1:04:17] we pray in Jesus Christ's name and the
[1:04:21] church
[1:04:22] says amen amen you can have your seats
[1:04:26] this
[1:04:27] evening and I going to use the title uh
[1:04:33] again uh overcoming the age of
[1:04:38] lukewarmness and we know that there is
[1:04:41] going to be an
[1:04:42] overcomer and uh
[1:04:45] for God did
[1:04:48] address them in the in that age um there
[1:04:54] but uh we we read there be not conformed
[1:04:57] but be ye
[1:04:59] transformed and of course um that that
[1:05:04] is the Overcomer those that are not
[1:05:07] conformed but transformed and of course
[1:05:10] the word conformed means to Fashion
[1:05:13] alike or conform to the same pattern so
[1:05:18] you you don't want to be conform to the
[1:05:20] same pattern as the world whatever you
[1:05:24] you are to overcome
[1:05:26] then you you you can't be fashioned like
[1:05:30] that and then transformed means
[1:05:33] something that has been changed
[1:05:36] something that's changed from one thing
[1:05:38] to another so the Overcomer is the one
[1:05:42] who doesn't follow the same pattern of
[1:05:45] the world the same traits the same
[1:05:49] characteristics the same habits uh you
[1:05:52] you you can't do that now the the the
[1:05:55] thing is is we have to overcome that
[1:05:58] because it's it's the easiest thing to
[1:06:01] conform because we're all born of of a
[1:06:05] carnal nature uh the adamic nature
[1:06:08] Fallen nature whatever you'd want to
[1:06:09] call it and the world operates by that
[1:06:13] um uh anything that is world based or of
[1:06:17] the world it it is inspired it comes
[1:06:21] from that carnal nature and so it's it's
[1:06:25] Auto automatically appealing to us it's
[1:06:27] automatically something that would
[1:06:28] attract us pull us draw us it's
[1:06:31] something that we would adapt to because
[1:06:33] that's part of us uh as carnal human
[1:06:37] beings um that's why rock and roll will
[1:06:41] will get it a little child uh at a very
[1:06:44] young age because it's it's something
[1:06:46] that is it comes from the carnal and and
[1:06:49] therefore that carnal nature uh uh
[1:06:53] automatically Falls in line with that uh
[1:06:57] uh movies uh television um uh smoking
[1:07:01] drugs sex uh uh all of these things uh
[1:07:07] it's it's it's something that would be
[1:07:10] easy to conform to be because and even
[1:07:13] religion even religion would be
[1:07:16] something to conform to so easily
[1:07:19] because it all comes from a a carnal uh
[1:07:23] it's it's a carnal thing
[1:07:26] and and that's that's uh so but but the
[1:07:29] the Overcomer is
[1:07:32] transformed it it it transformed Chang
[1:07:35] from one thing to another so so we we
[1:07:39] are living in the age of la le
[1:07:42] osia uh and and yes we know we're in the
[1:07:46] bright Age and and brother I I believe
[1:07:49] brother Brandon put that distinction
[1:07:51] bride age leay OS sea age is to show
[1:07:54] that we're not of the leodys and age
[1:07:57] that's the briad ages for the Overcomer
[1:08:00] and and so their traits their habits
[1:08:02] their characteristics everything about
[1:08:04] that Overcomer that bride age is totally
[1:08:08] different than a Le oosa but yet we're
[1:08:10] in leosia we're we're just like it you
[1:08:13] know we're in the world but we're not of
[1:08:15] the world ain't ain't that right and and
[1:08:18] so we're we're living in Le oosa but
[1:08:21] we're not part of that age we're not to
[1:08:23] be identified with age we're not to be
[1:08:27] uh uh um you know we we we don't
[1:08:31] identify with that we're not to we are
[1:08:33] actually to overcome it we are not to
[1:08:36] feel at home in this age we are not to
[1:08:38] adapt to this age uh we are called to
[1:08:43] overcome it and and so now brother
[1:08:46] bradam says overcome means to recognize
[1:08:49] the devil in every one of his tricks uh
[1:08:52] a lot of people say see there is no
[1:08:54] devil it's just just a thought don't you
[1:08:56] believe that there's a real devil he's
[1:08:58] just as real as you are anybody a real
[1:09:01] devil and you must recognize him real
[1:09:04] ain't that right now I'll just tell you
[1:09:06] right now you won't recognize him to be
[1:09:08] real or recognize him in every one of
[1:09:11] his tricks by your carnal nature amen
[1:09:13] you you it it just seems because you
[1:09:15] feel at home you just think it's
[1:09:17] comfortable you just think it's you know
[1:09:20] uh the the thing and a lot of people
[1:09:21] believe it's just of God really but but
[1:09:24] it's it it's a devil and you must
[1:09:27] recognize him in every one of his tricks
[1:09:30] you you he said so you must know he's a
[1:09:33] devil the same time you recognize him
[1:09:36] and know that he's a devil and he's
[1:09:38] against you how many believes that he
[1:09:41] he's against you and yet he'll appeal to
[1:09:44] your carnal nature he'll he'll appeal to
[1:09:47] your your flesh your spirit he he appeal
[1:09:50] to all this this but yet he's against
[1:09:52] you that's why the the prophet called
[1:09:55] enticing spirits but as they because
[1:09:58] they're they're they're appealing
[1:09:59] they're they're attractive but yet
[1:10:01] they're against you see and and so uh uh
[1:10:06] uh uh so so he's against you and then to
[1:10:09] overcome you must recognize that the god
[1:10:13] in you is greater and mightier than than
[1:10:16] he is the devil and that the one that's
[1:10:19] in you has already overcome him and by
[1:10:22] Grace you are more than a match for him
[1:10:25] see and so there's real overcoming when
[1:10:28] you recognize aren't you glad for that
[1:10:31] so there's no excuse for not uh uh
[1:10:33] overcoming it's just how to overcome
[1:10:36] you've got to recognize him you've got
[1:10:39] to recognize him in every one of his
[1:10:41] tricks you got to recognize that he is a
[1:10:43] devil and that he's against you ain't
[1:10:46] that right and then then the other part
[1:10:48] of recognition is you got to recognize
[1:10:51] that God the god that's in you is
[1:10:54] greater and mightier than the devil
[1:10:57] ain't that right amen and and recognize
[1:11:00] that God has already
[1:11:02] overcome uh uh uh the your enemy that's
[1:11:06] right see and so this is the greatest
[1:11:09] age of deception uh that that we're
[1:11:12] living in and and so then that tells us
[1:11:15] that in the greatest age of deception
[1:11:19] people aren't going to recognize people
[1:11:21] aren't going to know and and and yet the
[1:11:24] over Comer will be the only one to
[1:11:28] recognize showing that he isn't deceived
[1:11:31] there is a people that will never be
[1:11:34] deceived amen it would be so close that
[1:11:37] it would deceive the elect if it were
[1:11:39] possible that it can't it he'll never
[1:11:42] deceive the elect therefore that elect
[1:11:45] is the one that recognizes him in every
[1:11:48] one of his tricks and they are the
[1:11:51] Overcomer amen see and and so uh they
[1:11:55] recognize who is who what is what they
[1:11:59] they recognize that see and so now
[1:12:01] you'll not see the need to overcome uh
[1:12:05] uh if you don't recognize what you must
[1:12:07] overcome amen because a lot of times the
[1:12:10] things that you enjoy you've got to
[1:12:13] overcome that the the thing that you
[1:12:15] wouldd like to feel at home with you've
[1:12:17] got to overcome that the things that are
[1:12:19] attractive the things that appeal to you
[1:12:22] amen you've got to overcome that and
[1:12:25] that's why it would take amen
[1:12:27] recognizing the devil in every one of
[1:12:30] his tricks recognize that devil
[1:12:32] recognize what that spirit is trying to
[1:12:35] do to you where it's trying to take you
[1:12:37] amen where it's trying to go can you say
[1:12:39] amen amen you see so the Bible foretold
[1:12:43] that a people would get in in a
[1:12:46] condition to where they wouldn't be able
[1:12:48] to recognize or another word for
[1:12:50] recognize is discern uh uh between Good
[1:12:54] and Evil
[1:12:55] amen Isaiah 5:20 says woe unto them that
[1:12:59] call evil good and good evil that put
[1:13:03] Darkness for light and light for
[1:13:06] darkness and that put for bitter or
[1:13:09] bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter
[1:13:11] you talking about a confused people
[1:13:13] ain't that right amen they didn't change
[1:13:16] the bitterness Amen to Sweet they just
[1:13:18] can't tell the difference amen what is
[1:13:20] bitter they think it's sweet they call
[1:13:22] it sweet what is really evil they call
[1:13:25] it good and what is good they really
[1:13:28] call it evil see so we're we're this
[1:13:32] this is a perfect Prophecy of the day
[1:13:34] that we're living in an age of deception
[1:13:38] now it's the greatest Age The Prophet
[1:13:40] said it's it's even greater than what
[1:13:43] Eve done now you think of the deception
[1:13:45] that Eve went through amen God told her
[1:13:48] literally told her don't you eat of that
[1:13:50] tree I I guarantee you he he he took her
[1:13:54] to that and said don't you eat of that
[1:13:56] fruit now don't you eat that tree amen I
[1:13:58] I don't know but I'm sure God made it
[1:14:00] very clear of what she wasn't to do amen
[1:14:04] and and there was no muddle up in her
[1:14:07] mind because she had never known Satan
[1:14:08] she had never heard the voice of
[1:14:10] negative and and all that all she heard
[1:14:12] was clear truth don't you eat of that
[1:14:15] but by the time Satan got done with her
[1:14:18] amen the prophet said that she partook
[1:14:20] of it thinking that she was doing God a
[1:14:23] service thinking that she was doing God
[1:14:26] uh the uh uh the will of God think of
[1:14:29] that so that was deception but the
[1:14:31] prophet said that was deception in
[1:14:33] infant form infancy but we're living in
[1:14:37] a greater the greatest age of deception
[1:14:41] now the prophet said there's been
[1:14:42] greater days of of persecution we read
[1:14:46] this the other day when when the
[1:14:48] children of God was uh uh uh put to
[1:14:50] death on every hand see the greater days
[1:14:53] of persecution than what we are in today
[1:14:56] but to see the deceitfulness of the
[1:14:59] enemy we've never had a day like this
[1:15:03] we're living now see it's the most
[1:15:05] cunning deceitful day and when I see
[1:15:09] that it brings this that the Christian
[1:15:12] has to be more on his toes today than he
[1:15:15] ever was in any age can you say amen
[1:15:19] amen we've got to be on our guard at all
[1:15:23] times we've got to be on guard amen
[1:15:26] praise the Lord even when you're having
[1:15:28] bad days you better be on your toes amen
[1:15:31] amen when you're when you're discouraged
[1:15:33] and you ain't feeling good and and and
[1:15:35] you just don't know which way is up or
[1:15:37] down don't you let down your guard you
[1:15:41] got to be on your toes can you say Amen
[1:15:43] every Christian must be on her toes in
[1:15:47] this age amen so we can see why
[1:15:51] overcoming is the in this age is the
[1:15:54] hardest amen uh uh uh age than it ever
[1:15:58] was uh uh it it's going to be a a a a
[1:16:02] Wonder no wonder they're going to want
[1:16:04] to hear our story amen yes they might
[1:16:07] have been fed to the lies and they may
[1:16:09] have been burned at the Stak and all of
[1:16:11] that and and and and we look at that and
[1:16:13] say well that was a hard thing amen but
[1:16:16] so greater is is the deception in this
[1:16:20] day that is the hardest age to overcome
[1:16:23] that's why there's going to be very if
[1:16:25] you make it amen you you understand that
[1:16:27] right amen as brother Brandon put uh uh
[1:16:30] draw that to that pyramid it started at
[1:16:32] the base wide in the first church age
[1:16:34] but time it got to our age it was just
[1:16:37] like that amen there there's a more
[1:16:40] honing than any other age is in this age
[1:16:43] that God is having to hone us Amen to be
[1:16:47] able to fit in that slot amen aren't you
[1:16:50] glad for that amen see so overcoming is
[1:16:54] harder uh in this age than it was in any
[1:16:57] other age so it's this age that God had
[1:17:00] nothing good to say about think of that
[1:17:03] Amen in in all the other ages he had
[1:17:06] something nice to say about it but in
[1:17:07] this age the prophet said he had nothing
[1:17:09] good to say it was a plain rebuke amen
[1:17:13] thou sayest I'm rich and increased with
[1:17:15] goods and have need of nothing and
[1:17:17] knowest not everybody say knowest not
[1:17:21] don't know it see knowest not that thou
[1:17:24] art riched miserable poor blind and
[1:17:26] naked see and so then then what is this
[1:17:30] the it's it's it's a a it's lukewarm
[1:17:33] it's an age of lukewarm the people of
[1:17:35] this age is is lukewarm lovers of
[1:17:38] pleasure more than lovers of God and yet
[1:17:42] have a form of godliness you talk to
[1:17:44] most people they're Christians they they
[1:17:47] they profess God they profess
[1:17:49] Christianity they they have some type of
[1:17:52] religious um uh uh uh uh confession or
[1:17:56] whatever amen and yet smoking drinking
[1:18:00] uh committing adultery and living in sin
[1:18:02] and so carnal and all of these things
[1:18:05] amen but that's what the prophet uh uh
[1:18:08] Paul I believe would tell us that lovers
[1:18:10] of pleasure lovers of pleasure there's
[1:18:13] never been an age where so much
[1:18:14] entertainment and so much pleasure as it
[1:18:17] is in this day amen pleasure loving
[1:18:20] people in this day and yet having a form
[1:18:24] of God godliness amen see so so they
[1:18:27] they don't totally reject God Amen they
[1:18:31] but uh uh they they they go through the
[1:18:33] rituals of of of of things see but
[1:18:37] notice now uh uh uh Matthew 2412 Jesus
[1:18:41] said and because iniquity everybody say
[1:18:44] iniquity inity because iniquity shall
[1:18:47] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:18:52] now that's prophetic of our day today
[1:18:55] there's never been a time that iniquity
[1:18:58] amen has reached its peak as it is today
[1:19:02] amen and the love of many are waxing
[1:19:05] cold because iniquity is abounding more
[1:19:09] and more and more see the scripture is
[1:19:12] is speaking of this Le oysan age amen
[1:19:16] see love of many wax cold because of
[1:19:20] iniquity abounding see iniquity you it
[1:19:24] that's a horrible thing iniquity and yet
[1:19:27] they have a form of godliness but deny
[1:19:30] the power thereof still having a form of
[1:19:33] godliness but yet their love is waxing
[1:19:37] cold because of iniquity amen amen see
[1:19:41] and and so now you know uh uh denying
[1:19:44] the power see uh Paul or Peter would say
[1:19:48] uh the the having a form of godliness
[1:19:51] but denying the power thereof having a
[1:19:54] form of godliness oh God I love you
[1:19:56] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus but denying the
[1:19:59] very power thereof Amen brother brandom
[1:20:03] said Pentecost is a blessing it's the
[1:20:06] power of God ain't that right so so what
[1:20:10] what they're denying is Pentecostal
[1:20:12] power now you know good and well we're
[1:20:14] not talking about Pentecostal age
[1:20:16] brother brandom even said them
[1:20:18] Pentecostals of of the age amen needed a
[1:20:21] Pentecostal fire amen they ain't really
[1:20:24] got what they had or claimed to have see
[1:20:27] amen so what is this what is the power
[1:20:29] of God the Pentecostal power whatever
[1:20:31] you want to call it it's the quickening
[1:20:34] power that makes you alive amen it it
[1:20:38] quickens that mortal body amen see
[1:20:41] brother brandham says this I'm so glad
[1:20:43] that there is a 10,000 octane power the
[1:20:47] word of God and a holy ghost to light it
[1:20:50] up and to resurrect the power of God
[1:20:53] into a man's life or a woman's life or
[1:20:56] into a church that's what a the Church
[1:20:59] of God Amen God wants out of his church
[1:21:03] amen a people that's got a 10,000 octane
[1:21:07] power within them where the word of God
[1:21:09] and the Holy Ghost is lit up in their
[1:21:12] lives amen and the resurrection power of
[1:21:15] God Amen is within them pul Satan within
[1:21:19] them quickening the word to them
[1:21:22] quickening things of God to life
[1:21:25] can you say amen amen most people today
[1:21:27] that go to church they don't know
[1:21:29] nothing about God they don't know about
[1:21:31] the miraculous power of God they don't
[1:21:33] know about the healing power of God they
[1:21:36] don't know uh uh about the saving power
[1:21:39] of God they don't know nothing about the
[1:21:41] delivering power of God do you
[1:21:43] understand what I'm saying brother
[1:21:45] brandom even said that the people are
[1:21:47] the church is turning the people to the
[1:21:49] doctors now he said especially to the
[1:21:51] psychiatrist because a church that
[1:21:54] should know the power of God don't know
[1:21:57] the power of God they've got the form of
[1:21:59] godliness amen but they're more
[1:22:01] acquainted amen with psychology they're
[1:22:03] more acquainted with a medical field
[1:22:06] than they are the power of God you see
[1:22:09] the this power that the church is
[1:22:11] denying is the Dynamics brother Braham
[1:22:15] said when you have received this Holy
[1:22:17] Spirit now see that uh they did at
[1:22:20] Pentecost see they were the mechanics
[1:22:23] now the Dynamics had to come see they
[1:22:26] had believed you know our good Baptist
[1:22:29] friends tells us when we believe we've
[1:22:31] got it but they didn't have it see yet
[1:22:34] they had believed Acts 19 they had
[1:22:37] believed but they didn't have it have
[1:22:39] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:22:41] believed see they had the mechanics all
[1:22:44] right because apollis uh was teaching to
[1:22:47] them and proving by the Bible see the
[1:22:49] mechanics that Jesus was the Christ but
[1:22:52] they didn't have the Dynamics see
[1:22:55] that's it see he said so when you get
[1:22:57] the Dynamics you have been quickened
[1:22:59] from Mortal to immortality it makes the
[1:23:02] whole body com subject to the word it'll
[1:23:06] make you act different look different
[1:23:09] live different it'll just make you
[1:23:11] different what is it it'll transform you
[1:23:15] amen instead of you conforming to the
[1:23:17] world there is a power amen that will
[1:23:21] transform you amen see so so then this
[1:23:25] is why amen that this lay otsy a bunch
[1:23:29] isn't being changed amen they're not
[1:23:31] being changed amen we've had more clear
[1:23:34] gospel in this age than any other age
[1:23:37] and it should be enough to change a
[1:23:39] person amen but instead of that they're
[1:23:41] looking for a messiah in politics
[1:23:43] they're so wrapped up in the things of
[1:23:45] the world Amen they won't know when
[1:23:47] Christ comes they won't know when the
[1:23:50] change really happens to that elect can
[1:23:52] you say Amen why because they've got a
[1:23:55] form of godliness they'll accept that
[1:23:57] amen but they deny that very power well
[1:24:00] what is that that power is the power of
[1:24:04] transformation amen see they deny the
[1:24:08] power of transformation so see the only
[1:24:12] change that the people are wanting is a
[1:24:14] perverted change amen they want a world
[1:24:17] without God they want a world without
[1:24:20] biblical standards and convictions they
[1:24:23] want a world without Holiness they want
[1:24:25] a world without the revealed word can
[1:24:28] you say Amen they want a world without
[1:24:31] Christ the person of Christ amen they
[1:24:34] want a world without a token in this age
[1:24:37] amen they want to change think of that
[1:24:39] God has promised them a change he showed
[1:24:41] them what he would do in this age
[1:24:43] through Abraham just before he changed
[1:24:46] them he appeared to them in in flesh
[1:24:51] amen it was the power that had come to
[1:24:53] Abraham and Sarah to change them amen
[1:24:57] but they rejected that when Christ
[1:24:59] appeared in this day in flesh to change
[1:25:01] them amen they rejected the power can
[1:25:04] you say Amen they rejected that that
[1:25:07] come to them to change them now they're
[1:25:09] looking for change they're looking for a
[1:25:11] politician to change them amen they want
[1:25:14] change in the world they want change in
[1:25:15] America they want to get rid of all the
[1:25:18] evil amen and change as though some
[1:25:20] sinner is going to change them God
[1:25:23] promised them a change
[1:25:24] God came to change them and they
[1:25:26] rejected
[1:25:30] it can you say man see they they want a
[1:25:34] world without Holiness they want a they
[1:25:37] want a world without standards they want
[1:25:40] a world where they can do what they want
[1:25:42] when they want so what they want is they
[1:25:44] want to get rid of the power of Jesus
[1:25:47] Christ they'll take military power any
[1:25:50] day but when there's a word power that
[1:25:53] comes to them they don't want that can
[1:25:55] you say amen that's right see amen see
[1:25:59] and so you you remember when he walked
[1:26:01] the Earth the first time Jesus see they
[1:26:04] wanted to get rid of him they hated him
[1:26:07] because he didn't go along with their
[1:26:09] teachings they hated him because he
[1:26:11] didn't agree with way the churches were
[1:26:13] they hated him because he didn't agree
[1:26:16] with their way of worship and he condemn
[1:26:18] them for their backsliding ways amen
[1:26:21] people get offended when you just call
[1:26:22] it out amen just like like it is amen if
[1:26:25] you ain't got a strength enough your
[1:26:27] backslid amen that's what it is amen but
[1:26:30] God didn't call us to live in a backslid
[1:26:32] and lay out of SE and age and conformed
[1:26:35] to this he called us to be on fire for
[1:26:37] God he called us Amen to stand at our
[1:26:40] post of Duty and to fight every devil of
[1:26:43] hell it doesn't matter what it is amen
[1:26:46] but he condemned them for their
[1:26:49] backsliding ways brother Brown said they
[1:26:51] hated him so bad because he tore up all
[1:26:55] their
[1:26:56] organizations so to rid him out of their
[1:27:00] sight to get rid of him they buried him
[1:27:03] see and rode a great big D
[1:27:05] denominational Stone over the door so
[1:27:08] he'd be sure not to rise again but we
[1:27:11] got good news right amen the grave
[1:27:13] couldn't keep him from rising that old
[1:27:16] denominational Stone couldn't keep him
[1:27:17] from coming out and exposing himself and
[1:27:20] manifesting himself again amen he said
[1:27:24] see and then he tells them I'm going to
[1:27:26] send back to the father but I'm going to
[1:27:29] bring my spirit back Amen to you ain't
[1:27:33] that right and he told them he told that
[1:27:35] little elect tear ye into the city of
[1:27:38] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:27:41] from on high that same spirit that has
[1:27:43] quickened me is now going to Quicken you
[1:27:46] amen the same God that made me overcome
[1:27:49] this age is the same God that's going to
[1:27:52] be in you to cause you overcome and did
[1:27:55] they overcome you bet they did they
[1:27:58] overcome see why because the spirit that
[1:28:01] same spirit that was in Christ amen was
[1:28:04] dwelling in them now we've talked about
[1:28:07] the false Vine you all know about it
[1:28:09] amen and and the false Vine amen was
[1:28:13] planted it was planted without having
[1:28:16] the quickening power of God it's a
[1:28:18] carnal church that false Vine is carnal
[1:28:22] Amen in that in that false Vine that
[1:28:24] false Vine produces carnal
[1:28:26] impersonations carnal interpretation of
[1:28:29] the scriptures carnal comparisons carnal
[1:28:31] worship carnal forms of religion carnal
[1:28:35] Impressions carnal men using gifts in a
[1:28:37] carnal way everything about it is carnal
[1:28:40] carnal carnal amen there might be even
[1:28:42] men that are God called got a true gift
[1:28:45] in their heart but they'll use it in a
[1:28:47] carnal way amen got carnal learning
[1:28:49] they'll go to school they'll what
[1:28:51] whatever floats their boat they'll do it
[1:28:53] see it's it's a carnal amen thing ain't
[1:28:56] that right see having a form of
[1:28:58] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:29:02] to Quicken their mind to Quicken their
[1:29:05] understanding to Quicken their body Amen
[1:29:07] to Quicken everything about them to the
[1:29:10] word of God and what has it done it's
[1:29:14] produced a lukewarm age to where they're
[1:29:17] not all together cold and not hot but
[1:29:21] just uh uh lukewarm you know you you
[1:29:24] drink lukewarm water it'll make you sick
[1:29:27] drink lukewarm milk it'll make you vomit
[1:29:30] amen see the prophet said the church
[1:29:33] should be fervent everybody say fervent
[1:29:35] amen the church should be fervent Amen
[1:29:38] in other words hot amen not cold hot
[1:29:43] ain't that right amen the world should
[1:29:45] be cold and the church should be hot but
[1:29:48] it ain't that way amen that everybody's
[1:29:51] lukewarm Amen to where they they sing
[1:29:54] country songs and gospel songs rock and
[1:29:56] roll songs and gospel songs and
[1:29:59] everybody just pays you know just loves
[1:30:01] it and swallows it up amen like drinking
[1:30:03] Kool-Aid you know and and and and it
[1:30:06] doesn't bother them they'll they'll
[1:30:08] watch television they'll watch this
[1:30:10] they'll have this they'll have they'll
[1:30:12] have all kinds of stuff and it doesn't
[1:30:14] matter amen that they need the anointing
[1:30:16] when they get up and sing it doesn't
[1:30:18] matter that they need the spirit of God
[1:30:21] Amen to come into their church and break
[1:30:23] the feds amen they got professional
[1:30:26] choirs they got professional singers
[1:30:28] they got professional uh uh musicians
[1:30:31] they got professional preachers
[1:30:33] everything's professional it's becoming
[1:30:35] professional uh uh uh uh uh leoty you
[1:30:39] understand see amen everything's
[1:30:41] becoming professional amen but what we
[1:30:43] need is the spirit we need the church to
[1:30:46] be on fire for God so hot that God feels
[1:30:50] welcome in the church
[1:30:54] see that that word fervent it means
[1:30:57] having or showing great intensity of
[1:31:00] feeling or
[1:31:01] enthusiasm see see the the church world
[1:31:04] has lost their
[1:31:06] enthusiasm oh it's true now uh yeah oh
[1:31:10] yeah but you'll talk to them about
[1:31:11] cooking and and they'll get excited
[1:31:13] about that they'll tell you about their
[1:31:15] new grill they'll tell you about their
[1:31:16] new their new you know their new recipe
[1:31:19] they they'll tell you about the the ball
[1:31:21] games they'll tell you about their new
[1:31:23] deer and that they just shot or the gun
[1:31:25] they just shot it with and they they get
[1:31:28] so excited about everything but when it
[1:31:31] comes to the things of God they've lost
[1:31:34] their
[1:31:35] enthusiasm see amen so so fervent means
[1:31:38] having or showing great intensity amen
[1:31:43] of feeling or
[1:31:45] enthusiasm Amen in other words you
[1:31:48] become a theme for
[1:31:50] Christ not a baseball theme a Jesus
[1:31:53] Christ
[1:31:54] theme a message
[1:31:56] theme ain't that right very hot fervent
[1:32:00] means very hot glowing exhibiting or
[1:32:03] marked by great intensity of feeling
[1:32:07] zealous amen so brother Brandon we we
[1:32:09] read this the other day but brother BR
[1:32:11] said what is wrong with these people of
[1:32:13] the last days they have gotten away from
[1:32:16] the word they are no longer fervent
[1:32:19] about it other words there there's no
[1:32:21] feeling of intensity about the word of
[1:32:24] God oh they'll pick up some magazine
[1:32:26] they'll pick up a love story they'll
[1:32:28] they'll turn on some rotten stupid
[1:32:31] filthy movie you understand what I'm
[1:32:33] saying that it's Godless where you have
[1:32:35] to turn your head every time you look at
[1:32:36] it amen boys if you got to turn your
[1:32:39] head amen it don't belong in your house
[1:32:42] amen that's right see amen if you got to
[1:32:44] do these things see amen but what is it
[1:32:47] see amen we've lost the fervency about
[1:32:50] the word the world has lost the fervency
[1:32:53] about the word word amen and what's it
[1:32:55] doing they've lost their their their
[1:32:57] their feeling for God Amen it doesn't
[1:33:00] matter about things anymore women will
[1:33:02] show their their breast they'll show
[1:33:04] every form of their body and and and uh
[1:33:07] the skirts are getting shorter the and
[1:33:09] getting tighter the blouses are getting
[1:33:11] Tighter and and you understand what I'm
[1:33:14] saying amen it's things see and because
[1:33:17] they ain't fervent about the word
[1:33:19] brother Brown said they are lukewarm
[1:33:21] about it now notice what he says look he
[1:33:25] said the great scientific educational
[1:33:27] hybrid Eve today called The Church what
[1:33:31] is she trying to do she is trying to is
[1:33:34] she trying to exalt God's word and let
[1:33:36] the people do the way they're doing see
[1:33:39] uh See she's not trying to exalt God's
[1:33:41] word amen and she's letting the people
[1:33:44] just do whatever see now notice he says
[1:33:47] see they're not using a thinking man's
[1:33:49] filter or God's filter see look what
[1:33:52] they're producing they're exalting
[1:33:54] themselves instead of God's word ain't
[1:33:56] that right exalting their knowledge
[1:33:59] exalting their interpretations exalting
[1:34:01] their wisdom exalting all of that
[1:34:04] instead of just staying basically with
[1:34:05] the the basic truths of the Bible see
[1:34:09] look see so he said they're exalting
[1:34:11] themselves the church is in her deformed
[1:34:14] seed of knowledge program has caused the
[1:34:17] whole race to be scientifically ignorant
[1:34:20] of the word of God now you think of that
[1:34:22] now amen man more people going to church
[1:34:26] and yet scientifically ignorant of the
[1:34:29] word of God ignorant of the word of God
[1:34:33] see he said but the people are willfully
[1:34:36] sinning they're willfully sinning it's
[1:34:39] brought the whole system of church world
[1:34:41] today into a willful sin against
[1:34:46] God and you say Amen it's got to a point
[1:34:49] that no matter what you tell them they
[1:34:51] ain't going to listen hey ain't going to
[1:34:54] listen and yet they'll say Amen to it
[1:34:57] they they they'll they'll oh yeah yeah
[1:34:59] preacher go right ahead yeah woohoo and
[1:35:01] then they won't listen to it something's
[1:35:04] not causing them to be
[1:35:08] transformed can you say Amen see so the
[1:35:11] name Le oia means people's rights or
[1:35:15] Justice of the people brother Bram said
[1:35:17] was there ever an age like the 20th
[1:35:20] century Church age that has seen all
[1:35:23] Nation rising up and demanding equality
[1:35:27] socially and financially this is the age
[1:35:30] of the Communist where all men are
[1:35:32] supposedly equal though it is only so in
[1:35:36] theory this is the age of political
[1:35:38] parties who call themselves Christian
[1:35:40] democrats Christian socialists Christian
[1:35:44] Commonwealth Federation Etc Christian
[1:35:46] Republicans we'll put that in there too
[1:35:49] amen Christian Independence everybody's
[1:35:52] just a Christian right Amen in their own
[1:35:55] rights amen see profess see and so
[1:35:58] according to our liberal theologians
[1:36:01] Jesus was also a socialist see that's
[1:36:04] what that Leota Bunch amen interprets
[1:36:07] Jesus to be was just a socialist and the
[1:36:10] early church under the guidance of the
[1:36:12] spirit practiced socialism and thus we
[1:36:16] ought to do so today well you know what
[1:36:18] a socialist is it's an advocate for
[1:36:20] socialism so they they say Jesus was a
[1:36:23] an advocate amen for socialism well
[1:36:26] socialism is a system of society or
[1:36:29] group living in which there is no
[1:36:32] private property see so under socialism
[1:36:36] There Is No Boundaries to a property
[1:36:38] amen and and and all has rights to it
[1:36:41] amen I I you have right to my property I
[1:36:44] got right to your property and and and
[1:36:46] but not only that then you got right to
[1:36:49] my property and you got right to his
[1:36:51] property and we got right to your
[1:36:52] property there's no boundaries amen
[1:36:55] everybody's just claiming whatever I got
[1:36:57] right to your house you got right to
[1:36:59] mine and da D D D D see and and so we we
[1:37:02] live in this you know what is mine is
[1:37:04] yours and what is yours is mine and and
[1:37:06] it's all equal see and so they say that
[1:37:09] Jesus was a socialist so so basically
[1:37:12] what what the what they're trying to
[1:37:14] represent in the christiandom is that
[1:37:16] we're all going to heaven heaven is all
[1:37:19] of ours amen and and and there's so many
[1:37:21] ways that we can go to heaven and
[1:37:23] everybody can go to heaven see there's
[1:37:25] no sinner there's no Sint there's no
[1:37:28] right and wrong we all have equal rights
[1:37:31] to heaven we all have equal rights Amen
[1:37:33] to the body of Christ we all have equal
[1:37:36] rights to the rapture we have everything
[1:37:38] in common there's no separation in
[1:37:41] between us and and the moment you set up
[1:37:43] amen and start preaching a conviction or
[1:37:46] whatever people get offended by that how
[1:37:48] dare you say that to me amen I'm right
[1:37:51] I'm okay you understand what I'm saying
[1:37:54] there there's no differention there
[1:37:56] there's nothing it's just what it is
[1:37:58] it's a filth love it's human compassion
[1:38:01] amen it it's something that that a love
[1:38:04] amen for one another that causes us Amen
[1:38:07] to push back God's word and and just be
[1:38:10] acceptable of everything and anything
[1:38:13] there's no difference can you say Amen
[1:38:16] so now brother brandom in talking of
[1:38:18] this Le oosa he said see when the
[1:38:21] Ancients called Le oosa
[1:38:23] the Metropol
[1:38:26] Metropolis Metro
[1:38:28] whatever uh it was looking forward to
[1:38:32] the One World Government that we are now
[1:38:36] setting
[1:38:37] up we're headed to a One World
[1:38:40] Government ain't that right as we think
[1:38:44] of that City being the location of a
[1:38:46] great church
[1:38:49] counil we see foreshadow The ecumenical
[1:38:52] move taking place today see wherein very
[1:38:56] soon we will see all the so-called
[1:38:59] Christians come together who's coming
[1:39:03] together so-called Christians all
[1:39:06] so-called Christians are coming together
[1:39:09] they're dropping all their barriers
[1:39:10] they're dropping all their convictions
[1:39:12] they're dropping all their rights
[1:39:14] they're dropping everything their claims
[1:39:16] everything to where they become
[1:39:18] acceptant to
[1:39:21] everything hello
[1:39:24] he said indeed the church and state
[1:39:26] religion and politics are coming
[1:39:29] together that's why the church is so
[1:39:32] much in
[1:39:34] politics they're coming
[1:39:36] together church and state is coming
[1:39:39] together religion and politics are
[1:39:41] coming together see and they think it
[1:39:44] will be the Gathering of
[1:39:47] all but see what they don't realize it
[1:39:50] isn't a gathering of all it's only The
[1:39:54] Binding of the
[1:39:56] tears yes sir but the wheat wasn't bound
[1:39:59] with them tears can you say Amen there's
[1:40:03] going to be an overcomer in this
[1:40:06] age no matter how how few it is and few
[1:40:11] it will be but somebody is going to
[1:40:14] stand there under the power of God Amen
[1:40:18] and claim what is rightfully theirs by
[1:40:20] the word of
[1:40:22] God they're going to withstand that
[1:40:24] spirit and I say they are withstanding
[1:40:27] can you say amen I hope this all right
[1:40:30] for for tonight amen but they
[1:40:32] withstanding you're you're going through
[1:40:34] your battles because you're standing
[1:40:36] amen it you're standing but don't you
[1:40:39] understand what Satan wanting to get you
[1:40:40] to do he's wanting you to go with the
[1:40:42] way of the world and bind you up with
[1:40:45] the tears but there's already been
[1:40:47] written that the wheat will not be pound
[1:40:50] not with the tears the wheat is not
[1:40:53] bound with the tears it's gathered into
[1:40:56] the Garner Lord are you with me it's
[1:40:59] gathered in the Garner why what gathered
[1:41:02] it there was a carcass that came there
[1:41:05] was the word the revealed word had come
[1:41:08] and where the Eagles are the carcasses
[1:41:10] there is the Eagles are gathered
[1:41:13] together can you sayen amen the tears
[1:41:15] are being uh they're being gathered
[1:41:17] they're being bound together in the
[1:41:19] world Council of churches you watch it
[1:41:22] it's happening that's right it's
[1:41:27] happening
[1:41:29] now praise the Lord you love him so the
[1:41:32] weed is the Overcomer that's overcome
[1:41:35] the spirit of people's rights the spirit
[1:41:39] of
[1:41:40] equality if they got to get their toes
[1:41:42] stepped on so be it if my life is not
[1:41:47] lining up with this word I want to
[1:41:50] know that's right if God is got to cut
[1:41:53] and cut here and cut here and cut here I
[1:41:57] want him to do
[1:42:01] it now notice brother briam goes on to
[1:42:05] say the name Le oia was a very common
[1:42:08] name back
[1:42:10] then and it was given to several cities
[1:42:13] in honor of Royal ladies so named this
[1:42:16] city was one of the most political
[1:42:19] politically important and financially
[1:42:22] flourishing cities in Asia Minor Le
[1:42:25] osia enormous amounts of property were
[1:42:28] bequeathed to the City by prominent
[1:42:31] citizens it was the seat of a great
[1:42:34] Medical
[1:42:36] School its people were distinguished in
[1:42:39] the Arts and Sciences it was often
[1:42:42] called the
[1:42:44] Metropolis that word
[1:42:46] again
[1:42:48] amen as it was the county seat for 25
[1:42:51] other cities the Pagan God worshiped
[1:42:55] there was Zeus in fact this city was
[1:42:58] once called
[1:43:01] de
[1:43:03] dipolos city of Zeus in honor of their
[1:43:06] God in the fourth Century an important
[1:43:10] Church Council was held there oh my see
[1:43:15] in the city of Le oysa frequent
[1:43:18] earthquakes finally caused its complete
[1:43:21] abandonment how fitting were the the
[1:43:23] characteristics of this last age to
[1:43:25] represent the age in which we now live
[1:43:28] in see for example they worship one God
[1:43:31] Zeus who was the chief and father of the
[1:43:34] Gods see this forecast the 20th century
[1:43:38] one God father of us all religious
[1:43:41] premise that sets forth the Brotherhood
[1:43:44] of men and is now is is even now
[1:43:48] bringing together the Protestants
[1:43:50] Catholics Jews Hindus Etc with the
[1:43:54] intent that a mutual form of worship
[1:43:57] will increase our love understanding and
[1:44:00] care of each other the Catholics and
[1:44:03] Protestants are even now striving for
[1:44:06] and actually gaining ground in this
[1:44:08] Union with the avowed intent that all
[1:44:12] others will
[1:44:15] follow now they purposed that all others
[1:44:18] will
[1:44:20] follow ain't that right this very
[1:44:24] attitude was seen in the United Nations
[1:44:27] uh organization when the world leaders
[1:44:29] refus to recognize any one individual
[1:44:32] concept of spiritual worship see they
[1:44:35] refuse to recognize any one individual
[1:44:40] concept of spiritual worship but
[1:44:43] recommended putting aside all those
[1:44:46] separate concepts with the hopes that
[1:44:48] all religions become leveled into one
[1:44:52] for all desire the same goals all have
[1:44:56] the same purposes and all are basically
[1:45:01] right
[1:45:05] nonsense right am I hope that's all
[1:45:09] right see they theyve come how did they
[1:45:12] get to this condition it started out
[1:45:14] with one Church in the beginning that
[1:45:16] was on fire and fervent and and on on on
[1:45:20] excited passionate about God and his
[1:45:22] word to where it wrote the book of
[1:45:25] Acts now we've come to this to where it
[1:45:29] doesn't matter what you believe it
[1:45:30] doesn't matter which way you worship it
[1:45:32] doesn't matter
[1:45:34] nothing they've come to this condition
[1:45:38] by no longer being fervent by the
[1:45:42] word and you say well I'll never be like
[1:45:46] that you better stay
[1:45:48] fervent you better stay fervent about
[1:45:50] that word you better not be lukewarm
[1:45:52] about that word we're in a deceivable
[1:45:55] age decep a deceiving age can you say
[1:45:58] man lukewarm now notice the city of Le
[1:46:02] oysa was one of earthquakes such
[1:46:04] earthquakes as finally destroyed
[1:46:09] it this Le oysan age will end in God
[1:46:12] shaking the whole world that has gone
[1:46:14] off to make love with the old Harlot not
[1:46:17] only will World Systems crumble but the
[1:46:19] very Earth will be shaken and then
[1:46:22] renovated for the millennial reign of
[1:46:24] Christ now Church we're here we're
[1:46:27] seeing the shaking not only in the
[1:46:30] spiritual world but in the natural
[1:46:34] world he says the city of Le oysa was
[1:46:37] rich endowed by the wealthy it was full
[1:46:40] of culture science
[1:46:42] abounded see how like today the churches
[1:46:46] are rich the worship is beautiful and
[1:46:49] formal but cold and dead culture and
[1:46:53] education have taken the place of the
[1:46:56] spirit-given word and faith has been
[1:46:59] superseded by
[1:47:01] science people don't need Faith
[1:47:05] anymore they've got everything at their
[1:47:08] the
[1:47:09] disposal at their fingertips by through
[1:47:12] by
[1:47:15] science faith has been superseded by
[1:47:18] science so that man is a victim of
[1:47:22] materialism
[1:47:26] that's in this age see what you got to
[1:47:30] overcome in every attribute ancient Le
[1:47:34] oosa is found now notice this in every
[1:47:37] attribute Ancient Ancient Le oysa is
[1:47:40] found reborn in the 20th century Le
[1:47:43] oysan age in the mercy of God May those
[1:47:47] who have an ear to hear come out of her
[1:47:50] that they may not be partakers of her
[1:47:52] sins and the consequent
[1:47:55] judgment and again because iniquity is
[1:47:59] abounding the love of many has wax cold
[1:48:04] brother Braham says I you know we got
[1:48:06] the plenty of churches plenty of
[1:48:08] teaching plenty of religious gatherings
[1:48:11] plenty of religious Deeds but we need
[1:48:13] the love of God ain't that right he said
[1:48:16] the love is dying away amen and what
[1:48:20] they got into just a form see beat the
[1:48:23] piano up and down real hard and holler
[1:48:26] glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:48:28] like that it's just a form see so that
[1:48:31] tells us that all shouting and dancing
[1:48:34] and all that is not all NE is not all
[1:48:38] controlled by the spirit of God or even
[1:48:41] inspired uh uh uh uh uh by by the spirit
[1:48:44] of God you can actually be dancing
[1:48:46] shouting glory to God hallelujah and it
[1:48:49] just be a form if the fire ain't lit in
[1:48:52] your oh amen if you're not passionate
[1:48:55] about the word of God on the job at the
[1:48:57] house Amen in your life at the school
[1:49:00] wherever you are your religion is just a
[1:49:04] form now see it become just a form just
[1:49:08] a kind of acting what we used to have
[1:49:12] now think of what he's saying it's just
[1:49:13] a form just kind of
[1:49:17] acting God didn't call us to act like
[1:49:21] the first Pentecostal Church on the the
[1:49:22] days of
[1:49:24] Acts we're not to act that's just a form
[1:49:29] we want that same fire that they had we
[1:49:32] want the same dynamics that Quicken
[1:49:34] their body and their spirit and their
[1:49:37] soul and transform them we want that
[1:49:41] same
[1:49:43] Dynamics can you say amen that's right
[1:49:46] see he says it's just become a form just
[1:49:49] kind of acting what we used to have and
[1:49:51] that travail of soul is just about
[1:49:54] over now think of that so the
[1:49:57] Pentecostals had come into a form of
[1:49:59] acting I believe there was elect on that
[1:50:02] that was there on isusa street that was
[1:50:04] come out of that isusa street I believe
[1:50:06] that amen but most of it was just a form
[1:50:09] it was just
[1:50:12] acting it's just true but here we've
[1:50:15] come amen God help us not to just be
[1:50:19] actors God help you sisters not to just
[1:50:22] be actors you got your long hair you got
[1:50:24] your dress you got everything just right
[1:50:26] but if you can't get rid of your gossip
[1:50:28] Spirit you're just
[1:50:31] acting
[1:50:32] hello amen if we can't get rid of our
[1:50:35] bitterness if we can't get rid of the
[1:50:36] things of the world we're just acting
[1:50:40] and that goes to us men as well if you
[1:50:42] cannot get rid of that pornography
[1:50:44] you're just
[1:50:46] acting you're just being a Pharisee
[1:50:53] true right living like the world acting
[1:50:57] like the world treating our wives like
[1:50:59] they're just idiots you understand what
[1:51:01] I'm saying God never called you Amen to
[1:51:03] Lord over your house and and and brother
[1:51:06] brandham said don't treat your wife like
[1:51:07] she's just a
[1:51:09] doorm you can't respect that woman
[1:51:11] should have married
[1:51:14] her that you're just acting see amen but
[1:51:17] what did Brother RM say he said that
[1:51:19] travail of soul is just about over see
[1:51:23] people are more in in in at home with
[1:51:25] sin than they are crying against
[1:51:32] sin don't worry about I'm just preaching
[1:51:35] to the church next door so yall don't
[1:51:37] worry about
[1:51:39] it now church this just on my
[1:51:44] heart so if it's not for you don't worry
[1:51:46] about
[1:51:47] it pray for the person that it is okay
[1:51:52] brother Bram said talking about this
[1:51:54] layot toy and age they think more of
[1:51:55] their pride and their dignity than they
[1:51:57] do of the lovely Christ of God young men
[1:52:00] and young women thinking more of the
[1:52:02] things of this world than they do of God
[1:52:05] people put more on the Christmas tree
[1:52:07] than they do for Christ preachers think
[1:52:09] more of a meal ticket than they do the
[1:52:11] gospel you understand this is way osia
[1:52:14] this is where we're at they think more
[1:52:15] of the Bunny and the eggs than they do
[1:52:17] the resurrection of Jesus Christ they
[1:52:20] put more emphasis on the play and the
[1:52:22] drama make sure that it's professional
[1:52:24] amen then accepting the resurrected
[1:52:26] power of Jesus
[1:52:29] Christ that's right it's
[1:52:32] true brother Bram said people of this
[1:52:34] age think more of their society than
[1:52:36] they do of Christ they think more of
[1:52:38] hurting people's feelings than they do
[1:52:40] of standing for
[1:52:45] Christ God didn't call you just to be
[1:52:47] friends with people God called you to be
[1:52:49] a witness of his resurrection
[1:52:53] amen the Lord I understand you got to be
[1:52:56] salty I understand you can't be just you
[1:52:58] know I I know I use uh a strong language
[1:53:01] sometimes but you just can't be
[1:53:04] jerks can't go around being rude stuck
[1:53:08] up I understand that you got to be
[1:53:10] friends you got to and I know you
[1:53:13] are amen but Church there's a spirit in
[1:53:16] this day that wants us to blend just to
[1:53:20] blend we don't want to stand out

[1:53:25] sent a prophet and what God actually
[1:53:27] done in this day it's more we we stand
[1:53:29] more criticism for
[1:53:32] that then we would to believe that that
[1:53:35] that that that we you know that someone
[1:53:37] else would when they tell they pray for
[1:53:39] uh to an idol of
[1:53:43] Mary they they don't get criticized for
[1:53:45] praying for to some dumb

[1:55:15] God you should be more in love with God
[1:55:18] than
[1:55:19] yourself you should be more in love with
[1:55:21] God than than the materialist that what
[1:55:23] does it matter if we have nice cars and
[1:55:25] nice houses I'm not saying that's wrong
[1:55:28] but when we put that in front of of of
[1:55:31] of God and we take that and put that in
[1:55:33] the place of God something is
[1:55:39] wrong amen see you got to be
[1:55:42] Overcomers see so so he said see he said
[1:55:46] uh uh so I'll read it again in the layot
[1:55:47] of see or last days self-love and love
[1:55:50] for material things will take the place
[1:55:52] of the true love of God we need to guard
[1:55:55] everybody say we need to guard make that
[1:55:57] personal I need to guard I want to say
[1:56:00] this preacher needs to guard against the
[1:56:02] power of sin in these last days so many
[1:56:06] are getting so hard because they haven't
[1:56:09] realized the effect of this last day
[1:56:12] Spirit see it is time to draw nigh to
[1:56:15] God and let him feel our lives with his
[1:56:17] love or we will feel the coldness of
[1:56:20] this last day Church and reject the
[1:56:23] truth of God which alone everybody say
[1:56:26] it is alone which alone is able to help
[1:56:31] us nothing else will be able to help us
[1:56:33] no politician will be able to help us no
[1:56:36] doctor of divinity will be able your
[1:56:39] doctor won't be able to help you
[1:56:41] psychology won't be able to help you but
[1:56:43] the truth will be able to help you
[1:56:46] that's
[1:56:48] right amen Prophet said iniquity is
[1:56:51] abounding
[1:56:53] and we continue to do so now notice and
[1:56:57] I'll wrap it up thank you for your
[1:56:59] patience 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the
[1:57:02] mystery of iniquity do already work when
[1:57:04] did it start working in the first
[1:57:07] age well I I mean the white horse rider
[1:57:10] right we know it was in the garden
[1:57:12] but that white horse rider the mystery
[1:57:14] of iniquity doth already work now now
[1:57:17] notice iniquity is something that you
[1:57:19] know you ought not to do and you do it
[1:57:21] anyhow
[1:57:23] now Paul tells us in the fourth verse we
[1:57:25] just read the the SE the the the seventh
[1:57:28] verse where where the mystery of
[1:57:30] iniquity does already work but notice
[1:57:32] now uh in the fourth
[1:57:35] verse Paul tells us what this mystery of
[1:57:38] iniquity is who opposeth and exalteth
[1:57:42] himself above all that is called God or
[1:57:44] that is worshiped so that he as God sth
[1:57:47] in the temple of God showing himself
[1:57:50] that he is God ain't that right see so
[1:57:52] this mystery of iniquity had already
[1:57:54] been working down Through the Ages see
[1:57:57] with the the intent opposing exalting
[1:57:59] himself above all that is called God or
[1:58:02] that is worship so that he as God sth in
[1:58:05] the temple of God showing that he
[1:58:06] himself that he is God that's the one
[1:58:09] that started this false Vine that's the
[1:58:11] spirit that was in this false Vine
[1:58:14] exalting itself above God showing
[1:58:16] himself that it is God it is right it is
[1:58:19] righteous you understand we understand
[1:58:21] that this all going to wind end up in
[1:58:22] the man of sin amen and all these things
[1:58:25] amen but but there's been character
[1:58:27] traits all the way down Through the Ages
[1:58:30] and that vine that was started as a a
[1:58:32] small seed has been growing and growing
[1:58:34] and growing and growing till in this day
[1:58:37] it's come to full
[1:58:40] maturity ain't that right see and this
[1:58:42] mystery of iniquity has has abounded and
[1:58:45] is going to keep on abounding and
[1:58:47] because it is abounding people's love
[1:58:50] for God and the things of God are waxing
[1:58:54] cold now if you go in the ninth verse
[1:58:57] even him Who coming is after the working
[1:59:00] of Satan with all power signs and lying
[1:59:02] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[1:59:06] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:59:10] because they received not the love the
[1:59:12] of the truth notice it wasn't that the
[1:59:14] truth did not come to them amen it
[1:59:17] wasn't even that they did not see the
[1:59:19] truth they didn't have a love for the
[1:59:21] truth truth you understand what I'm
[1:59:23] saying amen see and that puts us now we
[1:59:26] that that puts us on danger ground
[1:59:28] because we know what God has done in
[1:59:30] this age and if we become to where we're
[1:59:32] not passionate about this message and we
[1:59:35] just just treat it like some of and we
[1:59:37] become a lukewarm Church a lukewarm
[1:59:40] individual a lukewarm family a lukewarm
[1:59:43] home amen something amen is not
[1:59:47] right they had not received not the love
[1:59:50] of the truth that they might be saved
[1:59:52] see amen see you got to receive a love
[1:59:55] for the truth not just having truth is
[1:59:58] going to save you you got to be
[2:00:00] passionate about it you got to love it
[2:00:03] enthus see amen uh uh for this cause God
[2:00:07] shall send them strong delusion see that
[2:00:10] they should believe a lie and that they
[2:00:12] all might be damned who believe not the
[2:00:14] truth but had pleasure and
[2:00:16] unrighteousness see so iniquity is
[2:00:19] abounding the people have rejected truth
[2:00:22] amen and if there's ever an age that
[2:00:24] iniquity is now coming and abounding and
[2:00:27] growing and and maturing it is now can
[2:00:30] you say man see so we we can truly say
[2:00:33] that iniquity is abounding Amen in the
[2:00:35] homes of the world in science in in in
[2:00:39] politics and Technology Amen in
[2:00:42] education in the church iniquity is
[2:00:46] abounding ain't that right amen look
[2:00:49] look at this uh scripture the Bible
[2:00:51] talks about those who are workers of
[2:00:52] iniquity amen uh Jesus speaking in Luke
[2:00:56] 13:24 strive to enter in at the Straight
[2:00:59] Gate for many I say unto you will seek
[2:01:02] to enter in and shall not be able to why
[2:01:05] they ain't been able to
[2:01:09] overcome
[2:01:11] hello they will seek to enter in and
[2:01:14] shall not be able when Once the Master
[2:01:17] of the House has risen up and have shut
[2:01:19] the door and has have shut to the door
[2:01:23] and you began to stand without and and
[2:01:26] to knock at the door saying Lord Lord
[2:01:28] open unto us and you and he shall answer
[2:01:32] and say unto you I I know you not whence
[2:01:35] you are then shall ye begin to say we
[2:01:38] have eaten and drunk in thy presence and
[2:01:41] thou Hast taught in our streets oh think
[2:01:45] of that in other words we know who you
[2:01:48] are we've been in your presence we are
[2:01:51] queen with you ain't that right so that
[2:01:54] is their their that that's their resume
[2:01:56] to him we've eaten and drunk in your
[2:01:59] pres we've gone the church we felt
[2:02:02] something and he shall say I tell you I
[2:02:05] know you not whence you are depart from
[2:02:07] me all ye workers of iniquity ain't that
[2:02:11] right Matthew 7:22 many will say unto me
[2:02:14] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[2:02:16] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[2:02:18] have cast out devils and in thy name
[2:02:20] done many wonderful works and then will
[2:02:22] I profess unto them I never knew you
[2:02:24] depart from me ye that work iniquity in
[2:02:27] other words brother Brown said these
[2:02:29] workers of iniquity are
[2:02:33] deceivers they come from that same
[2:02:35] Spirit opposing all that is of god
[2:02:38] called God Amen and and resisting and
[2:02:41] all these things see so this mystery of
[2:02:43] iniquity is the spirit of antichrist
[2:02:47] that started to ride in the first church
[2:02:49] age he as God sits in the temple of God
[2:02:52] calling himself god notice what brother
[2:02:54] brand said forgiving sins on Earth and
[2:02:58] that'll go on and iniquity shall abound
[2:03:01] and on can you say Amen see so so what
[2:03:05] is the danger in this Le oysan age the
[2:03:08] people having their sins forgiven by
[2:03:11] this mystery of iniquity this Antichrist
[2:03:15] spirit and not by God am amen can you
[2:03:21] say Amen
[2:03:22] this mystery of iniquity iniquity
[2:03:24] abounding and abounding amen and the
[2:03:27] people getting their sins forgiven by
[2:03:30] the spirit of iniquity now now notice
[2:03:33] Jesus gave the church he gave the church
[2:03:36] the power to remit sins um uh John 20
[2:03:40] and 22 and when he had said this he
[2:03:43] breathed on them and Sith unto them
[2:03:45] receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins
[2:03:48] you remit they are remitted unto them
[2:03:50] and whosoever sins you retain they are
[2:03:52] to retained ain't that right so this
[2:03:55] word remit means to forgive amen it it
[2:03:58] means to take away to remit is to take
[2:04:01] away see and and and and the Harlot
[2:04:03] Church claims to have power to remit
[2:04:06] sins and they do it notice brother BR
[2:04:10] and they do it they they claim to have
[2:04:12] the power to forgive to take sins away
[2:04:15] and they do it but they remit sins by
[2:04:19] their
[2:04:19] denominational power
[2:04:23] hello brother B said see look at their
[2:04:26] children every downa cut their hair
[2:04:30] painted up like clowns men out living
[2:04:32] with other men's wives flirting running
[2:04:35] around the street mix bathing everything
[2:04:37] else sure they forgive they remit sins
[2:04:39] in their own way but their fruit shows
[2:04:42] what it is hello Church see see not
[2:04:46] right for them no sir what do they do
[2:04:49] they wear shorts and cut their hair and
[2:04:51] wear their makeup Jesus said by their
[2:04:53] fruits you shall know they are known see
[2:04:55] the kind of seed that they
[2:04:57] are there is what it is see
[2:05:00] denominational seed gives denominational
[2:05:03] forgiveness and what has this mystery of
[2:05:06] iniquity have done it has produced a
[2:05:09] bunch of Le lukewarm leosa
[2:05:13] people hello that's right it's produced
[2:05:18] nothing but
[2:05:19] Hypocrites that do not see the need
[2:05:22] anymore to be fervent about the word of
[2:05:26] God any longer why they're
[2:05:30] okay pre hard at me I'll go somewhere
[2:05:33] else you got a smorgus board
[2:05:36] today church is just like going to
[2:05:39] restaurants you know I don't like this
[2:05:42] I'll just go somewhere
[2:05:45] else you understand what I'm
[2:05:47] saying M uh uh uh uh iniquity is is
[2:05:52] abounding abounding because there's a
[2:05:55] spirit of iniquity forgiving
[2:06:00] sins pardoning the
[2:06:04] people and what is this bunch of Le oysa
[2:06:07] doing brother brand said they're trying
[2:06:09] to bring on a millennium without
[2:06:12] repentance they're trying to bring world
[2:06:14] peace without
[2:06:15] repentance they're trying to bring back
[2:06:18] what what the church used to have
[2:06:20] without repentance
[2:06:24] that's can you say Amen see she claims
[2:06:28] power to forgive sins but you're not
[2:06:30] judged by your claims you're not known
[2:06:32] by your claims you're known by your
[2:06:34] Works how could she forgive sin look at
[2:06:40] her look at her she's anti word right in
[2:06:45] her teaching in her Worship in her
[2:06:48] Living anti- Word and then she's stands
[2:06:51] as the one to forgive the sins a it's
[2:06:54] okay you're all right you just keep go
[2:06:56] ahead Jesus loves
[2:07:05] you brother Bram said when Jesus did the
[2:07:08] same thing
[2:07:10] see he said you know they said he said
[2:07:13] condemn me show me where I disbelieve
[2:07:15] the word see she claims power to forgive
[2:07:18] sins but that only that comes only by
[2:07:21] the word amen everybody say that only
[2:07:23] comes by the
[2:07:25] word forgiveness only comes by the word
[2:07:28] see that's right God only can forgive
[2:07:31] sins that right didn't those Pharisees
[2:07:33] say that was see he said what was the
[2:07:36] matter with the with the blind bunch of
[2:07:38] Hypocrites see why because they didn't
[2:07:41] see that was the word standing with him
[2:07:44] he is the word glory to God that's the
[2:07:47] reason he could forgive sins he was God
[2:07:49] the word manifest
[2:07:52] another place he see the Holy Spirit
[2:07:54] Bears record of the predestinated gift
[2:07:56] that the church claims she has what by
[2:07:59] watering the word punctuating the word
[2:08:02] with an amen when it said repent and be
[2:08:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:08:08] amen when it says these other things
[2:08:11] amen that's it amen to everything it
[2:08:14] punctuates the word and God
[2:08:17] predestinated the gift to come to remit
[2:08:19] sins but it was given to the spirit
[2:08:22] filled word body cu the word can only
[2:08:26] forgive sins because the word is
[2:08:30] God yes sir you see how important it is
[2:08:34] and why we're blessed to have the
[2:08:37] word it's not
[2:08:40] sugarcoated but it just tells us where
[2:08:43] it's at amen but there's a blood in that
[2:08:46] word yes sir to forgive sins amen amen
[2:08:52] you love him amen so this false Church
[2:08:54] in closing the false Church claims to
[2:08:58] speak for
[2:08:59] God but she is no longer the God's
[2:09:03] mouthpiece see he said I'll spew you out
[2:09:06] God has spewed her out so she is no
[2:09:08] longer God's voice to the
[2:09:10] world but his voice is now in the bride
[2:09:15] Amen in the
[2:09:17] Overcomer can you say amen God still got
[2:09:20] a voice to this world
[2:09:21] and it's in the
[2:09:23] Overcomer amen so who is this bride it's
[2:09:26] the
[2:09:27] Overcomer what does she do she overcomes
[2:09:30] the age overcomes The Temptations of the
[2:09:33] age overcomes every denominational
[2:09:36] critic overcomes the popular sins of the
[2:09:39] age I'm reading what brother Bram says
[2:09:42] about overcoming overcomes the deception
[2:09:44] of the age I am rich and I have need of
[2:09:47] nothing I have see oh I'm all this and
[2:09:50] all this see and I'm I'm the bride see
[2:09:53] I'm this I have need of nothing and
[2:09:55] don't know that you are naked and blind
[2:09:58] see what does she do she overcomes all
[2:10:01] the worldly things of this
[2:10:04] age
[2:10:06] amen can she do it yes she can do it the
[2:10:10] Bible says she hath made herself ready
[2:10:14] she will stand as an
[2:10:17] overcomer withstanding every spirit in
[2:10:20] this age she will
[2:10:21] amen 2 Timothy 3:1 it says and know this
[2:10:26] also that in the last days in the last
[2:10:28] days and other words the expression in
[2:10:30] the last days refers to the time
[2:10:33] immediately preceding the Rapture of the
[2:10:35] church perilous times shall come see
[2:10:39] perilous times I looked up this word
[2:10:41] times it's it's a critical epic uh uh uh
[2:10:44] making period for ordained of God when
[2:10:48] all that has been slowly and often
[2:10:50] without a
[2:10:51] observation ripening through long ages
[2:10:55] is now mature and comes to the birth in
[2:10:57] Grand decisive
[2:10:59] events the last times perilous times can
[2:11:04] you say Amen so what started as just a
[2:11:06] little seed is now ripen the seed of
[2:11:09] deception has come to maturity the seed
[2:11:11] of rebellion has come to maturity the
[2:11:13] seed of religion has come to its
[2:11:15] fullness ain't that right brother Braham
[2:11:17] said the false Vine came into full fru
[2:11:20] in this age her fruit would mature and
[2:11:23] ripen that is correct this evil-spirit
[2:11:26] church full of iniquity will be revealed
[2:11:29] as the mustard seed that grew into a
[2:11:32] tree where in lodged the fowls of the
[2:11:35] air and at her head will be the
[2:11:37] Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all
[2:11:40] this is true and if this be true then it
[2:11:43] must also be true that the bride church
[2:11:46] WIll mature and her rightness shall be
[2:11:49] an identification with her Lord by means
[2:11:52] of the word and her head who will come
[2:11:54] to her is the mystery of godliness which
[2:11:57] indeed is Christ and as the false church
[2:12:00] with all cunning and diabolical uh uh
[2:12:04] Power diabolical power made up of
[2:12:06] political force physical force and
[2:12:09] demons of Darkness come against this
[2:12:11] True Vine the True Vine with the
[2:12:13] fullness of the spirit and the word will
[2:12:15] do the very acts of power that Jesus did
[2:12:18] then as she nears her headstone
[2:12:21] becoming like him through the word Jesus
[2:12:24] will come that the bride and groom may
[2:12:27] be forever
[2:12:29] United can you say Amen do you love him
[2:12:32] if the musicians will
[2:12:34] come amen now think of it now we're
[2:12:37] living in a day where Isaiah 541 is
[2:12:40] being fulfilled more are the children of
[2:12:43] the desolate than the children of the
[2:12:45] married wife sayith the Lord Luke 168
[2:12:49] Jesus said the children of this world
[2:12:50] are in their generation wiser than the
[2:12:54] children of light Isaiah 5:21 woe unto
[2:12:58] them that are wise in their own eyes and
[2:13:01] PR it in their own sight see so what is
[2:13:04] it speaking of the children of this
[2:13:06] world who are the children of the
[2:13:08] desolate ain't that right now we've
[2:13:11] talked about it before but notice Paul
[2:13:13] says perilous times or maybe Peter
[2:13:16] perilous times shall come the word
[2:13:19] perilous means dangerous it also means
[2:13:22] to lower to lower which comes from the
[2:13:25] idea of reducing strength so no wonder
[2:13:29] there is a great falling away in this
[2:13:31] age like never before because the people
[2:13:33] ain't got the strength to overcome
[2:13:37] they're too much in the world they're
[2:13:38] too much into this they're too much Le
[2:13:40] oosa you understand what I'm saying they
[2:13:42] they they've not kept their lamps
[2:13:44] trimmed they they've not kept the oil in
[2:13:46] their lamp you see they're not fervent
[2:13:49] they're not passionate about the word of
[2:13:51] of God and and their strength is being
[2:13:54] reduced there's no strength to overcome
[2:13:57] notice now they're not able to overcome
[2:13:59] worldliness they're not able to overcome
[2:14:01] the popular sin of the age they're not
[2:14:03] able to overcome anything see so now if
[2:14:07] you go back to 2 Timothy 2:5 men shall
[2:14:10] be lovers of their own selves Covetous
[2:14:13] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[2:14:16] to parents unthankful Unholy without
[2:14:18] natural affection truce Breakers false
[2:14:21] accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[2:14:25] those that are good traitors he
[2:14:27] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[2:14:30] lovers of God and all of that having a
[2:14:33] form of godliness but denying the power
[2:14:36] thereof from such turn
[2:14:40] away so you see why this world is headed
[2:14:43] to
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:48] tribulation there's nothing to look for
[2:14:51] forward to in this
[2:14:54] age I know they keep prophesying about
[2:14:56] revivals and great things but a prophet
[2:15:00] said it ain't
[2:15:02] happening the next thing is
[2:15:05] tribulation but why what is the
[2:15:08] Tribulation it's God fulfilling his word
[2:15:12] notice here in Isaiah
[2:15:14] 13 and 9 through 11 behold the day of
[2:15:18] the Lord cometh cruel both with wrath
[2:15:22] and fierce anger to lay the land
[2:15:24] desolate and he shall destroy the
[2:15:26] Sinners thereof out of it for the stars
[2:15:30] of Heaven and the constellations thereof
[2:15:32] shall not give their light the sun shall
[2:15:34] be darkened in is gone forth and the
[2:15:36] moon shall not cause her light to shine
[2:15:39] and I will punish the world for their
[2:15:41] evil and the wicked for their iniquity
[2:15:45] and I will cause the arrogancy of The
[2:15:47] Proud to cease and will lay low the
[2:15:50] hotess
[2:15:51] of the terrible can you say
[2:15:55] Amen so what is that Overcomer brother
[2:15:58] Bram said the Overcomer is the man that
[2:16:00] really sits down and throws aside
[2:16:03] everything else besides the
[2:16:06] word throws aside everything
[2:16:11] else the Overcomer says I don't care how
[2:16:14] I feel the word says
[2:16:17] this I don't care what other people say
[2:16:20] or do the word says this I don't care
[2:16:23] what the doctor says the word says this
[2:16:27] I don't care what denominations say the
[2:16:29] word says this right I don't care what
[2:16:32] looks to be right the word says this I
[2:16:36] don't care if everybody else is doing it
[2:16:38] the word says this see that's the
[2:16:41] Overcomer not going with the the
[2:16:45] current but standing
[2:16:48] strong with Bible conviction
[2:16:52] can you say
[2:16:54] Amen one more quote brother Bram said
[2:16:57] the word has to come to pass it's God's
[2:17:01] word plant it in your heart if you want
[2:17:05] to go in a
[2:17:06] Rapture if you want to be Christians
[2:17:09] genuine Christians place this
[2:17:13] word as I believe it was Ezekiel God
[2:17:15] said take that scroll and eat it up that
[2:17:18] the prophet and the word would become
[2:17:20] the same
[2:17:21] and every promise in there has to
[2:17:23] manifest itself because it's God's
[2:17:25] original seed don't you let some
[2:17:28] educated Theologian out here try to pump
[2:17:31] it out of you don't you let him spray
[2:17:34] you with that carnal science and
[2:17:36] knowledge and
[2:17:38] education you believe
