[26:02] we want to look here in the third verse
[26:04] just before we read the word let's just
[26:06] buy our hearts together for a word of
[26:09] prayer and how many would say Lord speak
[26:10] to me tonight amen he sees every hand
[26:13] Heavenly Father
[26:14] Thy word is true here tonight and Lord
[26:16] as we stand here we are very well aware
[26:19] that we're not Lord just in a building
[26:21] Lord that's been set aside to be called
[26:23] a church but Lord we're in your presence
[26:26] and father where two or three are
[26:27] gathered together Lord in your name you
[26:30] said that you would come and be in our
[26:31] midst and Lord as I look around here
[26:33] tonight there's more than two or three
[26:35] but there's a whole house full of
[26:37] Believers here tonight Lord that believe
[26:39] you and they love you and father we're
[26:41] endeavoring to diligently seek after
[26:43] your will and seek after your ways
[26:45] father Lord as we come to this portion
[26:47] of the service tonight we know that Lord
[26:49] any service is not complete without the
[26:51] preaching of your word and or do you see
[26:53] these things that you've laid up on my
[26:55] heart these thoughts tonight God I pray
[26:57] or that some way somehow you would take
[26:59] these things and Lord may you
[27:00] positionally place him in the hearts of
[27:03] your Believers Lord that father as your
[27:05] word is being preached Lord May healing

[27:28] will Lord have your way among the sword
[27:29] we we give you this service we surrender
[27:32] everything we are into your hands Lord
[27:33] we don't want to be in control of
[27:35] anything we want you to have the way
[27:37] your way in everything now Lord we pray
[27:39] you bless this meeting with your
[27:40] presence in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[27:42] and all the believer says
[27:45] amen and amen the book of Ephesians the
[27:48] first chapter and I want to look here in
[27:50] the third verse of Ephesians chapter 1
[27:53] and verse 3.
[27:54] Paul here writing very familiar reading
[27:57] he says blessed be the God and father of
[28:00] our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:02] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[28:06] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[28:09] now there's one thing that really stands
[28:12] out to me is he's not going to do this
[28:14] in the future and he's not saying I'm
[28:16] doing this right now but he actually has
[28:18] done this it was something that was done
[28:20] in eternity that you're actually
[28:22] catching up with in time who hath
[28:24] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[28:27] in Heavenly places in Christ now if we
[28:30] could also look at one of their passages
[28:31] scripture in the book of Hebrews the
[28:33] book of Hebrews the sixth chapter
[28:36] the book of Hebrews 6 and I want to look
[28:38] there in the 19th verse another very
[28:41] familiar reading in Hebrews 6 and verse
[28:44] 19 Paul here writing he says which hope
[28:47] we have as an anchor of the Soul
[28:50] both sure and steadfast and which
[28:53] entereth into that within the veil amen
[28:57] let's just read that 19th verse together
[28:59] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[29:03] Soul both sure and steadfast and which
[29:06] entireth into that within the veil we
[29:09] ask the Lord this evening to add the
[29:11] blessing to the reading of his word as
[29:12] you can be seated here this afternoon I
[29:14] want tonight just to speak to here for a
[29:17] few moments and if I well title this
[29:19] tonight I want to speak to you on a
[29:20] little thought here the Lord has given
[29:22] me I've just been preaching a little bit
[29:24] on the field a little bit with it so I
[29:25] pray maybe just share a few things from
[29:27] it tonight but I want to speak to you on
[29:29] we are heavenlies in our souls we are
[29:32] heavenlies in our souls now when you
[29:35] look at that word heavenlies it actually
[29:36] uh just a very simple definition
[29:39] but it is suggesting uh the Blessed
[29:42] state of heaven so in other words it's
[29:45] actually telling us that the the
[29:46] blessedness or the delightfulness or the
[29:49] the serenity or the peace amen of what's
[29:51] going on in heaven is actually come into
[29:54] the souls of human beings now as we have
[29:57] read from the book of Ephesians you know
[29:58] that the prophet says that Ephesians
[30:00] parallels the Book of Joshua right he
[30:03] said you could read Joshua and it's like
[30:04] reading Ephesians in the New Testament
[30:06] read Ephesians it's like reading Joshua
[30:08] in the Old Testament and brother Bram
[30:10] says in this adoption series number one
[30:12] he said now the book of Ephesians places
[30:15] us positionally in Christ that's what
[30:17] the book of Ephesians does it places us
[30:19] positionally in Christ what they was in
[30:22] the Holy Land see but we are not placed
[30:24] in the Holy Land amen but we are placed
[30:27] in the Holy Ghost so amen as Joshua was
[30:30] placing tribes into the Holy Land
[30:33] remember said the Holy Ghost is not here
[30:35] placed in the church in a holy land he
[30:38] said but it's your place in the Holy
[30:39] ghost in the people and placing them in
[30:42] the Holy Ghost now when you start
[30:43] talking about that the first word that
[30:45] jumps out to you is Holy right the Holy
[30:48] Land the Holy Ghost and then breaks it
[30:50] down he says see but there is no holy
[30:53] man there is no holy church
[30:56] excuse me he said it's a holy ghost
[30:58] right not a holy church not a holy
[31:01] people but it's the Holy Ghost among the
[31:03] people he said that's what it is
[31:06] he said not a Holy Mountain where Peter
[31:09] and them stood the mountain wasn't holy
[31:11] he said but it's the holy God on the
[31:13] mountain is what made it holy now amen
[31:16] he says see it's not a holy person
[31:18] it's the holy ghost that is used in that
[31:22] person is what makes it holy not the
[31:24] person but the person of the Holy Ghost
[31:27] so amen the book of Ephesians is
[31:29] positionally placed in the holy ghost in
[31:31] a people that is separating them from
[31:34] the things of the world it is separating
[31:36] them from the ideas of denomination it
[31:38] is bringing them to a position in Christ
[31:40] now as we start looking at this you all
[31:42] know this quote by heart but the prophet
[31:44] of God says we are promised another
[31:46] Ephesians right we are promised another
[31:48] Ephesians and I believe that that
[31:50] another Ephesian is actually going to
[31:52] produce another Exodus but remember said
[31:54] like this he said we are promised
[31:56] according to Revelation 10 and Malachi 4
[31:58] and Luke 17 30. and so forth that there
[32:01] has got to come and Ephesians to this
[32:03] there is promised it friends there must
[32:05] come in Ephesians that these Sevenfold
[32:07] Mysteries of the word of God he said
[32:09] they must be unfolded and it's in the
[32:11] laodicean age that this takes place he
[32:14] said I believe that we're here I believe
[32:16] that we're right in the shadows of the
[32:18] coming of the the Son of God and as
[32:20] Joshua just before the Ephesians raised
[32:22] up he said so did John the Baptist raise
[32:25] up before the next Ephesian and were
[32:27] promised another Ephesian now think
[32:29] about that John the Baptist raised up
[32:31] right before that Ephesian he said and
[32:33] we're promised another Ephesians it's
[32:35] predicted here in the scripture
[32:37] therefore I think we are living in the
[32:39] Ephesians again we are promised that
[32:42] what was left off during those Seven
[32:44] Ages so we are not amen we we are
[32:46] promised what was left off is going to
[32:48] be given to the church in this age he
[32:51] said in God rich and mercy now we find
[32:53] that we have come to another Ephesian he
[32:55] said another emphasis now where that
[32:57] inner intellectual denominations and so
[32:59] forth all of our educational programs
[33:01] has come to its Jordan he said then we
[33:03] must have in Ephesians again
[33:06] we must have and Ephesians again he said
[33:09] we must have an exodus Amen to come out
[33:12] of and to go into for the Rapture so the
[33:15] Holy Ghost is not positionally placing
[33:17] you amen for another age he's not
[33:19] positionally placing you for another
[33:21] Revival or just another a move of God
[33:23] but he's actually positionally placing
[33:26] you amen for The Exodus or for the
[33:28] Rapture or for the changing of your body
[33:30] so I can say that you like me I said the
[33:32] book of Ephesians amen is not addressed
[33:34] to the unbeliever right the book of
[33:36] Ephesians is not addressed to the
[33:38] make-believer but the book of Ephesians
[33:40] is addressed to the believer amen and as
[33:42] a Believer we find that there's actually
[33:44] desires that a Believer has amen that an
[33:47] unbeliever does not have there's
[33:49] actually desires that a Believer has
[33:50] that a make-believer does not have right
[33:53] I was listening today the prophet
[33:54] preaching three kinds of Believers he
[33:56] said it's very easy to identify amen
[33:58] three kinds of Believers he said the
[34:00] believer is genuine he believes the word
[34:02] of God regardless he said the
[34:04] make-believer he said he hangs on long
[34:06] enough to find some fault or find
[34:08] something wrong he said the unbeliever
[34:10] he said he just gets up and walks out
[34:12] he'd been very simple way to identify
[34:14] amen which believer you are amen a
[34:17] Believer believes the word regardless
[34:19] right amen a make-believer believes it
[34:21] until they find some fault and then they
[34:23] found something they can emphasize upon
[34:25] amen but an unbeliever won't even set to
[34:28] hear it but thank God tonight amen that
[34:30] the word has separated us and has
[34:32] identified us not as unbelievers amen
[34:35] and not as make-believers but we have
[34:37] been identified amen not even as
[34:39] borderline Believers but we've been
[34:41] identified amen is genuine field
[34:44] Believers with the spirit of God and
[34:46] then as a Believer there is desires now
[34:48] I said to you like this I find two
[34:50] desires right there in Ephesians 1 3
[34:52] amen the first desire amen is the
[34:55] believer desire spiritual blessings
[34:58] any believers here tonight amen you
[35:01] desire spiritual blessings amen then the
[35:03] second desire of the believer amen is
[35:06] Heavenly places amen they desire
[35:08] spiritual blessings and they desire
[35:10] Heavenly places now amen I said like
[35:12] this the Believers desire amen is a
[35:15] spiritual desire look what David says in
[35:18] Psalms 27 4 he said one thing have a
[35:20] desire to the Lord amen that will I seek
[35:22] after that I may dwell in the house of
[35:24] the Lord amen all the days of my life to
[35:27] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[35:29] inquire in his temple in Psalms 38 verse
[35:32] 9 David said Lord All My Desire is
[35:34] before thee and my groanings is not hid
[35:37] from thee in Psalm 63 verse 1 he said oh
[35:40] God Thou Art my God Amen early will I
[35:42] seek thee for my soul thirsteth for thee
[35:45] now watch here amen David has just
[35:47] identified what is thirsting after God
[35:49] Amen is his soul he said my soul
[35:51] thirsteth for thee amen and my flesh
[35:54] longest for thee in a dry and thirsty
[35:56] land amen where no water is see thy
[35:59] power and deceive thy glory amen so as I
[36:01] have seen thee in the sanctuary look at
[36:03] what Isaiah says in Isaiah 26 9 he said
[36:06] with My Soul have I desired thee in the
[36:09] ninth season amen yea my spirit Within
[36:11] Me will I seek thee early for when thy
[36:14] judgments are in the earth and the
[36:15] inhabitants of the world Amen will learn
[36:18] righteousness Jesus said in Luke 6 21 he
[36:21] said blessed are ye that hunger now for
[36:23] you shall be filled amen see I'm
[36:25] thankful tonight to say to you that we
[36:28] are serving a God that can make our
[36:30] desires a reality amen we're serving of
[36:32] God that if you've got a desire here
[36:34] tonight for a an answer there's a God in
[36:37] the building that can give you an answer
[36:38] if you've got to desire for a healing
[36:40] there's a Healer in the room amen that
[36:42] can give you the healing if you've got a
[36:44] desire for a victory amen there's a
[36:46] captain of the host of the Lord amen
[36:48] that's in the church tonight and he's
[36:50] here to do more than just stimulate your
[36:52] flesh he's here to do more than just
[36:54] give you an emotional high but he has
[36:56] come down in the midst of the church to
[36:58] me our desires amen a reality Our God
[37:01] Amen can make our desires a reality amen
[37:05] now you know I can go very deep on this
[37:07] thought because the prophet did he said
[37:09] before there can be a creation amen
[37:11] there has to be a creator
[37:14] Brian he said before there was a fan on
[37:17] a fish's back he said there was a water
[37:19] for the fish to swim in he said before
[37:21] there was an apple tree on the earth he
[37:23] said there was an Earth for that apple
[37:25] tree to grow out of Amen in other words
[37:27] before there can be a desire he said
[37:30] there has to be something to fulfill
[37:32] that desire listen friends if you've got
[37:34] to desire here tonight and it's a word
[37:36] based desire amen it's a scriptural
[37:39] desire it's a spiritual desire then
[37:41] there is a God who can come on the scene
[37:44] and can manifest the reality of that
[37:46] desire I think of in the Book of John
[37:48] the 12th chapter the Bible says they
[37:50] came there for the Philip which was a
[37:52] Bethesda of Galilee and what did they do
[37:54] they desired him saying amen their
[37:58] speech was coming from their desires
[37:59] amen they desired him saying sir amen we
[38:03] would see Jesus Remember said our hearts
[38:06] are just as hungry tonight amen to see
[38:08] Jesus Christ as those Greeks were he
[38:10] said because no one can ever hear of him
[38:13] amen that would not more to see him see
[38:15] he said it's been my heart's desire Amen
[38:19] to know the reality amen no one can hear
[38:22] of him amen without there being a desire
[38:24] to see him no one can read about him
[38:27] without there being a desire Amen to
[38:29] meet him let me say this tonight amen
[38:31] and our hearts don't have to leave the
[38:33] house of God empty we don't have to
[38:35] leave here without one thing amen by
[38:37] what God has promised we can have in the
[38:40] age we're living and our God is a god of
[38:42] reality and if he's a god of reality
[38:44] he's been in spiritual blessings are a
[38:47] reality if he's a god of reality then
[38:50] Heavenly places amen are not just some
[38:52] pipe dream somewhere amen but there's a
[38:54] God of those heavenly places there's a
[38:57] God of those spiritual blessings there's
[38:58] a God who can come down in the church
[39:00] tonight and can lift you up out of the
[39:02] situations of your life he can lift you
[39:04] up out of the circumstances listen amen
[39:07] I know we're living in some dark times I
[39:09] know we're living in some confusion
[39:10] times amen but don't forget what you got
[39:12] on the inside of you you may have a lot
[39:15] of trouble you may have a lot of
[39:16] circumstances but on the depths of the
[39:18] depths of your body there is a soul and
[39:21] that soul is not anchored in the White
[39:23] House in Washington that soul is not
[39:25] anchored in the church house here in
[39:26] Virginia amen but that soul is hankered
[39:29] Amen in the eternities of eternities
[39:31] Amen where there's a living God who can
[39:33] move upon that Soul hey our God is a
[39:36] living God he's a god of reality he's a
[39:39] God that does more than give you desires
[39:40] amen but he gives you the desire he
[39:43] gives you the reality to that desire
[39:45] then I say tonight Heavenly places are
[39:47] real
[39:49] if you agree with me Heavenly places are
[39:52] real now when brother bran preaches
[39:53] adoption this is actually where I picked
[39:55] up this title from in the adoption part
[39:58] one he actually takes time to break down
[40:00] Ephesians 1 3. I know you know this but
[40:02] this let me share it with you he said in
[40:04] Heavenly places now you're not just out
[40:06] anywhere everybody in Heavenly places he
[40:08] said we are assembled in Heavenly it
[40:10] means amen that's the position of the
[40:13] believer he said that if I'm prayed up
[40:15] and you're prayed up or the church is
[40:17] prayed up he said and we're ready for
[40:19] the message we've assembled ourselves
[40:21] together amen as Saints called out
[40:23] elected baptized with the Holy Ghost
[40:25] filled with God's blessings he said
[40:27] called elected set together in Heavenly
[40:29] places now now watch what he says we are
[40:32] heavenlies in our souls
[40:35] amen we are heavenlies in our souls amen
[40:38] our Spirits has been brought us in to a
[40:41] Heavenly atmosphere brother there you
[40:43] are a Heavenly atmosphere he said then
[40:45] what could happen tonight if we would be
[40:48] sitting here in a Heavenly atmosphere
[40:49] and the Holy Spirit moving every heart
[40:52] that's been regenerated and become a new
[40:54] creature in Christ Jesus he said all
[40:57] sins are under the blood Amen in perfect
[40:59] worship with our hands up to God and our
[41:02] hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places
[41:03] in Christ Jesus worshiping together in
[41:06] the Heavenly places he said did you ever
[41:08] sit in one oh I have amen till I would
[41:10] wheat for joy and say God never let me
[41:13] leave here just Heavenly places in
[41:16] Christ Jesus now amen I could stop there
[41:18] and preach for a few moments amen
[41:20] because notice where he identified the
[41:22] heavenly's word he did not say you were
[41:25] heavenlies in your body he did not even
[41:27] say you were heavilies in your spirit he
[41:29] said but we are heavenlies in our souls
[41:32] amen now you all know as well as high
[41:34] amen that it's Wednesday night and your
[41:36] bodies are tired amen your minds are
[41:39] weary you've been through some things
[41:40] today you're facing some things tomorrow
[41:42] amen and right now you're pressing but
[41:44] you're pressing with everything that's
[41:46] within you just to be in this service
[41:48] amen your bodies are tired amen your
[41:50] spirits are low amen but let me ask you
[41:53] this why are you here tonight are you
[41:55] here because your heavenly's in your
[41:57] body are you here because your Heaven is
[41:59] in your spirit amen the reason why
[42:01] you're here tonight amen is because you
[42:03] are heavenlies in your soul if it was up
[42:06] to your body you wouldn't be in the
[42:07] church house tonight if it was up to
[42:09] your spirits you wouldn't be raising
[42:11] your hands amen but do you know I
[42:13] sometimes slow Services amen turn into
[42:15] blowouts do you know why sometimes slow
[42:17] song Services amen turn into spontaneous
[42:20] worship Services amen is because there's
[42:22] a soul in there and that Soul has broke
[42:25] beyond these Earthbound elements amen
[42:27] and the soul is not controlled amen by
[42:30] the condition of the body amen the soul
[42:32] is not controlled by the condition of
[42:34] the spirit remember the soul is
[42:36] controlled by the authority of God's
[42:38] word and it's been revealed in the age
[42:40] you're living amen then there's a
[42:42] revelation in your soul amen that no
[42:44] matter how sick I am amen my God is here
[42:47] no matter how bound I am my God is a
[42:50] deliverer Oh Glory to God you see where
[42:52] that's coming from it's coming from your
[42:54] soul
[42:56] well you know I'm telling you the truth
[42:58] if it was up to your body you wouldn't
[42:59] get out of bed on Sunday morning if it
[43:01] was up to your body you wouldn't raise
[43:03] your hands amen some people didn't give
[43:05] in their body they don't get up on
[43:06] Sunday mornings and come to church no
[43:07] more amen but there's some amen there's
[43:10] still moved by their souls y'all know
[43:13] what I'm talking about you've come to
[43:14] church on Wednesday nights amen and your
[43:16] body's been against you your spirit's
[43:18] been against you everything's been
[43:20] against you amen and you've got enough
[43:22] courage to make it to the house of God
[43:24] and you come in on a Wednesday night and
[43:26] you sit down amen and your body said
[43:28] just be thankful you got here and your
[43:31] spirit said I hope nobody looks
[43:38] body and your spirit made an agreement
[43:40] and she wasn't going to get a blessing
[43:42] out of that service amen your body and
[43:44] your spirit made an agreement that you
[43:45] weren't going to get nothing out of the
[43:47] preaching amen but when you got in the
[43:49] building amen and the songs of Zion
[43:51] begin to Be Sung amen the atmosphere
[43:54] began to turn into a Heavenly atmosphere
[43:56] amen and from your soul your spirit
[43:59] began to be lifted up amen and then
[44:01] those hands had said they weren't going
[44:03] to wave and those hands that said they
[44:05] weren't going to clap and those hands
[44:07] just said they weren't going to give God
[44:08] praise Amen in a few moments you broke
[44:10] out of this Earthbound chatter
[44:12] chattering and you broke into rim and
[44:15] your body was too and amen what it said
[44:17] it wasn't going to do and you know why
[44:19] that was because you are heavenlies in
[44:21] your soul amen you are heavenlies in
[44:25] your soul amen amen I love what Paul's
[44:27] saying he said blessing us with all
[44:29] spiritual blessings amen breaks that
[44:31] down he said blessing us with what amen
[44:33] with Divine Healing with foreknowledge
[44:36] with Revelation now notice this Visions
[44:38] Powers tongues interpretation wisdom
[44:41] amen knowledge all the Heavenly
[44:43] blessings amen joy unspeakable and full
[44:46] of Glory he said every heart is filled
[44:48] with a spirit walking together sitting
[44:50] together in Heavenly places there's not
[44:53] one evil thought Among Us there's not
[44:55] one cigarette smoked there's not one
[44:57] short dress not one this that or the
[44:59] other amen not one evil thought amen not
[45:02] nobody got anything against one another
[45:04] everybody's speaking in love and harmony
[45:06] everybody with one Accord in one place
[45:09] and then suddenly there came from Heaven
[45:11] a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind he
[45:14] said there you are amen he has blessed
[45:16] us with all spiritual blessings he has
[45:19] blessed us with all spiritual blessing
[45:21] amen I don't have time to preach on all
[45:24] the spiritual blessing but there's one
[45:25] brother Amos that just jumped out and
[45:27] got me and it was Revelation amen one of
[45:30] the spiritual blessings amen that God
[45:33] has given the church amen is revelation
[45:36] now when you start looking at this
[45:37] thought between the soul and the body
[45:40] and the spirit in 1961 remembers ask the
[45:42] question please explain the difference
[45:44] between the spirit and the Soul he said
[45:47] well now that's a hard one he said but
[45:49] the first thing you are a Triune being
[45:51] amen just like Father Son and Holy Ghost
[45:54] everybody agree you're a Triune being
[45:56] just like father son Holy Ghost see he
[45:59] said three titles going to one person
[46:01] which is Jesus Christ and you are a soul
[46:04] you're a body and you're a spirit but it
[46:06] takes those three to make you with just
[46:09] one of them amen you're not you so it
[46:11] takes the three to make you he said like
[46:13] I said the other day this is my hand
[46:15] this is my this is my ear this is my
[46:17] nose amen this is my finger amen but who
[46:20] is me he said see now notice this if the
[46:23] eye if the hand if the body stood here
[46:25] just as it is today my body could be
[46:27] here but me could be gone
[46:30] my body could be here but me could be
[46:33] gone he said then what am I whoever I am
[46:36] is inside of me has gone on he said
[46:38] that's the part that is the spirit now
[46:40] watch this the soul he said is the
[46:43] nature of that spirit amen the soul is
[46:46] the nature of that spirit that when the
[46:48] Holy Ghost comes upon you it does not do
[46:51] nothing it changes amen or converts your
[46:54] spirit to a different soul he said in
[46:56] that soul is a different nature that's
[46:58] on the spirit he said so the soul is the
[47:01] nature of your spirit he said first you
[47:03] were mean and evil and hatred and Malice
[47:05] and strive amen you were not loving but
[47:07] now you are sweet and you're loving and
[47:10] you're kind do you see the difference
[47:11] it's your nature see it's your soul
[47:13] that's been changed amen the old now
[47:16] listen what he says the old soul died
[47:18] and the new Soul which is the new nature
[47:21] Was Born Into You amen it wasn't Two
[47:23] Souls amen It Was the Same Soul it went
[47:26] through a process of regeneration amen
[47:29] and the old soul the old man teacher
[47:31] died amen and the new Soul which was the
[47:33] new nature came into you he said see and
[47:36] the soul of the spirit amen is what
[47:38] controls the spirit that controls the
[47:40] body now watch this brother Branham is
[47:42] not speaking from the outside in he's
[47:45] speaking from the inside out he's not
[47:47] saying it's your body that controls your
[47:49] spirit that controls your soul but he's
[47:51] saying if there's a nature change oh God
[47:53] if there's a nature change on the inside
[47:55] of that little compartment in the heart
[47:57] called the soul and the old nature dies
[48:00] and the new man the new nature takes
[48:02] preeminence amen then the new nature
[48:04] will control the spirit amen and it will
[48:06] control the body right amen see in other
[48:09] words as a Believer you are a twofold
[48:11] being
[48:12] right you're a twofold being amen said
[48:16] like this she said if you got the Holy
[48:17] Spirit In You amen then you are a
[48:19] candidate for association with the
[48:21] Unseen World and the supernatural amen
[48:23] no wonder people can't believe in those
[48:25] things he said they've never come in
[48:27] contact they got nothing in here to
[48:29] believe with but when the Holy Spirit
[48:31] comes into the heart he said quickly he
[48:34] becomes then a twofold being he said one
[48:37] of the earth to die amen but one of the
[48:40] Heavens to live amen your body is of the
[48:43] earth to die amen but there's a soul in
[48:46] there and that soul is of the Heavens to
[48:49] live he said in this body he's still
[48:51] subject to death but in his soul he has
[48:54] passed from Death unto life in his body
[48:56] he has Earthly contact with five senses
[48:59] amen but in his Spirit he has a contact
[49:01] with God through the Holy Ghost and the
[49:04] angels of God this it's them and speaks
[49:06] with them and they are messengers sent
[49:08] from God to reveal and to bring messages
[49:10] from God Amen to this individual listen
[49:13] right now I see your body right now I
[49:16] see a twofold part of you and that's
[49:18] your body and it's of the earth and it's
[49:21] subject to die amen but the reason I'm
[49:23] preaching tonight with everything within
[49:25] me is cause I'm not looking at your body
[49:27] amen alone but I'm looking at a soul by
[49:30] the word amen and this body is subject
[49:34] this body is subject to sickness it's
[49:37] subject to disease it's subject to bad
[49:39] days it's subject to Hard Times amen but
[49:42] there's a soul in there and that soul is
[49:44] not subject to what this body is subject
[49:46] to you say why amen because the soul has
[49:50] passed from death and to life listen
[49:52] friends amen it's not your soul that
[49:54] depresses you it's your body that
[49:55] depresses you it's not your soul that
[49:58] says you're not going to make it it's
[49:59] your body that says you're not going to
[50:01] make it come on you know I'm preaching
[50:02] to you amen your body and your spirit
[50:04] will team up on you and before long
[50:06] they'll have you convinced nobody loves
[50:08] you you ain't worthy to be in the bride
[50:10] you ain't good enough to be a part of
[50:12] the church amen I tell you where that's
[50:13] coming from it's coming from your body
[50:15] and your spirit amen that there's a soul
[50:18] in there and if the Holy Ghost is on
[50:20] that Soul it'll bring that body and
[50:23] spirit subject and your body will have
[50:25] to obey the confession of your soul my
[50:28] we need the holy spirit amen not just
[50:31] Upon Our flesh not just in our spirits
[50:34] but we need the Holy Ghost in our souls
[50:38] the proud of God said the leadership of
[50:40] the Holy Ghost decide and the church is
[50:42] nothing but the world Amen with God's
[50:44] name attached to it amen the world and
[50:46] the church are all the same lump they're
[50:48] just like Jacob and Esau were the same
[50:50] parents amen but the spirit of God makes
[50:53] a difference amen the spirit of God
[50:56] makes the difference amen it doesn't
[50:58] matter if you call yourself a Christian
[50:59] anyone can do that amen but the point is
[51:02] whether or not you have the spirit of
[51:04] God in you for without the spirit you
[51:07] are a reprobate amen and you are none of
[51:09] his amen without the spirit of God you
[51:12] are a reprobate and we are none of his
[51:14] you say then why are you preaching so
[51:16] hard about the leadership of the Holy
[51:19] Ghost being on the soul amen because we
[51:21] are motivated by Spirits you know
[51:23] Birmingham sit behind everything brother
[51:25] Sammy said behind everything there is a
[51:27] spirit he said there's a spirit behind
[51:29] television there's a spirit behind
[51:31] Hollywood now come on we might as well
[51:33] preach we're here amen behind and
[51:35] everything there is a spirit so the
[51:37] motivation to everything you see is a
[51:39] spirit you see people say to me of time
[51:41] they said with Andrew they say why amen
[51:43] do you preach against skinny jeans why
[51:44] do you preach against this why do you
[51:46] preach against that amen if you could
[51:47] only realize we're not preaching against
[51:48] the person wearing it amen we're
[51:51] preaching against the spirit amen that
[51:53] obviously they're ignorant of that's
[51:54] motivating them to wear I'm on y'all
[51:56] know I'm telling you the truth what boy
[51:58] in his right mind puts on a pair of
[52:00] jeans amen they're skinnier than any so
[52:02] that's more skin tied amen than any
[52:04] dress Hollywood's ever made I tell you
[52:06] what kind of spirit it is it's a spirit
[52:08] from pale that come into Hollywood
[52:10] that's been labeled fashion amen and a
[52:13] man of God got a backbone about him amen
[52:15] he'll strike that spirit and give the
[52:17] young person or the man enough courage
[52:19] Amen to rebuke that spirit and accept
[52:22] their deliverance from Hell come on
[52:23] you'll say well I don't know why he's
[52:25] always preaching against television amen
[52:27] ain't nothing wrong with the television
[52:28] ain't nothing wrong with a box ain't
[52:30] nothing wrong with the wires what's
[52:31] wrong is the spirit that's motivating
[52:33] the picture that's being put on the
[52:35] thing that's found the Liberty in your
[52:37] home oh come on church amen if you want
[52:39] to overcome Some Devil start recognizing
[52:41] in the infancy of the spirit of them
[52:45] and drive them out of your life amen
[52:48] it's a motivation of spirits it's
[52:50] something trying to get at your soul to
[52:52] bring you in a condition that God never
[52:54] intended for you to be him he said
[52:56] whatever your spirit is moves you you
[52:59] are motivated by a spirit and if the
[53:01] spirit of Jesus Christ is in the
[53:03] Christian the believer no wonder he's a
[53:05] peculiar person no wonder there's
[53:07] something moving in him because God is
[53:10] in him and the spirit of Christ is
[53:12] motivating him and he has to move as the
[53:15] spirit moves him could you imagine
[53:16] seeing John walk down there and say oh
[53:18] that's all right and this is all right
[53:20] as long as the spirit of Elijah was on
[53:23] him he acted like Elijah when you take
[53:26] these people that ghost now starts off
[53:28] and says oh I'm going to be a Christian
[53:29] and they start off all right but the
[53:31] first thing in about six months are all
[53:33] gummed up and going back he said you can
[53:35] tell right then amen that the
[53:37] anointing's leaving them somebody say
[53:40] that with me the anointing is leaving
[53:42] them they start off with a confession
[53:44] I'm going to be a Christian but in about
[53:46] six months and then they start pulling
[53:48] back program identify what's causing he
[53:50] said the anointing is leaving them then
[53:53] let me ask you what God on them amen
[53:55] that moved him to that confession that
[53:57] they were going to be a Christian I'll
[53:59] tell you what done it was the anointing
[54:02] the anointing God on them that moved him
[54:05] to a confession I'm going to be a
[54:07] Christian amen but he said watch the
[54:09] anointings leaving them he said for as
[54:11] long as the spirit of Christ is in you
[54:14] it'll make you Christ like as long as
[54:17] the spirit of Christ is in you it will
[54:20] make you Christ like now notice here as
[54:22] long as the anointing amen is in you it
[54:25] will make you Christ like then I say to
[54:27] you tonight amen that the anointing
[54:29] can't just be upon us and the anointing
[54:31] can't just be around us amen but the
[54:33] anointing has got to be in you and you
[54:36] have got to be in the anointing if
[54:38] you're going to have the strength Amen
[54:40] to hold your Christian confession the
[54:42] anointing is going to have to be in your
[54:44] church it can't just be on you in
[54:46] special meetings it can't just be on you
[54:48] in the church's field and there's a
[54:50] bunch of visitors and we're all shouting
[54:51] amen but on a Wednesday night on a slow
[54:53] service and a high service amen if the
[54:56] anointing is in you regardless of the
[54:58] conditions of your body regardless of
[55:00] the conditions of your spirit you can
[55:02] stand up in the middle of church and say
[55:04] no matter what my body and my spirit is
[55:06] trying to scheme up against me in my
[55:09] soul I am a believer in my soul I am a
[55:12] Son of God in my soul I am a daughter of
[55:15] God the anoint is not just told me to
[55:17] shout he anointed he's not just told me
[55:19] to dance amen but the anointing is in my
[55:22] soul that's the very life of God could
[55:24] be lived out through my flesh
[55:26] oh the anointing's got to be in you
[55:29] and you got to be in the anointing you
[55:31] say brother Andrew what is the anointing
[55:32] I said to you like this Christ is the
[55:34] anointing
[55:37] Christ is the anointing Paul said If any
[55:41] man be in Christ he's a new Creature if
[55:43] any man be in Christ he's a new creature
[55:46] all things are passed away and behold
[55:48] all things are become new can I read
[55:50] that to you under prophetic
[55:52] interpretation If any man be in
[55:54] anointing
[55:56] If any man be in the anointing he is a
[55:59] new creature the old things are passed
[56:01] away and behold all things are become
[56:03] new in Colossians 1 27 to whom God would
[56:07] make known what is the riches of the
[56:08] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[56:10] which he is Christ in you the hope of
[56:13] glory prophetic interpretation which is
[56:15] Christ which is the anointing in you the
[56:18] hope of glory he said now what is it
[56:20] Paradox 64 it is Christ coming to his
[56:23] body we all know the anointing is Christ
[56:26] that comes on the word that makes the
[56:28] word live see Christ is the anointing
[56:31] can we all agree there Christ is the
[56:34] anointing the music is not the anointing
[56:36] the preacher is not the anointing come
[56:39] on your favorite song is not the
[56:40] anointing amen your favorite camp
[56:42] meeting is not the anointing your
[56:44] favorite convention is not the anointing
[56:46] the anointing is Christ it's the spirit
[56:50] that comes upon the word that quickens
[56:52] the word to make it live now the word is
[56:55] in your heart you believe in Divine
[56:57] Healing whatever more and Christ the
[56:59] anointing come unto his body see the
[57:01] connection there just like a husband and
[57:03] a wife to become one the church has got
[57:06] to get to the ministry until the church
[57:08] and Christ becomes warm and he can
[57:11] anoint you somebody say anoint me he can
[57:13] anoint you for every blessing that's in
[57:16] the Bible see then the anointing is not
[57:19] just coming upon you Amen to give you an
[57:21] emotional High amen or to see a vision
[57:23] or speaking tongues or to interpret the
[57:25] anointing is coming upon you amen that
[57:28] Every Blessed promise that's in the word
[57:30] of God Amen could be fulfilled in your
[57:32] faith listen I say oh God anoint you say
[57:35] man anoint us with the Holy Ghost that
[57:37] we can receive the promise amen of joy
[57:40] unspeakable and full of glory amen
[57:42] anoint us oh god with a promise amen of
[57:44] Divine Healing anoint us with the
[57:46] promise of a Rapture among church amen
[57:48] but we got to get out of this Earthbound
[57:50] realm and we got to climb up into the
[57:52] anointing
[57:55] he can anoint you isn't that beautiful
[57:57] he can anoint you for every blessing
[58:00] that's in the Bible it is yours all of
[58:03] it's yours everything is Promised at
[58:05] this age is yours amen then Christ is
[58:09] the anointing
[58:11] amen Christ is the anointing and I said
[58:14] to you like this amen the anointing is
[58:17] the mystery of God revealed
[58:20] are you with me Christ is the anointing
[58:23] and Christ is the mystery of God
[58:26] revealed now you know when he preaches
[58:29] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[58:30] preaches it in a threefold purpose right
[58:32] he said the first fold is he's going to
[58:35] reveal himself he said the second fold
[58:37] is by the revelation of himself he's
[58:40] going to take preeminence in a body
[58:42] right then the third fold is by the
[58:44] revelation of himself having preeminence
[58:47] antibody he's going to lead a body back
[58:49] to a Garden of Eden condition again
[58:51] listen friends the only way that can be
[58:53] done is you are in the anointing and the
[58:56] anointing is in you can I tell you
[58:58] something tonight the seventh Angels
[59:00] Ministry was to declare the anointing
[59:02] the seventh Angels Ministry was to
[59:05] declare him he said my Ministry is
[59:07] different from the pastor it is
[59:09] different from the Evangelist it is
[59:11] different from the teacher he said my
[59:13] Ministry is to declare him amen he is
[59:16] here you say who is here then amen can I
[59:19] tell you Church Christ the anointing is
[59:22] here or him said now I believe as we
[59:24] people have perfect absolutely perfect
[59:25] Vindication that Jesus Christ is with us
[59:28] do you believe that Jesus Christ is with
[59:30] us and so if he's here somebody say he's
[59:33] here if he's here he said that he's here
[59:36] to answer and to minister to us every
[59:38] blessing that he has promised in the
[59:41] word if he is here he is here on purpose
[59:44] if he is here he is here to minister and
[59:47] to manifest amen and to give you every
[59:49] desire amen of your heart he is here to
[59:52] fulfill the promise of his word so when
[59:54] we pray and we lay hands upon the sick
[59:57] we expect you to believe that God
[59:58] expects you to believe that he said
[1:00:00] never move from it and let nothing shake
[1:00:03] you from him somebody said we may never
[1:00:05] move from it
[1:00:06] never move from it
[1:00:09] say it like you believe it never move
[1:00:11] from it and let nothing shake you
[1:00:15] never move from it and let nothing shake
[1:00:18] you brother brother Jr I ask myself what
[1:00:20] am I what's the devil trying to move me
[1:00:22] from Brother Sean what's the devil
[1:00:23] trying to shake me from and then it come
[1:00:25] to me from the revelation of the
[1:00:27] presence of Jesus Christ being here now
[1:00:30] regardless of the conditions that's what
[1:00:33] the devil's trying to that's what the
[1:00:35] devil's trying to move you all from
[1:00:36] right now on this Wednesday night
[1:00:37] service amen is from the revelation of
[1:00:40] the presence of Jesus Christ being here
[1:00:42] regardless of the conditions of your
[1:00:44] life right now you know I can go into
[1:00:46] Matthew 16 right and Jesus said Upon
[1:00:49] This Rock he said I will build my church
[1:00:51] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:00:54] against it right remember said watch
[1:00:56] what is the Gates of Hell against not
[1:00:58] the denomination he said the gates of
[1:01:00] hell is against the spiritual revelation
[1:01:03] of Christ being here now the same
[1:01:06] yesterday today and forever right now
[1:01:09] that's what the devil is trying to move
[1:01:11] amen the church the Living God from is
[1:01:14] from the revelation of the present
[1:01:16] presence of almighty God in the church
[1:01:19] as his word should he would be he said
[1:01:21] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:01:23] you I'll be with you alway even to the
[1:01:26] end of the world do you see then the
[1:01:28] whole secret was the Revelation the
[1:01:30] whole secret of Christ The Mystery of
[1:01:33] God revealed amen was the Revelation
[1:01:35] coming into the church which the
[1:01:37] Revelation was a spiritual blessing that
[1:01:40] God promised would be in the church
[1:01:42] which would move their souls into the
[1:01:44] heavenlies and would set them in
[1:01:46] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:01:49] that's the trouble of it today is people
[1:01:52] don't understand that the whole church
[1:01:54] of living God is built upon a spiritual
[1:01:57] revelation of Christ
[1:01:59] the whole church does not realize he's
[1:02:02] saying that though that the church the
[1:02:03] world does not realize that the church
[1:02:05] is built upon a spiritual revelation of
[1:02:08] Jesus Christ he said see now watch when
[1:02:11] the word comes into you I hate to ask
[1:02:12] this but there's some cold air blowing
[1:02:14] up here hence it's going to take my
[1:02:15] voice right out the door when that word
[1:02:17] comes into you it's sharper than any
[1:02:19] two-edged sword it's even Discerning the
[1:02:22] faults and the intents of the heart he
[1:02:24] said there's the word coming in watch he
[1:02:27] said the revelation of every word of God
[1:02:30] is true you can hang your soul on any
[1:02:33] phase of it now watch this every word of
[1:02:36] God coming in the church is true he said
[1:02:39] see and you can hang your soul on any
[1:02:42] face of it brother Psalm then he says
[1:02:44] Revelation you can hang your soul on any
[1:02:47] phase of the revelation of the word that
[1:02:50] is coming in the church that is
[1:02:52] manifesting the spiritual blessings in
[1:02:54] question among church amen if our soul
[1:02:57] is not hanging on this word then watch
[1:02:59] it hanging on if it's hanging on the
[1:03:01] Republicans you're in bad trouble if
[1:03:03] it's hanging on the Democrats you're in
[1:03:04] bad trouble but listen we've gone a Step
[1:03:06] Beyond denomination they say well hang
[1:03:08] your soul on the word amen and that's
[1:03:10] partially right amen but we're living in
[1:03:13] the age where we don't just have the
[1:03:14] word but we have the revelation of the
[1:03:16] word and we are hanging our souls on the
[1:03:19] scriptural revelation of the presence of
[1:03:22] Jesus Christ in the age we're living in
[1:03:24] I love what Paul said he said which hope
[1:03:27] we have as an anchor of the Soul he did
[1:03:30] not say an anchor amen of the body he
[1:03:32] did not say an anchor of the spirit he
[1:03:34] said brother Shema we have this hope as
[1:03:37] an anchor of the Soul it is brochure and
[1:03:41] it is steadfast and it entereth into
[1:03:43] that within the veil now look at this
[1:03:45] word Soul it means the breath of life it
[1:03:48] is the vital force which emanates the
[1:03:50] body and shows itself in breathing amen
[1:03:53] notices it is the seat amen of the
[1:03:55] feelings and the desires and the
[1:03:57] affections and the aversions amen it's
[1:03:59] our heart hey minutes her soul you see
[1:04:01] what the devil's trying to do he's
[1:04:03] trying to gain the seat on the control
[1:04:05] tower come on church amen that controls
[1:04:08] your affections controls your desires
[1:04:10] controls your passions controls come on
[1:04:13] Amen because if the devil can get in
[1:04:15] that control tower he can guide your
[1:04:17] body where he wants you to go do you
[1:04:19] know why you're not if a honky-tonk
[1:04:21] tonight amen is because the soul has not
[1:04:23] got a honky tonk amen driver on the seat
[1:04:26] of the control tower amen but your soul
[1:04:28] has got the Holy Ghost and your soul is
[1:04:31] greater than your body
[1:04:33] well you know I'm telling you the truth
[1:04:35] your soul is greater than your body amen
[1:04:38] your soul is greater than your spirit
[1:04:40] amen your soul said we're going to the
[1:04:42] house of God and your body said I don't
[1:04:44] feel like going and your spirit said I'm
[1:04:46] too low to go amen but your soul said
[1:04:48] shut up I'm gonna use your feet to get
[1:04:50] there I'm going to come on preachers you
[1:04:52] know what I'm talking about amen amen
[1:04:54] You Don't Preach from your body You
[1:04:55] Preach from your soul amen you don't
[1:04:57] sing from your spirit you sing from your
[1:05:00] soul you let the soul dictate the spirit
[1:05:02] you let the soul dictate about it
[1:05:04] because the soul is the seated feelings
[1:05:07] desires affections amen aversions it all
[1:05:11] comes from the soul I love this next one
[1:05:13] brother Sean amen the soul as an Essence
[1:05:16] which differs from the body and it's not
[1:05:18] dissolved by death well glory to God
[1:05:21] Amen your body is of the earth and it's
[1:05:24] in position to die amen but your soul
[1:05:27] amen is of a different Essence in the
[1:05:29] body amen and it is not dissolved by
[1:05:31] death it is distinguish pushed from
[1:05:34] other parts of the body I love the
[1:05:36] Amplified Bible of Hebrews 6 19 it says
[1:05:39] this hope this confident Assurance we
[1:05:42] have as an anchor of the Soul Sister Kim
[1:05:44] this is powerful he said it cannot slip
[1:05:47] and it cannot break down under whatever
[1:05:49] pressure Bears upon it oh God whatever
[1:05:53] is in your soul it cannot slip and it
[1:05:56] cannot break down under whatever
[1:05:59] pressure Bears upon it I'm on Church the
[1:06:02] revelation of Jesus Christ in your soul
[1:06:04] amen is strong enough for your teenage
[1:06:06] years it's strong enough for diseases
[1:06:09] it's strong enough for laodicea there is
[1:06:11] a revelation that is taken preeminence
[1:06:13] in your soul by the message of the hour
[1:06:16] and no matter Josiah what pressure amen
[1:06:19] Bears upon that body it'll never break
[1:06:21] down that Soul because that Soul has
[1:06:24] passed the only elements of death it's
[1:06:26] passed beyond the Realms of dissolven
[1:06:28] under the fragments of human elements it
[1:06:30] is broke out into a realm with God of
[1:06:32] Eternity
[1:06:35] well glory to God I feel like shouting
[1:06:37] on Wednesday night amen are you here in
[1:06:39] the church there's a soul in there and
[1:06:41] that soul don't break down
[1:06:44] never be dissolved
[1:06:46] I say we're heavenlies in our souls
[1:06:50] I say right now some of y'all need to
[1:06:52] whip that devil and just go ahead and
[1:06:53] say Amen even though you hadn't said it
[1:06:55] all night we're heavenlies in our souls
[1:06:58] but by the end you don't understand but
[1:07:00] we're heavenlies in our souls or abandon
[1:07:03] my body but we're heavenlies in our soul
[1:07:05] brother you don't get it my spirit but
[1:07:07] we're heavenlies in our souls
[1:07:10] we're in a revelation
[1:07:13] a revelation is in us this Revelation
[1:07:16] cannot slip
[1:07:17] this Revelation cannot break down under
[1:07:20] whatever pressure Bears upon it it is a
[1:07:24] safe
[1:07:26] brother Samaya it's a steadfast though
[1:07:28] that enters within the veil of the
[1:07:31] Heavenly Temple
[1:07:33] are you ready for this
[1:07:35] that most holy place in which the very
[1:07:38] presence of God dwells
[1:07:43] then what was the prophet saying let
[1:07:46] nothing move you never move from it let
[1:07:49] nothing shake you brother Amos never
[1:07:52] move from it let nothing shake you what
[1:07:55] is the devil trying to shake you from
[1:07:57] he's trying to shake you from the anchor
[1:07:59] that's within the veil he's trying to
[1:08:01] shake you from the revelation of this

[1:10:20] guts to say it

[1:10:26] I'm willing to die for any phase of it
[1:10:30] see what I mean
[1:10:31] steadfast and sure
[1:10:34] isn't it beautiful
[1:10:37] he says isn't it beautiful when you can
[1:10:39] really anchor your soul in Christ

[1:10:46] before him

[1:10:50] the Lord that healeth thee
[1:10:52] I am the Lord that giveth eternal life I
[1:10:55] love thee I Know Thee before the Falcon
[1:10:58] what are these These are Revelations
[1:11:00] that were coming from the voice of the
[1:11:03] seventh angel that was bringing the
[1:11:05] presence of God near I'm the Lord that
[1:11:07] healeth Faith what other point what
[1:11:09] other preacher could stand there for
[1:11:11] night after night after night and tie
[1:11:14] the devil up in strings
[1:11:16] on one promise
[1:11:18] I'm the Lord that heel of Faith look at
[1:11:21] this one I'm the Lord they giveth
[1:11:23] eternal life I love thee I Know Thee
[1:11:25] before the foundation of the world I put
[1:11:27] thy name upon the book Thou Art mine
[1:11:33] what are you saying these are not just
[1:11:34] scriptures they're Revelations you can
[1:11:36] hang your soul on fear not
[1:11:39] it's me don't be afraid I'm with you
[1:11:44] what are these with Amos they're anchors
[1:11:47] to the soul
[1:11:49] see the anchor the soul hello brother
[1:11:51] says he said the man sold out all that
[1:11:53] he had for the by a certain Diamond he
[1:11:54] said you sell out to the world the
[1:11:56] things of the world and everything that
[1:11:58] pertains to anything else to have this
[1:11:59] that's right put your whole anchor right
[1:12:03] on that it's the anchor of the soul to
[1:12:06] see his revelation of his word
[1:12:09] it's the anchor of the soul to see the
[1:12:12] Revelation so the anchor of the soul is
[1:12:15] the revelation of his word
[1:12:18] can I say it when you see it
[1:12:22] when you see it it becomes an anchor
[1:12:25] because it's a revelation
[1:12:27] what did he say he said the light of the
[1:12:30] ages the word made manifest when you see
[1:12:33] it three kinds of Believers he takes
[1:12:35] time to labor in the point and say Jesus
[1:12:37] Christ is the manifested word made plain
[1:12:39] can you see it come on friends it's not
[1:12:42] about just hearing it it's not about
[1:12:44] just talking about it but can you see it
[1:12:48] I love what Paul said he said the very
[1:12:50] God of Peace sanctify you holy I pray
[1:12:52] God your whole Spirit soul and body be
[1:12:54] preserved blameless unto you for the
[1:12:56] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:12:57] faithfulness he that calleth you and
[1:12:59] also will do it look here in Romans 8
[1:13:01] verse 11. amen amen if the spirit of him
[1:13:03] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:13:05] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:13:07] dead shall also what Quicken your mortal
[1:13:10] bodies by a spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:13:13] Romans 8 12 therefore brethren we are
[1:13:16] debtors not to the flesh to live out the
[1:13:19] flesh verse 13 for if you live after the
[1:13:21] flesh you shall what he shall die but if
[1:13:24] you through the spirit do mortify the
[1:13:27] Deeds of the body ye shall live if from
[1:13:31] the soul through the spirit you mortify
[1:13:35] the Deeds of the body you shall live now
[1:13:37] look at this word quickly this word
[1:13:39] Quicken means Amen to be brought to life
[1:13:41] after death remember says God's Pride a
[1:13:44] place of worship 1965 if the spirit that
[1:13:46] raised up Jesus from the dead amen dwell
[1:13:49] in you it will Quicken make alive your
[1:13:51] mortal bodies because it's already life
[1:13:55] the quickening power in your soul it's
[1:13:59] already life see and when it comes into
[1:14:02] your body I love this it brings your
[1:14:05] whole body subject to it
[1:14:09] when it comes into your body it brings
[1:14:13] your whole body subject to it remember
[1:14:15] says subject to what the word of God if
[1:14:18] it's in you amen if the word of God is
[1:14:20] in you when the spirit of God the
[1:14:23] quickening power quickens that word
[1:14:24] that's already life it will bring your
[1:14:28] body subject to the word then the Holy
[1:14:30] Spirit comes into your soul to seal your
[1:14:33] soul amen and to manifest and vindicate
[1:14:36] the word of God in other words make it
[1:14:37] live in flesh the Holy Ghost makes the
[1:14:40] word live in flesh I love what Rhythm
[1:14:42] says he said now if you don't believe
[1:14:44] this then Jesus said search the
[1:14:45] scripture for they tell you who I am now
[1:14:48] they should have known see he was the
[1:14:49] same God that could create the bread he
[1:14:52] also created the winds and the waves
[1:14:54] certainly he is just not part God he is
[1:14:57] all God he created the winds and the
[1:14:59] ways if other things I'm gonna I'm gonna
[1:15:01] tie this together and some of y'all are
[1:15:03] gonna shout right now but I'm gonna
[1:15:04] close in a minute
[1:15:07] free of charge
[1:15:09] if other things had to obey him he was
[1:15:13] the creator would not the winds and the
[1:15:16] waves have to obey him also see now let
[1:15:18] us remember that whatever he created had
[1:15:22] to obey him he created the bread and the
[1:15:25] bread had to obey him and when the
[1:15:27] spoken word spoke across the bread the
[1:15:29] bread had to obey the spoken word and
[1:15:32] multiply and feed five thousand amen
[1:15:35] amen the winds and the waves when he
[1:15:37] spoke to him they had to obey the voice
[1:15:39] of the Creator and back up in the sun
[1:15:41] had to come out and shine listen the
[1:15:43] creation has to obey the Creator he said
[1:15:46] then he also created our bodies and
[1:15:49] won't our bodies have to obey him you
[1:15:52] surrender your thoughts to him you
[1:15:54] surrender your life to him you surrender
[1:15:56] your faith to him and watch that body
[1:15:58] obey what he says if you're a little
[1:16:00] drunkard and you can't quit drinking
[1:16:02] then Surrender Your Life to him and
[1:16:04] watch your drink no more if you're a
[1:16:06] habitual smoker and you've tried to give
[1:16:08] it up and you cannot do it just read
[1:16:10] that to him and Watch What Happens he'll
[1:16:12] make that body come on Church he'll make
[1:16:15] that body come back in subjection to the
[1:16:18] word yes sir but you've got to surrender
[1:16:20] it to him you've got to believe him he
[1:16:23] made our bodies that they will obey him
[1:16:25] also do you believe that if you're a
[1:16:27] Christian you have to he said now you
[1:16:29] may say he makes our bodies obey oh I
[1:16:32] believe we have jurisdiction over that
[1:16:34] then you're not fully surrendered
[1:16:37] if you can acknowledge that the creator
[1:16:40] of the body Jesus Christ causes the body
[1:16:43] to obey then you're not fully
[1:16:46] surrendered he said for you're not your
[1:16:48] own but you're dead you're suffered
[1:16:50] ahead and your life is hidden God
[1:16:52] through Christ and you are sealed by the
[1:16:54] Holy Ghost how are you going to do it
[1:16:56] how are you going to get away from that
[1:16:57] he said you think your poor thought your
[1:16:59] pure thoughts then them old worldly
[1:17:01] thoughts that lead you off your debt of
[1:17:03] that see what a secure feeling no one in
[1:17:06] watching the Holy Spirit change your
[1:17:08] nature
[1:17:10] from a vow person then we have passed
[1:17:13] from Death unto life we see the Holy
[1:17:16] Spirit living in US
[1:17:18] his life
[1:17:20] then I ask you tonight what are you
[1:17:22] feeding on
[1:17:23] you so brother I don't have the strength
[1:17:25] to raise my hands what is your soul
[1:17:27] feeding on
[1:17:28] other my spirit's so low what is your
[1:17:31] soul feeding on because God will make
[1:17:33] our bodies so obey him amen because he
[1:17:36] said he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[1:17:39] blood half everlasting life and I will
[1:17:41] raise him up again in the last day he
[1:17:43] said think of it our bodies obeying we
[1:17:45] have no more control of it he said and
[1:17:47] it turns back to a spoonful of dust amen
[1:17:49] God will speak to that body and it'll
[1:17:52] raise it up again in the likeness of the
[1:17:54] resurrected Jesus Christ what are you
[1:17:56] worried about this if it's in the hands
[1:17:58] of god let's go for he will raise it up
[1:18:00] in the last day he promised it that's
[1:18:02] the saith the Lord
[1:18:04] I listen to her take today three kinds
[1:18:06] of Believers I never caught this quite
[1:18:08] like like
[1:18:09] he said Do You Realize right now he said
[1:18:12] he was actually talking about job when
[1:18:13] job said though the skin worms destroyed
[1:18:15] this body yet in my flesh shall I see
[1:18:17] God remember he said Do You Realize
[1:18:19] right now that the skin worms are
[1:18:21] already in your body
[1:18:24] he said right now the skin worms are
[1:18:27] already in your body he said waiting to
[1:18:29] be activated
[1:18:32] the skin worms in your body right now
[1:18:34] well brother Andrew I'm 18 years old and
[1:18:36] I just got to my brand new car and I
[1:18:37] just got my career amen but you got skin
[1:18:39] worms in your body they've been waiting
[1:18:42] to be activated well brother I'm 50
[1:18:44] years old and I just retired well amen
[1:18:46] you got skin worms in your body weight
[1:18:48] in the bathroom amen but then I got to
[1:18:50] thinking brother Bob he didn't say
[1:18:51] nothing about them skin warmers being in
[1:18:53] our soul he said them skin worms are in
[1:18:55] our body and their way to be activated
[1:18:57] amen by Sister Jane what's in your soul
[1:18:59] according to a prophet Rapture and faith
[1:19:02] is in your soul Rapture and Grace is in
[1:19:04] your soul Revelation is in your soul
[1:19:06] anointing is in your unknown church amen
[1:19:09] if the skin worms are in your body amen
[1:19:11] then you can accept Rapture and Grace is
[1:19:13] in your soul and if the skin worms are
[1:19:15] waiting to be activated in some morning
[1:19:17] between six and nine amen a cool sweep
[1:19:20] is going to come across that body and
[1:19:22] it's not going to activate them skin
[1:19:23] worms it's going to activate that say
[1:19:25] that faith and that Grace that's in your
[1:19:27] soul and your body will have to obey the
[1:19:30] confession you've been saying for 30
[1:19:31] years my body is going to be changed
[1:19:36] yeah bring that body subject to the word
[1:19:41] when the body
[1:19:43] receives the spirit of God he says now
[1:19:46] watch
[1:19:47] it throws
[1:19:48] I'm closing here
[1:19:50] it throws The Immortal Life inside of
[1:19:53] you it throws this body in subjection to
[1:19:55] God
[1:19:57] I don't guess I'd ever clot caught it
[1:20:00] like this because we've all heard the
[1:20:02] point you obey you confess the word your
[1:20:05] body will obey your confession anybody
[1:20:07] here heard that
[1:20:08] two of you have uh anybody here okay
[1:20:12] you you speak the word your body will
[1:20:15] obey your confession then brother Sean
[1:20:17] he says it like this he said the word
[1:20:19] will bring your body subject to itself
[1:20:20] subject to what the word I never caught
[1:20:22] quite how it happens but he says here he
[1:20:24] says we are carnal and that part must
[1:20:27] perish but then inside somebody say
[1:20:29] inside
[1:20:30] we are a spirit man
[1:20:32] there's a soul inside and that's faith
[1:20:35] in God's word
[1:20:37] then we bring our outside body under
[1:20:40] subjection to the word by faith
[1:20:43] by accepting what God Said
[1:20:51] oh my we bring our bodies subject to the
[1:20:54] word by Faith by accepting what God has
[1:20:59] said
[1:21:00] don't just say if I could quit this if I
[1:21:02] could quit that just get in Christ and
[1:21:04] it's all gone see because your body is
[1:21:07] subject to the spirit look here in
[1:21:09] Hebrews 12 9 furthermore we've had
[1:21:11] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:21:15] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[1:21:18] much rather be in subjection unto the
[1:21:21] father's spirit and live now look at
[1:21:23] this word of subjection it means to
[1:21:25] yield to one's admonition or advice it
[1:21:29] means to arrange under to subordinate it
[1:21:31] means to put in subjection it means to
[1:21:33] obey or to submit to one's control so
[1:21:37] let me sit like this I actually I was
[1:21:39] out the other day in Missouri and I sat
[1:21:40] there we went in a restaurant most of my
[1:21:42] eyes kind of interesting we go in this
[1:21:44] restaurant and there's a family sitting
[1:21:46] over from us I was out there brother Tim
[1:21:47] Barnes and we're sitting there eating
[1:21:48] and there's a family over sitting over
[1:21:50] here from us and the little boy's
[1:21:52] sitting there and he just starts I mean
[1:21:53] just starts crying screaming kicking all
[1:21:55] this and his mama looks over at him and
[1:21:57] she just kind of smiles at him and he
[1:21:59] keeps on cracking uh keeps on screaming
[1:22:02] crying he's laughing and cracking up I
[1:22:04] mean doing all kinds of stuff and so she
[1:22:06] goes you know she just kind of just kind
[1:22:08] of well the kid takes his hand raises up
[1:22:11] and goes I'll hit you like that and I
[1:22:12] thought oh
[1:22:14] oh brother
[1:22:15] kind of racist hey you know I mean he
[1:22:17] didn't say it but it was like a sign you
[1:22:19] know how it is NATO just smack you you
[1:22:21] know so I thought well this gonna get
[1:22:23] real good right here bro Tim it's about
[1:22:25] that time she reached in her phone and
[1:22:27] gave him her phone turned her phone on
[1:22:28] and hand it to him and he raised his
[1:22:31] hand again to smack her again and I
[1:22:33] looked over to brother sitting next to
[1:22:34] me I said I said I'm pretty sure had I
[1:22:37] done that
[1:22:39] when I woke up on the outside of the
[1:22:42] restaurant two buildings down
[1:22:46] but it's the age we live in see it's an
[1:22:49] age where nothing can come into
[1:22:50] subjection the minute you show Authority
[1:22:53] they take it as a criticism rather than
[1:22:56] a help but here Paul says amen if we was
[1:22:59] humble ourselves to the respect and the
[1:23:02] reverence of our Earthly fathers of the
[1:23:03] flesh then how much more should we come
[1:23:06] into subjection to the father of spirits
[1:23:08] and live what's he speaking about he's
[1:23:10] speaking about your body he said if you
[1:23:12] let your brother said if you let your
[1:23:14] faith loose to God's spirit it brings
[1:23:16] your body in subjection to God's
[1:23:18] Redemptive blessing to you
[1:23:22] his word has gone forth it's fallen into
[1:23:26] the heart it corrects us
[1:23:28] it brings us into subjection to his
[1:23:31] spirit
[1:23:32] I love this one there's very few people
[1:23:35] that really come up in contact by laying
[1:23:36] on of hands
[1:23:38] my Ministry is not that we realize
[1:23:41] that's a great ministry on hands but the
[1:23:43] ministry of land on the hands was a
[1:23:44] Jewish sign you know Jairus said come
[1:23:46] lay your hands on my daughter and she'll
[1:23:47] live but the Roman Centurion said just
[1:23:50] speak the word that's all the Gentiles
[1:23:52] see just say the word and Jesus turned
[1:23:55] and said I haven't found Faith like that
[1:23:57] and this will see just speak the word
[1:23:59] because what happened now bear this in
[1:24:02] mind that
[1:24:04] help me Lord that Roman knew of Amos
[1:24:08] that every sickness and disease was
[1:24:11] subject to his word
[1:24:14] that Roman knew every disease every
[1:24:18] sickness was subject to his word now he
[1:24:20] says if you can realize the same it's
[1:24:23] all over
[1:24:26] when you can realize that the same that
[1:24:29] every demon every sickness every disease
[1:24:31] every Affliction is subject to the word
[1:24:36] of God
[1:24:38] regardless of the body
[1:24:40] regardless of the spirit
[1:24:43] the soul is in the heavenlies
[1:24:47] have y'all ever thought about a little
[1:24:48] girl named Georgia Carter
[1:24:52] it's actually amazing if you you really
[1:24:54] look at Georgia Carter's situation and
[1:24:56] break it down by the court where the REM
[1:24:58] gives and question answers on the body
[1:25:00] spirit and so it's actually interesting
[1:25:02] to see what a caliber of testimony
[1:25:04] Georgia Carter really was I was like got
[1:25:06] to thinking about this brother Bob her
[1:25:08] uncle had raped her as a young girl on
[1:25:11] the way brother Kevin to piano lessons
[1:25:13] and remember said she didn't do nothing
[1:25:15] herself to put herself in that condition
[1:25:17] but she was abused by an uncle and she
[1:25:20] was put in that condition so right there
[1:25:23] as a young girl she's got her whole life
[1:25:24] ahead of her she's taken piano lessons
[1:25:26] amen a beautiful little girl and her
[1:25:28] uncle takes a advantage of her and
[1:25:30] abuses her and Rapture and gives her TB
[1:25:33] and puts her in a bed her body is
[1:25:35] brought into a horrible condition by
[1:25:37] something she didn't even do herself
[1:25:39] right
[1:25:41] for nine years and eight months she laid
[1:25:44] up on a bed now think about this
[1:25:46] dwindling down to nothing as far as
[1:25:49] weight a horrible condition just
[1:25:51] basically a bag of bones just a fair
[1:25:53] little girl in there amen but now notice
[1:25:55] something but her spirit on the inside
[1:25:57] of her I believe her I believe we can
[1:25:59] say like this amen no doubt some days
[1:26:01] her spirit was up because she was a
[1:26:03] human and some days her spirit was down
[1:26:06] because she was a human amen but let me
[1:26:08] ask you this where did the faith come
[1:26:10] from Amen to believe that if a Prophet
[1:26:12] come by her way and spoke over her she
[1:26:15] would get up out of that condition
[1:26:17] brother Bob it wasn't coming from her
[1:26:19] body her body was in a horrible
[1:26:21] condition it wasn't coming from her
[1:26:23] spirit amen her spirit might have been
[1:26:25] low even on the day brother around come
[1:26:27] by but there was a soul in there that
[1:26:29] believed the word of God and there was a
[1:26:31] prophet out there who was praying and he
[1:26:33] said every time I got down to pray he
[1:26:35] said that mosquitoes would come he said
[1:26:37] I'd hit him and get up he said then I
[1:26:39] finally said I'm going to pray or not
[1:26:40] he's said I'm just going to pray and he
[1:26:42] said I Heard a Voice say go by the way
[1:26:45] of Carters now can you can you can you
[1:26:47] break in this story with me for a second
[1:26:48] when brother Branham goes in the harder
[1:26:50] the Carter's house it's not a fire
[1:26:53] Revival atmosphere the home is not a
[1:26:55] Heavenly atmosphere George's own mother
[1:26:58] has been standing at the window praying
[1:27:01] amen that a God will send that imposter
[1:27:04] by our house her daddy don't believe in
[1:27:06] it but in a bedroom in a horrible
[1:27:08] condition from her soul oh come from her
[1:27:11] soul she created an atmosphere in the
[1:27:14] home to welcome her miracle in the room
[1:27:16] and brother random walked in there and
[1:27:18] he said Georgia in the name of the Lord
[1:27:20] get up off of that bed and she got up
[1:27:22] off the bed and she took off running and
[1:27:25] when she went out there remember since
[1:27:26] she blessed the grass she blessed the
[1:27:28] trees he said and she went over there
[1:27:30] and she began to play the piano
[1:27:34] can I preach to you she began to ran as
[1:27:37] she began to play the piano nine years
[1:27:39] eight months no lessons probably her her
[1:27:42] fingers probably didn't even have
[1:27:43] strength he meant to to hit the cords
[1:27:46] amen but when the Creator comes on the
[1:27:48] scene the Creator by the soul will
[1:27:51] command the body to come into subjection
[1:27:53] to the promise of the word and the part
[1:27:55] of God said amen she picked up right
[1:27:57] where she left off
[1:28:00] foreign
[1:28:03] right back over there
[1:28:05] and started playing nine years and eight
[1:28:08] months no lessons
[1:28:10] let the Creator come by
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:13] not William Branham the word
[1:28:16] and the word
[1:28:18] the word and a prophet
[1:28:20] spoke over the soul of a young girl and
[1:28:22] she got up out of that condition can I
[1:28:24] say it to you like this Georgia Carter
[1:28:26] was heavenly's and her soul
[1:28:30] let our musicians come tonight
[1:28:33] when you realize that same word
[1:28:36] is in you
[1:28:38] you can realize the same word it's all
[1:28:40] over
[1:28:41] every demon ever sickness ever disease
[1:28:45] every affliction
[1:28:47] is subject to the word of God
[1:28:52] then the disease
[1:28:54] has to come subject to the advice of the
[1:28:56] Healer
[1:28:59] and leave the body
[1:29:01] the demon has to come subject to the
[1:29:03] admonition of the
[1:29:06] father
[1:29:08] and has to give up its hold
[1:29:10] and turn loose to God's Property
[1:29:14] y'all realize the hour we're living in
[1:29:17] in horse and buggy days
[1:29:19] this ain't automobile days
[1:29:22] this ain't airplane days
[1:29:24] this is astronaut faith
[1:29:27] it's where the prophet of God said it
[1:29:28] like this he said we live in the
[1:29:32] heavenlies
[1:29:35] how do we live in the heavenlies
[1:29:37] because of your heavenlies
[1:29:39] in our souls
[1:29:42] brother Amos your faith is in the soul
[1:29:45] regardless of the conditions
[1:29:48] we are in the heavenlies
[1:29:52] I'll share this Testament with I pray
[1:29:53] it'd be okay to testify too for a minute
[1:29:56] last year we went out to brother biscals
[1:29:58] there for that Winter Camp
[1:29:59] when I was out there brother Murphy Wong
[1:30:01] some of you may have heard of him
[1:30:02] brother Murphy he's a missionary the
[1:30:04] brother from China
[1:30:06] and we're sitting there talking and he
[1:30:07] said brother Andrew he says uh this was
[1:30:09] on Wednesday morning he was talking to
[1:30:10] me he said Andrew he said he said I've
[1:30:12] got so many kids I got a daughter that's
[1:30:14] married and he said he's talking about
[1:30:16] his family and he just kind of when he
[1:30:18] said it he kind of abruptly stopped you
[1:30:19] know and then the conversation changed
[1:30:21] but I could tell he was wanting to say
[1:30:23] something to me just tell me something
[1:30:25] well I never brought it back up I didn't
[1:30:27] know nothing didn't know what was going
[1:30:28] on so we went on in the service that
[1:30:30] Wednesday night and I was preaching on
[1:30:31] the thought of we've been LED I think
[1:30:33] I've spoken here in our meetings
[1:30:34] expectations have been lit by the
[1:30:36] message we've been we've been led to
[1:30:38] believe these things we've been led to
[1:30:39] believe things can happen we our soul
[1:30:41] has been led to believe the third pool
[1:30:42] is in the bride and I began to just
[1:30:45] preach on my brother Grandma's out there
[1:30:46] in the woods and while he was out there
[1:30:48] in the woods there was some squirrels
[1:30:49] out there there was no squirrels there
[1:30:51] and he spoke and I said like this
[1:30:53] pretend I said there was no squirrel DNA
[1:30:56] on the ground
[1:30:57] there was no bones no hair no guts no no
[1:31:00] cells there was nothing there I said so
[1:31:03] he didn't come down brother Kevin and
[1:31:04] say abracadabra abracadoo
[1:31:07] I make a bunch of squirrels right here
[1:31:09] for you
[1:31:10] he didn't do that because there was
[1:31:11] nothing there to do that by there was no
[1:31:13] DNA there
[1:31:15] but the spoken word created squirrels
[1:31:18] right there and I just told that when I
[1:31:20] said that the word dropped in brother
[1:31:22] Murphy's brother Murphy's daughter's
[1:31:24] heart and when it dropped in her heart
[1:31:25] amen the next day which I didn't know
[1:31:28] all this that's going to just this just
[1:31:29] just weaker a week or so ago brother
[1:31:31] Murphy said you remember last year when
[1:31:33] you were here I said yeah he said you
[1:31:35] remember when you spoke that about there
[1:31:36] no squirrel DNA and about that time of
[1:31:38] the shmiah's daughter come running up
[1:31:40] and she was holding a little baby and
[1:31:42] she said brother Andrew she said do you
[1:31:44] remember last year and brother Murphy
[1:31:45] said I'll let her tell you the testimony
[1:31:47] he said do you remember last year when
[1:31:49] you were preached on that Wednesday
[1:31:50] night and you said there was no DNA in
[1:31:52] there amen films crossed to be created
[1:31:54] by she said you didn't know she said but
[1:31:56] my husband and I was Desiring a baby she
[1:31:59] said two years ago in a meeting brother
[1:32:01] Ron Spitzer was here and he had a vision
[1:32:02] that we would have a child he said when
[1:32:04] we she said when we left the meetings we
[1:32:06] were believing that she said we went to
[1:32:07] the doctor and she said when we got
[1:32:09] married the doctor said like this she
[1:32:11] said there's nothing in your body to
[1:32:13] have a baby with so we got to do a
[1:32:14] surgery there was something missing or
[1:32:16] some element there and so we have to do
[1:32:17] a surgery and hopefully by the surgery
[1:32:19] they'll be able to have you'll be able
[1:32:21] to have a child she said but we had a
[1:32:23] vision
[1:32:24] that we was going to have a child she
[1:32:26] said so I just kind of thought well
[1:32:28] maybe the child's going to come by The
[1:32:30] Vision by the surgery she said so that
[1:32:33] wish tonight when you said that she said
[1:32:34] something dropped in my heart and said
[1:32:37] there's no DNA there right now for a
[1:32:39] baby but there can be DNA there for a
[1:32:41] baby
[1:32:42] she said I left there that night and
[1:32:43] told my husband she said we're going to
[1:32:45] have that baby she said right here is
[1:32:48] that baby she said but then you didn't
[1:32:49] know this she said but the very next
[1:32:51] morning I woke up under inspiration and
[1:32:54] took a pregnancy test and said I come to
[1:32:56] this Camp last year with a pregnancy
[1:32:57] test that was positive and she said
