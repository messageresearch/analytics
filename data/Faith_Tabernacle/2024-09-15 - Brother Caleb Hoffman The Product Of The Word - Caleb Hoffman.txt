[Music] conquerors Overcomers in this life we've been made Victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ I'd like to share something with you that couple of Wednesday nights ago I was sitting here in church and you know uh Faith Tabernacle Faith Tabernacle has been knocked down a little bit lately you know um uh with you know losing people and with were fixing to lose brother Andrew and my heart was heavy and sure love brother Andrew and his family but anyway my heart was heavy and I was just praying for Faith Tabernacle I was just Lord I'm not asking for more people sometimes more people there's more problems but Lord I'm praying that you would just let your Holy Spirit just flow through this church let this little group make a difference to somebody right and it just came on my heart it just dropped into my heart I remembered the the prophet Elisha I think it was that the Army was coming against him and uh his servant was so afraid and he said but there's more for us than there are against us and the servant couldn't understand and he said Lord opened his eyes that he might see that and he looked up and there was just we were they were surrounded and I just started to see just think about who has gone on and and you know at that night sister Martha was on a Pew by herself and and I thought what if what if brother and sister Meredith are just sitting there beside of her what if what if Faith was sitting by herself and I thought what if Sister Rebecca is just sitting there saying there's my girl worship just keep worshiping we're going to get through this and I just I just thought you know that I would share that with y'all because I began to place Believers there are more for us you remember that then there are against [Music] us I've seen God's people Pray by hospital beds I've seen them struggling for their daily bread see no at the grave of one who left us too young see no crying out for their Wayward Son oh but I've never no never seen the righteous forsaken seen them with tears in their eyes I've seen them with their hearts breaking seen them tested seen them tried seen them with their face shaken but I never know never seen the rightous forsake [Music] us seen when it seemed like there was no hope sight I've seen them when it seemed like there was n nothing but night but in the eyes of Heaven something else was going on they may have been all by themselves but they were never alone sorry never alone but I've never no never seen The rightous Forsaken seen them with tears in their eyes seen them with their hearts breaken seen them tested

righteous forsaken seen them with tears in their eyes seen them with their hearts breaking seen them tested and tried seen them with their face shaken but I never no never seen the righteous forsake

brother sea and all his family and we sure do appreciate brother Sean having us take the service uh we bring greetings from our church back home Bible Believers there in Lama Ohio our pastor brother Jonathan Martin I know he's no he's no stranger to you guys but we bring greetings from them uh if we and let's just go ahead and go right into the scripture turn to the Book of John in the first chapter in the first verse John 1 and one it would say in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and skipping on down to verse 14 and the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen I love that and from there going to Matthew the 15th chapter and the 30th verse he would say here and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and they cast them down at Jesus's feet or I believe we could say they cast them down at the word's feet and he healed them in so much that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be made whole the lame to walk the blind to see and they glorified the god of Israel amen what a day of testimonies that must have been the prophet of God would say take him at his word then it's all over on God and not on you as long as you take God at his word then the word will produce what it promised to do and this morning we'd like to take for a title the product of the word let's bow our heads dear father Lord we come before you this morning Lord we want to thank you for giving us this opportunity Lord to Lord to be here Lord to stand before Lord these Saints of like Precious Faith father Lord before the Bride of Jesus Christ and deliver your word Lord as we enter into the service I ask Lord that we've Lord we've already felt your spirit we've already felt your anointing and I ask that Lord I know there's nothing that I could say there's nothing I could preach that would Lord that would be any sort of a help to these people but if you would just move me aside Lord and you would just Lord you would just speak through me and you use this broken vessel Lord to speak your word Lord and I know that you can meet every need in the building Lord you can heal every broken body you can touch every broken soul you can meet every need so Lord we put this service into our hands we ask you would just come through this morning Father Lord that you would move in a mighty way and you would touch hearts Lord you would change lives you would touch Souls Lord put this all into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and y'all can be seated this last part part of this quote that we just read it would say as long as you take God at his word then the word will produce what it promised to do so speaking this morning on the product of the word or what the word produces the dictionary would Define the word produce as to give birth or rise to to yield to give being or form something that is composed created or brought about by a specific cause now something that I believe we all know and understand is you can always determine where something came from or whether what something is by what it produces I mean can we all agree on that it's not a complicated philosophy it's not something you have to learn about in school but the the human mind and the human heart has been designed and created to determine what something is based on what it produces and this will apply to every Walk of Life it applies to Nature you can tell a species of something you can tell a species of of a plant a a a tree or a bush based on what it produces if it's a strawberry plant it's going to bring forth strawberries if it's a fig tree it's going to bring it's going to bring forth figs if it's a cornstock it's going to bring uh bring forth corn and we could go on and on it applies to our economy you know if you look if you a car factor is going to produce cars very simply a computer factor is going to produce computers a gun factor is going to produce guns you can tell me all day long that it's a chair Factory you can tell me all day long it's a candy cane Factor you can tell me all day long this this or this that but regardless of what your word says I can determine based on what I see that it produces I can determine what it is and the prophet of God would say the word only has life and any other word is a hybrid okay any other word is a hybrid he said no matter how much it looks like it it isn't the word the word produces its own own life now we know that when God made that word it was made perfect when he spoke that word at the beginning of time it was made perfect God looked what the spoken word had created and he said it is good that word it was made perfect it was made perfect long before you ever had an idea long before you ever had an opinion long before you ever had the the ability to make an interpretation of it this word was made perfect long before you Satan never perverted it in the garden and the prophet of God would say in Christ's mystery God revealed that the first Eve would turn down that word she rejected that word she would not accept that word oh but there would be another Eve today that would not turn down that word she must not turn down that word she could not turn down that word because she was because she was that word and she was anointed and she was predestinated to produce that word and brother Brenham would say that the word must produce the bride and the bride in turn will produce the word and so the prophet is telling us here in this quote that when that believer that bride takes God at his word it will produce everything that it promised it would produce if the word said it produce Divine Healing it would produce Divine Healing if the word said it'll produce Miracles it'll produce Miracles if the word said that it's going to produce a spotless bride then this word will produce a spotless bride if this word said that it's going to produce a supernatural it will produce is Supernatural and this word doesn't need somebody standing behind it this word doesn't need us adding to it this word doesn't need us taking anything away from it this word doesn't need any psychology added to it this word doesn't need any intelligence added to it this word doesn't need nothing added to it or nothing taken away because the second you begin to add something to or take something away from this word it is no longer God's perfect word hey it can't be reproduced it can't be replicated it can be imitated man has tried to reproduce this word but no matter how hard theyve tried they cannot reproduce it denominations have tried to reproduce this word no matter no matter how hard they try they cannot reproduce all the organizations of the world have tried to reproduce this word no matter how hard they try they cannot reproduce it but I'm standing before a group of people this morning we ain't got to imitate it we ain't got to replicate it we ain't got to come up with something that's like it because we have the original word we have the ulcerated word we have the all authoritative word we have the original word oh my brother bam would talk to us and he would explain to us how that you know all throughout the ages every single age in you know during Luther's age that that that that age could be denominated that word could be denominated because that word was not yet fully expressed in Wesley's age it could be attitud it could be denominated because the word was not yet fully expressed on down through every age but we're living in an age today where that word has now been fully expressed that word has now been fully brought forth it has been fully revealed and the prophet of God said when this word has been fully revealed he said it cannot be manhandled it cannot be nomin denominated it cannot be replicated it cannot be reproduced he said this bride cannot be deceived because she has been exposed to the full word amen this word the prophet said this word will produce everything everything that it said it was going to produce he will take God as his word it will produce every promise it'll produce Every Blessing it'll produce healing it'll produce anointing it'll produce a church with a group of young people that are on fire for God it'll produce a church that is full of the Holy Ghost it'll produce a bride there is under the anointing of the pillar of fire oh why would we counterfeit something if we've got the original oh we just take God at his word this morning Watch what it produces accept your healing and watch what it produces we ain't got to wait for healing you ain't even got to pray for healing but the prophet of God said this bride now has the same power that Jesus had where you ain't got to sit around and you ain't got to pray that God's going to do something you ain't got to wonder whether God wants to heal you you ain't got to wonder whether God wants to save you you ain't got to wonder whether God wants to do these things for you oh but he said all you've got to do he says just take this word and speak that word speak your healing speak your Victory speak your Liberty just speak it oh and it'll come to pass and just watch what it produces the prophet would say God's word will produce the same thing every time if you will just simply take God's formula and carry it out to the letter I'll say that again just take God's form me and carry it out to the letter no matter what the church it says just follow it just the way and it will produce the same thing God's word will produce the same thing every single time no matter what the church says no matter what the world says no matter what the denomination says no matter what men says no matter what your mom and daddy have to say about it no matter what brother and sister have to say about it no matter what your teacher has to say about it no matter what they have to say about it if you will just stay with this word this word will produce the same thing every single time if the word open the blinded eyes one time it will do it again if the word conquer death one time it can conquer death again oh if the word conquer depression one time it can conquer depression again this morning oh if the word Conquer Cancer one time it can Conquer Cancer again if the word rais the dead up one time then they can do it again if the word ever did it one time that they can do it again oh if I have a need that I has if I have something I have need of all I need is for the word to have done it one time all throughout history and I know if it did it one time it can do it again oh whatever I have need of whatever you have need of this morning I'm here to tell you if the word did it once the word can do it again because I serve a god that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if he did it for the apostles he's going to do it for you if he did it for shamgar he can do it for you if he did it for David he can do it for you if he did it for Daniel if he did it for Joshua if he did it for Elijah he can do it for you if he did it for brother baham he can do it for you amen he would say if you want to know what kind of a crop you're going to have or what it is that's growing up in the field he said go back and find out what the seed is the seed will produce just exactly what it is it'll produce its kind a corn will bring a corn a clear a cur a wheat a wheat whatever it is it will produce just what the seed was he says so you can tell the crop that you're going to have by the seed by what what the seed by the seed that was planted you can tell what seed was planted by what that crop produces so you know if I plant corn I'm expecting corn if I plant strawberries I'm expecting the strawberries are going to go up if I plant wheat I'm expecting to see wheat but you know I don't go out to the corn field and expect that I'm going to see strawberries I don't go out to the wheat field and expect that I'm going to be seeing corn go up why because I know what it is that I've planted and me as the planter I know if I planted corn in the corn field then nothing but corn is going to grow up there because whatever ever that seed was must be what it produces and I say God doesn't worry about you this morning he doesn't worry about what you're going to produce he doesn't worry about where you're going he doesn't worry about where you came from he doesn't worry about who you are because he knows the word seed that he pled down on the inside of you from before the foundation of the world he knows if I plant word seed it must produce word he knows if I plant bride seed it must produce bride he knows whatever seed I plant down on the inside of that so must be what it produces oh maybe I'm here to tell somebody this morning you might worry about you Mama might worry about you Daddy might worry about you Pastor might even worry about you oh but this God does not worry about you because he knows what he planted on the inside of you he knows the word he planted he knows the message of the hour that he planted down on the inside of your heart and he doesn't worry about you oh hallelujah it's just like that sheep a sheep will produce wool because it is inside of that sheep to produce that wool that sheep can't produce anything else except wool because that is what it's meant to produce it's just like that Dove but B will talk about that Dove that will produce that oil that oil on the inside of them that oil that cleanses them that oil that washes them that oil that purges them brother Bram said that it is in the inside of that Dove to produce that oil he ain't got a choice but to produce it he ain't got to try to produce it he ain't got to work to produce it he ain't got to go to a certain school to a certain Seminary to learn how to produce it but he just produces it because it is inside of that Dove to produce that o and I say this morning it is inside of this bride to produce this word it is inside this bride to produce healing it is inside this bride to produce anointing it is inside this bride to produce Victory it is inside of you to produce Liberty it is inside of you oh to kill every devil in hell that comes between you and God it is inside of you oh to stomp on every devil that says that we can't praise it is inside of you to stomp on every devil that says we ain't got a right to worship I say this bride has a reason to Rejoice this morning because we have seen our name being written on the Lamb's Book of Life and we have seen this word and the Divine hand of God write our name and of it we know if the word wrote my name I'm going to produce the word if the word word if the word said that I was born of word seed then I must produce that word oh hallelujah oh my that he would say if a man is born of the word he will produce the word the fruit or the works of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or life that is in him I mean that's pretty simple ain't it oh I love that God sent a Kentucky hillbo to be my Prophet because he didn't say nothing complicated but he dumbed it down where I could understand it if you're not born of the word you're not going to produce this word oh but if I am born of that word I will produce that word I say if I am born of this word I'm going to produce this word oh Church you weren't you weren't trained to overcome you were born to overcome you w you didn't learn how to how to accept healing you were born to accept healing oh you weren't trained to overcome you were born to overcome when Satan comes and he says you're nobody you young people I know the the complexes he brings when he comes and he says you're this he says you're that he says you've gone too far he says you're never going to make it oh he says look at your past he says look at where you've been look at what you've done look at all your decisions you made since you were born oh but Satan before I was born oh before I made a mistake before I made a decision before I went down the wrong path or before I had a past I had a word and that word claimed me before that the towns of the devil ever got its hands on me this word already cleaned me this word already said you're mine this word already says already said I have predestinated you I have for ordained you I have called you I have elected you and you are mine and you will produce this word you can run this way for a while you might run that way for a while oh but if I have called you you will produce this word because if you are born of the word you must produce the word oh it's a promise not just a promise it's an obligation oh you ain't got a choice whether you produce it if you're born of it you're going to produce it one way or the other oh my I ran for a long time time oh as a teenager I ran as far as I could oh but one of these days God got a hold of me and he said kale he said you can run as long as you want to oh but today is the day you've run long enough oh cuz there's no way you could run there's not no no distance that you could run that my arm can still not reach you wherever you are at and that word SE was playing down on the inside of you oh I can grab a hold of you wherever you were no matter how no matter how far down you went my arm was long enough to reach down and to pick you back back up and expose you to that Sun so that that word seed can begin to grow that word seed can begin to break through the shell that word seek could begin to come manifest oh inside of that bride body oh Hallelujah prise God Amen oh the prophet God would say in the voice of the sign he will say that you will stand by the word because you were born to stand by that word that's simply that that's simple church he would say the word does not produce defeat the word produces victory oh the word doesn't produce sickness this word produces healing this word don't produce this that word only produces the word oh I remember one time oh I had gotten so sick with something I had learned to live with it and I had told myself in my mind that God was giv me that sickness as a punishment God was giving me this just as a reminder as a as a way to just just remind me of where I've been oh but one day somebody told me this a Cale oh they said God does not produce sickness this word don't produce sickness this word don't produce disease God didn't give you that sickness God didn't give you that disease but if you just take a hold of the word and just accept your hearing and just accept your Liberty oh brother bham said there's no devil in hell that can hold down this bride when she gets a revelation of who she is what she is and that she can do the Greater Works he said there is no devil in hell that can stop her oh when I look across this message I'm not surprised when I see Divine Healing when I look across this message I'm not surprised when I see a group of young people that are on fire for God when I look across this message church I'm not surprised when I see these things why because I know what the word produces I know what this message produces I know that it produces Liberty I know it produces Revival I know that it produces life this message don't produce death this message produces life this message don't produce fear this message produces Faith oh Hallelujah I would like to make a declaration this morning there is no room for fear in this message there's no room for doubt in this message there's no room for belief in this message it's already so full of Faith there ain't no room for fear it's already so full of healing there's no room for sickness it's already so full of Deliverance there's no room for depression there's no room for complexes I say if you'll stand on this word if you'll stand on the message of the hour this message will take you all the way this word will carry you all the way not not 50% of the way not not not 90% of the way not 99% of the way but this word will take you all the way oh I don't a god yesterday I don't serve a dead God oh but I serve a God that if he did it for them he can do it now for me oh the prophet of God would say he would say I believe we got some Shamu guards in the church today and you know I was thinking about that I was reading that quote the other day and I thought you know I don't believe that the prophet of God would say that if the same God that stood for shamgar was not standing here in this building this morning standing for me oh we another place he would say I believe got some Davids in the church today and I don't believe that the prophet of God would say that and the same God that stood for David and that carried that Stone from that sling to the head of Goliath was not standing in this church this morning or ready to stand for a bride ready to fight for a bride oh ready to take a bride oh hallelujah oh I believe I'm standing before some sham Gods I believe I'm standing before some Davids because the same God that stood for them is now standing with you oh I don't believe that Elisha oh stood there beside the banks of Jordan oh as he after watched Elijah go up and he say well he said the prophet's off the scene the prophet's gone well God s a prophet but I guess we'll swim across the river and go back home no I don't believe he did that Elisha was not content with God sent a prophet that's Elisha was not content with a god of 1963 Elijah was not content with a God in 1965 but what did he do he took a hold of that rment that Elijah had carried he began to wave that rment he began to swing it around just like Elijah did he begin to STP that water just like Elijah did and when he did what to do that water did the same thing for elishah that it had done for Elijah oh he said maybe Elijah's gone off the scene but where is the god of Elijah the same God that stood for Elijah is standing for me the same God that stood for him is now standing for me and he took it a step farther oh he said if Elijah did it once I'm going to do it twice if Elijah heal cancer 10 times I'm going to heal cancer 20 times if Elijah killed a th000 Devils I'm going to kill 2,000 Devils because the same word the same power the same Authority that rested inside of Elijah is now resting inside of me and I say the same power the same Authority that rested inside of William brandham has now been placed inside of this bride oh hallelujah amen take God at his word if somebody give me a handkerchief I'll lift M on the back I'm sorry do y'all have would youall happen to have one take God at his word and watch it destroy every devil take God at his word oh watch it break down every stronghold watch it kill every Goliath watch it destroy every Army that stands in your way the private would say now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation would show us thank you sir would show us he said how that thy Antichrist spirit will come into the church and will defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless so I want you to watch now he's going to go in to how it is that he defiles this church he said this word it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people people and the discrediting of God's word so how does he defile God's Church how does he make it lukewarm how does it make it formal how does it make it powerless he said he does it by discrediting God's word he does it by changing God's word he does it by by adding a little bit here by taking away just a little bit here not a lot not very much but just just by just one word just one one sentence Oh if he can get a a member of this church to just disbelieve one word just discredit one word just discredit one part of oh then he is defile that member oh but I love the way he said it he said it's the attempted destruction of God's people oh because he said that this bride oh this bride is impossible for her to be deceived it is impossible for her to follow after somebody else it is impossible for her to leave this word oh because he can discredit God's word all he wants to oh but I begin to think if the only way that Satan could even attempt to just to stop God's bride if the only way he could even attempt oh to stop me was by discrediting God's word I think I'm just going to stand with the word I think I'm just going to stay with this original word I'm just going to stay with what works I'm just going to stay with what's alive I'm just going to stay with what's real I'm just going to stay with the original word Oh my he said he discredited God's word and it was the attempted destruction of God's people oh hallelujah oh right down to the time he is cast in the Lake of Fire oh he FS that the word he cannot stand it the word he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and the prophet say she is the word and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army oh she will be an invincible Army she will be unstoppable she will be undefeatable she will be unconquerable oh what does she have to do she has to get a revelation of the word that is on the inside of her and he said once she gets that Revelation she will be an invincible Army hallelujah oh Church this morning Satan knows what happens when you take God at his word he knows what happens when this bride gets revelation of what this word says she is and who this word says she is and the power that this word says she has he knows that if he get this bride gets that Revelation oh that she will be unstoppable there will be no defeating her he knows if Jesus used the word to defeat him then he knows that there will be a bride that will use that same word to defeat him now oh the prophet of God will go on in this same sermon or they in the church edes right after this and he would tell tell us he would say that just the way that Jesus defeated him in the desert when Satan tempted him he would say it would be the exact same way oh that the Bride of Jesus Christ today would defeat Satan he said because he used a word to defeat the devil and he said this bride will use that word to defeat the Devil I say this morning you can fight the devil with anything you want to but there's only one thing that'll kill every devil in hell there's only one thing that'll break every Shackle in the world and that is this word oh if you need something to fight with if you need a sword to fight with I'll show you a store that you can fight with it'll kill every devil it'll break every chain it'll destroy every stronghold oh the wasn't prob God say he said you pick up the sword of the word and he said you whack that devil he said you whack it again and you whack it again and he said if it don't die he said you whack it again and you keep whacking and you keep whacking until that devil is dead I say we got a sword this morning we've got a word this morning we've got a message of the hour that we can use to kill the devil oh oh this word will prevail this word will defeat Satan any time anywhere any place any form under any condition oh hallelujah oh I am so I'm so thankful oh to be identified oh with such an absolute I'm oh I'm so grateful that I that I have been chosen identified oh to be a part of this word to be a part of this message oh hallelujah hallelujah oh another definition for the word product is interpretation so the product of the word is the interpretation of the word now brother Brandon would talk about this many times about the interpretation of the word he would say he would say we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication what does that mean that means there's no question about it it's been divinely Vindicated there's no question about this word there's no question about this message there's no question about where it's came from there's no question about where it's taking you it's been divinely Vindicated he would say the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication now we know that brother Brandon would identify to us how it is that God interprets his word he would say that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass or by bringing it to manifestation it's simple he was say he he he brings it he interprets his word by bringing it to pass now we know that everything we see around us is the interpretation of God's word the the the very grass that you see grow outside the dirt that we walk on the trees that grow everything we see is the interpretation of God's word he would the prophet would say the world that we are sitting upon today the chairs we're sitting in the floor that's beneath us the dirt the trees everything is nothing but the interpretation of the word of God so when God spoke that word in creating the world he brought that word to pass and the result that we see today is the interpretation of that word that he spoke in the beginning and we know that before the foundation of the world there was a perfect word in the mind of God and inside that perfect word in the mind of God that is where you were that is where you abide that was where you rested was inside that perfect word and now the prophet would come along and he would say that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass but that the interpretation must come through a prophit so now that perfect word that was in the mind of God through the message of a prophet has now been made manifest in a bride body and that bride body is the interpretation or the product of that perfect word he would say the true bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in his designated decreed season now I want you to watch what he says not every member comes forth at the same time not every seed will grow up at the same time but he said each member came forth in the designated decreed season and as each member came forth it became expressed and it took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word seed bride so this bride is the perfect manifestation or the perfect interpretation of God's word not man's interpretation of it the Baptist are man's inter interpretation of the word the Pentecostals remains interpretation of the word the Methodist remains interpretation of the word the prophet of God would actually identify to us what a denomination was he would say a denomination is man's interpretation of God's word oh but you are not a man's interpretation you are not a denomination interpretation you are not some Spirits interpretation but you are God's perfect interpretation of his own word oh think about that this morning you are God's interpretation of his own word he interpreted his own word and it produced you it brought forth you It produced this bride and you are the perfect word seed bride oh now he would say Satan was The Interpreter of that word to Eve she wouldn't listen to her husband or to God but she took the prosecutor's interpretation of the word so Satan was The Interpreter of that word to Eve and therefore by discrediting God's word he defiled Eve by misinterpreting God's word he would deceive Eve oh but there was been another E day that's been given another promise oh that we could not be deceived it was impossible for us to follow after her misinterpretation of God's word oh because she was a perfect interpretation of that word from the very beginning oh when I was born I was the interpretation of my mother I was the interpretation of my father I was the interpretation of my parents when I was born not just on the outside not not just my skin color not just my facial features not just my eye color and my hair color oh but my DNA was the interpretation of my appearance oh all these things you know everything about me inside my flesh everything my blood everything was the interpretation of my parents even down to the bone structure oh my bone marrow was the interpretation of my parents down to the very core the foundation of my body is the foundation of the interpretation of my parents now Hebrews 4:12 it would say for the word of God is quick and powerful and is sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing theunder of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints in the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so when that word pierces the believer it goes as deep as it could possibly go when that word quickens inside of you it goes all the way down to the foundation of the body it goes beyond the flesh it goes beyond the mind and he said that word pierces down to the foundation the word of God brother Brandon would say the word of God it say sharp two-edged sword what was it doing Discerning the thoughts of the heart the intents going even deeper than the meat deeper than the flesh deeper than the blood cells on into the bone down into the marrow of the bone P Beyond even to a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so that when that word quickens on the inside of the believer on the inside of this bra it goes deeper than the flesh it goes deeper than the meat and it pierces down to the marrow of the bone now the bone or the bone marrow is the foundation of the human body the bone marrow is where blood cells are generated a lot of people will say well the heart is the foundation of the human body no all the heart does is just pump that blood all that all it does just send it to the body but you're inside your bone marrow is where that blood is generated where that blood is produced the bone marrow is where their body's nutrients are stored the bone is the foundation of the the human body and when that word is the prophet of God would say that the word is the foundation of the church so when that word is born inside of a body it don't just pierce the skin it don't just Pierce uh to the flesh it don't just Pierce to the heart but he would say it goes as deep as that Foundation goes that word sinks down until the very core of the body is overcome by word it sinks in until every root of that body is word oh looking back at Elisha 2 Kings 13:20 it will say and Elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the mobites and Ved the land at the coming end of the year so two things have taken place here the prophet has died the prophet of God has gone off the scene number one Elijah has gone off the scene and number two we see the moabites have come in and have invaded Israel now we know the prophet of God will show us that the moabites represented the lukew believer but the prophet God would say Moab they represented the lukew Believers he would say they had the same fundamentals of Christianity that that Israel had but he said what they lack was the same Pillar of Fire that followed Israel so now we see what has happened is the Elijah messenger has left the scene and the nation has moved into a lorm age I believe that's a perfect parallel of what we're living in today but now something begins to happen in verse 21 it would say and they came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the seple of Elisha and when the man was let down and he touched the bones of Elisha he revived and he stood up on his feet oh so they begin to dig up the grave of the man of God and there laid his bones and they laid this body onto the bones of the prophet and he raised up oh maybe Elijah was dead maybe the prophet had gone off the scene but you know there was a group of people that knew that the foundation of Elijah was still there that word was still there the same word that was inside of Elijah those bones were still laying there oh when I say to you this morning oh maybe the prophet's going off the scene maybe brother Brenham has died maybe he's going off the scene for the foundation of Elijah is still here the foundation of Malachi 4 is still here maybe the prophet's not alive but this word is still alive the message that he brought is still alive the word that he brought forth is still alive the word that he expressed that he produced is still alive oh they laid him down on the body on the bones of that Prophet on the foundation of that prophet and that body begin to rise oh now I don't believe we need to be packing shovels to a grave in Jeffersonville and we need dig up the prophet and go jump on his bones that's not what I believe but if y begin to look at this word bones of Elisha here in the Hebrew when it's talking about these bones would mean the essence of the body the substance the life and the strength that is contained in that body so that word substance there it means manifestation so we can say they laid that body on the life the substance or the manifestation of the Prophet messenger so once that word comes and this bride is exposed to that word that word will become manifest inside of her oh and I'm standing before a group of people this morning oh we are not manifesting the world we are not manifesting some men some men's ideas we are not manifesting a denomination oh but we have been manifesting this perfect word because this B body was laid down oh upon the the the foundation of Malachi 4 we were laid down upon this word and that word was transferred from the prophet into a new bride body oh there was a transfer of power that word went from William Brandon and has now been placed inside of her bride until the prophet of God would say this bride has this sayith the Lord he say you have this sayith the Lord L you have perfect access to this word you have perfect authority to speak this word you have perfect power to speak this word because there's been a transfer oh it didn't just stay with a Prophet this word didn't go on the ground with a prophet oh but that word was transferred from the prophet into a bride body oh Hallelujah and that word is now being manifested inside of this bride oh there lay a lifeless bride body brother Brandon would say she was dead she was overcome by Le Osa she was overcome by the world oh and once he was laid down upon that Foundation oh watch what happened he said once they laid that dead body on that word the Bible would say when they laid that dead body on those bones not only did he come to life but that body then began to stand on the word that body begin to stand to his feet on the foundation of Elijah oh I'm here to tell you this morning this word won't only give you life but you can stand on this word you been stand on this message you stand on the prophet of Malachi 4 You Been stand on his message oh he he gave us a promise Earth may pass away Heavens may pass away oh but this word will never pass away oh so if this bde will stand on a word that will never pass away then this bde will never pass this bde will never be defeated this B will never be conquered because we are standing on a word that can't be defeated we are standing on a word that can't be conquered oh hallelujah oh he would say when that word go for the word will produce what it said now I want you to watch this word said that it's going to give unto Elijah a double portion of what it gave unto Elijah and if you read in this word Elijah performed eight Miracles and if you look the prophet of God would say he would say Elijah performed eight Miracles and Elisha performed 16 so I just one time it been several years ago I just did the study and know I began to look and I begin to count and Elijah performed eight Miracles and throughout all of Elisha's life Elisha performed 15 miracles and I was something there for a minute and I thought well it ain't that big of a deal oh come on Caleb what's one extra Miracle what's that one extra Miracle going to do oh it's it's it's pretty much a double portion it's pretty much double oh why would we care about that last miracle oh but I say God rich in Mercy oh he just wanted to show somebody oh that even if the prophet was off the scene that word that prophecy that message that had come forth still had to be fulfilled even if the prophet was dead oh there was still a word that had not yet been fulfilled oh even if the prophet was gone there was still a body that needed raisin oh and I say this morning all the prophets been out the sea for 60 years but there was still a bride body that needed to be raised there was still a bride body that needed to stand to his feet that was still abro and this bad body is the Fulfillment of the word you are the Fulfillment of the word you are the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 oh brother Brandon was only the beginning of Malachi 4 you are the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 because not only has God turned his eyes towards you oh but now this bride has turned her eyes and look back into the eyes of God she has looked back into the eyes of this word oh we are not looking through a glass Darkly we are not looking through a hazy mirror oh we are now looking into the perfect reflection we are now looking at the perfect word oh Hallelujah Church oh this bride body is a fulfillment of that word this Bride is a 16th Miracle this bride is the Fulfillment of that word oh Hallelujah brother bam will say that's why you see people some of them are on the housetop all the time others will say well I was healed yesterday but bless God I lost my healing oh I think there so many of us today get that mindset oh I was healed yesterday oh but I still feel the effects of it today so that means God never did nothing for me that means God never moved that means that's word ain't real that means this word is dead oh but he would say you never had it to begin with because once that word is once anchored he said all the devils in Hell couldn't shake it away from you once that word is anchored every devil in hell can shake it away from you depression can't shake it complexes can't shake it suicide can't shake it cancer can't shake it oh diseases can't shake it sickness can't shake it there is nothing there ain't a devil there ain't a man oh there ain't a spirit there a demon that can shake this bride once she was anchored in the word of God I say this morning let's get anchored in this word let's stand on this word let's stand on the word of God oh till no devil in hell can shake us oh hallelujah oh my no devil can shake you you know you say Caleb I'm waiting on the leading of the Lord Caleb I'm just praying I'm just waiting that's the biggest cop out in the message you ain't got to wait on the leading of the Lord to accept your healing you ain't got to wait on the leading of the Lord oh to accept this what this word has already given to you the word LED you to do that from before the foundation of the world you don't need to wait on it you ain't got to wait you ain't Church there are some things we ain't got to pray about there are some things we ain't got to lay on our faith before God about and accepting your healing is one of them standing on this word is one of them you may got to pray about Victory God's already given you Victory you ain't got to wait to see if God wants to liberate you he already liberated this bride he was already already giv us his word he's already giv us healing he's already given us power he's already giv us Authority oh Hallelujah this word produces Liberty the prophet would say the spirit of the Lord goes is in this building tonight to set free and to give Liberty for the mighty conqueror has paid the price and men are at Liberty to be healed and to be set free oh how precious his word is to us Devils is conquered sickness is conquered oh so to think this morning this word is not only here but this word has been here for a purpose and the prophet of God would say that purpose is to set free and to give Liberty now I know that you are familiar with the Year of Jubilee we're not going to go all the way through this morning but but brother bandam when he would speak when he would preach on Liberty he would almost always go back to the year Jubilee because it it is it is is the most perfect type oh of the Liberty that the believer this bride has but he will go through it he will preach many times and just going through real quickly those slaves will be working in the field and every Jubilee year every 50th year was a Year of Jubilee oh and on that 50th year oh those priests will ride throughout the land blowing those trumpets of Jubilee and when those trumpets were sounded whenever that slave that servant heard that sound they could drop the hoe they could drop the rake they could drop their TOS oh they could drop their chains they could drop their shackles and they could go free why because they had heard the sound of the Jubilee trumpet oh and brother Brandon would say he would say at one time that was actually talking about a physical trumpet he would say but today referring to this brow he said thou trumpet represents the word of God coming forth through the preaching of the message of the hour he will say when that word Goes Forth oh you ain't got to work one more day for the enemy church when that word Goes Forth you ain't got to work one more day for the Taskmaster excuse me you ain't got to work one more day for that enemy whenever that word Goes Forth oh but when you hear that word that word sets you at Liberty to step from your servitude into sunship oh this word sets you at Liberty Church to step from servitude into sunship now this the the the sound of the Jubilee trumpet did not make you a son you were always a son oh you were already a son but what it did was it bring was it brought forth a word that gave you the Liberty to step out of your chains to step out of Slavery to step out of servitude to step out of the condition you were living in to step out of your bondage and to step into your adopted position as a Son of God oh I say this morning this bride is not bound down this bride is not living in bondage this bride is not living in slavery this bride is not living under the whis under the whip of the Taskmaster oh but this word has set this bride a liberty this word has set this bride oh a complete Liberty oh he would say now in these days when these priests when they would take the man out there maybe hoing in the cornfield he said the master would be walking up and down with him with the whip hurry up got to hurry up with this hurry up with that and just as soon as that trumpet sounded that man could throw that hold down and say I won't hold with it no more and that Taskmaster that slave driver was forbidden to touch him anymore oh I say I this morning this brother this devil is forbidden to touch you anymore oh Satan is forbidden to touch you anymore when you stand on this word it is impossible for Satan to get to you it is impossible for him to destroy you oh he might talk the talk oh he might he might fake it he might say but the prophet of God said all he is is a bluff oh but he would say they can't touch him anymore why because he was free oh when he had heard the good news the jubile was on the atonement was made and all the slaves could go free now he would talk about himself he would say I remember myself when I heard that good news come to my heart as a little old sinner boy laying here on the hospital bed the doctor said got three more minutes to live oh but I heard a sound from Heaven that told me the Jubilee year was on I accepted the Lord Jesus I turned loose of all the shackles of sin and I said to that devil you can't do me any more harm because I give my life to Christ Jesus you can't whip me anymore and I want you to notice since then he's bluffed me lots of times but he's not been able to touch me since because he's just a bluff he said I can hear the whip cracking and popping and so forth but it don't do no good because he can't get me because I belong to the Lord now oh Hallelujah he said I belong to the Lord now he said this word has Set Me Free the name of Jesus has Set Me Free oh this word has set him at Liberty devil you can't touch me I can hear the whip cracking but it can't touch me I can hear the chain smacking but that can't touch me oh I can hear the Taskmaster screaming oh but he can't touch me why because I have heard this Jubilee I have heard the word and this word has Set Me Free oh this word produces Liberty oh this word produces perfect Liberty oh come on church it's time this morning to throw down the rake it's time this morning to throw down the shovel it's time this morning to throw down the hoe and who the son has set free is free indeed I say there ain't no question about your Liberty there ain't no question about if you're free there ain't no question about if you can be delivered because when the word does something the word is an absolute and if the word does something he does it absolutely so if the word set you free you are free indeed if the word delivered you you are delivered indeed if the word set you at Freedom you are free indeed oh Hallelujah church we are free oh this message has set us at Liberty by restoring us back to who we were in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world oh I'm going to say that again this message has set us a liberty by restoring us back to who we were in the mind of God from before the foundation of the world before Satan ever got his hands on us before the devil ever got his hands on us before this world ever got his hands on us before Le the sea ever got his hand on us oh I was claimed by this word I was planted a seed inside of me by this word oh I say we got a reason to Rejoice this morning this bride got a reason to praise this bride has a reason why because this word has set us free this message has set us at Liberty this message has G us total freedom and we have the freedom to shout we've got the Liberty to praise we've got the Liberty to dance we've got the Liberty to kill every devil we've got Liberty to stomp on the head of every devil that comes in between us oh hallelujah oh you know the Jews the Jews celebrate the Feast of puram every year and this Feast is the feast where they celebrate they excuse me they celebrate the book of The Book of Esther so every year they take out the book and they'll open up this book and they'll begin to read that story of Esther oh and those Jews I saw this oh man I I start to shouting right there when I saw this those Jews would take a piece of chalk and they would write the name hmon on the bottom of their foot praise God oh when as they started reading that book of Esther as that word begin to come forth those Jews start stomping their feet and they stomped their feet and they stomped their feet all the way until that word is ended all the way until the end of that book and if they look and the name is still a little bit there even if it's smudy they keep stomping and they keep stomping and they keep stomping and they don't stop stomping until their devil oh is completely erased I see if God's people in the natural realm oh can stomp out their devil how much more can the Bri body of Jesus Christ stomp out the devil stomp out her enemy stomp out that Taskmaster I say tonight Rite your devil on the bottom of your foot and just stomp on that devil stomp until he's dead stomp until he's killed oh just destroy that devil this morning oh this word

Caleb you're crazy oh maybe but I'm free oh I say I'm free oh formality don't hold me down oh denominations don't hold me down complexes don't hold me down depression don't hold me down I am free because this word has liberated me this word has set me perfect Liberty oh Hallelujah the prophet of God would say oh he would say that David had a right to dance he said he said David the reason that David danced was because he saw that word being restored to his rightful position oh he said that Ark was he said that Ark of God was the word and he said when David saw that that word oh was being restored back to his rful position in the Tabernacle of God the prophet said David couldn't help but dance oh mind the prophet of God said and while Christ speak he said this bride is the Tabernacle that God now dwells in I say this morning we've got a reason to praise because we have watched that word be restored back to the Tabernacle of God we have watched this word be restored back oh to his original position inside of this bride body oh we've got even more of a reason to praise and David did he watched that word restored oh but I am the word restored I am oh the word manifest I am the word interpreted I am the word set free oh Hallelujah church we ain't got to live in bondage we ain't got to live under Creeds we ain't got to live under dogmas we ain't got to live oh under man's ideas oh but this bride this word has set us free oh hallelujah oh my the prophet of God said he said when that old sickness has bothered you that old stomach trouble oh my that old pop that old SIM then things that say you back and held you back when you walk through the blood of Jesus and God has cleansed your soul there'll be another dancing party take place oh they say we can't praise no more
