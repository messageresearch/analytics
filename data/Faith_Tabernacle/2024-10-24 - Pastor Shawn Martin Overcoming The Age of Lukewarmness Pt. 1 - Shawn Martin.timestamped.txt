[43:40] your Bibles we can turn to the
[43:42] revelations the third chapter but so um
[43:46] we get there that evening and uh they
[43:49] have a different way of uh how they do
[43:53] the viewing but uh there was
[43:58] that place was packed I don't know 400
[44:01] 500 maybe or so and um didn't know it at
[44:05] the time but it was a lot of
[44:07] Hindu uh people there and but um um it
[44:12] was my turn to talk we took uh just a
[44:16] few minutes to uh talk to the people and
[44:21] um just kind of went along the lines
[44:23] that I did at brother Walker's funeral
[44:25] speaking of a change and what we have to
[44:28] look forward to and um people really
[44:32] listened intently and um uh when I was
[44:37] finishing up the presence of the Lord
[44:39] just dropped in that place and uh you
[44:42] could just feel his presence and uh so
[44:45] we really thankful to the Lord and uh
[44:48] had a lot of uh people said really
[44:51] helped them they enjoyed it and so you
[44:53] never know what what you plant you know
[44:57] and um so after after that the pastor
[45:02] just um which is sister Anna's brother
[45:05] and brother Isaac he uh just uh more
[45:09] pleaded with me to stay over and I said
[45:12] well I can't and I said I ain't got
[45:14] close for one and uh said I you know the
[45:18] couple Brothers uh had helped rent a car
[45:22] so I said I got to have that car back
[45:25] and um said you know I got to be back at
[45:28] my own service and stuff and so he kept
[45:32] asking and I said no I I can't and uh so
[45:36] we headed home uh Thursday evening after
[45:39] the funeral and got about 2 and a half
[45:40] hours away and I just felt man just felt
[45:45] that I had to go back and um you know I
[45:49] think it's
[45:50] important uh to follow the leading of
[45:52] the Holy Ghost and I know uh you Elders
[45:56] especially and brother Terry you being
[45:57] an elder Minister uh knows how important
[46:01] that is you know and so we um we we you
[46:07] know I text him I said well brother
[46:09] Isaac if you think I can help your
[46:11] people you know I I'll come and um so he
[46:18] he had us to come back and the Lord just
[46:21] uh moved in the services I didn't know
[46:24] it but they had service Friday night as
[46:26] well
[46:27] at their church so we had to speak then
[46:29] and then of course Sunday morning and U
[46:33] that God was gracious and I just pray
[46:36] that it was a help to the the people to
[46:39] the family and uh that God would um just
[46:43] um encourage them Amen brother Anthony
[46:47] was a real Backbone in that church and
[46:51] uh he' done a lot of things and so um
[46:54] Not only was he just a friend a family
[46:58] member but the church lost a a
[47:02] real uh uh support amen and so I know
[47:06] they're they' just all devastated at
[47:09] this time but they're they're strong and
[47:12] they're moving right on and so we thank
[47:15] the Lord for that amen and so uh but the
[47:19] Book of
[47:20] Revelations the third chapter and
[47:23] appreciate Daniel uh for filling in for
[47:25] me on such a short short notice there
[47:29] and uh heard that the service went good
[47:32] so we thank the Lord for that but uh
[47:35] Revelations
[47:37] 3
[47:40] and I want to start I guess at the the
[47:44] 14th
[47:46] verse and unto the angel of the Church
[47:49] of the Le oans write these things saith
[47:53] the amen the faithful and true witness
[47:55] the beginning of the creation of God God
[47:58] I Know Thy works that thou art neither
[48:00] cold nor hot I would that thou W I would
[48:04] thou W cold or hot so then because Thou
[48:07] Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I
[48:10] will spew thee out of my
[48:12] mouth because thou sayest I am rich and
[48:15] increased with goods and have need of
[48:17] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[48:20] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[48:27] amen if you turn with me also to uh I
[48:31] believe it's the uh Romans the 12th
[48:36] chapter amen and we'll just read the
[48:39] first two verses
[48:42] Romans
[48:44] 12 1 and
[48:48] 2 says I beseech you therefore Brethren
[48:52] by the mercies of God that you present
[48:55] your bodies a living SA
[48:57] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[49:02] is your reasonable
[49:03] service and be not conformed to this
[49:06] world but be ye transformed by the
[49:09] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[49:12] what is that good and acceptable and
[49:16] perfect will of God Amen could we just
[49:20] bow our heads in a word of prayer father
[49:26] as the songs have been sung and the
[49:29] worship gone forth we pray Lord that it
[49:34] has been acceptable in your sight
[49:37] father Lord and as it's been expressed
[49:41] we want to draw closer to you and that's
[49:44] certainly my
[49:46] desire and I pray father that you would
[49:49] draw us all closer to thee you alone
[49:52] know the the the intent of our hearts
[49:56] Lord our
[49:57] motive father you know the things that
[50:00] maybe we struggle with and the things
[50:02] that we we we want to lay down need to
[50:07] lay down and father just to so we could
[50:12] be more free that we could be more
[50:14] liberated to serve you I pray that you
[50:18] would give us the grace to do that
[50:21] father just bless your word bless the
[50:23] ministering of your word and the hearing
[50:26] is is our prayer we ask it in Jesus
[50:30] Christ's name and the church
[50:32] says amen and amen you can be
[50:37] seated and good to have uh Kevin back
[50:42] amen and um uh we thought that uh he had
[50:46] taken a bus to Florida amen where it's
[50:49] warmer amen but uh um surprise amen but
[50:56] but uh so here uh I'm if I have a title
[51:02] I'm going to call it overcoming the age
[51:05] of
[51:07] lukewarmness and this is just something
[51:10] that's been on my heart um here lately
[51:15] and
[51:16] um I want to just share with you uh for
[51:21] just a few moments but uh all of us know
[51:25] that there are seven Church ages uh that
[51:28] God has allotted uh the
[51:31] Gentiles and uh it is called the Gentile
[51:37] dispensation uh which is a a space of
[51:40] time in which God has given
[51:44] himself he's allotted himself this
[51:48] time uh to fulfill his purpose and his
[51:52] plan of what he has predestinated to do
[51:56] and that is to uh call out of the
[52:00] Gentiles a people for his name to make
[52:04] up his bride in Acts 15:14 Simeon hath
[52:10] declared how God at the first did visit
[52:12] the Gentiles to take out of them a
[52:15] people for his
[52:17] name and so we we find that uh this time
[52:24] is is it's not our time
[52:27] uh per se because we will never in in in
[52:30] our lifetime we will never be done with
[52:34] achievements uh we've always got things
[52:36] to do and that's that's the problem is
[52:39] we're never we we when God turns the
[52:42] corner when God does things in our life
[52:45] so
[52:46] abruptly it it it's it's hard to
[52:48] understand because we're not ready we
[52:50] feel like we're not we're not ready for
[52:53] that uh we're still going down a path
[52:56] and we still figuring things out but so
[52:59] really the time clock is set for him to
[53:03] do what he wants to do and uh uh the
[53:07] Bible also calls it the times of the
[53:10] Gentiles and so but within this time in
[53:15] this time frame we we see uh uh through
[53:19] the message of the hour that there is is
[53:22] is a false Church of false Vine and and
[53:27] so then there's two churches
[53:30] existing uh but only one is being formed
[53:35] at uh to to make up the Bride of Jesus
[53:39] Christ the and and those that um uh are
[53:45] are part of this this body of Christ the
[53:48] bride of Christ uh uh it they are the
[53:53] Overcomers um there and and so
[53:57] uh brother Bram says now of course that
[53:59] false church that false body will always
[54:02] try to usurp the position of the true
[54:05] church and contend that she and not the
[54:09] elect are the real and authentic and the
[54:13] false will try to kill the true so so
[54:17] there has always been a struggle uh in
[54:20] this times of the Gentiles which we even
[54:23] go before that but but uh uh of of a a
[54:27] fight a a a Waring a a a contending or
[54:32] one is trying to kill out and one is
[54:35] trying to to live and and and these
[54:38] things and so but but uh uh even at the
[54:42] beginning of time there's always been
[54:44] two uh um uh and and and so in in the be
[54:50] uh in the Garden of Eden the the Book of
[54:52] Genesis talks about it that there were
[54:54] two main trees that God speaks of and
[54:57] that is the tree of death uh and the
[55:00] Tree of Life One One Tree was good the
[55:05] other tree was evil uh one was a tree of
[55:09] death and the other tree a tree of of
[55:13] Life One produced Life One produced
[55:15] death uh and just them two trees and and
[55:19] then there were two children in the
[55:21] garden there was Cain and Abel and they
[55:24] were Twins and
[55:26] uh uh both offered sacrifices to God but
[55:31] but as we know Cain was the evil one and
[55:35] uh he was his father was the Wicked one
[55:39] for the Bible says he was of that Wicked
[55:41] one and then then you find the other
[55:44] brother Abel he was righteous before the
[55:47] Lord and and loved the Lord and and and
[55:51] so we know his his story things like
[55:53] that but then later on in time there
[55:56] were two other boys that were um uh that
[56:00] that were born of the same flesh uh of
[56:03] Mama and Dad had the same parents and
[56:06] and and they were twins Jacob and Esau
[56:09] and the prophet said one was the elect
[56:11] of God and the other one was a reprobate
[56:14] but if you notice they both worshiped
[56:16] God Cain and Abel both worshiped God
[56:20] Esau and Jacob both worshiped God and so
[56:24] brother Brandon would say in every
[56:26] single case there was uh worship of God
[56:30] involved in every case the evil hated
[56:33] the righteous and persecuted the
[56:35] righteous in some cases the evil
[56:38] destroyed the righteous but notice they
[56:41] were planted together they lived
[56:43] together they both made claims upon God
[56:47] and worshiped God Amen so this this was
[56:50] all the way through the Old Testament
[56:52] then in the New Testament Jesus gives us
[56:55] a parable of of of two sers uh and and
[57:00] they planted seed one planted one seed
[57:03] the other planted another seed and they
[57:05] both planted in the same field so they
[57:08] were planted together they grew up
[57:10] together and matured together and and
[57:13] all these things and so but they planted
[57:16] two different kinds of seed uh uh one uh
[57:19] planted the wheat and and the other
[57:22] planted the tears and we know that God
[57:25] planted the wheat Satan planted the
[57:26] tears and Matthew
[57:29] 13:38 uh Jesus said now the field is the
[57:32] world so really this this wheat and and
[57:36] and tear involves human beings um and
[57:40] and so the the field is the world the
[57:42] good seed are the children of the
[57:45] Kingdom but the tears are the children
[57:48] of the wicked one the enemy that sold
[57:51] them is the devil the Harvest is the end
[57:55] of the world and the reapers are the
[57:57] Angels see so there at the end time then
[58:01] there's going to be a harvest and of of
[58:04] both ain't that right and so as
[58:06] therefore the tears are gathered and
[58:09] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[58:11] end of this world the son of man shall
[58:13] send forth his angels and they Shall
[58:16] Gather out of his kingdom all things
[58:18] that offend and them which do iniquity
[58:21] and shall cast them into a furnace of
[58:24] fire there shall be wailing and nashing
[58:26] of teeth then shall the righteous shine
[58:28] forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their
[58:31] father and so if if you notice not not
[58:35] the wheat that and the tear that are
[58:37] planted in the same field the tear
[58:39] doesn't become the wheat the wheat
[58:41] doesn't become the terror but but yet
[58:44] they they still they they they reap from
[58:46] this they they uh benefit from the rain
[58:50] same rain they benefit from the same
[58:52] sunshine and and they both are growing
[58:55] up see coming to that maturity well then
[58:59] shortly after the day of Pentecost uh uh
[59:02] God planted his church on that day of
[59:05] Pentecost and that was the genuine
[59:07] church that would be the church that God
[59:09] would pattern after uh his All Through
[59:13] the Ages that would be the pattern for
[59:14] all all all all elect down Through the
[59:17] Ages and and uh uh God would be in that
[59:22] church it would be a that that's that's
[59:25] what he would uh uh fulfill his dreams
[59:29] and fulfill his vision and his purpose
[59:31] would be in that in that church but then
[59:35] shortly after the day of Pentecost the
[59:37] the false Vine got
[59:40] intertwined uh uh it it it it
[59:43] intertwined itself around the True Vine
[59:46] and then we find the Deeds of the
[59:49] nicians and so that that Spirit the
[59:52] prophet said has fought the True Vine
[59:55] all the way through through the church
[59:56] ages and will do so until it is
[1:00:00] destroyed by God so there will always be
[1:00:03] that friction there will always be a
[1:00:05] spirit that is Waring against the True
[1:00:08] Vine that true elect there there will
[1:00:10] always be a Warfare until that spirit is
[1:00:14] utterly destroyed ain't that right and
[1:00:17] so then you you you look in the Book of
[1:00:20] Revelations that God addresses each
[1:00:24] church and uh uh and talks about each
[1:00:27] one he and and and and so the the true
[1:00:31] the true church the false church God
[1:00:34] addresses them through the church ages
[1:00:36] and and uh uh uh and talks about them
[1:00:40] and and the prophet said he calls them
[1:00:43] both the true and false he calls them
[1:00:45] the church see and and it's almost as if
[1:00:49] he's talking about one church but he's
[1:00:51] not he's talking about two churches he's
[1:00:54] addressing two churches he calls them
[1:00:57] the church and only the elect will
[1:01:00] really know which is the true spirit for
[1:01:03] only the elect will not be deceived
[1:01:06] ain't that right now so so if God has
[1:01:09] allotted this time himself a time to
[1:01:12] make up this bride and and bring her to
[1:01:14] a maturity and reflect himself through
[1:01:17] her well we we know that this Leota
[1:01:21] Church age is the last of them it's the
[1:01:24] last of the of the the Gentile
[1:01:27] dispensation and that's the age that we
[1:01:30] are living in which which means that the
[1:01:33] door of Mercy is about closed we we
[1:01:37] don't know when that is uh we we do know
[1:01:41] that the prophet preached souls in
[1:01:42] prison and and even at the end he's
[1:01:45] wondering is it already uh you know and
[1:01:49] he's he's tore up about these things and
[1:01:52] and uh but but it it had been so real to
[1:01:56] him uh and and realizing that we are at
[1:02:01] the end of time and he talks about the
[1:02:03] things that when he he had went either
[1:02:06] in a vision or an experience that he
[1:02:08] went into hell and what he saw in Hell
[1:02:11] he actually saw on the earth at a mall
[1:02:14] and he says I'm looking at this and and
[1:02:18] he says it just well you all if you've
[1:02:20] heard heard that message uh uh you you
[1:02:23] know where he was at and it really tore
[1:02:25] him up that what he saw in Hell was now
[1:02:29] there in manifesting itself in this
[1:02:32] dimension of time and and so uh uh and
[1:02:36] so he he was showing or then then he got
[1:02:39] that sermon Soul's in prison now and and
[1:02:43] so but when the the door of Mercy is is
[1:02:46] closed see then the day of Grace will be
[1:02:50] over for the Gentiles amen and then then
[1:02:54] is fulfilled the scripture in
[1:02:56] Revelations 22:11 he that is unjust let
[1:03:00] him be unjust still amen and he which is
[1:03:03] filthy let him be filthy still he that
[1:03:06] is righteous let him be righteous still
[1:03:08] he that is Holy let him be holy still
[1:03:11] amen there comes a time that that what a
[1:03:14] person is it it'll be forever be
[1:03:17] there'll be no changing and and and and
[1:03:20] and this is we're somewhere in somewhere
[1:03:23] at this time and and of course we know
[1:03:27] that as long as the bride is on this
[1:03:29] Earth she'll be doing everything she can
[1:03:32] to reach souls and but but it it but it
[1:03:35] shows exactly the times that we're
[1:03:38] living in and and so uh every
[1:03:41] predestinated seed at the time when that
[1:03:44] door is shut every predestinated seed of
[1:03:47] God will be in and and the bride will be
[1:03:52] complete and and I I believe that we're
[1:03:55] just we're just close there somewhere
[1:03:59] amen where this bride and uh uh uh is
[1:04:03] complete and and then those who are not
[1:04:06] part of the Bride well they're just what
[1:04:08] the prophet would say Canon fod and and
[1:04:12] and and and so uh uh brother Brandon
[1:04:16] says in one place it's a fod that'll mix
[1:04:19] uh with smoke out of Torment he called
[1:04:21] it Atomic ashes and you know in other
[1:04:25] words that they're just here for the
[1:04:27] tribulation and and and they'll it'll
[1:04:30] just be just Atomic ashes now we
[1:04:33] understand that there will be people
[1:04:35] that will make it and receive eternal
[1:04:37] life but we're talking about the bride
[1:04:39] of Christ and and and this Bride is a
[1:04:42] different uh a group of people because
[1:04:46] they won't have to go through
[1:04:47] tribulation
[1:04:48] they they don't have that they have an
[1:04:51] intimate relationship with Christ today
[1:04:54] and and so uh but uh uh Canon F it's
[1:04:57] it's something that's going to be
[1:04:59] destroyed in other words now in in the
[1:05:02] beginning of the book of Revelations and
[1:05:05] and you just have to bear with me but
[1:05:06] John writes to seven churches uh
[1:05:09] Revelations 1:4 John to the seven
[1:05:12] churches which are in Asia and and uh
[1:05:16] just you know Prophet gives us a little
[1:05:18] history of it the these churches are in
[1:05:20] Asia Minor and it it's just it was about
[1:05:23] the size of a pens of Vania or Indiana
[1:05:28] just a small little area and and and and
[1:05:31] so uh uh but he's writing to these
[1:05:33] churches in Asia Minor for the ages uh
[1:05:37] were to come in the future the church
[1:05:40] ages but but see these seven churches
[1:05:43] were were praised and exalted for what
[1:05:46] they had done and and and so uh uh the
[1:05:50] prophet tells us that these these seven
[1:05:52] churches weren't the only churches that
[1:05:55] existed at that time there there were
[1:05:58] other churches that had existed uh uh
[1:06:02] but why would John write to these seven
[1:06:04] churches is because that these churches
[1:06:07] had a characteristic uh about them that
[1:06:11] would be expressed in the church ages to
[1:06:14] come and and and the prophet tells us
[1:06:17] that these churches these seven churches
[1:06:19] were Gentile churches and uh uh uh and
[1:06:23] and so and so John did not address the
[1:06:26] church at Jerusalem which was made up
[1:06:30] mostly of Jews and and things and the
[1:06:33] reason why he didn't do that is is
[1:06:35] because God had already turned from the
[1:06:38] Jews on and and uh to the Gentiles and
[1:06:42] and so these churches and the church
[1:06:44] ages would be to the Gentiles uh uh uh
[1:06:48] people and so brother bradam said so
[1:06:50] thus the whole of the church ages is
[1:06:53] dealing with the gentille and calling
[1:06:56] out a gentile bride to himself ain't
[1:07:00] that right amen see and so each one of
[1:07:03] these churches had a characteristic that
[1:07:07] was
[1:07:08] significant uh uh for for the ages uh to
[1:07:12] come and and brother Brown said that
[1:07:14] characteristics would would follow down
[1:07:16] through the age like Ephesus the first
[1:07:19] church age you know had a
[1:07:21] characteristics and samna had its own
[1:07:24] characteristics and pergamus and thyra
[1:07:28] and and all these things see and so the
[1:07:31] the characteristic of that church would
[1:07:34] appear in the church ages uh uh uh uh to
[1:07:38] come I I hope you understand and so the
[1:07:41] Ephesian Church Age expressed the
[1:07:44] characteristics of the Ephesus Church um
[1:07:48] uh it it told uh it told what the church
[1:07:51] was and the characteristics of that
[1:07:53] church uh and again some little history
[1:07:56] the city of Ephesus was one of the three
[1:07:59] great cities of Asia it was often called
[1:08:02] the third city of Christian faith
[1:08:05] Jerusalem was was the first one uh uh uh
[1:08:09] Antioch and then Ephesus see and so uh
[1:08:13] the city of Ephesus it was a city of
[1:08:15] great Commerce and trade the language
[1:08:18] was Greek the government was Roman and
[1:08:21] and Christianity was established uh in
[1:08:24] Ephesus by by Paul the Apostle amen and
[1:08:28] and his teachings bore great influence
[1:08:32] to the Believers there it was in Paul's
[1:08:35] time that the church was a strong Church
[1:08:38] a church was a was a a a great church
[1:08:41] see uh uh but then uh uh if you look um
[1:08:46] the Ephesian Church age is the first age
[1:08:50] and brother bradam says it's in this age
[1:08:52] the church made up of good is made up of
[1:08:56] good and bad two Vines make the church
[1:09:00] they are like the wheat and tears
[1:09:02] growing up side by side but one is true
[1:09:05] and the other one is false ain't that
[1:09:07] right now if you look in Revelations 2
[1:09:10] and 2 uh uh God is addressing this
[1:09:15] church age the Ephesus Church age
[1:09:17] Ephesian I Know Thy works and thy labor
[1:09:21] and thy patience and how thou canst bear
[1:09:24] them cannot bear them which are evil and
[1:09:28] thou Hast tried them which say they are
[1:09:30] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:09:33] liars and has borne and has patience and
[1:09:36] for my name's sake has labored and hasth
[1:09:39] not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:09:43] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[1:09:46] First Love remember wherefore from
[1:09:49] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[1:09:53] the first Works everybody say the first
[1:09:55] work Works do the first works or else I
[1:09:58] will come unto thee quickly and will
[1:10:00] remove thy Candlestick out of his place
[1:10:03] except thou repent but this thou Hast
[1:10:07] that thou hatest the Deeds of nicians
[1:10:09] which I also hate he that hath an ear
[1:10:13] let him hear what the spirit sath unto
[1:10:15] the churches to him everybody say to him
[1:10:19] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[1:10:22] the tree of life which is in the midst
[1:10:25] of the paradise of God so so uh uh uh
[1:10:30] now the word Ephesus means let go uh uh
[1:10:35] backsliding relax it was called by God
[1:10:39] the backsliding church the backslidden
[1:10:43] age uh um the prophet would say God
[1:10:47] acknowledged first their Works their
[1:10:50] labor and their patience God rebuked
[1:10:54] their living leaving their first love
[1:10:57] for backsliding and for no longer
[1:11:00] bearing light so so he says now Ephesus
[1:11:04] was not a DC church it failed Itself by
[1:11:08] not continuing in perfect love ain't
[1:11:12] that right see and and and so then then
[1:11:17] uh he goes on says and God tells them to
[1:11:20] remember evidently something had left
[1:11:23] their mind they had forgot en something
[1:11:26] he told them to turn back in their minds
[1:11:29] to their point of origin the origin of
[1:11:32] the first age was Pentecost see they had
[1:11:36] fallen from it they had forgotten the
[1:11:38] glory and wonder of it it was time to go
[1:11:41] back in mind and then in reality ain't
[1:11:46] that right see back to when they could
[1:11:48] say for me to live is Christ back to
[1:11:52] Purity when ananas and Safar were dealt
[1:11:55] with back to the gate beautiful oh what
[1:11:57] a reproach it is to drift from God and
[1:12:00] countenance those acts that defile his
[1:12:04] name see let those who name his name
[1:12:07] depart from sin and keep their vessels
[1:12:10] pure for God see look at what you were
[1:12:13] you once were in your heart and mind and
[1:12:16] in your life and then go back to it
[1:12:18] ain't that right now see so that's that
[1:12:21] was God's uh uh uh uh ad
[1:12:25] I guess or uh uh to that first church
[1:12:29] church age was to go back what whatever
[1:12:32] left in your mind go back amen go back
[1:12:37] to your origin go back to where God was
[1:12:40] number one in your life go back to where
[1:12:43] you were on fire for God go back to
[1:12:46] where the God could do the mighty Works
[1:12:49] in in in in your life ain't that right
[1:12:52] now the the way back is the way of
[1:12:55] repentance God was telling them to
[1:12:58] repent and and and go back you see God
[1:13:01] gave that eisan age a chance to repent
[1:13:06] just like he did Cain and and yet it
[1:13:10] refused to do so now we know what repent
[1:13:13] means it means to turn from to go back
[1:13:17] and get your first experience ain't that
[1:13:20] right repent to turn from go back turn
[1:13:24] from and and go back to your your first
[1:13:28] experience see in other words do the
[1:13:30] things that you did at the beginning you
[1:13:33] know I I think that so many people today
[1:13:35] need to go back amen and and do their
[1:13:38] first works and you know it's easy a lot
[1:13:41] of times to uh uh e Even in our own
[1:13:45] lives uh to where we we forget about the
[1:13:49] the things of God and we let the the
[1:13:52] things of God become common we let the
[1:13:54] message become common we let our
[1:13:56] freedoms to worship God become common we
[1:13:59] we let our Christianity become common
[1:14:02] and and and see and so you know people
[1:14:05] used to be on fire for God and you know
[1:14:08] they they wouldn't let nothing
[1:14:10] discourage them they would be at church
[1:14:12] no matter what it it just they they were
[1:14:15] on fire for God they they wouldn't let
[1:14:17] little things uh keep them down you know
[1:14:21] it it just sad when you see matur people
[1:14:24] get into a go gossiping session and and
[1:14:27] and things and you're thinking that's
[1:14:28] not a Christian that's that's not what
[1:14:30] Christians do is down the church down
[1:14:33] the people down this down that and so
[1:14:37] negative about things and it it but but
[1:14:40] it they feed off of that instead of
[1:14:42] feeding off the the the the the the life
[1:14:46] of the word that that we're supposed to
[1:14:49] nowadays people can't even take time to
[1:14:52] come to the house of God and just to
[1:14:54] give things for what God has done for
[1:14:57] them they've got so many excuses that
[1:14:59] they live by anymore if they got just a
[1:15:01] snotty nose uh they can't come to church
[1:15:04] if they if you know and and God has done
[1:15:07] so much for people and and and I I just
[1:15:10] have to tell you it's a backsliding
[1:15:12] condition that that's what it is amen I
[1:15:16] know you Justified people justify these
[1:15:18] things but but I'll just tell you what
[1:15:20] you are you're backslid it's it's just
[1:15:22] that way it's it's it's a backslid
[1:15:25] condition to to uh uh uh when we become
[1:15:30] so weak in our faith that we can't trust
[1:15:33] God for things anymore you understand
[1:15:36] what I'm saying right see so God told
[1:15:38] them to repent and do the first Works go
[1:15:42] back to the first works you see
[1:15:44] Christianity has Works how many believes
[1:15:46] that Christianity has Works amen see
[1:15:51] brother Brandon would say it this way
[1:15:52] you are saved by grace how many believes
[1:15:54] that you are saved by grace you you
[1:15:57] cannot Merit your salvation uh nothing
[1:16:00] that you can do can can Merit the the uh
[1:16:03] the the uh uh Salvation it's the Grace
[1:16:06] Grace saves you Grace is what God does
[1:16:09] for you amen and we're so glad for that
[1:16:12] amen but notice what he says next Works
[1:16:15] everybody say works is what you do for
[1:16:18] God to show appreciation of what God did
[1:16:22] for you amen see works and Grace go
[1:16:25] together see as if if you know if if I
[1:16:29] would you know uh you know I don't know
[1:16:33] I I'll say Sister Kim Sister Kim weeks
[1:16:36] if if I if I had a million dollars and I
[1:16:38] gave you uh
[1:16:41] $500,000 and I say you know you and John
[1:16:43] y'all go take you a trip to the Bahamas
[1:16:46] y'all it's all paid for and all that I
[1:16:48] guarantee you I guarantee you amen
[1:16:52] someone's going to be excited about it
[1:16:53] somebody's going to say thank thank you
[1:16:55] for that and somebody's going to show an
[1:16:57] appreciation amen because that she
[1:17:00] didn't have to earn it John didn't have
[1:17:02] to earn it amen that they didn't have it
[1:17:05] but I gave it to them amen and then it
[1:17:07] it it requires not that I demand that
[1:17:10] they show appreciation but there's
[1:17:12] something within them that they're
[1:17:14] Overjoyed about it they're excited about
[1:17:17] it they they they you you understand and
[1:17:20] and and there's things that people have
[1:17:22] done for us that we think oh wow you
[1:17:25] know and and you can't help but just uh
[1:17:27] uh go to them and say I thank you for
[1:17:29] that I send them a card of thanks and
[1:17:31] send them this uh or whatever see and
[1:17:34] it's without money or without price God
[1:17:36] gave you that salvation without you
[1:17:38] having to do nothing back amen but
[1:17:41] there's now we return this as a as in an
[1:17:45] appreciation if God saved your soul
[1:17:48] there should not be a number of days
[1:17:50] amen that you would count and say well
[1:17:52] I've done enough to show my appreciation
[1:17:55] amen if he saved your soul that means he
[1:17:57] you're going to live eternally with him
[1:18:00] amen and that should re that should
[1:18:02] require a a a a response from us as long
[1:18:06] as we live whether we're sick or whether
[1:18:09] we're well whether we're discouraged or
[1:18:11] whether we're up on the Mountaintop
[1:18:13] where whether God answers a prayer or
[1:18:16] whether he doesn't answer a prayer just
[1:18:18] to know that we're saved amen requires
[1:18:22] amen a response from us see so works is
[1:18:26] what you do for God then so God is
[1:18:28] telling them go do your works again it
[1:18:31] shows that if there's not a a a a joy to
[1:18:35] serve God if there's not a joy amen just
[1:18:40] to to come to the house of God and offer
[1:18:43] than it shows your back sliding praise
[1:18:46] the Lord amen that's right now notice he
[1:18:52] says now he says now young man young
[1:18:54] woman woman this morning or you old man
[1:18:57] or woman who's never been a Christian
[1:18:59] God's continually knocked at your heart
[1:19:02] oh yes now NOS why he says you might
[1:19:04] come in at the end of the road but
[1:19:06] you'll have no joy there will be no
[1:19:09] stars around you to shine he said I
[1:19:11] don't want to go like that I want to
[1:19:13] hear him say it was well done my good
[1:19:15] and faithful servant I want to show him
[1:19:18] my
[1:19:20] appreciation you understand what I'm
[1:19:22] saying that's why we win souls amen it's
[1:19:24] not to go go to heaven but to show our
[1:19:26] appreciation I got to tell somebody what
[1:19:28] he done for me amen see everything that
[1:19:31] we do is to show our appreciation he
[1:19:35] said see my poor little old gray-headed
[1:19:37] wife how I would love to do something
[1:19:39] for her that I know she likes because I
[1:19:42] love her I I know she loves me and if I
[1:19:45] do that for my wife in the human love
[1:19:47] what do I have to do to know that God by
[1:19:50] grace before the foundation of the world
[1:19:52] seen me a poor little sinner staggering
[1:19:54] and was going to hell and couldn't help
[1:19:56] it and he for ordained me and put my
[1:19:59] name in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:20:01] the foundation of the world oh I love
[1:20:03] him do you love him oh I love him I
[1:20:07] don't want nothing to come between me
[1:20:09] and and my love for him or my love in
[1:20:13] him see amen don't want nothing he said
[1:20:15] see there's no way at all for it to ever
[1:20:18] tell him of our love see amen no wonder
[1:20:22] the Bible says Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has
[1:20:24] Not Heard neither has it entered in the
[1:20:26] hearts of men oh my how glorious God is
[1:20:29] don't you want to trust him if you're
[1:20:31] weary and tossed about shame on you
[1:20:33] Christians that call yourself Christians
[1:20:35] and go around so weary well I don't know
[1:20:39] if I go to the church well oh you're a
[1:20:41] poor excuse let me tell you lift up your
[1:20:44] head straighten up your chest oh my use
[1:20:47] faith faith is the boss that's right
[1:20:50] faith has hairs on his chest brother I
[1:20:52] mean it's gotten big muscles and and
[1:20:54] when it speaks all the worries drop from
[1:20:57] one side the other and the devil says
[1:21:00] now see now you just can't make it you
[1:21:02] can't do this and you're ashamed to
[1:21:04] testify that faith will raise up and say
[1:21:07] shut up I've got the floor amen amen see
[1:21:11] Faith takes the initiative see so this
[1:21:14] church should have been red hot they
[1:21:17] they should have been on fire amen but
[1:21:20] they they had left their first love and
[1:21:22] here God is saying go back and do your
[1:21:24] first works over go back and do your
[1:21:27] first Works can you say amen amen that's
[1:21:30] right see of course people don't do that
[1:21:32] today they don't have that Burly Faith
[1:21:34] because the prophet already said it
[1:21:36] faith is slow in these days can't trust
[1:21:40] God for anything hardly anymore amen
[1:21:42] some little thing goes on we just grip
[1:21:45] and fuss and and all of these things
[1:21:47] instead of saying God you're a way maker
[1:21:49] you're you're you're more than able and
[1:21:52] and if it's if it has to do with my
[1:21:54] brother I'm going to God bless my
[1:21:56] brother if it has to do with my sister
[1:21:57] if it has to do with the church if it
[1:21:59] has to do with whatever God just bless
[1:22:01] them abundantly I know you're more than
[1:22:05] able but we don't do that see now see so
[1:22:09] the faith is slow to where they can't
[1:22:11] trust God to take care of them all right
[1:22:16] they have more respect to what some
[1:22:18] unregenerated doctor has to say about
[1:22:21] the conditions then they then they do
[1:22:23] what God has to to say about things
[1:22:26] God's word says I am the god that Health
[1:22:28] all thy diseases that should be more
[1:22:30] than what a doctor would tell you well
[1:22:32] you're going to die oh you can't go
[1:22:34] around you got you know you got this and
[1:22:36] you got that and you got this if it came
[1:22:38] to God and it's going to take me away
[1:22:40] from worshiping God if it's going to
[1:22:42] take me away from the things of God I'll
[1:22:45] take God's word over over the doctor's
[1:22:48] word any day can you say Amen but what
[1:22:51] is it it takes a faith somebody's got to
[1:22:53] have a strong faith and stand there and
[1:22:57] say devil put whatever you want on me
[1:22:59] but God's already said no weapon formed
[1:23:02] against me is going to
[1:23:06] prosper can you say Amen Psalms
[1:23:10] 56:4 it says in God will I will praise
[1:23:13] His word in God I have put my trust I
[1:23:18] will not fear what flesh can do unto me
[1:23:21] Psalms 1186 the Lord is on my
[1:23:25] I will not fear what can man do unto me
[1:23:29] and I'll say it this way what can the
[1:23:32] the diseases of this world do unto me
[1:23:34] what can the germs in this world do unto
[1:23:37] me what can Satan do unto me he can't do
[1:23:41] nothing for the Lord is on my side how
[1:23:44] many's got the faith enough to believe
[1:23:46] that the Lord is on your
[1:23:50] side see Hebrews 13 and5 let your
[1:23:54] convers ation be without covet us be
[1:23:57] content with such things as you have for
[1:24:00] he hath said I will never leave thee nor
[1:24:03] forsake thee amen that's a promise can
[1:24:05] you say amen he has said I will never
[1:24:08] leave thee nor forsake thee so that we
[1:24:10] may boldly say the Lord is my help
[1:24:14] helper and I will not fear what man
[1:24:18] shall do unto me so now it was a
[1:24:22] backsliding age that first age
[1:24:25] amen and and the summary of that age was
[1:24:29] fruits without love and it led to
[1:24:33] apostasy ain't that right so God
[1:24:36] addresses the age and rebukes it and it
[1:24:40] looks like he's rebuking the whole
[1:24:41] church but he's not amen then after he
[1:24:46] rebukes it then he looks and says but he
[1:24:50] that
[1:24:51] overcomes he that overcomes everybody
[1:24:53] say he that overcomes see amen see he
[1:24:57] now he's going to address the elect amen
[1:25:00] he that
[1:25:01] overcometh amen there's rewards for them
[1:25:04] that
[1:25:06] overcome can you say Amen there's always
[1:25:10] been Overcomers down through the
[1:25:13] age now the Overcomer is the individual
[1:25:17] it's not the entire group amen he he
[1:25:21] that overcome the the in individual see
[1:25:24] brother Braham said see it shows that
[1:25:26] it's not the church body that overcomes
[1:25:29] or it would have said she that
[1:25:32] overcometh church represents woman ain't
[1:25:35] that right but he that overcome the
[1:25:38] individual every one of us as
[1:25:41] individuals I got to have our walk with
[1:25:43] God and got to
[1:25:46] overcome this isn't a group
[1:25:49] thing that's the thing we want to
[1:25:51] identify with groups clubs
[1:25:55] join everybody wants to join something
[1:25:57] cuz nobody wants to stand
[1:25:59] out but if you're going to overcome you
[1:26:02] it's an individual thing
[1:26:05] amen and you say Amen brother Braham
[1:26:08] said the individual that overcomes is
[1:26:10] the bride coming out amen see the age
[1:26:14] it's not the age that overcomes it's the
[1:26:16] individual that
[1:26:18] elect see so so now there there are
[1:26:23] Overcomers and they are a
[1:26:25] few that have not
[1:26:28] defiled their garments can you say Amen
[1:26:32] brother brand said we used to have a
[1:26:34] saying years ago keep your skirts clean
[1:26:37] see it meant don't get involved in
[1:26:39] questionable things now listen now this
[1:26:42] is the
[1:26:43] Overcomer amen we're not worried about
[1:26:45] what people of the age does we're
[1:26:47] talking to that Overcomer amen you got
[1:26:50] to keep your garments undefiled
[1:26:54] ain't that right keep your skirt clean
[1:26:57] see don't get involved in questionable
[1:27:00] things others will be involved and you
[1:27:02] might be tempted to be involved or
[1:27:05] somebody might try to involve you but
[1:27:09] stay clear of it all by steering a
[1:27:11] course away from
[1:27:14] it hello now that's that that that's
[1:27:17] where all of us now all the way down
[1:27:20] here to this layot of sea and age Amen
[1:27:22] to that overcomer keep your garments
[1:27:26] undefiled stay away from the
[1:27:28] questionable things things that would
[1:27:31] entice you things well brother Bram
[1:27:33] called it enticing Spirits so see now in
[1:27:37] order to overcome in order to keep your
[1:27:39] garment undefiled you're going to have
[1:27:42] to have your own
[1:27:44] convictions amen about things now
[1:27:47] conviction means a strong persuasion or
[1:27:52] belief the state of being con vinced I
[1:27:54] am convinced just like like I am
[1:27:57] convinced that this message is right
[1:27:59] that's my
[1:28:00] conviction amen you don't have to have
[1:28:04] that conviction but that's my conviction
[1:28:07] and by that conviction I'll
[1:28:09] overcome Lord right see so so I I it's a
[1:28:15] strong persuasion or belief the
[1:28:18] statement of being convinced the act of
[1:28:20] convincing a person of error or
[1:28:23] compelling the admission of a truth so
[1:28:26] see if you're going to overcome you're
[1:28:29] going to have to have
[1:28:31] convictions
[1:28:34] amen you love him amen you cannot go by
[1:28:38] somebody else's
[1:28:40] convictions just like my children
[1:28:42] they're growing up now they lived under
[1:28:45] by my
[1:28:47] convictions but now they're they're
[1:28:49] they're marrying getting out out on
[1:28:51] their own now they've got to have their
[1:28:52] own convictions
[1:28:54] cuz trust me the devil's going to try to
[1:28:56] defile their garments just as much as
[1:28:58] he's tried to defile
[1:29:00] ours see you you you cannot stand
[1:29:04] against the Devil by what I believe the
[1:29:07] only way you'll be able to stand against
[1:29:09] that Devil Is by your own
[1:29:11] convictions you understand what I'm
[1:29:12] saying he that
[1:29:14] overcometh you know I often I prayed to
[1:29:17] God God bring give me convictions don't
[1:29:19] ever let me lose my
[1:29:22] convictions ain't that right
[1:29:24] if I don't have convictions that I ain't
[1:29:26] going to stand for
[1:29:27] nothing and if I don't stand for
[1:29:29] something I'm going to fall for
[1:29:31] anything that's right ain't that right
[1:29:34] see so you cannot stand for Christ and
[1:29:37] Bible standards by what someone else's
[1:29:39] believes it's what you personally
[1:29:42] believe to be the truth and if you don't
[1:29:46] know the truth about something it's up
[1:29:48] to you to search it
[1:29:50] out
[1:29:52] ask see seek yeah
[1:29:56] knock can you say Amen now this is the
[1:30:00] time that you got to have convictions
[1:30:02] yeah praise the Lord that's right now
[1:30:06] the word of God is truth amen so you
[1:30:09] know there there are a lot of people
[1:30:11] that have
[1:30:13] convictions but their convictions don't
[1:30:15] line up with the Bible and the and the
[1:30:18] message it's fine to have convictions
[1:30:21] it's fine but we we want convictions to
[1:30:24] line up with the God's word amen and the
[1:30:27] message can you say Amen it's just like
[1:30:29] this and this is just something very
[1:30:30] simple and something that I wanted just
[1:30:32] to put out there you know there are
[1:30:34] people who have that have convictions
[1:30:37] about a woman's sleeve length they think
[1:30:39] it should be such such long and certain
[1:30:42] certain length and certain this and
[1:30:44] certain that someone asked me a while
[1:30:45] back do you preach on on sleeve lengths
[1:30:49] for a
[1:30:50] woman I I said well I don't guess I have
[1:30:53] well you should now wasn't anyone that
[1:30:56] goes to our church so they started
[1:30:59] talking about other churches that don't
[1:31:01] do that and pastors that don't do them
[1:31:04] things but you know it it was funniest
[1:31:06] thing because I I uh wasn't even it I
[1:31:10] just blew it off you know I mean you
[1:31:12] know I I figured if God deals with me to
[1:31:14] do it I'll do it but at one day I was
[1:31:17] studying uh uh a while back uh a after
[1:31:21] this that that we had the conversation
[1:31:24] and and and I saw this someone asked the
[1:31:27] prophet what link should a woman's
[1:31:29] sleeve be and he says now I don't think
[1:31:32] that is anything about that I I don't
[1:31:34] know what I can't back up with the Bible
[1:31:37] I don't want to say much about it the
[1:31:39] lengths of sleeves I think being a
[1:31:42] Christian God would tell you what to do
[1:31:44] about those things see I believe as a
[1:31:46] Christian person you you would know
[1:31:49] about how to do that I don't think God
[1:31:51] Cuts any certain links or whatever it is
[1:31:54] as long as you're decent and look
[1:31:57] honorable and
[1:32:00] clean can you say amen he said I think
[1:32:03] that's all right now that's just my
[1:32:05] opinion now this is me cuz I can't back
[1:32:08] nothing else up with the scripture see
[1:32:11] so it it good conviction but our
[1:32:14] convictions must be based upon the Bible
[1:32:17] right and the message some some don't
[1:32:21] think that a woman should have a
[1:32:22] necklace I you know some was just
[1:32:24] telling me the other day that they don't
[1:32:25] believe in in women having necklaces and
[1:32:28] and all that and and actually went to a
[1:32:30] scripture to prove their point and I
[1:32:32] just sat there and listened yes sir yeah
[1:32:34] I yeah and you know that's fine but when
[1:32:37] asked if a Christian woman should wear a
[1:32:39] necklace brother Braham said now this is
[1:32:41] me not the Lord if you had a pen that
[1:32:44] you wanted to wear or a little necklace
[1:32:46] your husband give you maybe you know
[1:32:48] something like that that you wore now to
[1:32:50] me I don't think that's bad see now
[1:32:53] that's just me I make myself clear
[1:32:54] that's my opinion but I think it's the
[1:32:56] approach to it it's the way you do it
[1:32:59] it's the motive behind it you understand
[1:33:01] what I'm saying see it's the spirit
[1:33:03] what's motivating you to do those things
[1:33:06] but anything what what's a woman can
[1:33:08] have long hair and have pride about it
[1:33:10] and it's just as wrong as as anything
[1:33:14] else he said see and when you see it's
[1:33:17] getting a hold of you then leave the
[1:33:19] thing alone see if it's getting a hold
[1:33:22] of you then leave it alone if that's
[1:33:25] something you're struggling with and
[1:33:27] it's becoming a pride
[1:33:31] issue and it's becoming a vanity
[1:33:35] issue and you see that a spirit is
[1:33:38] motivating it leave it alone now I'm not
[1:33:41] to judge that or whatever don't try to
[1:33:43] make everybody else do it because here's
[1:33:45] what a prophet is
[1:33:47] saying you understand what I'm saying he
[1:33:49] said now I know you Nazarene people it
[1:33:51] used to be that you wouldn't even AP ize
[1:33:54] a woman with a wedding ring on what
[1:33:56] convictions see I don't believe that as
[1:33:59] necessary in the Bible they wore wedding
[1:34:01] rings only it was a tablet they called
[1:34:04] it around their head nine pieces of coin
[1:34:07] in it but to show that they were married
[1:34:09] I think that's all right if if women
[1:34:11] want to dress and make themselves look
[1:34:14] decent and clean ladylike well I think
[1:34:16] there's not a thing to that to me see
[1:34:19] but when you get to go to put that thing
[1:34:21] into making it a little pride then
[1:34:24] you're wrong see it's your attitude see
[1:34:27] do you he said do you women I know this
[1:34:29] a little lengthy but I hope it helps do
[1:34:31] you women remember here not long ago
[1:34:34] that they that they had what they called
[1:34:36] Scandal skirts I think they're coming
[1:34:38] out again and they they or or they got
[1:34:42] worse see they're scandalous now instead
[1:34:46] you know Scandal but they they used to
[1:34:49] have a playback not long ago they they
[1:34:52] had the girls young women of course the
[1:34:54] old ones do it would do it too because
[1:34:57] they they all want to be young he I
[1:34:59] don't mean you sisters I mean the women
[1:35:00] of the world they'd cut their skirt up
[1:35:03] high about a foot high every time and
[1:35:06] then wear some kind of underneath
[1:35:08] garment to look pretty see well and when
[1:35:12] they would make a step it would show
[1:35:14] this underneath garment with the lace
[1:35:16] and Frills or whatever it was on it see
[1:35:20] and and and I want to set this our
[1:35:22] message girls are doing this too you
[1:35:24] know is is they wear these leg leggings
[1:35:28] pant leggings and then they're raising
[1:35:30] their skirts up I think that is just as
[1:35:32] wrong as anything
[1:35:35] else hello it's true couple girls a few
[1:35:40] years ago when skiing they had a little
[1:35:42] mini skirts on and then but that seemed
[1:35:44] to be okay because they had their
[1:35:46] leggings now it's
[1:35:49] wrong got to have some
[1:35:51] convictions not everything that the
[1:35:53] world world says is right is right for
[1:35:57] you can you say
[1:36:00] Amen okay some of you did see so there
[1:36:04] was a girl come to me which was a dunker
[1:36:07] girl had just received the Holy Ghost
[1:36:10] she belonged to the assembly of the god
[1:36:12] that was in Fort Wayne Indiana where I
[1:36:14] was married and when she come to me a
[1:36:16] little fine lady she said brother
[1:36:18] brandom I want to ask you a question I
[1:36:20] said all right sister what is it she
[1:36:22] said do you think it's wrong for a girl
[1:36:24] a Christian girl to wear a scandal skirt
[1:36:26] and I said sisters this is one thing I
[1:36:28] just can't understand what is a scandal
[1:36:30] skirt and she told me what it was and
[1:36:33] she said it shows the underskirt I said
[1:36:36] what is in a woman that would want uh
[1:36:40] would make her to want her to show her
[1:36:43] underneath clothes to some man that's
[1:36:46] right you understand what I'm saying so
[1:36:48] he's not talking about a woman showing
[1:36:50] her thighs he's talking about a woman
[1:36:53] showing her underneath
[1:36:59] garments what is in a woman that would
[1:37:02] make her want to show her underneath
[1:37:04] clothes to some men what business has a
[1:37:08] Christian girl got doing a thing like
[1:37:10] that he said could you imagine a
[1:37:13] Christian he said now look a man there's
[1:37:16] not much to him when it comes to a body
[1:37:19] if he went half naked there wouldn't be
[1:37:20] no Scandal to it not holding for for men
[1:37:24] he said but you know uh uh what kind of
[1:37:26] a woman would be tempted by a man with
[1:37:29] his shirt off and shorts on or whatever
[1:37:31] he had the big old Burly looking thing
[1:37:33] looks sloppy and sickly see horrible and
[1:37:36] and these men out here well I think that
[1:37:38] it' make a woman uh vomit to look at
[1:37:41] such a thing see he says but now you
[1:37:44] take a woman and put her like that
[1:37:46] that's a different
[1:37:49] tiple but here is the age that we're
[1:37:52] living in they want to make it to where
[1:37:54] there's no difference men and women are
[1:37:57] equal no they're
[1:38:00] not can you say Amen they're not
[1:38:06] equal amen he said see so so he said but
[1:38:10] you take a woman and put her like that
[1:38:12] that's a different tiple he said you
[1:38:14] understand but now I think as far as a
[1:38:16] necklace now if you go to loading
[1:38:18] yourself up like you went through a 10
[1:38:20] cent store down here with a magnet on
[1:38:22] you he said well he said excuse that I
[1:38:25] didn't mean to say it like that but
[1:38:26] that's
[1:38:27] wrong amen can you say Amen see so then
[1:38:31] we we must have Bible
[1:38:35] convictions convictions see and and and
[1:38:38] our
[1:38:39] convictions is the doctrine that we live
[1:38:43] by that's why we don't get convictions
[1:38:46] by Creed we don't get our convictions by
[1:38:49] denomination or a Dogma or whatever
[1:38:52] they've got to be Bible convictions
[1:38:54] that's why God would send us a
[1:38:56] prophet to put balance to it that's
[1:39:00] right can you say Amen see and and that
[1:39:03] is the doctrine by which we live every
[1:39:06] every one of you mothers should have a
[1:39:08] Doctrine convictions on how to raise
[1:39:10] your your your your children every one
[1:39:13] of you wives should have convictions on
[1:39:15] how to to to uh live amen toward your
[1:39:20] husband in your marriage every one of
[1:39:22] you fight should have convictions on how
[1:39:25] to lead your children and your family
[1:39:27] amen and and how to be a husband to your
[1:39:30] wife and we should have convictions on
[1:39:32] how we come to the house of
[1:39:35] God Amen can you say
[1:39:38] Amen yes sir see we must have Bible
[1:39:41] convictions see and and them convictions
[1:39:45] be our
[1:39:47] Doctrine because see Doctrine is the
[1:39:51] backbone of the
[1:39:54] church that word backbone it's the main
[1:39:57] support see the major sustaining Factor
[1:40:01] the foundation or most substantial or
[1:40:04] sturdiest part of something see so now
[1:40:08] brother brandham had talked to a boy who
[1:40:10] had went down a wrong path of life and
[1:40:14] got into some trouble and he was he was
[1:40:16] now dying of a veneral disease and
[1:40:19] things and brother Bram said aren't you
[1:40:21] ashamed of yourself aren't you Ash
[1:40:23] ashamed of yourself your mother was a
[1:40:25] Christian mother what happened and and
[1:40:28] and the boy explained he said I just got
[1:40:30] out said see the first cigarette I
[1:40:32] smoked and some of the boys told me said
[1:40:35] just be smart and then the girls began
[1:40:38] to tease me see and I started smoking he
[1:40:41] did not have conviction of his own his
[1:40:45] mother was a Christian she wouldn't have
[1:40:48] done them things but he needed them
[1:40:51] convictions
[1:40:54] yeah he said I started you know he said
[1:40:57] I didn't mean to become that way and I
[1:40:58] started drinking I didn't mean to just
[1:41:00] to show a sociable drink and a glass of
[1:41:02] beer and just one thing left led to
[1:41:05] another and brother Bram said that's the
[1:41:07] way it is shun everybody say shun the
[1:41:11] appearance of evil have this first thing
[1:41:14] in front of you and when it's evil say
[1:41:18] no can you say amen he said need to say
[1:41:21] that no when it comes to your phone no
[1:41:26] when it comes to looking at pornography
[1:41:28] no I am a Son of
[1:41:31] God when it comes to spending your time
[1:41:34] and wasting your time on on all this
[1:41:36] entertainment say no I am a Son of God
[1:41:42] prise the Lord that's right got to have
[1:41:44] convictions amen see he says see need to
[1:41:48] say that no that settles it see don't
[1:41:51] have a wishbone have a backbone like
[1:41:53] that stand out when you know you're
[1:41:56] right if you believe in God if you're
[1:41:58] born again you will do it that's right
[1:42:01] there's no question about that if you're
[1:42:03] born again it'll take care of itself can
[1:42:06] you say amen I understand we we fall we
[1:42:09] come up short but I I I'm talking about
[1:42:12] staying in that hell hole staying down
[1:42:16] the devil got you one trick get
[1:42:21] up amen
[1:42:24] amen we should be striving daily to get
[1:42:27] closer to the
[1:42:30] Lord see so we're living in a Le oysan
[1:42:33] age and I'm going to try to wrap it up
[1:42:35] real soon from what I read in the
[1:42:40] Bible the Le oysan Church age is the
[1:42:43] only age that is considered by God to be
[1:42:47] a
[1:42:47] lukewarm
[1:42:49] age it's the last age brother Bram said
[1:42:52] it's the most dangerous age Paul would
[1:42:55] say in 2 Timothy 3:1 know this this know
[1:42:59] also that in the last times perilous
[1:43:01] time shall come and the word perilous
[1:43:04] means dangerous to to lower as into a
[1:43:08] void difficult meaning the idea of
[1:43:11] reducing the strength now you think of
[1:43:15] that dangerous times were going to come
[1:43:18] perilous times because people's strength
[1:43:21] will be reduced right
[1:43:25] amen that's right can you say man now
[1:43:30] watch he goes on in the second verse for
[1:43:32] men shall be lovers of their own PL of
[1:43:34] their own selves Covetous boasters proud
[1:43:37] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:43:39] unthankful Unholy without natural
[1:43:42] affection truce Breakers false accusers
[1:43:44] incontinent fears despisers of those
[1:43:46] that are good traitor he high-m minded
[1:43:49] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:43:51] God and having a for of godliness having
[1:43:54] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:43:57] power thereof from such turn away can
[1:44:00] you say man now it's not hard for us to
[1:44:03] see that this is being fulfilled in this
[1:44:06] day that we're living
[1:44:09] in people are doing things saying things
[1:44:14] acting in any old way doing things that
[1:44:18] is absolutely against God a contrary to
[1:44:23] God and yet they have a form of
[1:44:27] godliness that's right it's the age
[1:44:31] lukewarm
[1:44:33] amen can't you can't you just now Church
[1:44:36] you all know where I'm at you know what
[1:44:38] I'm talking
[1:44:40] about
[1:44:41] on people's let down so
[1:44:45] much in their own lives
[1:44:53] I said you know brother Braham said
[1:44:54] faith will be slow now brother Braham
[1:44:56] said this is the age of
[1:44:58] hypocrisy lukewarm hypocrisy yeah
[1:45:03] because it's it's a state of having a
[1:45:05] foot in the world and the foot in
[1:45:07] church it's a baeling it's it's it's a
[1:45:10] it's a place now you know brother Brown
[1:45:13] said the Holy Spirit had nothing kind to
[1:45:15] say about this Le oan age you said this
[1:45:18] age is the worst bunch of them
[1:45:20] all ain't that right he said all the
[1:45:24] rest of the Ages were under torments and
[1:45:26] everything they had they had nothing
[1:45:29] they was poverty stricken wandered about
[1:45:31] in sheep skin and goat skins and
[1:45:33] destitute and sold and burned to death
[1:45:37] and fed to lions and everything else and
[1:45:39] still held the faith and this bunch is
[1:45:43] Rich and they have need of nothing and
[1:45:45] everything else and a prostitute because
[1:45:48] it's a lukewarm
[1:45:50] age people don't trust God anymore to
[1:45:54] supply their
[1:45:55] needs they're looking to politicians to
[1:45:57] do
[1:45:59] it
[1:46:01] hello and I'm going to tell you both
[1:46:03] both both candidates are just as Heathen
[1:46:06] as Heathen can get when you got a man up
[1:46:09] there talking filth before all the
[1:46:13] people just like he did the other day I
[1:46:15] mean just a perver just
[1:46:18] filth and then you got preachers praying
[1:46:20] for him oh God bless him oh God he's the
[1:46:24] he's the one that's going to get return
[1:46:26] us back to our ways ways no God sent a
[1:46:31] prophet to return us back and they
[1:46:33] rejected that
[1:46:38] Prophet can you say
[1:46:43] Amen I'm I'm just saying it but we'll go
[1:46:47] so far because we want life easy for us
[1:46:50] we want things just right and he's
[1:46:52] promised it to us what about God's
[1:46:56] promises and God doesn't have to talk
[1:46:58] filth and talk dirty and and and and act
[1:47:01] like a act like a Christian to get you
[1:47:04] your vote he's just he's
[1:47:08] righteous he's gone all out to save you
[1:47:12] he's gone out to prove that he's the god
[1:47:16] that you need he'll Supply your every
[1:47:18] need he'll heal all your
[1:47:21] diseases he can create when there's
[1:47:23] nothing
[1:47:27] there believe it
[1:47:30] am I remember a man by the name of
[1:47:33] shouey I believe it was I believe it was
[1:47:36] him or uh maybe it was M brother
[1:47:40] McDonald and but he was an older man and
[1:47:43] talk about how that they they were
[1:47:45] poures into Times of
[1:47:47] depression
[1:47:49] and didn't have food and he was walking
[1:47:52] somewhere at think to preach or whatever
[1:47:54] but he was
[1:47:56] hungry and he didn't know what he was
[1:47:58] going to do but he was
[1:48:01] starving and there he was walking on
[1:48:04] that trail
[1:48:07] and he said he just got to pray and
[1:48:11] Lord You're the god that you're the god
[1:48:14] that supplies the
[1:48:15] needs Lord I'm trusting you you know
[1:48:19] what what I'm needing you know I'm
[1:48:20] hungry all that I I just need some food
[1:48:24] if you just Supply it he said Lord I
[1:48:27] just thank you for for hearing my prayer
[1:48:29] and as he began to walk he walked I
[1:48:31] don't know how long he how how much more
[1:48:33] time he walked but he looked and right
[1:48:35] on that pathway was was a sack and he
[1:48:38] opened that sack and it was a hot hot
[1:48:42] meal looked around nobody was
[1:48:46] around and he ate
[1:48:48] it God
[1:48:51] provided can he do do that again sure he
[1:48:58] can church is coming to a place that
[1:49:00] we're going to have to trust God that's
[1:49:02] right amen can you say Amen not depend
[1:49:06] upon the technology not depend upon the
[1:49:08] medical and not depend on everything
[1:49:10] else we got to depend upon the source of
[1:49:12] it all
[1:49:14] God that's God but this is a lukewarm
[1:49:18] age a you know and and and so uh
[1:49:22] lukewarm is mildly warm lacking
[1:49:24] conviction or enthusiasm as Webster
[1:49:28] would say uh lacking conviction or
[1:49:30] enthusiasm indifferent half-hearted see
[1:49:34] and and and so then then if that be the
[1:49:36] case then it shows there's not going to
[1:49:38] be too many Overcomers in this age now
[1:49:41] there are going to be Overcomers and
[1:49:43] them Overcomers are going to be that
[1:49:44] elect but not too many are cuz they're
[1:49:48] fighting a war lukewarm where no
[1:49:50] convictions there's nothing there people
[1:49:53] standing for truth right they want to
[1:49:57] fit in they don't want to hurt they
[1:49:59] don't want to
[1:50:00] offend they get more mad at the preacher
[1:50:02] than they do the senator they get more
[1:50:04] mad at the church than they do the
[1:50:06] ungodliness out
[1:50:12] there brother Braham said there'll be
[1:50:14] just very very few in that in in that
[1:50:16] Rapture that'll be changed can you say
[1:50:18] Amen you love the Lord amen so since the
[1:50:22] first chch AG Jesus has been steadily
[1:50:25] been pushed out pushed aside until in
[1:50:28] this last age he has pushed outside the
[1:50:32] church can you say Amen Darkness crept
[1:50:35] in the first stage it used to be it
[1:50:37] would have been a whole whole as the
[1:50:40] prophet would call it an orbit an orbit
[1:50:43] Church full of
[1:50:44] truth but there was a little bit of
[1:50:47] darkness in it called the nickon and by
[1:50:50] the next stage more darkness seeped in
[1:50:52] and by the next stage more darkness
[1:50:54] seeped in until we're now till now it's
[1:50:57] it's
[1:50:59] it's we're so far away can you say
[1:51:03] Amen now we're living in an age where
[1:51:05] people just have a form of godliness but
[1:51:08] they don't have the life don't have an
[1:51:10] experience aren't hot for God aren't
[1:51:12] aren't on fire they're professing to be
[1:51:15] Christian professing to go to heaven
[1:51:17] doing religious things it used to be
[1:51:19] just wrong amen for Christians to smoke
[1:51:24] now they now they don't care they'll do
[1:51:26] it on a church parking
[1:51:30] lot used to be just Plum wrong to
[1:51:33] steal now they'll steal from the house
[1:51:36] of God they don't
[1:51:43] care doing religious things having a
[1:51:46] form of godliness Yet brother Brams
[1:51:48] would say it's in this last age that we
[1:51:50] find the blackout of the word the
[1:51:52] complete apostasy ending in the Great
[1:51:55] Tribulation see so so they've got the
[1:51:58] form but they denied the power of the
[1:52:00] word the Dynamics the
[1:52:02] token
[1:52:04] see and what causes the word to be
[1:52:06] blacked out the invasion of error and
[1:52:10] now the people sits in
[1:52:12] lukewarmness and brother Braham said
[1:52:14] what are they lukewarm to what lukewarm
[1:52:17] to what the
[1:52:18] word they're lukewarm to the word
[1:52:23] he said what what is wrong with these
[1:52:24] people of the last day they have gotten
[1:52:27] away from the word they are no longer
[1:52:28] fervent about it they are lukewarm about
[1:52:31] it can you say amen and they go into
[1:52:34] complete
[1:52:35] deception deception can you say Amen if
[1:52:38] the musicians will
[1:52:42] come
[1:52:43] lukewarm to where there's no rugged
[1:52:45] faith that brother Bram talked about
[1:52:48] people don't stand for anything anymore
[1:52:50] if they do stand it's off it's wacko
[1:52:55] stuff they'll stand for a Creed they'll
[1:52:57] stand for something that they don't like
[1:53:00] or the something like that but when it
[1:53:02] just comes to the balance of the word
[1:53:04] they can't
[1:53:06] stand they're Christian by name but lack
[1:53:09] conviction about the word wishy-washy
[1:53:11] goes with however the wind
[1:53:14] goes goes with what they're feeling at
[1:53:16] the time like you today hate you
[1:53:19] tomorrow just blending in with the world
[1:53:22] and don't see the need to live by the
[1:53:23] word they don't see the the need for
[1:53:28] Holiness you know it's
[1:53:31] true sisters blouses and I'm not talking
[1:53:33] about this church but sisters blouses
[1:53:35] are be getting lower and
[1:53:37] lower used to be a shame for Holiness
[1:53:40] people women to show their
[1:53:43] cleavage they don't think nothing of it
[1:53:45] anymore it's a
[1:53:50] shame used to be a shame to wear tight
[1:53:54] dresses
[1:53:55] tight hello short
[1:53:59] skirts used to be as shame now everybody
[1:54:03] wants to get ass short as they can
[1:54:05] without getting preached
[1:54:06] to then they get preached that they get
[1:54:10] mad used to be
[1:54:12] asham but see we're in a Le Osa
[1:54:16] age God help us to keep our
[1:54:19] convictions can you say Amen
[1:54:23] brother brandham said if you are true
[1:54:25] seed if you are truly baptized with the
[1:54:28] Holy Ghost you will esteem his word
[1:54:30] above your necessary meat and yearn to
[1:54:32] live by every word that proceeds out of
[1:54:35] the mouth of
[1:54:36] God you believe
[1:54:38] it
[1:54:40] Hallelujah I love the Lord amen I love
[1:54:43] the Lord we could go on appreciate your
[1:54:46] patience amen but oh help us to overcome

[1:55:00] and we are I I believe that I believe
[1:55:02] that's where that elect is brother brand
[1:55:05] of course we're living in Le otsy and
[1:55:06] age brother Bram is showing a difference
[1:55:09] that we're not part of that leodys and
[1:55:11] age he's he's showing us a
[1:55:14] contrast there are still a people that
[1:55:16] believes in Holiness and they're
[1:55:18] balanced with it there's still a people
[1:55:21] that believe in godliness and they're
[1:55:23] balanced with it there's a people that
[1:55:26] still believes in the nine spiritual
[1:55:27] gifts and they're balanced with it
[1:55:30] there's people that still believe in a
[1:55:32] Pentecostal experience and they're
[1:55:34] balanced with it it it's a bride that
[1:55:37] God is promised to pull
