[0:18] [Music]
[0:23] thank you
[0:32] foreign

[1:04] amen aren't you glad he's here to do
[1:06] that
[1:07] amen and we certainly
[1:09] a man wanting him to just pour it out
[1:12] just over and over and over
[1:14] amen and he certainly willing to do that
[1:17] and and I'm so glad that we can be a
[1:21] recipient
[1:23] of that a man the musicians can
[1:26] be dismissed it's good to see everyone
[1:30] now it's the Lord trust you I had a good
[1:32] week
[1:33] and a good day amen been a little warm
[1:37] but uh we're surviving praise the Lord
[1:40] and there's as hot as it is here it's uh
[1:45] other places very hot I still am
[1:48] downstairs you know in Oklahoma looking
[1:51] up the weather there it's in the triple
[1:53] digits 106 108 109 and they they
[1:58] probably got three weeks of this to look
[1:59] forward to
[2:01] and so it's been pretty pretty warm but
[2:04] the Lord is good to us and um
[2:08] if you have your Bibles we're going to
[2:10] turn to the Book of Psalms
[2:12] the 23rd chapter and it's good to just
[2:15] to have everyone that was gone over the
[2:17] weekend
[2:19] back in the house of the Lord and we
[2:21] want to just keep those that are sick in
[2:24] our prayer
[2:27] man
[2:30] that Psalms the 23rd chapter and before
[2:34] we go into the word may we just bow our
[2:36] heads and talk to the Lord
[2:39] precious father
[2:42] how we long just to feel your spirit and
[2:47] not just feel it Lord but to have you
[2:51] just to pour yourself into us
[2:54] more and more and more where we can be
[2:57] molded into your image and your likeness
[3:00] father
[3:01] for that's what you have predestinated
[3:03] us to Lord is to be conformed to the
[3:06] image of your dear son
[3:08] and father we know that the spirit makes
[3:11] that word live
[3:13] and it creates something with the in US
[3:15] Lord that the world could never create
[3:19] and oh God we need you more today than
[3:22] we ever have before
[3:24] and I pray father that you would just
[3:27] come
[3:28] move among your people
[3:30] anoint not only me Lord but nor the
[3:34] people father and may we just get
[3:37] ourselves out of the way father
[3:40] may your blood just cover us now Lord
[3:43] and speak to our hearts May Faith be
[3:47] quickened
[3:48] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[3:52] church says amen
[3:55] Psalms 23 and 1 says the Lord is my
[4:00] shepherd everybody say that the Lord is
[4:03] my shepherd
[4:05] I shall not want
[4:08] amen you can have your seats this
[4:11] evening
[4:13] of course I I want to continue along
[4:15] that thought the Lord
[4:17] is my shepherd
[4:19] and you know this this passage of
[4:22] scripture has been a comfort uh to many
[4:26] uh throughout the years and it's been
[4:29] used
[4:30] a lot in in
[4:33] funerals and and things like that and
[4:36] uh but I I think that the scripture has
[4:40] this scripture has been misunderstood
[4:43] many times I've been to funerals
[4:46] you know and and some of them as you
[4:50] hear what their lives were or you know
[4:53] what their lives were and and you study
[4:56] you know maybe their life uh that are in
[4:59] the casket and
[5:01] and you ask you know was the was the
[5:04] Lord really their Shepherd
[5:06] you know and and them type of funerals
[5:09] you just don't like to be at you know
[5:12] and uh but you know you you wander you
[5:16] know because
[5:17] this you know it appears
[5:21] today that people have a different idea
[5:25] or concept
[5:27] as to what a Shepherd is than what David
[5:30] understood as Shepherd to be
[5:33] and so David understood what it meant
[5:37] when he said the Lord is my shepherd
[5:41] and so
[5:43] um and and he gives a list of things
[5:46] that he wouldn't have experienced if the
[5:49] Lord wasn't his Shepherd
[5:52] for he says I shall not want. that's
[5:56] that's one of them I shall not want
[5:59] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[6:01] Pastures he
[6:03] leadeth me beside the Still Waters
[6:07] he restoreth my soul not they but he
[6:13] he leadeth me in the paths of
[6:15] righteousness for his name's sake
[6:18] and this is the shepherd
[6:22] that's that's leading and restoring and
[6:25] and and and and providing these benefits
[6:29] and so the scripture is more uh than
[6:33] just a comfort it's to be more than just
[6:36] a comfort to those who have lost a loved
[6:39] one
[6:40] these words that David
[6:43] writes there is more than just a cliche
[6:48] that we use
[6:51] but the Lord is a person
[6:54] and we know him to be Jesus Christ the
[6:57] same yesterday today and forever
[7:00] and he has taken on the role of a
[7:03] shepherd
[7:05] to his sheep ain't that right and so the
[7:08] benefits that David speaks of is
[7:11] something that every sheep of God
[7:14] experiences this isn't just an isolated
[7:17] experience that David has with the Lord
[7:21] but this is something that
[7:24] all sheep of God experience
[7:28] the benefits and no man can experience
[7:32] such benefits unless the Lord is his
[7:35] Shepherd
[7:37] only the Sheep of God
[7:41] have fear taken away from them by his
[7:46] presence
[7:47] because he is their Shepherd
[7:50] only his sheep are comforted by his rod
[7:55] and staff
[7:58] and there's no other rod in staff
[8:01] that can Comfort them
[8:03] there's nothing else that can comfort
[8:06] not God sheep
[8:08] but the shepherd's rod and staff
[8:11] they comfort me ain't that right
[8:14] so it shows the relationship that we
[8:18] have with our Lord
[8:20] he is the shepherd and we are his sheep
[8:24] you know sheep as the prophet tells us
[8:27] you know uh sheep
[8:29] they're they're not as wild animals that
[8:32] run all over the place but sheep
[8:34] actually are a an object of property
[8:39] and so
[8:41] um you know Jesus there he says my sheep
[8:46] know my voice
[8:47] my sheep
[8:49] showing that it's a personal possession
[8:52] of his
[8:53] sheep is his personal possession
[8:57] ain't that right
[8:59] and so he lays claim to them as being
[9:03] his own property
[9:04] sheep don't just follow anyone
[9:08] they're going to follow the shepherd
[9:10] ain't that right so as much as the
[9:13] shepherd lays claim to his sheep as
[9:16] being his so does the sheeply claim to
[9:19] the shepherd as being theirs
[9:22] the Lord is my shepherd ain't that right
[9:25] and David saw him not just as a Shepherd
[9:28] to the world
[9:29] leading multitudes
[9:32] but he's my shepherd he made it personal
[9:35] so it's a personal relationship that the
[9:39] Sheep the lamb has with or a Believer
[9:42] has with the Lord ain't that right
[9:45] David didn't have many Shepherds
[9:48] for he said the Lord is my shepherd
[9:51] ain't that right
[9:52] he only had one Shepherd so he was the
[9:55] Lord's property
[9:56] and the Lord was his Shepherd
[9:59] I think you know God's sheep are not
[10:01] running around here following anything
[10:04] that comes along
[10:06] friends come friends go
[10:10] but they're not the shepherd
[10:12] churches come and churches go
[10:15] but they're not the shepherd
[10:18] preachers come and preachers go
[10:20] but they're not the shepherd
[10:22] dad may come and dad make gold but he's
[10:25] not the shepherd
[10:27] children may come and children may go
[10:29] but they're not the shepherd
[10:31] seminaries will come and go but they're
[10:34] not the shepherd can you say Amen
[10:36] not my shepherd amen for the Lord is my
[10:41] shepherd and I I I I think it's the
[10:45] Sheep of God David is showing us that
[10:47] the Sheep of God know who they're
[10:50] following
[10:51] they're not just following blindly
[10:55] they're not just following anything that
[10:57] looks good but down inside there's a
[11:00] knowledge that the Lord is my shepherd
[11:02] and that's the one I will follow
[11:05] ain't that right
[11:07] another thing the shepherd leads his
[11:09] sheep to designated places to care for
[11:12] them
[11:13] and and the shepherd or the Sheep are
[11:16] attached to their to their Shepherd
[11:20] their confidence is in him their trust
[11:23] is in him their dependency is on him
[11:27] they have confidence in his ability to
[11:30] lead
[11:31] they have confidence in his ability to
[11:34] protect them they have this confidence
[11:36] in his ability to feed them they have
[11:39] this confidence in their Shepherd a man
[11:44] to provide for them can you say amen for
[11:48] sheep are totally dependent upon the
[11:51] shepherd
[11:52] now I know we've we've probably going
[11:54] over things that we've talked about but
[11:56] I'm just going to drive that that home
[11:59] and so just as a sheet knows its
[12:03] Shepherd David knew his Shepherd
[12:06] but also the shepherd knows his sheep
[12:09] have you ever just wondered if the Lord
[12:11] knew you or not
[12:15] you're claiming to know the Lord but
[12:17] does the Lord know you
[12:19] and it's a lot of times in the trials
[12:21] that we really wonder
[12:24] does he love me does he know me does he
[12:27] does he have any dealings with me
[12:31] but the shepherd knows his sheep
[12:34] and if it it it's it's I believe brother
[12:37] Branham even tells us that it is the the
[12:40] the duty of that Shepherd
[12:42] to know the sheep that he's leading
[12:45] ain't that right
[12:47] and and so if that is in the natural
[12:49] that it is also in the spiritual
[12:52] brother Brown says the shepherd stays
[12:54] with the Sheep so much until he even
[12:57] laughs like the Sheep bleeding
[12:59] he talks like the Sheep he smells like
[13:03] the Sheep that's right because he's with
[13:06] the Sheep that's all he knows is his
[13:10] sheep
[13:13] God's world if you could say it that way
[13:16] is you
[13:20] that's all he knows is you is sheep
[13:25] I think that's
[13:27] comforting
[13:30] Psalms 139 1 just starting there oh Lord
[13:34] thou have searched me remember this is
[13:36] the shepherd oh Lord the Lord is my
[13:39] shepherd thou has searched me and known
[13:42] me
[13:43] thou knowest my down sitting and mine
[13:46] Uprising thou understand is my thought
[13:49] of far off thou compasses my path and my
[13:52] lying down and art acquainted with all
[13:55] my ways
[13:57] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[13:59] Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together
[14:03] thou Hast beset me behind and before and
[14:06] laid thine hand upon me
[14:08] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[14:11] it is high I cannot attain unto it
[14:14] whether shall I go from thy Spirit or
[14:16] whether I shall flee uh from my presence
[14:19] if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there
[14:22] if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art
[14:25] there
[14:25] if I take the wings of the morning and
[14:28] dwell in the outermost parts of the sea
[14:31] even there shall thy hand lead me and
[14:33] thy right hand shall hold me if I say
[14:36] surely the darkness shall cover me even
[14:38] the night shall be light about me yea
[14:41] the darkness hideth not from thee but
[14:44] the night shineth as the day the
[14:46] darkness and the light are both a light
[14:48] to thee for thou has possessed my Reigns
[14:52] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[14:54] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[14:57] and wonderfully made marvelous are thy
[15:00] works and and that my soul knoweth right
[15:04] well
[15:05] my substance was not hid from thee when
[15:09] I was made in secret and curiously
[15:12] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[15:14] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[15:17] being informed unperfect
[15:20] and in my book all my members were
[15:22] written which in continuance were
[15:25] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[15:28] them
[15:29] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[15:32] me o God how great is the sum of them
[15:36] if if I should count them they are more
[15:39] in number than the sand when I awake I
[15:43] am still with thee
[15:46] he knows the Sheep
[15:49] so we we find that there's no Shepherd
[15:53] that could be more acquainted with the
[15:55] Sheep than the great shepherd with his
[15:57] sheep
[15:59] because his knowledge is an infinite
[16:02] knowledge
[16:04] that when you weren't even in existence
[16:06] he knew you it that when you weren't
[16:09] even thought of in an Earthly thought
[16:11] there was a Heavenly thought about you
[16:14] he knows you can you say Amen see he
[16:17] knows his Sheep by an infinite knowledge
[16:21] and wherever he leads his sheep it is
[16:25] already been prepared
[16:28] can you say Amen
[16:30] he prepared your natural birth he
[16:32] prepared the time that you would be born
[16:35] speaking of this natural he he's
[16:38] prepared everything about your life
[16:40] ain't that right he prepared the town
[16:43] that you would live in to think that God
[16:45] would create a town
[16:47] have a town established for you
[16:50] to live in
[16:52] hello
[16:54] I believe Bethlehem was was established
[16:57] for Christ to be born
[17:00] I believe the whole nature of Bethlehem
[17:02] and the characteristics of Bethlehem
[17:06] what was designed the way it was
[17:10] for Christ to be born in
[17:12] amen he prepared the family that you
[17:16] would belong to he prepared the genetics
[17:19] that you would belong to and that would
[17:21] be in you he prepared the age that you
[17:24] would live in can you say Amen
[17:27] so see the shepherd knows you
[17:30] and he's the one that is leading and
[17:32] guiding your footsteps he's the one
[17:35] that's prepared the new birth
[17:38] you believe that he prepared the time
[17:40] for you to have your new birth
[17:43] he prepared the prophet of Malachi 4 to
[17:47] give you a message
[17:48] he prepared your heart to receive that
[17:51] message
[17:51] everything of your life is him literally
[17:55] leading you up to something
[17:58] can you say amen and the way has already
[18:01] been prepared even though it would seem
[18:03] to be a time of death of Devastation a
[18:06] place of misery a place of whatever but
[18:09] yet God prepared it for you
[18:12] he's the shepherd
[18:14] so you're you're not just stumbling into
[18:17] this thing
[18:18] he's the shepherd can you say man
[18:21] and he's been leading you all alone
[18:24] from place to place in your life from
[18:26] event to event to event in your life
[18:29] from happening to happening
[18:33] and he gets you to the place that he can
[18:35] have total preeminence in your life
[18:39] amen
[18:42] now I've thought of this preparation in
[18:45] John 14 2.
[18:47] in my father's house this is Jesus
[18:49] speaking and of course he identifies
[18:52] himself as the great Shepherd
[18:54] so David was speaking of of of Christ
[18:59] and he says in my father's house are
[19:01] many mansions if it were not so I would
[19:03] have told you I go to prepare a place
[19:07] for you
[19:09] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[19:12] I will come again
[19:15] now like I said many things have been
[19:17] prepared in this life
[19:19] for you
[19:21] but to think of it that he prepares a
[19:24] place
[19:27] that is so far beyond the thoughts of
[19:30] humanity
[19:32] he prepares a place
[19:35] that the devil will have no influence
[19:37] whatsoever
[19:40] ain't that right
[19:42] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[19:45] listen I will come again
[19:48] this is the shepherd
[19:50] I will come again
[19:52] and receive you unto myself that where I
[19:55] am there you may be also
[19:58] listen what's the purpose of his coming
[20:01] again
[20:02] to receive us
[20:05] and lead us
[20:07] to the place that he's prepared
[20:11] that that that politics knows nothing
[20:14] about
[20:16] the greatest genius can ever get us
[20:18] there
[20:20] it would take the Lord Our Shepherd to
[20:22] lead us to the place that he's prepared
[20:26] ain't that right
[20:28] so then we find the meaning of this in
[20:30] John 14 and 18 I will come to you
[20:36] remember he said I'll not leave you
[20:38] comfortless I will come to you
[20:41] ain't that right
[20:44] come to you
[20:46] and yet a little while the world seeth
[20:48] me no more but you see me because I live
[20:50] you shall live also and at that day you
[20:53] shall know that I'm in the father my
[20:55] father you and me and I in you
[20:58] ain't that right
[21:00] now what is it
[21:03] in this day
[21:05] we realize that he's here
[21:08] you believe he's here
[21:10] brother random said he's here in the
[21:12] Dynamics he is the Dynamics
[21:15] ain't that right
[21:17] that brother Brown says my Ministry is a
[21:19] different Ministry it's different from
[21:21] Radio preachers his television preachers
[21:24] from any kind of preacher his ministry
[21:28] is different
[21:30] so so to think of this now you'll not
[21:32] get what you need in any other you you
[21:35] ain't going to get it in TD Jakes Benny
[21:37] him you ain't gonna get in some Baptist
[21:40] Doctrine Pentecostal Doctrine his
[21:42] ministry is totally different from
[21:44] anything else
[21:46] my Ministry is a different Ministry from
[21:48] a pastor or a teacher and if I say
[21:51] things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't
[21:53] mean it but this is my Ministry and
[21:56] that's to declare that he's here
[22:00] can you say Amen he's here
[22:03] amen so then we find that he's here
[22:08] to receive us
[22:11] and to lead us to the place he's
[22:13] prepared
[22:15] you believe it
[22:18] John 16 13.
[22:20] Jesus said how be it when he everybody
[22:22] say he
[22:25] the Lord
[22:27] Our Shepherd
[22:29] and now Jesus would reuse another
[22:30] terminology
[22:33] when he the spirit of Truth
[22:36] is come
[22:38] not not many he's
[22:41] there's not many many people or or
[22:44] whatever Gods when he the spirit of
[22:47] Truth has come he will guide you into
[22:49] all truth
[22:51] and brother Brandon said what this is is
[22:53] giving you all these Divine promises
[22:58] and you say Amen you you will not be
[23:00] able to get into the Divine promises
[23:03] until the shepherd which is the spirit
[23:07] of Truth come and lead you into it
[23:11] ain't that right
[23:13] these promises are true
[23:16] every other promise is just a mirage
[23:20] but the promises that God makes is true
[23:23] and it takes a Shepherd to lead us
[23:26] through them
[23:27] ain't that right
[23:29] giving you all these Divine promises he
[23:31] shall not speak of himself but
[23:34] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[23:37] speak
[23:38] and he will show you things to come
[23:42] ain't that right notice now he does not
[23:45] come to us in his physical body
[23:49] but he does come to us as the spirit of
[23:51] Truth
[23:53] how did he come to Jesus
[23:55] John said he saw the Holy Spirit descend
[23:58] upon him in the form of a dove
[24:02] ain't that right
[24:04] yes sir
[24:05] so the great Shepherd that David is
[24:09] speaking of is the spirit of Truth
[24:12] and he comes to us our Shepherd think of
[24:15] it he comes to us in the form of a dove
[24:20] that's why brother Brandon would preach
[24:22] them sermons The Lamb and the dove
[24:26] you ought to go listen to them
[24:29] he said the dove is the only bird there
[24:32] is that doesn't have a goal
[24:34] there's no bitterness about a dove
[24:37] that's why the dove had to return to the
[24:40] Ark in in Noah's day
[24:42] why because it could not eat off them
[24:45] dead carcasses
[24:47] you understand that
[24:49] brother Brown says if the dove is in you
[24:51] it will never lead you to the dead carry
[24:54] on things of the world
[24:56] it ain't gonna lead you to the dead
[24:58] formalities of church
[25:01] it ain't going to lead you to the dead
[25:02] seminaries and the dead religions and
[25:05] the dead philosophies of the world
[25:09] amen talking about our Shepherd
[25:12] the Lord is my shepherd
[25:15] see and so uh the dove just can't digest
[25:18] another thing to Dove is the meekest of
[25:21] all the birds that fly into heaven
[25:23] a lamb is the meekest of all animals
[25:25] that are upon the Earth
[25:27] the dove is the most gentle thing of the
[25:30] heavens
[25:31] the lamb is the most gentle thing there
[25:34] is on the Earth
[25:35] so God would make himself in the same
[25:38] like nature as us or make us in the same
[25:42] night like nature as him lamb and the
[25:45] dove
[25:46] a lamb ain't going or the dove ain't
[25:48] gonna lead a wolf it catch brother Brown
[25:51] said it won't even land upon a wolf
[25:54] it has to have a nature their nature a
[25:57] right kind of nature for it to come into
[25:59] or land on can you say man
[26:02] and the prophet said there's nothing
[26:04] like a dove the dove is a lover
[26:08] and it cools in the evening time
[26:13] you know I looked it up the word Dove
[26:15] according to Webster is the soft cry or
[26:17] the word coup means a soft cry
[26:21] when I read that it just come to mind
[26:23] you take it whatever you want to but I
[26:26] thought of Matthew and I don't think I
[26:28] gave you the scripture Judah but Matthew
[26:30] 25 and 6 and at midnight there was a cry
[26:36] made
[26:39] behold the bridegroom comes
[26:42] go ye out to meet him
[26:44] that cry
[26:47] is a cooing
[26:48] making love
[26:51] hello
[26:53] amen it's it's the Holy Spirit cooing to
[26:57] us
[26:58] making love can you say man
[27:01] and the prophet said when the Holy
[27:03] Spirit Coos through his word because you
[27:05] remember the prophet said the bridegroom
[27:07] coal will come out of this the message
[27:10] and he said when the Holy Spirit comes
[27:13] to us we could back
[27:16] and he cools through us through his word
[27:20] ain't that right and we could back in
[27:23] answer to him see so it's the holy
[27:25] spirit in us that Dove that has come
[27:28] into us that is answering back
[27:32] to the word
[27:35] his own word can you say Amen
[27:38] so hopefully we can see kind of the
[27:40] nature that our Shepherd has
[27:45] he's a leader
[27:47] but he can only lead a certain nature
[27:52] can you say Amen
[27:54] and that nature certain Nature has to be
[27:57] there in order to follow him
[28:00] ain't that right
[28:02] it landed Upon Jesus the lamb and Jesus
[28:05] was led
[28:07] by that dove
[28:10] now he will guide you into all truth
[28:14] do you realize this couldn't happen to
[28:16] this age
[28:18] there's only one way to know what is
[28:20] truth
[28:21] brother Brandon said that's by the Holy
[28:23] Spirit
[28:25] Ain't Gonna Know It by Seminary ain't
[28:27] gonna know about doctors of divinity
[28:29] you'll only know it by the Holy Spirit
[28:31] Our Shepherd
[28:33] ain't that right and the Holy Spirit is
[28:36] the prophet of the day
[28:39] and he will show you things to come
[28:42] Prophet said he will in other words be
[28:44] the revealer of the secret of the heart
[28:46] visions and so forth and he shall speak
[28:53] are Shepherds going to speak
[28:56] I think that's important
[28:58] as we talked about before because the
[29:01] Sheep know their Shepherd by his voice
[29:07] not by his physical stature so to speak
[29:09] but by his voice
[29:12] ain't that right
[29:14] so he's come
[29:16] to receive us unto him
[29:20] but he's got to speak
[29:23] and that voice is a cooing
[29:27] it's actually a making love
[29:31] ain't that right
[29:33] to receive us unto himself
[29:36] now you you know these scriptures we we
[29:38] read them all the time I guess
[29:40] Revelations 10 1 John tells of his
[29:44] dissension
[29:47] and he says he cried with a loud voice
[29:52] ain't that right
[29:54] Revelations 18 8 and I heard another
[29:57] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[30:00] my people
[30:02] what a cooing
[30:05] what of what what what a voice
[30:08] come out of her my people that you be
[30:10] not partakers of her sins and that you
[30:13] receive not of her pliques
[30:16] at the end of the laodicea and age Jesus
[30:18] cries out there in Revelation 3 20.
[30:21] behold I stand at the door and knock
[30:23] and if any man will hear my voice it's
[30:27] the only time in the ages that we hear
[30:30] Christ having a voice
[30:32] and he's speaking
[30:35] and you say man and it's not just any
[30:37] voice it's the voice of the bridegroom
[30:40] it's a bridegroom call
[30:43] you believe that
[30:45] see and so hear my voice and we know why
[30:48] he's speaking
[30:50] because his sheep know my voice my sheep
[30:52] know my voice
[30:54] and it's got to speak in order for us to
[30:57] follow
[30:59] in order for him to lead us to a place
[31:01] that he's prepared
[31:03] ain't that right
[31:06] and I'll open the door I will come unto
[31:08] him come into him and will sup with him
[31:11] and he with me
[31:13] Revelations 4 1 after this I looked and
[31:16] behold a door was opened in heaven
[31:19] and the first voice which I heard was as
[31:23] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[31:25] which said come up hither
[31:29] I will show you things to come
[31:33] I'm telling you no other voice can bring
[31:35] us up to that place
[31:38] and you say man
[31:40] and what is it brother Brown says and
[31:42] the voice sounds
[31:44] at the end of the church ages
[31:47] after the church Jesus are done finished
[31:50] then the voice speaks to John
[31:54] come up hither ain't that right brother
[31:56] Rand said see after the church Ages was
[31:59] over and everything was come ready made
[32:02] ready the setting of the fourth chapter
[32:04] here the church Ages was done he had
[32:07] done let the Earth remembered the voice
[32:08] that spoke to him behind him in the
[32:12] seven golden candlesticks the work was
[32:14] finished now that same voice was
[32:16] speaking up in heaven what was it he had
[32:19] done redeemed his people
[32:21] his Earthly work was finished and he's
[32:23] in glory calling to John come up hither
[32:27] ain't that right
[32:28] it's a Heavenly voice
[32:31] and after he says in another place after
[32:33] the church Ages were over we find then
[32:35] that John was a type of every True
[32:38] Believer that will be summoned by Christ
[32:40] on high
[32:42] every believer every sheep of God is
[32:45] going to be summons
[32:46] brother Brown said this is the bride
[32:49] going in the rapture
[32:52] hello it's true
[32:54] so it's the voice of the shepherd
[32:57] speaking in this day I believe this is
[33:00] just where we're at
[33:02] Amen in this hour
[33:05] if the Lord isn't your Shepherd you're
[33:07] not going in a rapture
[33:10] ain't that right
[33:12] you're going to miss it see so the
[33:14] Rapture is an event that only happens by
[33:17] the voice of the Lord
[33:20] ain't that right
[33:21] first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord
[33:25] himself shall descend from heaven this I
[33:28] I believe every scripture that we're
[33:30] reading here today it ties them together
[33:32] I will come again I will I've gone to
[33:35] prepare a place and I will come again
[33:37] then he says I will come to you and at
[33:40] that day you will know that I am with
[33:42] the father and the father in me or you
[33:44] and me and I and you and and all of
[33:47] these things and the Lord himself shall
[33:49] descend from heaven with the Shout with
[33:51] the voice of the Archangel with the
[33:53] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[33:57] shall rise first first
[33:59] can you say Amen there's something about
[34:02] the voice of the shepherd
[34:04] that it has the power to raise the Dead
[34:08] ain't that right brother Brown said it's
[34:11] the same voice that summoned Lazarus out
[34:13] of the grave
[34:14] look at him in an impossible situation
[34:16] four days dead the worms had already
[34:19] devour in his body but the voice of God
[34:22] spoke
[34:24] can you say amen and it doesn't matter
[34:27] where the believer is he could be ate up
[34:31] by sharks he could be ate up you know uh
[34:34] uh suck at the bottom of the old he
[34:36] could be you know caught up in a house
[34:38] fire and burned ashes he had blown up it
[34:41] does not matter when the voice of the
[34:43] Lord speaks the dead in Christ will rise
[34:47] first
[34:50] then we which are alive and remain shall
[34:53] be caught up together with them in the
[34:55] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[34:57] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[35:01] what is it he's come to lead us and to
[35:04] guide us
[35:06] his voice
[35:09] I thought also brother Branham in
[35:12] speaking of Israel coming out of Egypt
[35:14] said they had what first the word second
[35:17] the prophet third an angel to lead them
[35:20] to guide them
[35:22] and everyone agreed with the other the
[35:25] three of them the word agreed with the
[35:28] prophet and the prophet agreed with the
[35:30] word
[35:31] the angel agreed with all three of them
[35:34] or all of them
[35:35] the word the prophet and Angel and they
[35:37] were ready for the March
[35:40] hello
[35:41] that's how they come out of Egypt
[35:44] the word
[35:45] the prophet and an angel to go before
[35:49] them
[35:50] to lead them in the way
[35:52] what a Shepherd do we have
[35:56] he said oh blessed be the name of the
[35:58] Lord God we're at the end time
[36:01] the word the prophet and the angel all
[36:04] three of them together one great
[36:06] testimony God always said in the mouth
[36:09] of two or three witness let every word
[36:11] be established and a true Prophet will
[36:13] always agree with the word and any angel
[36:16] will testify of Truth we're ready for
[36:20] marching orders
[36:22] we're back to that day again
[36:25] we've had a prophet we've got the word
[36:28] and the angel of the Lord is here
[36:31] and they're all saying the same thing
[36:34] can you say Amen so what a day that
[36:36] we're living in
[36:38] oh that's so wonderful
[36:41] amen our our hopes
[36:44] should be alive tonight
[36:48] now David says the Lord is my shepherd
[36:52] I shall not want.
[36:55] one definition for the word one is
[36:58] Desiring to have
[37:04] I shall not want David says I shall not
[37:07] be dissatisfied
[37:10] I shall not be discontented
[37:15] you know some children are so spoiled
[37:17] that no matter what you give them
[37:19] they'll never be content
[37:24] right
[37:25] never content always wanting more but
[37:28] David said
[37:30] I shall not want.
[37:33] I like that word
[37:36] you see if you notice the shepherd's not
[37:39] an Aaron boy
[37:41] the Sheep telling the shepherd what they
[37:43] want and what they need and go do this
[37:45] and go do that
[37:48] that's that's not the relationship that
[37:50] sheep have with the shepherd
[37:53] the Sheep isn't telling him leading him
[37:59] but for knowledge
[38:02] the knowledge to know what the Sheep
[38:05] need lays in the shepherd
[38:08] you believe it
[38:09] the Sheep the shepherd knows the Sheep
[38:14] another definition for the word want is
[38:16] to lack
[38:18] to be without to have a need
[38:22] now they're they're you know
[38:26] well we'll go on so the Lord is my
[38:29] shepherd
[38:30] I shall not lack
[38:33] I shall not be without
[38:37] he's my shepherd
[38:39] what a comfort it is to know
[38:42] that you won't lack
[38:45] ah this is important for this day
[38:48] it's really important
[38:50] that we should not lack that we should
[38:53] not want
[38:55] when there is a lack in the human body
[38:57] it causes a person to act strange
[39:01] remember brother Brandon tell us about
[39:02] the boy
[39:03] that was eating the
[39:05] erasers off the pencils and
[39:08] eating a rubber off his bicycle pedals
[39:13] that's not normal
[39:16] his parents realized something wrong
[39:19] that boy
[39:20] to eat rubber
[39:23] so they take him to the doctor and
[39:25] they've done a lot of tests upon it on
[39:27] him
[39:27] trying to find out and they found a
[39:30] lacking
[39:33] and that was the lack of sulfur
[39:36] his body was craving sulfur and there
[39:39] was a lack for it
[39:40] and so he was he was doing strange
[39:43] acting strange
[39:48] you know the prophet also says that when
[39:50] people are hungry they'll eat from
[39:52] anywhere
[39:54] if children and people are starving
[39:56] they'll eat from a garbage can
[39:58] that once ate from a nice table
[40:01] but if they're hungry they'll eat
[40:04] anywheres
[40:05] ain't that right
[40:07] because there's a lacking
[40:09] and when there's a lacking it causes it
[40:13] causes people to just go crazy
[40:15] to do whatever they need to do to
[40:18] fulfill that lacking
[40:21] ain't that right
[40:22] see sheep have needs
[40:25] that must be taken care of
[40:29] but the thing is the shepherd is the
[40:31] only one that can take care of it
[40:34] ain't that right
[40:35] you got to have a shepherd
[40:38] now we we find brother Brown says now
[40:41] God gives the control tower to you
[40:44] I'm just thinking of this want now this
[40:47] this this this one this desire this
[40:49] crave this because of the lack
[40:52] God gives the control tower to you
[40:57] to give to you the things that you need
[41:01] and the control tower in you is what
[41:03] directs you
[41:06] like this thirst it runs in see this you
[41:10] know this control tower and tells you
[41:12] what you have need of spiritually
[41:14] speaking
[41:16] just like a man in the natural he's
[41:18] thirsty
[41:20] he's got to find water he's got to find
[41:22] something
[41:23] ain't that right
[41:25] I don't know about you but man I've been
[41:27] thirsty just so thirsty and drink pop
[41:31] after you drink it it's still you're
[41:34] thirsty still
[41:36] you drink Kool-Aid you're still thirsty
[41:40] you drink whatever you're still thirsty
[41:42] but really what you need is water
[41:45] to really satisfy
[41:48] that quenching
[41:50] now David found something that would
[41:52] satisfy
[41:54] verse said the Lord is my shepherd I
[41:56] shall not watch
[41:59] so so so whatever he was lacking the
[42:02] shepherd found it
[42:04] to meet the need right
[42:07] so now he says see it tells you what you
[42:10] have need see the control tower in the
[42:12] body and in the soul also there is a
[42:16] control tower in the body that tells you
[42:18] the need that's needed in your body and
[42:21] it's brought to you by thirst
[42:23] also there is a control tower in your
[42:26] soul
[42:27] that tells you the spiritual things that
[42:29] you have need of something in your
[42:31] spirit and you can and and and you buy
[42:35] this can tell what kind of life is
[42:38] controlling you
[42:42] by The Desires in your soul
[42:45] you can tell what nature is controlling
[42:47] you
[42:49] the wolf has no need of a shepherd
[42:53] but he's got a different life in him
[42:54] he's got a different nature
[42:57] can you say Amen the coyote doesn't have
[43:00] need of the shepherd but the sea and his
[43:03] desire is totally different than the
[43:05] Sheep
[43:10] now you find
[43:12] the need has to be met
[43:15] and there's something in you that's
[43:18] calling out
[43:20] no matter what life is in there
[43:22] it's calling out
[43:24] the need has to be met right
[43:27] now brother Brown says when you can see
[43:30] what your desires are
[43:33] then you can tell by that what kind of
[43:36] something that's in you that's creating
[43:39] this desire that you have
[43:42] see there is a certain thing that you
[43:44] thirst for
[43:45] and it can tell you in your soul what
[43:48] this desire is by the nature of The
[43:50] Thirst that you have
[43:53] so there is a control tower of the Soul
[43:55] one for the body and each Tower is a
[43:58] warning caller for the needs of the
[44:01] other each one calls you the need for
[44:04] the for what the caller is calling for
[44:06] and it sends out a wave of warning
[44:10] is that right I gotta have I gotta have
[44:13] water I'm thirsty I'm dying of thirst
[44:16] you know
[44:17] I gotta have something to eat
[44:20] dying of starvation
[44:23] there's something in there that's
[44:25] calling
[44:28] ain't that right
[44:30] so is it to every believer
[44:33] there's something that's calling
[44:38] God didn't send a prophet in vain
[44:42] he sent a prophet to meet that need
[44:46] so does he send preachers today still to
[44:48] meet that need
[44:50] right
[44:52] so he says now see for instance the
[44:55] flesh thirsts to satisfy the desire
[44:58] that's in the body
[45:01] and the spirit desires for the things
[45:03] that's in the soul
[45:05] see desire is many times and they wore
[45:09] one against the other
[45:11] we find what a great trouble is today
[45:13] that too many people try to live between
[45:16] those two desires
[45:18] one of them desires the things of the
[45:21] earth and the other desires the things
[45:23] of Heaven
[45:25] can you say Amen
[45:27] one desires the carnal things and the
[45:30] other desired spiritual things
[45:34] oh my
[45:37] God now the world is there to try to
[45:40] satisfy that flesh
[45:47] you got to find out what kind of
[45:49] Shepherd the Lord is
[45:54] he ain't gonna feed his sheep candy bars
[45:57] when they need grass
[46:01] he ain't going to feed his sheep Briars
[46:05] when they need healthy things he's not
[46:08] going to feed his sheep things that will
[46:10] hurt him
[46:12] and too many people desire and they're
[46:15] following that fleshly desire expecting
[46:18] the Lord to meet the need
[46:22] but the Lord isn't going to lead his
[46:24] sheep out that way he's a dove
[46:28] is this all right
[46:31] so we we find that if we have the Lord
[46:34] as our Shepherd we shall not want we
[46:38] shall not lack anything but notice it
[46:41] comes from the soul
[46:45] the desire is not from our flesh
[46:50] how can you desire in your flesh to
[46:52] serve God
[46:54] how can you desire in your flesh to to
[46:56] give up the world
[46:58] you you can't do that that has to come
[47:01] from something within
[47:04] can you say man and what you're Desiring
[47:07] what you're feeding off shows what kind
[47:10] of life is in you
[47:14] now notice the Lord is my shepherd
[47:17] so the need is going to be met then why
[47:19] why can't everybody be satisfied with
[47:21] the Lord being their Shepherd
[47:23] because they've got different desires
[47:25] than what his sheep would have
[47:29] ain't that right
[47:31] now notice Peter tells us that the Lord
[47:34] is the shepherd and Bishop of our soul
[47:38] our soul
[47:40] Psalms 107 9 he satisfied the longing
[47:44] soul and feel it the hungry soul with
[47:48] goodness
[47:51] ain't that right
[47:53] now brother Brian Murray talked about we
[47:55] we talked about even last Wednesday
[47:56] about the the the Sheep the lamb being a
[47:59] sacrificial lamb and how that we have to
[48:02] die out every day every day to desires
[48:04] of the flesh every day dying out to this
[48:06] world dying out to our own thoughts
[48:08] dying out to it all can you say Amen
[48:12] amen sheep's got to be fed right
[48:16] is that right
[48:19] and notice Psalms 34 2 the Lord shall
[48:23] preserve thee from all evil I didn't
[48:25] give you these scriptures either they
[48:27] came to me as as I was down there he
[48:30] shall preserve thy soul
[48:34] ain't that right
[48:36] so when David is saying I shall not want
[48:39] the desire from his soul
[48:43] remember he says one thing have I
[48:45] desired of the Lord that will I seek
[48:48] after
[48:49] and you say Amen
[48:51] but then he realized that the Lord is my
[48:54] shepherd
[48:55] and that desire is going to be met
[49:01] you say man
[49:03] Psalms 35 9 my soul shall be joyful in
[49:07] the Lord
[49:08] it shall rejoice in his salvation
[49:13] oh that's wonderful huh
[49:16] so now if there's a need it shows that
[49:19] there's something lacking something
[49:20] lacking what makes people get tattoos on
[49:23] them
[49:24] something's lacking
[49:26] what makes them be homosexuals and
[49:29] transgender something's something's
[49:31] lacking
[49:33] man what makes them to steal
[49:36] something's lacking
[49:38] murder it says you know there's
[49:41] something lacking in this world
[49:44] they have feasted
[49:46] they have feasted off the carry-ons of
[49:49] this world
[49:50] they have feasted off the carry-ons of
[49:53] religion
[49:54] they have feasted off the Creeds of man
[49:57] and traditions of man and they're still
[50:00] lacking
[50:03] can you say Amen the seminaries have not
[50:06] satisfied The Thirst that's in this
[50:08] world
[50:11] politics has not satisfied The Thirst
[50:14] that is lacking or this need that is
[50:16] lacking
[50:18] can you say Amen and when you're lacking
[50:21] you do things that you normally wouldn't
[50:23] do
[50:26] don't feed off them video games
[50:29] it will lead you to a place you don't
[50:32] want to go
[50:35] because anything you're feeding off
[50:38] you're going to show the results of it
[50:45] lift off candy bars all your life
[50:49] you're gonna show results
[50:50] honestly I have not
[50:54] that I used to drink Mountain Dew all
[50:56] the time
[50:59] that's what I'd say
[51:03] but what you feed off is going to show
[51:07] hello
[51:08] there's things that you can feed off
[51:10] that'll give you strings
[51:13] and there's other things you can feed
[51:14] off and you can feed and feed and feed
[51:16] and be not Mount malnutrition
[51:21] and you say man
[51:23] now the the the the flesh
[51:28] the world is is trying to satisfy the
[51:31] flesh
[51:33] that ain't meeting the need for the soul
[51:38] can you say Amen
[51:40] it's the soul that needs to live
[51:43] it's the soul that needs to be restored
[51:47] it's the soul that needs to be quickened
[51:52] and you say Amen
[51:54] you you can be
[51:56] materialistic hungry
[51:58] and have all the money in the world and
[52:01] is still locking something in your soul
[52:06] but David says the Lord is my shepherd I
[52:10] shall not want
[52:16] I mean people said in churches and
[52:18] they're not satisfied
[52:20] because the Lord ain't their Shepherd
[52:23] they'll go to a basketball game and
[52:26] they'll shout and they'll scream and
[52:28] only to be dissatisfied
[52:31] even if their team is winning and even
[52:33] if they go to the Nationals
[52:37] because the soul is not satisfied only
[52:40] the shepherd can satisfy the soul
[52:49] what makes young people been raised in
[52:51] church want to be like the world
[52:54] it shows there's a need
[52:56] hello
[52:58] shows there's a need
[53:03] because they're trying to serve the Lord
[53:04] by their flesh
[53:06] you ain't going to get any peace
[53:11] I live it like the world
[53:13] girls you can go cut your hair you'll be
[53:15] so dissatisfied
[53:17] you don't put on the britches like them
[53:19] other women but you're going to be
[53:20] dissatisfied
[53:22] you can put tattoos all over your face
[53:24] and you'll still be dissatisfied
[53:27] because it has nothing to satisfy the
[53:31] soul
[53:34] ain't that right
[53:38] now notice brother Brown says
[53:40] just going to read here different places
[53:43] the church lacks the warning of making
[53:45] ready
[53:47] that's a need in the church
[53:49] the church lacks wisdom
[53:53] that's a need in the church now I want
[53:55] you to understand
[53:56] there's a difference in nominal Church
[53:59] in
[54:00] in Bride
[54:03] hello
[54:05] the church lacks a burning Everlasting
[54:08] faith
[54:11] you know the Bible says that uh I I
[54:13] don't know if it was Peter or Paul but
[54:17] said they'd have a form of godliness
[54:19] speaking of the people of this day that
[54:22] they'd have a form of godliness and deny
[54:24] the power thereof
[54:26] and brother Brown says what it would be
[54:28] it's not the lack of power that we have
[54:31] it's the lack of faith that we have
[54:35] they deny the power the power is there
[54:38] but they ain't got the faith enough to
[54:40] tap into that power and use that power
[54:45] turn to doctors they'll turn to
[54:47] psychologists they'll turn to
[54:49] psychiatrists and turn to everything
[54:51] else
[54:56] so brother Brown says they lack the
[54:58] faith to operate the power
[55:01] amen
[55:02] he says he is here right now right at
[55:07] this minute he is here
[55:09] and the only thing it lacks is for your
[55:14] faith to pick up that word and anoint it
[55:17] to yourself and he will heal you
[55:21] so it isn't that he wasn't there in that
[55:23] meeting it's not that he's not here
[55:25] tonight it's the lack of faith that
[55:28] people have to take that word and anoint
[55:32] it to themselves so that God could heal
[55:35] them
[55:37] he said I want you to get built up now
[55:39] all this holy Oracles of God in the
[55:41] faith and notice what he says the faith
[55:43] of this hour
[55:45] everybody say the faith of this hour
[55:49] now see the shepherd knows what we have
[55:51] need of for this hour
[55:53] he knows what we have need of
[55:56] oh if we can understand see the faith of
[55:59] this hour it's going to take more faith
[56:02] than ever was in any age for this has to
[56:06] be a rapturing faith to be taken up
[56:09] so there's a need in the church
[56:13] brother Brandon speaking to the
[56:14] Pentecostal church that had all the
[56:16] gifts speaking in tongues roll it on the
[56:18] floor all the sensations all of them
[56:21] things and after Azusa Street and now
[56:25] he's telling them there's a lacking in
[56:27] the church
[56:30] we've got to have faith
[56:32] more faith than ever but the shepherd
[56:37] knows his sheep
[56:40] and knows how to provide
[56:43] another thing and I'm going to close
[56:47] in a moment
[56:49] but another thing the church is lacking
[56:51] is love
[56:54] that's what he said
[56:56] not filial love
[56:59] that most people run on
[57:02] thinking it's divine love
[57:07] bitty said we need Divine love that's
[57:09] what's lacking
[57:11] and as we said before Divine love causes
[57:13] you to do the will of God first and
[57:16] foremost
[57:19] but notice what he says now he says thus
[57:22] saith the Lord it'll take perfect love
[57:25] to put you in that place
[57:28] for that's all there was there
[57:31] remember what place the place he's
[57:34] prepared
[57:37] amen
[57:42] and it's going to take perfect love to
[57:44] put you there
[57:46] no matter how many how much religious
[57:48] demonstrations how many Good Deeds
[57:51] you've done or whatever you've done that
[57:53] won't count nothing on that day it'll
[57:55] take perfect love
[57:58] so whatever you do you lay aside
[58:00] everything else until you're just so
[58:03] filled with the love of God till you can
[58:05] love those who hate you
[58:10] you say man
[58:13] now notice
[58:17] I believe it was the angel of the Lord
[58:19] speaking to brother Branham or baby
[58:21] brother Branham just telling of his his
[58:23] experience of going beyond the curtain
[58:25] of time
[58:27] that he says this press on
[58:30] everybody say Press On
[58:33] press on in that perfect love
[58:37] which will take you to that beautiful
[58:40] place joyful place beyond the curtain of
[58:44] time
[58:45] so you see the lacking you see the the
[58:49] things that you know and and and you
[58:52] could uh uh there was just a great
[58:54] lacking in the church
[58:56] but Philippians uh I believe 419 Paul
[59:00] would tell us but my God everybody say
[59:03] my God the same same God that David said
[59:07] the Lord is my shepherd Paul is saying
[59:11] my God shall supply all your needs
[59:14] according to his riches in Glory by
[59:18] Christ Jesus
[59:25] now brother Rams would say
[59:27] we've got to have rapturing faith in a
[59:29] church
[59:30] that can be changed in a moment in a
[59:33] twinkling of an eye to go out or will
[59:35] not go
[59:38] but notice he doesn't stop there but he
[59:40] says but don't worry
[59:42] it'll be there
[59:45] why
[59:47] the Lord is my shepherd
[59:52] he said I believe that the Ages come now
[59:57] the miraculous
[1:00:00] the phenomenal the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:03] Spirit and power and signs and wonders
[1:00:06] this great pouring out of God's spirit
[1:00:08] in the last days
[1:00:11] that's the thing that'll bring Faith
[1:00:13] into the people that'll take a rapturing
[1:00:16] faith that'll take the church and the
[1:00:18] glory
[1:00:21] he promised to meet the need and he came
[1:00:24] himself
[1:00:26] in power in the phenomenal in the
[1:00:29] Supernatural to give Faith to this bride
[1:00:36] one place brother Bram says God intended
[1:00:39] this church to be a powerful Church a
[1:00:42] glorious Church
[1:00:43] so you see the need right
[1:00:47] he intended this church
[1:00:49] and people want to go back to the the
[1:00:52] Azusa Street
[1:00:54] that wasn't what God intended
[1:00:56] now that that's part of it that was a
[1:00:59] place prepared for that time
[1:01:03] but there's another place prepared
[1:01:07] can you say man that'll have no more
[1:01:10] trouble that'll have no more trial
[1:01:11] that'll be no more Sorrows than crying
[1:01:14] and and and and crying over lost loved
[1:01:17] ones and and and and and the ones that
[1:01:19] have gone on there'll be no more of that
[1:01:23] no more enemy to deal with
[1:01:27] can you say Amen
[1:01:29] and he's intended for this church to be
[1:01:31] a powerful Church a glorious Church a
[1:01:35] church that the whole world could look
[1:01:36] upon as the bride of Christ
[1:01:40] think of that now that's a need
[1:01:43] not look upon this church as a
[1:01:45] Pentecostal Church as a Baptist Church
[1:01:47] as as a Methodist Church but as what she
[1:01:50] is the bride of Christ
[1:01:54] well expected and espoused to live in
[1:01:59] such an atmosphere in conduct in itself
[1:02:02] uh conduct itself in such a way that God
[1:02:05] would be proud of this church to present
[1:02:08] it to Christ at the coming of the Lord
[1:02:12] black
[1:02:13] the need
[1:02:15] but he promised it'll be there
[1:02:18] he's here
[1:02:20] he's here he's come to us
[1:02:22] to lead us
[1:02:25] oh this okay
[1:02:28] now the prophet said God uh uh well I
[1:02:31] just read that but Psalms 34 9 oh fear
[1:02:34] the lord ye his Saints
[1:02:37] for there is no want everybody say there
[1:02:40] is no want
[1:02:42] to them that fear Him
[1:02:45] and that word fears respect him
[1:02:48] reverence him
[1:02:50] can you say Amen
[1:02:52] and believe me only his sheep will
[1:02:54] reverence him and fear Him
[1:02:56] for he's their Shepherd
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:02] there is no want to them that fear Him
[1:03:04] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[1:03:07] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[1:03:10] not want or lack any good thing
[1:03:16] what a contrast to this laodicean church
[1:03:21] Revelations 3 and 15 I Know Thy works
[1:03:25] the Thou Art neither cold nor hot
[1:03:28] I would that that word cold or hot
[1:03:31] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:03:33] either cold or hot I will spew thee out
[1:03:35] of my mouth
[1:03:37] because thou sayest
[1:03:40] I am rich increase with goods and have
[1:03:42] need of nothing and know it's not that
[1:03:44] thou art wretched miserable poor blind
[1:03:47] and naked
[1:03:49] so they're saying they have everything
[1:03:52] they ain't got nothing no need of
[1:03:54] nothing and yet the prophet or Christ is
[1:03:58] telling them you have need of everything
[1:04:03] and you say man
[1:04:04] but what is it what they desire see they
[1:04:07] had what they desired
[1:04:10] that they still act
[1:04:13] right
[1:04:15] they chose Creeds but they're still
[1:04:17] lacking
[1:04:19] they chose traditions of man but they're
[1:04:21] still lacking
[1:04:24] they chose just to be religious but
[1:04:26] they're still lacking
[1:04:28] and God knows that they're lacking
[1:04:30] right
[1:04:32] Isaiah 4 1 in that day seven women shall
[1:04:35] take a hold of one man saying we will
[1:04:37] eat our own bread and we're on apparel
[1:04:40] but only let us be called by thy name to
[1:04:42] take away our reproach
[1:04:44] now you know brother bran tied this to
[1:04:46] this day
[1:04:47] as an adulterous day
[1:04:50] adultery both spiritual and natural
[1:04:53] now notice the Bible said that the
[1:04:56] people of this day will be led by their
[1:04:59] own lusts
[1:05:02] ain't that right they want to take the
[1:05:04] name of God they want to bear his name
[1:05:07] but they want to be led by their own
[1:05:09] lust we'll lead our own bread
[1:05:11] we we we will eat what we think is best
[1:05:14] for us
[1:05:16] but the Sheep
[1:05:19] relies upon the shepherd
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:25] and as Peter said even denying the Lord
[1:05:28] that bought them
[1:05:32] they deny him the right to rule over
[1:05:34] them they Delight him the right to lead
[1:05:36] them and to guide them they they deny
[1:05:39] him the rights to care for them
[1:05:44] and you say Amen
[1:05:46] I want you to notice Deuteronomy 28 47.
[1:05:51] because thou service not the Lord thy
[1:05:54] God with joyfulness
[1:05:56] see we've got to serve the Lord in the
[1:05:58] right way
[1:06:01] because thou service the Lord not the
[1:06:05] Lord thy God with joyfulness and
[1:06:06] gladness of heart for the abundance of
[1:06:09] all things
[1:06:11] therefore shall thy shalt thou serve
[1:06:15] thine enemies which the Lord shall send
[1:06:17] against thee in hunger
[1:06:20] in thirst
[1:06:21] in nakedness and in want of all things
[1:06:27] and he shall put a yoke of iron upon my
[1:06:30] neck until he have destroyed thee
[1:06:34] now look where we're at look at the
[1:06:36] church world today look look at it all
[1:06:39] God sent them what they had need of
[1:06:42] spiritually
[1:06:45] but they did not did not Delight in that
[1:06:47] abundance
[1:06:49] they they did not Delight in the
[1:06:52] abundance of his care for them
[1:06:54] they did not Delight in his the
[1:06:57] abundance of his provisions
[1:07:01] and you say man
[1:07:04] and they put him outside the church and
[1:07:06] he's knocking trying to get into the age
[1:07:07] again
[1:07:10] hello
[1:07:12] and so this is where the nominal Church
[1:07:15] stands today
[1:07:18] you did not Delight in the Lord you
[1:07:21] certain not the Lord thy God with
[1:07:23] joyfulness and gladness of heart for the
[1:07:26] abundance of all things
[1:07:31] he come with his abundance but they
[1:07:33] didn't want it
[1:07:36] they wanted to take his name but eat of
[1:07:39] their own bread
[1:07:40] of their own provisions
[1:07:42] so then served the Lord and they're
[1:07:44] doing it today
[1:07:46] They don't serve the Lord with gladness
[1:07:48] for what he's done for them
[1:07:50] oh they serve the Lord they worshiping
[1:07:53] the Lord thinking their Worship in the
[1:07:54] Lord anyways singing and dancing but all
[1:07:57] the while look what we've done
[1:07:59] oh we made a name for ourselves
[1:08:02] we're Baptists look at our organization
[1:08:04] look what we're doing we're Pentecostals
[1:08:07] and they're not rejoicing and serving
[1:08:11] the lord with gladness for the abundance
[1:08:14] he's provided
[1:08:17] can you say man
[1:08:19] therefore they're going to serve their
[1:08:21] enemy
[1:08:22] which the Lord sins against them in
[1:08:24] hunger thirst nakedness and in want
[1:08:27] of all things
[1:08:30] Peter tells us to add to our faith
[1:08:33] virtue knowledge Temperance godliness
[1:08:35] patience brotherly kindness and charity
[1:08:38] Divine love right
[1:08:41] we got to add these things
[1:08:43] second Peter 2 or 1 and 8 and if these
[1:08:47] things be in you and abound
[1:08:49] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:08:51] Barren nor and fruitful in the knowledge
[1:08:53] of our Lord Jesus Christ you shall not
[1:08:55] lack
[1:08:56] right but he that lacketh these things
[1:08:59] is blind and cannot see it far off and
[1:09:02] hath forgotten that he was purged from
[1:09:05] his old sins
[1:09:06] but notice what the prophet would say
[1:09:10] the confidence of the believer
[1:09:15] that he has in his maker that he
[1:09:17] promised to meet the need
[1:09:22] you love the Lord
[1:09:25] if the musicians will come
[1:09:28] and brother Brandon would say the voice
[1:09:31] of God today
[1:09:34] is here to meet the need of the hour
[1:09:41] the voice of God
[1:09:44] today is meeting the need of the hour
[1:09:51] and we're finding that our desire is not
[1:09:54] for fame and fortune
[1:09:57] our desire is not for wealth and power
[1:10:02] we're not craving position in this life
[1:10:06] that's not the need that the church has
[1:10:11] that we're finding
[1:10:13] the shepherd
[1:10:16] has spoken in this age
[1:10:18] and he's meeting the needs
[1:10:21] can you say Amen
[1:10:23] don't worry it'll be there
[1:10:26] I love the Lord do you love the Lord
[1:10:30] the Lord is my shepherd
[1:10:33] see it was his voice that
[1:10:35] when the world Earth
[1:10:38] was without form it was void and
[1:10:40] darkness covered the Earth
[1:10:43] it was his voice
[1:10:45] and said let there be
[1:10:48] and there was
[1:10:52] that's the that's the shepherd Shepherd
[1:10:53] that David's talking about
[1:10:55] he's my creator
[1:10:58] it's the same Lord that met with Abraham
[1:11:03] that would take as the prophet say take
[1:11:05] a spoonful of dust just to dust
[1:11:08] and create a body
[1:11:11] and live in it and walk to Abraham
[1:11:13] and talk to him face to face
[1:11:17] and then telling
[1:11:19] this time according to life you shall
[1:11:21] have
[1:11:22] the time of life you shall have a son
[1:11:25] ain't that right
[1:11:28] That Glory that God
[1:11:30] that would discern Sarah's heart her
