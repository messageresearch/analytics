life is not out of control for it's in his hands am and um good morning to you all and good to uh just see everyone musicians can be dismissed and um um those that have been sick and are in the house of the Lord we're certainly glad to have you back and uh just just everyone and uh appreciated the songs the worship that has gone forth and um amen and uh um want to say I appreciate the brothers for putting these changing out the lights amen and um they're um [Applause] and working in the back and and so we're going to put some more Lighting in here uh we just run out and uh so we've ordered some more and and make it a little bright I like a bright place not a dull place and so um uh so so it'll be a little brighter as we go and that way we can see your faces and and uh you so uh but also uh just going to let you know we are going to be uh doing a lot of um as time goes we're going to be remodeling this place and uh we want to change the carpets uh going to take out these pews eventually change them and replace the chairs put chairs in and uh so it's going to be a lot of remodeling uh as we get the money and so um we uh wanting to do that do an upgrade and so uh but I do want to say that if anyone is interested in it and would like to donate uh for that cause uh you're certainly welcome to and um if you do uh make sure you designate that money I mean let us know that that's what that money is for so brother Tim will be able to uh put it in the right account and uh so anyways um we um um you know the Lord has blessed us with this building uh we're not paying any rent on it and uh to be honest I have looked for other buildings and um to move to but we it ain't happening and um I have not wanted to uh remodel this because if we ever sold it we we not or we can't sell it if we ever decided to move we couldn't sell it so I really didn't want to put money into it but um as of this point this is where the Lord wants us to be I guess and uh so we're going to change things around here and make it a little bit uh uh better so um um so we're looking forward to that amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to first of all the Book of Matthew the 17th chapter and um just uh a card here note says thank you for your prayers may God richly bless you and says perhaps you spoke the kindest words as any friend could say perhaps you were not there at all just thought of us that day whatever you did to console our hearts we thank you so much whatever the part uh that's from the family of Alfred uh tickle uh brother of sister Jane and um so we we certainly uh even though I didn't get to meet him uh sister James told me about him and uh he he just seemed to be a just a fine man and and um a wonderful husband uh to his his wife and and uh so I'm I'm sure he would uh be greatly missed uh seemed like he lived a full life amen and traveled the world right him and his wife traveled the world and and uh done a lot of things together and but we want to uh just remember Sister Jane in our prayer and the family and that's no matter who it would be it's it's definitely not easy to lose a loved one and uh so uh and I want to say we really appreciate sister Jane love her dearly and um um so she's been a great inspiration to us here at the church but um uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father truly it is good to be in your house this morning with your people that you have redeemed Lord we just I feel so inadequate to stand before them this morning and but Lord we're just asking that you would um anoint me Father we need you Lord and not just me but anoint your people father and we have felt your spirit here already Lord as the people would press in to worship and to magnify you Lord and I know that must be pleasing to you father for the Bible says Lord that you inhabit the Praises of your people and father as the atmosphere is created Lord I I just ask that you would now feel at home to do a supernatural work in all of our Lives father and bless what little words we would have to say and father give us more revelation of you father not just knowledge but let it be a great understanding for you promised it would be in this day that we would have understanding of your word of who we are of where we're going of our position father in you we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen The Book of Matthew the 17th chapter and we're going to just read the U first five verses but it says and after Jesus or after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was as as was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with them then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou will let us make uh here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for Elias and while he spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him amen then if you'll go to the book of Ephesians we have read this several times now but the book of Ephesians the 4th chapter amen Ephesians uh chapter 4 and verse one we'll start there I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all loneliness and meekness and with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace there is one body and one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling then if you'll go with me to Revelations the 10th chapter Revelations chapter 10 and while you're turning just want to say you know um I guess next Sunday will be Christmas Eve and so we will be having service uh Sunday morning uh there uh and we we'll dismiss be dismissing the evening service so just remember that um uh Sunday morning we will have service regular time and uh um brother Andrew is going to be in town so I've asked him to uh take that service and so we're looking forward to what God has uh for us then praise the Lord uh Revelations the 10th chapter and I want to read the start at the eth verse and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said to me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and Kings amen you can have your seats this morning and I pray the Lord just helps us here today but we read in in Matthew there where God is is adopting his son the Lord uh Christ and he says hear me no longer but hear ye him and this is um as I was just listening to brother brandom early this morning and and that just rung out to me God saying hear me no longer but hear you him now we are standing standing we are standing in that same place today uh as the body of Christ The Bride for we are living in the time of the manifestation of the sons of God um no other time has it been uh for the sons of God to be manifested outside of this time amen this is the time right even as good as Pentecost was on the day of Pentecost this was that was not from what I see what brother brandham taught it was not the the the adoption time this is the time of adoption and this this manifestation of sons happens at the same time at the lid of hell has been lifted off and and demons are pouring in like like never before and and so this this manifestation did not happen in the Pentecostal age um uh it it is it is today and we must we must let that really sink into us because if you realize this is the hardest age ever this is the most deceptive age ever this is the most evil age ever to ever be and it'll be at this time that only those that are sons of God will overcome this age it'll be the only time uh the the the only ones that'll overcome so what is this manifestation what what is all this about you know brother brandom in in in one place in actually one in a million he says he is supposed to according to scriptures return to Us in this last days in this type of ministry after uh that will be after the baptism of the spirit speaking in tongues Divine Healing and so forth these things the capping of the Pentecostal message is what we're speaking of today see this ministry of the Christ himself impersonated among his people with the very same things that he did when he was here on Earth in his body the bride which is part of him doing the same things everybody say the same things as husband and wife or King and Queen just before the marriage ceremony hallelujah what a time what a day we're living in and and what a privilege and honor to be part of this now as sons of God as men members of the body of of Christ then we are part of the ministry we have a Ministry you see we are the agents that God uses here on Earth we are the hands feet lips mouth eyes we we if God's going to have a body it is us it is us and and so like it's you know in the natural if if our car breaks down on the highway you know there there's you know we we we will call we will wait for a tow truck to come and take it to the mechanic and then we wait for that mechanic to to fix the problem if our septic goes bad you know we call someone like brother Tim uh to to send one of his guys out there to take care of the problem if if we have a loved one that needs you know special uh care uh you know uh caretaker whatever then we we call someone like you know uh Sister Kim weeks or sister Hannah bate and uh someone like that to help us uh uh you know there there there are agencies that we can we can uh call for help to to get things done ain't that right well but but we're we're greater than these things we're we're because we are members of the body of Christ so if God is going to get anything thing done on the Earth today then he calls upon his body the members of his own body Amen to help help you know to to that he himself can do the job do you believe that so then um Mark 16:17 Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils a higher Ministry you know they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover John 14:12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than thee shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask and he's talking to his body not just everybody whatsoever you shall ask ask in my name that will I do it amen this is a son daughter of God that's coming to adoption see they they they uh uh that the father may be glorified in the son ain't that right it's not for our Glory it's not for our our uh everybody to look at me and see what kind of guy I am and and all these things see and if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it see God ain't going to send his members and commission you on on his on on something and then he don't back you up but just as Moses needed that Red Sea to be parted and and he started crying about it and God rebuked him and said why are you crying to me I've commissioned you to go forward now you speak amen and and and so we're we're standing in that same place here this morning I I believe that so so then uh um to to to to go further into the type of ministry that we have as the body of Christ I I hope that we can do that today amen uh because there is no Ministry amen outside the body of Christ that compares to the ministry in the body of Christ there there is no Ministry and I I cannot stress enough of importance of of what you are and the position you hold and the role you play in in the body of of Jesus Christ um God has set each member in the body as it has pleased him do you believe that amen as he it has pleased him so so God's body is important and and he takes very he takes very uh interest in you personal interest in you that if he called you if he ordained you he saved you he baptized you into that body now he is going to personally place you in that body position you in that body cuz he's got a specific work for you and this body must run together every that's why brother brandom said it in several places nobody can take your place I don't care how small you are and how insignificant you feel and and yada yada and all no one can take your place and no wonder the devil wants to tell us that we're insignificant that we don't matter I listening to brother Bri today and and he says you know he says even the devil had me uh you know trying to tell me that God doesn't love me and that that God doesn't care for me and I thought my Lord a a man that that that was in the presence of an Angel constantly and and and all these things and yet the devil was trying to even tell him so you could imagine we fight the same battles amen but you are important amen the the same angel that would talk to brother Brandon would tell him that how just important we are as the body of Christ amen you believe that and so so God would set each of us as members of his body as it has pleased him see and so then then we've read it but brother Brown said see he endows them the members of that body he endows them with their Ministry and he puts the gifts at her disposal amen see so uh now to me the the following quote uh uh is what makes the ministry within the bride different uh from the rest of the ministry uh uh outside the body of Christ and it makes it more powerful and and more effective than any other notice what brother Bram said those in the bride was so every member of the body do only everybody say do only this is very important now do only his will see no one everybody say no one can make them do otherwise see the this is now we're talking of adoption of sons now see they've come to maturity they've come to a place that they're not the foolish son they're not that foolish Guy where God can't put adoption can't place an adoption he just squanders he just does whatever God gives him this a certain Ministry God gives him a a certain talent and he just squanders it you know amen but those in the bride do only his will and no one can make make them do otherwise ain't that right you know uh uh uh I'm I'm going to to put it uh uh um uh brother brother Ray Erikson uh he he was talking about um um Corinthians the 13th chapter when that which is perfect has come that which is uh in part will do be done away with and and I I'll be honest uh I've not really understood that uh part of that scripture of course I've I've heard a lot of people uh use that as well the gifts are done with and all that because now that which is perfect is come uh and i' never believ that because brother Bram never said that and so but I uh what what Brother Ray uh he made the statement he said see when that which is perfect he said we have put up with a lot of false prophecies a lot of false dreams a lot of false things that was said in the name of the Lord and and yada yada yada uh and we've had some you know that was good some that was right some that was corrective but but a lot of it was saying things that God never even said you know and and these things he said but when that which is perfect is come then all of that which is in part and other words all that that is false will be done away with and I thought man that is so powerful that makes sense in other words you're not taking you're not taking gifts out of the church cuz brother Brown never did that but now reason why we don't have a lot of these things in the church like we used to in Pentecost is because a lot of that was false but here come that which is perfect now there's a mature bride that is not just saying thus sayith the Lord off of impression that is not accepting just every dream that they have amen they're they're not going by in Sensations and said oh this is of the Lord I man I would deal with a lot of that back in the day you know a Pentecost uh this old precious dear old woman you know uh uh God led her everywhere I'm just tell everywhere she she had make God's led me here you know tell my dad you know God's led me here to this church bless the Lord and and so LED yeah well praise the Lord you know month later she's gone you know and and then she'd come back 5 months later you know and dad said well sister were you well God led me over here you know God was leading her a lot you know places and and then you also hear these things of of well the Lord told me this and the Lord told me that I hear ministers all the time the Lord told me this and well the Lord told me this the other day and you're just sitting there and you're thinking man Lord Lord sure don't talk to me like that you know and and and and then you find out they're living a lie they they living a sin they're living in all corruption and and you know but the Lord's still talking you know and and it it just you know but that when that which is perfect is come then then all the the the nonsense will be done away with all all of the Impressions will be done away with all these Sensations will be there is a true dance there is a true tongue there is a true prophecy there is a true emotion there is a true spirit amen that is working among the bride but they only his will and nothing no one will ever convince them to do otherwise now this is where e failed in the beginning ain't that right see now notice what brother Brown said he continues they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still let someone rise with a dream and they'll judge that thing before they go after it you know let someone come rise up with the prophecy and they'll judge that according to the word of God because thereafter thus sayi the lord they're not after your impression they're not after amen your friendship they're not after well bless God you know you meant well no no it's time for judgment amen can you say amen and so they have this sayith the Lord or they keep still they know they know it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own work see God in his bride in this age able to fulfill his own word see so God in every member of the body the bride fulfilling he goes on he says see he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride now he works what's he going to do he's going to fulfill his ministry in you he's going to feel it do you believe that yes sir see he works in and through the bride she knows that I think that's important amen she knows that she's not just sitting here going to a mess of church just wonder what do I do I don't know I I just don't know if I'm going to make it no she knows that God is in her fulfilling fulfilling his own word through her see she knows that see for it was not time for him to do certain things see that he must do now so she knows it wasn't time for him to do certain things that he must do now but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time can you say Amen so your life is not a waste get that out of your heads your life is not a waste no matter where you're at how discouraged you are and how small you feel and insignificant your life is not a waste if you're part of this boss body can you say amen and and God would send a message to make sure your life ain't a waste amen you're not just a pile of stones amen just here gathered up that God would send a message a stonemason Amen to take you as a stone take you out of that pile of rocks and begin to shape you and mold you and and all that to put you in the body now your life ain't a waste can you say amen that's right now in the body our nine spirit spiritual gifts that are still in operation amen today and and and they're they're within the body and and so I I do not believe that gifts are only being used outside the body of Christ if there's an impersonation still happening there's still a true that's still happening amen see so uh uh I I believe in the fifo ministry uh it is still in operation pastors teachers prophets evangelists ain't that right missionaries and and things like that uh uh they they God put them in in his body uh brother Brown said they are predestinated gifts amen see and so if we believe that the five gifts are in the body then there's got to be the nine spiritual gifts still in operation for God by Divine wisdom put them gifts in that body amen see so now I I want to say this cuz I uh uh a week ago or so heard a brother uh uh taking away these nine spiritual gifts out of the church uh because he says and he and he ties them with the first and second pull and he say see we're not in that second third pull we're in the third pull well first of all the nine spiritual gifts were in the body before the first and second pull and you never find brother brandham attributing the first and second pull to us that was for his ministry his ministry the nine spiritual gifts are for the body of Christ the first and second pull was for his ministry amen and that's what brother that's what the angel told brother brandom it's for your ministry it's for your Vindication can you say Amen gifts gifts the spiritual gifts are not for a Vindication of me not Vindication of you not Vindication of anybody it's it gifts have a purpose but the first and second pull was the Vindication of his ministry to catch our [Applause] attention can you say Amen so so the the first and second pull uh now this is just me the way I see it the way brother I feel like brother Brown taught it it was for him amen but the nine spiritual gifts are still in this body they are amen see so uh uh um uh you know I I see personally where where where according to the message where uh uh Satan took the gifts out of of the body and and he he he took uh he took a lot of things out of the body through the church ages that bride tree and it nearly killed the tree took it down to a stump ain't that right and then according to the message I see where God restored all this that Satan took out He restored it back into the body do you believe that see so so then here comes the the the word the perfect word the restored word amen and and we never I I have never seen where brother brandham took the gifts the nine spiritual gifts or even done away with the five gifts uh uh uh the five-fold ministry it's interesting how people want to take the five-fold ministry out amen but they'll only take the four gifts Pastor PR uh uh Pastor teacher evangelist and missionary and and they believe in one gift the prophet you know and and most of the time it's not brother brandom as the prophet it's some other Prophet oh so so they'll take out every gift except that one guy that one Prophet you you understand what I'm saying amen but God never promised that that's right never did never did see so uh uh uh then they want to limit you know uh oh oh well we believe in the five-fold ministry but you they just need to play tapes nonsense amen nonsense any preacher that's thinking about that you you just keep on preaching brother brah never took that out never did see so so he never took he never took any gift out of the body of Christ amen but rather He restored our faith our faith to believe in the whole word of God Amen you see for him to take for him to take anything out of the word out of the body which God put in that body based upon the word of God would be him to be a curse then you would be following a man that even Paul would consider a cursed ain't that right for Paul said in Galatians 1 and8 though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be a cursed can you say Amen now we're not pro following a message that's been cursed we're not pro uh following a man and saying that he is a prophet of Malachi 4 and say then now that that man is cursed because he took out gifts out of the Bible he took or out of out of the body of Christ and he took the spirit he took the anointing he took uh uh divine Supernatural out of the body of Christ he never did that and we're not following a cursed message we're not following a cursed Ministry we're following a a Ministry that God himself indicated amen 1953 brother I'm just going to read some quotes 1953 God gives gifts and put people in the church for different things a confirmation of his word and love 1954 God has set in the church some Apostles prophets teachers Gifts of healings speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues uh and all different uh all the different gifts he said in the church for the edifying of the church to bring the church together to make us one is that right to make us one in him a Brotherhood of one Soul one heart one body one spirit for we're not baptized in two Spirits one Spirit one God father of us all through all in all overall there's where these gifts in the church some of them can speak with tongues speak uh a gift of speaking with tongues another one has the gift of interpretation of tongues some are sent to preach see now we know that people that don't believe uh uh uh in Divine gifts and yet they're preachers well how did they get their inspiration then to preach from if there's not a gift of preaching then according to that every uh uh person is a preacher then see if there's not a certain gift for preaching than everyone's a preacher ain't that right see uh uh but the Bible said God has set some in the church God has Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors so forth all in the church see God has set them in there and they're inspired for a certain work ain't that right and then some people may possess more than one gift but there at least uh be one gift or more in a person see uh then all these things together working together for the upbuilding of the body of Christ getting her ready to go ain't that right so so that was in uh uh 1954 1957 and I could have went a lot more quotes I I didn't want to take up your time but 1957 I believe in all the manifestation of the gifts but they must be reverently placed in the body working exactly in harmony with the word of God 1960 brother Brandon in praying said May there be Gifts of Prophecy and all different manifestations not make belief or try to believe or put on may it be real genuine coming with the word the word of God made known prophesying things that comes to pass you said in your word Lord if there be one among you who claims to be or supposed to be a prophet and what he says and if he don't it don't come to pass don't hear him if it does come to pass then hear that Prophet for I'm with him God give us that kind of prophets give us the real kind the real kind that speaks with tongues the real kind that has the real interpretations right 1962 if you couldn't take my word then you'd just have to go see or if I couldn't take your word I you know it'd have to go but see that's not that's not that God's not that way he sends gifts into the church Apostles what is an apostle missionary missionary is one cent see Apostle one cent see a prophet that's a Seer a pastor a teacher evangelist all those things they rightly divide the word of God bring it down then the gifts of the Spirit to work in the church to confirm the word to show that Jesus Christ lives in the church these all these gifts are to confirm the word to show that Jesus Christ is in the church can you say Amen 63 being baptized by this token into the body of Christ 1 Corinthians uh first 1 Corinthians 12 now we are subject to gifts of the Spirit that's in there see in the body the world don't believe in gifts the church don't believe in gifts but God's word says there's gifts and it only and it takes only that token to identify those gifts absolutely in 65 in that body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local church uh the local body the local church that's Apostolic if I ever knew of it ain't that right so so so there brother BR never took gifts out of the church in and whatsoever that is part of our ministry amen of of of the body and and so now brother brandham condemned the Pentecostals churches for being so gullible and believe me they they were and they are gullible and and and it's so sad to say that people in the message are so gullible you know uh uh which shows that not all Israel is Israel right and so they they you know the Pentecostals they were teaching and accepting anything that wasn't even in the word they wouldn't even check it with the word they just oh wow they said it's of god let's go for it you know and and it's not true so brother Brown says this he says many of us go into church by shaking hands many of us by baptism many of us by sensation they've even got it down in the Southlands that you're not you ain't got the Holy Ghost until there's allil pouring out of your face or out of your your hands could you imagine being under that kind of teaching oh the pressure oh goodness you know let let me drink enough oil so it come out of my ears or something I don't know you know but but the pressure that they put people under the confusion that they put people under see uh other they crazy ideas see oh the weakness of the Pentecostal Church how long will you stand such things no wonder God can't restore the gifts and put them in the church he has no Foundation to lay it on see he will never lay it on anything but the foundation of the word of God no wonder these things are happening the way he knows the hearts of men he knows what's in you no matter what you say here he knows what's in you and he can't lay uh uh that foundation on anything else but this Bible see and and when we become so frazzled and so weak until we fall for every little wind of Doctrine we're like a leaf on an Autumn Lake that every little wind sweeps us this way and that way but be stable on the word of God we don't follow after gifts we know they're in the church but we're stable on the word of God we don't accept everything that is of God we're stable on the word of God Amen be stable on the word of God for you'll never pass with the that word prise God Amen so notice a lot of quotes but brother BR says now if I'm his servant then his word would come through a servant see seers prophets whatever you want to call them see that would be secondarily to the individual is that right he says see this is his word for the world but then he has set in the church Apostles prophets Gifts of healing speaking with tongu interpretation of tongues and all different kinds of gifts see and God has set them then but this is God's word first then my word if I be a servant must compare with that word if it isn't it isn't true you understand what I'm saying if the gifts ain't working with the word it ain't true amen everything must compare with the word of God everything and if we're members of that body then he is able to operate Accord with me according to the word of God and he's able to operate to all of us according to the word of God as members of his body can you say Amen if if if if if we're called to preach he will take us and put his word in our mouth and we will preach that word and we know what the word is the message of today not Baptist not not yesterday's the message of today can you say amen that's right see if we've got the same Ministry amen then then we've got the same passion we got the same motives we got the same goals and that is go get after that bride go go go after that one can you say Amen wow we're going to get out of here Sunday amen I can't help it that people reject the message of that and brother brandom couldn't help it but he preached It Anyways preach it testify of it so now notice he says now God can work through anything anything that he has promised anything that he has promised he could work he could work a dream if there's no Pro if there was no Prophet then he could work a dream no matter what our little gifts are God can speak to us in any way he wants to but it has to be with the word am ain't that right now you know and and we'll get into it more but brother Brown said if there's a dream and there's not a prophet then then the way he done it with because he said you know the prophet interprets the dream so he said like like with Joseph there you know having problems with dealing with Mary's situation he was minded to put her away but there was no Prophet that he could go to for the word of God so the God gave him a dream but what did he say that the the dream was with the word it didn't need interpreted amen it didn't need interpreted are you with me it didn't leave Joseph in confusion and then say okay now what do I do where's a prophet that I can interpret this dream no no no no it was already so explanatory that when he got up he knew it was of God it lined up with the word of God Behold a virgin shall conceive he knew by that dream God spoke to him that Mary was that Virgin of that scripture ain't that right see it has to be the word it has to be according to the word so now every true sign you know uh uh is sent from God has a voice behind it do you believe that it's what brother Ram said every true sign so if you're dream if you if if you got a dream and it's going to lead you away from the word of God then you better watch that voice amen you know someone have a dream and say well you you're supposed to move out to Tim Buck too you know and so you just follow the dream and ain't no no church ain't no nothing you just out there because based off of a dream something wrong with that ain't that right how many people have gone to churches other left their church and go to another church based off dreams of somebody else that they that had a dream and it caus nothing but trouble there you know what I'm saying it it's it's because they didn't go by Leading of of the Lord they went by dream you're not supposed to be led by dreams amen true amen amen so every true sign that is sent from God has a voice behind it notice brother Brown says now Satan can impersonate almost anything there is and he says there are signs that are not of God God there's things that are not of God ain't that right but a true sign sent from God will have a scriptural voice behind it yes sir ain't that right aren't you glad you have a prophet in this day a word Prophet the seals have been open Vindicated so thoroughly that you have no questions about it that you've got able to read behind be between the lines and understand understand the whole scope of things now notice see it's got to have a scriptural voice behind it now notice see so every dream got to be by the word every gift got to be by the word every prophecy got to be according to the word and you know you you have every right to judge these things it's got to be judged spiritual people got to judge it it's got to be judged and and and and and we'll get more into that but brother says these they they they got to be tried and true the the the the people that are judging it you know uh uh and these things but but it's got to be by the word of God based upon the word now notice what the prophet said she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride right I I truly believe that he saw us amen I I believe that this was prophetic of you and I that that which is perfect has come all the nonsense is going to be done away with see so so she's fixing to bring forth the church is fixing to bring forth that perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride see the shuck see uh uh you you know what brother Bram said in in the the seed shall not be air and with the Shu and is not air with the shook preach titled it both different ways but but the Shu we thought that that was the seed but it wasn't the seed it had to open up and and it rejected the message it rejected the message it it rejected us it rejected the seed but all the life went into the seed and that's us we we're not Chuck we're we're were the genuine word seed that are ripening in the presence of the sun I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of what God has done in this age I don't care who believes it and who don't believe it I ain't scared to offend anyone about it God sent a prophet I believe it it's my message and if they kicked him out they're going to kick you out just as much now we're not trying to be odd brother Bram never tried to be odd he was the he was the most friendliest loving kindness guy man there was and I think all of us need to be that way we should never walk up with with out of this and and go to our jobs or out in the stores and all that with our nose stuck up like we're some big hot shot amen no sir amen we are what we are by the grace of God God called you God ordained you but don't be ashamed of this message see so she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride see a woman is part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word dividing Church church every word of the Bible not systems dogmas or nothing added to it it'll have to be an unadulterated pure virgin word can you say Amen now we we know that the the restoration of the gifts are part of the word uh uh the same as justification and sanctification but but every one of them uh Through the Ages denominations got it all mixed up with their own ideas and and creeds and showing that they did not eat from the Tree of Life they ate from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's a mixed tree so they they didn't bring forth Eve did not bring forth a pure word son amen so so they get every they get all this stuff justification s everything that God done the Revival that God sent them they mixed it up with denominational ideas and teaching and but but in this age we're living in the evening light do you believe that we're living in the evening light and notice what brother Brown says it means that the denominational have faded away and the token has been applied and the token is Christ do you believe that see John 14:18 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you amen yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in my father you in me and I in you see it's not a sensation that we have received it's not a doctrine that we have received it's it's not an emotion that has come to us it's the living word that has come to us it's the quickening power the Dynamics that has come to us it's it's bringing a pure word see what is it brother Bram said it's uniting time of God and his bride coming together it's uniting time he said see the churches are uniting nations are uniting the unbeliever see the unbeliever and make Believers are actually uniting you don't find a makeb believer in this day really truly uniting with a real believer they ain't going to do that because if you stay with the message it shows them up every time shows just how carnal they are shows the carnal Ministry they have and shows their carnal actions and and and really their unbelief it it it's just there so it's the unbeliever and the make Believers that are uniting amen but but you'll never find a True Believer amen that that'll feel at home with the unbeliever and the makeb believer you know where they feel at home around the carcass of God's word Eagles Eagles are gathering amen Eagles are gathering around the word of God Eagles feel at home together because they're not gathering around some man's idea some personality some man's Ministry they're gathered around the word of God the revealed word now brother Braham said see I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture I believe it with all of my heart yes sir we know we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper we're waiting we're watching for that notice the Dynamics of this church will will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that and I say the full power of the Holy Ghost is here the holy spirit that has been bound by these denominational Rivers has been loosed in this evening time by the evening time message the D dyamics is here upon the mechanics he said see when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit you see the difference between our understanding the world and the Christian world they're prophesying America America America God's going to bless America Revival Coming to America but we have an understanding we know he's with us they don't see him the way we see him they don't understand who he is in this day he is the Dynamics that has come to us and has quickened us we have come head and body has United together now we're saying even so Lord Jesus come see it's you notice it's you and Christ as persons together it's the Holy Spirit his life in you working his own life through you another place the new token is the new life that comes through Jesus Christ when his blood was shed to sanctify a church and fill it with his presence that he might manifest his word and his promises to the people God going to manifest his promises God's going to manifest his word God's going to do carry his word out through somebody amen it might as well be us can you say amen that's why we must be sincere more than we've ever never had before get out of our worldly ideas and our our materialistic thinking I understand that we' got to live we got to we got to make dos and all that but don't you let life overtake you and this life become more prominent in your life than this word this message don't ever get too busy we're coming amen we're ready for a Rapture this life means nothing to us amen can you amen amen not making more excuses anymore no life God has become the most important thing church is important to us preaching is important sing Everything is important to us our coming in this place our attitudes is important to us yes sir see so notice now he in another place it's the head everybody say it's the head Christ see see so he's the Dynamics he's he's he's the the token now he's saying it's the head amen Christ coming to the body the body of Christ he is the one who knows see my my hand don't know how to act just by my head but he is the one who knows why He's the head that's the reason he is the word I'm not the word I'm a man you're not the word you're just a man a woman part of a body he's the word he's the head now because the head knows he knows what his will is he knows what God wants done he's the one he's the intelligence ain't that right see I'm not the word I'm a man see he said but you see he uses this body because he died to sanctify this body that he might use it and give a gift just like pulling it out of gear then the Holy Spirit takes over amen amen God see another place it's like the head has to go to take the foot the head has to go to take the hand the head has to go to take the heart the head has to go to take the mouth in other words you got to have a head if the mouth is going to speak you got to have a head the hands are going to move you got to have a head right body can't do nothing without headship cu the intelligence is in the head and the head has come to the body we're not doing our own will no more we we are now the only thing you don't have to work up a gift well if I could just have a dream if God would just use me if God just used me yield to him yield to this word yield to the message just believe make yourself available headship he will use you when he wants to use [Music] you brother Brown said see the the last thing is is his divine presence the word itself he is the word the head the word it's coming to the body so his divine presence the word is come to the body the Lord I'm so glad for that amen even though each member has their own Ministry and is used in different ways every one of us as members of the body are under the same headship it's the same spirit that operates each member of the body Now 1 Corinthians 12:4 now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are differences of administrations but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all see it's all under headship but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to provit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom Amen to another the word of knowledge knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will ain't that right so it's the same Spirit Dynamics amen token right that that is operating throughout the body hope you understand that see don't I don't I don't know where what you all have been taught with gifts and and things but gifts belong in the body and he's here he's here to operate them things in a perfect way now brother Braham said God's Eternal Plan of Salvation for his people is the Holy Spirit in the church so say that again that's powerful brother BR said God's Eternal plan for his people is the holy spirit in the church Born Again men and women operated by the Holy Spirit not trying to operate the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit operating them that's right don't try to be somebody just be yielded to the Holy Spirit that's God's Eternal Plan of Salvation is Christ in you you believe it can't be dissatisfied with our gifts can't be dissatisfied with our calling whatever God has called us to be let's do it with everything that's within us let him have his P full potential in US Yes sirl again those in his body his bride do only his will what does that mean it shows that he is able to have preeminence in his bride yes sir brother Braham said if you're born of the word of God if you're born of the word of God baptized by one Spirit into one body God's word has preeminence in his church that's what he died for that's his purpose that he might be able to achieve to have preeminence working in his church how we need more word birth amen true we need more word birth word birth then God can have preeminence yes that's right that's true Romans 8:14 Paul said for as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God they're not led by feelings they're not led by emotions they're not led by Impressions they're led by the spirit of God Amen these people God is able to have total preeminence they'll be misunderstood but they'll be right with the word they'll not be popular but they'll be right with the word they they they may not even understand themselves but it'll all be right with the word yeah you believe it they're not led by feelings emotions all these things see they have thus sayi the Lord they keep still that what the prophet said they have thus sayth the Lord or they keep still yes sir Impressions don't move them right feelings emotions don't move them you know whatever you know there see every member of the body is disciplined now to the word of God to the word it's a word birth amen and so their thoughts are disciplined to the word their actions are disciplined to the word their gift is disciplined to the word their Ministry is disciplined to the word brother Bram says if the spirit leads you contrary to the word then it's not of the spirit of God that's right I don't care what it is and this is where people get so mixed up on God Godly love and human love human love takes them totally contrary to the word of God every time compassion compassion compassion compassion and by compassion they're building hospitals and by compassion they're having you know all of these these societies and by compassion God never told us to do them things that's right come on Brother come on brother amen see so if the spirit leads you contrary to the word then it's not the spirit of God if the holy spirit is leading you it'll say Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if it's a religious spirit or some other type of spirit that isn't of the spirit of God it'll say oh that was for a day gone by don't worry about that right he says so how can you make that act right now we've read it before but in another place he says make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost that's why a True Believer that's in the word all the way does not take away dancing shouting worshiping praising God it doesn't take away all these things it's in the word you're in the word all the way can you say amen that's why we don't take gifts out of the church that's why we don't we just we we come as a word people yielded to the word of God that God you just have your way tonight can you say Amen why we're in the word all the way from Genesis to Revelations our what our faith is based upon it runs all the way [Applause] through am in the word all the way so we're not a people that take some out and add some too make it fit our little fancy see so then if a person is in in the word all the way then he has received the spirit of truth and not the spirit of eror remember the Bible talks about the spirit of Truth and the spirit of air and and in this day there is the spirit of truth that God promised to sin but also at the same time there is the spirit of air and it's so deceptive so one one hears the truth and the other one doesn't hear one follows after the truth the other one doesn't see and and so this is how we know the difference between the TR the the the the the the two because both will operate in their Ministries both operate the gifts both are used in Prophecy t and and miracles and and and and and and both operate within the fivefold ministry just as much as anything else both carry offices in the church both they they they they both but but but one is led by the spirit of Truth the other one is led by the spirit of error come on now all right and the spirit of Truth the spirit of Truth has preeminence within the body of Christ not the spirit of air amen the spirit of air is leading those outside the body can you say amen I hope this all right but brother BR said Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God has got but he cannot everybody say cannot one thing he cannot do he cannot bring that word word by word word by word word by word amen you realize that all the people that through all the ages have failed failed in one way or another were one way or another but in this day the word is coming perfect word bride perfect word bride perfect word bride man to be part of this yes sir to to to to be this is It's the grace of God Amen sure Judas you know was numbered with the 12 and and actually had a part with the ministry sure he did previous to to Pentecost brother Bram said he had a god-given holy ghost Ministry but lost it sure did ain't that right he said he was chosen of God was instructed in truth he shared knowledge of the Mysteries had a Ministry of power granted unto him he healed the sick cast out devils in jesus' name but when The Showdown came he solded out for gold and political power he did not go up to Pentecost to receive the spirit of God he was devoid of the spirit other place he SED Jesus see Judas SED Jesus the word to his denomination and betrayed Jesus Christ after he claimed to be a part of it notice what brother BR said if any gift or any angel or anything doesn't speak directly by the word of God it is not the right kind of Angel right amen another place false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the the word here is what does it by the word can you say Amen do you prophesy wonderful do you speak with tongues great you see Visions dreams wonderful have you had spiritual Supernatural experiences great we're glad for you amen but the question is are you standing with the [Music] word ain't that right see we we we don't deny the gifts we don't deny them things this is exactly what Jesus said we to do right but does the word have preeminence over you over your gift over your ministry is everything being checked with the word even brother Bram checked everything with the word if an angel came to him and start talking to him he said I always check it with the word always check it with a word thank God for a true word Prophet don't just say well you know what I've been in the presence of God so any Angel going to come to me is going to be just right and then he starts leading by inspir uh uh uh what what uh uh you know Impressions and this and this and all this thing nope he checked it all with the word he wanted to make sure his inspiration was right with this word can you say Amen it's a word ministry a word bride Amen brother amen one night brother brand had just started preaching and I think it was in the church ages uh he he's preaching the church ages and he just started preaching and a woman started speaking in tongues and and when she finished brother Bram didn't say nothing he just immediately started praying and in his prayer he said Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven we ask you to be with us father and bless us and help us to be wise Master Builders in this hour of great distress amongst the people when confusion and all is being carried on help us to be our best Lord to be your servants through Christ's name amen am what a prayer right then he says this he said now I said that first that you might know did you notice the interpretation didn't come to the word see our sister was anointed with the Holy Spirit no doubt but she had gave the message after the word had already coming to see it's just a little bit from the order of the thing now that was all right dear sister whoever you are see Holy Spirit upon you oh it's so hard to hold it like that see I know he says or when you be saying something and another see that it was all right but you probably felt it even before that we started see and that's the reason see it comes back when the spirit's working the spirits of the prophesy are subject to the prophets you see that's you see so he says now maybe the Holy Spirit anoints you again I hope he does just after the service is over and you watch the interpretation come because it should be straight right be right straight in order then you see but we're just approaching the words you see in here now that was really of God it really was I I believe it and I feel it with my all my heart because I felt it come back to it you see but the Holy Spirit it wasn't time see he's got a message to the sister for the church but here here's where he's working his message now that's you see he won't confuse himself he puts all things in order wow see that's what God was doing in this age by this message putting it all in order we had a lot of confusion in Pentecost and a lot of Pentecostals have come into this message bringing a lot of confusion and a lot of Methodist and Baptist and naysay all them coming in the message bringing a lot of confusion but to this bride she has thus said the Lord and no one no one will convince her to do otherwise amen see God is not the author of confusion everything he does is according to the promise word If he prophesies if he prophesies right through you then it'll be right in line with the word of God if he speaks in tongues through you it'll speak according along right with the word of God the way the word of God says it if he interprets tongues it'll speak according to the word of God any Divine gift that God uses will operate according to the word of God it'll be in scn do you believe that now notice I'm getting ready closed now but I'm going to say some things and and I want it said this morning see but 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul said now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all everybody say you all speak the same thing amen amen and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment amen now if you notice he's not telling us all do the same thing no no no see we all don't have to work the same gift for Paul says there are diversities of gifts there's there's differences of administration there are diversities of operation one is given the word of wisdom another word of knowledge another Faith another gift of healings others G workings of Miracles gift of prophecies different you know Discerning of spirits and and and and to another divers of tongues and another interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and self Same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will but but we are commanded all commanded to say the same thing amen ain't that right see so brother R says what causes division what causes it is men getting away from the word that's what causes division see see before before the Tower of Babel was built you can read about it in the Book of Genesis they were all had all one language they were all together right one heart all these things but they all spoke one language and and and brother Bram in the church AG book quotes a a writer and and this writer said see for many ages men lived under the government of of Jo J ove and then parenthesis not Roman Jo but Jehovah of the Hebrews who predates Roman history but they all lived under the government see of of Jehovah of the Hebrews without cities without laws and all speaking one language but after that mercury uh Kush uh uh uh Kush was the father of nimrod and he became the father of the Gods you see and and and he he actually ended up being called baale uh uh but but he interpreted the speeches of men see went an in interpreter is called uh some word her her Herman Herman or something like that the same individual distributed the Nations so he he he he began to take order see then Discord began see it is seen from this that Bale or Kush the father of nimrod originally was the ring leader that led the people away from the true God yes and encouraged the people as The Interpreter of gods to take another form of religion he encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built this encouraged judement is what brought the confusion and the division of men so that he was both interpreter and confuser is that not what men have done with Satan has allowed him to be both interpreter and confuser of the word of God Amen that's right see so so then then this explains why brother Brandon would say many will misunderstand talking about the prophet of Malachi 4 when it comes many will misunderstand because they have been taught scripture in a certain way which they consider truth yeah when he comes against that of what they consider truth they will not believe even some true ministers will misunderstand the messenger because so much has been called God's truth by deceivers amen can you say Amen but does that make his message of no good oh no no no brother said he is the last Messenger to the elect and word born bride he didn't come for everybody he didn't stop all confusion in this world but he did stop it for this bride this elect this word born bride amen can you say Amen so if division is is caused by men getting away from the word of God then Unity people speaking the same thing Paul was saying comes by men staying with the word of God ain't that right so then in Revelations 10 John was commanded to go to the angel and get the book and eat it very powerful yes very important for us amen because John represented the bride for this day he represented you amen right amen and and and notice he wasn't being led by the spirit of of air he was being led by the spirit of Truth the spirit of Truth led him to the book The Spirit of Truth inspired him to go get the book ain't that right and to eat it see it it was the spirit of a that led Eve away from the word of God and caused her to eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil but John is not eating of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil this is powerful man has been eaten from the Tree of knowledge all through the years but there is a bride on the earth that the spirit has been able to have preeminence over and lead him back amen that's good that's right praise the Lord so again I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment how's it going to be go get get go to the angel and eat the book amen can you say Amen see when you get the book that's when you come out of babet that's right you come out of this confusion yeah you come back to being one language one mind one thought one motive you say amen that's when you really become part of the message is when you eat the book you personally have got to eat the book you personally have got to go to that angel brother Brown said you can sympathize sympathize with the message and say it's right but you got to take it yourself to become part of it then you and the message become one then the anointing is with you that's as it is with others ain't that right amen if you notice it was an open book that John ate it wasn't a closed book it was an open book oh yeah and it gave him great understanding of this book gave him great understanding of the promises it placed him in this book he began to see himself as being bride he began to see himself as being redeemed he began to see himself that every promise in this book was available to him he wasn't sitting there weeping anymore he wasn't there sitting there crying anymore the lamb had been worthy to open the book ain't that right and he ate the book notice he ate the book after after the seventh angel open uh revealed the book after The Seven Angels sounded amen the Mysteries were revealed then John was told to eat the book we have never been told to eat the book under a Pentecostal age under a Baptist Methodist presbyter whatever it's only when the seventh angel come and God revealed this Mysteries to us and the word of God was made open to us now you're told to eat the book don't you stand back there and let the prophet do it all you eat the book can you say amen God never called us just be continue on being church members break the cycle of this thing break the sa of Leia eat the book bless God bless God thank you Jes eat the book can you say amen and notice when brother brandham received the revelation of the book CU remember the lamb took the book opened the book tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to his seventh angel to reveal it to his people he did ain't that right then John was told to eat the book Thank You Lord but notice when brother bradam received the Revelation when he received it amen what happened he said a sword appeared into his hand a sword remember he's out on the on on on on back side of the desert and a sword and he say I've always been scared of swords knives amen he said you know Pearl he just describes the beauty of this thing and he said you know it and the voice said if you're not if you're not is the king sword and he said now if it would have said a king sword he said see but it didn't say a he said the king and there's only one the king and that's Jesus Christ and he is the word can you say Amen what handed to him amen this Revelation was a sword sword he had now the weapon to set you free to deliver you to break every bondage in your life do you believe it is this what this message is doing it is to this elect it is it's cutting them loose from everything it's time for Rapture cutting us all the strings of Earthbound things it's time for Rapture taking all the doubt cutting us all cutting all that out of us to get us to back to a perfect word bride it's time for a Rapture yes sir he says see I went up in the C Canon climbed up up where the Eagles was flying around I was watching some deer standing there and I knelt down to pray and raised my hand and a SW sword struck my hand I looked around and I thought what's that he said I'm not beside myself here's that sword in my hand bright shiny glistening in the sun I said now there's not people in miles of me way up here in this Canyon where could that come from there was no one to give him the Revelation amen see he said I Heard a Voice say that's the king's SW and I said a king kns a man with the sword and he The Voice come back said not a king's sword but the king sword watch the word of the Lord and said fear not it's only the third pull can you say that with me the third pull the third pull he never Associated the first and second pull to you but he Associated the third pull to you the first and second pull was not for you and me it it was for his ministry to vindicate his ministry but the third poll which is the opening of the word coming back to a bride it's your ministry it's part of you and you say amen amen another place said something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pool yes sir one place brother Bram identified it as the opening of the word another place he said the third pool was the opening of them Seven Seals to R the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word you get it John did not eat anything outside of what the seventh angel brought true hello he didn't eat a new revelation that brother brandom brought he didn't eat it he ate the same book same Revelation same inspiration you believe it his ministry he talks about it how his ministry was changing right his ministry is changing do you realize that your ministry has changed too just take for us ministers for example if any of you been in the Pentecostal or whatever denomination you were in or even inner denom non denominational You Preach certain things say certain things do certain thing all these things and and you done it the best of your knowledge then when you come into the message something changed about it even parents what a me difference a message home is versus a just an other regular home because now your father you fathers are coming into order your Mo you mothers are coming into order not everybody in this message is doing that you know but that's okay but the elec is the true word bride is why because everything's lining up with the word of God hey this message affects you it does not just affect you here in church it affects you just say in this church not notice how how the aposto all them just talk in church and Mumble and and laugh and cut up we used to do that we play tag in our church after church us when we were B these boys as age you know mo most of the children sit in the back chewing gum passing note there's something about our young people that are different this message has done that this message has taught us to reverence the house of God not to talk and not to play and not to cut up you know I I thank God for message this message it has taken our young people to a higher level it has taken parents to a higher level it it has taken the preachers to a higher level it has taken the church to a higher level can you say Amen we come in we know how to worship we know how to bring the presence of God without a bunch of of of of hum drum music working something up just let the song leader get anointed and and and and and get his mind off of everything get out of the corruption of this world Amen and get into a place of of a real anointed let the musician get anointed amen and I'm talking about every Tom Dick and Harry out there and all their problems and all that amen you know how to do it let the people come in anointed creating an atmosphere and God meets with them right oh yeah we know how to do it because the message has brought us up to a place the message has changed our thoughts it's changed our ideas it's changed changed everything amen that's true that's right amen you love the Lord amen praise the Lord good preacher see he didn't need to eat partake of a new revelation that brother Bram didn't bring the seventh angel but notice when he ate it John said in Revelations 10:10 he said I took the little book out of the Angel's hand now that's you this what's going to happen to you just the same because he's symbolic of the Bride and ate it up and it was sweet in my mouth in my mouth as sweet as sunny and as soon as I had eaten it it was in my belly bitter and brother Brown said see when you have to digest it then it gets bitter oh yeah everybody's against you so quit trying to be friends with everybody TR quit trying to please everybody I think we we get so messed up in our ideology about things that that in order to love we have to we have to compromise you don't compromise nothing that's human love that's not godly love Godly love will tell you exactly where you're wrong and and and and you can either accept it or not but I ain't you know you ain't going to be your friend just or or try to sit there and please you and Shine Your Boots just just so you accept me you eat the word it becomes bitter the world comes against you why because you're you you're going to be considered Oddball you're going to be considered hateful you're going to be considered narrow-minded and yet all the time you're loving them you're loving people but see it's because Something's Happened it's not because you're SE segregating it's not something that you're just well I hate you I don't like you and you're being snobby you've V in a book it's it's it's something everybody's against you everybody telling oh you're a Holy Roller you're this that or the other see you're off your head see so it's hard to digest it but when you're testifying of his glory it's sweet in your lips when you stand up in a meeting and you say glory to God hallelujah oh see when you're going through that great Siege it's hard but then when you're out of that great Siege you can testify of it then it's sweet in the lips can you amen amen then the next thing after he ate the book The Voice told him in Revelations 10:11 thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and Kings why now he's being commissioned because the word is in him amen the word is in him it's in his mouth it's in his soul it's in his being so what's he going to say what what now what is John going to say is he going to continue on with the Babbling and the confusion of the other ages is is is he now going to come and and start operating gifts and his ministry the way it's always being operated under the Pentecostal age is it going to just just well it doesn't matter glory to God I'm you know praise God you know and then he just sits there and causes a bunch of confusion what's he going to do with this amen you're going to prophesy every one of you got something to do you eat this book you're going to do something now what are you going to do do with it true I don't think so I don't think John was going to sit there and his prophecy going to be a mass confusion his prophecy going to be of Doubt to where when he's done and and and as I've told you before it's not the gift of prophesying that he's doing it's speaking the word yes it's his ministry it's it's for all of us every one of us going to have to prophesy we got some prophesying to do as the body of Christ when you eat this book you've got some prophesying to do True Praise the Lord so here we are he represents the bride and here's this last day John writes Revelations 22 And1 17 and the spirit and the bride say come amen come right notice what the prophet says now listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word do you love him amen she is the final voice yes sir to this final age if the musicians will come that's good and John wasn't told to follow after gifted people he wasn't told to go after prophesied Visions all the time and dreams he wasn't told to go after people that dance and shout all the time or that is so Pious and you know he was told to go to the one that had the book amen can you say amen amen go go to that quickening power go to the quickening power let it Quicken brother brother Brown said the word was quickened to John it was quickened go to the Dynamics can you say Amen yes gifts will be impersonated fruits of the spirit will even be impersonated sure brother Bram even talked about that how that that the the the the priest in jesus' day showed more fruits of the spirit than Jesus did when he went in there and let his R righteous IND thetion people call it losing his temper but he got that Whip and he beat them guys out of that that church he said that day the priest showed more fruits of the spirit than even he did but notice he said remember Satan will try to impersonate he will try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it we've noticed it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there will be no mimics to this cuz he don't know it there's no way for him to know it it's the third pull he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it and remember what the Bible says in this day there will be a famine [Music] not for water or for bread but for hearing the word of God they don't know what it is I hope it's all right to you brother brandham said see he said Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel see word and God confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed the Devils were cast and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action see that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last day it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to that word fill your heart or your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom can you sayen oh isn't he wonderful amen amen amen what song give me the [Music] [Applause] world give me the word it's a light
