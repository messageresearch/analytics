[46:25] Ephesians um
[46:27] the first chapter first verse we'll
[46:30] start there but it says Paul an apostle
[46:32] of Jesus Christ by the will of God to
[46:35] the Saints which are at Ephesus and to
[46:38] the faithful in Christ
[46:39] Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God
[46:43] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[46:45] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[46:49] our Lord Jesus
[46:51] Christ uh who hath blessed us with all
[46:54] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[46:56] in Christ
[46:58] according as he has chosen Us in him
[47:00] before the foundation of the world that
[47:02] we should be holy and Without Blame
[47:05] before him in love having predestinated
[47:09] us unto the adoption of children by
[47:12] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[47:16] good pleasure of his will amen then if
[47:21] you'll turn with me uh to the book of
[47:24] First Peter I believe uh the first
[47:27] chapter First Peter chapter 1 and while
[47:31] you're turning there um next Wednesday
[47:34] uh brother Ben shaml is going to be
[47:37] ministering for us he's a young young
[47:40] brother and um uh they were passing
[47:44] through uh the family and um many of you
[47:48] may know the the shamama family but um
[47:53] they they were coming through and so I
[47:55] asked if he would Minister uh next
[47:58] Wednesday and then also uh brother
[48:01] Andrew uh will be here Wednesday night
[48:04] as well and uh he he wanted to to come
[48:08] and talk to you all uh talk to all of us
[48:11] I guess um on a
[48:13] Sunday but uh it's just not working out
[48:17] at this
[48:18] time um uh he's he's trying to get
[48:22] trying to get um move his schedule
[48:25] around but uh um uh pastors aren't um
[48:31] well they they just holding him to the
[48:33] fire at this point and so um uh so he he
[48:39] asked if that would be all right I said
[48:41] well that that'll be fine and so um he's
[48:45] going to be here Wednesday night going
[48:47] to uh to talk to us and uh maybe you'll
[48:51] know more about his heart and where he's
[48:55] at and so I ask that all all of the home
[48:59] folk if you can come uh um I know
[49:02] Wednesday nights are a little bit um uh
[49:06] uh um well low low on the crowd but uh
[49:11] if if you can and maybe if someone's
[49:13] watching uh online but we'll uh talk
[49:16] with maybe sister Martha to uh send out
[49:19] a text but um so if if you can be here
[49:23] Wednesday that would be be great and um
[49:27] uh then at a later time um we we're
[49:30] going to try to get brother Andrew to
[49:32] come and Minister for us and so um
[49:37] anyways but U so first Peter I think
[49:40] that's where we're at First Peter
[49:43] 1:23 amen it says being born again not
[49:47] of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible
[49:49] by the word of God which liveth and
[49:53] abideth forever amen then 1 Peter 2 and
[49:58] two just write down a little bit it says
[50:02] wherefore uh we we'll start the first
[50:04] verse wherefore laying aside all malice
[50:07] and all Gile and hypocrisies and envies
[50:10] and all evil speakings as newborn babes
[50:14] desire the milk of the word that you may
[50:18] grow thereby amen you can have your
[50:22] seats praise the
[50:25] Lord the um and it's good to have
[50:27] brother Josiah and David amen and uh
[50:31] back from
[50:32] Ohio but um um now if if I could uh
[50:39] maybe H use a title it would be growing
[50:41] in the right
[50:43] atmosphere and um you know uh I'm glad
[50:48] that we have the ability to grow uh God
[50:51] wants us to grow we're we're not just
[50:54] here church members just what in our
[50:57] thumb waiting for the Rapture to happen
[51:00] uh we're growing into it we're growing
[51:03] into full statures of sons of God and uh
[51:09] we we know that God uh didn't start
[51:13] working on a
[51:14] plan uh uh for our lives when we got
[51:18] saved um um but God um being all knowing
[51:25] and uh having an infinite
[51:28] mind uh then he he had a plan before the
[51:32] foundation of the world so he didn't
[51:34] start working on a plan he's not
[51:36] currently working on a plan for your
[51:39] life for my life he's already got it uh
[51:43] uh taken care of and Isaiah 46 and9 it
[51:48] says remember the former things of old
[51:50] for I am God and there is none else I am
[51:54] God and there is none like me declaring
[51:57] the end from the beginning and from
[52:00] ancient times the things that are not
[52:03] yet done so then God already knows all
[52:07] about us do you believe
[52:08] that and um uh and and so uh we're we're
[52:15] he he's a he's a god of purpose he's a
[52:17] God that uh does things uh in his timing
[52:22] and and he's got things that he just
[52:24] doesn't do by accident he didn't save
[52:26] you by accident he didn't come to die by
[52:29] accident and he didn't come to do all
[52:31] these things uh just in
[52:34] general uh maybe to save you and then
[52:37] just leave you to what you decide what
[52:39] you want to do in life and I decide what
[52:42] I want to do in life and then we just
[52:45] all arrive at different places and then
[52:47] the Rapture comes but he's got a
[52:50] specific will he's got a specific
[52:52] destination he's got a he's got a
[52:54] specific outcome that he wants for all
[52:57] of our Lives you believe that so now we
[53:00] so we we e every every minute detail of
[53:05] his plan for our
[53:07] lives um I is well I I just personally
[53:12] believe that it's not revealed to us all
[53:14] at once I I think we could all um agree
[53:18] to that that there are times that we
[53:20] think God uh what what is your plan for
[53:24] my life what do I do next what do I do
[53:27] you know you know and and and so it kind
[53:30] of leaves us stumped sometimes it kind
[53:32] of leaves us as you know what you know
[53:36] what are we doing here you know and but
[53:39] but one thing that we do know is that
[53:41] God does have a plan for us and so he he
[53:45] doesn't just uh stop in Midstream and he
[53:49] he you know just because you and I feel
[53:52] like maybe we're wasting time or or that
[53:56] uh uh nothing is is really going on in
[53:58] our lives does not mean that God has
[54:00] aborted his plan concerning us it's just
[54:05] we we we we feel these things sometime
[54:07] because uh we don't know just every
[54:11] every plan or every uh minute detail
[54:14] that God has for us now I I believe that
[54:19] the the desired
[54:20] end of God's purpose has been revealed
[54:26] to us uh it has been uh like like the
[54:30] Bible even talks about being conformed
[54:33] uh to the image of his son now you
[54:35] didn't start out that way when you were
[54:37] born and you didn't start out that way
[54:39] when you were saved but that is the
[54:42] desired end that God has for all of us
[54:45] do you believe that not just one not
[54:48] just for the prophet but for all of us
[54:50] as the bride of Christ uh uh the Bible
[54:53] talks about the adoption of sons the
[54:55] manifestation of sons uh it it you know
[54:58] talks about fellowship with him and uh
[55:02] uh defeating the devil at every turn and
[55:05] and and the the prophet talked about you
[55:08] know uh uh living so so uh to a place
[55:12] that the devil don't know what to do
[55:14] with us well these are are I I believe
[55:18] that this is the desired end of what God
[55:22] is after that's that's the that's the
[55:24] goal that God is after for all of our
[55:27] Lives amen and and so it's the end
[55:30] result and so every promise of God and
[55:34] and and and this is what I love about it
[55:37] is that God even though we may not know
[55:40] God's will in in between uh times
[55:43] sometimes but it does leave us that
[55:46] there is an outcome to everything you
[55:49] you you may be in your trial right now
[55:52] but you can look at the book and know
[55:54] that there's an outcome to that trial
[55:56] and and and uh uh uh uh so there there's
[56:00] always the outcome and and that outcome
[56:02] is we are victorious that outcome is
[56:05] that God is with us that outcome is that
[56:08] we will be more like him that that
[56:10] outcome do you believe that amen and and
[56:13] so sometime we cry sometimes we we we we
[56:16] scratch our head and sometime we just
[56:18] feel all alone and sometime but but we
[56:21] can always no matter where you're at in
[56:24] life and and and and what Direction and
[56:27] and you might just feel like your life
[56:28] is upside down and and all this stuff
[56:31] you can always take it by the Bible and
[56:33] look that there's an outcome God is
[56:36] faithful to his word do you believe that
[56:38] and and so uh uh uh now so so th this is
[56:43] God uh that that is Desiring for us to
[56:46] come up uh uh to hire now we we are not
[56:50] trying to achieve these things uh to
[56:54] come up with the the uh um desired end
[56:58] that God has for our life we're we're
[57:00] not trying to accomplish that on our own
[57:03] amen and um um you know we're not trying
[57:08] to achieve something that is not already
[57:11] within us to to do it amen it's already
[57:16] within us to do these things do you
[57:18] believe that amen see we already we
[57:22] already have the
[57:24] potential uh uh with in us and brother
[57:27] brandham called this potential he called
[57:30] it God's potential amen so we have his
[57:34] potentials already within us now that
[57:37] word potential is existing in
[57:41] possibility capable of development into
[57:45] actuality amen so these potentials are
[57:48] already in you it's it's not God adding
[57:51] it to you giving it to you but it was
[57:54] already given to you for the foundation
[57:57] of the world so this word potential also
[58:00] means promise and that word promise in
[58:03] this uh instance is reason to expect
[58:06] something ground for expectation of
[58:10] success Improvement or Excellence can
[58:13] you say Amen so so we hold the his
[58:17] potential we we we hold the promise of
[58:20] of of of achieving of excelling of
[58:24] development amen and and so we don't
[58:27] have to sit there amen and and whether
[58:30] we feel capable or not it's already
[58:33] within us to achieve amen whether you
[58:36] you you cannot look at yourself and say
[58:38] well I just don't know how I'm going to
[58:39] do it it's already in you to do it amen
[58:42] it it's already uh uh put within you so
[58:46] so then then for us to say well I can
[58:49] never be anything different than what I
[58:51] already am that's wrong even to talk
[58:54] like that well well
[58:56] I've always been this way so I can never
[58:58] change amen that's wrong to even look at
[59:01] it that way the potential's already in
[59:04] you to be what God has called you to be
[59:08] amen do you believe that see and and so
[59:11] uh uh you know as I uh you know uh hear
[59:15] my children uh you know play instruments
[59:17] at home and and and and see you know I
[59:21] as I'm hearing it I I hear that they I I
[59:24] can hear the potential I I see that
[59:26] there's potential already in them of
[59:30] becoming great musicians it's it's
[59:33] already in them and and see the
[59:35] potential is there they they you know
[59:38] they can get on the piano and they start
[59:40] picking things out and and and that
[59:42] tells me that they've got a potential
[59:44] it's there amen they get on the drums
[59:47] they get on the bass they get on you
[59:48] know whatever and the guitar or whatever
[59:51] the potential is already there within
[59:54] them amen to to become something greater
[59:58] amen uh and and and so now uh uh they
[1:00:03] they they can live in an atmosphere you
[1:00:06] know uh where with with people that
[1:00:08] don't like music and that just Trash
[1:00:11] Talk musicians and don't have a desire
[1:00:14] and they think you know that music is
[1:00:16] just stupid and and and anyone that
[1:00:19] wants to play music is just crazy and
[1:00:21] well they can live among them people
[1:00:24] like that and and and you'll watch it
[1:00:27] will affect that potential that they
[1:00:30] have within them maybe you know they
[1:00:33] they they won't try as hard they won't
[1:00:35] they won't dedicate as as much they
[1:00:37] won't venture out into the music world
[1:00:40] because everybody's going to laugh at
[1:00:41] them see they they come into an
[1:00:44] atmosphere where where you know no one
[1:00:46] sees any need for music and they they
[1:00:49] think it's crazy or or whatever can you
[1:00:52] say man and and so they they will never
[1:00:55] fully develop but you get them in in uh
[1:00:58] uh someone that has that potential to
[1:01:01] become a great musician or whatever get
[1:01:04] them around good teachers get them
[1:01:05] around good uh musicians get get get
[1:01:09] them around that they feed from that and
[1:01:11] they they talk music and they live music
[1:01:14] and they breathe music and people's
[1:01:16] encouraging them people's giving them
[1:01:18] the opportunity to Excel and and and
[1:01:21] these things then then that potential
[1:01:25] that is already already in them all of a
[1:01:27] sudden will start blossoming and start
[1:01:29] developing and and and and but it was
[1:01:32] already in them to begin with they were
[1:01:35] just in the atmosphere that would allow
[1:01:38] them to express and allow them to to
[1:01:41] grow now so so that may be just a little
[1:01:45] bit of a a u uh an example that you
[1:01:48] think well that was kind of crazy but
[1:01:51] but it it's still what it's something
[1:01:53] that I think is uh fit
[1:01:56] uh uh in Matthew 13th chapter um uh
[1:02:00] Jesus talked to two different kinds of
[1:02:03] seeds uh being sown and that is the
[1:02:06] wheat and that is the tears ain't that
[1:02:08] right and so the seed was swn by two
[1:02:11] different sers uh uh uh God and Satan
[1:02:15] they're they're the sers and God solded
[1:02:17] his seed first uh and he sold the wheat
[1:02:21] amen and uh which Jesus called The Good
[1:02:24] Seed and then Satan came along afterward
[1:02:28] and sold his seed which was the tears
[1:02:31] ain't that right amen and and Jesus said
[1:02:34] that they they the seed that they sewed
[1:02:37] it into amen or what they sowed into was
[1:02:40] the the the world the field is the world
[1:02:44] that that both sers sowed seed in and so
[1:02:47] Jesus said that the good seed that that
[1:02:50] that God would swow is the children of
[1:02:52] the kingdom and and the seed that Satan
[1:02:55] s sold amen uh uh is the children of the
[1:02:58] wicked one amen see and so but but look
[1:03:03] at that seed that God that God sold amen
[1:03:07] it is not just a seed it's a
[1:03:10] predestinated seed do you believe that
[1:03:14] it's a predestinated seed and so now it
[1:03:17] may surprise you that that there are
[1:03:19] people that don't believe in
[1:03:21] predestination and uh you know um uh
[1:03:25] they they believe that if a man has any
[1:03:27] seed then it's it within him it's it's
[1:03:30] it's it's been sown here um uh while
[1:03:34] he's been here on the earth and all that
[1:03:37] uh uh by receiving the word of God into
[1:03:39] his heart but but but this Incorruptible
[1:03:43] seed was swn into a man before the world
[1:03:46] ever began uh and that comes by
[1:03:50] predestination and and you know uh uh so
[1:03:54] so uh by that predestination God has
[1:03:57] already determined your path God's
[1:04:00] already determined your outcome God's
[1:04:02] already put the potential already within
[1:04:04] you so this is not a guesswork to God
[1:04:07] this is not just something that is
[1:04:09] random amen but this is something that
[1:04:12] God purposed for your life amen as I
[1:04:16] said he doesn't explain all the
[1:04:18] mountains and The Valleys that we go
[1:04:20] through amen but he's already determined
[1:04:23] an out an outcome for our lives and then
[1:04:27] he put that potential within you ain't
[1:04:30] that right amen see amen it's the only
[1:04:33] way that you could have a new birth amen
[1:04:35] you you couldn't even have a new birth
[1:04:37] if there was not a predestinated seed
[1:04:39] within you amen for uh brother brandom
[1:04:42] said we did not become seed by the
[1:04:45] rebirth we were seed therefore were
[1:04:49] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:04:53] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:04:55] could be quickened in nonseed there is
[1:04:58] nothing to Quicken can you say Amen so
[1:05:01] if there's a seed there there that means
[1:05:04] there's potential there and if the Holy
[1:05:07] Ghost would just come across amen and
[1:05:10] Quicken that seed amen there's that
[1:05:13] potential potential amen everybody say
[1:05:16] I've got his
[1:05:17] potential amen I've got his potential
[1:05:20] now we we look there in Mark
[1:05:23] 334 Jesus said the
[1:05:26] Seth the word so the word is the seed
[1:05:31] that is sown ain't that right so it's
[1:05:34] not flesh and blood that God sold out
[1:05:37] into the world Amen but the word was
[1:05:41] sold amen by the spoken word god
[1:05:44] determined your path God determined your
[1:05:47] outcome God determined to save you God
[1:05:50] determined to fill you with the Holy
[1:05:52] Ghost God determined that you're going
[1:05:54] to come to him amen and and reign with
[1:05:57] him God's determined that you're going
[1:05:59] to overcome every situation God
[1:06:03] determined it and then he puts that seed
[1:06:06] that little word seed down inside of
[1:06:11] you now that that that seed the prophet
[1:06:14] goes on in the latter part of his his
[1:06:17] ministry uh uh and really just within
[1:06:20] the last few messages of his ministry he
[1:06:23] starts talking about the gene seed of
[1:06:25] God a genan seed that's that's what that
[1:06:28] was it's a genan seed of God not this
[1:06:30] old flesh but what that word seed that's
[1:06:33] in you is a jean seed of God that's why
[1:06:37] you have his potentials you have his
[1:06:40] potentials because it's not just god
[1:06:43] making you a church member God made you
[1:06:46] a son just like him with the same power
[1:06:50] the same attributes the same Holiness
[1:06:53] The Same Spirit every everything that
[1:06:56] God is now you have been made partakers
[1:06:59] of Amen you have his potentials so
[1:07:03] brother brandom said you are a part of
[1:07:05] God's Gene which makes you part of his
[1:07:08] word another place you are you're a gene
[1:07:11] a spiritual Gene out of your heavenly
[1:07:14] father a part of God's word can you say
[1:07:17] Amen another place he says when the word
[1:07:19] of God let our soul we become sons and
[1:07:25] daughters of God with the attributes see
[1:07:29] the gene of God in us see to be Sons and
[1:07:33] Daughters of the father God in heaven
[1:07:35] crying Abba Father we have gone from
[1:07:38] Mortal being time beings to Eternal
[1:07:42] beings something happened when that seed
[1:07:46] that was in you amen it quickened it was
[1:07:50] quickened by the Holy Ghost then all of
[1:07:53] a sudden you become no more a time being
[1:07:56] amen a mortal being you become an
[1:08:00] eternal being amen how could else could
[1:08:03] you be an eternal being except God put
[1:08:06] it in you when he placed that word seed
[1:08:10] down inside of your soul can you say
[1:08:13] amen amen amen what what contradictory
[1:08:17] we got a word seed that is eternal that
[1:08:19] speaks of Eternal things that speaks of
[1:08:21] a bright future that that that is the
[1:08:24] potential of being Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:26] God and and having the authority and
[1:08:29] reigning and yet in this life as
[1:08:32] Immortal beings amen we we are subject
[1:08:35] to sickness we're subject to
[1:08:37] discouragement we're subject Amen to to
[1:08:40] mind battles we're subject to failure
[1:08:42] we're subject to all of these things but
[1:08:44] the potential is there to rise above it
[1:08:48] all the
[1:08:51] potential so the genan seed that word
[1:08:54] seed has been quickened by the
[1:08:56] quickening power of
[1:08:58] God ain't that right so as the elect of
[1:09:05] God we have a word seed and that seed
[1:09:09] must come to its full potential it must
[1:09:13] come to its reality form ain't that
[1:09:15] right it's got to now that's our
[1:09:19] hope that's our hope we have a greater
[1:09:22] hope I hope you understand that this
[1:09:24] ain't getting work this ain't something
[1:09:26] that I just I hope I hope I hope man if
[1:09:30] we have that kind of a hope we might as
[1:09:32] well just go to a football game look at
[1:09:35] all them people they pay all that money
[1:09:38] they buy all the the the colors and the
[1:09:41] logo all of that they I mean you know
[1:09:43] they're a football fan you know what
[1:09:46] maybe a baseball fan but you know what
[1:09:47] team they're on and they'll pay whatever
[1:09:50] money to go I mean they they'll stay in
[1:09:52] a hotel they'll stay and they have no
[1:09:55] idea they have no no assurance that
[1:09:58] their team's going to
[1:10:00] win they spend all of that money and and
[1:10:03] and may go home defeated or whatever but
[1:10:07] that's the hope they have then you got
[1:10:09] people that are just fighting and
[1:10:10] fussing and so involved in politics and
[1:10:14] they there's nothing there that's going
[1:10:16] to change
[1:10:18] them all the promises are in
[1:10:22] vain do you believe that because there's
[1:10:25] no potential in politics not not for a
[1:10:28] change not for a bright
[1:10:32] future and it's true there's no
[1:10:35] potentials
[1:10:38] there just Humanity trying to fix
[1:10:40] Humanity it ain't going to work but down
[1:10:44] inside of that elect God put his
[1:10:48] potentials his
[1:10:52] potentials God ain't defeated he's a
[1:10:56] coner and he put that potential in
[1:10:59] you as I have overcome so you shall over
[1:11:03] overcome can you say
[1:11:06] amen he put that look when he when he
[1:11:10] when he spoke the word and he created
[1:11:13] this world by his spoken word he put
[1:11:15] that very potential inside of you and he
[1:11:18] says if you say to this mountain and
[1:11:21] doubt not and believe what you say you
[1:11:23] shall have what you say
[1:11:26] it's the potentials that are there
[1:11:28] that's
[1:11:29] right that's the
[1:11:32] truth the peace of God that passees all
[1:11:35] understanding he said my peace I leave
[1:11:37] with you he put you he gave you that
[1:11:40] potentials can you say
[1:11:42] Amen so every seed that that seed must
[1:11:46] come to its full
[1:11:48] potential full development now brother
[1:11:51] Brown said the seed planted in the right
[1:11:54] ground will produce anything everybody
[1:11:57] say anything that the seed represents
[1:12:02] right say that again the seed that is
[1:12:05] planted in the right
[1:12:07] ground now I want to say this God did
[1:12:10] not make mistake when he put a jean seed
[1:12:13] inside of
[1:12:15] you he wasn't guessing he saw you as a
[1:12:19] Believer he knew that you would want to
[1:12:22] be saved he knew that you would want to
[1:12:25] get the Holy Ghost he knew that you
[1:12:28] would strive with all that's within you
[1:12:30] as that Lily coming out of that mud of
[1:12:33] that pond and and all of that he was
[1:12:35] born defeated brother BR said we're all
[1:12:37] born defeated but there's something down
[1:12:39] inside of us that reaches out for full
[1:12:43] development God saw that he didn't make
[1:12:46] a mistake when he placed that seed in
[1:12:48] you he put it in the right
[1:12:51] ground prepared ground
[1:12:55] and the seed planted in the right ground
[1:12:57] will produce anything that the seed
[1:12:59] represents can you say amen he didn't
[1:13:02] put that kind of seed in in Cain amen
[1:13:05] that seed wouldn't have grown in Cain
[1:13:08] that's just facts that's why he did not
[1:13:11] predestinate by well I like this one and
[1:13:13] I don't like that one and I like this
[1:13:15] one he he he didn't predestinate that
[1:13:17] way he predestinated knowing amen he by
[1:13:20] his for knowledge he knew you would want
[1:13:23] it he knew that if ever given a chance
[1:13:26] you would give everything to it amen but
[1:13:28] Cain he knew that Cain wouldn't want it
[1:13:30] he even gave Cain that
[1:13:34] opportunity can you say
[1:13:36] Amen now in in the
[1:13:39] beginning uh there was seeds laying in
[1:13:42] the
[1:13:43] earth just laying dormant and then God
[1:13:46] would say let the Earth bring forth
[1:13:49] grass let the fruit tree yield forth
[1:13:52] after its kind let the herb yield seed
[1:13:56] after its kind let of the seeds that
[1:14:00] were laying there yield after its kind
[1:14:02] bring forth ain't that right not just
[1:14:05] bring forth the the tree come forth but
[1:14:07] let the the fruit come forth from that
[1:14:09] tree why it was already in that
[1:14:13] seed a ain't that right you plant the
[1:14:16] seed in the ground amen and by the law
[1:14:19] of God it's got to come forth It's got
[1:14:21] to come through development it's got to
[1:14:23] come through its trials and the wind and
[1:14:25] the storms and all that but the
[1:14:26] potential is in the seed you know that
[1:14:29] there's a fruit that's going to come
[1:14:31] forth it's there that's right so God
[1:14:35] planted them seeds and he and and and he
[1:14:38] wanted each of them to come to their
[1:14:40] full
[1:14:41] development ain't that right but why
[1:14:45] couldn't they do it at first the seeds
[1:14:47] were laying there am man but but why
[1:14:51] couldn't he do it why couldn't they come
[1:14:54] into full development well according to
[1:14:56] Genesis 1:2 water covered the
[1:14:58] Earth Darkness was upon the face of the
[1:15:01] deep can you say amen God put the the
[1:15:05] potential was there in that seat it was
[1:15:06] laying in there but there was the wrong
[1:15:10] atmosphere it could not come forth so
[1:15:14] God by his grace and mercy and his power
[1:15:18] he he didn't give up on his plan he
[1:15:21] didn't look at the
[1:15:22] impossibility amen and say well there
[1:15:24] ain't no Hope i' they've been laying
[1:15:26] there for whatever I don't know how long
[1:15:28] them seeds were laying there but God
[1:15:30] knew they were laying there and God had
[1:15:32] a plan for them laying there ain't that
[1:15:36] right and God by his sovereignty started
[1:15:40] to change things
[1:15:42] around the Bible says he said God said
[1:15:46] let there be light and there was
[1:15:48] light and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:15:51] the face of the waters and divided the
[1:15:54] waters so what was God doing he was
[1:15:57] changing the atmosphere so that the seed
[1:16:01] could grow and develop into its full
[1:16:05] potentials that God had had uh uh
[1:16:09] desired for it to do you see the
[1:16:11] atmosphere must be right do you believe
[1:16:14] that brother Bram said you can lay a
[1:16:16] seed out there in the ground and no
[1:16:18] matter how much that seed is gerti and
[1:16:21] layth there it's got to have an
[1:16:23] atmosphere everybody saying atmosphere
[1:16:26] to make it live do you believe that see
[1:16:30] the sun has to come to a certain power
[1:16:33] before bring it to a certain atmosphere
[1:16:35] see an egg has to have an atmosphere or
[1:16:38] it won't hatch no matter how fertile it
[1:16:41] is it's got to have an
[1:16:44] atmosphere
[1:16:46] amen yes sir I I I want to sit this way
[1:16:49] no matter how many youth camps you go to
[1:16:51] young people that's that's wonderful but
[1:16:54] you got stay under an
[1:16:57] atmosphere right you got to there's an
[1:17:00] atmosphere that we have to live
[1:17:03] inise the Lord that's right brother brah
[1:17:05] says any seed will bring forth of its
[1:17:07] kind if it's in the right condition the
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:10] atmosphere now we know that there are
[1:17:12] two atmospheres two kinds of atmospheres
[1:17:16] in the world that we can choose to live
[1:17:20] in right I want you to understand that
[1:17:23] we can choose to live
[1:17:26] in see we're fre free moral
[1:17:30] agents and everybody likes to likes that
[1:17:33] idea we're not like the robot that's
[1:17:36] that's got it computed within us NOP
[1:17:41] amen we have the choice amen and and to
[1:17:46] live in in to choose the atmospheres
[1:17:49] What atmosphere we want to live in but I
[1:17:52] can tell you this you cannot live in
[1:17:54] both atmospheres at the same
[1:17:58] time right you can't live in in the two
[1:18:03] atmosphere at same time why because the
[1:18:05] law of life and the law of death cannot
[1:18:08] work in the same atmosphere right
[1:18:10] there's either a an atmosphere for the
[1:18:12] law of of life and there's an atmosphere
[1:18:16] that works the law of death ain't that
[1:18:18] right in the Garden of Eden there were
[1:18:21] two atmospheres amen one was by God's
[1:18:24] word God spoke his word and man believed
[1:18:28] it and brother Bram said as long as he
[1:18:31] believed it he lived in the atmosphere
[1:18:34] of faith and he
[1:18:37] lived ain't that right the atmosphere of
[1:18:41] faith comes by the spoken word of God
[1:18:44] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:18:46] the word of God ain't that right so God
[1:18:49] would create the Atmosphere by speaking
[1:18:52] his word and as long as man believe
[1:18:54] believe that word he lived in an
[1:18:57] atmosphere of faith and he
[1:19:00] lived death could not come to
[1:19:04] him Satan come along and spoke his word
[1:19:07] of Deceit and when man believed that
[1:19:10] over God's word then he lived in an
[1:19:13] atmosphere of
[1:19:14] unbelief and he
[1:19:16] died the law of death took over in the
[1:19:19] atmosphere of
[1:19:21] unbelief can you say amen and if you
[1:19:24] know noticed every every Revival
[1:19:26] throughout the ages have died when
[1:19:28] unbelief set
[1:19:30] in because it it it it created an
[1:19:33] atmosphere and the word of God could not
[1:19:36] come forth in in in in in that in that
[1:19:39] church or or whatever every denomination
[1:19:42] church is
[1:19:44] dead can you say amen and it's it's not
[1:19:47] because they didn't hear the word it's
[1:19:49] not because whatever it's because they
[1:19:52] chose to disbelieve and to believe
[1:19:54] Satan's lie over the word of God and it
[1:19:58] killed
[1:20:01] it so when man come to live in the
[1:20:05] atmosphere of unbelief by believing
[1:20:07] Satan's lie aen he died and he never
[1:20:11] come to his full
[1:20:13] potential as a Son of God and we know
[1:20:17] that he forfeited the book he forfeited
[1:20:20] eternal life he forfeited his sunship he
[1:20:24] forfeited is right can you say amen
[1:20:27] that's right see now so uh uh he he he
[1:20:30] done this now now in order to believe
[1:20:33] Satan's word Satan's word which is none
[1:20:37] other than a lie Satan's word is a lie
[1:20:42] amen do you believe that can you say
[1:20:45] that with me Satan's word is a lie
[1:20:48] anything that's a lies coming from the
[1:20:49] devil for he's the father of Lies can
[1:20:53] you say Amen he's is the father of it
[1:20:55] meaning he's the author of Lies he
[1:20:58] inspires lies he inspires things that is
[1:21:01] not
[1:21:03] true it comes from him deception is a
[1:21:07] lie impersonation is a lie hypocrisy is
[1:21:10] a
[1:21:10] lie ain't that right see so God's word
[1:21:15] is the ultimate truth I know people get
[1:21:18] bothered when we say this message is the
[1:21:20] absolute it's the ultimate truth right
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:25] on you got to have an absolute and Truth
[1:21:28] should be our
[1:21:30] absolute can you say
[1:21:32] amen amen see so then to believe
[1:21:36] anything contrary to God's word is to
[1:21:39] believe a
[1:21:42] lie to believe a lie now you have to
[1:21:46] turn God's word down first before you
[1:21:49] can believe Satan's lie ain't that right
[1:21:53] now so so man believed Satan's lie and
[1:21:57] it brought him into an atmosphere of
[1:22:02] death he had the
[1:22:05] potential that's right of creating Sons
[1:22:07] just like himself speaking Sons into
[1:22:10] existence just like
[1:22:11] himself but he bypassed that he
[1:22:14] forfeited it because he come into an
[1:22:17] atmosphere of death it brought him into
[1:22:19] this atmosphere of death can you say
[1:22:22] Amen now notice brother Brown said where
[1:22:25] faith is preached from the word the
[1:22:26] children live you see why it's important
[1:22:29] to preach Faith why it's important to
[1:22:32] preach the promises why it's important
[1:22:34] to preach the things that God says about
[1:22:37] us we we can't preach by what we see in
[1:22:40] us we we can't that that we don't want
[1:22:43] you to believe in the things that that
[1:22:46] you see about
[1:22:48] yourself ex can't believe in your
[1:22:50] failures can't believe in your faults
[1:22:52] can't believe in your own potentials
[1:22:55] but where the word of God is preached
[1:22:58] faith comes from that word of God and
[1:23:00] the children
[1:23:02] live can you say Amen see so if you want
[1:23:06] to come to your full potential in God
[1:23:09] believe the word of God create that
[1:23:12] atmosphere of Faith the word of God is
[1:23:16] so important to
[1:23:22] us amen Hall if you want to live then
[1:23:25] believe the
[1:23:26] word if this church is to live We must
[1:23:29] believe the word if you want your home
[1:23:31] to survive you must believe the word hey
[1:23:35] homes are marriages are being attacked
[1:23:37] left and right homes are being attacked
[1:23:39] churches are believers are being
[1:23:41] attacked amen the attack is on every
[1:23:44] front but if you want to come to your
[1:23:46] potential believe God's word
[1:23:55] do you realize that God cannot heal you
[1:23:57] if the atmosphere isn't right for your
[1:24:00] healing I really want us to focus on
[1:24:03] that atmosphere tonight the atmosphere
[1:24:06] is important when you come to church
[1:24:07] don't sit there like a KN on a log
[1:24:10] create an
[1:24:11] atmosphere can you say amen amen if if
[1:24:14] we can especially as as we that believe
[1:24:17] that we're mature amen if we could
[1:24:19] discern amen that that our job is to
[1:24:22] create an atmosphere amen someone else
[1:24:25] might be going through a trial someone
[1:24:26] else might be sick somebody else might
[1:24:28] be whatever but if we can create the
[1:24:30] right atmosphere for God to break
[1:24:33] through amen and and and do his
[1:24:36] work and you sayen create the atmosphere
[1:24:40] God got to have the atmosphere see so we
[1:24:43] must have the atmosphere of Faith amen
[1:24:45] and and and believing brother Bram said
[1:24:48] that we're going to be healed we must
[1:24:50] have the atmosphere of Faith how are we
[1:24:52] going to have that by believing that
[1:24:54] we're going to be healed not saying well
[1:24:56] if I come up and pray for we'll see what
[1:24:57] happens you know well if if so and so
[1:24:59] will pray for me well you know I know
[1:25:01] some people don't like the pastor to
[1:25:03] pray for them and and so if certain
[1:25:05] evangelist can come you know I know I'll
[1:25:07] be healed that's not the right
[1:25:08] atmosphere amen you've got to come into
[1:25:11] the atmosphere that you believe the word
[1:25:13] of God Amen and you know that whatever
[1:25:17] God says I know I'm going to be healed
[1:25:19] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:25:20] they shall recover I know
[1:25:25] I know I'm going to be healed that's an
[1:25:27] atmosphere of
[1:25:29] Faith amen can you say man come to
[1:25:33] church expecting God to do
[1:25:35] something you got you got things that
[1:25:38] are bothering you come on expect God to
[1:25:41] do something for you to where you don't
[1:25:43] have to leave like that again you don't
[1:25:46] have to leave with doubt you don't have
[1:25:48] to leave with troubles you don't have to
[1:25:50] leave
[1:25:52] tormented can you say Amen
[1:25:55] but it isn't because you come to church
[1:25:56] it's because you created an
[1:25:59] atmosphere you can come to church and if
[1:26:01] there's no atmosphere then nothing
[1:26:05] happens an atmosphere of Faith you see
[1:26:07] brother Brown said God cannot move
[1:26:09] everybody say God cannot move oh we say
[1:26:11] oh God if you just move oh God if you
[1:26:13] just do it God cannot move until Faith
[1:26:17] Comes can you say Amen now we Jesus
[1:26:20] already told us amen that that there's
[1:26:23] four types of ground and one of them
[1:26:25] grounds is every time that God SWS the
[1:26:27] seed amen Satan comes alone and snatches
[1:26:30] it
[1:26:33] away now notice brother Braham said this
[1:26:36] has been Satan's trick since he worked
[1:26:38] it worked it first on Eve is just to
[1:26:41] disbelieve a little bit of the word
[1:26:43] that's right can you say Amen so then
[1:26:47] what we want to do is say God clean out
[1:26:49] all the channels amen Purge us from this
[1:26:52] unbelief Purge us from doubt purges from
[1:26:55] all of these things to where we can live
[1:26:57] in an atmosphere of Faith Can you say
[1:27:00] Amen it's
[1:27:02] true now every one of us as I said are
[1:27:05] free moral agents then being that we are
[1:27:09] free moral agents you know God made us
[1:27:12] to be amateur
[1:27:13] creators and the prophet told us that
[1:27:16] did not change because man since since
[1:27:19] because man fell amen man is still an
[1:27:23] amateur creat
[1:27:25] it's in your power everybody say it's in
[1:27:27] my power I know we we want to lean on
[1:27:30] government but we we're in an age that
[1:27:34] man everybody wants to blame their
[1:27:36] problems on somebody
[1:27:38] else everybody wants handouts everybody
[1:27:41] wants this and everybody wants that and
[1:27:43] everybody wants this you understand what
[1:27:44] I'm saying but it will never you'll
[1:27:46] never stand before God and say God I
[1:27:48] just didn't have a chance you didn't
[1:27:50] bless me enough how many how many's been
[1:27:52] blessed of God I all I can say is if God
[1:27:56] never blesses us again from this day
[1:27:59] forward he never answer your pray prayer
[1:28:01] he never gives you what you desire he
[1:28:03] never gives you nothing else anymore you
[1:28:06] are the Most Blessed people on the face
[1:28:07] of the Earth and you would never be able
[1:28:09] to come to God and say God you just
[1:28:11] didn't love me you just didn't offer it
[1:28:13] to me you just didn't give it to me no
[1:28:15] God has given it to us and he still
[1:28:17] gives it to us he still pours His
[1:28:19] blessings out but we have we are amateur
[1:28:23] creat
[1:28:25] creators
[1:28:27] right we are can you say Amen so being
[1:28:31] that we're amateur creators what did the
[1:28:33] prophet say we the one that create the
[1:28:37] atmosphere we got to create the
[1:28:41] atmosphere and sometimes sometimes we
[1:28:44] got to do like David did and said you
[1:28:46] know where he said I just encouraged
[1:28:48] myself in the Lord that's right create
[1:28:51] an
[1:28:52] atmosphere no there there might not be
[1:28:54] everybody patting you on the back and
[1:28:56] everybody comforting you and and every
[1:28:58] you might be just like job that have his
[1:29:00] comforters and they you know they come
[1:29:03] to comfort him and they were blaming
[1:29:07] him what an atmosphere but job would not
[1:29:11] succumb to them to that type of
[1:29:12] atmosphere he knew he had done
[1:29:15] everything according to what God
[1:29:17] required of
[1:29:20] him can you say Amen Lord so now we will
[1:29:24] either live in an atmosphere of life or
[1:29:27] we'll live in an atmosphere of
[1:29:29] death we will live or die by the kind of
[1:29:33] atmosphere we create can you say amen I
[1:29:37] know and and maybe this is a little
[1:29:39] different but I hope it helps you amen
[1:29:42] you know uh uh you know we can say well
[1:29:44] I'm predestinated you know it's kind of
[1:29:46] like what brother brandham said you know
[1:29:48] so well you know if I'm predestinated
[1:29:50] then you know what's the use of trying
[1:29:52] or you know I I can just live any way
[1:29:54] you know he said well it just shows that
[1:29:56] you you ain't got it yet you understand
[1:29:59] what I'm saying there's something you
[1:30:01] know well it doesn't the Bible say it is
[1:30:04] God which worketh both in you to Will
[1:30:08] and to do according to his good pleasure
[1:30:12] it's God which worketh in you both to
[1:30:14] Will and to do according to his good
[1:30:18] pleasure can you say Amen so so then you
[1:30:22] know we we we have to be REM minded of
[1:30:24] these things because Satan comes on
[1:30:26] every front and and to be honest we're
[1:30:28] living in such an age of
[1:30:31] negativity everybody is complaining
[1:30:33] Everybody Talks negative everybody it it
[1:30:37] just seems everywhere you go somebody's
[1:30:40] complaining about
[1:30:43] something and that Spirit can get on
[1:30:47] us to where we just have this woe is me
[1:30:50] and and I just don't know and if we
[1:30:52] don't you understand what I'm saying and
[1:30:54] I understand a lot of times we can't see
[1:30:56] the outcome of things but we take God at
[1:30:59] his word and we refuse to come in the
[1:31:02] atmosphere of
[1:31:09] unbelief yes that's right you love the
[1:31:11] Lord amen now for us we have the power
[1:31:15] to
[1:31:17] create
[1:31:19] yes either
[1:31:22] atmosphere amen
[1:31:24] because the word has been restored to us
[1:31:28] yes we were
[1:31:30] born uh
[1:31:32] defeated yes we come speak into this
[1:31:35] world speaking lies carnal nature yada
[1:31:38] yada but you don't have to stay that
[1:31:42] way amen our future is
[1:31:51] bright Hallelujah because the word has
[1:31:54] been
[1:31:55] restored therefore the seed of God that
[1:31:57] is within us can fully develop in what
[1:31:59] God has ordained and you say
[1:32:03] amen I won't take much longer but I do
[1:32:06] want to say this be cautious of the
[1:32:07] atmosphere you
[1:32:11] create be cautious of the the atmosphere
[1:32:14] you create because it will not only
[1:32:17] affect you but it will affect all of
[1:32:19] those who come under your
[1:32:22] influence can you say amen amen now
[1:32:26] church if you know we talk about winning
[1:32:28] soap we talk about all that well first
[1:32:30] of all get the right atmosphere because
[1:32:32] when people come under your atmosphere
[1:32:35] you're either going to kill them destroy
[1:32:37] them uh uh uh uh well you you can stump
[1:32:43] the growth you can you can limit their
[1:32:45] faith into healing
[1:32:54] or you can bring in into an atmosphere
[1:32:57] where they blossom in God to where they
[1:32:59] become stronger in the promises of God
[1:33:01] believing the promises of God can you
[1:33:04] say Amen see so so now now notice
[1:33:07] brother Brown said you get an atmosphere
[1:33:09] where people are disbelieving fussing
[1:33:11] and stewing among one another arguing
[1:33:13] about whether they belong to this church
[1:33:14] or that you'll never hatch out
[1:33:17] Christians you'll hatch out church
[1:33:19] members but not Christians because a
[1:33:21] Christian is born under the right
[1:33:23] atmosphere a Christian develops under a
[1:33:26] right
[1:33:28] atmosphere can you say
[1:33:30] amen that's right we we got to have this
[1:33:32] right
[1:33:35] atmosphere
[1:33:37] true and that's what makes a church
[1:33:40] sterl that's what makes our own life
[1:33:42] sterl sometimes is if we're living in
[1:33:45] the wrong atmosphere we're we're
[1:33:47] radiating an atmosphere see so now our
[1:33:50] home our our home now church it's not
[1:33:53] only important to have an atmosphere in
[1:33:55] the
[1:33:56] church you you got to have an atmosphere
[1:33:59] in the
[1:34:01] home that's it's so important yes sir
[1:34:06] because Satan just does not fight us
[1:34:08] just in church he fights us on every
[1:34:11] front he fights us at
[1:34:14] home that's true can you say Amen so if
[1:34:18] we're not careful we have the Rome
[1:34:20] atmosphere in it in the home worrying
[1:34:23] come complaining yeah being nervous
[1:34:26] talking defeat entertaining things that
[1:34:29] we should not entertain watching things
[1:34:32] listening to things that we should not
[1:34:34] be uh uh doing see and so therefore we
[1:34:39] ought to really really really watch the
[1:34:43] atmosphere that we're creating
[1:34:46] amen that's
[1:34:49] right I pray that God helps me to be an
[1:34:51] at be a blessing to my wife you know I
[1:34:55] and my children
[1:34:57] amen why well how can you do that I mean
[1:34:59] you know yeah we're we're husband and
[1:35:01] wife so blessing her with what you
[1:35:04] know
[1:35:06] uh a kitchen set or a blessing her with
[1:35:10] this blessing her with that no them them
[1:35:13] are fine and I think we should show our
[1:35:16] love in in expressing and we all got
[1:35:18] different ways of expressing
[1:35:20] things but to be a blessing we're
[1:35:22] talking about spiritual
[1:35:24] here is to where I I want my wife to
[1:35:27] prosper in God I want my children to
[1:35:30] prosper in God I want you to prosper in
[1:35:33] God are you with me now I I I know that
[1:35:38] that that you know you husbands when you
[1:35:41] go out to work you you you you might be
[1:35:43] got your mind on the job and all that
[1:35:45] well Satan's over there entertaining
[1:35:47] your wife and entertaining things at at
[1:35:50] at the
[1:35:51] home and then we come home we're Gra
[1:35:53] we're just this we're just that and
[1:35:55] we're you understand what I'm saying or
[1:35:57] we're listening to things that we
[1:35:58] shouldn't be we're on on the internet
[1:36:01] constantly and and and Satan is is
[1:36:03] Ravishing maybe your children's mind
[1:36:06] your wife's mind or whatever and we
[1:36:08] might think well well what about me well
[1:36:11] sometimes if we're are the leader we've
[1:36:13] got to stand at the post of Duty and
[1:36:16] remember it's our job to create an
[1:36:19] atmosphere in that
[1:36:21] home we got to create the atmosphere
[1:36:24] you Mama's got to do that yourself with
[1:36:26] your
[1:36:28] children but it's creating an atmosphere
[1:36:31] can you say Amen now brother Ram talks
[1:36:34] about it he says sometimes when I'm in
[1:36:36] the home and the wife people in and out
[1:36:39] and just going all the time I'd go in
[1:36:41] and stand wife standing there wiping her

[1:37:55] that atmosphere that was already going
[1:37:58] you know and sometime hey I'm guilty I
[1:38:00] think I think we could all raise our
[1:38:01] hands at one point or another and say we
[1:38:03] know how to push
[1:38:04] buttons we know how to feed the
[1:38:08] atmosphere you know and and and and and
[1:38:11] so but but here brother brandom is
[1:38:13] showing us that that if we could
[1:38:15] recognize that it's not just it's not
[1:38:18] the wife just just going haywire it's
[1:38:20] it's not just the children need to shut
[1:38:22] up Satan is
[1:38:26] working and he's trying to create an
[1:38:28] atmosphere to bring

[1:47:22] the church we see it in its condition
[1:47:24] everything is happening falling all the
[1:47:27] Pu the the pieces of the puzzle is
[1:47:30] coming together and we know the Rapture
[1:47:32] can happen any
[1:47:35] moment any moment
[1:47:40] [Music]
[1:47:43] now can I ask you this what has brought
[1:47:48] it to this condition what's brought it
[1:47:50] the world and all of that to the end
[1:47:52] time what
[1:47:53] where are we at why well brother
[1:47:56] brandham lets us know
[1:47:58] why he says it's the
[1:48:00] atmosphere the people have created the
[1:48:03] right kind of Atmosphere for
[1:48:06] it he said see the atmosphere is charged
[1:48:09] up for an atomic bomb for judgment it's
[1:48:13] the atmosphere Russia would have
[1:48:15] couldn't have do it until the atmosphere
[1:48:17] was right right brother Terry but the
[1:48:19] atmosphere is
[1:48:21] right look at the world today look at
[1:48:23] the situation we're a Godless Nation
[1:48:26] it's a Godless
[1:48:29] world the atmosphere is
[1:48:33] right but he said the church is getting
[1:48:35] ready for a Rapture we're waiting
[1:48:38] anticipation
[1:48:40] waiting we ain't got our head wrapped up
[1:48:42] in politics ain't got our head wrapped
[1:48:44] up in materialistic things we're
[1:48:46] creating an atmosphere for him to
[1:48:50] come Hallelujah the church is waiting
[1:48:53] for the coming of the Lord he said we
[1:48:55] cannot have the last day until the
[1:48:57] people gets in the spirit of the last
[1:48:59] day he said just like we can't have a
[1:49:01] healing service until people gets in the
[1:49:03] spirit of healing service cannot have a
[1:49:05] feeling of the Holy Ghost until people
[1:49:07] gets in that kind of atmosphere see well
[1:49:10] the people was in the atmosphere in that
[1:49:13] day speaking of Noah and lot see in that
[1:49:16] day to bring judgment upon the Earth and
[1:49:18] they're in the same atmosphere today
[1:49:21] eating drinking marrying and given in
[1:49:23] marriage and all this thing kind of
[1:49:25] thing like that and the glory of God is
[1:49:27] being preached and demonstrated in the
[1:49:29] power of the Holy Ghost setting forth an
[1:49:31] example of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:49:32] Christ that's going to take the church
[1:49:34] into Glory just as sure as I'm just as
[1:49:36] certain as I'm standing here and men are
[1:49:40] ignoring it paying no attention to it
[1:49:43] and walking away from it because they're
[1:49:46] in the spirit of the last days but the
[1:49:48] world's got to get like this God would
[1:49:50] be unjust to pour His wrath out upon
[1:49:52] just people they've ignored him and
[1:49:55] walked away and Satan's captured them
[1:49:57] and there they're standing in that time
[1:50:00] and here we are
[1:50:03] today but church just as much as they're
[1:50:06] getting in an atmosphere they're
[1:50:08] creating an
[1:50:09] atmosphere now you know that's true you
[1:50:11] know it it's so hard to witness to
[1:50:14] people anymore to get them to believe
[1:50:16] the reality of this message because
[1:50:18] there's such an atmosphere of unbelief
[1:50:20] there's such an atmosphere of religion
[1:50:23] that's hard to penetrate the soul
[1:50:26] anymore and give them the truth of the
[1:50:28] message of this hour can you
[1:50:31] sayen it seemed like politicians it
[1:50:34] seems like doctors it seemed like the
[1:50:36] media it seems like all of this this
[1:50:38] this voices has more effect upon the
[1:50:40] people than the gospel of
[1:50:43] today why because they're in that kind
[1:50:46] of
[1:50:47] atmosphere but brothers and sisters we
[1:50:50] are living in an atmosphere where the
[1:50:52] word of God has more effect than the
[1:50:53] news media than a politician than than
[1:50:56] anything else we're in an atmosphere for
[1:50:58] the word of God to penetrate our soul do
[1:51:02] you believe that oh my can you lift your
[1:51:06] hands unto the Lord and worship
[1:51:09] him oh God we love
[1:51:13] you we love you father we love you
[1:51:17] Lord may we create that atmosphere
[1:51:21] Lord may we never disbelieve your

[1:51:28] doubts oh
[1:51:31] God hallelujah help us
[1:51:34] father oh bless this people bless the
[1:51:37] church

[1:51:42] father but Lord we know that you're with
[1:51:45] us we know Lord may we not give in to
[1:51:48] despair may we not give in to worry may
[1:51:51] we not give in to nervous and
[1:51:53] anxiety may we not give in to unbelief
[1:51:57] Lord hallelujah it may seem like things
[1:52:00] are getting worse out in the world and
[1:52:02] in our homes or whatever it may be but
[1:52:06] Lord may we create that
[1:52:09] atmosphere and just stand upon your
