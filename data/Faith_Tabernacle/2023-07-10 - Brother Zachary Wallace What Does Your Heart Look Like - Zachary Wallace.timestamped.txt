[30:14] it is
[30:16] beyond measure
[30:19] it's beyond
[30:20] in the expression of value or worth
[30:24] without it
[30:26] we would be lost
[30:30] to ask you if you'd have your Bibles
[30:32] tonight we'll just get right in
[30:34] and
[30:37] try not to hold you
[30:39] too long tonight
[30:41] but uh
[30:44] I sure appreciate how you pulled on the
[30:47] word this morning I had a good time
[30:50] and just enjoyed the presence of the
[30:53] Lord here but uh
[30:56] tomorrow I'm getting on a flight heading
[30:58] to Czech Republic for a youth camp there
[31:03] and so my uh I focus on a group of young
[31:06] people there that's 13 and under and so
[31:11] you you kind of have to
[31:13] think about the gospel in in simpler
[31:16] ways which for me just blesses me and if
[31:19] so you'll have to put up with me tonight
[31:21] I'm just gonna kind of give you a Sunday
[31:23] school lesson and uh
[31:26] it's simple but if you pay attention you
[31:29] can find God in Simplicity and we'll
[31:31] just
[31:32] we'll just ask that
[31:34] Lord can deal with our hearts in that
[31:37] but in Matthew the fifth chapter
[31:40] and verse 8 Matthew 5 and 8.
[31:45] the scripture says blessed
[31:49] are the pure in heart
[31:52] for they shall see God
[31:55] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[31:58] shall see God now
[32:01] how are you going to get a pure heart
[32:04] what are you going to do what efforts
[32:06] are you going to put in to get a pure
[32:07] heart
[32:08] there's nothing that you can produce
[32:10] that will give you a pure heart but
[32:12] there is a blood
[32:14] and it's enough to make the vile a
[32:17] sinner clean
[32:19] blessed are the pure and heart for they
[32:21] shall see God and now over in
[32:23] Revelations the third chapter
[32:25] we'll go to the address to the laodicean
[32:26] age there
[32:28] verse 20.
[32:30] Revelations 3 and 20.
[32:41] it says behold I stand at the door and
[32:44] knock
[32:45] If any man hear my voice and open the
[32:48] door I will come into him and will sup
[32:51] with him
[32:52] and he with me
[32:54] I just want to ask the question for my
[32:56] title tonight what does your heart look
[32:59] like
[33:01] let's go to the Lord and Lord of Prayer
[33:04] dear Lord Jesus
[33:06] we thank you for
[33:07] your goodness to us and for your
[33:10] presence here Among Us Lord I just ask
[33:12] Lord that you would come down and
[33:14] through the foolishness of preaching
[33:15] that you would say something that would
[33:17] help one of your children here tonight
[33:19] Lord I just ask that you would have
[33:22] Liberty in this service and that we
[33:24] would understand a little clearer Lord
[33:27] we would see a little better Lord how
[33:29] you would want us to live and how we
[33:32] should approach you father I just ask
[33:34] that you'd have your way now in Jesus
[33:36] Christ's name amen
[33:38] may be seated tonight
[33:42] so my question is is what does your
[33:45] heart look like and you're all familiar
[33:48] with this this statement of a knocking
[33:52] on the door
[33:53] I'm sure I'm sure you've all listened to
[33:56] door to the heart or doors and door many
[33:59] different times and so we're going to be
[34:02] looking at some of those thoughts right
[34:03] there but when you look at the human
[34:06] heart and you see this human heart they
[34:08] have a picture of Jesus drawn where he's
[34:10] knocking on the door and he's holding a
[34:13] lantern and he's he's waiting to get in
[34:15] and and they took it to the hall of
[34:17] critics and they were looking over the
[34:18] picture and they says you know you spent
[34:20] these years your life drawing this
[34:21] painting and it's a it's a wonderful
[34:23] picture it's a beautiful painting but
[34:25] you you really made a big mistake with
[34:26] your picture of Jesus coming to the
[34:28] human heart and he says well what did I
[34:31] miss and they said well you forgot to
[34:32] put a handle on the door
[34:34] he said oh no I didn't he says the
[34:37] handle is not on the outside the handle
[34:40] is on the inside and it's the individual
[34:42] alone that can open that door up and let
[34:45] the Lord Jesus Christ in them
[34:48] and so
[34:49] you know there's there's many different
[34:51] people I was just talking to a group of
[34:54] 10 year olds about people knocking on
[34:56] your door and I said well who's a
[34:57] popular YouTube person that would be
[34:59] knocking on your door and and they were
[35:01] mentioning uh Mark Rober they mentioned
[35:04] uh Mr Beast they mentioned
[35:07] I can't remember some of the other names
[35:09] they're like I says if these people
[35:12] these popular UT people were knocking on
[35:14] your door you know would you open the
[35:15] door they're like yeah yeah you know a
[35:17] lot of times they give away money to
[35:19] people and stuff and so they were all
[35:20] excited about you know what if this
[35:22] person was knocking on their door you
[35:23] know and and I said you know what about
[35:25] maybe some some famous or wealthy people
[35:27] like and they're like yeah like uh
[35:30] what's some wealthy people can you help
[35:32] me here
[35:34] Trump's wealthy Rockefeller and he did I
[35:36] think if he's knocking on my door I'm
[35:38] nervous no
[35:40] um uh Elon Musk yeah yeah uh what's
[35:43] somebody else that's uh real wealthy
[35:44] right now
[35:46] Hudson
[35:49] Joe Biden hi maybe
[35:52] um
[35:53] he's more on the famous side than the
[35:55] wealthy side I think but uh you know if
[35:58] you had one of those people knocking on
[35:59] your door and you look out and you
[36:01] recognize this is some you know
[36:03] multi-billionaire you might be
[36:05] interested in opening the door you'd
[36:08] look out and it would definitely catch
[36:10] your attention
[36:11] and uh so I was asking maybe you know
[36:13] some famous people some powerful people
[36:15] most of the the famous people to these
[36:17] these young people were uh were social
[36:20] media influencers things like that
[36:21] that's what they consider to be famous
[36:24] um powerful people I would think of
[36:26] would be you know leaders of Nations and
[36:29] things like that and if you had you know
[36:31] the the governor or the the leader of
[36:33] our nation or or someone that was real
[36:35] well-known real powerful person and they
[36:38] were knocking on your door there would
[36:40] be a lot of interest and you would want
[36:42] to open the door to find out what
[36:44] they're doing there Ruth if the
[36:46] president came and knocked on your door
[36:48] would you be interested to know why he
[36:50] was there
[36:51] yeah me too
[36:54] you know the I found out the Queen of
[36:56] England was dead but if the Queen of
[36:59] England was knocking on your door
[37:01] um you know I was kind of interested to
[37:03] find out that that was the same queen
[37:04] that brother Branham would have been
[37:05] talking about when he says what if she
[37:07] come through and visited your home it's
[37:08] like she lived a long time you know but
[37:10] uh you know if someone like that came
[37:13] and visited your home how would you
[37:15] treat them what would you do if they
[37:17] were knocking at that door
[37:19] and all of them were saying well I'd
[37:21] open the door and find out what they
[37:23] were wanting to do or find out what they
[37:26] were there for
[37:27] and
[37:29] you know that's that's how we would
[37:31] treat somebody that was of Earthly value
[37:34] but the person who comes of the greatest
[37:36] value
[37:37] the greatest importance with the
[37:39] greatest gifts to bring is the Lord
[37:41] Jesus Christ and he's turned away again
[37:44] and again and again
[37:47] they don't got time for him they can't
[37:49] be bothered with what he has to offer
[37:52] and yet there'd be no one greater that
[37:54] would knock at that door
[37:56] and you know we look at the we look at
[37:59] the human heart and it's a place that
[38:02] has many different compartments many
[38:04] different doors so when you go through
[38:06] the front door Ruth you step into the
[38:08] house and after the first door
[38:11] you're on the you're on the welcoming
[38:13] mat and after that right over here is
[38:15] another door and another door and
[38:17] another door there's different areas in
[38:19] that human heart
[38:20] and if if we were invited you know
[38:23] brother Josiah invited us over to his
[38:24] home last night and we stayed the night
[38:26] there and you know if we'd have walked
[38:27] in the door and we we come in and we
[38:29] step through the bees not the front door
[38:31] it's the side door because the front
[38:33] door don't get used and we step in the
[38:34] side door he says oh so good to have you
[38:36] just I'm really happy to see you here
[38:39] you know Welcome to our home and we say
[38:40] thank you thank you and we wipe our feet
[38:42] off on the floor mat and we take a step
[38:44] he said what are you doing
[38:45] no I feel like I I was just gonna go
[38:48] over there he's like no I didn't say you
[38:49] could go there it's like oh
[38:51] okay you know
[38:54] um so you know I go over here to the to
[38:56] the side of the room and he's like get
[38:57] back on that mat
[38:59] like okay
[39:01] you know it wouldn't take me very long
[39:03] to head back out that door
[39:07] because
[39:08] he doesn't really want me there
[39:13] he didn't really make me welcome
[39:16] he said oh yeah come on over called me
[39:18] up you know and I drove a long ways and
[39:20] I finally got there and then all he
[39:22] wanted me to do was to stand at the door
[39:25] I'd go somewhere else I'd find somewhere
[39:27] where I could actually be comfortable
[39:31] I'd find somewhere where I would really
[39:33] be welcome
[39:36] and we all say Lord Jesus come come to
[39:39] my heart come to my home
[39:42] but is he welcome
[39:47] is he welcome in your private life is he
[39:50] welcome in every little section of your
[39:52] heart
[39:53] or is he just welcome to step in the
[39:56] front door and and come and save you
[39:58] from hell because that's all you really
[39:59] care about
[40:00] now for for uh for myself and for the
[40:04] young people I I made up a
[40:06] a nice big heart here
[40:09] and uh
[40:11] I've got it all sectioned off in these
[40:13] different areas of the human heart
[40:17] and
[40:19] I've got some residents for the heart
[40:21] here
[40:22] all right
[40:23] now when you come to this world
[40:26] you are born in sin you're shaped in
[40:29] iniquity you come to the world speaking
[40:31] lies
[40:32] and your heart is not a very good place
[40:35] and so we're going to put a nice big
[40:38] thing of unbelief in there all right
[40:42] and his compatriot of doubt
[40:45] so there we are
[40:47] now that heart isn't looking very good
[40:49] is it
[40:50] and you know what you were just born
[40:52] and that's where you start out at
[40:55] all right
[40:56] you I don't care who you are I don't
[41:00] care how long you've been alive if
[41:01] you've been alive for 60 seconds you
[41:03] came a counterfeit way a counterfeit's
[41:05] condemned to start with
[41:07] and so this person is condemned from the
[41:10] very start
[41:11] which is why Jesus Christ paid a price
[41:14] to redeem the entire world but
[41:19] when you come to Earth you've got these
[41:21] different compartments
[41:22] and so brother Amos we're going to put
[41:24] this in your private life
[41:27] what's some little roach that might slip
[41:29] into that private life
[41:32] you go ahead think about it what is it
[41:35] give it a name the kids wanted to name
[41:37] it Jerry we're not naming it Jerry all
[41:39] right
[41:39] what is this internet yeah yeah all
[41:43] right your internet history there we go
[41:46] slips in there nobody else knows about
[41:48] it but you do
[41:50] uh what's something else we might put
[41:52] over here
[41:53] in uh in the human heart just give it a
[41:56] name shalom
[41:58] something that's not good slips into the
[42:00] human heart it's a sin
[42:02] jealousy all right we'll slide that in
[42:06] here
[42:07] I got a lot of these so keep thinking
[42:09] Hudson
[42:10] hatred oh yeah
[42:12] you know this guy here he slips in and
[42:15] you know
[42:16] these are little cockroaches
[42:18] and they don't need much of a gap
[42:21] they don't need a great big Open Door
[42:22] they'll just find a little crevice and
[42:25] they slip in and once one gets in there
[42:27] next thing you know there's two next
[42:28] thing you know there's ten next thing
[42:30] you know there's hundreds of them
[42:33] because there was just enough of an

[46:03] we'll put this guy over here this guy
[46:05] over here
[46:06] put this right here all right
[46:09] we got everything Plum contaminated
[46:13] all right
[46:16] born in sin shaped iniquity come to the
[46:18] world speaking lies and on the outside
[46:21] you look pretty good
[46:25] this is the inside
[46:27] you know God doesn't
[46:31] see the way we see
[46:33] we'll look at uh
[46:36] see Matthew right
[46:38] yes come on up here and no no your your
[46:41] mark this is Mark okay you're Matthew
[46:43] then all right Matthew Mark Matthew Mark
[46:46] is there Luke in here
[46:48] all right bro Branson come here all
[46:50] right
[46:51] so one day God was looking for a man
[46:54] that he could use in his kingdom
[46:56] and the prophet came and he called
[46:59] Jesse's Sons together and he came to him
[47:02] and he grabbed he grabbed the anointing
[47:04] oil and he came over and he was looking
[47:06] for somebody that God could use to lead
[47:09] his people he brought that anointing oil
[47:11] and he looked at the first one alive he
[47:13] says surely this is the one I mean just
[47:15] look at him he's he's a man that's just
[47:17] incredible and he went to pour the oil
[47:19] and God says I have not chosen him he
[47:23] says do not look on his appearance
[47:28] says for God
[47:30] looks at the heart
[47:33] and she says no that's not the one he
[47:35] went to the next one and he was ready to
[47:37] pour the oil on him God says no that's
[47:39] not the one went to the next one he says
[47:41] no that's not the one and he gets to the
[47:43] end of his seven sons
[47:46] he's like God told me there was a boy
[47:48] here that was going to be Anointed with
[47:50] oil so what's you know what gives
[47:53] he says you wouldn't happen to have
[47:54] another boy he's like oh I got a little
[47:56] guy out in the field taking care of some
[47:57] sheep he's like his name was David David
[48:01] can you come up here
[48:03] is that okay
[48:05] all right that's all right we can grab
[48:07] this little guy right here and so they
[48:09] go out and they get David taking care of
[48:10] the Sheep
[48:12] and God says that is the man that is
[48:14] after my own heart
[48:16] he says
[48:18] you know these guys they might be big
[48:19] they might be strong you know if we were
[48:21] going to have an arm wrestling match
[48:22] this guy probably wouldn't win
[48:27] but God chose this one why
[48:30] the heart
[48:31] it's the heart that God looks at not the
[48:35] outward appearance and so many times
[48:37] though we'll look at the outward
[48:38] appearance and we'll say well this is
[48:40] how it looks you know they look great
[48:42] things are looking good
[48:43] but the heart
[48:46] what's that heart look like
[48:48] what does your heart look like tonight
[48:50] does it got that little bug of
[48:52] backbiting in there
[48:54] putting things before God
[48:59] doesn't see how nice you look how
[49:02] well-dressed you are
[49:03] how strong and muscular you might be
[49:05] that's not what God's saying
[49:08] people they might look at it and they
[49:09] say if I was going to pick who was going
[49:11] to be the military leaders of our nation
[49:13] I probably wouldn't pick that kid
[49:16] but that's not how God looks at things
[49:19] thanks guys
[49:21] God looks at the heart
[49:25] the scripture I need to read that
[49:27] directly it's really powerful because
[49:29] then the Lord said unto Samuel
[49:32] how long will you he says go to Jesse's
[49:34] house right right
[49:36] um
[49:37] live comes up he says but in first
[49:40] Samuel 16 verse 7. he says but the Lord
[49:45] said unto him Samuel look not on his
[49:47] countenance or on the height of his
[49:50] stature because I have refused him for
[49:52] the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man
[49:56] looketh on the outward appearance but
[49:58] the Lord looketh on the heart
[50:01] and so right now in this building I'm
[50:04] looking at you at the outward appearance
[50:05] God is looking at your heart
[50:08] he sees that little bitterness that's
[50:10] down in there he sees that little thing
[50:13] that nobody else might see in your
[50:15] private life but he sees it because he
[50:17] sees the heart
[50:19] and
[50:23] you know right now
[50:25] the scripture says to repent and be
[50:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[50:30] the remission of your sins and you shall
[50:32] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[50:36] so I've drawn out me here a little Dove
[50:38] okay somebody else did I'm not much of
[50:40] an artist but
[50:41] here's this little Dove of the Holy
[50:43] Spirit
[50:45] do you think this is a welcoming place
[50:50] you think this devil the holy spirit's
[50:51] gonna be able to come down and build its
[50:53] nest in that heart
[50:55] absolutely not
[50:57] it's incompatible
[51:01] now
[51:02] there's not one thing you can do
[51:05] to take that unbelief that doubt to take
[51:07] that sin and wash your heart out
[51:10] there's nothing you can do
[51:12] you can't do it that's right but there
[51:15] is a toxin there is a blood
[51:19] that can take and cleanse out that heart
[51:21] but if we if we ask the Lord to come in
[51:24] we come to the Lord we say God I have
[51:27] need of you I need you in my heart so
[51:30] Levi we welcome them in we say God I
[51:32] need you and so he comes down and he he
[51:35] comes through the door and he we ask him
[51:38] to forgive us and he cleans those areas
[51:40] out
[51:42] and that's wonderful that's a wonderful
[51:44] start
[51:45] you know we'll compare this to like
[51:47] justification we get Justified We
[51:49] Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as our
[51:51] savior that's wonderful you've accepted
[51:53] him as your savior but there's a lot of
[51:55] other areas in your life
[51:58] that need dealt with
[52:01] and you are the one
[52:03] that opens the door
[52:05] he does not force his way in
[52:07] he is a gentleman if you tell him he
[52:10] can't go in there he won't go in there
[52:12] you have to open up that door and say
[52:16] God I want you to come in to this area
[52:18] of my life I want you to enter in here I
[52:21] want to make you welcome
[52:23] now one of the first doors in that heart
[52:26] is the door of pride
[52:31] you know that's a door that some people
[52:33] never will let the Lord Jesus Christ in
[52:36] that door of Pride will be there and
[52:39] they'll say that's mine you're not going
[52:40] to Humble me you're not going to
[52:41] humiliate me I'm going to do this I'm
[52:43] going to look good I'm gonna
[52:46] he won't Force his way in
[52:50] that door of Pride Abraham says you know
[52:53] some of them ladies with that Pride they
[52:54] say now look I'm I'm going down here now
[52:56] Jesus Is My Savior all right but when he
[52:58] tells me how I'm going to dress you keep
[53:01] out of that room but you see he's got to
[53:03] be Lord over your dressing too
[53:05] now if it's going to interfere with me
[53:07] wearing shorts I don't want nothing to
[53:09] do with that kind of a religion see you
[53:10] don't want to open that door of Pride
[53:12] you're all stuck up if I can't wear wear
[53:15] lipstick or stuff on put that on my face
[53:17] if I can't wear that well then I'll
[53:20] go on to show how you are not letting
[53:22] him be the Lord of your heart
[53:25] he's come in and you're saying God I
[53:28] want you as my savior
[53:29] but you don't want to miss your lord
[53:32] now friends this isn't something that
[53:35] just happens
[53:36] one time you can be serving God for 20
[53:39] years
[53:41] and then close the door
[53:49] you see
[53:51] he's got to come in completely he's got
[53:54] to be welcomed in every door thrown wide
[53:58] every portion of that heart emptied out
[54:01] if you want him
[54:03] to dwell there if you want him to truly
[54:06] be your lord
[54:08] it's not going to look like this
[54:10] and so
[54:12] we're going to open up this this door of
[54:15] of
[54:17] Pride here
[54:19] cut that open
[54:21] we open it up and we let him come in and
[54:23] clean out something
[54:25] and that's wonderful now we're kind of
[54:26] looking at more of a sanctification as
[54:28] we open up each individual part of our
[54:31] life and part of our heart and we let
[54:33] him come in and begin to do that work
[54:34] that that only he can do
[54:37] cutting out these these barriers
[54:40] I I wasn't sure how to make all kinds of
[54:42] doors so I just put barriers
[54:45] and as he's welcomed in
[54:47] he cleans out those areas but if you'll
[54:49] ever stop
[54:50] and just say that's enough
[54:53] that's where it'll stop
[54:55] and he will never
[54:57] make his Abode there
[54:59] he can't do it he is a holy spirit he
[55:02] will not feel an Unholy vessel but if
[55:06] you'll just cut open every area of your
[55:08] heart you'll just open up he'll come in
[55:10] and he'll begin to clean out all of that
[55:12] Pride he'll begin to take out all that
[55:13] indifference he'll be able to take out
[55:15] that that back biting and that gossip
[55:18] he'll begin to take out those things
[55:19] that are there that just would would
[55:21] tear apart your life he'll take that
[55:23] unbelief and that doubt and he'll
[55:25] eradicate it out of your heart and it'll
[55:27] be pulsating with faith
[55:29] take away that lying spirit
[55:32] that's stealing
[55:35] that stealing of God's time
[55:38] where God's not put first
[55:41] beginning to tear down those Idols of
[55:43] the heart and it's getting cleaned out
[55:45] and it's looking good friends
[55:48] that looking a lot better
[55:49] oh it's looking a lot better
[55:53] still that private life
[55:55] and there's still things in that private
[55:57] life we've got some bitterness and we
[55:59] got some jealousy
[56:02] until those are dealt with
[56:05] he's still not welcome
[56:07] until every area until every aspect of
[56:12] our life has been opened up and he comes
[56:15] in as Lord of your heart as Lord of your
[56:18] life
[56:20] he's not welcome
[56:22] but if you'll really just completely
[56:24] yield and you'll die out to yourself
[56:27] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is a
[56:30] representation
[56:31] of death amen you have died out and you
[56:35] have been born again in a new life with
[56:37] a cleaned out heart now we've got a
[56:40] place
[56:42] where the Lord Jesus Christ can be
[56:44] welcomed and when that heart
[56:46] is well open cleaned out sanctif
[56:50] Justified Sanctified now we have a place
[56:53] where the Holy Spirit
[56:55] could come and build its nest
[56:58] go look into that building its nest
[57:00] there I never really seen that before go
[57:02] in there and build its nest this
[57:04] dwelling place in your heart now
[57:08] that is a wonderful wonderful condition
[57:11] to be in cleaned out scrubbed out every
[57:14] portion of your heart open welcoming the
[57:17] Lord Jesus sin
[57:19] scripture says in Isaiah
[57:21] you know over Isaiah 1 18 I'm going to
[57:26] be traveling soon and when we get there
[57:27] we give them my we give them US Dollars
[57:30] and they give us Euros or or money for
[57:33] whatever country you're in and
[57:36] when you do that you have what's called
[57:37] an exchange rate
[57:39] and so you give them so many dollars
[57:40] they give you so many euros I think
[57:43] Euros might be like a dollar fifty or a
[57:46] one one or one dollar and fifty cents
[57:48] would get me one Euro so it's not a very
[57:50] good exchange rate
[57:52] um whereas like if you go up to Canada
[57:54] if I give them one dollar they'll give
[57:56] me maybe a dollar twenty five a dollar
[57:57] fifty and change so you get a better
[57:59] exchange rate when you're going to
[58:01] Canada you know there's there's
[58:02] different exchanges well let me show you
[58:04] the best exchange rate that's ever been
[58:07] come now and let us reason together
[58:09] saith the Lord though your sins be as
[58:11] Scarlet they shall be as white as snow
[58:14] though they be red like Crimson they
[58:16] shall be as
[58:19] Leep now that's an exchange rate right
[58:21] there you bring me your filthy dirty
[58:23] heart you bring me these things that you
[58:25] have in your life that's just as bad as
[58:28] it can be and I'll take that heart and
[58:30] I'll wash it and I'll purify it and it
[58:32] will be as wide as snow
[58:35] amen you bring me your sin and I'll
[58:37] bring you eternal life that is an
[58:40] exchange rate
[58:42] that's worth talking about
[58:45] but God requires you to give him all of
[58:50] your heart
[58:51] not 99 of it all of your heart
[58:55] and
[58:57] it happens every day
[59:00] you see
[59:02] we go through our daily life and you
[59:05] know we let that temper flare up and we
[59:07] begin to to to say some things that we
[59:09] shouldn't
[59:10] you know what happens
[59:12] that dub of the Holy Spirit takes her
[59:15] flight
[59:16] she goes up here she doesn't go very far
[59:19] away
[59:21] she just goes there and she's waiting
[59:23] until that heart
[59:26] is welcoming again
[59:28] and I'm afraid friends that we spend far
[59:31] too many days and our Christian
[59:33] experience with the Holy Ghost just
[59:35] waiting
[59:37] to get back in
[59:40] he's already chosen you he's already
[59:42] made his Dwelling Place there and then
[59:45] we allow that that
[59:47] human nature to flare up again we began
[59:50] to to say well but I've got some rights
[59:52] you know and I deserve oh when you begin
[59:56] to hear that word come in your mind
[59:58] saying well you know I've done so much I
[1:00:01] really deserve a little bit of this or
[1:00:02] that or the other
[1:00:04] 99 of the time friends all you're doing
[1:00:06] is just you know publishing the devil's
[1:00:09] propaganda
[1:00:11] bridge I deserve a little no you don't
[1:00:15] usually that's that's just a flimsy
[1:00:18] excuse and you know we'll we'll let a
[1:00:21] little something happen let a root of
[1:00:23] bitterness spring up in our heart you
[1:00:25] know that thing's a great big ugly thing
[1:00:28] that root of bitterness will drive the
[1:00:30] Holy Spirit out of your life
[1:00:34] I watched that happen too
[1:00:37] a Sunday school teacher
[1:00:40] as a boy
[1:00:42] their family got bittered about
[1:00:44] something
[1:00:46] precious people some I mean to this day
[1:00:48] some of those precious people you ever
[1:00:50] meet
[1:00:51] got bitter in their heart quit going to
[1:00:53] church
[1:00:55] pretty soon their children were just
[1:00:57] married to people in the world their
[1:00:59] marriages fell apart within a few years
[1:01:01] their homes were just in chaos
[1:01:05] and we my father went to the brother he
[1:01:07] says brother you're you're a real man
[1:01:10] you're you're like there wasn't no
[1:01:12] pretend about you you were a real
[1:01:13] Christian what what are you doing
[1:01:16] he said oh well you know I just don't
[1:01:17] feel it in my heart anymore
[1:01:20] he says but
[1:01:22] you know you you've made a commitment to
[1:01:25] the lord it's not about how you're
[1:01:26] feeling about this
[1:01:28] you see when he let that in there it
[1:01:29] just began to drive everything out and
[1:01:31] bring a whole lot of other things in and
[1:01:33] yes sir
[1:01:34] and you know a few years later his his
[1:01:36] wife looked at him and says you know I
[1:01:38] just don't feel it in my heart anymore
[1:01:39] she walked out the door
[1:01:42] same words he'd spoke to his wife or to
[1:01:44] God he said well I spoke back to him
[1:01:48] life just an absolute I I don't have a
[1:01:50] happy solution to that story right now I
[1:01:53] believe he's a child of God
[1:01:55] friends
[1:01:57] don't let one day go by
[1:01:59] without you dying out to yourself and
[1:02:01] committing yourself once again saying
[1:02:03] God forgive me of those things let me
[1:02:06] die if Saint Paul had to Die daily
[1:02:09] friends sure don't try and tell me
[1:02:11] you're so spiritual that you only have
[1:02:12] to do it once a year
[1:02:15] there's a daily yielding a daily
[1:02:18] surrender as you walk with the Lord
[1:02:20] Jesus
[1:02:22] to make him welcome in there
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:34] Abraham says here won't you tonight
[1:02:36] while he's knocking at your door say
[1:02:37] Lord I now open the door come in O king
[1:02:40] of glory glory and save me and open up
[1:02:43] the doors of my heart I open up my Door
[1:02:46] of Faith
[1:02:48] my door of Pride my door of indifference
[1:02:50] my door of selfishness all the doors of
[1:02:53] my heart I swing open To You O Lord of
[1:02:56] oh Lord Jesus Jesus is standing present
[1:02:59] now
[1:03:02] That Door of Faith
[1:03:04] if you'll let him in that door
[1:03:07] all things will be possible to you
[1:03:11] but if you keep that door closed and
[1:03:13] you're just worried that you might look
[1:03:14] like a fanatic
[1:03:17] he won't Force his way in
[1:03:19] you know
[1:03:22] we have that opportunity right now
[1:03:25] to open the door to Christ we have that
[1:03:27] opportunity to to let him be the ruler
[1:03:30] and the Lord of our life
[1:03:32] there was a young man one time who had
[1:03:34] that opportunity
[1:03:35] and he refused it Jesus Christ looked
[1:03:38] him right in the eye and says forsake it
[1:03:41] all and follow me
[1:03:43] and that man went away sorrowful because
[1:03:46] he had a lot of possessions he had a lot
[1:03:48] of things that he valued more than
[1:03:50] following the Lord Jesus Jesus told him
[1:03:53] take up the cross and follow me
[1:03:56] and he went away sad because he couldn't
[1:03:59] let go of those things
[1:04:02] you know
[1:04:04] Simon the Cyrene when he picked up that
[1:04:07] cross
[1:04:08] but the Branham says that when he picked
[1:04:09] up the cross of the Lord Jesus he says
[1:04:12] the blood that was on that cross caught
[1:04:14] on Simon
[1:04:17] let me carry my cross let me carry my
[1:04:21] portion of the load
[1:04:23] how many people denied have sunk beyond
[1:04:25] the regions of Mercy into a devil's Hell
[1:04:28] in a torment of a nightmare
[1:04:29] how they'd love to come back and have
[1:04:32] one more chance what would they do
[1:04:34] tonight if Jesus would come to hell and
[1:04:37] knock at their door
[1:04:39] that Rich Young Ruler when he lifted up
[1:04:41] his eyes in hell
[1:04:43] he looked up at Abraham and he says let
[1:04:46] Lazarus come bring me a drop of water
[1:04:48] it can't be done
[1:04:50] he says well you know let somebody go
[1:04:53] back and begin to preach the gospel to
[1:04:55] my brothers tell them don't do what I
[1:04:58] did tell them to follow Jesus tell them
[1:05:00] that this is the wrong way to go
[1:05:03] he says they've got the prophet's
[1:05:04] message why would they listen to Lazarus
[1:05:07] if he raised from the dead
[1:05:11] but he had once he got into that
[1:05:13] condition he had a perspective he had a
[1:05:16] vision of what actually mattered
[1:05:19] because he'd been building bigger Barns
[1:05:21] and bigger Barns and grown his business
[1:05:23] and doing all these different things
[1:05:25] and God says Thou fool this night thy
[1:05:28] soul is required of Thee
[1:05:32] Braham teaches the sermon the lamb and
[1:05:35] the dove all right and and you all know
[1:05:37] these things this is this is Sunday
[1:05:39] school for you I'm sure but there's a
[1:05:42] lamb and that's the Holy Spirit and the
[1:05:44] only thing that that Holy Spirit will
[1:05:46] rest on is a lamb nature you see that at
[1:05:49] the Jordan River when that that Holy
[1:05:51] Spirit came down and rested on the Lamb
[1:05:53] of God that was to take the sin of the
[1:05:54] world there was that lamb and Dove
[1:05:57] relationship and it will only rest on a
[1:06:01] lamb but the problem is is when you come
[1:06:03] into this world you're born as a wolf
[1:06:06] and there's no continuity between the
[1:06:09] Holy Spirit and that nature and so you
[1:06:11] have to have a nature change you have to
[1:06:14] die you literally die out on the altar
[1:06:17] of God and another life enters him which
[1:06:20] is his spirit and now this lamb and Dove
[1:06:24] relationship is the only way it's the
[1:06:26] only continuity there is Between Heaven
[1:06:29] and Earth is that lamb and of
[1:06:30] relationship but you still have down on
[1:06:34] the inside it you still got that wolf of
[1:06:36] nature that's still in there because
[1:06:37] you're still in a mortal flesh body
[1:06:39] don't tell me that this body doesn't
[1:06:41] want to sin don't tell me that this body
[1:06:43] doesn't have temptations because it does
[1:06:46] and if you are not careful and you do
[1:06:49] not keep your body under subjection that
[1:06:52] wolf nature will resurrect itself and
[1:06:54] it'll step out and it'll begin to snarl
[1:06:56] and it'll begin to backbite and it'll
[1:06:57] begin to spread things through the
[1:06:58] church and begin to do all this stuff
[1:07:01] that Holy Spirit takes its flight
[1:07:04] it's not compatible with that wolf
[1:07:07] nature and so you know well what do you
[1:07:09] do if if you're if your fleshly nature
[1:07:12] begins to snarl a little bit and grieve
[1:07:13] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:15] die
[1:07:17] You Gotta Die Out submit yourself and
[1:07:20] let him come in again as the Lord of
[1:07:24] your life
[1:07:25] now
[1:07:27] Birmingham talks about
[1:07:29] I'm just going to read it we've got a
[1:07:31] little bit time
[1:07:32] um Bill Graham says in the church and
[1:07:34] its condition if you want to hear a
[1:07:35] sermon that will really just kind of
[1:07:37] scour your heart out that's a good one
[1:07:39] he doesn't he doesn't pull no punches in
[1:07:41] there he says the first thing you know
[1:07:42] when you started doing those things you
[1:07:44] let down the bars you begin compromising
[1:07:46] then the church began to get little
[1:07:48] clicks and among them and this one said
[1:07:51] you know the pastor's just so and so or
[1:07:52] the deacons so and so and the first
[1:07:54] thing you know you listen to that and
[1:07:57] that's the reason you have so much
[1:07:58] trouble is because you begin to listen
[1:08:00] to the devil
[1:08:03] he didn't say it was your the person you
[1:08:05] were listening to he said it was the
[1:08:06] devil you were listening to that's
[1:08:07] pretty strong
[1:08:09] he says you listen to the devil and get
[1:08:11] a snarl instead of listening to The
[1:08:13] Gentle Dove and the Holy Spirit the dove
[1:08:15] of God that would lead you and guide you
[1:08:17] love you and bless you
[1:08:19] first time you get one of those little
[1:08:21] temper spasm the dove flies right away
[1:08:23] that's right she can't stand it her
[1:08:25] Nature's different she can't stand that
[1:08:27] at all and you go to talking about your
[1:08:29] neighbor she can't stand that she just
[1:08:31] won't put up with it he just takes his
[1:08:33] flight and goes on away he just can't
[1:08:36] stand it any longer the dove is gentle
[1:08:38] the dove is Meek and the Dove and and
[1:08:41] the and they can't stand nothing unless
[1:08:43] it's the same kind of a nature now God
[1:08:46] can make you a different nature man or
[1:08:48] woman he can give you a different nature
[1:08:50] and you say well brother Branham what
[1:08:52] can we do about it just become a lamb
[1:08:54] again if the only two animals will ever
[1:08:56] associate together that's the Dove and
[1:08:58] the lamb the dove won't come to anything
[1:09:00] else but a lamb and if you become a goat
[1:09:02] then that old goatee Spirit get that old
[1:09:04] goatee Spirit off of you that's right if
[1:09:06] you become something else get it away
[1:09:08] from you
[1:09:09] and so I you know many different times
[1:09:11] in your life you're going to have a
[1:09:13] goatee spirit that doesn't
[1:09:14] de-christianize you there's gonna be
[1:09:15] many different times in your life when
[1:09:17] you find that wolf beginning to snarl
[1:09:19] and and you're on the way to church and
[1:09:20] your wife says something and you snarl
[1:09:22] back at her and and suddenly you get to
[1:09:24] church and two wolves walk in the back
[1:09:25] door you know it's not a good situation
[1:09:29] well what do you do about that does that
[1:09:31] mean you're not a Christian anymore no
[1:09:32] no but you got to humble yourself you
[1:09:36] got to get down and you got to get that
[1:09:37] goatee nature off of you and come back
[1:09:40] to being a Glam again
[1:09:42] now something the program I won't read
[1:09:44] them all but he says it again and again
[1:09:45] and again he says that
[1:09:48] he says it doesn't go very far away
[1:09:51] and that's such an encouragement to me
[1:09:53] friends because there's been many a time
[1:09:54] when that wolf nature is resurrected in
[1:09:56] my life and but he says it here again
[1:09:58] and again he says um
[1:10:03] he says that holy spirit that you you
[1:10:05] grieve the Holy Spirit he says but he's
[1:10:07] not very far away
[1:10:11] he says oh he talks about how we get
[1:10:13] into this condition and it's so bad
[1:10:15] um he says the dove can't leave you
[1:10:17] because you know too much or there's no
[1:10:19] place for the dove to roost in your life
[1:10:21] because you've got all these other
[1:10:22] things in there
[1:10:24] um he says but what's the remedy what's
[1:10:26] the remedy today the remedy is this you
[1:10:28] just be the lamb God is still the dove
[1:10:30] now he hasn't flew very far
[1:10:34] says it again and again he just flew up
[1:10:36] on the right up on the tree just ahead
[1:10:38] of you there he's longing and he's
[1:10:40] waiting to see a time when you'll just
[1:10:42] surrender yourself and say oh precious
[1:10:44] Dove of God come back to my heart again
[1:10:49] she's not a long way the Holy Spirit
[1:10:51] isn't isn't greed and a million miles
[1:10:53] away it's just right there just just
[1:10:55] waiting just above your shoulder on a
[1:10:58] little Branch right there just saying
[1:10:59] won't you just get that heart right I
[1:11:01] want to come in this is my Dwelling
[1:11:03] Place this is my temple this is my
[1:11:05] habitation I want to get back in there
[1:11:07] but as long as you let that little bit
[1:11:08] of bitterness in there
[1:11:10] he's not welcome
[1:11:12] a root of bitterness is a horrible
[1:11:14] horrible thing
[1:11:16] but we've got to continually look for
[1:11:19] for things that might creep up in our
[1:11:21] heart and you look at that the the the
[1:11:25] where Jesus said the word goes out and
[1:11:27] it's sowed among thorny thorns and
[1:11:29] thistles and these different things and
[1:11:31] I believe that can be our heart on
[1:11:33] different times of the week different
[1:11:34] you know days of of of the year we'll
[1:11:37] come to church and we might come to
[1:11:39] church with a bit of a Stony heart and
[1:11:40] we walk out and we just didn't get a
[1:11:41] thing
[1:11:42] we might come to church sometimes and
[1:11:44] we've got so much going on at work we've
[1:11:45] got so many thorns and thistles there we
[1:11:47] really didn't get a whole lot
[1:11:49] but if we'll get good prepared ground
[1:11:51] you can walk away with a harvest
[1:11:54] Abraham says here in Jehovah Jireh and
[1:11:57] we know that every seed or promise of
[1:11:59] God will bring forth of its kind what it
[1:12:01] promised if it strikes the right ground
[1:12:03] the ground that's prepared ready all the
[1:12:06] Rocks has been thrown out and The Roots
[1:12:08] and the bitterness and selfishness and
[1:12:10] indifference and jealousy has all been
[1:12:12] grubbed out
[1:12:13] as far as I understand that means you
[1:12:15] get it out by the roots grubbed out and
[1:12:18] that root of bitterness that Springs up
[1:12:19] that sometimes so spoils the thing that
[1:12:21] God is trying to do we pray God that
[1:12:24] that won't be among us but that the good
[1:12:26] word will find good ground in these
[1:12:30] I I believe that we have a a ground
[1:12:34] that's been prepared we have a heart
[1:12:35] that's ready to receive it and if we see
[1:12:38] some little spider or some little
[1:12:40] cockroach that slipped into our hearts
[1:12:42] slipped into our life
[1:12:44] just step on it just squash the little
[1:12:46] thing we don't have to put up with it we
[1:12:49] don't have to compromise with it we
[1:12:51] don't have to live with it you know in
[1:12:53] the in the mental health world the only
[1:12:55] thing they can do with with
[1:12:56] psychologists and and the medications as
[1:12:58] far as I've seen is they can teach you
[1:13:00] how to live with your problem they can
[1:13:03] teach you how to cope with it uh when
[1:13:06] when my wife was having the mental
[1:13:08] health issues we were exploring what's
[1:13:10] what's the options out here what can
[1:13:12] they do and the only thing they could do
[1:13:14] was was like give you a crunch they
[1:13:17] couldn't heal the broken leg
[1:13:19] and I was like well that's just not
[1:13:20] really a solution
[1:13:24] you don't have to live
[1:13:26] with anything in that heart
[1:13:30] you don't have to put up with it you
[1:13:32] don't have to live with that devil you
[1:13:34] don't have to live with that thing in
[1:13:35] your heart you have there is a Power in
[1:13:37] the Blood of Jesus Christ to take those
[1:13:40] things completely out of your heart I
[1:13:42] don't care how wrongly you were treated
[1:13:43] I don't care how much you have a right
[1:13:45] to be bitter you think
[1:13:48] I don't care how bad it was
[1:13:51] that blood of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[1:13:53] completely cleanse that heart
[1:13:58] brother Graham says if if you think if a
[1:14:01] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:14:02] a sister say Lord don't let me never
[1:14:04] have the root of bitterness spring up
[1:14:06] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[1:14:08] the Christ right out of my life that
[1:14:11] poison acids of malice and jealousy and
[1:14:14] hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:14:16] Spirit right away from you it will run
[1:14:18] him from the Tabernacle here here it'll
[1:14:21] kill the spirit of God or drive it from
[1:14:23] here hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:14:24] everything see don't you do that
[1:14:29] don't come to church
[1:14:32] with a pile of ease in your heart
[1:14:33] friends
[1:14:35] don't do it
[1:14:36] what this church needs is one or two
[1:14:39] good members cleansed with their hearts
[1:14:41] set of five by fire by the power of the
[1:14:43] Holy Spirit it would do more for this
[1:14:45] church than 40 revivals would
[1:14:51] the musicians would come

[1:15:45] with dirty feet seeing him there in
[1:15:48] somebody's home but he wasn't really

[1:16:18] just anything he takes it
[1:16:21] he takes it anywhere how he takes it
[1:16:24] but she said I want the best
[1:16:28] and it cost her everything she had to
[1:16:31] get the best

[1:17:03] he's deserving of it friends
[1:17:06] now I've seen
[1:17:08] Idols to pagan gods built out of
[1:17:12] concrete and
[1:17:14] latex paint
[1:17:17] they don't deserve nothing
[1:17:20] they have no power
[1:17:21] they can't do anything for you
[1:17:25] you have to take care of them
[1:17:29] but our God is not like that
[1:17:32] we serve a god that is living in present
[1:17:34] to do the
[1:17:36] exceedingly abundantly more than we
[1:17:38] could ever dream or even ask
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:43] deserving friends
[1:17:45] deserving of all of your heart
[1:17:49] he's just you say oh well I serve the
[1:17:52] Lord the Lord's he's he's Supreme in my
[1:17:54] life
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:56] what are you doing with your time
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:01] are you you see when you look at your
[1:18:03] time you find out where you really value
[1:18:05] things
[1:18:06] you find out where your heart really is
[1:18:09] at
[1:18:10] Hudson here he loves to go fishing I
[1:18:14] mean he just loves he's a fish and
[1:18:16] fanatic
[1:18:17] and you know what every opportunity he
[1:18:19] gets
[1:18:21] he sees a creek he sees a pond
[1:18:23] he drove by this New River down here
[1:18:24] he's like hey can I go fishing there
[1:18:25] it's like no I gotta study tomorrow
[1:18:27] Hudson he's like well you can go listen
[1:18:28] to a message and watch me fish
[1:18:32] next day he's at how many times did he
[1:18:34] ask you to take him fishing Josiah
[1:18:36] at least a dozen times take me fishing
[1:18:38] take me fishing you see he just loves to
[1:18:41] go fishing
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:43] so that's what he wants to do with his
[1:18:45] time
[1:18:47] and I understand we have
[1:18:48] responsibilities
[1:18:50] but what do you do with your free time
[1:18:53] what do you do with your time that's
[1:18:55] actually your right to decide what you
[1:18:57] need to do with it because you don't
[1:18:59] have to go you know take care of
[1:19:01] responsibilities how are you using that
[1:19:04] that's where your heart is
[1:19:08] my question said
[1:19:12] things in your heart
[1:19:15] that are ahead of God
[1:19:18] I'm just asking us to not to to check
[1:19:21] our hearts what does your heart look
[1:19:23] like
[1:19:24] I don't know you all look mighty nice to
[1:19:26] me on the outside
[1:19:30] but what's that heart look like
[1:19:33] is it all barred up is it eating up with
[1:19:36] bitterness
[1:19:38] are the things in there that you'd be
[1:19:40] ashamed for anybody to see a examination
[1:19:43] of that heart
[1:19:44] or is it plunged beneath that precious
[1:19:47] blood is it cleansed of everything and
[1:19:49] is every dwarf thrown wide open saying
[1:19:52] Lord come in and be the Lord of my life
[1:19:54] because that's what he's looking for
[1:19:55] this in this hour he is looking for
[1:19:57] hearts where he can come down and be in
[1:19:59] preeminence in a people his desire is to
[1:20:02] find individuals that will place him as
[1:20:04] the true Lord of their life so he can
[1:20:06] come down and express himself as God
[1:20:09] Almighty in individuals so they won't
[1:20:11] anymore just be the human beings walking
[1:20:14] around but it'll actually be deity
[1:20:15] incarnate on this Earth for that's
[1:20:17] exactly what Jesus Christ was he was a
[1:20:19] man and he was God and in this hour God
[1:20:22] has created a plan and a purpose so that
[1:20:24] individuals human beings can be filled
[1:20:27] with the spirit of God and so yielded
[1:20:29] that it's no longer them but it's
[1:20:31] almighty God walking around on this
[1:20:33] Earth as misses Jesus Christ God in
[1:20:36] preeminence in a people
[1:20:38] but it comes down to that heart
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:20:47] I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart
[1:20:49] do you know that
