[37:49] before you
[37:51] Lord realizing that you are our father
[37:55] and Lord
[37:57] that you desire to meet with us father
[38:00] and we desire to meet with you
[38:03] tonight Lord we believe that this
[38:05] meeting has been ordained by you and we
[38:09] have felt the pool to
[38:11] come and Lord now we're just
[38:14] asking that you would uh have your way
[38:18] here in this part of the service we
[38:21] believe the word to be the most
[38:22] important father and Lord we pray pray
[38:26] that the songs and the worship be
[38:29] pleasing in your sight father and that
[38:31] you would feel at home that you would
[38:34] just do a creative work within each and
[38:35] every one of us and may your word have
[38:39] its effect Upon Us father Lord if
[38:42] there's any sin that has been committed
[38:45] that's not under the blood we'd ask that
[38:47] you'd forgive us Lord of it and we just
[38:51] pray now that you just have your way we
[38:54] ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[38:57] church
[38:58] says amen and amen James the 5th chapter
[39:04] and the 14th verse but it says is any
[39:07] sick among you let him call for the
[39:10] Elders of the church and let them pray
[39:12] over him anointing him with oil in the
[39:15] name of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[39:18] everybody say the prayer of faith shall
[39:21] save the sick and the Lord shall raise
[39:23] him up and if he have committed sins
[39:27] they shall be forgiven him amen you can
[39:32] have your seats this
[39:34] evening
[39:36] and as we have
[39:39] um mentioned last week that this of
[39:42] course James is talking about the laying
[39:45] on of hands and and um and praying the
[39:50] prayer Faith but I believe that the the
[39:53] that prayer of faith is always important
[39:56] and not just when it comes to laying
[39:59] hands on the sick and um um it is of
[40:05] course important that we pray and we've
[40:09] talked about it 1 Timothy 2 and8 uh uh
[40:13] here it says I will therefore that men
[40:15] pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[40:19] without wrath and and doubting and we
[40:23] know that Jesus spent much time in
[40:25] prayer when he was on the earth and and
[40:28] if he had to spend much time in in
[40:31] prayer to stay in fellowship with the
[40:33] spirit that was in him then how much
[40:37] more do you and I have to spend time in
[40:41] prayer and uh um you know the prophet
[40:44] said if you only knew what much time in
[40:48] prayer meant what time in prayer but you
[40:51] can't hide a Believer from prayer uh uh
[40:55] there's something that
[40:56] uh uh connects us uh with God when we
[41:00] when we come to pray uh Believers
[41:03] Believers pray ain't that right and so
[41:07] uh praying to God uh means that we're
[41:11] looking unto him to supply our needs um
[41:15] we we we're devoting not just our prayer
[41:19] to him but we're devoting our heart
[41:21] we're devoting our request and we're
[41:24] we're not approaching the enemy uh uh so
[41:28] to to make a deal in hopes that he will
[41:32] be satisfied and that he'll make us you
[41:35] know let us live and let us have comfort
[41:37] and let us uh whatever but we are
[41:40] approaching the god of Heaven amen and
[41:44] and you know many times people have
[41:46] prayed prayers without understanding the
[41:49] one that they are praying to and uh uh
[41:53] the they and and and they're they're
[41:55] praying
[41:56] but while all along they're praying with
[41:59] fear in their heart they're they're
[42:01] they're praying still worrying and and
[42:04] fretting and their attitude and prayer
[42:07] to God is is is basically like how a
[42:11] beggar or a stranger would approach a a
[42:15] a uh someone on the streets um just
[42:19] hoping that that someone will have pity
[42:21] upon them and and hoping that someone
[42:24] will will give them money and hoping
[42:27] that you know uh they'll get some food
[42:29] or hoping you know and and a lot of
[42:32] times prayer uh pray to God is is really
[42:35] the the same approach is we're just
[42:38] hoping that he'll pity us and we're
[42:40] hoping that he'll he'll see the need and
[42:43] you know just somehow that we can get
[42:45] his attention and and and these things
[42:48] but here Philippians 4 and six Paul
[42:51] would tell us be careful for nothing can
[42:54] you say that with me be careful for
[42:56] nothing Amen in other words be be be
[43:00] don't be anxious don't fret don't worry
[43:03] for anything see but in everything
[43:06] everybody say everything by prayer and
[43:10] supplication with
[43:12] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[43:15] known unto God so so this is the type of
[43:18] prayer that we are to pray with
[43:20] Thanksgiving ain't that right and with
[43:24] supplication let your
[43:26] request uh uh be made known unto God so
[43:31] so prayer is to be made to God who is uh
[43:37] omnipotent and and and I I think it's
[43:40] important if we're going to pray the
[43:41] prayer of faith we have to know who
[43:43] we're praying to and God is
[43:46] omnipotent and the word omnipotent means
[43:50] having unlimited power or unlimited
[43:54] Authority and and so uh there there is
[43:57] only one who is omnipotent and that is
[44:00] God ain't that right amen and and so
[44:03] he's not limited to your situation uh or
[44:07] to uh any man's uh incapabilities God is
[44:11] Not uh on the level of of of just finite
[44:16] man amen so we cannot uh uh pray uh with
[44:20] this with this thought that God is
[44:22] limited uh uh when it comes to our
[44:25] situation I know God can move for so and
[44:27] so but I don't know if he can move for
[44:28] me well then you're you you you you
[44:31] cannot have the prayer of faith when
[44:33] you're approaching God in that way we
[44:35] have to know we have to believe we have
[44:38] to be assured and have the confidence
[44:40] that the god that we're praying to is
[44:43] omnipotent ain't that right and and and
[44:47] what what is he an omnipotent in he's
[44:50] omnipotent in healing in other words
[44:52] he's unlimited no matter what the name
[44:54] is no matter what disease is God is
[44:58] omnipotent in healing he is omnipotent
[45:01] in Salvation it in other words he can
[45:04] reach the farest the lowest to the
[45:06] lowest Sinner and and and rescue and
[45:09] save and deliver amen uh the worst
[45:12] sinner on the face of the Earth ain't
[45:14] that right he's omnipotent in in
[45:17] Deliverance he's omnipotent in
[45:19] transformation amen no matter what your
[45:21] habits are no matter what you go through
[45:23] God is omnipotent ain't that right and
[45:27] so therefore that that that when we
[45:30] really catch that amen then we can pray
[45:34] the prayer of faith but you cannot pray
[45:35] the prayer of faith if you don't know
[45:38] and and I mean really a revelation that
[45:41] God is omnipotent a a ain't that right
[45:44] amen because we will always limit God
[45:47] when we can't see a way out but when you
[45:50] can't see a way out you can still pray a
[45:52] prayer faith knowing that God is on
[45:55] omnipotent when your back is against the
[45:58] wall God is omnipotent and so we're we
[46:01] we're not basing our prayers based on
[46:03] the situation and based upon our
[46:05] limitation we are praying to a god that
[46:09] is omnipotent ain't that right this is
[46:12] why we are told to ask for big things
[46:15] because God can answer any prayer God
[46:20] can answer any request God can meet any
[46:24] need amen that you have here tonight
[46:28] this is why in mark 11:24 Jesus said
[46:31] whatsoever things that you desire When
[46:34] you pray believe everybody say believe
[46:38] that you receive them and you shall not
[46:41] might you shall have them ain't that
[46:44] right well who's going to give it to you
[46:46] well God's going to give it to you he's
[46:48] omnipotent and if he has to create it
[46:50] he'll give it to you you shall have it
[46:54] ain't that right now in 2 Kings the the
[46:58] uh 7th chapter it talks about the time
[47:01] when uh the enemy had uh encamped around
[47:04] the city of Samaria and they had been
[47:07] there for a while and and they had done
[47:09] it it was a Siege on the city and and
[47:12] they had stopped the food supply they
[47:14] had stopped up the water supply people
[47:16] were dying it was a drought they were
[47:19] hunging they were starving and it was a
[47:22] bad time uh uh for the people of Samaria
[47:25] but there was the Bible says there was
[47:27] four lepers sitting outside the city at
[47:29] the gate and uh um so so they they
[47:33] thought well if we go inside the city
[47:35] we're going to die if and so they said
[47:38] but but you know uh if if we go to the
[47:41] enemy well there's a chance that they
[47:43] might let us live and and you know they
[47:46] could kill us but we're going to die
[47:47] anyway so let's let's let's try the
[47:50] enemy and so the Bible says that they
[47:52] they they uh uh went and and and uh um
[47:57] uh to the enemy's camp and brother
[47:59] brandom says they moved out by faith and
[48:02] God rewarded them not they not only
[48:05] saved themselves but they saved the city
[48:07] of Samaria ain't that right amen but
[48:10] then we uh uh uh uh go uh brother
[48:13] brandom in his prayer he said Lord help
[48:15] the people Amen to understand and to
[48:18] know amen that that we don't have to
[48:21] take a chance by going to the enemy's
[48:24] Camp amen God our hope is not going to
[48:28] the enemy's camp but we we we can come
[48:31] on our knees to our loving father at the
[48:34] Throne of God aren't you glad for that
[48:37] amen see you've got a way and an
[48:39] approach to God Amen through prayer that
[48:43] you don't have to just keep dealing with
[48:45] the Enemy and begging the enemy and
[48:48] hoping the enemy will spare your life
[48:50] and spare your children spare the church
[48:52] spare the home spare whatever amen and
[48:55] just leave you a crumb you can go to the
[48:58] king of king and the Lord of Lord amen
[49:01] before the throne of grace because you
[49:03] amen have access to God can you say Amen
[49:07] so you don't have to take a chance
[49:09] tonight amen you see uh uh Hebrews
[49:13] 4:16 Paul I believe or Peter I know Paul
[49:16] says let us therefore come boldly before
[49:19] unto the throne of grace that we may
[49:22] obtain mercy and find Grace to help in
[49:26] time of need ain't that right so then
[49:29] when we pray the prayer of faith then it
[49:32] is a sign that we truly understand the
[49:36] one who we're praying to amen we're not
[49:39] likening him to a politician or to a
[49:42] president to a king or to some Earthly
[49:45] uh dictator some Earthly power amen we
[49:48] we're we're likening into him as to who
[49:51] he really is and that is the omnipotent
[49:54] Supreme being a man that can do anything
[49:58] he wants to he's Sovereign in any act in
[50:01] any situation under any
[50:04] circumstance amen so now in the Old
[50:07] Testament God appeared uh uh to Mankind
[50:11] in seven compound Redemptive names and
[50:15] and in those Redemptive names he
[50:18] represented himself to the human race
[50:21] for everything that we have need of
[50:25] while in this journey amen uh uh in our
[50:28] fallen State and all the way to Glory
[50:31] ain't that right amen and so God would
[50:34] represent him and and so we know him as
[50:38] God that Health thee we know him as God
[50:42] that would supply all of our needs we we
[50:44] know him as Lord our Banner the Lord
[50:47] that would provide himself a sacrifice
[50:51] and and the prophet says what he
[50:53] appeared as God to the human race race
[50:55] in the beginning he has to continue on
[51:00] under those names and under that
[51:02] provision can you say Amen if God is
[51:05] eternal and he revealed himself back
[51:08] then as Jehovah Gyra and if he's still
[51:10] God then he still is Jehovah Gyra he
[51:13] cannot change his nature he cannot
[51:15] change his ways he cannot change his
[51:18] habits he cannot change uh what he is
[51:21] ain't that right so he has to remain
[51:23] that because he reduced himself to the
[51:27] human race by those names and if none of
[51:31] the Redemptive names appli to Jesus then
[51:35] Jesus Christ Isn't Our Savior he's not
[51:38] our healer he's not our deliverer he's
[51:41] not our way maker he's he's nothing to
[51:44] us ain't that right but if all of these
[51:48] Redemptive names amen belong to him and
[51:52] are in him then he is the saying
[51:55] yesterday today and
[51:59] forever ain't that right amen yes sir so
[52:03] notice as as we read the prayer of faith
[52:07] shall save the sick and if he hath
[52:10] committed any sin it shall be forgiven
[52:14] him what will the prayer of faith can
[52:16] you say that with me the prayer of faith
[52:19] the prayer of faith will amen see so
[52:22] it's not just praying to God that counts
[52:25] amen but it's praying the prayer of
[52:28] faith amen the prophet would tell us
[52:31] what I'm trying to do is get to the
[52:33] Pentecostal people to let them realize
[52:36] who they are if you only knew who you
[52:39] was tonight amen there had come such a
[52:42] spontaneous world of Faith through here
[52:45] till there wouldn't be a sick person now
[52:48] you think of that such faith that there
[52:51] wouldn't even be a sick person there
[52:53] would be no need of having a prayer like
[52:55] if people if the people that's here
[52:57] realize who they are that's the only way
[53:00] you can do it ain't that right it's
[53:02] through faith amen so he says how do you
[53:05] think it is in foreign Nations walking
[53:08] against demons and powers and everything
[53:11] you have to know where you're standing
[53:13] see Satan don't care how loud you holler
[53:15] Satan don't care how much you jump up
[53:18] and down Satan will lay right there but
[53:20] he has to recognize faith and it will
[53:23] move him every time ain't that right so
[53:27] a prayer of faith amen it's different
[53:29] than just praying you can you can beg
[53:31] and you can make your prayer a prayer of
[53:32] begging you can make your prayer a
[53:35] prayer of of wandering you can make your
[53:37] prayer a prayer of wishing you can make
[53:40] your prayer a prayer of anything amen
[53:42] trying to get God's attention trying to
[53:44] appeal to him trying to whatever but it
[53:46] takes a prayer of faith and when when
[53:50] not only does God recognize the faith
[53:52] but Satan recognizes the faith ain't
[53:55] that right see so he says I you know the
[53:58] devil don't care how much you holler
[54:00] he's not deaf amen he don't care how
[54:03] much you scream that doesn't mean a
[54:05] thing to him he'll never recognize that
[54:08] but he will recognize
[54:13] Faith Hallelujah my desire is that God
[54:16] would make us a people of prayer and the
[54:19] people of
[54:20] Faith amen I ask God quite often to to
[54:25] make me a man of prayer the Lord but I I
[54:29] don't want my prayer to be filled with
[54:32] fear and doubt and
[54:34] wandering and
[54:36] unbelief and and to be honest I I I
[54:39] don't I don't want to just pray to God
[54:42] because I am in
[54:43] need I don't want to make him my errand
[54:46] boy but but here's where I really want
[54:49] why I want to pray is because I want to
[54:51] pray to him because I'm his
[54:53] son I'm his
[54:55] son and and you know we talk about
[54:58] prayer of faith it has to go both ways
[55:00] you have to know who he is but then you
[55:01] have to know who you are come on now and
[55:04] and and and so see so the relationship
[55:07] that that God and I have is that of a
[55:10] father and son a ain't that right and
[55:14] and not only a son that is wavered but a
[55:16] son who has been reconciled to his
[55:18] father can you say Amen talking about
[55:21] prayer of faith now amen that that that
[55:24] you see that that relationship is is is
[55:27] is between me and God father he the
[55:30] father I am his son that has been
[55:34] reconciled and there is harmony between
[55:37] us we we lived all of our sinful lives
[55:40] with no Harmony we were doing our own
[55:42] thing God doing his thing and and we
[55:44] were bucking and we were we were just
[55:46] just rebelling and all that but he come
[55:48] and saved us and He restored a
[55:51] relationship and it was all because the
[55:53] reason we rebelled is because we were
[55:55] under Satan's domain that God broke that
[55:59] thing from our lives and loosed us from
[56:02] his grip that we can now come in
[56:04] agreement to his will to his
[56:08] word can you say Amen so so therefore to
[56:12] me to me coming in being a son and
[56:16] knowing I'm a son and and and knowing
[56:19] that there's a Reconciliation and now
[56:21] there's a Harmony between me and my
[56:24] heavenly father father see then then to
[56:26] me it that's what gives me Faith to
[56:29] approach him and pray
[56:32] differently to to quit praying the
[56:34] prayer as though I'm a stranger to God
[56:37] and and and and and to quit praying a
[56:39] prayer as though God sees me as a
[56:44] beggar amen can you
[56:47] sayen amen see my my prayer as a son is
[56:52] different than it would be if I was just
[56:55] a servant or a beggar amen my prayer is
[56:59] different see as a son then it would be
[57:03] if I had the mentality of a servant or a
[57:07] beggar praise the Lord can you say Amen
[57:11] so God doesn't want us to have that type
[57:12] of
[57:13] mentality brother Bram said see he he
[57:16] sent his son on earth made in likeness
[57:19] of sinful flesh and he died that we
[57:21] might be
[57:23] redeemed aren't you glad for that amen
[57:26] that we might be redeemed and brought
[57:28] back to God to be Sons and Daughters of
[57:30] God to walk with him
[57:33] again
[57:35] relationship right we we God doesn't
[57:37] want us to spend our whole life as
[57:39] church members without
[57:42] relationship Amen on Now 1 John 3 And1
[57:47] says behold what manner of love the
[57:49] father hath bestowed upon us that we
[57:51] should be called the sons of God Amen
[57:54] notice therefore the world knoweth us
[57:57] not because it knew him not amen ain't
[58:00] that right so God's love is bestowed
[58:02] upon you and
[58:04] I
[58:06] right so to identify us as sons of God
[58:10] prise the Lord ain't that right amen the
[58:13] purpose of his love bestowed upon us is
[58:17] to identify us as his sons and his
[58:20] daughters and and you know the love of
[58:23] God is is so much talked about and yet
[58:26] misunderstood you know the bi the Bible
[58:28] says whom the Lord loveth he Chast
[58:30] chastens he he correct ain't that right
[58:34] so so then this love that God bestowed
[58:37] upon us see his love is corrective love
[58:40] he he does not leave us in sin and
[58:42] wallowing in in the muck and the M he he
[58:44] does not leave us in a sinful State and
[58:47] nor does he leave us in a religious
[58:49] State amen but see he is molding and
[58:52] shaping his children to his original
[58:55] thoughts of what he thought about us
[58:58] hello God being Eternal he had thoughts
[59:02] and them thoughts are Eternal he didn't
[59:04] just think of you when you was just born
[59:07] in a certain year I was born in 1973 but
[59:10] that's not when Jesus and or or God
[59:12] started to think of me I I am an eternal
[59:15] thought of God can you say Amen so he
[59:18] died to redeem me back to that thought
[59:21] praise God whatever Satan done to me
[59:23] whatever Satan done to you there a blood
[59:25] there Amen to loose you from that to
[59:27] take all your past away and your scars
[59:30] away and everything to where Satan
[59:32] cannot accuse you before the father amen
[59:36] ain't that right so God is molding and
[59:38] shaping his children and and the prophet
[59:41] said this is what end time evangelism is
[59:45] he said what what good is the stones if
[59:47] you haven't got a a stonemason to shape
[59:49] them out confessions is Stones when
[59:53] Peter made his confession Jesus said
[59:54] Thou Art Peter a little Stone but what
[59:57] good is a stone if there isn't a stone
[59:58] Mason there to shape him into a Son of
[1:00:01] God Amen you're just piling a bunch of
[1:00:03] rocks is that right it isn't doing a bit
[1:00:06] of good amen think of that all the all
[1:00:08] the preaching all the singing all the
[1:00:10] the concerts and all the all the
[1:00:12] seminaries and all that ain't doing any
[1:00:14] good if if it ain't shaping us into sons
[1:00:17] of God it's got to shape us that's right
[1:00:21] see the water wearth away the stone
[1:00:24] that's right that's the people see what
[1:00:26] good is Stones if you haven't got a true
[1:00:27] Mason with a good sharp tool to shape
[1:00:30] him into The Fitting Place in the house
[1:00:32] of God just want you to want to ask you
[1:00:36] what's good what goods the decision what
[1:00:38] good you putting your name on the book
[1:00:41] see what good is coming and joining the
[1:00:43] church if the stonemason isn't there
[1:00:46] that'll shape that and make them quit
[1:00:48] this and quit that and cut them and make
[1:00:50] them over this way and square them up
[1:00:53] and make them like Christians that sits
[1:00:55] in the house of God with signs following
[1:00:58] the believer he said that's end time
[1:01:01] evangelism is taking the stones and
[1:01:04] shaping
[1:01:06] them prise the Lord amen aren't you glad
[1:01:09] for the stone Mason praise God prise
[1:01:12] lord now that's his love for us that's
[1:01:14] his love to us amen that we should be
[1:01:17] called the sons of God he makes our life
[1:01:19] different he makes our confession
[1:01:21] different he makes our prayer different
[1:01:24] he makes our relationship with God
[1:01:26] different amen see 1 John 3:2 beloved
[1:01:30] now are we the sons of God now everybody
[1:01:34] say now not going to be but now are we
[1:01:37] the sons of God we're not being Sons and
[1:01:39] Daughters of God when we get to heaven
[1:01:41] we are sons of God right now amen see
[1:01:45] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:01:47] be but we know this that when he shall
[1:01:50] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:01:52] see him as he is
[1:01:55] all right so now we are now can you say
[1:01:58] now I am a Son of God now now I am now
[1:02:03] present tense now I am so now Satan's
[1:02:05] not messing with a sinner he's messing
[1:02:07] with a son of God ain't that right now
[1:02:10] I'm not praying as a sinner I'm praying
[1:02:12] as the Son of God yes sir it's true now
[1:02:17] amen see we that's that's that the
[1:02:18] prayer of faith see so now not only is
[1:02:22] God omnipotent amen but man sons of God
[1:02:27] is
[1:02:29] omnipotent go ahead ain't that right
[1:02:31] amen well the prophet taught it he says
[1:02:33] man is omnipotent he said you don't
[1:02:35] believe that but he is a man notice a
[1:02:38] man fully surrendered to God is
[1:02:43] omnipotent a a man a woman boy or girl
[1:02:46] that has totally surrendered their life
[1:02:48] to God Amen is
[1:02:53] omnipotent prise the Lord then why can't
[1:02:55] you pray a prayer of
[1:02:57] faith
[1:03:00] amen did not Jesus say there in Mark
[1:03:02] 11:22 whatsoever things you say and
[1:03:05] don't doubt in your heart it'll come to
[1:03:08] pass
[1:03:09] you can have what you say
[1:03:13] Amen yes sir yeah but but you don't
[1:03:16] understand I'm going through a lot but
[1:03:17] you can have what you say praise the
[1:03:20] Lord I don't care how big the devil is
[1:03:22] quit dwelling on how big the devil is
[1:03:25] look at what God made you to be amen
[1:03:28] ain't that right see so what happens
[1:03:31] when two omnipotence meet when God and
[1:03:33] man comes together through omnipotence
[1:03:36] something's got to shake all right
[1:03:38] something's got to give see so
[1:03:41] whatsoever you would say with that
[1:03:43] creative power of omnipotence of God
[1:03:46] knowing that he's promised it right not
[1:03:51] wondering knowing he's promised it I I
[1:03:54] think it's good to know what God's
[1:03:55] promised for this age amen praise and he
[1:03:58] said it in his word it creates a power
[1:04:01] that goes out you and brings things to
[1:04:04] pass things that are not it makes them
[1:04:07] as though they are because two
[1:04:10] omnipotence have met God and His
[1:04:13] redeemed son have met thank you Lord
[1:04:17] Jesus Lord ain't that right yes sir and
[1:04:20] when God and a Believer meets there's
[1:04:22] two omnipotence because see man man is a
[1:04:24] part of God he's a Son of God and what
[1:04:27] little he is joins see with the uh uh is
[1:04:32] joined with the entire body so we we
[1:04:35] find see believe that what you said and
[1:04:38] a Christian is so marked that around him
[1:04:41] is an atmosphere a creative atmosphere
[1:04:45] and notice what a prophet says now
[1:04:47] prayer from a saint will go a million
[1:04:49] times higher than an angel because he's
[1:04:52] a son you have more more power with God
[1:04:55] than an angel would because you're a Son
[1:04:58] of God true ain't that right see so so
[1:05:02] he says see he says now I don't believe
[1:05:04] this sight of Eternity how will ever
[1:05:06] realize uh what what you are the church
[1:05:09] uh he said the position that you are
[1:05:11] that God has placed you Spirit-filled
[1:05:13] people you are sons of God praise the
[1:05:16] Lord and why an angel's a servant you're
[1:05:19] a son an angel can only bring you a
[1:05:22] message but you have to act see you're
[1:05:26] the actor on the scene you're the son
[1:05:29] the angels are servants to bring you the
[1:05:31] message and says here I brought this
[1:05:33] message for you to do so and so this is
[1:05:36] from the father I bring it to you that's
[1:05:38] all it is see but you are Sons and
[1:05:42] Daughters of God praise the Lord ain't
[1:05:45] that right so so we look at it today
[1:05:48] according to the scriptures and
[1:05:50] according to what we see in the age of
[1:05:52] that we're living in the angel of the
[1:05:54] Lord has given us the message in this
[1:05:57] day but we are the actors prise the Lord
[1:06:00] are you with me now we are the actors
[1:06:03] amen the message is here the mighty
[1:06:06] Angel according to Revelations 10:1 has
[1:06:08] come amen has descended with an open
[1:06:11] book in his hand so we're not waiting
[1:06:13] for the
[1:06:14] message hallelujah it's been
[1:06:17] given can can you say Amen so we have an
[1:06:21] open Vision so so we are not ident
[1:06:24] identified with the people that have no
[1:06:26] vision right ain't that right Proverbs
[1:06:30] 298 where there is no vision the people
[1:06:33] perish ain't that right but notice in
[1:06:36] habach habach uh 2 and 2 and the Lord
[1:06:39] answered me and said write the vision
[1:06:42] and make it plain upon tables that he
[1:06:46] may run that reth it can you say Amen so
[1:06:51] the vision has been made plain it is an
[1:06:54] open Vision the message says that we are
[1:06:57] Justified as though we never did it the
[1:07:00] message says that we have been pardoned
[1:07:03] the message says that we are the Eternal
[1:07:06] attributes of God manifested in this age
[1:07:10] the message says that since it is uh H
[1:07:13] uh uh we have been loosed by a perfect
[1:07:16] blood then it is a perfect loosening
[1:07:19] ain't that right amen the message says
[1:07:21] now the power of the believing Church
[1:07:24] Christ has all power in heavens and
[1:07:26] earth he said do you believe that well
[1:07:28] then what if he is in you amen what does
[1:07:31] that mean Christ in you the hope of
[1:07:33] glory Jesus is the one that said all
[1:07:35] heaven or all power in Heaven and Earth
[1:07:38] has been given unto me now that same God
[1:07:41] is inside of
[1:07:43] you then what does it mean then see all
[1:07:46] right he is the seed word in his body he
[1:07:50] in US becomes the seed word in US what
[1:07:54] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:07:57] and all that Christ was he poured into
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:03] church church the vision is
[1:08:06] open the message has been made clear
[1:08:09] amen yes sir so I say as the Apostle
[1:08:12] Paul
[1:08:13] run that you may obtain amen
[1:08:17] run Don't just run in circles don't just
[1:08:20] wander around the vision has been made
[1:08:22] plain all
[1:08:24] right praise the Lord can you say amen
[1:08:28] amen notice as we read the world knoweth
[1:08:31] us not because it knew him
[1:08:34] not now we are a people who know who we
[1:08:38] are we
[1:08:40] should by the open
[1:08:42] Vision the message
[1:08:44] coming God doesn't send an open open the
[1:08:47] word to us and then we just sit there in
[1:08:51] dilatory wondering what to do next
[1:08:53] you're the
[1:08:54] actors the Angel's done his
[1:08:57] part can you say Amen so we know who we
[1:09:01] are but the world doesn't know then see
[1:09:04] I I I if you don't know who you are I I
[1:09:07] pray this evening that that you could
[1:09:09] receive such an experience with God that
[1:09:12] you know yeah that you know who you are
[1:09:15] amen sure you can't pray the prayer
[1:09:17] faith without knowing who you
[1:09:19] are can you say amen and when you truly
[1:09:23] experience the love of God then then you
[1:09:26] know then then you can say as Paul said
[1:09:29] in Romans 8:35 who shall separate us
[1:09:31] from the love of Christ shall
[1:09:33] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:09:35] or famine or nakedness or Peril or swart
[1:09:38] see as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:09:40] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:09:42] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[1:09:44] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:09:48] through him that loved us for I'm
[1:09:50] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:09:52] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:09:55] nor things present or things to come nor
[1:09:57] height nor depth nor any other creature
[1:09:59] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:10:01] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:10:05] lord see it gives us confidence to know
[1:10:08] the love of God can you say Amen Faith
[1:10:12] worketh by love amen but the world
[1:10:15] knoweth us not therefore we should never
[1:10:18] base our prayers according to what the
[1:10:21] world thinks of us amen for knows us not
[1:10:25] neither knoweth it knoweth him not it
[1:10:28] knows him not knew him not and it knows
[1:10:31] us not so therefore our prayers cannot
[1:10:33] be conformed to what the world thinks of
[1:10:37] us can you say Amen they have no
[1:10:40] relationship with him for they know him
[1:10:42] not they know not the power of
[1:10:44] redemption for they know him not they
[1:10:46] know not the power of his blood they
[1:10:49] have not the promises available to
[1:10:52] them amen because they know him not
[1:10:56] yes true but if you've experienced his
[1:10:59] love then you know one thing that is
[1:11:02] brought to us is that we are sons of
[1:11:05] God praise the Lord I know people say
[1:11:08] well the lord loves me just as I am
[1:11:10] that's God's
[1:11:11] love I beg to differ he does love you
[1:11:14] the way you are but if his love has ever
[1:11:17] come upon you it'll transform you it'll
[1:11:20] change
[1:11:22] you amen right to me that's love amen
[1:11:26] that's the love of God takes me from
[1:11:28] what I was to what I am brings me closer
[1:11:32] to him makes me more like him yes sir
[1:11:35] for he predestinated us to be conformed
[1:11:37] to His Image amen not the way the devil
[1:11:40] wants us to be not the way a church
[1:11:42] wants us to be not the way a theologian
[1:11:44] wants us to be but the way God wants us
[1:11:46] to be and that's to be conformed in his
[1:11:49] very own likeness His Image right and
[1:11:51] he's the word that's right so you cannot
[1:11:54] judge God by how the world judges him
[1:11:57] because they know him
[1:12:01] not right true many
[1:12:05] many pulpits depict God as something
[1:12:09] weak that's why we have to depend upon
[1:12:11] politicians for our
[1:12:13] Victory on that's why churches members
[1:12:17] are going getting so involved in
[1:12:20] politics because it seemed like if they
[1:12:22] can get the right candidate then they're
[1:12:23] like will be more
[1:12:24] easier and it's the church's fault
[1:12:26] because they don't bring and cannot
[1:12:28] produce a powerful God a god of
[1:12:32] omnipotence but it doesn't matter what
[1:12:34] this world thinks God rules and he's
[1:12:38] omnipotent can you say Amen but the
[1:12:40] world knoweth him not so we should never
[1:12:43] conform our prayers to the prayers of of
[1:12:46] the world and and you must not see
[1:12:49] yourself as the world sees you for it
[1:12:51] knoweth you not either amen as sons of
[1:12:54] God they may look at you as a sinner but
[1:12:57] God looks at you as a son how can a holy
[1:13:00] God look at me as his son because he
[1:13:02] looks through the blood through the
[1:13:04] blood true ain't that right when he
[1:13:07] looks at you he sees you through the
[1:13:10] blood and he's confirmed that the blood
[1:13:12] is with on you he's confirmed it by
[1:13:15] giving you his own life his own
[1:13:18] spirit is that right amen so you're a
[1:13:20] son and daughter of God and this is why
[1:13:22] we are not to be conformed to this world
[1:13:24] as Paul would tell us but we are to be
[1:13:26] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:13:29] the world gropes in darkness and and are
[1:13:31] the children of Darkness but the Bible
[1:13:33] says we are the children of light and we
[1:13:35] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:13:38] amen as I get ready to close therefore
[1:13:41] we are a people of understanding yes
[1:13:43] amen we pray with understanding Paul
[1:13:46] would tell us we sing with understanding
[1:13:48] if I sing I'm going to sing with
[1:13:50] understanding if I pray I'm going to
[1:13:51] pray with understanding we worship with
[1:13:54] understanding we worship not knowing you
[1:13:57] know we we're not one that worships not
[1:13:59] knowing who we're worshiping to but but
[1:14:03] we have this
[1:14:05] understanding and and it's because we've
[1:14:07] been brought to him we we have seen him
[1:14:09] we know him for what he is we're not
[1:14:13] serving a god of our own imagination
[1:14:15] we're not the serving a god of someone
[1:14:17] else's
[1:14:18] imagination it's not a god of stone it's
[1:14:21] not a you know there there's a lot of
[1:14:22] heathens that work ship God a a god of
[1:14:24] stone a god of wood a god of of marble
[1:14:27] or some precious stone or or or whatever
[1:14:30] but a lot of people within the
[1:14:32] christiandom the rims of christiandom
[1:14:34] worship a god of their own
[1:14:36] imagination true
[1:14:39] amen and they prayed as
[1:14:42] such but I understand that as a Son of
[1:14:45] God I have been redeemed to every Divine
[1:14:48] promise amen that God has made amen can
[1:14:52] you say amen amen amen so then this
[1:14:56] understanding that I'm speaking of is
[1:14:57] not a childlike understanding but rather
[1:15:01] the understanding of a matured Son of
[1:15:03] God right totally different in the
[1:15:07] understandings yes sir I can't talk to
[1:15:10] my 8-year-old as I would my 25 24 26
[1:15:15] year
[1:15:17] old and as they grown and as they've
[1:15:22] matured then we become talking on a
[1:15:25] different level it becomes a different
[1:15:27] discussion right
[1:15:30] yes I don't I don't talk to an
[1:15:34] 18 and talk to her about
[1:15:39] Barbies now I used
[1:15:41] to because that was where her
[1:15:44] understanding was right but now you know
[1:15:47] I have to lecture her how she
[1:15:52] drives
[1:15:54] so Faith cometh by
[1:15:56] hearing or understanding the word praise
[1:16:00] the Lord as we close David understood by
[1:16:04] the word of the Lord as to who he
[1:16:06] was Lord he
[1:16:09] understood that that Goliath that was
[1:16:11] making his boast against the army of the
[1:16:13] Living God was already a defeated
[1:16:16] foe amen that's what he understood he
[1:16:19] understood that by the Covenant that God
[1:16:21] had made by the Covenant ain't that
[1:16:23] right shamard understood by the word or
[1:16:27] the Covenant that he was in or by the
[1:16:29] word that he was in the Covenant and
[1:16:31] that the enemy was powerless before him
[1:16:34] that's why he as one man could face what
[1:16:37] to could whip
[1:16:39] 600 well-trained men
[1:16:42] soldiers because he understood that he
[1:16:45] was greater because the Covenant was
[1:16:48] greater than just military training amen
[1:16:50] the Covenant that he was in was greater
[1:16:53] than just a natural man and he
[1:16:56] understood that therefore he could take
[1:16:58] and face and defeat 600 men yes sir amen
[1:17:03] Joshua and Caleb understood by the
[1:17:05] message of the hour and by the
[1:17:06] supernatural works that were being done
[1:17:09] through the prophet Moses ain't that
[1:17:12] right they understood that it was God
[1:17:13] leading them to the promised land they
[1:17:16] understood that the promised word was
[1:17:18] being fulfilled right before them and it
[1:17:20] gave them a faith they understood that
[1:17:23] no matter how many Giants was in the
[1:17:25] land they they understood that no matter
[1:17:28] how strong them wal cities were they
[1:17:30] would conquer every last one of them
[1:17:33] because they understood by the
[1:17:36] word can you say Amen they
[1:17:39] understood oh do you love him praise the
[1:17:42] Lord thinking of the prophet he says I'm
[1:17:44] he says now I'm I'm going away to pray
[1:17:46] get ready for healing service he said
[1:17:48] you can get the phones or whatever you
[1:17:50] wish to and bring any in anybody that
[1:17:52] you want to for this coming revival and
[1:17:54] tell them not not to come in a hurry now
[1:17:56] not not come and say well I'm going to
[1:17:58] run in and be prayed for tonight and
[1:18:00] tomorrow night and that it's all see you
[1:18:03] don't do that you come in and listen a
[1:18:05] while cuz we want to take our time and
[1:18:08] lay that word out so close that the
[1:18:11] devil won't even have one little speck
[1:18:14] of room to ever
[1:18:15] move and what did the prophet do night
[1:18:19] after night he laid that word out so
[1:18:23] clear and so plain to to to to where the
[1:18:26] people could see what was being done
[1:18:29] right before them can you say amen he
[1:18:31] was able to take that word and show them
[1:18:34] and to show us that what God was doing
[1:18:37] was fulfilling his word in this age can
[1:18:40] you say amen and after God see uh uh had
[1:18:44] confirmed the Covenant I I thought you
[1:18:46] know the Covenant that God made to
[1:18:47] Abraham amen what was it being done in
[1:18:50] this age it was God confirming the
[1:18:54] Covenant Amen to you and I of what he
[1:18:58] had promised Abraham now you know good
[1:19:01] and well that Paul talks about that we
[1:19:03] are the children of Abraham and that we
[1:19:05] are the true children of Abraham and
[1:19:07] that we are part of the
[1:19:11] Covenant ain't that right yes sir the
[1:19:14] natural the natural Seed of Abraham they
[1:19:17] they destroyed their enemy they they
[1:19:19] they had great great things that was
[1:19:21] done amen but now we are not just a
[1:19:24] we're not the natural seed we are the
[1:19:26] Royal Seed of Abraham and every promise
[1:19:30] every Divine promise amen God made
[1:19:34] belongs to you and I thank you Lord and
[1:19:36] what we have seen is God fulfilling that
[1:19:38] Covenant Amen in this day and brother
[1:19:40] Bram says after God had confirmed the
[1:19:42] Covenant or the Covenant was made
[1:19:44] manifest to him it gives Faith to the
[1:19:47] true sons of God the word gives Faith
[1:19:50] the breasted one see it does something
[1:19:53] to them when the word or when the
[1:19:55] Covenant is made manifest it gives Faith
[1:19:59] to the true sons of God can you say Amen
[1:20:03] so our understanding doesn't come from
[1:20:05] some theological amen reading and and
[1:20:08] discussion of the book to where we just
[1:20:10] all sit there and we're learning from
[1:20:12] our intellects well the Bible does say
[1:20:14] this and we're putting words together in
[1:20:16] the scriptures together and we wo wow he
[1:20:18] is awesome when he can get up there and
[1:20:20] put all this stuff together amen but
[1:20:22] that's not where we're at today we are
[1:20:24] getting our understanding by this word
[1:20:27] being fulfilled right before our
[1:20:30] eyes what a greater understanding
[1:20:32] Hallelujah bless the Lord a greater
[1:20:35] understanding can you say amen God can
[1:20:38] do nothing greater to make the vision
[1:20:41] plain to us than coming down himself in
[1:20:45] this day yes and confirming the Covenant
[1:20:49] to
[1:20:50] us all you have to do is
[1:20:54] believe if the musicians will come amen
[1:20:57] do you love the Lord yes brother Bram
[1:21:00] said now you that's got strength enough
[1:21:01] to yield a
[1:21:03] sword now that you've got understanding
[1:21:05] enough in God's word to claim it to be
[1:21:07] your personal property right what is
[1:21:12] that our
[1:21:13] understanding what is the understanding
[1:21:16] that we've got to take this word and
[1:21:19] claim it to as our personal property
[1:21:22] prise Lord every Divine
[1:21:24] promise of this
[1:21:26] age now we're not in a hurry right now
[1:21:28] we're not in a
[1:21:30] hurry every Divine promise that God made
[1:21:35] our understanding is becoming more clear
[1:21:38] and more
[1:21:40] clear that it is our personal
[1:21:45] property then we can pray the prayer of
[1:21:49] faith that's right knowing who has has
[1:21:52] redeemed us right knowing the god that
