was confessed to one and all that the spirit is willing but the flesh is often we things I sh should do I don't things I say I will I won't but my God's begun a work in me that'll one day be complete and I know I'm not the man that I ought to be many times I fall short of what you want in me and I'm surely not the man I really want to be but thank God I'm not the man I used to [Music] be just like Paul of old I keep pressing for the goal forgetting all the things that lay behind but instead I'll look ahead and I'll go where I'm LED toward the mark for the prize that will be mine and I know I'm not the man that I ought to be many times I fall short of what you want in me and I'm surely not the man I really want to be but thank God I'm not the man I used to be and I know I'm not the man that I ought to be many times I fall short of what you want in me and and I'm surely not the man I really want to be but thank God I'm not the man thank God I'm not the man yes thank God I'm not the man I

sky don't let your trials get you down or drive your spirit into the ground Mount up with wings little Le go and fly amen how many Eagles do we have here tonight amen the uh musicians can be dismissed if you want to turn to your Bibles amen I I count it an honor and a privilege to to stand before you again to uh to uh bring you uh what's on my heart and um I pray it can be a blessing to you tonight uh Genesis uh 24 this might seem an maybe a little odd scripture to open up on um but um I pray that you would um pray the Lord would just bless tonight uh Genesis 24 verse2 and the Lord our Andy said oh Lord God uh of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down the piter I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant I Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou Hast showed kindness unto my master if we could also turn to Ephesians Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1 ver3 says blessed be the Lord God and Father uh of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will if we could read maybe verse four again according to he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen can we just bow our heads for a moment dear heavenly father Lord we humbly come before you again Lord asking that you would just move in a special way tonight father I pray that you would help me move myself out of the way Lord that you would just speak through me Lord and Lord I pray that you would bless your people tonight Lord I pray that you would give them ears to hear that they would receive father Lord tonight Lord we just love you and we thank you Lord for all that you've done may you have your way as our prayer in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated I uh I've had this thought on my heart for a little while now um it's a vast subject um so I'm I'm just not even going to scrape the surface um of what um is really so much to say um but if you would just bear with me I'm going to take a minute and I'm going to try and build a a foundation and maybe um it'll all make sense in the end but um but uh in many things in life you know we uh we are given a choice and the way of life itself is a choice we have a right to make our own way we choose our own way that we want to live our daily life is determined by our decisions by our choices um education is a choice uh we decide um what we're going to be educated by we're going you know we decide um where we choose or we choose uh where we're going to be educated on what college to go to or what university whether it be Virginia Tech or whether it be um in Arizona or somewhere else it's a choice that we have to make and those choices are determined to make our lives a better person um we make these choices to because we wouldn't want to make a choice that would maybe degrade ourselves if that would make sense we want to do the best for ourselves and uh you know so you know we decide you know what school what college you know we want to go to we also decide um you know if you don't want to go to college you decide what job you got to take and during that you know you decide whether you're going to be a um you know a fireman whether you're going to be a a police officer whether you're going to be a a construction worker or uh pumping sewer tanks or you know it's a choice that you have to make and you know we we also have a decision even on what we want to wear in the mornings we have a decision on where what we want for lunch what we want for breakfast so our whole lives is determined by what we choose on that day what car to drive you know whether it be a um a minivan or some of us don't have that choice but to drive drive some of those but um you know our our our decisions um determine what we're going to be and you know right and wrong is a choice every man and woman brother brandham says boy or girl has to choose whether they are going to live right or whether they're going to live wrong and it's a choice brother Brandon says choice is a great thing choice choice is a great thing and there's another choice that we all have to make and this is kind of where I want to get into a little bit now is um a a choice that we have to make in life and that is our life companion we have to have a choice on who we're going to spend the rest of our lives with and a young man or a young woman stepping out in life has been given a right to make a choice the young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman they have a right to choose and you know brother Brandon says the natural types the spiritual and then the choosing of a bride in the natural is the same is a type of choosing the bride in the spiritual you know a god choosing a bride and we read where uh elizer Abraham sent elzer out to find a bride for Isaac and uh now it's very serious uh when a man chooses his wife because it's until death do us part uh there's no separation and and man in his right mind that's planning a future he should choose that wife very careful because she reflects who he is amen he she reflects who that man is and brother brandham says the kind of woman that a man would choose will ref uh excuse me will reflect his ambition and his character if a man chooses the wrong woman it reflects his character and what he ties himself to shows truly what's in him a woman reflects what's in the man when he chooses her for a wife it shows what's down in him no matter what he says on the outside watch what he marries amen so uh and there's a lot of men out there today who are only looking for beauty and a woman they're only looking for uh uh maybe they they find a celebrity they they uh think is just beautiful and so they're going to go after that woman just because of her good looks and you know some some men you know who uh they see that they're wealthy see the parents are wealthy so they're going to try to go in for her just for the money and um and you know but a true man is going to look for character it don't matter how pretty she is it don't matter you know whether she's rich or whether she's poor uh he's going to look at her character and um you know it's the uh uh uh uh brother brandham says another place um he says I think today what's going so many uh divorces cases now that we lead the world in in America in divorce cases America leads the world in divorce cases we lead the rest of the world there's more divorces here than anywhere else in this nation and supposed to be uh and thought of a Christian Nation what a reproach our divorce court I think the reason of it is is because that men has got away from God and women has gotten away from God and if he said that back in ' 65 how many many more uh marriage cases do we have uh divorce cases do we have today and uh but a true man will seek a wife with character seek a wife that will raise their kids in the way maybe that the Bible that the that the message that the teaches and you know uh me looking uh you know when I married my wife you know I I uh there's a lot of pretty girls out there you know um there's a lot of uh beauty queens out there that um you know I I thought I was there was a there was a girl in another state that I thought for sure I was going to marry but I was looking at her in the wrong you know makes sense in the wrong way she was she was beautiful and I didn't look at her character and uh you know so so you know when I was searching I just didn't want anyone and you know I prayed desperately I I didn't want anyone that would go behind my back I didn't want anyone that would if I told my kids know on one thing soon as I leave Mama comes in and tells him well you don't have to listen to Daddy didn't want that I didn't want to have to watch my wife continually I didn't want to have to keep an eye on her all the time I want her to you know that she could be free that she could just she can uh set her home the way she would like to set her home you know in in a Godly Manner and uh you know and when I found my wife I I seen that there was something in her that was more than just uh uh the the the world out here there was something in here more there was something in her that uh reflected something different there was something that caught my eye I know growing up dad always told us he says you know he says you know you make a list write a list on what you want out of a woman and and he says and God will meet that list and uh so I so I did I wrote out what I wanted out of a woman I want her to um to be a lot like my first Mom I wanted her to be a lot like Heather I wanted her to be uh a creative I I I had a lot and I had high expectations and uh so but but I I I told the Lord I said well this is what I want and and uh Lord you're going to have to bless and you know when he brought me my wife it met every every little list yeah sure we have our our disappointment sure we have our our little spat sometimes but I love my wife and and uh uh uh that's that's who I'm married amen and um so so we have a choice on on whether we want just some some sex Queen out there whether we just want some pretty woman out there whether we just want someone just to have a good time or or whatever or we can or we can get someone that will reflect who we really are someone that's going to reflect our our our Ambitions amen and and uh so uh uh and and someone um you know I didn't want you know my wife to to be able to you know she would just sneak around and just go around and and just do her own thing and me doing my own thing but no that we had to we had to have a connection there and and see and that's the same thing with God is he didn't come looking for a bride that resembled the world he didn't want something that didn't resemble who he really was he didn't want something that resembled uh uh the things of the world the the church world he wanted something that was going to reflect his character amen he didn't come looking for a bride that was caught up in this religion or that religion and or or brother Bram called it uh de denominational prostitute and uh so so see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and um but she has to be the same kind of character as he is amen so before before he made man he called himself Elohim the word means in the Hebrew the self-existent one all by himself nothing existed before him he was all that existed there ever was self-existence one Ella um el el Allah Elohim means the alls sufficient all powerful allmighty self-existence one see he wasn't even God yet for the word god means an object of worship and and Elohim was an attribute to be God in him was to be a God so so he created the angels and there was something there to worship him and then then he became God and but in God was also to be a savior there but there was nothing lost in him was to be a Healer but there was nothing to heal in him was to be a provider but there was uh nothing to provide for and God uh wanted to express all that he was into someone into his bride amen so God being the logos the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was God so God being the word said let us make man in our own image and God being a spirit then created uh spirit man Adam after his own likeness Adam then took on the nature of God Amen Adam then could have fellowship with God he was holy as God was holy he was he was made to be a Lesser God he had dominion over the Earth brother bham says but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am uh uh yaha Jehovah uh what did it mean I am the all exist one who has created something of off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateure little one of mine Oh Glory why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family amen El eloh Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family amen but you know Adam being in his perfect state but God seen that he was alone go God seen that that Adam was that was alone so what did he do he created a help meate for Adam and and out of Adam not another creation but out of Adam he took the out of the original creation God took a a bride out of Adam a bride for Adam amen Genesis 2: 21 says and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed the Flesh in uh flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones this is Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh amen she became one with him she was then a part of him she was Adam amen they were both named Adam because she was taken out of him she become him you know as our pastor was saying this morning God separated that God gave the masculine to to the male and gave the feminine part to the the female but they were both one all of that was with within Adam Adam had both male or masculine and feminine in in him so when God took that rib out you know not out of another creation God God God took that out of out of Adam and separated the two so they become one flesh amen and brother brandham says now the first man and the first woman in the Garden of Eden was the perfect har was in perfect harmony with God yes so much that God could come down at that time he desired and talked lip to ear with Adam and Eve now that is perfect Oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so in perfect harmony with God till they were one with God and his family was one amen they lived in such Perfect Harmony that they were one with God but then what happened there came sin amen and what does Sin do sin separates uh sin causes a separation between God and man and When sin came in only then did it cause a separation between God and Adam and and then Adam be Adam took on that Fallen nature so everyone since then has been born with a fallen nature everyone since then has been subject to the things of the world subject to their own ideas subject to this subject to that because now they have taken on a Fallen nature a nature that is not of God Amen so there had to be an atonement made there had to be something to bring us back to in fellowship with God again and so there had to be something that would bring us back to the full manif manifestation of the word there had to been something that could bring us back into Oneness with God Amen see Cain had his own thoughts but didn't line up with the word Cain had his own ways of doing things yeah Cain was just as religious as as Abel was he was he paid his tie he went to church but God couldn't accept his sacrifice because it didn't line up with what god with the original word if that makes sense amen it wasn't what the word says but what did god require God required the blood and not just any blood not a sex cell that there had to come the but there had to come an original word there had to come born of a virgin amen there he couldn't come the way that you and I came he couldn't come uh through the desires of a husband and wife but he had to come in in such a way that that this blood cell wouldn't be contaminated it had to come in in such a way that it would stay pure that it would stay holy and there was no man that could come there was no human being that could come and bring us back to God so what did God have to do God had to come himself God had to come in the form of a man and form of a baby and come and bring us back to God Amen and there was no one worthy there was no one that could take our place but he made us worthy he he come in the form of man God in the form of a man God said he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle and before the foundation of the world he had you in his mind before there was ever a Sunrise before there was ever a sunset before there was ever a cloud in the sky God had you in his mind before there was ever a molecule God had you in his mind and the only way you was going to come back to God was he had to come himself he had to come in himself to bring you back into fellowship with him amen that just it just makes me so excited that he would that he would think of me nobody that he would just would come and that he would want to Des that he would desire to have fellowship with me amen just like uh you know uh sin causing that separation you know uh me and my wife we wouldn't be able to have a fellowship together if there was a wall between us if there was a wall there if there was something that was said or if there someone got mad or something then what would happen there come a wall of separation and and you know she would do her thing and then you know I would do my thing and then the whole time a wall of separation standing in between us and but you know we could never be happy we could never uh enjoy each other's Fellowship we could never uh come together in Oneness again because of that wall of separation so what has to happen that wall of separation has to come down and that's what happened was sin caused that separation between us and God God we couldn't get back to God we couldn't reach God but then God had to come down himself and tear down that separation amen so in for in order for us to have Fellowship we had to get rid of the separation you know whether it was just buying her some flowers whether it was whatever it might be uh we had to to uh have Oneness again amen and that's what we needed today we have fallen race of Adam we needed a Redemption and so he sent his son Jesus Christ the word to redeem us back to him and there are a lot of people today trying to uh come back to God by just shaking the preacher's hand they're trying to come back to God by just doing their good works oh you know they they have their potlucks and they have their with their Community they have their uh you know their little bible studies and they they give to the poor they they uh go to their Bible schools they become Scholars but the word can't fully manage manifest itself in them you know the moment the word comes forth what do they do they shoot it down with their own ideas they shoot it down with her own thoughts and um you know that God can't have preeminence in that amen God can't have preeminence in his word and someone who just wants to do their own thing yeah amen amen amen do you love the Lord amen so so uh uh you know the moment the word comes forth they want to shoot it down and they start to compromise they're scared going to to offend somebody but God is looking for someone of his character God is looking for someone who's going to uh surrender everything that's within them to to uh God is looking for someone that's not going to back down God is looking for someone who's not going to compromise with the word someone who can stand and say Amen to every word of God you say well I'm not worthy but the blood has made you worthy Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and no man can come unto me unless the father first draws him so that little tug for God Isn't just something that you've that you've Merit yourself that little tug from God is calling you to him Amen brother brandham says by forn knowledge the infinite God who knowed all things saw the lamb and he slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world and he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he seen the deceitfulness of Satan what he would do so he put your name on there and he said that the Antichrist would be so religious so good such a fine fellow such a smart man such a religious man that he would deceive the very elect if it were possible but it isn't possible because their names were for ordained before the foundation of the world by election he chose them and by predestination they know where they are going there you are he says amen aren't you thankful for predestination aren't you thankful that he for ordained you he foresaw you in the beginning that you were in him before the foundation of the world you were part of him before the foundation of the world Amen he didn't we didn't do anything within ourselves to Merit salvation we didn't do anything to deserve it but by the grace and for knowledge of our Lord and savior he knew that we would want to accept it someday he knew that we would want it he knew that we would want this message so he preordained you to it you say well my life is just a wreck and I've done uh this and I've done that but it word says you never sinned in the first place his word says you never did it in the first place when you receive the Holy Ghost when you receive your pardon you are sealed till the day of your Redemption amen that's why we can sing that's why we can shout that's why we can dance is that's why we can say Amen to every word because the bride knows what it means to be redeemed the bride knows where she's going the bride knows what it's like to be free amen she stands before him pure as he is pure holy as he is Holy amen he has redeemed us back to God by his blood yes amen I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ yes sir like the little Eagle in the barnyard you know that little Eagle was always an eagle he was born an eagle no matter how many times he tried clucking around like a chicken no matter how many times he tried stomaching their food when he heard Mama's call that was it that was good enough for him he knew right then and there where he belonged when he he knew he was different he knew he he you know he knew he couldn't cluck just right he knew he couldn't you know walk just right and oh that he was the Laughing stalk of all the chickens and he knew that there had to been something different why was he this way why was he that way but when he heard Mama scream he knew that there was something greater there was something beyond the the chicken yard amen there was something beyond the graveyard amen and the next thing you know maybe he began to stretch his wings oh they made sure he knew the days of Miracles was passed oh they made sure to tell him that oh that was just brother brenham's opinions but he didn't pay them no attention he knew there was a higher calling amen he knew who he was he knew there was something Beyond man's ideas and man's Creeds amen he but when he heard the call he put his faith into action he set his wings to The Winds of faith and he flew higher and higher until the the barard Disappeared prise God Amen and that's the same thing with us today they took Luther's message and twisted it they took Wesley's message and twisted it and there's a lot of eagles sitting amongst them that there's got to be something more there's got to be something there's just got to be something different and man you know what that just don't sound right you know that that's just wasn't what uh Luther said that just wasn't what uh Wesley said and here they begin to twist here they begin to pull this idea and pull that idea and but when he heard Mama scream amen uh he sent a message in this day that and let out a big scream and came out and said come out of her my people come out of that filth of that denominational ideas come out of Egypt amen there's a l land I've prepared for you prise God Amen I see people today are trying to get the word to fit them and what they think to fit their ideas instead of getting themselves to fit the word that's that's what our issue is a lot of our issues today it's people don't want to change themselves to fit what the word says true amen you can't change the word you have to form yourself to the word yes amen and Christ being the unadulterated word can't be married or identified to an idea that wasn't so from the beginning amen there were had there we were made for Christ brother brandham says not Christ made for us uh we were made for Christ and we can only become one with God our Heavenly bridegroom by the word amen he's making himself known to us by his word amen Galatians 1:8 says but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we preached unto you let him be accursed yes as we said before so I say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a curse you can't mix oil and water you can't mix the word with ideas that's contrary to God's word amen only through this message can Christ the bride Christ and the bride become one only through this message the original word only this pure word can Christ become one with his bride amen this message this message was our bridegroom's call amen do you believe that this message was our bridegroom's call and you say well well how can that well you know you say well you know how do we know that that's true how do we know that God called brother brandom to be our to be our our Prophet how do how do we know because it was Vindicated by God you know you take Moses says and you take balam for an example both of them were prophets brother brandham says because they were both called of God both met God both talked with God and both Spirit-filled the difference between Moses and balum is both Moses balam answered to a King answered to King BAC and Moses answered to God Moses had the pillar of fire with them proving that God was with them that God had chosen that generation amen B wanted balam to come and curse Israel and balam being a prophet of God sought the will of God so he did he did what he was supposed to as a prophet he sought the will of God to curse God's people so he went to God and said you know Lord can I curse your people you know and the Lord says no they're My Chosen generation leave them alone you know yeah and God said no they're you know they're my people but the prophet says that balam didn't like Israel see when I heard that that floored me I mean it really stomped me was God chose God had a prophet Moses and he had a prophet balum yeah and yet balum didn't like Moses he didn't like the children of Israel he didn't like God's chosen people yeah God Called balum to be his Prophet you know you know and when and when Bao offered balum a higher position he became greedy he began to compromise and it's the same it's the same thing today Matthew 24:24 says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show you great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible it shall deceive the very elect so just just you know as God LED Moses and Israel God's chosen generation through the Wilderness by the power uh by the pillar of fire and every step of the way so is it in this day that God is leading his chosen generation you and I for this day by the word through a prophet amen that Pillar of Fire didn't burn out when Moses got to Israel that Pillar of Fire didn't burn out when when they thought maybe they reached the promised land but that Pillar of Fire is still with the prophet today am me with his people today amen God was in God was pleased in so much that he had his picture taken with our Prophet to to let you and I know that this is the way that this is the truth that this is the life amen amen just as eleazer came and was looking for a bride for uh Isaac so our elaser came today pointing us to Jesus Christ pointing us to the something higher there is something greater than the than the chicken yard there's something greater than denominational ideas amen he's bringing us back brother Brandon was pointing us back to Jesus Christ back to the original word amen that's why we preach this message that's why we believe this message yeah praise the Lord amen God chose brother Brandon wasn't God right brother Brandon wasn't God but God spoke through a prophet he said his word comes through a prophet amen that's why we got that's why it's important to play the tapes every day it's important to to not just play them but to really listen to what he's trying to say and uh I was uh talking to a couple brothers and I just you know I I I was telling them I said man I just you know I wish I always believed this message I I did I believed it and I believe brother Brandon was our Prophet but you know I said in the just here just here um in the past couple years it just become so real to me of really why he came it's become so real to me I I told the brother last night I said I really wish I could just I could preach like you guys can preach cuz it's it's just something burning within me that just wants to say you know keep pressing on keep listening to the message it's going home time amen yes amen he's well pleased with you little bride he is 1 Peter 2:9 says but you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood a holy nation a particular people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light you're not a servant don't think you're ever a servant you are our child of God angels are servants but you are more important than an angel you are more powerful than an angel amen you are a son and daughter of God Amen you are the word bride you the bride this bride has thus saith the Lord amen amen you are a word bride and you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and you can watch it happen amen that's right when God made Eve he didn't take dirt and make another body he pulled her out of Adam so she was part of him and God pulled a bride not out of denominational not of out of man ideas but he but he pulled a pulled a bride out of himself he pulled a bride out of himself the word therefore we become a word bride she is thus saith the Lord Brother brandom says notice the bridegroom in the beginning was the word then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why must the bridegroom be the word manifest manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten she's she is just a smitten peace off of him there is the Masterpiece amen we are one with God Amen we are flesh of his flesh we are bone of his bone we are life of his life we have power of his power she is him amen God is for you little bride you are Priceless in the eyes of God Amen just as God he came out searching for a bride he wanted something character he wanted us that would produce who he is amen so he saw you in the foundation before the foundation of the world Amen knowing that you would be bone of his bone that you would be flesh of his flesh power of his power hallelujah amen if me as a human would do anything to protect my family if I would do anything to protect my child from harm do anything I can to make sure they're provided for to make sure that food that they have food to eat make sure they have water to drink make sure they have shoes on their feet make sure they have clothes on their backs a roof to live under if I a man would do that for my family what is God going to do for his family amen what is God going to do how much more does Our Father in Heaven care for you and me how much more does our bridegroom we care when we are in need Amen brother Bram says he will bankrupt Heaven he will bankrupt Heaven before he let his word go defeated he has never made a promise that he can't keep Isaiah 41:10 says fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen Thee I will help thee yay I will uph hold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen Psalms 37:25 says I have been young and now I'm old yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed of begging for bread he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed you are a blessed people you are a blessed generation amen God sees you Victorious God sees you ah pressing the battle God sees you as an overcomer God sees you Guiltless tonight God sees you reigning with him that's what God sees you yes God sees you as his own oh you may feel worthless but as the I I didn't give him the scripture if I can paraphrase it but who can find a virtuous woman her price is far more above rubies you are Priceless you are virtuous amen that's exactly God thought of you am I mean I bald like a baby when I read it but God thought of you before the foundation of the world he knew that you would want it he knew that you would want to be a part of him and most important he wanted you a part of him he had a choice he had a choice and he chose you he chose you to be a part of him he chose you to hear this message he chose you amen amen if the musicians will come praise the Lord Brother Brenham tells a story here that I wanted to share with you it's pretty lengthy so just uh just have to listen he says here not long ago in the city of Rome Rome is a great City for art and there had a school of art there and several of our American Young Folks go over there every year to take a a year or two's training in art to learn to paint a picture learn to paint pictures there was a group of young Americans came over here a few years ago as the story was told me and when they came over there they just went hogw when they're in Rome they they do as Rome does they get out and drink they strip themselves and everything else and carry on both boys and girls and there was a certain School scho and in this school this group of young Americans came over and every one of them almost did the same thing but one certain little girl she wouldn't tolerate it at all she stayed in at night time she read while she was uh while they were all out drinking daytime she worked she studied well she was just the laughing stock of the whole school and she kept herself like a lady conducted herself like a lady although there were young Roman boys and everything around trying to get her to go out she refused it no sir she stayed right with her lessons learning to draw and to paint rather and she stayed with it finally finally an old konian at the place kept watching her seeing she was so much different although he was a Roman Catholic kept watching her and how she conducted herself one evening the young girl in the park where the studio was why or the place where the they had school she walked out upon the campus and went up towards the top of the hill and the sun was setting and she was standing up there with her pretty clean face and her hair hanging down looking across the way towards the setting of the Sun the old konian was raking down there in the yard he kept watching the girl as he rake something just kept telling him go talk to her so he laid his rake down took off his old slouch hat walked up to where the young lady was and cleared up his throat and she turned around he said pardon me Miss she said yes certainly he said notice he had noticed she had been crying all the rest was out in a big spree for the night he said Madam I hope that you understand me in the right way I am just going to speak to you said you've been here most for over two years now and I've noticed the group that you've come with continually they're out on parties and coming all the time the uh coming in all the all times the night drunk and close half off them and everything but I noticed that you attend don't attend such parties in said I noticed that seemingly that that uh you were uh that you're always looking across the sea of an evening you walk up here and stand every evening you walk up here and stand here each evening and watch the sun go down and and said what what causes that says I'm an old man and I'm curious of knowing what causes the difference between you and the others she said yes sir she says I'm looking towards home when the Sun is setting she said across beyond that sun Yonder is my homeland she said in that Homeland there's a certain State and in that certain State there's a certain city and in that certain city there's a certain house and in that certain house as a certain boy says he too an an artist when I left to come over here I I pledged my my love to him we're engaged to one another she said no matter what any of the rest of them does that has nothing to do with me she says I promise to live true and right and she said I am longing for the day that when I feel myself on the top of the wings of a big plane that'll take me across the sea it set me down at the air airport where I'll meet him he's building a home and we'll live together in that land and said that's the reason I act the way I do I'm true to the promise that he made that that I made a boy I I'm true to a promise that I made a boy and he's true to the promise that he makes me says I hear him I hear from him now and then and I write to him and said corresponding with one another we're still holding our vows waiting for the day will meet brother brandom goes on and says how that would do for a real Christian to get away from the things of the world someday you talk about coming into the portal the wings of a dove he's coming for a bride one that don't fool around with the world or the things of the world she is washed in the blood of the Lamb she's pledged her she's pledged to her his uh her love to him only the love of the world is gone and dead to her the marriage of the Lamb has come and the bride has made herself fry I just I cried and cried when I read that the bride has made herself Freddy we're going to meet him some one of these days keep pressing the battle keep hanging on keep believing keep yourself pure keep yourself holy we're going to meet our creator one of these days that's right amen he promised it he says I I go away to prepare a place for you but I will come again and I will receive you to myself that where I am you will be there too amen are you thankful for that do you love the Lord aren't you glad he chose you in this day amen I know it just gets darker and darker as the day goes by but it just our our home is just it's just inight it's just it's just over it's

how they're alluring and and people are being taken every day but there's a bride with that same character of the word that that can say down deep in her heart there's none like him there's just none like him no matter what the devil has to offer and what shiny things and appealing things that he presents to us we can truly say there's none like him you know and it's it's because in this day he has Christ has revealed himself in such a special way thinking of the the men on the road to emus that just walking downhearted and sad and they were looking at Jesus in a day gone by and yet there was Jesus walking with them all along and they never recognized him but then he began to take him through all the scriptures concerning to himself and then he acted as though he was going to keep on walking as they turned in and they begged him to invited him to turn in and brother br said he must have done something the way he broke that bread the way he done something it opened their eyes and I believe with all of my heart he's done it again in this age he's opened our eyes amen we're no longer walking with him not knowing what he is and who he is but our eyes have been truly opened and we can truly say there's none like him do you love the Lord amen I I certainly love the Lord and you know uh brother brandom talking of um El eer going after Rebecca to get a bride for Isaac and you know he said he was asking the Lord you know what what is there what character in the word would fit me and he said he just he closed his eyes and he opened the Bible and he now he told us he said now don't don't do that um he said uh that's not the way we are to do it but but for him as a prophet he he just asked the Lord he said show me what what am I in the word what what would fit me my Ministry and he opened it up and he pulled his finger and it was el e are going to get a bride for Isaac and he said just a perfect message back to the word go get that bride and he said that's a duty and that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride amen and I'm so glad that we have that character to respond amen and um you see we don't need to this the way I look at it is we don't need to look at the Bible and just say God just show me who I am because God gave us a prophet we listen to a prophet and he'll tell you everything of who you are amen and the more we believe this Prophet we can understand exactly the characters that fit Us in the Bible can you say Amen you love the Lord did you enjoy it tonight appreciate Daniel delivering his heart to us amen and
