[40:22] my praise. Got a don my plan. Satan just
[40:26] can't stand when I throw up my
[40:30] hands. Amen. Did you come to praise the
[40:33] Lord this morning?
[40:35] [Applause]
[40:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what I do.
[40:42] I just throw up my hands. I can't fix my
[40:44] knees. Only God can. And um looks like
[40:48] maybe he's going to use medicine, but I
[40:50] just praise him anyway. Um uh have to
[40:53] use a walker. I just praise him anyway.
[40:56] Uh whatever I have to go through is
[40:58] nothing compared to what he went through
[41:00] for me. Uh so I just I just want to
[41:03] praise him. Uh and uh I I did want to
[41:06] share with y'all uh I I I work for I
[41:10] take care of a patient. She's
[41:12] 96 and uh bedridden now. But her family
[41:16] is precious to me. Um they have just the
[41:20] best atmosphere around them. They love
[41:24] God with all their hearts and um they
[41:27] wear dresses and and all that kind of
[41:29] good stuff. But um the last two
[41:31] Thursdays they've wanted me to go to
[41:34] their meeting and I think they're called
[41:36] friends. I think that's what they're
[41:38] they're called. And anyway, so I went
[41:42] and uh probably as close to uh Amish
[41:47] maybe. Uh no music. The I did not know
[41:51] the songs. none of them. They were that
[41:54] old. Uh and I and I I had no idea the
[41:57] words or anything, but
[42:00] um their
[42:02] ministers almost remind me of a
[42:04] therapist when they speak. You know,
[42:06] they're very softspoken and very you
[42:09] have to just strain almost to hear them.
[42:11] Sometimes I'm not making fun. God bless
[42:12] them. They're good people.
[42:14] But to come into this service after that
[42:17] service is
[42:20] just God's so real and and I have such
[42:23] compassion for them because they don't
[42:26] feel what we feel. They love him
[42:28] definitely, but they can't feel what we
[42:30] feel because they don't invite him in.
[42:33] They have their own little program, you
[42:35] know. It's it's it's got to stay this
[42:37] way. And anyway, I just I'm just
[42:40] thankful that we have the freedom and
[42:42] the wor to worship him. It just thrills
[42:44] my
[42:45] heart. This is my
[42:47] testimony. For many years he walked in
[42:54] darkness as he groped
[42:58] along the
[43:01] streets with his hand stretched out for
[43:08] pies or for just a bite to
[43:15] eat. It's the
[43:17] story of the blind
[43:21] man who met
[43:24] Jesus on the
[43:28] way. And with the
[43:31] master's touch, the man looked up as the
[43:37] scoffers heard him say.
[43:43] [Music]
[43:45] Somebody
[43:47] touch
[43:50] me.
[43:51] Somebody
[43:53] touched
[43:56] me. Oh, I was blind but praise his
[44:03] name. I now can't see.
[44:10] I was in
[44:13] [Music]
[44:15] darkness when Jesus
[44:18] found
[44:21] me. Oh, but since he's touched
[44:27] me, I now am free.
[44:33] [Music]
[44:36] One day he touched a crippled man and he
[44:42] made him walk
[44:47] again. And the master saw with
[44:53] pleasure he had labored not in vain.
[44:59] Now like the
[45:01] story of that blind
[45:05] man. Oh, I once was bound by
[45:11] sin. But since the master came, oh
[45:16] praise his dear name. Thank God I now
[45:22] can
[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] say
[45:27] somebody
[45:29] touched me. Oh
[45:32] hallelujah. Somebody
[45:35] touched
[45:38] me. You see I was blind. Oh, but praise
[45:43] his good
[45:44] name. I now can
[45:49] [Applause]
[45:50] see. I was in
[45:57] darkness where Jesus
[46:00] found
[46:02] me. Oh, but since he
[46:06] touched
[46:08] me, I now am
[46:13] free.
[46:15] Oh, I was in
[46:19] darkness.
[46:21] Hallelujah. Where Jesus
[46:24] found me.
[46:28] But since he
[46:30] touched
[46:33] me, I now am
[46:40] [Music]
[46:43] free. Oh,
[46:45] somebody touched
[46:48] me. Oh,
[46:51] somebody touched touched me.
[46:56] Oh,
[46:58] I praise his name. I now can
[47:06] see.
[47:08] Oh, I was in
[47:13] darkness. Oh, but Jesus
[47:17] touched
[47:18] [Music]
[47:21] me since he touched me.
[47:26] I now am
[47:29] free. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[47:32] of praise this morning? Amen. Where
[47:35] would I be if he hadn't touched me?
[47:39] Amen. Can we just stand to our feet?
[47:42] Let's sing uh one more song. Can we
[47:45] sing? Pass me not, oh Gentle Savior.
[47:48] Amen. Is that your cry this morning?
[47:51] Say, "Pass me not, oh Savior." Oh,

[49:50] mercy.

[52:13] is to say, Lord, just once more, just
[52:15] hear my humble cry. Amen. The musicians
[52:18] can be dismissed. Amen. It's it's just a
[52:21] real honor to be in the house of the
[52:23] Lord this morning.
[52:25] Amen. Can we just uh if we could turn to
[52:28] our Bibles there in Jeremiah the 29th
[52:34] chapter?
[52:38] Amen. It's a little chilly yesterday. It
[52:41] was kind of kind of felt nicer the past
[52:43] couple days.
[52:46] Um I I like cool weather. I don't like
[52:49] cold weather. I like cool weather. Amen.
[52:52] Jeremiah
[52:54] 29 verse
[52:58] 10. We'll also read in Luke 16 here in a
[53:01] minute. uh Jeremiah
[53:04] 29 verse 10 uh down through the to the
[53:07] 14th verse says for thus saith the Lord
[53:10] that after 70 years is accomplished at
[53:13] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[53:16] good work toward you and causing you to
[53:18] return to this place. Amen. Causing you
[53:23] to return to this place for I know the
[53:27] thoughts. Amen. In this place, brother
[53:29] Brandham says, is back to Pentecost.
[53:32] Amen. 11th verse says, "For I know the
[53:34] thoughts that I think toward you,
[53:36] sayaith the Lord. Thoughts of peace and
[53:39] not of evil to give you an expected end.
[53:44] Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall
[53:47] go and pray unto me, and I will hearken
[53:51] unto you, and ye shall seek me and find
[53:55] me, and ye shall search for me with all
[53:59] your heart. And I will be found of you,
[54:02] saith the Lord. I will turn away your
[54:06] captivity. I will gather you from all
[54:08] the nation from and from all the places
[54:13] whether I have driven you sayaith the
[54:14] Lord and I will bring you again into the
[54:18] place whence I caused you to be carried
[54:21] away and captive. So the 13th verse
[54:24] again says and you shall seek me and
[54:27] find me when you shall search for me
[54:30] when you when when when you look for me
[54:33] search for me with all your heart. Amen.
[54:36] Can we go to
[54:37] Luke now to uh Luke
[54:42] 16?
[54:50] Amen. If you're there, say
[54:52] amen. Amen. Luke 16 verse 16 says, "The
[54:57] law and the prophets were until John.
[55:01] Since that time the kingdom of God is
[55:03] preached and every man
[55:07] presseth into it. Amen. Every man
[55:12] presses into it. Amen. Brother Brandham
[55:14] says, "Not just simply walks into it."
[55:17] Amen. Easily, but it's got to be pressed
[55:20] into. When you seek me with all your
[55:22] heart, then I'll be found. Amen. Can we
[55:25] just bow our heads for a moment?
[55:27] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you
[55:30] for the reading of the word, Lord, this
[55:31] morning. And Father, I pray that you
[55:34] would just have your way, Lord, I pray
[55:36] that you would help me move myself out
[55:38] of the way, Lord. I pray that you would
[55:40] just come down and speak through me,
[55:42] Father. Lord, I I pray, Lord, that your
[55:45] uh word would just rest in the hearts of
[55:47] your people this morning, Lord. We love
[55:50] you. We thank you. And we ask it all in
[55:52] your lovely name, Jesus Christ. And the
[55:54] church says, "Amen." And you can be
[55:58] seated. Amen. I just like to take a a
[56:02] few moments here and um if I could uh
[56:05] give a title this morning, I'd like to
[56:08] uh maybe title it
[56:10] desperation. Amen. Brother Brandon
[56:13] preaches the message uh desperation in
[56:15] 63. And uh that's where I've I got this
[56:19] the the message from there. And I I
[56:21] believe he only preached it or he at
[56:23] least titled it uh one time. uh
[56:26] desperation and he uses these two
[56:28] scriptures we just read and uh and I
[56:31] just want to take a few minutes and
[56:32] speak to you on this but brother
[56:34] Brandham says here in the message
[56:36] desperation usually it takes a state of
[56:39] emergency to throw us into desperation.
[56:42] It's too bad it has to do that but human
[56:44] beings are so slothful in their mind
[56:47] that it takes an emergency. something
[56:49] arises and when they do then it throws
[56:52] them into that desperation and really in
[56:55] doing that in desperation it brings out
[56:57] the real thing that you are. It shows
[57:00] what you're made of in that time of
[57:02] desperation. It usually pulls out all
[57:05] the good things that's in you. Amen.
[57:08] Now, now we, you know, we've seen it
[57:10] happen many of times and I know we all
[57:12] have. Uh but in the time of death, uh
[57:15] you know, we we we we've heard people
[57:17] when they know that they're dying and
[57:20] and the things that they've kept secret
[57:22] all their life, you know, in
[57:24] desperation, they're they're they're
[57:26] trying to confess it, you know, they
[57:28] they'll keep it a secret all their life,
[57:30] but when they're on the deathbed, then
[57:32] all their secrets come out and and uh
[57:35] and see in desperation, Amen. Brother
[57:38] Brandham says they ought to have done
[57:39] that beforehand and not wait till a time
[57:41] of emergency. But the emergency causes
[57:45] desperation and we ought to do it
[57:48] without the emergency. Amen. Now, we
[57:50] notice tonight, Brother Brandham says
[57:52] that we're taking the symbols of the
[57:54] Passover. And the Passover was taken in
[57:56] emergency in times of desperation. Amen.
[58:00] You notice in Exodus 12:11, Amen. And it
[58:03] says, "And thus shall ye eat it with
[58:06] your loins girded, your shoes on your
[58:08] feet, and your staff in your hand, and
[58:11] ye shall eat it in haste. It is the
[58:13] Lord's Passover." Amen. See, they're
[58:16] eating it in desperation. Amen. They had
[58:19] seen the great hand of God. They had
[58:21] they had seen all the miracles. They
[58:23] seen all the things that God has done.
[58:25] And they had come under the sign of the
[58:28] token. And while they were under the
[58:30] sign of the token, they've uh taken the
[58:33] communion in desperation, for they knew
[58:35] at that time God was fixing the strike
[58:38] with judgment. Amen. They knew that a
[58:40] time of of judgment, a time uh was at
[58:44] hand, that that they came under
[58:47] desperation.
[58:48] Amen. And it was a shaking time for
[58:51] them. Amen. And it was a time where
[58:53] every man would must examine himself
[58:56] because the word of the prophet had not
[58:58] failed one time. Amen. It had been
[59:01] proven to be true. Whatever he said, it
[59:03] happened just exactly the way he said
[59:05] it. Amen. I want you to notice this.
[59:07] Now, the pillar of fire was still there.
[59:10] And then the prophet had announced that
[59:11] God would only pass over when he saw the
[59:14] token at the door. And it was
[59:16] desperation. Amen. There caused it
[59:19] caused a desperation. And brother
[59:20] Brandham says, "I would imagine the
[59:22] children were when they saw those big
[59:24] black wings dropped down from the sky
[59:26] like smoke settling over the city, the
[59:28] the screams coming from every house, the
[59:31] children might have went to their daddy
[59:33] and said, "Daddy, are you sure that
[59:35] we're under the token?" And he could go
[59:37] to the door and look upon the post.
[59:40] Amen. And upon the little and said,
[59:42] "Son, that's according to his word.
[59:45] Remember, I'm the oldest child, daddy.
[59:47] Remember, I'm your oldest. and and are
[59:49] you sure? Are you positive? Amen. He
[59:52] come under desperation and then his dad
[59:54] could stand there and say, "Son, I am
[59:56] positive." That's according to what the
[59:58] prophet had told us. Amen. And he has
[1:00:01] the word of the Lord says, "When I see
[1:00:03] the blood, I'll pass over you." Amen. He
[1:00:06] says, "Take a lamb for the house. I
[1:00:08] brought it all you children in. I
[1:00:10] brought all you children in. You're my
[1:00:11] oldest. You're my firstborn. That's the
[1:00:13] one that's dying out there." Amen. Uh
[1:00:16] you can hear all them crying out there.
[1:00:18] You can hear all them, all the oldest of
[1:00:20] the children out there dying. And I
[1:00:22] brought you uh your children in. Amen.
[1:00:25] And that's the one that's dying. But
[1:00:26] there is a blood and that's what thus
[1:00:29] saith the Lord was. So rest, my son.
[1:00:32] Just rest at ease. Because God made the
[1:00:35] promise. And he could say, "Well, daddy,
[1:00:38] why are you got your shoes on? Why you
[1:00:40] got your staff in your hand? Why have
[1:00:42] you got a piece of bread in one hand and
[1:00:44] a lamb in the other? Why is the them
[1:00:47] bitter herbs and things? What are you
[1:00:49] eating? Why are you eating it? And and
[1:00:51] what's the sweat running off your face
[1:00:53] about, son? Death is fixing fixing to
[1:00:56] strike. And brother Brennham says, she
[1:00:59] it was a time of
[1:01:01] desperation. Oh my. Now, I believe that
[1:01:04] we're living in the days that we should
[1:01:06] that that we're living in. We it should
[1:01:08] cause the church to come under
[1:01:10] desperation. Amen. We see all the signs.
[1:01:13] We've seen all all the the the the
[1:01:15] things our prophet h has spoke about
[1:01:18] years ago come to pass today. And it
[1:01:21] should cause us to come under in great
[1:01:24] desperation this morning. Amen. We've
[1:01:26] played long enough. We went to church
[1:01:28] long enough. We've got something to do.
[1:01:31] Amen. And how is it that we can see
[1:01:34] great signs and wonders done in others?
[1:01:36] But but what about us? Amen. How is it
[1:01:38] that we can we can see great signs and
[1:01:41] it should cause us to come uh under
[1:01:45] desperation. Amen. That we're determined
[1:01:48] before God. Amen. The signs of his
[1:01:51] coming when we've read it from the word
[1:01:53] and hear a prophet speak about it and
[1:01:55] and we've watched it come to pass in
[1:01:57] this day and in this hour. Amen. It
[1:01:59] should cause this entire congregation to
[1:02:02] come unto
[1:02:04] desperation. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:02:07] says, "And then at the end of the
[1:02:08] preaching, the the the see the action of
[1:02:10] the great Holy Spirit, see God come down
[1:02:13] visible before the people. We see God
[1:02:16] working." Amen. We we even see we even
[1:02:19] have the picture. Amen. Showing uh that
[1:02:22] it's not just a man that it's not just a
[1:02:24] preacher. It's not just a sung leader.
[1:02:26] It's it's not just a the leoty in the
[1:02:29] church. It's it's not just a just a
[1:02:31] certain group of people or congregation.
[1:02:34] Amen. But it's now embodied in the holy
[1:02:37] in the bride of the in the body of his
[1:02:40] bride. Amen. And it should throw us into
[1:02:43] desperation.
[1:02:45] Amen. Now in Egypt, Amen. those people,
[1:02:49] they had seen the hand of God. Amen. The
[1:02:52] children of Israel had seen the hand of
[1:02:54] God. And that night of the communion,
[1:02:56] they took it in desperation because they
[1:02:59] know that something was fixing to
[1:03:01] happen. Amen. And we know that something
[1:03:03] is fixing to happen today. Amen. We know
[1:03:06] that something is fixing to happen.
[1:03:08] Remember the coming of the Lord will be
[1:03:10] sudden. Amen. The secret going away.
[1:03:12] He'll come and take her like a thief in
[1:03:14] the night. Amen. And to think that if
[1:03:17] somebody all of a sudden there is
[1:03:19] members of our family gone and you're
[1:03:21] left behind, it should throw us into
[1:03:23] desperation that that that by the grace
[1:03:25] of God will not be left behind. Oh my.
[1:03:30] Oh my desperation. Brother Brandham
[1:03:33] talks about a man from New Albany there.
[1:03:35] He says uh had a little boy and he said
[1:03:38] this man had a little boy. I believe his
[1:03:39] wife had
[1:03:41] cancer once and was healed and now the
[1:03:44] little boy had got it and and was just
[1:03:46] in bad shape. Amen. But the man didn't
[1:03:48] stop there. The man didn't just say,
[1:03:50] "Oh, well uh well that poor little that
[1:03:53] poor little boy, you know, but it threw
[1:03:57] the man into desperation." Amen. When
[1:04:00] the wife was about to die with cancer,
[1:04:02] he know that God could heal her. And if
[1:04:04] God can heal the wife, then God can heal
[1:04:07] the boy. Amen.
[1:04:09] Desperation. Oh my. Brother Bham says,
[1:04:11] "See, you must come." And when you're
[1:04:14] desperate, then God is going to listen
[1:04:17] to you. But if you're just slothful and
[1:04:19] you don't care whether he does it or
[1:04:21] not, and well, that's that's different.
[1:04:23] And you say, "Uh, you do."
[1:04:26] But it takes desperation to do it. Oh
[1:04:30] my. The reason we don't have desperation
[1:04:32] is because we lack the love of God. Oh
[1:04:36] my. The reason we don't have
[1:04:38] desperation. We lack the love of God.
[1:04:41] Amen. The love of God causes
[1:04:43] desperation. You say, "Well, I I thought
[1:04:45] we were to have faith." Amen. Yes, that
[1:04:47] is true. We are to have faith. In
[1:04:49] Galatians 5:6, breaking in faith which
[1:04:53] workketh by love. Faith workketh by
[1:04:57] love. Amen. And the only way that you
[1:04:59] can have faith is to have love first.
[1:05:02] Amen. And if you don't have love, you
[1:05:04] can't have faith. Amen. If we can ever
[1:05:06] get the love of God in our hearts, it'll
[1:05:09] throw us into desperation. Amen. We
[1:05:12] should have such a burden for lost
[1:05:13] souls. We should have such a burden to
[1:05:15] see our family saved. and we to see our
[1:05:18] family be healed to see our family be
[1:05:20] delivered to to to to
[1:05:22] [Music]
[1:05:23] to and to cause us to come under
[1:05:26] desperation that we won't rest until God
[1:05:28] does something. Amen. A state of
[1:05:31] desperation. Amen. How can you have
[1:05:34] faith in your wife? Brother Brandham
[1:05:36] says if you don't love her. Amen. That's
[1:05:39] filio love. How about agel love to God?
[1:05:42] How can you have faith if you don't love
[1:05:43] God? If you said you loved your wife and
[1:05:46] you never tell her about it, never sat
[1:05:48] down and make love to her, expressed it
[1:05:49] to her, kiss her, hug her and tell her
[1:05:51] she's the most she's the best cook in
[1:05:53] the country and and how pretty she is
[1:05:55] and how much you love her. If you don't
[1:05:56] do that, she'll never know it. If you do
[1:06:00] love her, you will express it. Amen.
[1:06:03] That's the way we do to God. When we
[1:06:05] love him, we we tell him about him. We
[1:06:07] sit down, we adore, and we worship him.
[1:06:11] And see, love drives us to do that.
[1:06:14] Amen. Now, what if something has got uh
[1:06:16] what if something was done to your wife?
[1:06:19] Why did it throw you into desperation to
[1:06:21] get it done? Oh my. What if the doctor
[1:06:24] says your wife's got cancer and she's
[1:06:25] fixing to die, yet you'll do anything.
[1:06:28] See, it'll throw you into desperation.
[1:06:31] And that's the same thing with God. We
[1:06:33] must have love before we can have faith.
[1:06:36] Amen. When we have genuine love, what
[1:06:38] does it do? that pushes our faith out in
[1:06:41] the battlefront for God. See, genuine
[1:06:43] godly love uh for God and for his word
[1:06:46] and for his people will push faith out
[1:06:49] there. Amen. God just takes a hold of
[1:06:52] faith and says, "Come on, let's go." And
[1:06:54] out we go and causes and that's what
[1:06:58] love does. Amen. John
[1:07:01] 14 verse 23 says Jesus said if man loves
[1:07:06] me if if a man loves me he'll keep my
[1:07:10] words.
[1:07:12] Amen. Let's read that again. Jesus said
[1:07:14] if a man loves me he'll keep my words.
[1:07:17] Brother Brandham says now you can't keep
[1:07:19] his word without having faith in what he
[1:07:22] said. So so if he loves God then he
[1:07:25] keeps God's word. If he says, "I'm the
[1:07:28] Lord that health," he believes that.
[1:07:30] Love makes him believe it because love
[1:07:33] dominates all. Though I speak with the
[1:07:35] tongue of men and angels and have not
[1:07:38] love, it's nothing. Though I have faith
[1:07:41] to move mountains and have not love,
[1:07:44] it's nothing. Love dominates all cuz God
[1:07:47] is love. A God of love. Amen. Now, we
[1:07:52] know it's true that God will meet a
[1:07:54] desperate soul. Amen. It usually it
[1:07:57] usually takes something to drive us into
[1:07:59] that to that despair to the desperation.
[1:08:02] It takes something to drive us to
[1:08:05] desperation. Oh my. Amen. You may be
[1:08:09] sitting here this morning and and you're
[1:08:11] facing your mountains this morning and
[1:08:13] maybe you face your mountains all week
[1:08:15] or you got a mountain that's coming up
[1:08:16] before you. Amen. And you just don't
[1:08:18] know what to do. You can't see see that
[1:08:21] you're going to get over it. Amen. And
[1:08:24] and you're facing valleys. you can't
[1:08:25] seem to cross and it's pushed you into a
[1:08:28] desperate state. Amen. And the only way
[1:08:30] that you'll ever be able to achieve that
[1:08:33] thing that you're wanting is to
[1:08:34] desperately come before God. Oh my.
[1:08:39] Amen. You must desperately come before
[1:08:42] God and say, "God, I want it. God, I got
[1:08:45] to have it. Amen. I get it now or I'm
[1:08:47] finished. Tomorrow is too late. I must
[1:08:49] have it now." Amen. Desperation.
[1:08:52] Brother Brham says, "When you pray for
[1:08:54] the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the
[1:08:56] token, don't say,"Well, now I'll go up
[1:08:58] and try it, Lord. I'm a little tired."
[1:09:02] Oh, mercy, stay in your seat, then.
[1:09:04] Don't even make an attempt. If you come
[1:09:06] say, "Oh, I'll just pass through the
[1:09:07] prayer line, put the oil on my head, and
[1:09:10] I'll see if that does me any good."
[1:09:12] Might as well just sit where you're at
[1:09:14] until you get to a place until the whole
[1:09:16] church gets to a place that it's between
[1:09:18] life and death. Amen. You've got to have
[1:09:21] it now or perish. Then God will move on
[1:09:23] the scene. It takes desperation to move
[1:09:26] to bring God on the scene. Oh
[1:09:30] my. Jacob cried like never
[1:09:33] before. Desperately called until he got
[1:09:36] a hold of God. And when he did, he
[1:09:39] wrestled not for 15 minutes. He didn't
[1:09:41] wrestle for a few minutes. He didn't
[1:09:43] wrestle for a half an hour and just
[1:09:45] said, "Oh, well, you know, I I felt a
[1:09:47] little something there. I guess I guess
[1:09:49] I'm done. But he wrestled to keep him in
[1:09:52] a sore all night long. Amen. Desperation
[1:09:56] got a hold of Jacob and he wasn't going
[1:09:58] to leave until he got his blessing. Oh
[1:10:02] my. He still He still knew he didn't
[1:10:04] have the blessing and he was able to
[1:10:06] hold on until the blessing came. Oh my.
[1:10:10] If we can just get desperate enough this
[1:10:12] morning. If we can just get desperate
[1:10:14] enough and we could just hold on till
[1:10:16] God till God comes on the scene.
[1:10:21] Desperation. A lot of people says,
[1:10:23] "Glory to God, I got it
[1:10:25] now." There you're deceived. Yeah.
[1:10:28] Somebody says, "Oh, I just feel good. I
[1:10:31] went there down. I went down there and
[1:10:33] prayed. Oh, shivers run up all over me.
[1:10:36] Oh, that might have been God. I saw a
[1:10:38] great light before me. That still might
[1:10:40] have been God, but that's not the thing
[1:10:42] that I'm talking about. The Bible says
[1:10:44] in Hebrews the 6th chapter, the rain
[1:10:46] fallth on the just and the unjust the
[1:10:48] same. Now, you take a weed and take the
[1:10:50] weeds and put them in a field, and the
[1:10:52] rain is is actually sent for the wheat.
[1:10:55] But the rain falls on the weeds just the
[1:10:57] same as the wheat does. And the rain and
[1:11:00] the weeds is just as happy as the rain
[1:11:03] and the wheat is. Amen. The very Holy
[1:11:06] Ghost can fall upon an unbeliever and
[1:11:08] make him act just exactly the same as
[1:11:10] the believers act. But it's by their
[1:11:13] fruits you shall know them. Amen. The
[1:11:18] rain falls on the just and the unjust.
[1:11:20] All the weeds and the h the weeds are
[1:11:22] just as happy. Amen. But by your fruits
[1:11:25] you shall know them. Oh my. And Jacob,
[1:11:29] rather in desperation, he said, "I I
[1:11:31] know. I feel you. You're here with me,
[1:11:33] but I'm not going to let you go. He
[1:11:35] wrestled desperately until the blessing
[1:11:38] came. Amen. In his despairs, I'll not
[1:11:40] let you go. He wrestled until God came
[1:11:43] on the scene. Oh my. The problem today
[1:11:47] is we can't sit still long enough for
[1:11:49] God to move. Oh my. The first little
[1:11:53] sensation, they get up and jump up and
[1:11:55] down and run the aisle and say, "I got
[1:11:57] it." Jacob stayed there until something
[1:12:00] happened. Amen. have made him walk
[1:12:02] different. It made him talk different.
[1:12:04] Hey, it may have made him a different
[1:12:06] person because he stayed until something
[1:12:09] happened. Oh my. The Bible says he
[1:12:11] stayed until he prevailed. Amen. How can
[1:12:14] a man how can a man prevail over God?
[1:12:18] You can do it. A man can prevail over
[1:12:22] God. Amen. Jacob had gone in desperation
[1:12:25] till he got the assurance. Amen. And you
[1:12:28] got to get desperate until you get that
[1:12:31] assurance. Amen. Desperation. Amen. One
[1:12:34] time there was a man by the name of
[1:12:37] Hezekiah. Have been told by the prophet,
[1:12:40] "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're going to
[1:12:42] die."
[1:12:45] Amen. A prophet come to
[1:12:47] Hezekiah with the word of the Lord and
[1:12:50] says, "Thus sayaith the Lord, you're
[1:12:52] going to die." But Hezekiah turned his
[1:12:55] face to the wall and in
[1:12:58] desperation he cried out and he
[1:13:01] says,"Lord, consider me. I've walked
[1:13:03] before you with a perfect heart. I need
[1:13:06] 15 more years." And now he just heard,
[1:13:08] "Thus sayaith the Lord." But now he's
[1:13:11] turned his face to the wall and in
[1:13:13] desperation he's crying out to God
[1:13:16] saying, "God, I need 15 more years."
[1:13:18] After God had told him something was
[1:13:20] going to happen, that he was going to
[1:13:22] die. And in
[1:13:23] desperation, it changed the program of
[1:13:27] God. Amen. Desperation changed the mind
[1:13:31] of God. Oh, I want you to catch that
[1:13:33] this morning. Desperation changed the
[1:13:36] mind of God. Ruth got desperate one time
[1:13:39] when when she was standing by Naomi. She
[1:13:42] had a choice to make. Amen. And would
[1:13:44] she go back to her people, to all that
[1:13:46] she loved and all that she worshiped her
[1:13:48] gods, her people, or would she cleave to
[1:13:51] Naomi? What must she do? She got in a
[1:13:54] desperation. She got in desperation. She
[1:13:57] cried out, "Where you go, I'll go. Where
[1:14:00] you live, I'll live. Where you die, I'll
[1:14:02] die. Where you are buried, I'll be
[1:14:04] buried. Your God shall be my God." Amen.
[1:14:07] There you are. Desperate. And God
[1:14:09] blessed her. Amen. And he gave her a
[1:14:11] son, Oed. And Obed be God. Yes. And
[1:14:13] through Jess come Jesus because she got
[1:14:17] desperate. Amen. She got in a state of
[1:14:20] desperation. Amen. She wasn't going to
[1:14:22] settle until till she come and something
[1:14:25] satisfied her soul. Oh my. All because
[1:14:28] she went into desperation. That's right.
[1:14:31] Brother Brandham says like the little
[1:14:33] harlot
[1:14:34] Rahab, she was
[1:14:36] desperate. She know that death laid
[1:14:38] before she was under judgment. She got
[1:14:41] desperate. said, "I'll hide you spies.
[1:14:44] I'll do anything. Only swear to your
[1:14:46] God, my house will stand. There you
[1:14:49] are." She got in desperation. That's
[1:14:51] right. They were going to destroy. She
[1:14:53] knew something was getting ready to
[1:14:54] happen. She knew judgment was coming,
[1:14:57] but in desperation, she says, "I'll
[1:15:00] hide. I'll hide you. I I'll risk my life
[1:15:02] to hide you, but you must swear that me
[1:15:06] and my house will be saved." Oh my
[1:15:10] desperation. We've gotten to get into
[1:15:12] desperation this morning. Amen. Lord,
[1:15:16] I'm going to hold you until you give me
[1:15:18] something. But Lord, even that I'm going
[1:15:20] to keep on cuz I want more and more of
[1:15:22] you. Oh my. Jonah threw overboard in the
[1:15:27] time of a storm in the bottom of a sea
[1:15:30] in the belly of a well. All hopes of
[1:15:33] survival was gone. My Amen. And how many
[1:15:37] has felt like that before where you just
[1:15:39] feel like you've just been tossed over
[1:15:41] the sea and you've been left to drown
[1:15:43] and you just felt like all hopes of of
[1:15:46] of living was just is there. Amen. All
[1:15:49] hope of survival was gone. Amen. But it
[1:15:53] happened to come in his mind when he got
[1:15:55] swallowed up. It happened to come to his
[1:15:57] mind that Solomon and dedicating the
[1:16:00] temple said, "Lord, if the people be in
[1:16:03] trouble anywhere and they'll turn
[1:16:05] towards the temple and pray than here,"
[1:16:09] brother Brandham says. And turning over
[1:16:11] in the belly of the well, Jonah managed
[1:16:14] to get somewhere to his
[1:16:15] knees. I imagine with the vomit all of
[1:16:18] the well of the well all over him there.
[1:16:21] He prayed in
[1:16:25] desperation. And in that desperate just
[1:16:27] a few breaths of oxygen, oxygen is all
[1:16:30] that he had in the whale's belly. But in
[1:16:33] them few breaths that he was drawing,
[1:16:35] maybe he didn't know which way he was.
[1:16:38] He said, "Lord, I believe I'm looking up
[1:16:40] towards your temple." And with just a
[1:16:43] few breaths to go, in desperation, he
[1:16:46] prayed under those circumstances. Amen.
[1:16:50] never been done before. But he was
[1:16:52] desperate. He prayed and God kept him
[1:16:55] alive for three more days and three more
[1:16:58] nights. Amen. And delivered him to the
[1:17:00] place where he wants to deliver his
[1:17:02] message.
[1:17:04] Desperation calls for that. Oh my.
[1:17:09] Amen. I'm just I'm going to go through
[1:17:11] just different stories, but Hannah, a
[1:17:13] barren woman in the Bible, she wanted a
[1:17:16] son.
[1:17:17] Amen. And she got to fasting for him and
[1:17:20] she fasted and prayed until even the
[1:17:21] priest at the temple thought she was
[1:17:23] drunk. Thought she was a crazy woman.
[1:17:26] Amen. She went in such
[1:17:28] desperation with the rest of the women
[1:17:30] watching what kind of h all the women
[1:17:33] were just just looking at each other.
[1:17:34] Oh, they were just looking at oh what
[1:17:36] kind of bonnet the one woman had and and
[1:17:39] what the other one had on and you know
[1:17:41] how it goes. And the other one seeing
[1:17:43] what kind of clothes they had on and
[1:17:44] talking about the things that they're
[1:17:46] going to do on the farm. But not Hannah.
[1:17:49] She stepped right through the whole
[1:17:50] crowd and went to the altar. She had
[1:17:53] been fasting. She wanted her reproach
[1:17:55] taken away. What a difference it is
[1:17:58] today. It's almost a reproach to have a
[1:18:00] child. We're seeing that today. Amen.
[1:18:02] It's almost a reproach to have a child.
[1:18:05] At that time, it was a reproach not to
[1:18:07] have a child. And she got on her knees
[1:18:09] and she never noticed the the dignity of
[1:18:12] the temple. She never noticed that the
[1:18:15] the the the dignified priest as he
[1:18:17] walked out. She was in such distress
[1:18:20] till all her tears were rolling down her
[1:18:22] cheeks and she was crying in
[1:18:25] desperation. Oh Lord, give me a son.
[1:18:28] Give me a son, Lord. Amen. She was past
[1:18:31] the age of barren. She prayed with
[1:18:34] desperation. She must have this child.
[1:18:37] What was it? God has spoke to her. He
[1:18:39] sent her a prophet. You can't be
[1:18:41] desperate till God speaks to you. Oh
[1:18:45] church, it's time to rise and shake
[1:18:47] ourselves. Amen. It's time to wake up.
[1:18:49] This is the hour for desperation. Oh my.
[1:18:53] We must be desperate or we will perish.
[1:18:56] Oh, there is coming forth something from
[1:18:58] the Lord. We've been given. Thus,
[1:19:00] sayaith the Lord. Amen. God sent us a
[1:19:02] prophet and he says, I've given you
[1:19:04] thus, sayaeth the Lord. We better get
[1:19:07] desperate this morning. If not, he'll
[1:19:09] pass through and we'll miss it. Oh my.
[1:19:12] Let's get desperate this
[1:19:14] morning. We all know the story of the
[1:19:17] Shounomite woman. A man, she was old and
[1:19:20] her husband old. They had no
[1:19:24] children, but she was kind to this
[1:19:27] prophet. And she knowed that he was a
[1:19:29] man of
[1:19:30] God. And she had watched him do signs
[1:19:33] and wonders. She heard him tell the
[1:19:34] things that happened. He was an
[1:19:36] honorable man, a holy man. She built a
[1:19:39] house out there for him. He could come
[1:19:43] by whenever he wanted and so forth. And
[1:19:46] she put a little a bed out there, a
[1:19:48] little jug of water and and that he
[1:19:50] could wash himself and have something to
[1:19:52] drink. And she would probably send a
[1:19:54] little maid or a butler up, brother
[1:19:55] Bernham says, and with some food to feed
[1:19:58] him. The woman was honoring God as she
[1:20:00] honored this prophet, as she seen God in
[1:20:03] the prophet. And so when Elijah saw this
[1:20:06] kindness done to him, he said to his
[1:20:07] servant, "What does she want? Go ask
[1:20:09] her. Shall I shall I speak to the king
[1:20:12] for? I'm a personal friend. I'm the
[1:20:13] chief captain. I know him real well.
[1:20:17] There is a there must be some kind of
[1:20:19] favor, something I can do for her. I
[1:20:22] want to give her something for how she's
[1:20:23] been to me. She's fed me. She's she's
[1:20:26] let me sleep in the beds and she she's
[1:20:28] been real nice to us. Now, what can I do
[1:20:31] for her?" She says, 'N no, I I just just
[1:20:34] dwell among my people. We're we're well
[1:20:36] off. We're, you know, we work our farm
[1:20:38] and the Lord has blessed our farm and
[1:20:41] we're well off and we're we live
[1:20:42] comfortably. We're we're fine. We're
[1:20:44] okay. We don't need
[1:20:46] anything and and we don't have need of
[1:20:48] nothing and and Gahhesi sent to him, but
[1:20:51] she doesn't have any
[1:20:53] children. And brother Brennham says, "No
[1:20:55] more than Jahesi saw it. No doubt the
[1:21:00] prophet saw a vision for he said thus
[1:21:02] saith the Lord go tell her in proper
[1:21:05] time a year from now she will embrace a
[1:21:08] son and the son was born we all know the
[1:21:12] story how that uh old couple must have
[1:21:15] left this little boy their only child
[1:21:18] when he was about 12 years old brother
[1:21:21] Maram says one day he was out cutting
[1:21:22] wheat with his daddy and must have been
[1:21:25] out in the middle of the day he had a
[1:21:26] sun stroke he got sicker and sicker
[1:21:29] his daddy had taken him from the field
[1:21:31] and it was such an emergency there that
[1:21:34] he went that he sent his servant and
[1:21:36] sent him in and the mother held him on
[1:21:38] her lap until noon time and he then the
[1:21:42] boy died. noticed her child that had
[1:21:44] been given her by the Lord through the
[1:21:46] prayer and the promise of a prophet. If
[1:21:49] thus sayaith the Lord, a prophet came
[1:21:50] and said, "Thus sayith the Lord, you'll
[1:21:52] have a son." And now 12 years later, the
[1:21:54] son dies. And she knew there was
[1:21:57] something wrong
[1:21:58] somewhere. She knew that God just
[1:22:00] wouldn't give him something and then
[1:22:02] take it away. Amen. How could God give
[1:22:05] her that son and let her love and come
[1:22:07] to that baby and she never asked for it?
[1:22:10] She was too old to even have it. And
[1:22:12] there this baby in this condition had
[1:22:14] died, her only son. So she said to the
[1:22:17] servants, she got see desperation got a
[1:22:20] hold of her. She said, "Saddle me a mule
[1:22:22] and you ride and don't you stop. If
[1:22:25] anyone tries to stop you, don't you say
[1:22:27] a word and you drive straight to drive
[1:22:29] straight to Mount Carmel. Out there in a
[1:22:32] cave somewhere, pull back. There is a
[1:22:33] servant of the most high God who want
[1:22:36] who told me thus sayith the Lord, I'll
[1:22:38] give you a baby." Amen. And I want to
[1:22:40] know why God has done this. Go straight
[1:22:42] forward and don't you and don't check
[1:22:44] the mule. Let him run just as hard as
[1:22:46] everything in him. Let him run till you
[1:22:49] get there.
[1:22:51] Desperation. Oh my. And Elijah the
[1:22:53] prophet raised up and looked and said,
[1:22:54] "Here comes that Shimonite, that
[1:22:56] shinomite woman." And she said,
[1:22:58] "Something's wrong with her. God has
[1:23:01] kept it from me. I don't know what's
[1:23:02] wrong." Said, "Go meet her. Let's hurry.
[1:23:04] Let's hurry. There's something wrong."
[1:23:06] Desperation set on in the prophet.
[1:23:09] Desperation set on in the woman. Amen.
[1:23:11] So she was almost there. Then he raised
[1:23:14] up his hand and says, "Is all well with
[1:23:16] thee? Is all well with thy husband? Is
[1:23:18] all well with thy child?" And brother
[1:23:21] Brennham says, "Now the woman had
[1:23:23] reached the end of her
[1:23:25] desperation." She said, "All is
[1:23:27] well. All is well. Glory. All is well.
[1:23:33] Amen. All is well." Her desperation was
[1:23:37] over.
[1:23:39] She had she had found the servant of the
[1:23:41] Lord. And he hadn't been there. She had
[1:23:44] still been in desperation. But you see,
[1:23:46] he was there. She said, "All is well."
[1:23:50] Elijah thought, "Well, what's going on
[1:23:52] now?" So, she ran up and fell down at
[1:23:55] his feet. And that looked kind of
[1:23:57] uncommon. So,
[1:23:59] Jahesi started to lift her up and Elijah
[1:24:02] said, "Don't do that. Just let her
[1:24:04] alone. There's something wrong. God
[1:24:05] keeps it from me."
[1:24:07] Then she revealed to him and that her
[1:24:09] baby was dead. Now the prophet didn't
[1:24:12] know what to do. He he said, "Jahes,
[1:24:14] take this staff and that I've walked
[1:24:16] on." And he know that whatever he
[1:24:18] touched was blessed cuz it wasn't in
[1:24:21] him. It was God in him. He knew who he
[1:24:23] was and he knew that he was a prophet.
[1:24:25] So he picks up the staff and says,
[1:24:27] "Jesa, you take this. You go and lay it
[1:24:29] upon the child and if anybody speaks to
[1:24:32] you, you get desperate. You don't don't
[1:24:34] you salute nobody. Don't you just keep
[1:24:36] going? Don't speak to nobody. Put it
[1:24:38] upon the child. But the woman that
[1:24:41] didn't enter her desperation, that
[1:24:42] didn't satisfy what she'd come for. She
[1:24:44] said, "As the Lord God lives, I'm not
[1:24:46] going to leave until you go minister to
[1:24:49] the child." See, desperation got a hold
[1:24:51] of her. Oh my. Amen. And Elijah got
[1:24:55] desperate. And there he went down the
[1:24:57] road in him and down the road with him
[1:25:00] and the woman. And when they got there,
[1:25:01] all the people there out in the yard
[1:25:04] screaming and crying. And the woman had
[1:25:06] done the most appropriate thing that
[1:25:07] could be done. She took the baby and she
[1:25:09] laid him on the bed where Elijah had
[1:25:11] laid. Amen. That was a good That was a
[1:25:14] good as his staff. Amen. It was good as
[1:25:17] his staff. He didn't want He didn't wake
[1:25:19] up there yet. Amen. The prophet went in.
[1:25:22] Now he's in desperation. Amen. And we
[1:25:26] find in the Bible that he walked up and
[1:25:28] down the floor desperate. I don't know
[1:25:30] nothing else to do, Lord. Here am I. You
[1:25:32] told me to speak to that woman and thus
[1:25:34] saith the Lord. And it was exactly the
[1:25:36] way I told her because you told me,
[1:25:38] Lord, now there she's in trouble and I
[1:25:40] don't know what to do. There lays a dead
[1:25:42] boy, Lord. What What can I do, Lord?
[1:25:46] Lord, what can I do? I'm desperate for
[1:25:48] you, Lord. No doubt the Holy Spirit
[1:25:50] says, "If the if if the God is in you,
[1:25:53] then lay yourself on the baby." First
[1:25:55] thing you know, he stopped. He ran and
[1:25:57] put his hands on his hands, his nose
[1:26:01] upon his nose, his lips upon its lips.
[1:26:03] And when he laid himself over, the baby
[1:26:06] sneaked seven times. Desperation was
[1:26:10] over.
[1:26:12] Amen. The baby came to life because
[1:26:15] desperation drove the woman to the
[1:26:17] prophet and desperation drove the
[1:26:20] prophet to the baby. Oh my. and
[1:26:23] desperation and both of them drew God on
[1:26:26] the
[1:26:28] scene. Oh my. With love of God and love
[1:26:32] for his people brought the love of God
[1:26:33] down and throw faith out there on the
[1:26:35] battlefront and then the work was done.
[1:26:38] Case closed. Amen. That's it.
[1:26:41] Desperation does it. Certainly, she
[1:26:43] wasn't going to leave. She wasn't going
[1:26:46] to leave. But desperation got God on the
[1:26:49] scene. Amen.
[1:26:52] Amen. And we've been given, as we said,
[1:26:55] thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. If you want
[1:26:57] healing this morning, if you want the
[1:26:59] Holy Ghost this morning, if you just
[1:27:01] want a renewing with the Lord and said,
[1:27:03] Lord, just renew my walk with you. You
[1:27:06] want a deliverance, don't stop pressing
[1:27:08] until you get it. Oh my, it's
[1:27:12] desperation. It's desperation that will
[1:27:14] bring God on the scene. Amen. We must
[1:27:18] get desperate before the Lord. Hey man,
[1:27:22] another blind Baronameus thought Jesus
[1:27:24] was going to pass him
[1:27:26] by sitting out there at the gate. Blind
[1:27:29] beggar. He was just a blind beggar. Hey
[1:27:33] man, the first thing you know he heard a
[1:27:35] noise that Jesus was passing by. He
[1:27:38] said, "Who passes by?" Somebody shoved
[1:27:40] and bounty and he said, "Please, who is
[1:27:42] passing by?" One of them, well, maybe a
[1:27:45] little a little kind disciple woman
[1:27:48] said, says, "Sir, don't you know who is
[1:27:51] that passing by?" No. I hear some of
[1:27:53] them say, "There's a whole graveyard
[1:27:55] full of deaf people up there. If you if
[1:27:57] you raise the dead and go raise them, is
[1:27:59] that a blasphemer or somebody?" No. Have
[1:28:01] you heard of the prophet of Galilee, the
[1:28:03] young prophet called Jesus of Nazareth?
[1:28:06] No, I haven't. Well, you know, it says
[1:28:09] in our scrolls that the son of David
[1:28:10] will be raised up to set on it. That's
[1:28:13] him right there. Oh, is that him? Is
[1:28:16] that him? Is that him passing by?
[1:28:18] Desperation drove him to scream, "Oh,
[1:28:21] Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy
[1:28:24] upon me." And they just said, "Shut up.
[1:28:27] You're too loud. You're making too much
[1:28:29] noise. You're dancing too much. You're
[1:28:31] shouting too much. You just sit still.
[1:28:33] Don't make noise. Don't make go to
[1:28:36] sleep." Oh my. But he said, "Pass me
[1:28:40] not, oh gentle savior." Lord, hear my
[1:28:43] humble
[1:28:44] cry. And wow, others are passing by.
[1:28:48] Lord, don't pass me by.
[1:28:51] He cried,
[1:28:53] "Savior." Amen. Some of them said, "Just
[1:28:56] shut up." But he was
[1:28:59] desperate. He had a desperate heart.
[1:29:03] And then Jesus got by. He never would
[1:29:06] have had another opportunity.
[1:29:09] And it's the same this morning.
[1:29:12] Amen. If we do not get desperate enough,
[1:29:16] we might not have another opportunity.
[1:29:20] This may be the last service we'll ever
[1:29:22] go in or we'll ever be in. It's time we
[1:29:25] get desperate. It's time we say, "Lord,
[1:29:28] I'm getting it now or I'm getting it
[1:29:30] never." Amen. It's desperate.
[1:29:33] Amen. He was desperate.
[1:29:36] Desperation. He screamed out, "Oh,
[1:29:38] Jesus." No matter who told him to stop,
[1:29:41] he cried just the same, that much more
[1:29:43] louder. He was desperate. Nobody could
[1:29:46] stop him. Thou son of David, have mercy
[1:29:49] on me. He scream in desperation. Amen.
[1:29:53] And the son of God, when the sin with
[1:29:55] the sins of the world upon his
[1:29:56] shoulders, going to Jerusalem to be
[1:29:59] offered up right then for a sacrifice
[1:30:02] for the world, he stopped in his tracks.
[1:30:06] Oh my, what a
[1:30:09] testimony. Oh my. Brother Brandham says,
[1:30:13] "Desperation, a despairing cry stop the
[1:30:16] son of God." Says, "What would you have
[1:30:19] for me to do for you?" Oh, said,
[1:30:22] "Lord, Lord, that I might receive my
[1:30:25] sight." He said, "Go your way. Your
[1:30:29] faith saves you." That was enough for
[1:30:31] blind Barnameus.
[1:30:33] That was enough for him cuz he was
[1:30:36] desperate. Desperation when desperation
[1:30:38] is re is to receive
[1:30:41] something. The faintest little touch
[1:30:43] faith grabs us. He didn't say now. Wait
[1:30:45] a minute. Wait a minute. Hold there just
[1:30:48] a minute. Let me see if I can see now.
[1:30:50] You said it. Let me just let me just
[1:30:52] see. Hold on. Everybody stop. I never
[1:30:54] did see my hands for many years. Let's
[1:30:56] just see if I can see it. I don't see
[1:30:58] nothing yet. When Jesus said, "Thy faith
[1:31:01] has saved thee." That was enough for a
[1:31:04] blind Barnameus, that's all he wanted to
[1:31:08] hear was, "Thy faith has saved thee." Oh
[1:31:12] my.
[1:31:13] Desperation. Amen. Desperation calls for
[1:31:15] a subject. And when the subject, no
[1:31:18] matter how faint it is, it's received.
[1:31:21] It's believed right then because faith
[1:31:24] catches it. Faith catches when
[1:31:26] desperation is pushing it.
[1:31:29] Amen. See, love is there, mixes with it,
[1:31:31] and brings it to it. Desperation does
[1:31:34] it. Amen. Brother Brandham says,
[1:31:37] "Peter, when he was all steamed up one
[1:31:40] night on the
[1:31:42] sea, when he got in desperation, he
[1:31:44] began to cry
[1:31:46] out, there was something wrong. I I see
[1:31:49] a spirit coming. I speak I see a spirit
[1:31:52] walking to me." Amen. The ship was about
[1:31:55] to go down. And he said, "If it be you,
[1:31:57] Lord, bid me to come on the water." And
[1:32:01] the Lord said,
[1:32:03] "Come." And he stepped down and out of
[1:32:06] the ship and he started, but he got
[1:32:09] scared. He be to look at the problem. He
[1:32:13] began to look at his situation. He began
[1:32:15] to look at his
[1:32:16] circumstances. He began to look at at
[1:32:19] how high the waves
[1:32:20] were. And when he got started, he
[1:32:23] started to sink.
[1:32:25] And though a mistake in trying to follow
[1:32:27] the commandments of God, brother said,
[1:32:29] "I hope the church gets there." The man
[1:32:31] was doing what God told him to do. But
[1:32:34] he started to sink. And in
[1:32:38] desperation, he cried, "Lord, save me.
[1:32:42] Save me, Lord, or I'll
[1:32:44] perish." And a hand reached and picked
[1:32:47] him up. Oh my. We have the same thing
[1:32:50] this morning.
[1:32:52] We don't have to drown in complexes. We
[1:32:54] don't have to drown in
[1:32:57] desperate in depression. We don't have
[1:33:00] to we don't have to watch our children
[1:33:02] be overcome by the things of the world.
[1:33:05] Amen. If we would just cry out in
[1:33:08] desperation, you have the same right
[1:33:11] Peter had. Amen. Lord, save me or I'll
[1:33:14] perish. Lord, save my children. Lord,
[1:33:17] save my daddy. Lord, save my mama. Lord,
[1:33:20] hear my cry. Amen. And as you cry out in
[1:33:24] desperation, you can have the same
[1:33:26] testimony that Peter had. He heard my
[1:33:29] desparing cry and from the waters lifted
[1:33:32] me. And how safe am I? Oh my, what a
[1:33:39] testimony. Oh, he was he he was out
[1:33:43] there. The waves were getting
[1:33:45] high, looking at his circumstances,
[1:33:48] looking at his
[1:33:50] problems. But he looked to one. He
[1:33:52] looked at the one that he knew that
[1:33:54] could save him. He turned to Jesus and
[1:33:57] he says, "Lord, save me. Lord, I need
[1:34:00] you. I'm desperate for you, Lord." Then
[1:34:03] a hand reached out. And it pulled him
[1:34:06] up. Oh, man. So many times have I felt
[1:34:09] like I've I've looked at my situations.
[1:34:12] I've looked at my circumstance. I've
[1:34:14] looked at my problems and I just don't
[1:34:17] see how we're going to get through it.
[1:34:19] But yet, I just look up and I in
[1:34:21] desperation begin to call on the Lord
[1:34:24] and says, "Lord, you've got to give it
[1:34:26] to me now or I'm going to perish." And
[1:34:29] the next thing I know, a hand reaches
[1:34:31] down and he saves me. Oh my
[1:34:37] desperation. Desperation calls God on
[1:34:40] the scene. Brother Brandham says, "Then
[1:34:44] we find out that in the sinking, God
[1:34:45] heard him in the line of duty, he
[1:34:48] started to sink. He failed. No matter if
[1:34:51] you fail, that don't have nothing to do
[1:34:54] with it. We all fail. We're a failure to
[1:34:57] begin with, but we got somebody standing
[1:35:00] now with the strong hand who can reach
[1:35:02] up, who can reach us and take us above
[1:35:05] the water." Amen. If you made a
[1:35:09] mistake, some women made a mistake, some
[1:35:12] man made a mistake, some boy or girl
[1:35:13] made a mistake. Don't sink. Scream out
[1:35:17] in despair. Lord, save me or I'll
[1:35:20] perish. Get desperate about it. God will
[1:35:23] hear you. He always hears a desperate
[1:35:27] soul.
[1:35:29] Amen. Jarius one time had a little
[1:35:31] daughter that was dying.
[1:35:34] Brother Brandham says he was a
[1:35:35] borderline believer. He believed Jesus.
[1:35:39] He but he was afraid to confess it
[1:35:41] because they put him out of the
[1:35:42] synagogue. He was a religious man. But
[1:35:45] the doctor come one morning and says,
[1:35:47] "She's dying now." But see, desperation
[1:35:50] set in. See, he was afraid to confess
[1:35:53] Jesus. He was afraid to believe and and
[1:35:56] confess it out loud. But when he heard
[1:35:58] that his own daughter was dying, then
[1:36:01] desperation came within him. Oh my. He
[1:36:05] couldn't afford it at his position to be
[1:36:06] caught up with Jesus of Nazareth because
[1:36:09] he would lose his position as a priest.
[1:36:11] But I tell you, when emergency comes, it
[1:36:13] throwed him into
[1:36:15] desperation. Brother Adam says, "I can
[1:36:17] see him hunting for his little
[1:36:19] preachers's coat and hat and slipped it
[1:36:21] on. Here he come down through the crowd
[1:36:23] pressing
[1:36:24] around and they were all shouting. But
[1:36:27] he went in and said, "Master, master, my
[1:36:30] little my my little girl is is laying at
[1:36:33] the point of death. Master, master, my
[1:36:36] little girl is laying at the point of
[1:36:37] death. If you'll just come lay your
[1:36:39] hands on her, she'll live." Oh, my
[1:36:42] desperation makes you say things
[1:36:44] sometimes, makes you do things that puts
[1:36:47] you in action. His daughter was saved by
[1:36:51] desperation.
[1:36:54] His daughter was saved by desperation.
[1:36:58] Hallelujah.
[1:37:00] If the musicians will
[1:37:04] come, it's desperation that will get God
[1:37:07] on the scene.
[1:37:10] Oh, sometimes we've prayed and we prayed
[1:37:12] for our children, for our family. We've
[1:37:15] prayed for situations. We we've asked
[1:37:18] God to give us
[1:37:19] answers. We'll pray for months. We'll
[1:37:21] pray for weeks. We'll pray for years and
[1:37:24] it just seems like that God just doesn't
[1:37:26] do
[1:37:26] something. But but we just got to learn
[1:37:29] to stay in desperation that no matter
[1:37:32] how long it's going to take, no matter
[1:37:34] how h how how how hard it's going to be,
[1:37:37] if we can just hold on out of
[1:37:40] desperation and God will do something.
[1:37:44] Amen. Let's be desperate like that
[1:37:45] little woman with the blood
[1:37:47] issue. The Bible said she had spent all
[1:37:50] of her money with the physicians and yet
[1:37:53] they couldn't help her. Oh my. Here we
[1:37:56] have the best doctors in the world today
[1:37:59] and yet they still can't figure out
[1:38:00] certain things. They still can't figure
[1:38:02] out they they still can't find a cure
[1:38:04] for cancer, man. With all the knowledge,
[1:38:07] with all the best scientists in the
[1:38:09] world, we still have the great
[1:38:11] physician. Amen. Yet they couldn't help
[1:38:14] her. So she had started in time of
[1:38:17] menopause and blood and a blood issue
[1:38:19] and it wouldn't stop. They had maybe
[1:38:22] sold the farm, the mules, the horses or
[1:38:24] whatever it was and nothing could help
[1:38:26] her. But one morning she looked
[1:38:29] down. She lived upon the bank but there
[1:38:32] were where her farm was and she had seen
[1:38:36] a great bunch of people gathering around
[1:38:38] a man down there. And they said, "What
[1:38:40] is that?" said, "That's Jesus of
[1:38:43] Nazareth." And that's when desperation
[1:38:46] set in. She says, "I'm kind of all
[1:38:50] insignificant, but if I can only touch
[1:38:52] the border of his garment, I'll be made
[1:38:55] well." And she passed by every critic
[1:38:58] and everything else. But then she got to
[1:39:01] the
[1:39:03] spot. She touched his garment in
[1:39:07] desperation. And when she did, he turned
[1:39:09] around and said, "Who touched me?" Oh,
[1:39:12] they all denied it. But he looked around
[1:39:13] and he found the little woman and told
[1:39:15] her, "Your blood issue has stopped."
[1:39:18] Desperation drove her to do
[1:39:21] that. She had to press through the
[1:39:24] crowd. She didn't just set up on the
[1:39:27] heel and said, "Well, I hope the master
[1:39:28] comes my way. I hope he just comes. I
[1:39:30] just I just hope." But she went out in
[1:39:33] desperation. She had to do something.
[1:39:36] She had to press. And in desperation she
[1:39:39] touched the hem of his garment and was
[1:39:42] made
[1:39:43] well. Desperation when thou seekest me
[1:39:46] with all your
[1:39:47] heart then I'll hear you. Amen. Our
[1:39:51] opening scripture the law and the
[1:39:53] prophet were until John since the
[1:39:56] kingdom of heaven has been preached and
[1:39:58] a man press into it. Don't just stand
[1:40:01] around and say pick me up by the call of
[1:40:03] the Lord. Push me in. You press into it.
[1:40:07] You get desperate between life and
[1:40:09] death.
[1:40:12] Amen. Can we just bow our heads for a
[1:40:16] moment? Amen. Nobody looking around,
[1:40:21] but maybe you're seeking this
[1:40:28] morning and you say, "Lord, I want a
[1:40:31] renew week.
[1:40:34] Lord, I want to refresh
[1:40:37] you. Lord, I I want to draw closer to
[1:40:43] you. I'm tired, Lord, of living the same
[1:40:46] life day after
[1:40:48] day without feeling your presence.
[1:40:53] Lord, we've got to get
[1:40:56] desperate. Get desperate. Say, "Lord, I
[1:40:59] need
[1:41:01] you. Lord, I want to see my loved ones
[1:41:05] saved. I want to see my wife saved. I
[1:41:08] want to see my husband
[1:41:11] saved. Lord, I want to make it in a
[1:41:15] rapture. Lord, don't leave me
[1:41:18] behind. I want my family to make it in a
[1:41:23] rapture. Whatever you have need of, get
[1:41:27] desperate, Lord. I want healing in my
[1:41:29] body. I want a deliverance, Lord.
[1:41:33] I want to be a better husband to my
[1:41:35] wife. I want to be a better wife, a wife
[1:41:38] to my
[1:41:40] husband. I want to be a better father. I
[1:41:43] want to be a better
[1:41:45] mother. We've got to get desperate this
[1:41:49] morning. You have to want it bad
[1:41:52] enough. I'm not going to stop pressing.
[1:41:56] I'm not going to stop believing until
[1:41:58] you give it to me,
[1:42:00] Lord. Lord, whatever it takes, however
[1:42:02] long it takes,
[1:42:04] Lord, I'm going to see a
[1:42:08] victory. Don't limit
[1:42:10] God to your
[1:42:14] situation. Don't limit God to your
[1:42:17] feelings. Whatever you have need of this
[1:42:21] morning, it's time to get desperate for
[1:42:24] it. Lord, I've been on this mountain too
[1:42:27] long. It's time to move.
[1:42:30] It's time for this mountain to move.
[1:42:31] It's time for this for this valley to
[1:42:34] move. Amen. I believe it was Buddy
[1:42:37] Robinson one
[1:42:38] time. I said,
[1:42:40] "Lord, if you don't give me the Holy
[1:42:43] Ghost, when you come back, you will find
[1:42:44] a pile of bones laying right here in the
[1:42:46] field." Brother Brandham says that's
[1:42:48] when he received it. He got desperate
[1:42:52] enough when he was out in the field. He
[1:42:54] said, "Lord, I want the Holy Ghost so
[1:42:56] bad. if you don't give it to me when you
[1:42:58] come back again, there's going to be a
[1:43:00] pile of bones here. Lord, I'm desperate
[1:43:03] for you. I've got to have
[1:43:05] it. And that's when he received it.
[1:43:08] That's when God came on the scene cuz he
[1:43:11] got
[1:43:12] desperate. Let's get desperate before
[1:43:15] God this
[1:43:16] morning. And then he'll come on the
[1:43:20] scene. Dear heavenly
[1:43:25] father, Lord, we're desperate for you
[1:43:29] this morning,
[1:43:31] Lord. Lord, we're asking, Lord, that you
[1:43:34] would come down, Father. Lord, that you

[1:43:42] walk down this aisle,
[1:43:44] Father. Lord, we're in the time of
[1:43:47] desperation, Lord. Your your prophet has
[1:43:50] already prophesied, Lord, that these
[1:43:53] events would happen. And Lord, we're
[1:43:54] seeing it happen today. We're seeing
[1:43:57] these these events of unfolding today,
[1:44:00] Lord. And Lord, we know that that that
[1:44:04] your coming is here,

[1:44:14] Lord. I'm desperate for my family. I'm
[1:44:17] desperate for my loved ones,
[1:44:20] Lord. Oh, Lord, don't leave us here,
[1:44:23] Father.
[1:44:25] Lord, oh, Father, Lord, you gave us a
[1:44:28] promise, Lord, that by your stripes, we
[1:44:30] are healed. Lord, we're holding on to
[1:44:32] that promise this morning, Lord. Lord,
[1:44:35] you said, Lord, that you had had called
[1:44:37] us before the foundation of the world.
[1:44:40] That our names were put in the Lamb's
[1:44:42] book of life before the foundation of
[1:44:44] the world. And Lord, we're holding on to
[1:44:47] that. We're never letting go of that,
[1:44:49] Lord, because we're desperate for you,
[1:44:53] Father. Lord, I pray that you would come
[1:44:57] and touch every desperate mother this
[1:44:59] morning. Every desperate father, every
[1:45:01] desperate husband, Lord, every desperate
[1:45:04] wife this morning,
[1:45:06] Lord, Lord, I pray that they would hold
[1:45:09] on and never let go.
[1:45:12] I pray that you would just come
[1:45:15] Lord or to have your way father is our
