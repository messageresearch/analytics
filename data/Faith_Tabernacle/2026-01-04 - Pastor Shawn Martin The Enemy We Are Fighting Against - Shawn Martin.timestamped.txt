[23:11] through so much. And oh God, as we come
[23:14] before you with thanksgiving in our
[23:16] heart
[23:17] truly, you are an everpresent help in a
[23:20] time of trouble. Lord, you are the
[23:22] everpresent water from the rock. We
[23:24] thank you, Lord. As I was thanking this
[23:26] morning, listening to the seventh seal
[23:28] yesterday and brother Ram just kind of
[23:30] reiterating that during the tribulation
[23:32] period that the 144,000 has to be
[23:35] purged. a foolish virgin has to be
[23:37] purged because they rejected perhaps the
[23:40] message and the the earth has got to be
[23:42] partially purged during that time. But
[23:44] God, we're thankful that this bride
[23:46] because of the coming forth of the word
[23:47] and the opening of the word, we take our
[23:49] purging on this side. We take our
[23:51] purging now. We come to church each
[23:54] time, Lord, to receive uh correction in
[23:57] the house of God. The the house of God
[23:59] is a house of correction. And we're
[24:01] thankful, Lord, because you have sent
[24:02] your word to heal us and sent your word
[24:05] to cleanse us and sent your word to
[24:07] encourage us. And we're so thankful,
[24:09] Lord, that we have a a revelation. You
[24:11] put representation in our hearts so we
[24:13] could receive the word and be healed and
[24:15] touched and delivered and encouraged and
[24:18] all these wonderful things. We just
[24:19] thank you so much, dear God, that not
[24:22] only that you sent a prophet lest you
[24:24] would smite this earth with a curse, but
[24:25] you let us be part of it. You chose your
[24:27] bride, and we're so thankful for that.
[24:29] unworthy that we are, but we give you
[24:32] thanksgiving. We pray for each of these
[24:34] requests that's been given in. You know,
[24:36] each one don't have to name them.
[24:37] They've been already named, but we know
[24:39] that you're, as we said, an everpresent
[24:41] help in a time of need. And we thank you
[24:43] for the testimonies that's been given
[24:45] in, especially for the um Sister Hope's
[24:48] cousin, I believe it is, and the person
[24:50] across the street, dear God, and the
[24:52] serious uh accidents that happen. But
[24:55] God, we know that you still are mindful
[24:57] of the needs of of your children. And
[24:59] maybe they're just like brother Bram
[25:01] would pray for others and they were just
[25:02] a person want life a little better. And
[25:05] somebody prayed the prayer of faith and
[25:07] we're thankful for that. And each one of
[25:09] these requests, Lord, I pray that you
[25:11] meet that need. And bless our pastors.
[25:13] He brings the word of the Lord. May it
[25:15] truly be spiritual food and due season
[25:17] this morning as we feed on the unfailing
[25:19] body word of the son of man. again.
[25:22] Lord, thank you that you sent us a word
[25:24] that we might be purged on this side
[25:26] that we'll have that great hope, Lord,
[25:28] of that wonderful change of body. We
[25:30] love you. Thank you in Jesus' name.
[25:33] Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated this morning.
[25:38] Amen. Maybe we could ask brother Doug to
[25:40] come and sing for us.
[25:44] You are the Lord,
[25:47] my healer.
[25:49] Sing it now. You are the God. Oh, you
[25:53] are the God
[25:57] that healeth me.
[26:01] You are the Lord,
[26:04] oh my healer.
[26:10] You've sent your word
[26:13] and you've healed my disease.
[26:18] You are the Lord,
[26:22] my healer.
[26:37] I turn around telling the branches what
[26:40] cord it was.
[26:43] That's about all the sense I've got.
[26:47] I like to say I sure appreciate the
[26:49] Lord. I've been thinking about all been
[26:51] through a lot of trials. You know,
[26:58] I want the armor on the front. Don't
[27:00] y'all? I don't want none on the back.
[27:02] All on the front.
[27:05] Like the grass line still
[27:09] beneath the flowers on the hill. Without
[27:13] you, Lord, you just wouldn't grow
[27:21] like a lost sheep astray.
[27:25] I'd be wondering each day without you.
[27:30] I'd have no place to go.
[27:36] And I can be on a tree with my branches.
[27:44] And I can build on a church with no pew.
[27:52] I can build on a well with no water.
[28:01] But Lord, I can't picture
[28:05] me without you.
[28:20] Precious Lord, be my guide.
[28:24] Ever walking by my side when I'm weak.
[28:30] Give me strength to go on
[28:35] in the darkness
[28:38] of night.
[28:40] Hold my hand, be my light, guide my
[28:44] steps till I'm safely at home.
[28:51] And I can build on a tree with no
[28:56] branches.
[28:59] I can build on a church with no pe.
[29:07] I can build on a well with no water.
[29:15] But Lord, I can't picture.
[29:20] me without you.
[29:23] Lord, I can't picture
[29:27] me without you.
[29:44] Amen. Did you enjoy that this morning?
[29:46] Amen.
[29:50] I've got so much to thank him for.
[29:56] So much to praise him for. You see,
[30:01] oh, he's been so good to me.
[30:07] And when I think
[30:10] of all he's done and where
[30:15] he's brought me from, I've got so much
[30:19] to thank
[30:21] him for. Sister Janice comes. Well, I've
[30:25] got so much to thank him for.
[30:31] So much to praise him for. You see?
[30:36] always been so good to me.
[30:42] And when I think
[30:46] of all he's done and where
[30:50] he's brought me from, I've got so much
[30:54] to thank
[30:56] him for.
[31:08] Mary
[31:11] first heard it spoken.
[31:18] So sacred
[31:21] it was inroduced
[31:25] by angels.
[31:31] But she did not know that hour
[31:38] just what majesty
[31:43] and power
[31:46] was contained
[31:50] in the name
[31:52] sweet preious Lord.
[31:59] because she knew that holy
[32:07] is thy name.
[32:16] Holy
[32:20] is
[32:23] thy name.
[32:29] There's
[32:31] no other
[32:33] name with a healing
[32:37] touch.
[32:39] No other name
[32:42] that I love as much
[32:46] as Jesus.
[32:50] Holy
[32:52] is
[32:54] thy name.
[32:59] Now in no other name
[33:07] is there salvation
[33:15] that's given
[33:19] whereby
[33:21] we must be saved.
[33:28] So in
[33:31] everything
[33:33] that I do or say, I will honor
[33:40] your sweet name.
[33:44] For those
[33:47] who've learned to trust you, Lord,
[33:52] they
[33:53] will never be the same.
[33:57] And they'll tell you, "Holy
[34:05] is thy name.
[34:13] Oh, holy
[34:18] is
[34:21] thy name.
[34:26] Oh, there's no other
[34:30] name
[34:32] with the healing
[34:34] touch.
[34:36] There's no other name that I love as
[34:42] much as Jesus.
[34:47] Holy
[34:49] is
[34:50] thy name.
[34:55] Yes, there's no other
[35:00] name with a healing
[35:04] touch.
[35:06] There's no other name
[35:09] that I love as much as Jesus.
[35:17] Holy
[35:19] is
[35:21] thy name.
[35:33] Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we
[35:35] invite our pastor to come?

[38:08] bring you down
[38:11] or drive your spirit into

[40:05] still battling there in in her body. And
[40:09] so we just uh keep holding her up in our
[40:12] prayer.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord will just give her complete
[40:15] victory. And I believe he will.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's just the God that we serve.
[40:20] Amen. And it was good to hear Sister
[40:24] Janice sing.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh um I know it's you know
[40:30] she's gone through a a battle there
[40:32] herself losing brother Bob and uh you
[40:35] know she's telling telling me just
[40:38] coming to church is probably the hardest
[40:40] thing for her because her and brother
[40:43] Bob was come to church for many many
[40:46] years together and and um so not having
[40:51] uh her partner there and and uh but we
[40:54] just
[40:56] Good to just see that she's pressing on.
[41:00] Amen. And we certainly love and
[41:03] appreciate Sister Janice very much. And
[41:07] um
[41:08] uh Brother Andrew asked me to greet you
[41:10] all today. He's um ministering uh there
[41:14] in Alabama, I believe. And uh so I told
[41:18] him I would do that. Also, I hear Ayla
[41:21] is sick. um not feeling well, the
[41:25] sickness just going around and um and so
[41:28] we want to keep her in our prayer as
[41:31] well. And I tell you, let's just go to
[41:34] the Lord in prayer and we're asking to
[41:36] to bless the word and we'll just pray
[41:39] for sister A as well. Father,
[41:44] Lord, as we come as your children,
[41:48] Lord, not eating the crumbs that fall
[41:51] off the master's table, but we have been
[41:53] invited to sit at your table,
[41:57] Lord. You have prepared it for us that
[42:00] we may eat of all your blessings, your
[42:04] promises, Father. And Lord, healing has
[42:07] been in your word. It's it's one of the
[42:10] children's bread that we could eat and
[42:13] partake of. And asking that you would do
[42:18] a miracle, Father, for uh Aya. Father,
[42:22] she's sitting in the car not feeling
[42:25] well, but Lord, would your spirit just
[42:29] go there and touch her and make her
[42:33] whole? Father, this sickness just going
[42:36] around everywhere. But Lord, we are
[42:38] believers and we don't have to to give
[42:43] into that and we don't have to have it.
[42:45] I just believe that you can protect us
[42:48] from these things. And Lord, we just ask
[42:51] that you would do it. And Lord, ask that
[42:53] you would bless the ministering of your
[42:55] word today. Lord, you see what's on my
[42:58] heart. And I pray that you would just
[43:00] help me to yield myself to you, Lord.
[43:03] And may it be a blessing to your people,
[43:06] Father, that we could be better equipped
[43:08] and and just reminded of of who we are
[43:13] and and the last days that we're living
[43:16] in. We love you. We thank you in Jesus
[43:20] Christ's name. Amen.
[43:24] If you have your Bibles, we're going to
[43:26] turn
[43:27] um First Peter,
[43:31] I believe it is First Peter and the 5th
[43:35] chapter.
[43:38] Amen.
[43:42] And then we'll go to Ephesians the 6th
[43:45] chapter.
[43:46] But first Peter chapter 5
[43:50] and we'll start at the sixth verse.
[43:57] It says, "Humble yourselves therefore
[43:59] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[44:01] exalt you in due time.
[44:04] Casting all your care upon him for he
[44:06] carth for you.
[44:09] Be sober, be vigilant, because your
[44:12] adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion,
[44:15] walketh about, seeking whom he may
[44:17] devour.
[44:19] Whom resist steadfast in the faith,
[44:22] knowing that the same afflictions are
[44:24] accomplished in your brethren that are
[44:25] in the world. Amen. Then if you'll go to
[44:30] Ephesians the 6th chapter.
[44:33] Amen.
[44:36] And um
[44:44] we um love the Lord today and sure a
[44:48] beautiful day today.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians uh chapter 6
[44:56] and uh we'll start at the 13th verse.
[45:00] Uh, wherefore take unto you the whole
[45:03] armor of God that you may be with a able
[45:06] to withstand in the evil day and having
[45:09] done all to stand.
[45:11] Stand therefore
[45:15] um having your low ones gird about with
[45:18] truth and having on the breastplate of
[45:20] righteousness and your feet shaw with
[45:23] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[45:25] above all taking the shield of faith
[45:28] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[45:31] all the fiery darts of the wicked.
[45:34] Everybody say all. Quench all the fiery
[45:38] darts of the wicked and take the helmet
[45:41] of salvation and the sword of the spirit
[45:44] which is the word of God. Praying always
[45:48] with all prayer and supplication in the
[45:50] spirit and watching there and too with
[45:52] all perseverance
[45:54] and supplication for all saints. Amen.
[45:59] you can have your seats this morning.
[46:03] And um you know, if you have uh served
[46:07] God for any length of time,
[46:11] uh then you already know that we're not
[46:14] in a picnic.
[46:16] Uh not not on a picnic, but we are um in
[46:20] a in a warfare.
[46:22] And uh you know the prophet gave us a
[46:27] lot of things uh revealed the word to us
[46:30] open the the the seals have been opened
[46:33] things placed uh where it should be in
[46:37] the word we have been placed in the word
[46:39] and we thank the Lord for that and
[46:42] &gt;&gt; but yet then he would tell us of just
[46:45] how troublesome times we're really in.
[46:48] He one place said we're sailing in
[46:51] troubled waters and talks about how dark
[46:54] it is. Tells us how demons are uh the
[46:58] lid of hell has been lifted off and
[47:00] demons are pouring in and it it it God
[47:05] has given us such quite information
[47:09] uh in this message that we we wouldn't
[47:12] be caught off guard by anything. uh
[47:16] nothing should catch us off guard today
[47:19] and and one thing that he uh established
[47:23] which it's in the Bible but and that is
[47:26] we are in a warfare
[47:29] and we know that uh and brother Brandon
[47:33] he he preaches messages like uh the
[47:36] contest and put on the whole armor of
[47:39] God and um um uh the greatest battle
[47:44] ever fought. hot and and and and certain
[47:48] things uh uh that he would let us know
[47:52] uh just that this battle is really real.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; And it started up in heaven between God
[47:59] and Satan. And Satan rebelled against uh
[48:04] God. And he he wanted a better kingdom.
[48:08] Uh thought he could make a better
[48:10] kingdom. And he's striving to make a
[48:12] better kingdom. And uh the prophet said
[48:16] this world uh they're they're making
[48:18] this world you know a better place to
[48:20] live in. He said really they're making
[48:22] it a better place to sin
[48:24] &gt;&gt; in. But in their idea their idea of
[48:28] thinking uh it's because this is Satan's
[48:31] kingdom but he's trying to make it a
[48:33] better place outside of God's way. and
[48:38] uh and and so this this warfare had been
[48:41] raging and he was able to uh draw uh
[48:45] angels after him and and and so then he
[48:50] was kicked out and of of heaven and and
[48:54] we see that he's here on this earth. God
[48:57] um
[48:59] uh when God made man uh you know uh the
[49:04] battle's still raging
[49:06] &gt;&gt; uh but man became the battleground
[49:09] uh there and and and as we know u and I
[49:14] pray it can make some sense today uh I'm
[49:16] not bringing anything new to you but a
[49:19] as as we know Satan cannot create never
[49:22] has been uh so God created his son, but
[49:26] Satan couldn't create. So, he had to he
[49:30] had to somehow pervert God's creation in
[49:34] order to bring his life and his son. And
[49:38] and so, but but the the God when he made
[49:43] man, he didn't make man a robot or or uh
[49:47] but he made man a free moral agent. And
[49:51] so it this would allow Satan to be able
[49:54] to work on man and God work on man. Um
[49:59] and so this is what the prophet would
[50:01] call uh man being the battleground. Uh
[50:04] the warfare between God and Satan and
[50:08] and man being the battleground. Satan
[50:11] chose man's head uh as his control tower
[50:15] uh his intellect reasoning. Um, God
[50:20] chose man's heart to be his control
[50:23] tower.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; And so what makes this a a difficult
[50:27] thing is us being free moral agents,
[50:31] then we have to decide. It's up to us to
[50:34] decide who are we going to let dominate
[50:37] us. And that's where the battle is.
[50:41] That's the warfare. And and if uh uh
[50:45] this actually requires us then to
[50:48] surrender. We have to surrender. We
[50:51] either surrender to God or we surrender
[50:54] to the devil. Uh Paul there in Romans
[50:58] says know ye not that to whom you yield
[51:01] your servants uh your self-s servants to
[51:03] obey his servants you are to whom you
[51:06] obey. So when you yield you're only
[51:10] you're yielding to be a servant. You'll
[51:12] either yield yourself to be a servant to
[51:14] God or a servant to the devil. You are
[51:17] servants. U so uh you he says uh to whom
[51:21] you yield yourself servants to obey his
[51:23] servants you are to whom you obey
[51:26] whether of sin unto death or of
[51:28] obedience unto righteousness. Ain't that
[51:31] right?
[51:32] &gt;&gt; So that's what the Bible tells us. Uh
[51:35] now the Bible tells us what happens when
[51:38] when uh uh Satan has complete control
[51:42] over a man. Uh we also uh it also tells
[51:46] us and shows us what happens when God
[51:49] has control over a a man. And and both
[51:55] powers uh but one is satanic power, one
[51:59] is is divine power, God's power. But but
[52:04] yet they're both they're both powers. Um
[52:07] uh one man that was completely
[52:10] surrendered over to the devil. They
[52:12] couldn't he could break chains. He could
[52:15] he could break all kinds of things. They
[52:17] couldn't tame him. Uh because uh it was
[52:21] a he became a superman. Um a superpower.
[52:25] The prophet said uh because it it was
[52:28] not just a human strength. He had he had
[52:32] yielded himself over to another power.
[52:35] Uh and and well then we find that any
[52:38] man that would yield himself to God,
[52:41] look at the power, look at Samson. What
[52:44] Samson was able to do. No man could do
[52:46] that on his own. Not even the strongest
[52:49] man in the world today couldn't do that.
[52:52] And and Samson wasn't muscled uh up. He
[52:55] wasn't, you know, what we would picture
[52:57] Samson to be. Uh but he got his power
[53:01] because he surrendered un unto God's
[53:04] power unto God. Ain't that right?
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Now so this is why Paul likens us as
[53:11] soldiers. Uh we are uh we are soldiers
[53:15] and he tells us to put on the whole
[53:18] armor of God. If you want to be a
[53:20] Christian and you want God to use you,
[53:22] you want to be a successful Christian,
[53:25] you want to be one on top uh overcoming,
[53:28] then you you you you're a you got to
[53:30] fight. Can't just sit there and lay
[53:32] down. This is a real thing. If you want
[53:35] to overcome depression, if you want to
[53:38] overcome sickness, if you want to
[53:39] overcome doubt, if you want to overcome
[53:42] hate and bitterness, if you want to
[53:43] overcome whatever you're going through,
[53:45] you must put on the whole armor of God.
[53:48] Amen. Now, the prophet said, "Satan has
[53:51] his ang a agents out everywhere
[53:53] watching, spying out on God's people.
[53:57] God moves." See, and the enemy is
[53:59] sitting everywhere watching uh to see
[54:03] what he can do. Well, God has his agents
[54:06] everywhere as well. Ain't that right?
[54:09] And anytime that God moves or is fixing
[54:13] to move, Satan is there uh uh to hinder.
[54:17] Now, brother Brandham, in one uh place,
[54:19] he said, "Now, this is the last night of
[54:21] the service." I don't know how long the
[54:24] service the meeting had been, but
[54:26] they're at the last night of it. And and
[54:29] he says, "And I want each one of you to
[54:32] give me your undivided attention and
[54:35] listen close now." So, he's telling
[54:37] them, "Don't let your minds wander.
[54:38] Don't let your whatever." Amen. Stay
[54:41] focused. Amen. He said, "This is the
[54:44] last night and we're trying to go in for
[54:46] the greatest victory of the meeting."
[54:50] Amen. So, this whole meeting now, the
[54:52] prophet understood that we ain't just
[54:54] having a meeting here. This is a battle.
[54:57] This is a this is a warfare. There are
[55:00] people that need help and and so he
[55:02] says, "Now, this is the last night.
[55:04] We're going in for the greatest victory
[55:06] of this meeting." And he needed the
[55:08] cooperation of the people. Stay focused.
[55:10] Stay stay with us. Ain't that right? And
[55:13] and so he says, usually there's more
[55:16] people healed on the last night than
[55:19] there is in the rest of the meeting.
[55:22] Their great anticipation. This is why we
[55:24] don't have prayer lines at the beginning
[55:26] of our meeting. We have it at the end
[55:28] where where the ministry, the word has
[55:31] gone forth and and faith has been built
[55:34] and anticipation is high. And he said,
[55:37] "Now Satan fights harder. Everything
[55:41] goes wrong seemingly because Satan is
[55:44] trying to keep that people in tension
[55:47] and everything else so that he can keep
[55:50] them away from this great time of strain
[55:54] that we're now entering into for the
[55:58] great as we would say going in for the
[56:00] kill. So he he's letting the people know
[56:04] we've had great nights and all this but
[56:06] this is the last night and Satan is
[56:07] going to fight harder. This is the way
[56:09] he always does because he knows we're
[56:12] going in for the kill. And so he's going
[56:15] to uh uh uh uh cause havoc in um uh uh
[56:19] in your day. He's going to try to wreck
[56:21] you your day. He's going to try to get
[56:24] you nervous and all worked up and and
[56:27] all of these things. It's a battle,
[56:28] ain't that right? Just maybe even this
[56:31] morning, uh uh uh battles are raging in
[56:34] in in just a a little group like this
[56:37] here. But he says, "See, uh, we'd say
[56:41] going in for the kill. He's already beat
[56:44] up in the corner." Amen. He's been
[56:46] exposed. All of his devices is exposed.
[56:50] And men and women have accepted Jesus
[56:53] Christ as their savior. People with
[56:55] cancer and tumors and everything else
[56:58] has been healed. Doctor statements
[57:00] proving that it's the truth. Now, here
[57:02] sits a group of people here tonight
[57:04] sitting waiting under great expectation.
[57:07] See, and Satan, if he can interrupt your
[57:11] mind, that's all he has to do. But let's
[57:15] go in now for the great kill just now to
[57:18] drive Satan and all of his powers plum
[57:21] out of the building that God can have
[57:24] the right of way and heal every sick
[57:27] person for the glory of God.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so, uh, uh, so Satan is
[57:33] there to hinder. Amen. He's there
[57:35] waring, but it it takes not only a
[57:38] preacher, but it takes the people
[57:40] together to rally around and understand
[57:43] the battle that's taking place. But he
[57:46] says, if let's do this now. Let's go in
[57:48] for the kill. Let's stay focused. Let's
[57:50] stay don't don't don't don't don't get
[57:52] out here and don't let your mind wander
[57:54] and all of these things. Let's go in
[57:56] because people need it. Amen. and let's
[57:58] do it for the glory of God. Can you say
[58:01] amen? Amen. I just believe that. And and
[58:04] so uh uh as soldiers, we must prepare to
[58:08] train ourselves to meet this enemy of
[58:11] ours. Amen. Now, think of that. We must
[58:14] train. Now, this is a prophet saying
[58:16] that. Amen. That we must train or
[58:19] prepare ourselves to meet this enemy of
[58:22] ours. Don't you? You You're not just
[58:24] sitting here and just happy golucky and
[58:27] and just go blowing this way and this
[58:29] way wherever the way the wind blows.
[58:32] You're just going No, you're sitting
[58:34] here being trained. Trained. Ain't that
[58:37] right? See, and he says now he says, you
[58:40] know, uh talks about one of the
[58:42] presidents uh that says in the time of
[58:44] peace, prepare for war. Amen. And that's
[58:47] very true. See, when everything is going
[58:50] good and everything is just going nice
[58:52] for you, you should be preparing to meet
[58:56] the enemy. Ain't that right? Because the
[58:59] prophet said, "Because you're going to
[59:01] meet him." So, you should prepare to
[59:03] meet the enemy. See, while everything is
[59:06] running smooth, you better get ready.
[59:09] Ain't that right? If your if your life
[59:11] is going smooth right now, you better
[59:13] get ready. Amen. See, for Satan isn't
[59:16] going to let it run smooth very long.
[59:19] You're in a convention now. Everything
[59:22] will just pour along fine. But you're
[59:24] going to leave here in a few days and
[59:26] you're going to meet the enemy. He might
[59:29] not even wait till you get ready to
[59:30] leave. He might attack any time. So,
[59:33] he's wicked and ruthless and and and he
[59:36] just carries on whenever he can.
[59:39] Whatever he can say or do, he does it
[59:42] right now. So, it's best to be dressed
[59:45] all the time.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. In other words, have have
[59:49] the armor on all the time. You might
[59:51] meet him out on the street. You might
[59:53] meet him in your car. Hard tell him
[59:55] where you're going to meet him. Or he
[59:57] will meet you right in the seat right
[59:59] there and and meet right at the pullpit
[1:00:02] here. Anywhere. See, he's just wicked.
[1:00:04] He doesn't care. So, we want to be
[1:00:08] prepared for it. Don't we don't want to
[1:00:11] be unprepared when we enter to trials.
[1:00:13] We don't want to be unprepared when
[1:00:15] Satan comes at us. Let's be prepared so
[1:00:19] we don't be caught off guard. A ain't
[1:00:21] that right? So So now he said we want to
[1:00:24] be trained. We want to be trained on how
[1:00:28] to deal with our enemy. Ain't that
[1:00:31] right? No nation sends men out to war
[1:00:34] without first training them. Amen. On
[1:00:37] how to meet their enemy. I I uh when
[1:00:41] they go out and they uh uh issue uh you
[1:00:44] know they're getting ready to make a uh
[1:00:46] invasion somewhere. Well, the men will
[1:00:49] train and train and train. They they
[1:00:51] will go out and and and they will um
[1:00:55] copy uh I don't know what that is, but
[1:00:59] God help them. If that's a if that's an
[1:01:01] alert, God help them find that person.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? And so, but when they get
[1:01:07] ready to go out, maybe maybe America's
[1:01:09] getting ready to go over to overseas and
[1:01:12] and and they're they're going to take a
[1:01:14] they're they're wanting to capture.
[1:01:16] Well, they did the other day, right?
[1:01:17] They captured V and they invaded
[1:01:20] Venezuela or whatever. But they didn't
[1:01:22] just go over there and just say, "Well,
[1:01:24] let's see what happens." No, they they
[1:01:27] there there's times that and they may
[1:01:29] have done it this time, but they prepare
[1:01:30] them soldiers and and they will do mock
[1:01:34] uh uh setups and all of that and they
[1:01:37] will go and like they're really doing
[1:01:39] this thing and they're preparing for any
[1:01:42] little thing that may happen that may go
[1:01:44] wrong and and they're getting in
[1:01:46] soldiers prepared and prepared. That way
[1:01:49] when they go over they're not looking
[1:01:51] said now where do we go? What's what
[1:01:53] what what what do we do? They've already
[1:01:55] done it. Amen. And so when they get over
[1:01:57] there, everything looks familiar because
[1:01:59] they've already practiced and they
[1:02:00] practice and they practice. Amen. And
[1:02:03] that's what makes their invasion so
[1:02:04] successful is they prepare for anything
[1:02:07] that could go wrong.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They know. See, and so
[1:02:12] this is what a prophet is telling us. We
[1:02:14] must train. We must train. That way
[1:02:16] you're not caught off guard. He going to
[1:02:18] come at you in any old way. He may
[1:02:21] attack you in your body. He'll attack
[1:02:22] you in your mind. He'll attack you in
[1:02:24] your finances. He'll attack you, Amen.
[1:02:27] in in your your your uh well, he'll just
[1:02:29] attack you in any old way. And you've
[1:02:32] got to be prepared, trained on how to
[1:02:36] deal with your enemy. Can you say amen?
[1:02:40] See, because if we're not trained, the
[1:02:42] reason why we train is we we go to war
[1:02:46] uh with the purpose of defeating the
[1:02:49] enemy.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? We don't send our
[1:02:52] soldiers over there just for for fun. Uh
[1:02:55] uh to say that we sent them and and
[1:02:57] well, we sent a you know, we sent 10,000
[1:02:59] of our soldiers over there. Boy, we
[1:03:01] showed them how good we you know, how
[1:03:03] big of an army we've got, you know.
[1:03:05] Well, what does that do when you get
[1:03:07] defeated, you know, so we go to war to
[1:03:10] win.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; We fight to win. Can you say amen? And I
[1:03:14] say your enemy's fighting you to win.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now you got to be trained
[1:03:20] to fight back to win. Ain't that right?
[1:03:24] Amen. Don't lay down. Just let him whoop
[1:03:26] all over you. A ain't that right? So we
[1:03:29] go to war for the purpose of conquering
[1:03:32] and defeating our enemy. The prophet
[1:03:35] said, you know, he said, you'd better
[1:03:37] destroy your enemy before your enemy
[1:03:39] destroys you.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Now, now you either going to destroy
[1:03:42] your enemy or your enemy is going to
[1:03:44] destroy you. It ain't going to be just
[1:03:45] you walking away and he just sitting
[1:03:47] there letting you say, "Oh, nice. I'm
[1:03:49] I'm sorry. You're a fine fella. I'll go
[1:03:51] pick on somebody else." No. He's going
[1:03:53] to destroy you or you destroy him. One
[1:03:55] of the one way or the other. You You
[1:03:57] live or you die.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. See, and so our
[1:04:02] job is to destroy the enemy. Brother
[1:04:05] Brandham said, "The thing to do, to my
[1:04:07] opinion, is know your enemy. know him
[1:04:10] and train for the contest that you're
[1:04:13] going to have when you meet him because
[1:04:16] you're going to meet him.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to avoid him. You can't
[1:04:22] be the nicest person and and avoid him.
[1:04:25] He don't care how nice you are. You
[1:04:27] could be the quietest person in church
[1:04:29] and say, "Well, if as long as I just be
[1:04:30] quiet, he ain't going to notice me. I
[1:04:32] ain't going to say amen. I ain't going
[1:04:33] to lift my hand cuz cuz he might notice
[1:04:35] me." No, he notices you.
[1:04:38] So if he notices, you might as well just
[1:04:40] lift your hands.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You might as well just get excited cuz
[1:04:44] he's already got your number
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; and you're going to meet him.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Well, if I don't shake everybody's
[1:04:51] hands, I won't get germs. You know, I
[1:04:52] won't get sick. See? So So let let's
[1:04:55] just all stay still. You know, you might
[1:04:57] die of pneumonia.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Never know.
[1:05:06] So, so, so, uh, uh, we find you're going
[1:05:10] to meet him. So, he says, "Know him.
[1:05:14] Know what his strength is. Then train
[1:05:17] for this contest when you do meet him.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; For it's one thing sure, it's one thing
[1:05:24] sure you're going to meet him." So then,
[1:05:28] train.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Train for the contest.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Don't be an untrained
[1:05:36] soldier.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Be trained.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Good night. Right.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; So notice the prophet said, "If you want
[1:05:44] to start training, start with John 3:16,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; The golden rule. Start right out with
[1:05:54] that and that'll get you on the floor.
[1:05:57] Then notice, then train for the knockout
[1:06:01] punches.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to have to use
[1:06:05] them,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; So, don't just go,
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; you know, don't don't you know uh I saw,
[1:06:19] you know, uh uh one day he he his son
[1:06:22] was acting up, a little kid acting up.
[1:06:24] So he went over there and picks him up
[1:06:26] and he like that and the boy starts
[1:06:28] crying, you know, and he goes, "Oh, I'm
[1:06:29] sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done
[1:06:31] that."
[1:06:33] You know, I just laughed. I thought that
[1:06:35] was really funny. But a lot of times we
[1:06:37] do that with the devil, too. You know,
[1:06:39] you know, devil bothering us, you know,
[1:06:40] and you give him a little slap and then
[1:06:42] he come, "Oh,
[1:06:44] shouldn't have done that." No, you got
[1:06:46] to not train for the knockout punches.
[1:06:50] Quit crying
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; and train for knockout punches.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Because we're going to
[1:06:57] have to use them.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to want to get knocked
[1:07:01] out.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; You don't want to get to the place you
[1:07:03] start missing church
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; over every little thing.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You know, you see that song, hear that
[1:07:10] song, excuse the excuse. You hear them
[1:07:11] every day. You know, whole family had to
[1:07:13] stay home just to blow that poor kid's
[1:07:15] nose.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; What is it? They got knocked out.
[1:07:18] Knocked out.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Well, instead of the devil knocking you
[1:07:21] out, won't you knock him out?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, the prophet
[1:07:25] said, "You got to train for these
[1:07:26] knockout punches."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; They just don't come natural. You got to
[1:07:30] train for it.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; And then start using them.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Knock the devil out of the ring.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Train for the knockout punch. Can you
[1:07:40] say amen? See, so we don't want to act
[1:07:43] like we don't know what we're doing when
[1:07:46] we face the enemy.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; We don't want to start looking around
[1:07:50] for sympathy. Can you please help me? I
[1:07:53] just I'm just about to die.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; No, you got to train.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Know what you're doing
[1:08:04] when you stand toeto toe with the enemy.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Don't fall apart. A
[1:08:10] amen.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Now, we basically have only one enemy,
[1:08:14] and that's the devil. Ain't that right?
[1:08:16] I know the prophet said you're the
[1:08:17] you're your biggest enemy, and that's
[1:08:18] true, but but you're only your biggest
[1:08:21] enemy because you're allowing Satan,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. to to to have havoc with you.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; People like to be petted.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; People like PE pe people like attention.
[1:08:36] PE people like someone to to nurse on
[1:08:39] them and and oh you poor baby and and oh
[1:08:42] you poor this and oh you poor that. See
[1:08:44] and so every time trouble comes man they
[1:08:46] get on the phone they start gossiping
[1:08:48] and they start telling everybody the
[1:08:50] church's problems and and this brother
[1:08:52] done this and this brother done that and
[1:08:54] and and and all it is is is they just
[1:08:57] love they love sympathy.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; That's all they they is. They ain't a
[1:09:02] real soldier.
[1:09:04] Can you say amen?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; See, and so so we only have one enemy.
[1:09:09] And see now, now Satan has an army of
[1:09:12] demons.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And and as we know, there's more demons
[1:09:16] in in in today's world than there's ever
[1:09:20] been because they have been released uh
[1:09:24] by the re uh river Euphrates. Ain't that
[1:09:27] right? Evil powers, demonic spirits, and
[1:09:30] horsemen, and all of these things. Well,
[1:09:32] a demon or a devil, the prophet said in
[1:09:35] the English word uh uh it it it it is
[1:09:38] means tormentor. A demon is a tormentor.
[1:09:43] Ain't that right? That that's what uh uh
[1:09:46] uh uh Sister Kim is is dealing with is
[1:09:49] is a tormentor. Sister Martha, a
[1:09:52] tormentor. Well, because he can come
[1:09:54] that they'll put Satan will put sickness
[1:09:57] on you. It's a tormentor when you got a
[1:10:00] headache and it's just pounding and you
[1:10:02] and and you can't Judah, you know, he's
[1:10:04] taking Tylenol and ibuprofen and Advil,
[1:10:07] whatever, you know, and the headache
[1:10:08] just won't go away. What is it? It's a
[1:10:11] demon that is tormenting.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just happen. It It's It's a
[1:10:19] spirit that is attacking in the physical
[1:10:21] realm.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? I hope I didn't
[1:10:26] hurt your feelings by saying that
[1:10:27] things. It's just true. It it it's just
[1:10:30] he's a tormentor.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But but he does that. He breaks up
[1:10:33] homes. He he breaks up marriages and he
[1:10:36] causes uh division and and he's a
[1:10:39] tormentor.
[1:10:42] Now uh uh so first Peter 5 and8 says be
[1:10:46] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[1:10:48] the devil as a roaring lion walketh
[1:10:51] about seeking whom he may devour or
[1:10:54] seeking whom he may destroy.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; He he wants to destroy you.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He does not like the thing you
[1:11:01] stand for. He doesn't like the god you
[1:11:04] worship.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; He doesn't like your worship.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He doesn't like your faith. He doesn't
[1:11:10] if you're if your joy stems from the
[1:11:12] word of God and the Bible, the promises
[1:11:15] of God, he hates that kind of joy.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; He He is doing everything he can. If
[1:11:21] you're benefiting from God and his word,
[1:11:23] he hates it. He hates you.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; So, he's out to destroy your faith. If
[1:11:29] that faith came from God, he's
[1:11:31] determined to destroy that faith.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, if your
[1:11:36] confession come from the Bible, from the
[1:11:38] word of God, he'll try to destroy. Amen.
[1:11:41] And silence that confession.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Well, he doesn't bother you
[1:11:47] when you say, "Oh, I'm sick. Oh, I just
[1:11:48] don't feel good. Oh, I think I'm going
[1:11:50] to die." He's fanning the flames.
[1:11:54] But the moment you say, "Well, I'm sick.
[1:11:56] I or I'm healed. I've got victory. I'm
[1:11:58] I'm I'm going to overcome." Watch all
[1:12:00] hell break loose.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He's trying to get you
[1:12:05] to doubt your own confession.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; So don't think for a moment that Satan
[1:12:12] is playing around. He's not.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And he's using every tactic he can to
[1:12:17] destroy you.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Now, to be honest, it's hard for people
[1:12:21] to discern the enemy
[1:12:24] uh for the fact that he is unseen. Our
[1:12:27] senses may not uh you know, they're not
[1:12:29] made to pick up or discern things that
[1:12:31] that cannot be seen. our our senses only
[1:12:34] discern this this life earthly temporal
[1:12:37] things that we see. It's it's there. But
[1:12:40] millions are people millions of people
[1:12:42] are oblivious to the spirit world. They
[1:12:45] see a person's, you know, ungodly
[1:12:48] actions and they blame the person or
[1:12:52] they they hear what someone says that is
[1:12:55] ungodly or uh uh evil or what and they
[1:12:58] blame the person. Well, see, and and and
[1:13:01] so, you know, there there are actually
[1:13:03] people uh uh surprisingly, but but
[1:13:06] people that think we ought to get rid of
[1:13:07] guns uh uh uh to to squash the murder,
[1:13:12] you know, that's in the world today. So,
[1:13:14] they think guns are going to take care
[1:13:16] of it. Ain't that funny? Because they
[1:13:18] see this gun killing people. So, they
[1:13:21] just automatically think if we get rid
[1:13:23] of guns, we solve our problem.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; That doesn't solve nothing.
[1:13:29] But they they're oblivious to the spirit
[1:13:32] world. A ain't that right? See, and so
[1:13:35] uh uh uh uh we place blame on things we
[1:13:39] hear and and the things we see, the
[1:13:41] actions and words and and all of these
[1:13:44] things. So we place blame on all of
[1:13:46] that. See, and it takes discernment to
[1:13:49] recognize
[1:13:50] uh something that your senses cannot
[1:13:53] detect.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it was in Jesus's
[1:13:57] day. The majority of people could not
[1:13:59] see God in Christ.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. The Bible says
[1:14:04] the fullness of God dwelt bodily in him,
[1:14:07] but all they saw when they looked at him
[1:14:09] was a man.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; They just saw a man. That's all they
[1:14:12] could see. That's all their senses could
[1:14:13] detect.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And they could not recognize the unseen
[1:14:17] God was living there because the veil
[1:14:20] was a flesh. The flesh was the veil that
[1:14:23] kept them from seeing God. Ain't that
[1:14:25] right? When Jesus made it known to them
[1:14:28] and he said, "I and my father are one."
[1:14:30] The Bible says they picked up stones and
[1:14:33] they were going to stone him
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; because they could not see nothing but a
[1:14:39] man.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and and and and so in
[1:14:46] John 10:32, Jesus answered them, "Many
[1:14:49] good works have I showed you from my
[1:14:51] father. For which of those works do you
[1:14:53] stone me?" The Jews answered him,
[1:14:55] saying, "For a good work we stone thee
[1:14:57] not, but for blasphemy, because that
[1:15:00] thou being a man, makest thyself God."
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; In John 14:10, "Believest thou not that
[1:15:08] I am in my father, Jesus said, and the
[1:15:10] Father in me. The words that I speak
[1:15:12] unto you, I speak not of myself, but the
[1:15:15] Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[1:15:17] works."
[1:15:19] God, the unseen God was living in a veil
[1:15:22] of flesh and was literally doing the
[1:15:25] works through that veil of flesh.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Now, if they would have studied the
[1:15:31] word, if they would have studied the
[1:15:33] word of God as to what God promised for
[1:15:36] the day and would have known the
[1:15:38] characteristics of God, they would have
[1:15:41] recognized that God was making himself
[1:15:44] known in Christ. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:49] And so today the people cannot see God
[1:15:53] because they are looking at the veil of
[1:15:55] flesh. They're looking at the natural.
[1:15:57] Well, I believe they cannot recognize
[1:16:00] their enemy, the devil.
[1:16:03] In the same way,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; they cannot see that Satan is the one
[1:16:08] that anoints them to disbelieve. Yeah,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; they cannot see that makeup and the eye
[1:16:14] shadow that women are wearing today are
[1:16:17] coming from the pits of hell from some
[1:16:19] unseen power influence.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; They cannot see that Satan is the one
[1:16:24] that's anointed these women to go
[1:16:26] without clothes.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; They can't see that it's a it's an
[1:16:31] unseen spirit that is causing them to
[1:16:34] tattoo their bodies all up.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; There's no normal person that would say
[1:16:38] that's pretty. That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; No normal person
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; could say that a a woman with pink hair,
[1:16:48] nose on a ring, her nose on a ring, ring
[1:16:51] in her nose and her tongue and and
[1:16:54] eyelids and and and big old holes in her
[1:16:58] ears or earlobes drooping. No normal
[1:17:01] individual can say that's pretty.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; They're already in trouble as it is.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then to do that makes it worse
[1:17:10] trouble.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; So you know many people who claim to
[1:17:16] serve God cannot see that Satan, the God
[1:17:19] of this world has blinded them from
[1:17:21] seeing the truth.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; They can't discern it. They can't see
[1:17:25] the enemy because he's unseen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:31] And and you know he may not anoint us uh
[1:17:36] in that way uh because he has rec we
[1:17:39] have recognized that those things are of
[1:17:41] the devil. We we he can't he can't put
[1:17:45] on us uh and and make us think that you
[1:17:48] know uh dressing sexy is is the way to
[1:17:51] go. No. We we recognize the enemy that
[1:17:54] way. We recognize the enemy looking at
[1:17:57] women and their their filthiness that a
[1:18:00] man should not do that. So we've
[1:18:02] recognized that. See, and and we don't
[1:18:04] we we turn our heads and and all of
[1:18:07] these things, but but that doesn't stop
[1:18:09] him from coming at us.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; See that? That doesn't stop him from
[1:18:17] coming at us. Many time he places
[1:18:19] thoughts in our mind
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; that are contrary to God's word. And if
[1:18:25] we do not recognize what's going on, we
[1:18:28] will actually begin to think that those
[1:18:30] thoughts are coming from us.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And instead of casting those thoughts
[1:18:39] aside, we begin to dwell on it. Yeah.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; He'll put a thought against our brother,
[1:18:45] a thought against our sister,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; and we start nursing them thoughts.
[1:18:49] Nursing them thoughts and not us not
[1:18:52] recognizing, oh, we recognize the devil
[1:18:55] on somebody else,
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; out there and they're murdering and
[1:18:59] they're committing adultery and they're
[1:19:00] doing this and they're doing that. Oh,
[1:19:02] they're bound by the devil. True.
[1:19:07] But them thoughts that get us to to to
[1:19:10] look at our brother in a different way,
[1:19:12] our sister in a different way, and and
[1:19:15] even look at us ourselves in a different
[1:19:17] way from what God has called us to be.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; That's our enemy.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; So now 2 Corinthians 10:5, casting down
[1:19:30] imaginations.
[1:19:31] See, well, you got to be trained to do
[1:19:33] this. That's right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; We got to be trained to do it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Not every thought is meant to dwell to
[1:19:40] be dwelt upon.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Not everything that we uh uh uh uh that
[1:19:46] comes to us is to be entertained.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; So, we got to be trained.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; What thoughts are of God and what
[1:19:54] thoughts are not.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're trained, then you are to
[1:19:58] cast down imaginations.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; God trying to tell you he loves you.
[1:20:03] Amen. And we would rather take the
[1:20:05] devil's words, the devil's thoughts.
[1:20:08] Well, I've done this and I've made this
[1:20:10] mistake and I made that. I just don't
[1:20:11] see how God could love me. You've got to
[1:20:14] be trained to cast that thing down.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Cast down imaginations and everything
[1:20:21] high thing that exaltth itself against
[1:20:23] the knowledge or the word of God, the
[1:20:26] mind of Christ, and bringing into
[1:20:28] captivity.
[1:20:30] Do you realize that we're not meant to
[1:20:32] be captives?
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; We've been set free. How many's been set
[1:20:36] free by the blood of Christ? You've been
[1:20:38] set free
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; not to come back under bondage again.
[1:20:43] But now you're called to bring into
[1:20:45] captivity.
[1:20:46] You bring into captivity every thought
[1:20:50] to the obedience of Christ.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And the prophet tells us over and over,
[1:20:54] Christ is the word. bring every thought
[1:20:58] into captivity to the obedience of the
[1:21:00] word. And Jesus said, "Thy word is
[1:21:02] truth." Ain't that right?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; See, and he says, "I am the truth." So
[1:21:08] Christ and the word are the same thing,
[1:21:10] and they are truth.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Bring every thought into captivity uh to
[1:21:17] obedience to the truth, to Christ, the
[1:21:21] word.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? bring every thought in
[1:21:25] obedience to him. Jesus in speaking of
[1:21:29] Satan said there is no truth in him.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So you don't have to wonder who's
[1:21:34] speaking truth to you. If if if your
[1:21:38] thoughts are coming by this word, that's
[1:21:40] the truth.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; If thoughts are not oh lining up with
[1:21:45] this Bible,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; it's not truth. You bring that thought
[1:21:51] into captivity
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; cuz there is no truth in him. When he
[1:21:55] speaketh the lie, he speaks of his own.
[1:21:57] For he is a liar and the father of it.
[1:22:01] Cannot speak truth. Cannot speak truth.
[1:22:04] It may look like he's speaking truth
[1:22:06] when he tells you you're unworthy.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; God never will tell you you're unworthy.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; God will never tell you that you're not
[1:22:14] a daughter of his.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You're not a son of his. Right?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He may correct you. He may he may whip
[1:22:21] you and chastise you, but it will never
[1:22:23] be with him telling you he doesn't love
[1:22:25] you.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; So then you've got to be trained and and
[1:22:32] recognize that comes from the devil.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring that under captivity.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; When a thought comes to you that's
[1:22:41] contrary to what God said, then it's of
[1:22:42] Satan. When an action is contrary to
[1:22:44] what God said, then it's of Satan.
[1:22:46] That's your enemy.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; When a word is said that is contrary,
[1:22:51] amen, to what God said, then it's of
[1:22:53] Satan.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; You realize truth is part of God's
[1:22:58] armor.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; That we are to put on. Amen. Ephesians
[1:23:03] 6:14, we read it. Stand therefore having
[1:23:06] your loans gird about with truth.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; You got to have truth.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Your enemy is a liar. That's right.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; He speaks lies.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; So, the prophet said, "Truth, it's the
[1:23:23] belt." It's a belt.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; He called it the girdle.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; It's a belt that you put around your
[1:23:31] waist and and you buckle it on. He said,
[1:23:35] "That's the belt that holds the rest of
[1:23:37] it together.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; It holds the rest of the armor
[1:23:40] together."
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; If you ain't got truth, your your
[1:23:43] armor's going to fall off. That's right.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Gird loans with truth. In the day,
[1:23:51] brother, when there's all kinds of isms
[1:23:53] and fanaticism, it's time to girdge
[1:23:55] yourself with the truth. Hallelujah.
[1:23:57] Jesus said, "I am the truth." See, the
[1:23:59] truth, he said, I tell you, when people
[1:24:01] say, "Well, what about this? What about
[1:24:02] that?" It's good to see that old truth
[1:24:05] buckle around you, knowing where you're
[1:24:08] standing, then stand there. Let them
[1:24:11] say, "Well, you have, you know, you have
[1:24:13] this and the other, but you know where
[1:24:16] you're standing." See, have the whole
[1:24:19] armor buckled on, gird around here,
[1:24:22] buckled down good and tight, pulled down
[1:24:24] with the truth of God's word anchored in
[1:24:26] your heart, and all devils in hell
[1:24:29] cannot upset you. And you can meet Satan
[1:24:32] and say, "It's written."
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now, if you ain't got
[1:24:38] buckled truth, then you'll never be able
[1:24:40] to say that.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you may say it for once cuz you
[1:24:43] remembered what the preacher said about
[1:24:45] it.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; But once you get in your trials, you'll
[1:24:48] forget what the Bible says about if you
[1:24:49] ain't got truth buckled down.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Sat you down. I mean, hard.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Get it down tight.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; So, this is why we we better know what
[1:25:03] truth is.
[1:25:05] Someone comes to you and say, "Well, I
[1:25:06] don't believe that brother Brandon was
[1:25:07] the seventh angel."
[1:25:09] I
[1:25:12] don't listen to it.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to listen to it. No, it
[1:25:16] sounds good. The explanation sounds
[1:25:18] great, but nah, you're buckled around
[1:25:21] with truth.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; See, so this is why we better know now.
[1:25:29] You know, Sister Kim was telling me
[1:25:31] yesterday she's in the hospital. you
[1:25:33] know, a thing just got out of surgery or
[1:25:35] whatever. And and there was days that
[1:25:37] she actually she said she just felt like
[1:25:39] she was going to die. And that's when
[1:25:42] Satan would come to her and she, you
[1:25:44] know, she, you know, uh she could tell
[1:25:47] you, you know, but something began to
[1:25:49] tell her in her mind, you're going to
[1:25:52] die. This is the end of it. This is this
[1:25:56] is the last. You're finished.
[1:26:00] You didn't hear an audible audible
[1:26:02] voice, did you? No. See, it it just
[1:26:04] began to come in her thoughts.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Now, now that wasn't her thinking that
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; that was Satan come to her at her
[1:26:11] weakest time
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; to tell her, "You're finished. It's
[1:26:15] over."
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; So, but because God had sent a prophet,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; with the message of truth and told her
[1:26:23] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[1:26:26] today, and forever.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, "No weapon
[1:26:30] formed against you shall prosper.
[1:26:33] Can you say amen?
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; She began to recognize, hold it, that's
[1:26:36] not from me. That's Satan talking to me.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; That's Satan putting them thoughts in my
[1:26:43] mind. So I start believing that.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Trained to the word, trained on how to
[1:26:51] meet your enemy.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; See, he was trying to anoint her with
[1:26:58] unbelief. So what did she do? She began
[1:27:00] to talk back.
[1:27:02] I'm not finished.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; I've still got more to live. That's
[1:27:06] right.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; And she got praising God, lifting her
[1:27:08] hand, praising God in that hospital
[1:27:10] room, and that thing left her
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; trained.
[1:27:19] That's right.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham tells us how to
[1:27:24] overcome. Overcome means to recognize
[1:27:26] the devil and every one of his tricks.
[1:27:29] A lot of people say there is no devil.
[1:27:30] It's just a thought. Don't you believe
[1:27:32] that? There's a real devil and he's just
[1:27:34] as real as you are or anybody. A real
[1:27:37] devil and you must recognize him real.
[1:27:39] You must know he's a real devil. Same
[1:27:41] time at the same time you recognize and
[1:27:44] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:27:46] you. Then to overcome, you must
[1:27:48] recognize that God in you is greater and
[1:27:50] mightier than he is.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So God is greater and mightier than that
[1:27:57] tumor, Sister Martha.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He's greater and mightier than that
[1:28:02] stone that the doctor can't get out.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He's greater and mightier than anything.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; He's God in you. Now, notice how he
[1:28:12] places it. Not God in heaven is greater.
[1:28:14] God in you is greater
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; and mightier than he is. That's the one
[1:28:21] that's in you has already overcome him.
[1:28:25] And by his grace, you're more than a
[1:28:27] match for him. Now, what's happening?
[1:28:29] The prophet is training us as soldiers.
[1:28:32] Training us.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; This message trains us.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; By his grace, you are more than a match
[1:28:43] for him. Amen. There's real overcoming
[1:28:47] when you recognize, recognize the devil
[1:28:50] is real. Recognize the devil is against
[1:28:52] you and he's trying to destroy you. But
[1:28:55] recognize the God in you is greater than
[1:28:57] he is. and that you're more than a
[1:28:59] match.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So, there's real overcoming when you
[1:29:07] recognize you look back and say, "I'm
[1:29:08] doing this and I'm doing that." And then
[1:29:11] no, you're defeated. But there's no
[1:29:13] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:29:15] Jesus that walk not after the flesh, but
[1:29:17] after the spirit. Then you realize that
[1:29:19] you've overcome. You know that he's a
[1:29:21] devil. You can't say I got sickness and
[1:29:24] I don't believe it is a, you know, uh,
[1:29:27] and I don't believe it is a sickness.
[1:29:29] You know, some people go that far. Say,
[1:29:31] well, I just don't believe I'm sick. I'm
[1:29:32] just going to ignore it. I just don't
[1:29:33] believe I'm sick. He goes, yes, you got
[1:29:35] sickness.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it is a sickness. Oh,
[1:29:43] yes, it is a sickness. You got cancer.
[1:29:45] See, don't don't believe it is a cancer.
[1:29:47] It is a cancer. It is a cancer. But
[1:29:50] remember, greater is he
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; that's in you than he that's in this
[1:29:55] world. You must realize, see, it's not
[1:29:58] just ignoring the problem that's going
[1:30:00] to get you to overcome.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Well, it ain't there. Well, if it's
[1:30:04] hurting, it's hurting.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; If it's there, it's there.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; So, you're recognizing that the devil is
[1:30:11] attacking you.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hello. But also remember, greater is he
[1:30:17] that's in you than he that's in the
[1:30:19] world. You must realize that the Holy
[1:30:21] Spirit that's in you has already
[1:30:23] overcome this thing.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; So don't fear it.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; You're a soldier.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Kid gets a snotty nose. Oh my goodness.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; It's going to get worse.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Are you trained to be a soldier? you
[1:30:43] trained to fight.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; You must realize that the Holy Spirit
[1:30:49] that's in you has already overcome the
[1:30:51] thing. He's in you and you can overcome
[1:30:54] by him. That's exactly sensible exactly
[1:30:59] the way the scripture is written.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; So we must not look at the things that
[1:31:05] we can see.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we will not recognize our
[1:31:10] enemy Satan
[1:31:12] if we only look at the natural things.
[1:31:15] Now,
[1:31:17] speaking of people not recognizing, the
[1:31:20] Bible predicted that in this day people
[1:31:22] would be without understanding
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; in this last day. And and so this makes
[1:31:29] way for the greatest deception of all
[1:31:31] time because people are without
[1:31:34] understanding. Sad thing is they don't
[1:31:36] want to understand.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; They want to look at everybody as love
[1:31:41] and peace, kind. They don't want to look
[1:31:44] at it as that man could be anointed of a
[1:31:47] spirit to wreck your marriage.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Wreck a church.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; They don't want to look at that
[1:31:53] everybody's nice, everybody's kind, and
[1:31:57] good way for deception.
[1:32:00] Come on.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Remember when Israel wanted to be like
[1:32:04] the heathen nations? They wanted a king
[1:32:07] instead of a prophet.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't long after the king uh
[1:32:12] Saul was anointed to be king. The enemy
[1:32:16] came in and put out the right eye of a
[1:32:20] lot of God's people.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He put the right eye out. And the
[1:32:24] prophet says if he can put the spiritual
[1:32:27] sight out of your eye
[1:32:30] where you see the natural things and not
[1:32:32] the spiritual things, he's got you
[1:32:34] whipped right there.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; As long as you can have churches, big
[1:32:40] places, fine intellectual dress people
[1:32:42] and so forth, as long as your eye looks
[1:32:45] like that and don't see the spirit side,
[1:32:48] the enemy's got you under his control
[1:32:50] cuz you don't know where you're going.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:32:53] See, it it it takes somebody to
[1:32:56] recognize the enemy.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Where's the enemy coming at? Where is he
[1:33:00] coming at my home?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Why aren't my children wanting to go to
[1:33:05] church more like they used to?
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Duh.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Well, it's just teenagers.
[1:33:13] Really?
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of teenagers that like
[1:33:19] to come to church. That's right.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Well, well, why? Why? Why? Why are we
[1:33:26] having more Why are we struggling
[1:33:27] spiritually? What's going on?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you got to take a step back
[1:33:33] and look in the spirit realm
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; and see what's happening.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. You allow the movies in your
[1:33:41] home. That old stupid television, you've
[1:33:43] allowed unseen forces in your home.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Listen to ungodly music, you're allowing
[1:33:49] it. That's right. That's right.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; It's just true.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Talking about one another, talking about
[1:33:57] the preacher, talking about the church.
[1:33:59] Nobody loves me and I just need to do
[1:34:00] this. I just need to leave. I need to
[1:34:02] move away. I just need this cuz I'm just
[1:34:04] not loved. You just you don't understand
[1:34:07] what you're doing.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; And then no wonder your family's having
[1:34:11] a hard time. And no wonder you can't
[1:34:13] keep victory. No wonder you can't do
[1:34:15] that. You're just listening to a devil.
[1:34:18] He's riding on you just as much as he's
[1:34:21] riding on the stirrups of a woman that's
[1:34:23] got earrings on.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Prophet called them earring stirrups.
[1:34:28] You know, said it was a devil stirrups.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; But I also believe he rides on a lot of
[1:34:40] people
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; that come to church. right?
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Tells them not to go to church cuz they
[1:34:46] just, you know, they just well, they're
[1:34:48] too tired. Well, just, you know, I don't
[1:34:51] know. I got to get up in the morning, go
[1:34:53] to work. You know, as I said before, you
[1:34:56] could lose that job.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You could lose your health.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; You could lose your arms. You could lose
[1:35:01] You could get in a in a car wreck and
[1:35:03] lose your legs.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; You could lose your family.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You could lose your mind.
[1:35:12] Nothing is as important as the house of
[1:35:15] God, the things of God, taking care of
[1:35:18] the things of God.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But what is it? We're
[1:35:22] fighting an enemy.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; And as long as you don't see the spirit
[1:35:27] side of it, the enemy's got you under
[1:35:30] his control cuz you don't know where
[1:35:32] you're going.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Uh if if a man cannot
[1:35:37] see the spirit side, then he can easily
[1:35:39] be gi given over to every wind of
[1:35:41] doctrine that comes along.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He can easily be given over to his
[1:35:45] emotions and his feelings and and all of
[1:35:48] these things cuz he's not seeing that
[1:35:51] Satan's playing on his emotions. Satan's
[1:35:53] playing on her feelings.
[1:35:56] someone to say he will cause someone to
[1:35:58] say something against you
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; or or maybe to say something that they
[1:36:03] didn't even mean to say, but because
[1:36:06] you're not trained, you allow that thing
[1:36:09] to start working up. How many people
[1:36:12] take a situation that ain't even true
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; and they think it's true, they go start
[1:36:18] blabbing it all over
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; because they don't recognize a spirit
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; that is at work. It's an enemy
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; so if if we can't see the spirit side, a
[1:36:35] man will play right into the hands of
[1:36:37] his real enemy if he's not careful.
[1:36:41] The Bible says that we wrestle not
[1:36:42] against flesh and blood. Everybody say,
[1:36:44] "We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; but against principalities,
[1:36:49] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:36:51] the darkness of this world, against
[1:36:53] spiritual wickedness in high places."
[1:36:55] Can you say, "Amen." It may look like
[1:36:57] you're waring against your brother and
[1:36:59] sister, but you're not.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; It may look like you're waring against
[1:37:02] your employee or your employer, but
[1:37:05] you're not. It may look like you're
[1:37:07] waring against a man that hates you and
[1:37:10] speaking against you. Amen. And would
[1:37:13] kill you if he could, but you're not.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; So, you must not make this about flesh
[1:37:22] and blood.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Don't make your warfare about flesh and
[1:37:27] blood.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; He says something, I'll get him back.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Twerp.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Don't make it about flesh and blood.
[1:37:36] That's right.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Satan has destroyed enemies or or or
[1:37:40] families. He's destroyed marriages. He's
[1:37:42] destroyed churches.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Because people can't recognize
[1:37:49] the spirit,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; their enemy.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; You may excommunicate a person that's
[1:37:56] done you wrong.
[1:37:58] You may even kill the person that's
[1:38:00] talking about you, but you haven't done
[1:38:02] anything to your enemy by doing it.
[1:38:06] Are you with me?
[1:38:18] Well, I just going to walk away from
[1:38:19] you. I ain't going to have nothing to do
[1:38:20] with them again. Go right ahead.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing at all.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Your enemy is still right there.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; The problem is you're going to hate the
[1:38:32] other guy, too.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; And you're going to hate the other guy,
[1:38:35] too.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; And you're going to excommunicate this
[1:38:37] girl, too. And you're going to
[1:38:39] excommunicate. Before you know it,
[1:38:40] you've excommunicated the church. You've
[1:38:42] excommunicated the world. and you're
[1:38:44] standing all by yourself without
[1:38:46] friends, without without God, without
[1:38:49] the church, without nothing
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; because you looked at it as flesh and
[1:38:55] blood
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and your enemy is still there working on
[1:39:03] you.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Tell your heart so bitter,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; can't smile no more, can't be joyful in
[1:39:10] God anymore.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; You're stripped of victory. You're
[1:39:14] stripped of faith. You're stripped of
[1:39:15] everything.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; How many men have caused their families
[1:39:18] to leave a church and go out and not
[1:39:20] Well, we just played tapes. Oh, really?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Anyone that goes around playing tapes
[1:39:26] and don't go to a church and don't hook
[1:39:28] up to a house of God, watch their
[1:39:30] families. Look at their children.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Look at their families.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; They're in a mess.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Why? because the enemy's got them to
[1:39:40] where they're away from the they're cut
[1:39:41] off from the the the the the lifeline.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; I hope that's all right,
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Don't make it about flesh and blood.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't it funny how Satan gets us to use
[1:39:57] excuses? Well, there's hypocrites in the
[1:39:59] church, so I just ain't going to listen
[1:40:00] to the message.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; What does that have to do with the
[1:40:02] message? That's right.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Had, you know, had that one preacher
[1:40:07] tell me sat down four and a half hours
[1:40:09] and he spent them four and a half hours
[1:40:11] trying to convince me against this
[1:40:13] message. And he told me, he said, "If I
[1:40:14] tell you everything that went in them
[1:40:16] was in that tabernacle while Brandon was
[1:40:18] up there, he knew all that stuff was
[1:40:20] going on. And yet he said they got the
[1:40:22] Holy Ghost and he treated them like
[1:40:24] brothers. If I told you everything went
[1:40:26] on, you'd walk away." I said, "No, I
[1:40:27] wouldn't."
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to walk away.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; But see what it is? Satan gets us to
[1:40:32] looking at something here and we then
[1:40:35] blame the message.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But see, God is known by his
[1:40:44] characteristics and so is Satan known by
[1:40:46] his characteristics.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; And I tell you this, Satan's not a
[1:40:49] person of peace.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; He's destructive.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Is this all right?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Satan is not a person of peace. Satan is
[1:41:01] not for brotherhood.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Satan is not He He He God does not put
[1:41:07] depression on you.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; God does not put oppression on you.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; He's not a person of peace. Look, look,
[1:41:19] look at the nations that are fighting
[1:41:20] today.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't it funny? They're all calling
[1:41:24] calling for world peace.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Peace through strength. Got a president
[1:41:30] wants to be known for peace
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and every time he turns around he's
[1:41:35] starting wars
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; threatening to fight threatening this.
[1:41:40] Threatening that. It ain't going to
[1:41:42] stop.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Fix a hole here. Another hole's leaking
[1:41:48] over here. Fix that hole. Another hole's
[1:41:50] leaking over here. You can't stop it.
[1:41:53] Satan is in control of these things.
[1:41:55] Satan is in control of politics. He's in
[1:41:58] control of religion. He's in control of
[1:42:00] government. He's in control of of
[1:42:02] education and science. And he's in
[1:42:05] control of it all.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And the prophet told us that spirit
[1:42:09] nations, each nations has their own
[1:42:11] spirit, demon spirits. And these spirits
[1:42:14] get jealous of one another.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; It ain't people,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; it's spirits.
[1:42:24] spirits get jealous of one another and
[1:42:26] anoint people.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; And they start fighting,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; fighting over oil,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; fighting over power,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; fighting over this, fighting over that.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; See, we're only seeing men with grenades
[1:42:45] and bazookas and bombs and,
[1:42:49] you know,
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. all of that. But the prophet in
[1:42:52] dealing with the spirit world gives an
[1:42:54] insight to what's really going on.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Satan causes situations to arise to get
[1:42:59] at you.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He works through people and causes them
[1:43:03] to act up to get at you.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, church. It's true.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; You get a blessing from God. You just
[1:43:11] watch. If you're not trained,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; you'll lose it.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Get your joy. Get your faith. get to
[1:43:19] where you just, oh God, I I just really
[1:43:21] I believe it. I'm going to claim you at
[1:43:24] your word and watch Satan work in every
[1:43:27] way he can to take that away from you.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; And if you're not trained, you go right
[1:43:32] back in the same rut that you always.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; He likes to stir up trouble.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; He's the one that puts sickness upon us
[1:43:41] and diseases.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Satan dwells in a negative atmosphere.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Always. He gets people to
[1:43:49] think negative thoughts, speak negative
[1:43:52] words. He creates a negative atmosphere.
[1:43:56] And anything that is against God's word
[1:43:59] is negative.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; For God's word is always positive. Do
[1:44:02] you believe that?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; He is the one that tries to get you to
[1:44:05] disbelieve. He tries to get you out of
[1:44:07] God's will. He tries to get your spirit
[1:44:09] all tore up so that you can't hear God's
[1:44:12] voice. He's the one that tries to get
[1:44:14] you upset. He's the one that gets you
[1:44:16] weary and get you to worrying over
[1:44:18] things. He's the one who tries to get us
[1:44:20] unsettled. And you you understand what
[1:44:23] I'm saying? He he's the one that causes
[1:44:25] uh uh discord among the brethren. He
[1:44:28] gets people to talking about people in
[1:44:30] the church to others. He tries to get us
[1:44:32] distracted from what God is doing in our
[1:44:34] life. It it it's just a constant war.
[1:44:37] Constant war. Constant war. Revival and
[1:44:40] then Satan comes in with a blow.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:44] That's right.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet told us that demons are
[1:44:49] powerless unless they're embodied. Yeah.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Remember, and I I'll hurry here, but
[1:44:55] remember when Jesus cast those demons
[1:44:57] out of the man of Geria,
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; before they went, they pleaded unto him
[1:45:04] to let them go
[1:45:07] into the hogs.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Because they have to have something to
[1:45:12] embody in order to destroy.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; So, demons go from place to place.
[1:45:19] Remember, it's just like Jesus said that
[1:45:23] when a demon leaves the house, when a
[1:45:25] spirit leaves a house, let's say a human
[1:45:27] being, cuz that's what he's talking
[1:45:29] about, he will leave.
[1:45:32] But then there comes a time he comes
[1:45:34] back to that person
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; and he finds that house empty. He finds
[1:45:42] it empty.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Then he goes and gets seven spirits
[1:45:46] worse.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:48] and they come in and buy it because they
[1:45:50] have to have something to live in
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; in order to destroy. If you let him use
[1:45:56] your mouth, he'll take it.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; If you let him just put thoughts in your
[1:46:00] mind and you start dwelling on it, he'll
[1:46:01] faint. He'll take it.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You see the warfare?
[1:46:06] So, so you got to fight every day of
[1:46:07] your life.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't care if you've been a
[1:46:10] hundred years in the message and you're
[1:46:12] just a stout, strong individual. It
[1:46:14] doesn't matter. You got to stay on your
[1:46:16] guard all the time. Amen.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; You got to stay with the word all the
[1:46:20] time.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; It's a fight fight fight. Can you say
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; So they go from demons go from place to
[1:46:28] place, from home to home. You you don't
[1:46:30] have to have your children go out in the
[1:46:31] world.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; I don't believe it.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; You you you don't have to have your home
[1:46:39] wrecked up.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I just don't believe it.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Hello. Yeah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; I I I I just don't believe that you have
[1:46:46] to, you know, you you you have to have a
[1:46:48] church wrecked up. I I just don't
[1:46:50] believe it. But see, demons go from
[1:46:52] place to place, home to home, church to
[1:46:55] church, from man to man, looking for a
[1:46:57] place to come in. Looking for a place
[1:46:59] that'll give him the power to do what he
[1:47:01] wants to do.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what a prophet said? Satan
[1:47:05] is powerless. He was already defeated.
[1:47:08] But he can bluff you.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And you listen to his bluff. You've
[1:47:12] actually empowered him.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's right.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; See, so the only way he could get to Eve
[1:47:20] was through the serpent.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; But it was Satan.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we read where uh
[1:47:30] uh
[1:47:31] God wanted to deceive Ahab. So he said,
[1:47:34] "Who will go forth that deceive Ahab?" A
[1:47:37] lion spirit come from up from beneath
[1:47:39] and said, "I'll go." Yeah.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; God says, "All right, you'll go and you
[1:47:43] shall prevail." How did he do it? By
[1:47:45] getting in to 400 men.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Now, Ahab couldn't see it.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Them 400 men couldn't see it.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But here come a prophet
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; that he could see in the spirit realm.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "I know why you say those
[1:48:02] things. There's a lying spirit on you."
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, so Satan has to
[1:48:10] work through something. Why? Why do we
[1:48:13] have false prophets, false Christs,
[1:48:16] false teachers, false prophets?
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:48:21] Now that lion spirit could have gotten
[1:48:23] on all four of them hund 400 prophets
[1:48:25] but he couldn't get on that prophet
[1:48:26] Makaya
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; cuz the prophet says that that that when
[1:48:31] when Isaiah or when Micaiah was sent out
[1:48:34] there or and and said you know the king
[1:48:36] is wanting you and and and and you you
[1:48:39] want you to say something and let him
[1:48:42] know he the prophet and and you know I
[1:48:45] don't know how it all goes but the
[1:48:46] prophet just lets us know just kind of
[1:48:48] you know he says he got in the Bible
[1:48:51] Yeah.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And he thought, you know what? If them
[1:48:54] 400 prophets are saying the same thing
[1:48:56] going up, there's got to be something
[1:48:57] wrong with that.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; So he says, "We're going to go in the
[1:49:00] Bible." And he began to check
[1:49:01] prophecies. And he found the prophecy of
[1:49:04] Ali of Elijah that had prophesied Ahab's
[1:49:08] doom. And something clicked in him and
[1:49:11] said, "This is the day."
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Hello. You see, instead of just
[1:49:17] listening to everything, stay with the
[1:49:20] prophet's message.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So, Satan's got to work through somebody
[1:49:28] to accomplish his agenda.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Love one
[1:49:33] another above everything. Love one
[1:49:35] another no matter what the devil tries
[1:49:37] to say." No matter what he tries to say.
[1:49:39] You're all one great big sweet group
[1:49:42] now. But remember my warning. Satan
[1:49:44] won't let it stay that way. No sir.
[1:49:46] He'll shoot everything. If he has to
[1:49:48] bring somebody in to make his target,
[1:49:50] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever
[1:49:52] in, set him down, and cause him to
[1:49:54] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:49:56] and things, and then he'll shoot that
[1:49:58] guy with a some kind of a poison stuff,
[1:50:00] and he'll start through the church with
[1:50:02] it.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; See, don't you take sides with it.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you have nothing to do with
[1:50:09] anything else. You stay right, loving,
[1:50:10] sweet, and kind to one another. Pray for
[1:50:13] that man that he'll be saved too or that
[1:50:15] woman or whoever it is. Just pray for
[1:50:17] them and stick with one another.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Stay with your pastor. He's the
[1:50:21] shepherd. You give him respects. He'll
[1:50:23] lead you through because he's ordained
[1:50:24] of God to do so.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you remember that the enemy will
[1:50:28] come, not might come, not maybe come. He
[1:50:32] might just pass you.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Y'all stay quiet enough.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; He'll walk down the street and he won't
[1:50:39] even know you're there.
[1:50:41] No, he will come.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And when he does, here's some training.
[1:50:51] Just cling that much closer together.
[1:50:54] And the one that the devil is using for
[1:50:56] an enemy will either get out or come in
[1:50:58] and be one of you. Don't never clan
[1:51:00] among or talk or make yourself clenish.
[1:51:03] We are one. I couldn't say my left hand,
[1:51:05] I'm mad at you. I'm going to take you
[1:51:06] away cuz you're not a right hand. He's
[1:51:09] my left hand. I want him to stay there.
[1:51:11] Even the little tip of my finger, I want
[1:51:14] to uh stay right there. Every little
[1:51:16] part of my body stay right there. And
[1:51:19] God wants us as a body of believers to
[1:51:22] stay right exactly with one another.
[1:51:24] Right with one another. He said, "Now,
[1:51:27] you've got tapes on that. You got tapes
[1:51:28] on what we believe. You got tapes on
[1:51:30] discipline in the church. How we behave
[1:51:32] oursel in the church of God. How we uh
[1:51:34] got to come to get here. how we got to
[1:51:37] come here together and sit together in
[1:51:38] heavenly places. Don't stay home. If God
[1:51:41] is in your heart, you can't hardly wait
[1:51:43] for them doors to open out yonder to get
[1:51:45] in here to fellowship with your
[1:51:46] brothers.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; That now Satan's got him a lot convinced
[1:51:51] that home is my church. My home is my
[1:51:53] church.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what the prophet just said.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Got to be buckled up with truth.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Don't stay home. That's right.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't
[1:52:06] hardly wait for them doors to open
[1:52:07] yonder. Get it to get in here to
[1:52:09] fellowship with your brothers. If you
[1:52:11] don't don't feel that way, then I tell
[1:52:14] you, it's time you got to praying
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; cuz we're in the last days where the
[1:52:18] Bible exhorted us to more as we see that
[1:52:22] that day approach and to love one
[1:52:23] another with Christian love and divine
[1:52:25] love to assemble ourselves together in
[1:52:27] heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love
[1:52:29] one another. This will all men know you
[1:52:31] are my disciples when you have love one
[1:52:33] for the other.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. Stay right together.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Now, believe it or not, as we get ready
[1:52:43] to close, the prophet tells us that it's
[1:52:46] not only evil people that Satan works
[1:52:48] through.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Satan will work through people that
[1:52:55] brother Brandham called precious people.
[1:52:57] Yeah,
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; they innocently get under the influence
[1:53:00] of the wrong spirit.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandon was starting on the
[1:53:05] series, Revelation series chapter 5,
[1:53:10] he talked of how he had been in the
[1:53:11] ministry for 31 years and for the Lord.
[1:53:15] And he said, "You know, I was thinking
[1:53:16] about looking back down along the trail
[1:53:19] where I've come through and seen the
[1:53:21] different hills and brier patches and
[1:53:23] rocks and hard places and smooth
[1:53:26] runningings and what I did in those kind
[1:53:28] of times. It'll all show up on these
[1:53:30] days at the hour of my going away."
[1:53:33] It'll do that on each one of us. We will
[1:53:36] all be sure of that. It'll show up to
[1:53:38] each one that when that time comes. And
[1:53:42] and if you just well you just hear any
[1:53:44] message but he was so careful not to
[1:53:48] bring a reproach to Christ and always
[1:53:51] careful not to exalt himself and always
[1:53:54] careful to give God glory
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; right
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; you never have to had to worry you never
[1:54:00] have to worry about any message where
[1:54:02] brother Brandham exalts himself I hear
[1:54:04] these ungodly well I won't call them
[1:54:07] idiots but critics that that say one
[1:54:11] said, you know, he's he's he's really
[1:54:13] working hard, minister in North
[1:54:15] Carolina. He is really working hard to
[1:54:17] get people turned from this message. And
[1:54:19] and he he was he was saying he says, you
[1:54:22] know, he says, none of these preachers
[1:54:24] none of these message preachers can
[1:54:26] accept a challenge at any of he said,
[1:54:28] just like Brandham couldn't.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And I thought, what a ding-dong.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham accepted challenges all
[1:54:35] the time.
[1:54:37] But see, it's Satan working
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; trying to get the those that are
[1:54:41] unsettled to think that brother Brandon
[1:54:43] was a coward
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; that he couldn't defend the message.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; We know where we're standing.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; But we're not going to cast our pearls
[1:54:51] before swine.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; If they want to debate, we ain't going
[1:54:54] to stand there and debate them.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; But we know where we stand.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; The prophet made a challenge to anyone
[1:55:01] around the world. Come up. Come up.
[1:55:03] Stand right by me. They wouldn't do it
[1:55:05] because they knew an angel was standing
[1:55:06] right there.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; And he made it clear, if I am a false
[1:55:10] prophet, I'll drop dead. If you're a
[1:55:12] false prophet, you drop dead.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; None of them would do it.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; But he was so careful as not to bring a
[1:55:23] reproach. And if he said, you know, if
[1:55:25] there was anything in his heart, it was
[1:55:27] to hear the words from our Lord, well
[1:55:29] done, thou good and faithful servant. He
[1:55:31] said, 'If anything I always wanted to be
[1:55:33] and desires of my heart to be was a true
[1:55:36] servant to Christ Jesus and my Lord and
[1:55:39] Savior. I want my testimony to be clean,
[1:55:41] clearcut, that I stood in all of my
[1:55:44] mistakes, yet I loved him with all my
[1:55:46] heart and I do that this morning with
[1:55:48] all of my heart.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; But as he's talking, then he says, "I'm
[1:55:52] going to leave the field." Remember that
[1:55:53] he tells the people, he says, "Now I'm
[1:55:55] leaving the field." He said, "Something
[1:55:57] has risen up amongst the people
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; that caused him caused me to make this
[1:56:04] decision." And he says, "Now, this is
[1:56:06] what something's come up among the
[1:56:08] people." He said, "I've been taken from
[1:56:11] my bracket of a minister or brother and
[1:56:14] being called Jesus Christ."
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; That would brand me as an antichrist.
[1:56:19] And if you're hearing him say these
[1:56:20] things, he's he's broken up. He is
[1:56:22] crushed.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; He's not bragging. I mean, he is
[1:56:26] crushed. It's it's go listen to the
[1:56:29] sermon. It's at the beginning.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; And he he says, you know, he said, uh,
[1:56:35] that would brand me as an antichrist and
[1:56:37] I'll meet God as a quitter before I
[1:56:39] would meet him as an antichrist to take
[1:56:41] away from him.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; He said, I stood still. If people called
[1:56:45] me a prophet many times because a
[1:56:47] prophet in the English testament is just
[1:56:49] a preacher, a prophesy, foreteller of
[1:56:51] the word and so forth, I'd stand for
[1:56:53] that because you could just kind of push
[1:56:55] that down. But when it comes to be
[1:56:57] calling uh uh anointed Christ or
[1:57:00] something that was too much for me. I
[1:57:02] just can't stand it. See, he said, I
[1:57:04] heard of it a few years ago. I thought
[1:57:06] it was a joke and I met a couple
[1:57:08] brethren. He said, which I don't see
[1:57:10] neither of them in the meeting this
[1:57:11] morning. two or three of them one time
[1:57:13] in a fishing trip and they approached me
[1:57:15] by the subject of saying, "Brother
[1:57:16] Brandham, aren't you the anointed
[1:57:18] Messiah, the Christ?" And I put my arms
[1:57:20] around the neck of both brethren or all
[1:57:22] of them. And I said, "Brethren, as much
[1:57:24] as I have tried to be a true servant of
[1:57:26] Christ, I would not that you would say
[1:57:29] such a thing as that. If it would ever
[1:57:32] be said of me, then I will leave the
[1:57:35] field with a clear conscience. and you
[1:57:37] who do that will be responsible for
[1:57:39] every soul that I would have saved
[1:57:41] during that time for taking me from the
[1:57:43] field. And I thought that ended it. He
[1:57:45] said, "Well, the other day in Canada, a
[1:57:47] brother showed me a little ticket of a
[1:57:48] thing he's packed in his pocket. Said,
[1:57:50] William Brandham is our Lord. Baptiz it
[1:57:53] in the name of William Brham and a
[1:57:55] little precious. If it had been an
[1:57:57] enemy, if it had been my enemy, someone
[1:58:00] that was totally against the message,
[1:58:02] hated him, he said, you know, I would
[1:58:04] have known it was a joke. But a precious
[1:58:07] darling brother come up to confess his
[1:58:10] sins and his wrongs and say his faith in
[1:58:13] me as being Jesus Christ.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He said after leaving the meeting at
[1:58:18] Canada, I found out that way up in the
[1:58:21] Eskimos or the Indians up there, it had
[1:58:23] got amongst them. And so it just tore me
[1:58:26] all up. And the hunting trip that I had
[1:58:28] planned to take, you know, planned so
[1:58:30] long I could not take it. I was afraid
[1:58:31] of a hunting accident if you understand
[1:58:33] what I mean. I got so shaky worse than I
[1:58:36] am standing here now. And and I just
[1:58:38] couldn't stand it any longer to think
[1:58:40] that 31 years of ministry went down the
[1:58:43] devil's gutter pipe.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; When I'm gone, what will they say? See,
[1:58:48] there he is. That's exactly what it was.
[1:58:50] All the influence that I had upon the
[1:58:52] people, then you see where it'd be. I'd
[1:58:54] be an antichrist. And I just couldn't
[1:58:56] stand it. I thought I'd rather die here
[1:58:58] in the woods like I fell on my gun or
[1:59:00] something. See? Then then I and then I
[1:59:03] though my little Joseph for and so forth
[1:59:06] that had to be raised, I was in no
[1:59:08] condition to hunt. So I just left the
[1:59:10] woods and come on home. I've been torn
[1:59:11] up. See now he says now if it would have
[1:59:14] been some enemy of mine, it would have
[1:59:17] been all right. I would have just
[1:59:19] laughed at it, went on. But when it come
[1:59:21] to being precious brothers, precious
[1:59:23] sisters, then that's what hurt me. And I
[1:59:26] said, "Lord, this this thing's too great
[1:59:29] for me. I'll just have to walk out and
[1:59:31] leave it in your hands. I don't know
[1:59:32] what nothing else. Now, brother Brandham
[1:59:34] or the Lord showed brother Brandham a
[1:59:36] vision as to what was going on. Now,
[1:59:38] notice he said, I seen a serpent which
[1:59:42] was yellow and black and telling me
[1:59:44] right along and the thing struck me on
[1:59:48] the leg, but the blood was so rich it
[1:59:51] didn't take effect on me. And I looked
[1:59:54] down and there's where I had been bit
[1:59:56] before. I turned quickly with the gun
[1:59:59] and shot the thing and hit it right in
[2:00:00] the mi right in the middle of it. And
[2:00:03] the brother said, "I turned with my gun
[2:00:05] to shoot his head off." And he said,
[2:00:07] "Don't do that. Just pick up the stick
[2:00:09] laying there by you." And when I turned
[2:00:11] back to pick up the stick, the snake
[2:00:14] withered into some water. Uh just some
[2:00:17] puddle of water. So he didn't kill that
[2:00:19] thing,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; but he was showing that spirit that was
[2:00:23] upon them precious brothers,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; precious sisters, right?
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; But he didn't kill it. He said, "Well,
[2:00:30] it can't hurt very much longer cuz I
[2:00:32] believe uh the brother realizes or the
[2:00:35] brethren what that what would happen.
[2:00:38] It's mortally wounded, so it'll die."
[2:00:41] See? Well, then he goes on. He goes,
[2:00:43] "Brothers, sisters, haven't I tried to
[2:00:45] be a true servant of Christ before you?
[2:00:48] Have not I tried to be your brother?"
[2:00:50] Now, what wherever it is, it's a spirit
[2:00:54] on precious people,
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; people that loved him, people that loved
[2:01:02] the message that he brought, people that
[2:01:06] was his friends.
[2:01:08] And yet through all of that, brother
[2:01:11] Brandham was able to look beyond the
[2:01:13] natural and see a snake, a spirit. And
[2:01:19] he didn't call them evil people. He
[2:01:21] called them precious people.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; I I hope you understand them people
[2:01:31] didn't realize what they're doing and
[2:01:32] they still don't because that thing's
[2:01:34] still alive.
[2:01:36] There are people that are baptizing in
[2:01:38] the prophet's name. They're taking that
[2:01:41] picture and while they're baptizing,
[2:01:43] they're holding it up over the person
[2:01:45] during baptism.
[2:01:47] It It's wacko.
[2:01:50] And you think, well, they're evil
[2:01:52] people. They're ungodly people. Yet,
[2:01:54] Brother Brham says they're precious
[2:01:56] people.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And yet, they don't know. They
[2:02:00] don't know the spirit that they're of.
[2:02:02] Just like Peter didn't know when Jesus
[2:02:04] began to show his disciples of what was
[2:02:06] going to happen to him. He's going to
[2:02:07] die and all that. Peter rebuked him and
[2:02:10] said, "No, you ain't going to die." And
[2:02:13] Jesus turned around and says, "Get
[2:02:15] behind me, Satan."
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; Now, he wasn't calling Peter a devil.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; He was looking at the spirit that was
[2:02:23] using Peter.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; He that spirit was getting to Peter to
[2:02:28] get to him,
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:02:32] to get him to turn aside from the will
[2:02:35] of God. But Jesus knowing that spirit
[2:02:39] said, "No, Satan, get behind the hint.
[2:02:42] You're a hinder to me."
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:50] we find and and I I'll close here, but
[2:02:56] brother Brandham, you know, he's he's
[2:02:59] talking about Eve and the serpent and
[2:03:01] how the serpent he Satan used the
[2:03:04] serpent to turn Eve aside by saying,
[2:03:06] "You shall not surely die." Brother
[2:03:08] Brandham said, "See his tactic? What
[2:03:10] he's trying to do, that first human
[2:03:12] being, he's trying to anoint that
[2:03:14] precious woman there, God's daughter,
[2:03:17] with an unbelief in God's word." And
[2:03:21] that's exactly what he's trying to get
[2:03:23] her to do. See, Satan anoints what's his
[2:03:26] first tactic? What's his first place to
[2:03:29] get the mind? She stopped for a moment
[2:03:32] to listen to what he said. Oh, you don't
[2:03:35] say.
[2:03:38] But God gave us his word for our weapon.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And as the prophet said, it's Satan's
[2:03:47] job to get you to disbelieve your
[2:03:49] weapon.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He says, see here, we see the tactics of
[2:03:53] the devil. How how how do we do? I've
[2:03:56] got a lot of scripture here of prophets
[2:03:59] and things where he come to them and
[2:04:01] different peoples through the Bible and
[2:04:02] done the same thing. It's always his
[2:04:05] tactic is to try to get the people to
[2:04:07] disbelieve God's word. Listen, you
[2:04:10] soldiers of the cross. When you
[2:04:12] disbelieve one word of God's written
[2:04:14] Bible, you're disarmed.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; You're disarmed. You surrender, you
[2:04:18] jellyfish. You put on the whole armor of
[2:04:22] God. We're in a battle. What God said is
[2:04:24] true. Every man's word is a lie.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; But as soon as he gets you to listen to
[2:04:31] one thing, that's his tactic. You're
[2:04:33] disarmed. How many things did Eve have
[2:04:36] to listen to? Listen. How many things
[2:04:38] did Eve have to listen to? One.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; She was disarmed right then. What did
[2:04:45] the devil do? Swept right in through her
[2:04:47] mind into her spirit. And there she was
[2:04:49] perverted. She was perverted the very
[2:04:52] minute that she was disarmed when she
[2:04:54] disbelieved God's word.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And that's what he
[2:04:59] tries to get each one of you to do out
[2:05:01] there. anoint you. And the only thing
[2:05:03] you have to do, you're a free moral
[2:05:05] agent. Now, you can accept it if you
[2:05:07] want to, but kick it out.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; If Eve hadn't stopped that moment to
[2:05:12] listen. See, don't stop for nothing.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Don't stop for nothing.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; I know. I know it's justifiable. You can
[2:05:27] justify. Say, "Well, the guy's a liar.
[2:05:29] He lies all the time.
[2:05:32] Well, you can look at that and you can
[2:05:35] you can you can build your whole life
[2:05:39] and pattern your actions and everything
[2:05:41] around that and justify it. Or you can
[2:05:44] take God at his word and said, "I'll
[2:05:46] love that man anyways. I'll love that
[2:05:48] woman anyways.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; I'll treat him just the way God would
[2:05:52] want me to treat." Brother Brandham
[2:05:53] says, "Love that man that would kill you
[2:05:56] if he could."
[2:06:00] You believe it?
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're in a battle.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; He knows where to get us.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; He may not be able to get you, Brother
[2:06:09] Branson, to smoke a cigarette, but he'll
[2:06:12] get you in the way that you He knows he
[2:06:13] can get you.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; He'll get us.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; But he can't do it
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; if we have the word.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You don't have
[2:06:24] to fear that devil."
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Don't fear him.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. I He'll bring fear. Maybe
[2:06:30] some of you dealing with habits and you
[2:06:32] trying to get free from them habits and
[2:06:34] Satan's there saying you'll always have
[2:06:36] it. You'll always have it. You'll always
[2:06:38] fail. You'll always go through this this
[2:06:40] thing. And and then you start building
[2:06:42] that complex. You start building a fear
[2:06:44] of it. You start building a I wished I
[2:06:46] could. I wished I could. Well, won't you
[2:06:48] just look at that devil and say, "Devil,
[2:06:50] I don't have to fear you.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; I've got the word." and stand on that
[2:06:56] word and you'll watch that thing
[2:06:58] disappear.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; bless the Lord.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I love that word.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; You might have been delivered of
[2:07:10] something and you're free and you're
[2:07:12] going around, I'm free. I'm free. And
[2:07:14] give it give it a month, six months, and
[2:07:17] then Satan will come back around again.
[2:07:20] will.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; He'll come back around again with the
[2:07:23] same temptations, same desires,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; and then all of a sudden you think, "I
[2:07:28] thought I was free. Oh no. Oh, I know. I
[2:07:31] know. It's just a cat scratching at the
[2:07:33] door.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; You're free.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; Now fill that void up with faith. Fill
[2:07:40] that void up with God.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; And say, "You're not welcome here,
[2:07:44] devil.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; You're just not welcome."
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I hope it's helped you today.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love the Lord.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And you know, I know we're victorious
[2:08:02] because the word says we are.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Thinking of what brother Bram said, you
[2:08:07] know, talking about how the nations, we
[2:08:10] have improved on our weaponry.
[2:08:13] You know, we were throwing javelins and
[2:08:15] then we had our swords and little knives
[2:08:19] and horses
[2:08:22] back in the Revolutionary War. It was
[2:08:25] the dumbest thing. They'd all stand in
[2:08:28] line.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Facing each other and I'd be I' I'd be
[2:08:31] writing a real request. Can I stand in
[2:08:33] the back?
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz that sucker is going to die.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; And he just sits there and waits. Y'all
[2:08:43] shoot first.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; But we we've kind of grown up.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Now we're in age of airplanes and jets.
[2:08:56] Now it's drones.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; We're so improving in our machinery and
[2:09:01] our weaponry. But brother Brown said,
[2:09:03] "But if you notice, God never changes."
[2:09:06] God never changes with his weapon. He's
[2:09:08] given us the best to start with. It's
[2:09:11] still the best today.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad for that.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; I don't have to question. Say, "God, do
[2:09:17] you have something greater? I need it. I
[2:09:19] need it." No. He says, "It's right here.
[2:09:22] No matter how dark and the night is and
[2:09:24] no matter how great the enemy is, just
[2:09:26] stay with my word. Stay with my word and
[2:09:29] you'll overcome every bit. Every demon
[2:09:32] that comes against you, you will
[2:09:34] overcome them. Surrender yourself to
[2:09:37] it." Can you say amen?
[2:09:44] Oh, we've been made
[2:09:48] coner
[2:09:53] overcomers
[2:09:55] in this life.
[2:10:01] We've been made
[2:10:04] victorious.
[2:10:09] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:10:15] Oh, sing it again.
[2:10:18] We've been made more than coner,
[2:10:26] overcomers
[2:10:29] in this life.
[2:10:32] Glory to God.
[2:10:35] We've been made
[2:10:38] victorious
[2:10:43] through the blood of Jesus Christ. Do
[2:10:47] you believe that? Say it again. Unto the
[2:10:50] Lord. Oh, we've been made more than
[2:10:55] conquerors.
[2:10:59] Hallelujah.
[2:11:01] overcomers
[2:11:03] in this life.
[2:11:08] And we've been made
[2:11:12] victorious
[2:11:17] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:23] One more time.
[2:11:25] Oh, we've been made more than coner,
[2:11:34] overcomers
[2:11:36] in this life.
[2:11:41] Amen.
[2:11:42] We've been made
[2:11:45] victorious
[2:11:51] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:59] I'm going to rise.
[2:12:02] All rise.
[2:12:05] Rise above it all.

[2:12:32] church.
[2:12:34] Oh, rise.
[2:12:37] I've been trained.
[2:12:40] Nothing going to hold me down.
[2:12:43] Train
[2:12:45] that when I fall, I'll get back up
[2:12:47] again.
[2:12:48] Spread my wings,

[2:13:33] Oh, rise.
[2:13:36] Rise above it all.

[2:13:44] One thing about the word, it just washes
[2:13:46] us. It cleans us. It Thankful for that
[2:13:50] word of God.
[2:13:53] Hallelujah.
[2:13:55] Oh, rise above it all. I'm going to
[2:13:59] spread my wings. I'm going to spread my
[2:14:04] wings, fly away to heaven,
[2:14:10] fly above.

[2:23:43] but you're going to lose this battle
[2:23:46] tonight.
[2:23:47] Remember,
[2:23:50] you can't cross the bloodline.
[2:23:55] Now, church, sometimes
[2:23:58] our battles get hard
[2:24:01] and it seems we're fighting your love.
[2:24:04] Oh, but remember
[2:24:07] we're standing on the rock.
[2:24:13] So, Satan,
[2:24:15] if I were you,
[2:24:18] I'd turn around and give up, too.
[2:24:22] Because I believe.
[2:24:24] Oh, you're bound to lose.
[2:24:31] Because I come
[2:24:33] to tell you, Satan,
[2:24:36] you can't cross.
[2:24:38] Hallelujah.
[2:24:41] Because
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; because I'm covered by his blood.
[2:24:48] Oh, and you may stare and you may fight,
[2:24:53] but you're going to lose this battle
[2:24:56] tonight. Cause remember,
[2:25:00] you can't cross the bloodline. Sing that
[2:25:04] first verse.
[2:25:06] Now, even though my spirit
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; my spirit's low and it seems I can't
[2:25:14] hardly go, but still
[2:25:17] looking to the unseen
[2:25:20] I see victory.
[2:25:24] And many times I'm walking by faith
[2:25:29] and can't see what lies before me. But
[2:25:33] still,
[2:25:35] oh, I see victory. Aren't you glad for
[2:25:39] the eyes of faith? Oh,
[2:25:42] and I just got to tell you, Satan,
[2:25:47] you can't cross the bloodline. That's
[2:25:50] it. Just speak to him.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Because I'm
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're defeated.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; You've lost the battle.
[2:25:59] You have no authority.
[2:26:02] You're nothing but a blood.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; I'm covered.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; I'm shielded. I'm protected by the
[2:26:10] blood.
[2:26:12] You can't cross the bloodline.
[2:26:16] Oh,
[2:26:18] I just got to tell you, Satan,
[2:26:23] you can't cross the bloodline
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; because
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; because I'm covered by the blood.
[2:26:36] And you may stare and you may fight, but
[2:26:40] you're going to lose this battle
[2:26:43] tonight. Remember,
[2:26:47] you can't cross the bloodline. Sing the
[2:26:51] last lines. Oh, remember
[2:26:56] you can't cross the bloodline.
[2:27:03] Thank
[2:27:04] you, Lord,
[2:27:08] for saving
[2:27:11] my soul.
[2:27:15] Thank
[2:27:17] you, Lord,
[2:27:20] for making
[2:27:24] me whole.
[2:27:26] I've been loosed.
[2:27:30] Loosed by the blood.
[2:27:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:27:40] thy great salvation,
[2:27:45] so rich
[2:27:48] and God bless you as our prayers.
[2:27:51] They're playing softly.
[2:27:54] We want to
[2:27:56] keep the different ones that are sick
[2:28:00] in our prayer and that God will just
[2:28:04] bring them through victory. And I
[2:28:06] believe that he will do that and is
[2:28:08] doing that.
[2:28:10] Believing for great victory for Sister
[2:28:13] Kim,
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; Sister Martha,
[2:28:17] Sister Rhonda,
[2:28:19] and u just hearing the testimony of what
[2:28:24] this um Chris, I guess, your cousin,
[2:28:28] what God is doing for him. And I don't
[2:28:32] know if he's a Christian or not, but if
[2:28:34] he's not, then we can see that God is
[2:28:38] showing mercy
[2:28:41] and God raising him up as a testimony.
[2:28:44] And you know, he was on five different
[2:28:46] life supports. I thought there was only
[2:28:49] one life support, but he's on five
[2:28:52] different life supports.
[2:28:55] they've given him up
[2:28:57] and then turn around and he wakes up
[2:29:01] wanting something or talking or whatever
[2:29:05] and wanting to get up and
[2:29:09] that just shows how powerful God is.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; And we love you, appreciate you, and and
[2:29:16] believing for a great year in the Lord
[2:29:19] this year.
[2:29:20] I'm believing for his coming for a body
[2:29:24] change and
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just looking forward to that time.
[2:29:29] So, may you have a wonderful day today
[2:29:32] and uh is there any announcements or
[2:29:35] anything there? No announcements. Let's
[2:29:38] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[2:29:41] prayer and um maybe brother Mark, do you
[2:29:45] want to dismiss?
