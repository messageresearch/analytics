[39:04] them in our prayer as they make their
[39:07] way back uh home and also um uh most of

[39:26] get I think from what I've heard and um
[39:30] um they weren't able to to keep him
[39:34] bring him back around and and so um um
[39:39] from what I've known of him and um had
[39:43] met him a few times just a really nice
[39:45] brother and I love the Lord and um you
[39:50] know it's it's it is a comfort to know
[39:53] that you know uh he he knew the Lord and
[39:57] was ready to cross over but it's
[39:59] still um you can never prepare I guess
[40:03] um for the death of a loved one and and
[40:06] uh so I know um and he was just a a
[40:09] young man uh fairly young man I guess
[40:12] and um and so uh we want to keep him uh
[40:16] keep the family sister Tanya in our
[40:18] prayer the Lord will just to help her
[40:22] and also we had made mention of the um
[40:26] the sister I can't remember her name
[40:28] right away but um uh but she had lost

[40:40] don't know but um uh he was killed and a
[40:44] logging a logging truck hit him and only
[40:49] maybe 18 17 something like that 19 what
[40:54] was he he was 15 he was 15
[40:56] okay so 15 years old and uh so that
[41:00] that's got to be devastating as well to
[41:02] to the mother and I'm sure father as
[41:06] well so we want to keep them in our
[41:08] prayer that the Lord will help them and
[41:12] uh tell you what there's many needs many

[45:00] and the church says amen amen and
[45:05] amen we want to look at Matthew the 20th
[45:09] uh
[45:10] chapter and
[45:12] um again we're going to
[45:15] start at the 20th
[45:19] verse says then came to him the mother
[45:22] of zebedee's children with her sons
[45:25] worshiping
[45:26] him and Desiring a certain thing of him
[45:30] and he said unto her What wilt
[45:33] thou and she said unto him grant that
[45:36] these my sons two sons May sit the one
[45:40] on thy right hand and the other on the
[45:42] left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered
[45:45] and said you know not what you ask are
[45:48] you able to drink of the cup that I am
[45:50] that I shall drink of and be baptized
[45:53] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[45:55] with they say unto him we are able and
[45:59] he saith unto him them you shall drink
[46:02] indeed of my cup and be baptized with
[46:05] the baptism that I am baptized with but
[46:07] to sit on my right hand and on my left
[46:09] is not mine to give but it shall be
[46:12] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[46:15] my father and when the 10 heard it they
[46:18] were moved with indignation against the
[46:20] two Brethren but Jesus called them unto
[46:24] him and said you know that the princes
[46:26] of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
[46:29] them but and they that are great
[46:32] exercise Authority upon them but it
[46:36] shall not be so among you but whosoever
[46:39] will be great among you let him be your
[46:42] minister and whosoever shall be Chief
[46:45] among you let him be your servant even
[46:47] as the son of man came not to be
[46:49] ministered unto but to minister and to
[46:52] give his life for a ransom for many amen
[46:55] amen then if you'll go back uh to
[46:58] Philippians the 2
[47:03] chapter Philippians the 2
[47:08] chapter
[47:10] and going to start at the fifth
[47:14] verse actually we're going to just start
[47:16] at the first verse if there be any
[47:20] therefore any consolation in Christ if
[47:23] any comfort of love if any Fellowship of
[47:26] the spirit if any bowels and mercies
[47:29] fulfill you my joy that you be like
[47:31] minded having the same
[47:34] love being of one Accord and of one mind
[47:37] let nothing be done through Strife or
[47:39] vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let
[47:43] each esteem other better than
[47:46] themselves look not every man on his own
[47:49] things but every man also on the things
[47:51] of
[47:52] others and let this mind be in you which
[47:55] which was also in Christ Jesus who being
[47:57] in the form of God thought it not
[47:59] robbery to be equal with
[48:01] God but made himself of no reputation
[48:04] and took upon him the form of a servant
[48:06] and was made in the likeness of men and
[48:09] being found in fashion as a man he
[48:11] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[48:14] death even the death of the Cross amen
[48:18] you can have your seats this morning and
[48:22] uh before we I just want to say that
[48:25] we're going to uh have communion next
[48:28] Sunday the Lord willing and uh so we
[48:32] look forward to that and also
[48:36] um uh there's just going to be one
[48:38] service today and um and so just
[48:42] remember that uh as well but here
[48:47] uh I guess I want to continue with the
[48:51] thought the son of man came to
[48:53] minister and um
[48:58] there there's much power in in
[49:03] ministering uh
[49:06] and the word Minister uh as we have
[49:10] stated it means to wait upon others to
[49:13] serve the need of others to supply what
[49:16] is needed to care for so to minister is
[49:20] to wait upon others to serve the need of
[49:22] others to supply what is needed
[49:26] and to care
[49:28] for I think that's what um God has
[49:34] called us to do is to to be
[49:37] ministers and uh in whatever fashion
[49:41] whatever God has called us to do in
[49:45] life uh we
[49:47] are there uh not to have just an
[49:51] occupation but we are there to
[49:54] minister and um Jesus came to minister
[49:59] to those that were in need uh Luke 19
[50:02] and10 and if you notice the type of
[50:05] ministry that he
[50:07] had he said the son of man is come to
[50:10] seek and to save to seek and to save
[50:14] that which was
[50:15] lost amen we know his his ministry he
[50:19] healed the sick he cast out Devils he
[50:23] healed the Brokenhearted he preached the
[50:26] gospel to the poor he set at Liberty
[50:29] them that were bruised he preached
[50:32] Deliverance to the
[50:34] captive that was part of his ministry it
[50:38] was to care it was to help the Lord
[50:41] everybody's got their idea of what help
[50:44] means and what their idea of what
[50:47] Ministry is and but this was the
[50:50] ministry of Christ there were those that
[50:53] were bruised there were those that were
[50:55] brokenhearted and he come to help them
[50:58] he come to heal them the right way there
[51:01] was those that were Bound by the devil
[51:04] and such as Mary Magdalene that I think
[51:07] had seven demons in her and Jesus cast
[51:11] them all
[51:12] out and she was set free there was the
[51:16] man that had uh uh called Legion
[51:20] thousands of devils in him and yet when
[51:23] Jesus came by and and and Jesus went
[51:27] across the he went out of his way to go
[51:30] across the the the the sea
[51:33] there and Satan tried to drown him Satan
[51:37] caused the Tempest to come the storm the
[51:40] waves to rock the boat the boat was
[51:42] sinking and and the disciples thought
[51:45] they were going to perish but Jesus had
[51:48] a mission and that was to seek and save
[51:52] that which was lost and there was a man
[51:54] one man out of that whole country
[51:55] country of gilee that that was needing
[51:58] his help and Jesus went to deliver him
[52:03] there's something about that and and we
[52:05] have to say that love is the only thing
[52:08] that could produce a Ministry that he
[52:11] had it was divine love for we know that
[52:15] John told us that God so loved the world
[52:17] that he
[52:18] gave he gave his only begotten son now
[52:23] God must have had confidence in the in
[52:25] in his son God must have had confidence
[52:27] in that Ministry he was going to give
[52:29] him a Ministry that would that would
[52:32] redeem he would give him a Ministry that
[52:34] would save he'd give him a Ministry that
[52:36] would deliver it was a Ministry because
[52:39] God so loved the world and he gave his
[52:43] son and And that son would have a
[52:47] Ministry that would
[52:48] satisfy the love of
[52:51] God and and so in in then we find that
[52:56] that the the the the son people try to
[52:59] say well the he he was the second uh uh
[53:03] uh deity of the godhead and and these
[53:06] things but we find out that that's not
[53:08] true amen we know that to be a false and
[53:12] before I forget it's good to have
[53:13] brother Bob here with us I didn't see
[53:16] him amen and Sister Janice as well and
[53:21] uh We've certainly uh uh I am you know
[53:25] uh even a small church we uh I I forget
[53:28] people sometimes but uh sure good to
[53:31] have them and we sure love them and uh
[53:35] glad he's doing better praise the Lord
[53:38] amen so he he so here's the Bible uh
[53:44] Paul in 2 Corinthians
[53:46] 5:19 says God was in Christ reconciling
[53:50] the world unto
[53:51] himself the Lord I think that's profound
[53:54] is that God not only sent his son but he
[53:58] came with his son he came to live in his
[54:02] son to do the work so God took on the
[54:06] form of a man God being Spirit became
[54:10] flesh and
[54:11] Bone and and but then he left he took
[54:15] aside he laid aside his royalty he laid
[54:19] aside amen uh uh his
[54:22] kingdom and didn't lay aside his power
[54:26] didn't change the fact of who he was
[54:29] he's
[54:30] God and you cannot separate the
[54:33] supernatural from God you cannot
[54:35] separate deity from God you can't
[54:37] separate the characteristics of God from
[54:40] God God is a person he cannot be changed
[54:44] in any way he's not a myth he's a person
[54:47] with the personality and what God is he
[54:49] will ever
[54:51] be and no matter what form he comes in
[54:54] he's still God God and so it was God in
[54:57] Christ reconciling the world unto
[55:00] himself he did not leave it to Angels
[55:03] God was the only one that could satisfy
[55:07] the love that he had God was the only
[55:10] one that could have the remedy and take
[55:13] care of the of of what was needed and so
[55:17] he took on the form of man and and and 2
[55:20] Corinthians 88:9 though he was rich yet
[55:24] for your sakes and notice how God would
[55:28] do it such love such love that he had
[55:31] for us that he would he would become
[55:34] poor for our sake for that's what the
[55:37] Bible says though he was rich yet for
[55:39] your sakes he became poor that you
[55:42] through his poverty might be made rich
[55:46] ain't that right so brother Bram says he
[55:49] never become kin folk altogether to the
[55:51] rich and to the mighty but he was born
[55:55] in the stable wrapped in swaddling cloth
[55:59] not to the adult but to the child he was
[56:02] God over the creation he chose not he
[56:05] chose to do it see not come a full
[56:09] matured man he came that he might suffer
[56:12] the feelings of the little babies now
[56:15] that's just the the the god that we
[56:17] serve ain't that right so when your
[56:20] little babies are sick and and thinking
[56:22] of uh brother Junior and sister
[56:25] uh Brooks um little one there in the
[56:28] hospital uh a couple weeks ago and and
[56:32] and uh not not feeling good and and all
[56:35] of our babies I guess go through things
[56:37] and things and Satan just he just a
[56:39] meano you know that that attack the
[56:42] innocent but God would come and he
[56:44] wouldn't bypass the little little ones
[56:47] but he would come to be born in a manger
[56:49] in a little as a baby God cried God uh
[56:54] God why you know God had to be taken
[56:57] care of Amen in in a body ain't that
[57:00] right but he done that see um uh uh come
[57:04] not as a full matured man but he came
[57:07] that he might suffer the feelings know
[57:10] the feelings know what they are
[57:12] suffering of the little babies he came
[57:15] that he might go through the teenage
[57:18] Temptations might go that he could toll
[57:21] the tolls and snares of the devil as a
[57:24] man and make a way for people of all
[57:27] ages of all ages and of all classes see
[57:31] the poor the rich they all he became
[57:35] poor that through his poverty we might
[57:38] become rich and HS with him in the
[57:41] Kingdom so all of this was not done in
[57:44] vain it was his plan Amen to feel to
[57:49] know what every person in every of their
[57:52] ages and every class class of people
[57:56] that they might know what or he might
[57:58] know what they went through and through
[58:00] his suffering and him knowing what we go
[58:03] through he could save us cuz he could
[58:06] identify with us when we pray as a
[58:10] little child and say God I need help I'm
[58:12] I'm being tempted by this I'm I'm
[58:15] needing help in school I'm needing help
[58:17] he knows what you're saying he he
[58:21] understands because he's been there as
[58:23] well he was tempted as well as a
[58:27] teenager he knows what it was to have
[58:29] the diaper rash and he knows what it was
[58:32] to to have Gund what gtis or whatever or
[58:35] whatever babies have a lot you know and
[58:38] and these things he knows what it is so
[58:40] when a mother comes and begins to pray
[58:43] God touch my baby it it there moves him
[58:46] because he's I've been there I know how
[58:49] that is I know where that's at right
[58:52] amen see and and and when your teenage
[58:54] AG grows up and and parents amen when
[58:57] we're looking saying God I don't know
[58:59] what to do I'm struggling in these
[59:01] things and and and and all these he
[59:03] understands what we go through ain't
[59:05] that right so he's not one that looks
[59:08] and says well I don't know what you're
[59:09] saying man grow up you know what I mean
[59:11] just get over it no he knows he's been
[59:15] there he understands ain't that right
[59:18] amen see and so he's able to secure them
[59:22] amen see so he says now sign would be
[59:25] given Crossing himself God Crossing
[59:28] himself making him something different
[59:31] than what he was now that's a super sign
[59:34] crying as a baby playing as a boy
[59:37] toiling as a man but it was God living
[59:40] in all stages of life just like we do
[59:45] ain't that right see so but everything
[59:48] that Jesus did amen uh of course again
[59:51] he was the body of God the Tabernacle of
[59:54] God but everything that he done he done
[59:56] it willingly he he willingly done it
[1:00:00] amen he laid down his life willingly he
[1:00:04] willingly Sanctified himself and
[1:00:06] everything that he done was for for us
[1:00:11] amen and and you you know it's um I I
[1:00:15] understand that Satan job is to separate
[1:00:19] us and from maybe not really separate us
[1:00:23] from church and separate us from the the
[1:00:26] the the religious things or whatever but
[1:00:29] one thing he tries to do is separate us
[1:00:31] from the love of God to where we we feel
[1:00:35] that God never doesn't love us and that
[1:00:38] God doesn't care for us and but if if if
[1:00:42] there's ever a time of just of walking
[1:00:45] with the Lord we should know that God
[1:00:47] truly loves us and I know and and and
[1:00:50] and I mean I know not all the time are
[1:00:53] we going to feel that that he loves us
[1:00:55] because we don't go by feelings we have
[1:00:57] to walk by faith but there should be
[1:01:00] even when we come to an altar and gave
[1:01:02] our hearts to the Lord there should be
[1:01:04] such a connection of God's love to us
[1:01:08] that that we would know that it's an
[1:01:10] eternal love that no matter what comes
[1:01:13] what goes you know even when we don't
[1:01:16] feel that love we know that his love is
[1:01:19] toward us because we know what he's done
[1:01:21] for us amen but there's a love that with
[1:01:24] you know well Paul says I'm persuaded
[1:01:26] that nothing shall separate us from the
[1:01:28] love of God Amen see and so uh but but
[1:01:32] he Sanctified himself he done all of
[1:01:34] this because of love and it was it was
[1:01:37] willingly brother Bram said he had a
[1:01:40] right to a home he was a man he had a
[1:01:42] right to be married he was a man he had
[1:01:43] a right to good clothes he was a man but
[1:01:46] he Sanctified himself he forfeited see
[1:01:50] and and he could have he could have come
[1:01:52] down the corridors of Glory a full full
[1:01:54] statured man with an Angelic band sure
[1:01:57] but he Sanctified himself he could have
[1:02:00] at least been born in a nice clean bed
[1:02:02] somewhere but he was born in a manger
[1:02:04] over a manure Pile in a borrowed manger
[1:02:08] and and yet Jesus says for their sake I
[1:02:11] sanctify myself everything was done for
[1:02:14] you and I can you say amen amen as we
[1:02:17] said the last Service uh Sunday uh he
[1:02:20] endured the suffering and despised or
[1:02:23] ignored
[1:02:25] the the shame amen and and you know so
[1:02:29] so then you think well how could he do
[1:02:31] it all
[1:02:32] willingly H how could he freely do this
[1:02:35] well the prophet said the simple answer
[1:02:38] is he was a lamb amen lamb forfeits lamb
[1:02:42] is a sacrificial animal amen and so uh
[1:02:46] he was a lamb he had the nature of a
[1:02:48] lamb he took upon that nature amen not
[1:02:51] to fight not to not to to uh begrudge or
[1:02:56] not to uh defend a man but he he stood
[1:03:00] there helpless he stood there and it was
[1:03:02] all in a willing uh uh uh with a willing
[1:03:06] heart so so the prophet said he lived
[1:03:09] and had eternal life because he did not
[1:03:12] live for himself if he had a if he had a
[1:03:15] wolf nature then he would have lived for
[1:03:17] himself if he had a wild nature he would
[1:03:20] have lived for himself if he had that
[1:03:21] old carnal adamic nature and and but he
[1:03:24] had a lamb nature and therefore he did
[1:03:28] not live for himself he lived for others
[1:03:31] and but notice he didn't just live that
[1:03:34] way but brother brandom said he set the
[1:03:38] example he become the example of
[1:03:41] everyone that would follow after him he
[1:03:44] become the example amen that we would
[1:03:47] look to amen not to say well Jesus done
[1:03:50] that that was him because he was God no
[1:03:52] he set the example he set the plum line
[1:03:55] for every Christian boy girl man woman
[1:04:00] amen he set the example and brother
[1:04:02] Brandon says now see Jesus was training
[1:04:06] some men that was going to take the
[1:04:09] gospel to all the world ain't that right
[1:04:12] Jesus died he was buried he was
[1:04:15] resurrected amen but he didn't just
[1:04:18] leave it at that amen he didn't just
[1:04:20] leave it to where we all just take out
[1:04:22] talk about history and take everybody on
[1:04:25] a history lesson amen but now he would
[1:04:28] take that church amen and and began to
[1:04:32] spread the gospel the good news amen not
[1:04:35] that we would have to die not that we
[1:04:37] would have to go to the Cross amen for
[1:04:39] the world he already done that but now
[1:04:42] he takes us and he spreads the gospel
[1:04:46] out of the good news ain't that right so
[1:04:49] he was training some men so he lived a
[1:04:52] Sanctified life and and forfeited every
[1:04:55] worldly pleasure for their sake he going
[1:04:58] to show them how to act he's going to
[1:05:01] show them how to conduct themselves is
[1:05:03] going to show them not say well I'm
[1:05:05] going to give you the gospel now you go
[1:05:07] out amen and then they don't know how to
[1:05:10] act they don't know how to live they're
[1:05:11] going to live any old way any old thing
[1:05:13] and God not going to bless that God's
[1:05:15] not going to bless their Ministry
[1:05:17] they're not going to be effective in any
[1:05:18] way that now God will but but Jesus says
[1:05:22] he done it for their sake that they when
[1:05:24] he would leave they would know what they
[1:05:27] were supposed to do because now they've
[1:05:29] got an example amen see so he says see
[1:05:32] now he he forfeited every worldly
[1:05:35] pleasure for their sake we ought to
[1:05:37] Forfeit our worldly dressing our worldly
[1:05:40] pleasures and things like that for the
[1:05:42] sake of the people we're trying to lead
[1:05:44] to God see the outside world he says see
[1:05:48] so so why do we do these things why why
[1:05:51] do we conduct ourselves in in a right
[1:05:53] way way why why are we careful with what
[1:05:56] we say how we act and and these things
[1:05:59] are how we should I know it's easy to
[1:06:01] let our guards down and and these things
[1:06:03] but but we got to remember whether we're
[1:06:06] on the mountain top or whether we're not
[1:06:08] on the mountain top whether we feel that
[1:06:10] God loves us or we feel that he hates us
[1:06:13] whether we feel we're going in in a
[1:06:15] Rapture or whether we feel we're going
[1:06:17] to hell it does not matter whether it's
[1:06:20] sunny or rainy whether it's whether it's
[1:06:22] good days bad days it does not matter
[1:06:26] God help us all Amen to realize that
[1:06:30] that none of this will affect us Jesus
[1:06:32] had rainy days too Jesus had bad days
[1:06:35] too Jesus had his headaches and Jesus
[1:06:38] had suffering Jesus felt loneliness and
[1:06:40] rejected Jesus was anointed and felt
[1:06:43] great and people OED and old and and and
[1:06:46] and he had all kinds of they but he
[1:06:48] never failed on the mission he never
[1:06:51] amen done things amen and said well
[1:06:53] forgive get them I don't care I don't I
[1:06:56] I'm just going to do my own thing it
[1:06:59] wasn't you see he set the example can
[1:07:01] you say amen he set the example so we
[1:07:05] ought to Forfeit our worldly dressing
[1:07:07] our worldly pleasures and things like
[1:07:09] that for the sake of the
[1:07:11] people for the sake of the people that
[1:07:14] we're trying to lead to God which the
[1:07:17] outside world can you say Amen nothing
[1:07:21] of what Jesus did was for his own
[1:07:23] benefit that's right he gave he gave and
[1:07:28] he gave ain't that right he
[1:07:32] gave
[1:07:34] and the theme scripture of brother
[1:07:37] branham's Ministry was he's the same
[1:07:39] yesterday today and forever praise the
[1:07:42] Lord he's still giving and giving and
[1:07:45] giving amen why because he still loves
[1:07:50] he still cares amen he's still trying
[1:07:54] can you say Amen doing all that he so we
[1:07:57] we find that this this means that his
[1:08:01] ministry is still the same Matthew
[1:08:05] 937 then saith he unto his disciples the
[1:08:08] har Harvest truly is plous but the
[1:08:10] laborers are few pray ye therefore the
[1:08:13] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[1:08:15] forth laborers into his Harvest so this
[1:08:18] is the desire this was his goal is not
[1:08:22] just to redeem but also to to through
[1:08:25] that Redemption bring forth
[1:08:28] laborers bring forth laborers ain't that
[1:08:31] right amen but it had to take a
[1:08:33] Redemption first amen he ain't going to
[1:08:35] just send out just carnal born sin man
[1:08:39] you know uh uh with carnal Natures wild
[1:08:43] and doing their own thing and making
[1:08:44] them laborers for his kingdom it ain't
[1:08:47] going to happen because because man is
[1:08:49] so selfish he's so in self-indulgent
[1:08:52] he's so about him himself making a name
[1:08:55] for himself establishing his own kingdom
[1:08:58] how can he bring forth labors from that
[1:09:01] right it would take a Redemption first
[1:09:04] ain't that right so how would he send
[1:09:07] them uh uh John uh 2021 Jesus said as my
[1:09:11] father has sent me so even send I you so
[1:09:15] the father came down from heaven Amen in
[1:09:18] and and changed himself amen into a form
[1:09:22] of Flesh because he dwelt in Christ
[1:09:24] ain't that right it was God in Christ
[1:09:27] and what God was in Christ he is in his
[1:09:31] church amen the same way that the father
[1:09:35] sent him is the same way he sends us
[1:09:38] that's right and it's Christ in you the
[1:09:40] hope of glory ain't that right Christ in
[1:09:43] you the hope of glory so the prophet
[1:09:46] said see here he is uh uh he is here
[1:09:49] today in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:52] doing the same thing in his church that
[1:09:55] he did when he was here to carry on the
[1:09:58] work until the last enemy is put under
[1:10:02] his feet ain't that right Till the Last
[1:10:06] Enemy is put under his feet in another
[1:10:08] place what he was in the days of
[1:10:10] yesterday living in a body Jesus he will
[1:10:13] do the same today in his church because
[1:10:16] that's his program is to carry on with
[1:10:20] his church he could have just stayed in
[1:10:23] that body amen he could have lived in
[1:10:25] the body of Jesus Christ on Earth amen
[1:10:28] for all these years if he wanted to but
[1:10:30] that wasn't his goal that wasn't his
[1:10:32] purpose it was to raise up a church that
[1:10:36] he could carry on through them his
[1:10:40] ministry now the then then the church
[1:10:43] then has the same Eternal qualities the
[1:10:46] Lord the same Eternal attributes that
[1:10:48] Christ had brother Bram said man cannot
[1:10:51] do nothing see uh it's God in man
[1:10:55] everybody say it's God in man see Jesus
[1:10:58] said I'm the vine you are the branch now
[1:11:00] as long as a branch is in the vine it'll
[1:11:02] bear the fruit of the vine now God
[1:11:05] always used men for his agent always
[1:11:08] that's why he used his own son to unveil
[1:11:10] himself he come down and took on the
[1:11:12] form of man in order to Die the death
[1:11:15] for man he could not die in the spirit
[1:11:17] but he was put to Death In the Flesh
[1:11:20] then God was in Abraham God was in Isaac
[1:11:22] God was in Jacob God was in Joseph God
[1:11:24] was in David he was in all those people
[1:11:27] back there them prophets and so forth it
[1:11:29] was God working through men now in this
[1:11:32] new testament age the blood of Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ cleanses his church sanctifies it
[1:11:37] that his holy spirit might continue to
[1:11:40] carry the work of God on through all
[1:11:42] ages and he's just the same today do you
[1:11:47] believe
[1:11:48] that why is it important that God has a
[1:11:51] church today
[1:11:54] that he could work through you know
[1:11:56] we're living in in a in a crucial time
[1:11:59] for the world for man time
[1:12:03] civilization we're not just at the end
[1:12:05] of an age we're at the end of time we're
[1:12:07] at the end of all World
[1:12:10] Order and
[1:12:13] so we see how desperate the situation is
[1:12:17] I at least I would think so uh
[1:12:20] especially being in the message of the
[1:12:21] hour you could have just imagine imagine
[1:12:23] how blessed we are yes sir uh to have a
[1:12:27] prophet and and what he sent
[1:12:30] us it's it's to let us know the time
[1:12:33] that we're at I I think of the elections
[1:12:35] that are going on and and how many
[1:12:38] churches how many Christian
[1:12:40] so-called uh people are so wrapped up in
[1:12:43] the politics of today that they really I
[1:12:46] mean they're prophesying all kinds of
[1:12:49] good for America and and and you know uh
[1:12:53] all rooting for Trump and and you know
[1:12:58] uh uh whether he gets in or not that's
[1:13:00] whatever you know and uh there but but I
[1:13:04] will tell you it ain't going to get any
[1:13:06] better not not for the believer it's
[1:13:08] it's just it's just the
[1:13:10] facts and um you can take that whatever
[1:13:15] you want to do but I say you could take
[1:13:16] it to the bank about it because and and
[1:13:20] the reason why is because God already
[1:13:22] sent us a prophet ET to let us know that
[1:13:25] no matter what you do this it's she's
[1:13:27] gone America's gone she'll never come
[1:13:30] back she'll never rise it's only going
[1:13:32] to get more evil more uh the Bible says
[1:13:35] when they call peace peace uh then cry
[1:13:38] out for peace peace sudden destruction's
[1:13:40] coming never has it been for people men
[1:13:43] calling for peace as it is today but but
[1:13:46] but you would expect the the The Sinner
[1:13:48] out there but then to see the churches
[1:13:51] all ring around praying and prophesy
[1:13:53] sign and glory to God more is coming and
[1:13:55] Revival and it's they've got hopes they
[1:13:58] got Great Hopes for the future of
[1:14:00] America and of the world um but but if
[1:14:05] you're really a believer in the message
[1:14:07] of the hour you know you know good and
[1:14:10] well God's Wrath is being poured out
[1:14:13] that's right it it isn't it it isn't
[1:14:16] because of a democrat or republican or
[1:14:19] non that is causing the world the way it
[1:14:21] is it's l the grace of God is being
[1:14:25] lifted off of off of the world and and
[1:14:28] this generation Believe It or Not
[1:14:30] brother Bram even talked about it in in
[1:14:32] the you ought to go listen to it the
[1:14:34] souls in prison now and he talks about
[1:14:37] how that we'd be preaching to the total
[1:14:40] lost now I think there's a mixture in
[1:14:43] that uh that that it that it doesn't
[1:14:46] mean that God can't save uh but because
[1:14:49] I believe that there maybe one or two
[1:14:51] left I don't know I don't know
[1:14:53] but
[1:15:01] I it was in Wesley and and all that
[1:15:04] where people just flocking and just
[1:15:06] coming we're not in that age but but
[1:15:09] we're in an age where um well you ought
[1:15:12] to just go listen to it the the the
[1:15:14] souls that are in prison now and what
[1:15:17] brother Brandon talked about but so so
[1:15:20] then then that should make us so
[1:15:21] burdened not not not despiteful not
[1:15:25] saying well that old wretched sinner
[1:15:26] he's gone anyhow I don't I don't believe
[1:15:30] that I I I believe because because
[1:15:33] brother brandham says that that just as
[1:15:35] Abraham and he took Abraham for example
[1:15:39] that here was lot lot lot was not called
[1:15:42] to be part of Abraham Abraham is the one
[1:15:45] that took lot not not God uh uh when
[1:15:48] when God gave the promises lot was not
[1:15:50] included in the promises it was to
[1:15:52] Abraham
[1:15:54] everything about lot coming out and
[1:15:56] coming in or whatever it was all to do
[1:15:58] with Abraham not God and and God
[1:16:01] Abraham's the one that said hey you want
[1:16:02] to come along with me we're trying but
[1:16:04] lot never saw the vision lot never had a
[1:16:07] passion for the promis like like Abraham
[1:16:09] had because it wasn't given to him so
[1:16:11] then it causes conflict remember there
[1:16:13] was such conflict among among uh the men
[1:16:16] and and these things that God told
[1:16:18] Abraham separate you got to separate man
[1:16:21] and and so uh uh and
[1:16:38] actually brother Braham saying this is
[1:16:40] what a Christian does he gives lot the
[1:16:43] First Choice he said you take First
[1:16:45] Choice look it all over I'll take what's
[1:16:48] left and lot because he did not have the
[1:16:52] insight and he was just the carnal
[1:16:54] believer and all that he looked at the
[1:16:56] plains of Sodom and Gomorrah and the
[1:16:59] luxury and the the the wealth and and
[1:17:01] the nice and all the Comforts and all of
[1:17:03] that right and he chose that how many
[1:17:06] carnal believers do the same thing today
[1:17:09] they would choose that over the promises
[1:17:11] of God they they're looking for that's
[1:17:13] why they're so wrapped up in Trump
[1:17:15] that's why they're so wrapped up in
[1:17:16] politics is they're looking for Comfort
[1:17:19] when God's got a comfort God's Abraham
[1:17:22] was looking to the pro prises he didn't
[1:17:24] need Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't need
[1:17:26] the wealth of men remember even when the
[1:17:29] Kings come and and was going to give him
[1:17:31] things and and bless him and enrich him
[1:17:34] and he said I don't want nothing to do
[1:17:37] with you unless you say I have made
[1:17:39] Abraham Rich can you say
[1:17:41] Amen God's the one that blesses us ain't
[1:17:45] that right and and so um U but but here
[1:17:49] lot went out there he made that mistake
[1:17:51] and then then Here Comes God telling
[1:17:54] Abraham what he's going to do I'm going
[1:17:57] to destroy this this Sodom and gomorah
[1:18:00] and and their sins have come up and and
[1:18:02] it's just horrible and I'm going to wipe
[1:18:04] that thing away I'm going to destroy
[1:18:06] them people and what does Abraham do he
[1:18:10] starts pleading to God he starts
[1:18:14] interceding for God not one time he kept
[1:18:17] on interceding if there be 50 well there
[1:18:19] wasn't 50 I think or or whatever he said
[1:18:22] and and and so there he there wasn't 50
[1:18:25] and he didn't walk away say well forget
[1:18:26] it I tried at least I gave it a shot no
[1:18:29] he stood there and says 40 then there
[1:18:33] wasn't even 40 there
[1:18:35] 30 God you got to save them somehow I
[1:18:39] think he even got down to 10 right and
[1:18:42] so God because of Abraham's
[1:18:46] pleading because of Abraham interceding
[1:18:50] because of Abraham stopping God
[1:18:53] and and Abraham was a friend of God and
[1:18:56] God was looking at Abraham's heart it
[1:18:58] was bleeding for for for lot and God
[1:19:02] could identify because I really believe
[1:19:04] it was the spirit of God in
[1:19:07] Abraham and
[1:19:09] Abraham interceding for lot so God sends
[1:19:13] the two angels does what he does you
[1:19:15] know blinds the ever everybody and takes
[1:19:18] takes three people out lot and his two
[1:19:21] daughters because the the wife she
[1:19:24] didn't overcome she just turned around
[1:19:25] and turned to a pillar of salt but what
[1:19:29] did a lot say please I've man I've made
[1:19:32] my mistakes I've I've done a lot of bad
[1:19:35] here and I've made some bad choices just
[1:19:37] take me to Abraham no didn't go there
[1:19:40] either did he he goes somewhere else and
[1:19:44] then he gets in captivity right and here
[1:19:47] comes ol lot or Abraham gets his he gets
[1:19:51] his men they weren't even trained
[1:19:52] soldiers but he gets them because for
[1:19:54] lot's sake I got to go after lot so
[1:19:57] brother Braham says that's what the real
[1:19:59] believer does is they go to the end of
[1:20:02] the road for the
[1:20:04] Lost can you say Amen they're going to
[1:20:07] go to the end of the road for the lost
[1:20:09] and I believe that's where we're at
[1:20:11] today so why is it important see we're
[1:20:15] we're living in this time God's Wrath is
[1:20:18] being poured out if if you really
[1:20:19] believe the message you you know you
[1:20:22] know that no one's going to fix this
[1:20:24] thing oh yes they're going to join you
[1:20:27] know uh Confederation of churches join
[1:20:30] with the the Catholic church and it
[1:20:33] looks all promising but it's not
[1:20:35] promising and people are getting wrapped
[1:20:38] up in that thing but they're sealing
[1:20:40] their Doom they're accepting the mark of
[1:20:42] the
[1:20:42] beast can you say
[1:20:44] amen and and it's it's it's it's a such
[1:20:48] a deceptive time and and and people are
[1:20:52] getting caught up in the Trap
[1:20:56] hello and so we look at you know I was
[1:20:59] listening to the message presuming uh
[1:21:02] Friday as we was traveling down the road
[1:21:05] and and um you know uh just to hear
[1:21:10] Brother Braham talking about these
[1:21:11] things and and how that billions of
[1:21:14] people are just presuming and we all
[1:21:16] know what presuming means it means to
[1:21:18] Adventure without
[1:21:19] Authority Adventure without Authority
[1:21:22] and
[1:21:23] and and he talks about the Ministers of
[1:21:25] great denominations Across the Nation
[1:21:27] who are preaching doctrine of their
[1:21:30] denominations and and which is
[1:21:32] absolutely against the word of God and
[1:21:34] they
[1:21:36] presume that they're right many many are
[1:21:39] behind the pulpits today presuming that
[1:21:42] what they're preaching is Right
[1:21:44] presuming that what it is it's the truth
[1:21:47] can you say Amen see because the prophet
[1:21:49] said they presume that God requires a
[1:21:52] certain Creed or an affiliation they are
[1:21:56] presuming that they are taking the
[1:21:58] people to Heaven getting them closer to
[1:22:01] God uh uh by preaching their ideologies
[1:22:05] and their uh doctors of divinities and
[1:22:09] and preaching the Creed and and telling
[1:22:12] the people join a church become one of
[1:22:14] us and identify with us you see and they
[1:22:18] presume Aventure without Authority they
[1:22:21] presume that that they're okay and
[1:22:23] that's all that man has to do to go to
[1:22:25] heaven hello see and yet they have no
[1:22:29] scriptural authority to base this upon
[1:22:34] they're just presuming ain't that right
[1:22:37] but they believe it anyways you know and
[1:22:40] and and the the prophet said you know
[1:22:41] the Bible has has only one Creed he said
[1:22:45] there's only one Creed and that's the
[1:22:47] Bible and that's Christ can you say Amen
[1:22:49] see so you only have to know him and to
[1:22:52] know know him is is life and there's no
[1:22:56] way that a man can find life outside of
[1:23:00] that can you say Amen so we we
[1:23:04] understand this by the message of the
[1:23:06] hour we understand that and the way to
[1:23:08] know Christ is by having a personal
[1:23:11] experience with with him not by joining
[1:23:15] a church or reciting a Creed ain't that
[1:23:18] right brother Bram said the human soul
[1:23:20] cries out for something it knows that
[1:23:23] there's something that brought it here
[1:23:25] it knows that there's something Beyond
[1:23:27] here that Soul knows that they don't
[1:23:31] know the way they don't know how to get
[1:23:34] there you understand see and so they
[1:23:37] know that they come from out of the
[1:23:39] night and they go back into the night
[1:23:41] see and they know they want to know
[1:23:44] where they come from and where they're
[1:23:45] going and if that hunger is in there
[1:23:48] then you can never get it by blighting
[1:23:51] your mind see
[1:23:53] uh uh there see and so because men have
[1:23:57] taught Creeds and based their learning
[1:23:59] of the Bible and of God on such shallow
[1:24:04] things as that joining a church shaking
[1:24:06] a preacher's hand you know just the uh
[1:24:09] the the the things that they do then uh
[1:24:13] uh they they just presume that it's fine
[1:24:16] you know we look at the holidays of
[1:24:18] America well the world I guess um but uh
[1:24:22] you know Easter New
[1:24:25] Year's Christmas and we look at what
[1:24:28] people have made them all out to be they
[1:24:31] made it to be totally different than
[1:24:33] what God you know than than really what
[1:24:36] it should be but New Year's for example
[1:24:39] they have their drinking parties and
[1:24:41] making their New Year's resolutions and
[1:24:44] and and all these things as though that
[1:24:47] it's it's the way to do it it's it's the
[1:24:49] way to to live life it's the it's the
[1:24:52] way to face the future it's the way to
[1:24:55] you know and and they're presuming that
[1:24:57] they're okay but they're not okay then
[1:24:59] then you've got looking at the Christmas
[1:25:01] you know and and how that Christmas has
[1:25:05] has been set aside for uh uh a day of
[1:25:10] Christ's birthday in commemoration and
[1:25:12] the world is set that day for December
[1:25:15] the 25th and we we know that that's not
[1:25:18] really the day and and uh but they they
[1:25:21] set day to celebrate his birthday and
[1:25:25] and yet brother brand said it shouldn't
[1:25:26] be a
[1:25:27] celebration uh uh as as we would
[1:25:30] celebrate uh Lincoln's birthday or any
[1:25:33] other man's birthday or or whatever see
[1:25:36] it should be a day of worship for God
[1:25:38] sending his son ain't that right but
[1:25:41] brother Bram would say now we don't know
[1:25:42] the actual day that Jesus was born so it
[1:25:44] really doesn't matter as to what day uh
[1:25:48] because you really we don't know these
[1:25:50] these things and he says I I suppose
[1:25:53] that he he uh doesn't he I don't suppose
[1:25:56] that he cares what day we set aside
[1:25:58] Because the actual day is lost you
[1:26:01] understand but one thing that he did
[1:26:03] about Christmas that he was against and
[1:26:05] and and what people have made it to be
[1:26:08] is the greatest commercial days it's one
[1:26:11] of the greatest commercial days of uh
[1:26:14] that man has made out of out of
[1:26:16] Christmas and he says it's all fixed
[1:26:18] upon passing presents one to another and
[1:26:21] having feeling hurt if we don't do it
[1:26:23] and pay them back and well they got me a
[1:26:26] present so I need to get them a present
[1:26:28] and well you know and then it starts
[1:26:30] climbing higher well they you know I I
[1:26:32] only got them a $25 present and they got
[1:26:34] me a $1,000 present oh no you know and
[1:26:36] then it becomes a rat race of of trying
[1:26:39] to top one another and be better and and
[1:26:41] all that and he said see it's just
[1:26:43] Twisted all up see and and and he then
[1:26:47] he talks of how they what kind of gifts
[1:26:49] they give he says you know we heard
[1:26:52] uh brother bramman and his wife heard a
[1:26:54] conversation between two girls and he
[1:26:56] says one of them said well what did you
[1:26:57] get your mother you know what did you
[1:26:59] get mother for Christmas oh dear I
[1:27:01] couldn't think of anything else to to
[1:27:03] get her but what she' enjoy uh more was
[1:27:07] a pack or a carton of cigarettes and so
[1:27:10] forth for mother see she said I got dad
[1:27:12] a qu of whiskey and you know and and she
[1:27:15] says well I'm glad you did that dear
[1:27:17] because I got him a new bunch of poker
[1:27:19] chips you see he said see that's
[1:27:21] Christmas the things that God is against
[1:27:24] the things that's going to take people
[1:27:26] to hell they're they're given these
[1:27:28] things as a gift for Christmas but it's
[1:27:30] supposed to be all about
[1:27:32] Christ you understand and and so he says
[1:27:35] how can the world stand much longer a
[1:27:38] celebration he said then I suppose they
[1:27:41] presume that that's the right way to do
[1:27:44] it see and he says that's what they're
[1:27:46] suppos they're supposing to do but
[1:27:49] they're just presuming that's okay can
[1:27:52] you say amen and and he says the reason
[1:27:55] that they're doing all of this the
[1:27:57] reason why they're they're they're
[1:27:58] they're living the way they are is
[1:28:01] because that's all they know the the
[1:28:04] reason why they got these nose rings and
[1:28:06] the studs in you know metal studs in
[1:28:08] their tongues and poking you know holes
[1:28:11] all in their ears and their nose and
[1:28:13] their belly buttons and wherever else
[1:28:16] you know it's it's that's all they know
[1:28:18] that that that's how shallow the church
[1:28:21] has brought
[1:28:23] things that's how they know see they got
[1:28:26] the purple hair green hair DED it's it's
[1:28:29] just all kinds of things but that's all
[1:28:32] they know you understand what I'm saying
[1:28:35] this generation that's all they know to
[1:28:38] do you think of it as I've said before
[1:28:41] give it give it time our my
[1:28:43] grandchildren or great grandchildren if
[1:28:45] God terries and time allows it all that
[1:28:49] they'll be thinking that homosexuals are
[1:28:51] normal transgender is a normal
[1:28:54] thing because most of the generation
[1:28:56] today thinks that women wearing pants is
[1:28:58] normal when it used to not be normal
[1:29:01] having earrings is normal when it used
[1:29:02] to not be normal wearing makeup is
[1:29:04] normal when it used to not be now we've
[1:29:06] gotten tattoos everywhere it used to not
[1:29:09] be in my day it used to not be normal
[1:29:11] for that I mean you'd find occasional
[1:29:14] but but not nothing like they're doing
[1:29:16] today it's becoming a norm a norm ain't
[1:29:20] that right somebody's got to stop this
[1:29:22] thing somebody and I know we ain't going
[1:29:24] to stop the world but somebody's got to
[1:29:26] tell a different
[1:29:28] story you understand what I'm saying so
[1:29:32] now brother brand said see if there's
[1:29:33] something that causes people to want to
[1:29:35] do something on that day whether it be
[1:29:38] Easter Christmas New Year's whatever
[1:29:40] there ought to be something
[1:29:43] real there ought to be something real to
[1:29:45] be done see see so so uh uh there is
[1:29:50] something somewhere that's the the right
[1:29:52] thing to do if that's the wrong thing to
[1:29:55] do see then there's got to be a right
[1:29:58] because there's got to be a right to
[1:30:00] every
[1:30:02] wrong ain't that right or it would be
[1:30:05] right see so there has to be a pro and
[1:30:08] con negative and positive ain't that
[1:30:12] right another place he said there has to
[1:30:14] be a real dollar that a bogus dollar is
[1:30:16] made off of or the bogus would be the
[1:30:19] real amen amen can you say amen and if
[1:30:24] we are the real then we not must not act
[1:30:27] like the
[1:30:29] bogus we don't want to be a bogus
[1:30:33] church we don't want to have a bogus
[1:30:35] religion we don't want to preach a bogus
[1:30:40] gospel amen live a bogus life can you
[1:30:45] say amen he said when we see denominate
[1:30:48] a denomination or a group of people
[1:30:50] that's hunging for something they go
[1:30:51] into the the church they join the church
[1:30:53] they show that there's something that
[1:30:56] they're hungering for that's they're
[1:30:58] hungering for it why because that human
[1:31:02] soul is hungering for something ain't
[1:31:05] that right hungering for something now
[1:31:09] you know why Russia is is communist
[1:31:12] today brother brandom lays it up on the
[1:31:15] church he said they had a Pentecostal
[1:31:18] move they had a Revival in that country
[1:31:22] but it was the church that let down the
[1:31:25] church that
[1:31:27] compromised and the people decided they
[1:31:29] don't want to be like the church they
[1:31:31] don't want nothing to do with the
[1:31:33] church and they put that to God and
[1:31:36] every till where they're now they're a
[1:31:37] communist country hello brother Bram
[1:31:41] lays it to the church for way America is
[1:31:48] today religion has been so misrepresent
[1:31:51] presented until the people have gotten
[1:31:53] off the true path that God
[1:31:56] requires and so brother Bram said see
[1:31:59] people believe that if they're brought
[1:32:00] into a certain condition or a certain
[1:32:02] place or to make a certain pledge or
[1:32:04] something like that that's all that God
[1:32:06] requires they make a religion about
[1:32:08] keeping a certain commandment or all the
[1:32:10] Ten Commandments doing a good deed
[1:32:12] giving the neighbor something give to
[1:32:14] the poor doing just doing doing being a
[1:32:17] good uh citizen get you know caring for
[1:32:21] the poor caring for this caring for that
[1:32:23] you know you become more like the Santa
[1:32:26] Claus of just giving everybody what they
[1:32:28] need and supplying and you're just
[1:32:30] exhausted and you just all this but but
[1:32:32] they make that a Rel that's their
[1:32:34] religion they make that all about
[1:32:36] religion surely God's going to accept me
[1:32:38] now I'm
[1:32:39] good ain't that right but see all of
[1:32:43] this is done under the presumption that
[1:32:45] they are meeting God's requirement his
[1:32:48] required standard and yet they're living
[1:32:51] in unbelief and in sin and and all these
[1:32:54] things and and and oh they might have an
[1:32:57] authority the church says they're doing
[1:32:58] okay so now they're living by the church
[1:33:00] Authority or they're living by the the
[1:33:03] the the the denomination Authority or
[1:33:06] even even the government Authority the
[1:33:08] government's now has you know passed
[1:33:10] that it's okay to smoke marijuana it's
[1:33:12] okay you know drinking as long as you
[1:33:14] know uh uh just don't drink and drrive
[1:33:16] but you can go out and drink and party
[1:33:17] and have a good time they they've
[1:33:19] allowed these things so in now we people
[1:33:22] are living under an government Authority
[1:33:25] you understand what I'm saying amen now
[1:33:27] they're trying to make us believe that
[1:33:29] that that transgender is is is is you
[1:33:33] know is okay and homosexuals and people
[1:33:36] can't help but being that way and and
[1:33:39] and so what they want us to come under
[1:33:41] an authority and it's their
[1:33:43] Authority government Authority well it's
[1:33:46] got to be okay because because you know
[1:33:48] so and so says it and and it's a law now
[1:33:51] and and all these things but the only
[1:33:53] true Authority is Bible Authority
[1:33:56] scripture
[1:33:57] Authority do you believe that see and
[1:34:00] and and and so and and and when that
[1:34:03] Authority comes there's no presuming
[1:34:05] whatsoever you're not adventuring
[1:34:08] without Authority you might have a
[1:34:10] government Authority but if you don't
[1:34:11] have Bible Authority you're only
[1:34:15] presuming that's right the truth the
[1:34:17] truth is the authority and Jesus said
[1:34:20] Thy word is truth Ain that right so this
[1:34:23] is where we as the Church of the Living
[1:34:25] God come in and play such an important
[1:34:28] role in this time because we become the
[1:34:32] truth as we become the
[1:34:36] word the Lord this is exactly what Jesus
[1:34:40] was he was the word made flesh amen
[1:34:43] ain't that right right so therefore in
[1:34:47] this age we know where we're at we know
[1:34:50] what time we're living in as message
[1:34:54] Believers we know we know it's time for
[1:34:57] the word to be made flesh the word
[1:35:00] become flesh in boys and girls and in in
[1:35:04] women and men and and we know that the
[1:35:08] lamb has come and taken that book Lord
[1:35:11] he's loosed the seals thereof and now it
[1:35:13] becomes an open book it's it's openly
[1:35:16] declared to us not in letter form not in
[1:35:20] letter form it's being openly declared
[1:35:23] in human form God becoming flesh
[1:35:28] again God becoming flesh can you sayen
[1:35:32] we know what the third pull is it's the
[1:35:34] opening of the word ain't that right the
[1:35:37] opening of the word see so it wasn't a
[1:35:39] literal book that he's come to claim and
[1:35:43] redeem uh uh but it is you it is I that
[1:35:47] he's come to redeem or de claim he's all
[1:35:51] already redeemed you at Calvary can you
[1:35:54] say amen and he's made every promise
[1:35:57] available to where these promises now
[1:36:00] can be made flesh in us and that's the
[1:36:02] book he's coming he's coming to redeem
[1:36:05] he's coming to claim his Redemption not
[1:36:07] a literal book he's coming to claim a
[1:36:10] book that is now made
[1:36:11] flesh made flesh can you say Amen his
[1:36:15] thoughts that was written is now being
[1:36:17] made manifest in a church a bride that's
[1:36:22] right remember in the Old Testament the
[1:36:25] prophet was told to eat the book
[1:36:27] Jeremiah I think or Ezekiel one of the
[1:36:30] two was told to eat the book eat the
[1:36:33] Scrolls why the prophet said why why why
[1:36:37] why was he commanded to do that so that
[1:36:39] he and the book would become one he and
[1:36:42] the book is to become one amen then we
[1:36:45] find after the after the lamb had opened
[1:36:48] the book amen and and brought it down
[1:36:51] Amen to that seventh angel messenger the
[1:36:54] prophet amen and he began to sound and
[1:36:56] all the Mysteries were revealed and and
[1:36:59] there's not one mystery that needs to be
[1:37:01] revealed it's already been revealed
[1:37:04] hello that's right don't need the lamb
[1:37:06] to come back and and take the book and
[1:37:09] and open the book or or whatever and a
[1:37:11] prophet to come back we don't need
[1:37:13] another Prophet to come back amen that's
[1:37:15] right amen we are now being dictated by
[1:37:18] this
[1:37:19] word not a one man thing but by this

[1:37:27] the Lord for the church today you've got
[1:37:29] the word of the Lord for the
[1:37:36] church then we find there at that last
[1:37:40] part of that chapter John which the
[1:37:42] prophet said would symbolize the bride
[1:37:44] represented the bride was told to go to
[1:37:46] the angel and get the book yes sir get

[1:42:45] take that Bible and and look at the
[1:42:48] Bible and it all paint in the their mind
[1:42:51] a god of history of what God done back
[1:42:54] then and what God done this and God done
[1:42:56] that but when you become the
[1:42:59] Bible then they can see a living
[1:43:03] God that a God is
[1:43:06] alive can you say Amen because it's
[1:43:12] Living Praise the
[1:43:15] Lord now brother brandham said this God

[1:43:23] be a plumber alone he didn't put you out
[1:43:25] here to be just the electrician alone
[1:43:28] whatever occupation you are in
[1:43:31] profession God did not put you in that
[1:43:35] position just to be that
[1:43:39] alone but he says he put
[1:43:42] you here as a
[1:43:44] witness a written epistle read of all
[1:43:47] men to live honorable and decent life

[1:45:06] hospitals and everybody is sick and is

[1:47:38] Creeds and man-made ideas and
[1:47:41] personalities and all these things it's
[1:47:44] time that the people get their eyes off
[1:47:47] of
[1:47:49] impersonations yes sir yeah can you say
[1:47:52] Amen many people truly believe again
[1:47:56] that they're okay and and doing what
[1:47:58] they're doing and where they're
[1:48:01] at brother Bram said you know Israel
[1:48:04] thought so he thought they were they
[1:48:06] they thought that they were okay God had
[1:48:09] delivered them from out of Egypt God had
[1:48:11] supplied them with food with water God
[1:48:15] by his Supernatural power opened the Red
[1:48:17] Sea so that they could walk through on
[1:48:20] the other side and and oh God was so
[1:48:23] good to them he he he their their shoes
[1:48:26] never wore out their clothes never wore
[1:48:28] out they they didn't need new clothes I
[1:48:31] don't know how all that happened but all
[1:48:33] it was Supernatural God was with them
[1:48:36] God healed them when the serpents were
[1:48:38] biting them and and they they they and
[1:48:40] he done it because they were murmuring
[1:48:42] and complaining and and all these things
[1:48:44] but then God rich in Mercy provided a an
[1:48:47] atonement that they could look and live
[1:48:50] and and all these things and and and so
[1:48:52] they they they had actually thought that
[1:48:54] they were comfortable I mean they felt
[1:48:56] comfortable in so then they got to
[1:48:58] Kadesh barnea right they got to Kadesh
[1:49:01] barnea and and there there on the other
[1:49:04] side of the river was the promised land
[1:49:07] and and the spies came back bringing the
[1:49:09] evidence of the land but they also come
[1:49:12] back with the report that there's Giants
[1:49:14] and we look like grasshoppers in their
[1:49:16] sight and and all of these things and
[1:49:19] they're thinking oh oh well we don't
[1:49:21] need to go over there God's been so good
[1:49:23] to us
[1:49:27] here God's Pro we've seen the mighty
[1:49:29] hand of God on this side we don't need
[1:49:31] to go over
[1:49:33] there why put our lives in
[1:49:42] Jeopardy but you
[1:49:44] know what what happened is they lost the
[1:49:47] vision of God's purpose
[1:49:50] that God did bring them through yes God
[1:49:52] did heal them yes God did provide for
[1:49:54] them in every way yes God did protect
[1:49:57] them God kept them he preserved them he
[1:50:00] he done it all for them they he led them
[1:50:03] that's right for the purpose of them
[1:50:05] going into the land not to stay there
[1:50:08] but to go over into the land but they
[1:50:11] lost the vision of
[1:50:12] God hello amen so they didn't want to go
[1:50:16] over to the promised land and and the
[1:50:18] thing was is that's where the Promises
[1:50:20] of God late was in the promised
[1:50:23] land yes sir see that's where all the
[1:50:26] promises would be made real and they saw
[1:50:28] the evidence of that land and they
[1:50:31] refused to go in have we not seen the
[1:50:34] evidence today
[1:50:36] amen absolutely I hope it's making a
[1:50:38] little sense to you today but we've seen
[1:50:40] some
[1:50:41] evidence we've had the evidence of
[1:50:44] perfect
[1:50:45] love we've seen it manifested we've had
[1:50:48] the evidence of perfect faith
[1:50:51] we we've seen the evidence of the power
[1:50:53] and the placing of adoption and what it
[1:50:55] does we've seen the evidence of a new
[1:50:58] land we've had all this
[1:51:03] evidence America has had it the world
[1:51:06] has had it they've seen it but people
[1:51:09] refuse to go on into it
[1:51:13] hello brother Bram said so many people
[1:51:15] is afraid today that somebody your
[1:51:18] neighbor see is going to say something
[1:51:21] against you he that's why they didn't
[1:51:22] want to go into the land in in Israel is
[1:51:26] afraid they was afraid of the Giants
[1:51:28] there's afraid of the the the the
[1:51:30] suffering there's afraid of what might
[1:51:32] happen and he said that's why people
[1:51:34] don't want the Holy Ghost is because
[1:51:35] they're afraid that someone the neighbor
[1:51:36] is going to say something about it see
[1:51:38] many times the pastor is afraid to say
[1:51:40] something about the gospel I'm afraid
[1:51:42] it'll hurt somebody's feelings he said
[1:51:44] well they ought to be hurt it should be
[1:51:46] hurt you know sometimes the women are
[1:51:48] afraid and they say well brother brandom
[1:51:50] you know she he said just like this poor
[1:51:53] soul she says I'm afraid that if I
[1:51:55] didn't you know if I didn't cut my hair
[1:51:57] off my husband and the rest of the women
[1:51:58] would laugh at me everybody's afraid
[1:52:02] they they don't want to be different
[1:52:03] they don't want to be odd they they want
[1:52:06] to be everybody the same we all let's
[1:52:08] all be comfortable God didn't make us to
[1:52:10] be comfortable and and if you look at it
[1:52:12] for just a moment and I'm going to I
[1:52:14] I'll I'll close but but if you look at
[1:52:16] it God didn't make you to be comfortable
[1:52:18] because God made us to show others that
[1:52:21] there's a different way there is a
[1:52:24] different
[1:52:25] life but the pow is got to be in us
[1:52:27] first the life's got to be lived out in
[1:52:30] us
[1:52:32] first we just can't keep pointing to
[1:52:34] brother
[1:52:42] brandom brother brandom talking he said
[1:52:45] you know we go to a funeral home and we
[1:52:46] feel sorry for the person that's dead he
[1:52:49] said we do our best to say good words
[1:52:51] over them you know just we we want to
[1:52:55] think the best of them he said but Jesus
[1:52:58] said except a man be born again he'll
[1:53:01] not enter in I mean that's just
[1:53:04] facts see we we we got to understand
[1:53:08] these things there has to be a perfect
[1:53:10] love in the church there there has to be
[1:53:13] an adopted son and daughter of God there
[1:53:15] there has to be amen that bride anyone
[1:53:18] that's going to make that bride that's
[1:53:20] where that's going to be right there
[1:53:22] that that perfect faith is going to
[1:53:23] manifest itself there's so there's no
[1:53:25] halfway line it's just like the Rich
[1:53:27] Young Ruler people want to make it like
[1:53:29] he's went into heaven I mean he done
[1:53:31] good to the poor he kept all the Ten
[1:53:32] Commandments and a good church member he
[1:53:35] he done all this things see you know and
[1:53:37] brother Bram say see but that there's
[1:53:38] nothing to say against that but he he
[1:53:40] did not go all the
[1:53:42] way he knew he was lacking and he knew
[1:53:45] Jesus had what he was
[1:53:48] lacking but when Jesus gave him and told
[1:53:52] him what to do he turned it
[1:53:55] aside can you say amen and so too many
[1:53:58] people are not going all the way they're
[1:54:00] they're just border line Believers ain't
[1:54:03] that right see and and so brother Brown
[1:54:06] said see that that's the thing women and
[1:54:08] men are doing it today see they go so
[1:54:10] far in God they believe in baptism or
[1:54:13] baptized TI they obey all the rules the
[1:54:16] church is laid out for them but when it
[1:54:18] comes to surrender every to Christ your
[1:54:21] life and all that's where the line lays
[1:54:25] can you say Amen it takes complete
[1:54:27] surrender
[1:54:29] Church full obedience that's right
[1:54:33] brother Bram said that's what real love
[1:54:34] is he said people get mixed up in love
[1:54:37] and wondering what love is and he said
[1:54:39] well you know human love Godly love and
[1:54:42] they just mix it all together they don't
[1:54:44] even have a
[1:54:45] clue he said but real love is
[1:54:48] obedience right to the word
[1:54:51] that's so
[1:54:55] here as we get ready close brother
[1:54:58] Braham said all Jesus's Works was
[1:55:00] complete everything was complete total
[1:55:02] delivered he totally delivered the leper
[1:55:05] from leprosy he totally delivered the
[1:55:07] woman with the issue of blood issue he
[1:55:10] totally delivered the world from sin
[1:55:12] when he died at the day of the atonement
[1:55:14] he totally delivered every sin he
[1:55:16] delivered the church so there's no need
[1:55:18] for us to live underprivileged people
[1:55:21] there's no need for us to live in a
[1:55:23] defeated State because he defeated the
[1:55:25] devil and took all the principalities
[1:55:26] and powers and subdued them under his
[1:55:28] feet and they have no legal rights to
[1:55:30] rule over you we are Christians
[1:55:32] everybody say we are Christians filled
[1:55:34] with the Holy Ghost see that's right see
[1:55:38] so we don't have to have the devil
[1:55:40] dictate to us Christ delivered us total
[1:55:42] Deliverance delivered us from evil
[1:55:44] delivered us from sin delivered us from
[1:55:46] Habits delivered us from Talking
[1:55:47] delivered us from the Black guard
[1:55:50] delivered us from all kinds of smudy
[1:55:52] things he totally delivered us and put
[1:55:55] us into his holy hands a complete total
[1:55:58] Deliverance he delivered our sickness he
[1:56:01] delivered us from sickness for we have
[1:56:03] an abstract de to that Hallelujah he was
[1:56:05] wounded for our transgressions with the
[1:56:07] stripes we were healed he is our healer
[1:56:10] that's why that poor little old Pol old
[1:56:11] woman trying to take care of her cancer
[1:56:14] dying husband she walked into the rims
[1:56:16] in the presence of God she had Faith the
[1:56:19] doctors had done all that they could do
[1:56:21] so she followed God's instructions and
[1:56:23] was totally delivered see the disciples
[1:56:26] had total Deliverance absolutely total
[1:56:28] Deliverance why because they were
[1:56:30] completely and totally filled with the
[1:56:32] Holy Ghost and when you just a church
[1:56:34] member and shook the pastor's hands or
[1:56:37] some kind of little experience of
[1:56:38] jumping shouting speaking in tongu
[1:56:40] something like that and still have
[1:56:41] malice in your heart strange Acts
[1:56:43] telling lies smoking cigarettes lusting
[1:56:45] after women there's something there is
[1:56:47] something that hasn't happened yet
[1:56:48] there's something that is wrong can you
[1:56:51] say Amen see and that's what the people
[1:56:53] need to know they they need to know that
[1:56:57] there has been a
[1:56:59] Deliverance there is a true gospel there
[1:57:02] is a reality to this they need to know
[1:57:05] the other side of
[1:57:07] it can you say amen amen that's
[1:57:12] good and who's going to tell them who's
[1:57:14] going to show them it's got to be us am
[1:57:17] and this comes back to the point
[1:57:20] we've come to
[1:57:21] minister we've come to serve amen we've
[1:57:25] come not to please people right we've
[1:57:28] come to please God so that we can help
[1:57:30] people we've come we're here to walk in
[1:57:34] such order with God that he can be
[1:57:37] pleased with our testimony that he can
[1:57:40] approve of Our Lives that when we are
[1:57:42] talking when we are wherever we're at
[1:57:44] the people can feel the presence of God
[1:57:47] upon us not that we have to act odd and
[1:57:50] different not that we have to act so
[1:57:53] strange we're just common people but
[1:57:55] there's an anointing with
[1:57:57] it can you say
[1:57:59] amen amen amen that a perfect love can
[1:58:02] flow through us a perfect faith can
[1:58:05] operate through us that a Divine Divine
[1:58:09] deity can live through us can you say
[1:58:11] Amen we ought to be so conscience that
[1:58:14] to realize that we're at the ends of of
[1:58:16] time if we don't help somebody
[1:58:21] if we don't care oh there's a lot of
[1:58:24] caring going on there's a lot of caring
[1:58:26] been expressed but no one has answers
[1:58:29] and they're willing to for forfeit the
[1:58:31] truth thinking that they can help
[1:58:33] somebody you know it's okay you know you
[1:58:37] know God understands where you're at if
[1:58:39] you want if you can't quit smoking then
[1:58:40] go ahead and just smoke it's okay you
[1:58:43] know let's have a social drink so the
[1:58:45] church is changing their patterns yes
[1:58:47] they are so they're having smok sections
[1:58:50] they they're having their drinking
[1:58:52] little drinking things as brother Brown
[1:58:53] said they're having their social gather
[1:58:55] get togethers in the basements and
[1:58:57] playing their cards and playing Bingo
[1:58:59] and playing this the church has let
[1:59:02] down and yet there's people that are
[1:59:05] dying left and right trusting in the
[1:59:07] church trusting in the government Trump
[1:59:10] ain't got the
[1:59:12] answers he ain't even if he is President
[1:59:16] people are going to die people are going
[1:59:19] to die that's just the way it is who's
[1:59:20] going to tell them about God who's going
[1:59:23] to change them who who Who's got the the
[1:59:26] ability to tell them they need to know
[1:59:29] something that that there's a life after
[1:59:32] death that there is a heaven can you say
[1:59:35] man if the musicians will
[1:59:38] come thank the Lord Jesus Great Is Our
[1:59:42] God brother Braham said what makes
[1:59:44] people believe they're okay he said
[1:59:47] because they're looking at those around
[1:59:49] them and watching their
[1:59:53] life and he says here to you older
[1:59:56] Christians to the
[1:59:57] younger the younger women look at the
[2:00:00] older women the younger men look at the
[2:00:02] older men and see the way you conduct
[2:00:04] yourself to see what you do and they
[2:00:06] presume that they're all right is
[2:00:09] because the way you
[2:00:11] do can you say Amen so you understand
[2:00:15] then that puts a real pressure upon all
[2:00:18] of us
[2:00:20] right is because people are watching our
[2:00:23] lives amen and starting with this
[2:00:25] preacher all the way down God help us
[2:00:29] right help us to conduct ourselves in in
[2:00:32] in a way
[2:00:34] that that even when we're in the trials
[2:00:37] when we're going through things
[2:00:40] and that we can ignore the hurts we can
[2:00:44] ignore the pains we can ignore the the
[2:00:47] sufferings we can ignore every
[2:00:49] everything because we know someone's
[2:00:53] watching brother brah talks about the
[2:00:55] man that was given gifts remember out in
[2:00:58] the snow going through the snow and
[2:01:00] giving gifts to all the neighbors and
[2:01:01] his little boy watching him and every
[2:01:04] house that he went to they were saying
[2:01:06] oh here have a little drink with us so
[2:01:07] he'd take a little slip time he got down
[2:01:10] the road he was getting a little bit
[2:01:13] woo and he starts staggering a little
[2:01:16] bit you know and he looked back and his
[2:01:20] boy you
[2:01:21] know was following him staggering he
[2:01:23] just saw the boy staggering and he says
[2:01:25] son straight up you walk straight he
[2:01:27] said Dad I'm just following your
[2:01:29] footsteps he said God right now I
[2:01:32] promise I'll never take another drink
[2:01:35] again because it dawned on him that what
[2:01:38] I do affects somebody
[2:01:41] else how we handle our
[2:01:44] trials how we deal with things will
[2:01:46] always affect somebody else amen
[2:01:51] and then when our life is over we preach
[2:01:53] our own
[2:01:56] funeral not by what people
[2:01:59] say people can say good
[2:02:02] words but it's really what our life has
[2:02:06] lived did we really live for the kingdom
[2:02:08] of God or did we live for
[2:02:14] ourselves God help
[2:02:17] us
[2:02:20] oh
[2:02:23] God give me is that the one you was
[2:02:26] playing a
[2:02:30] heart with
[2:02:32] [Music]
[2:02:34] love make me
[2:02:38] more like
[2:02:42] thee Oh yes

[2:04:54] softly no
[2:04:56] matter where you are at as a
[2:04:59] Christian I'm sure that we could
[2:05:02] all be drawn closer to the
[2:05:06] Lord and I pray that is your heart's
[2:05:09] desire today is
[2:05:11] that that we could become more of the
[2:05:15] word it's funny the the more we grow in
[2:05:19] God
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:23] and there's something within us that
[2:05:25] compels us you know when Trials come
[2:05:29] when situations come and automatically
[2:05:32] we want to act the way we normally
[2:05:36] would but then we're confronted with the
[2:05:40] word and the word says no you're not
[2:05:43] supposed to act that way you're supposed
[2:05:44] to act this way yeah you're supposed to
[2:05:46] do it this way
[2:05:50] and talking about the Divine the the
[2:05:52] struggles that go on at that
[2:05:55] point and that's where that we have to
[2:05:58] come to a full surrender to the word of
[2:06:00] God and say God thy will be done in my
[2:06:03] life teach me thy way oh God can you say
[2:06:07] Amen don't let me just learn knowledge
[2:06:09] about the message but let it be so
[2:06:13] rooted in me yes that I can become the
[2:06:17] message amen I can become the word am
