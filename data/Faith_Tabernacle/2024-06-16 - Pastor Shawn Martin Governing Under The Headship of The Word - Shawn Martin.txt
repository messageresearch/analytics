to uh uh just see everyone and want to wish uh your father's Happy Father's Day amen and just pray the Lord just blesses you in a special way today amen and um the um uh brother shmaya and sister Bethany has asked me to greet you all and um uh they said they're they're missing us amen and and um uh they wanted me to thank you on their behalf for your prayers and uh those who have visited and uh called checked in and uh but uh mostly your prayers uh for uh them and they uh got a uh little journey ahead of them um but uh the baby's doing good they've they've taken the baby off the ventilator and uh it's still uh got a breathing tube around its nose but it's uh the baby's doing good and uh so there's supposed to be checking for brain bleeds uh sometime I believe today and so um we want to just keep uh that in prayer sister Bethany got pretty sick last night and went uh to the the but uh doctor said everything is fine but um I'm I'm sure they would appreciate the prayers and um that the Lord will just continue to uh help them both amen and um you know I and I understand the fears of uh leaving you know they've they've discharged her uh so they're staying at the uh Ronald McDonald House they're about a half mile or so away from the hospital but that puts a strain on a mother that has to leave that baby at the hospital and uh so we want to just keep them in prayer the Lord will just uh bring a peace also protect that child uh from any harm danger that Satan would try to bring there and um and we certainly love brother shemay and sister Bethany and um also good to uh see sister hope and and sister Becca doing good amen and um um uh just you know it's um we just thank God that no matter the sickness that comes we've got a Healer and he's always faithful Amen to

really uh messed up doctrines um and uh they're they're they're struggling they're trying to find the the right balance to things and so we just want to keep brother Andrew in prayer that the Lord would just use him in a ESP special way to preach the the the the message and may the people be able to grasp it amen amen praise the Lord um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter this might be a little different um for a Father's day but hopefully um it uh will be of an encouragement to you and some way but um before we read the the word maybe we just bow our heads and talk to the author of the word Lord Jesus we come to you Lord a needy people father we're realizing more that we live that without you we're nothing and father we know that you like it that way to where where we become dependent upon you for everything father we yield ourselves to you we want to surrender everything that we are all of our talents all the gift everything that you've given us Lord we give it back to you that you could use us and I pray that you would do it so today that you would speak through this Mortal lips father and that you would speak to your people the words of life father as we stand here realizing how sacred this position is Lord and I pray father that you would bless your people and may the word that goes forth be planted into every heart father May the spirit follow that Lord and cause the word to prosper father I pray that you would bless every father here every daddy Lord that is serving you God just grant them the desire of their heart and fill their soul with joy and peace Father God I I just ask just a special blessing for them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says am amen and amen uh 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter first verse will start there says now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinance that I delivered them or as I delivered them to you but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God Amen you can have your seats this morning and um I guess the title that I would uh use um is governing under the headship of the word governing under the headship of the word we are thinking of Father's Day we we are living in a uh in the age where the role of husband and father um has nearly become extinct um the role of of husband father has been diminished uh to to to where that the the man is just a figurehead in the home and sad to say that we've got a Generation Um that doesn't know really or understand the role that uh a father and husband plays within the home and the value of it but no matter what man does uh God has ordained it to be so and he has never changed his mind of uh what man is to be and so uh and and I I'm glad to know that God still has men that are fulfilling his will and and purpose uh now the the brother brandham said that a man is to be the head of the family he's the head of his house and um of of course that isn't to be taken lightly uh that that doesn't mean that we're Macho or even any greater um um than than uh our house uh family uh but it's still the the role that God has ordained for man to to to have now headship it's it's this is what we're talking about this morning but headship is a principle of the kingdom of God that involves god-given roles and responsibilities and I'm just going to just kind of uh talk give what head or headship means it's the most prominent important member of any organized body the chief the leader the word head is often used to represent those who are in control leaders Among Us those we rely on to keep things working effectively right the head is one who leads and directs in the Bible the word head is symbolic of authority so when we speak of headship we are speaking of supervision guidance leadership oversight someone in charge of amen and and so all through the Bible there's we we see a a headship uh uh there and and so headship or leadership uh refers to the ability to inspire and guide others to achieve a common goal so with headship comes Vision purpose Direction uh uh that that's what headship is uh so so this this this phrase do as I say and not as I do that's not headship that that would be dictatorship uh but not headship because headship is leadership and so head ship means that uh being at the front of the line uh leading the way uh being in charge um it requires one to take initiative it's it's kind of like shamard when he took the initiative to uh face the enemy the enemy had been coming and taking their crops and his family no doubt was starving and they're barely making it and this was of course in the natural and shamgar began to remember that he was part of a covenant he remembered that that he was Abraham's seed and and that he was part of the promise that thy seed shall possess the Gate of your enemies and as the headship of the home he took the initiative and and God blessed him for that and he defeated the enemy Abraham uh when he heard the voice of God for God would come to him as as the head of the home and and commanded him to to leave the uh the the land of ER and go to another land uh that God had had promised him and and so Abraham took that initiative Amen to act upon the word of God and not only did he leave but he brought his his his his his family he brought his children uh well uh not his children at that time but he he brought he brought everything that was part of his family his household and and and took it with him ain't that right so so we find that that uh uh a headship uh um it requires one taking the initiative uh it also requires again to have a vision or uh to have a purpose and and but not only just just a vision or just a purpose but it has to be the right kind of vision the the the right kind of purpose amen it also requires one to be courageous uh as well as one to Be steady uh uh anchored uh faithful amen there there is a great responsibility uh uh when it comes to to headship uh uh because you you have ones that are following and and not only that you're training you are you're you're protecting you're keeping you're preserving it's it's it's it's uh uh there there there's a lot that that weighs there if if if you you you were in a battle and and you were following your commander whatever he would be uh uh you wouldn't want one that that would run and leave you in the battle uh or be a chicken and and and later on you find him in a Dugout somewhere and you're taking all the the bullets or whatever but you would want one that was was very careful and in how he led you you you're going you know we talked about it a few years ago but you know you're going through the swamps or the jungles and you know the enem is all around and and and you wouldn't want that leader say hey guys you know let's uh uh uh let's all throw a beer party or let's all go this and let's all go that and and uh let let's just you know what have y'all been doing and boy we need to get home and and all these things you want someone that would be very disciplined that would be aware and not only aware but concerned that there is an enemy all around you can you say amen and and so with that uh uh uh him knowing that he has got you in in in uh uh in his hands he's responsible for you then he's going to be careful he's going to be observant he's going to be watching the enemy he's going to know uh where to take you and what not where to take you he's going to be looking for landmines and and all of these things because he wants not just himself but he wants those that are following to come home all in tight ain't that right and alive right and so uh we we find that uh uh but but when when we're looking at today of headship a man's authority to rule and direct comes from God who appoints them ain't that right amen so then he is never according to the Bible he is never at Liberty to do things his own way but rather is responsible for seeing that things are done God's way uh of course this is the right kind of headship now this is what makes the difference between a a real believer and and one who isn't because a Believer accepts God's way and desires to to walk in that way and to fulfill his plan to fulfill the will of God it's just like Noah Noah was a Believer amen and so when God came to him and told him about the the the uh the flood the the Wrath that he that was he's going to pour out and he's going to destroy the Earth with the flood amen but God and and thank God that God just didn't give him that amen uh uh Revelation but he also gave him a revelation of what to do how to do it it in order to be saved amen it's just like today God doesn't just just give us uh the given us the revelation of of the tribulation coming and the wrath of God and all these things but he has actually given us the revelation of what to do to escape the things that are coming am and and so but Moses or Noah being that he was a Believer he he didn't argue with God he didn't say well you know what you you just you know I'll deal with you I talk with you when I'm at church and and and you know but but I'm going to do it my own way no no he he he saw to it that that Ark was built exactly the way God wanted it amen and and the Bible says he built it for the saving of his household he built it can you amen so so one thing I I thank God Amen that Noah had a had a heart for his family he he had a burden for his family he he understood the crisis that that was uh uh that he was in he understood the importance of making sure that his family was saved uh uh from the danger ain't that right and and of course he preached uh uh uh trying to get others in uh but we know ultimately it was his family that was saved and and so uh uh um we we find also that when God required uh the blood of the Lamb to be a token and it had to be displayed uh uh at a certain place uh uh on a certain thing um uh God God was very specific where that blood had to be and and and so uh uh then he required every male of that household uh the male the the man the the head of the household Amen to apply the blood and so uh every man who believe the message of the Prophet amen they were Believers amen and they did exactly the way that messenger told them to do it amen see and so uh now if you notice the order of headship uh the head of woman is man but the head of man is Christ and the head of Christ is God so then this tells us that there should be no headship exercis outside of God can you say amen amen that's right now uh 1 John 1:1 in the beginning uh was the word the word was with God the Word was God ain't that right and and so then the head of Christ is what God the word is that right it that that was the head of Christ amen John 1:14 it says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us can you say Amen so who's that Christ ain't that right so then Christ is the word of God manifest in flesh so we could say it this way the manifested word today amen is the headship of man amen amen and and so man under the headship of the word is the head of woman of the woman and and his household now I know that men you know who you know uh uh they they want to take position as head of home but they themselves refuse to come under headship oh and and they they act as though they are the ultimate head there is no head above them and and and they carry carry this uh this this uh attitude aen with him but a a man that's a Believer will always recognize his headship now now we always want woman to recognize her headship right and and and and and and and man you know uh you get some of these men that that they always remind their wise I'm head I'm head I'm head but but but and and and they they should recognize their head but but man should recognize his headship as well and and so but but this is why a man should have the new birth before he gets married and have a family this is why a a young lady should always amen pray and make sure that that man that that she wants to marry has the baptism of the Holy Ghost and has the New Birth you you can't be head over the home amen through a carnal nature and and I understand we all fight carnal natures and and and these things I'm not saying that but but what I am saying if a man has not the Holy Ghost amen then he cannot come under the headship of the word because that carnal mind is always enmity against God cannot be subject to the law of God therefore he cannot bring his own self under subjection to the word of God so then what's the use of trying to to make a home the prophet said without it being a Christian Home can can you say amen and and this is what makes I believe uh us us different from the world is is is what God has done within us amen as Believers see a home without God is a broken home a ain't that right for years man has led his home by emotions and by feelings and Sensations and and and you know we we've had this idea and we've had this thought and we we've had you know and and a lot of times we lead our homes by our own wants and our own Ambitions and our own ways and we raise up our children amen I've seen people raise up their children uh uh and and bring them into things because they didn't have it well I wasn't allowed to play in sports so I am going to get my children involved in sports buddy you know and I was broke and and we were just flat poor and I'm going to make sure that my children are rich you know and and and so we we lead our our we raise our families based on things that of our past can you say amen and and but but in this day in this day the headship has come do you believe that the headship has come amen now there are are two controlling Spirits uh in the world today and and and to be honest that that's all there are uh so that really makes it easy for us that we don't have to count this one and this one and this one and this one this one it's just two amen and and that is God and Satan it it's just plain as day and and and so uh of course uh the the spirit of antichrist is of Satan ain't that right so that Spirit of antichrist and uh the spirit of Truth is God and then the prophet teaches there's two Vines amen uh there's the false Vine and there is the True Vine ain't that right and well both Vines have come to maturity in this day uh uh we're talking spiritually speaking but it is also an effect upon upon people in this age but but both Vines have come the Antichrist Vine uh uh has has matured and the True Vine has matured in this day can you say amen and it's becoming more and more clear as to who is running it amen at least uh uh to the Believers uh as as that maturity uh uh takes place now everything uh um you know under the the the the headship of of Satan is Antichrist do you believe that everything everything can you say everything everything that is influenced of the devil is Antichrist uh their motives are Antichrist their their their uh uh Ambitions are Antichrist everything they do is is Antichrist and and and Antichrist is one who is against the word ain't that right and and so we can understand that that that that the the the things that God did not ordain uh for man is Antichrist uh uh God God never God God never uh wanted division in the home God never amen wanted division in a church God never wanted uh people so confused uh uh as it is today but but it's it's a spirit of antichrist a man that is working against God's plans can you say Amen well then we find that the true bright church is maturing as well amen now the prophet said her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word ain't that right and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which is indeed Christ and and what is Christ in you Christ in you can you say Amen Christ coming into maturity in you yes sir amen and and what that means is he's able to to control he's able to have more preeminence he's more he he's able to take his position in you he's able to to reflect himself in you it's not that he matures but he himself now is able to to have total preeminence to where the world sees nothing but Christ through all the faults through everything there is a reflection of Christ can you say Amen so now as as the false church with all cunning and Di diabolical power made up of uh political force physical Force Demons of Darkness come against this True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do now notice the True Vine with all the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very acts of power that Jesus did then as she nears The Headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom May forever be United as one now you say well what does that have to do with my life and my family and my whatever well you see people people uh try to separate religion from their personal life and home life and it's as though God only belongs in the walls of the church and so when we come to church all of a sudden we turn on this spiritual uh uh thing and and you know then we talk about God we think about God of course it's common you know or and and and it's getting less common but to to come to church and sing hymns and and to Sing About God talk about God Amen so we sing hymns in the church outside the church it's all Rock and Roll country and and and love songs and and you you understand what I'm saying uh we talk about God in church and and then when we get outside it's swearing and cussing and even the audacity to use the lord's name in vain you know but how dare we do that in church you know uh uh even though that's becoming more common uh uh with ministers amen but but see we we act religious in church and and then of course you know uh uh act like the devil you know outside of the church and I'm not talking about we I'm just talking about majority of the world today so it it's like we put on religion when performing religious duties and then take it off when we are finished see so God only has a uh uh we give God time man gives God just a certain a lot of time in his busy schedule you know and and and that's if they even have time for him right amen yes sir see and and so uh uh but for a person to think that that that life without God uh being involved amen uh uh is is is the way to go or is is is is the the the norm uh uh that that's wrong and that inspiration comes from the devil amen you see see God is Elohim he's the self-existent one he's the he's he's forever been uh never ended never started and and he he was alone ain't that right so he dwelt alone with his thoughts and in in Genesis 1:1 it says in the beginning God created ain't that right in the beginning God created then you go to Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones dominions principalities or Powers all things everybody say all things were created by Him and for him can you say amen God created All Things by him and for him so based upon this scripture alone we see that God is involved in every part of creation and he had a purpose for every every aspect of creation you realize he is the first one that instituted a marriage between man and woman amen he's the one that created the man and woman ain't that right and and and so the we we know that that the the Bible says here in the uh uh Colossians um uh 117 he is before all things and by him all things consist so this creation come by the word a ain't that right and and then the Bible would tell us that he upholdeth all things by the word of his power or the power of His word the word has power do you believe that the word has power the sun still rises amen because the word of God the power of that word is is holding it everything is the way it's uh uh uh there see and so uh uh now we want this kind of headship Amen because that's where our power comes from a do you believe that amen yes sir it it it that kind of headship the word amen is what holds us preserves us keeps us from from uh uh becoming non-existent uh or or yeah non-existent and and keeps us from being devastated and torn apart and ravished and and all of these things there is the power of the word of God can you say Amen so now when when God was in his Tabernacle the body of Jesus Christ amen uh uh he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it ain't that right amen I will build my church I will build my church amen so not only is is he the creator of man uh in in as natural and the all creation but now he's going to create himself a church amen build a church that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it and that church will be held by the same thing by the power of His word ain't that right yes sir see now not only is he the designer and the maker of this church but he is the head of this church which is his body can you say Amen see so Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body everybody say he's the head of the body he's the head of the body the church amen who is the beginning and the firstborn from the dead that in all things everybody say in all things in all things he might have the preeminence in all things can you say Amen so in other words he's going to have preeminence in your worship he's going to have preeminence in your faith he's going to have preeminence of your confession of your thinking he's also going to have preeminence in your marriage he's going to have preeminence in your home your decisions and your personal life can you say Amen see if your part of his church then you were made specifically for him and his glory you were made for him can you say amen and not just when you come to church but he has preeminence in all things he has preeminence in your personal life he's got to have preeminence in everything so if we are part of his church then there is the headship that we've come under can you say Amen now he's the head that governs the body now in his body are pastors teachers prophets evangelists Apostles or missionaries but there are also deacons trustees Sunday school teachers right secretaries musicians song leaders in this body there are fathers husbands mothers wives children right there are employers employees there are businessmen all within the body of Christ there are people that's got gifts gifted to do other things there's janitors you know there's helps and governments all within the body but there's one head can you amen so they're within the body so therefore he's going to have the preeminence over everything because he was made to be the head and he's the word so that word is the headship of the body Now 1 Corinthians 12:18 now God hath set members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him ain't that right so so with this this this thing of arguing with God or or twisting the word of God to bring a perversion is is not the way the body is ran ran there's Twisted things all in the Earth today uh uh that God never made it to be it it's just like a woman trying to be a man and man trying to be a woman and now you know even children you know boys trying to be girls and girls trying to be boys and and even identifying as an animal and and a cat or a dog or or whatever there there's so much twisting and perversion but in the body in the body there is exactly the way God made it to be yes sir can you say Amen so every gift every Minister Ministry every marriage family individual comes in subjection to the headship of the word of God and and it's the word everybody say it's the word that places every member where it should go in the body the word does can you say amen and so then every member in that body is placed as God has pleased and they are to to function within the boundaries that God has set for him or her ain't that right so therefore we must not try to take uh uh someone else's place we find that's what happened with King Uzziah he was anointed to be king and and and and God blessed him in that but then he got lifted up he got prideful and before you know it uh he's trying to take the place of the minister and God cursed him God struck him with Leprosy and he died a leper ain't that right see so we find even David anointed to be king and God blessed him he was the head of the nation of Israel but he got in trouble because he bypassed amen the the headship that God had placed uh over him in that land and and he consulted with other men instead of Consulting with the prophet ain't that right see so then if a man is Anointed to be a minister then then he must not you know try to be a prophet the prophet said that see if if he's anointed to be a minister he must not try to be a prophet you know the Evangelist must be an evangelist the pastor must be a pastor and and such you know and and brother Ram said see you Pastor shouldn't tell a prophet what to do or evangelist tell a pastor see each one has his office if it is perfectly identified amen can you amen so the Evangelist shouldn't be giving pastoral advice to a pastor's congregation it it's just not the way it's supposed to be so then then everything should be in the way God placed it it's just like in the home the wife shouldn't try to take the husband's place the husband shouldn't try to take the Woman's Place the children shouldn't take the parents' place but everything is twisted up in these days uh see and and businessman the prophet said shouldn't uh try to take the place of the minister they they they should stay out of the pulpit see God blesses them in the minist or in in their field amen but to try to come and and take another man's place or position then then there's wrong see so then there must be headship there must be headship because without headship there's confusion amen can you say amen amen you know in the Book of Judges we find that it says when there was no king in Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes this is why God ordained headship in the local body of the church he ordained headship in the home he actually ordained headship in a nation uh uh and that's true now uh it was the people that wanted a different type of headship but nonetheless uh is Israel had headship as a nation ain't that right so the Bible tells us that God is not the author of confusion this word Babylon as we the Bible talks about we hear it it it's it that's the word it means confusion uh confusion see and so then if there's any confusion it it it it comes from babbling it just uh uh uh babbling there there there's no clear cut decision right there's no clearcut answers in in Babylon it's just a a mess of confusion can you say man and it's not of God but in this day we've been called to come out of Babylon we we've been called to come out not just the church but us as individuals our homes our families our marriage everything is to come out of B confusion under a headship can you say Amen any headship must be under the headship of the word of God we have read in the Bible of Kings who did not subject themselves to the word of God and their headship brought uh Israel into idolatry yeah and caused them to be led away into captivity and if you've noticed that anytime headship is is is exercised outside of God's word it always brings people into captivity right can you say amen and and it brings Ultimate Death David caresh for example Jim Jones for example on and on and on even the Bible talks about men and and uh that had gotten a following and L them out into the desert and they all perished because it was not under the headship of the word of God hello amen that's right and families are dying just as much churches are dying just as much hello ain't that right and this nation is is declining at a rapid Pace TR that's right because there's a government without headship of the word that's true that's right and so uh uh headship started in the beginning uh when God said to the man of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die so that there God would set a boundary God would set an authority over man amen and and the the word of God that word of God was the headship of man yeah ain't that right and Adam had Dominion as long as he subjected himself to that headship see he he had fellowship with God he and his wife was in harmony with one another and with God ain't that right brother said God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with him he said that is perfect Oneness they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one and that word Oneness means United they were United together the Lord ain't that right as long as he was under that headship of the word and any man the prophet said and his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with another any family see he says and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture so then to separate uh uh uh from the word is to break your Oneness with God and and breaking the fellowship see so the prophet said this Oneness with God and we're now talking of Oneness Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you everybody say In Me In Me agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and to make it manifested in power can you say amen amen now Adam being the head he was the head of his family he was the head of creation he was the head of it all and so therefore he had the responsibility of staying under the headship of the word ain't that right and how important it is for us Brethren to stay under the headship of the word amen brothers and sisters we've got an enemy that we're fa facing it's it's it's uh uh it's well it's the worst ever and and and in my honest estimation it's even worse than what Adam dealt with and what Eve dealt with he he just dealt with a serpent we're dealing with with with millions of demons in this age because that gave opened the door for us to or the demons to to uh uh challenge us as Believers can you say amen and and they're challenging on every hand they're trying to destroy family they're trying to destroy marriages they're trying to destroy they're they're they're trying to destroy these things but there has to be a headship amen amen he a a now us men just as just like us us men we are no match for the devil in our intellect we're no match in our talents we're no match in our skill our ability our drive whatever we're are no match amen hello there's only one thing that is is got the power to preserve us and that is the word of [Music] God can you say amen amen now when Adam fell then it affected the whole human race Romans 5:12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for all that all have sinned we read in the Bible how how important headship is and what what significance that really is to us uh uh and and and how that men brought a curse upon their family through their Disobedience and Rebellion to the word such as Ahab uh uh God brought a curse upon ahab's children because of his Disobedience uh uh we find the aen uh because of his Disobedience caused his family to perish look at Esau because of what ES saw done his whole lineage become be be become uh thieves and Rebels and and and all that hiding out in caves and and things like that see but we also read where men have brought blessings and victory to their family by by their obedience we talked about Shamar amen he he he understood through all the fear and and all these things even though he felt that he wasn't able to but yet he took Courage by the word of God and by that word he acted upon it and brought Victory to his family ain't that right we we talk about Noah just as much as he acted under the headship of God he preserved his family Abraham is so you know God doesn't require you know uh as we've talked so much God doesn't require us men to be perfect we're going to make mistakes and we pay for our mistakes yes amen ain't that right but the blood of Jesus Christ is there to protect us praise the Lord hello amen and I think that's the way with our families as much Satan was Satan's after our children right I I thought of like brother brandham for example and there there he done everything serving the lord giving his all to God everything like that and then Satan comes and starts working on Billy Paul Billy Paul being out in the world he's smoking he's doing all these things but that daddy stayed with headship amen he didn't compromise on that word he didn't you understand what I'm saying amen but he stayed right there under the headship of that word believing that the word had power to preserve that family that's right amen not all times is our children doing things because of our actions it's just the devil trying to fight them that's right the devil was trying to destroy them hello yes he is and and what a benefit and I want to say this you know to you children who have parent parents and dads and and mothers that some of you may not have Christian dads but you got you got a mother that's staying right with that word amen she's under that headship of the word you're blessed to have that am that's right amen yes sir you believe it you're blessed you may see death fall but you see him rise up again you may see Mom fall but she Rises up again she's not w uh uh you know he's not just shifting over here and shifting over here and following this thing and that thing and that thing he's remaining under the headship of the word of God hello and and what it's doing it's bringing you Victory I just believe that amen Adam's fall affected creation under him as well and all creation fell with him because he's the head of it all all creation as the Bible says is groaning for the time when the sons of God comes back to the rightful position right comes back to headship over the Earth hello that's right to where that when they when they come into that adoption which is coming back to headship reigning see they will stop nature yeah that's they can speak limbs into existence under a headship hell so we going to do it can you say amen amen see that's why we we we don't look at the impossibility God help us not to look at the the things of that are negative stay under the headship of that work so so we find that that man comes back to this this reigning position of authority when he comes back in a subjection to the word of God ain't that right the Lord now Satan's power was able to take over man when he let the headship the word and and again demons are pouring in and and they're into the people they're manifesting the El in in the people in this Dimension and and why why why have they been able to do it because they've left headship of the word of God can you say Amen so then then headship is something that we come under subjection to uh 1 Peter 3 And1 it says likewise W ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands well if they are to be in subjection to their own husband are we not to be as men subject to come under subjection to our own headship amen yes sir we don't have to guess who are our head we aren't left to opinions and ideas and thoughts about these things can you say amen that's right now we look but then we find that Jesus Christ submitted to his headship as well he had headship did he not John 8:28 I do nothing of myself amen ain't that right but as my father a taught me I speak these things he didn't question the word he didn't question God's will he sought God's will right ain't that right yes he did John 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing as I hear I judge my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which has sent me so we can truly say that Christ fully obeyed the will of the father he kept him in sub himself in subjection to God and it wasn't always easy as we know it wasn't easy CU look at the the the the challenge there at at at uh in the Garden of Gethsemane he said if it be thy will let this cup pass from me that flesh was screaming out did not want to do it but God he would say but nevertheless thine be done not my will but thine be done can you say Amen so he submitted to his headship yes sir and Philippians uh uh 28 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross let let me ask you why did he do it for you and I can you say Amen Not only was he under headship he was going to be a head and he done it for us he he Sanctified himself to bring us to Victory the Lord he he forsook the world to bring us to a Deliverance can you say amen amen he knew where we were yes but he knew that that he would lay down his life on the line for our sake and because he did so it broke the curse upon us it broke the curse Lord it broke the power of of perversion that Satan exercised over man can you say amen and all because Christ kept himself our head under subjection to his headship praise the Lord hallelujah and by keeping himself under subjection then he knew who his headship was therefore he did not allow himself to come under subjection to any other influence are you with me now amen he did not allow himself remember Satan tried to tempt him he was tempted in every point that you and I are and yet he would never allow himself to come under such a a a a a subjection to that type of influence amen Lord can you say amen he didn't subject himself to the denominations at that day he didn't subjected himself to the priest of that day he didn't subject himself to the politics of that day he didn't subject himself to The Temptations and the negative thoughts that would come to his mind he kept himself subjected to the father's will amen prise even when death threatened to keep keep him in the grave don't you know fear try to get a hold of him yeah that's right if he was tempted in all points like we are we we Face fears we face well will God really keep his word does really God really got me is is this really going to happen or am I just a fool for all this and no doubt fear would try to grip him and say if they kill you it's it's forever you'll forever be that way in the ground but then he would say destroy this Temple and within 3 days I'll raise it up again why because he subjected himself to the will of God the word of God which was nothing but promises to him Lord can you say amen and I want to say to this to you don't subject yourself to anything outside of God's word true think about amen God help us not to subject ourselves to depression yeah to despair yeah amen that's right hello yes sir you know what that does for you it'll make you want to quit make you give up make you and then but what happens you become so self-involved so selfish that's what that type of spirit does and before you know it people are committing suicides and leaving the f family in despair because they come under an influence they allow themselves to come under subjection to something outside of God's word can you say Amen it's not always going to be easy to stay in your position it's not always going to be easy to stay steady but you got to remember as the headship of your home just as much as the head of the of a church that's right ministers don't realize the the sufferings that a church goes through because they allow themselves to come under subjection to Spirit of adultery the spirit of whatever they just they just they just whatever you know they leave the message I thought of the people that have left the message Ministers of have left the message because they kept feeding spirits that allowed themselves to come under subjection to it for you know what they start questioning it ain't that right and who suffers not only their family but the church you understand what I'm saying so Jesus understood he was the head yes he was and he cared to be unsub objection to his head that's right exactly ain't that right well his headship that word brought him out of the Grave on he rose again did he not right he so lived by the word till he became the word he didn't go out from the word as Adam did but stayed with it and he was made to be head of the church which is his body so therefore we as being part of the church we come under subjection to our headship yeah right yeah right amen as we get ready to close but we realize that the husband and wife is symbolic of Christ and the church the father and his family are symbolic of Christ and his family and the wife the family the church all is to subject themselves to a headship but this subjection is voluntarily which can only come by love can you say amen and this the Bible actually speaks of it and uh brother brandham but in the Book of Revelations it talks about Christ having the Key of David and this word key means Authority control so Christ alone has the Authority has the absolute control he's the it it it signifies he's head and and the you know the prophet brings it out the key is not in his hands it's it's not hanging around his neck it's not placed in the hands of other men so then where would it be and and uh Isaiah gives us the answer Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder amen so he shall open and None Shall shut he shall shut and no None Shall open he alone has this key he alone has the power he is alone has the authority he alone no struggles he alone has it but this key this Authority is upon his shoulders yeah right can you say amen Amen brother brah said see the spirit uses this Old Testament reference concerning the Lord Jesus Christ and his ministry in the church yes what the Key of David signified at that time is M Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands it has to do with our Lord after his resurrection and not his Earthly pilgrimage so this Authority Lays upon the shoulders the key and and and notice Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be up on his shoulders right how did it get there now notice now how did he get there well brother brandham he he he says now this phrase government upon his shoulders comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and he and places it over the groom's shoulders yeah right signifying that not only is he is she under his domain see see she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility can you say amen he alone amen now that takes the burden off of us as as men on because as we are the church which it takes the burden off of all of us as the church we are now United with him hello and and this word United is one with him in agreement with him we're recognizing his responsibility his position hello as being our bridegroom as being our head that's right we've transferred all rights over to him amen it's his responsib ility and he alone to take care of us true yes sir that's right amen so we find he says see beloved this is the Key of David God being Sovereign he fornew by Divine Cree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own right he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to to him and to him alone amen and she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of his church amen and so is it when we when we what we've done is when we've come in Union as as men we we've accepted that responsibility as the headship head of her home not not not a slave driver you understand that that's what the world wants to depict and that's what men have some a lot of men have become to make it a a curse that's true look upon as a shame but God has never made that to be but as men of our home as as husbands as fathers we accept that responsibility the obligation to be a provider to be a protector and not only in the natural but the spiritual can you say Amen so see he is her head for Christ is the head of his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is her Lord amen he speaks and she obeys for that is her Delight can you say Amen well do you love the Lord amen the Lord we're finding that today we are seeing exactly the opposite in the majority of the world and and it is actually fulfilling what Peter said would be in second Peter 2:10 they are walking after the Flesh in the lust of uncleanness they despise government Authority they are presumptuous which means arrogant bold daring proud insolent and they are self-willed meaning self-pleasing and I I thought of this word presumptions uh and how we see that quite a bit in this age and one example in the Bible of someone being presumption is is found in in Revelations 2:2 where God says I Know Thy Works thy labor and thy patience and how thou can bear not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and in other words they're presumptuous in the fact that they dared and bold enough to call themselves Apostles when God has not declared them to be so and they've appointed themselves to something that God did not appoint them to and therefore it's it's it's an arrogant spirit that would dare claim something that God has not declared amen yes and so the prophet would call them presumptuous and of course this is the character of Satan for in Isaiah 14:13 God said to him thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so he assumes a position position that he has no authority to do so by God God has not exalted him to that position God is not giving him that but he assumes this oh presumptuous can you say amen amen so this is exactly what we're dealing with in the age today young people is that that this Spirit of of of presumptuous the people are taking upon themselves to redefine everything that God has wanted or ordained the redefining family yeah do you realize that family the way God intended is is just about extinct right they're redefining family redefining marriage redefining the role of husband and wife redefining redefining the role of parenting redefining the church redef ining the ministry redefining everything that's right that's right and and and they're doing so by being presumptuous taking it upon themselves to change something and make it an authority without God approving it amen men want to be men women want to be you know uh or men want to be women and and and as we talked about see and and and so they're presumptuous because they despise government brother brandham used the word for this layout of see and age lawlessness yeah can you say that with me lawlessness they have no headship because they despise it we see this nationally do we not we see this internationally no one has respect for authority no our government doesn't have respect for other governments and other governments don't have respect of our government and and and and employees don't have respect for their bosses anymore more and and and and and congregations doesn't have respect for their Minister anymore and ministers don't have respect for other ministers and and and it's just constant even even children don't have respect for their parents anymore that's right and and and it's it's because you know and so we see all of this in the workplace in the home in the church and and all of these things it's presumptuous lawlessness despising government but then notice at this time God says I will send unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day I will send you a prophet amen and under this Prophet under the headship amen it's true you're going to start constructing your families you're going to start constructing a church the way I would want it to be amen deacons are going to be acting like deacons the way God wants them to be husbands are going to be husbands the way God wants them to be wives are going to be wives the way God wants children are going to be children the way God wants them to be churches are going to be churches the way God wants them to be can you say Amen why they've come under a headship GL HL and by this the wrath of God is passing over them oh Hallelujah can you say amen amen amen you don't have to fear do you love the Lord amen oh my the value of this message what's it doing it's bringing the church into agreement with one another no we've all got different ideas but it's bringing the church under a into agreement with God that's right it's bringing the home in agreement with God it's bringing our lives in agreement with God is bringing the ministry in agreement with God to where they're not just preaching any old thing they're coming in line with what God's will is for this age can you say Amen it's bringing the marriage into agreement with God bringing it all can you say amen and not only that it's going to bring the Heaven and Earth in agreement with God no sin no Sara no germs and diseases and and all that you realize it's the message of the hour it's bringing Sons and Daughters back into their position with in agreement under a headship Hallelujah and because they've come back into manifestation and back into their right place this world this Earth the heavens is coming back to way God made it to be a restored Eden Hallelujah do you love him Brethren it is so important to be guided by the word amen let the word be your answer to every question amen you believe it amen if the musicians will come ever since the fall of Man the woman has tried to take control of man and she has been successful in doing so to where today it is a woman's world right she's the goddess of America right brother Brown said she's the goddess of America being a naked female that's right but he also tells us that a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition she is to be submissive to the male it's the Commandment that God gave her and he said woman who is truly female all female will be of that disposition not a doormat no real male makes a female ad dormant but she will want to be under Authority and not rule over the male for he is the head of the house if she breaks that image that God made for her she is perverted any male that lets the woman take the authority also has broken that image and he is perverted that is why a woman cannot wear that which pertains to a man or cut her hair she is never to wear garments that pertain to a male or cut her hair when she does she is intruding into the male domain taking Authority and perverting herself now do you know that the natural is a type of the spiritual God never made the church to be her own headship or to usurp authority over her over Christ right that's right this is why Romans 12:2 Paul tells the church be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God notice the prophet said it's the nature of the church to surrender to Christ surrender to his will Just Surrender right she has no thinking of her own she takes his word and not somebody else's if Eve would have done that we' never had to die but she listened to reasonings but the real bride of Christ takes the headship of Christ the word and only believes God's word that's the real the restored Bride Can you say amen amen oh do you love him I'm so glad that I'm part of the Church of Jesus Christ
