[54:39] the Believers says
[54:41] a man and amen the book of Philippians
[54:44] the second chapter and I just want to
[54:46] read one verse there the 15th verse we
[54:50] read it Wednesday night Philippians 2
[54:52] and verse 15.
[54:56] the Bible says that you may be blameless
[54:58] and harmless the sons of God how many
[55:01] sons and daughters of God that we have
[55:03] here today
[55:04] the sons of God without rebuke in the
[55:08] midst of a crooked and perverse Nation
[55:11] among whom you shine as light in the
[55:14] world
[55:15] among whom you shine as light in the
[55:18] world let's look at the Book of Matthew
[55:19] the fifth chapter again if we can
[55:21] Matthew the fifth chapter
[55:24] I want to read the 14th verse there
[55:26] Matthew 5
[55:29] . I have just been studying here the
[55:32] past few days and the Lord has been
[55:34] opening some things to me from these
[55:36] verses so we just want to share those
[55:38] with you this morning if the Lord would
[55:39] help us and Matthew the 5th chapter the
[55:42] 14th verse
[55:44] he says ye are the light of the world
[55:47] a city
[55:48] that is set on a hill cannot be hit
[55:52] neither do men light a candle put it
[55:55] under a bushel
[55:56] but on a Candlestick and it gives light
[55:59] unto all that are in the house
[56:01] let your light so shine before men that
[56:05] they may see your good works and glorify
[56:08] your father
[56:09] which is in heaven we ask Lord this
[56:12] morning to add the blessing unto the
[56:13] reading of his word as you can be seated
[56:15] here today I want to by the help of the
[56:18] Lord this morning to speak to you for a
[56:20] few moments if I could if I titled this
[56:22] today I want to speak to you on the
[56:24] radiant bride of Jesus Christ the
[56:27] radiant bride of Jesus Christ I just
[56:30] want to share this verse again with you
[56:31] from the Amplified translation of
[56:34] Philippians 2 15 says so that you may
[56:36] prove yourselves to be blameless and
[56:38] guileless innocent and uncontaminated
[56:41] children of God without blemish in the
[56:45] midst of a morally crooked and
[56:47] spiritually perverted generation among
[56:50] whom you are seen as bright lights
[56:52] beacons shining out clearly in the world
[56:55] of Darkness so there's no question this
[56:58] morning that the world is in darkness
[57:00] Isaiah said it like this he said
[57:02] Darkness would cover the face of the
[57:04] Earth he said in Gross Darkness would
[57:06] cover the people so there's going to be
[57:08] an element of Darkness up on the Earth
[57:10] but then there's going to be a deeper or
[57:12] more darker Darkness if we could say it
[57:15] that way upon the people so here we find
[57:18] and we'll all agree that the morals of
[57:21] the age in the world that we live in are
[57:23] at an all-time low there amen mothers
[57:26] are no longer being mothers fathers are
[57:28] no longer being fathers I mean the world
[57:30] has reached its lowest air of morals in
[57:33] the world's history at the same time on
[57:35] the other hand amen perversion has
[57:38] reached its all-time high the morals
[57:40] have reached its all-time low and
[57:42] perversion has reached its all-time high
[57:44] now if you don't believe that and then
[57:46] just look at the news we've got boys
[57:48] that think they're girls and girls that
[57:50] think they're boys we've got men amen
[57:52] marrying other men and raising babies as
[57:54] if that's the modern family amen you see
[57:57] the age that we're living in is a
[57:59] morally crooked and a spiritually
[58:01] perverted generation but what I love
[58:03] about that is the Bible says that right
[58:05] there in the midst of those conditions
[58:07] there would be a bride who would be
[58:09] standing out amen she would not be
[58:12] influenced by those conditions she would
[58:14] not be going the direction or the way
[58:15] the world's going amen but she would be
[58:18] standing out now amen the prophet of God
[58:20] says in the greatest news flash I left
[58:21] off here Wednesday he said what a
[58:23] glorious thing it is for his church
[58:25] after 1900 years almost 2 000 years ago
[58:29] to know that he lives and we meet him on
[58:32] every Bend of the road at every turn at
[58:36] every place we go we see Jesus we see
[58:38] his living presence flowing like radiant
[58:41] light from his glorious Church of the
[58:44] Living God how thankful we should be for
[58:46] them so in other words we see them the
[58:49] light that is in the world today amen is
[58:52] not coming from the world Amen but the
[58:54] light that's in the world is coming from
[58:57] the presence of almighty God he said oh
[58:59] how it is today my poor decrepit friend
[59:01] that man who has never noticed power to
[59:04] give new light and to give New Hope when
[59:06] he walks into the presence of the Divine
[59:08] person of Christ with the faith that
[59:10] holds him Spellbound to his majesty he
[59:13] said isn't it like walking to the altar
[59:15] and giving the minister your right hand
[59:18] he said neither is it like going to the
[59:20] pool to be baptized or standing with a
[59:22] shell he meant to be sprinkled it's
[59:24] walking into a line that you have never
[59:26] witnessed before it's an anchor of a
[59:29] Divine faith that calls anything amen
[59:31] contrary to the word of God as though it
[59:34] was and he said it puts new life it
[59:36] gives New Hope to the dime it gives
[59:38] courage to the weak it gives healing to
[59:41] the sick it gives blessings to the
[59:43] unfavored how wonderful it is Amen to
[59:46] step into the light of his presence how
[59:48] how wonderful it is to step into the
[59:51] light of his presence not a myth amen
[59:54] neither is it something that somebody
[59:56] has just fleshly in their minds drawn up
[59:58] but it is coming directly into the
[1:00:01] presence of the king of glory the
[1:00:03] Eternal Light of the Living God so amen
[1:00:06] we're not stepping into a myth we're not
[1:00:08] stepping into a story we are not here
[1:00:11] this morning stepping into some idea
[1:00:13] amen of some denominational system but
[1:00:15] as the mind of Jesus Christ amen we have
[1:00:18] stepped into the light of his presence
[1:00:20] and that light has power Amen to give
[1:00:23] courage to the weak it has power to give
[1:00:26] healing to the sick it has power to give
[1:00:28] Deliverance to the bound it has power
[1:00:30] Amen to give sight to the blind come on
[1:00:33] Church it has blight to Old it has power
[1:00:35] to open the deaf ears amen the radiant
[1:00:38] light of the Mighty God is the presence
[1:00:40] of Jesus Christ now amen when you look
[1:00:43] at this word radium amen it means
[1:00:45] sending out loud it means shining or
[1:00:47] glowing amen brightly it is of a person
[1:00:49] of their expression amen which is
[1:00:52] clearly emanating great joy amen love or
[1:00:55] health it is of an emotion or a quality
[1:00:57] a man that is emanating powerfully amen
[1:01:01] from someone or something so in other
[1:01:03] words you're not just standing up on the
[1:01:05] earth amen receiving light amen but you
[1:01:08] have become the light by the baptism of
[1:01:11] the Holy Ghost and then out of your very
[1:01:13] being in the middle of a morally and
[1:01:15] reverse generation there is a light that
[1:01:18] is shining out of your heart amen it is
[1:01:21] pushing against the darkness among the
[1:01:23] prophet said the manifested word is what
[1:01:25] will separate the light from the
[1:01:27] darkness listen friends without this
[1:01:29] message we are as confused as the son of
[1:01:32] mites without this message we are as
[1:01:34] crooked amen as the politicians without
[1:01:37] this message we are as blameless as 900
[1:01:40] denomination amen but in the evening
[1:01:42] time it shall be light there shall come
[1:01:45] a line in the church it'll separate you
[1:01:47] listen if you're thinking you're going
[1:01:49] to fit in amen you're not a part of this
[1:01:51] message because this message did not
[1:01:53] bring you to this world Amen to fit in
[1:01:55] this message brought you to this world
[1:01:58] Amen to stand out as a lighthouse amen
[1:02:01] as a bright shining life amen the
[1:02:03] promise that Heavenly Father we thank
[1:02:05] thee tonight amen from the depths of our
[1:02:07] heart amen that there is a fountain
[1:02:09] opened in eyes it is a healing fountain
[1:02:12] that is coming from God out of heaven
[1:02:14] with his radiant hours amen pouring
[1:02:17] through amen it is enough to take a
[1:02:19] cancer-ridden person to Good Health it
[1:02:22] is enough to make the blind see the
[1:02:25] death to hear and that come to speak
[1:02:27] then whatever is Flowing Out of Heaven
[1:02:30] has got to have something to pour into
[1:02:32] listen God is not pouring his power into
[1:02:35] denomination he is not pouring his power
[1:02:38] into this building amen but there are
[1:02:40] some prepared vessels amen that were
[1:02:42] prepared from before the foundation of
[1:02:45] the world Amen to receive what God was
[1:02:48] poured into this generation amen and you
[1:02:51] are now manifesting the radiant powers
[1:02:53] of almighty God he said listen to the
[1:02:56] Holy Spirit from the Tower of Glory
[1:02:58] tonight amen broadcasting by the radiant
[1:03:01] power of the Resurrection to every
[1:03:03] believer's heart now the province said
[1:03:05] in the Statue of a perfect man he said
[1:03:07] you take us that we're nothing this
[1:03:09] morning but a wild gourd he said or a
[1:03:12] not head see there's nothing to us we
[1:03:14] were all dead and sin trespasses we were
[1:03:17] all in these kinds of conditions then we
[1:03:19] ourselves can prostrate ourselves give
[1:03:21] ourselves up until God takes this
[1:03:23] transfusion to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:03:26] amen because there's no other name
[1:03:28] whereby men must be saved and transfers
[1:03:31] The Life of Christ into US amen then the
[1:03:35] life of Jesus Christ amen it's not just
[1:03:37] in a Corporal body on the throne this
[1:03:40] morning amen but by the name of Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ through the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:44] Ghost amen the life of Jesus Christ has
[1:03:47] come into the Church of Jesus Christ and
[1:03:50] she is now manifesting the life and
[1:03:52] attributes of almighty God he said then
[1:03:54] we have that kind of Faith the faith
[1:03:56] that Christ had and Christ's Faith was
[1:03:59] not based in those Pharisees or those
[1:04:01] Sadducees or in the pots and Kettles and
[1:04:03] pans and they're washing amen it was
[1:04:05] based on the word of God Amen see amen
[1:04:08] so much until Christ was the word amen
[1:04:11] the word made flesh remember Wednesday
[1:04:13] night amen the word is becoming flesh
[1:04:16] and the flesh is becoming word right
[1:04:18] here in the middle of a morally crooked
[1:04:21] and a spiritually perverted generation
[1:04:23] amen the word is becoming flesh and the
[1:04:27] flesh is becoming the word am I to thank
[1:04:29] the prophet then when we get transfused
[1:04:31] by his power we die to our own thinking
[1:04:34] and our faith becomes a genuine Faith
[1:04:36] Hallelujah he said the Life of Christ is
[1:04:39] transfused into us we become living
[1:04:42] creatures of God a dwelling place where
[1:04:44] the Holy Spirit can send his radiant
[1:04:47] blessings down through there and we're
[1:04:50] in the stature of Christ amen let me
[1:04:52] just stop and say the stature of a
[1:04:54] perfect man was not a good idea it was
[1:04:57] not a mythical something that brother
[1:04:59] Branham hatched up in the woods while he
[1:05:01] was squirrel hunting amen but those were
[1:05:03] divine attributes they were divine
[1:05:06] virtues that were not coming from a man
[1:05:08] they were coming from the life of God
[1:05:10] and it was God's desire that in this age
[1:05:13] there would be a people upon the Earth
[1:05:15] who would be manifesting amen faith and
[1:05:18] virtue and knowledge and temper they
[1:05:20] send friends do you realize you're an
[1:05:21] oddball You're A peculiar person now

[1:05:35] nation and you've got faith you've got

[1:05:40] act like a crazy man when somebody does
[1:05:42] you wrong amen you got patience and you
[1:05:44] got you got knowledge and you got all
[1:05:46] these things you know why amen because
[1:05:48] God has raised you up he meant to be
[1:05:51] more than a Bible reader to be more than
[1:05:53] a quote holder he has raised you up to
[1:05:55] be the display of the very life of God
[1:05:58] in an age of such wickedness and
[1:06:00] Corruption he has put you up on the
[1:06:02] earth Amen to express his life through
[1:06:04] your flesh prophet of God said there's
[1:06:06] only one form of eternal life and that
[1:06:08] was God Amen then to be a sign of God
[1:06:11] you had to be in in him always he said
[1:06:13] the gene of your life spirit your life
[1:06:16] amen tonight was in God the Father
[1:06:19] before there was ever a molecule and you
[1:06:21] are nothing listen out you are nothing
[1:06:23] but the manifestation of the gene of
[1:06:26] life that was in God as a son of God
[1:06:30] that's how he could say when he went to
[1:06:33] the Cross she was with him that's how he
[1:06:35] could say when he raised the Widow of

[1:06:47] you was there in a gene but that Gene
[1:06:50] would eventually come to expression see
[1:06:52] the prophet said you're nothing but the
[1:06:54] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:06:57] was in God he said but now you're
[1:06:59] expressed amen so you've moved from the
[1:07:01] form of Gene amen into expression after
[1:07:05] his word has come into you Amen to light
[1:07:08] up this age amen God by his Sovereign
[1:07:11] will knew that there would be a gene

[1:07:18] generation amen see his word has come
[1:07:21] into you to light up this age you are
[1:07:24] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:07:27] are a son and a daughter of God
[1:07:29] therefore do you get what I mean you are
[1:07:31] now made you are sitting in this church

[1:07:37] this nation this people this
[1:07:40] neighborhood where you associate among
[1:07:42] friends amen I know we're not going to
[1:07:44] change America amen but that does not
[1:07:47] remove the responsibility amen from this
[1:07:49] bride to be the bride in the middle of
[1:07:52] this crooked Nation I know we're not
[1:07:54] going to change politics amen but that
[1:07:56] does not remove the duty and it's been
[1:07:58] placed upon you by the gene seed of
[1:08:00] almighty God Amen to be a manifestation
[1:08:03] to be an expression of what God thinks
[1:08:05] about things listen I don't know about
[1:08:07] you this morning amen but this gospel
[1:08:09] that I'm talking about it is a powerful
[1:08:12] gospel it is it is a gospel that
[1:08:14] manifests itself it is a gospel that
[1:08:16] doesn't shine amen it is a gospel that
[1:08:19] glows
[1:08:20] the problem of God said it's true that
[1:08:22] the big church shines and Glitters with
[1:08:25] polished theology while the kingdom
[1:08:27] glows with humbleness the poor and
[1:08:28] humble listen the gospel don't shine it
[1:08:31] glows he said Fool's Gold shines but
[1:08:34] real gold glows Fool's Gold shines amen
[1:08:38] but real gold glows there's a difference
[1:08:40] between a glow and a shine we know that
[1:08:43] whether big church Glitters and shines
[1:08:45] amen with high polished Scholars fine
[1:08:47] peers crucifixes all over the wall and
[1:08:50] the highest and finest of structures and
[1:08:52] buildings and great tower and things but
[1:08:54] the Little Kingdom how many is thankful
[1:08:56] Amen to be a part of that little kingdom
[1:08:58] he said but the Little Kingdom down in
[1:09:00] some little alley like here somewhere is
[1:09:03] glowing with the glory of God Amen
[1:09:05] filled with humble in every heart amen
[1:09:08] God working in them Healing The Sick
[1:09:10] raising the dead casting out Devils so
[1:09:12] forth amen just letting them pass on by
[1:09:15] in other words the glow of God is the
[1:09:18] manifestation of the desires of God and
[1:09:21] God's desire according to Mark 16 was
[1:09:24] that they would lay hands on the sick
[1:09:26] and they would recover amen God's desire
[1:09:28] was that they would cast out devils in
[1:09:30] my name God's desire was it they would
[1:09:33] speak with new tongues amen listen and
[1:09:35] the Crooked perverse generation that we
[1:09:37] live in says that don't work no more
[1:09:40] we've got to have psychologists we've
[1:09:42] got to have education amen but I happen
[1:09:44] to be a beacon of lies that will lift my
[1:09:47] voice and say God said there would be
[1:09:49] somebody in the middle of this crooked
[1:09:51] world that would say God's word is still
[1:09:53] the truth amen God's way is still better
[1:09:56] than our way I'm on Church his ways are
[1:09:58] higher than our ways his thoughts are
[1:10:00] higher than I thought amen what is his
[1:10:02] ways his ways is his word amen his ways
[1:10:06] is to heal the sick his ways just to
[1:10:08] deliver the demon tormented come on now
[1:10:10] Hollywood do not that's not Hollywood's
[1:10:12] way but we're not here to reflect
[1:10:14] Hollywood we're here to reflect the
[1:10:16] gospel
[1:10:17] the problem that God said Hollywood
[1:10:19] shines he said but the gospel glows he
[1:10:22] said there's a lot of difference between
[1:10:23] glowing and Shining brother Terry I love
[1:10:26] this to shine means to reflect light
[1:10:28] clearly and sharply amen but to Glow is
[1:10:31] to emit light amen usually softly or
[1:10:34] weakly from itself a glow is always
[1:10:36] caused by some form of energy amen
[1:10:39] listen the problem of God said he's
[1:10:41] pouring his energy into his church not
[1:10:44] by might not by power but by my spirit
[1:10:48] saith the Lord he said see the spirit
[1:10:51] energizes the word then in other words
[1:10:54] in you was the word can you can you can
[1:10:57] you can you receive that that you was
[1:10:59] born with the word in you I didn't say
[1:11:01] that William Bradham said that he said
[1:11:03] the word was in you always so the word
[1:11:06] that was in you amen was laying there
[1:11:08] dormant amen it was not going until a
[1:11:11] quickening power of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:11:14] Came Upon that seed word and begin to
[1:11:16] Quicken that word and it went from being
[1:11:18] just a seed into being an expression
[1:11:21] come on now amen see it in the prophecy
[1:11:24] we glow we're not shining with outward
[1:11:26] appearance but we're glowing on the
[1:11:28] inside by the Holy Ghost amen with
[1:11:30] sweetness and meekness and gentleness
[1:11:32] and patience and love amen glow don't
[1:11:35] shine amen that that word shined amen
[1:11:37] means a brightness from a source of
[1:11:39] light can I tell you amen that the world
[1:11:42] in Hollywood and education and science
[1:11:44] has become denomination source of light
[1:11:47] everything they do is be an influenced
[1:11:50] from a morally and perverse generation
[1:11:52] among now we might as well preach we're
[1:11:54] here amen their song services are no
[1:11:57] longer a bunch of people getting
[1:11:58] together and singing to the glory of God
[1:12:01] comes down but it's a big rock and roll
[1:12:03] show it's a big light show where did
[1:12:05] that come from that didn't come from the
[1:12:07] Bible that came from Hollywood I'm on
[1:12:09] their preaching is no longer amen a man
[1:12:12] getting behind the pulpit and yielding
[1:12:14] himself to the Holy Spirit and preaching
[1:12:16] wherever God leads him in and whenever
[1:12:18] God tells him to say oh no it's now
[1:12:20] controlled by some manual and some
[1:12:22] educated degree that the manhole where
[1:12:24] did that come from that did not come
[1:12:26] from the gene expression of God's word
[1:12:28] that came from a morally amen and
[1:12:31] spiritually perverse generation but my
[1:12:34] Bible says in the end time that God
[1:12:36] would restore our people Amen to the way
[1:12:38] it was in the beginning listen I don't
[1:12:41] care what denomination says they were
[1:12:43] not so in the beginning but whatever
[1:12:45] this word says was in the alpha and
[1:12:48] it'll be in the Omega bride there were
[1:12:51] signs and wonders in the beginning
[1:12:52] there'll be signs and wonders in the end
[1:12:55] they were shouting and Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] manifestation in the beginning and
[1:12:59] they'll be shouting and Holy Ghost
[1:13:01] manifestation in the Ammon now it's in
[1:13:04] the word that which discernment in the
[1:13:06] beginning and they'll be discernment in
[1:13:08] the end but it'll be by the word
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:12] are you hearing me this bride will not
[1:13:15] be under the influence of Hollywood
[1:13:17] light she will not bear the influence of
[1:13:19] educational line she will be walking
[1:13:21] under the glow of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:13:25] Christ you say how can you say that
[1:13:27] because Jesus was the glow of God
[1:13:31] can I say that like that Jesus was the
[1:13:35] glow of God he was not the shine of God
[1:13:37] he was the glow of God the part of God
[1:13:40] said then I've tried to think and make
[1:13:42] Jesus Christ my pattern he could have
[1:13:45] created fish he could have created money
[1:13:47] he could have made wine from water he
[1:13:49] could have had thousands but yet he
[1:13:51] didn't have a place to lay his head he
[1:13:53] was our example nothing to shine but
[1:13:56] something that glows the gospel do you
[1:13:58] see then this morning we are not here
[1:14:00] amen as animals that are attracted to

[1:14:23] for a glow with humility and love and
[1:14:26] power amen that's what the real Eagle

[1:22:14] Jesus was born in Bethlehem and Judea in
[1:22:17] the days of Herod the king behold there
[1:22:19] came wise men from the east of Jerusalem
[1:22:21] saying where is he a man that is born
[1:22:25] King of the Jews for we have seen his
[1:22:27] what
[1:22:28] we have seen his star Amen in the East
[1:22:32] and are come to worship him we have seen
[1:22:36] his star in the east and are come to
[1:22:38] worship Him preaches the great Shining
[1:22:40] Light he said we find these Mages honest
[1:22:43] in their heart Desiring to see the one
[1:22:45] true God looking for his prophecy to be
[1:22:47] fulfilled when said that the Lord shall
[1:22:49] raise up him and a kingdom shall have no

[1:23:06] Bible said there would be one raise up
[1:23:08] who would have a kingdom and to that
[1:23:10] Kingdom there would be no end it would
[1:23:12] be an everlasting Kingdom and something
[1:23:14] in that prophecy amen lit something in
[1:23:16] their souls and them hungry hearted

[1:31:52] you are a star
[1:31:54] your family may not think you are amen
[1:31:56] but a prophet said you are you are a
[1:31:58] star you know what John the Baptist was
[1:32:01] he was a star John 5 35 he John amen was
[1:32:05] a burning it was a burning and a Shining
[1:32:07] Light and ye were willing for a season
[1:32:10] to rejoice in his light remember said
[1:32:13] John was the light but he was more than
[1:32:15] the light of Elijah in them had he
[1:32:17] wasn't Elijah's light but he was Elijah
[1:32:19] another form of vindicating the light
[1:32:21] see when Jesus come he said it was a
[1:32:25] bright and Shining Light for a season
[1:32:27] and you love to walk in his light but
[1:32:29] now watch John I messed them out I must

[1:32:37] increase he's the light he said I am the
[1:32:40] light of the world Amen see he's the
[1:32:42] light he's still the light of the world
[1:32:43] in the beginning what's the word the
[1:32:45] word was with God the Word was God why
[1:32:48] was he the light of the world if he'd
[1:32:50] come said he was Messiah he didn't do
[1:32:53] like the Bible said the Messiah would do
[1:32:54] then he wasn't the light of the world
[1:32:56] but it's the a Vindicated word that
[1:32:59] makes it Lie To The World the word
[1:33:02] Vindicated becomes the light to the
[1:33:05] world in other words John brother Sean
[1:33:07] was not a glare of the Messiah he was a
[1:33:10] reflection of the Messiah he was not a
[1:33:12] false conception or a false Mirage
[1:33:14] brother Judah of the Messiah amen he was
[1:33:17] a manifested beacon of light come on now
[1:33:21] you want to talk about crooked perverse
[1:33:22] generation look at the Pharisees and
[1:33:24] Sadducees you're not the first one that
[1:33:26] God has chosen to be a lighthouse in the
[1:33:29] midst of Darkness John was in the middle
[1:33:31] of religious amen pharisaic sadness amen
[1:33:34] lawyers and scribes and all kinds of
[1:33:37] tradition and John with a message stood
[1:33:39] there in the middle of that and said my
[1:33:41] commission is to make the high places
[1:33:43] low and the low place is high in order
[1:33:46] to give the Messiah a fit reception when
[1:33:49] the light that is the word comes in the
[1:33:51] manifestation I'm on church amen if you
[1:33:53] make a rational mistake amen like the
[1:33:55] Churchman of that day don't do that he
[1:33:57] said don't you think it's time that we
[1:33:59] stopped and considered what is light
[1:34:02] if we are light then don't you think
[1:34:05] it's time we stop and consider what is
[1:34:07] light the prophet of God can I tell you
[1:34:09] what a prophet said he said the
[1:34:11] Vindicated spoken word of God the light
[1:34:14] brother Shema is the Vindicated spoken
[1:34:17] word of God outside of that there's no
[1:34:20] light you cannot light in the Earth with
[1:34:22] flashlights it takes God's word that's
[1:34:25] made manifest he said see the s-o-n the
[1:34:29] son do you realize amen that your Bible
[1:34:32] was not wrote Under artificial light
[1:34:35] what do you mean I tell you what I mean
[1:34:37] you're like your Bible was not rode
[1:34:40] under electrical light because that
[1:34:42] light is artificial light
[1:34:44] come on now
[1:34:45] again
[1:34:47] darkness and darkness cover the face of
[1:34:49] the deep and God said let there be a
[1:34:52] light bulb let there be a lamp let there
[1:34:54] be a bulb no the Bible said let there be
[1:34:57] a son amen the original light was the
[1:35:01] Sun come on now what was the sun the sun
[1:35:05] amen if you trace it back amen is fire
[1:35:08] so the original light was fire in the
[1:35:11] beginning was fire if you trace it back
[1:35:13] what is this in this picture it is the
[1:35:16] pillar of fire here in the end time the
[1:35:20] original Bible light would return to the
[1:35:22] church and they would not be sitting
[1:35:24] here under man-made flashlights of
[1:35:27] Baptist and Methodist they would be seen
[1:35:29] here under the original light which is
[1:35:31] the fire of God that would allow their
[1:35:34] past it would light their families oh
[1:35:36] come on church I tell you what this
[1:35:38] morning that's why if the power went out
[1:35:39] we could still have church that's why
[1:35:42] the microphones went out and the blots
[1:35:44] wouldn't turn on we could still have
[1:35:45] church because we're not the hybrid
[1:35:48] Church depending upon artificial light
[1:35:50] we are the manifestation of the word
[1:35:52] born bride who has been restored to the
[1:35:54] original line which is the fire of God
[1:35:58] I'm on church that's why them Christians
[1:36:01] work cold because they was around too
[1:36:03] much power to get cold
[1:36:05] hello now amen what is light it's the
[1:36:08] spoken word of God Vindicated in the
[1:36:10] evening time it shall be light he said
[1:36:13] then what is light Sent for so you can
[1:36:15] see how to get around see where you're
[1:36:17] at what does Light Produce he said light
[1:36:20] produces life there can be no life
[1:36:23] outside of Life natural or spiritual
[1:36:25] then what is his word his word is the
[1:36:29] light and the life to this age
[1:36:31] can I say that his word is light and
[1:36:34] life now what did Jesus say he said I am
[1:36:38] the light military he could have very
[1:36:41] well said I am the word I am the light
[1:36:45] of the world that those that followeth
[1:36:48] me shall not work in darkness work but
[1:36:50] shall have the light of Life John 9 5 as
[1:36:53] long as I am in the world I am the light
[1:36:56] of the world the father God said they
[1:36:58] worship the one true God by what a
[1:36:59] sacred fire they watch the licking of
[1:37:01] the Blazers for they knew that the one
[1:37:03] true God Amen dwelt in light so the
[1:37:06] original light was power can can we can
[1:37:09] we agree on that brother Doug the
[1:37:11] original light was fired he said and
[1:37:13] that's true amen God dwells in light so
[1:37:17] what was God dwelling in before he come
[1:37:20] into a body called Jesus he was dwelling
[1:37:22] in a pillar of fire I'm on church that
[1:37:27] fire god and a man that fire gone into a
[1:37:30] flesh-born body I'm on Church amen and
[1:37:32] that fire is not in a picture this
[1:37:34] morning it's not just in heaven it's not
[1:37:37] just in a tomb in Jeffersonville it's
[1:37:39] not in a museum in Jeffersonville that
[1:37:42] fire has returned to flesh and it set
[1:37:45] our soul among Church how could Jeremiah
[1:37:47] stand there and say his word it's like a
[1:37:50] fire and it's set up in my bones amen
[1:37:53] because it's a unquenchable fire it's a
[1:37:55] burning fire it's a hot fire my God is
[1:37:58] an all-consuming fire and whatever will
[1:38:01] lay on the altar he will lick it up in
[1:38:03] the bleaches of his fire and he will
[1:38:05] change that from be a Darkness into
[1:38:07] being a manifested light God dwells in
[1:38:10] light when he was on Earth he manifested
[1:38:12] in flesh he said I am the light of the
[1:38:14] world because God was manifested through
[1:38:17] him and he was the LIE the pillar of
[1:38:19] fire that led Israel he was alive that
[1:38:21] struck Paul down on the road to Damascus
[1:38:23] he was alive that come to prison and
[1:38:25] Peter he's alive that's on that picture
[1:38:27] he's the light that's in my heart he's
[1:38:29] the life that's in this church he's the
[1:38:31] m Everlasting Light and in him is no
[1:38:35] Darkness come on now remember said where
[1:38:38] is that fire coming when you get up in
[1:38:40] the morning as a 50 some year old man
[1:38:42] and you don't feel like you can fix
[1:38:43] another day he said quickening power is
[1:38:45] already in your bones he said the fire
[1:38:48] of God Is In You by the baptism of the
[1:38:51] Holy Ghost and Fire what are you saying
[1:38:53] I'm saying like I said Wednesday Jesus
[1:38:55] is the word he is the concept of God
[1:38:58] expressed in flesh when God was truly
[1:39:01] revealed he was manifested in flesh
[1:39:04] remember said Jesus was all inspired
[1:39:06] prophets testimonies and all their
[1:39:08] prophecy was brought to light in his age
[1:39:11] come on now the Prophecies of Isaiah and
[1:39:15] Micah and Malachi and Zechariah and
[1:39:18] Moses all the prophets concerning the
[1:39:21] event of the Messiah was brought to
[1:39:23] light in a flesh body called Jesus he
[1:39:26] said he was the oh God he was the
[1:39:29] prophesied word let's say what he says
[1:39:31] here brother John on he lit up every
[1:39:33] candle of word that was in the Bible
[1:39:36] that was prophesied of him listen amen
[1:39:39] he come on now them words was
[1:39:41] controlling him amen he could not change
[1:39:44] those words he had to become those words
[1:39:46] when he read it he had to become it
[1:39:48] because it was the word spoken of him my
[1:39:51] then what is the word made flesh I'll
[1:39:54] tell you when the prophet said he said
[1:39:55] the word made flesh is the light of the
[1:39:58] age when you see it come on now Isaiah 7
[1:40:02] was concerning the Messiah amen
[1:40:04] Zechariah 9 concerning the Messiah
[1:40:06] Genesis 3 15 concerning the Messiah amen
[1:40:10] but Malachi 4 is concerning Messiah John
[1:40:13] 14 12 is concerning Messiah Mark the
[1:40:17] 16th chapter come on now amen to Luke
[1:40:19] the 17th chapter first Thessalonians 4
[1:40:22] First Corinthians 15 Revelation 5 10
[1:40:25] Revelation 21 them are not containing to
[1:40:27] the Messiah amen they are containing to
[1:40:30] the bride and the same better fire that
[1:40:33] quickened his body to Genesis 3 and
[1:40:35] Zechariah 9 and Malachi 4 is the same
[1:40:38] light and his return to the church and
[1:40:40] he's lighting the candles of God's word
[1:40:42] and you are becoming Revelation 10 you
[1:40:45] are becoming Luke 17 30. you are
[1:40:47] becoming the resurrection in John 11
[1:40:49] chapter are you hearing me we are not
[1:40:51] about to help us hope us crooked
[1:40:53] perverted generation we are the bride
[1:40:55] radiating with the light of God the
[1:40:58] original fireborn light
[1:40:59] [Applause]
[1:41:00] his original lie has returned to his
[1:41:03] church this is the promise for his age
[1:41:05] the word made flesh can I say it to you
[1:41:08] like this or the word made manifest amen
[1:41:11] the word made manifest the manifested
[1:41:13] word or the manifestation of the word is
[1:41:17] the light of the age
[1:41:20] worry now can I just preach to you for a
[1:41:22] second
[1:41:24] I said that to put every devil out of
[1:41:26] here the word made flesh is the light of
[1:41:31] the age the part of God said Jehovah God
[1:41:35] created those things brought himself
[1:41:36] down to live in the human heart of you
[1:41:37] and I before he did he had to clean his
[1:41:40] Road who cleaned his road for him John
[1:41:42] the Baptist
[1:41:43] raise the high places down low back that
[1:41:46] up then lower the high places and raise
[1:41:49] the Low Places I got to be careful there
[1:41:52] we've had some discussions about going
[1:41:54] up to Florida are you hearing me amen he
[1:41:57] raised the Low Places and made the high
[1:41:59] places low he come down and showed them
[1:42:02] love notice what he did then then he
[1:42:04] broke his way right into the heart of
[1:42:07] man oh God and God I love how he says
[1:42:11] that he broke his way right into the
[1:42:13] heart of man and now God is in us we are
[1:42:17] his gospel on Earth the word made
[1:42:20] manifest is the gospel come on now
[1:42:23] there's a son of my church a church
[1:42:25] nominal amen which the promise said
[1:42:27] Billy Graham went to them he said see as
[1:42:29] it was in the days of Sodom there's
[1:42:31] Billy Graham g-r-a-h-a-m out there in
[1:42:34] the field but now he sends the messenger
[1:42:37] to the church elected Pentecostal
[1:42:39] elected pulled out not out there nominal
[1:42:41] church but the church elected the Holy
[1:42:44] Spirit moving in the church is what does
[1:42:46] the works that that wasn't that body of
[1:42:50] Flesh it probably vanished but it was
[1:42:52] God in that flesh come on now the
[1:42:55] prophet is showing you amen the God that
[1:42:57] was in the flesh called Melchizedek was
[1:43:00] the God Amen that changed the body of
[1:43:03] Abraham and Sarah to put him in the
[1:43:05] condition to fulfill the promised word
[1:43:07] amen showing that God God but do you see
[1:43:10] what that was it was a foreshadow I love
[1:43:13] the way but remember since these things
[1:43:14] that God would again somebody say God
[1:43:17] but again
[1:43:18] God would again dwell in the redeemed
[1:43:21] flesh of his church in the last days and
[1:43:25] would do the same sign as it was in the
[1:43:27] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:43:29] coming of the son of man what would you
[1:43:31] see the manifestation of the word the
[1:43:35] word is sharper it is a discerner and if
[1:43:37] the word is manifested again today then
[1:43:40] won't it be Jesus today
[1:43:42] if a word is manifested again today then
[1:43:46] won't it be Jesus then what did he call
[1:43:49] you he did not call you miss Baptist he
[1:43:52] did not call you miss Pentecostal he
[1:43:54] said Mrs Jesus Christ amen why because
[1:43:58] the word the fire the light has become
[1:44:01] flesh in your flesh the layout of sin
[1:44:03] Church ages blind he says blind the what
[1:44:06] to the manifestation of the word that's
[1:44:09] why they're hollering for Revival and
[1:44:11] they're not getting nothing because
[1:44:12] they're blind to the source of Revival
[1:44:14] that has returned to the church amen but
[1:44:17] the manifestation of God I'm old church
[1:44:20] I'll tell you what I see in that picture
[1:44:21] I see the manifestation of God I'll tell
[1:44:24] you what I hear in Souls that are in
[1:44:25] prison when he stood there and be held

[1:44:35] see there I see the manifestation of God
[1:44:39] I'm about to explode up here I tell you
[1:44:41] what I hear on them seven seal tapes I
[1:44:43] hear the manifestation of God I'll pay
[1:44:46] you what I hear when I hear him say I'll
[1:44:47] turn my back to this congregation and
[1:44:49] you're so and so went to Dr so and so
[1:44:51] diagnosed with such and such sister Jane
[1:44:54] I hear the light the fire the
[1:44:56] manifestation of God at his return to
[1:44:58] this age
[1:45:00] but can I tell you this it's not just
[1:45:03] wanting to stay in book form it's not
[1:45:05] just one to be on tapes it's one to get
[1:45:08] out of the picture and get in flesh are
[1:45:11] you hearing me that is what makes you
[1:45:12] the manifestation of God the word Bride
[1:45:14] for the word groom he says in modern
[1:45:16] events May clear by prophecy we're
[1:45:18] living in that day when the
[1:45:20] manifestation of God has come to a
[1:45:22] different age than the Pentecostal age
[1:45:25] now let's not leave that open for
[1:45:26] somebody else to Define let's let a
[1:45:28] prophet Define it the bright Age
[1:45:32] The Bride age which would have what
[1:45:34] bright light come on now do you oh God
[1:45:38] help me Lord do you realize the bride
[1:45:41] age is an age that is not contaminated
[1:45:43] with artificial light the layout of sin
[1:45:46] Pentecostal age was contaminated with
[1:45:49] artificial light amen but you cannot
[1:45:51] come to maturity come on because you're
[1:45:53] not a church and it's a hotbed plan that
[1:45:56] is birthed in a greenhouse you are a
[1:45:58] genuine seed and you've got to have the
[1:46:00] nurture into the soul you got to have
[1:46:02] the sunlight of the Rays you got to have
[1:46:04] the water you got to have everything
[1:46:05] that a natural seed has to have so God
[1:46:08] had to call you out from under the
[1:46:10] influence of artificial light into the
[1:46:12] presence of the s o n that you can ripen
[1:46:15] and come to your full potential and
[1:46:17] could radiate the life of Jesus Christ
[1:46:20] oh somebody shout bright age bright age
[1:46:24] it's a different age it's gonna be on
[1:46:26] the manifestation of the Pentecostal age
[1:46:28] it's the bright age what is the word
[1:46:30] bride she is the manifestation of the
[1:46:34] hour not a Creed a living Oracle living
[1:46:37] attribute of God this play into the
[1:46:39] world the attributes of God
[1:46:41] in the formation of the Bride that's to
[1:46:44] be expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:46:47] living so Jesus the light of the world
[1:46:50] said ye are the light
[1:46:53] can I have a few more minutes Jesus the
[1:46:57] light of the world turned his disciples
[1:47:00] and said you are the light of the world
[1:47:01] a city that is set on a hill notice this
[1:47:04] the promise said the moon and the son is
[1:47:06] husband and wife while the sun is gone
[1:47:08] it throws his light against the moon to
[1:47:10] give us a smaller light until the sun
[1:47:12] comes and when the sun comes the mood
[1:47:14] Fades out and Christ is the son who's
[1:47:17] gone to Glory but is shining on the
[1:47:20] church with the same kind of light he
[1:47:22] shine when he was here and the church is
[1:47:25] the light of the world until Jesus comes
[1:47:27] and it all melts together see today ye
[1:47:31] are the light of the world in his
[1:47:33] absence his presence is giving you light
[1:47:35] to shine with while he's here Reverend
[1:47:38] said see I'm talking about Messiah they
[1:47:41] are the light of the church today the
[1:47:43] light of the world you are a candle that
[1:47:47] sets on a hill a light that can be seen
[1:47:50] from everywhere we are the light can we
[1:47:53] can we say that together we are the LIE
[1:47:56] Orlando that seems pretty boastful we
[1:47:59] are the light what are you saying
[1:48:01] brother Matthew I'm saying this it is
[1:48:03] time Amen to start confession with
[1:48:05] conviction when a prophetess spoke over
[1:48:07] this church
[1:48:09] come on now I think it's time you can
[1:48:12] tell the difference between a confession
[1:48:14] and a conviction fish a confession by
[1:48:16] conviction I'll get it out in a minute
[1:48:18] amen somebody come and say oh I believe
[1:48:21] the message
[1:48:22] that's a confession amen but let but let
[1:48:25] somebody say what do you believe I
[1:48:27] believe the message of the hour I have
[1:48:29] become the word I eyes have been Open
[1:48:31] the Eyes that's more than just a
[1:48:33] confession that is a confession with
[1:48:36] some conviction behind it and I think
[1:48:38] it's time that our young people start
[1:48:40] confession who you are with more than
[1:48:42] just what I attend the church I go here
[1:48:44] no I think it's time to start saying I
[1:48:46] am a messiah at I think it's time to
[1:48:49] start saying I am an overcomer I think
[1:48:51] it's time to start saying what a prophet
[1:48:53] I think it's time for more than the
[1:48:55] preachers to take the gloves off and
[1:48:57] confess what a prophet said I think it's
[1:48:58] time for some Housewives Amen to take
[1:49:01] the gloves off and stand in their home
[1:49:03] and say I am a messiah and Satan take
[1:49:06] your hands off my baby I think it's time
[1:49:08] for some people that's a part of Faith
[1:49:10] Tabernacle to take the gloves off and
[1:49:12] stand on the confession amen that this
[1:49:15] church is a church that believes the
[1:49:17] message and Satan take your hands off of
[1:49:19] it I'm on church I think it's time some
[1:49:21] of y'all start confessing the Divine
[1:49:23] Healing promises with some conviction
[1:49:26] we've had enough weak confessions well
[1:49:29] brother Jr we need some confessions with
[1:49:31] some conviction
[1:49:34] I'm gonna preach around a few days
[1:49:36] confession with some conviction quit
[1:49:38] talking like a defeated Church entity
[1:49:40] lay out a sin it's a different age for
[1:49:43] you it's a different language for you
[1:49:45] it's a different season for you you're
[1:49:47] under a different light
[1:49:49] or you may get mad at me but I'll love
[1:49:51] you when it's all said and done quit
[1:49:53] coming in here looking with a look a
[1:49:54] layout to see on your face when you show
[1:49:56] up at the house of God real wowzy wowzy
[1:49:59] woo that's where the Jew would say poor
[1:50:01] pitiful me I barely made it that's the
[1:50:03] way the laodicea and show up amen but
[1:50:06] we're not about to lay out of sins we're
[1:50:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ we might have
[1:50:10] fought Devil's whole day to get here on
[1:50:12] a Wednesday night but show up as a
[1:50:14] manifested messiah and draw your sword
[1:50:17] and Pierce the atmosphere of unbelief
[1:50:19] and push the atmosphere of Darkness
[1:50:21] unless the radiant light of Jesus Christ
[1:50:23] break out in the church and change
[1:50:25] somebody's heart
[1:50:28] somebody shall change us Lord
[1:50:31] Jesus Lord oh God I got a whole message
[1:50:35] here you're a candle look the David say
[1:50:38] can I have can I have a few more minutes
[1:50:39] is what we got one service today
[1:50:43] for that will light my candle the Lord
[1:50:46] my God will Enlighten my darkness look
[1:50:48] what Proverbs 20 27 says the spirit of
[1:50:51] man is the candle of the Lord searching
[1:50:54] all the inward parts of the belly now do
[1:50:56] you realize what he's speaking thereof
[1:50:57] this is Bible commentary of No Authority
[1:51:00] take you to believe it it is a Divine
[1:51:02] Light it is a discovery light so the
[1:51:05] Divine Light comes into the soul of man
[1:51:08] and that light becomes a discovery light
[1:51:10] come on now that discovers all the
[1:51:14] things that's in the heart of man we
[1:51:15] could very quickly turn brother shamai

[1:51:20] are you hearing me the part of God said
[1:51:22] see you now now one day one one
[1:51:24] commentator says that that spirit is
[1:51:28] speaking of the conscience well I love
[1:51:29] what the prophet said you can't sell
[1:51:31] anybody anything to eat unless they're
[1:51:33] hungry the only way the world will ever
[1:51:36] see Christ is when they see it in you
[1:51:38] and me the only way they'll ever see
[1:51:40] Christ their conscience are numb to the
[1:51:43] sunsets can the guy say it to you like
[1:51:46] this you've heard it for years you're
[1:51:48] the only thing standing between this
[1:51:50] world and tribulation judgment but can I
[1:51:52] tell you something else you're the only
[1:51:54] thing left upon the Earth that the world
[1:51:56] is not numb to see God in
[1:51:59] come on they're numb to the sunsets they
[1:52:02] don't see God they see a solar system

[1:53:49] change my language I've with her and
[1:53:51] spoke what I speak but there's an
[1:53:53] interpreter there Amen to break it down
[1:53:55] so the people can understand what I'm
[1:53:57] here and we need some god-called
[1:53:59] preachers it'll get in the pulpit and
[1:54:02] forget who's visitors and forget who
[1:54:04] don't know about a prophet and say what
[1:54:06] a prophet said and let God who is The
[1:54:08] Interpreter of his own word take the
[1:54:10] language and break it down in the hearts
[1:54:12] of his people till they manifest
[1:54:13] something more than a Creed or an idea

[1:55:13] know why there's so much nonsense it's
[1:55:15] cause a bunch of men quit saying what a
[1:55:17] prophet of God said and the fire of God
[1:55:19] left the church there was no power to
[1:55:21] clean out the Devils there was no lie to

[1:55:25] here who can turn on the light there is
[1:55:28] a man here who can find redeemed flesh
[1:55:30] and manifest himself through it and

[1:57:42] Candlestick of what pure gold I've
[1:57:44] beaten Works how about Candlestick be
[1:57:46] made his shine
[1:57:47] his branches his bowls his knobs his
[1:57:50] flowers shall be of what of the same
[1:57:54] somebody said it with me of the same
[1:57:56] everything that's in this Candlestick is
[1:57:59] going to be of the same
[1:58:02] in other words it's going to be original
[1:58:05] in other words it's going to be from the
[1:58:07] beginning in Exodus 26 35 thou shall set
[1:58:10] the table with the veil and the
[1:58:12] Candlestick over against the table on
[1:58:14] the side of the Tabernacle toward the
[1:58:16] South and thou shalt put the table on
[1:58:18] the North side 27-20 Exodus and now
[1:58:20] shall command the children of Israel
[1:58:22] that they bring the pure of olive oil
[1:58:25] beaten for the light Amen to cause the
[1:58:28] lamp to burn sometimes
[1:58:31] to burn to cause the lamp to burn when
[1:58:33] everything's going good
[1:58:35] to cause the lamp to burn when
[1:58:36] everybody's happy
[1:58:38] to cause the lamp to burn always
[1:58:42] now do you realize if you leave Exodus
[1:58:44] which is in what the beginning of the
[1:58:46] Bible and you go to Revelation which is
[1:58:48] what at the end of the Bible in 112 says
[1:58:51] I turn to see the voice that speak with
[1:58:53] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:58:57] candlesticks and in what the midst of
[1:59:00] the seven candlesticks there was one
[1:59:02] like in the son of man he was clothed
[1:59:04] with a garment down to the foot and gird
[1:59:06] about with perhaps with a golden girdle
[1:59:07] but then preachers in the seven Church
[1:59:09] ages he said the seven golden
[1:59:11] candlesticks had little lamps on top of
[1:59:14] them that did what they burnt oil
[1:59:16] Zechariah saw it in the vision the Jew
[1:59:19] and the Gentile the golden centers to
[1:59:21] all the branches see but the but the
[1:59:23] same olive tree that tame Olive Tree of
[1:59:25] course was broke off was what gave the
[1:59:27] Wild Olive Tree grafted into it notice
[1:59:30] this all represents the Holy Spirit he
[1:59:33] said we'll get in that little Mark of
[1:59:34] the people all represents the Holy
[1:59:36] Spirit what does he say in the third
[1:59:37] seal in Revelation 6 see thou touch not
[1:59:40] or hurt not amen the oil and the wine
[1:59:43] notices see thou hurt not the Holy Ghost
[1:59:47] and the revelation
[1:59:49] are you with me see thou hurt not the
[1:59:52] Holy Ghost and the stimulation that
[1:59:55] giveth Revelation he said notice these
[1:59:57] golden candlesticks this all poured into
[1:59:59] these candlesticks but the oil was put
[2:00:02] into the lamp to burn now Aaron if it
[2:00:04] was his duty to lock these lamps he said
[2:00:06] hold on now keep it real reverent and
[2:00:08] listen these lamps had to be lit by the
[2:00:11] fire that God had lit then pray tell me
[2:00:14] what was the fire that God had lit it
[2:00:17] was not in a it was not in a cigarette
[2:00:20] lighter it was not in a match come on
[2:00:23] now amen it was not amen a little a
[2:00:25] little torch or something the fire that
[2:00:27] God lit was the pillar of Fire come on
[2:00:30] now the pillar of fire had to light the
[2:00:33] thing because it's what God had lit but
[2:00:35] notice what Aaron's sons did oh God the
[2:00:38] Lord give me this yesterday about shout
[2:00:40] it all over my little study amen Aaron's
[2:00:42] sons went in with some strange fire amen
[2:00:45] there they are all the way in the Book
[2:00:47] of Leviticus they've got the original
[2:00:49] fire they a pillar of fire amen but
[2:00:51] they're already trying to bring Strange
[2:00:53] Fire in and they said we'll light these
[2:00:55] lamps with some strange fire and you
[2:00:57] know what God did he slew him at the
[2:00:58] door he would not allow his lamps to be
[2:01:01] Litton which trains fired in Leviticus
[2:01:04] 10 verse 1 and nadab and Abraham the
[2:01:06] sons of Aaron took either of them his
[2:01:08] censure and put fire therein and put
[2:01:10] incense their incense thereon and
[2:01:13] offered a strange fire before the Lord
[2:01:15] which he commanded them not and there
[2:01:18] went out fire from the Lord and devoured
[2:01:20] them and they died before the Lord come
[2:01:23] on Church The Strange Fire amen could
[2:01:26] not come on now it could not withstand
[2:01:28] the pillar of fire and God said you will
[2:01:31] not bring that Strange Fire and light it
[2:01:33] in the house of God look at what this
[2:01:35] word strange means it means of a woman
[2:01:37] strange a prostitute or a harlot in
[2:01:41] Revelation chapter 4 61 if somebody
[2:01:43] started into the holies of holies
[2:01:45] without coming through here he died see
[2:01:48] Aaron's sons took Strange Fire one day
[2:01:51] amen some denominational power when it
[2:01:54] was the nominational fire and they died
[2:01:56] at the door they brought Strange Fire
[2:01:58] which a prophet said was denominational
[2:02:00] power which that word strange was a
[2:02:02] harlot or a prostitute and the Catholic
[2:02:05] church is the mother of every one of
[2:02:07] them Revelation 17 she was a mother of
[2:02:09] harlech and couldn't been Sons they had
[2:02:11] to be daughters so the Protestant
[2:02:13] harmless nominations with her notice
[2:02:15] this the denominational fire could not
[2:02:18] come upon the true fire of God what are
[2:02:21] you saying preacher I'm saying this I
[2:02:22] think it's time that we salute and
[2:02:25] welcome the return of the original Power
[2:02:28] which is the original line back in the
[2:02:30] church which is making you an original
[2:02:32] church with the same sign same Wonder
[2:02:35] same word same power same sensation same
[2:02:37] manifestation act in the same kind of
[2:02:40] way
[2:02:42] those candlesticks or we'll find a
[2:02:44] little later represents this Heaven
[2:02:45] Church ages he says and each one of
[2:02:47] these little candlesticks had a little
[2:02:48] Cruise of all sitting there and this all
[2:02:50] burned on this candle now when one
[2:02:52] candle was lit by the fire of God they'd
[2:02:54] taken that candle and lit another one
[2:02:55] then set it down and it let the other
[2:02:57] one and then it lit one off that one off
[2:03:00] the other one off the other one till the
[2:03:02] last candle same oh
[2:03:05] same off
[2:03:07] same fire he says that burnt the oil
[2:03:10] they're in Ephesus they're in taitara
[2:03:12] they're in pergamus they're in laodicea
[2:03:14] he said the same Holy Spirit
[2:03:17] lit by the same God
[2:03:20] by the same fire
[2:03:22] the fire that fell on Pentecost has lit
[2:03:27] the candle the church through every age
[2:03:29] right on down
[2:03:32] now
[2:03:34] same fire
[2:03:36] same light
[2:03:38] same old
[2:03:40] same Radiance same presence
[2:03:43] same seed same word

[2:04:40] atmospheres are being subdued
[2:04:44] by the presence
[2:04:45] of the Bride of Jesus Christ

[2:04:52] because the glow of Jesus Christ
[2:04:54] foreign

[2:05:22] the star got a hold of a man
[2:05:26] and the radiance of that star reflected
[2:05:28] out of a couple
[2:05:29] and they made a difference where they

[2:05:57] it it affected me he said I should not
[2:06:00] see him again
[2:06:01] what Sean Martin
[2:06:04] it was the light of God
[2:06:06] it was the original fire that returned
[2:06:08] to redeemed flesh

[2:06:34] message

[2:06:38] simplified you got a powerful fall if
[2:06:40] you're preaching this message the devil

[2:06:47] the church

[2:06:54] I believe we're a radiant bride of Jesus
[2:06:57] Christ
[2:06:58] in the life
[2:07:00] of the presence there's a there's a
[2:07:02] heart here
[2:07:04] sister Jane
[2:07:06] you may just feel like you're coming to
[2:07:08] church and getting up here and singing a
[2:07:09] few songs
[2:07:10] but I'm a witness when you got up this
[2:07:12] morning started singing I feel the
[2:07:13] presence in that office down there
[2:07:16] and that's one of my favorite songs
[2:07:18] I sit in concerts and heard people sing
[2:07:20] it and never felt what I heard what I
[2:07:22] felt down there this morning
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:25] she's not on a bus touring around the
[2:07:27] world singing it but she's in the house
[2:07:29] of God
[2:07:30] and there's a Radiance about that lady
[2:07:33] there's a glow around her
[2:07:36] there's something permeating from
[2:07:37] there's there's something coming out of
[2:07:39] her
[2:07:44] and friends I don't believe you're just
[2:07:45] here taking up space
[2:07:47] I believe you're making a difference
[2:07:50] would you stand to your feet with this
[2:07:51] this morning
[2:07:58] I remember one time I was
[2:08:00] over in Phelps Kentucky brother
[2:08:02] Eddie Hurley's telling me a story he
[2:08:04] said he said years ago he said we went
[2:08:06] elk hunting with brother Shrewsbury he
[2:08:09] said we went out in this this place and
[2:08:10] we never stayed here before he said it
[2:08:12] was a cabin he said I didn't know really
[2:08:14] what we was getting into
[2:08:15] he so he went in there he said now
[2:08:17] brother Roy some of y'all probably
[2:08:18] remember hunting brother Roy he said
[2:08:20] back in them days you just went out
[2:08:21] there and all the Believers got together
[2:08:22] and hunted and had a good time he said
[2:08:24] but this time we went and they were
[2:08:25] standing in the cabin I think there were
[2:08:27] some early folks there and brother and
[2:08:28] he said I didn't really know what we was
[2:08:30] getting into when we walked in he said
[2:08:31] we walked in he said he was cussing and
[2:08:33] smoking and drinking he said I thought
[2:08:35] oh dear lord
[2:08:37] what have I got brother Roy into
[2:08:40] he said brother Roy walked in there
[2:08:42] he said him as a man of God
[2:08:44] walked around to every one of those men
[2:08:47] shook their hands and said my name's Roy
[2:08:50] Shrewsbury what's your name
[2:08:52] introduced himself to everyone but her
[2:08:54] then he said but Andrew he said by the
[2:08:56] time he got done he said the whole
[2:08:57] atmosphere was subdued
[2:08:59] he said by the time that week was over
[2:09:01] that man had them guys talking about
[2:09:03] Jesus
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:07] listen it's more than a book
[2:09:09] it's more than a tape
[2:09:12] it's that word
[2:09:14] has found redeemed flesh
[2:09:16] in a bright body
[2:09:18] and is radiating
[2:09:21] the prophets hit those lamps all fit
[2:09:23] into one great big bowl one great big
[2:09:25] holder seven different seven different
[2:09:27] lamp holders come out of it and when
[2:09:29] they did each one of those lights was
[2:09:31] drawing from the main resource of his
[2:09:33] life of its life and his light was
[2:09:35] because it has been a candle dipped down
[2:09:37] in the main Barrel
[2:09:39] he says Oh what a beautiful picture
[2:09:41] of one of those Seven Stars it
[2:09:44] represented that with his life on fire
[2:09:46] with the Holy Ghost he said by faith
[2:09:49] he's burned with the Holy Ghost
[2:09:52] his life is a candle not a candy says
[2:09:55] but a wick that's dipped in the Holy
[2:09:57] Spirit into Christ and through that Wick
[2:09:59] he's drawing the life of God out to give
[2:10:01] Life Light to his church oh what a
[2:10:04] picture of the True Believer
[2:10:07] what kind of a lot
[2:10:09] he's given
[2:10:11] the same kind of light
[2:10:13] that was when the first candle
[2:10:16] was lit

[2:21:09] a few weeks ago I was ministering here
[2:21:11] to you and I I made a statement
[2:21:14] little as much if God is in it
[2:21:17] and I said there may not be
[2:21:19] many members or a lot of people
[2:21:22] but if God gets in the church little is
[2:21:24] much in it
[2:21:26] I stood on that the other day sister
[2:21:27] Jane I got to ponder in that thought
[2:21:30] and you know the Bible says that Jesus
[2:21:32] took five fish
[2:21:34] and two loaves of bread
[2:21:36] and fed five thousand
[2:21:38] plus their wives
[2:21:40] and their children so we'll say he fed
[2:21:43] maybe fifteen twenty thousand
[2:21:45] with Five Loaves and two fish
[2:21:50] I got to thinking about that
[2:21:52] the Mighty God
[2:21:54] into
[2:21:55] Five Loaves two fish
[2:21:58] fed about 20 000 people
[2:22:01] one God gets in one believer and can
[2:22:05] defeat two hundred thousand thousand
[2:22:06] devils
[2:22:07] [Music]

[2:23:34] Lord be glorified
[2:23:39] today
[2:23:41] amen I counted an honor that God would
[2:23:45] choose me
[2:23:49] a man to be his body
[2:23:53] Amen in this age
[2:23:55] and I know you feel the same way and
[2:23:58] it's more than just words to be said but
[2:24:01] it's it's it's so true
[2:24:04] and we may not be noticed by the world
[2:24:07] and have you know Prestige and
[2:24:11] a name that the world recognizes but I
[2:24:15] think it's an honor that God would
[2:24:17] recognize her name
[2:24:19] and that he would know us and he would
[2:24:21] establish our name
[2:24:23] not just here on Earth but in heaven
[2:24:26] amen and we are a people that even I
[2:24:30] believe the angels of God are in all
[2:24:32] about
[2:24:33] amen that they they because we are the
[2:24:36] unfolding of God's mystery
[2:24:39] being made known and and so to
[2:24:44] to to see that God's body is taking
[2:24:47] shape on this Earth
[2:24:49] and that the fullness of God manifesting
[2:24:52] in his church
[2:24:53] amen
[2:24:54] I no wonder the devil hates us and they
[2:24:58] were doing everything he can to destroy
[2:25:01] destroy us but he'll never be able to do
[2:25:04] it amen and
[2:25:07] God you know and and I don't say this
[2:25:11] arrogantly but God must be proud
[2:25:14] that he's got a people that he can
[2:25:16] finally have preeminent sin
[2:25:19] soul body Spirit a man that he redeemed
[2:25:23] and as the prophet said we are his
[2:25:26] victory
[2:25:27] amen we are proof that he didn't die in
[2:25:29] vain
[2:25:31] I'm just we just not as the Pentecostals
[2:25:34] went after gifts

[2:30:28] brother Mike old Teague from Brother
[2:30:31] William his son-in-law
[2:30:34] said the nausea is a little better today
[2:30:37] after switching meds but he still can't
[2:30:40] eat
[2:30:41] says uh pray that they can get the
[2:30:45] nausea lesson so he can eat and they
[2:30:47] won't have to put feeding tube in his
[2:30:49] nose
[2:30:50] the inazia is because of the blood on
[2:30:53] the brain which is the same
[2:30:56] term as brain bleed
[2:30:59] said the last scan of the brain bleed
[2:31:03] last night showed an increase
[2:31:06] from five to eight thus the reason for
[2:31:09] increased nausea yesterday so they will
[2:31:13] continue to keep a close monitor of
[2:31:15] brain bleed they will scan the heart
[2:31:17] this afternoon to check on the aneurysm
[2:31:21] and also looking for any other possible
[2:31:24] trauma to the heart
[2:31:26] so he's got a he's got an aneurysm that
[2:31:30] the doctor didn't
[2:31:32] apparently didn't tell them about until
[2:31:34] this this time
[2:31:36] and so if it if it if if that bird
