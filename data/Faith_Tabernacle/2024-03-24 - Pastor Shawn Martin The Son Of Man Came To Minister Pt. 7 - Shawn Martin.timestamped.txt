[53:52] Amen in their future ahead amen and uh
[53:56] you love the Lord amen if you have your
[53:59] Bibles we're going to turn to the Book
[54:00] of Matthew the 20th
[54:05] chapter
[54:06] amen and uh Easter be next
[54:10] Sunday and uh so we'll be just having
[54:13] one service then and um and so uh but
[54:18] looking forward to the the service there
[54:21] and also um we've said it before but uh
[54:25] April 7th we will be setting up the tent
[54:29] and uh so any of you brothers that would
[54:31] like to be a part of that and help we
[54:34] would appreciate that and uh but most of
[54:37] all we ask that you pray for the meeting
[54:40] and um this could be our last time that
[54:43] we gather uh like this and uh but my my
[54:48] prayer has always been that God would
[54:50] just meet us in a in a special way that
[54:53] people can be touched and blessed and
[54:57] that they could uh their hearts would be
[54:59] solidified around the message of the
[55:01] hour and um I believe that the the
[55:06] brothers that uh are ministering they
[55:08] they love the message and um I've always
[55:12] felt that when the meetings were over
[55:15] that the message was clearly preached
[55:18] and um that the people would know uh be
[55:22] more encouraged amen uh uh uh to to get
[55:27] closer to God and to get more into the
[55:30] message and brother brandham he he says
[55:33] this uh uh brother Andrew had sent it to
[55:35] me this morning but and I thought it was
[55:37] good he says I'll say tonight that a
[55:40] good oldfashioned Holy Ghost tent
[55:42] meeting is more to protect us than all
[55:45] the atomic bombs that we could create in
[55:48] a million years and I thought wow oh God
[55:52] let it be a holy ghost meeting amen and
[55:55] that's really what we want want there's
[55:56] a lot of effort that goes into this
[55:58] meeting but more than anything we want
[56:01] our efforts to be in prayer and and
[56:04] praying and and everything that God
[56:08] would feel at home and feel welcome to
[56:11] move Among Us amen but Matthew the uh
[56:15] 20th chapter we've been reading this um
[56:19] as our opening scripture for a few
[56:21] Sundays but uh Matthew 20 and 20 we're
[56:26] going to just start there then came to
[56:28] him the mother of zebedee's children
[56:31] with her sons worshiping him and
[56:34] Desiring a certain thing of him and he
[56:37] said unto her what Willl thou she saith
[56:40] unto him grant that these my two sons
[56:43] May sit the one on thy right hand and
[56:46] the other on the left and in thy kingdom
[56:49] but Jesus answered and said you know not
[56:51] what you ask are you able to drink of
[56:54] the cup that I shall drink of and to be
[56:57] baptized with the baptism that I am
[56:59] baptized with they say unto him we are
[57:03] able and he saith unto them you shall
[57:06] drink indeed of my cup and be baptized
[57:09] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[57:12] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[57:14] left is not mine to give but it shall be
[57:17] given to them for whom it is prepared of
[57:20] my father and when the 10 heard it they
[57:23] were moved with indignation against the
[57:26] two Brethren but Jesus called unto them
[57:29] unto him and uh said you know that the
[57:35] uh princes of the Gentiles exercise
[57:37] dominion over them and they that are
[57:41] great exercise Authority upon them but
[57:44] it shall not be so among you but
[57:46] whosoever will be great among you let
[57:49] him be your minister and whosoever will
[57:52] be Chief among you let him be your
[57:54] servant even as the Son of Man Came not
[57:57] to be ministered unto but to minister
[57:59] and to give his life a ransom for many
[58:03] amen then if you could turn with me to
[58:06] First Timothy the 4th
[58:12] chapter
[58:17] amen 1 Timothy the 4th chapter and um
[58:21] we'll read the the 12th
[58:25] verse
[58:27] let no man despise thy
[58:30] youth but be thou an example of the
[58:32] Believers yes in word in conversation in
[58:38] charity in spirit in faith in
[58:43] Purity till I come give attendance to
[58:45] reading to exhortation to
[58:48] Doctrine neglect not the
[58:51] gift that is in
[58:54] thee amen let's just bow our heads in
[58:58] prayer Lord
[59:00] Jesus we have gathered together this
[59:04] morning with the desire Lord to meet
[59:07] with
[59:08] you father to worship you and we believe
[59:13] that the songs have
[59:15] been done from the Heart Lord said and
[59:19] sung and the music played From The
[59:23] Heart Lord I pray father that you find
[59:26] it pleasing to you Lord and that you
[59:28] would feel welcome now to come and feel
[59:31] at home that you would Minister to us
[59:35] now through the word I pray that you
[59:38] would anoint both the speaker and the
[59:41] hearer help me just to get myself out of
[59:44] the way father Lord that when we leave
[59:46] this place we'd know that we' been with
[59:48] you father let it more be more than just
[59:51] words that are said but let the
[59:53] anointing come and father that you would
[59:56] manifest yourself in the Supernatural
[59:58] realm oh God that's our desire draw us
[1:00:02] closer to you may the sick be healed
[1:00:05] today those that are in needy and and
[1:00:09] discouraged or whatever it would be
[1:00:11] father may they find what they're asking
[1:00:13] and needing father we ask it in Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ's name and the church
[1:00:19] says amen and amen you can have your
[1:00:22] seats this
[1:00:24] morning and I want to
[1:00:28] continue with the thought the son of man
[1:00:31] came to
[1:00:33] minister and
[1:00:36] um but why why is Ministry important
[1:00:40] because we find that
[1:00:42] Ministry is is for us uh as well not
[1:00:46] just for
[1:00:48] him uh when he walk the earth but also
[1:00:51] for
[1:00:52] us and I guess the the simple and
[1:00:56] quick answer would be for the Lost Souls
[1:00:59] of
[1:01:00] man he come to
[1:01:02] minister uh Luke 19 and10 it says the
[1:01:06] son of man is come to seek and to save
[1:01:10] that which was
[1:01:11] lost so that was his purpose he come to
[1:01:15] redeem he come to save he come to
[1:01:18] deliver he come to heal he come to you
[1:01:22] know um so so uh the prophet
[1:01:26] uh comes and he and he puts a value upon
[1:01:30] the soul of a man and he says that one
[1:01:32] soul is worth 10,000 worlds you see it's
[1:01:36] it's it's because that God is interested
[1:01:39] in man he's interested in the soul of
[1:01:42] man so brother brandom says when you're
[1:01:44] born into that kingdom of God then the
[1:01:46] life the very life that was in Jesus see
[1:01:49] that's what it means to be born into the
[1:01:51] kingdom of God you have the very life
[1:01:54] that was in Christ he says then you're
[1:01:57] interested in Souls you're interested
[1:02:01] amen it's more than just interested in
[1:02:04] their their bank account and making sure
[1:02:07] that they're they have it set in life
[1:02:10] and and that they have materialistic
[1:02:12] things but you're interested in their
[1:02:15] soul and and so uh you know it's it's
[1:02:19] the people that are truly born again
[1:02:21] that you don't have to beg uh uh though
[1:02:25] the to come uh to the altar to help
[1:02:30] those uh that are in need to to pray
[1:02:34] through there there's just something
[1:02:36] brother Braham said these things just
[1:02:38] automatically flow amen it just
[1:02:41] automatically Wells up within you he
[1:02:43] said because it's it's be because it's
[1:02:46] sealed up in you you are a unit of God
[1:02:50] you are sealed with the Holy Ghost so I
[1:02:53] I I think that's that's uh uh you are a
[1:02:56] unit with God you are one with God you
[1:02:59] there's something that now his life is
[1:03:03] in you his passion is in you his goals
[1:03:06] his purpose is in you uh whatever he was
[1:03:10] whatever he started out here we are
[1:03:13] today and he's finishing up his work in
[1:03:16] US amen see and so we look in the
[1:03:20] ministry as he came to minister it was
[1:03:23] when he was here on Earth that Jesus
[1:03:25] when went out of his way uh uh to go to
[1:03:29] to one man and that was the man that was
[1:03:32] in gatera and he says he went over to
[1:03:36] gatera to help a maniac over there that
[1:03:39] was bound in the tombs crossed over a
[1:03:41] stormy sea to help one man in trouble
[1:03:45] because one Soul was calling for him
[1:03:49] amen One Soul was calling for him and he
[1:03:52] said it was his love for one needy soul
[1:03:55] 180 Soul amen and so then if he is the
[1:03:59] same yesterday today and forever which
[1:04:01] this scripture Hebrews 138 has been so
[1:04:04] solidified in our hearts amen uh uh
[1:04:08] through the message of the hour that he
[1:04:10] is the same yesterday to today and
[1:04:12] forever he can still heal he can still
[1:04:14] save he can he can still deliver he can
[1:04:17] still uh uh raise the dead he can still
[1:04:21] open the blinded eyes but all of that
[1:04:24] and we believe that that but he's still
[1:04:26] the same in his passion he's still the
[1:04:29] same in his love he's still the same in
[1:04:32] his desire he's still willing to go a
[1:04:35] man uh beyond the reaches of of humanity
[1:04:38] to save one's Soul he's still willing to
[1:04:41] go out of his way to reach that one Soul
[1:04:45] it's because his love not our love his
[1:04:47] love is for that one needy Soul ain't
[1:04:50] that right so if he is the same
[1:04:53] yesterday today and forever the prophet
[1:04:55] said then will come out of Glory today
[1:04:58] with his power to help one single person
[1:05:00] of this Earth amen if he sent the
[1:05:03] prophet amen if it was just for one Soul
[1:05:06] he would still send a prophet he would
[1:05:07] still open the seals he would still do
[1:05:10] everything he can for that one Soul
[1:05:14] ain't that right amen see he would come
[1:05:17] from Glory this afternoon to set any of
[1:05:19] you free that's right he will come down
[1:05:22] through every church and every critic
[1:05:24] and everything else and every fanatic
[1:05:27] and everything else to you to heal you
[1:05:30] this afternoon to make you right ain't
[1:05:32] that right I thought of brother brandham
[1:05:35] and and such the ministry that he had
[1:05:37] and and and and we all know that it was
[1:05:39] the ministry of Jesus Christ but you
[1:05:41] cannot have the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:05:44] without having the Divine love that
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ had and the passion that
[1:05:49] Jesus Christ had and and so here he was
[1:05:52] he says I wouldn't be any more sincere
[1:05:55] with 5 thou 500,000 that I would be with
[1:05:59] five people because one soul is value to
[1:06:03] God as 10,000 worlds and this is why
[1:06:06] brother brandham could hold house
[1:06:08] meetings and he didn't make it a
[1:06:10] criteria that there had to be so many
[1:06:12] people before he would come to a to to a
[1:06:15] town he he didn't make it a criteria
[1:06:17] that he had to have so much money a
[1:06:20] certain amount of money in order for him
[1:06:22] to come amen because he had the same
[1:06:25] pass that Jesus had and whether it was
[1:06:28] to one soul out in the woods or whether
[1:06:30] it was to a 100,000 people and in a
[1:06:33] Coliseum it it didn't matter to him one
[1:06:37] Soul was worth 10,000
[1:06:40] worlds he said wherever the Lord sends
[1:06:43] the church never gets too little
[1:06:45] whatever it is but what wherever there's
[1:06:48] a needy soul I want to lead it if it's
[1:06:52] just one soul to the Lord Jesus I think
[1:06:55] sometimes we get our dreams too big the
[1:06:58] ministers can be the same way that if
[1:07:00] we're not operating full-time in the
[1:07:02] ministry if we're not if we're not
[1:07:05] preaching to Big crowds and if we're not
[1:07:07] this or that or whatever and we set our
[1:07:09] own criteria for how our ministry can
[1:07:12] work amen but that's not the way it
[1:07:14] should be we should be willing to get
[1:07:16] out on the streets we should be willing
[1:07:18] to talk to people on the at a restaurant
[1:07:20] or or or or wherever if if to tell
[1:07:24] people about god brother Ram said you
[1:07:27] Housewives he said you don't have to be
[1:07:29] a preacher you do something for the
[1:07:31] glory of God remember Eternal things is
[1:07:34] what lasts forever and that's getting so
[1:07:37] saved let that be the first thing of all
[1:07:41] your work all your ideas and all your
[1:07:45] motives can you say Amen you say well I
[1:07:48] I I just wished I could go out and do
[1:07:50] other things I wished I could be
[1:07:52] whatever I thought about even sister MAA
[1:07:54] and how that you know brother brandom
[1:07:56] hung around a lot of ministers and and
[1:07:58] their wives always wanted to be with
[1:08:00] them and and in the in the Limelight or
[1:08:03] or whatever but sister ma wasn't in the
[1:08:05] Limelight and it looked like she wasn't
[1:08:07] doing much at all but you know brother
[1:08:09] Brandon says that every time she ironed
[1:08:10] my clothes she's praying for praying
[1:08:13] praying uh uh for my meetings and and
[1:08:16] and you know Sister Rebecca um uh uh
[1:08:20] asked her one time said mom says you
[1:08:22] know I wish I could said I I wish I
[1:08:25] could love to do ironing and stuff the
[1:08:27] way you you do say you just must love it
[1:08:29] and she said no I hate it and and and
[1:08:32] these things and but she said you know
[1:08:34] she says uh I I felt like I wasn't
[1:08:36] really doing much and this is all
[1:08:38] paraphrasing but she I just felt like I
[1:08:39] wasn't doing much and and these things
[1:08:41] that didn't it just come to me you know
[1:08:43] that I could be praying every time I
[1:08:45] iron them clothes uh uh I I could be
[1:08:48] praying I could be praying for my
[1:08:49] husband I could be praying for my
[1:08:51] children I could be you understand what
[1:08:53] I'm saying so see she began a Ministry
[1:08:56] she realized that she had a Ministry
[1:08:58] amen it wasn't maybe to preach like her
[1:09:00] husband and and stand before the
[1:09:03] thousands and to have recognition as he
[1:09:05] did but she realized that she did have a
[1:09:08] place in this and brother Brandon
[1:09:10] recognized it as well can you say Amen
[1:09:13] you see a lost soul is the only thing
[1:09:16] that has value in it money passes away
[1:09:20] houses pass away lands uh everything
[1:09:23] changes and you know good and well
[1:09:24] everything that you've worked for the
[1:09:26] government can take it just away from
[1:09:27] you and we'll take it away from you and
[1:09:30] and and and they they don't care as as
[1:09:33] we know but you see but homes will even
[1:09:36] Decay cars will even Decay everything's
[1:09:38] going to Decay everything's going to
[1:09:41] change and and one of these days we're
[1:09:43] all going to have to give up the ghost
[1:09:44] ain't that right if we live long enough
[1:09:47] right and and so uh uh but everything in
[1:09:50] this Earth moves away amen but brother
[1:09:53] Bram says I'd rather have one so in
[1:09:55] glory that I want to Christ to know and
[1:09:59] see that that light of God circles
[1:10:01] around that Soul through all eternity my
[1:10:04] name to be associated with that than to
[1:10:07] have every penny of money in the whole
[1:10:09] earth cuz I lose all of that I I'd have
[1:10:12] to lose it all see but what you send up
[1:10:16] there is
[1:10:17] eternal are you with me Church what what
[1:10:20] so you send there is eternal see and
[1:10:25] that's the reason we're trying amen
[1:10:28] that's the reason brother Brandon would
[1:10:29] press past the tiredness and the
[1:10:31] discouragements and the and the
[1:10:33] rejection and knowing that the the
[1:10:36] ministers behind him didn't agree with
[1:10:38] him and knowing half the most of the the
[1:10:41] people that was out there amen was was
[1:10:44] uh didn't understand his ministry but he
[1:10:46] kept trying amen he never stopped and I
[1:10:49] say Church don't quit trying ministers
[1:10:52] don't quit trying parents don't quit
[1:10:54] trying whatever your ministry is don't
[1:10:57] quit
[1:10:59] trying amen we must
[1:11:02] not brother brand said we should pray to
[1:11:05] God to give us a passion for lost souls
[1:11:07] till Jesus
[1:11:08] comes can you say amen amen he says
[1:11:12] anybody will donate to a healing service
[1:11:15] they'll donate to a song festival but
[1:11:18] when it comes to a poor lost soul they
[1:11:20] ain't got nothing to do with that on see
[1:11:23] now isn't that about right he says got
[1:11:25] everything see to a a poor lost soul
[1:11:28] don't want nothing to do with that
[1:11:30] they'll let him grow out into anything
[1:11:32] and they'll say well that's all right he
[1:11:34] belongs to church it won't hurt anything
[1:11:37] do you see why we're not just satisfied
[1:11:39] with taking people to church we're not
[1:11:43] just satisfied amen tell them well you
[1:11:46] can go to the church down here and you
[1:11:47] can go when we know good and well that
[1:11:49] they're going to send they ain't going
[1:11:51] you know I mean come on now most
[1:11:53] churches around here ain't got the uh
[1:11:55] denominations or whatever in the world
[1:11:58] ain't got what it takes to get people in
[1:12:00] a Rapture yeah that's right it's just
[1:12:02] the truth see so so we as as Believers
[1:12:07] amen we are to be about the father's
[1:12:10] business and the prophet said his
[1:12:13] business is saving lost souls can you
[1:12:16] say that with me his business is saving
[1:12:18] lost souls and we are to be about the
[1:12:22] father's business now that's adoption

[1:12:32] that son a man that is trying to be
[1:12:35] tutored and yet he's not interested in
[1:12:37] the father's business he's not
[1:12:38] interested in what the tutor has to say
[1:12:41] we're talking about Sons and Daughters
[1:12:43] of God that has come to adoption because
[1:12:46] they're they're they're they're
[1:12:48] interested in the father's
[1:12:50] business can you say Amen now why is the
[1:12:53] soul of man valuable you know surely
[1:12:57] there is a point in getting so saved and
[1:13:01] and you know uh uh brother Bram said the
[1:13:04] most important thing in the world is
[1:13:07] God's
[1:13:08] church God made the Earth he made it for
[1:13:11] a
[1:13:13] purpose why to take a church out of it

[1:13:32] of God is

[1:15:12] Church of God and and rock concerts in
[1:15:15] the house of God and and and and the

[1:15:25] you understand you understand what I'm
[1:15:27] saying right amen they're more
[1:15:29] interested in finding answers out in the
[1:15:30] world for their young people than they
[1:15:32] are of God cuz they don't see the answer
[1:15:34] in the Church of God anymore they don't

[1:15:38] their children and save them from a life
[1:15:41] of sin and and and and demise and all of
[1:15:44] these things so they look out there for
[1:15:46] their answers Amen to keep their chur
[1:15:48] you don't have to go to sports to keep
[1:15:50] your children in church you don't have

[1:16:07] they'll know that God can save that God
[1:16:10] can heal that God can do whatever amen
[1:16:13] see and it puts a drive in
[1:16:16] youen amen that's right see we realize
[1:16:20] more and more and more and we should
[1:16:22] every day that people that are going to
[1:16:24] be Left
[1:16:28] Behind it's it's it's going to be so
[1:16:31] horrible for
[1:16:32] them it's um brother Bram even you know
[1:16:37] brother Bram even tried to tell us how
[1:16:39] how bad it's going to get oh
[1:16:44] and you know in one place he said let me
[1:16:47] you know let let me be flate alive right
[1:16:50] let me be let me be chopped inch by inch
[1:16:53] let let him put sulfuric acid in my
[1:16:57] stomach you know let let and he's trying
[1:16:59] to describe the whr and he says let let
[1:17:02] all this be done you know to me but
[1:17:06] don't let me stand before that white
[1:17:08] Throne
[1:17:09] judgment and and and everyone that don't
[1:17:12] go on the Rapture is going to stand
[1:17:13] before that white throat in judgment you
[1:17:15] understand that right see it it's it's
[1:17:17] people are losing their minds which and
[1:17:20] here a prophet years ago told us that
[1:17:22] men would go completely insane to where
[1:17:24] they see a bird with with a a wingspan
[1:17:27] of what six blocks long or something
[1:17:30] like that and they'd see M ants rise up
[1:17:33] and he said it's not going to be literal
[1:17:35] it's all going to be in the mind and
[1:17:36] we're seeing Insanity like never before
[1:17:40] amen how many people that we talk to and
[1:17:42] young people that we talk to and and
[1:17:44] they just and and and they're seeing
[1:17:46] people in the rooms and and they're
[1:17:48] seeing things in the room amen what's
[1:17:50] happened their mental faculty is leaving
[1:17:53] them so so is is now what the prophet
[1:17:56] has been saying is coming to pass and
[1:17:59] most churches don't know what the
[1:18:01] problem is but we stand here with the
[1:18:02] message of the hour we know the trouble
[1:18:05] is we know what's coming we know can you
[1:18:08] say Amen you know what that ought to do
[1:18:10] to us it ought to put us in Earnest
[1:18:12] desire it should be put us in Earnest
[1:18:14] desperation to reach one Soul amen just
[1:18:17] one Soul can you say amen amen if we can
[1:18:20] take them with us amen I I'm glad that
[1:18:23] we're going in a rap I I'm glad that
[1:18:26] that we have that confidence we should
[1:18:28] have that confidence that that if God
[1:18:30] comes tonight we're leaving amen if the
[1:18:33] Rapture comes we're going ain't that
[1:18:35] right but we should want to take
[1:18:37] somebody with us don't let us get ease
[1:18:40] and
[1:18:43] Zing can you say Amen the Lord that's
[1:18:46] right see now we know that this is the
[1:18:49] evening time where God is requiring the
[1:18:52] token amen just as it was in the first
[1:18:54] Exodus God says when I see the blood
[1:18:57] I'll pass over you ain't that right and
[1:19:01] so the blood was the token at that time
[1:19:04] the literal blood of the lamb and it had
[1:19:07] to be applied over the doorpost of the
[1:19:09] house ain't that right had to be on
[1:19:12] display publicly and then the whole
[1:19:15] family had to be in the house can't be
[1:19:18] at Walmart can't be you know can't be at
[1:19:21] the movie house it it it it can't be
[1:19:23] just out playing around
[1:19:25] amen this is a serious moment you got to
[1:19:28] come in the house I guarantee you daddy
[1:19:31] wasn't just over pacified pass just a
[1:19:33] pacifist on that day I I guarantee he
[1:19:36] said look Junior you're coming in Oh
[1:19:39] Daddy but you don't understand I I I got
[1:19:41] friends I don't care what you got you're
[1:19:42] coming in you're going to stay in this
[1:19:44] house can you say Amen well well Daddy
[1:19:46] what are you going to do I'm staying in
[1:19:48] the house with you I'll be that first
[1:19:49] example I ain't going to work today I
[1:19:51] ain't doing this today I ain't doing
[1:19:53] that today amen but you you don't I just
[1:19:55] want a good old hamburger from Hardies I
[1:19:57] don't care what you want we're staying
[1:19:59] at this house amen because a token is
[1:20:02] applied there it ain't applied somewhere
[1:20:04] else amen Daddy's applied this for you
[1:20:06] son amen Daddy's applied it for this
[1:20:09] family amen and the prophet said the
[1:20:11] entire family had to be there and all
[1:20:15] the all outside the token amen he said
[1:20:18] the whole family had to be in the house
[1:20:19] where the token was displayed amen and
[1:20:22] all outside the token of the blood
[1:20:25] perished can you say man everyone
[1:20:27] outside that blood outside that token
[1:20:30] perished ain't that right amen it's just
[1:20:33] the same as it was in the days of Noah
[1:20:35] amen that God would send a prophet amen
[1:20:38] and it was Grace to that generation that
[1:20:41] God would send them a prophet it's Grace
[1:20:43] if you want to know the grace of God
[1:20:45] Amen just to think that God would send a
[1:20:48] prophet in this age and would lead you
[1:20:50] to be able to hear that prophet and to
[1:20:52] believe that Prophet that's great
[1:20:55] can you say man this world has seen
[1:20:57] Grace if they've ever seen a mercy seat
[1:21:00] they've seen it in this age Grace has
[1:21:03] come to us and it was Grace that God
[1:21:05] would send a prophet in that day amen
[1:21:08] because there was an elect amen that he
[1:21:10] had to reach there was an elect that had
[1:21:13] to be saved amen God could have just let
[1:21:15] them all go but God was rich in Mercy
[1:21:18] ain't that right so God had that Prophet
[1:21:20] preach a message he had him provide an
[1:21:23] ark and is that right there was only one
[1:21:26] door to that Ark the prophet stood at
[1:21:28] that door amen showing that there
[1:21:30] denominations ain't got don't know where
[1:21:32] that door is amen they can run they can
[1:21:35] shout Pentecostals don't know where that
[1:21:37] door is they can prophesy speaking
[1:21:39] tongues get emotional amen and all but
[1:21:42] that they don't even know where the
[1:21:43] power of God is Jesus said I am that
[1:21:46] door I am that door can you say amen and
[1:21:49] there was a prophet standing at that
[1:21:52] door in this age pointing to Christ
[1:21:56] revealing the door to us and we found
[1:21:59] out it's more than a sensation we found
[1:22:01] out it's more than just running all over
[1:22:03] the place we find out it's more than
[1:22:06] just whatever there is a power connected
[1:22:09] to this
[1:22:13] message God praise God but all had to
[1:22:16] get in the
[1:22:17] ark anyone that want to be saved had to
[1:22:19] get in that Ark it didn't matter amen
[1:22:23] they had to get in the ark that's right
[1:22:25] can you say amen amen all outside the
[1:22:28] ark perished amen and the prophet said
[1:22:30] all outside of the token of the Holy
[1:22:32] Spirit today is going to perish all
[1:22:36] outside so we know what the token is
[1:22:38] ain't that right he said no matter how
[1:22:40] good and how much church members there
[1:22:43] was a lot of them in the days of Noah
[1:22:45] there was a lot of them in the days of
[1:22:46] Moses but a man that failed to apply the
[1:22:49] blood as the token he perished and those
[1:22:53] who failed to go in the ark perished and
[1:22:57] those who failed to come into Christ
[1:22:59] today for he is the ark is going to
[1:23:02] perish can you say amen amen that's why
[1:23:05] we cannot get passive about this message
[1:23:07] that's why we must not be ashamed to
[1:23:10] tell people of what God has done in this
[1:23:13] day amen there's people out there that
[1:23:15] has questions and we have the
[1:23:21] answers you believe it
[1:23:25] yes
[1:23:26] sir I believe it's in 1 Corinthians it
[1:23:29] says by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:23:32] into one body am not baptized into a
[1:23:35] denomination that's not baptized into a
[1:23:38] club or a social group amen we're
[1:23:43] baptized into the
[1:23:45] body amen the mystical body Hallelujah
[1:23:49] and it's a spirit baptism
[1:23:52] immersed by the spirit
[1:23:56] yes amen Prophet said then the token is
[1:23:59] on the door glory for you are in
[1:24:02] Christ and he W he was the one your
[1:24:06] sacrifice who stood the
[1:24:08] judgment and when God looks upon that he
[1:24:10] can't do a thing about
[1:24:12] it you think of that the
[1:24:15] blood if I could say it this way the
[1:24:18] blood
[1:24:19] neutralizes
[1:24:21] death it paralyzes the effects of death
[1:24:24] that's right God can't do nothing about
[1:24:26] it you're under a token can you say amen
[1:24:30] he says you're just as safe as you can
[1:24:33] be because God in Christ is the
[1:24:34] self-same person and the spirit has been
[1:24:37] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and there
[1:24:39] is god with his own self and you God
[1:24:42] with his own self and you in his own
[1:24:46] children into the body there you are not
[1:24:49] a chemical but the spirit I will pass
[1:24:52] over you so again as we know you've
[1:24:54] heard the token it's not a chemical
[1:24:57] blood anymore it's the literal life of
[1:25:00] Jesus Christ inside that believer it
[1:25:03] must be in us can you say amen amen see
[1:25:07] and so the prophet would say in the
[1:25:08] first Exodus he said they they they came
[1:25:11] all over from around the Egypt from all
[1:25:13] over Egypt the Israel was scattered all
[1:25:17] over Egypt that nation and he says they
[1:25:19] began to come over all gathered into one
[1:25:22] place in Goan see so so they could be
[1:25:24] under this token he says see they come
[1:25:27] he says and they have come from
[1:25:29] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[1:25:33] Pentecostals and everything else to get
[1:25:35] under the token oh aren't you glad for
[1:25:37] that amen if if you if you want to know
[1:25:40] why we we've come out of Pentecostals
[1:25:43] and why we've come out of all the
[1:25:45] Baptist and denominations and and why we
[1:25:48] we we you young people that been raised
[1:25:50] in the message and and and why we don't
[1:25:52] teach these things anymore is because
[1:25:55] we've gathered under a token we we we
[1:25:58] know the seriousness of this thing amen
[1:26:00] we know the hour that we're living in
[1:26:03] can you say amen he says see we come
[1:26:06] we've gathered from all these
[1:26:07] denominations we come out of all of this
[1:26:10] amen together under a token like it was
[1:26:13] back then it was a pillar of fire that
[1:26:16] Pillar of Fire that's why there ain't no
[1:26:18] church amen uh uh well well you know uh
[1:26:23] I'll say it this way a church is a
[1:26:24] Fitting Place for that amen see it lets
[1:26:27] us know that there has been a pillar of
[1:26:29] fire amen we're not following man like
[1:26:32] David uh uh uh uh uh from Waco and and
[1:26:36] Jim Jones and and and all these things
[1:26:39] there has been a few Pillar of Fire that
[1:26:42] has identified this message like it did
[1:26:46] Moses message can you say amen amen and
[1:26:50] and that was a natural people that come
[1:26:52] out going to a natural land but they
[1:26:55] gathered under the same Pillar of Fire
[1:26:58] amen that we are the people that they
[1:27:01] represented they were the type we are
[1:27:04] the we are the substance can you say
[1:27:07] Amen yes sir it was a pillar of fire was
[1:27:10] represented there now notice and one
[1:27:13] told the other and another one told
[1:27:15] another and another one told another and
[1:27:18] the first thing you know here they all
[1:27:21] begin to come aren't you glad there's
[1:27:23] people that still tell about the message
[1:27:24] of the hour there's somebody that's got

[1:27:55] amen It's the End of Time It's the End
[1:27:58] of the World System amen and there's
[1:28:00] only one way to get out of this thing

[1:28:06] token you should never be ashamed of
[1:28:09] that Pillar of Fire oh yeah but we're
[1:28:11] afraid that they're going to worship the
[1:28:12] man if you've got enough experience your
[1:28:15] experience ought to tell them you're not
[1:28:16] worshiping a
[1:28:21] man can you say Amen
[1:28:24] they began to come and they watched the
[1:28:26] sign of God and they said judgment is at
[1:28:30] hand the church we know that this is the
[1:28:33] age of personal life of Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ Prophet said it right down
[1:28:39] through the age they had dip a dip of
[1:28:42] the Holy Ghost portion Luther had a dip
[1:28:47] of the Holy Ghost Wesley had a greater
[1:28:50] dip Pentecost St had a greater dip than
[1:28:53] that of the Holy Ghost he says now see
[1:28:56] he says see now the church has got to a
[1:28:58] place from Luther Wesley and the Revival
[1:29:01] is on to Pentecost and now everybody say
[1:29:05] and now don't you stop at a Pentecostal
[1:29:08] age amen you get preachers that trying
[1:29:10] to stop keep you at a Pentecostal age
[1:29:12] get away from that can you say
[1:29:15] amen amen it's token
[1:29:20] time so now into this age that we're
[1:29:22] coming now we're now coming who you you
[1:29:26] didn't come out of Baptist get into a
[1:29:28] Pentecostal
[1:29:30] mess
[1:29:32] amen you didn't come out of a
[1:29:35] Pentecostal mess for some message
[1:29:36] preacher to take you back that's
[1:29:40] [Music]
[1:29:43] right now into this age that we're
[1:29:46] coming now by the same Holy Spirit just
[1:29:48] more of it and then and when them
[1:29:52] Lutheran back there got saved they got a
[1:29:54] portion of the Holy Spirit when the
[1:29:56] Methodist got Sanctified that was the
[1:29:58] work of the Holy Spirit see it was a
[1:30:01] part of the Holy Spirit see they without
[1:30:04] us are not made perfect hello they
[1:30:08] without us are not made
[1:30:12] perfect that's right yes sir see now God
[1:30:16] as the light has begin to shine in the
[1:30:18] last days he is expecting us see a great
[1:30:22] thing from us
[1:30:24] yes sir amen don't just be satisfied
[1:30:27] with the Lutheran don't be satisfied
[1:30:28] with your Pentecost he's he's expecting
[1:30:32] a great thing from us see see because
[1:30:35] where there is much given there is much
[1:30:38] required so he is going to require much
[1:30:41] more of us in this age see than he did
[1:30:45] of the Lutheran or the methodists
[1:30:47] because we walk in a greater light with
[1:30:49] a greater power with a greater witness
[1:30:53] than what they have
[1:30:54] now we have a greater witness of the
[1:30:57] Resurrection we have things more firmer
[1:31:01] more sure more solidified than what they
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:08] had you realize that this is the age
[1:31:10] that Jesus Christ has done more than
[1:31:12] what he ever done in his when he walked
[1:31:15] on the earth that's right he didn't do
[1:31:16] that in Luther didn't do it in Wesley or
[1:31:18] Pentecost he done it in this age
[1:31:20] amen amen can you say Amen
[1:31:24] that's right amen he sure did amen amen
[1:31:29] see so it's just like in the Old
[1:31:31] Testament see the prophets had their
[1:31:33] part of the word for their age they had
[1:31:35] part they had a portion and and these
[1:31:37] things but all the time it was getting
[1:31:39] closer and closer and closer and closer
[1:31:42] but they had a each one had a portion
[1:31:43] for their day but then Jesus came who
[1:31:47] was the fullness of the word he was the
[1:31:50] fullness hello amen amen that's right so
[1:31:55] the prophet said see he was the word
[1:31:57] itself he was all the prophets were plus
[1:32:01] the rest of
[1:32:03] God he was all that the prophets were
[1:32:06] plus the rest of
[1:32:09] God is that not where we're
[1:32:13] at this is the only time that the
[1:32:16] evening time there's been required God
[1:32:19] has required a
[1:32:21] token amen amen can you say Amen the
[1:32:25] fullness of God the fullness of his life
[1:32:30] in
[1:32:33] us all that they were all that the
[1:32:36] Lutheran were all that the the the
[1:32:38] Pentecostals were and the wesle were
[1:32:41] plus the rest of
[1:32:45] godl all that God was he poured into
[1:32:47] Christ is that true amen sir and all
[1:32:50] that Christ was he poured into the
[1:32:55] Church the
[1:32:57] bride right yes amen so we're not

[1:33:25] nonsense it's over all this arguing
[1:33:28] about the music and all this arguing

[1:33:31] about one another and all this dividing
[1:33:33] and fussing that's over that's pass
[1:33:35] there are some sons of God that have
[1:33:38] matured and now are
[1:33:41] adopted can you say man we're not like
[1:33:43] the Corinthian Church that just fuss and
[1:33:45] argued that well my favorite preacher is

[1:34:26] that the church is going to see is
[1:34:27] Christ manifested in his power in
[1:34:31] fullness in his church just before the
[1:34:34] fire falls amen can you say Amen
[1:34:38] remember lot was the one the fire fell
[1:34:41] from the sky not back in the days of
[1:34:43] loah Noah that was the water came in his
[1:34:46] day but Christ expressed what type of
[1:34:49] ministry would be in the days of
[1:34:52] lot what Ministry was that
[1:34:55] MDC God made
[1:35:00] flesh God become
[1:35:03] human drank milk from a
[1:35:06] calf ain't that
[1:35:08] right a cow

[1:35:22] and he came to an elep
[1:35:27] now we see the Holy Spirit now today we
[1:35:31] see the Holy Spirit among his church in
[1:35:33] the same
[1:35:38] manner
[1:35:42] amen you love him
[1:35:46] hallu he says in this last day the
[1:35:48] fullness of the word has come in his son
[1:35:50] Jesus Christ God made flesh Among Us
[1:35:54] another place now he promised that he
[1:35:55] would appear in these last days in the
[1:35:58] form of human flesh again in your
[1:36:02] flesh not just brother bram's brother
[1:36:06] branham's Ministry was to show us what
[1:36:07] time it was can you say Amen his
[1:36:11] ministry was the work of
[1:36:13] MDC ain't that right amen but he was not
[1:36:16] the whole body of Christ there is a body
[1:36:19] many membered body can you say amen and
[1:36:23] the same God that we saw in brother
[1:36:25] Brandon we're not worshiping that man
[1:36:27] but we saw God come in human flesh it
[1:36:30] wasn't a spoken word body and it wasn't
[1:36:33] a a a a body like Jesus Christ who knew
[1:36:36] no sin but this was a sex born body that
[1:36:39] had been redeemed so God would show by
[1:36:42] coming into that body right there a
[1:36:45] sinful body but a redeemed body that
[1:36:48] there was a power to this Calvary there
[1:36:50] was a power to his resurrection
[1:36:54] he had finally got a man that he can
[1:36:56] have full preeminent in and so is it in
[1:36:59] this age God's got a
[1:37:03] people praise God that he can have
[1:37:06] complete
[1:37:08] preeminence the token on
[1:37:12] display
[1:37:14] Hallelujah sir now he promised that he
[1:37:17] would appear in these last days in the
[1:37:19] form of human flesh again in your flesh
[1:37:22] like he did at the days of Sodom God
[1:37:25] which was Christ manifested in flesh now
[1:37:27] in his church his bride see they're
[1:37:30] coming together it's uniting time
[1:37:32] churches are uniting nations are uniting
[1:37:36] the Bride In Christ is uniting it's
[1:37:38] uniting time remember this is exactly
[1:37:41] what Jesus prayed that we would be one
[1:37:46] as he and the father are one that's
[1:37:48] right amen now Satan come and he says
[1:37:50] I'll make them a Oneness I'll I I'll do
[1:37:52] a Oneness and so he raises up the World
[1:37:55] Council of churches and every
[1:37:57] denomination is going back to it they're
[1:37:59] been sucked up into it and and and
[1:38:01] people world over are being sucked up
[1:38:04] into this to try to form a Oneness can
[1:38:07] you say amen amen but they're without a
[1:38:09] token there ain't no token on
[1:38:12] it amen one place brother BR said
[1:38:15] they'll probably unite to together to
[1:38:17] defeat communism and and these things
[1:38:19] and we're seeing all this taking place
[1:38:21] ain't that right but that's not the kind
[1:38:23] of Oneness that Jesus was praying for
[1:38:25] brother Brown said he said Jesus said be
[1:38:29] be one as I and the father are one yeah
[1:38:32] see be that kind of one well then how
[1:38:35] will that be the word in us would be the
[1:38:38] anointed word I say that again the word
[1:38:40] in us not just here now we've at the
[1:38:44] book it's in US it'll be the anointed
[1:38:47] word not some dried up sermon and some
[1:38:49] little teaching and and a little
[1:38:51] Theology and some psychology mixed in
[1:38:54] and everybody just sits there does their
[1:38:56] little thing no no no and everybody's
[1:38:59] still living living sinful lives and and
[1:39:01] all this and and not even I understand
[1:39:04] apostolics have tried it so many times
[1:39:06] to bring the people one to the word by
[1:39:08] all their legalistic ideas and all their
[1:39:10] legalistic things and all their
[1:39:12] legalistic you'll never get Oneness by
[1:39:15] legalism come on Church you'll never get
[1:39:19] Oneness by legalism I don't care how
[1:39:21] much law you put over the congregation
[1:39:23] you'll make a Oneness that way see the
[1:39:25] word in us would be the anointed word
[1:39:28] that's the Oneness of God the oness of
[1:39:32] God is the word anointed in
[1:39:35] you amen then you become a son a messiah
[1:39:40] to the or of the
[1:39:42] age that's the token Hallelujah to God
[1:39:45] on display right yes sir now notice the
[1:39:50] people are being made ready by the word
[1:39:52] of truth from the messenger to this age
[1:39:55] how are we getting ready we are getting
[1:39:58] ready by the word of truth from the
[1:40:01] messenger to this age only one
[1:40:05] messenger you believe it can you say it
[1:40:07] with me there's only one messenger don't
[1:40:10] need another messenger not following
[1:40:12] some personality not following some
[1:40:15] other
[1:40:16] Prophet if there is a prophet that rises
[1:40:18] that Spirit of a prophet will be subject
[1:40:20] to the
[1:40:21] prophet can you say Amen
[1:40:24] that's exactly right that's why brother
[1:40:25] Brandon couldn't teach anything outside
[1:40:26] of what Paul
[1:40:28] taught can you say Amen Paul taught it
[1:40:31] in Mysteries brother brandom taught it
[1:40:33] in Revelation that's exactly right
[1:40:36] church we don't need another messenger
[1:40:38] for our age we don't need somebody else
[1:40:41] to find direction for the church you
[1:40:43] have the direction by the message of
[1:40:45] this
[1:40:47] hour hello Hallelujah to God yes sir and
[1:40:51] in her in her in the bride will be the
[1:40:54] fullness of Pentecost for the spirit
[1:40:56] will bring the people right back to
[1:40:58] where they were at the beginning that is
[1:41:01] thus sayith the Lord can you say Amen
[1:41:05] now notice so we understand where the
[1:41:07] token is what it is I hope you do if not
[1:41:09] go listen to the
[1:41:11] Token amen but see now we looking at
[1:41:15] Rahab here comes the here comes the
[1:41:18] Joshua going to take the land right amen
[1:41:21] he send spies over there brother called
[1:41:23] them tape boys amen what were they doing
[1:41:26] they were spreading the same message
[1:41:27] that Joshua
[1:41:30] had so whether you press play or you get
[1:41:32] behind the pulpit and read quotes I
[1:41:34] think you're still a tape boy as long as
[1:41:35] you still preach the gospel and say it
[1:41:38] the way brother Bram said
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:44] it that's my thoughts
[1:41:47] anyway so we find that he went they went
[1:41:50] and told Rahab they got in touch with
[1:41:52] Rahab God divinely ENT brought them
[1:41:56] together and they began to tell Rahab
[1:41:58] what was going to happen she said well
[1:42:00] we've already heard about the H the
[1:42:01] terror that you've all done we're
[1:42:03] shaking here we're all nervous now
[1:42:06] they're getting ready to leave but she
[1:42:07] says promise me just promise me yes sir
[1:42:12] promise me salvation promise me yes sir
[1:42:15] a
[1:42:16] refuge I know God is with you that's
[1:42:19] right I know that and I want to be saved
[1:42:22] that's right amen and them boys knew
[1:42:24] exactly what to say Amen take a token
[1:42:28] yeah let it be displayed amen and if
[1:42:31] that token is on display that string
[1:42:33] that Scarlet thread if it's on display
[1:42:36] they didn't have to go ask the prophet
[1:42:39] Joshua and say is this okay they were
[1:42:41] divinely
[1:42:43] inspired can you say amen amen the same
[1:42:46] God that inspired Moses to put a token
[1:42:49] on on display there at at at the first
[1:42:52] Exodus I believe was the same God that
[1:42:54] was there and and said apply the token
[1:42:57] get the token on display ain't that
[1:42:59] right buddy when they left that's
[1:43:01] exactly what she done I guarantee you
[1:43:03] she stayed there amen making sure
[1:43:05] whatever she had to do to make sure that
[1:43:06] thing was solid that that thing would
[1:43:08] the wind ain't going to blow it trial
[1:43:10] ain't going to blow it the way ain't
[1:43:11] rain ain't going to wash it away I don't
[1:43:13] care sandstorms or whatever that token
[1:43:15] was going to remain forever amen and
[1:43:18] then she got so inspired by this she so
[1:43:22] believed this that that the protection
[1:43:24] was under the token wherever that token
[1:43:26] was thank God there was a believer that
[1:43:28] knew exactly where the token was they
[1:43:31] she wasn't confused about the token she
[1:43:33] wasn't listening to every preacher Tom
[1:43:35] Dick and Harry out there she believed
[1:43:37] the message of the hour she knew that
[1:43:41] God was with them men and if they said
[1:43:44] apply the token that's what I'm going to
[1:43:46] do and then she went through the city
[1:43:48] trying to get everybody that would
[1:43:50] believe her the prophet says that she
[1:43:52] tried to get every body that would
[1:43:53] believe her gather under the token she
[1:43:56] got her family she anyone that would
[1:43:59] believe her amen she brought them under
[1:44:01] the
[1:44:03] token and said we're going to stay right
[1:44:05] here oh but you don't know I understand
[1:44:07] I'm hungry stay right here the token
[1:44:09] they're coming judgment's coming hello
[1:44:13] amen yeah but don't you think that's a
[1:44:14] little crazy holding the string I don't
[1:44:15] care how crazy it looks I'm telling you
[1:44:17] I believe the message of the hour this
[1:44:20] is what they said to do and we're going
[1:44:22] to do now stay under the
[1:44:25] token this message might look crazy to
[1:44:28] us or to the people out there but it's
[1:44:30] the thing that God is in God has
[1:44:32] confirmed can you say man don't be
[1:44:34] ashamed of this message don't be ashamed
[1:44:36] well you say well if I tell them God
[1:44:38] sent a prop they'll think of us is more
[1:44:39] I don't care this is the one with the
[1:44:42] token
[1:44:44] Hallelujah bless the Lord
[1:44:49] rightall it amen she became concerned
[1:44:52] not only only for herself but for
[1:44:57] others Amen to me that's what a True
[1:45:01] Believer is ministry right Ministry is
[1:45:04] about laboring for Souls of
[1:45:08] mankind not just telling them about
[1:45:13] Jesus and not just being passive about
[1:45:17] it right but doing our best to get them
[1:45:20] where the token
[1:45:21] is yes Lord doing our
[1:45:25] best to get them where the token
[1:45:29] is amen Lord see this is what it's about
[1:45:33] when you're in Ministry Ministry you're
[1:45:35] burden for the lost that's right you're
[1:45:38] are burden for those who are bound and
[1:45:39] need to be delivered you are burden for
[1:45:41] the sick whom Satan is tormenting
[1:45:44] physically and
[1:45:46] mentally you want to see the Brotherhood
[1:45:48] among Believers amen you want to see the
[1:45:51] complexes d Dy that Satan has built up
[1:45:54] in the people you want to see people
[1:45:57] healed from the hurts and scars they
[1:45:59] have endured you you you want to see
[1:46:01] that Spirit of belie unbelief driven

[1:46:05] people get them where the token
[1:46:08] is get the token
[1:46:11] displayed you with
[1:46:14] me amen now Divine
[1:46:20] love is what causes the the individual
[1:46:23] to have a genuine burden for
[1:46:26] souls for lost souls and you remember
[1:46:29] brother Brown talking about Bert Hall
[1:46:33] you know the
[1:46:35] lizardy man said he was one of the best
[1:46:38] hunters there there was
[1:46:42] and Brandon apparently hunted with him
[1:46:44] on occasion and talked to him about the
[1:46:50] Lord but Bert Hall was just he brother
[1:46:53] BR said he was just mean
[1:46:56] yeah and so that day you know they
[1:46:59] stopped it was kind of snowing and I
[1:47:01] think they stopped and he he thought
[1:47:03] well you know he must be wanting to eat
[1:47:06] CU it was around lunchtime so he started
[1:47:08] getting his stuff out of the and he
[1:47:11] noticed he looked at Bert and Bert was
[1:47:13] smiling just that Wicked
[1:47:16] grin and he had a deer
[1:47:20] call and he blew that call and it
[1:47:23] sounded like a baby in distress baby
[1:47:27] fawn and he said right in front of them
[1:47:30] a do stood up looking around and and the
[1:47:35] prophet says that that D knew they were
[1:47:37] there she knew danger was
[1:47:40] there but her love
[1:47:43] for
[1:47:45] that baby that she thought was in
[1:47:50] trouble caused her to expose her self
[1:47:53] cause her
[1:47:54] to look
[1:47:56] around right yeah brother Brandon says
[1:48:00] that he thought oh God don't don't let
[1:48:03] him do this
[1:48:05] right and he said he he just looked away
[1:48:08] he just couldn't stand to look at it and
[1:48:11] to to see this cuz Bert had his gun
[1:48:13] toward her and going to shoot
[1:48:16] her but he said the he just closed his
[1:48:19] eyes and but nothing happened so he kind
[1:48:22] I looked and Bert was over there just
[1:48:26] sobbing and he said
[1:48:29] Billy Le lead me to that Jesus you've
[1:48:32] talked to me about Hallelujah brother
[1:48:34] Bram said well what was it he said he
[1:48:36] saw the love of that mother right that
[1:48:40] mother
[1:48:41] deer and he was able to connect that
[1:48:45] with
[1:48:46] Calvary the love that Jesus had for
[1:48:49] us that he would be willing to be laugh
[1:48:52] scoffed and rejected and mocked and
[1:48:56] killed for the sake of our
[1:49:00] needs
[1:49:03] amen so brother Bram said see she was
[1:49:06] willing to face the danger to make sure
[1:49:08] see he was he was willing to make sure
[1:49:12] that it was safe and all that and he
[1:49:14] says and the love of God will cause us
[1:49:17] to do the
[1:49:18] same it'll cause us to go right out in
[1:49:21] the face of the enemy and in the face of
[1:49:23] danger or anything to bring in lost
[1:49:24] souls to the kingdom of
[1:49:26] God right that's what divine love does
[1:49:30] it it it causes us with a passion
[1:49:34] doesn't matter if we're laughed at it
[1:49:35] takes all the ashamed us away it takes
[1:49:37] all the embarrassment away because we
[1:49:40] there there's there's a passion for
[1:49:43] souls and of course this is the Father's
[1:49:45] will right so brother Bram say see when
[1:49:48] we pray now and and I trust this is okay
[1:49:52] for you today but he says when we pray
[1:49:55] we must have the token to present with
[1:49:57] our
[1:49:58] prayers as I said now believe for oursel
[1:50:02] and apply the token to the whole family
[1:50:05] like in Egypt Jericho or even in Acts
[1:50:10] 16:31 about the Paul telling the Roman
[1:50:13] Centurion believe thou and all thy house
[1:50:15] shall be saved see apply it to your
[1:50:17] family if you got an unsafe child lay

[1:53:50] wrong how you going to ask God to do do
[1:53:52] anything for you when you know you're

[1:54:38] children that we won't live life for
[1:54:42] us that we'll live
