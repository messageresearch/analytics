[1:05:03] verse here Exodus 15 and we're going to
[1:05:06] be reading uh verses 21 down to 26
[1:05:10] Exodus 15:21 and Miram answered them
[1:05:14] sing ye to the Lord for he have
[1:05:17] triumphed gloriously Israel from the Red
[1:05:20] Sea and they went out into the
[1:05:22] Wilderness of shur and they went three
[1:05:24] days in the wilderness nness and found
[1:05:27] the
[1:05:28] water and when they had come to Mara
[1:05:30] they could not drink of the Waters of
[1:05:32] Mara for they were bitter therefore they
[1:05:35] called the name of it Mara and the
[1:05:38] people mumbled against Moses saying what
[1:05:42] shall we drink and he cried unto the
[1:05:45] Lord and the Lord showed him a tree and
[1:05:48] when he had cast into the waters the
[1:05:51] waters were made sweet and there he made
[1:05:54] for them a statue you in an ordinance
[1:05:57] and there he proved them and said if
[1:06:00] thou will diligently hearken to the
[1:06:02] voice of the Lord thy God and thou will
[1:06:05] do that which is right in his sight and
[1:06:07] will give ear to his Commandments and
[1:06:09] keep all of his statues I will put none
[1:06:12] of these diseases upon thee which I have
[1:06:15] brought upon the Egyptians for I am the
[1:06:20] Lord that Health thee may God bless his
[1:06:24] word tonight as you could be seated
[1:06:26] of course this is where that the Lord
[1:06:29] gained the name of Jehovah RFI and I
[1:06:32] want to speak to you tonight if I could
[1:06:34] just a little while on the Lord our
[1:06:37] healer on the Lord on the Lord our
[1:06:40] healer this is where he gained the name
[1:06:43] Jehovah Rafa now you know that the name
[1:06:47] of Jehovah was given to God Amen he took
[1:06:50] the name as his name was changed from
[1:06:53] Elohim uh to Jehovah of course this was
[1:06:56] happened in the Book of Genesis if
[1:06:57] you're a Bible reader you know that the
[1:06:59] Bible begins in Genesis chapter 1 saying
[1:07:01] in the beginning God created and it says
[1:07:04] and God and God and God but then when
[1:07:07] God formed man the Bible says and the
[1:07:10] Lord God formed man from the dust of the
[1:07:12] earth and brother Bram said notice here
[1:07:14] is a change in the name of the Lord that
[1:07:17] he took a different name and he was now
[1:07:20] called Jehovah Elohim and he said now
[1:07:23] this word Elohim meant self-existent now
[1:07:25] of course you know that many people know
[1:07:27] the name Elohim is plural amen and they
[1:07:30] try to make it plural personalities as a
[1:07:32] trinitarian but we all know that the
[1:07:34] plurality was in attribute not in person
[1:07:37] amen but that person then began to
[1:07:39] create off of himself by his word and
[1:07:42] created a son in his own likeness and
[1:07:44] image and then he took the name Jehovah
[1:07:47] which meant God existed with his family
[1:07:50] and brother BR said he must have give
[1:07:51] something to man amen to change his name
[1:07:54] like that he give him a Dominion upon
[1:07:56] the Earth is that right he gave unto him
[1:07:59] a godship in his own image and he put
[1:08:01] Adam over the over the over the uh over
[1:08:04] the Earth and and we find that his name
[1:08:06] was Jehovah of course now the name
[1:08:08] Jehovah amen didn't reflect seven
[1:08:11] Redemptive names until after the fall
[1:08:13] and then throughout the ages then he
[1:08:15] began to gain names you knowen the name
[1:08:18] of Jesus is actually made of seven
[1:08:20] Redemptive names and I'm not preach on
[1:08:21] the Redemptive names tonight but but
[1:08:23] seven of those Redemptive names and of
[1:08:24] course there's spoken in the scripture
[1:08:26] in different places but in in and many
[1:08:29] times what was happening was a
[1:08:31] revelation of the name of God would come
[1:08:33] forward like it was with Abraham when he
[1:08:35] went up the mountain in in Genesis 22
[1:08:38] and he needed a sacrifice and there was
[1:08:40] no sacrifice but his son Isaac and in
[1:08:42] that moment amen when he was ready to
[1:08:44] sacrifice his own son he looked in the
[1:08:46] bush and there was a realm amen and he
[1:08:49] built the Altar and he called the name
[1:08:51] of the Lord Jehovah Gyra for he
[1:08:54] provideth for himself
[1:08:56] seeing that God now gave a revelation to
[1:08:59] the Seed of Abraham that the god they
[1:09:01] served had the kind of name that he
[1:09:04] provides for himself so then there was a
[1:09:06] great another revelation of God come
[1:09:08] upon that name and then of course that
[1:09:10] name then broke out here amen into the
[1:09:13] name of Jehovah RFA which meant the Lord
[1:09:16] who Health our diseases that's the kind
[1:09:18] of God he is the one that is a Healer
[1:09:21] now here they are amen the prophet of
[1:09:24] God said following that Pillar of Fire
[1:09:26] amen they've come out of Egypt and
[1:09:28] they've crossed the Great Red Sea and
[1:09:30] they've been in great victories and you
[1:09:32] would think anybody following the pillar
[1:09:34] of fire would never run into a Red Sea
[1:09:37] you know you would think of anybody that
[1:09:39] would come into something so uh such a
[1:09:41] roadblock as it was amen when they were
[1:09:44] coming out of Egypt you know you're all
[1:09:45] following that prophet and you're all
[1:09:47] following that Pillar of Fire of course
[1:09:49] it's going to be uh a straight ways and
[1:09:51] there's going to be no obstacles and
[1:09:52] there's going to be no Winds of
[1:09:54] opposition and nobody going to get sick
[1:09:56] and there's not going to be any problems
[1:09:58] happening that's the way people view it
[1:10:00] amen but that's not the way the Bible is
[1:10:01] written amen the Bible said they didn't
[1:10:03] the more get out of the out of Egypt
[1:10:05] until they ran in front of them and and
[1:10:08] and an army behind them amen but you
[1:10:10] know the thing God did he led him to
[1:10:12] that place to show us as Believers today
[1:10:15] and brother B said he allowed that to
[1:10:17] happen to let us know amen that when
[1:10:20] there is no way that's when God makes a
[1:10:23] way amen when there's no way oh over it
[1:10:25] and there's no way around it and there's
[1:10:27] no way under it that's when God opens a
[1:10:30] way right through the middle of it amen
[1:10:32] because that's the kind of God we're
[1:10:33] serving today we're serving the kind of
[1:10:35] God that can open up Red Seas if he he
[1:10:38] told the children of Israel you're going
[1:10:40] to go with me to this mountain and
[1:10:42] you're going to serve me on this
[1:10:43] mountain so there was no sea could get
[1:10:45] in their way because God was leading
[1:10:47] them through it and and when you watch
[1:10:49] the when you watch it as they was
[1:10:51] following that great Pillar of Fire
[1:10:53] brother Ram said it was the angel of the
[1:10:55] it it was the Lord Jesus Christ it was
[1:10:58] God the Holy Spirit that's what they
[1:11:00] were following of course Christ the
[1:11:02] logos the angel of the Covenant led the
[1:11:04] children of Israel from Egypt to the
[1:11:07] promised land it was just a foreshadow
[1:11:09] as he did in the natural he does in the
[1:11:11] spiritual today what was it they were
[1:11:13] following that Pillar of Fire when they
[1:11:16] come up to the Waters of Mara it's when
[1:11:18] they come up to a place 3 days without
[1:11:20] water and when they finally get to water
[1:11:23] they can't drink it because it's bitter
[1:11:25] now I don't know if you've ever come
[1:11:27] into bitter Waters following this
[1:11:29] message or not but sometimes things can
[1:11:31] get bitter amen they can get bitter
[1:11:33] experiences in your church life you can
[1:11:36] have bitter experiences in your family
[1:11:38] life you can have bitter experiences in
[1:11:40] your own in your own Journey amen and
[1:11:42] find that your body amen is subject to
[1:11:45] sicknesses and diseases and troubles
[1:11:48] amen and you'll say well I was following
[1:11:49] the Lord why have I come up to this kind
[1:11:52] of problem but I find amen that God was
[1:11:54] leading leading them to Bitter Waters
[1:11:57] but he was leading them to Bitter Waters
[1:11:59] so they might understand that the god
[1:12:02] that is leading is able to provide
[1:12:04] whatever is needed in the journey that
[1:12:06] if there is a healing needed he is a God
[1:12:09] that can heal if there is a need to walk
[1:12:11] through a a red sea he's a God that can
[1:12:14] open Red Sea somebody with appendicitis
[1:12:16] he said or some anything maybe here's
[1:12:19] the prescription that Moses read to them
[1:12:21] he said I am the Lord that Health the
[1:12:24] they only had one prescription on the
[1:12:26] entire journey I am the Lord that Health
[1:12:29] the can you imagine now wait a minut we
[1:12:31] raised three children my wife's
[1:12:33] prescription bag was pretty big bag we
[1:12:35] we traveled she had ipren she had all
[1:12:38] kinds of bandages and Band-Aids and
[1:12:40] medications and the prophet said Moses
[1:12:42] he only had one script bag he only had
[1:12:45] one thing in the medicine cabinet amen
[1:12:47] he had I am the Lord that Health all
[1:12:50] thine diseases because God had so
[1:12:53] revealed it to them in that age when
[1:12:55] they come to the bitter Waters they were
[1:12:57] serving a God that could make bitter
[1:12:59] waterers sweet and I tell you something
[1:13:01] today amen Our God that we're serving
[1:13:04] can take the bitterness of your journey
[1:13:06] and make it the sweetest thing that
[1:13:08] you've ever had I tell you you never you
[1:13:10] never drank sweeter water amen than when
[1:13:13] God took something that was bitter and
[1:13:15] made it something that you could drink
[1:13:17] amen I believe it today don't you the
[1:13:19] place of your overcoming is some of the
[1:13:21] best things you've ever had I know we
[1:13:24] run up into problems and we run into
[1:13:26] trials and we think well if we're
[1:13:28] following the Lord we're never going
[1:13:29] that one day he was on a journey and a
[1:13:32] line come out to eat him amen but you
[1:13:34] know what he done he whipped that line
[1:13:36] killed him and hid him back in the
[1:13:38] bushes and later they were on another
[1:13:40] Journey with his parents and and they
[1:13:42] come through there and they got hungry
[1:13:44] and they needed something to eat amen
[1:13:46] and they got to look around said we
[1:13:47] ain't got nothing with us amen but there
[1:13:50] was a former experience that he had had
[1:13:52] and it was it was a place of hiding and
[1:13:55] was a place of his overcoming and he
[1:13:57] reached back in a place that nobody else
[1:13:59] could see and he brought honey out of
[1:14:02] the overcoming of his life and let me
[1:14:04] say something today amen the sweetest
[1:14:07] honey you ever ate is when you've
[1:14:09] overcome something and later you're
[1:14:11] walking with somebody else and they say
[1:14:13] well I'm in a place in my life and I
[1:14:15] just can't get over I'm going through
[1:14:17] this brother Wayne and I don't know how
[1:14:19] to get over it but you can reach back
[1:14:21] there in a secret place and say I got
[1:14:23] some honey I come to this same trial one
[1:14:26] time myself I had some problems myself
[1:14:29] but there's a God that can overcome let
[1:14:32] me say something I used to chew tobacco
[1:14:35] young man but one day God come into my
[1:14:38] life and he took the desire of tobacco
[1:14:40] out of my heart and let me say if you're
[1:14:43] facing that devil tonight amen you can
[1:14:45] you know what you can do you can stop
[1:14:46] smoking in a
[1:14:49] moment you quit chewing in a moment you
[1:14:52] can quit drinking in a moment amen let's
[1:14:54] get some of that honey out of that
[1:14:56] overcoming of my own life and let me
[1:14:59] tell you that God is able to deliver his
[1:15:03] children sweetest water you is always
[1:15:06] the answer to the bitterness of your
[1:15:08] life and you throw that and you throw
[1:15:10] that old Calvary into that water and it
[1:15:13] starts to sweeten your trials amen it
[1:15:15] don't change the trial trial's still
[1:15:17] there but it sweetens it to the place
[1:15:20] where you can drink it a little while
[1:15:22] let me say something today I believe
[1:15:23] there's some people been drinking some
[1:15:25] Sweet
[1:15:27] Water amen he can sweeten that place of
[1:15:30] your life but God had to teach them
[1:15:33] you're going to come to Bitter spots but
[1:15:35] you're journeying with somebody who can
[1:15:37] make bitter water
[1:15:39] sweet you're journeying with somebody
[1:15:42] that can take the heat out of the
[1:15:44] Fire come on he let them throw them
[1:15:47] Hebrew children in the furnace and that
[1:15:50] fire was just as hot as it ever was but
[1:15:52] when the son of man come down in the
[1:15:55] love it he took the heat out of that
[1:15:57] fire and I'm serving a god tonight that
[1:16:00] can take the heat out of your trial you
[1:16:02] might be going through some of the
[1:16:03] hottest Trials of your life but the God
[1:16:07] that I serve he's able to take the heat
[1:16:09] out of it and brother you can fellowship
[1:16:11] with Christ in the middle of your
[1:16:13] troubles you can tell him I love you
[1:16:16] Jesus I can praise God even though the
[1:16:18] trial is here the furnaces can take the
[1:16:20] bitterness out of the water he can take
[1:16:22] the heat out of the fire he can give you
[1:16:25] overcoming in your line amen there's a
[1:16:27] God here tonight that is the Lord that
[1:16:31] Health
[1:16:33] all he's all of thine
[1:16:36] diseases that's right you know in The
[1:16:38] Exodus here we find they come out they
[1:16:41] went through the Red Sea they come to
[1:16:43] Bitter Waters now this people this
[1:16:46] people was a people of nearly 2 million
[1:16:49] in number it is wrote of them that when
[1:16:52] they come out of Egypt there was not a
[1:16:55] feeble one among them now I want you to
[1:16:58] think about the reality of that I don't
[1:17:01] know how many's here tonight maybe 900
[1:17:03] close to maybe a thousand I'm not sure
[1:17:04] how many's in this building but you look
[1:17:06] at how many needs is here tonight and in
[1:17:09] a group of two million people look at
[1:17:13] what could have been among them from the
[1:17:15] old to the young but the Bible says when
[1:17:18] they come out under this God there was
[1:17:21] not a feeble one among them can you
[1:17:23] imagine whatever it was that they done
[1:17:26] under that token they had eat the
[1:17:28] roasted lamb and the unleavened bread
[1:17:30] and when they eat it they eat it with
[1:17:32] the shoes on their feet and their staff
[1:17:34] in their hand somebody said brother
[1:17:35] Wayne where do you think we are in this
[1:17:37] age with Israel doing and the message
[1:17:39] here and all of it I said I'll tell you
[1:17:41] what I think we should be doing we
[1:17:42] should be eating with our shoes on and
[1:17:44] our staffs in our hand cuz there's a b
[1:17:47] getting ready to leave here there a
[1:17:49] bride getting let he leave here that was
[1:17:51] a first Exodus this is a Third Exodus
[1:17:53] but the Jehovah
[1:17:55] that was in the first Exodus is in the
[1:17:57] Third Exodus and this time it won't be
[1:18:00] just a healing of our body it'll be a
[1:18:03] complete healing of our body amen a new
[1:18:07] dimension a new
[1:18:09] body not a feeble one among them now you
[1:18:13] know critics how they are so you know
[1:18:15] what they're going to say m Sean they're
[1:18:17] going to say oh they left the old people
[1:18:19] back at the camp they left them back in
[1:18:21] Goa you know they left the sick ones and
[1:18:23] the old ones so it could look like that
[1:18:26] everybody was healed you know everybody
[1:18:27] always thinks there's some kind of
[1:18:29] skepticism behind the miracle of God God
[1:18:32] can do a great miracle and and and
[1:18:34] people are creative at what they can
[1:18:35] come up with to tell you what happened
[1:18:38] instead of God healing them I've had
[1:18:40] phone calls people say my mama's having
[1:18:42] a stroke right now brother Wayne go to
[1:18:44] prayer and you go to Prayer by the time
[1:18:46] they get to the hospital amen and they
[1:18:48] oh it's a stroke it's a stroke and next
[1:18:49] thing you know they're call and say well
[1:18:51] they really don't know what happened
[1:18:54] just all the results and effects just
[1:18:57] left them we really don't maybe she was
[1:18:59] just overheated maybe her pulse got up a
[1:19:02] little bit no that's not what happened
[1:19:04] and I tell you what happened the devil
[1:19:05] did exactly what you thought but there
[1:19:07] was a Jehovah rile right there that said
[1:19:10] not this one not today ain't going to
[1:19:13] happen because God let me tell you God
[1:19:15] can stop a stroke right in the middle of
[1:19:17] it that's the kind of God that I serve I
[1:19:20] know I watched my mother three times go
[1:19:23] through it but God rich in Mercy stop
[1:19:26] the thing in the middle of
[1:19:28] it and turn the thing around because
[1:19:31] he's that kind of God that's the god
[1:19:34] that we're serving tonight you know amen
[1:19:36] they come up with all kinds of ideas
[1:19:37] well maybe they left the old people back
[1:19:39] maybe they left the sick ones back maybe
[1:19:41] that's what happened now I don't know if
[1:19:42] you've ever noticed there's an entire
[1:19:44] section of scripture about about them
[1:19:46] leaving in Exodus the 10th chapter it's
[1:19:49] when Moses and Aaron go in to talk to go
[1:19:51] talk to Pharaoh now that's a miracle in
[1:19:53] itself that this uh that this reject and
[1:19:56] runaway and pushed out guy returns 40
[1:19:59] years later and he walks right into
[1:20:00] Pharaoh's
[1:20:02] office that's like you going to the
[1:20:04] president's office that's a miracle in
[1:20:07] itself but when he goes in to talk to
[1:20:09] Pharaoh you know what he does he tells
[1:20:11] him Amen Let My People
[1:20:14] Go and Moses is down there saying let my
[1:20:18] people go because we got to go serve God
[1:20:21] on this mountain see they had to go make
[1:20:23] sacrifices and they had to go serve God
[1:20:26] and they were going to go do it on that
[1:20:27] mountain and you know what Pharaoh does
[1:20:29] he tells him he says well I'll tell you
[1:20:31] what you can do he said I I I I'll let
[1:20:33] you do it he said see you go serve the
[1:20:37] Lord now we'll let y'all go serve the
[1:20:40] Lord but don't you take these young
[1:20:42] people with
[1:20:43] you now don't that sound a little bit
[1:20:45] like the devil today we'll let you have
[1:20:48] your religion brother Mark we'll let the
[1:20:50] preachers have church and we'll let
[1:20:52] everybody have their religion but but
[1:20:54] but we he ain't going to let the people
[1:20:56] of these young GRS and he'll let your
[1:20:58] daddy have some church but the same
[1:21:00] devil that was back there in Pharaoh was
[1:21:02] still alive today and he said but there
[1:21:04] ain't going to be no Revival in this
[1:21:06] Young Generation amen y'all can go on
[1:21:08] and do it amen and I can't stop you but
[1:21:10] I ain't going to let you have it in the
[1:21:12] youth and I love the way Moses answers
[1:21:14] him and he tells him he says now he says
[1:21:17] listen now amen I'm going to call to
[1:21:19] Moses again and said now won't you go
[1:21:21] serve the Lord but leave your flocks and
[1:21:23] your herds here
[1:21:25] now what good would it do to leave and
[1:21:28] go out to have offerings and they a't
[1:21:30] got no stock to have offerings you see
[1:21:33] how the devil do y'all go and go to
[1:21:34] church but y'all don't need no sacrifice
[1:21:37] down there amen go ahead and enter
[1:21:39] tradition and don't get no sweet incense
[1:21:42] don't don't get no Holy Ghost movement
[1:21:44] going in down you see how the devil does
[1:21:47] don't you y'all go on out but you don't
[1:21:48] take your young people and go on out and
[1:21:50] don't take the cattle amen but you go
[1:21:52] out and serve the Lord amen but you you
[1:21:54] know what God kept God kept pushing and
[1:21:57] pressing the issue until one time Moses
[1:22:00] amen and Aaron are called amen into
[1:22:02] Pharaoh's office amen and he called for
[1:22:05] them he said I tell you what you do you
[1:22:07] go forth from among this people both ye
[1:22:09] and your children and the Lord has said
[1:22:12] and take your flocks and your herds as
[1:22:14] you have said and be
[1:22:16] gone amen you see what happened amen the
[1:22:19] devil finally got fed up with them amen
[1:22:23] because they brought such a flag on the
[1:22:25] gods of Egypt amen until finally they
[1:22:28] didn't even want them among them and
[1:22:30] finally the Egyptians said listen you
[1:22:32] take everything you got and get out of
[1:22:34] here because Moses wasn't ready to leave
[1:22:37] unless he could take everything with him
[1:22:40] and I don't know about you but the devil
[1:22:42] has this Bride on their hands until
[1:22:44] every young person is free to worship
[1:22:47] God until every Service as the Dynamics
[1:22:50] of the Holy Ghost on the inside of it
[1:22:53] listen but it's time to tell the devil
[1:22:55] you got me on your hands until you let
[1:22:58] my baby go you got me on your hands I'm
[1:23:01] going to praise God and worship God
[1:23:04] until you let my babies go I say Satan
[1:23:08] turn loose of the
[1:23:10] youth I say young people God's gave you
[1:23:14] a freedom it's time to use your freedom
[1:23:17] use your freedom you got youth on your
[1:23:22] side I know the devil tells you you
[1:23:24] ain't old enough to worship yet but he's
[1:23:26] a liar the Bible tells me that praise
[1:23:29] were perfected in the mouth of the babes
[1:23:32] that's where perfect praise
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:36] comes hallelujah
[1:23:39] hallelujah isn't it amazing God puts an
[1:23:41] entire section of scripture to the fact
[1:23:44] nothing was left
[1:23:46] behind so that when I say that there was
[1:23:49] no feeble among them it meant they had
[1:23:52] every sick person they had had every old
[1:23:55] person they had every calf they had
[1:23:57] every cow they had every bit of the
[1:23:59] Lambs they had everything that belonged
[1:24:01] to them and nothing was
[1:24:06] sick because there was no feeble ones
[1:24:08] among them do you see what it was they
[1:24:11] were serving Jehovah Rafi they were
[1:24:14] serving a God that was a Healer it was
[1:24:17] so powerful church that David sang
[1:24:20] psalms about it in Psalms 103 David
[1:24:23] sings of the Lord he said oh bless the
[1:24:25] Lord oh my soul and all that is within
[1:24:28] me bless His holy name well bless the
[1:24:31] Lord my soul and forget not his benefits
[1:24:33] and watch those benefits who forgiveth
[1:24:36] all thine
[1:24:38] iniquity well I tell you if you ain't
[1:24:40] praise God in a little while you just
[1:24:42] read that one and you got all the rights
[1:24:45] to do
[1:24:45] it you got every right to bless the Lord
[1:24:48] tonight you said brother Wayne ain't
[1:24:50] nothing going in my life let me tell you
[1:24:52] what's going right for you God has
[1:24:54] forgiven your
[1:24:56] iniquity God is Not marking down your
[1:24:59] iniquity there's nothing greater in the
[1:25:01] earth sins unto him that's why when Paul
[1:25:04] wrote that in Romans 4 can you imagine
[1:25:07] Paul killing Christians but it was also
[1:25:09] the Seed of Abraham how he brought in
[1:25:12] the promise and said it's not counted
[1:25:14] against me I am a Seed of Abraham no
[1:25:17] wonder Paul could preach the sacrifice
[1:25:20] of the blood of Jesus Christ in the
[1:25:22] Hebrews and say it's it's every
[1:25:24] sacrifice it's every tradition it's
[1:25:27] every Oracle fulfilled in the blood of
[1:25:29] Jesus Christ therefore being perfected
[1:25:32] by one sacrifice we are all
[1:25:36] perfect do you see what he was doing
[1:25:39] amen he's showing you that forgiveness
[1:25:41] is connected to
[1:25:43] Healing cuz Peter I mean David says it
[1:25:47] he said don't forget his benefits who
[1:25:48] forgiveth thine iniquity who Health all
[1:25:52] thy diseases now watch now
[1:25:55] healing and forgiveness of sins are
[1:25:57] connected together in Psalms
[1:26:00] 103 do you see he tells you he Health
[1:26:04] all that's right thine diseases it's
[1:26:08] amazing to me amen that God in this
[1:26:12] great journey with Moses was
[1:26:15] establishing the marks of atonement now
[1:26:18] watch because when they were traveling
[1:26:19] along they they were pretty tired by
[1:26:23] this time they had travel by the way of
[1:26:25] the Red Sea numbers 21 and they begin to
[1:26:27] Compass the land of Edom and the soul of
[1:26:29] the people were
[1:26:32] discouraged because of the way and I
[1:26:35] tell you what if you going to walk this
[1:26:37] way now you know by prophecy it's a
[1:26:39] harder
[1:26:40] way now now look if somebody promised
[1:26:43] you this was easy they lied to you and
[1:26:47] you're going to be upset at the Lord but
[1:26:50] never one time did he promise a fly re
[1:26:52] beta ease but he did promise his grace
[1:26:56] was sufficient he did say many are the
[1:26:59] afflictions of the righteous but God ha
[1:27:03] delivered us from them
[1:27:06] all these people became
[1:27:09] discouraged because of the way do you
[1:27:11] know if you don't know this you probably
[1:27:13] sure to find it out as a Christian that
[1:27:16] discouragement is one of the greatest
[1:27:17] weapons Satan
[1:27:20] has discouragement can cause you to not
[1:27:23] do the things that you know to
[1:27:27] do sometimes people get discouraged in
[1:27:29] the in the way you know if you're reader
[1:27:31] of the Bible when they was building the
[1:27:33] walls of of of U when they building the
[1:27:35] walls back in the days of zerubba I BL
[1:27:37] it's the book of Nehemiah that they were
[1:27:39] working the Bible said they become
[1:27:41] discouraged they were working on the
[1:27:43] house of the Lord now what's crazy is
[1:27:45] the rubble and things that were there
[1:27:47] was always there it's just all of a
[1:27:50] sudden the way they felt about it and do
[1:27:53] you know things that you're dealing with
[1:27:55] have always been there there has always
[1:27:57] been now it might have been somebody
[1:27:59] else's name it might have been somebody
[1:28:01] else's situation but the things that
[1:28:03] you're dealing there's no new thing
[1:28:04] under the sun now so the things you're
[1:28:06] dealing with is human and you're having
[1:28:08] a human experience amen and and and
[1:28:11] because of the way we're walking people
[1:28:13] begin to get discouraged but watch what
[1:28:16] discouragement done to these people they
[1:28:18] begin to speak against God and they
[1:28:20] spake against Moses wherefor have you
[1:28:23] brought us up up out of Egypt to die in
[1:28:25] the
[1:28:26] wilderness now for there are no bread
[1:28:28] neither any water our soul Loth as light
[1:28:31] bread and the Lord sent fiery serpents
[1:28:35] among the people that they bite the
[1:28:36] people and much of the people of Israel
[1:28:39] died now what was they dying for they
[1:28:42] got discouraged and begin to complain
[1:28:44] against God's servant they begin to
[1:28:47] speak horrible about Moses now what's
[1:28:50] crazy watch this therefore the people
[1:28:52] came to Moses and said we have sinned
[1:28:55] and we have he said I pray unto the Lord
[1:28:59] now this is a beautiful thing because
[1:29:02] Moses is acting in a type of
[1:29:05] Christ these people have been rebellious
[1:29:08] and they much deserved the dying they
[1:29:12] had brought upon themselves their own
[1:29:14] problems they had murmured against God
[1:29:17] they had murmured against his servant
[1:29:19] and now they're openly confessing this
[1:29:21] and Moses said I'll pray for you
[1:29:25] and I'll pray the Lord takes away the
[1:29:27] serpents from us and Moses began to pray
[1:29:30] for the people but now watch this God
[1:29:33] did not answer Moses's Prayer by taking
[1:29:36] away the
[1:29:37] serpents God did not take away the
[1:29:40] serpents amen matter of fact them
[1:29:42] serpents stayed there the whole time
[1:29:44] that were bit by the serpent so what he
[1:29:46] did is he took the power out of the
[1:29:49] thing that was causing the problem do
[1:29:52] you see what God does he might not
[1:29:54] change the trial he might not change the
[1:29:56] situation but he takes the power out of
[1:29:59] it you see that amen you might be living
[1:30:02] in the same old thing but all of a
[1:30:04] sudden it loses its power over you come
[1:30:07] on now you know what I'm talking about
[1:30:09] you may be the same old person with the
[1:30:12] same old problem but all of the sudden
[1:30:14] there's no power in it and all of a
[1:30:17] sudden you lost all your desires
[1:30:19] Hallelujah because God took it out of
[1:30:21] there see God didn't take away the
[1:30:24] serpent but he provided something with
[1:30:27] to take the power out of the B of the
[1:30:29] serpent the Lord said unto Moses make a
[1:30:32] fiery serpent set it upon a pole call it
[1:30:34] to pass that everyone that is bitten
[1:30:36] when they look upon it they shall live
[1:30:38] and Moses made a serpent of brass put it
[1:30:40] upon a pole came to pass that if the
[1:30:42] serpent had bitten any man when he
[1:30:45] beheld The Serpent of brass he lived now
[1:30:48] look at this is amazing because y'all
[1:30:51] know that one of the great Commandments
[1:30:52] is to have no graven
[1:30:54] images but now God is using a prophet's
[1:30:58] prayer to so they could see something
[1:31:01] with their own eyes that their sin had
[1:31:04] been judged look at this amen now why
[1:31:07] was it a brass serpent a fiery serpent
[1:31:09] why brass brother said brass is divine
[1:31:12] judgment right Remember The Days of
[1:31:14] Elijah the skies turned brass remember
[1:31:17] that the alter in the Tabernacle was
[1:31:19] braz a serpent now why would it be a
[1:31:22] brass serpent a serpent was now showing
[1:31:26] Israel who knew the story amen of the
[1:31:28] Garden of Eden do you know in the Garden
[1:31:31] of Eden there was a serpent in the
[1:31:32] garden but he actually was a man how
[1:31:34] many knows that how many knows that he
[1:31:37] was the closest thing to a human you
[1:31:38] could get and the only difference
[1:31:40] between him and Adam was he didn't have
[1:31:41] a
[1:31:42] soul he's the missing link between the
[1:31:45] Neanderthal and the human being they
[1:31:48] they they got real close but they can't
[1:31:50] figure out what that last one is so
[1:31:52] close it would amen but you see it was a
[1:31:55] brother man called the beast said it was
[1:31:56] a man amen but but it looked like a man
[1:31:59] talk like a man walk like a man but it
[1:32:02] wasn't a part of creation it was a part
[1:32:04] of the animal creation is that right and
[1:32:07] when it cost don't even have a seed well
[1:32:09] you never read Genesis 3 then but the
[1:32:11] Bible said in Genesis the thirr chapter
[1:32:13] that God was speaking and said because
[1:32:16] amen because of what you have done he
[1:32:18] said I'll curse you to the
[1:32:21] ground and the woman SE should bruise
[1:32:24] the head of the serpent seed see we
[1:32:28] didn't make that word up did we that's
[1:32:30] biblical term serpent seed come right
[1:32:32] out of the Bible somebody said Genesis 4
[1:32:35] verse one brother BL amen the Bible said
[1:32:37] that Eve knew Adam and bear a son called
[1:32:40] his name Cain amen but it's amazing to
[1:32:42] me amen that they can read it like that
[1:32:45] amen and not recognize that there's some
[1:32:47] conjunctions going on in there and
[1:32:49] there's one there's two acts amen three
[1:32:51] acts and two and excuse me two acts and
[1:32:54] three children because do you know Cain
[1:32:56] and Abel were actually
[1:32:59] twins that Cain and Abel were actually
[1:33:02] twins but they had different
[1:33:05] daddies and the serpent was the father
[1:33:07] of Cain amen and Adam was the father of
[1:33:10] Abel and that's why they sacrificed
[1:33:13] differently amen now watch this and when
[1:33:16] God came to the serpent he said to him
[1:33:19] now I'll just put it out there for you
[1:33:20] somebody said well Heen I don't I back
[1:33:24] up in Genesis 3 amen and the Lord
[1:33:26] speaking to Adam he said it was the
[1:33:28] woman and the Lord said to the woman
[1:33:30] what happened she said the serpent begal
[1:33:32] me so ask Eve what happened if you want
[1:33:34] to know God asked her and she told the
[1:33:38] whole world the serpent begal me and
[1:33:40] then God said the woman's seed shall
[1:33:42] bruise the head of the Serpent's Seed is
[1:33:44] that right and the serpent received a
[1:33:47] curse how many knows what the curse was
[1:33:50] he was put up on his belly now is't that
[1:33:52] something that if he was already on his
[1:33:55] belly how was that a curse but he was an
[1:33:57] upright creature he had two legs under
[1:34:00] him but God put him on his belly that
[1:34:03] was the curse somebody said well where's
[1:34:06] the serpent seed today he's in the earth
[1:34:09] amen you I got a I got a brother-in-law
[1:34:11] he got a masters in biology he's a a
[1:34:13] college professor and by the by the
[1:34:15] understanding of serpent seed you'll
[1:34:16] know this snakes don't have much bones
[1:34:18] in them do they but there's one specific
[1:34:20] snake that has a man's fever bone amen
[1:34:23] and it lays in it and they have no
[1:34:25] reason they cannot figure out why would
[1:34:28] a snake have a human leg bone laying
[1:34:31] sideways in it amen but I believe God
[1:34:33] left markers for the scientist amen and
[1:34:36] and if they would only listen to the
[1:34:37] message they could they could go so far
[1:34:40] because God's already gave the answer
[1:34:43] the missing link is the
[1:34:47] serpent so God had him put a snake on a
[1:34:50] pole why a snake on a pole because
[1:34:53] because God had already judged sin amen
[1:34:56] God judged the the reason it wasn't a
[1:34:59] man on the pole because God had already
[1:35:01] judged it you see that if judgment was
[1:35:04] coming for sin then it would have been a
[1:35:06] human on the pole but God had already
[1:35:08] judged it and it was a serpent on the
[1:35:11] pole and when they looked at sin being
[1:35:14] judged brother mam said it like this he
[1:35:16] said it in this way he said look now he
[1:35:18] said if somebody just looked on that it
[1:35:20] wasn't nothing more than just an old
[1:35:22] stick he said with a brass helmet bead
[1:35:25] into a snake that's all it was naturally
[1:35:27] that's all it was and natural people
[1:35:29] look and they would have a healing in
[1:35:32] their body I'll tell you something God
[1:35:34] will give you something natural to see
[1:35:37] so that you can understand that sin has
[1:35:39] already been judged let me say something
[1:35:42] how many you ever seen a healing take
[1:35:43] place do you know what God was doing he
[1:35:46] was letting you know there's an
[1:35:47] atonement for your sin and sin has been
[1:35:50] judged and now it up as a sacrificed now
[1:35:54] what did they do they
[1:35:56] sinned they
[1:35:58] sinned and they needed an atonement for
[1:36:01] sin and it brought them
[1:36:04] healing sin and sickness are one
[1:36:07] another's attribute all sickness is a
[1:36:11] result of sin we all know Salvation by
[1:36:15] atonement but scripture teaches healing
[1:36:18] by atonement there is not a medicine in
[1:36:21] the world that can heal you
[1:36:24] now remember I just I was just in in
[1:36:26] Michigan there in an arbor in the
[1:36:28] University of Michigan probably one of
[1:36:29] the best hospitals up there and uh one
[1:36:31] of the sisters in our church just had a
[1:36:33] double lung transplant and I went in
[1:36:36] there and was sitting in there talking
[1:36:37] and and the and the and the young doctor
[1:36:39] come in there kind of intimidating you
[1:36:41] know the guy spent 12 hours putting new
[1:36:43] lungs in somebody I don't know if y'all
[1:36:45] know it but that's a pretty complicated
[1:36:47] system and and and they
[1:36:50] live uh it's kind of like a guy working
[1:36:52] on a Harley one time and a heart doctor
[1:36:54] walked by and and and he was watching
[1:36:56] the guy rebuild the head on the
[1:36:57] Harley-Davidson and the Harley Davidson
[1:37:00] mechanic looks up at him and had the
[1:37:01] piston in his hand he said I'm kind of
[1:37:03] like you ain't I doc he said we take the
[1:37:05] top off and take the heart out of it and
[1:37:08] fix it and get it running again he said
[1:37:09] no son you're not much like me he said
[1:37:12] the real difference is he said start
[1:37:13] that Harley and then do
[1:37:17] that and and and these doctors are doing
[1:37:20] this with people
[1:37:21] alive amen and this this young man walks
[1:37:24] in there he's about a about a about a 35
[1:37:26] telling me he's a doctor and we got up
[1:37:28] there and I was about ready to leave so
[1:37:29] brother Daryl said why don't we have a
[1:37:30] prayer together here and this this
[1:37:32] well-renowned surgeon you know he says
[1:37:35] I'd like to join you he reaches over and
[1:37:37] gets a hold of my hand calls me Pastor
[1:37:38] you know he said here Pastor Let Me Hold
[1:37:40] Your Hand she and we all stood there and
[1:37:41] held hands around and we prayed over the
[1:37:44] over the saint and asked the Lord to
[1:37:45] come in we got done and he looks over at
[1:37:47] me he said pastor listen he said now a
[1:37:49] good doctor knows this we can do the
[1:37:51] cutting he has to do the
[1:37:56] and any good
[1:37:57] doctor he'll have to tell you I can give
[1:38:00] you medicine but I can't heal
[1:38:03] you I can cut you but I can't heal the
[1:38:07] cut life is the
[1:38:09] healer is that right I don't want to
[1:38:12] take just a moment I want to thank this
[1:38:14] tape I say God bless you thank you for
[1:38:17] giving to the people of this Earth
[1:38:19] brother ma said doctors and hospitals
[1:38:22] was a love gift from God to
[1:38:25] you that's what he said he said it was
[1:38:28] God's helps it was a love gift to you
[1:38:31] and I thank God for our doctors now I
[1:38:33] know there's some crazy do around and
[1:38:35] preach we don't believe in doctors
[1:38:36] that's a lie amen I know there's
[1:38:39] fractions of Divine Healing that don't
[1:38:40] believe in doctors but that's not the
[1:38:42] one the Bible teaches if you want to
[1:38:44] study it now that comes from Christian
[1:38:47] Science and Christian Science was the
[1:38:49] one that promoted the idea that you
[1:38:52] don't need a doctor or a hos hospital
[1:38:53] they they promote that idea amen and
[1:38:56] that was what had went out in front of
[1:38:57] brother brandom in South Africa and had
[1:39:00] all the doctors mad at the Divine
[1:39:02] healers because they were they were
[1:39:04] trying to help the people and they were
[1:39:06] be called Devils because they were
[1:39:08] trying to help God's people and all they
[1:39:10] were trying to do was help somebody and
[1:39:12] when they heard William Brandon preach
[1:39:13] Divine Healing you know what happened
[1:39:15] the doctors said we believe in that kind
[1:39:17] of Divine Healing we believe in that
[1:39:19] kind of prayer for the sick I talked to
[1:39:22] people and took them to the campaigns
[1:39:24] the doctors believed in this kind of
[1:39:26] Divine Healing because it wasn't a bunch
[1:39:28] of fanatical crazy people it is a Divine
[1:39:32] truth tonight Divine Healing is a
[1:39:35] Biblical truth amen and it's God's grace
[1:39:38] to this generation that we would have a
[1:39:41] Prophet come and set it back the way it
[1:39:43] was supposed to
[1:39:47] be you see all healing comes from God if
[1:39:51] you're healed in a hospital it come from
[1:39:54] God if you're healed in a clinic come
[1:39:56] from God heal in the prayer line come
[1:39:58] from God all healing comes from God he
[1:40:02] is the Lord our healer the devil never
[1:40:06] healed
[1:40:08] nobody the devil never healed
[1:40:12] nobody I'll tell you this Moses put up
[1:40:15] this ins sign and he did it for sickness
[1:40:17] and for
[1:40:18] sin now brother bam said if there was an
[1:40:21] animal tearing at you tonight and had
[1:40:23] its claws down in your chest and was
[1:40:25] digging out your organs he said you
[1:40:27] don't have to run and get a knife to cut
[1:40:29] his claws off he say take something and
[1:40:32] hit it in the head and if you can hit it
[1:40:34] in the head you could kill the whole
[1:40:36] body he said and that's why that God
[1:40:39] offered an atonement for sickness is
[1:40:42] he's not just trying to cut off the
[1:40:44] sickness he would cut off the head of
[1:40:46] the one that was doing it and the thing
[1:40:49] behind sickness is sin
[1:40:53] that's why the serpent represented amen
[1:40:56] a Divine judgment but it brought healing
[1:40:59] isn't that beautiful if you deal with
[1:41:01] the sick the sin you've dealt with the
[1:41:04] sickness Jehovah Gyra could provide a
[1:41:07] healing for his people now when they
[1:41:10] looked upon this atonement the curse was
[1:41:13] lifted off of them atonement that can
[1:41:16] lift a now think about this God had him
[1:41:19] lift up a pole that if you looked at it
[1:41:22] the curse left you
[1:41:25] brother some somebody said well how do
[1:41:27] we break the spell in the days of Moses
[1:41:30] live look upon the on that serpent if
[1:41:32] you look the wrong wouldn't receive
[1:41:34] nothing if you look with faith you would
[1:41:36] receive your healing now now this became
[1:41:39] to them as our brother said this morning
[1:41:41] a tradition and they begin to idolize it
[1:41:44] but God always wanted his children to
[1:41:47] have healing that's right so then God
[1:41:49] moved that healing Angel off of that
[1:41:52] pole and he moved it to a pool of
[1:41:55] Bethesda which I've actually been there
[1:41:57] I was with a I was with them in Israel
[1:41:59] we went right up to that pool stood
[1:42:01] there by the door of the of the of the
[1:42:03] the porches and and seen the the pool of
[1:42:06] pesda Amen it's it's a powerful little
[1:42:09] thing standing there and we were with a
[1:42:10] guide and and and she was saying there's
[1:42:13] Greek mythology amen that an angel used
[1:42:16] to come to this pool I said wait a
[1:42:17] minute lady that's not Greek mythology
[1:42:20] that's the
[1:42:22] Bible she said well I'm a Jew I said it
[1:42:24] don't change
[1:42:26] truth it don't change truth and listen
[1:42:28] amen I probably a bad guy to take on a
[1:42:31] tour in Israel if you're going to talk
[1:42:32] about the Bible and not talk about the
[1:42:35] Bible amen I'll say this somebody said
[1:42:38] well amen how do you know what happened
[1:42:40] how how listen let me let me just say
[1:42:42] this to you are you ready to take
[1:42:43] science and education over written word
[1:42:47] and this Bible was proven to be have
[1:42:49] written all the way back in the days of
[1:42:51] Moses and Isaiah and Jeremiah and it
[1:42:54] outdates all of our scientists and it
[1:42:56] outdates all of our Educators and it out
[1:42:59] and all of a sudden they know more about
[1:43:01] creation than God they know more about
[1:43:03] the body than God they know more about
[1:43:05] everything than God I tell you this they
[1:43:08] don't know what they ought to know what
[1:43:09] they ought to know is that our God is
[1:43:12] the god of Abraham and he's still alive
[1:43:15] and he's still able to heal the
[1:43:18] sick yes sir at pesda there was an angel
[1:43:22] come down there in trouble trouble the
[1:43:23] waters you might not believe it but it's
[1:43:25] the truth anyhow and God would trouble
[1:43:27] the waters and they couldn't see that
[1:43:29] angel but they could God let him see
[1:43:32] something naturally isn't that amazing
[1:43:34] the god that we serve let him see the
[1:43:37] troubling the back this way and that way
[1:43:39] and when they looked upon it their
[1:43:41] Consciousness reged the angel is here
[1:43:44] amen and the Bible tells us that the
[1:43:46] first one that could get up Amen brother
[1:43:49] B called it the first moving of the
[1:43:51] water it's the first one that could run
[1:43:53] over and jump into that pool they would
[1:43:56] be healed is that amazing that they
[1:43:58] could be healed today we don't have that
[1:44:00] pool but human beings represent the
[1:44:03] water that was in that pool and when you
[1:44:05] start watching a meeting and the spirit
[1:44:07] begins to move through that meeting and
[1:44:10] you see the people begin to move under
[1:44:12] the supernatural listen to me let me let
[1:44:14] me tell you what's happening it's not
[1:44:17] mythology it's not emotion it's not just
[1:44:20] a bunch of rig say what you ought to do
[1:44:22] it's go and get in just step into the
[1:44:25] water and let the power of
[1:44:30] God come on Amen that was just one could
[1:44:33] do it in that day but now it's whosoever
[1:44:36] will whoever can come in and can I tell
[1:44:38] you something you ought to come on
[1:44:41] in somebody said brother way we don't
[1:44:44] know how it is brother R said back in
[1:44:45] his day he had a swimming a swimming
[1:44:47] hole you remember that he said me and a
[1:44:49] couple of my buddies he said we take off
[1:44:51] running on a hot summer day he said we
[1:44:53] first one in he said we jump up and he
[1:44:56] said if the water was pretty good we'd
[1:44:57] hold up one finger meaning it's good
[1:44:59] come on in boys he said we had a little
[1:45:02] saying the last one in I think we said
[1:45:05] rotten egg I don't remember what brother
[1:45:06] Bram said but the last a pair of them
[1:45:08] overhaul bib overhauls and he said I
[1:45:10] just had a nail up there for a button he
[1:45:13] said all I had to do is pull that nail
[1:45:15] he said and them old things that fall
[1:45:16] right around my right around my ankles
[1:45:18] he said I could jump right out of them I
[1:45:21] didn't have to stop and take my clothes
[1:45:22] off like them other boys I could just
[1:45:24] shim me out of them and jump in amen he
[1:45:27] come ready to get in and amen I think
[1:45:29] tonight amen we ought to come ready it
[1:45:32] ought to take us an hour to get into the
[1:45:34] spirit it ought to take two or three
[1:45:36] hours to get into the atmosphere of the
[1:45:39] Holy Ghost I say pull a pin and come and
[1:45:42] jump in to the pool of the power of the
[1:45:45] Holy Ghost can I say it the first one in
[1:45:49] tell somebody come on it's good in here
[1:45:53] come on in it's good in the pool there's
[1:45:56] Grace in the pool there's the power of
[1:45:58] God in the pool I say come on come on
[1:46:03] in water's
[1:46:05] good Hallelujah it feels
[1:46:08] good Hallelujah it feels good in the
[1:46:13] water Holy Ghost
[1:46:16] water come on young people we ain't
[1:46:19] going to leave you behind come on get in
[1:46:21] the water come on
[1:46:25] come on elders get the
[1:46:28] water healing in this water joy in this
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:36] water oh that angel was there and they
[1:46:40] could see it naturally moving you know
[1:46:43] what I'm talking about you see people
[1:46:46] getting in the spirit you ain't seen in
[1:46:47] years you see God moving on people that
[1:46:50] seem traditional and formal but all of a
[1:46:52] sudden they ain't no more
[1:46:53] more brother Ram said it's the natural
[1:46:56] showing the supernatural showing an
[1:46:59] angel has begun to move through now it's
[1:47:02] amazing because
[1:47:04] Jesus Will without be made whole brother
[1:47:07] B said 38 years he had laid there he
[1:47:09] said whatever he had wasn't going to
[1:47:10] kill him he said there was multitudes
[1:47:13] laying there so you would have thought
[1:47:15] Jesus would have picked somebody in a
[1:47:16] little worse situation but he said when
[1:47:19] they asked him about it he said I do
[1:47:21] nothing and until I see it with my
[1:47:23] father that was a predestinated moment
[1:47:26] for that man who had laid there 38 years
[1:47:29] with nobody to help him listen sometimes
[1:47:31] amen it's good there wasn't nobody to
[1:47:33] help you I know it made you mad there
[1:47:35] wasn't nobody sometimes it's good that
[1:47:38] there wasn't nobody to help you cuz if
[1:47:40] there ain't nobody helping you that's
[1:47:41] when Jesus comes by sometimes when
[1:47:44] you're laying alone amen and you ain't
[1:47:46] got nobody to help you in the pool you
[1:47:48] ain't got nobody to encourage you Al
[1:47:50] right in the middle of your worst
[1:47:52] Darkness
[1:47:53] that's when Jesus
[1:47:57] comes I'll tell you what he said he said
[1:47:59] I ain't got nobody to help me in he said
[1:48:01] every time the pool is troubled somebody
[1:48:03] beats me to
[1:48:05] it I tell you what if somebody beats me
[1:48:08] to it but listen he didn't have to wait
[1:48:09] for another season cuz there had been a
[1:48:11] changing of the Season amen the one the
[1:48:14] angel amen had come from was standing
[1:48:17] there talking to him it wasn't just
[1:48:20] another time amen the very God the very
[1:48:24] healer himself had come on the scene
[1:48:28] Jesus is that
[1:48:31] healer can you
[1:48:34] imagine when he looked at him and said
[1:48:37] Son thy sins be forgiven take up thy bed
[1:48:41] and
[1:48:42] walk and they said can a man forgive
[1:48:47] sins now think about this you know in
[1:48:49] the days of Jesus when he was on the
[1:48:51] earth that was okay with him healing
[1:48:54] people they just didn't believe he could
[1:48:56] save people they was okay with him doing
[1:48:59] Miracles and healing but they wasn't
[1:49:01] okay with him forgiving sins now in the
[1:49:04] age we're living in people's okay with
[1:49:07] believing he can heal he can save or he
[1:49:09] can deliver you from your sins but they
[1:49:11] just don't it's hard for people to
[1:49:13] believe it together it's hard for them
[1:49:16] to believe it when it comes together but
[1:49:17] God promises healing by atonement now if
[1:49:21] you turn up Isa Isaiah 53 let's read
[1:49:24] this Amen in Isaiah 53 and 1 for who
[1:49:27] hath believed I
[1:49:29] report and to whom is the arm of the
[1:49:32] Lord revealed who going to believe the
[1:49:37] report and to who is the arm of the Lord
[1:49:41] revealed for he shall grow up as tender
[1:49:44] plant root out of dry ground having no
[1:49:46] form com we shall see him there's no
[1:49:48] beauty that we should desire him he's
[1:49:50] despised a rejected a man a man of
[1:49:52] Sorrows are craned with grief and we hid
[1:49:55] as it wore our faces from him he was
[1:49:57] despised and we and carried our sorrows
[1:50:01] yet we did esteem him stricken and
[1:50:03] smitten of God and Afflicted but he was
[1:50:06] wounded for our
[1:50:07] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:50:10] iniquity and the chastisement of our
[1:50:12] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:50:17] we were
[1:50:19] healed now if you look into this in
[1:50:22] Isaiah 53 if you go to that fource verse
[1:50:25] surely he hath borne our Greece if you
[1:50:28] watch that Greek word it actually is
[1:50:31] rendered many places in the Old
[1:50:32] Testament to mean
[1:50:35] sickness for he hath borne our griefs is
[1:50:38] the English word but the Hebrew word
[1:50:41] behind it means
[1:50:43] sickness when he went because then it
[1:50:46] says and he carried our sorrows now the
[1:50:49] Hebrew behind that actually means not
[1:50:52] only Sorrows but the word is interpreted
[1:50:55] to mean pain sorrow grief or sadness it
[1:51:00] means the sorrow or the grief and pain
[1:51:04] that is because what is it it shows a
[1:51:06] pain that Isaiah was prophesying this
[1:51:08] atonement that he was talking about was
[1:51:10] more than just for the Salvation of the
[1:51:14] Soul it was for the agony and the pain
[1:51:17] of the children of almighty God it was
[1:51:20] for the grief and the sorrow it was for
[1:51:22] the sickness of our bodies amen he
[1:51:24] didn't just die for our sins he died for
[1:51:28] the I love how brother bam said it that
[1:51:30] young remember that young stow away on
[1:51:32] the ship and and an old fell was dying
[1:51:34] the captain was dying he said boy can
[1:51:36] you read me your Bible he said I'll read
[1:51:37] it to you like Mama read it to me amen
[1:51:40] he was wounded for Willie Pit's
[1:51:42] transgressions and he was bruised for
[1:51:44] Willie Pit's iniquities and the
[1:51:46] chastisement of Willie pu's peace was
[1:51:48] upon him and I'd like you to do me a
[1:51:50] favor would you have enough Faith to
[1:51:52] read my name in that amen so he asked
[1:51:55] him to read it different you see it's
[1:51:57] one thing for me to read this with
[1:51:59] Paul's name in it or with James or John
[1:52:01] or Peter or brother brandham or somebody
[1:52:04] that lived a hundred years ago amen but
[1:52:06] we're looking for men of God in this age
[1:52:08] that's got enough Faith to read it in a
[1:52:11] current present tense he was wounded for
[1:52:13] Wayne Lawson's transgressions he was
[1:52:15] wounded for Wayne Lawson's problems amen
[1:52:18] he was bruised for Wayne Lawson's
[1:52:20] iniquities
[1:52:24] come on brother Andrew he was wounded
[1:52:27] for Ron Spencer he was bruised for Ron
[1:52:29] Spencer by his Splats run Spencer was
[1:52:36] healed do you see it takes Faith to read
[1:52:39] it with your name in it this atonement
[1:52:41] got somebody's name on it it wasn't just
[1:52:43] a sacrifice amen a sacrifice just to be
[1:52:47] sacrificing it was a sacrifice to pay a
[1:52:49] payment for something like a lady got on
[1:52:51] the train one time she had just enough
[1:52:54] money to get on the train saved her
[1:52:56] pennies to get on the train three days
[1:52:58] come out of a room one day he knocked on
[1:53:00] the door and he said lady he said look
[1:53:02] he said I've noticed you're not coming
[1:53:03] out and eating he said are you okay
[1:53:05] something wrong with you she said sir
[1:53:06] you don't understand I spent my last
[1:53:09] dime to get this ticket to go see my
[1:53:11] daughter and I don't have any money for
[1:53:13] food I don't have any money amen for
[1:53:15] drinks I don't have any money for
[1:53:16] anything so I'm just going to stay in my
[1:53:18] room he said lady didn't they tell you
[1:53:20] the meals are included in the ticket
[1:53:23] and you see today people SW Jesus saved
[1:53:25] me but listen let me tell you healing is
[1:53:28] included in the ticket healing is
[1:53:31] included Tonight Deliverance is included
[1:53:33] tonight there was just one Calvary but
[1:53:36] it paid the debts of sin and sickness
[1:53:39] for every human
[1:53:43] being you know what I'm talking about
[1:53:45] I'm talking about a lady starving to
[1:53:47] death amen and they had to call Social
[1:53:49] Service and come in and they said amen
[1:53:52] amen man ain't you got any help and she
[1:53:53] said no I got one boy and he lives on
[1:53:55] the other side of the world he's
[1:53:57] something important somewhere and they
[1:53:58] said well surely if he's got money he'd
[1:54:01] help you honey she said I couldn't ask
[1:54:03] my boy to help me said he's my baby and
[1:54:06] and and and he'd probably do it if I'd
[1:54:07] ask him but I don't want to ask him for
[1:54:09] no favors amen and they said well does
[1:54:11] he ever send you anything said yeah he
[1:54:13] sends me some things and a prettiest

[1:55:44] a tree and but pull chunks out of it and
[1:55:46] they they wouldn't even allow a Roman
[1:55:48] citizen to be whipped with a whip amen

[1:55:54] they was going to whip the god of
[1:55:56] Glory can you imagine amen the God of
[1:55:59] all glory brother let me tell you you
[1:56:01] want to talk about a mighty conqueror it
[1:56:03] wasn't just that he died he innocent
[1:56:06] amen we how many of you ever liked it
[1:56:08] when mama pulled the belt out and just
[1:56:09] tore you up and you didn't do nothing
[1:56:11] why you would have fussed and hollered
[1:56:13] and mama I didn't do it and I ain't
[1:56:15] deserving of this and I and you'd have
[1:56:17] told her for a week amen but Jesus the
[1:56:19] Bible said he never opened his mouth and
[1:56:22] they beat him with a cat of nine tails
[1:56:24] you want to know why he never said he
[1:56:27] bore our sins and he bore our STS in
[1:56:30] other words he took upon him the sin of
[1:56:34] the
[1:56:38] world and he was so much God that he
[1:56:40] could stand there in a human body and
[1:56:42] allow them to slash him 39 stripes with
[1:56:45] that cat9 tells amen amen it's recorded
[1:56:48] in the Book of Psalms that his bones
[1:56:50] starred at him and his tongue leave to
[1:56:53] his mouth he lost so much blood that
[1:56:55] thirst would run upon him and they were
[1:56:57] beating him and they were beating him
[1:57:00] until amen I tell you this amen until
[1:57:02] every strip
[1:57:03] became until it become blood soaked you
[1:57:07] know why he took that
[1:57:09] beating for your healing that's right he
[1:57:13] took that beating for your healing so
[1:57:15] you'd have a right to say to the devil
[1:57:18] amen I'm Healed because Jesus took my
[1:57:20] stripes from do you do you recogn
[1:57:22] tonight that you don't have to ask the
[1:57:24] devil for
[1:57:25] permission my Bible tells me in Isaiah
[1:57:28] 53:4 amen that this was done to him and
[1:57:31] the book of Acts tells us Philip begin
[1:57:33] to tell the unic this was speaking of
[1:57:36] Jesus Jesus was the very one I'd say
[1:57:39] this to you tonight I'd like to make a
[1:57:40] proposition to you I'd like to propose
[1:57:43] to this congregation that everything you
[1:57:45] need for healing and salvation was paid
[1:57:48] for in the one act of Jesus Christ at
[1:57:50] Calvary I say that healing was bought
[1:57:53] and paid for by 39 stripes in his back
[1:57:56] and I say your sin was paid for when he
[1:57:58] went to calvary's cross and he hollered
[1:58:00] it is finished amen then today that
[1:58:03] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of
[1:58:06] the
[1:58:12] law you know it's amazing how this Bible
[1:58:14] is written in galatian Chapter 3 The
[1:58:17] Bible said Christ has redeemed us from
[1:58:18] the curse of the law being made a curse
[1:58:20] for us and curse it is te that hangeth
[1:58:23] on a tree I know sometimes you don't
[1:58:25] want to I know you know how you want to
[1:58:26] stop before you get there you're almost
[1:58:28] to Deliverance but you want to stop just

[1:58:35] Christianity but you don't want to get
[1:58:36] your deliver you know what I'm talking
[1:58:37] about amen but let me say this tonight
[1:58:40] don't stop short of this don't stop
[1:58:42] short of every Redemptive blessing Jesus
[1:58:44] Paid for you stand there till you get
[1:58:47] everything he gave listen he didn't stop
[1:58:50] short of Calvary don't you sto short of
[1:58:52] what it's bought for
[1:58:55] you can you imagine he's dragging that
[1:58:57] cross up the hill why he's dragging that
[1:59:00] cross up the hill you know my Bible says
[1:59:02] that there was a man named Simmon that
[1:59:03] stopped and helped him with that cross
[1:59:05] brother B said that's where the blessing
[1:59:07] come on the black
[1:59:08] race he said right there is where it
[1:59:11] happened amen and you know what's
[1:59:12] amazing God don't forget nothing y'all

[1:59:16] when that man helped him there on
[1:59:19] Calvary on calvary's Hill the Bible
[1:59:21] tells us he helped the Lord with that
[1:59:22] cross and when our Prophet was on the
[1:59:25] earth in Jonesburg Arkansas he was
[1:59:27] standing there one day and it was a
[1:59:29] little black girl coming from Memphis

[2:00:04] in there and he was sneaking around out
[2:00:06] there and nobody knew he was out there

[2:05:59] the duty of every Christian minister too
[2:06:03] brother M said if God called you to

[2:06:08] for the
[2:06:08] [Applause]
[2:06:10] sick do you know sisters you can lay
[2:06:12] hands on the sick and they be
[2:06:15] healed do you know that do you know
[2:06:17] there was mothers in brother Bam's
[2:06:19] meetings that prayed for little babies
[2:06:21] in the front of the pre-
[2:06:23] service a woman get it on her heart went
[2:06:26] over and prayed for a little baby and
[2:06:28] gave the seed up and said here you sit
[2:06:29] in my seat but I got to pray for you
[2:06:31] baby it's on my heart and she went up
[2:06:33] and sat in the balcony and when the
[2:06:34] prayer line came the woman brought the
[2:06:36] baby and front brother brandham he said
[2:06:38] lady the baby's already healed said
[2:06:41] there was a woman prayed for her and
[2:06:42] gave you the seat and she's sitting
[2:06:44] right up there in the balcony now God
[2:06:46] heard her prayer and Faith was answered
[2:06:49] but there might be a mother
[2:06:55] I believe it let me tell you what the
[2:06:58] Bible said the prayer of faith shall
[2:06:59] save the
[2:07:01] sick now this is biblical promises that
[2:07:04] Elijah was a man of light passion you
[2:07:06] said brother Wayne my I I I've seen
[2:07:08] problems in men do you know that Elijah
[2:07:10] had passions
[2:07:12] too he was a man of light passions but
[2:07:14] the Bible said he would open up the
[2:07:16] heavens and close the heavens with his
[2:07:17] prayer and so is it with the Church of
[2:07:20] the Living God we are able to close and
[2:07:22] open heaven with prayer do you see this
[2:07:25] is the word of faith that is preached
[2:07:27] can I can I say something to you tonight
[2:07:30] he is the high priest say something to
[2:07:32] you tonight he is the high
[2:07:36] priest of this profession you might be
[2:07:39] sitting here tonight and saying brother
[2:07:40] Wayne there's a lot being taught here
[2:07:42] you're saying a lot about healing but
[2:07:44] I'm
[2:07:45] sick now look God put this on my heart
[2:07:49] tonight and I I'm going to I'm going to
[2:07:51] reach way out here and I'm going to tell
[2:07:52] you something I believe that there will
[2:07:54] be miracles in this building
[2:07:58] tonight I'm not just preaching this
[2:08:01] because I thought it would be a good
[2:08:02] sermon but the Holy Spirit put it in my
[2:08:05] heart and told them that healing is a
[2:08:07] promise that belongs to them amen and
[2:08:10] God that I serve is still doing Miracles
[2:08:13] among the
[2:08:15] church do you see the Bible said he is a
[2:08:17] profession of Faith now God never did
[2:08:20] say did you feel it
[2:08:23] he said did you believe it now you say
[2:08:27] brother Wayne but I'm sitting here
[2:08:28] tonight and I'm as sick as I ever was I
[2:08:31] got as many problems as I've ever had
[2:08:34] well the prophet of God said but here it
[2:08:35] is what you need to do he said you just
[2:08:37] need to actually begin to say it I'm
[2:08:41] Healed he said and you need to start
[2:08:44] saying it over and over until you
[2:08:47] believe it all
[2:08:50] together now you say how do I do it he
[2:08:53] said just keep started in your heart now
[2:08:56] he said and in a little while something
[2:08:59] will begin to anchor down in
[2:09:01] you now Watch What Happens amen now now
[2:09:05] there's people that confess their
[2:09:06] healing but here's a prophet telling you
[2:09:09] while the inspiration is
[2:09:12] here to cause you to begin to confess
[2:09:16] for healing what is it the inspiration
[2:09:18] of the holy spirit is here to inspire
[2:09:20] you
[2:09:21] now watch when that inspiration begins
[2:09:23] to strike you if you're Afflicted and
[2:09:26] something is revealed to you that you're
[2:09:28] healed and you see it speak
[2:09:32] up and say I'm Healed if you're sitting
[2:09:35] in a meeting like this and you're sick
[2:09:37] in your body and inspiration begins to
[2:09:40] come over you and something says to you
[2:09:42] you're healed speak
[2:09:45] up I remember it brother Mark many years
[2:09:48] ago over in Brother Sam kender's
[2:09:50] meetings and that August meeting you're
[2:09:51] sitting back there with that cancer and
[2:09:53] you come running up to the platform you
[2:09:55] said brother amen that headache I've had
[2:09:57] all nights gone you said I believe
[2:09:59] something is happening amen what is he
[2:10:01] begin to speak up you know what what the
[2:10:04] devil don't want out of you he don't
[2:10:06] want you he wants you to suffer silently
[2:10:08] but God is saying when inspiration
[2:10:11] starts coming into your heart speak
[2:10:15] up come on bride why cry why cry speak
[2:10:21] speak this is an age of maturity speak
[2:10:24] about your healing speak about the
[2:10:26] confession of faith of your
[2:10:28] life when the inspiration begins to come
[2:10:32] you said brother Wayne I don't know I
[2:10:35] don't know if it's able to I've got too
[2:10:36] much I'm going to hurry here amen I
[2:10:38] don't know I don't know if I'm able to
[2:10:40] do it but the prophet of God said see it
[2:10:42] becomes a time that you've got to speak
[2:10:45] up do you see what Satan would like to
[2:10:47] do would get us so Afflicted that we
[2:10:50] will not confess our faith
[2:10:51] he would like to get us so Afflicted
[2:10:53] that we feel ashamed to talk about
[2:10:56] Divine Healing he wants to get you so
[2:10:58] Afflicted that you sit there and lay and
[2:11:00] think well I just can't confess this
[2:11:02] listen to me this Bible said with the
[2:11:04] stripes you are healed and you as a son
[2:11:07] or daughter of God have got a right to
[2:11:09] take every word of God put it on your
[2:11:12] lips and begin to confess it because it
[2:11:15] belongs to you I believe therefore I
[2:11:17] speak it come on you know he wasn't Paul
[2:11:20] wasn't talk about just the word Paul was
[2:11:23] talking about the distress of his own
[2:11:24] life he said I'm distressed and
[2:11:26] complexed on every side he said but I'm
[2:11:28] not forsaken of the Lord he said I
[2:11:31] believe it therefore I speak it what was
[2:11:33] he talking about lord gave me a sermon
[2:11:35] last year and amen I I'll give you the

[2:11:38] the sermon amen but it's Afflicted but
[2:11:41] not
[2:11:42] defeated now you might be afflicted but
[2:11:45] as long as there's faith in your heart
[2:11:48] you are not defeated as long as you
[2:11:50] believe this the scriptural promise you
[2:11:52] are not defeated faith is your
[2:11:57] Victory faith is your Victory When Faith
[2:12:00] starts coming down into your heart and
[2:12:02] you begin to test if our children behind
[2:12:05] let's not lay our young ones behind let
[2:12:07] me tell you young people what you got a
[2:12:08] right to do if you're looking at a
[2:12:10] scriptural promise that belongs to God I
[2:12:12] tell you what you do you begin to speak
[2:12:14] it and when inspiration comes to your
[2:12:16] heart I've got it if it's the Holy Ghost
[2:12:18] start speaking it if it's Deliverance
[2:12:20] start speaking speaking it if it's
[2:12:22] healing start speaking it and the devil

[2:12:31] many of you saved got the Holy Ghost
[2:12:33] have you still had Temptations look out
[2:12:35] across this crowd Elders have you ever
[2:12:37] had Temptation since you got saved now
[2:12:40] some people will say you the idea once
[2:12:42] you get saved there's no more Temptation
[2:12:44] they lying to
[2:12:45] you but there is Temptation behind
[2:12:48] salvation but because you believe in
[2:12:50] salv
[2:12:51] and you call it a ly vanity and you say
[2:12:54] what I want is to serve God what I want
[2:12:57] is to serve the
[2:12:59] Bible come on then it's the same thing

[2:13:04] and still have symptoms you could be
[2:13:07] healed completely healed and still pain
[2:13:10] comes into your body but God is looking
[2:13:12] for somebody that will ignore the
[2:13:15] symptoms that will call it lying

[2:13:19] word of God
[2:13:22] I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm
[2:13:25] saved I'm saved by an atonement of the
[2:13:29] blood of Jesus Christ I'm not saved
[2:13:31] because I feel like it I'm not healed
[2:13:34] because I feel like it I'm Healed
[2:13:36] because of Calvary I'm saved because of
[2:13:40] Calvary oh it's the blood the blood

[2:13:50] behind forol folks when you begin to
[2:13:53] testify I tell you what brother random
[2:13:54] said it was he said it was like taking a
[2:13:57] steak he said and you drive down that
[2:13:59] steak and maybe you do it right here

[2:14:03] something from God take a steak out of
[2:14:05] your purse put it on the ground and
[2:14:07] drive it in and every time after you
[2:14:10] leave this building Satan says you
[2:14:12] didn't get healed you didn't get saved
[2:14:15] you take that devil and if you need to
[2:14:17] you drive right back down to Virginia

[2:14:22] you say devil right there right there is
[2:14:25] where it happened right there is where
[2:14:27] it took place right there is where it
[2:14:30] happened

[2:14:35] in the Blessed promise of the power of
[2:14:37] the Holy
[2:14:38] [Applause]
[2:14:41] Ghost you say well I don't believe in
[2:14:43] that stuff God
[2:14:46] does one day he said I'm going to heal
[2:14:48] my children I'm going to save my
[2:14:50] children and he drove a steak in the
[2:14:52] ground and put his son on the steak and
[2:14:55] by the blood of that sacrifice now every
[2:14:59] one of you can tell the devil right
[2:15:02] there at Calvary Satan that's where God
[2:15:04] saved me that's where God healed me
[2:15:07] that's where God said listen I don't
[2:15:09] know if you're hearing me it's not just
[2:15:11] you saying you're healed God says you're
[2:15:14] healed a problems
[2:15:17] everywhere come on there's problems
[2:15:20] everywhere ask balam about it he spends
[2:15:24] his life studying with B to find some
[2:15:26] problem in the church but you know
[2:15:28] what's matter with Bao and Bam they're
[2:15:30] looking at the wrong thing they're
[2:15:32] looking at the problem but God raised up
[2:15:35] a Brazen Serpent and said look at
[2:15:39] this Hallelujah let's lift up Calvary
[2:15:42] and say to the people look at
[2:15:47] this I know calvary's a long ways from
[2:15:49] you tonight and you're saying brother
[2:15:51] Wayne how and then can I see something
[2:15:53] natural amen that's why there's five
[2:15:55] manifestations of the third pole that's
[2:15:57] why God let a sex born man amen create
[2:16:01] squirrels by the spoken word that's why
[2:16:03] he let him speak to a tumor and let him
[2:16:06] speak to a mountain and raise a dead
[2:16:08] fish the curse has
[2:16:12] ended woo glory be to God by the power
[2:16:17] of the blood as Moses lifted it up it's
[2:16:20] time for you and I to lift up the son of
[2:16:22] man testimonies of the blinded eyes

[2:16:46] what was in the newspaper we're going to
[2:16:48] or ignore all that come see me I got
[2:16:51] hundreds of newspaper articles where a
[2:16:53] prophet went up through Canada amen and
[2:16:55] and I was actually trying to do this and
[2:16:58] amen it was it was fruitless actually
[2:17:00] because I was trying to figure out with
[2:17:01] Elisha and Elijah you know there was
[2:17:03] double Miracles it was like 8 and 16 I
[2:17:05] think amen and I was thinking about
[2:17:06] brother brandom and I was going to
[2:17:07] compare the book of Acts to brother
[2:17:09] Ram's Ministry and I was going to see if
[2:17:10] it was double but I found out just in
[2:17:13] one year of 1947 after the angel
[2:17:15] appeared to him there was over
[2:17:17] 150,000 outstanding miracles in one year
[2:17:21] and the bi and and and and the newspaper
[2:17:24] said and they're too numberous to put in
[2:17:27] the books in one year in
[2:17:30] 1947 you know what brother Ram said he
[2:17:33] said God did more in my Ministry than he
[2:17:36] did in his own Amen in Jerusalem but you
[2:17:40] know this Bible said yet a little while
[2:17:43] and the world see me no more but ye

[2:20:48] amen you've got a right to say to the
[2:20:51] devil wrong address and I say to the
[2:20:54] devil tonight I'm prayer line there's a
[2:20:56] Powerhouse of Sons and Daughters of God
[2:20:58] and here Satan take your
[2:21:08] leave listen if you're looking at your
[2:21:10] symptoms tonight you got to write for
[2:21:12] your for your heavy heartedness and your
[2:21:14] grief and if you're looking for your
[2:21:15] symptoms tonight you got a reason to
[2:21:17] walk around and maybe think that nothing
[2:21:19] could happen but let me say something to
[2:21:21] you tonight if you was able tonight to
[2:21:24] look above your
[2:21:26] circumstances and you were able to look
[2:21:28] around and begin to see what God has
[2:21:30] done for you and you begin to be able to
[2:21:33] confess the confession of God and you
[2:21:35] don't look at your symptoms do you know
[2:21:37] that you could right now begin to begin
[2:21:40] to praise God for a
[2:21:45] he oh I know I know what the devil's up
[2:21:48] to
[2:21:50] he puts some Fanatics around praise so
[2:21:53] that people begin to get fearful of
[2:21:55] Praise but that ain't nothing but an Old
[2:21:57] Devil because the devil knows that when
[2:22:01] the children of God begin to praise God
[2:22:03] the Bible said he would inhabit the
[2:22:07] praise of his people listen if there's
[2:22:10] no Spirit quing down your praise listen
[2:22:13] it's the
[2:22:14] devil I don't have to ask you a name I
[2:22:17] don't have to ask you what church I can
[2:22:19] tell you it come from the pits of hell
[2:22:23] because the devil don't want you
[2:22:25] praising God because when a saint begins
[2:22:28] to praise God God comes right down do
[2:22:31] you know the Bible actually says that
[2:22:33] God inhabits the praise of his people
[2:22:34] and the word habit actually means he
[2:22:37] sets up a throne so you you look around
[2:22:40] at this and you look at a situation
[2:22:41] tonight your sick body and you say
[2:22:43] brother Wayne Amen I I I can't see any
[2:22:46] way out of this and I'm just sick and my
[2:22:48] mind's sick and my body's sick and
[2:22:49] everything sick let me tell you how do I
[2:22:52] do it you begin to lift your hands and
[2:22:54] you begin to praise God and all of a
[2:22:56] sudden you just set a seat down for the
[2:23:00] almighty God and God himself will come
[2:23:04] all the way out of Glory to come down in
[2:23:07] the church when you begin to praise God
[2:23:10] you begin to put God in your
[2:23:13] situation you know what that is when
[2:23:15] that begin to praise God like that it
[2:23:17] begins to invite
[2:23:20] you begin to invite God into your
[2:23:22] situation how many wants God in it how
[2:23:25] many wants God into it let me let me
[2:23:26] give you some Bible I'm closing let me
[2:23:28] give you some Bible right here do you
[2:23:30] know praise is an actual weapon against
[2:23:32] the
[2:23:33] devil do y'all know it do you know
[2:23:35] praise is involved in Temple Worship in
[2:23:38] the Bible that he literally had 4,000
[2:23:41] Levites
[2:23:42] handpicked just to play instruments and
[2:23:45] sing 4,000 of them the only job they had
[2:23:50] was to play instruments and sing because
[2:23:54] praising God Amen brought the presence
[2:23:57] of God upon the scene one day they and
[2:24:01] when that Army began to come amen the
[2:24:02] man of God the king went down to the
[2:24:04] house of God and begin to pray and said
[2:24:06] Lord we the Seed of Abraham we're your
[2:24:08] children you said Lord and if we would
[2:24:10] pray that you would hear us from heaven
[2:24:12] and God began to speak back to him he
[2:24:14] said this is not your battle this battle
[2:24:17] belongs to the lord and there was a
[2:24:19] great company coming against him and God
[2:24:22] said to him you send out the
[2:24:25] Levites amen now there was certain
[2:24:27] Levites that David had picked that the
[2:24:30] only thing they done was praise and
[2:24:34] worship and he said I tell you what you
[2:24:36] do you appoint them and put them out
[2:24:39] front and when they begin to move out
[2:24:42] front of the church the Bible tells us
[2:24:44] that by the time the army of the Lord
[2:24:47] got there amen all of their enemies was
[2:24:50] all already dead they killed their Enemy
[2:24:53] by praising
[2:24:56] God do you know when you begin to praise
[2:24:59] God sicknesses begin to die when you
[2:25:02] begin to praise God anxiety begins to
[2:25:05] die when you begin to praise God and you
[2:25:08] say God is my peace amen nervous Spirits
[2:25:11] begin to leave the
[2:25:13] building I say in the name of the Lord
[2:25:16] Jesus Satan you have been defeated thou
[2:25:19] nervous spirit I rebuke you by the power
[2:25:22] of the Living God set her
[2:25:26] free oh look at the anointing of God as
[2:25:29] people begin to praise Him amen all of a
[2:25:32] sudden things begin to
[2:25:35] shift in the Supernatural Realms things
[2:25:37] begin to what is it it's because that
[2:25:40] praise becomes a weapon to the believer
[2:25:43] when you begin to praise him you begin
[2:25:46] to invite him into your
[2:25:48] situation I say tonight that his name is
[2:25:53] Jehovah
[2:25:54] Gyra but his name is also Jehovah
[2:26:01] RI I'm sitting here today as a witness
[2:26:03] to
[2:26:05] you I come to you tonight not
[2:26:09] just as someone who has read about these
[2:26:12] things but after years of traveling and
[2:26:16] preaching and proclaiming the power of
[2:26:19] the atoning power Jesus Christ we have
[2:26:22] seen
[2:26:24] Miracles we have seen the anointing of
[2:26:26] God look look I I was just texting
[2:26:28] brother Donnie Reagan this morning he
[2:26:30] said right in the middle of the service
[2:26:32] he said one of the Saints passed and
[2:26:33] died right back in the back of the
[2:26:35] church said the saints went back there
[2:26:37] and put their hands on them and God
[2:26:38] raised them up from the
[2:26:40] dead people say where is the god that
[2:26:43] raises the dead well the other day he
[2:26:45] was out there at Happy Valley
[2:26:52] where's the god that heals TB where's
[2:26:55] the god of Elijah wasn't that what
[2:26:57] Elijah said I don't just want the
[2:26:59] reignment was the god of
[2:27:02] Elijah brother said that God of Elijah

[2:27:10] witness I got a three-year-old grandbaby
