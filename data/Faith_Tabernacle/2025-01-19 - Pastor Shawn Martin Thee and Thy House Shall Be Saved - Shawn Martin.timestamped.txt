[49:19] prayer and uh but uh anyways we sure
[49:23] love Judah been a great blessing here at
[49:27] the church and and um but uh also we're
[49:32] going to dismiss the communion service
[49:35] uh this evening uh due to the weather
[49:38] and uh don't know what it's going to end
[49:41] up being so we'll try to have it Lord
[49:43] willing next uh next Sunday uh evening
[49:48] and uh that and so as I um said
[49:51] Wednesday we had a a good trip uh in uh
[49:55] in Africa
[49:57] and uh uh the Lord seemed to to move
[50:02] just in a special way and I know it was
[50:05] a um kind of a sudden thing for me of
[50:10] going and uh uh but uh the Lord uh
[50:14] helped us and and uh just uh seemed to
[50:19] uh speak to the people in all the
[50:22] services and they had uh two Services
[50:26] the Friday we got there late late
[50:29] Thursday and they're 8 hours ahead of us
[50:34] and so uh but we got there late and at
[50:38] Thursday night and at the airport and
[50:41] then had to drive a good hour or so to
[50:44] the hotel so we didn't get you know to
[50:46] bed probably till
[50:47] 2: um and then um the next day in the
[50:52] afternoon is when the service started so
[50:55] uh they had two services Friday and then
[50:57] four
[50:58] Services uh Saturday and Sunday and the
[51:01] first service started at 6 and um and
[51:06] these were full-blown Services these
[51:07] ain't just little you know 40 minute
[51:11] sessions you know these
[51:13] were full-blown services and and the
[51:17] people I mean they they pulled every
[51:20] service it was um incredible they they
[51:23] they love the Lord and and I know they
[51:26] were re tired but um they they were
[51:29] ready to have church so uh anyways we uh
[51:34] seen some results out of it a young
[51:37] man um he um uh he wanted my number as
[51:44] we were leaving the last service and so
[51:47] I'd given it to him and he had asked um
[51:49] later on he said who's William brandham
[51:53] and um so I said you've never heard of
[51:55] brother brandham he said no he said it's
[51:57] my first
[51:58] time at the at the the the meeting and
[52:03] uh said oh okay so uh uh I didn't say
[52:07] anything else and he said I really want
[52:10] to know I want to know who brother
[52:12] brandham is or who William brandom is
[52:14] and so um we've been discussing back and
[52:18] forth and and send him a bunch of
[52:21] scriptures to read and um so just
[52:24] praying that something will Enlighten
[52:27] him I've helped him download The Table
[52:29] app and he's been listening to some of
[52:32] the sermons that I've asked told him to
[52:34] listen to and and so just believing God
[52:37] to to do something in that young man's
[52:40] life and um uh different different uh
[52:45] testimonies um the young man that um uh
[52:49] he was
[52:51] um well in in the last uh couple
[52:55] services we we had a young man driving
[52:58] us back and forth to the hotel to the
[53:00] meeting and and um that last service you
[53:05] know after after the last service he
[53:07] just cried and um as we were going to
[53:11] the hotel and um we went and ate with
[53:15] the pastor the next day Monday and that
[53:19] young man was there and another young
[53:21] man and anyway the the the the young man
[53:25] the driver he he had went out to answer
[53:28] a phone call and the pastor say you know
[53:31] that that young man right there he says
[53:34] God's done something to him he said uh
[53:37] he said I'm about giving up on him and
[53:40] uh he said he's just hard and he said
[53:42] I've worked done all I know to do and he
[53:45] said I've just about just you know told
[53:49] him I I can't do anything for him and uh
[53:52] he said but when he come home or dropped
[53:55] you all off and he come picked us up he
[53:57] said that that young man cried and cried
[54:00] just all the way you know home and he
[54:03] said he's changed there's something
[54:05] about him that's really changed and uh
[54:08] so we're thankful for the Lord uh for
[54:11] these things and believing that God's
[54:13] still working among his people
[54:17] amen uh but uh Romans the 8th chapter
[54:21] and the um 16th verse
[54:26] uh let's see here it's actually
[54:30] um I have got the
[54:34] wrong uh scripture
[54:38] down amen I'm going to have to look up
[54:41] in my
[54:43] concordance um and maybe some of you
[54:45] would know the scripture where it says
[54:47] the just shall live by
[54:50] faith maybe
[54:53] uh um praise the Lord
[54:57] well isn't the Lord
[54:59] good praise the
[55:02] Lord ABC
[55:05] DF G look at my concordance here
[55:10] and uh for some reason I thought I had
[55:13] it
[55:14] down and
[55:17] um what is it R Romans
[55:21] 117 all
[55:24] right let's look at that then
[55:30] praise the Lord
[55:32] yep so let's start at uh Romans
[55:39] 1:16 it says for I am not ashamed of the
[55:42] gospel of
[55:44] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[55:47] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[55:50] the Jew first and also to the Greek for
[55:53] therein is the righteousness of God
[55:56] revealed from Faith to
[55:58] Faith as it is written the just shall
[56:02] live by faith amen could we just bow our
[56:06] heads in a word of prayer
[56:09] father we're so thankful that we have
[56:13] your promise that we can rest upon it
[56:16] Lord thank you for bringing us here
[56:19] safely father and we're under
[56:21] expectation for you to be with us to
[56:25] speak to us us and not only just to
[56:29] speak but Lord your creative power to
[56:33] affect us Lord you see every need that
[56:36] is present and I pray that you would
[56:38] meet every need Lord build our faith up
[56:41] higher Lord father may we come under a
[56:44] greater expectation for you to fulfill
[56:47] your word we ask it father in Jesus
[56:51] Christ's name amen you can have your SE
[56:56] seats I um I've been trying to
[57:01] uh uh
[57:04] recuperate and uh I don't think we got
[57:08] too much sleep when we were up there
[57:12] and and so anyway um fighting a whatever
[57:18] and uh so it's whatever I've been
[57:21] fighting it's put me in bed for a couple
[57:23] days but um we uh believe in the Lord
[57:28] just to help us but um so the just shall
[57:33] live by faith
[57:34] and I guess if if I got a title it would
[57:38] be thee and thy
[57:40] house shall be
[57:42] saved and
[57:45] um um you know faith is is the the
[57:50] foundation of our life of the Christian
[57:53] walk as you know as the prophet would
[57:56] tell us we are to choose by faith
[57:59] we when we come to the house of God we
[58:02] come by faith we when we worship we
[58:06] worship by faith that's that's the way
[58:08] we are to worship we are to uh sing by
[58:12] faith we are to testify by faith we are
[58:15] even to amen the word by faith
[58:18] everything is by faith and living by
[58:23] faith isn't something new uh yet it does
[58:27] seem strange especially in the age that
[58:29] we're living in because it's um it's
[58:33] harder than any age for people to live
[58:36] by faith uh because it's already been
[58:39] predicted that that Faith would be slow
[58:43] in this
[58:44] age and the reason why it's slow is
[58:47] brother rown said we've had so much
[58:50] scientific
[58:52] teaching and um so much scientific
[58:57] teaching and uh he says we have drawn
[59:00] the people away from faith and and so
[59:04] and and because of this uh the
[59:07] Supernatural is hidden from the people
[59:10] because science science and education
[59:13] does not produce the
[59:15] supernatural uh it it looks to reasoning
[59:18] it looks for proof it looks for natural
[59:22] things and and so uh it has kept the
[59:25] supernat away from the people and it's
[59:28] drawn the people away from faith and so
[59:33] uh uh brother Brown says Divine Healing
[59:35] today is not for the unbelievers it's
[59:39] for those who believe see the baptism of
[59:42] the Holy Spirit today is not for
[59:44] unbelievers it's for those who believe
[59:46] Jesus died for believers not for
[59:49] unbelievers it's for those who believe
[59:52] the supernatural follows who
[59:54] Supernatural minded that's right when
[59:57] the hungering and thirsting see when you
[59:59] you got an expectancy when you read
[1:00:02] God's word and expect to see God perform
[1:00:05] what he said he would do God will do it
[1:00:09] can you say that with me God will do it
[1:00:13] and and so then if you have faith then
[1:00:17] then you'll be Supernatural minded and
[1:00:21] will expect the supernatural to happen
[1:00:24] so that's why we get away we must get
[1:00:27] away uh uh the the message is to get us
[1:00:30] away from scientific things and from our
[1:00:33] reasoning and get us back to a true
[1:00:36] faith in God so that the supernatural
[1:00:40] can work in our lives you see all hell
[1:00:43] is against this message uh how many
[1:00:46] believe that amen it's it's against the
[1:00:50] message and that's what brother Bri said
[1:00:52] it's it's against the truth and and
[1:00:55] because uh um um it's uh it's it's it's
[1:01:01] the thing that God has established that
[1:01:03] if we could ever ever believe in that's
[1:01:06] that's the channel that God can work
[1:01:08] through and and so he's against it and
[1:01:12] and and so if he's against the message
[1:01:14] then all hell is against us who believe
[1:01:18] the message is the truth and and it's
[1:01:21] because that you are believing the right
[1:01:23] thing and so we we feel the pressures we
[1:01:27] we see the things that are are are going
[1:01:30] on around us and God is or Satan is
[1:01:34] trying to do everything he can possible
[1:01:37] to keep the promises of God from being
[1:01:40] effective in your life and that's just
[1:01:43] the truth uh um and we must realize that
[1:01:47] it to to to to look at the mountains to
[1:01:50] look at the trials to look at the
[1:01:53] obstacles in our life and to think that
[1:01:55] God is sending them our way to destroy
[1:01:58] us that's the wrong way to look at
[1:02:02] things uh uh uh but if we could look at
[1:02:06] it that it is Satan doing his best to
[1:02:10] keep the word of God from being
[1:02:13] effective in our lives it's Satan that
[1:02:16] is trying to keep us from being true
[1:02:18] Sons and Daughters of God but yet it's
[1:02:22] it's it's giving us an opportunity to
[1:02:24] exercise our our Authority as Sons and
[1:02:28] Daughters of God so all hell is against
[1:02:31] this message because it's the truth and
[1:02:34] and and this message is what has
[1:02:37] awakened uh us up the bride up and and
[1:02:41] we know that uh we're not waiting to be
[1:02:43] awakened the the the the the message has
[1:02:48] awakened this bride this message
[1:02:51] according to uh Ezekiel uh his vision
[1:02:56] uh is the fourth stage of the
[1:02:59] restoration of of the Valley of the dry
[1:03:02] bones and uh uh it's a message of life
[1:03:07] and this message is what put life in US
[1:03:11] amen so we aren't some insignificant
[1:03:15] downtrodden people amen uh and we if if
[1:03:20] you're thinking that way then you're not
[1:03:23] catching the revelation of this message
[1:03:27] because the message has not uh has has
[1:03:31] has made us realize the truth of what we
[1:03:35] are we're not going to be sons of God we
[1:03:38] are sons of God now amen we're we're not
[1:03:42] going to make it we've already made it
[1:03:46] amen and and so if we could look at
[1:03:50] it uh uh we're we're we're not just some
[1:03:54] uh insignificant people and the message
[1:03:57] has made us realize this truth and not
[1:04:01] only has it made us realize the truth
[1:04:04] but it has changed our thought pattern
[1:04:08] to where we don't think like
[1:04:10] insignificant downtrodden people we we
[1:04:14] don't let Just smudy Thoughts come into
[1:04:17] our mind and dwell on them and you know
[1:04:21] I I understand we can get complexes and
[1:04:23] we can get all kinds of things in our
[1:04:25] life life and but but the message cleans
[1:04:28] a lot of this stuff out and and to where
[1:04:31] we can look at who we are based upon the
[1:04:34] word of God Amen now and and I hope just
[1:04:38] to make some sense to you today but the
[1:04:42] prophet said Christ in the true church
[1:04:45] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[1:04:48] now if you look at the book of Acts they
[1:04:50] were a powerful people uh they done
[1:04:54] signs and wonders and in so much that
[1:04:57] that uh uh they said that these men
[1:05:00] turned the world upside down and and and
[1:05:04] just at the the the shadow of Peter
[1:05:08] Crossing uh over uh the sick uh they
[1:05:11] they were healed and and Devils cast out
[1:05:14] the lame walked and and and and you know
[1:05:18] the the the the the the story of the of
[1:05:20] the acts well Christ in the true church
[1:05:23] today is a continuation of the book of
[1:05:26] Acts can you say Amen now the prophet
[1:05:30] says now Satan knows that if the people
[1:05:32] get the true revelation of the true
[1:05:37] church and what she is and what she
[1:05:40] stands for and that she can do the
[1:05:42] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[1:05:46] Army can you say Amen see the true
[1:05:49] Revelation comes from the message of the
[1:05:51] hour amen and it's not just listening to
[1:05:55] the the tapes with the hearing of our uh
[1:05:58] natural ears but it's it's God revealing
[1:06:01] to us the Revelation lays in in the word
[1:06:05] the Revelation lays in the message and
[1:06:08] and if we could really get it down in
[1:06:10] our heart then what what what is the
[1:06:13] revelation of this message we can quote
[1:06:15] quotes we can we can show our
[1:06:17] spirituality and and and and you know uh
[1:06:21] uh uh can get where we just debate one
[1:06:23] another with quotes and scripture and
[1:06:25] all this thing but that don't mean
[1:06:28] anything we need the true revelation of
[1:06:31] the true church amen and and and how
[1:06:35] many believes you're part of that true
[1:06:36] church well I believe that by one Spirit
[1:06:39] you're you're baptized into one body the
[1:06:42] true church and and so if if we could
[1:06:45] get a revelation of the true church what
[1:06:48] she is what you are see and what you
[1:06:52] stand for and that you can do the Great
[1:06:55] G works can you say amen yeah amen you
[1:06:59] can do the Greater Works then you'll be
[1:07:01] an invincible Army amen that's right
[1:07:05] amen so you got to put yourself in there
[1:07:08] and if he says if they can if they get a
[1:07:10] true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:07:13] within the framework of the Christian
[1:07:14] church and by God's spirit discern and
[1:07:17] withstand that Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:07:20] will be powerless before her so this is
[1:07:23] what God done by sending us the message
[1:07:25] message is to get us a true
[1:07:28] revelation of what you truly are you are
[1:07:32] part of this church you are the true
[1:07:34] church then you must have that
[1:07:36] revelation of what you are what you can
[1:07:39] do that you can do the Greater Works
[1:07:41] that you're not the victim you're the
[1:07:43] Victor that you don't have to nut down
[1:07:46] to the devil Satan will be rendered
[1:07:48] powerless before you if you can really
[1:07:51] have that true revelation of Who You Are
[1:07:56] now you know the other day just thinking
[1:07:58] of situations that I need the Lord to
[1:08:00] change and uh you know that's just
[1:08:02] weight on my heart for for a while you
[1:08:06] know and and um and while riding on the
[1:08:10] plane back home I I just got to thinking
[1:08:13] about these things and uh uh the
[1:08:16] situations and just began to weep uh
[1:08:20] before the Lord just um asking him to
[1:08:23] change what what would seem to be
[1:08:26] impossible situations and and things and
[1:08:30] you know you you just reach a a feeling
[1:08:33] of helplessness to do anything about it
[1:08:36] you know and and um but but as I was
[1:08:40] just thinking there and praying and and
[1:08:44] um it it just I was just reminded of
[1:08:47] where Jesus said all things are possible
[1:08:51] to them that believe how many believes
[1:08:54] that all things are possible so he
[1:08:57] doesn't he doesn't categorize situations
[1:09:01] one to another he just says all things
[1:09:04] are possible to them that believe so you
[1:09:07] can't measure the
[1:09:09] impossibilities uh and you can't rate
[1:09:12] situations and circumstances all things
[1:09:15] are possible to them that believe and so
[1:09:18] what what would seem so
[1:09:20] impossible uh
[1:09:23] uh then we find that if if I can believe
[1:09:29] amen then then it's no longer impossible
[1:09:32] it becomes possible because I can
[1:09:36] believe for it you you understand what
[1:09:37] I'm saying and so then then the
[1:09:40] situation is not hopeless because of
[1:09:43] Faith so then the prophet would say in
[1:09:46] one place if the doctor says you're
[1:09:48] going to die with a Cancer and that's
[1:09:49] all he knows about he said or he said
[1:09:52] that's all he knows about have faith
[1:09:54] everybody say have faith now we preach
[1:09:57] Faith all the time but you you can't you
[1:09:59] can't underestimate Faith you you can't
[1:10:02] there there's just no way you can over
[1:10:04] overdo Faith amen because if the doctor
[1:10:08] says you're going to die with the cancer
[1:10:10] that's all he knows about have faith and
[1:10:14] it'll change the situation for you see
[1:10:18] in another place Jesus in his church
[1:10:20] today would be just as powerless as your
[1:10:23] faith is now think of that uh the
[1:10:27] creator of Heaven and Earth and and the
[1:10:30] Bible says he's the same yesterday today
[1:10:32] and forever so the god that wrote back
[1:10:35] the Red Sea the god that changed water
[1:10:37] into wine the god that that multiplied
[1:10:40] The Fish and Loaves the god that walked
[1:10:42] on the sea and and the god that that
[1:10:45] looked at the the the waves and the
[1:10:48] winds and and said peace be still and it
[1:10:51] all obeyed him at his voice at his words
[1:10:55] that God would be just as powerless as
[1:10:59] your faith is amen and yet just as
[1:11:03] powerful as your faith is he'd be
[1:11:06] limited to whatever God would tell him
[1:11:08] to do that he could do see so so your
[1:11:12] faith can make God powerless in your
[1:11:14] life it doesn't mean it doesn't change
[1:11:17] his Essence it doesn't change his nature
[1:11:19] it doesn't change his ability but it
[1:11:22] stops him from having a a Divine work in
[1:11:26] in our lives when we can't believe God
[1:11:29] for everything see see so so God put us
[1:11:33] here and and he allows things to come
[1:11:35] our way not to defeat us not so we could
[1:11:39] just be broken and and destroyed and
[1:11:42] Shipwrecked he he puts it there so he
[1:11:44] can show himself that he's still the
[1:11:47] same God that can speak to the storm
[1:11:50] he's still the same God that could speak
[1:11:52] to the mountain he's still the same God
[1:11:54] but he wants to take your voice to do
[1:11:59] it on
[1:12:02] now so God is God is able to show him
[1:12:06] strong himself strong in our behalf by
[1:12:09] our
[1:12:10] faith and and so now brother brm said
[1:12:13] God hates a powerless
[1:12:15] religion he hates it and and if you want
[1:12:19] to see a powerless religion look at all
[1:12:22] the the the Christendom today with
[1:12:26] denominations or any other religion it's
[1:12:28] a powerless religion and and any
[1:12:32] religion today that hasn't got Christ in
[1:12:34] it is poweress he says and and and so
[1:12:37] then if he hates a poweress religion
[1:12:40] then why would God choose us select us
[1:12:45] predestinate us for this age amen and
[1:12:48] yet we can't have that ability Amen to
[1:12:52] produce a living God Among Us see so so
[1:12:56] then then then he he wouldn't waste his
[1:12:59] time in that but knowing that you would
[1:13:02] believe knowing that that you would take
[1:13:04] him at his word he's not worried about
[1:13:07] losing you he's not worried about you
[1:13:11] know the Satan been able to snatch you
[1:13:13] away from
[1:13:14] him he he predestinated you for this age
[1:13:19] see and and so now you cannot have fa a
[1:13:23] man cannot have faith if he doesn't
[1:13:24] believe in the Supernatural because God
[1:13:27] is Supernatural do you believe that so
[1:13:30] so to have faith in God you have to
[1:13:32] believe in the Supernatural amen see and
[1:13:36] the only way for any man to approach God
[1:13:39] Is by faith for the Bible says he that
[1:13:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:13:44] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:13:47] diligently seek him ain't that right now
[1:13:50] notice what brother brand says if we
[1:13:52] lose faith if we lose faith and we will
[1:13:56] never get a prayer answered by God our
[1:14:00] prayers are ened and we will get nowhere
[1:14:03] ain't that right now listen church you
[1:14:06] can lose money and that ain't going to
[1:14:08] affect your prayer it ain't going to
[1:14:11] affect the power of your prayer you you
[1:14:13] can lose your your materialistic things
[1:14:16] and that will not affect the power of
[1:14:18] prayer but if you lose Faith then your
[1:14:22] prayer becomes powerless before
[1:14:26] God can you say
[1:14:30] Amen so we we find that we must have
[1:14:33] faith don't ever let the devil take away
[1:14:35] your faith don't ever look look look at
[1:14:39] the mountain as as being too big like
[1:14:43] like those uh uh that come back from
[1:14:46] from the promised land the 10 spies and
[1:14:49] they saw the Giants and they saw the
[1:14:51] wall cities and they saw the obstacles
[1:14:54] and and because they saw that and become
[1:14:56] more of a reality than the promise then
[1:14:59] they couldn't see the Promise anymore
[1:15:01] amen and they explained every reason why
[1:15:04] they couldn't take that Promised Land
[1:15:07] amen see and and God was done with them
[1:15:10] God God was finished with them they they
[1:15:12] wouldn't believe a prophet They didn't
[1:15:14] accept the message amen and and so when
[1:15:17] the obstacles were standing there before
[1:15:19] them they didn't have the faith to say
[1:15:21] you know what that giant is is good as
[1:15:24] de
[1:15:25] amen because of the promise of God do
[1:15:28] you understand but there was a Caleb and
[1:15:30] Joshua that stood there and said we're
[1:15:33] more than able to take the land we're
[1:15:35] more than able they didn't look at the
[1:15:37] they didn't look at the the the
[1:15:39] obstacles they didn't look at all these
[1:15:40] things they kept their eyes upon the
[1:15:42] promise they believed they wouldn't let
[1:15:45] that negative report take away their
[1:15:48] faith ain't that right now the prophet
[1:15:52] said faith is not proved by science
[1:15:56] faith is is what science doesn't see
[1:15:59] Faith sees what science doesn't see so
[1:16:03] if you're trying to prove things by
[1:16:05] science you know and and and again this
[1:16:08] is where the doctors they rely upon
[1:16:11] their scientific discoveries and their
[1:16:14] machinery and all of these things and
[1:16:17] and and by science they're giving you a
[1:16:20] report and it may be true and you may
[1:16:23] even have the Sy that that verify that
[1:16:26] what he's saying is the truth but there
[1:16:29] is a faith in God's word that can change
[1:16:33] that
[1:16:35] situation in the days of Noah science
[1:16:38] couldn't see the rain that was coming
[1:16:41] amen but Noah by faith could see the
[1:16:44] rain before it ever got there you
[1:16:46] believe that science couldn't see a
[1:16:49] virgin girl bearing a child but by faith
[1:16:53] the prophet Isaiah saw it happening amen
[1:16:56] see by faith faith saw it different than
[1:16:59] what what science would would be able to
[1:17:02] say so brother Bram said if we ever lose
[1:17:05] this great faith then we are totally in
[1:17:08] darkness see if we ever lose Faith
[1:17:11] there's no hope for us so you must we
[1:17:14] are believers don't don't look don't
[1:17:16] look for other outside s resources look
[1:17:19] to Faith Can you say Amen keep faith
[1:17:22] faith is better than anything that you
[1:17:23] could ever have see if we ever lose this
[1:17:26] great faith then we are in total
[1:17:28] darkness because now you're totally
[1:17:31] helpless amen and what seems to be uh uh
[1:17:34] overwhelming will be overwhelming what
[1:17:37] seems to be there to overtake you will
[1:17:39] overtake you if you ain't got
[1:17:43] faith see he says see so if we ever lose
[1:17:46] this great faith and we are totally in
[1:17:48] darkness no matter how well we are
[1:17:52] educated and how we could explain the
[1:17:55] word of God to suit our own way of
[1:17:57] believing see you you you you got to
[1:18:00] have that Faith so living by faith has
[1:18:04] always made the believer uh an odd
[1:18:07] person to those that that are around him
[1:18:12] uh because he or she doesn't see what
[1:18:15] the others are
[1:18:17] seeing uh they their perception is
[1:18:20] totally different yeah the UN you know
[1:18:23] uh the carnal man just sees the mountain
[1:18:27] the believer doesn't see the mountain
[1:18:29] that's right the the the the carnal man
[1:18:33] sees the
[1:18:34] impossibilities the believer sees the
[1:18:38] possibilities uh uh their their Vision
[1:18:41] their view of things are are totally
[1:18:43] different and it's not mind over matter
[1:18:45] it's not positive thinking we're talking
[1:18:47] about faith can you say Amen now all the
[1:18:50] heroes in the Bible live by faith and
[1:18:54] and in other words they just simply
[1:18:56] believed uh whatever God said they just
[1:18:59] believed it and and they you know and so
[1:19:02] by faith they accomplish things and
[1:19:05] endure things that a normal man could
[1:19:08] not do they accomplish they they they
[1:19:12] done you know brother Bram said you know
[1:19:14] anything that Moses done was worth that
[1:19:17] was worth repeating was done by faith
[1:19:19] and not by sight amen think of that so
[1:19:23] if we lose faith then all of our hope is
[1:19:26] gone ain't that right brother brandham
[1:19:29] said if we lose Faith all our spiritual
[1:19:33] reality is gone now you know I I may be
[1:19:37] just just scattered a little bit but
[1:19:39] that's okay if we lose Faith all our
[1:19:43] spiritual reality is
[1:19:46] gone then then that means you cannot see
[1:19:49] something different you you'll not see
[1:19:52] Victory you'll see defeat that's right
[1:19:55] you you you'll not see yourself in in in
[1:19:59] in uh uh the promises of God you'll just
[1:20:03] see yourself in the present condition of
[1:20:05] what you are in you you you you'll not
[1:20:08] see it so if we lose Faith then all our
[1:20:12] spiritual reality is gone you you'll not
[1:20:14] see God you you you'll not see him as
[1:20:16] present you'll you you'll not see the
[1:20:19] promises as a reality because the
[1:20:21] spiritual reality uh uh is is gone
[1:20:25] you you'll lose that spiritual reality
[1:20:27] because faith is that super sense right
[1:20:31] amen see so you cannot have faith in
[1:20:33] things that you see the prophet says for
[1:20:36] the things that you see are all
[1:20:40] perishable so then by faith we look at
[1:20:43] things that cannot be seen by the
[1:20:46] natural
[1:20:48] eye ain't that right that's why yeah
[1:20:52] down Through the Ages they they the the
[1:20:54] Bible says by faith you know they they
[1:20:57] saw the promises of God were persuaded
[1:21:00] of them and embraced
[1:21:03] them why because they done it by faith
[1:21:06] they could see it before it ever
[1:21:09] happened see so so we look at things
[1:21:12] that we cannot see and we do not see
[1:21:15] them by our
[1:21:17] imagination it's not just something you
[1:21:19] know you're coming into the imagination
[1:21:21] station you know uh uh or whatever see
[1:21:25] but but we look at the word of God we
[1:21:29] look at the word of God and see what God
[1:21:32] is promised and by faith we believe it
[1:21:35] am we see it
[1:21:38] happening can you say Amen we see the
[1:21:41] word happening therefore no matter what
[1:21:44] situation you're in you're not in
[1:21:47] despair because you're seeing something
[1:21:49] that is different than what you feel
[1:21:52] you're seeing something different than
[1:21:55] what your symptoms are saying you're
[1:21:57] seeing something different than what the
[1:21:59] situation is around you you're looking
[1:22:02] at the
[1:22:03] Unseen Promises of
[1:22:07] God that's
[1:22:10] right the Bible the prophet said is
[1:22:13] God's word in seed
[1:22:15] form and then he says in another place
[1:22:18] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[1:22:20] do you believe it this this Bible is
[1:22:23] God's word in seed
[1:22:25] form amen and and every seed will bring
[1:22:28] forth of its of its kind so he says if
[1:22:31] you need salvation the seed's here if
[1:22:34] you need healing here's the seed in the
[1:22:36] word the word of God is a seed put it in
[1:22:39] your heart don't dig it up every morning
[1:22:41] to see if it's sprouted put it in there
[1:22:44] and leave it there can you say Amen it's
[1:22:48] God's business to bring forth the
[1:22:50] Harvest that's right you believe that
[1:22:53] can you say that with me it's God's
[1:22:55] business to bring forth the Harvest it's
[1:22:58] God's business to fulfill his word it's
[1:23:01] God's business to take care of
[1:23:04] you you believe it it's God's business
[1:23:07] to bring forth the Harvest you just
[1:23:09] leave it there now notice what he says
[1:23:11] water it by faith and
[1:23:13] praise every day thanking God for
[1:23:18] it so that's where our faith is faith
[1:23:21] without works is dead so our our works
[1:23:24] is is not trying to make it happen our
[1:23:27] works is praising God and thanking God
[1:23:31] Amen for the
[1:23:32] answer you're watering it with your
[1:23:38] praise ain't that right not falling in
[1:23:41] despair oh I've waited for so long I've
[1:23:43] waited for an hour and it ain't
[1:23:45] happening
[1:23:46] yet you water it with praise true well
[1:23:51] I've been believing for 10 years keep
[1:23:53] watering it with with
[1:23:55] praise faith never wavers that's right
[1:23:58] Noah 120 years and his faith never
[1:24:02] wavered Abraham waited 25 years and grew
[1:24:06] grew weaker in his body and more frail
[1:24:10] but the promise become more
[1:24:12] alive each day he grew stronger in faith
[1:24:17] see and so he never wavered in his faith
[1:24:22] see so now you know by faith we believe
[1:24:26] that some glorious
[1:24:29] day amen that God is going to call us
[1:24:32] from the earth though we be just a
[1:24:35] spoonful of
[1:24:38] dust
[1:24:39] right and and we don't fear the days
[1:24:43] because we know by
[1:24:45] faith that that that God is going to
[1:24:48] honor that
[1:24:49] word watch the believer when he goes
[1:24:52] down there there just something that you
[1:24:54] know on the deathbed or whatever there's
[1:24:57] just a peace in his heart you know uh
[1:25:01] been been around a few that that that
[1:25:03] have passed on just Christians and
[1:25:06] there's just a peace in their heart
[1:25:09] knowing that that that God is true that
[1:25:12] God is faithful what is it it's by faith
[1:25:17] see everything that we're doing is by
[1:25:19] faith can you say Amen now God doesn't
[1:25:23] ask us to prove prove his word he just
[1:25:27] ask us to believe it so it's not up to
[1:25:30] you to have the answers it's up to you
[1:25:33] just to believe it that's right you may
[1:25:35] not understand it may not know how you
[1:25:38] just believe it God is going to fulfill
[1:25:41] that word come on Amen can you say Amen
[1:25:46] see so now the critics want us to prove
[1:25:48] the Bible but we don't have to prove it
[1:25:52] we just believe it
[1:25:54] find out that uh uh critics even if you
[1:25:57] try to prove the Bible they ain't going
[1:25:59] to believe it anyways if it ain't in
[1:26:01] them to believe it just ain't in them to
[1:26:02] believe so we're not here spending our
[1:26:05] time trying to prove this Bible God's
[1:26:08] already proved it the message of the
[1:26:10] hour we're just simply believing we're
[1:26:14] simply
[1:26:16] resting can you say Amen now if if if
[1:26:20] we're not Believers then then what what
[1:26:22] is it the world's going to the spirit of
[1:26:24] the world is going to catch us and we're
[1:26:26] going to be negative we're going to be
[1:26:28] negative people talk negative think
[1:26:31] negative act negative everything is a
[1:26:33] negative
[1:26:35] atmosphere ain't that right amen where
[1:26:38] we just can't see our way out we can't
[1:26:40] see anything it's just when we're in
[1:26:43] Gloom we talk Gloom when we're you know
[1:26:45] we just become a roller coaster but
[1:26:47] there's got to be something that anchors
[1:26:50] and the only thing that can anchor is
[1:26:51] the word of God Amen and that's our
[1:26:54] faith ain't that right see and so we
[1:26:59] believe it and we believe because God's
[1:27:01] word is eternal and will never change we
[1:27:04] believe that he is the same yesterday
[1:27:06] today and forever so then whatever he
[1:27:09] done back in the day he can still do it
[1:27:12] today which makes our situation not an
[1:27:16] impossible situation it makes everything
[1:27:19] possible if we can just
[1:27:22] believe and we believe him because he's
[1:27:24] here to fulfill his word how many
[1:27:26] believes he's here to fulfill his word
[1:27:29] now what good is a historical God that's
[1:27:32] right of yesterday if he's not here
[1:27:35] today that's right brother brah said
[1:27:37] what good it does it do as to read what
[1:27:40] God did through Moses if he doesn't do
[1:27:42] that today what good does it do is to
[1:27:44] read how God delivered the children of
[1:27:47] uh the Hebrew children from the fire if
[1:27:49] he's not the same God today what good is
[1:27:52] a God that would judge between right and
[1:27:54] wrong in a day gone by and punish the
[1:27:56] wrong and bless the right if he isn't
[1:27:58] the same God today why do we come to
[1:28:01] church and abstain from the world if he
[1:28:03] isn't the same God of judgment today
[1:28:06] what good would it be to serve a God who
[1:28:09] could call his friend from the grave in
[1:28:11] a day gone by and yet he can't do it
[1:28:13] today you understand what I'm saying you
[1:28:15] see how ridiculous it would be for us to
[1:28:17] come to church and worship God and read
[1:28:21] from this Holy Bible and and then he not
[1:28:23] be the same
[1:28:27] God you with me if he's not the same God
[1:28:31] then our faith is in vain our rejoicing
[1:28:34] is in vain Our Testimony is in vain
[1:28:37] everything that we're doing is in
[1:28:43] vain but we believe that he is the
[1:28:47] same and it may be ridiculous to the
[1:28:50] world but it's not ridiculous to the
[1:28:53] believer
[1:28:54] amen so we do not question whether he is
[1:28:59] or not and we're not stepping out on a
[1:29:02] limb by Believing on him you are in the
[1:29:07] safest position when you are believing
[1:29:12] him can you say Amen so the believer is
[1:29:16] at rest and we are under full
[1:29:20] expectation for God to fulfill his word
[1:29:23] ain't that right now in the story of
[1:29:27] Moses we can see that a unbeliever can
[1:29:31] look at the same thing that a Believer
[1:29:33] does and get a totally different
[1:29:36] view of of than than what a Believer
[1:29:40] sees it's just like when the prophet
[1:29:43] talks about when Pharaoh looked at the
[1:29:44] children of Israel all he saw was mud
[1:29:47] dobers all he saw was slaves he just saw
[1:29:50] Misfits he saw worthless people that's
[1:29:54] what Pharaoh saw when he looked at
[1:29:56] Israel but when Moses saw the children
[1:29:59] of Israel he he didn't see any of that
[1:30:03] he saw a people of Promise he saw a
[1:30:06] people that had a bright future yet they
[1:30:09] were slaves yet they they were in
[1:30:11] bondage but he didn't see that he saw
[1:30:14] the the word he saw what God said about
[1:30:17] them he saw that they were a covenant
[1:30:21] people can you say Amen see so so then
[1:30:26] by faith he stood with them by faith and
[1:30:30] it brought them out of the condition by
[1:30:36] faith see so we find you know brother
[1:30:41] bradam said you know when Moses saw the
[1:30:44] great ditches in their face and the
[1:30:45] tears that run down their cheeks and
[1:30:47] their bent bodies he looked upon them as
[1:30:50] the people of God he didn't look at them
[1:30:52] upon them as slaves now I'm getting to a
[1:30:55] point here but he looked upon them as
[1:30:58] the chosen people of God that's how we
[1:31:02] want to look at one
[1:31:05] another is through
[1:31:08] faith we all have failur and we all deal
[1:31:11] with things in our life that seem to be
[1:31:14] impossible but when by faith we look at
[1:31:17] each other we see a
[1:31:20] promise right we want to see a promise
[1:31:24] and and and this is how we we want to
[1:31:26] look at our even at our
[1:31:28] children we we don't look at the
[1:31:31] situation they're in we look at the
[1:31:36] promise hello yes sir that's right see
[1:31:40] CU we're not a people that are to
[1:31:42] despair we are not a people that to fall
[1:31:45] apart situation going to come and go but
[1:31:48] the word
[1:31:49] remains and so when when the situations
[1:31:52] change and they go from the worst or
[1:31:54] whatever there must be something to
[1:31:56] Anchor our our faith in and that's the
[1:31:58] word of God so we're looking at a
[1:32:01] promise brother brand says I know we all
[1:32:03] you know think our you know uh we all
[1:32:05] want to think our children as Renegades
[1:32:08] and things like that but we must stop
[1:32:12] that can you say Amen we must stop that
[1:32:16] he said I believe that we must remember
[1:32:18] that these kids are the best kids in the
[1:32:22] world because there our children and we
[1:32:26] claim them for
[1:32:28] God how me claiming your children for
[1:32:31] God see see the the the it's by faith
[1:32:36] we're we're living by faith right so
[1:32:40] don't see them as
[1:32:44] lost don't see them as so far
[1:32:50] gone see them as saved
[1:32:54] hello
[1:32:56] amen you say can that be well yeah it
[1:32:59] can
[1:33:01] be let me ask you how do you see
[1:33:04] yourself come
[1:33:07] on right well I'm a
[1:33:09] Christian good well what what makes you
[1:33:12] say
[1:33:14] that and as a Christian how do you see
[1:33:17] yourself well I just don't know if I'm
[1:33:19] going to make it well then you ain't got
[1:33:20] the faith
[1:33:22] yet because by Faith you've got to see
[1:33:25] yourself as
[1:33:26] there you your your whole your whole
[1:33:29] your whole situation your whole
[1:33:31] Christianity is based upon faith not
[1:33:34] feelings but by faith by faith I'm going
[1:33:38] to make it then then what what do you
[1:33:40] base your worship on when we come to the
[1:33:42] church church and we're here in worship
[1:33:45] our is our worship just I shall not be I
[1:33:48] shall not be moved I shall not be I hope
[1:33:52] I'm not moved
[1:33:56] you know it it it's by faith so so
[1:34:00] you're not judging your worship and and
[1:34:03] and raing your worship based upon your
[1:34:06] feelings you're you're basing everything
[1:34:08] by faith you see yourself in the promise
[1:34:13] you see yourself the way God sees you
[1:34:16] remember this Bible is a
[1:34:19] mirror right it's what Paul says it's a
[1:34:22] mirror and were beholding his
[1:34:27] glory his glory well when you look in a
[1:34:30] mirror who are you looking at amen
[1:34:34] you're not looking at somebody else
[1:34:35] you're seeing
[1:34:37] you but when you're looking here you're
[1:34:40] seeing yourself the way the word sees
[1:34:42] you way God sees you as that's the only
[1:34:46] way Moses could look at the children of
[1:34:48] Israel differently than what Pharaoh
[1:34:50] Pharaoh didn't know the promise Moses
[1:34:53] knew knew the promise he was taught the
[1:34:56] Promise by his
[1:34:59] mother can you say Amen so he couldn't
[1:35:02] look at the children of Israel any other
[1:35:04] way than what God said they
[1:35:06] are that's right can you say amen that's
[1:35:09] right and so if if that faith if so by
[1:35:13] faith you live by faith not by the way
[1:35:15] you feel not by the way the doctor says
[1:35:17] you are not the B by the way anybody
[1:35:20] else said you live by faith the way God
[1:35:22] says you are
[1:35:24] well if you get you then you see
[1:35:26] yourself the way the word says you are
[1:35:28] quit looking at your failures quit
[1:35:29] looking at your inabilities quit looking
[1:35:32] at everything else and look at the word
[1:35:34] of God base your worship on the word of
[1:35:37] God base your experience on the word of
[1:35:40] God base your testimony on the word of
[1:35:42] God and you do it by faith whether you
[1:35:45] feel it or feel like it or whether you
[1:35:47] see it or you don't see it you already
[1:35:50] see it in God's promise
[1:35:55] well then that's the way you got to look
[1:35:57] at your
[1:35:58] children don't see them as lost see them
[1:36:01] as
[1:36:02] saved don't see them as being Beyond
[1:36:06] hope see them as delivered that's right
[1:36:09] see them as set
[1:36:13] free come on
[1:36:18] church I just asked you
[1:36:21] this if you don't have faith for your
[1:36:23] children children where does it leave
[1:36:28] them doctor says okay you're going to
[1:36:32] die okay if you don't have faith in
[1:36:35] God's word where does that leave
[1:36:41] you then you're in a you're just
[1:36:45] hopeless then the spiritual realities of
[1:36:47] God are gone yes sir there's nothing God
[1:36:50] can do to help you right if you don't
[1:36:53] have faith for your children then what
[1:36:55] does it leave
[1:36:59] them now the Bible says the children are
[1:37:02] inheritage of the Lord do you believe
[1:37:05] it in other words there are
[1:37:08] inheritance
[1:37:10] now if if we don't have faith then they
[1:37:14] have no
[1:37:16] future they have no
[1:37:19] hope hello
[1:37:23] so we see the power of darkness in what
[1:37:26] it
[1:37:28] does we know what it does we're looking
[1:37:30] at the world maybe some of you even have
[1:37:33] children that are just lost and and
[1:37:36] they're being affected by the powers of
[1:37:39] of of Satan to where it just
[1:37:41] looks you
[1:37:43] know just impossible Satan has a way to
[1:37:47] make even make our children look like
[1:37:49] freaks just make them look like they're
[1:37:52] just like
[1:37:54] what planet did you just fall off
[1:37:57] from and that's the power of darkness
[1:37:59] and we see that's right what Darkness
[1:38:03] does but we also see the power of faith
[1:38:08] and what faith
[1:38:09] does there is no situation I'm and I you
[1:38:13] know I may be rambling but that's okay
[1:38:16] there is no situation that's
[1:38:18] impossible when you got
[1:38:21] faith can you say Amen
[1:38:25] now we know that the power of faith is
[1:38:27] superior to the power of
[1:38:30] Darkness that's right look at the things
[1:38:33] that the Believers did by
[1:38:36] faith uh by faith uh Joshua called the
[1:38:40] sun to stand still by faith Moses spoke
[1:38:43] the creative word and brought things
[1:38:45] into
[1:38:46] existence by faith Noah preached and
[1:38:49] built an ark and floated above the
[1:38:50] Waters of
[1:38:52] Destruction by Faith Sarah re received
[1:38:56] strength to have a son by faith she and
[1:39:00] Abraham was turned back to their youth
[1:39:02] Again by faith it's all by faith right
[1:39:06] by faith David defeated Goliath and and
[1:39:10] and all of these things are totally
[1:39:12] impossible to be done just by carnal man
[1:39:16] his strength his knowledge you
[1:39:18] understand that but yet it happened by
[1:39:20] faith it happened through men to Men by
[1:39:24] faith right yes sir it did so if you're
[1:39:29] seeing things as hopeless then you're
[1:39:31] not living by
[1:39:33] faith God help us to live by
[1:39:37] faith not faith in our abilities that's
[1:39:40] not the right Faith you're not putting
[1:39:41] your faith in the right place Faith must
[1:39:43] be on the word the word of God sir ain't
[1:39:48] that right see so then faith is powerful
[1:39:52] it's the only only way that we can see
[1:39:54] the impossible become possible now I
[1:39:58] just notice the the the power that faith
[1:40:01] has and I'm not going to keep you much
[1:40:03] longer but you all remember the I think
[1:40:07] it's the Philippian Jailer Paul and
[1:40:10] Silas was thrown in prison for preaching
[1:40:12] the gospel and Paul had cast out a demon
[1:40:16] of a fortune telling Spirit out of a
[1:40:19] girl and uh the man who owned her was
[1:40:22] upset cuz she could know no longer uh
[1:40:24] tell people's fortunes and so they threw
[1:40:29] them in prison and brother brandham
[1:40:32] describes their situation pretty pretty
[1:40:35] bleak situation that Paul and them were
[1:40:37] in and they they didn't know you know as
[1:40:42] far as they knew they were going to be
[1:40:43] executed the next day and they were in
[1:40:46] stocks and brother Brown talks about you
[1:40:48] know how that their head was in you know
[1:40:50] you've seen it I'm sure their their head
[1:40:52] was in in in uh uh a block you know and
[1:40:56] their hands and their feet were were
[1:40:58] there and they can't move and their
[1:41:02] their backs are bloody and you know bugs
[1:41:05] probably crawling on them and mice and
[1:41:08] rats and all that so it was a a an
[1:41:11] impossible
[1:41:13] situation and yet they began to sing
[1:41:16] songs and they begin to testify of the
[1:41:19] Lord and they did this by faith and and
[1:41:23] as they began to testify and sing then
[1:41:27] then Earth God sent an earthquake y'all
[1:41:29] yall remember it and and and uh the
[1:41:32] chains were broken and things and
[1:41:35] brother BR said the Geller must have
[1:41:36] heard them singing and testifying and it
[1:41:39] struck a cord in his heart that these
[1:41:42] men are holy men they're right men
[1:41:44] they're they they're not talking of
[1:41:46] gloom and doom they they got a peace in
[1:41:48] the situation they there just something
[1:41:51] about them that they know that that that
[1:41:54] they're not falling apart and and so he
[1:41:57] was going to kill himself because he
[1:41:59] knew that he was going to get executed
[1:42:01] if any of the prisoners had had gotten
[1:42:03] free and Paul saw him and quickly said
[1:42:07] don't don't don't we're all here every
[1:42:09] everybody's accounted for and the man
[1:42:11] fell at his at their feet and said what
[1:42:14] must I do to be saved and Paul didn't
[1:42:18] give him a whole list of what not to
[1:42:21] do uh but gave him what he must do and
[1:42:26] the prophet said we spend too much time
[1:42:29] focus upon what people shouldn't do and
[1:42:32] not what they must do and Paul simply
[1:42:36] said believe everybody's
[1:42:39] believe believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:42:43] and notice and thee and thy house think
[1:42:47] of that by his faith thee and thy house
[1:42:50] shall be saved
[1:42:54] that's powerful
[1:42:58] right and so you
[1:43:00] know what an easy
[1:43:04] thing don't have to beg don't have to
[1:43:08] plead don't have to worry fret whatever
[1:43:11] just
[1:43:12] believe simply believe take God at his
[1:43:16] word ain't that right now brother bradam
[1:43:20] said see what we need today is not pray
[1:43:23] for more
[1:43:24] power now notice this you got enough
[1:43:28] power to make a new
[1:43:30] Earth think of this yes amen he's he's
[1:43:33] taken
[1:43:35] our negative thinking about ourselves
[1:43:39] away taking all that negative feelings
[1:43:42] and whatever that Satan puts upon us and
[1:43:46] he's telling us you've got within you
[1:43:48] power to make a new
[1:43:50] Earth what you need is Faith to use that
[1:43:53] power what you need is control that life
[1:43:57] and live such a Godly life that when you
[1:44:01] ask God anything you
[1:44:03] know right see th this is why it's so
[1:44:07] important that that we live right
[1:44:10] lives keep keep everything under the
[1:44:14] blood amen get get get you know keep sin
[1:44:20] out of our Lives because you're going to
[1:44:23] need that power with
[1:44:26] God Amen so he said you've got enough
[1:44:29] power to make a new Earth what you need
[1:44:31] is Faith to use that power what you need
[1:44:34] is control that life and live such a
[1:44:37] Godly life that when you ask God
[1:44:39] anything you know we have confidence in
[1:44:42] God of that see we know if we keep his
[1:44:45] Commandments he'll hold withhold no good
[1:44:47] thing from us if we walk with him and
[1:44:49] God walking with us can you say Amen so
[1:44:53] in another place brother Brown said did
[1:44:55] you know that that that the power of
[1:44:57] Resurrection your the power for your own
[1:45:01] Resurrection is inside of you think of
[1:45:04] that you have your own Resurrection
[1:45:06] inside of you see if a person if a
[1:45:10] person is
[1:45:12] predestinated then then that that
[1:45:15] individual already has what he
[1:45:18] needs just trying to get it to you you
[1:45:22] already have inside of you what what you
[1:45:26] have need of it's already within you
[1:45:29] just like Jesus was a predestinated seat
[1:45:32] of God you believe that his whole life
[1:45:34] was predestinated he was predestinated
[1:45:37] to rise from the grave do you believe
[1:45:39] that he said that he had the power he
[1:45:43] wasn't waiting for power he had the
[1:45:46] power to lay down his life and to pick
[1:45:49] it up again so the power of Resurrection
[1:45:52] was already in him he wasn't just
[1:45:56] predestinated to go down in the grave he
[1:45:58] was predestinated to rise again and you
[1:46:02] are predestinated to rise again see God
[1:46:05] ain't going to finish you halfway
[1:46:07] through the
[1:46:09] story and he ain't going to allow the
[1:46:11] devil Amen to take you out halfway if
[1:46:14] you're predestinated you're going to go
[1:46:16] all the way if he's Justified you that's
[1:46:19] great but look at the other part he's
[1:46:22] already glorified ified you he called
[1:46:24] you predestinated for ordained you and
[1:46:27] now he's already glorified you how can
[1:46:30] he stop you how can Satan stop you it's
[1:46:33] already done and the power is within
[1:46:39] you Hallelujah can you say Amen so now
[1:46:43] notice he had the power to lay down his
[1:46:45] life and power to take it up again it
[1:46:47] was already in him and brother Brown
[1:46:49] said each one of you have the power the
[1:46:51] same way
[1:46:53] because you are Sons and Daughters of
[1:46:55] God and the Very Spirit that's in you
[1:46:58] this morning the Holy Spirit that's in
[1:47:00] you this morning that same holy spirit
[1:47:02] will raise you up so you have the power
[1:47:04] to raise yourself back up hello so
[1:47:08] what's operating that power faith faith
[1:47:10] in God's
[1:47:12] wordl ain't that right see he says you
[1:47:16] have the power in you in you now to do
[1:47:19] that but that power that you have in you
[1:47:21] now could make a new world see God
[1:47:24] doesn't have little weak spots and big
[1:47:26] heavy spots that's powerful the least
[1:47:29] little touch of God is omnipotent the
[1:47:32] least little touch of God can you say
[1:47:34] Amen so so now if you look at it for a
[1:47:38] moment look what faith has already done
[1:47:40] for
[1:47:41] you how many believes you've changed
[1:47:44] since you given your heart to the Lord
[1:47:47] you change you're not the same person
[1:47:49] how did that
[1:47:51] happen now just just go figure how did
[1:47:54] that happen when your friends are still
[1:47:57] out in the world or you know whatever I
[1:48:00] I know of people that have tried and
[1:48:02] tried to quit drinking tried and tried
[1:48:04] to quit smoking they tried to quit
[1:48:07] different things of the world habits and
[1:48:10] yet here we are we were in all of that
[1:48:15] and and in some way or form or fashion
[1:48:18] maybe it just religion or whatever but
[1:48:20] we've risen but how did we do that by
[1:48:23] faith it it wasn't something there but
[1:48:26] but something special out out whatever
[1:48:30] but you were a predestinated seed and it
[1:48:32] was already in you amen for these things
[1:48:35] to happen see and and so brother Brown
[1:48:38] said you used to live in the muck of sin
[1:48:40] and drinking gambling all things of the
[1:48:42] world but as soon as you believe that
[1:48:44] Christ forgave you of your sins you Rose
[1:48:46] above those things now you're now riding
[1:48:49] above it ain't that right well how how
[1:48:51] can you do that can you rise above it
[1:48:54] you know why cuz you believe you're a
[1:48:55] Christian how many believes you're a
[1:48:57] Christian now the moment you stop
[1:48:59] believing that you're a Christian is the
[1:49:00] moment you're not a Christian the moment
[1:49:03] brother Brown said the moment you you
[1:49:04] say you're not saved is the moment
[1:49:06] you're not saved so everything is by
[1:49:09] Believing by Believing by Believing by
[1:49:11] believing you're possessing Heaven by
[1:49:14] believing you're possessing the Rapture
[1:49:16] by believing everything is by
[1:49:20] believing you believe that
[1:49:23] and see this is what's uh magnificent I
[1:49:26] think about the message it's bringing us
[1:49:28] under the headship of the word to where
[1:49:30] we're not confused and we're not
[1:49:32] listening to this one and we're not
[1:49:33] listening to this voice we're under one
[1:49:35] headship and that's the word of God and
[1:49:38] whatever he says I believe it I live by
[1:49:41] it I confess
[1:49:43] it yes sir brother Braham said when you
[1:49:47] accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit came
[1:49:48] to you then you have faith in the Holy
[1:49:51] Spirit to give you power to ride above
[1:49:55] that kind of life of sin see so then God
[1:49:59] wouldn't have placed a a predestinated
[1:50:02] seed in you and then not give you Faith
[1:50:05] to access every promise of God right why
[1:50:09] why would God give you that Faith why or
[1:50:11] why would God give you predestinate you
[1:50:13] to the promises of God and you can't
[1:50:14] live it you can't obtain to it and we
[1:50:17] just sitting here just so weak and
[1:50:19] beggarly and just wishing and just and
[1:50:22] it's just like God waving the promises
[1:50:23] like the carrot before the you know
[1:50:26] before the donkey and just
[1:50:28] like well that's not the point you you
[1:50:31] we're missing
[1:50:32] Christianity see every promise is to be
[1:50:35] had and is accessible by faith can you
[1:50:39] say Amen so every promise that God made
[1:50:42] is in you already to possess brother
[1:50:45] Braham says in the Church of the Living
[1:50:46] God this morning lays the power to heal
[1:50:48] all sickness in the Church of the Living
[1:50:50] God lays power to overcome all
[1:50:52] Temptation in the possession of the
[1:50:54] Church of the Living God this morning
[1:50:56] lays the power to change sin and throw
[1:50:58] it away and receive the baptism of the
[1:51:00] Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:51:02] whatsoever you desire everybody say
[1:51:05] whatsoever I desire see whatsoever you
[1:51:08] desire ask in my name and it shall be
[1:51:10] given to you a little while in the world
[1:51:13] see see not the seed but the
[1:51:15] unregenerated seed that world will not
[1:51:18] will see me no more yet you'll see me
[1:51:21] for I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:51:24] end of the world what the Royal seed and
[1:51:27] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:51:28] I'll verify myself that I'm with you for
[1:51:31] these signs shall follow them that
[1:51:33] believe he shall possess the seat of his
[1:51:35] enemy he shall possess the Gate of his
[1:51:38] Enemy No matter what the gate is if it's
[1:51:40] sickness Temptation sin whatever gate it
[1:51:42] is it's
[1:51:44] conquered do you believe it another
[1:51:47] place everything that you have need of
[1:51:49] in this journey is in you right now yes
[1:51:52] sir the only thing you have to do is
[1:51:54] have faith in God that pushes that good
[1:51:56] things out of you which is in You by the
[1:51:59] Holy Spirit see so if you want to write
[1:52:02] higher into healing just have more faith
[1:52:07] right brother brah said just keep
[1:52:09] pushing it out and there you are see now
[1:52:12] he says if a person is not sick or is
[1:52:15] not a Christian and he's sick then he
[1:52:16] needs to become a Christian right now so
[1:52:19] that healing power will come into you by
[1:52:21] becoming a Christian and and that will
[1:52:22] give you Faith to right above sin it'll
[1:52:25] give you the faith can you say Amen so
[1:52:28] if you
[1:52:29] notice amen Paul would tell this Roman
[1:52:32] Centurion have faith just believe and
[1:52:36] it'll not only affect you but it'll
[1:52:38] affect your children as well so that
[1:52:41] that tells us that Faith your unsaved
[1:52:44] child can be saved by your
[1:52:48] faith I hope that helps you today
[1:52:53] and you say Amen see when they can't
[1:52:56] believe for
[1:52:59] themselves God has given you that
[1:53:02] privilege to stand there with
[1:53:06] faith claiming
[1:53:09] them a child or a father had brought his
[1:53:12] child
[1:53:15] for pretty bad it was sick pretty bad
[1:53:19] and he had brought it the child to
[1:53:21] Jeffersonville for prayer and Billy Paul
[1:53:23] had told brother brandham says the the
[1:53:25] child needs so brother brandham didn't
[1:53:27] get to see the the child before service
[1:53:30] but as he's
[1:53:32] preaching he tells the father he said
[1:53:36] now your faith will have to go for that
[1:53:37] child if it's a little infant
[1:53:40] child say if they can't believe for
[1:53:42] themselves then you've got to have that
[1:53:44] faith for that child right and your
[1:53:47] faith will affect that child your faith
[1:53:50] will will will cause healing to come to
[1:53:53] that child and you sayen so this is the
[1:53:56] same thing that Paul was saying to that
[1:53:58] Phil Philippian Jailer have faith
[1:54:00] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:54:04] thee and thy house shall be saved now
[1:54:08] Paul wasn't saying that the man's
[1:54:09] salvation would save his his household
[1:54:13] but brother Bram says but if he's got
[1:54:15] enough faith in God for his own
[1:54:17] salvation then he can have the same
[1:54:19] faith for his house and his house have
[1:54:22] to come in it's the same
[1:54:25] thing hello amen see so you're not
[1:54:29] believing a myth you're believing a
[1:54:33] promise can you say
[1:54:36] Amen you're believing that the blood of
[1:54:39] Jesus Christ is not only for you but
[1:54:41] it's also for your
[1:54:44] household and this is exactly what job
[1:54:47] did remember per Adventure he had he
[1:54:51] didn't know if his children had sinned
[1:54:53] or not but per Adventure they had
[1:54:56] sinned he offered a burnt offering on
[1:55:00] their behalf and he began to pray for
[1:55:02] his children brother Brown said he did
[1:55:05] it just in the right time just Before
[1:55:08] Destruction came and you all know what
[1:55:11] happened he lost everything and he lost
[1:55:14] all of his seven
[1:55:15] children and and and they were you know
[1:55:18] his critics were saying job you're a
[1:55:19] secret sinner or this stuff would have
[1:55:21] happened and and the job would would
[1:55:24] tell them though but I'm not a sinner
[1:55:27] I've answered God's requirement I'm
[1:55:29] standing as a righteous man because of
[1:55:32] the
[1:55:34] sacrifice can you say
[1:55:36] amen amen and when it was all said and
[1:55:39] done God restored everything back to him
[1:55:43] double
[1:55:44] fold and God gave him his family his
[1:55:48] children brother brand said he didn't
[1:55:50] get him back in the in natural life life
[1:55:53] but he got him in
[1:55:54] heaven he said they were there waiting
[1:55:56] on their
[1:55:57] daddy because he had offered a
[1:56:01] sacrifice in faith for them can you say
[1:56:05] Amen you see that's what that's that's
[1:56:08] what it means for
[1:56:10] us Amen to be saved and to have faith
[1:56:14] brother Braham talks about his own
[1:56:16] children he said' I've got my children
[1:56:18] there's my little son Joseph and Billy
[1:56:20] and Sarah and Rebecca
[1:56:22] well now I want to see each one of them
[1:56:24] a worker in the gospel doing something I
[1:56:26] want to see them saved and filled with
[1:56:28] the Holy Ghost now I've committed them
[1:56:30] to God and say God I'm holding on to God
[1:56:33] for them how is holding on to God and I
[1:56:36] believe they're going to be saved every
[1:56:38] one of them I believe they're going to
[1:56:40] be saved and I'll have them on the other
[1:56:42] side I don't believe my salvation will
[1:56:44] save them no but my faith in God will do
[1:56:47] it you see my faith believing God will
[1:56:49] do it and will cause them to come to
[1:56:52] Christ can you say Amen now you know
[1:56:55] here we look and and I don't know you
[1:56:58] know the everything about the the
[1:57:00] children his children and all that but I
[1:57:03] know they've gone through a lot of
[1:57:04] things but I just believe that they'll
[1:57:06] be there because the prophet of God was
[1:57:09] showing and demonstrating a faith that
[1:57:12] we all as parents must have can you
[1:57:16] sayen that's right and he says if I'm
[1:57:18] believing for my house and you're
[1:57:20] believing for your house by beleving
[1:57:23] that that we trust God God imputes our
[1:57:25] own faith like he did Abraham or job or
[1:57:28] any of them for righteousness so it's
[1:57:31] allotted to us for righteousness and
[1:57:33] that's how that thou and thy household
[1:57:35] shall be saved can you say Amen oh I
[1:57:40] think it's a wonderful thing so then not
[1:57:42] only that but I'm holding for every
[1:57:43] brother now notice how he's even
[1:57:45] applying faith for for the the church
[1:57:49] I'm and all my brothers my sisters see
[1:57:51] I'm not only holding faith for that but
[1:57:54] I'm holding for every person that's in
[1:57:56] my church I'm holding for you all I want
[1:57:59] you to hold for me because of the
[1:58:01] righteousness of faith we don't have to
[1:58:03] make a burnt offering Christ is our
[1:58:06] offering but we have to have faith in
[1:58:09] that offering that Christ made that that
[1:58:12] he made us this kind of a promise that
[1:58:15] whatsoever you ask the father in my name
[1:58:17] that I'll do and when thou prayest
[1:58:20] believe that you receive what you've
[1:58:21] asked for and you shall have it can you
[1:58:26] say Amen do you love him amen he says in
[1:58:29] another place if I'm praying that God
[1:58:31] will save these teenage
[1:58:35] children and I believe that with all my
[1:58:37] heart he will do it that's the same way
[1:58:40] job stood say oh look at this kid and
[1:58:44] how he's doing I don't care what he's
[1:58:46] doing or what she's doing I still have
[1:58:48] put that child in the hand of almighty
[1:58:51] God me and my house shall be saved even
[1:58:55] though I may pass on before they do but
[1:58:57] somehow before they leave here God will
[1:59:00] twist them right down the on the trail I
[1:59:03] believe that somehow or another he will
[1:59:05] make it so miserable for them till
[1:59:07] they'll have to do it see that's the way
[1:59:09] I believe it it's thou and thy house
[1:59:13] shall be saved can you say man you love
[1:59:17] him if the musicians will come
[1:59:22] bless the name of the
[1:59:26] Lord I Hope somehow it's helped you
[1:59:28] today encouraged your
[1:59:32] faith Amen brother brandom he said here
[1:59:35] he says I I guess you've wondered you've
[1:59:38] often wondered how I see those visions
[1:59:40] and things and what makes it it's
[1:59:43] because when he met me that night and
[1:59:45] told me that that this would happen I
[1:59:48] believe it I solemnly believe it and I
[1:59:51] go into to pray for the sick if I can
[1:59:53] ever get a feeling that something's
[1:59:55] fixing to happen they're fixing to get
[1:59:57] well see so always it's about right and
[2:00:01] that's the way we must do with our
[2:00:03] family and anything we ask for is we
[2:00:05] must pray and God respects Faith to
[2:00:08] believe it you we must believe that it
[2:00:10] is right now with that little bit of God
[2:00:14] when you said yes Lord Jesus I'm a
[2:00:16] sinner I'm not worthy of your love but
[2:00:19] you did love me so I accept you as as my
[2:00:22] savior immediately you walk right out of
[2:00:25] there and what is it you stop your lying
[2:00:28] you stop your cheating you stop stealing
[2:00:30] you stop doing the things that you ought
[2:00:32] and do why because you believe that
[2:00:34] you're a Christian and because you
[2:00:36] believe that you're a Christian you rise
[2:00:38] up from that and you're to another level
[2:00:40] now if you're sick here's healing you
[2:00:42] just believe it now you can't make
[2:00:44] yourself believe it it's got to to be
[2:00:46] something happened to you just like your
[2:00:48] conversion it's got to happen can you
[2:00:50] say Amen well that's the same way with
[2:00:52] everything we just got to believe it we
[2:00:55] got to accept it amen not question it
[2:00:58] don't let Satan cause you to reason well
