and um uh the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of Luke the U fifth chapter praise the Lord amen amen we uh and always enjoyed U uh velle and and Go's uh friendship uh Fellowship when they were here and and uh they always just treated us very nice we'd go there and visit them and uh I think one time we uh Heather and I went and visit him while they were in the middle of fixing supper or they were getting ready to eat and um we just popped in and they would not eat until we ate and the word of the Lord he stood by the lake of uh guinet I believe that's how you'd say that and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we have told all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break amen we uh if you would like to turn to the Book of John St John the 11th chapter praise the Lord St John chap 11 and read a few verses here now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with wantman and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus then we go uh let's see we're go on down further when he had heard therefore that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after that he saith uh saith to his disciples let us go into Judea again his disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee and goest thou thither again and Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleep he doeth he shall do well how be it Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of uh taking of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent you may believe nevertheless let us go unto him then said Thomas which is called dimus unto his fellow disciples let us go also that we may die with him then when Jesus came he found that he had laying in the grave 4 days already now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning the brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou has us been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will giveth thee amen then if you'd like to go down to the 38th verse they're standing here at the grave and we find it says Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jesus said take ye away the stone and Martha the sister of him that was dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he ha been dead four days Jesus saith unto her said not I unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which I which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus sath unto them loose him and let him go amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father we're so thankful that we can trust you and depend upon you Lord in which we are doing that tonight we're asking Lord that you would just come in your Mighty presence in a supernatural way and that you would Minister to your people for you alone know the needs and you alone know how to meet them now father may your word go forth I pray that you'd help me to get myself out of the way and Lord just help us all father just to get ourselves out of the way any spirit that would try to hinder the service tonight I pray that you would just rebuke it and drive it away from us we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen you can have your seats this evening and not to take long I I was going to speak on a different subject but just couldn't get the Liberty to do so and so we're just kind of depending on God uh this evening to help us but you know we are all familiar in one way or another with the the two stories that we had read um you may have not experienced the death in the family and you may have not experienced fishing all night not catching nothing uh but josi raises his hand uh but uh we're familiar with this uh stories because we have all faced uh situations uh that would seem possible uh I think we've all if you've lived long enough you've you've you had things that were just beyond your control and you wondered how it was going to happen how it was going to be resolved how you know all all these things but you know I I do declare and I I think uh any True Believer as as we grow in God we we find that God likes to put us in situations such as that he likes to put us in situations to where our back is against the wall we don't know what we're going to do how are we going to handle it what's going to take place it seems like it the ship is going to go under so to speak it just looks like you know we ain't going to make it it ain't going to come through and and uh it seems like you know that that the enemy uh the devil is going to just have the final word over our lives over the situation and and things like that but but God likes it that way to be honest and and it's it's because he likes to show his power to us he likes to manifest himself we we talk about it if there was no if we had no sickness we'd never know God as a Healer if we had no uh trouble we'd never know God as a way maker if if if if we didn't need salvation we'd never know God as a savior but uh God loves the contrast and and we we know that God is all powerful God is all knowing he's he's he's all Mighty ain't that right and so uh uh he is the god of Miracles if if if we're ever going to walk with God we've got to know that that God is a god of Miracles we we don't walk with the god of science because he's he's greater than science he we we don't walk with a God that that just is on our our level amen but we're walking with someone we're having a relationship an experience with with a god that is greater than than all things and so if if and and God wants us to experience him not not by just coming to church and learning about him and even reading the Bible that's wonderful to read the Bible and to know what he's promised in these things but but but that's not what God wants us to know him by go wants us to know him by experience to where that we will know that that we don't have to just read about him rolling back the Red Sea but we' know that he was the god that done that for us it may have not been a literal Red Sea but it's a God that the same God that done that is the same God that worked the miracle for us so so we must we must believe in miracles if we're going to walk with God and if we're going to trust in God and and if we're going to have faith in God we must believe in miracles can you say Amen you you can't walk with God and not believe in miracles you you can't you you you can't even you can't even be a Christian without believing in Miracles amen because that is the god of Miracles and and and and to say well that God you know I I I serve God I trust in God but I don't believe in miracles well then what God are you serving you're you're you're trying to change the way he is uh you're trying to change who he is and what he is and and and and you you can't do that because God don't change it it doesn't matter what the world thinks of God God is still Almighty it it doesn't matter what I say of God God is still God ain't that right and and so the only way that God can change would be in your mind of how you perceive of him but that still doesn't mean that you've changed God you've just only change your perception of God and and when you change God and make him a weak God then you can't believe in God you you can't believe in the impossibilities when you're when you want to change God and and and we'll we'll put it this way is a lot of folks even want to make God their errand boy amen that God God you got to do this you got to do this you got to do that and and we we want that because we want a happy life everybody wants a happy life today amen everybody wants things so easy for them to where they have no trials they have no they they they have no uh challenges they you know well that's not trusting God Amen if you got money in the bank you don't have to trust God a as you would if you had no money in the bank if if you had health all the time you wouldn't have to trust God to to heal your body amen oh that would be easy to say oh I trust God Amen and yet you have no sickness so oh whoop pee you know but when when it comes to when you're facing challenges and you need a Healer you need a deliverer you need a savior you need a redeemer you need somebody Amen to get you out of the situation you're in that's really when you've got to trust God can you say amen and so we we start out as Christians you know well we we then we we understand and and you know don't don't change God by the way you want him to be just let God be God and let him do what he wants to do ain't that right and we know that all things work together for the good of them that love God and are called to his purpose according to his purpose ain't that right so we must believe in miracles because God is a god of Miracles that's right and the way we believe in miracles is the god of Miracles has has done a miracle upon us and changed us and from a sinner to a saint from from h Bound To Heaven bound and and and it's a literal miracle that we're here tonight on our way to heaven ain't that right amen but and because he has done that in a personal way then we can believe in miracles of other things if God can save my soul he can heal my body if God can heal my body then he can make a way where there is no way amen if God can answer one prayer he can answer this prayer and and if he can answer this prayer he can answer the other prayers God is God ain't that right so so Believers got to take aen the limits off of God and just let him be God he's the one that said you're in the palm of his hand I've got you in the palm of my hand and no man can pluck you out amen he's the one that said we're the apple of his eye he's the one that has made these promises to let us know just how we are with him and what he thinks of us he didn't save you just to leave you he didn't give you all these promises and then not manifest himself and fulfill them promises if he said he's a Healer he will heal you if he said he's a deliverer he will deliver you if he said he'll provide he will provide it's just the way God does these things can you say Amen so then as Believers we believe him because we understand his ways amen there no no s no situation should catch us off guard Amen to where all of a sudden we demote him amen one moment we're praising him for being on the throne and all of a sudden the Trials come and we don't know what's happening and and and we're just and so finally we just emote him and put him on our level H what a shame amen we may be crying but God ain't crying amen our heart may be broken over things but God's heart ain't broken over things because he already knows he's going to take care of us can you say Amen so we we find uh that that the word of God brings miracles I I don't believe in magician tricks I I don't believe that any man can perform a miracle a man uh a man may be able to do a lot of things and and a lot of uh uh profound things but man cannot work miracles it's it it's and and and and and this is why we don't trust in politics and this is why we don't trust in scientific things and this is why we don't trust in man's inventions as as good as they are amen man's inventions are limited and and politicians are limited and religion is limited ain't that right amen but see God is God Amen that's right see so Christians we're we're not religious people amen we're actually Christians that are called to walk with God and to trust God and to experience God and to know God Amen I'd rather know God than I would president Trump I would rather know God than any great man on the face of this Earth I would rather know him because when I'm down God can pick me up amen when I'm in the in the worst storm of my life God Amen can Raise Me Up amen and it's already promise that if you go down in the grave amen there's a God that's going to raise you back up amen because that's the god that we serve can you amen see so so the word of God brings Miracles and it's the only thing that can amen see and so a God is the only one that is greater than all things now the stories that we read in the Bible here in our opening scripture they're different from one another uh one has been fishing all night and and and cut nothing the other one's at the gravite of her brother amen and and is is mourning his loss and and or her loss and and things but yet there is a few similarities in in the scriptures and I'm just simple tonight but but but hopefully it'll it'll be something to help you but there's similarities between them and that is both had a need and it didn't matter the need they just had a need one needed fish and the other one needed a resurrection amen but there were needs regardless amen and and so that was the similarity another similarity in between them amen is that Jesus came their way amen Jesus come Peter's way and Jesus come Mara his way amen and and and another similarity is they both stopped looking at the situation they stopped looking at the difficult they stopped they stopped uh looking at the problem amen because they recognize that Jesus was standing before them can you say amen and and and they didn't put him as as a king a man like Herod or Pilot or or a governor or or or something like that they didn't put him on the level as some bishop or a priest or or or something like that they recognized that the god of heaven was living in that body amen and there he was standing in their presence and he could speak yeah one word just one word from him would change the whole situation can you say amen amen see so they had recognized you see wherever God is the prophet said the supernatural takes place because he is Supernatural he get your off the natural amen and let God work the supernatural can you say amen that's why you must never serve God by what you see by what you feel amen you must serve God by faith amen by faith ain't that right because no matter if the doctor says he's going to die God steps in at one time and if he could speak his word that man will raise from the dead amen seen it you know and we've seen the blind open eyes open I've seen crippled walk amen we've seen Miracle after Miracle amen what looked to be an impossible situation when God steps in he changes the situation around God changes the situ how many's ever experienced God to change the situation God has changed the situation me and brother Shi was just talking about it you know downstairs of what God has done for them 20 years of praying 20 years of waiting 20 years they wanting a baby and and and it looked like it was impossible and Satan was telling them that God had had the word that God had failed upon his promisees amen and Satan was trying to get her to believe that amen but God come up on the scene and and they're expecting a child can you amen amen what is it that ought to give us faith that if God can do it for them God can do it for me this church ought to be excited about what God is doing amen don't be looking for miracles God is working miracles right before our eyes amen see amen but you know so wherever God is wherever God is the supernatural takes place because he is Supernatural brother brandom said if if people can recognize his presence then they are healed by faith believing believing it ain't that right amen see we have uh we've seen too much personality of man we're in the age of achievement of men men has achieved great things got us up in beyond space into the moon and and we we've seen you know uh uh just so many achievements a man getting right up at at the edge of space you know and then just falling off you know just just just falling and and and and he lives to tell this and lands on Earth and going I don't know how many miles an hour amen and and great achievements of man we been able to fly able to do all kinds of things and you know we now we got the internet and able to talk to each other around the world and and and and all of these things see but but what what's making it I I'll be honest it's in this age though through all of this it's making people's Faith slow I thank God for technology it's definitely made our life easier but is there's a danger with that it makes our faith slow and and the Bible speaks of that that there would be dangerous times and the prophet says it's when the people's Faith would become slow to where they can't take God at his word anymore can you say Amen they're they're they're relyant upon what man can do and if man says it can't happen then all of a sudden we just feel like it cannot happen amen if we think that there's no way out of it if we cannot see ourselves through it then we just automatically give up and we Despair and we all these things but I'm here to tell you that God don't need man's achievements amen God is greater than anything that could ever be can you say Amen we depended upon the personality of a man we depended upon education and theology we depended upon too many things that were not of God Amen see we've seen too many fleshly manifestations and have been disappointed in all of it amen in in one way or another but Jesus now so so when he come Peter recognized the the presence of Jesus Christ right there before him amen Martha recognized the presence of Jesus Christ amen there was something about him she says oh yes uh if you had been here amen days earlier my my uh brother would have not have died see but if nevertheless whatever you say God will hear your prayer can you say amen amen she still had a faith she still had a respect to the things of God Amen you know brother brandham uh uh has come and came in this age to declare the presence of God amen he did not come to to to to show off his personality he did not come to show off his strength and his talent he said I have no personality I have nothing that the people Amen to draw the people with except there is a God Amen there is a a a living reality to the presence of God and he come to declare the presence of God to us can you say Amen now amen this what makes his ministry so different it's a supernatural Ministry to get our faith off of man and and and and talents of man and ability of man to get our faith back in the in the faith of Jesus Christ and the ability of Jesus Christ and the supernatural power of Jesus Christ we can truly say with all of our heart that the son of man is now revealed to us can you say Amen therefore if there's anybody that should be able to recognize the presence of Jesus Christ it is us the bride of Christ it is the people Amen in the message ain't that right yes sir we should not we should not amen be looking at other things and other other other deals and and other things and then when them things don't uh you know don't don't come about and and all these things and we just we just fall in despair like like amen that that we you know when you do that that's an insult to God Amen because you you're you're not treating him fairly true amen we we listen now if we're depending our whole Eternal salvation upon Him amen then can we not trust him for everything else if we're saying amen that we're going in a Rapture because he saved our soul how can you trust in his salvation if you can't trust him in other things can you say amen amen see his word that speaks of Salvation is the same word that speaks of healing of the body it's the same it's the same word that speaks of of provision Vision Amen in every need that we have see and so now we recognize we're able to recognize I'm I'm so glad for that that we don't have to look at this Bible and read about a god of 2,000 years ago of what he done for Peter and what he done for Martha raising the dead Lazarus from the dead amen but we can recognize that his presence is here now with us yes sir he's here amen how do you know because he's in us how many believes he's in you amen Jesus Christ he's not a he's not a million miles off somewhere in the wild blue yonder he is present tense now here with us in us that that's exactly right and and so we should be aware that he is in US amen don't you let the devil blind you from that he is in you if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is in you amen and if you're resting your Eternal uh destination in him he must be in you for that is the token it's the life that is living within us it's Jesus Christ in you the hope everybody say the hope of glory can you say Amen well when he comes in us he doesn't change he doesn't change his personality he doesn't change who he is he doesn't change his nature what he does he changes us he changes our nature he changes our personality changes our spirit amen to where we can believe for all things a all things can you say Amen so God ain't keeping us from trouble but he'll bring us through that trouble he didn't keep the Hebrew boys out of the fire but he was there with them in that fire amen he didn't keep Daniel from the liones den but he was there amen with Daniel Amen and he may not keep you from the trials he may not keep you from the the the testing but he's right there with you amen yes sir that's true now brother Brown said the holy spirit is in his church to fulfill what the New Testament said that would come to pass in these last days do you believe that amen now there's no place in the Bible we've said it before but there's no place in the Bible that that speaks of a defeated church amen there's no place in the Bible where where Jesus said Devils will run all over you amen there's no place in the Bible where where that Jesus talked about a church his New Testament Church being totally uh uh defeated don't know what to do just just victims of the devil and victims of of of situations and and the world's got more power over the church and all that you'll never find that in in the Bible you you might find it in some other book but you'll never find it in this word of God Amen but what we find is that God promised that he would build a church amen upon the re of who Jesus Christ is amen and the gates of hell would never Prevail against it now now it that means it would tell us that the gates of hell would try to Prevail amen it would war against that church it would try to shake the church to its foundation it would try to take the faith away from the church The Joy away from the church but it would not Prevail amen for God had already promised it wouldn't Prevail amen see amen he says in my name you'll cast out Devils you'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you could drink any deadly thing and it would not hurt you and and on and on are the promises amen see amen even even he said uh uh whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven it's all at your word for it's Christ in you the word is now in you can you say amen and now you have that Authority so the holy spirit is in his church to fulfill what the New Testament said that would come to pass in the last days he didn't promise to give you feelings amen your feelings will come and go you'll feel saved one day feels lost the next amen you ain't always going to be it you ain't always going to your your flesh is up and down your your emotions are up and down can you say Amen you're going to have good days you're going to have bad days that's a GI fight amen if you're a human being you're going to have good days you're going to have bad days amen you're going to have trials you're going to have testing you're going to have a disappointment you're going to smile you're going to cry you're going to whatever that's all that's all there but inside of there is a Christ amen Christ in you the hope of glory that is all powerful that's greater it's God that condensated from Heaven amen come in the body of Jesus Christ to redeem us back to him and now now he's ascended to heaven and come back Amen to dwell in a people and he's showing himself alive today can you say amen amen so we have seen the sign of his resurrection in this day that Jesus had promised to let us know not to dwell upon a man amen but to to to know that he's here do you believe it amen to know that he's here amen see so now these people understood that we read in our opening scripture they understood that that uh uh Jesus had the ability to speak the word and whatever he said it would happen can you say Amen they understood the power that was in his voice amen yes sir you know man may have not been there in the beginning when God said let there be light and then watch that light appear you may have not been there to see the trees and the flowers amen spring forth after God said let there be trees and let there be this and let there be that he may have not been there in all these things but they were there amen them them people were there when he looked at that Centurion amen you you know the story of the Centurion but he looked at that Centurion and said go thy way and as thou Hast believed amen so be it done unto thee amen and what he said happened ain't that right amen yes sir they they were there or uh uh uh when Jesus said to that bedridden man that had been there laying there maybe for 30 years or so amen but had been there and they heard Jesus say arise and take up thy bed and go into thine house and the Bible says immediately he arose and took up the bed and went forth before them all ain't that right they were around maybe when Jesus was there Amen in that house and and when Jesus looked at that dead girl and said Mary uh or made arise and her spirit came again and she arose amen and they saw the effects of that amen the crying turned into laughter and joy and rejoicing because there was a word that was spoken over a dead uh girl and she Rose can you say Amen on and on and on Amen they were there when they saw the power of that word and what it had and the effect that it had upon the individuals amen you think of this of Martha's own sister Mary that was delivered after she had washed jesus' feet and she was there and she felt the effects of the power of that word when he looked at her and said thy sins which are many are forgiven thee amen what an effect Mary never did go back to that old way of life ain't that right so see the power of His word had been demonstrated to them and upon them amen now the prophet says oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even he as he has given a voice he's given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride can you say Amen oh my have you ever wondered how the voice becomes in the bride amen the bride gets her voice brother brandom says in the last days or in the the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the Le Osan age its Messenger will receive the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry and they that hear him will be blessed can you say Amen they that hear him will be blessed they're not going to dry up they're not going to die off they're Revival ain't going to die off it ain't more it's more than just an emotional thing amen they that hear him will be bless and become part of that Bride of the last day who are mentioned in Revelations 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at NAA has come back to original word a grain again praise God forever yes listen to that authenticated prophet of God who appeared in this last agage what he says to from God the bride will say can you say Amen what he says from God the bride will say Amen see the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing aren't you glad for that see so our word the word comes into us by us listening and taking heed to what the prophet of God in this last stage has said for the word of God comes to the bride to the prophet amen see so we we find that that even though the people were facing an impossible situation they believed they believed the word of Jesus Lord amen they they disregarded the situation they quit looking at the the impossibilities and they began to focus upon what Jesus was telling them can you say amen I believe Jesus has been trying to get us to Focus amen Focus yes sir it's time to focus I think that's where we're coming to manifestation of sons of God matured sons of God we've been tutored long enough been tutored and tutored and tutored can you say amen and the son that focuses upon that tutorship of hearing what the pro or what what the tutor has spoke and and what he's been teaching and he becomes all the he he he becomes more and more like his father because he's understanding the ways of the father he's listening can you say Amen he's not just getting educated in quotes not just getting educated about the Bible he's listening he's taking heed of what that tutor is speaking of the father yes sir it's changing his character it's changing his nature it's changing how he looks at things it's changing how he reacts to things it's changing him yes sir so is this message changing us oh yes sir it's changing this elect yep it's changing the way we act to things is changing the way we do things is changing everything is changing why amen because we're we're listening we're listening to the words of what has been said we're recognizing it's no longer a word of a man it's a word of God to us amen ain't that right amen this word will get you out of situations it'll change the situation if you listen to the word of God yes sir quit trying to do it on your own amen stay faithful stay steadfast amen God will bring you through yes he will he's got to he promised he would amen ain't that right yes sir see so notice how it's changing it's changing us from just a church member to matured sons of God is changing us from sinner to matured sons of God God it's changing us from a religious form Amen to real sons of God to where we can totally rely upon the word of God that's good so they no longer see they they they believed his word they recognized that that Jesus was in his midst they didn't put him as as just some politician or some Governor some preacher some priest and some bishop and some Theologian they didn't put him into that they knew he was in a class all by himself the word was there he was the word made flesh this was God Of Heaven now made flesh and he's standing there and he speaks his word to them they quit acting like things were hopeless they they didn't look at the situation like they were looking at it before he showed up amen why because now they were believers they believe the word of God over the situation they believe the word of God over the impossibility amen they quit looking at what they were looking at and they began to look at what he was saying to them they were they were begin to focus upon what he was saying to them can you say Amen Peter as a man Peter before Jesus ever said anything believe that there was no fish in that Lake he he gave up he ready to go home there ain't no fish there that's what he thought but when he come in the presence of Jesus Christ and and the word came to him and said cast your net out in the deep it chained the S now he started to argueing did he not well Lord we've been here all night May as though he didn't know their situation sometimes we pray and we give God all of our bad situation as if he doesn't know the situation you're in yeah amen good ain't that right he'll give us a word that is so contrary to what we believe and what we're thinking and how we're going to handle that situation Peter said the way he going to handle it he's going to go home but here comes Jesus and gives him a total different way to act that's right cast your net out on the Deep right amen I've done that Lord but the difference was Jesus spoke a word can you say Amen see so Peter had good reason to believe that there was no fish cuz he had been fishing all night but notice the word of the Lord took preeminence can you say Amen Lord and so Peter being willing to ignore just what he had been through he was willing to ignore everything he had just experienced that night and at the word of Jesus letting that word have preeminence he cast his net out in the Deep think about it so was it with Mar and those around when Jesus said roll away the stone amen what it's things right but he had to remind them didn't I tell you didn't I tell you that you're going to see a miracle didn't I not tell you you're going to see the god of Heaven Come on the scene and they had to cast their feelings aside they had to quit looking at the situ and let the word of God have the preeminence can you say amen amen now I think it was the prophet that said why did not why why did he have them to roll the stone he could have spoke the word and the stone would have demolished disappeared would have rolled on its own he said and and I believe it's brother Brandon that said it's because they have something to do and you have something to do can you say man you have something to do amen God doesn't want to sit on the sidelines and cry and moan that's right he wants us to do something it's an Act of Faith that's true that's right wh what what what what if they kept ignoring what what what if they kept arguing well I ain't going to do it I'm going to go home you want to go fish there's the Nets there's the boat you just go help yourself he would have never saw the miracle if if Marth and them refused to roll the well you just roll with that stone I I'll go get a clothes pin for my nose they would have never saw the miracle but there was a people that could have let the word have preeminence in their lives can you say amen I think it's the same way if Abraham would have argued with God instead of coming out of the land that God told him to come out he would have never saw the blessings ain't that right but he obeyed God and the Bible says they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God we're LED by the spirit of God not by some emotion not by some fantastic thing we're not led by S some scientific discovery we're led by the word of God the spirit of God can you say Amen this was the point of him redeeming us Colossians 1118 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence amen do you believe that amen see and so therefore they believed in what Jesus said and by believing in what he said they forsook their reasoning they forsook their natural things their feelings their emotions of what they thought it should be they forsook it all and acted upon what he told them to do you see God doesn't tell us to do something if he ain't plan on doing something are you with me amen God doesn't tell us to do something if he's not planning on working a miracle on your behalf God's God's not that type of a person if he tells you to do something he's interested he he's involved in it now he's involved in your life he's involved in your situation yes sir never seen him let down a Believer yet for that matter I've never seen him let down a sinner yet true God is faithful to all yeah whether they want to acknowledge it or not God is faithful that's right brother can you say Amen but when God tells us to do something we must do it You' got your own free will we've all got our own free will we we every situation that you go through you can handle it the way God wants you to handle it or you can handle it the way you want to handle it that's right brother ain't that right but but we've been given in this day the way that God wants us to handle it are you with me amen amen situations you can handle it the way you want to in your own human way you'll miss a make a mess of it and go ahead God will just keep his hands off of it you you you fight your own battles God won't give his you then then God will let you fight them battles cuz you don't give God the chance to fight the battles God God ain't going to share his glory with you amen God ain't going to share his glory with with sha Martin God wants the glory god is all powerful amen can you say Amen it's not us and God it's God it's not God at the wheel and we're at the other wheel we're not God's co-pilot bless the Lord God Wants It All or Nothing amen can you say amen that's the point he wants to take you and he wants to use you he wants glory out of you praise the Lord yes sir I love the Lord amen so what God tells us to do it we must do it when he tells us to do it now his word tells us what to do and and we could go through a whole list and I'm I'm going to close but here's here's two vital scriptures that he tells us what to do Psalms 1061 Hallelujah if you can put that up there I didn't give him any of the scriptures cuz I didn't know what I was going to speak on praise ye the Lord say that with me praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good stop there is he good when we're going through good times all the or is he does he stop being good some point then why does our praise and I I'm talking about us now me all of us here why would I why would we stop giving him thanks why does it stop then if if our praise and our giving thanks hinges on one thing he is is good everybody say he is good he is good his mercy endureth forever am come on you got to say it loud now he is good good and his mercy endureth forever forever God is good and his mercy endureth forever that's why you to praise the Lord that's why you to give thanks unto him he is good and his mercy endureth forever don't you limit his goodness to how you feel it doesn't matter how you feel well I feel like a rotten apple give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever well I don't know if I'm going to make it it does not matter give thanks unto the Lord for he is good and his mercy endureth forever can you say amenl Peter are you going to do what he said to do huh yes sir there there's there's things that we've got to live by amen well if the Lord would just come personally to me and tell me what tell you go jump in the lake go lasso the moon you'll do it then well he's already told us what to do and there's simple things he doesn't give you things that are totally impossible he doesn't tell you to turn oil into gasoline or whatever amen he just tells you to give thanks unto him and bless His holy name praise the Lord that's right Psalms 1471 praise ye the Lord everybody say praise ye the Lord for it is good is good to sing praises under our God sing praises under our God it is good to sing praises unto our god it doesn't matter if you have a good singing voice sing praises unto our God Amen can you say amen amen why is he going to have you do that for it is what Pleasant it creates an atmosphere quit moaning around your house quit acting depressed around your house quit acting like you just lost your best friend around your house and do exactly what the Lord says I don't care if if he's still in the grave what your problem is still stinking and and this is still going on it has nothing to do with it give praise unto the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God quit B aing and sing unto him for it is pleasant and praise is comely yes Lord can you say amen amen do you love the Lord praise the Lord there's an atmosphere that we must create and it's an atmosphere of Faith amen be people of faith God help us to be people of Faith right well we sing if the doctor gives us a good report what about seeing when he says you ain't got you're going to you just ain't got no hope you're just as ugly as ugly can get that our sing our praising unto God and our singing praises to Him doesn't hinge on any of this God Remains the Same and this is a commandment for us to live by and the more we mature as sons of God we begin to understand this is what he wants of us amen Amen on now you all know if you're just just a halfway smart you all know you get out of one trial you're going to go into the next and human nature is how's the human nature we forget about how bad that one was and we think this is the worst one every trial becomes the worst right but for us it should be easier to believe God God has been good he's brought us out of so many things I think he's just trying to tutor us on how to act in our situations can you say amen you love the Lord amen if the musicians Will Come Bless the Lord good Lord Brother brandham and one service had his audience to repe repeat after him this prayer he said almighty God I believe in you as God the Father I believe in Jesus Christ as thy son I

symptoms get your eyes off of everything that is looking bad yeah and look to God lord look to God that's right look to God have you ever just seen the Earth out of pictures where men have taken

feels all in all that he's got all the stars named yes sir he's got them all named he's measured he knows see we get in our little old bubble and we just think God doesn't know anything about it that
