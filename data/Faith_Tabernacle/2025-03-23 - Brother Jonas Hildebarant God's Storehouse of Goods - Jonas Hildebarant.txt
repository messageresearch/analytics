are so deep and the fire is too hot God proves that he's just God Alone he can move anytime he wants to he can quench the fire anytime he wants to and I'm so glad for the Lord amen well want to just welcome everyone amen and uh just good to see old friends and new friends and uh just uh uh here for a special occasion and I I want to just uh say a special welcome to Andrew amen and God bless you and uh we met him the other day and and invited him uh to the service and and so it was really good to have him and just everyone I I tell you when when the members of the Bride get together uh there's just no U strangers Among Us and um is I know we all go to different Church and but we all believe the same God and it's good when we can come together and there's no I to be broken we just all worship and love the Lord and I'm I'm so thankful for that and U we're here for a a special uh occasion u a lot of you all and and that is uh the dedication of U shuel and uh brother shmaya and and sister Bethany uh uh their little one that God's blessed them with and um I'm going to just read a scripture here and um it's there in Mark the 10th chapter and um the 13th verse we'll start there but it says and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and blessed them Lord all through the scriptures we can see the heart of God toward children and um the Young Generation to come is an important to the Lord and he's taught us as parents to teach our children teach them not just anything that we would want but teach them the way of God teach them the acts of the Lord Lord teach them about the Miracles that had happened teach them of the things that God has done not just in the past but what he's doing in the present that when they would grow up and they would have their children that they could just keep passing this alone and they could experience the same God that we've experienced and experience the same God that our grandparents experienced and it it's it's through generations that God is preserved his testimony his righteousness his acts are preserved and I'm so glad that we have a Young Generation rising up and um children are a blessing unto the Lord and sometimes you know um in the age that we're living in they're going through so much and Satan is attacking our young people like never before and um I think that behooves us as parents to walk very softly before the Lord and and just ask for his help his guidance his wisdom and um and to put up with our children amen and to let them know that God loves them let them know that they're special let them know you know I know we it's easy to let them know what they're not doing and and uh what they should be doing and but one thing about it never never forget to let them know that they are beloved of God and God has chose them for this generation to carry on the message that God has brought and I know that if God carries that we as you know Elders you know we're not going to be around much longer you know I mean we got some years I'm not putting doom on you you're going to die today but uh what I am saying is we're investing in this Young Generation amen because uh they're going to be pastors one of these days singers Housewives and musicians and whatever the Lord would have them amen to be and so we're so happy for brother shamiah and sister Bethany and love them dearly and um you know I've I guess been here for 13 years now and um as most of us know they weren't able to have children and been looking you know always that desire to have a child and even though they had their ups and downs and discouragements as we all do they still maintained the testimony that God's going to give us a child and many times brother shemiah he would talk not as if he's God's going to give it to us but when he's going to give it to us and he would be under such expectation for this and uh I've always admired that faith that he had and uh when he told us that sister Bethany was expecting I thought there there it is God honored the faith God proves once again he's God Alone he's God Alone amen and I'm so glad to serve that kind of a God Amen and God honoring honoring that that faith and they've gone through such a journey um you know it looked like maybe that sister Bethany wouldn't be able to have the child and um she was in danger of in her own body and I know what it was it's just the devil trying to fight and we could look say well she's older and and this I just looked at it as Satan was trying to take a promise and um but they had the Child 3 months 3 months early and a pound and a half and uh that little baby you know you could just basically put him in your palm of your hand and and um but that set off a journey and they were 3 months in the hospital with that that the baby and ups and downs the doctors would give them bad reports and what to expect that would be bad and brain bleeds and such and such and you know when talk to them and and said well we're just believing God to to to to take care of it and God did take care of it God did and uh it it just surprised even the doctors of what God did but we knew what God was doing because God had already promised the baby it was a miracle to begin with and uh so here he is today he's 13 lbs I believe and um uh they've they've not been able to this is sister Bethany is actually first time coming to church uh today out of all these months and um the doctor wanted them to stay home till the baby was able to develop and uh so theyve they've gone through a tremendous journey and uh that God has kept them and um I have just marveled and to see God just taking care of him stage each stage each each part of the journey and here they are today and we're just so delighted to have them and have little shoe bile amen and um we uh I want to uh ask brother Sandy uh brother uh shmay is uh father and we appreciate brother Sandy and sister Hannah and I do want to say um uh brother Jerry and sister Tony I I'm overlooking them I'm sure but right there and uh we appreciate them uh they came up from Tennessee and stayed at brother sheman and sister Bethany's house and they traveled on a daily basis uh backward and back and forth back and forth to Rono taking care of sister Bethany and brother shmaya they'd stay there all day and uh uh and and I know it it was taxing on them and but

name of Jesus that your word would Prevail we ask it believing in Jesus name and the church says amen Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God Arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord you may have your seats if you'd like to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house to be built to the name of the Lord amen now this was a David was getting ready uh to build a temple and we knew that uh he was living in this great House of Cedar and it was perfect uh he had uh nearly conquered all of his enemies and he was at rest and his mind was thinking I want to do something for the Lord I want to he's he's his Tabernacle is over there in a a tabernacle of skins and uh we we can do better than that Hallelujah and so he set out to build this Temple now uh David being a man of war God said uh you know David you've collected God bless you but I'm not going to have you build the temple seeing you're a a a man of war but I'm going to get your son to erect this Temple amen but in through David's Journey he had collected a great abundance of wealth and and I've just got some uh um statistics kind of written here 100,000 talant of gold weighs approximately 3.4 million kilograms or 3,400 metric tons it's 7.5 million pounds of gold and Rome thinks they've got gold well David had a bunch and the value is around 218 billion us hallelujah that's a bit of money and that's just the gold and silver was a 1 million talents which had a value of about 26.4 us billion dollar in total the worth was nearly 240 uh billion dollars uh that David had acquired you know it wasn't just you know his little Treasure Chest that he opened up and well here it is but I think they would have had to have some structures uh to to keep this stuff now my my dad's been preaching on gold and how gold just doesn't tarnish it it doesn't fail if you get perfect 20 4 karat gold it lasts forever and and you know the trials of our faith is more precious than that gold even though it be tried in the fire what a value God has placed on this Temple that he's building in you and I hallelujah amen so David David had accumulated a great Storehouse of goods and uh and he built up all the necessary wealth and the materials to build on this temple of God and men dwelling in houses and Tents but where dwells the Lord amen and you know I could imagine David as he's getting prepared to uh speak this uh uh encouraging the people he says all you have need of is already been provided for the next step of your journey God has supplied it all can we say Amen we've got the finances we've got the materials we have the god-given talent Hallelujah we've got the wisdom every everything is here God has provided for the building of the temple now it it didn't come easy there were a lot of sleepless nights David fought many of battles to get that accumulation of of goods to build this Great temple of God you know I I could just just think of those battles that that he would have fought and at times the odds to win were utterly impossible but God he promised to fight our battles aren't you grateful Hallelujah I can hear David encouraging those people saying often I would remember how God was with Joshua how Victory came to him as long as he stayed in his commission oh a bit of a warning there Hallelujah he how how he took great walled cities crossed the Seas routed the enemies with impossible odds even to the stopping of the sun hallelujah amen sometimes we can almost stop time when we're on our knees in prayer and and you know the enemy is maybe just right there and and well Lord I need just a little more time and and so you go to praying and it seems as though time just stand still for you Hallelujah because we've got an enemy that we're after sometimes and we're not going to settle for just about taking care of most of the enemy but we want a total Deliverance hallelujah we're looking for full Victory can we say amen amen many were the afflictions of David Hallelujah but God delivered him from the all Hallelujah we fought many of battles and at times the odds was impossible but God has been our captain amen I can hear David encouraging the people often I would remember about Joshua Hallelujah David encouraging himself just like Joshua I too was anointed Samuel came and he honored me though I was forgotten by my daddy and by all of them but yet God knew that I was going to be the one needed to take this position Hallelujah you maybe feel sometimes like you go unnoticed like God doesn't even see that you're there but he knows his timing is always perfect he's just waiting for the moment and he will come speak to you you could just pull it down here little brother Judah Hallelujah because God always knows amen hallelujah through David's life he would have been encouraging them our hardest battles were those of distraction Hallelujah when we got distracted from the true work of what we were supposed to do we would be fighting that great battle in our thoughts but God had promised and never once failed I learned David did that we must look to what is true no matter how impossible it may seem now we're human and there may be moments when my own men David speaking even myself second guessed their callings Hallelujah there's moments in life where you know we get moved aside and we see that it seems like that's not it just wait God will bring it to pass according to his will you know the scripture says to wait I say wait upon the Lord hallelujah be of good courage and he will strengthen thy heart Hallelujah so we have to be careful that the devil doesn't talk us out of our callings because he knows that we are powerful in our callings Hallelujah God has Place certain gifts in your life for a reason he didn't make a mistake by having you come to earth right now you know he could have had Elijah for this moment brother he he could have had Joshua come today but God didn't choose those God chose you to be here today Hallelujah God predestines his word by bringing it to pass Hallelujah so today is the day of our visit today the day that God needs you to be standing in your position ready to take the battle it's not a time for another but it's your time to arise and be doing Hallelujah do you believe that so I wouldn't let the devil talk you out of your moments I wouldn't allow him to get you to sway off into some deep end Hallelujah but I would stay instant and honest I would be saying Lord here I am I'm not going to make my own way but Lord I'm ready when you call when you call I want to be ready Hallelujah myself not being a minister often I've got to be ready when I'm called Hallelujah I can't just you know uh sit back and let everything go easy and then all of a sudden get a phone call and okay tomorrow I'm preaching it just wouldn't work that way but I've got to be prepared amen whether I get used a lot or whether I get used a little I'm I'm perfectly content to be just a shiny Little Penny in his hand because I'm in his hand then hallelujah it doesn't matter to me if I'm a silver dollar Hallelujah can we say amen hallelujah there's a lot of times that that human nature it usually happens to young men around 25 Hallelujah where we really start thinking that we are something We're Young we're strong we don't wake up sore Hallelujah we might think it's tough when the kid keeps us up for an hour praise the Lord but really we're just in the learning stages Hallelujah bless the Lord and we're learning that you know uh uh being married sometimes it's really important to come home and do the dishes brother brandom taught us that didn't he there was that moment he come home and it was just not quite settled down and mom needs some help doing the dishes Hallelujah can I get an amen mommies hallelujah amen so you make sure that you've got that dish rag ready and you roll up those sleeves and uh you get yourself ready to be put to work you know my daddy was a a a a brother of five boys they had six Sons and my grandmother was bound and determined and now I I'm from up in that Northern saskat and Canada area and and just keep in mind uh I I heard brother Ronald Spencer say this you'll let a a man with Stage for cancer or whatever out praise you I'm going to say it like this don't you dare allow a Canadian Moss Back dust the cobwebs out of the corner I'll praise you Hallelujah it'll go down on record and when you get there God will say why did you hold back why were you so downtrodden where's the victory in your life just arise and say thank you Jesus Hallelujah you gave me air to breathe today you put a heartbeat in my chest you must still have need for me to be here so Lord I'm going to do it willingly I'm going to be happy about it Hallelujah I'm going to do it with all my heart Hallelujah bless the Lord that human side is tough you know it's a real real uh adversary that greatest enemy that we see looking at us in that mirror when we wake up in the morning uh you know uh for me it's getting worse every day my hair's getting less and less and I'm getting uglier and uglier Hallelujah I'm going to start looking like brother wendle pretty soon you make sure you tell him I said that praise the Lord but it doesn't matter how I look because to God I am fearfully and wonderfully made I'm in his Perfect Image Hallelujah so I'm just going to be happy I'm going to be content to do his bidding amen hallelujah I better get back on my notes I'll get myself in trouble with somebody it's okay I'm going home on Monday amen David could think back in zle as he's encouraging uh those that were're going to build on the temple you can read it in 1st Samuel 30 the very time that we stood on the battlefield on the opposing side of our brothers oh just think of that how he's encouraging the Saints you know we we got into a odd position here and uh here we were and our brothers over there but somehow God rich in Mercy helped us to avoid that conflict oh aren't you grateful when God moves on the scene when our our human emotion sometimes gets us into a spot that is not right and but God comes and rescues us hallelujah they paid a bit of a price they got back to their homes and what did they find everything Burnt Over zle was nearly a desert Place their wives and their children and and all their dogs and everything was gone oh what a what a Time Hallelujah the anguish and the thoughts that almost destroyed us all but God rich in Mercy we called on the name of the Lord and surrendered our own thinking and asked for his guidance and God Mighty in battle came and brought back our families out of slavery you know some of them were maybe addicted with drugs and some of of them was wasting their time maybe gaming and and some of them was enticed out into the world with the Fashions but we as a great Army of Believers commissioned by God Ran after them with prayer and we fought a bloody battle Hallelujah before the fight we felt all washed up and and David's men was even in a position to Stone him Hallelujah but we prayed and we fasted he's telling his people calling on the name of the Lord there was a group of them that wasn't even able to make the full Journey because we get tired sometimes In the Flesh it wasn't their faith it just was that natural human side it just got wore down can we say that happens sometimes the disappointments and the things that happens in human life it just gets us tired but you know as a body we just agree and we pray together we had a great testimony today of the little boy that was a a gift from God every child is but this one's just magnificent Hallelujah amen a Binding Together you know a closeness to pray there's a need there's a child that's a a three months premature just a tiny little being let's bind together they need our help God will strengthen them hallelujah oh bless the Lord so they agreed to leave some of them back there praying and seeking God on on our behalf that David and those remaining could go forward and and overcome the effects of Lady AA Hallelujah though they were small in number yet God caused a great defeat on the devil and restored back all of our loved ones Hallelujah it was a great battle but our families was restored now arise all of you up and be doing Hallelujah for all you have need of in life's journey God has already provided for you Amen in Isaiah 52: one the Bible says awake awake put on thy strength o Zion put on thy beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come unto thee the uncircumcised and the unclean Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion I found this so interesting to arise and sit down it just made me think now to arise is to stand and in this context that that part to sit down means not be moved establish yourself fortify your thinking Hallelujah loose means to be freed to loosen to open oneself so turn loose yourself God has equipped you shake yourself you have over every weapon to overcome Hallelujah aren't you grateful amen we know that there was a brother brandom talked about that serpent with its charm and and how you know its eyes would would look up and and there would be that little bird that would be flying over and and if it could make eye contact with that bird right it would just slowly seduce that down into its clutches and and it would it would be killed and brother branam he typed that so many times to us and our lives with that lady of SC an atmosphere that's all around in the world aren't you grateful you can come to church and it helps you just focus your eyes off a lady you seea Hallelujah that charm of the devil that comes into our lives sometimes you know it could be just something small uh maybe it's a message you get from somebody at work and and it gets your mind thinking or maybe it was a a person you went to school with that all of a sudden resurfaces and the memories come back of back when you was living in a darkened State back when you had that Amnesia still on your eyes and the Devil's coming and gripping at you trying to seduce you back into the things of the world it's actually really quite simple to break that you just have to look up you know and see Jesus and the powers of Lady AA are totally broken just take your eyes off of that whatever is pulling you away from God when you get down into your prayer closet how many of us pray sometimes I made it pretty simple sometimes right we pray sometimes s amen and we go to we kneel down and we're getting ready to pray and all of a sudden you know we just get started dear Lord thank you for and then that phone just reverberates oh I didn't put it on like it's silent but it's vibrating and maybe it's something a bad need oh the devil all of a sudden makes you feel really spiritual I better check it Hallelujah and trying to get you away from fellowship with God hallelujah but David's telling us to arise build on the temple don't be distracted right nor left but look to the temple build on the temple later on we found out that Solomon yeah thanks Isaac so good to have Isaac with me amen and uh he's our Miracle boy we just about lost him at three months as well and God rich in Mercy has has healed him and is making him a mighty warrior for the faith amen I'm sure proud of him why don't you give him a hand amen hallelujah praise the Lord he's only 15 so he's not marriage material yet but you give them a few years girls and maybe we'll come back Hallelujah and then be careful to break the charm of the devil to get our eyes off of Lady AIA to get our eyes to focus in on what are we here for God has brought you here for a purpose do you believe that brother brandom he preaches the message I forget the title of it right now and he starts it off saying that the the roof trusses are for a purpose you know the house is for a purpose they didn't just build it here haphazard for nothing the vehicle wasn't wasted materials but those materials was put together for a purpose and God has you here right now for a purpose you're not just here to use air Hallelujah God has a design for you here at this present time for a purpose you're needed in the Army hallelujah hallelujah and and we've been given a great gold mine we're living on a gold mine do you believe that we've been given this Mighty Gold Mine the message of the hour that's restored all the truth back hallelujah oh bless the Lord but you know a gold mine isn't any good if you just sit on it I've got the message Hallelujah but I don't read it it's just not going to help you Hallelujah you've got to dig into a gold mine to get its wealth out of there Hallelujah so so dig down or dig those ditches deep and then God will fill it up Hallelujah everything we have need of has been provided can you say Amen so take courage God has equipped you for the battle Satan's attack has been totally utterly defeated he really doesn't stand a chance he's fighting a losing battle and my dad always calls him a dumb devil he always keeps coming back and thinking that he's going to win and he just loses Hallelujah yesterday I had some of you all stood how many had been healed and and you looked around every person had been healed of a disease or something at some time how many has overcome and you can remember in your mind things that were seemed like Mighty mountains but God came and you overcame that why is it it's because you've been given the equipment for the last hour to arise amen and to be doing you are the one that is designed for this hour to take the Rapture Hallelujah God could have called somebody else he could have had but he didn't choose anybody else he chose you he knew that you would be made of the right materials you know when you're building a house you don't want the insulation showing up on the first day you're not looking for the shingles you're doing the foundation well the foundation's been done built Hallelujah the walls have gone up and now all that's left is just the Rapture Hallelujah and so the right materials to take a Rapture are here they're present with us right now oh can you say Amen do you believe that I little let's get a good Canadian amen hallelujah can you say amen amen hallelujah it's all right you've got this the devil doesn't stand a chance he's been defeated Hallelujah before the foundation of the world in the mind of God we had a lamb that was slain can we say Amen that made us sinless spotless perfect and white that we could take a Rapture it's not my righteousness it's nothing that I've done that's good but it's God that's living within me it's God that shows Mercy hallelujah oh bless the Lord there was a Jacob and there was an Esau praise God the Esau's out there the Jacobs are all over here you know Jacob was a bit of a shyer I know you've got your bad spots but still you are the called of God hallelujah so you be real careful what you think of the next guy because you're talking about God's Property God's got them made that way for a purpose hallelujah it's not up to you to change them it might be up to you to pray for them hallelujah hallelujah and after you're done praying for them like I said yesterday you might understand Hallelujah it might be for a reason that they're that way Hallelujah Lord bless the Lord Jesus is still here his word is still perfect his word is where it's in the bride amen hallelujah can you say amen amen so know ye not ye are the Temple of what the Holy Ghost and and what was it that overshadowed Mary so the same thing that brought forth the very seene of God the perfect child is what's living within me Hallelujah that's just about would make a Baptist want to say amen amen we ought to be pretty happy Hallelujah yes sir God has redeemed me the Mighty conqueror my kinsman redeemer hallelujah amen amen oh bless the Lord he's given me everything I have need of to overcome so it's up to me to choose choose you this day whom you will serve Hallelujah I'm just determined to win and you know it's not because I'm anything special but it's because I've Got The Winning Side living within me amen so I can't lose you know when Joshua went to the walls of Jericho he met the angel it was a he he was totally convinced in his position he pulled his sword out and he said are you for us or are you against us and the angel just stood there so proud said I am the captain of the host of Israel the Lord and you know the angel did something that was really quite odd but it caught Joshua's attention he knew the Vindication he had heard this before the angel said take off your shoes yeah for you're standing on Holy Ground Joshua would have thought I've heard that testimony before this is the mighty one that was in the burning bush and he is right here right now and we are going to take this Jericho hallelujah oh bless the Lord the enemy shivering they're a little bit nervous because someone is taking God at his word hallelujah in the message of seeking after Jesus brother brandom says and now listen to this close any Divine promise of God the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will we know this quote if you could if you can look at it right and believe it in that way that it's written say God it's your word so so now we're not just believing for a million dollars you know he promised that the righteous wouldn't beg for bread but he didn't promise to give you a million dollars all right but we got to look at what this says right here and now stand on that promise not some imagination not not some uh denominational Rich get rich type of a pay your tithe and offering type thing Hallelujah you've got something so much richer than what that is anyways you've got the truth and the truth is making you free the truth's going to bring you into a Rapture I don't care if I if I lose my house if I if I lose my vehicles I've got Jesus I don't need all of that to make it in a Rapture it makes it a little easier down here sure and I work hard I've got two businesses and and I work 60 hours a week most times I believe in hard work you ought to work hard if you're not working you better get a job right message Believers shouldn't be on Social Security unless they have to be Hallelujah so work hard arise and be doing if you're building on the temple it's going to be work you're going to get a little sweaty Hallelujah I know being a mom is a lot of work I've got four kids at home bless the Lord and only one Angel and it's not Isaac Hallelujah it takes a lot of Courage for a mom to stand in those times of of uh uh complex teenage issues but I'll say this as a teenage person if there's some here you don't have to be like the world you can be better than that because you've got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah anointing your flesh you don't have to go through those ups and downs and emotions Oh They'll be there they're going to try to affect you and you'll make mistakes but arise get up try again Hallelujah trying to help these mamas out a little bit amen my dad at home last Wednesday he's our pastor brother Kelly and he was called to the ministry uh uh uh I'm making it tough on that video camera uh he was called to the ministry when he was 39 uh he'd never ministered in his life uh he didn't pray at church he was a deacon um for many years but uh um we lived an hour and a half away and we never missed a sermon Sunday and Wednesday and and I went to school with not a single believer around me except for my family I had one sister and my mom and my dad and and and uh I know what it's like to stand all by myself I know how hard it is to fight the battle I went to public school and uh and I know how hard I was on my mother Hallelujah and uh once I had Isaac uh I went and bought my mom some flowers saying I'm so sorry I didn't realize I was that awful he was asking for it Hallelujah a mother is a really special thing amen you know you seen brother brandham honor his mother all of his life and you know even his dad he kicking him out of the house for praying at the table and he made it tough on him but brother brandham put up for his daddy he loved his daddy and in the end his daddy gave his heart to the Lord so I don't know how long it'll take I don't know the criticism and the anguish but just love them you don't have to fight back you don't have to prove your point you just hold on with love am and that is temple building Hallelujah that's putting Treasures in that Treasure House Hallelujah bless the Lord amen I'm going to skip a little bit we'll be here for a long time otherwise the Bible says in uh Psalms 146:5 happy is he that hath the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God which made heavens and earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the Lord loosest the Prisoners the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord preserveth The Strangers he relieve the fatherless and the widows but the Way of the Wicked he does he turns that upside down hallelujah oh David he seen that all can we say Amen but God will be ready and forthcoming to those who are in the lowest circumstance our miseries will be no barrier in the way of his helping us aren't you grateful for that amen we'll bless the Lord amen you know the older I get the longer winded I become I promis brother Shawn I would keep it nice and you know not too long or he might call the musicians on me David commissioned the people now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God Arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God into the house Lord that is to be built to the name of the Lord hallelujah the Bible tells us in first Corinthians 6:19 what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own amen you're a temple you are the house of God's prayer Hallelujah you are the house of God's praise amen you know the world doesn't have any hope outside of you bless the Lord your neighbors don't have any hope outside of your testimony let them do something good for you God will reward them for that amen God has put up great stores of goods to bring to fruition the faith muscles they're already within you but they're getting exercised exercise for that Rapture Hallelujah God's putting up great stores it's not complicated Hallelujah we don't have to do Penance and beat ourselves and torture ourselves when we make mistakes we just have to say Lord I'm sorry end our eyes try again amen hallelujah did you know that there's only one difference between the righteous and the unrighteous they both fall but the righteous gets up again the only difference is the getting up again so fall doesn't separate you from the love of God hallelujah it's the getting up again part so I'm encouraging you today there might not be in a trial now but the next one that comes along just remember this trial is not to break me it's not to destroy me but it's to chip me and to make me into that perfect image of Christ is to get my faith to a level that I can take a Rapture Hallelujah don't get we in it all look to the promise look to the temple Hallelujah Jesus Christ has provided the way of Escape Hallelujah he is the way the truth and the life that's the way I want to go the Broadway leads to destruction the way of those that fall and stay down but to the righteous that arise Hallelujah we've got a straighten narrow road that we're walking oh Hallelujah seems like it Teeters from one side and God just puts us back in the middle of the road and what did he see when he seen that the bride uh uh preview there was that little bit in the very back and they was falling to the side and then to the other side and brother brandham found himself standing on a floor saying get back in line Hallelujah so it's not complicated we don't have to worry we've heard the message Shalom amen it'll bring us back in line every time when we get unbalanced it'll just restore that Faith back to the middle of the road hallelujah hallelujah amen allow God to drop the spiritual Amnesia off of our eyes that our attitudes can be right amen take your eyes off of the trial and look to the promise hallelujah amen Shake thyself from the Dust arise and sit down be grounded in faith oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck God has great things for us coming amen you know one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible is a shadra Paul and Silas in prison and you know uh they were doing the king's work and in that King's work they got a tithing that was a little bit different they got stripes and you know their offering was prison time sometimes uh doing the will of God puts you in an odd spot and but you know they didn't allow that to take their eyes off of the promise there they was in prison bound and I I remember it explained uh that that they put their feet in stalks says that way those backs that was all torn up would be down in the dirt and and in the filth of the cell getting infected causing a a lasting pain and scarring and there they was in this state of turmoil this state of great discomfort what a trial and and there they were surrounded by all sorts of prisoners uh people that had no hope uh people that had fallen away from God maybe brought up in a good Christian home but just straight away from the faith and and there they are and they began to sing and you know I don't know what they sing but my mind says right now uh only trust him only trust him only trust him now yes that's right he will save me he will save meise the Lord he will save me now and you know you could hear that it would have probably started a little bit soft maybe just a little bit of a hum and and and then that that presence started started to move out from those brothers and and the Prisoner that would have been close by he would have been like oh I remember feeling a presence like that when I was just a child I I thought I had I had lost God I I thought here I am Bound in prison I I've murdered somebody I thought there was no hope for me but here God rich in Mercy places the SE Gene of God in what seemed to be total despair but there they were in the will of God doing God's bidding yes and that spear would have continued moving out down the road to maybe a a child that that uh was brought out into drugs and living in Despair and and all of a sudden the prison shook the Bible says and the prisoners heard they heard the wooing of the spirit they felt the presence of God come on the scene and and they said oh there's hope Jesus has died for me yes and you know out of that there rose up an Army and the general came and he said oh what's happened here all the prisoners have escaped and he was about to kill himself and Paul said hold your sword we are all here and there we could see a change that had happened sometimes our trials takes us just into the perfect will of God sometimes those trials that seem like they're going to destroy us are just getting us into position for God to use us can we say Amen aren't you grateful for him amen I'm grateful for him bless the name we're living in a battle but with a mighty conqueror leading us to the victory every time David encouraging the church everything's going to be okay yes sir arise and be bu building on the temple if I could call our musicians only trust him amen hallelujah you know if the devil has stripped you of your prayer life don't worry it's not too late to get it back am how do you know where to find something you go back to where you lost it and you know if you've lost the presence of God just go back where you left it where you laid it down where the devil has robbed you of something just go back there and just start from that place what did Brother brandham tell us just go back to where you left God you'll find him right there waiting for you he wants to fill you more than anything else in the world Hallelujah he is here to meet your need if we just uh bow our heads in prayer as we would uh ask the Lord to [Music] come dear Jesus we thank thank you for once again visiting us today Lord oh I could have preached a lot longer but I just felt now is the time to Hearts were softened oh maybe there's somebody in a prison cell but you can be like Peter you can just fall asleep God's got it all in control he'll show up in the darkest time of your trial and bring you the greatest victory we seen today a young child what a testimony of God's faithfulness I pray we would remember as a stake down in our lives this moment that Jesus cares maybe not in our timing but just hold to that promise our brother our sister was testified that they held to the promise why won't you do the same today my friend whatever need you have God is more than [Music] able don't ever give up brother brandom never gave up Jesus never gave up you know there he was he could have called Legions of angels there he was sweating great drops of blood falling to the soil but he said not my will but thine will will be done oh maybe the cross seems heavy maybe the burden seems great but God he's able to deliver us out of all Christian solder why don't you just rise your hand and say thank you Jesus forgive me for my lack of faith forgive me for my doubting moments in those human ways where I make mistakes as David did but I'm a soldier I'm going to get up Lord I going to commit all that I have I place it in your hands you've reserved this group of people for the day of rapture Lord You've equipped us with the greatest message that's ever been on the face of the Earth we are not lacking we are not defeated but we are a mighty Invincible Army and we March forward with thus saith the Lord we have the king's mind we thank you Jesus oh we bless your name father we love you in prisoners [Music] chains with bleeding stries oh why don't you commune with your God right now you can sing you can shout you

bless your name oh I bless your name he's worthy John wept he seen nobody worthy to open the book then he heard a voice John weep not for there's a worthy one amongst us behold the line of the tribe
