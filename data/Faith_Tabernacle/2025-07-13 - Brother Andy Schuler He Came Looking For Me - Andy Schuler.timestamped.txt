[7:26] Shout to the Lord of the earth. Let us

[7:34] Power and majesty,
[7:37] praise to the King.
[7:41] Mountains bow down and the seas
[7:46] will roar at the sound
[7:50] of your name.
[7:54] [Applause]
[7:56] I sing for joy at the work of your hand.
[8:02] hand. Forever I'll love you. Forever
[8:08] I'll stand.
[8:11] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[8:17] in you. Can we stand and sing it now?
[8:22] My Jesus,
[8:26] my savior.
[8:29] Lord, there is none like you.
[8:34] And all of my days
[8:38] I want to praise all the wonders of your
[8:44] mighty
[8:47] love.
[8:49] [Music]
[8:52] My comfort,
[8:56] my shelter,
[8:58] your tower of refuge and strength.
[9:04] Oh, let every breath,
[9:07] oh that I am
[9:11] never cease to worship
[9:16] you.
[9:20] People shout to the Lord. All the earth,
[9:25] let us sing.
[9:27] Oh power and majesty
[9:31] praise to the king.
[9:34] Oh mountains bow down and the seash
[9:39] will roar. Oh, at the sound
[9:44] of your name
[9:48] [Applause]
[9:49] I sing for joy at the work of your
[9:54] hands.
[9:56] Oh, forever I'll love you, Lord. Forever
[10:01] I'll stand.
[10:04] And nothing compares to the promise I
[10:09] have.
[10:11] in you.
[10:16] Amen. Are you thankful for that this
[10:18] morning? Amen. Are you glad to be in the
[10:21] house of the Lord this morning? Amen.
[10:28] Can we sing that song? Meeting in the
[10:30] air.
[10:34] You have heard of little Moses in the
[10:37] bull rush.
[10:39] You have heard of fearless David and his
[10:42] sling.
[10:44] Oh, you have heard the story told of
[10:47] dreaming Joseph
[10:50] and of Jonah and the well we often sing.
[10:55] There are many, many others through the
[10:59] Bible.
[11:01] Oh, I should like to meet them all. I do
[11:04] declare.
[11:06] Oh, by and by. The Lord will surely let
[11:09] us meet them. At that meeting
[11:14] in the air,
[11:17] there is going to be a meeting in the
[11:22] air. In the sweet, sweet by and by.
[11:28] I am going to meet you, meet you over
[11:33] there in home beyond the sky.
[11:39] Such singing you will hear, never heard
[11:42] by mortal air. It will be glorious, I do
[11:47] declare.
[11:49] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[11:54] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[12:00] Many things will there be missing in
[12:03] that meeting.
[12:05] For the mourers's bench will have no
[12:08] place at all.
[12:11] There will never be a sermon preached to
[12:14] sinners.
[12:16] for the sinner had refused to heed the
[12:19] call.
[12:21] There will be no morning overweight were
[12:25] loved ones. There will be no lonely
[12:29] nights of pleading prayer.
[12:32] Oh, all our burdens and our anguish will
[12:35] be lifted
[12:37] at that meeting in the air.
[12:42] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[12:47] the air in the sweet, sweet by and by.
[12:53] I am going to meet you, meet you over
[12:58] there in that home beyond the sky.
[13:03] Oh, such singing you will hear, never
[13:07] heard by mortal ear. It will be
[13:10] glorious. I do declare.
[13:14] Oh, and God's own son will be that
[13:18] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[13:24] Now there the doubters will be missing
[13:27] all together.
[13:30] All the skeptics will be absent on that
[13:33] day.
[13:35] There will be no grumbers present to
[13:38] disturb us. Oh, and the Achans will be
[13:42] busy far away.
[13:45] There the saints will have his shield
[13:48] upon their foreheads,
[13:50] dredged in rain, and none but ransom
[13:53] ones will wear.
[13:56] Oh, all who have the wedding garments
[13:58] will be present
[14:01] at that meeting in the air. Oh, there is
[14:07] going to be a meeting in the air in a
[14:12] sweet, sweet by and by.
[14:17] I
[14:20] to meet you over there in that home
[14:24] beyond. Can you turn around and shake
[14:26] your neighbor by the hand and say, "I'm
[14:28] going to see you there."
[14:33] We'll be glorious. I do declare.
[14:37] Oh, and God's own son will be that
[14:42] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[14:48] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[14:53] the air in the sweet, sweet by and by.
[14:59] Oh, I am going to meet you, meet you
[15:03] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[15:09] Oh, such singing you will hear, never
[15:13] heard by mortal air. It will be
[15:16] glorious. I do declare.
[15:20] Oh, and God's own son will be that
[15:24] leading one at that meeting.
[15:28] Can we sing it one more time? Oh, there
[15:31] is going to be a meeting in it. Won't be
[15:36] too much longer. Sweet, sweet by and by.
[15:41] Oh, I am going to meet you, meet you
[15:45] over there in that home beyond the sky.
[15:51] Oh, such singing you will hear, never
[15:55] heard by mortal ears will be glorious, I
[15:59] do declare.
[16:02] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[16:07] leading one at that meeting.
[16:10] in the air. Can you give the Lord a hand
[16:14] clap of praise? Oh my.
[16:18] Amen. Brother Tanesus.
[16:35] [Music]
[16:39] I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[16:46] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[16:53] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[17:01] And I know
[17:04] it's going to rain.
[17:08] Now in a time when it was dry,
[17:12] not a cloud up in the sky. Oh, the
[17:16] children of Israel begin to reason why.
[17:22] So they went to God's man cuz they
[17:28] didn't understand.
[17:31] He said, "Go look. It's written in the
[17:35] sky."
[17:37] Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[17:45] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[17:53] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand,
[18:01] and I know
[18:04] it's going to rain.
[18:09] Now they opened up the door. Oh, a
[18:13] seventh time they looked once more. A
[18:16] tiny cloud was rising from the sea.
[18:24] They begin to understand
[18:27] the time for rain was at hand. Just like
[18:32] God
[18:34] said it would be.
[18:38] Oh,
[18:39] I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[18:46] Oh, yes. I see a cloud like a man's
[18:51] hand.
[18:53] Oh,
[18:55] I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[19:01] And I know
[19:05] it's going to rain.
[19:09] So today we have no fear
[19:13] for a cloud did appear. Oh, the prophets
[19:18] scream, "My bride, go through that
[19:21] door."
[19:23] Oh, have faith and just believe. A new
[19:29] spirit you'll receive.
[19:32] The rain
[19:34] is just about to pour.
[19:38] Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[19:46] Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[19:54] Oh,
[19:55] I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[20:02] And I know
[20:05] it's going to rain
[20:09] now. The bright is looking above.
[20:14] for the chariot rain of love to fill
[20:19] their hearts with peace they have never
[20:24] known. Oh, and now she's become God's
[20:29] unfolded
[20:31] mystery.
[20:33] The promised word has already been sold.
[20:39] Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[20:48] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[20:55] Yes, I see a cloud like a man's hand.
[21:03] And I know
[21:06] it's going to rain.
[21:12] Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[21:15] Amen.

[22:08] prevail.

[33:47] [Applause]
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for Calvary?
[33:59] Years I spent in vanity
[34:02] and pride.
[34:04] caring not my Lord was crucified.
[34:09] [Music]
[34:10] Oh knowing not it was for me he died on
[34:16] Calary.
[34:21] Oh mercy there was great and grace was
[34:27] free.
[34:28] part and there was multiplied to me.
[34:35] There my burden so found
[34:40] at Calary.
[34:44] [Music]
[34:46] Oh, by God's word at last my sin I
[34:51] learned. Oh, then I trembled at the law.
[34:56] I spurned. Oh, till my guilty soul
[35:01] imploring
[35:03] turn to Calary.
[35:09] Oh yes.
[35:11] See, there was great and grace was free.
[35:16] You see pardon there was multiplied

[35:58] [Music]
[36:03] God bless you. You probably know it. You
[36:05] can sing along.
[36:09] There we were in Egypt
[36:13] under Pharaoh's mighty hand. We were
[36:18] bound by a wrong religion.
[36:22] Caught in the creed of man.
[36:26] Then a prophet from the desert
[36:30] starts preaching all around. God has
[36:35] heard our prayer. Jehovah has come down.
[36:40] [Music]
[36:42] Moses sure was no great speaker.
[36:46] Nothing polished I could tell.
[36:50] But we all began to notice
[36:54] that he knew Jehovah will as he stood
[36:59] behind the pulpit
[37:02] showing signs of God's great power. It's
[37:06] Jehovah here. A message of the hour.
[37:13] On the journey through the desert about
[37:18] 30 miles high was a cloud that led us
[37:24] every day and a night a pillar of fire.
[37:29] If you ask for my opinion,
[37:34] all that I can say is Jehovah's here to
[37:40] lead us all the way.
[37:44] I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the
[37:49] way.
[37:51] A pillar of fire by night and a cloud by
[37:58] day. I know Jehovah's here to lead us
[38:03] all the way.
[38:05] [Music]
[38:06] And I will follow everything he has to
[38:11] say.
[38:14] I know Jehovah's here to lead us all the
[38:19] way.
[38:20] [Music]
[38:21] A pillar of fire by night and the clouds
[38:27] by day. I know Jehovah's here to lead us
[38:33] all the way.
[38:36] And I will follow everything he has to
[38:41] say.
[38:43] Oh, I will follow everything he has to
[38:48] say.
[38:51] Yes, I will follow everything
[38:57] he has to say.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give me the word.
[39:20] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[39:24] the word.
[39:27] Oh, it's a light that I might see. Just
[39:32] give me the word
[39:36] for it's my total victory
[39:41] over every situation.
[39:45] Give me the word.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:49] It's been tested. It's been tried.
[39:53] Searching minds are satisfied.
[39:57] Even though the story's old, the message
[40:01] still is true.
[40:06] It's been ridiculed. It's been changed.
[40:09] Still its power is never changed. Oh, it
[40:14] will stand the test forever. And give me
[40:18] the word.
[40:21] And give me the word.
[40:25] Oh, make it plain and clear to me. Give
[40:30] me the word.
[40:33] Oh, it's a light that I might see. Just
[40:38] give me the word
[40:41] for it's my total victory
[40:46] over every situation.
[40:50] Give me the word.
[40:53] Now I don't want it watered down,
[40:58] sugarcoated or profound.
[41:01] Give me basic truths that last the
[41:05] course of time.
[41:09] Oh, preach it strong. Preach it clear so
[41:14] that all the world can hear.
[41:18] It has changed my life forever. Give me
[41:22] the word.
[41:25] Oh, give me the word.
[41:29] Oh, make it plain and clear to me.
[41:33] Give me the word.
[41:37] Oh, it's a light that I might see. Just
[41:41] give me the word
[41:44] for it's my total victory
[41:49] over every situation.
[41:53] Give me the word as we turn into our
[41:55] pastor. Give me the word. Can we stand
[41:59] and sing it now? Oh, make it plain and
[42:02] clear to me. Give me the word.
[42:08] Oh, it's a light that I want to see.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Give me the word.
[42:15] [Music]
[42:16] It's my total victory
[42:20] over every situation.
[42:24] Give me the word.
[42:27] Last lines. Over every situation,
[42:32] give me the word.
[42:37] Well, aren't you glad that you have the
[42:39] word?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. What else would we do? Amen. If we
[42:44] didn't have it as our guide. And how
[42:47] true it is that the I believe it's David
[42:51] that would tell us that thy word is a
[42:54] lamp unto my feet, a light unto my path.
[42:57] Amen. And um you know, we're living in a
[43:00] dark age, aren't we? And um you can be
[43:03] seated for just a moment, but living in
[43:05] a a a dark time and uh people just don't
[43:10] know what to do. And and we've seen, you
[43:13] know, the Bible uh prophesy of this time
[43:17] and people running to and fro and
[43:20] throughout the land trying to find the
[43:22] truth and um trying to find answers
[43:27] uh for the day that we're living in. and
[43:31] you know, but to be able to have those
[43:34] answers and not just because of a man
[43:37] taught us and we're just following some
[43:40] man as um you know those that follow Jim
[43:44] Jones or David Caresh or whatever, but
[43:48] uh this this word has been vindicated
[43:50] and so vindicated that it's put the
[43:53] heart of the believer at rest. And and
[43:56] I'm so glad for that. I'm so glad to
[43:59] know that Jehovah's leading us
[44:02] &gt;&gt; and he's going to lead us all the way.
[44:04] Amen. And we may not know the way, but
[44:07] he knows. And if we just continue to
[44:10] follow him and his direction, Amen.
[44:13] we'll know we'll make it. Ain't that
[44:15] right? And uh sure we've got trials and
[44:18] troubles and we all go through things
[44:21] and Satan working overtime and uh you
[44:26] know putting thoughts in our minds and
[44:29] trying to discourage us alone. But
[44:31] there's just something you know I I
[44:34] personally just thank God for
[44:36] predestination
[44:37] &gt;&gt; that we can rest in that knowing that
[44:39] there was a seed put in us before the
[44:41] foundation of the world.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Satan didn't have a choice about it. I
[44:45] didn't have a choice about it. You
[44:47] didn't have a choice about it. It was
[44:48] God that made the choice. And God
[44:52] determined and he's been protecting us
[44:54] and he will protect us through
[44:56] everything that we go through. Amen. And
[45:00] u I want to just say it's uh good to
[45:03] have brother Mark and Sister Crystal
[45:04] back with us. Amen. And uh trust you all
[45:08] had a good time. And uh um then uh you

[51:26] new faces and old faces and Amen. And
[51:29] just look just speaking of that time
[51:31] when there'll be a great uh great
[51:34] gathering and a great reunion. Amen.
[51:36] Over on the other side. Amen. Praise the
[51:39] Lord. Well, if you have your Bible with
[51:41] you this morning, I'd like to invite you
[51:44] to turn with me to a few scriptures.
[51:48] And uh uh brother Sean, we uh had a had
[51:54] had a little series uh at home there uh
[51:58] that I preached and it was the the
[52:01] series was the people of the book. Amen.
[52:04] And we were just looking at
[52:07] the people that are spoken of in the
[52:09] book. And we are his people. We are the
[52:11] people of the book. Amen. That that book
[52:14] that book is is is speaking of us. Amen.
[52:17] And but uh the first installment of it
[52:20] was uh I gave a subtitle of He came
[52:23] looking for me. Amen. And so that's why
[52:26] by God's grace that's what we'd like to
[52:29] just speak to you for a few minutes here
[52:30] this morning. And we'd like to look at
[52:33] Genesis chapter 3. We're just going to
[52:35] read one verse in Genesis chapter 3.
[52:38] Also Luke chapter 19 and John chapter 6.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:44] And I'm going to set this down and take
[52:46] my jacket off.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; The heat doesn't bother me. The humidity
[52:58] is another story.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:03] Praise the Lord. No, it's just fine.
[53:05] Amen. Genesis 3:9, just one scripture
[53:09] here. And the Lord God called unto Adam
[53:12] and said unto him, "Where art thou?"
[53:16] Where art thou, Adam? Amen. You know,
[53:19] it's such a striking scripture be, and
[53:22] there's many scriptures like this in the
[53:24] Bible.
[53:25] God knew perfectly well where Adam was.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; But yet, the cry went out, "Where are
[53:32] you, Adam?" It was it was expressing
[53:35] what was in God's heart. He wasn't he
[53:38] wasn't wondering where is Adam? It was
[53:40] his heart was crying oh Adam where are
[53:43] you?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; The one that was so close to me where
[53:46] are you?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; In Luke chapter 19 verse 10
[53:54] all the way
[53:57] to the New Testament. Amen. For the Son
[54:00] of Man is come to seek and to save
[54:05] that which was lost.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And then John 6:44,
[54:16] I'll just you don't have to turn to it.
[54:17] You I'll just read it here. It says, "No
[54:19] man can come to me
[54:22] except the Father which hath sent me
[54:24] draw him, and I will raise him up at the
[54:29] last day."
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[54:33] prayer this morning. Father, Lord, it's
[54:36] truly an honor, Lord, to just be
[54:37] gathered together, Lord, with my
[54:39] brothers and sisters of like precious
[54:42] faith this morning. Lord, those that
[54:44] hold the testimony of Christ and Lord
[54:47] have tasted the goodness of God. And
[54:51] Lord, we have so much in common. And yet
[54:53] from different parts of the country,
[54:55] Lord, maybe even never meeting in life,
[54:58] yet we are connected, Lord, through you.
[55:01] And so we just are appreciative of that
[55:04] this morning, Lord. And we thank you for
[55:05] your word, Lord, and for your presence,
[55:08] Lord, that comes and anoints your word.
[55:10] For we could read this Bible as many
[55:12] scholars have through the ages, but
[55:14] without your spirit, Lord, to make it
[55:16] live, to anoint it, and to give us
[55:19] revelation, Lord, it would just be an
[55:21] academic exercise, just like any scribe
[55:25] or Pharisee or scholar. But Lord, you've
[55:27] called us to so much more than that.
[55:29] You've called us to a living word this
[55:32] morning and a a living revelation, Lord.
[55:35] And so, Father, we just ask your
[55:37] presence would come and just anoint
[55:40] every person in the building tonight or
[55:42] this morning. Father, anoint me, Lord.
[55:46] Anoint every hearer, Father. May we all,
[55:49] Lord, with spiritual ears of
[55:50] understanding. Receive your word this
[55:52] morning. For your word is life and it is
[55:55] truth, Lord. And we we rest our souls on
[55:58] it this morning. And we just love you
[56:00] and thank you. I thank you for brother
[56:02] Shawn, Lord, and Lord, his uh
[56:05] faithfulness, Father, his sacrifice to
[56:07] lead this flock, Father. I just pray
[56:09] that you continue to bless him, Lord,
[56:12] and and all those here, Lord, that work
[56:14] with him, Father. Each one, Father, we
[56:16] thank you. And we just commit this time
[56:18] to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[56:23] Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[56:29] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to just speak
[56:33] about this idea of he came looking for
[56:36] me. Amen. And we'll come back keep
[56:39] coming back to that theme this morning
[56:41] because uh we're taught in the message
[56:43] and we're taught in the the Bible that
[56:45] that we never sought God.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came seeking after us as we
[56:52] see here right away in the beginning in
[56:54] the book of Genesis. It wasn't Adam when
[56:56] he fell that ran back to God and was
[57:00] trying to be reconciled to God and was
[57:02] crying out, "Oh, father, I've sinned.
[57:04] Help me." It wasn't him. Amen. It was
[57:06] God that went looking for Adam. And his
[57:10] heart's cry was, "Adam, where are you?
[57:12] Let me find you. Let me bring you back."
[57:15] Amen. And so God executing his plan
[57:20] through all time is what we want to look
[57:22] at here this morning. Now, Adam and and
[57:25] all men and and and and all of us, amen,
[57:29] we were thoughts in the mind of God and
[57:33] and you know, our message has
[57:35] illuminated to us this from the
[57:37] scripture that we are our thoughts of
[57:41] God before the beginning,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; before there was time, before anything
[57:46] was created. In the eternities, God
[57:49] thought of you.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had thoughts of children
[57:53] and he had thoughts of his family.
[57:56] And he in his thinking they were not
[57:59] flawed.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't think of children that have
[58:04] sickness. Amen. That were stooped under
[58:08] the the the weight of sin.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; But he his thoughts of children were
[58:13] those that reflected his glory.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. and had his character and
[58:20] expressed his characteristics. Amen. And
[58:23] they were uh uh shining in the
[58:25] brightness of his glory and they were
[58:28] perfect and full of faith. Amen. They
[58:31] weren't they weren't uh harried by the
[58:34] hounds of hell and they weren't uh
[58:36] weighted down as I said with sickness or
[58:39] sin and the sin condition.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; That wasn't in his original thinking.
[58:43] Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; His original thought for you was a
[58:46] perfect spotless son or daughter of God.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; But yet having a character
[58:57] &gt;&gt; that was developed
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. in the crucible of a sinful world.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; So when he saw you, he saw you perfect
[59:10] but with tempered by that character.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Random told us about power and
[59:18] he said absolute power without that
[59:20] character is satanic. So God would never
[59:23] give us that power or that authority or
[59:26] that place without that character to go
[59:28] with it. And that's his own character.
[59:31] And we would express different portions
[59:35] of his character. Oh, it's so beautiful.
[59:37] Amen. And so he had that thought of you.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; That is God's image of you, his
[59:45] children.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; And he had that image. And the Bible uh
[59:51] uh places it with a symbol symbolized as
[59:55] a book of names.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham said that the
[1:00:00] book of redemption held the name. Amen.
[1:00:03] The the lamb's book of life holds our
[1:00:05] names, but it's not a it's not a name.
[1:00:07] He said it's not a name like Orman
[1:00:09] Neville or some name that you would your
[1:00:11] earthly name that you're given, but it's
[1:00:13] your image.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. What he saw in the eternities, his
[1:00:18] thought concerning you, it's symbolized
[1:00:21] by writing a name in a book or
[1:00:24] describing
[1:00:25] the character of a child in the book.
[1:00:28] Amen. So, so it's it's a record of of
[1:00:32] God's thoughts.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every one of them must be
[1:00:37] expressed.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I like to call it God's family
[1:00:43] album.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Because that's what it is.
[1:00:47] Amen. Every thought that every every
[1:00:49] child that he has is in that book.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said this in proving
[1:00:55] his word. He said, 'Now, I think we
[1:00:58] should just be the most happiest people
[1:01:00] in the world.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just think of this. He says,
[1:01:04] 'I hope that I haven't impressed my
[1:01:06] audience to believe that it's something
[1:01:07] that I do myself. You know better than
[1:01:10] that. I am your brother. See, but I do
[1:01:13] know that God is here. And I know that
[1:01:16] he has given something to us that we
[1:01:19] cannot explain it. The word of God
[1:01:22] claims that it should be here at this
[1:01:24] time and it gives us identification.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; It gives us identification to know that
[1:01:35] this people, this chosen, elected,
[1:01:38] called out, predestinated.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; But we all know, he says, now that's a
[1:01:43] big word, predestinate. But we all know
[1:01:45] that it's the truth. We absolutely know
[1:01:48] that the infinite God predestinated all
[1:01:52] things by fornowledge before the
[1:01:54] foundation of the world. Even the lamb
[1:01:57] was slain and every name that would ever
[1:02:00] be on that book was put on the book
[1:02:03] before the book was ever written.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, how many knows that's
[1:02:08] true?" And Jesus came to redeem those
[1:02:12] that were in that book.
[1:02:14] In the Bible, the lamb came from behind
[1:02:16] the curtain, taking the book, opened the
[1:02:19] seals that it was sealed with. For he
[1:02:21] came to claim all he had redeemed.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; He's the intercessor making
[1:02:27] intercessions for all those he had
[1:02:30] redeemed. All whose name is written in
[1:02:33] the lamb's book of life is redeemed.
[1:02:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. And of
[1:02:38] course, Ephesians 1:4 tells us,
[1:02:40] "According as he has chosen us in him
[1:02:42] before the foundation of the world, that
[1:02:45] we should be holy and without blame
[1:02:47] before him in love."
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he wanted to have a family and
[1:02:53] he wanted to share his life with his
[1:02:55] family. He wanted to share experiences
[1:02:57] with his family just as we do with our
[1:02:59] natural family. Amen. We have fellowship
[1:03:01] and there's close bonds and there's ties
[1:03:04] and we go through life and do things
[1:03:06] with our family and enjoy that
[1:03:07] fellowship. And that's what he wants
[1:03:09] with us.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. To have fellowship with his
[1:03:12] family. And that's what he had at the
[1:03:14] beginning with Adam and Eve.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Right. Adam never stopped being a son of
[1:03:18] God, but he lost his fellowship with
[1:03:21] God.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a separation that came
[1:03:24] because of sin. There was a chasm. Amen.
[1:03:28] as brother Brandham put it, a gulf that
[1:03:30] that opened up and separated man so that
[1:03:33] he could never have that closeness of
[1:03:35] fellowship with God. But his plan was,
[1:03:39] his thought was in the beginning that he
[1:03:41] would give his children authority over
[1:03:43] the earth and that they would subdue the
[1:03:46] earth.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that they would have his
[1:03:50] character to rule and reign on the
[1:03:53] earth.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that way, he would have
[1:03:57] sort of a camaraderie with them, right?
[1:04:00] Because he's the God of the universe.
[1:04:02] And so man is the God of the earth. They
[1:04:04] could they could kind of compare notes
[1:04:06] as it were, right? He could understand
[1:04:09] at some level what what God is going
[1:04:11] through. Amen.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so God established this
[1:04:17] basis for fellowship. And it was good.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; It was good. But the thing that I want
[1:04:23] to kind of point you to this morning and
[1:04:27] and we'll keep coming back to this
[1:04:29] thought that we want to kind of over
[1:04:32] override all of this is that all this
[1:04:34] time it's God doing it.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; It's God initiating it.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's plan and he's executing
[1:04:43] it.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; It was his thought in the beginning and
[1:04:47] when Adam fell, it was him going after
[1:04:50] Adam.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It was God initiating
[1:04:53] because God is the one that is has the
[1:04:56] plan.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So when man fell, God started seeking
[1:05:03] after man to restore that fellowship
[1:05:05] back. Yes, he did.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; As we said, Adam wasn't seeking God. God
[1:05:10] was seeking man. Adam was hiding from
[1:05:12] God.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; He He was trying to get away. He
[1:05:17] realized his condition and his his
[1:05:19] nakedness. Amen. And so he ran away from
[1:05:22] God. Oh, how many times do we do that?
[1:05:24] Amen. Oh, when we should we should be
[1:05:27] coming to church, but somehow the trials
[1:05:30] of life or we fall or or we make a
[1:05:32] mistake or we get cold. Amen.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And and all instead of going to the
[1:05:38] place where we can uh receive what we
[1:05:41] have need of, Amen. where the only one
[1:05:44] that can fix it,
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; we run away.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see people staying away
[1:05:50] from church instead of coming to the
[1:05:52] place where they could find healing and
[1:05:54] grace
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; in time of need.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; So he should have been running to God.
[1:06:01] But God, what a scene. God running after
[1:06:04] Adam,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; saying, "Adam, where are you?" But the
[1:06:10] beautiful thing about God, and I love
[1:06:13] this about him, he doesn't start
[1:06:15] something that he won't finish. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; That's something that we can all rejoice
[1:06:23] in.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't go looking for Adam
[1:06:27] in futility.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; He found He knew where he was. He found
[1:06:33] him. He went right to him and found him.
[1:06:37] When he sets out to do something, he's
[1:06:39] going to do it.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how powerful any how
[1:06:48] how exalted in hell any demon power
[1:06:51] might be. There's no devil that can stop
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; from doing what he sets out to do.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And so he set out to redeem Adam. Is he
[1:07:10] going to do it?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Is it Is he going to complete it? He set
[1:07:13] out to find him. Is he going to do it?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He doesn't try.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; God doesn't say, "Well, let's give it a
[1:07:22] shot."
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's more me when I'm trying to fix
[1:07:27] something.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Well, let's try this. Well, I don't
[1:07:29] know. Let's try that.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hey, it worked. What do you know? I'm as
[1:07:34] surprised as you are. Doesn't work that
[1:07:36] way with God.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; God doesn't try things.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't have experiments.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's good, bro. That's good.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not an experiment in a
[1:07:46] laboratory.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Your life is a sure thing.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Your call. Amen. Your election, it's a
[1:07:54] sure thing.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; God's not experimenting on you. Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; He knows the beginning from the ending.
[1:08:01] He lives in the eternities. He doesn't
[1:08:02] even live in time.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in eternity, he sees all of
[1:08:07] time together. And so God had slayed the
[1:08:10] lamb already when Adam fell.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; In his mind in eternity, the lamb had
[1:08:17] already been provided knowing that there
[1:08:19] was going to be a fall. And so when he
[1:08:21] went looking for him, he's Adam, I've
[1:08:22] I've already got, you know, the it's on
[1:08:25] its way.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he prophesied that it would
[1:08:28] come in due season.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; So So this is God's work. Amen. This is
[1:08:36] this is God initiating redemption.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; So from that time in the garden until
[1:08:45] now, God has been doing that work.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He's been seeking out
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; that which was lost.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; You don't say, "I've lost something."
[1:09:00] Unless you've had something.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. You say, "Oh, I
[1:09:05] lost my keys." And you find Brother
[1:09:08] Amos' keys. And I said, "Those are those
[1:09:09] are brother am those are keys, but
[1:09:11] they're not my keys. Those aren't the
[1:09:13] ones I lost."
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Good point. Good.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; He came to see seek and to save that
[1:09:19] which was lost.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That which was in that original
[1:09:25] book.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And from that time, he's been seeking
[1:09:31] them out.
[1:09:32] Praise his holy name
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; because they're being born in time on
[1:09:36] earth.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that that each one
[1:09:41] he knew each uh each bed where each seed
[1:09:45] would be planted.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Each time that each one would come
[1:09:50] forth in.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; You don't think this is an accident?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. It doesn't matter how badly
[1:10:04] they are buried in sin.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. That's
[1:10:07] right.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; You see all of this? So, I looked up
[1:10:12] this word setting.
[1:10:15] Setting, right?
[1:10:17] A a setting is a backdrop.
[1:10:20] So, if you're going to tell a story or a
[1:10:24] do a play or some sort of uh you know
[1:10:29] production or or or something like that,
[1:10:31] there's a setting that it takes place
[1:10:34] in, right? It's a time and a place. And
[1:10:38] you know, if you if you ever read a
[1:10:40] book, uh, you know, a story book or
[1:10:42] something, they'll describe
[1:10:45] the setting, the the time, the era, the
[1:10:48] the the place where it takes place, and
[1:10:51] the people in the area, maybe the city
[1:10:53] or what's happening at the time that's
[1:10:56] relevant to the story. All of that is
[1:10:58] the setting for the story. All of that
[1:11:00] is just the backdrop that you need to be
[1:11:03] able to focus then in on the story. But
[1:11:07] the story is the point.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; The backdrop just helps to accentuate
[1:11:12] the story.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It helps it helps build the story. And
[1:11:18] but it all points back to whatever the
[1:11:20] plot is that the author has in their
[1:11:22] mind.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And all of this is a
[1:11:26] setting that we're in. This earth is the
[1:11:29] setting.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, a setting is is something
[1:11:34] that holds like a diamond. Like if you
[1:11:36] have a diamond on your ring, the the the
[1:11:38] the the piece of gold or whatever it is
[1:11:41] that holds that diamond is called a
[1:11:43] setting.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's designed to hold it
[1:11:47] in such a way that the diamond can can
[1:11:50] exhibit its beauty.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's not to detract from the beauty of
[1:11:55] the diamond, but it's to accentuate it.
[1:11:57] It's to draw your attention to the
[1:12:00] diamond.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But it holds it in its place. That's
[1:12:05] good.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And it's there to support it.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; So, it's important. Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And this this uh earth that we were born
[1:12:14] into, the condition that we were born
[1:12:16] into, the family that you were born
[1:12:18] into, the church that you were born
[1:12:20] into. Amen. The the time even the age
[1:12:23] that we've been born into, wherever
[1:12:26] you've been placed, Amen. That's the
[1:12:29] setting for your story.
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] Each child of God, each seed of God,
[1:12:36] each individual
[1:12:37] name that's on that book has been placed
[1:12:40] in a setting
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and like a diamond, they're going to be
[1:12:43] revealed.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; And they're going to shine forth in the
[1:12:47] glory.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That he places in each one.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that. Amen. Because
[1:12:56] sometimes if we're not careful, we can
[1:12:57] just think that that things that happen
[1:12:59] to us and and and our lives are just
[1:13:02] random, right? And just I don't know why
[1:13:04] this came into my life. I don't know why
[1:13:06] this happened. I don't know why I've got
[1:13:08] these family members. I don't know why
[1:13:10] this or why that. It's all part of the
[1:13:12] setting.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And just as much as the seed is
[1:13:16] predestinated, so is the setting.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And it's all working together for your
[1:13:21] good.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that the scripture?
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he could say all these
[1:13:27] things, they're working together for the
[1:13:29] good of them that are called according
[1:13:31] to his purpose.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we shouldn't look at these
[1:13:38] things like, you know, it's random or
[1:13:40] it's out of control.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; No. For the child of God, that's never
[1:13:44] the case.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Trial comes in your life. Amen. It's
[1:13:49] like Job. God allowed those trials to
[1:13:52] come in Job's life. He had to get
[1:13:54] permission. Satan had to get permission
[1:13:55] from God to bring those trials into
[1:13:59] Job's life.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; What about a child of God? Amen. In this
[1:14:03] age,
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's got to get permission to come
[1:14:06] and to test you and to tempt you. Yes,
[1:14:08] sir.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he does that, it's for a
[1:14:10] purpose.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; That's what makes a Christian so much
[1:14:14] different than the world. One of the
[1:14:16] things, Amen. is that we can go through
[1:14:20] the same things that somebody else is
[1:14:22] going through,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; We can go through the same trials that a
[1:14:25] co-orker is going through, maybe, you
[1:14:27] know, sickness or losing family or
[1:14:29] things in our finances, whatever.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; The same things, but yet we are not
[1:14:35] frustrated because we know there's a
[1:14:37] purpose behind all these things.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It gives us hope and joy
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; knowing that our father has us in the
[1:14:48] palm of his hands.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So from that time until now, God has
[1:15:00] been seeking out his children wherever
[1:15:03] they are. And brother Brown described it
[1:15:05] like a it could be at the a the bottom
[1:15:08] of a pond,
[1:15:10] right?
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Yes. a lily in the bottom of a pond in
[1:15:13] the in the scum and the mud in the muck.
[1:15:15] It could be buried in the the the the
[1:15:18] worst sin that you could think of.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; That's true, brother.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people, we look at people and
[1:15:24] we say, "Well, they don't they don't
[1:15:25] really look like they would accept this
[1:15:28] message, so you know, I'm not going to
[1:15:30] worry about them." Well, this person,
[1:15:31] oh, they look like they could be a
[1:15:33] message believer.
[1:15:35] That's not the way God does his
[1:15:37] business.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes the most unlikely. I'm so
[1:15:41] thankful. Amen. He takes the He He takes
[1:15:44] those that that the world would cast
[1:15:45] away.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He takes the the the muck and the
[1:15:49] m and he reaches down into it.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; He came where we were so that we could
[1:15:55] go where he is.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And he reaches down. And he reaches
[1:16:00] down. And sometimes it's way down.
[1:16:04] And he grabs a hold of that seed and he
[1:16:06] begins to tug on that heart.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Think about how God found Abraham.
[1:16:16] He was in a false God shop.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't pick up pick some holy
[1:16:23] man standing out on a mountain somewhere
[1:16:26] offering sacrifices to Jehovah.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He picked the guy that was selling
[1:16:30] idols.
[1:16:33] Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He went down and and reached down to
[1:16:37] Abraham and began to tell Abraham his
[1:16:41] thoughts concerning him.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; It was God seeking Abraham. Abraham
[1:16:47] wasn't looking for him.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was minding of his own
[1:16:51] business, doing his own thing.
[1:16:53] But God initiates and tells him and
[1:16:56] makes promises to him.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I will. I will. I will. That's what he
[1:17:01] says to Abraham. Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; This is my promise to you. This is what
[1:17:06] I'm going to do for you.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:12] There was no backup plan for Abraham.
[1:17:14] Well, you know, if Abraham doesn't work
[1:17:16] out, we've got another guy over here.
[1:17:19] No,
[1:17:21] that's not the way God works.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; God started a work in Abraham and he
[1:17:26] finished a work in Abraham.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew what he was doing when he
[1:17:30] called him. Now, we excuse me, we read
[1:17:34] the whole story,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; right? We see Abraham from the beginning
[1:17:37] to the ending
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; and we say, "Oh, sure." You know, I I
[1:17:41] can see that. I can see he's the father
[1:17:42] of the faith. I mean, look at how how
[1:17:45] much faith he had to, you know, uh to
[1:17:48] sacrifice Isaac and to to hold on to
[1:17:52] God's promise to to have his body
[1:17:54] changed. I mean, he's a he's a type of
[1:17:57] all. He's the father of the faith. Is
[1:17:59] that right?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And we look at that from the beginning
[1:18:02] of the ending and we see that Abraham
[1:18:04] was truly one of the elect of God.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; But what about at the beginning?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; What did he look like? Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; But when God calls a man or woman, he
[1:18:16] always backs them up. And he backed
[1:18:19] Abraham up. Let me let me just read to
[1:18:21] you before I get too far here. I've got
[1:18:23] some some quotes that I do want to read
[1:18:26] uh here this morning.
[1:18:29] And and brother Brandham said this.
[1:18:32] He said that uh
[1:18:38] he said now and and you've probably
[1:18:40] heard this many times, but I just want
[1:18:42] to bring this to your remembrance. He
[1:18:43] said, "Look, uh you say I spoke with
[1:18:46] tongues." He says, "That don't mean
[1:18:47] nothing. That don't mean a bit more than
[1:18:49] if you go out here and play a tune on a
[1:18:51] guitar or something. It doesn't mean one
[1:18:54] thing. Though you spoke with tongues,
[1:18:55] though you shouted and run up and down
[1:18:57] the aisles and cried tears still like
[1:18:58] you had peeling onions. He says that
[1:19:00] that don't mean a thing unless that
[1:19:03] everyday life backs up just exactly and
[1:19:07] stays with it.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that what we're talking
[1:19:13] about here this morning is that life.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's the that's the whole
[1:19:19] crux of this is that what God wants his
[1:19:23] children expressing is that his life
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; and that's what when we talk about the
[1:19:29] diamond shining that's what we're
[1:19:30] talking about living a life the life
[1:19:33] being expressed we're not talking about
[1:19:36] spiritual gifts
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; right we believe in spiritual gifts
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; but spiritual gifts are not the sign
[1:19:43] that you have that life
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; right that's right
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; amen that was the difference between uh
[1:19:49] what the Pentecostals were holding on to
[1:19:51] versus what the messenger taught us.
[1:19:54] That's right.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were looking to the gifts.
[1:19:57] Now, uh we've been looking at this,
[1:19:59] brother Sean, a lot lately is, you know,
[1:20:01] in this message, we many have done the
[1:20:04] same thing, only they don't do it with
[1:20:06] speaking in tongues. They do it with
[1:20:08] believing God sent a prophet.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, that's well, if you
[1:20:12] got that, then you got the Holy Ghost."
[1:20:14] Well, that's good, but that's not the
[1:20:17] evidence that you've got the Holy Ghost,
[1:20:18] right? And so, it just comes along. What
[1:20:20] we're looking for is the life.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's what God is looking for.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, he gave us that little
[1:20:27] parable about the the the Herford cattle
[1:20:30] and how they would be of all different
[1:20:32] types of brands, which mean they were
[1:20:34] owned by different uh different men and
[1:20:36] different ranchers and things, right?
[1:20:39] But they all had a tag that indicated
[1:20:41] they were a purebred Herford
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; cattle, right?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; They that was a tag that that talked
[1:20:48] about the life, the blood,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; the what what the life was on the
[1:20:53] inside.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's looking for.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And that's what differentiates. Now, uh
[1:21:00] if we go a little further, this is from
[1:21:02] the infallibility of God's spoken word.
[1:21:06] He said, 'Now, from the beginning, he
[1:21:09] says, if we take uh the patriarch Jacob,
[1:21:12] he was a wandering boy. He was a runaway
[1:21:15] boy, and he'd run away from home because
[1:21:17] he was afraid that Esau was going to
[1:21:20] kill him because of something that he'd
[1:21:22] done.
[1:21:23] And he run away from home. Yet, that boy
[1:21:26] was anchored in God.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Even running away from home, there was
[1:21:32] something anchoring him. Amen. Yet that
[1:21:36] boy was anchored in God by a divine
[1:21:39] promise that was made to Abraham.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Now that divine promise that was made to
[1:21:44] Abraham was God's idea.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; That was God's word,
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; God took that word and he spoke it and
[1:21:52] he made that promise to Abraham. And
[1:21:54] that that had so much power that it
[1:21:56] anchored Jacob into that promise.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:02] And so Jacob laid anchored in that
[1:22:06] divine promise that was made to Abraham.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. He says that's just
[1:22:11] the same promise that laid anchored in
[1:22:14] Jacob lays anchored in every born again
[1:22:18] believer tonight.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. God calls sovereignly without
[1:22:24] anything you done about it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] Oh, that should just take all the the
[1:22:30] scare out of us.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; That should just make us just rest.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That should just make us just just
[1:22:38] worship and appreciate him.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly without anything
[1:22:47] you done about it. You say, "No, wait a
[1:22:49] minute. I'm the one I had a a a burning
[1:22:51] desire in my heart." And what about all
[1:22:54] those things that Brother Brandon
[1:22:55] preached about desperation? and you have
[1:22:56] to get desperate and and and and hold on
[1:22:59] to the the horns of the altar. And
[1:23:02] that's all true, brother, sister.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's all true. But that desperation,
[1:23:09] that desire,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; that pull
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; is God pulling you.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; You can't have that on your own
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; because we read the scripture, no man
[1:23:20] comes except the father draws him first.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly. He decides it's
[1:23:30] time for you to come.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; And he puts something in your heart and
[1:23:35] you think it's your idea.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; I need God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Something in me just needs God.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; And you thought that came from you.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And he put that in there in the perfect
[1:23:46] time and place.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; God calls sovereignly without anything
[1:23:51] you done about it. He says, "There's
[1:23:54] nothing you done." Men say, "Oh, I
[1:23:56] sought God." He said, "No man has sought
[1:24:00] God at any time."
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But it's God seeking man.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Not man seeking God.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; God seeking man. And then he quotes that
[1:24:12] scripture. No man can come to me except
[1:24:13] my father draws him first. You get it?
[1:24:15] It has to be God drawing man.
[1:24:19] He says, "Man in his nature is a
[1:24:21] castaway.
[1:24:22] He's an alien. He's away from God." Now,
[1:24:26] you know what an alien, we think of
[1:24:28] alien, we think of like the, you know,
[1:24:30] Area 51, space flying saucers and stuff,
[1:24:34] right? But an alien is someone who's not
[1:24:36] in their right country.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're not home.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; They're in a foreign land.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; That's what he's talking about.
[1:24:48] Hallelujah. He says he's an alien away
[1:24:51] from God. The right position is with
[1:24:54] God. Amen. Then God by grace has to draw
[1:24:59] him to his own side
[1:25:02] and all that the father hath given me
[1:25:04] will come to me. Oh, it's it's so
[1:25:07] beautiful, brother, sister, because he's
[1:25:09] the one that puts that decides it's
[1:25:11] time. And he puts the desire in there.
[1:25:13] And like I said, he doesn't start
[1:25:15] something that isn't going to be
[1:25:16] finished. He doesn't just try things. So
[1:25:18] if there's a call in your heart to come
[1:25:21] to him, you can know with assurance
[1:25:25] that it's his will for you to come.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; All that the father has given me will
[1:25:33] come to me. No way at all. He says there
[1:25:37] ain't enough picture shows. There ain't
[1:25:39] enough dance halls. There ain't enough
[1:25:41] burlesque shows in the country to keep
[1:25:44] you away from God.
[1:25:46] When God goes to drawing back yonder
[1:25:50] before the foundation of the world, when
[1:25:51] he put your name down that you'd come,
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; you're coming.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, you might be a hypocrite
[1:26:02] and work up and say this, that, or the
[1:26:04] other." And I I mean, but I mean when
[1:26:06] God calls, so what he's talking about is
[1:26:08] again spiritual gifts or signs, right,
[1:26:10] that that people point to. You could be
[1:26:12] a hypoc hypocrite and exhibit those
[1:26:16] signs. You could be a hypocrite and
[1:26:18] shout in church,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; right? But he's talking about when God
[1:26:23] really calls.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; He says when God goes to calling, you
[1:26:30] don't stop and say, "Well, I'm a
[1:26:32] Christian. These things don't bother
[1:26:33] me." That shows you're not.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. What he seeks, he always
[1:26:43] finds.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And every name that was on that
[1:26:49] book, he's going to find every single
[1:26:53] one.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; There was never a time where God went
[1:26:56] looking for someone and gave up because
[1:26:59] he couldn't find them.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; But the beautiful thing is he uses you
[1:27:04] and I as partners,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; right? We're all part of this work,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; right? were fellow workers with him
[1:27:11] drawing and calling, getting his word
[1:27:13] out.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that call comes through a
[1:27:17] preacher. Sometimes it comes through a
[1:27:20] mother.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it comes through a friend
[1:27:23] witnessing.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; He works through flesh.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And then when he finds you, we have to
[1:27:35] surrender to him.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; You know the the the the example I love
[1:27:43] so much is the example of Mary in the
[1:27:46] scripture. Amen. Because Mary was
[1:27:50] prophesied about
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; a virgin shall conceive.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; All those years before and for many
[1:27:58] years they wondered what is that? What
[1:28:00] is that going to be? What is it going to
[1:28:01] look like? And maybe people tried to to
[1:28:05] fulfill that. But Mary was just minding
[1:28:08] her own business.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Random said that that they
[1:28:11] were talking about God's word.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like we do. We think about
[1:28:17] God's word and we talk about it. And he
[1:28:18] said he comes when he's talked about,
[1:28:21] right? And he says they were talking
[1:28:23] about his word. But that angel came to
[1:28:25] her and told her, Mary, that scripture
[1:28:29] in Isaiah, a virgin shall conceive, that
[1:28:32] is you. Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; That is you in the scripture.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Now, her name Mary wasn't written there.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But she was in the scripture.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't up to her to figure that
[1:28:52] out.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; God showed it to her.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; God came and pointed her called her and
[1:28:58] pointed her out. Mary, that's you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; It was a revelation from God. So what
[1:29:03] was Mary's part?
[1:29:05] Yay, Lord.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I accept.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I receive it. I believe it.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And she walked in it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. She believed it and walked in it.
[1:29:24] That's good.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; The the the the footsteps that she took
[1:29:27] in her life, the decisions she made
[1:29:30] reflected that revelation that she had.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. Right there.
[1:29:34] That's good.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; That she had found her name in the book.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus when he walked on earth, the way
[1:29:40] that he walked and the things that he
[1:29:42] said and he conducted himself because he
[1:29:45] knew who he was and he had found himself
[1:29:48] in the volume of the book.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; What about us? G.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to find ourselves in the
[1:29:55] volume of the book.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to know what God's word says
[1:29:59] about us.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say your name. It doesn't say
[1:30:02] my name specifically, but we find
[1:30:04] ourselves by revelation.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God will come by revelation and
[1:30:10] reveal it to you.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I'm one of them.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And when you get that revelation, then
[1:30:17] you begin to read in the scripture, you
[1:30:19] say, "That's talking about me." Hey,
[1:30:21] he's talking about me again.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you know? Well, God
[1:30:26] told me.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I didn't make something of myself. I
[1:30:30] didn't come up with the idea.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; But God showed me my place in the book.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He showed me where the spirit and
[1:30:39] the bride say, "Come." He showed me
[1:30:41] where there's a spotless, sinless,
[1:30:43] virtuous bride of of Christ. He showed
[1:30:45] me where there's overcomers in Leodysia.
[1:30:49] and on and on and on.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And we find ourselves in the book.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't search us out. He didn't
[1:31:04] he didn't search out Mary just to leave
[1:31:06] her alone or he doesn't search you out
[1:31:09] just to well, you know, um good luck.
[1:31:13] You know,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Go go go join a church. And
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; you know, uh, hopefully hopefully we'll
[1:31:18] see on the other side. Hopefully you'll
[1:31:20] make it through.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; The nature of God, one of the one of
[1:31:25] the, uh, one of the attributes of God is
[1:31:29] supreme faithfulness.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; If you wonder what faithfulness looks
[1:31:37] like, God is supreme
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; faithfulness. He promised never to leave
[1:31:43] us or forsake us. He's the one that
[1:31:47] started the work. He's the one that
[1:31:48] finishes the work. He's the alpha and
[1:31:51] omega and everything in between. He's
[1:31:53] the author and finisher of our faith.
[1:31:55] He's the giver and sustainer
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; of our lives.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Sustainer means the one that keeps it
[1:32:03] going.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's right there when you
[1:32:08] need a charge like a battery. He makes
[1:32:11] sure that you get what you need.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; He's the Jehovah Gyra that's there to
[1:32:16] provide. Amen. When you're down and you
[1:32:19] need a lift, he can provide what you
[1:32:21] have need of.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Remember his original thought for you is
[1:32:28] close fellowship with him.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Praise. walking with him with no
[1:32:35] hindrance, with no chasm of sin between.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; But walking in closeness of fellowship.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we walk with him in the
[1:32:49] light as he is in the light.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And if we step out, we're not condemned.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We're just convicted. We're just
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; chastised a little bit.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that right?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Because every child is going to make it.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; It's like that song says, he didn't
[1:33:08] throw away the clay.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He just
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; He just fixes things back up. He's got
[1:33:15] grace for us.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; But we we don't uh we don't take
[1:33:19] advantage of the grace. And in other
[1:33:21] words, we don't frustrate the grace.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; We're not out looking to live like the
[1:33:26] world.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; But we have grace when we make a
[1:33:29] mistake. Yeah.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; If we step out, it doesn't ruin his
[1:33:35] plan.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; It might mean a little more hardship for
[1:33:38] you,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; right? We we reap what we sow. So, we
[1:33:42] might go through something, but but he's
[1:33:45] always provided his blood.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Grace to get us through. Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Holy name.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] Sometimes we can grieve him. The Bible
[1:33:58] says, is that right? We can push him
[1:34:00] aside.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; We can get a little cooled off.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Put your halos down,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; We can grieve him
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; by our unbelief. But even in those
[1:34:14] moments, the Holy Spirit is still
[1:34:16] seeking.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You see, it doesn't just
[1:34:23] start with that. It didn't just end with
[1:34:25] that first time. But the Holy Ghost goes
[1:34:28] seeking into your life.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It happens when you come to
[1:34:32] church. Oh, you didn't know that was
[1:34:34] happening, huh? When your pastor gets up
[1:34:36] here and begins to preach the word of
[1:34:38] God,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; the word begins seeking.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; It's looking and and penetrating into
[1:34:47] your life.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's cutting away things that
[1:34:50] are not pleasing to him. You say, "Well,
[1:34:53] what is that? What's not pleasing to
[1:34:54] him?" Well, remember, he has an image.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And right now, we don't reflect that
[1:35:01] image completely. There's things that
[1:35:03] have to be chipped away.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; It's like brother Bam talked about that
[1:35:09] sculptor, Michelangelo, who sculpted the
[1:35:12] Moses, the one of the greatest
[1:35:14] sculptures ever done. And and you know,
[1:35:17] it's amazing about what's amazing about
[1:35:19] those sculptures is what those men could
[1:35:22] do with stone, cold, hard stone, and
[1:35:25] make it look lively and living, you
[1:35:27] know, so much and so accurate where they
[1:35:30] they portray the very veins and muscles
[1:35:32] exactly perfectly to where it looks like
[1:35:36] it's alive.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; because the image that Michelangelo had
[1:35:40] in his head was Moses.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. and he went down and found a block
[1:35:46] of stone and something that was dirty
[1:35:48] and buried in the earth and didn't look
[1:35:50] like anything. But yet in his mind, he
[1:35:53] saw Moses inside of that block of stone.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, what does he do with a
[1:35:59] life of a child of God? There's a seed
[1:36:01] in there. It looks like an old dirty
[1:36:03] block of stone. Amen. But he has an
[1:36:06] image in the back part of his mind for
[1:36:08] that one. Amen. And so what does he do?
[1:36:10] He begins chipping away. Yeah. Amen.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And he said uh he they said, "Well, how
[1:36:17] do you do that? How do you how do you
[1:36:18] create such a beautiful masterpiece out
[1:36:20] of a block of stone?" And he said, "I
[1:36:22] just remove everything that wasn't
[1:36:23] Moses,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; right? Everything that didn't match the
[1:36:28] image,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; right? Amen." And that's what the word
[1:36:32] of God is doing for you. Every time we
[1:36:34] come to church, every time you open your
[1:36:36] Bible, every time you get down to pray,
[1:36:38] every time you listen to a tape, Amen.
[1:36:41] God is working on your character. Amen.
[1:36:43] He's chipping away because he has an
[1:36:45] image. It's not random.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Praise his holy name.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's going through a process with
[1:36:52] you.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; And he's chipping away that which
[1:36:56] doesn't match what's written in the
[1:36:58] book.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Amen.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Lord.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; So, we can come in with our
[1:37:20] unbelief. We can come in cooled off or
[1:37:24] our minds going a million miles an hour.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But what will happen, brother, sister,
[1:37:30] is the word will go and seek out
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; that need.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:38] Amen. The word will find the need in
[1:37:42] your life
[1:37:43] and it will meet the need.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; The word comes looking for me.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; The word comes looking for me. When I
[1:37:55] need him, I don't even many times know
[1:37:57] what I need.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But he knows what I need and he comes
[1:38:00] finds me
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; and he seeks me out. The word finds me
[1:38:04] right where I am at and ministers to my
[1:38:06] need.
[1:38:09] If I need healing, it's the word that
[1:38:11] seeks me out and finds me
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; and heals me.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the seeking God is
[1:38:19] moving.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He brings conviction if it's
[1:38:23] needed. He brings reconciliation if it's
[1:38:25] needed.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; But it's always to bring us to that
[1:38:29] image.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful he tells me when I'm
[1:38:35] wrong.
[1:38:37] That's right.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I want to be right.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You can't be right unless you can accept
[1:38:45] that you are wrong.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And guess what? We're all wrong.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; So I can accept that this morning. Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; When it comes from him.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; So it's in that closeness that he wants
[1:38:59] to walk with us. And he wants to be your
[1:39:02] everything.
[1:39:04] Everything.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:39:06] Amen. He wants to protect you and care
[1:39:09] for you. He wants to give you everything
[1:39:12] that you have need of.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. Sometimes he allows
[1:39:17] situations in our lives to drive us
[1:39:19] back.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Into his arms. Amen. So that we'll lean
[1:39:24] on him.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; So that we'll allow him to be God.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; He can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:39:34] infirmities.
[1:39:35] Amen. I'm so thankful for that scripture
[1:39:38] because it describes such character in
[1:39:41] God. Amen. That we have a high priest
[1:39:43] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:39:46] our infirmities. Infirmities means our
[1:39:49] weakness. It's not just necessarily
[1:39:51] sickness. It's the weakness
[1:39:54] of our humanity. Amen. The feeling, not
[1:39:58] just the infirmity, but the feeling of
[1:40:00] our infirmities. what we're going
[1:40:02] through in our emotional realm. Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; All of it. He's interested in it and he
[1:40:09] can be touched by it. That means he can
[1:40:11] be moved by it. He can be put into
[1:40:14] action
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; by that. It he's a he's a feeling God.
[1:40:19] He's not a cold, distant,
[1:40:21] hard God. Amen. He's an everpresent help
[1:40:25] in time of trouble.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; He's tender toward his children and he
[1:40:30] loves them. He's looking for one to be
[1:40:33] strong on behalf of that one.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; He's looking for one that'll stand up
[1:40:38] and say, "I believe God's word." And he
[1:40:40] he'll he'll move for that one. Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord of hosts after all. Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He wants to be your champion.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:00] So remember what he's doing though. He's
[1:41:02] calling names off the book.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling names.
[1:41:09] It's like, you know, when he went and uh
[1:41:12] was walking around in the shores of
[1:41:14] Galilee and he sees a fisherman named
[1:41:17] Peter, Simon, right? Oh, there was lots
[1:41:20] of fishermen. There's probably a lot
[1:41:23] better fishermen. There are probably
[1:41:25] better character men.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Than Simon. Amen. There were fishermen
[1:41:31] before he was there and there were
[1:41:32] fishermen after he was there.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Many He looked just like all the rest of
[1:41:38] them.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; But the difference was his name was on
[1:41:43] the book.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; And Jesus going through the list. He's
[1:41:56] got a list of all his his his apost his
[1:41:59] disciples, right?
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Well, he's just going down through the
[1:42:02] list, each one.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He gets to Peter's name. Okay, we got to
[1:42:08] go find him. He's down here. He's down
[1:42:11] here by the shore. He's a fisherman.
[1:42:12] Let's go down and find him. And his
[1:42:14] brother Andrew and James and John,
[1:42:16] they're fishermen. Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And Peter had no idea what would become
[1:42:21] of his life.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't know that they'd have a
[1:42:25] basilica in Rome named after him.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That that there'd be a pope that claimed
[1:42:32] to be, you know, in his spiritual
[1:42:35] lineage.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; That that we'd be reading about him.
[1:42:39] We'd be calling his name thousands of
[1:42:41] years later,
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; just an ignorant fisherman.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Couldn't even write his own name.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; But yet, his name was in the book.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:42:53] Hallelujah.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus goes walking through the
[1:42:57] shores of Galilee. You Yeah, I'm talking
[1:42:59] to you,
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Matthew. Tax collector. Hey, come on.
[1:43:05] Follow me. Your name's here. You're
[1:43:06] next. Let's go.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, you. Oh, yeah. Here's this one.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:18] Amen. The Bible says that he had needs
[1:43:21] go by Samaria.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Well, he got to that name in the
[1:43:28] list.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Well, she's down in Samaria, so we'll
[1:43:34] have to take a little detour.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; But that's all right. We'll find this
[1:43:37] one, too.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what she looks like.
[1:43:42] There's something inside of her that can
[1:43:44] receive revelation. There's a seed in
[1:43:46] that woman that I placed there before
[1:43:48] the foundation of the world. And that's
[1:43:50] the next one off my list.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he redirected his whole
[1:43:54] ministry. We're we we got to go to the
[1:43:57] next name.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And he goes down there and begins to
[1:44:03] speak the word. And there's a little
[1:44:05] seed in there that began to vibrate.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And activate.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Something was happening. Amen. The word
[1:44:12] of God was coming her way.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And and it began to
[1:44:19] receive and to come to life
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; and something in her just said, "Believe
[1:44:24] that."
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Well, all the things that you've heard
[1:44:27] and believed and and and have been
[1:44:30] explained to you, whatever, believe
[1:44:32] that.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:44:37] She didn't go looking for him.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; He came looking for her
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; and he found her.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he called her with his word.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; What's the difference? Jesus presence
[1:44:56] made the difference.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; That seed laying dormant all that time.
[1:45:02] But in its time and in its season,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; his presence came on the scene.
[1:45:10] Amen. His life came on the scene and
[1:45:14] that made the change. That made the
[1:45:18] difference. Amen.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I think of Paul, Saul,
[1:45:22] the Pharisee.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; He had a plan for his life. Amen. Those
[1:45:28] Pharisees, they weren't they weren't uh
[1:45:30] haphazard about their schooling,
[1:45:33] right? They had goals
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; and they had, you know, they had a way
[1:45:38] of doing things and, you know, a way to
[1:45:40] rise up the ranks and they believed that
[1:45:43] that was how they served God. And that's
[1:45:45] what Saul was doing. He had letters, the
[1:45:49] sanction from the priests and the the
[1:45:51] the the high men of God in in that move.
[1:45:54] Amen. And and that was his way to
[1:45:57] advance.
[1:45:59] And that was his way to serve God
[1:46:01] better. And he believed it. He was
[1:46:03] zealous towards God
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and he had his life all figured out. He
[1:46:08] had dedicated himself from the time he
[1:46:11] was a little boy to studying the word of
[1:46:13] God. So zealous.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; But you know what? There were many boys
[1:46:18] like that.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; There were many like that. Many priests
[1:46:23] and and and going through that process.
[1:46:26] Many Pharisees and Sadducees that were
[1:46:28] sincere and dedicated their lives. I
[1:46:31] mean, just think about how brother
[1:46:33] Brandham talks about the kindly old
[1:46:35] priest, right? Sincere,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Paul was sincere, too. Saul was sincere
[1:46:42] just like all the rest of them. They
[1:46:44] were sincerely thought they were doing
[1:46:46] the will of God.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Paul's name was on the book.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His name was on the book.
[1:46:58] And there were different people being
[1:46:59] added to the kingdom as their names were
[1:47:02] being called off the book. Amen. And
[1:47:05] finally, it came down to Saul
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; of Tarsus.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; It's time for him.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Well, this one has a
[1:47:16] special call in his life, so he needs a
[1:47:18] little bit of something there." He he he
[1:47:21] went to him and knocked him down,
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; smacked him around a little bit, took
[1:47:26] his eyesight from him, humbled him, in
[1:47:29] other words,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Brought him brought him down and began
[1:47:34] to speak to him.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Why are you persecuting me, Saul? Who
[1:47:39] are you?
[1:47:42] I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
[1:47:45] It's hard for you to kick against the
[1:47:48] pricks.
[1:47:49] You know what a prick is? That's a ox
[1:47:51] go.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; That's how that's how somebody steers an
[1:47:56] ox, right? It's a steering wheel for an
[1:47:59] ox. Nope. Nope. Don't go over there.
[1:48:00] Over here. Okay, get moving. Right.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:07] Saul in his zeal was going his own way.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No, your name's on the
[1:48:14] book, so I'm going to just change your
[1:48:17] direction."
[1:48:18] Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; That plan, all those things that you
[1:48:21] thought that you were going to do with
[1:48:23] your life, you were going to go to
[1:48:25] college and you were going to get a good
[1:48:26] a good job and you were going to have a
[1:48:28] nice house and a car and this and that
[1:48:30] and I was going to live in this certain
[1:48:32] place or maybe I was going to be famous
[1:48:34] or do this thing or whatever.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; When your name is called,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're coming according to his
[1:48:42] word.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus went looking for him. and
[1:48:47] interrupted his plan.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Said, "No, Saul, you had a plan, but
[1:48:52] I've got a different plan for you."
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of that call. Why are you
[1:48:58] persecuting me, Saul? Just like Adam,
[1:49:00] where are you?
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Adam, where are you? Fallen, where are
[1:49:05] you? Saul, why are you persecuting me?
[1:49:08] Amen. And the call went out and there
[1:49:11] was something on the inside that said,
[1:49:14] "Who are you?"
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; The religious leaders excommunicated
[1:49:21] him, kicked him out.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he found out that his
[1:49:27] life was so much greater than he could
[1:49:29] have ever imagined.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Called to be the first church age
[1:49:32] messenger to write much of the New
[1:49:35] Testament. called to be a great powerful
[1:49:38] apostle and missionary to take the word
[1:49:41] of God to the Gentiles to take salvation
[1:49:44] to an entire race of people on the
[1:49:47] earth.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his name was on the book.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; The master craftsman began to work.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that. Aren't you?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to wrap this up this
[1:50:05] morning. We don't want to just keep
[1:50:07] going all day, brother Sean. Amen.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; But brother and sister, each individual
[1:50:14] is being called.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Each one has to hear their own name
[1:50:20] called.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; We've got to hear it ourselves.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And then he's fitting each one together
[1:50:29] into a body.
[1:50:31] and he's molding us and shaping us so
[1:50:35] that we'll fit together according to his
[1:50:38] word. But it takes us to surrender.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; There's nothing I have to do. Just say
[1:50:46] yes, Lord.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I accept and believe your word, Lord.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you have
[1:50:55] need of this morning. That's the only
[1:50:57] thing that you have to do, right? Isn't
[1:51:00] that the theme of this message? Only
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; believe.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, Lord. I accept it. Yes, Lord.
[1:51:08] Your name's on the book. I accept it,
[1:51:09] Lord.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; He's still calling. He's still seeking
[1:51:13] today.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He's still calling each and every name.
[1:51:19] Hallelujah.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; And the thing is, brother, sister, I
[1:51:24] can't tell you that your name's on the
[1:51:26] book.
[1:51:28] Amen.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; You've got to find out for yourself.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; And oh, brother Sean, you talk about a a
[1:51:35] mystery being revealed in this day. The
[1:51:38] mystery is who's on the book.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; And that mystery is unveiling
[1:51:47] in time. It's being revealed and
[1:51:50] unveiled. And when the last name is on
[1:51:53] the book is called, he said that's when
[1:51:56] Christ comes.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; That's when it that's when our time is
[1:52:01] ended.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; That work is finished.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. When that last one is called, but
[1:52:06] he's not going to come before the last
[1:52:07] one is called.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; So, brother, sister, if you have a
[1:52:12] desire in your heart, let's all stand
[1:52:13] this morning. If you have a desire in
[1:52:16] your heart, musicians have become
[1:52:18] anything in you wants to be closer to
[1:52:20] God, wants God, amen, wants to surrender
[1:52:24] more, wants to give more of your life to
[1:52:26] him, wants to be closer to him. Any any
[1:52:30] desire according to his word, it's
[1:52:33] because he put that desire there.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes,
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; that's one of the that's one of the most
[1:52:40] liberating things, brother, sister, that
[1:52:42] we have as believers.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could boldly make those
[1:52:48] statements where he says anyone who is
[1:52:51] thirsty
[1:52:53] or anyone who is hungry or anyone who
[1:52:56] knocks or anyone who seeks, he said if
[1:53:00] you seek you will find. If you knock it
[1:53:04] shall be open unto you. Why could he
[1:53:06] make that with such an assurityity?
[1:53:08] Well, it was Jesus. Well, yeah, of
[1:53:09] course. But the reason that he could do
[1:53:11] that is because he knows it's God doing
[1:53:14] the pulling on the other end. You can't
[1:53:17] seek unless he calls. You can't knock
[1:53:21] unless he put that desire in there.
[1:53:23] Brother Brandham expressed it like David
[1:53:25] as the deep calling to the deep. Amen.
[1:53:28] So, I want to encourage you this
[1:53:30] morning. If there's anything in you that
[1:53:32] wants to be closer to God, that wants
[1:53:34] desires something from God this morning,
[1:53:37] he put that desire there.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; And he didn't put that desire there to
[1:53:42] frustrate you.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; The heathens have these ideas about gods
[1:53:49] that that trick people and and and
[1:53:51] they're they're trying to deceive people
[1:53:55] and and and they play games with them
[1:53:57] and trick them. That's not our God.
[1:53:59] Amen.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; If he puts a desire in there, it's
[1:54:01] because it's his will to give it to you.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; now you got to make sure that's
[1:54:06] according to his word and not your
[1:54:08] desire.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I have a desire for a Corvette.
[1:54:12] No, hold on.
[1:54:15] Amen. It's got to be according to the
[1:54:17] word.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; It's any promise in this word.
[1:54:22] It belongs to you.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; If it's a true revelation, it will come
[1:54:31] to pass.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; So, he's still calling today. He's still
[1:54:35] seeking today. He's looking for those
[1:54:39] Amen. that would surrender to him.
[1:54:43] He didn't bring you this far to leave
[1:54:44] you.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; That ought to be a song, brother. Amen.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:55] He's going to accomplish what he set out
[1:54:57] to do
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; in each one. Do you believe that this
[1:55:00] morning? Amen. I'm so thankful he knows
[1:55:04] right where we're at this morning.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; He knew right where Zakayas was at. He
[1:55:09] was hiding out, but there was still a
[1:55:11] desire in his heart to see Jesus. When
[1:55:14] Jesus got to him, he looks up. What are
[1:55:16] you doing hiding up in that tree?
[1:55:19] You knew I'd passed by this way. And
[1:55:22] that desire that's in your heart, I put
[1:55:24] there. Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads this morning.
[1:55:29] Oh, Father, how thankful we are, Lord,
[1:55:32] for your word this morning.
[1:55:34] How grateful, Lord.
[1:55:39] Lord, that your word is sure
[1:55:43] and it's sharper than any two-edged
[1:55:45] sword,
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:48] discerning the
[1:55:51] very
[1:55:53] separation, Lord, between our flesh and
[1:55:56] our spirit and our soul.
[1:56:00] It's a firm foundation this morning.
[1:56:05] Lord, I thank you this morning as I as I
[1:56:08] just think back and reflect, oh God, I
[1:56:10] think back to that day, oh God,
[1:56:14] when you made it sure in my life
[1:56:18] that you called me, Lord, you called me
[1:56:21] by name. You came down, Lord, and you
[1:56:24] made yourself real to me. You filled me
[1:56:28] with your spirit, Lord, and I've never
[1:56:30] been the same since.
[1:56:33] And I know from that day I know that I
[1:56:36] know that I know
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; that my name is in that book.
[1:56:41] Lord, I want that for everybody. Lord,
[1:56:45] I pray Lord God that you would just
[1:56:47] bless your children this morning,
[1:56:49] knowing that each one has to get their
[1:56:51] own revelation directly from you. I pray
[1:56:54] that you'd help them. Father, if there's
[1:56:55] any that need healing this morning,
[1:56:58] Lord, may they just receive it
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; as a loved gift from you, Lord,
[1:57:05] purchased on Calvary.
[1:57:07] Lord, if there's any that need a touch
[1:57:09] in their emotions, Lord, in their
[1:57:11] spirit, I pray that you would touch
[1:57:13] them, Lord.
[1:57:16] May your spirit just rain down on your
[1:57:18] children this morning, oh God, with
[1:57:21] every good and perfect gift.
[1:57:25] Once again, Lord, I just thank you for
[1:57:26] this assembly, Father. I pray that you
[1:57:29] bless them, Lord. Just continue, Lord,
[1:57:32] to to use our brother Shawn as you lead
[1:57:35] him and lead them, Father.
[1:57:38] And Lord, we're looking forward to that
[1:57:39] day when we'll all be gathered together.
[1:57:43] That our trials will behind us then.
[1:57:46] You'll wipe every tear from our eyes.
[1:57:49] What a wonderful day, Lord, we're
[1:57:51] looking towards. And we believe you're
[1:57:52] coming soon, Lord. So, let us be up and
[1:57:55] doing while there is still time, Father.
[1:57:59] Work while it is day.
[1:58:02] We thank you, Father, and we ask these
[1:58:04] things in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:58:09] Hallelujah. Brother, sister, it's a
[1:58:11] personal revelation to you. Amen. That's
[1:58:15] what calling your name off the book is.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; It's when he comes to you and says,
[1:58:20] "You're my child."
[1:58:23] Amen.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; And like I said, I remember the day he
[1:58:27] did that for me.
[1:58:29] And he he came and he told me, not with
[1:58:32] an audible voice, but he spoke to me and
[1:58:34] he said, "You're my child.
[1:58:36] Amen. And I I believe your faith. You've
[1:58:39] confessed me all these years being a
[1:58:43] Christian, but now I confess you
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; and he gave me his token.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave me his Holy Spirit as a
[1:58:54] token
[1:58:55] that whenever I get in trouble, Amen.
[1:58:58] whenever I come up against a demon, I
[1:59:00] can just present that token.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:05] But he had to give it to me. Amen. No
[1:59:08] preacher gave it to me. No pastor gave
[1:59:11] it to me.
[1:59:12] Messenger didn't give it to me. He gave
[1:59:15] it to me.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Just like Ruth had to go directly to
[1:59:19] Boaz, get her revelation directly from
[1:59:22] him. There was nobody else around. She
[1:59:24] couldn't go through a third party. It
[1:59:25] had to be him speaking directly to her.
[1:59:29] And then she could say, "I know that I
[1:59:31] know that I know." Amen. Brother,
[1:59:34] sister, we are living in a dreadful age
[1:59:37] and we have to know that we know that we
[1:59:39] know
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; that our name is on the book.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, brother
[1:59:45] Sean.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, for saving
[1:59:58] my soul.
[2:00:02] Thank
[2:00:04] you Lord
[2:00:07] for making
[2:00:10] me whole.
[2:00:13] Oh, thank
[2:00:16] you Lord
[2:00:19] for giving
[2:00:22] to me.
[2:00:25] Oh, thy great salvation
[2:00:31] so rich.
[2:00:33] Well, are you thankful for grace? Oh,
[2:00:37] thank
[2:00:40] so glad that we're part of that book.
[2:00:45] He came looking for us. He found us.
[2:00:51] Oh yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:54] for making
[2:00:57] me whole.
[2:00:59] I want to thank
[2:01:03] you Lord
[2:01:05] for giving
[2:01:08] to me.
[2:01:11] Oh thy great salvation
[2:01:17] so full.
[2:01:20] And one more time I want to thank
[2:01:26] Hallelujah
[2:01:28] for saving
[2:01:31] my soul.
[2:01:35] Thank
[2:01:37] you Lord
[2:01:40] for making
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:45] I want to thank
[2:01:48] you Lord
[2:01:51] for giving
[2:01:54] to me
[2:01:58] thy great salvation
[2:02:03] so
[2:02:06] and free.
[2:02:11] Amen. I I shall forever um He looked
[2:02:15] beyond my faults.
[2:02:19] I shall forever
[2:02:25] lift
[2:02:26] my eyes to Calary
[2:02:30] [Music]
[2:02:34] to view the cross
[2:02:40] where Jesus
[2:02:42] died.
[2:02:46] He died for me.
[2:02:49] How marvelous
[2:02:55] the grace that caught my falling
[2:03:01] soul.
[2:03:04] He looked
[2:03:07] beyond
[2:03:10] my faults and saw. Aren't you glad for
[2:03:14] his grace?

[2:04:50] How marvelous
[2:04:52] [Music]
[2:04:56] the grace that caught my falling

[2:05:14] beyond.
[2:05:17] Thank God it.
[2:05:19] Oh, he looked
[2:05:22] beyond
[2:05:26] my fault
[2:05:28] and saw my need.

[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; and not keeping record of our faults.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; He's keeping record of his thoughts
[2:06:33] about us. And nothing can change that.
[2:06:36] No matter how scarred
[2:06:39] we may be, no matter all the complexes
[2:06:42] that Satan may put on us, no matter what
[2:06:46] what Satan has done in our past.
