only getting 40% blood flow and left leg is about 80 uh% uh blood flow and then kidneys uh about stage three failure and one of them is even worse than that uh so uh the surgery uh they um you know the blockages in her stomach and leg uh they're saying it's just too risky for surgery at this point and um so she's supposed to be getting a CAT scan on her neck uh there um what they say it's uh the left side is about uh 75 85% blocked and will have to have surgery and uh so we want to just keep her in our prayer you know um there's no problem too hard for God and we we know that uh I think we've all can witness that that there's just no problem too hard and we don't even have to go all the way to the Bible days and and bring Lazarus from the grave and talk about all that we can talk about what God has done in our day and for us and um we can truly say there's no no problem too hard for God and if there's ever a people that should uh have that faith is it's a uh people like us uh that

gathered here this afternoon father realizing to the world that it's just another day in the week it's just another evening father Lord many many years ago there was families that made time to come to your house and to Worship You Lord they look for every opportunity that they could receive to come into your presence but Lord as time has gone on and Lord the influence of Leonia has so gripped the lives of humanity Lord the house of God has Lord become less and less on the list of priorities but Lord I'm so thankful tonight to be gathered with a group of people Lord that they're not looking for excuses to miss your house but lord they're looking for every opportunity Lord to come in and wash your feet and do you a service Lord now father we're come tonight to speak your word and Lord knowing that your word will never fail and Lord knowing that if these Believers have come here tonight with needs and situations oh God lord we know you're still able to heal the sick Lord you're still able to save the Lost father you're still able to fill with the Holy Ghost in Fire Lord you're still able to give us Direction and Grace oh God now Lord as we've studied these things asking for your divine intervention Lord may you come now and move us aside Lord father by the preaching of your word May empty vessels be filled oh God Lord by the preaching of your word may sicknesses be turned into healing father Lord by the preaching of your word may bondages oh God be turned into Liberty father Lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for Lord we're not here to see what a man can do but we're here to see what you can do now father may you bless this assembly oh God may you rain showers of blessings upon him tonight we pray in Jesus Christ's mighty name we ask these things and all the Believers says amen amen and amen God bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the book of 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter the book of 1 Corinthians the 15th chapter and then we're also going to look in the book of St John the 14th chapter amen 1 Corinthians chapter 15 Amen in verse number one we do want to greet you all tonight in the name of the Lord we sure count it an honor privilege to be able to stand here tonight and speak to you amen from the word of the lord we just pray something will be said to be a blessing to to you in 1 Corinthians 15 and verse number one Paul here writing he says moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received somebody say received and wherein ye stand so whatever they received is where they're standing Now by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received there's that word received again how that Christ died for our sins now I want you to catch this according to the scriptures so the way that Christ died was according to the scripture and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures I love that because he's not doing anything outside of the scriptures he died according to the scripture he was born according to the scripture and he rose according to the scripture now in the book of St John the 14th chapter St John's gospel the 14th chapter and the 19th verse brother brandham reads this scripture and it is the rising of the Sun and he says now yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also brother BR said speaking to his wife because I live ye shall live also amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to uh by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight if I would if I would take a subject here tonight I want to talk to you for a few moments on the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer amen the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer of course I believe that as we are here tonight amen we're not following any uh religion or any God but rather we're following the Lord Jesus Christ amen then we are firmly established upon the foundation that Christianity is based upon resurrection and it's not based upon replacing you know sometimes we get in our mind amen that it would be easier for God Amen maybe just to replace us or maybe find somebody else but God Amen is not interested in replacing us but rather he is interested in restoring us and resurrecting us now uh from the message I am the resurrection and life brother I'm speaking here uh speaking of job and he says now I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand upon the Earth for after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God brother BR said now he seen the resurrection would be brought about by man someday and the sin question would be settled when that righteous one the Son of God came to die amen for Sinners see there was no man on Earth at that time or no man since that could ever Bridge the way between a holy God and a sinful man there was no man could ever bridge the gap between a holy God and a sinful man but job here 4,000 years before his coming amen he saw his death his burial and his resurrection amen and his justification that come by the resurrection he said and the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer now what a comfort it is to know amen that those things are true amen it's not a fiction story amen we are not following cly devis fables amen but whether we are following a Vindicated word of God Amen that has been Vindicated in the heavens it has been Vindicated on the earth and it has been Vindicated in the lives of the Believers now I'll say this the word of God is Not fiction how many can agree amen the word of God is Not fiction I believe amen that it's true and I believe that the results that it Bears amen actually proves that it is the truth brother R said now this is not fiction this is the Bible amen it's God's truth it's his promise I've tried it and tested it and I know you can take God's word and he will make it right with you amen you can take God's word and he will make it right with you amen he will bring it to pass amen I think it's amazing brother Sean has said it over and over that we're here amen preaching the promises of God Amen the promises are not coming from a seminary they're not coming from a denomination amen but rather the these promises are coming from God's word amen and they're not just man's promises but whether they're they're they're rather God's promises and their tried promises they're true promises amen and God always brings his promises to pass now we know by a prophet's teaching amen what the word absolute means how many how many's thankful for a prophet that preaches some sermons called an absolute he says now Webster says amen that it is perfect in itself it is Unlimited in its power it is primarily in all ultimacy amen it's Unlimited in its power amen it's perfect in itself and it really is an ultimate amen it's an absolute see it's Unlimited in its power amen it's perfect in itself and it really is an ultimate now amen some some people amen I think it's funny that we're this far down the road and some people are still trying to determine what the absolute is amen but let's just say what a prophet said he said the absolute is the word of God now I know some people think there's multiple absolutes but really there's only one absolute amen and to a Believer it's not what somebody thinks about the message amen or the way somebody preaches the message but the absolute to a Believer amen is the message of the hour he said see the word absolute is Ultimate therefore he said I think that everybody should have an ultimate see every great achievement that's ever been achieved amen there has been an absolute behind it no matter what it was it's had an absolute behind it every person in order to achieve something has to First have the absolute amen and that's the final wine back through this that back to the other amen till you come to the absolute or the amen amen or the ultimate so when you come to the absolute amen there's nothing to be added to it and there's nothing to be taken from it amen but it is the finality he said you've got something to tattoo Amen in other words It's the final time post to every achievement it's somewhere see it might wind through many different things till gives to that tpost but there's an amen to all of it amen there must be such a thing amen you cannot go on through life without having one amen you cannot go through life without having an absolute now amen we know what the word absolute means I also took time and looked up the word guarantee amen the word guarantee amen it is a formal promise or Assurance amen it is something that is typically in writing amen that is certain conditions will be fulfilled amen it is something that gives a certainty amen of an outcome so when you have a guarantee you have something in writing amen that will give you a certainty of an assurance of an outcome let me say the only absolute guarantee that I know of Amen is the revealed word of God that has been brought to us through a Vindicated Prophet listen I believe this message is written in the Bible but I believe that it is interpreted Amen on about 1,200 books and tapes listen amen we don't have to go find what a scripture means amen we have an absolute ultimate we have a we have a primarily an ultimate listen amen if you want to know how to baptize go hear what a prophet said if you want to know how to take communion go hear what a prophet said if you want to know how to have church and have order and all these different offices amen go hear what a prophet said listen we are not just another church amen on the side of the road following something amen we have received an absolute guarantee amen and it's not just any kind of guarantee amen it's a perfect guarantee amen it's a it's a it's a primarily an ultimate in itself now you all know the prophet of God did not replace the Bible amen but rather he interpreted the Bible and the Bible was wrote by inspiration Timothy says all scripture is given amen by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction amen for instruction in righteousness brother B comes along and says many of the prophets amen writing they did not know what they were writing amen but they just wrote it down amen imagine that you're just writing amen and all of a sudden you find yourself writing something and you don't even know what you're writing amen see because it was inspiration now I'm not one that just believes Moses had inspiration or Paul had inspiration or Jeremiah or Zechariah I believe William brandham had inspiration because in 1962 he is told amen pick up your pen amen and write and as he picked up his pen and begin to write what did he begin to write about he begin to write about a bride amen who would have the potentials of God and as she neared The Headstone amen she would be so much in His image amen that the same works the head did amen the body would do see they were writing amen prophecy amen of coming of the Messiah now in St John 5 and: 46 Jesus said amen for had you believe Moses amen you would have believ me he said now see for he wrote of me look at this word wrote amen it means to describe it means to write with reference to the form of the letters amen it means to Amen to put on paper or some other material it means to commit to writing things amen not to be forgotten it means to write down to record amen it is used to those things which stand amen written in the sacred books of the Old Testament so Jesus looks at him and he says now listen if you had believe Moses amen then you would believe me amen because he wrote Of Me In verse 47 he said but if you believe not his writings amen then how shall you believe my words amen so there was not something could happen amen different from what Moses wrote see they were trying to say well we believe Moses amen but you're different but if they really studied it amen they would see that what Moses wrote Amen in symbol form amen was now standing in front of them in reality form he said see think of it this baby born down there an illegitimate birth in an on in a cow stable amen how could that be this guy didn't go to any school he had no credentials he had no Fellowship card he didn't belong to any organization amen they know no school he went to how could this be anything amen see they failed to see because he said the works that I do amen they testify me amen search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they they that testify of me amen they tell you who I am see they are my testimony amen the scriptures said if you don't believe me then believe the works that I do they tell you who I am they said well we have Moses and we believe Moses and he said if you had believed Moses amen you would believe me because he wrote To Me In other words brother said they were so dark amen I want you to hear this they were so dark and still they couldn't see it amen wonder if that could read repat amen it's prophesied to you know it was prophesied you say when in this day amen so in this day when the word is made flesh again the same spirit that blinded them in the first amen will blind them today and they will say you're not what the Bible says you're supposed to be brother said but Jesus was all amen The Inspired prophets testimonies amen all their prophecy amen was brought to light in his age that had been prophesied for his age amen listen he lit up every candle amen of the word that was in the Bible Amen brother Terry every candle that was in the word amen Jesus was the fire amen that struck the wick on the candle and he become a burning reflection amen of what was wrote listen when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive amen Mary was the Virgin and he was the seed that the Virgin conceived oh my when he said there would be a prince of peace a counselor of Mighty God and Everlasting father he said the eyes of the blind shall see amen everything that was prophesied of him amen it happened when he came on Earth amen can I ask you how did it happen it happened by the word of God that's why Jesus said heavens and earth amen shall pass away amen but my word it shall never pass away brother B said God's word is so real how many believer God's word is so real he said that's enough scripture right there Amen to take all communism out of the world and convert the entire world see it is an invitation Amen to Salvation it's also an invitation to Healing it is the guarantee of eternal life amen the word of God is an invitation to Salvation it's also an invitation to Healing amen but don't just stop at Salvation and don't just stop at healing amen but the same word that's an invitation is also guarantee to eternal life he says oh it means so much amen if it be received Amen in the light that it's wrote in listen if the same light amen that wrote the Bible will return to the church there will be more than just a head knowledge there will be more than just an intellectual conception but there

taught you ye shall abide in him listen if you receive this absolute guarantee of Resurrection in your soul amen it brings an anointing and listen that anointing is an anointing that will destroy the Yoke of the enemy I love what the part of God says in the first seal he said we are thankful to be alive and to have this great revelation of eternal life dwelling within us think about that he said those great Hidden Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the lamb is the only one that can reveal it to us I pray that he will come among us tonight and will take a hold of his word and will reveal it to us that we might know how to be better servants Amen to him in this end time then listen the Bible amen is a absolute guarantee I I believe it is full of promises amen that are guarantees to the believer now tonight I just want to say this amen there's one I'm very thankful for amen and that is the promise of light I am very thankful amen for the promise of light according to Zechariah 14 and verse 6 he said it shall come to pass in that day amen that the light shall not be clear nor dark amen but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord amen not day nor night but it shall come to pass brother Bob that at evening time it shall be light amen at evening time it shall be light now you thank God for a word Prophet because he took Zechariah 14 and

eyes Amen to the events that's taking place today amen that's proved by the prophecies that we are at the end time listen so when you see things beginning to happen amen that ain't for time to look down that ain't for time to look back that's the time to look at the prophecy and say it was Prophecy in the 30s it was Prophecy in the 50s it was Prophecy in the 60s but today hey there is a bride who has the revelation of the opening of Seven Seals in the depths of her soul and she can stand there and say hey before they put a woman in office we knew it was going to happen before driverless car showed up on the streets of California we knew it was going to happen hey before anything ever happened into the Earth there was a prophet who stood by the inspiration of the word of God and prophesied of these things listen we ain't stumbling through politics we know what's going to happen come on we ought we ought to kick off this old this old dragging spirit amen and say well amen I hope the Republicans get it amen if the Republicans get it praise God and if the Democrats get it praise God it don't make no difference to a Believer she's not walking in the light of mpnc she's not not walking in Fox newsl she is walking in the evening time and in the evening time it shall be light when you see these things begin to come to pass lift up your heads your Redemption is drawing now somebody say thank God thank God he promised light he promised light in the end time now you know what kind of light he promised he promised evening light now Isaiah chapter 60 and verse one I love the scripture it says arise and shine amen don't sit and sleep arise and shine don't get discouraged arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is Arisen upon me for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee I want you to catch this amen there's a Darkness on the the Earth as well as a Darkness on the people and the Darkness on the earth is lesser amen than the darkness that's on the people he said now good morning from Shalom he says now good morning it means peace amen see the darkness is gathering amen what it gathering for to show the light so the reason the darkness is gathering amen is to show the light he said that's the reason I can say Amen Shalom amen listen amen it sounds pretty silly don't it amen but we got a bunch of Amen oh I'm going get in trouble amen we got a bunch of Knuckleheads amen trying to run this country I think it was darl Ward

church amen do you see the age we're living in amen men have become spinless and women have become leaders and that is not so from the beginning but in the end time there shall be a great light of shine upon the Gentiles but it won't be for everybody it'll only be for the elected woman to the elected lady who God chose before the foundation of the world listen if it wasn't for this L we would be in Chicago this weekend we would have been in in wherever they had the RNC a few weeks ago amen but because of this light we're not running from campaign to campaign we're not running from place to place but we're in God's provided place of worship we are sealed underneath a revelation do what you want to to the body but there's a soul that is already been sealed it has been stamped with an absolute guarantee of eternal life yes sir and the Gentiles now watch the Gentiles shall come to thy light so notice it ain't going to be you going to the light but the light's going to be so powerful it's going to draw you to itself brother said Rise and Shine the Light has come see the word light is Vindicated again amen the light Vindicated again is God's word so that you can see God manifested in his promise of the light of the day or the word given to this age see these promises that's made for this day these prophecies that was said by the prophets and by Jesus himself in this day so in this day Hebrews 1 will become fulfilled that God in Sundry times and divers man respect to the fathers through the prophets but in this last day amen has spoke through his son Jesus Christ because Jesus would come along and say I am the light of the world he that followeth me amen shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life brother said today we really truly have the light of life there's no doubt in my mind today as a gospel preacher of Christianity I have no doubt at all in my mind not one Shadow of Doubt but we POS have the sealed truth other religions may be all right amen but we have the truth so now we see there's a distinction Amen in religion and truth you can have religion amen and not have the truth but if you have the truth then you'll have Jesus and if you have Jesus you'll have everything you need see when the light of life is shining what you're doing to bring that seed amen what could it do up on a rock it'll do nothing what could it do up on dead substance it's not s for dead substance The Sun Shines for a seed that's gerti to life and this Bible and his word in the hour that we live is shining upon those to catch the eternal life listen friends you didn't receive eternal life you were born with eternal life but there had to come a quickening power of the Glorious Gospel Light of the Resurrection Amen to catch the eternal life people well glory to God those who are destinated to see it and it won't do one bit of good upon the rest of them there's no life in there to come forth by the Sun or by the light now brother said it very plain he said without light amen nothing can live without light think about that without light nothing can live now I love Matthew 4:16 it said the people which s in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death amen light is sprung up can I say to you that was more than just a verse that was a prophecy from Isaiah 9 and verse two where he said the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they and I listen they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death but upon them oh God upon them the light has shined so there's a people who's dwelling in the land underneath the influence of the shadow of death but there's a people in the middle of that land who the seed was in their soul from before the foundation of the world and when the light come it went directly to the seed and now there's confusion on America but there's glory on the bride there's confusion upon Lea but there's power upon the Church of the Living God what are you talking about preacher I'm saying church of living God we ought to shout our shoe heels off we are in a land full of of Darkness but there is a light that has come to the Gentiles it's a glorious light it's the evening light hallelujah hallelujah upon the Earth upon the land that the sea dwells in is the shadow of death but upon them oh come on Israel upon them light has shined yes sir light to those who sat in the regions of the Shadows of death amen Matthew 4 bring light to the Gentiles are you ready for this bring light to the Gentiles who were possessed and condemned by God in their Idols Gentiles were possessed and were condemned by God with her Idols but he come as a lot oh God what did he say Thy word is a light unto my path a light to lighten the path to my feet to guide me and today the light of God is the word of God made manifest listen friends the light of God is the word of God made manifest thy light is the works of God Amen spoken by the word of God brought to life listen and it's a greater light than it was at the dawn of Creation Church of the Living God brother brother Amos we are under the influence of a light amen it's the same light that was at the dawn of creation but there's a greater influence of that lot today than there was at the dawn of creation at the dawn of creation amen Malachi 4 had not been fulfilled Luke 17:30 had not been fulfilled Revelations 5 had not been fulfilled John 14:1 15:16 had not been fulfilled but today we can look at the word and say this day is the scripture fulfilled listen friends you're not walking underneath a denominational flashlight you are walking underneath Messiah light it's the king light it's the True Light it's the greatest light that's ever struck amen the face of the earth oh well glory to God when the dawn of creation come now brother automatically takes that to Psalms 23 and he says now they say y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they come for me B says now the law having a shadow many times you've heard people refer to 23rd psalm saying yay though I walk through the Dark Shadows or the Valley of the dark he said we always use a dark in there but it's not see the Valley of the Shadow not the Dark Shadows or the dark Valley it's the Valley of the shadow of death amen now showing that it's got a shadow there now listen if it has a shadow it has to have a certain percent of light well glory to God brother Kevin it has to have a certain percent of light or it wouldn't make a sadow in other words it's a scarecrow to the believer trying to scare him when there's enough light mixed into it to show that there's light somewhere he said now the law having a shadow of things to come I love what he says here he says so you see amen death itself is under the law my goodness amen death is not under grace amen it's under the law and there is a man here who can turn on the light he said there is a man present now amen let me ask you this how does God turn on the light according to a prophet he turns the light on by fulfilling his word so when his word becomes fulfilled he equivalents that Amen to a man walking in a dark room and turning on a light switch he said now see there's a man present don't get scared no matter what they say I've seen it come to spot where I didn't know where to move next have you ever been there you don't know what to do Under Pressure amen what do I do maybe the doctor gives a report am mean you've been there before see but now watch but he's always present the never failing presence he's always there he can turn on the light yes sir he's just waiting see what you're going to do amen he can flip the switch at any time he wants to listen he says there is a man here that can turn on the light those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death amen some of them under cancer under death of denomination under Creed death under traditional death all them kinds of death but they seen a great light listen they seen a great light he said the man that flashed the lights then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light the same God Amen yesterday today and forever he is present today he's right here now amen don't get scared he can turn on the lights well glory to God somebody give me some shouting room there is no place in the house of God for fear there is a man here who can turn on the light I don't care what shadow you're under I don't care what pressure you're under I don't care how much the devil's piled upon you there is a man here he said l i will be with you always be with you always even unto the end of the world when the persecution comes don't get scared there is a lot that he said would catch his people away she'll not go through the tribulation she'll never do it she will be called away how they going to do it brother Brandon it looks awful dark no matter how dark it gets sister Jane no matter how dark it gets he said you can't see your hand before you just remember there is a man here that can turn on the light what are you saying preacher I'm saying it's getting awful dark ain't it the Shadows are gathering pressures are coming economies are shaking Israel's at War Russia's hollering there's all kinds of Shadows Gathering but listen there's a man here there's a man here who can turn on the light he'll Rapture the church yes sir Sandra me a minute ago was right up to the fiery furnace but there's a man there who could turn turn on the air oh God Amen so not only can he turn on the light brother Timmy can turn on the air listen he ain't going to let it get too dark on you and he ain't going to let it get too hot on you he's able to change amen the conditions around you listen we've had some dark days amen we've had some pressurized days amen but can I say this to you it don't matter how dark it gets there's a man here in Faith Tabernacle who can turn on the light it don't matter how hot amen The Winds of judgment begins to blow there's still a fourth man who can step in the fire and he can fan the Flames come on and when Shadrach meach and was in the fiery furnace amen what were they discussing they were discussing their future come on somebody they were discussing their future in other words right in the middle of what looked like was their end the fourth man come down and said there's a future after the fire you've been there brother Amos amen it looks like it's the end it looks like it's over hey but then there's a man who can step in the scene there's a man who can turn on the lights there's a God who can change the circumstances no matter how dark it gets there's one here see may you realize tonight he says people that you're standing in his divine presence the Majesty of the king of Heaven the Lord Jesus Christ it's not your brother it's his presence church that ought to make you sh out it ain't your brother it's his presence as though always people love Darkness more that they love light now John 3:16 for God so L the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son in the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already see because not beli in the name of the only begotten Son of God now watch verse 19 and this is this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men loved Darkness rather than light see because their deeds were evil look at this word condemnation it's a separating it's a sundering it's a separation it's a trial or a contest now see when light comes amen light brings Darkness to a trial when light comes it brings Darkness to a contest brother said what is a contest he said it's to prove who has more strength amen does the one on this side of that side of the of the of the Rope have more strength he said well here it is but everyone that doeth evil hateth a lie neither cometh to the LIE lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in God he said so when the word of God Rises all Superstition denominational fanaticism things amen is spread away and it shows just exactly what it is he said see the word of God made manifest always somebody say always it always separates amen the light from the darkness now people can rise up with this or the other communism F fascism all these other isms can rise superstitions Cults whatever it might be might rise but when that King light of the Bible raises up all superstitions until it's a Vindicated proves his life we have no right to argue against that because it shuts all other light out Jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mind me the truth see his word amen his word is superior over all over all anything his word is light can I can I make an announcement to you tonight amen light has come we're not looking for light amen light has come he said I'm going to pray for you and ask while you're anointed now that the angel of the Lord right by your side amen don't sit in darkness no more listen we don't have to sit in darkness another second we don't have to sit underneath the influence of the shadow of death another second see the light has come the great conqueror is here okay the light has come the great conqueror is here amen then tell me what is this evening light he said in the evening time that we're now living where Christ through his ministers has preached the gospel for 2,000 years but this is the evening lights he said the evening lights was the manifestation amen of the Resurrection the evening light amen was the manifestation of the Resurrection see when they didn't know he had raised from the dead although they loved him they believed him but they didn't know he had raised from the dead they argued against him but now here it is in the evening time he's going to reveal himself amen that he is raised from the dead how did he do it not by preaching the word he's already did that and still they didn't believe and 2,000 years of preaching the word the church still don't believe but the evening light has come the manifestation of the resurrection and he taken them in he performed a miracle or did a thing just like he did before his crucifixion they knew it was him and their eyes come open he opened the eyes of the true believers by the manifestation of his resurrection listen amen he walked with them for six hours and preached them a gospel sermon beginning at Genesis all the way to the present day and it still did not open their eyes hey but in the evening time when they constrained him to come in he went into a little room and he took the bread and when he took the bread he broke the bread brother Terry he broke the bread and by the breaking of the bread was the opening of their eyes brother said what is the bread that's being broke today it is the complete Revelation it is the full revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he said see and then he vanished quickly now let me ask you this what does the lot come to do he said the evening lights are here Christ revealing his own word but what does it do to have light if you don't have any eyes to see how to get around in it so you got light but now there's got to come eyes he said now what is even life he said the light comes on to reveal something is that right if there's something here and you feel and you can't understand what it is in the darkness then turn on the light somebody shout back at me turn on the light turn on the light are you hearing me turn on a tape is that okay yeah turn on a book it's light are you hearing me you feel it's there but you can't understand it amen see what Malachi for to do do the same thing what the Seven Seals to do when all these denominations staging around this is to reveal to bring out if you haven't got any eyes then what's the use to reveal see there has to be eyes first to see is that right then what's the light going to do it's going to reveal Malachi 4 it's going to reveal Luke 17:30 it's going to reveal John 14:12 it's going to reveal John 15:24 it's it's going to reveal John 16:13 and to also reveal Revelation 10 1-7 amen the open of the Seven Seals the seventh Angel's message to open up to reveal when the evening light has come can I say this we are reading the word in light amen we are reading it in the same light it was wrote in are you hearing me in other words Exodus 13:21 the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them by the way and by night in a pillar of fire Amen to give them life to go by day and night now watch he took not away amen the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by Night amen from before the people listen we have today a pillar of cloud which is revelation 101 amen and we have a pillar of fire which is Exodus 13 which is hanging over a prophet's head now I'm just going to go ahead and say it since I'm this close to it amen somebody said the other day said well brother Andrew he's just pointing all the people to a cloud I thought well you know you probably meant that as an insult but to me that's a compliment amen because I'm not ignorant of what a prophet taught a prophet said that's our Lord up there amen so if you accuse me a pointing somebody to a cloud amen thank you brother sister I'm pointing them to the present day reality of who Jesus Christ is amen our God is not an idol because I'm not a dumb Gentile who is condemned by idols and condemned by Traditions but in that those who sat in the regions of the Shadows of death a light has come listen we were under the shadow of denomination and we couldn't believe in the right way of God we was under the shadow of denomination and we couldn't believe in the right way of Divine Healing but brother Terry God who is rich in Mercy hey he sent a light into the midst of the generation listen and we're no longer under Shadows that's right somebody say well that's a lot well brother B said it is a lot he said and God is a lot we know that Pillar of Fire see the disciples just wrote what they seen him do but Moses had the revelation so he went down into Egypt for 3 years and studied and seen that God of the Old Testament was the Jesus of the new see what did he get he got the Revelation and he come back and said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision think of it that same Pillar of Fire that came upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today interpreting the Bible amen GL how we think him for that what a comfort what an identification I'm so glad to be identified in that I don't know what to do I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran and all the rest of them see identified in that word with the Shak glory and Revelation lays the Shak glory and Revelation is in the word so the pillar of fire appear invisibly Among Us is identifying the messages right like he did at Mount SII he said notice the same Pillar of Fire that sent to Moses to Paul that wrote the Bible is now sent to reveal it it's the grace of God it's the unchanging God fulfilling the promises of Matthew 28 Lord I'm with you always fulfill in John 14:12 the works I do you do also fulfill in Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man will be revealed see Malachi 4 that same light has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he made for this day hey it's the manifested light for the day somebody say well why aren't you focusing Amen on justification that was the light of Luther's day amen why are you not focusing on sanctification that was the light of Wes's Day come on we might as well preach and why are we not going back to the restoration of the gifts because that was Pentecost day but this is brid light it's bride day it's bride time it's Malachi for revealing time it's Luke 1730 revealing time see what it is there is that same Pillar of Fire that same light among us bringing forth the life that when it was in Christ Jesus doing the same thing in the bride church today amen so the same thing the light did in him is doing in her he said now see will you believe it amen will you receive it will you acknowledge it will you accept it will you judge it as being from God listen because this light is your right out of here come on Church lot coming to you is an Evidence it's time to go home remember thir The Statue liberty he said them most sparrows laying out there he said I asked the GU I said why why are they laying here dead he said well sir the light was on the Statue of Liberty and then little old birds they got caught out there in the storm and darkness and instead of trying to use the light to fly to safety they flew against it trying to beat it out now the very same light that caused them to Die My could cause them to live if they would have used it right now don't get mad at me but it is equivalent to me of a bird using the light to fly to I'm going get in trouble but what's new okay it's equivalent to me that somebody say well you know I think we ought to take time and study brother bram's just a man and prove that well we're not ignorant we're not ignorant we know he was a man so what happens is is guys gets to studying on trying to make sure everybody knows brother R's a man and rather than using the light to ride themselves into a Revival they used the lot to prove that brother Brandon was a man and he made mistakes and he was human and he told liot amen but listen what a prophet said he said they were laying there because their brains just beat out trying to beat the light out accept the light and say thank you and let it leave them they tried to beat it out they should have just said thank you for what a prophet said and believed it and walked in it but they spent years trying to prove that it was a man that was saying what was being said let me say it as plain as I know how I am not an ignorant person I know brother Brandon was a human but you're looking at one preacher that will never lay down the sword and say this message is not an absolute it's not a perfect and oh God it's an ultimate to the Salvation it's primarily an ultimate it's above feelings it's above Traditions it's above educated guesses it's above reformers it's above preachers it's above commentators it's above everything it's the light of the Gentiles that has come to carry us out of the land of death yes sir infidels will rise Creeds will rise people say the Bible's not right he said oh God don't let me beat against your light let me accept it in my heart heart and say it's right Lord that's right I'll walk in the light he said now listen them Birds could have taken that light and searched it right around as it was moving up there and went right on nice and Cove under some houses somewhere in a shelter and had been protected from the storm now watch that light was coming to them to protect them from a storm brother turns and says in the great storm of formality come on Church the great storm of indifference and a great storm of denial of God three storms he says are coming in the end time a great storm of formality okay so what happens is people get a little reserved and they they lay off for the moving of God they lay off the spirit of God and so what people start doing is they start fighting the light by saying well you a bunch of dead churches and and then you need to move of God you need the amen no just preach the message he said see because God don't let me try to beat the light out let use it to walk in it see I believe it Lord there you are amen walk in the light as I see it in the scripture that's light it's God's word so let me walk in it Lord let me walk in it never never try to deny it that's right now let me say this before you can walk in the light you got to step in the light and brother said in the light of that angel of God stand there on the mountain that day everything that Moses once had or thought he never would happen it come to be a reality he said I think if men and women today would ever step in the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything that God has promised will illuminate to you and will be real Again Church of the Living God when the reason Moses fell in the first place here's what was the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush had that's right and what our failure today is amen is lack having what the Holy Spirit has the Holy Spirit has all good things for us if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible not only possible but promised to us Jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll do it if he abide in me in my words and you ask what you will it'll be given to you see when we step into the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it brother The Impossible becomes little things then oh church amen Moses under education seen no way to go to Egypt and deliver God's children but once step in the burning bush and everything he ever thought he would be it become a reality to him again come on some of y'all amen have let the devil bury what God said you could be you've let him bury the fact you can be an overcomer you've let him bury the fact you can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with you but I say tonight unto you that sit under the shadows of the condemnation of the devil I say arise and shine thy light has come it's a glorious light it's a power ful life it's a messiah life and if you'll step out of that Creed light and step out of that shadow of death and step over underneath the spout where the Shak glory and the Revelation comes out every promise of God will become as real to you as it did to brother brandom yes sir One Step In The Light God's word see then when God's word is Promised becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel of the Lord Stop Moses now and I say this to you once you stepped in the light put your walking shoes on and just walk on in the light Bible says if 1 John 1:7 if we walk in the light if we walk in the light if we sit in the light if we talk about the light on if we scrutinize the light if we put the light on trial if we walk in light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin look at this word walk it means to make one's way it means to progress I love this one to make due use of opportunities so if we progress in the light as he is in the light then we make use of the opportunities that are given by the life look at this word opportunity it is a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something it is a chance for success or advancement occurs can I just say this few things to you in closing we are not going backwards we refuse to go backwards sister Ranna and neither are we retreating we are advancing brother B said in spite of dungeons or swords or storms God's Great Church marches upward and we're so happy to be a member of that blessed body looking shortly for the coming of our blessed Lord who will receive us up into his kingdom into his presence there we will ever be with him oh the Glorious thoughts and the joy that sweeps through our soul when we look upon these promises and the Holy Spirit bearing us record that they are true come on Church how many sisters have I got here tonight that knows what it means to sweep amen you you get get the broom amen amen you start sweeping out amen listen what you're doing is you're getting rid of dirt you're getting rid of stuff that don't belong there are you hearing me listen you're making way you're making room you're preparing something listen friends the Holy Ghost hey is the broom of God and when it comes in the soul of a Believer listen it begins to brush out all the negativity it begins to brush out all the condemnation it begins to brush out all the indifference it begins to brush out all the formality listen God's Church moves is onward and upward we're not going backwards we're not going backwards we are living in the advancement of the Gospel that's right you say what is that the thing today the church again don't want to mature the church grain don't want to mature it wants to stay like it was back in Moody's time or sanki or finny or Knox or Calvin they they were all all right they were the light of the hour but this is another hour this is another day brother Sean this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we can't live in what Luther said we can't live in what Wesley said or some of the rest of them we're living in the light that's predicted for this day we're in the seventh Church age not the third or fourth Church Age The Grain should be able to receive it if it does and it falls off and means nothing to it see the grain is matured with the light if it goes ahead with the light listen light can be here but if you will not surrender yourself to the light you will stay where you are but if you can be a seed and you can surrender yourself to the influence of the light you will begin to advance amen from one glory to another brother Tim from One Faith to another from one Victory to listen church we are not going backwards and we are not going down are going forward this is the change of our bodies this is the light that will take us out of this Earth listen there's Darkness on the White House there's Darkness on the schoolhouse there's Darkness on the church house but there ain't Darkness on this bride because she's the graen and she's advancing the time is now to wake out of sleep put on the armor of light and redeem redeem the time what does that redeem the time mean it means to buy up each and every opportunity look at this word time it is the Supreme moment it's the golden opportunity in other words Paul is saying redeem our Supreme moment the Lord our golden opportunity in the presence of God himself praise the Lord amen right here tonight a great light has arisen amen yes every sinner that's in here he says perhaps there' be one you've been saved since Jesus died but don't you never die here where your opportunity was placed before you to go into his presence then to try to accept it it's made for now Lord right now you must accept it amen can I say this message was made to be preached now these quotes were made to be red now these these these golden nuggets were made to be polished and put out before the church now amen see Christian what an opportunity we have we have opportunities Paul never dreamed of having Enoch Elijah all them never had the opportunities we have now you love him tonight he said the sayith I have heard the in a Time accepted in the day of salvation have I secured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation listen to The Prophet this is our visitation time amen let's remember Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever do not wait till some region Yonder in the Damned in that Dimension where you cannot go in the presence of God your time is up on Earth in the nightmare of horror you'll remember you had your opportunity and turned it away let the young people take notice to this let's all it's more than a church service friends it's more than a youth camp it's more than a special meeting it's more than a it's more than a tent meeting once a year and a convention it's more than just traveling to meetings it's opportunities amen it's opportunities let our musicians come tonight God gave the Seed of Abraham an absolute guarantee listen they will possess the gates of their enemies sure why he promised it and what he promised is he does he cannot fail in this promise what is it his ever living presence with us to let you know he has taken the gate for you he was the royal seed no one could take those Gates but him all those back there were Shadows of his coming but when he come it finished the whole fight the fight was finished at Gethsemane and at Calvary and now we just stand as conquer see there's no fighting to do the fight's over we just Own It abstract deed to it a written guarantee by God our Father who raised his hand and said I'll swear by myself that his seed shall possess the Gate of the enemy and there it is it's already took he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed it's all done it's a finished work [Music] believe it's a finished work we just possess it the works that I do shall you do also the king is with us this morning his great blessings the Holy Spirit moving over us to feel that glorious feeling to know that it's exactly in line with the word of God it gives us such a wonderful consolation to know that God is our father oh brother can I read you one more it's an examination time it's an opportunity time it's the opportunity to accept this tell me something to take its place tell me something better than that produce anything in the world be the king of the earth rule of the universe be a crucial or a Kennedy or whatever you wish to be you'll die just the same you don't know what time it'll come any minute but here when death does strike you got eternal life and can't die with a guarantee by the God of all creation who possessor of heavens and earth I'll raise him up again at the last day how many can raise your hands and say I'm a part of that absolute guarantee I'm a part of that this is my hour This Is My Season won't you stand to your feet with us tonight you say brother brandom you're sure taking us out on a limb is there anything that's certain he said oh I could stand here and read off a list of things that's uncertain n is uncertain uncertain sound who knows what to do jobs politics is uncertain church is uncertain home life is uncertain what is certain is there anything that's certain yes there's one thing I'll guarantee you is certain that's the word of God my my my because of that absolute guarantee even death brother Sean even death has lost its certainty brother said the other day they said Death is certain I said no sir death isn't certain no indeed there might be a Rapture he said then there's no death death ain't too certain no no not in this day it was many years ago but not now death is not too certain what are you saying brother Andrew how many wants to step in the light tonight how many wants that light to just come right to where you [Music] are just step over let the promises become real again I got some cloes on it I didn't get to maybe we can share them with you later brother B said like this he said sometimes that devil don't want to move but in the turn on the light 64 he said but the forcing hour has come the forcing hour has come what is the forcing hour it's the hour when light is forcing Darkness together it's the hour when the light of the Glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ is forcing things brother sister you see tonight natural force put is National Force put Israel in the Homeland National Force will put the churches in the Royal Council of churches he said but the power of God will raise will Resurrect The Believer amen and put the bride in the Rapture listen and friends I don't know what you're going through tonight I don't know what you're facing but I just want to tell you this you have an absolute guarantee in his promise in his presence his promise it becomes enlightened it becomes reality again I wonder tonight how many can say Lord I don't want to just step in the light tonight I want to step in it for just a second and let it revolutionize me Let It illuminate the promises again but I want to start walking in it somebody say preacher how do you walk in the light you feed on them tapes every day don't get mad at me when's the last time you turned on the [Music] light sister Jane said today when's the last time you sit down in darkness y'all know what I'm talking about Darkness gets around you and pressures get around you in all kinds of situations you just sit down and flip a light on just to I don't think I've I've I had to been home to speak to you since I was out in California a few months ago was out there preaching some meetings and on on one of those days I think it was Monday brother amamos we went down to the four square uh gospel a Pentecostal Four Square movement there we went down there and toured Amy simple mcferson uh her whole uh compound or I shouldn't use that word I'm sorry that's on the internet uh building Church she built we went down there and toured it and brother brother Terry is probably one of the highlights of my life is I stood in the Los Angeles Temple and there a guy and you you look at it today and how far it's gone I mean I mean just homosexuality perversion I mean just just just filth invaded that invaded that whole area but I stood there in in the ansas temple and I just put on my earbud and I turned on looking at the Unseen and I heard brother bradam and he said this he said it's me I'm the Lord come down it's not brother brandom he has nothing to do with this I'm using his voice he so surrendered himself to me it's me it's the Lord will you come down go listen to it when you get home look at the scene 59 listen friends I'm standing in the exact place that a prophet stood and the Lord and I'm standing there and brother Sean I'm looking around and I see these balconies they're all big and it's all up there and in my head I'm saying nearly 50 60 years ago a prophet stood right here right lck come right in this building listen and it pushed against the darkness do you know what this message is it's a message of Resurrection wherever you put this message if there's a seed there it'll raise it up I got to looking and doing some research on why brother Bill they even brought brother brandom to the Angeles Temple I thought he went there under Amy simple McPherson's invitation she was dead and gone when brother Brandon went there he went there under her son Ral McPherson's invitation and you know what he said I I read some history on it they said our last hope to bring the healing Revival back was to invite William brandham I thought my goodness and some revived they went a little bit further with a Revival of healing but there was a bride who didn't just want the first sign of the second pool she wanted the third pool she wanted the bread she wanted her eyes to come open she wanted to see more than just the gift or more than just a feeling brother she wanted to walk with an absolute guarantee in her soul I'm coming out of this age brother Sean been preach on coming out of Babylon we're coming out of

comfort holds me amen did you enjoy that this evening amen thank God for the light and to walk in that light amen the light of this age not a glare but the light amen and um you know I was thinking of um thing that was sent um it was saying that they had discovered 2,000 year old seeds in 1963 inside an ancient jar in Israel and they were planted in 205 and a tree that had been extinct for over 1,800 years sprouted hallu and you know I I thought of that if that natural seed all it needed was light because it's under that law that of God let every seed bring forth of its own kind it just had to fall right under that that atmosphere and no matter how long it took but once it got in that right atmosphere under that light amen it it it sprung forward and I thought you know our names have been written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and but yet it was just waiting for the right light to come and and I'm so glad that that light has come it's brought a quickening power amen and here we are today aren't you glad for that and I thought of that brother brandom said there's a true church there's a church that's waiting for the coming of the Lord God always grant grant it but just those who are ordained you say what good will it do to stand if it's this kind of a system well there's a predestinated seed and when that light strikes they'll catch it like that she'll Bloom they'll Bloom right now sure others will just go right over the top of it they believe in their system and that's just the way it's always like it was in the days of Noah they believe the same thing those who were predestinated to eternal life they got it and no man can come to me said Jesus except my father draws him and all that the father hath given me see we just got to scatter the seed throw the light and each one of you ought to be a lighthouse can you say Amen you love love the Lord isn't he wonderful amen so may we just keep walking in the light don't let Darkness consume you don't let the darkness of this world and don't get wrapped up in politics I implore you don't don't don't get wrapped up in politics you say well that's my American right but what about your Christian right don't get wrapped up in that that's all Darkness they cannot bring light to you they can't get get you out of anything walk in the light as he is in the light we're going home church and the only thing that's taken us home is this glorious light the evening light that has come aren't you glad for that amen I I love the Lord amen let's just sing this song as we get
