today uh sounded pretty good amen and good to have brother Amos and sister Lisa back with us I trust you all had a good time there and and praise the Lord and she's gone but it's my wife's birthday today and uh anyways she's uh she's special that's for sure and certainly appreciate her very much amen if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter amen Psalms 23 . says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. you maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Steel Waters and he restoreth my soul amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer father your word is the most important thing to us the Lord as it's been said that we can open the book and turn the pages with our natural hands but it takes you to open our understanding and father that's that's the important thing and we ask that you would do that tonight Lord we humbly Lord just ask that you'd forgive us of all of our sins and our failures Lord if we've done anything said anything acted Lord in any way that would not be pleasing in your side we ask that you'd forgive us and Lord may you feel welcome here tonight Lord just to move Among Us in any spirit that would try to hinder your people I pray that you would drive it away we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can be seated this evening and um I'm just going to continue with that thought and um and if we notice David says here in these verses for one he says the Lord is my shepherd and to me this statement tells us many things as to what the Lord is to us he is my protector he is my provider he is my peace he is always present I think you you could consider that all the seven Redemptive names are wound up right there the Lord is my shepherd for he's all of these things to us and I am his possession and another thing is is he is obligated I think that's a good word he is obligated so I am his obligation and so David goes on to say that he makes me to lie down and as we talked about this before David is not forced this is not a situation that one is forced against his his will that's not the kind of relationship that exists between uh King his sheep to lie down a man by supplying the needs of his Shepherd or of his sheep for David said I shall not want and and if you look he goes on he leads me beside the Still Waters he restores my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness so this is the shepherd fulfilling his obligation to his Sheep amen uh for the shepherd is bound to the Sheep as as well as the Sheep to the shepherd and so God obligated himself to us when he made a covenant with his church ain't that rhyme a man and this Covenant is to everyone that is a part of the Church of the Living God this Covenant is to to everyone and as we talked about before it's an unconditional Covenant amen uh uh which makes it an eternal Covenant uh an Everlasting Covenant and and um uh in in other words you know um this Covenant exists by the grace of God that's that's all it is is it's just the grace of God in the Covenant exists only because of who God is and what God is and it's all about God and and we are the recipients of that Covenant but God is the one that initiated ain't that right it's the Covenant of Grace uh the prophet called her to Grace Covenant and and uh you know God Saves Man by his grace he calls a man by his grace he delivers a man by his grace ain't that right so everything is is by the grace of God we find that God made a covenant with Adam as well as with Noah and it was the conditional Covenant but then we find that man was not able to keep that Covenant uh and so by All rights God could have walked away and should have walked away and and said well you know man just can't keep his end of the bargain and and so therefore I'm not going to make any any Covenant with him but all the while God was searching and looking if we could say it that way uh in how to make a covenant a man that uh uh that that would be so secure that it would put men to rest it it would put man at peace it would you know and and so we know what the conditional Covenant is like it's it's based upon conditions of both parties uh uh so so one party says well I'll do this if you'll do this and the other party says well I'll do this if you'll do this and then they come into agreement and it becomes a conditional party and the Covenant is as good as both parties uh uh act upon their promise and fulfill their part of the the Covenant a man but man couldn't keep his end of the bargain he just couldn't do it so then then the Covenant that God would make with Abraham uh uh is not well Abraham I'll do this if you'll do this uh but it was Abraham I've already done it amen God found the solution to keep that Covenant as an Everlasting Covenant can you say man so God said I've already done it so therefore we don't have to worry we don't have to struggle we we don't have to fret God has already taken care of it amen do you believe that a man so acts 15 and 18 it says known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world Amen known unto God so then let's look at one of his Works amen Romans 8 and 29 for whom he did for no amen he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified amen so notice there is a class of people a group of people that God called he predestinated and he already Justified and glorified and so Paul would go on to ask well what shall we say to these things amen this is this is a a a a great mystery it's something that is profound amen and and and yet it's it's an unexplainable amen but yet God did it amen in the beginning and so Paul would just say what can we say to these things if God before us who can be against us there's nothing to argue about there's nothing to present to God to change it you understand what I'm saying you cannot change God's love to you and you cannot change God in any way you you just can't do it it's already settled ain't that right you can't be a a Christian good enough a man to get God's attention amen and you cannot be in in in one that that that that that is so bad to get God's attention it it's just not that way it's God all you already had God's attention from before the foundation of the world and and he established and he made a covenant with you ain't that right so you didn't have to be there to make a deal with God Amen uh concerning your salvation Nation concerning your destiny amen you you didn't have to be that it was according as Paul would tell us according to his own uh uh good pleasure his own Eternal purpose that he would make a covenant with you ain't that right so God purposed within himself to save you to heal you to deliver you to fill you with the Holy Ghost and he did this before the foundation of the world and that's why the the prophet would tell us today you was already saved you was not saved on any given day you was saved then because in the mind of God God thought of you as saved God thought of you is healed God thought of you amen uh as as his son and daughter of his now the word testament means Covenant amen and and so the Old Testament is the old Covenant which is the law that's that's the old Covenant whereas the New Testament is the New Covenant uh uh Grace ain't that right and and brother Branham called the New Covenant the spirit Covenant it's it's the spirit Covenant amen and and so notice even in the Old Testament God looking a man uh uh ahead and he says there I believe in in Isaiah or Ezekiel and and said I will pour out my spirit ain't that right amen and and he goes on I will give you a new heart and will put within you a new spirit and I will put my spirit within you and will cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them and not no law to it no demands no commands amen no oh you better or or else it was simply I will put give you a new heart a new spirit and then I'm going to give you my spirit and when I give you my spirit it's going to cause you to walk in my judgments it it's just going to do that and you're going to keep my judgments and statutes and do them ain't that right notice first John 4 and 13 hereby know that we dwell in him and he and us because he hath given us his Spirit he hath given us his Spirit see it's a spirit Covenant amen you couldn't keep that Covenant on your own ain't that right amen Romans 8 and 11. we we know this but Paul said but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by why what his Spirit not by law not by rules not not by anything you do not by an order but by his spirit that dwelleth in you can you say man so then we find it's this spirit it's the spirit of life amen uh uh uh uh Paul would I believe call it the spirit of the law of life amen but it's it's it's it's it's the spirit of life and it and it quickens that predestinated Gene seed of God in you before the foundation of the world ain't that right now brother bran talks about that spirit and of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit and and he talks about it in the restoration of the bright tree and and remember he talks about there's a law in the fish there's a law in the bird and then there's a law in you as the believer as as the bride of Christ and then that spirit the holy spirit is the one to enforce that law ain't that right now you just think of that Amen to enforce that law amen now you know uh as the prophet would tell us you know that that uh uh if you come home from a vacation and someone's living in your home and and you've got the title to that home and and all of that you you've got every right to go to the law amen the enforcement amen and tell them said this is my home I want them out of my house and and and and and they are to enforce that law ain't that right amen they are to enforce that law well so then that's what the spirit Covenant is it's it's the spirit of God coming to enforce the law how many believes that amen it's to enforce the law now Romans 8 and 15 it says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear if you are now listen God does not put his people into bondage a man is the devil that puts people into bondage can you say amen and and fear is a bondage ain't that right a man doubt is a bondage unbelief that all of these things it's it's nothing but a spirit of bondage but you have not received that type of spirit ain't that right but you have received the spirit of adoption ain't that right amen whereby we cry Abba Father and notice what he says in the 16th verse the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children or the sons of God ain't that right amen his spirit is bearing witness with our spirit that we are sons of God Amen I I just think that's awesome a man that when Satan would try to come in with unbelief the spirit of God would be there to say oh no no no don't you listen to that amen because you've not come into uh to receive that spirit of fear to come into bondage again amen but but you have received the spirit of adoption amen see now notice Romans 8 and 11 or 8 and 1. Paul says there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after what the spirit ain't that right amen now now notice you're you're not walking after the flesh the prophet says the world doesn't bother you anymore amen you see it and you walk away from it you've got something better to think of can you say man now listen Church we've got something better to think of we've got the Covenant to think about we've got the promises of God to think about and notice of how the spirit of God will direct our minds to the word of God Amen any anointed preacher would want you right back to the word of God Amen any any any uh the spirit of God that's exactly what he does Amen Even in our own cells a man Satan will come and start just telling us this and telling us that and whatever but we're not walking after the flesh amen we're walking after the spirit can you say man why the spirit itself it's the spirit Covenant and the spirit is bearing witness with our spirit that we're different we're not of this world we are the sons of God Amen see so we've got something to better to think about the prophet said everything you see with your eyes is Earthly but it's the things that you see in your spirit through the word then you say man amen we got to look at through the word amen see amen and that's what we got to see that's what we got to meditate upon a man's seat and he says the word is God's looking glass or mirror that reflects what he is and what you are can you say amen amen this word reflects what he is and what you are amen you're in this Bible amen that's right see it tells you a man so brother Branham would tell us he said this is the only book in the world that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going going show me any page of literature anywhere with all the science and anything else every good book that's been written none of it can tell you that none of it will tell you where you're going where you came from who God is and who you are amen he'll tell you about your destination there's no other book there's no other Spirit that'll tell you but God in his word can you say man so the word of God being God's mirror it shows you what he is and what you are and then brother Brown says there's a bloodline a man between in between there is a bloodline that shows what you can be if you want to make the choice can you say amen amen are you listening now amen it tells you what you can be the blood tells you what you can be the blood's got a voice can you say amen amen and it's a it's the blood of Christ speaks better things than that of Abel ain't that right Abel's blood spoke condemnation amen but this Blood speaks life it speaks peace it speaks Mercy it speaks Grace amen and that bloodline tells you that you can be a man what God's called you to be ain't that right you can be if you want to make that choice amen that's right see so then look at that second verse for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death can you say amen amen see we couldn't do it we could not obey the Covenant we couldn't keep our part of the Covenant amen we were Sinners we were bound we were no good so the spirit of God would come in amen the spirit of the Covenant amen would come into us and set us free amen ain't that right no more condemnation free from sin how many is free from sin amen free from unbelief free from all doubt free from all these things free from the cares of the world ain't that right now you say well how can that be well he says they're there the blood of the Lamb has been applied can you say man now listen Church we're talking about the Lord being Our Shepherd we're following him how can you follow a holy God how how how can your soul be restored how can you walk in the paths of righteousness as a sinner can you say man how how can you lead be led by such a a a a a God in that way amen you know where he's leading you to he's leading you in the Covenant that he promised what you're doing is you're fulfilling the very Covenant that he made but it's not you it's the spirit of God in you ain't that right so the the blood of the Lamb has been applied and the god of Heaven has accepted you his life in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God Amen so Jesus would even tell us my word is spirit and they are life ain't that right so to walk after the spirit is to walk after the word don't walk after your feelings don't walk out of your imagination don't walk after what your flesh is telling you amen you walk after that word you follow that word you obey that word you believe that word you confess that word why you're walking after the spirit and not after the flesh can you say amen amen that's right see well you know see people say well I can't live that word that word's too hard but you know what the Bible does tell us that where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now they they say well that means that you know you get to dancing you get the shouting and that's the spirit and that's all fine and that's all good and I I believe in every bit of it amen but the spirit of the Lord goes deeper than that because we've seen them dancing they're still bound we've seen them hollering they're still bound amen they can sing the old hymns of the church and they're still bound amen they can sing new songs that are coming in the church that people don't like and they can still be bound it doesn't matter on that and and people fuss and fight and they argue and they do all these things as if that really makes them something amen but hear what we're talking about is a deeper Liberty a greater Liberty and that is the spirit of the Lord amen coming upon an individual amen and bringing a liberty in that individual's life can you say Amen to where they are free to believe they are free to Rejoice they are free just to amen just to have a good time amen they're free Amen to just enjoy amen their salvation they're free Amen to live the word can you say Amen they're free Amen to walk in the paths of righteousness amen see what is it the spirit is there in that individual confirming the Covenant a man confirming the Covenant and that's what we all have I pray this evening is the spirit of the Lord bringing a Liberty in our soul amen can you say man now that don't mean you're not going to have your doubts that don't mean you're going to gonna have the fears amen tried to come upon you amen but there's a spirit of the Lord there that'll keep you a man from coming into that bondage Amen to where you're warped and you're you're you've come into like the world is and you're fearing and and all of these things yes you've got to overcome Spirits amen but you ain't going to overcome without the spirit of the Lord giving you that Liberty to do so can you say amen amen that's why we couldn't obey this Covenant amen because if we had fear how are you going to obey that Covenant amen so many people are afraid just to step out and take God at his word because of fear amen that they're they're afraid to accept the promises of God because of fear amen but when the Liberty comes abandon that gives you a freedom no matter what your uh your flesh says no matter what you feel you have the Liberty to press on Amen because the spirit of the Lord has given you that Liberty and he's there confirming confirming the Covenant to us it's there to make that word live ain't that right now brother Branham in talking about the Life of Christ I want you to listen to this now the spirit life amen he's talking about the Life of Christ and he said instead of a human being amen it was a super super human being amen now that's what they came that's what they saw in the life of Jesus Christ a man in flesh a man that was getting old older Beyond his his natural age he looked what to be 50 55 and he was only uh 30 you know and and and so so gray-haired and and and stoop shoulder wrinkles and and and and and uh all of these things amen but they saw more than just a human being the life made more than just a human being because it wasn't a natural life it wasn't a human life it was the life of God living in that body now notice that now instead of a human being it was a super super super human being and that makes the human being now not only a human being but he's a son and daughter of God of the super super super super super live that was in him and it comes back upon you and changes you from a sinner and the things of the world from a church member and a denominational goal to a born-again Christian filled with the spirit and the life of God just flowing from you oh aren't you glad for that it says it's like Sparks from an anvil amen as you walk full of virtue and love and gentleness as the Holy Spirit moving speaking there you are amen see and with uh uh hearing the message watching the pillar of fire and the Blessed assurance that I've passed from Death unto life can you say man therefore there's no condemnation at all oh I hope you understand that amen no condemnation God does not want condemnation in the Church of the Living God he does not want his people full of condemnation oh my you you know we're we're at rest can you say man ain't that the picture that David is trying to get us here is God's sheep is at rest the shepherd leading them not to agree not to a Dogma amen not to an effort of human elements a man but of God he's the one that brought the Covenant he's the one that's made it he's the one that's fulfilling it not only in Jesus Christ did he fulfill it but now he's fulfilling it in you super super super human beings and and you know I have to laugh because here's all these guys so pumped up about last night Republican Republican Republican and they woke up disappointed you know and and even if the Republicans want every seat in the house it did not change who that voter was that here is God Of Heaven that could cast his vote for you and has made you a super super human being by his own Spirit living in you why would we look at a natural man for our answers why would we look at the natural government for our peace we are at rest now notice it's a spirit Covenant so what is the Holy Spirit Isaiah 28 9. Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are winged from the milk can drawn from the breast for a precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line upon line here a little and they're a little brother says see that's how the word comes amen that's how it has come see for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest everybody say this is the rest wherewith you make calls the weary to rest and this is the refreshing now what he was speaking of was the spirit coming down on the day of Pentecost that's exactly what happened brother Branham said it and what is the rest it's the spirit of God living in the church what is your rest it's the spirit of God living inside of you amen saved and how does he give us rest in our soul amen see he for one he is our comforter he Comforts us amen he is our comfort ain't that right amen the Holy Ghost is our comforter and notice he Comforts us because he is the spirit of Truth you can never be comforted by a lying politician I don't care how good they are I don't care what how well-meaning they are they can never fulfill their their obligations amen and no matter you know and I'm gonna just you know our last president amen uh uh how good he was steamrolling he was doing good but look where he's at today and look where the nation is today there's no guarantee in politics can you say man so why would the world why would message Believers amen find a comfort in politics can you say man whether you're Democrat Republican or or or or or in between you know a hybrid I don't know see amen but the Holy Ghost is our comforter and he Comforts us because he is the spirit of Truth can you say Amen what he tells you you can make your soul upon amen what he says to you you know it's going to happen amen and this Covenant he made before the foundation of the world he did not regard your your sin he didn't regard your weakness he didn't regard your complexes he didn't regard nothing it all depended upon him he loved you amen with an undying love amen and he called you unto himself and here he is now as the spirit of Truth amen coming into US fulfilling his word that's our comfort can you say Amen whatever he says it is the truth so we're comforted by the fact that he cannot lie whatever he reveals to you is the truth can you say Amen if you've ever had uh any any any consolation at all that you're going to make it to Heaven that is the spirit of Truth talking to you amen and the devil will try his best to take that away from you amen but you'll find your comfort in the fact that it was the spirit of Truth amen that spoke to you and said you're a child of God when job needed a comforter God gave him a vision of the word Jesus Christ and job said I know my redeemer liveth and and he shall stand on Earth in the last days and what else did he say and though these skin worms eat my flesh yet in my flesh I shall see him can you say man why job was comforted amen When Death was coming on amen he didn't know where it was going to happen but God would comforted him amen by revealing the word to him can you say amen amen given him a vision amen God comforted Noah by giving him a promise that it was going to rain it had never rained before and the critics were were a million to one amen there or whatever see amen but they were there surrounding him telling him and proving to him we can prove that it won't rain we can prove that there's no rain up there amen what what facts do you have that Noah was comforted because it was God that told him it was going to rain it was more than a preacher it was was more hate men than just the pope it was more than just the government it was more than just a scientist saying we discovered something amen but God said it was going to rain and no one knew no no matter how many critics there were it was not going to stop God's promise he was comforted at rest amen he was comforted more even more as the time lingered can you say man why he had the promise amen and he was comforted because God told him that the ark was going to be his way of Escape now that's where we're at today I don't know if there's any of you sitting here that wished America would just continue on but I pray that if you are one of them that God would help you to look and change your eyesight and change your Ambitions if your Ambitions is for a future of America may your Ambitions change tonight amen and look up into heaven can you say man amen because we're comforted of one thing that there is a kingdom that is here amen we are receiving that Kingdom and we know that judgment is in the land we know tribulation is at hand but God has already Comfort our hearts to tell us before the bomb ever drops we are going to be lifted out of here can you say man this bride won't be here when that happens amen everybody else that is finding their own Comforts in in politics and religion and in their jobs and in the world and and when materialistic things you can have that but I'll take God any day let me be comforted by the word of the hour yes it's the spirit of the Lord brother Brown said that's the Comfort I get is read the is reading the word and believing what the word says that's our comfort you say well I'm in the midst of it I'm not comfortable well hey start being a believer start believing start casting them Devils out hey man quit listening to unbelieving Spirits I don't care if they're coming in your mind I don't care if they're coming from emails or or tapes or or or or or or I don't know uh your neighbor your friends your spouse your children your parents whatever it is get them out of there find your comfort in the Lord so the revealed word is our comfort the spirit of the word our covenant the words of Covenant the spirit of the word reveals to us that we're going to make it brother Brown said before an atomic bomb can destroy his church now they're talking about nuclear warfare that ain't a dream honey that's reality I don't know what you're doing but just keep it the way it was uh Judah uh uh but the way the way uh uh they're talking about nuclear warfare that ain't a picnic and they ain't dreaming that up we already know what's happening hey we know by the word of God it's coming ain't that right you say Putin's crazy I'll tell you what he is he's anointed can you say man he's anointed to do what he's doing yes sir he is and whether he's the one whether it's going to happen in his time or whatever's time I I don't know that all I know is they're talking about it and it's going to happen any day but notice but before an atomic bomb can destroy his church he will come and stretch forth his wings and his children will know his voice and that familiar cry that he gives when he leaves the Rapids of Glory can you say amen and I'll tell you that voice ain't going to be in the voice of a politician that voice in there come on church that voice ain't in the voice of some church denomination that voice was in the voice of Malachi 4. can you say man we don't need another Prophet on the scene we've already got Malachi for Amen to give us rapturing faith we're hearing the voice and his church will be taken away on the wings of his salvation can you say Amen now so we find amen we're finding our comfort amen God the spirit of Truth has revealed to us that corruption cannot inherit incorruption amen but don't you worry about that because we're all going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we're finding our comfort because it was the spirit of truth that revealed that can you say man that's right see so the spirit also the spirit of adoption is our advocate oh my a man see the spirit of the Covenant see it's our Advocate an advocate is an intercessor or a consoler so so Webster says an advocate is one who defends or maintains a cause one who promotes or supports the interest of one one who pleads the calls of another oh my so God Not only would make a covenant but he would become our Advocate not just trying to show you how sure this Covenant is to put us at rest amen see our Advocate does things that we cannot do it stands in your place interceding to God on your behalf now you think of that on your behalf when you don't seem to get anywhere with God your Advocate is with God interceding on your behalf can you say man and when it doesn't seem that God understands where you're at your Advocate is with God interceding to God on your behalf when you're in the worst trial of your life and it doesn't look like you're going to make it there is an advocate on your what that is pleading on your behalf he is caught he's bringing up to God your calls amen and it has nothing to do about you being good it has nothing about you being a bad it all is about God you remember the Covenant you made with them people God you can't destroy them people God you brought a blood a man to where them people can be cathered at all times amen he's advocating your calls and notice your Advocate your Advocate brother Brown said it has Mercy it is your righteousness it is a propitiation for your sins it's your healing it's your life it's your Resurrection oh my we got an advocate can you say man oh that means ever felt your faith getting so weak you just didn't know what to do and your Advocate never it never stops he's constantly advocating for you yes sir yes sir yeah aren't you glad you got an advocate amen this world all needs an advocate but they've turned him down they rejected their pardon they they didn't want nothing about him but we receive him and here we are just the common-born people that we're still pressing when we should have been under we're still moving it ain't you that's doing it it's an advocate and notice he's constantly making intercession for us all the time when you're asleep he's making an intercession when you forget to pray he's making intercession hello when you're reading the Bible and you don't understand maybe what you're reading he's an intercessor amen you may be listening to a tape and you don't understand what the prophet means by that he's your intercessor when the world is coming against you and these religious demons are are are trying to Prevail over you he's our intercessor hallelujah how else are you going to make it how else are these young people going to make it there's going to be a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish and it would have never happened without our intercessor can you say man when we feel like the biggest flood of our life our biggest failure of our life he's still interceding for you why there is a covenant Spirit of the Covenant and there is a blood keeping us covered all the time brother Brown said we're going to make mistakes and yet we don't do it willfully Brown said you're trapped in anything you're trapped into or do something that you don't mean to do it it's not sin yet because you'll repent in the minute you see that you're wrong you'll turn quickly and say I didn't mean it I didn't see that and you'll say that all through life and you say Amen so he makes intercession for our ignorance brother Brown said sometimes we got the Holy Ghost he said see when we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into something the holy spirit's there to make advocate for us he is our advocator he stands there he's our attorney oh you got the best attorney you could ever have he's our attorney amen he's our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Ghost in US pleads for us the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you cannot understand he makes intercessions for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I walk like a little kid you walk like a little fella we're walking in the dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything and you say oh I'm afraid to take a Christian Life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this don't you be afraid everybody say don't be afraid come on Church Don't Be Afraid we have an advocate amen oh he stands by us he is in us and he makes intercessions for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly making an advocate for us all the time and if God before us who can be against us there is no weapon that can prosper against us can you say man amen you're going to make it he calls there's an advocate oh God's already provided you the attorney the judge became your attorney there was a man speaking in Oklahoma a minister from England and he's talking about the wig and how did they still wear the wigs in England and that one day the judge's daughter showed up in court and stood before him and she had a fine and here you know he asked her are you guilty yep I'm guilty he said well I sentence you or this this you're going to have to pay so much and her her eyes just got big or her jaw just dropped like how could you say he was a judge and he judged by the law and when she's about to turn away she's in tears about to turn away he just takes off the wig s off the robes and he stood up and went around now he's her father and he pulls out a checkbook and he writes the check and said here you are paid in full she went out that court all happy and excited but that's what God done our judge became our attorney the judge that that said you that can com told us that we were Sinners that the judge that condemned us also became our attorney he also became our lamb he he became everything that we needed him to be can you say Amen but now notice he cannot do one thing for you everybody say he cannot do one thing for me he cannot make intercession for you until you first confess that it's done so you have to believe him to be your intercessor can you say man and you have to confess it he's my he he's my Advocate he's my intercessor he's advocating for me I I'm I'm not worthy I understand that see but he but but he said it can you say amen and when you begin to confess the word he becomes the intercessor and the prophet said he can only act when we confess can you say amen that's why you you shouldn't let just just let your mouth just go numb and let the devil fight your little mind amen but you speak the word speaking the word is it very important can you say Amen confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved you say well I'm thinking of scriptures talk scriptures can you say man talk them scriptures talk them quotes amen say what the prophet said say what the Bible says amen and you may have to say it a thousand times but say it again amen bro the more you say it he's constantly making intercession for you ain't that right then the Holy Ghost is our seal a man and a seal is a finished work so this is The Testament that God cannot lose you amen see the infinite God who saves you here knowing he's going to lose you next week next month next year the prophet said while he's defeating the very purpose he can not lose you so God gave you the Holy Ghost as a sign that he recognized you at his own as his own in the beginning and he has laid claim to you can you say Amen so I want to say it this way if you're walking in a legalistic way tonight and if you're following after walking out the flesh you are not walking in the New Testament are you with me because the New Testament the New Testament is is the New Covenant ain't that right we are not to walk in in the law under law we are not to walk under the legalism and we're not if that condemnation is bothering you you're not walking in the after the newness of the Covenant the New Covenant the New Testament amen the New Testament is God's grace to you can you say Amen the New Testament is the product of calvary a man the New Covenant see the new covenant's got to be effective in you ain't that right the new covenant's got to be effective in you see so God fulfilled his part of the Covenant in Christ and now God comes inside of you given his own spirit in you to fulfill your part of that Covenant I think it is important as to how we introduce God to the people some make him out to be a tyrant ready to kill anything and everything that moves ministers have portrayed God in in such a horrible way to where fear resides in the hearts of the people instead of faith can you say man I think it's important to preach the promises because you see you may not be there tonight it you you may not you you may not but what we're doing is we're waving the promises over you we're waving them over you can you say man sure it would be easy to pull down all the faults and the failures and and I'll be honest with you it doesn't take a genius to come up with some problems can you say man because we're all human and and and we can start naming problems weaknesses and all everything and then it'll it'll hit a lot of you can you say Amen but that's not what we're meant to do that's not what we're called to do amen but we're called to wave the promises over you that's why we ought to study this message that's right preachers ought to study this message to wave it over the people can you say man wave it over the people see amen so so they have they've been ministers have portrayed God in such a way that it doesn't build faith it builds fear and its anchors and a fear into the hearts of people and it takes the grace of God to deliver them people from it and I ain't talking about fear that is connected with respect and reverence the fear that I'm speaking of drives people away from God drives them as as Adam ran and hid from the presence of the Lord Adam had every right though too to to hide because he was using his own covering to approach God can you say Amen but notice when God God made a way to where Adam wouldn't have to run from him again Hallelujah he took off that old covering he took off that man-made theology amen and he and he made a covering for Adam himself to where Adam didn't have to run he could run to God with an atonement can you say amen amen see God took the bloody skin of an animal and wrapped at him with it and it showed right there that one day he would be wrapped up in skin and he would take his own blood and cover the church with it amen and he would perfect them forever that are Sanctified he would take his own blood and would loose us from our sins he would pour himself into us and and his life in us would be a token to us amen that we are redeemed how many beliefs you're redeemed you got to believe it by faith I'm redeemed yeah but you don't know where I'm at but I'm redeemed you got to believe it you can't walk you can't follow the Shepherd in doubt can you say man if you if we're living in doubt and we're letting doubt rule our lives and it shows you're not eating in the Green Pastures and you say man see and and so there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ brother Brown said when God accepted me and baptized me with the Holy Ghost he had confidence in me that I would not sin willfully God help us he kept us in that body of corruption hello kept us in that body that had a sticky nature brother Brown said as long as you're in that body you'll always have a sticky nature but it showed that God had confidence in us that we would not do it willfully amen he had confidence in me that I would not sin willfully a man I would not sin willfully therefore his son made an atonement for me and I cannot be a sinner as long as I'm Justified and he's took me into his body I'm redeemed with him not what I do but what he did for me that's the gospel Hallelujah so the Bible tells us that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world that's all right your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now the legalists will teach that your name can be taken off that book off that Lamb's Book of Life but that's an error brother Brown said that church is a predestinated church and every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem every name that was ever put on that book Jesus came to redeem and you were chosen before the foundation of the world or you wasn't chosen at all he just come to redeem that name on the book can you say Amen amen see now now it's by faith that we accept it by faith can you see men now I want you to notice how secure we are Ephesians 4 30. it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption oh God now brother Brown said you're sealed into the body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost not from one Revival to another one but until the day of the body of redemption that's what you are so there's no way for you to be lost you get scared and that's the reason scare a scare fear company's doubt love companies faith I love my father I'm not afraid of him because I love him he wouldn't hurt me he will do good for me if I was scared of him and oh I don't know whether he will do it or not see but if I love him yes Father I love you and I know you're my father and you love me and I'm not afraid but what you'll keep your word get your promise to me then you say man that's what love does it makes the promise of God personal it's your promise to me how how can we wake up next in the morning without knowing them promises are to us where would we stand when we know that the wrath of God is coming any moment the the Rapture is coming the changing of our body oh God help us to get it in our soul that we can wake up with confidence and a song and a heart a praise on our lips this is your promise to me can you say Amen oh yes sir he said see that's the way the spirit of God does but oh he said if I did this and if I did that see there you come to the legal side again never go to the legal side everybody say that never go to the legal side it's negative don't let your mind well I wish I could have done that I should have gotten up and prayed more I should have this and I said you know you can tear your mind up doing that you could tear yourself totally up well I prayed an hour I should have prayed an hour and five minutes Satan will work your mind up can you say Amen but never go to the legal side it's negative should you pray yes or you should pray should you read yes you should read your Bible should you listen to them tapes you should be in them tapes all the time but never let it become illegal yes you never go to the legal side it's negative the positive side is what you want what is the positive side it's already a finished work that's what the prophet said that's the positive it's a finished work the positive I am saved the positive I am healed the positive is is my child is coming back home the positive is God's working this all out the positive is I'm going to make it the positive is the Satan you cannot touch me the positive see he said the positive side is what you want it's already a finished word Christ died and the sin was killed when he died and if God for ordained you to eternal life all the father has given me will come to me there you are you cannot be lost somebody confess it I can't be lost I can't be lost amen see why you're secured forever for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and by one sacrifice he has perfected forever there you are there's no way for us to lose on now notice I hope it's okay but notice he restoreth my soul that we've talked about it you're an outside person that has five senses and them senses are given to you to contact your Earthly home not God not contact God but your Earthly home then the inside of that is your spirit it has five senses by which you can contact the spirit world brother Brown said your physical contacts the physical your spiritual contacts the spiritual you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties at all your body doesn't so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being because reason doesn't see taste fail smell or hear see reasoning is what you can make in your mind if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying they're dead but your spirit still can reason see and so there's five senses that can control that inside man right and we talked about that see but what David is speaking of goes so much deeper than your flesh or your spirit can you say amen amen and and that last man the prophet would say it's the soul and only has one sense that controls it and that is free moral agency ain't that right man's free will to reject her to choose now notice what he says that soul is a gene that come from God ain't that right so remember the outside man can be Anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit your spirit man can be anointed and still you're so be lost we've talked about it how the soul is the nature of your spirit your spirit controls your your soul controls your spirit your spirit controls the flesh so no matter what happens on the outside your desires come from your soul ain't that right you can come in here cry be anointed dance and woohoo Hong all that but you can leave with the same desires and never be changed ain't that right Prophet said people can live in this Spirit they could dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit now notice in another place he said that spirit is of a worldly nature because it was not given from God but it was given or permitted by God now you got that for every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies that right so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with but listen but when our old Nature has died you become a new creature or creation ain't that right not your spirit being anointed that doesn't make you a new creation not your flesh being all going through all the forms of religion rituals orders of the church even though they could be good good orders too they don't make you a saint second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new and notice Church listen there is no such thing as a sinner saint can't be the same thing you're either a sinner or you're a saint but don't play the game He Loves Me He Loves Me Not He Loves Me He Loves Me Not that's that's your reasoning if you are if you ever have an inkling that God loves you Hallelujah well the devil ain't gonna tell you that he loves you that'll ain't gonna tell you God loves you hell ain't gonna tell you God's for you can you say Amen amen and if you ever have that little England that God cares about you then you stay with that England because the devil's going to come and try to take that away from you but you just remember Jesus Christ to sing yesterday today and forever he cannot change so let's look how secure we are if you don't mind for just a few moments then I'll let you go First John 3 9 whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin now the legalists have jumped on this scripture and bashed the people up for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God oh do you love that now notice before Prophet said before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwelling in the human heart it first must be repented it must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and then the Holy Fire and Holy Ghost come from God comes down and burns out all the desire of sin hello people used to love to drink love to party lived for it spent their checks on it people love to gamble they'll spend their whole paycheck with it for it they love pornography they'll spin their whole paycheck on them magazines and internet websites oh they love video games and they'll spend all of their time with that and all their energy they love the things materialistic things and look where they put all their time invest their money and invest all of it Church set still everything just just comes to a halt when it comes to God why because that love is there out in the world can you say man watch he comes and burns the desire of it out all the nature of the world therefore he that sins willfully after receiving the knowledge of truth then then again the Bible says it's impossible for a man that's born of God cannot sin he does not sin there's no way for him to sin how can he be a sinner and redeemed at the same time how can I be in the pawn shop and be out of the pawn shop at the same time oh he redeemed Us by his blood by his Spirit he cleansed us and then comes to dwell in us the church not the denomination now the church so notice what David says he restoreth my soul I'm not in the pawn shop no more I'm not a slave to sin anymore I'm not a in bondage to fear anymore can you say man so this restoration begins in the soul and that is by the new birth quickening power can you say man now notice as as we get ready to wind down Jehovah's Witness talks about the breath and they say you know that that the breath of you that you breathe is the soul but that's not true see brother Brown says if that be true then your one time you're one kind of a soul the next time you're somebody else and has breathed that soul and look where you'd be breath is the wind and wind is what you breathe into your nostrils ain't that right if the breath that you breathe is your soul then every animal is a living Soul because they breathe a human soul and our soul and all together if breath is your soul right but he says then Jesus wouldn't have had to Die the animal sacrifice wouldn't have been or would have been sufficient but notice what Genesis 2 7 says and the Lord God formed a Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul notice God breathed the breath of eternal life then Man became a living soul a soul that cannot die oh see he breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul and brother Brown said yes Adam died but remember before he died he had a lamb that redeemed him can you say Amen God got a lamb to redeem them why for whom he foreknow he also called and Justified and glorified So Adam was breathing the breath of the Eternal God for he was a son of God listen brother Bram goes on to say the Church of God is born by the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostril spiritually of Adam and he became a living soul and the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God ain't that right John 20 21 then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so sinned I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost brother Brown said he breathed on them the promise thy Lord amen that's why it's important to preach the promise that's why we needed a prophet in this age with thus said the Lord can you say amen he said see now the African word for wind is a Moya remember brother I'm talking about that which means the wind and unseen Force he said animals breathe the Moya Sinners breathe a Moya but God especially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with god listen he had power like God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now but God of the earth and someday the sons of God will again become gods oh if we could understand where we're living at today oh don't get quiet on me don't let the devil take you away listen to what I'm saying they're going to come Gods again sons of God will be Gods again I believe with all my heart we're here at that position again in adoption we're at a place where the devil don't know what to do with us can you say Amen see someday the sons of God will again become Gods Jesus said so is it not written in your law you are Gods then if he can call you those if you if you can call those who he called God who God visited how can you condemn me and say or when I say I'm the Son of God so notice the spiritual man has a spiritual soul that can never die and the carnal man has a religious atmosphere around him and wants to worship and so forth but it's carnal not an unbeliever but a carnal believer and that's the kind that was rejected but you are a new creation you are a new creation of God ain't that right we did not become seed by rebirth we were seed him therefore we were Reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we received as the reason we could be quickened can you say Amen in unseat there's nothing to Quicken they'll just continue on being religious but I pray that every one of us has a quickening that God could breathe the Breath of Life can you say Amen oh do you love him we could go on and on other people being anointed Amen in their flesh anointed in their Spirit but they're not anointed to the word a man because the soul is the gene seed can you say Amen amen that's right see they're not in order of the word but he says they're real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ of a a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world see now that's the one that can be quick and that's the thing that's being restored amen he said like a baby when it enters into the womb of its mother it comes by a little germ and crawls into the egg he said it doesn't form one cell a human the next a dog and the next the cat and the next the horse that's not what this restoration is it's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell you understand what I'm saying it's not part Son of God part church member part this and part that oh God you wasn't born a human being with an intelligence of an ape with the face of a giraffe and legs like a hippo no you came from a human Sail and it was human sale adding to human sale and human sale adding to human sale till it formed a baby right and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be word of God on top of word word on Word that's what's building the sons of God word on top of word on top of word on top of word give me the word can you say Amen not a denominational Creed and then a word and a Creed and it won't work you can't have that leaven in it only one eternal life in Jesus Christ the word can you say man in the beginning was the word the word was with God see where your origin starts with the word of God the Eternal thought of God can you say Amen see and you've come down here as a fallen attribute but there was a word seed laying down inside of you in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us oh isn't he wonderful oh my my if the musicians will come I pray it's been a help to you tonight word on top of word word on top of word amen amen amen Hebrews 6 1. through six therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works into Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit listen for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance now you know what the prophet says about that it ain't talking about someone that is part took of all that and then and then left and now they can't come back Rob said that don't mean that at all Prophet says it's impulse further to go back you can never come a sinner again that's just how secure you are say brother Brown said now he goes now he's beginning to talk about what is it let's go on to perfection not laying not Colonel laying the foundation here of doctrines baptism reformations and so forth let's not do that let's go into Perfection the subject is perfection and Perfection comes by Christ how did we get in Christ by joining the church by one Spirit we're all baptized in one body not by one tongue talked in one C shook one shook hand hand shook in and you know water baptized in but by one Spirit we're baptized into one body you get it and that's the perfection aren't you glad for that see we are then perfect through Christ and we are free from judgment through Christ we shall never die through Christ we have lost death and found life through Christ not through any church not through any denomination not through any fantastic not through speaking with tongues shouting shaking or dancing in the spirit but by grace restoreth my soul Hallelujah I love the Lord for the brand says see it's not him that wants to be saved not him that willeth or him that runeth it's God that showeth Mercy and no man can come to Jesus except God draws him first so what you got to do with it anyhow you haven't got nothing to do with it you are out of the picture all together you say well how do I know the grace of God you know it was the grace the prophet said it was Grace to us that God sent us a prophet and I'm going to just go further because why would God send the prophet if the elect doesn't hear it so I say it's also Grace that God would bring us to this message yes the
