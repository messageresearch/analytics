[36:10] thought from this morning maybe talk a
[36:12] little more on the exploits or on the
[36:15] reflection and so I hope that'll be okay
[36:18] tonight I've I've been on these lines
[36:20] from for some time back home so I been
[36:23] just taking my Liberty this today so
[36:26] hope that's been okay uh Genesis 12:1
[36:29] the Bible would say now the Lord said
[36:31] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[36:34] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[36:36] father's house and unto a land that I
[36:38] will show thee and I will make thee a
[36:41] great nation I Will Bless thee and make
[36:44] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[36:46] blessing amen can we bow our heads
[36:49] tonight dear heavenly father Lord we're
[36:51] thankful for your grace and your mercy
[36:53] father thank you for coming Among Us
[36:55] this morning Lord as we felt your
[36:57] presence Lord and your anointing but
[36:59] Lord this is another opportunity father
[37:01] another service that you've allowed us
[37:04] to have Lord God as we come into your
[37:06] presence we ask that you would feel
[37:08] welcome Among Us Lord God I ask that you
[37:10] would anoint your vessel tonight Lord As
[37:12] I Lay myself aside speak through these
[37:14] lips of clay Lord I ask that you would
[37:16] speak to the hearts and to the needs
[37:18] Lord we ask these things in your
[37:20] precious name amen you may be seated
[37:24] tonight so we see in our our scripture
[37:26] reading here that Abraham had a
[37:29] visitation and the visitation was a
[37:32] calling out and I believe that the the
[37:34] purpose of the calling out was for
[37:36] exploits and and God would tell him get
[37:39] get out of thy country and I will make
[37:42] thee a great nation I'm I'm going to
[37:44] bless your seed I'm going to produce
[37:46] something through you that you're not
[37:48] able to do so something Supernatural was
[37:51] going to take place and we see that
[37:53] Abraham was separated for a purpose and
[37:56] I like how the Bible is put
[37:58] I'm going to make thee a great nation
[38:00] I'm going to bless thee it's nothing to
[38:02] do with human ability but I'm going to
[38:05] do it through you and we know that it's
[38:07] been God's desire to have men and women
[38:09] in his own image to express himself
[38:12] through you know but the branam would
[38:13] preach a message called the Masterpiece
[38:15] and he would and he it's an incredible
[38:17] sermon he would talk about Michelangelo
[38:19] and the sculpture of Moses and he would
[38:21] say nobody knew what Michelangelo was
[38:23] making but he himself and it would be in
[38:26] his mind and since he would have a
[38:28] vision in his mind he would work by a
[38:30] pattern and he would start to do work
[38:32] day by day mother brandom said it would
[38:34] be hours countless nights where he he
[38:37] didn't sleep much but then all of a
[38:39] sudden that vision would start to take
[38:42] change into an image where it wasn't
[38:44] just in the mind but then it was coming
[38:46] into reality and I love how brother
[38:48] Brandon would say it there would be a
[38:50] reflection that matched his vision so
[38:52] all of the years of hard work would
[38:54] start to pay off because there was
[38:57] something thing the negative had become
[38:59] the positive and then brother Brandon
[39:01] would say let's close that book and talk
[39:02] about the great sculpture and brother
[39:04] Brandon would would say that he didn't
[39:06] have to find materials to create a
[39:09] masterpiece he would create the
[39:11] materials he was the great the the the
[39:13] the great sculpture and he would say he
[39:15] would create and bring into existence
[39:17] what his attributes desired and I
[39:20] thought that was powerful that it was
[39:22] his attributes that desired for you to
[39:24] be here you didn't desire to be here but
[39:27] God desired you to be here it wasn't
[39:29] because your mom and your daddy come
[39:30] together a great grandparents
[39:32] grandparents come together but God
[39:34] wanted you to be here he had a desire
[39:36] for a reflection so he would
[39:38] predestinate you to come into existence
[39:41] and brother Brandon would tell us he
[39:42] would create all the creeping things
[39:44] create the Tigers create the the the
[39:47] animals he would create the nature but
[39:49] then there would finally come upon the
[39:51] earth a Perfection and he would say
[39:54] finally there come upon the earth a
[39:55] Perfection and that was a man and then
[39:58] he could see in that man that it looked
[40:00] like him so now when he looked upon him
[40:03] he was a reflection of what the Creator
[40:06] was God had now been able to achieve the
[40:09] thing that he wanted a man in his own
[40:11] image and we would see that the same
[40:14] nature that was in God would be in Adam
[40:16] brother Brandon would tell us that Adam
[40:18] he would speak to the storm he would
[40:20] speak to he would speak to the tree be
[40:22] plucked up and planted over here the
[40:24] Bible would tell us that he would create
[40:26] or he would he would name all all the
[40:27] animals all with the spoken word just
[40:30] like God could speak the word the
[40:32] reflection could speak the word and just
[40:34] like God was eternal the reflection was
[40:37] was eternal the Angels couldn't be a
[40:39] reflection they didn't have a soul they
[40:42] they wasn't made after God's likeness
[40:44] but man was a masterpiece in the mind of
[40:48] God and brother Brandon would tell us
[40:50] that God wanted a masterpiece family so
[40:52] he would strike the left side of Adam
[40:54] and from Adam he would come and help me
[40:57] and and like I brother Brandon would say
[40:58] he didn't create another creation he
[41:01] took from the original creation and from
[41:03] the original brought forth Eve so now
[41:06] they were one and the same and God what
[41:08] would God say when he would come to the
[41:10] Garden Adam Adam Where Art Thou there
[41:13] were One Creation there were one there
[41:15] there were one and the same and it was
[41:17] only after the fall that Adam would call
[41:20] her Eve so before while they was in
[41:22] Perfection it was one creation and oh my
[41:25] I believe God has brought the bride and
[41:27] the groom back together where it's One
[41:30] Creation once again but brother Brandon
[41:32] would tell us that he was so pleased
[41:34] with this masterpiece that he would rest
[41:37] on the seventh day brother brandom says
[41:39] while God was resting the devil would
[41:41] slip into the garden and would Mar this
[41:43] masterpiece and he says now the
[41:45] Masterpiece is marred so no longer is
[41:48] Adam speaking to Nature now he's running
[41:50] from nature he's not he's not speaking
[41:53] to the storm or petting Leo the Lion but
[41:55] now he's running from Leo the Lion so no
[41:58] longer is Adam reflecting eternity but
[42:01] now Adam is reflecting another land and
[42:04] then brother Brandon would tell us what
[42:05] we reflect here is only the land that we
[42:08] are dwelling in he says as I said in the
[42:10] beginning what you are somewhere else is
[42:13] what you reflect here what you are what
[42:15] your Celestial body or or body is up
[42:18] yonder what your Celestial body is
[42:19] somewhere else is what you are
[42:21] reflecting back here in the spirit land
[42:24] what you are what you are here if you're
[42:25] still vulgar minded and so forth in the
[42:28] spirit land you're vulgar minded here if
[42:30] you got malice Envy Strife you're in
[42:33] you're in the spirit land with that it
[42:36] reflects back here so the land that we
[42:38] are dwelling spiritually only reflects
[42:41] naturally so in order to be a reflection
[42:45] we got to get out of the land of bondage
[42:47] and into our inheritance in order to
[42:50] reflect eternity we got to change our
[42:52] dwelling place and we would see that in
[42:55] order for Abraham to be a reflection
[42:58] there had to be a separation and that
[43:00] separation would put him in a position
[43:03] for the blessing of God to fall upon his
[43:05] life and you see the natural seat of
[43:08] Abraham the naturally he had a he had to
[43:10] make a separation but we might not have
[43:12] to leave a natural land but it might be
[43:14] a spiritual land it might you know it
[43:17] can be the simple things movies gossip
[43:19] or whatever but then it could also go
[43:21] into the deeper things of theology what
[43:23] you think is right what Dr so and so
[43:26] said or what this this one says it's a
[43:28] land that we can dwell in that keeps us
[43:31] from reflecting the Eternal Heights but
[43:33] God has given us a message in this
[43:35] generation that I believe is our
[43:37] Promised Land it is our inheritance
[43:40] that's the land we are to dwell in not
[43:43] what so and so said not what this one
[43:45] says but there's the land God has given
[43:47] us that we are to reflect and we see
[43:50] that the land we live in is only what we
[43:53] reflect and we can see in the Bible that
[43:55] the children of Israel even though they
[43:57] were called and promised the land they
[44:00] were only reflecting bondage as long as
[44:03] they were in Egypt you see but once they
[44:05] got out of Egypt their reflection
[44:07] changed oh my it took the the promised
[44:09] land would take somebody that was being
[44:12] beaten somebody that had to make had to
[44:14] make bricks and was and was bound by
[44:16] another but once they come out of that
[44:18] land out of that land there would come a
[44:21] liberty when they come out of bondage
[44:23] there would be a freedom and they would
[44:25] walk into a new land and when say give
[44:28] me my Mountain it was the same people
[44:30] but in a different land oh my and this
[44:32] message has taken the same people that
[44:35] was once Bound by theology that was once
[44:38] Bound by ideas that was once Bound by
[44:40] Creeds has taken the same vessels but
[44:43] plac him in another land that they can
[44:46] reflect the mind of God oh my you see
[44:49] we're just a reflection of what this
[44:51] message is and this message is the
[44:53] thoughts of God to the body oh
[44:56] Hallelujah he would anoint the prophet
[44:58] to bring forth the thoughts of God now
[45:01] there's a vessel that has changed their
[45:03] Dwelling Place changed their land and is
[45:05] reflecting the mind of God brother
[45:08] Brandon would say now total separation
[45:10] from all unbelief and remember Abraham
[45:13] the patriarch was never fully blessed
[45:16] until he obeyed exactly what God said to
[45:19] do and will never never never be blessed
[45:21] any and have the blessings until we obey
[45:25] what God Said to do so before we can be
[45:28] a reflection we got to come out of a
[45:30] land into a new land and you see in the
[45:33] Bible would tell us in Genesis 13 and 14
[45:36] and the Lord said unto Abram after that
[45:38] lot was separated from him now lift up
[45:41] thine eyes lift up from th place where
[45:43] thou art northward Southward Eastward
[45:46] Westward for all the land which thou
[45:48] seest to thee will I give it and thy
[45:51] seed forever and I will make thy seed as
[45:54] the dust of the earth so that if a man
[45:56] can number the dust of the earth then
[45:59] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[46:01] arise and walk through the land of it
[46:03] the length of it and the breath of it
[46:05] for I will give it to thee and I like
[46:08] how he how he starts it now the Lord
[46:10] said unto Abram after lot was separated
[46:14] from him so after the separation then
[46:17] God would give The Possession oh come on
[46:20] now after the separation then God would
[46:23] say arise it's time to walk through your
[46:25] inheritance everything that you see now
[46:29] belongs to you you know what that would
[46:31] be a voice I would want to hear when you
[46:33] want to hear that whatever you see is
[46:35] yours whatever your footsteps can walk
[46:38] upon is yours since there's a separation
[46:41] I'm going to give the possession and oh
[46:44] my I think it's time that we make a
[46:46] separation so that we can fully receive
[46:50] what God has given to us brother Brandon
[46:52] would tell us that Footprints mean
[46:54] possession so if if you have made a
[46:56] separation it ain't time to get lazy
[46:59] with the things of God it's time to walk
[47:01] through it he would say walk through the
[47:02] length of it and the breadth of it
[47:04] whatever you can see belongs to you and
[47:07] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[47:09] trouble with the Christians today they
[47:11] are air of all things and they and he
[47:13] would say well brother if I bought a
[47:14] house or somebody give me a house I
[47:17] would go through every room of it I
[47:19] would go down in the basement I would go
[47:21] out in the garage I want to know what I
[47:23] own and that's the way it was when I got
[47:26] saved the God these are God's promises
[47:28] so I just went through every one of them
[47:31] claimed every one of them they are mine
[47:33] he says that's the problem is they don't
[47:35] want to go through it but if there's a
[47:37] separation it's time to arise oh
[47:40] hallelujah it's time to arise get into
[47:43] this word and see what God gave you God
[47:46] has given you a sound mind God has given
[47:49] you a peace God has given you a hope
[47:51] God's giv you courage to face the enemy
[47:54] that comes against your mind God's Ging
[47:56] giv you a Rapture it's time to arise and
[47:59] see what God has given us oh it's time
[48:02] to stop listening to the negative
[48:04] thoughts and listen to what these tapes
[48:06] say oh come on now I don't care what the
[48:08] complexes say what do God what does God
[48:11] say I'm going to arise and walk through
[48:14] my land brother the Brandon would say
[48:16] it's like a variety store he says if
[48:18] it's as big as this church he says if I
[48:20] walked into it and it was mine he says I
[48:23] would walk through every every shelf of
[48:25] it I would walk through the behind the
[48:27] counter I wanted to see what belonged to
[48:29] me if it was all mine I wanted to go see
[48:32] it and I think it's time we go see what
[48:34] God has given us amen and he's telling
[48:37] Abraham not what you can do but what I
[48:40] can do but then he would stop and he
[48:42] would say then Thou shalt be a blessing
[48:45] so it's it goes from I'm going to bless
[48:48] thee I'm going to make thee a great
[48:49] nation to now you're got a part to play
[48:53] I'm going to pour out the blessing now
[48:55] you got to reflect the blessing oh
[48:58] Hallelujah so it went from God then to
[49:00] Abraham and oh my God has has fulfilled
[49:03] his part he's given us a message now
[49:06] it's our turn to pick it up and reflect
[49:08] it it's our turn to take it off the
[49:11] tapes and put it into a life oh my but
[49:14] you see I love the election of God and
[49:17] God didn't just one day you know look up
[49:19] and say you know what I better find
[49:20] somebody to have a to have a supersede
[49:23] through he didn't do that before Abraham
[49:27] was ever upon the Earth he already knew
[49:29] Abraham was going to be the father of
[49:31] Nations so when Abraham come upon the
[49:34] Earth God's plan would start to come
[49:36] into fulfillment to pour out the
[49:38] blessing and we would see the Psalms
[49:40] would say in Psalms 3 and8 salvation
[49:43] belongeth unto the Lord thy blessing is
[49:46] upon thy people and so the blessing of
[49:49] God couldn't just follow on anybody but
[49:51] the predestinated of God and I say
[49:54] you're not here by accident you haven't
[49:56] heard this message by accident but the
[49:59] blessing of God is only for the people
[50:01] of God oh brother Brandon would say this
[50:04] but when he came ex expressed exactly
[50:08] like the New Testament said he would be
[50:10] expressed or The Testament said he would
[50:11] be expressed then all of those who were
[50:14] redeemable believed it because they were
[50:17] the thoughts of God the attributes of
[50:19] him at the beginning was made flesh and
[50:22] redeemable and was brought back to God
[50:25] as many as received him to them gave he
[50:28] the power to become the sons of God
[50:31] because they were redeemable oh because
[50:34] you were redeemable even though when you
[50:36] was far out there whenever you was doing
[50:38] your doing your own thing it was because
[50:41] you were redeemable God would pour out
[50:43] the blessing it was because you were
[50:45] redeemable God will pour out the favor
[50:48] and we would see that the favor blessing
[50:50] of God changes everything we would see
[50:53] that the favor of God would come to
[50:55] Little Mary that could not do anything
[50:58] but the favor of God would come to her
[51:00] and would say this in Luke 1:28 the
[51:02] angel came in unto her and said hell
[51:05] thou are highly highly favored the Lord
[51:08] is with thee blessed art thou among
[51:10] women so the favor of God would being
[51:13] bring the blessing of God so that
[51:15] exploits could come through her she
[51:17] would look at the angel and would say I
[51:19] know not a man how can I do these things
[51:22] and he would say the Holy Ghost is going
[51:24] to overshadow you the blessing is going
[51:26] to overshadow you and you're going to
[51:29] produce it oh Hallelujah you could to be
[51:31] a reflection in your own ability but the
[51:34] blessing of God would be poured upon you
[51:37] that you can be a reflection the Bible
[51:39] would tell us in Genesis 29- 17 Leo was
[51:42] tendere eyed but Rachel was beautiful
[51:45] and well favored and I like this
[51:47] scripture because Rachel couldn't have
[51:49] children she couldn't do Leah could but
[51:52] there was one thing that Rachel could
[51:55] always point back to she was favored oh
[51:58] she might not have much to give this one
[52:00] could have more to offer but she had one
[52:02] thing the favor of Jacob and little
[52:04] church you've got the favor of almighty
[52:06] God oh my we might be a small
[52:08] congregation we might not have a big
[52:10] youth group we might not have a a
[52:12] worship team a a robe choir but you got
[52:15] the favor of God that has come to you
[52:17] and says you are my reflection you might
[52:20] not got much to offer you might not got
[52:22] much to give but you are favored oh and
[52:25] also he would say say you are well
[52:27] beautiful you're beautiful and well
[52:29] favored in the sight of God whenever all
[52:32] the worship the Bible would tell us is a
[52:34] stench in the nostrils of God he looks
[52:37] at you and says you're beautiful how
[52:39] come you're beautiful cuz you're favored
[52:42] the favor of God has brought a
[52:44] Perfection it has brought a a blame
[52:46] mistake that in the sight of God he
[52:48] looks through every circumstance God
[52:50] looks through critics God looks through
[52:52] Skeptics and all he sees is blaspheme
[52:55] but he looks at you and sees Perfection
[52:58] he sees a beauty that only the blood can
[53:00] bring oh hallelujah it's not a natural
[53:03] beauty he looks at you it says you are
[53:06] favored Hallelujah so the bride is found
[53:10] favored because of election the favor of
[53:12] God ain't to Puff you up but the favor
[53:15] of God is to fulfill the purpose and the
[53:17] Bible would tell us in Romans 9 and11
[53:20] for the children not being yet born
[53:22] neither having done any good or evil
[53:24] that the purpose of God according to
[53:27] election might stand not of works but of
[53:30] him that calleth it was said unto her
[53:33] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[53:35] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[53:38] have I hated so the the the the the
[53:40] purpose would come to Jacob or the favor
[53:43] would come to Jacob because of election
[53:46] and it was the favor of God protecting
[53:49] the purpose of God oh my and you wonder
[53:51] why you're have you're not in a
[53:52] premature grave it's been the favor of
[53:55] God protecting the purpose God knew he
[53:58] had a plan for your life that's why he
[54:00] has kept you every step of the way
[54:03] that's why you're not insane that's why
[54:05] you're not in a grave or in a prison
[54:06] cell somewhere the the purpose of God
[54:09] has been protected you remember whenever
[54:11] Daniel was throwing into the lion's den
[54:13] the Bible would tell us that the king
[54:15] would come and seal the he would seal
[54:17] the cave so that the purpose could be
[54:20] fulfilled oh he would seal it and I
[54:22] think my another King has done that in
[54:24] this generation there would be a purpose
[54:27] upon the Earth so God would come and
[54:29] seal the purpose he would pour out the
[54:31] blessing upon the purpose so that it can
[54:35] be fulfilled oh that's why you're
[54:37] standing here today God has come by the
[54:39] brandom to tell us that God is sealed in
[54:42] and the devil is sealed out it's the
[54:44] purpose of God being protected oh my
[54:47] it's the favor of God could you imagine
[54:49] being the woman at the well you know I
[54:51] can imagine she wasn't the only one that
[54:53] was divorced or the only one that was a
[54:55] prostitute and sure there was other ones
[54:57] in that City but she was favored she was
[55:00] elected Jesus would say I have needs to
[55:02] go by Samaria what was that need what
[55:05] was that desire it was the purpose what
[55:08] was that desire it was the election that
[55:10] needed a blessing it was election that
[55:13] needed the favor of God to come back her
[55:16] way so that she could reflect something
[55:18] and here would come Jesus I've got needs
[55:21] to go by that way and Oh my he had a
[55:23] need to come by tonight he had a need to
[55:25] come by this morning because there's a
[55:27] purpose there's an elected seed that
[55:30] needs Another Blessing oh man if you
[55:32] need another blessing don't out or don't
[55:35] don't throw it away and say you know
[55:37] what God don't fill no more God don't
[55:38] bless no more the same God that started
[55:41] you in your journey is going to take you
[55:43] all the way through the same God that
[55:45] filled you at the beginning can refill
[55:48] you tonight God is still pouring out
[55:50] blessings upon the
[55:52] purpose Hallelujah and so what made her
[55:55] so special that God would say I've got
[55:58] needs she was favored and brother
[56:00] Brandon would say this now what did this
[56:02] putting the old scripture with the
[56:04] experience that Jesus was giving to her
[56:06] what did it do it made the Messiah and
[56:09] did you notice quickly her sins were
[56:11] forgiven I love that quickly you don't
[56:14] got to go through Pitt or go through a a
[56:16] five-step program for you to be forgiven
[56:19] quickly her sins were forgiven because
[56:23] at the beginning she was redeemable
[56:25] because she was in God's thinking at the
[56:28] beginning so it redeemed her or brought
[56:31] it back when she saw the express
[56:34] scripture manifested oh I just love that
[56:37] quickly whenever she realized that this
[56:40] is her opportunity this is her favor
[56:43] being poured upon her that would redeem
[56:45] her back to the image that God had in
[56:48] his mind oh Hallelujah so the favor of
[56:51] God would take her flesh and bring forth
[56:54] exploits cuz I I know that it's a simple
[56:57] story but we remember that she would run
[56:59] into the City and would say come see a
[57:01] man and the Bible would say uh would say
[57:04] this here that in John 4:28 then uh the
[57:09] woman left her water poot went into her
[57:11] way into the City and saith to the men
[57:14] come see a man which told me all the
[57:16] things that I ever done is this not the
[57:18] Christ then they went out of the city
[57:21] and came unto him my the men of the city
[57:25] believe the pros
[57:26] could you imagine these men probably
[57:28] couldn't even be seen in a square mile
[57:30] from her their wives wouldn't even let
[57:32] him because they didn't want his
[57:33] reputation being ruined but something
[57:35] changed in this young lady not not not
[57:39] necessarily her flesh or or glow about
[57:42] her but her exploits changed her life
[57:45] started to produce something else they
[57:47] will look at her and would say I know
[57:49] what she used to do but something's
[57:51] different about her oh man if you want a
[57:53] witness be a witness for God be a
[57:55] reflection your friends know what you
[57:57] used to do co-workers know what you used
[57:59] to do how you used to drink you used to
[58:01] cuss you used to do these things but now
[58:03] something different is on the inside of
[58:05] your life don't come see you man oh my
[58:08] if you want to you want to see Soul save
[58:10] let your life witness that there's a
[58:13] resurrection savior there's somebody
[58:15] that can break the chains and the
[58:16] addictions come see a man they realize
[58:20] something had taken place her life was
[58:23] an exploit you see like I said this
[58:25] morning an exploit ain't always some big
[58:27] Supernatural things sometimes exploits
[58:30] are the simple things sometimes exploits
[58:32] is just a mama getting up and preparing
[58:35] preparing a meal for her children
[58:37] raising a paradox sometimes exploits
[58:40] it's just the life being lived you know
[58:42] brother Brandon would would tell the
[58:43] story about the young girl that wore a
[58:45] skirt I believe I I believe she was a
[58:48] waitress and there was a uh a big a big
[58:51] old church across the street from the
[58:53] restaurant and they were all dressed in
[58:55] pants or our shorts I believe and
[58:57] brother Brandon would say her life is
[58:59] condemning them she was she her life was
[59:02] an exploit oh my our lives are exploits
[59:05] you remember that the man that set up
[59:07] the pool of Bethesda where the Brandon
[59:09] would say there was worse cases than
[59:11] what he had and the Bible would tell us
[59:13] the lame was there the halt was there
[59:15] all of these other worst cases was there
[59:18] so you would think if God wanted an
[59:20] exploit if God wanted the profound
[59:22] Miracle he would go to the lame man
[59:24] right he would go to the blind man but
[59:26] brother Brandon would say that this man
[59:28] was just tired this man was just weary
[59:31] he could get up he could walk around he
[59:33] could talk but he was just tired so you
[59:36] would think that God would go to
[59:38] somebody that he could get more Glory
[59:40] out of oh and too many times we think
[59:42] that I don't got much to offer this one
[59:44] has a bigger testimony that one God's
[59:47] working greater over there but what you
[59:49] have just give it to him he's looking
[59:51] for an exploit you would see brother
[59:53] Brandon would tell us that many people
[59:56] think that this man full of compassion
[59:58] talking about Jesus full of compassion
[1:00:01] how come he didn't stop at the others
[1:00:03] and brother Brandon would say many
[1:00:04] people uh uh they they uh they they they
[1:00:07] they misplaced compassion with human
[1:00:10] sympathy he says compassion is doing the
[1:00:13] will of the father and so whenever God
[1:00:16] full of compassion was walking by all of
[1:00:19] the other ones it was the favor coming
[1:00:21] to election oh Hallelujah they had more
[1:00:25] to offer they had more to give but he
[1:00:27] had a purpose he had an elected seed
[1:00:30] that the purpose or the the favor of God
[1:00:33] would come to him oh Hallelujah and the
[1:00:36] favor of God has come the compassion of
[1:00:38] God the will of God has come to your
[1:00:41] life it says you might not have much to
[1:00:43] give you might not have much to offer
[1:00:45] but you've got a
[1:00:47] purpose you've got a purpose it's the
[1:00:49] favor come to your
[1:00:52] life bypassed everybody else and brought
[1:00:55] the favor
[1:00:56] it was the favor of God that will come
[1:00:58] to the the tomb of Lazarus and we say
[1:01:00] Lazarus come forth how come it didn't go
[1:01:03] and say Billy Bob come forth he come for
[1:01:06] Lazarus all right Jim Bob come forth
[1:01:08] Mary Sue come forth he come for Lazarus
[1:01:11] and oh my God come for you this evening
[1:01:13] God Has Come For You in this generation
[1:01:15] it says I know your neighbor might have
[1:01:17] more to give this one might have more to
[1:01:19] give but I've come for you this message
[1:01:21] called your name and brother Brandon
[1:01:23] would tell us how come he would say
[1:01:25] Lazarus come forth because if he would
[1:01:27] have said come forth the whole Cemetery
[1:01:30] would have come forth but he didn't come
[1:01:32] for everybody he come for Lazarus you
[1:01:35] know what what is so incredible about
[1:01:37] the The Story of Lazarus is he just
[1:01:39] restored his identity that he had before
[1:01:42] the fall because we know after he died
[1:01:44] he was known as dead and Jesus would
[1:01:46] call him dead he would say remove the
[1:01:48] stone away from the man of the man that
[1:01:50] is dead he lived among the dead you know
[1:01:52] but once Jesus come and the stone was
[1:01:55] rolled away he didn't say dead man come
[1:01:57] forth he said Lazarus He restored the
[1:02:00] identity that he had before he was dead
[1:02:04] and what what did this message do it
[1:02:06] just restored the identity that you had
[1:02:09] in the mind of God since you was
[1:02:11] redeemable since you was in the mind of
[1:02:13] God the favor of God would come and say
[1:02:16] hey you don't belong in that you don't
[1:02:18] belong in the dump you don't belong in
[1:02:20] the chicken pan I'm bringing you your
[1:02:23] identity oh you was always in the mind
[1:02:25] of God and I'm pouring out the favor
[1:02:28] upon your life oh Hallelujah reveal the
[1:02:32] mystery of God so there can be a people
[1:02:34] know their identity oh we got to know
[1:02:37] who we are but he hasn't just chosen us
[1:02:39] or just predestinated us for anything
[1:02:42] but he poured out his favor so we can
[1:02:45] produce exploits and I read the
[1:02:46] scripture this morning you have not
[1:02:48] chosen me John 15:16 you have not chosen
[1:02:51] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[1:02:53] you that you should go forth and bring
[1:02:56] forth fruit that your fruit should
[1:02:58] remain that whatsoever you ask of my
[1:03:01] father the father in my name he may give
[1:03:04] it to you that your fruit should remain
[1:03:07] so he so Lazarus wasn't just called out
[1:03:09] of the Grave just to stay around the
[1:03:11] graveyard he was called out of the Grave
[1:03:14] to go back to his inheritance could you
[1:03:16] imagine being Lazarus he was in the
[1:03:17] grave for three days and you know he
[1:03:19] would come out of the Grave come into
[1:03:21] his house and could you just imagine
[1:03:23] there's somebody sitting on his couch or
[1:03:25] somebody eating his food and he would
[1:03:27] say hey this is my house and they would
[1:03:29] say no you're dead he would say no I'm
[1:03:31] not dead I'm standing in front of you no
[1:03:34] you are dead now then what would take
[1:03:36] place he would call the authorities and
[1:03:38] get the title deed and would say no my
[1:03:41] name is on the deed I'm standing in
[1:03:43] front of you then the authorities would
[1:03:46] kick him out it was because since his
[1:03:48] identity was restored all of the
[1:03:51] inheritance he had was restored with it
[1:03:54] oh my when this message brought you your
[1:03:56] identity the variety store all of your
[1:03:59] inheritance was given back to you so if
[1:04:02] you see a squatter setting on your peace
[1:04:05] setting on your joy say hey it's mine
[1:04:07] brother Brandon would say call the call
[1:04:09] the authorities when brother Brandon
[1:04:11] would talk about the little cop you
[1:04:13] remember the little cop he says he would
[1:04:14] he was a little scrawny fella that would
[1:04:16] step into the road and blow his whistle
[1:04:18] and he says all those cars would come to
[1:04:20] a stop because behind him was the whole
[1:04:22] city he had the whole police force he
[1:04:24] couldn't stop it but the police force
[1:04:27] could and oh my you might not be able to
[1:04:28] get the enemy out of your joy out of
[1:04:30] your peace but you've got all of Heaven
[1:04:33] back in you up you've got almighty God
[1:04:35] saying hey it's yours it's your
[1:04:38] inheritance oh Hallelujah so God didn't
[1:04:41] just choose us but he appointed he
[1:04:43] appointed to us and that word ordained
[1:04:46] means to appoint or to set so if you you
[1:04:48] have not chosen me but I chosen you and
[1:04:51] set you that you should bring forth
[1:04:53] fruit oh I've set you our placed you or
[1:04:56] adopted you so that you can bring forth
[1:04:59] fruit oh my that your fruit should
[1:05:02] remain you see many people want to
[1:05:04] operate the supernatural but they fail
[1:05:06] to live a life and the Bible would tell
[1:05:08] us in Daniel 1:8 but Daniel purposed in
[1:05:11] his heart that he would not defile
[1:05:13] himself with the portion of the king's
[1:05:15] meat nor with the wine which he drank
[1:05:18] therefore he requested of the prince of
[1:05:21] the Unix that he might not defile
[1:05:23] himself and that I really love that he
[1:05:26] didn't just purpose in his heart but
[1:05:28] then he requested he started making
[1:05:30] changes many people purpose in their
[1:05:32] heart at church but then they go home
[1:05:34] and they lose it but Daniel is he saying
[1:05:37] here I'm going to request he would go to
[1:05:40] the one that was giv him the meat that
[1:05:42] was giving him the wine and would say
[1:05:43] hey no more and I think it's time we
[1:05:45] start doing that amen I'm not going back
[1:05:48] to that land the land of rebellion the
[1:05:50] land of bitterness the land of Gossip
[1:05:52] I'm not going back I'm not just
[1:05:54] requesting I'm purposing ing I'm not
[1:05:56] just purposing I'm requesting I'm making
[1:05:59] changes then the Bible would say now God
[1:06:02] have brought Daniel under favor so once
[1:06:04] there was a purposed heart then the
[1:06:06] favor would be poured upon him then the
[1:06:09] Bible would tell us in Daniel 1:15 at
[1:06:12] the end of the 10 days their
[1:06:13] countenances appeared fairer and fatter
[1:06:16] in flesh than all the children which did
[1:06:19] eat the portion of the king's meat so
[1:06:22] now their flesh was a Vindication what
[1:06:25] Daniel had was the truth oh come on now
[1:06:28] our flesh our life our exploits is a
[1:06:31] Vindication that this message is the
[1:06:34] truth cuz we know that Daniel he would
[1:06:36] go to the the prince of the Unix and
[1:06:38] would say give us 10 days we'll eat our
[1:06:40] own thing drink our own thing and let
[1:06:42] the rest of the boys do do drink and eat
[1:06:45] what you got for him and let our
[1:06:47] countenances determine if we got what we
[1:06:50] have is right and then the Bible saying
[1:06:52] at the end of the 10 days their life
[1:06:55] appear more fairer oh my not just in the
[1:06:58] mind not just in the in the soul but
[1:07:00] their flesh oh my it's a living gospel
[1:07:03] this message is a living thing that can
[1:07:05] come and take a life and transform it
[1:07:08] that the rest of the world can see
[1:07:10] exploits that they can see a life being
[1:07:13] changed the Bible would tell us in
[1:07:15] Matthew 12:35 a good man out of a good
[1:07:18] Treasure of the heart bringeth forth
[1:07:20] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:07:22] evil treasure bringeth forth evil things
[1:07:25] right brother Brandon would say this he
[1:07:28] would say now he has cried out in this
[1:07:30] last age you have the word you have more
[1:07:32] Bibles than ever but what are you but
[1:07:34] you're not doing anything about the word
[1:07:37] except dividing it hacking it into
[1:07:39] pieces taking what you want leaving what
[1:07:41] you don't want you're are not interested
[1:07:43] in living it he's talking to the church
[1:07:46] world that you have this you have that
[1:07:48] all you're doing is dividing it you're
[1:07:49] not interested in living it but I don't
[1:07:52] believe that's our attitude we're not
[1:07:54] just hacking it in the pieces we're not
[1:07:56] just arguing but we are interested in
[1:07:58] living it we don't want this word we're
[1:08:00] not we're not getting in the tapes to
[1:08:02] argue we're not getting in the tapes to
[1:08:04] debate we're getting in the tapes to
[1:08:06] live it God I want a reflection upon the
[1:08:09] Earth and my life and you see the favor
[1:08:11] of God wasn't just lift Daniel up but
[1:08:14] for exploits to be in his inside of his
[1:08:17] flesh and you see the Bible would tell
[1:08:19] us of 1 Peter 2 and9 but ye are a chosen
[1:08:22] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:08:24] nation A peculiar people that you should
[1:08:27] show forth the Praises of him who ha
[1:08:30] called you out of Darkness into
[1:08:32] Marvelous Light and I like how scoffield
[1:08:35] puts it he describes Praises as virtues
[1:08:39] oh my and that really done my heart good
[1:08:41] uh you you should show forth the virtues
[1:08:43] of the one who hath called you and so
[1:08:46] the very life of God we are shining
[1:08:49] forth since God has called us there's a
[1:08:52] life on the inside that way you're
[1:08:54] manifesting he called us to shine forth
[1:08:56] the virtues or excellencies of God
[1:08:59] himself and brother Brandon would say
[1:09:01] what he is she is to manifest he would
[1:09:04] he would say this here the True Church
[1:09:06] of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to
[1:09:09] pure gold her righteousness is his
[1:09:11] righteousness her attributes or his own
[1:09:14] glorious attributes her identity is
[1:09:17] found in him what he is she is to
[1:09:20] reflect what he has she is to manifest
[1:09:24] there is no fault in her she is all
[1:09:26] glorious within and without from
[1:09:28] beginning to ending she is the work of
[1:09:31] her Lord and all of his works are
[1:09:33] perfect oh all of his works are perfect
[1:09:37] and he's one the start of the work in
[1:09:39] your life he's going to be faithful to
[1:09:41] complete it God is going to have a
[1:09:43] masterpiece prde upon the Earth the
[1:09:46] devil may try to Mar it he may try to
[1:09:48] bring it down but since God has a
[1:09:50] purpose the favor of God is bringing it
[1:09:53] to pass we are just expressing his
[1:09:56] virtues and we would see that Abraham
[1:09:58] would just be a reflection to what deity
[1:10:01] can do we know Adam had already fallen
[1:10:04] the Covenant between God and man was
[1:10:05] broken so when God would come to Abraham
[1:10:08] he went to make a covenant with God and
[1:10:11] in God in Abraham he would make a
[1:10:13] covenant with himself and like I read
[1:10:15] the quote this morning that God would
[1:10:17] call Abraham by his grace not what you
[1:10:20] can do Abraham but what I can do but we
[1:10:23] see that the blessing could not come the
[1:10:25] past until Abram had a name change and
[1:10:28] what was so special about the name
[1:10:30] change it was deity picking up Fallen
[1:10:33] man and reflecting himself through it
[1:10:36] cuz we know brother Brandon would tell
[1:10:37] us the children was supposed to come by
[1:10:39] the spoken word right in the beginning
[1:10:41] but because of the Fall it's no longer
[1:10:44] the spoken word but now it's by sex and
[1:10:46] the reason of this the Fallen condition
[1:10:49] is the reason they couldn't have
[1:10:51] children but here God would come to a
[1:10:53] cursed human being the wouldn't have
[1:10:55] children and turn the curse into a
[1:10:58] blessing so that in his flesh somebody
[1:11:01] that could not produce it could be a
[1:11:03] reflection oh my that's why God has come
[1:11:06] to humanity that in themselves could not
[1:11:08] be good in themselves could not produce
[1:11:10] the word he would come to a fallen
[1:11:13] Humanity pour out his favor pour out
[1:11:16] himself to that generation so there
[1:11:18] could be a reflection oh the Bible would
[1:11:21] say how be it our God has turned the
[1:11:23] curse into a blessing and we would know
[1:11:26] what would happen where the Brandon
[1:11:27] would tell us that Elohim God would take
[1:11:29] the last letters of Elohim and would put
[1:11:32] it onto Abraham so now onto Abram so no
[1:11:35] longer was it Abram the man now it's
[1:11:38] Elohim God coming to Abram the man so
[1:11:41] now it's God coming to it's deity coming
[1:11:44] to humanity to produce a reflection oh
[1:11:48] my brother brandom says it was a portion
[1:11:50] of Elohim so if a portion of Elohim
[1:11:54] could produce a body Chang what about
[1:11:56] the fullness oh come on now a portion of
[1:11:59] Elohim would show him Jehovah Gyra a
[1:12:02] portion of Elohim would change his body
[1:12:04] a portion of Elohim would bring the
[1:12:07] promised child what about all of God but
[1:12:09] the Brandon would say all that was in
[1:12:11] God was in Christ all that was in Christ
[1:12:14] he pours into the church we haven't just
[1:12:16] got a portion of God all that God has
[1:12:19] been poured out upon this church I say
[1:12:22] there should be Reflections when we go
[1:12:24] to work it's a reflection when we go to
[1:12:26] school it's a reflection if we're in the
[1:12:28] kitchen it's a reflection if we're
[1:12:30] taking our our children to school it's a
[1:12:32] reflection it's deity coming inside of
[1:12:36] humanity oh Hallelujah somebody knows
[1:12:39] their God and they producing
[1:12:41] exploits oh brother the Brandon would
[1:12:43] say then he changed his name from Abram
[1:12:45] to
[1:12:45] Abraham he would say and hm was a part
[1:12:48] of God's name did you notice that did it
[1:12:51] ever soak down in it Abram Elohim see he
[1:12:54] put a part of God 's name because God is
[1:12:56] the father of all he made his name being
[1:12:59] Elohim he put a part of his name with
[1:13:02] Abram Abraham see he made him a partner
[1:13:05] with him through his seed he would bring
[1:13:08] forth a seed and will and bless every
[1:13:10] nation in the earth he'll be the father
[1:13:13] of many nations and I'll get this part
[1:13:15] Abraham would reproduce the faith of
[1:13:18] Elohim Abraham would reproduce the faith
[1:13:22] of Elohim in other words what God was
[1:13:25] producing Abraham now would produce oh
[1:13:29] come on now just like God is the word
[1:13:31] now we're producing the word in the
[1:13:33] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:13:35] God and the word and the Word was with
[1:13:37] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:13:39] dwelt Among Us there's another body upon
[1:13:42] earth that is producing the word and
[1:13:45] brother Brandon would say just like and
[1:13:47] just like the bridegroom was the word so
[1:13:49] must the bride be the word we're
[1:13:51] reproducing the same things that God
[1:13:54] produced
[1:13:56] oh Hallelujah it was after the blessing
[1:13:59] and brother Brandon would say that
[1:14:01] whenever Michelangelo would get a
[1:14:03] sculpture and build a sculpture he would
[1:14:05] strike the knee and would say speak and
[1:14:08] brother Brandon would say there was
[1:14:10] nothing in that's in inside of that
[1:14:12] sculpture to speak but then he would say
[1:14:14] God didn't God want to do that he would
[1:14:16] step into the Masterpiece and would say
[1:14:19] Speak oh Hallelujah he didn't just
[1:14:21] create you and would say hey do this do
[1:14:24] that keep my Commandments keep my word
[1:14:26] produce the Rapture he would say no I've
[1:14:28] got you on earth now I'm stepping into
[1:14:31] you to produce the supernatural it ain't
[1:14:34] you producing the supernatural it's
[1:14:36] deity inside of humanity producing the
[1:14:39] resurrection sign oh hallelujah it's
[1:14:42] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:14:45] and forever in a fallen human being that
[1:14:48] has been lifted up by the favor of God
[1:14:50] oh hallelujah it's a mama that fights
[1:14:53] mind battles fights headaches it's the
[1:14:55] Dy that has back pain the goost to work
[1:14:57] but deities inside of that body
[1:14:59] producing the
[1:15:01] supernatural oh Hallelujah God has
[1:15:04] stepped into this bride the Bible would
[1:15:06] say in 1 Peter 3:9 not rendering evil
[1:15:09] for evil or reing for reing but contris
[1:15:12] blessing knowing that you were there
[1:15:14] unto called that you should inherit a
[1:15:17] blessing we're called to inherit the
[1:15:20] blessing so the same blessing that
[1:15:23] Abraham had in portion we have in
[1:15:25] fullness oh come on now the same
[1:15:29] blessing he had on portion we have in
[1:15:31] fullness now you may say what's that
[1:15:33] what are you talking about brother Josh
[1:15:35] brother Brandon would tell us if you go
[1:15:37] to the ocean and take a cup with you he
[1:15:39] says if you dip it in the ocean you
[1:15:41] don't have all of the ocean but
[1:15:43] everything the ocean has is in that cup
[1:15:46] and brother Brandon would tell us what
[1:15:48] Jesus had in fullness we have in portion
[1:15:51] but all that he had is in this bride oh
[1:15:55] every aspect every Power every word is
[1:15:57] in the bride oh Hallelujah so we are
[1:16:01] called to inherit the portion that God
[1:16:04] has in this generation oh I say it's my
[1:16:07] inheritance to have a Revival it's my
[1:16:09] inheritance to see my children saved
[1:16:12] it's my inheritance to see the church in
[1:16:14] Revival I'm claiming it I'm going to
[1:16:16] arise and walk through the inheritance
[1:16:19] that God has given me this ain't time to
[1:16:21] lay the word down it's time to pick it
[1:16:23] up and see what God has has given us oh
[1:16:27] the Bible Will Tell Us in Isaiah 65 and8
[1:16:29] thus sayeth the Lord as the new wine is
[1:16:31] found in the cluster and one sayith
[1:16:33] destroy it not for a blessing is in it
[1:16:37] and we know that the new wine is the
[1:16:38] type of the Holy Ghost for the brand
[1:16:40] tell us the body of Christ is one Spirit
[1:16:43] where every member from Pentecost to
[1:16:45] this time drinks of the same new wine
[1:16:48] the same Holy Ghost bringing forth the
[1:16:50] same results so the the Bible tells us
[1:16:53] destroy not the new wine for inside of
[1:16:56] it is the blessing oh but the Bible
[1:16:58] would tell us touch not the oil or the
[1:17:01] wine but the Brandon would say the the
[1:17:03] wine is the the Holy Ghost and oil and
[1:17:05] oil is stimulation of Revelation I might
[1:17:07] have got that backwards but you see he's
[1:17:10] saying it for reason don't touch it
[1:17:12] because there's a blessing inside of it
[1:17:14] oh you can't the devil can do what he
[1:17:16] want he can bring discouragement but he
[1:17:18] cannot touch the new wine he cannot
[1:17:21] touch the blessing he can bring
[1:17:22] discouragement he can bring mind battles
[1:17:24] he can bring aches and pains but there's
[1:17:26] a blessing that is reserved to the elect
[1:17:29] that the devil has no right to get into
[1:17:32] hallelujah it's deity stepping into
[1:17:35] humanity and brother brandham talks
[1:17:37] about the picture and he would say the
[1:17:39] negative has begun has become the
[1:17:41] positive and he says our life here is in
[1:17:44] a negative form but there's a positive
[1:17:46] somewhere there can't be a negative
[1:17:49] without the positive oh but he says now
[1:17:51] the negative has become the positive our
[1:17:54] life has taken on the image of what God
[1:17:57] had in his mind and he would say this
[1:17:59] here so when so when we see so when we
[1:18:01] see that our life is here in in the
[1:18:04] negative and knowing that we are an
[1:18:06] image of some life somewhere else then
[1:18:08] we know that there is a positive
[1:18:11] somewhere that the light has struck and
[1:18:13] it's reflected something on the earth
[1:18:16] and we are only that reflection the
[1:18:18] genuine object is somewhere if that is
[1:18:21] that I'm a worst deceived man in the
[1:18:22] world I've spent my life in vain but I
[1:18:25] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[1:18:27] it is here that's why we are here what
[1:18:30] is the positive it's the word coming to
[1:18:32] a bride and reflecting itself oh the the
[1:18:36] bride and the groom has come together
[1:18:38] and is producing the life of the word
[1:18:41] brother Brandon going say this now if
[1:18:42] those are the attributes of God we
[1:18:45] cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by
[1:18:47] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:18:49] word because the Bride is a part of the
[1:18:51] bridegroom like any wife is a part of
[1:18:54] her husband therefore must that must be
[1:18:57] the word bride and what is that word
[1:18:59] bride the manifestation of the hour
[1:19:02] that's what the word bride means is the
[1:19:05] manifestation of the word in the season
[1:19:08] that it is alloted you see Mary was just
[1:19:10] a body for that word to be produced
[1:19:13] through and we're just a body for the
[1:19:15] word of God to be produced through so
[1:19:18] God has taken a body that is under a
[1:19:20] curse and has turned it into a blessing
[1:19:23] oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[1:19:25] the days of Miracles are passed he says
[1:19:27] let them prove it and I love how he says
[1:19:29] that let them prove it he says not what
[1:19:32] you call a super race what God calls a
[1:19:34] super race he says what is the super
[1:19:36] race he says it's uh because they got
[1:19:39] what a supernatural power with
[1:19:41] Supernatural signs through a
[1:19:43] supernatural belief in a supernatural
[1:19:45] word from a supernatural God he says you
[1:19:48] talk about super Supernatural God in a
[1:19:50] supernatural body in a natural people
[1:19:53] giving Supernatural signs he says yes a
[1:19:56] super race they that know their God
[1:19:58] shall do exploits great exploits and
[1:20:01] show Supernatural signs of people oh my
[1:20:06] Supernatural signs of people what is a
[1:20:08] supernatural sign well the Brandon would
[1:20:10] say the greatest Miracle is the life
[1:20:12] being
[1:20:13] transformed well I'm not doing away with
[1:20:15] Miracles I'm just saying too many people
[1:20:17] look for them and Fa to see that you are
[1:20:19] a miracle you get up in the morning
[1:20:21] you're a miracle you got a sound mind
[1:20:24] you're a miracle
[1:20:25] you got your children sitting on a front
[1:20:26] Pew it's a miracle don't mistake the big
[1:20:30] things brother BR I'm going to say this
[1:20:31] here this is just ordinary Indian paper
[1:20:33] but what it's but it's what is on it
[1:20:35] it's God's letter and God's it's God's
[1:20:37] letter form yes sometimes and it's no
[1:20:40] matter how little it is that's where
[1:20:42] people make our mistake we're always
[1:20:44] wanting to do something big but maybe we
[1:20:46] wasn't ordained to do something big come
[1:20:49] on now maybe you wasn't ordained to cast
[1:20:52] Devils out maybe you wasn't ordained to
[1:20:54] speak speaking tongues maybe you wasn't
[1:20:56] ordained to see Visions but God has
[1:20:58] ordained you to live a life and the
[1:21:01] supernatural would come through that
[1:21:04] life oh Hallelujah the Supernatural is
[1:21:07] going to come through that life let our
[1:21:09] musicians come this evening I like how
[1:21:12] the the Bible would say in Romans 11:3
[1:21:14] Lord is talking about Elijah Lord they
[1:21:16] have killed thy prophets and dig down th
[1:21:19] altars and I am left alone and they seek
[1:21:21] my life but what saith the answer of God
[1:21:24] unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000
[1:21:28] men who have not bowed the knee to bail
[1:21:31] even so then at this present time there
[1:21:34] was also a Remnant according to the
[1:21:36] election of Grace oh I love that cuz
[1:21:39] here was a prophet that was saying you
[1:21:42] know there's not going to be rain nor
[1:21:43] due till I call for it he was producing
[1:21:45] the Supernatural and he says Lord Am I
[1:21:47] by myself am I the only one that the
[1:21:49] Supernatural is operating through and he
[1:21:51] would say no I've got 7,000 they may not
[1:21:54] be like you but they haven't bowed their
[1:21:55] knee oh they haven't bowed their knee
[1:21:58] they still got exploits they might not
[1:22:00] be speaking the word like you are they
[1:22:02] might not be seeing visions like you are
[1:22:05] but they have not bowed their knee and
[1:22:07] if you haven't bowed your knee to the
[1:22:08] spirits of leoa keep pressing on keep
[1:22:12] pressing on there's exploits in there
[1:22:14] there's exploits every time you fight a
[1:22:16] depression spirit and you get through it
[1:22:18] that's an exploit amen I have reserved
[1:22:21] to myself to myself
[1:22:25] 7,000 who have not bowed their knee oh
[1:22:28] Hallelujah and he's re he's reserved you
[1:22:30] for this time like I said this morning
[1:22:32] about Esther such a time as this he's
[1:22:35] reserved you for such a time as this for
[1:22:38] exploits amen let's bow our heads
[1:22:40] tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father
[1:22:43] Lord we want to thank you for your love
[1:22:45] and your mercy God thank you for your
[1:22:47] spirit Lord thank you for the blessing
[1:22:50] that you've poured out upon this
[1:22:52] generation Lord the favor God you've
[1:22:54] given us Lord just like Abraham you
[1:22:58] would say I'm going to do this I'm going
[1:22:59] to do that but then Thou shalt be a
[1:23:02] blessing Lord he was to reflect what you
[1:23:04] was doing through him and Lord we're
[1:23:07] just a reflection of what you're doing
[1:23:08] in this generation Lord not what we can
[1:23:11] do but what you can do Lord the Bible
[1:23:14] would say the city is exalted because of
[1:23:16] the blessing Lord the reason why we're
[1:23:19] somebody on Earth is because of the
[1:23:20] blessing we're exalted into two Heavenly
[1:23:23] places father
