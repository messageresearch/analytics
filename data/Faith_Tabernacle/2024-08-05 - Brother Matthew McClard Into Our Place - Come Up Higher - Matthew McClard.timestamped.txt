[44:44] know that there's a really a big move

[45:02] internet or pushing play the church is
[45:05] the house of God and uh brother Brandon
[45:08] was very adamant about coming to the
[45:11] house of God meeting with Believers and
[45:14] he was a very big supporter of a

[49:19] Lord and it doesn't go unseen what you

[49:26] you don't get the opportunity to go I
[49:28] know what it's like I I work at

[49:34] do and it's sometimes the Unseen thing
[49:37] how many's ever seen your
[49:39] kidneys how many's ever seen your
[49:42] liver it's the Unseen things that make a
[49:45] body go and without them the body
[49:48] doesn't work the way it's supposed to
[49:50] but it's a prime example of how the body
[49:53] of Jesus Christ a small group can come
[49:54] together and put on a meeting that
[49:57] blesses
[49:59] exponentially it's a Unison and I I just
[50:02] I applaud you I say thank you keep doing
[50:05] it if the Lord carries amen but but just
[50:08] from the bottom of my heart we thank you
[50:10] Lord and I I know sometimes that me

[50:14] something to you but he says thank you
[50:17] too so just B my heart and you know as
[50:20] we before we open the word you know

[52:36] things but you know I'm like Lord I'm
[52:38] going this way so if we go I I got about
[52:40] three or four messages here but they're
[52:41] probably going to all come out at once
[52:43] so that's just how God works when you go
[52:44] out like that and you don't know God has
[52:47] all these things that come to your mind
[52:48] but we're just going to let him have the
[52:49] message this morning it's his message so
[52:52] amen Colossians chapter 1 and we'll
[52:54] start reading in verse 12
[52:58] he says giving thanks unto the father
[53:00] who hath made us meat to be partakers of
[53:02] the inheritance of the Saints and light
[53:05] who Deliver Us From The Power of
[53:07] darkness and hath translated us into his
[53:09] kingdom of his dear son and whom we have
[53:12] Redemption through the blood even the
[53:13] Forgiveness of sins who's the image of
[53:16] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[53:18] creature for by him we're all things

[53:22] Earth visible and invisible whether it
[53:25] be Thrones or dominions or
[53:26] principalities or Powers all things were
[53:29] created by Him and for him he is before
[53:33] all things and by him all things
[53:34] consists he is the head of the body the
[53:38] church who is the beginning of the first
[53:40] one from the dead that in all things he
[53:42] might have preeminence for it pleased
[53:44] the father that in him should all the
[53:46] fullness dwell and having be made peace
[53:49] through the blood of his Christ by him
[53:50] to reconcile all things unto himself by
[53:53] him I say whether be things in Earth or
[53:55] things in heaven
[53:57] how many loves this scripture and you
[54:00] that were sometimes alienated and
[54:02] enemies in your own Bible Wicked Works

[54:08] his flesh for the death I love this to
[54:10] present you
[54:12] holy unblamable
[54:15] unreprovable in his sight if you
[54:17] continue the faith grounded and settled
[54:19] and be not moved away from the hope of
[54:21] the Gospel which you have heard and

[54:43] we'll just we'll let God have his
[54:44] perfect will this morning into our place
[54:48] coming up higher coming up higher amen
[54:52] how many believe we each one have a
[54:54] place and I believe nobody else can take
[54:56] your place amen nobody else can do the
[54:58] job that you can do you say brother Matt
[55:00] but I'm not a preacher no but just as I
[55:02] told you just a minute ago every piece
[55:05] of the body is just as important as the
[55:08] other piece of the body amen you said
[55:09] brother mat I'm just a fingernail well
[55:11] you smash that fingernail one time
[55:13] you'll know how important that piece of
[55:15] the fingernail is why because there it
[55:17] is laying in the middle of the night and
[55:18] it's going boom
[55:21] bo what is it telling you I need help
[55:24] and what's the other part of the body do
[55:26] the other part of the body reaches over
[55:28] and begins to coddle that you know it's
[55:30] okay if you pray for your brother and
[55:31] sister it's okay if you see them hurting
[55:34] it's okay listen that's what the body is
[55:36] supposed to do not go talk about them
[55:38] not go beat them down the body is
[55:40] supposed to get behind them and comfort
[55:42] them the body is supposed to help one
[55:44] another listen this body our place is
[55:47] not to beat one another down come on
[55:49] somebody our place is to talk about them
[55:51] our place is to lift them up into
[55:53] Heavenly places he say brother Matt but
[55:54] they've been there for years yeah but
[55:56] your prayer can move mountains in your
[55:58] brother's life your prayer can change
[56:00] things in your brother life it's time
[56:02] saints of God this body get in a Unison
[56:05] because that is what God wants he don't
[56:07] want preachers fighting against come on
[56:09] somebody he's not pleased with preachers
[56:11] fighting against preachers yes we should
[56:13] stand for this message there's no
[56:15] backing down from this mess if God stood
[56:18] with it then I'm going to be standing
[56:19] with it come on somebody that's the
[56:21] place of a True Believer if God sent a
[56:24] Vindicated word and he stood with it
[56:26] that I'm going to stand in my place

[1:02:39] not what God has called me to he has
[1:02:42] called me to a high calling he's called
[1:02:44] me to think on these
[1:02:46] things he's called me to stay out of the
[1:02:49] things of the world H

[1:04:26] so that you can be free of every doubt
[1:04:28] you can be free from your past come on
[1:04:30] some of you been message Believers
[1:04:31] walking in this message and there's
[1:04:33] still things in the past that hang over
[1:04:34] your life well I'm here to tell you this
[1:04:36] morning you don't have to stay in that
[1:04:38] position there's a blood that cleanses
[1:04:40] there's a blood that wipes free there's
[1:04:41] a voice that speaks over your life and
[1:04:43] says I set you free why would you go
[1:04:46] back to thinking that way come on
[1:04:47] somebody why do you have to think that
[1:04:49] way quit thinking that way that's not
[1:04:53] why I died that's not why I gave the
[1:04:55] Holy Ghost I gave for you to have a pure
[1:05:03] mind listen we got to overcome the devil
[1:05:06] listen the devil's real come on somebody
[1:05:08] the devil's not something fake in fact
[1:05:10] he's right there he's sitting he's a
[1:05:13] front row
[1:05:15] believer he believes but he can't live
[1:05:17] the life
[1:05:19] oh that's the difference he knows more
[1:05:22] than you do
[1:05:26] I know we think we know more because
[1:05:28] we've been that devil knows more than
[1:05:30] you
[1:05:32] do but the devil just doesn't know his
[1:05:34] place yet you got to let him know
[1:05:40] yourself in fact I don't want to clean
[1:05:42] it
[1:05:43] off let me get it good and dirty so you
[1:05:45] know where your place is
[1:05:49] still brother B said this is another
[1:05:51] message but we're going to preach here
[1:05:52] brother said overcoming was recognizing
[1:05:54] the devil and every one of his tricks
[1:05:56] I'm going to give you an example in my
[1:05:57] life cuz I'm just an open book just the
[1:05:59] way we go there was a time in my life
[1:06:01] for like two and a half three years I
[1:06:02] felt like i' done something
[1:06:05] wrong still preaching still going to
[1:06:08] church but this feeling of just
[1:06:11] condemnation you know brother bam had
[1:06:13] the same
[1:06:14] thing he preached the seals under
[1:06:16] that go back to 1965 or 64 when he went
[1:06:20] and took a walk with the Lord dares he
[1:06:22] said he felt like he'd done something
[1:06:23] wrong he said for 2 or 3 years I'd felt
[1:06:25] that way he preached the seals feeling
[1:06:27] that way so don't let the feelings
[1:06:30] determine your position and place in
[1:06:31] Jesus Christ but anyway I'm sitting here
[1:06:34] and I'm trying to study for a message
[1:06:35] and this is over me and
[1:06:37] just nobody ever been there come on
[1:06:40] somebody felt like you done something
[1:06:42] wrong you search your life you look Lord
[1:06:45] I'll make it right
[1:06:49] Lord I'm like Lord I can't even study
[1:06:53] feel like Lord I just can't get into the
[1:06:55] channel I
[1:06:57] get all right make fun of me that's all
[1:07:02] right about that time a brother texted
[1:07:04] me brother Brian Crow he said buddy you
[1:07:07] need to listen to this brother Samuel
[1:07:08] bounty's message I'm not getting
[1:07:10] anywhere okay so I started listening to
[1:07:13] brother Samuel brother Samuel about 15
[1:07:15] minutes in or five minutes in he gives a
[1:07:17] quote from brother Brandon and it's a
[1:07:19] quote there anything too hard for the
[1:07:21] Lord and he says Sarah and Abraham we're
[1:07:24] having a little tiff I said he said that
[1:07:26] what so I turned off brother Samuel and
[1:07:28] I went to the message and right
[1:07:30] underneath where he said
[1:07:33] that he said the devil was trying to
[1:07:37] hold them and tempt them to make them
[1:07:40] feel that they've done something
[1:07:44] wrong and I'll tell you what when I
[1:07:46] recognized it was nothing but a devil
[1:07:48] trying to hold over my life and trying
[1:07:49] to keep me back I tabed myself a a good
[1:07:52] old crying fit right there in my chair
[1:07:54] and then I got mad
[1:07:57] cuz I Satan you no good nothing good for
[1:08:01] nothing I'm going to kick you on it made
[1:08:03] a preacher mad because I thought Lord if
[1:08:06] he's doing that to me he's doing that to
[1:08:09] every member of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:12] cuz if he could just hold you back a
[1:08:13] little bit from confessing the word with
[1:08:15] your mouth oh SS of God there's so much
[1:08:18] power in confessing the word from your
[1:08:20] mouth that I'm Healed I'm sealed I'm
[1:08:23] filled with the Holy Ghost I am a son of
[1:08:25] of God I am a daughter of God I've been
[1:08:28] born again I am a holy ghost filed
[1:08:30] baptized believing Christian I believe

[1:08:49] word has authority over
[1:08:53] you come on somebody
[1:08:59] if I could physically beat him I
[1:09:03] would why because I understand what it
[1:09:07] is recognize it's nothing but a lying
[1:09:12] Spirit straight out of the pits of hell
[1:09:16] and you don't have to listen to it you
[1:09:20] might hear it but address it a lot of
[1:09:23] times we hear it and here's what we

[1:09:32] hand I
[1:09:34] can't I don't want to I can't say Amen
[1:09:37] like that brother
[1:09:40] because that's a devil trying to hide
[1:09:43] you back if the ministry of Christ was
[1:09:45] to set the captives free it's the same
[1:09:48] Ministry this morning it's the same
[1:09:50] Ministry of Christ and a lot of times

[1:09:54] got to come through listen I can't fight
[1:09:56] that battle for you but I'm here to tell

[1:11:44] speaks to you directly don't you give no
[1:11:46] praise to the man of God you praise God

[1:15:56] the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:00] Christ quit making
[1:16:04] excuses quit let somebody else take your
[1:16:07] position it's your place to be there
[1:16:10] it's your place to get down before the
[1:16:12] Lord It's your place to seek God like
[1:16:14] you've never sought God before yes we
[1:16:17] have the opening of the word but are you
[1:16:18] feeding on it like you've never fed on
[1:16:20] it before you need to
[1:16:26] you're not feeding on the words of a man
[1:16:28] you're feeding on the son of man the
[1:16:30] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:16:32] and brother Brandon would tell us he
[1:16:33] said have you fed fully if you've not
[1:16:36] fed fully will you do it now catch the
[1:16:39] next sentence so that you can Fly Above

[1:16:56] action denoted to
[1:16:58] it but the eagle did it was a flying
[1:17:02] eagle why because our place is not

[1:17:55] to the full potential in your
[1:17:59] place I know we get a lot of amens there
[1:18:02] why because God's Wan his bride to grow

[1:18:07] right now under the spoken word there's
[1:18:09] a light that's being shined on you it's
[1:18:11] a supernatural light and the Soul that's
[1:18:13] on the inside of you is coming to full
[1:18:15] maturity that is our place SS of God

[1:18:20] child mind thinking come on we're not to
[1:18:21] have speak childish things come on the
[1:18:23] Bible Paul would talk about that but he
[1:18:25] said then I spoke as a man it's time for
[1:18:28] full maturity in The Bride of Jesus
[1:18:30] Christ though you go through every trial
[1:18:32] though you go through every heartache
[1:18:33] let your head be high and let your mouth
[1:18:36] be confessing the word of God expecting
[1:18:38] God to
[1:18:41] move
[1:18:43] Glory verse

[1:18:59] this
[1:19:01] morning but I'll tell you he did let me
[1:19:04] read you quote here this is so good
[1:19:06] that's a long quote but hold on but oh
[1:19:07] I'd like to say something if I can
[1:19:08] forget what I was remembering what he is
[1:19:11] if I can't remember Jesus if I can
[1:19:13] remember him at the cross if I can
[1:19:15] remember what he done for me and I can
[1:19:16] remember the hour that he washed away my
[1:19:18] sins and give me the holy spirit to
[1:19:20] guide me then I'm lifted above
[1:19:21] everything that holds this Earth I'm
[1:19:23] lifted above every Earthly thing in
[1:19:25] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I
[1:19:27] can follow him there in his presence
[1:19:29] forgetting what I was and forgetting all
[1:19:31] my sins and
[1:19:32] everything sounds like a good place
[1:19:34] doesn't it go
[1:19:36] higher come on somebody get in Heavenly
[1:19:39] places in Christ Jesus where the things
[1:19:41] of the world don't really matter amen

[1:29:16] godall there's power in your
[1:29:18] touch come on somebody you don't know
[1:29:21] who you are if we can speak the word and
[1:29:24] go create a world and go live on it then
[1:29:27] there's something to do with the touch
[1:29:28] of a
[1:29:29] Believer s of
[1:29:32] God that scripture is for
[1:29:35] you I know you've put that on the
[1:29:37] minister and you put that on the prayer
[1:29:39] line but let me put it where brother
[1:29:41] Brandon put it there was a woman up in
[1:29:43] the in the balcony one time and she had
[1:29:45] a feeling for that girl and she had a
[1:29:47] feeling for that girl she let me take
[1:29:48] your seat and she couldn't get rid of
[1:29:50] that feeling listen if you have a
[1:29:52] feeling to pray for somebody then why
[1:29:54] don't you just pray for him I'm not
[1:29:57] trying to condemn her I understand I'm
[1:30:03] nobody God can you use your
[1:30:06] prayers the same as he can
[1:30:11] his come on
[1:30:15] somebody I know devil doesn't like that
[1:30:18] brother B said when somebody begins to
[1:30:19] pray for somebody something begins to
[1:30:20] happen direct quote if you want it I got
[1:30:23] it for you
[1:30:24] so there's an unseen force that begins
[1:30:26] to
[1:30:28] move where was I at praise the Lord amen
[1:30:32] you love
[1:30:35] him something begins to
[1:30:39] happen this word in Mark is for
[1:30:43] you it's time we take this message
[1:30:46] personal it's not just the church we
[1:30:48] come to but this is my message and when
[1:30:53] the message gets in its
[1:30:56] place and it's not just hearing
[1:31:00] it's and then when it gets on the inside
[1:31:03] of you it is going to do some incredible
[1:31:10] things how many's a witness of it how

[1:34:28] be troubled that's a direct quote
[1:34:33] too I know brother your place is in a
[1:34:37] slave mentality you think you can't have
[1:34:38] the blessings of God well I'm here to
[1:34:41] tell you that's not right the truth is
[1:34:45] he wants to bless you more than you can
[1:34:48] handle brother man we talk about taking
[1:34:50] the whole ocean and putting in a 4- foot
[1:34:52] pipe right he said and the pressure
[1:34:54] underneath that if you block that up the
[1:34:55] pressure you know I I I'm not a big
[1:34:57] proponent of AI but I used
[1:35:00] AI what would them take the whole out of
[1:35:04] the earth put in a 4 foot five what
[1:35:06] would the pressure BEC coming I asked AI
[1:35:08] this because I
[1:35:09] didn't and it gave me like 14 pages of
[1:35:13] calculation did I understand any of it
[1:35:16] no at the end it gave a conclusion thank
[1:35:19] goodness there's a
[1:35:20] conclusion basically at every level it
[1:35:23] obliterates
[1:35:24] you there' probably be nothing left of
[1:35:28] you so how much does
[1:35:31] God want to bless you this
[1:35:34] morning I said Lord don't let there be
[1:35:36] anything left to me blow it all out Lord
[1:35:40] and let it be all you Lord Jesus that
[1:35:43] when I leave here Lord my footsteps are
[1:35:45] not just on the ground any longer but
[1:35:47] let it be like Enoch I'm going to walk
[1:35:49] with you hand in hand and then one day
[1:35:51] Lord that footsteps not going to hit
[1:35:53] ground any any longer it's going to take
[1:35:54] a step here and before long it's taking
[1:35:56] a step there and before long they're
[1:35:58] going to be where did he go I don't know
[1:36:00] I know I went to my place where he
[1:36:02] wanted me in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:36:04] Jesus back in the back in the back in
[1:36:07] the condition of Eden
[1:36:12] again can't preach for
[1:36:16] preaching 14 and then we have this verse
[1:36:19] uh let's go drop down to verse Verse 18
[1:36:21] and he is the head of the body of the
[1:36:22] church for the beginning of the play
[1:36:23] firstborn unto all things he might have
[1:36:25] pren brother BR would talk about the
[1:36:26] three4 purpose of God and he would come
[1:36:28] down through there and he would say the
[1:36:30] second purpose is for what the second to
[1:36:32] have pre the first is to express himself
[1:36:34] completely in God in Christ and he
[1:36:37] did the world didn't see it but the
[1:36:41] elect that's him even when they couldn't
[1:36:44] understand it eat my flesh they didn't
[1:36:46] understand it but Lord where am I going
[1:36:48] to go and there might be times you don't

[1:38:59] and just listen to the message brother
[1:39:01] BR said he said everything that happens
[1:39:03] on Earth happens in the heavens first
[1:39:06] the Lord quickened to me the
[1:39:11] cloud what was it it was the head where
[1:39:14] was the body he was coming to
[1:39:17] it the body was on
[1:39:20] Earth brother Ram himself didn't
[1:39:22] recognize it for what it was
[1:39:25] come on somebody a lot of these message
[1:39:27] people don't recognize it for what it
[1:39:28] was until the Holy Ghost says look at it
[1:39:30] right said look turn it to the
[1:39:33] right what do you see it's the head
[1:39:36] coming to the body what does the head do
[1:39:39] it does the thinking amen where's the
[1:39:41] speaking from it's from the head where's
[1:39:43] the vision from it's from the head it's
[1:39:45] all from the head this message is the
[1:39:48] headship of Christ coming down but it
[1:39:51] needs a body that will receive it as the
[1:39:53] headship and not as a thought of a man
[1:39:56] and not as idea and not put your
[1:39:58] thinking with it it is God's word to a
[1:40:02] body that will bring you into your place
