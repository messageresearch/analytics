[48:32] again and um but also uh next Sunday
[48:39] afternoon we'll be having question and
[48:41] answers again so um uh we look forward
[48:45] to that amen and um there there won't be
[48:50] any service this evening but um also um
[48:55] I had just got news uh there in in my
[48:58] office just before I came up of um of a
[49:02] group of Believers in
[49:05] Pakistan and um trying to fix that map
[49:09] but um uh in Pakistan that is about to
[49:13] lose their
[49:15] Church uh Church property they they
[49:17] bought it um uh 13 years ago and um out
[49:24] the Clear Blue uh a Muslim man
[49:27] has um come and U says that he owns that
[49:33] property and uh is wanting them to move
[49:37] and is threaten threatening to bulldoze
[49:40] the building
[49:41] down and uh so they've taken it to the
[49:44] authorities the
[49:46] authorities uh have heard both sides and
[49:49] they they are agreeing with the
[49:52] Believers uh but this this uh man he's
[49:56] um he's he's produced a title and uh
[50:02] saying that it's his but um the the
[50:05] Believers have also produced a title
[50:08] saying that it's theirs and the man that
[50:10] they bought it from is no longer I guess
[50:12] he's either not living or he's well he's
[50:15] just not around so I don't know um and
[50:20] in in them places Muslims have the they
[50:25] Superior
[50:26] it doesn't matter what they say so to
[50:29] speak and so but the uh the authorities
[50:32] had told this man that he's going to
[50:35] have to U negotiate with the Believers
[50:38] and so he is demanding uh
[50:41] $99,000 they've got to have
[50:44] $99,000 and um actually they've got to
[50:48] have it in four
[50:49] days and um so brother uh I guess
[50:54] brother Hughes was up there and so
[50:58] brother Wayne had asked him to check all
[51:02] the
[51:03] documents and uh to make sure
[51:05] everything's legit and
[51:08] um um you know with the church's
[51:11] documents and things like that and um uh
[51:14] brother Hugh sent back a video saying it
[51:18] is it is legit the church does have a
[51:22] legit um
[51:24] standing and they are not
[51:27] this isn't a scam this isn't something
[51:29] just to get money whatever everything
[51:32] they brother Hughes has found is is
[51:34] right on and so if if you all would uh
[51:39] like to help in that way if anyone would
[51:42] like to help to give money um um you
[51:47] could give it to brother Tim and uh we
[51:50] we can get it sent uh over and uh try to
[51:56] help um I know we're a small church but
[51:59] uh think anything would help at this
[52:01] point and there's other churches of
[52:03] course that U uh I'm sure hopefully will
[52:08] uh help out in this situation and um
[52:12] we're we're we're blessed to have what
[52:14] we have here and um I I feel sorry
[52:18] for well for the the the people there
[52:21] and so I would love to help as much as
[52:24] we can and so anyway if you would like
[52:27] to give you've got something to give uh
[52:30] you can give it to brother Tim and um
[52:33] we'll make sure that they get it amen
[52:36] you love the Lord amen amen uh before we
[52:40] go into the word may we just bow our
[52:42] heads and uh just talk to our Lord
[52:49] father we're so glad to be called your
[52:53] children and we enter into this place
[52:56] with
[52:57] Thanksgiving and to your courts with

[53:17] future and Lord we know that our future
[53:20] is in your hands our life is in your

[53:33] prayers now father we just ask that you
[53:36] would come and meet with us today Lord
[53:39] that you would speak to us Lord through
[53:41] your word for father your word is
[53:45] creative no matter what the situation we
[53:49] may be going through or the mountain
[53:52] that we're facing your word Lord is the
[53:55] superiority over at all and I just pray
[53:58] father that you would anoint me and Lord

[54:12] your people today Lord we just give it
[54:16] all to you now and just ask that you
[54:18] would bless that group of Believers
[54:20] there in that country and that you would
[54:23] provide for them Father Lord we thank
[54:26] you in Jesus Christ's name and the
[54:29] church
[54:30] says amen and
[54:33] amen um so we want to look at Psalms the
[54:37] 46th
[54:38] chapter and um the first verse it says
[54:42] God is our
[54:44] refuge and strength a very present help
[54:47] and trouble therefore will not we
[54:52] fear uh though the Earth be removed
[54:54] though the mountains be carried into the
[54:57] midst of the sea though the waters
[54:59] thereof Roar and be troubled though the
[55:02] mountains shake with the swelling
[55:04] thereof
[55:06] Sal um there is a river the streams
[55:09] whereof it shall make glad the city of
[55:11] God and the Holy place of the
[55:14] Tabernacles of the most high God is in
[55:18] the midst of her she shall not be moved
[55:21] God shall help her and that right early
[55:25] in other words he'll help her in the
[55:28] dawning of the day amen then if you'll
[55:32] turn to the uh 62nd chapter Psalm
[55:37] 62 and um we'll look at the uh first
[55:43] verse there amen Psalms uh 62 and 1
[55:49] truly my soul waiteth upon God from him
[55:53] cometh my salvation
[55:56] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[55:59] is my defense I shall not be greatly
[56:03] moved then go down to the sixth verse he
[56:06] only is my rock and my salvation he is
[56:09] my defense I shall not be moved in God
[56:14] is my salvation and my glory the rock of
[56:18] my strength and my
[56:21] refuge is in God trust in him at all
[56:26] times ye people pour out your heart
[56:28] before him God is a refuge for us salom
[56:34] amen you can have your seats this
[56:38] morning and
[56:40] um I'm again going to use the title he's
[56:44] a present help in
[56:48] trouble and if you notice
[56:52] um David says he only is my raw walk and
[56:57] my
[57:00] salvation and the the prophet says that
[57:03] one one Christian can represent all
[57:07] believers one one Christian in the Bible
[57:10] and so uh we we look at that David then
[57:15] would represent all believers of all
[57:19] ages and uh this is exactly how every
[57:23] believer feels toward God he only is my
[57:28] rock and my
[57:31] salvation now we
[57:34] uh we don't serve the Lord because it's
[57:38] just the family way of doing it uh we
[57:43] don't serve him uh you know well we
[57:48] don't serve him to escape hell
[57:50] even um we we uh
[57:54] Christianity isn't just
[57:56] uh something that we put in our busy
[58:00] schedule along with everything else and
[58:03] and then you know if if we're just
[58:06] getting too busy then we just scratch
[58:08] that part out and and uh that that's
[58:12] that's not uh the way Believers serve
[58:16] God but uh as as we read there uh every
[58:21] believer fulfills what the psalmist said
[58:24] trust trust trust in him at all times
[58:28] trust in him at all times and so uh it
[58:33] is the way of a Believer to seek God for
[58:36] help amen that's just the way the
[58:39] believer is uh Psalm 70 And1 it says
[58:43] make haste oh God to deliver me make
[58:46] haste to help me oh Lord in the fifth
[58:49] verse I am poor and needy make haste
[58:52] unto me oh God Thou Art my help and my
[58:56] deliverer oh Lord make no tearing and so
[58:59] this is this is why prayer is such an
[59:04] vital part important part to the
[59:06] believer is because we we realize that
[59:10] God Alone is our Rock and our
[59:14] Salvation it's it's just something there
[59:17] and the reason why we hold to him at God
[59:21] uh more than anything else is because we
[59:25] believe in the
[59:26] Supernatural and and we know that God is
[59:29] Supernatural and and his actions are
[59:32] Supernatural and and so we we know that
[59:36] when we're up against the wall uh we we
[59:40] don't despair we we don't fall apart
[59:43] because we believe that God we just
[59:45] believe in the Supernatural and so we
[59:48] cry unto him to work in the Supernatural
[59:51] now in in 2
[59:54] Chronicles uh the 14 th chapter the 11th
[59:57] verse the enemy came in against King ASA
[1:00:01] a man uh which was um I believe King
[1:00:05] over Israel or or Judah or uh uh uh but
[1:00:10] he was King there and and the enemy had
[1:00:13] come against him to destroy him and and
[1:00:17] in the 11th verse there it says and ASA
[1:00:20] Cried unto the Lord his God and said
[1:00:23] Lord it is nothing with thee to help I I
[1:00:28] think that's the right approach when we
[1:00:30] when we're asking God for help it's it's
[1:00:33] it's nothing with you to help uh whether
[1:00:36] with many or with them that have no
[1:00:40] power help us oh Lord Our God for we
[1:00:44] rest on thee how many's resting on him
[1:00:47] amen we we rest on thee and in thy name
[1:00:51] we go against this multitude oh Lord
[1:00:55] Thou Art Our God let no man Prevail
[1:01:00] against thee let not man Prevail against
[1:01:03] thee and and so what this this is the
[1:01:06] approach that every believer has toward
[1:01:09] God it's not blame it's not God why are
[1:01:11] you allowing this to happen to me and
[1:01:14] and why do I have to go through this and
[1:01:16] God look look look where I'm at and and
[1:01:19] I just I don't understand you're just
[1:01:21] not fair and and all of these things but
[1:01:24] but but the believer just looks at God
[1:01:26] and says God I need your help it's it's
[1:01:29] just common that we go through things
[1:01:31] it's human that that we Face things but
[1:01:35] but but the believer knows where to go
[1:01:38] for help amen and to cry out too as I
[1:01:42] have stated you know uh we are living in
[1:01:45] in the time of of trouble there is
[1:01:48] trouble on every hand and and um the the
[1:01:52] trouble that I'm not speaking or the
[1:01:54] yeah that I'm speaking of is is is not
[1:01:58] the trouble that we go through in maybe
[1:02:00] in our personal lives of maybe like your
[1:02:04] your your car breaking down or uh uh you
[1:02:08] know you needing money to to to pay the
[1:02:10] light bill or or or uh needing a job or
[1:02:14] whatever that that's not the trouble
[1:02:16] that I'm talking about now now we've all
[1:02:19] we all have our personal troubles that
[1:02:21] we go through and and uh there there's
[1:02:24] been people in need um ever ever since
[1:02:29] uh man fell into sin uh people have uh
[1:02:33] experienc needs in their life and and
[1:02:36] God's people has had times of trouble to
[1:02:39] where they needed God uh to heal them
[1:02:42] they needed God to protect them from
[1:02:45] danger they needed God to come on the
[1:02:48] scene and and and provide the need or uh
[1:02:51] uh uh heal them from a dead deadly
[1:02:54] disease or or or whatever and and and
[1:02:58] God has always been a a help in the time
[1:03:01] of our trouble our personal trouble uh
[1:03:04] that we've gone through and I I thinking
[1:03:08] of a of a young man there in the Old
[1:03:11] Testament uh who had borrowed an axe uh
[1:03:14] from his neighbor a friend and and uh he
[1:03:17] needed it to to chop some wood and and
[1:03:20] he was there by the the Jordan River and
[1:03:23] and as he began to chop he was swinging
[1:03:25] at a and the ax said uh the Bible says
[1:03:29] it was made out of iron and and it it it
[1:03:32] flew off the handle and went in the
[1:03:34] river and and sunk to the bottom and and
[1:03:37] the young man he he began you know to to
[1:03:40] panic cuz he had borrowed the axe and
[1:03:43] and so he had went to the man of God to
[1:03:46] to find help in the in the time of
[1:03:48] trouble for he knew that the word of the
[1:03:50] Lord come to the prophet and that God
[1:03:52] was with that Prophet the Supernatural
[1:03:55] and and and the Bible says that the
[1:03:58] Prophet come and and uh and and I I
[1:04:02] can't remember everything that happened
[1:04:04] but I do know this that the Bible says
[1:04:07] that God caused that AED to swim amen it
[1:04:11] swam to the shore now you know that's
[1:04:14] God being a help in the time of trouble
[1:04:17] amen and you may have not had such a
[1:04:19] thing like that but but God has been
[1:04:22] your help God has been my help in the
[1:04:25] time of trouble we we have no reason to
[1:04:28] complain about life we we have no reason
[1:04:30] to Grumble about the things that we go
[1:04:32] through because if we stop and we look
[1:04:35] at it every situation in that we've gone
[1:04:38] through you couldn't be here today if it
[1:04:41] had not been for the grace of God to
[1:04:43] help you in the time of trouble amen and
[1:04:46] so often we forget about these things
[1:04:49] that that that God has but every
[1:04:51] believer has a testimony of God moving
[1:04:55] on the scene for them in some way or
[1:04:57] another and and and to be honest uh uh
[1:05:01] God has been a help to the unbeliever as
[1:05:04] well amen every morning they get up amen
[1:05:07] God gives them breath God gives them a
[1:05:10] heartbeat God gives them that chance to
[1:05:13] serve him God gives him that them that
[1:05:16] chance He blesses them sometimes we look
[1:05:19] at it and think man the unbeliever has
[1:05:22] has far greater uh uh uh blessings
[1:05:26] well you know than than what we have but
[1:05:28] in that day they'll be without excuse on
[1:05:31] that day amen because God has been good
[1:05:34] amen to both unbeliever and the believer
[1:05:36] ain't that right amen but the unbeliever
[1:05:39] won't acknowledge that they but but we
[1:05:42] as Believers realize that God Alone is
[1:05:45] our Rock and he is our our Salvation
[1:05:49] amen see but so so we all go through the
[1:05:52] time of trouble and God has been a help
[1:05:55] but the time of trouble that I'm
[1:05:57] speaking of is of course the Great
[1:05:59] Tribulation that is is uh uh soon at
[1:06:03] hand and and you know uh we've talked
[1:06:06] about it but the prophets uh uh uh David
[1:06:10] and and Daniel for told of this time of
[1:06:13] trouble uh there in in Daniel
[1:06:16] 121 uh at that time shall Michael now we
[1:06:19] know Michael uh is Christ it's uh it's
[1:06:23] it's he's he's Christ and Michael shall
[1:06:26] stand up the great Prince uh which
[1:06:30] standeth for the people of thy children
[1:06:32] and there shall be a time of trouble
[1:06:35] such as never was since there was a
[1:06:38] nation even to that same time and at
[1:06:41] that time thy people shall be delivered
[1:06:46] everyone that shall be found written in
[1:06:49] the book amen now now I believe that
[1:06:53] this is tied to re Gans 10:1 the mighty
[1:06:57] Angel amen coming down with an open book
[1:07:02] in his hand and the prophet said that
[1:07:04] angel is none other than Christ himself
[1:07:08] and he comes to claim his redeemed he
[1:07:12] comes to claim his redeemed and and and
[1:07:15] and that Redemption claim is a
[1:07:19] Deliverance do you believe that I I it's
[1:07:22] not just to make us church members it's
[1:07:25] it it it's not to give us a a religious
[1:07:28] feeling but this Redemption claim is a
[1:07:32] Deliverance he comes to deliver everyone
[1:07:37] that is found written in the book the
[1:07:39] Lamb's Book of Life amen now we read
[1:07:44] this uh last Sunday I believe but
[1:07:46] Ezekiel
[1:07:47] 34:12 as a Shepherd seeketh out his
[1:07:50] flock in the day that he is among his
[1:07:53] sheep that are scattered so will I seek
[1:07:56] out my Sheep amen and will deliver them
[1:08:01] amen and think of that the shepherd
[1:08:02] seeketh out his flock in the day that he
[1:08:06] is among his sheep see that are
[1:08:08] scattered so will I amen I come amongst
[1:08:12] them I'll seek out my sheep and deliver
[1:08:16] them out of all places where they have
[1:08:18] been scattered in the Cloudy and dark
[1:08:20] day now the prophet said God today is
[1:08:23] not going to deliver his people by
[1:08:24] education
[1:08:26] he never promised to do that he's not
[1:08:28] going to deliver them by theology never
[1:08:30] promised to do that he's not going to
[1:08:32] deliver them by science he never
[1:08:33] promised to do it he's not going to
[1:08:35] deliver them by denomination he never
[1:08:38] promised to do that but he will deliver
[1:08:41] them by the power Supernatural power of
[1:08:45] changing their lives and molding them
[1:08:48] into Sons or children of God Amen so
[1:08:52] everyone found written in the book amen
[1:08:56] that Lamb's Book will be delivered now
[1:09:00] you know David also foretold of this
[1:09:03] time of trouble amen we've read it
[1:09:05] psalms 27 And1 the Lord is my light and
[1:09:09] my salvation Whom Shall I Fear amen see
[1:09:13] when when the Lord is your light he's
[1:09:15] your salvation when he's your rock there
[1:09:18] there's there's no no no reason to fear
[1:09:20] see and and and how different that is
[1:09:23] with the believer and the world for for
[1:09:25] we see that fear is gripping the world
[1:09:28] but but I shall not fear for for the
[1:09:31] Lord is my light the Lord is my
[1:09:33] salvation he only is my rock a ain't
[1:09:36] that right see the Lord is the strength
[1:09:38] of my life he's the preserver of my life
[1:09:42] of whom shall I be afraid when the
[1:09:44] wicked even my enemies my foes Came Upon
[1:09:48] me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[1:09:50] fell though and ho should encamp against
[1:09:54] me my heart shall not fear though War
[1:09:58] should rise against me in this will I be
[1:10:01] confident one thing if I desired of the
[1:10:04] Lord that will I seek after that I may
[1:10:07] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:10:10] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[1:10:13] the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in
[1:10:16] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[1:10:19] his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:10:22] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:10:26] me up on a rock ain't that right so
[1:10:30] again brother brandham used that
[1:10:31] scripture to build his thought uh when
[1:10:34] he preached uh the message the Rapture
[1:10:37] amen and and so then we find that God
[1:10:40] even mentions the time of trouble amen
[1:10:44] uh to job uh telling him that he had
[1:10:47] reserved the Treasures of the hail
[1:10:51] against the time of trouble against the
[1:10:54] day of battle and War amen see so God
[1:10:58] even foretold of this time of trouble
[1:11:02] that is at hand but again the Believers
[1:11:05] don't have to fear for the Lord is a
[1:11:10] help in time of trouble now uh if you
[1:11:14] look and I've got a lot of scriptures
[1:11:16] this morning so you bear with
[1:11:18] me but um and I think it would be good
[1:11:21] just to study them out uh uh in in your
[1:11:25] daily devotion but uh Psalms 37 and 37
[1:11:29] Mark the perfect man behold the upright
[1:11:32] for the end of that man is peace can you
[1:11:37] say Amen think of that no wonder you
[1:11:39] don't have to fear the end of this man
[1:11:41] the perfect man that upright man and
[1:11:44] it's not the perfect man in his moral uh
[1:11:48] uh uh duties or uh standards or or
[1:11:51] whatever amen there's only one that
[1:11:53] makes us perfect and that's the blood of
[1:11:55] Jesus Christ amen he hath perfected once
[1:11:59] for all them that are Sanctified ain't
[1:12:02] that right so mark that perfect man and
[1:12:05] behold the upright for the end of that
[1:12:07] man is peace but the transgress shall be
[1:12:11] destroyed together amen the end of the
[1:12:14] wicked shall be cut off but the
[1:12:16] Salvation everybody say the salvation of
[1:12:19] the righteous is of the Lord he is their
[1:12:23] strength in the time of trouble and the
[1:12:27] Lord shall help them and deliver them he
[1:12:30] shall deliver them from the wicked and
[1:12:32] save them because they trust in him not
[1:12:37] trusting in the stock market not
[1:12:38] trusting in a politician not trusting in
[1:12:41] the government not trusting in a church
[1:12:44] not trusting in a personality but
[1:12:46] trusting in the Lord amen see and so
[1:12:50] Psalms 41 And1 blessed is he that
[1:12:54] consider the poor War the Lord will
[1:12:56] deliver him in time of trouble the Lord
[1:13:00] will preserve him and keep him alive
[1:13:04] amen and he shall be blessed upon the
[1:13:08] Earth and thou Wilt not deliver him unto
[1:13:11] the will of his enemies amen and I I
[1:13:15] don't really think it's keep him and
[1:13:17] alive in the fact that that that we
[1:13:20] don't die there's Believers that do die
[1:13:23] but but they're not dead believer that
[1:13:25] is that goes in the ground uh the the
[1:13:29] the Bible calls says they're asleep amen
[1:13:32] they're asleep because they aren't dead
[1:13:35] God has kept them alive and we will see
[1:13:39] them again amen see and and so uh uh uh
[1:13:44] God will not deliver the believer uh uh
[1:13:47] unto his enemies to the whe of his
[1:13:50] enemies I'm so glad for that so the the
[1:13:53] True Believer has a promise that in the
[1:13:56] time of trouble God will be a help he's
[1:14:00] present to help amen now the whole world
[1:14:05] knows that trouble lays ahead they know
[1:14:08] that trouble is is is here and it's
[1:14:12] getting worse they they know that they
[1:14:14] know that it's a different kind of
[1:14:17] trouble than any other trouble that's
[1:14:20] the that the world has ever uh known and
[1:14:24] and because
[1:14:25] never before has fear been so prominent
[1:14:30] in the hearts of men hearts of people as
[1:14:34] it is today you know they come up with
[1:14:36] this sign uh saying a few years ago no
[1:14:39] fear no fear no fear you know and and
[1:14:42] and what you know but and and it it's a
[1:14:46] sign of toughness you know you can't do
[1:14:48] me you can't scare me and and all of
[1:14:50] these things but it the prophet said
[1:14:52] it's kind of like the boy that's going
[1:14:54] through the the the graveyard and and
[1:14:57] whistling and and and he's he's doing
[1:15:00] that because he's scared but he's trying
[1:15:02] to convince him he's not scared and so
[1:15:05] this is why we've got comedy this is why
[1:15:07] we got the pleasure this is why we got
[1:15:08] all of this is the world is trying to
[1:15:11] convince themselves amen that
[1:15:13] everything's okay when they know that
[1:15:16] it's not okay and fear really is in the
[1:15:20] hearts of men can you say amen amen and
[1:15:24] and so they they know amen Luke 21:25
[1:15:28] Jesus for told of this day and there
[1:15:30] shall be signs in the Sun and in the
[1:15:33] moon and in the stars and upon the Earth
[1:15:36] distress of nations with perplexity the
[1:15:40] Sea and the waves roaring now you know
[1:15:44] brother Bram said that's the tidal waves
[1:15:46] that we're experiencing you know they
[1:15:48] thought we were going to have a tidal
[1:15:49] wave in California the other day uh uh
[1:15:52] California had a seveno whatever on the
[1:15:55] Reus scale uh six miles under the ocean
[1:16:00] and uh uh uh they they they thought it
[1:16:03] they were warning people sonomy and and
[1:16:05] all these things and and and but but we
[1:16:09] we know that earthquakes and things are
[1:16:11] are ramping ramping up as uh uh by the
[1:16:15] day and and and so he said Jesus says
[1:16:18] for the powers or he says and men's
[1:16:21] Hearts failing them for fear why for
[1:16:24] looking after those things which are
[1:16:27] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:16:30] Heaven shall be shaken now we so we know
[1:16:34] we're living in that day we're not
[1:16:35] looking for that day to come it's
[1:16:38] happening right now people don't know
[1:16:40] what to do everything that they're
[1:16:42] trusting in amen is falling apart people
[1:16:46] don't know who to trust what to trust
[1:16:48] aen and most of of what they're doing is
[1:16:51] is a gamble it's it's just well I'm
[1:16:54] going to try this and see if it works
[1:16:55] I'm going to try this see if it works
[1:16:58] and and and it's just no one trust
[1:17:00] anything anymore and so but a person who
[1:17:03] has any kind of spiritual understanding
[1:17:06] knows that this scripture is being
[1:17:08] played out now uh uh it it's just the
[1:17:11] facts and and so people are looking
[1:17:14] after those things which are coming upon
[1:17:16] the Earth and we we know as Believers
[1:17:19] and as message Believers tribulation is
[1:17:22] setting in amen it isn't just a time of
[1:17:26] trouble that's just going to pass away
[1:17:28] like like uh like like our little
[1:17:30] troubles they they come and they go you
[1:17:32] know understand what I'm saying this
[1:17:34] trouble amen is is something that's
[1:17:37] going to remain amen because God is
[1:17:40] doing something it's it's setting in
[1:17:43] amen and and we we we also know by the
[1:17:47] message that since the opening of the
[1:17:48] the seals the six seal has to do with
[1:17:52] the Great Tribulation and it's a time
[1:17:56] this time of trouble is when God's Wrath
[1:18:00] is poured out upon the earth now the
[1:18:03] world is looking to a political educated
[1:18:06] genius to stop the trouble and and
[1:18:10] believe it or not they they think they
[1:18:12] found him they think they found him that
[1:18:14] he's going to stop all wars and and is
[1:18:17] the Golden Age going to bring in the
[1:18:19] Golden Age I got good news for him they
[1:18:22] ain't found him nothing is going to stop
[1:18:25] this time of trouble amen you see
[1:18:28] because it's already been written you
[1:18:30] know God says uh you know and and I I I
[1:18:33] I feel like this this nation is exactly
[1:18:36] the way God is speaking here in
[1:18:38] Deuteronomy 32 and 28 they are a nation
[1:18:41] void of counsel neither is there any
[1:18:45] understanding in them oh that they were
[1:18:48] wise that they understood this that they
[1:18:50] would consider their latter end if you
[1:18:54] go to the Third 5th verse to me
[1:18:56] belongeth Vengeance and recompense their
[1:18:58] foot shall slide in due time for the day
[1:19:02] of their Calamity is at hand and the
[1:19:05] things that shall come upon them make
[1:19:09] haste see for the Lord shall judge his
[1:19:12] people and repent himself for his
[1:19:14] servants when he seeth their that their
[1:19:17] power is gone and there is none shut up
[1:19:20] or left see and and in other words no
[1:19:23] nothing preserved see and he shall say
[1:19:26] where are their gods their Rock in whom
[1:19:30] they have trusted you see this is where
[1:19:33] we're coming down to amen people have
[1:19:35] trusted in everything but God they have
[1:19:37] trusted in politics they have trusted in
[1:19:39] their own strength they've trusted in
[1:19:41] their 401k or whatever they've trusted
[1:19:44] in the government they trusted in their
[1:19:46] abilities they trusted in their finances
[1:19:48] they trusted in in their materialistic
[1:19:51] things and they trusted in everything
[1:19:54] entertain
[1:19:55] amen instead of God Amen and and and God
[1:19:58] now is telling them amen that he's going
[1:20:01] to say where are their gods their Rock
[1:20:04] in whom they've trusted which did eat
[1:20:06] the fat of their sacrifices and drank
[1:20:09] the wine of their drink offerings let
[1:20:12] them rise up and help you and be your
[1:20:15] protection see see now that I even I am
[1:20:20] he and there is no God with me I kill
[1:20:23] and I make a alive I wound and I heal
[1:20:27] neither is there any that can deliver
[1:20:29] out of my hand you remember that the
[1:20:32] Bible says there's going to come a time
[1:20:34] where every every tongue and every knee
[1:20:37] is going to Bow before Him and
[1:20:40] acknowledge that he is Lord ain't that
[1:20:42] right amen see for I the 40th verse for
[1:20:46] I lift my hand to heaven and I and say I
[1:20:50] live forever if I wet my glittering
[1:20:53] sword and mine hand take hold on
[1:20:55] judgment I will render Vengeance to mine
[1:20:58] enemies and will reward uh them that
[1:21:01] hate me I will make mine arrows drunk
[1:21:05] with blood and my sword shall devour
[1:21:07] flesh and that the blood of the slain
[1:21:10] and of the captives from the beginning
[1:21:13] of revenges upon the enemy Rejoice oh ye
[1:21:16] nations with his people amen for he will
[1:21:19] avenge the blood of his servants and
[1:21:22] will re render Vengeance to his
[1:21:24] adversaries and will be merciful unto
[1:21:27] his land and to his people can you say
[1:21:31] Amen see so this is a time of trouble
[1:21:34] that cannot be kept away amen from po by
[1:21:38] politics it cannot be kept away amen by
[1:21:41] World Peace it cannot be kept Away by
[1:21:45] United Nations amen they're trying Every
[1:21:47] Which Way Amen to stop this trouble from
[1:21:51] from coming on see amen and and I'll say
[1:21:54] this the church can't even prophesy it
[1:21:57] away amen you can't even pray long
[1:22:00] enough and hard enough Amen to keep this
[1:22:03] trouble away amen for it's already been
[1:22:06] written amen 1 Thessalonians 5:2 for
[1:22:09] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:22:12] of the Lord so cometh the day of the
[1:22:15] Lord so cometh as a thief in the night
[1:22:19] and when they shall say sa peace and
[1:22:22] safety then sudden destruction ction
[1:22:25] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[1:22:28] with child and they shall not Escape
[1:22:32] ain't that right see they they're not
[1:22:34] realizing the time that we're in they
[1:22:37] they just see this as just a democratic
[1:22:39] trouble as something of a of a political
[1:22:42] party bringing trouble but what they
[1:22:44] don't know is the world is falling apart
[1:22:47] because tribulation is coming amen we're
[1:22:50] right on the verge amen of this and it
[1:22:53] is already heading in now I find a
[1:22:56] parallel between Israel and the church
[1:23:00] today when Israel turned to idol worship
[1:23:03] which is
[1:23:04] idolatry uh they they got into trouble
[1:23:08] and and the world is steeped the church
[1:23:12] um is steeped in idolatry worshiping
[1:23:16] numerous of Idols so so many Idols that
[1:23:20] that you can't it take uh hours and
[1:23:23] probably days di mention uh of these
[1:23:26] things but now we're not talking about
[1:23:28] the elect because the elect worship God
[1:23:30] only ain't that right the elect he only
[1:23:34] is their Rock he only is their salvation
[1:23:37] see and and so but but notice amen uh uh
[1:23:42] uh uh here David again uh uh Psalms 2211
[1:23:46] be not far from me for trouble is near
[1:23:51] for there is none to help they of that
[1:23:54] now there is none to help girlfriends
[1:23:58] can't help
[1:24:00] you boyfriends can't help you that's
[1:24:03] right pleasure can't help you Hollywood
[1:24:06] can't help you getting wrapped up in
[1:24:08] sports can't help
[1:24:11] you can you say amen amen there is none
[1:24:15] to help see so he's he's he's looking to
[1:24:18] God because there's nothing in the earth
[1:24:21] that's going to help in the time of
[1:24:22] trouble amen Psalm 60 and11 give us help
[1:24:26] from trouble for vain everybody say vain
[1:24:30] is the help of man vain is the help of
[1:24:33] man I it it doesn't matter what
[1:24:36] politician what what side gets into
[1:24:38] office vain is the help of man it it
[1:24:41] doesn't matter if if if if we go all the
[1:24:44] way up to the pope vain is the help of
[1:24:47] man there's nothing that's going to be
[1:24:50] able to help in the time of trouble but
[1:24:52] the believer looks to God
[1:24:56] amen now these two scriptures that we
[1:24:59] just read are are so foreign to humanity
[1:25:03] today uh and and we have been living in
[1:25:06] what is called uh the day of man right
[1:25:10] man's day yeah and and the prophet tells
[1:25:13] us man's day is the number six yeah
[1:25:16] that's right it was on the sixth day
[1:25:18] that God created
[1:25:20] man man's day see brother Bram said
[1:25:24] man's day is man's doing yes sir man's
[1:25:28] work man's Church man's idea of worship
[1:25:33] it's man's everything for it is man's
[1:25:36] world cosmos A ain't that right see so
[1:25:40] so we've been living in this time of of
[1:25:43] man's day man's
[1:25:46] glorification see it's a day where we
[1:25:49] have worldly conglomeration of gity and
[1:25:52] and mess and de possessed things on this
[1:25:56] Earth whether it's in the church or or
[1:25:59] whether it's out in the world Amen and
[1:26:02] if I could say it this way discern the
[1:26:04] spirit that's behind
[1:26:06] [Music]
[1:26:08] things amen see then then we go on about
[1:26:12] man's day brother BR said it's a day
[1:26:15] where the world is dedicating themselves
[1:26:17] to the knowledge which came by Satan and
[1:26:21] man's day is glorified not by the word
[1:26:24] of God but by the knowledge that he has
[1:26:28] man's day is a day when people are
[1:26:31] worshiping Satan in this day thinking
[1:26:34] they're worshiping God but they're
[1:26:36] worshiping him through a Creed man-made
[1:26:38] denominations and Creeds that's brought
[1:26:41] the people right down to the greatest
[1:26:43] deception the world has ever
[1:26:46] known see it's a day when the people are
[1:26:49] exalting man and his
[1:26:52] accomplishments right
[1:26:54] amen ain't that right it it's the day
[1:26:57] that the works amen by the knowledge of
[1:27:00] man is
[1:27:02] glorified Amen brother BR says look what
[1:27:05] see all the brag of the Communist see
[1:27:07] somebody trying to get somebody to the
[1:27:09] Moon he said well God's trying to get
[1:27:12] people to
[1:27:13] Heaven not to the stupid
[1:27:17] moon but that's a great
[1:27:20] accomplishment we may never go to the
[1:27:22] Moon brother Tim but we're going higher
[1:27:24] than the
[1:27:26] moon God's our
[1:27:30] help see says and and look they're
[1:27:33] they're trying to get somebody to the
[1:27:34] Moon look how they're spending millions
[1:27:37] and billions and trillions of dollars in
[1:27:40] a wasted
[1:27:42] effort and when they get there they
[1:27:44] ain't going to find
[1:27:45] nothing let them go to the go to Mars
[1:27:49] they ain't going to find what they're
[1:27:49] looking
[1:27:51] for hello
[1:27:54] it's man's
[1:27:56] day amen he said see his Works Satan's
[1:28:01] works are exalted above God's word and
[1:28:04] manifested works see the wisdom of Satan
[1:28:08] which he gave to Eve at the beginning
[1:28:11] now listen don't miss this the wisdom of
[1:28:14] Satan is exalted to the throne of
[1:28:16] worship in man above the Vindicated word
[1:28:20] for of God for the hour our churches
[1:28:23] prove that by their seminaries and
[1:28:25] schools of learning that's learned more
[1:28:27] than God's word knows about it they
[1:28:29] think see and there doct so and so and
[1:28:32] teacher so and so and professors so and
[1:28:34] so has exalted their own knowledge
[1:28:37] so-called from Satan truth see so-called
[1:28:41] truth from Satan above the Vindicated
[1:28:44] promise of God made clear right before
[1:28:46] them and man falls for it because it's
[1:28:50] the day of man see so the prophet says
[1:28:53] uh this is not God's day see God is the
[1:28:57] God of this Earth see or God is not the
[1:29:01] God of this Earth the Bible says he
[1:29:03] isn't he's the god of heaven so but this
[1:29:06] is not God's day that we're living in
[1:29:09] God's day is not filled of full of man's
[1:29:13] knowledge and man exalting himself and
[1:29:16] and and man's works and and Satan being
[1:29:19] glorified and lifted up God's day is not
[1:29:22] a day of deception
[1:29:25] amen and you say Amen so so man's day is
[1:29:31] is is a day where man's faith in God and
[1:29:34] His word is almost uh uh extinct yeah
[1:29:39] faith is slow yes sir people put more
[1:29:43] value in a doctor's words than they do
[1:29:45] God's word they put more value in man's
[1:29:49] word than God's word they they they put
[1:29:52] more value in a politician word than
[1:29:54] they do God's
[1:29:57] word ain't that right and so the people
[1:30:01] of the age they're they are letting
[1:30:04] science and education dictate their
[1:30:09] faith the educated professionals have
[1:30:12] taken the preeminence over God's
[1:30:15] word we have doctors of divinity
[1:30:17] philosophers lecturers
[1:30:20] psychologists in the pulpits yeah no
[1:30:24] longer are are they they The Minister's

[1:33:20] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:33:22] arise with healing in his wings and you
[1:33:25] shall go forth and grow up as calves of
[1:33:28] the stall remember amen this healing
[1:33:31] that he's talking about is not a
[1:33:33] physical healing he's not referring to
[1:33:35] amen a healing of some sickness a
[1:33:37] healing of whatever this healing has to
[1:33:40] do with our body
[1:33:42] change corruption being put away and
[1:33:46] incorruption setting

[1:33:51] mortality giving way to immortality
[1:33:54] can you say Amen oh do you love him see
[1:33:58] he shall rise with healing in his wings
[1:34:01] showing that he is a present help in the
[1:34:05] time of
[1:34:06] trouble now notice this happens in the
[1:34:09] day of the
[1:34:11] Lord now brother Bram says the day of
[1:34:13] the Lord is when the judgments fall and
[1:34:17] after that comes the
[1:34:19] Millennium so this this tribulation is
[1:34:22] nothing it's judgments falling upon the
[1:34:25] Earth falling upon
[1:34:27] mankind amen those that had refused the
[1:34:30] the full atonement of the word yes sir
[1:34:34] amen can you say amen that's right now
[1:34:37] notice amen the prophet would tell us
[1:34:39] the Lord's day everybody say the Lord's
[1:34:41] day now we're not talking about man's
[1:34:44] day we're talking about the Lord's day
[1:34:46] two different days two different things
[1:34:49] the Lord's Day is when the days of man
[1:34:52] are over and the kingdoms of this world
[1:34:56] will then become the kingdoms of our
[1:35:01] God they have tried to silence God they
[1:35:04] have tried to put him out they can put
[1:35:06] him out of the church they can put him
[1:35:08] out of our nation they can put him out
[1:35:09] of our schools they can put him out of
[1:35:11] our homes but they'll never do away with
[1:35:14] God for the day of God is
[1:35:18] here God's going to raise up his
[1:35:20] kingdoms God's going to show himself
[1:35:23] mighty God's going to show himself to be
[1:35:25] present never changing the same
[1:35:28] yesterday today and
[1:35:30] forever that's right thank
[1:35:35] God and at this time the world isn't
[1:35:38] going to find
[1:35:40] help now let's just
[1:35:42] read Revelation 6
[1:35:45] and12 and behold or and I beheld and
[1:35:48] when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo
[1:35:51] there was a great earthquake and the sun
[1:35:54] became black and as sackcloth of hair
[1:35:58] and and the moon became as blood and the
[1:36:02] stars of Heaven fell onto the Earth even
[1:36:05] as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs
[1:36:08] when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and
[1:36:11] the heaven departed as a scroll when it
[1:36:14] is rolled together and every mountain
[1:36:16] and Island were moved out of their
[1:36:18] places and the kings of the earth and
[1:36:21] the great men and the rich men and the
[1:36:23] chief captains and the Mighty Men And
[1:36:26] every Bond Man and every free man hid
[1:36:29] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[1:36:31] of the mountains and said to the
[1:36:33] mountains and the Rocks fall on us and
[1:36:35] hide us from the face of him that sth on
[1:36:39] the throne and from the Wrath of the
[1:36:41] lamb for the great day of his wrath is
[1:36:44] come and who shall be able to
[1:36:49] stand what a
[1:36:51] time now notice at this time it's a time
[1:36:54] of judgment Mercy will be over ain't
[1:36:57] that right because blood is no longer on
[1:37:00] The Mercy Seat that's right amen
[1:37:03] Revelations 22:11 he that is unjust let
[1:37:06] him be unjust still he that is filthy
[1:37:09] amen let him be filthy still he that is
[1:37:11] righteous let him be righteous still he
[1:37:13] that is Holy let him be holy still see
[1:37:16] so then it's going to be a time as God
[1:37:19] told Israel in Jeremiah
[1:37:22] 2:26 as the Thief is ashamed when he is
[1:37:26] found so is the house of Israel ashamed
[1:37:30] their kings their princes their their
[1:37:33] priests their Prophet saying to a stock
[1:37:36] Thou Art my father and to a stone thou
[1:37:39] Hast brought me forth see oh my amen a
[1:37:43] ain't that just dumb looking at a stone
[1:37:46] and saying Thou Art my father thou has
[1:37:48] brought me forth but isn't that amazing
[1:37:50] that men will worship things that it has
[1:37:53] not nothing to do with their salvation
[1:37:55] has nothing to do with their
[1:37:57] help and they look to it as their
[1:38:01] help it isn't even a living
[1:38:05] substance and yet they pray to Idols
[1:38:08] they pray to things oh Church you you
[1:38:10] know what they're doing today so to the
[1:38:14] stone thou has brought me forth see for
[1:38:17] they have turn their back unto me and
[1:38:19] not their face but in the time of
[1:38:22] trouble they will say arise and save us
[1:38:25] but where are their gods that thou H has
[1:38:28] made thee right let them arise if they
[1:38:33] can save thee in the time of thy trouble
[1:38:35] for according to the number of thy
[1:38:37] cities are thy Gods oh Judah ain't that
[1:38:40] right amen they they'd rather go they'd
[1:38:43] rather go to a basketball game a
[1:38:45] football game than they do the house of
[1:38:47] God then let them basketball players and
[1:38:50] let them sports stars and players save
[1:38:53] them in this time of
[1:38:55] [Music]
[1:38:57] trouble got to the place that church
[1:38:59] that they they will they will take a
[1:39:01] break I know of Assembly of God Church
[1:39:04] in in in Oklahoma my uncle and them used
[1:39:07] to go to that that now this is Assembly
[1:39:11] of God Pentecostal church that they had
[1:39:14] Church on the day of Super Bowl but time
[1:39:17] and and but when they had church when
[1:39:19] they had church was on halftime
[1:39:24] they brought the TV to
[1:39:26] church so they could all watch Super
[1:39:30] Bowl and during halftime which is what
[1:39:33] 30 minutes I've never watched Super Bowl
[1:39:36] I think it's 30 minutes or so hour they
[1:39:39] had
[1:39:40] church now it tells you where the
[1:39:42] priorities are most people are that way
[1:39:46] today we were having Church in a in a
[1:39:49] Presbyterian Church in in Pennsylvania
[1:39:53] and and and uh it on super bow you know
[1:39:57] and some dear precious lady she come and
[1:39:59] s in most of our
[1:40:01] service and at the end of it she says
[1:40:04] aren't we supposed to be watching Super
[1:40:06] Bowl I said no ma'am you're in the wrong
[1:40:09] place she says I guess I
[1:40:15] am oh but where are these Gods that's
[1:40:19] going to be able to save them in that
[1:40:20] day right you understand what I'm saying
[1:40:23] where's these Geniuses that's going to
[1:40:25] be able to help they seem to have the
[1:40:27] answers come on brother because God's
[1:40:30] going to show them in this time of
[1:40:32] trouble that they ain't got no answer
[1:40:35] not to help in this time of
[1:40:38] trouble now brother Braham says I don't
[1:40:41] know the minute or hour but I know I
[1:40:43] know everything is fulfilled and ready
[1:40:47] for the Rapture the church is called out
[1:40:50] it'll be a secret going just vanish and
[1:40:52] that'll be all
[1:40:53] and the world go right on just the same
[1:40:57] people preaching people thinking they're
[1:40:59] getting saved just exactly like they did
[1:41:01] in the days of Noah and so forth Noah
[1:41:03] entered into the ark and the people went
[1:41:06] right on the world turning just the same
[1:41:09] think of it and eternally lost thinking
[1:41:12] they're saved what a time can you say
[1:41:16] Amen see so this trouble is a trouble
[1:41:19] like never
[1:41:21] before now Psalms
[1:41:24] 7:17 break it in it says the arms of the
[1:41:26] wicked shall be broken but the Lord
[1:41:29] upholdeth the righteous amen the Lord
[1:41:33] knoweth the days of the upright and
[1:41:35] their inheritance shall be
[1:41:37] forever they shall not be ashamed in the
[1:41:42] evil
[1:41:43] time the world's going to be
[1:41:46] ashamed by the gods that they have
[1:41:48] served when he comes amen and shows
[1:41:51] himself they're going to be bearers
[1:41:53] they're going to be ashamed but they the
[1:41:56] righteous shall not be ashamed in the
[1:41:58] evil time and in the days of famine they
[1:42:01] shall be
[1:42:03] satisfied he's a present help in the
[1:42:06] time of
[1:42:07] trouble ain't that right now notice
[1:42:10] Psalms 37 and
[1:42:11] 23 amen the steps of a good man are
[1:42:15] ordered of the Lord and by the Lord and
[1:42:19] he delighteth in his way though he he
[1:42:24] fall he shall not be utterly cast down
[1:42:28] for the Lord upholdeth him in his or
[1:42:32] with his hand aren't you glad for that
[1:42:36] amen see so so in this time of trouble
[1:42:40] amen there there is God pouring out his
[1:42:43] wrath amen and it's it's already
[1:42:45] beginning if if you understand what I'm
[1:42:48] saying here the world is not going to
[1:42:51] fall apart it is is falling
[1:42:54] apart amen that's
[1:42:57] true look at nature and how the upset
[1:43:00] and even in nature yeah the
[1:43:03] seasons brother Bram said it shows It's
[1:43:06] The Sign of the
[1:43:09] times ain't that right now David was a
[1:43:13] perfect example of the righteous
[1:43:15] man he had fail made many EX mistakes
[1:43:20] but not one time did David turn his back
[1:43:24] on God and start worshiping
[1:43:30] Idols
[1:43:31] hello he failed God he sinned against
[1:43:35] God but he never got to a point that he
[1:43:39] look to other things for his
[1:43:45] help remember he even had a chance
[1:43:48] to remember he said I you know wasn't he
[1:43:52] given the choice to either fall in the
[1:43:54] hands of man or in the fall in the hands
[1:43:55] of
[1:43:56] God he had the
[1:43:59] chance but he says I let me fall into
[1:44:02] the hands of God for he is merciful he
[1:44:07] never found man to be equal or above
[1:44:11] God he never found man to be such a
[1:44:14] position that he appeals to man instead
[1:44:17] of
[1:44:19] God come on Church even if you don't
[1:44:23] feel like you're you're going to make it
[1:44:25] there is something about a believer that
[1:44:27] will never look into to the world and
[1:44:29] try to find that satisfaction he'll look
[1:44:31] to
[1:44:33] God it's just something about a
[1:44:36] Believer now now look see that's the way
[1:44:39] of a righteous man see uh uh uh uh David
[1:44:44] says here in 84 and2 my so longth yay
[1:44:48] even fainteth for the courts of the Lord
[1:44:52] my heart and my flesh crith out for the
[1:44:56] Living God in another place he said my
[1:44:59] soul followeth hard after
[1:45:02] thee that's the righteous
[1:45:05] man come on church that's the righteous
[1:45:09] man there's so many enticements out in
[1:45:12] this world but God remains God to
[1:45:15] us there's not one God of this world
[1:45:18] that has satisfied and been able to be
[1:45:21] compared to the god that we
[1:45:23] serve that's right all
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] right now if you
[1:45:32] notice six is the man's day notice what
[1:45:36] a prophet said but
[1:45:37] seven is his day of redemption Lord six
[1:45:42] is man's day
[1:45:45] six man's day man's Works man's idea man
[1:45:51] everything is exalted of God in man's
[1:45:57] day Satan is become God of worship the
[1:46:01] God of this evil world but
[1:46:05] seven is God's day of
[1:46:08] redemption oh
[1:46:12] my name you remember when Jesus said
[1:46:16] when you see these things begin to
[1:46:17] happen look
[1:46:20] up your Redemption draweth nigh yes sir
[1:46:23] amen if you notice there is that other
[1:46:25] day that God speaks of the Bible speaks
[1:46:27] of and that's the day of the Lord not
[1:46:30] man's day but the day of the Lord the
[1:46:33] Lord's
[1:46:34] day brother Bri said the Lord's Day is
[1:46:37] when man's days are over it's finished
[1:46:41] ain't that right now this day is a Time
[1:46:45] notice now this this is a time of
[1:46:48] trouble for the
[1:46:50] wicked and yet this is a time of
[1:46:54] redemption for the
[1:46:57] righteous
[1:47:01] true Isaiah 2
[1:47:05] and12 for the do day of the Lord of host

[1:47:34] fenced wall and upon all the ships of
[1:47:38] Tarsus and upon all Pleasant pictures

[1:50:40] heart shall melt and they shall be
[1:50:43] afraid pains and Sorrows shall take hold
[1:50:46] of them they shall be in pain as a woman
[1:50:49] that travaileth they shall be amazed at
[1:50:52] one another their faces shall be as
[1:50:54] flames behold the day of the Lord cometh
[1:50:57] cruel both with wrath and fierce anger
[1:51:00] to lay the land desolate and he shall
[1:51:03] destroy the Sinners thereof out of
[1:51:06] it Joel

[1:51:12] Lord is at hand and as a destruction
[1:51:15] from the almighty shall it come Joel 2
[1:51:19] and 1 I hope this all right this morning
[1:51:23] blow ye the trumpet in Zion and sound an
[1:51:25] alarm in my Holy Mountain let all the
[1:51:28] inhabitants of the land tremble for the
[1:51:30] day of the Lord cometh for it is now at
[1:51:33] hand a day of darkness and gloominess a
[1:51:37] day of clouds and of thick Darkness as
[1:51:40] the morning spread upon the mountains a
[1:51:42] great people and a strong there hath
[1:51:45] never been the like neither shall be
[1:51:48] anymore after it even to the years of
[1:51:50] many
[1:51:51] generations and fire devith before them
[1:51:55] and behind them a flame burneth the the
[1:51:58] land is as the Garden of Eden before
[1:52:00] them and behind them a desolate
[1:52:03] Wilderness yay and nothing shall Escape
[1:52:05] them the appearance of them is as the
[1:52:08] appearance of horses and as Horsemen so
[1:52:12] shall they run amen like the noise of
[1:52:15] Chariots on the top of mountains shall
[1:52:17] they leap like the noise of a flame of
[1:52:19] fire that devoureth the stubble as a
[1:52:22] strong people set in battle array before
[1:52:25] their face the people shall be much
[1:52:27] pained all faces Shall Gather
[1:52:31] Blackness they shall run like Mighty Men
[1:52:34] they shall climb the wall like Men of
[1:52:36] War and they shall March everyone on his
[1:52:39] ways and they shall not break the ranks
[1:52:42] neither shall one thrust one another
[1:52:45] neither uh uh thrust another uh they
[1:52:48] shall walk everyone in his path and when
[1:52:50] they fall upon this world they shall not
[1:52:53] be wounded they shall not run to or fro
[1:52:56] in the city they shall run upon the wall
[1:52:59] they shall climb upon the houses they
[1:53:01] shall enter in at the Windows like a
[1:53:03] thief the Earth shall Quake before them
[1:53:05] the heaven shall tremble the sun and the
[1:53:08] moon shall be dark and the sun sh or the
[1:53:10] Stars shall withdraw their shining and
[1:53:13] the Lord shall utter his voice before
[1:53:14] his army for his Camp is very great for
[1:53:17] he is strong that ex executeth his word
[1:53:20] for the day of the Lord is great and
[1:53:23] very terrible who can abide
[1:53:27] it you see the day of the Lord is a
[1:53:30] judgment day it's a time of God's Wrath
[1:53:33] not a time of God's mercy this world has
[1:53:36] been given Mercy yes sir and they've
[1:53:39] spurned it they've rejected it now it
[1:53:41] becomes a day of
[1:53:43] judgment ain't that right and remember
[1:53:47] it's at the ends of the Earth that the
[1:53:49] day of the Lord
[1:53:50] comes yes
[1:53:53] Lord amen ain't that right or we could
[1:53:56] say it this way when the day of the Lord
[1:53:58] comes then comes the ends of the
[1:54:06] Earth now
[1:54:07] notice second Peter 3 and10 but the day
[1:54:10] of the Lord will come as a thief in the
[1:54:13] night so so now think of that the day of
[1:54:17] the Lord shall come as a thief in the
[1:54:19] night it comes in gradually not
[1:54:23] just it comes in slowly gradually as a
[1:54:28] thief in the night in which the
[1:54:31] heavens notice at the day of the Lord
[1:54:34] this time of trouble the heavens shall
[1:54:36] pass away with a great noise and the
[1:54:39] elements uh uh uh shall melt with
[1:54:41] fervent Heat and the Earth also and the
[1:54:44] works that are therein shall be burned
[1:54:47] up see so the day of the Lord brings on
[1:54:50] the tribulation
[1:54:52] where the Earth will be purified of all
[1:54:55] of man's works all of man's Idols all
[1:54:59] the germs and the filthiness and the you
[1:55:04] understand brother bradam said see this
[1:55:07] is the day of men men are fighting right
[1:55:11] Nation against Nation wars and rumors of
[1:55:14] wars but the day of the Lord will come
[1:55:17] when these kingdoms will become the day
[1:55:19] of our Lord and of his Christ see now
[1:55:23] notice though also the Rapture everybody
[1:55:27] say the Rapture the Rapture happens in
[1:55:31] the day of the
[1:55:33] Lord
[1:55:36] hello tribulation sets in in the day of
[1:55:39] the Lord a day of judgment a day when
[1:55:43] God pours out his wrath remember the
[1:55:46] Bible in Malachi calls it the great and
[1:55:48] terrible day of the
[1:55:50] Lord ain't that
[1:55:52] right but then we see that the Rapture
[1:55:55] happens in the day of the Lord notice
[1:55:57] now uh uh 1 Thessalonians 5 and two uh
[1:56:02] we we read this but uh uh part of it
[1:56:05] already but it says for you know
[1:56:07] perfectly that the day of the Lord so
[1:56:10] cometh as a thief in the
[1:56:13] night say it again the day of the Lord
[1:56:16] so cometh as a thief in the
[1:56:20] night right
[1:56:22] you look at that and tie it with the
[1:56:24] message the prophet always takes that
[1:56:26] for the
[1:56:28] Rapture can you say amen for when they
[1:56:31] shall say peace and safety are we not in
[1:56:36] that
[1:56:37] age bringing in a golden age everything
[1:56:40] going to be okay look at all of them
[1:56:45] prophesying that's right then sudden
[1:56:49] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:56:53] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:56:55] not Escape so what is the day of the
[1:56:58] Lord It's the
[1:57:00] coming of the
[1:57:02] lord it's the age of
[1:57:07] rapture can you say Amen notice
[1:57:10] Revelation 16:15 Jesus says behold I
[1:57:15] come as a
[1:57:19] thief
[1:57:21] hello see so his coming will be as a
[1:57:25] thief in the night am the day of the
[1:57:28] Lord cometh as a thief in the
[1:57:32] night this is exactly what Paul was
[1:57:34] speaking of in in in or referring to in
[1:57:38] first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord
[1:57:42] himself shall descend from heaven with
[1:57:45] the Shout with the voice of the
[1:57:47] Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:57:50] God do you know that the only thing this
[1:57:54] message has effect upon is God's
[1:57:57] elect the others ridicule it the others
[1:58:00] mock it the others burn
[1:58:05] it but it's for the elect amen so the
[1:58:10] day of the Lord is is is the coming of
[1:58:13] the Lord it comes as a thief in the
[1:58:15] night in Revelations 10:1 Paul John saw
[1:58:19] what Paul was talking about I saw
[1:58:21] another Mighty angel come down from
[1:58:22] heaven clothed with the book and a
[1:58:24] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:58:28] was as it were the sun his feet as
[1:58:30] pillars of fire remember everyone whose
[1:58:34] name is written in that book shall be
[1:58:39] delivered remember this is not two
[1:58:42] different comings John is not talking of
[1:58:45] one coming and Paul talking of a
[1:58:47] different coming it's the same coming
[1:58:51] and if you know notice when they're
[1:58:52] talking about this coming they're not
[1:58:54] talking about judgment like all the
[1:58:56] others are talking of
[1:58:58] judgment can you say amen that's right
[1:59:01] see but they are showing that he comes
[1:59:04] as a present help to that elect that
[1:59:08] predestinated seed in their time of
[1:59:12] trouble that is true
[1:59:16] amen Lord he comes he comes to claim
[1:59:21] what he has redeemed
[1:59:24] amen aren't you glad for that and the
[1:59:27] dead in Christ shall rise
[1:59:31] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:59:34] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:59:36] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:59:38] and so shall we ever be with the
[1:59:42] Lord oh my that ought to make us happy
[1:59:44] today praise the Lord to think of it he
[1:59:47] comes not to destroy us but to be our
[1:59:50] present help in the time of
[1:59:57] trouble did you know the prophet said
[2:00:00] the dead in Christ cannot come forth
[2:00:02] until he takes the rights of
[2:00:06] redemption he said see and now he walks
[2:00:09] forth from a mediator where death put us
[2:00:11] in the grave he comes forth with the
[2:00:14] rights amen and even those who are alive
[2:00:18] and remain till his coming shall not
[2:00:20] hinder them which are asleep for the The
[2:00:22] Trumpet Of God shall sound at that last
[2:00:23] trumpet when the last seal is broke how
[2:00:26] many believes the last seal is broke
[2:00:28] that seventh seal is
[2:00:31] broken and when the seventh Angel's
[2:00:34] given his message the last trumpet shall
[2:00:36] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:00:40] and we which are alive and remain shall
[2:00:43] be caught up together with them in the
[2:00:45] air see he's come forth now to claim his
[2:00:50] possession that's right
[2:00:54] that's why we're not looking for another
[2:00:55] age we're not looking for another
[2:00:57] messenger we understand where we're
[2:00:59] living at he's come forth to claim his
[2:01:04] Poss prise the
[2:01:06] Lord now where was
[2:01:08] John when he saw the
[2:01:12] coming Lord Revelations 1:10 says I was
[2:01:15] in the spirit on the Lord's
[2:01:17] day not in man's day the Lord's Day
[2:01:26] amen Prophet said see John was
[2:01:29] transmitted from the aisle of patmas in
[2:01:31] the spirit over into the Lord's day amen
[2:01:35] see the Lord's Day the day of his coming
[2:01:38] his judgment that'll be the Lord's day
[2:01:41] ain't that right so there he was
[2:01:44] watching the coming of the Lord in the
[2:01:47] Lord's
[2:01:48] Day Prophet says that he was actually
[2:01:51] God was showing John the rehearsal of
[2:01:55] his
[2:01:58] coming now now I have to tell you and we
[2:02:02] could go we'll go more into it as as we
[2:02:04] go by God's grace but if you studied the
[2:02:08] message you know that he was caught up
[2:02:10] in our
[2:02:11] day this
[2:02:15] day can you say Amen
[2:02:18] John 2,000 years ago or so was sitting
[2:02:22] there because the enemy had banished
[2:02:26] him but God remembered
[2:02:29] him and while he was sitting on that
[2:02:32] island he said I just got in the spirit
[2:02:34] and got caught up over into this day the
[2:02:39] Lord's
[2:02:40] dayl John saw what you
[2:02:45] saw
[2:02:48] amen what did he see then he saw saw
[2:02:52] Christ as
[2:02:55] judge can't have judgment without a
[2:02:59] judge can you say
[2:03:02] amen and it can't be a righteous
[2:03:04] judgment without a righteous
[2:03:07] judge
[2:03:10] amen so Revelations 1:13 and in the
[2:03:14] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[2:03:16] unto the son of man clothed with the
[2:03:19] Garment down to the foot and the Girt
[2:03:21] and GT about the paps with a golden
[2:03:23] girdle now brother Brandon describes all
[2:03:26] this to show that that's not the priest
[2:03:28] he's not in his priesthood he's as a
[2:03:31] judge by the way John describes him
[2:03:33] being dressed his head and his hair were
[2:03:38] like white like wool as white as snow
[2:03:42] and his eyes were as flame of fire ain't
[2:03:46] that right so so the prophet said see
[2:03:48] his hairs were like white as wool show
[2:03:51] knowing that he is Judge Supreme Judge
[2:03:56] John shows he says that he wasn't in the
[2:03:59] day of his prophecy as a prophet neither
[2:04:02] was he Plum out in the days of his
[2:04:04] kingship but he was in the day of the
[2:04:07] Lord as a
[2:04:12] judge aren't you glad for
[2:04:15] that now this fits with John 5 and22 for
[2:04:19] the father judgeth no man but hath
[2:04:22] committed all judgment unto the
[2:04:25] son there also the Bible tells us in
[2:04:28] Acts
[2:04:29] 1731 that he God hath appointed a day
[2:04:34] see in the which he will judge the world
[2:04:37] in righteousness by that man Jesus
[2:04:41] Christ see whom he hath ordained where
[2:04:45] of Heath given Assurance unto all men in
[2:04:48] that he hath raised him from the dead
[2:04:51] amen
[2:04:52] second Timothy 4:1 I charge thee
[2:04:55] therefore before God and the Lord Jesus
[2:04:58] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[2:05:00] dead at his appearing and his
[2:05:05] kingdom see so he becomes judge in the
[2:05:10] day of the Lord now I'm getting ready to
[2:05:13] close but Daniel
[2:05:15] 17:13 and I saw in the night because
[2:05:18] here's now that Daniel writing of the
[2:05:21] same thing that John saw I saw in the
[2:05:24] night visions and behold one like the
[2:05:27] son of man came with the Clouds Of
[2:05:29] Heaven you know it's amazing how one man
[2:05:32] just doesn't write all events about it
[2:05:35] but God will take different men
[2:05:37] different prophets throughout the Bible
[2:05:39] and and they see different things about
[2:05:41] the same
[2:05:44] thing so he says one like the son of man
[2:05:47] came with the Clouds Of Heaven well John
[2:05:49] didn't say that he came with the CL
[2:05:51] Clouds Of Heaven but here he is saying
[2:05:53] it I saw him come with the clouds of
[2:05:57] heaven and came to the Ancient of Days
[2:06:00] and they brought him near before him and
[2:06:03] there was given him
[2:06:06] Dominion he didn't come to be sped upon
[2:06:09] he didn't come to be ridiculed he didn't
[2:06:12] come all the there was given Dominion
[2:06:15] glory and a kingdom that all people
[2:06:19] Nations and languages should serve him
[2:06:22] his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion
[2:06:24] which shall not pass away and his
[2:06:26] kingdom that which shall not be
[2:06:28] destroyed the 18th verse now the Saints
[2:06:31] of the most high shall take the kingdom
[2:06:34] and possess the kingdom even forever and
[2:06:41] ever
[2:06:44] amen what is it it's the day of the Lord
[2:06:48] not man's day the day of the Lord ain't
[2:06:50] that right now notice see in the ninth
[2:06:53] verse Daniel describes him now this
[2:06:57] Ancient of Days the son of man the
[2:06:59] prophet said came to the Ancient of
[2:07:02] Days and now watch I beheld till the
[2:07:06] Thrones were cast down and the Ancient
[2:07:09] of Days did sit whose garment was white
[2:07:12] as snow and the hair of his head was
[2:07:15] like pure wo amen see seeing the same
[2:07:20] thing that John saw his head was white
[2:07:25] hairs was white as
[2:07:27] wool ain't that right go to the 10th
[2:07:30] verse and a fiery stream notice at this
[2:07:33] happening a fiery stream issued and came
[2:07:36] forth from before him thousands
[2:07:39] thousands ministered unto him and tens
[2:07:42] uh uh 10,000 times 10,000 stood before
[2:07:45] him the Judgment was set and the books
[2:07:49] were open
[2:07:53] what was it the day of the
[2:07:54] Lord a time of
[2:07:56] trouble can you say Amen so he came he
[2:08:01] came with a cloud his hair white as wool
[2:08:05] now notice John or Jesus for told of
[2:08:08] this same coming Luke 21:25 and there
[2:08:11] shall be signs in the Sun and in the
[2:08:13] moons and the Stars upon the Earth
[2:08:15] distress of nations with perplexity the
[2:08:18] Sea and the waves roaring men's heart
[2:08:21] failing them for fear looking for things
[2:08:24] after those things and looking after
[2:08:27] those things which are coming upon the
[2:08:29] Earth for the powers of Heaven shall be
[2:08:31] shaken and then they shall see the son
[2:08:34] of man coming with a cloud with power
[2:08:39] and great
[2:08:41] Glory can you say amen and then notice

[2:09:09] open book and John says he brother

[2:12:34] this side uh the Earth is like this
[2:12:38] because it should be like
[2:12:41] that and
[2:12:43] so brother br's talking about said you
[2:12:46] see the picture of the day how he turned
[2:12:49] that picture
[2:12:52] now I think I've mentioned it before but
[2:12:54] brother Ed Hunter he was in I think it
[2:12:57] was the rising of the
[2:12:59] Sun that that service I'm I'm pretty
[2:13:02] sure that's that's the
[2:13:04] one but they this uh Life Magazine had
[2:13:08] just come out with this picture so
[2:13:10] everybody was before service they were
[2:13:12] all looking at the picture and they were
[2:13:14] just oh wow that is so cool you know all
[2:13:17] this stuff he said never one time that
[2:13:21] it Dawn on them to turn the picture not
[2:13:24] one time so they were wondering what
[2:13:26] does these men mean and and and so they
[2:13:29] were just oh wow this is really cool
[2:13:32] they go inside brother brandom didn't
[2:13:34] even know
[2:13:36] it and how he mentioned it how that as
[2:13:39] he's looking at the
[2:13:41] picture the angel of the Lord says turn
[2:13:44] it to your right GL and when he turned
[2:13:48] it to the right that's what it is so
[2:13:51] brother Bri says now you see the picture
[2:13:53] the other day how he turned that picture
[2:13:56] sideways there and the Very picture of
[2:14:00] those seven angels being lifted up turn
[2:14:03] it to the right hand side there is the
[2:14:06] face of the
[2:14:08] [Music]
[2:14:09] Lord
[2:14:12] hallu Jesus looking down to the Earth
[2:14:17] again he said you remember when I
[2:14:19] preached the seven Church ages I could
[2:14:21] understand why Jesus standing there with
[2:14:23] a white over his head he was a young man
[2:14:27] so see now he's looking at John and and
[2:14:30] what John writes about how he's got
[2:14:31] white his hair was white as wool Daniel
[2:14:34] talks about it and and a even a prophet
[2:14:37] at that time didn't understand it how in
[2:14:39] the world is he you know he's a young
[2:14:41] man how does he have white hair amen so
[2:14:45] he says see I took it back in the Bible
[2:14:47] and it says he came to the Ancient of
[2:14:49] Days whose hair was white as wool Jesus
[2:14:52] was only 33 and A2 years old at his
[2:14:54] crucifixion so he says I called up
[2:14:56] brother Jack Moore a theologian he said
[2:14:58] oh brother brandham that's Jesus in his
[2:15:00] glorified State stage and and said after
[2:15:04] his death bural and Resurrection he
[2:15:05] turned to that well that sounded all
[2:15:07] right for a theologian but it didn't go
[2:15:10] good see it didn't hit hit the something
[2:15:13] didn't hit right with a prophet right so
[2:15:15] I went up there and started on that
[2:15:17] first church age and there the Holy
[2:15:20] Spirit revealed it
[2:15:21] now you got it right on your church ages
[2:15:24] I guess the books will be up pretty soon
[2:15:26] the full detail of it and it showed that
[2:15:29] Jesus was
[2:15:35] Judge there is a white wig that they
[2:15:39] used to wear put on a wig on and wear it
[2:15:42] as a judge England still does it when
[2:15:44] you got supreme authority and that
[2:15:47] turning sideways in this picture that
[2:15:51] there he
[2:15:52] is amen
[2:15:55] right his black hair you can see it in
[2:15:58] the side of his beard uh uh there and
[2:16:02] the white wig on see he is the last of
[2:16:05] the authority he is supreme authority
[2:16:08] even God said so himself this is my
[2:16:11] beloved Son hear ye
[2:16:14] him there he is with them Angels
[2:16:19] amen not a Thunderhead Cloud but a cloud
[2:16:23] of
[2:16:24] angels can you say Amen see the message
[2:16:28] which was the seven breaking of them
[2:16:30] Seven Seals that revealed serpent seed
[2:16:32] and all these things here and it shows
[2:16:34] that it is his covering it's his supreme
[2:16:38] authority he is supreme and he is wigged
[2:16:42] or
[2:16:43] covered Hallelujah do you love
[2:16:46] himen amen isn't the Lord wonderful what
[2:16:49] a day we're living in
[2:16:52] amen if the musicians will
[2:16:55] come according
[2:16:58] to the scripture I believe it's in
[2:17:06] Isaiah it says the day of the Lord is a
[2:17:09] day of
[2:17:11] Darkness the day of the Lord is a day of
[2:17:16] darkness and and of course we know that
[2:17:19] to be spiritual Darkness a spiritual
[2:17:23] blindness and if you notice where we're
[2:17:26] at it ties in with that because Isaiah
[2:17:30] 60 I
[2:17:32] think it says that gross Darkness
[2:17:35] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[2:17:38] Darkness the people in Shalom the
[2:17:41] message Shalom brother Brandon preached
[2:17:43] them
[2:17:44] twice preached that sermon
[2:17:46] twice he deals with that amen and he
[2:17:50] talks of how that the darkness has
[2:17:54] come we're living in a time where
[2:17:57] Darkness has covered the Earth gross
[2:17:58] Darkness the people he said they're
[2:18:01] wonderful people good
[2:18:04] people but they just can't see they they
[2:18:10] he said they just can't get
[2:18:13] it he shows it's it's a Darkness it's
[2:18:16] gross Darkness amen see the day of the
[2:18:19] Lord is is is is is a dark day it's a
[2:18:23] day of
[2:18:25] Darkness but yet there as the prophet
[2:18:29] Isaiah is talking of this gross Darkness
[2:18:32] falling upon the people and darkness
[2:18:34] upon the Earth what does he start out
[2:18:37] with arise Shine for thy light has
[2:18:44] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[2:18:49] upon thee
[2:18:52] can you say
[2:18:54] [Music]
[2:18:56] amen I think that's
[2:19:01] powerful and in that message Shalom as
[2:19:04] he's talking about the darkness and the
[2:19:07] gross darkness and all these things
[2:19:11] notice he says it's just before
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:17] day the morning and he's talking about
[2:19:20] the Pres present time where we're at the
[2:19:24] morning star has come out to hail the
[2:19:28] day
[2:19:29] coming and the Holy Spirit showing its
[2:19:34] light it's coming a time when the light
[2:19:38] and darkness will have to be separated
[2:19:42] yes amen one from the other church and
[2:19:45] its order will take the order of the day
[2:19:48] and Christ and his light work promise
[2:19:51] will go in the Rapture that's the only
[2:19:54] thing that's left for them to do it's a

[2:30:36] asked sister uh Kim weeks to come and
[2:30:39] take 10
[2:30:41] minutes and uh her and brother John had
[2:30:45] uh delivered uh some the things that we
[2:30:49] had uh got money for that you you given
[2:30:52] for to help with the hurricane relief
[2:30:56] and
[2:30:58] so
[2:31:01] uh yes yeah yeah you can pass them out
[2:31:06] they've taken some pictures we had tried
[2:31:07] to get it up on the screen but they were
[2:31:09] too small and so um they they give some
[2:31:14] pictures there but um
[2:31:17] anyway God bless y'all um we were
[2:31:20] privileged to go uh be the hands and
[2:31:23] feet for you uh North Carolina you know
[2:31:27] is my hometown and uh where most of the
[2:31:30] devastation happened was I live in the
[2:31:32] Foothills and the mountains are stomping
[2:31:35] grounds right there and um so it's been
[2:31:37] near and dear to my heart to go and uh I
[2:31:40] cried a lot when it first happened and
[2:31:43] uh John and all of his wisdom told me to
[2:31:45] quit crying and do something about it so
[2:31:48] um but we went uh the day after
[2:31:50] Thanksgiving and uh all the videos
[2:31:53] doeses not prepare you that you can
[2:31:56] watch all the news doesn't prepare you
[2:31:59] for what you're going to see it's
[2:32:01] uh uh it's devastating still
[2:32:06] uh but the the mountain people are
[2:32:08] strong people and and they will get
[2:32:10] through it somehow in all of
[2:32:13] this and uh it feels like the government
[2:32:16] is trying to cover it up
[2:32:20] and uh I don't know if you've been
[2:32:21] paying attention but I pay pay a lot of
[2:32:23] attention and it just seems to there's
[2:32:25] no money for them we can send billions
[2:32:28] overseas but there's no money to help
[2:32:30] the people so whether you're giv 20 or a
[2:32:34] thousand they they need they need what
[2:32:38] what's coming um so um I'd like to tell
[2:32:40] you right quick we had some money from
[2:32:42] our our car club and uh they had trusted
[2:32:45] us to take and and and give it away and
[2:32:48] so I just ask God to to guide us you
[2:32:51] know you guide us where you need this
[2:32:53] money to go and uh uh all the stories
[2:32:56] are here you're going to hear stuff
[2:32:58] maybe that's a little fabricated but um
[2:33:01] it's real uh it has happened and um so
[2:33:05] right when we we we went to uh where our
[2:33:08] contact was and you have to have a
[2:33:10] contact if you're going up in there and
[2:33:12] uh the contact was in a volunteer Camp
[2:33:15] these volunteers are coming from Texas
[2:33:18] and uh Alabama and from all over the
[2:33:20] United States just to help you know it's
[2:33:24] just amazing and and in this volunteer
[2:33:26] Camp there are campers but there's also
[2:33:28] tents and most of the tent uh people
[2:33:31] that are living in the tents are
[2:33:33] volunteers because they have no place to
[2:33:35] go they have uh maybe they um their home
[2:33:39] was destroyed or they rented and uh so
[2:33:42] they have stayed there to get a so that
[2:33:45] they can get fed but also they're
[2:33:47] sending them out to help people clean up
[2:33:49] and and and stuff and but right when we
[2:33:52] got there there was an emergency uh
[2:33:54] volunteers were running for their
[2:33:56] vehicles to they had received a phone
[2:33:59] call that a young family a father and
[2:34:01] mother and three littles were in a tent
[2:34:03] and it was cold up there it was blowing
[2:34:06] snow it was windy three littles were in
[2:34:08] a tent the two youngest would not stop
[2:34:10] crying no matter how hard they tried
[2:34:12] what they were doing the children would
[2:34:14] not quit you know and it scared them
[2:34:16] because they thought you know they've
[2:34:18] lost lives up there because because of
[2:34:19] the cold so they were running to get
[2:34:21] them and put them in a hotel and we were
[2:34:24] able uh because of our car club to put
[2:34:27] envelope in their hands to to help um
[2:34:30] but U just
[2:34:32] absolute dire needs they have nothing
[2:34:36] and uh so um we were also sent to a
[2:34:39] family and you may have heard the story
[2:34:41] but
[2:34:42] um uh uh Grandpa and Grandma went to
[2:34:45] church on Wednesday night and their son
[2:34:48] daughter-in-law and three daughters
[2:34:50] also at church well the three daughters
[2:34:52] wanted to go home with their
[2:34:53] grandparents and they let them go and
[2:34:57] uh the next day was the flood and uh
[2:35:01] them girls
[2:35:03] lost they lost mom and dad and they lost
[2:35:06] their home and they lost everything the
[2:35:08] girls are 8 years old 12 years old and
[2:35:11] 16 and uh staying in a two bedroom
[2:35:14] trailer with Grandma and
[2:35:15] Grandpa they found the dad in Tennessee
[2:35:18] the body
[2:35:20] um mom's never been found and uh this is
[2:35:23] real I mean this we went to the family's
[2:35:25] home and uh um spoke with them and just
[2:35:29] wonderful people they love the Lord they
[2:35:31] don't know what we know but they love
[2:35:33] the Lord you'll see a picture of them if
[2:35:35] it comes around and the Grandpa's 66 he
[2:35:38] just
[2:35:39] retired um and is uh going to raise
[2:35:42] three children three girls um in that
[2:35:44] home uh but uh we were able to help them
[2:35:47] and it just did my heart good you know
[2:35:49] uh I lost my mom when I was a little
[2:35:51] girl I know what it's like and uh to to
[2:35:54] imagine those little girls have lost
[2:35:57] both at one time and and um so so many
[2:36:02] so many needs what you're hearing is not
[2:36:04] embellished it is not uh it's real these
[2:36:08] people are are in serious trouble uh all
[2:36:11] the flood victims just not just North
[2:36:12] Carolina but Tennessee and Georgia also
[2:36:15] um only like 3% had flood insurance and
[2:36:19] for the most part insurance companies
[2:36:21] would not sell them flood insurance
[2:36:23] because it didn't seem to be a risk but
[2:36:27] um we passed homes that from the front
[2:36:30] look like I thought you know why didn't
[2:36:32] the water touch them but coming back
[2:36:34] down the whole back of that house was
[2:36:37] gone you were looking at a facade to the
[2:36:40] front of that house brother wheel the

[2:39:00] um kind of made me smile uh so the
[2:39:03] people like when they have a need they
[2:39:05] come into the volunteer Camp because
[2:39:06] they have uh uh trailers with with stuff
[2:39:10] you know that they can help them with
[2:39:12] and
[2:39:13] uh uh evidently some men come in to get
[2:39:16] propane and that sort of thing and the
[2:39:18] uh had some wives with them there was
[2:39:21] great
[2:39:24] enthusiasm for
[2:39:26] a it's just a
[2:39:29] br these people can't work their their
[2:39:31] their livelihoods are destroyed at the
[2:39:33] moment uh if there's if there's U plants
[2:39:36] they're they're under mud uh you know
[2:39:38] they're trying to dig out and uh so they
[2:39:42] were so excited Britney God bless you
[2:39:44] for thinking of them they were so
[2:39:47] excited to get a new broom
[2:39:50] uh and uh but you know even if it's just
[2:39:53] mud in their homes if they have their
[2:39:55] home at all uh it's tons of mud tons and
[2:39:59] and
[2:40:00] uh uh they will rebuild uh our contact

[2:40:07] contractor uh and he was actually just
[2:40:09] visiting in the area to he was building
[2:40:12] a home and it was destroyed and uh but
[2:40:15] he has dedicated the next year without
[2:40:18] any p
[2:40:20] trying to help these people
[2:40:22] rebuild I like that he's standing there
[2:40:25] talking and he's got a cigarette in his
[2:40:27] mouth and but there's something in his
[2:40:28] heart that cares and I like that and um
[2:40:33] so I I had asked him this morning what
[2:40:35] are the needs right now and uh he said
[2:40:39] always propane and propane tanks they
[2:40:42] they've got to get through the winter
[2:40:43] and it's
[2:40:44] cold uh but from his end of course
[2:40:47] they're trying to get them into a
[2:40:48] shelter even if it's just a tiny house
[2:40:50] they're trying to get them into a
[2:40:51] shelter and uh he said Building Supplies
[2:40:55] uh monetary gifts um and of course we
[2:40:59] have the the church you know the foreign
[2:41:01] Brothers need to save their church too
[2:41:03] so uh and I know we're just a small
[2:41:04] group but God supplies he he does he
[2:41:07] owns he owns it all anyway but um anyway
[2:41:11] it's it's it's it's a real need please
[2:41:14] don't forget them if if it's just if
[2:41:17] it's just that you're praying your heart
[2:41:18] out
[2:41:20] please don't forget these people Cu uh I
[2:41:22] just can't imagine being in their shoes
[2:41:24] and uh we will be going back uh the 21st
[2:41:27] if if the Lord puts anything on your
[2:41:29] heart we'd be glad to take it with us or
[2:41:31] you know if brother sha has a plan for
[2:41:34] maybe how we could help again but uh it
[2:41:36] was an
[2:41:37] honor to
[2:41:40] walk through that mountain for you and
[2:41:42] and uh to know that my my congregation
[2:41:46] cared enough to to do what we did and
[2:41:49] and uh uh we
[2:41:53] uh I just found out last night that you
[2:41:57] know you have all these uh conspiracy
[2:42:01] kind of people right and there are some
[2:42:03] that are claiming that this didn't
[2:42:05] happen or this this isn't as bad as they
[2:42:08] you know you you get all kind of things
[2:42:10] but um my cousin uh is married to a fine
[2:42:14] man that um works for Duke power been
[2:42:18] with him for many many years years and
[2:42:21] he was telling us that or telling my
[2:42:22] family yesterday that he had to do it
[2:42:25] twice but that uh as much as they were
[2:42:30] trying to get the power back on up there
[2:42:32] they were pulled away from their job
[2:42:35] many
[2:42:36] times to go get bodies out of
[2:42:39] trees he said you don't he said you
[2:42:42] it'll never leave me he said uh it was
[2:42:45] the hardest thing I could have worked
[2:42:47] all day on a power line that could have
[2:42:48] kill be but to go get innocent people
[2:42:52] who had no idea what was coming U they
[2:42:54] they needed buckets to to lift the
[2:42:57] people out of of the bodies out of the
[2:42:59] trees and stuff and but um and and you
[2:43:02] know God none of it surprises God you
[2:43:04] know he knew he knew but but um still as
[2:43:08] a
[2:43:09] human let's just keep them in our
[2:43:12] prayers and um uh uh you know if we if
[2:43:16] we do decide to do something U
[2:43:20] God bless you but God bless you for what
[2:43:22] you've already done because it was such
[2:43:24] an honor to to to uh be there on on the
[2:43:28] behalf of f t that a missing honey we're
[2:43:31] good
[2:43:49] that
[2:44:48] spe for

[2:46:17] distribute
[2:46:19] um what was given and so um uh we
[2:46:23] certainly don't want to forget uh the
[2:46:25] people there I I know it's going to take
[2:46:27] a take a while for them to
[2:46:30] recover and um from what I had heard
[2:46:33] that um
[2:46:36] uh some were building
[2:46:39] little kind of Shack homes or whatever
[2:46:42] in the
[2:46:43] government the Amish
[2:46:53] okay
[2:47:19] they told
[2:48:01] well yeah yeah I don't understand why
[2:48:05] they're doing that but uh we certainly
[2:48:08] appreciate all the volunteers that have
[2:48:10] been helping the people down there and
[2:48:12] we want to uh keep them in our prayer
[2:48:16] the the people and and the volunteers

[2:48:35] doing and and we will continue to um if
[2:48:39] anyone has anything that you want to

[2:49:32] SE
[2:49:55] yeah we certainly uh be keeping them in
[2:49:57] our prayer and
[2:50:01] um um and as we had mentioned anyone
[2:50:04] that would like to give for that the
[2:50:06] Believers there in
[2:50:09] Pakistan
[2:50:11] um uh I know it would be a blessing to
[2:50:15] them as as well um we can stand to our
[2:50:20] feet and
[2:50:23] uh uh brother Matthew uh as I guess most
[2:50:28] of us know he's uh he's been training to
[2:50:31] be a
[2:50:32] policeman and um he's going to need a
[2:50:36] lot of
[2:50:37] prayer for that and the bad guys are
[2:50:40] going to need a lot of prayer too once
[2:50:43] he gets after
[2:50:45] him but uh no he's entering a a
[2:50:48] dangerous job and um so we want to we
[2:50:52] really want to keep him in prayer he's
[2:50:54] been um 24
[2:50:58] weeks 21 weeks he's been in boot camp
[2:51:02] and
[2:51:03] uh uh he has described some of his
[2:51:07] training and uh I am so glad that the
[2:51:12] Lord called me to be a preacher and not
[2:51:14] a
[2:51:15] policeman and uh he's had to go up
[2:51:18] against some big guys and they were they
[2:51:21] were there to beat him up and uh he he
[2:51:25] broke his thumb and um some other guys
[2:51:29] broke some bones but he had they they
[2:51:32] had to do it for training to know what
[2:51:35] they were up against and uh so he he's
[2:51:38] been through the meal for these 21 weeks
[2:51:42] but he is
[2:51:43] graduating and uh uh the uh graduating
[2:51:48] the police
[2:51:49] academy uh this coming Thursday the 12th
[2:51:53] at uh
[2:51:55] 1:30 uh in the afternoon uh in
[2:51:59] Bristol and so he's inviting everyone
[2:52:03] that want to come and uh be a witness
[2:52:06] that um you're you're more than welcome
[2:52:09] and I'm sure he could give us some uh
[2:52:12] directions and things like that but um
[2:52:16] anyways we we just really congratulate
[2:52:18] brother Matthew and all of his hard work
[2:52:21] and and
[2:52:25] um and just ask the Lord to to be with
[2:52:28] him and and actually y'all don't mind I
[2:52:32] know we've taken a little bit of time
[2:52:34] but maybe we could just pray for brother
[2:52:37] Matthew and um the Lord would just go
[2:52:40] with him and keep him and give him the
[2:52:43] wisdom and and uh just watch over him
[2:52:46] his his friend he brought a friend that
[2:52:49] was a policeman
[2:52:51] um been a couple years ago
[2:52:56] now a year but B brought a a a young man
[2:53:02] to church just a fine young man and U
[2:53:06] but since that time uh he had been U hit
[2:53:10] by a car and um I don't think he's even
[2:53:15] able to work uh
[2:53:20] it started back but he's in a lot of
[2:53:22] pain still uh just broke bones and but
[2:53:25] he was doing his job been a policeman
[2:53:27] and the car ran over him and they hit
[2:53:31] him and and so he's just been uh so you
[2:53:34] know it's it's dangerous work but
