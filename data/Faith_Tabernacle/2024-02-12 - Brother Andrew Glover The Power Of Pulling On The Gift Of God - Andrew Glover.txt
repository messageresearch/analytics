the Lord here this afternoon amen I want you by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight to speak to here and if I title this thought tonight I just want to talk to you a little bit about the power of pulling on the gift of God Amen the power of pulling on the gift of God I'm going to uh use Webster's definition of the word pull I think it's a very beautiful definition he says it is to exert force on someone or something so as to cause movement toward oneself it is an act of taking a hold of something and exerting Force Amen to draw it towards oneself it is a force drawing someone amen or something thank you brother in a particular amen direction or course of action now uh I believe tonight that God Amen wants us to pull on the gifts that he sent among the church I believe he wants us to pull on those gifts Amen in order to get the full value out of what is in those gifts now amen I believe that God also wants a people amen that will come to the full value of everything that he has promised them in the age we're living now in the in the message of Grace 1961 brother says now but they speaking of Israel he said didn't keep it amen but they never did come to the full promise not that generation no the one that promise was made perished in the wilderness amen but God fed them God took care of them God loved them he moved them around why his grace did it his grace because of his promise amen promis them the grace that went with his promise amen but they never did come to the full value of the promised land what a amen what a what a staggering thought that they never did come Amen to the full value of the promised land and neither he says does the church amen come to its full value the grace of God is what holds us but he wants to get a church that will obey him a people that will take his word and say it's the truth amen regardless of your organization he wants a people that will not say well I'm just as good as you are I'm Presbyterian or I'm Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as you are that's not Grace amen that shows there's something wrong now when you think about God wanting something I believe amen that what our God wants our God gets amen I believe that that I believe he's God and I believe if he desires something Our God has the ability Amen to see his desire come into manifestation so therefore amen I believe tonight that God has already provided a way amen for the Believers to come to the full value amen of the promises in the age that we're living in in Ephesians 4:8 as we read the Bible said amen wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he gave he led captivity captive amen and gave gifts unto men in Romans 11:29 the Bible says for the gifts and calling of God Amen are without repentance now when you start looking at this word gift the Greek definition amen of course it is a free gift so it's not something you buy or something you earned amen but rather it's something given by almighty God and this word means Grace or it's gifts denoting extraordinary powers now this what I want to focus on it is distinguishing amen certain Christians and enabling them to serve the Church of Christ amen so when a gift is recognized in the life of an individual amen that gift is not there to promote the individual not there to build the individual or to build a kingdom or to build a following unto the individual amen but rather that gift has been placed there sovereignly by God Amen to enable that individual to serve the body of Christ it is the reception amen of which is due to the power of divine grace amen operating on their souls by the Holy Spirit In other words anything they bring that will have a benefit to the church amen is not going to come by an educational ability not going to come by an intellectual ability amen but it will come by the grace of God that is found a way to operate through the soul of the individual in whom God has deposited the gift now as I already said gifts of God are not earned amen but rather gifts of God are sent amen and they are placed by God in Malachi 4:5 you know the Bible says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet now see that will be before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord in St John 1 ver6 the Bible says amen that there was a man that was sent from God whose name was John now the brother B says something very beautiful he said now if I said I could heal you then I'd be telling you something wrong I cannot heal you amen what is it it's a gift that I have that God gave me not somebody laid hands on me that don't work see gifts and callings are without repentance you're born with them in all your life the Bible said so see Moses was born a prophet amen John the Baptist 712 years before he was born he was a voice of one crying in the wilderness God told Jeremiah before you ever even was conceived in your mother's womb I knew you and Sanctified you and ordained you amen a prophet to the nation see it's God's election calling not that you're any better than anybody else amen we are all all the same see we're just children but God has chose some Amen to be one thing and some to be another if you pick where God chose you then you can yield yourself and that spirit will work through you just like these ministers here well they're called preachers the preacher he said I'm not a preacher I wouldn't say I was a preacher because I have no education but some men amen can get up and preach to when they're preaching inspired amen they yield themselves to the spirit of God Amen they have a way of doing that so when you begin to wonder how can a Ministry amen preach the way they preach or say the things they say or operate in the in the in the measure that they're operating in it's not because of their their ability as a human amen but it's because there is a gift amen that's been deposited into that life amen and the way that gift is operated is not by a bunch of learning or by a bunch of degrees amen but it is operated by the individual being able to get themsel out of the way Amen in order for The God Who to place the gift there Amen to come into the body of Christ that his people could receive the value of what he deposited in the individual now I'll say this I believe that God has elected some people Amen to hear the gifts amen that God has sent in this generation and let me say this I believe that God has elected us Amen to be more than church members I believe he's elected us to be more than just musicians or amen more than just officers but I believe God Amen has elected us to be contenders amen because the thing that we are receiving amen is something worth contending for amen the things that these gifts are preaching to the church amen are things that are worth contending for I believe that our contention amen is not for a personality it is not for a direction it is not for a move around the message amen but I believe our contention is for the faith of Jesus Christ now Jude 1:3 says beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me Amen to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith amen which was once delivered to the Saints now the prophet of God said contention is all right if it's for the right thing and he said to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints now you hear so many people today they say oh Divine healings against my faith the baptism of the holy spirit is against my faith see there's only one faith and that Faith doesn't come by joining a church that faith comes by hearing and that of the word of God again in 1954 he said my contentions through the Christian church today beond the Realms of theology my contention is that Jesus is Alive among the Christian people and just as real as he ever was amen and he is a manifesting himself in his deity amen and power to forgive sin to heal the sick to make the lame walk to make the blind see amen and to perform everything that he did when he was here on Earth he will do it yet now so here's a prophet saying I'm not contending amen for a church for a denomination I'm contending amen that if the same faith that was delivered to the Saints amen is recognized in the midst of the church in the last days amen that faith is going to operate and it's going to manifest itself the same way that it did back there again he says what my contention is and what my Ministry is is to contend amen that Jesus Christ the son of God is not dead amen I think that's a good point of contention for every believer amen that Jesus Christ the son of God is not dead his body is sitting on the throne of God in glory amen but the spirit that was in him is right here now in the church amen and it is moving among his people amen that is according to his word now listen without a prophet we cannot identify amen what is moving Among The Church Without a prophet we do not know amen who is in our midst amen but behold I will send you a gift and it will be the gift of the seventh angel and he will identify that the word has returned in the midst of the church and what he did In the Flesh of Jesus he is doing in the flesh of the believer amen now I believe it I don't believe these things are accidental I believe they're ordained and I believe that God Amen has ordained five offices amen by for knowledge and placed it in the church amen for every age now is it okay if we just read a little bit here tonight in the book of Ephesians the 4th chapter amen the 11th verse if you begin to read there amen the Bible says that he gave some Apostles and he gave some prophets and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers now if you got your Bible there amen why don't you underline those three words he gave some he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers I want you to catch this here he gave some not he gave all so he didn't give all pastors all pastors all evangelist amen so what he does is he's a god of variety amen so he gave some prophets he gave some pastors he gave some teachers he gave some evangelist amen and the prophet identifies this and says it's five offices amen it's God's dress wear amen so the prophet can dress you a certain way and then the pastor will add more clothing another way and then the Evangelist and then the teacher and the Apostle amen but notice here what they're doing is they're enabling by God amen the church not to come up in the Revelation three condition amen that they're wretched miserable blind and naked and they put it on the whole armor of God said what is it it's God dressed up in his church when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelist what is that that is God's dress wear amen God's presence God's spirit working through the man and if that office denize any of this word amen then it's not God dressing amen so if some prophet or some Pastor or some evangelist or some teacher amen denies any part of God's word amen God is not in that man amen dressing the bride he said that is the wolf and sheep's clothing amen watch that fellow beware of him but when he just takes the word and says remember that's God see CU God is speaking his word he says well amen it isn't oh oh my go get to go sheep get to go now brother saying that Amen to identify that in the last days amen that men will invade offices that they have no business in amen and they'll begin to teach things and establish things amen and leave the church in a direction amen that is contrary to the word of God now when they do these things this is not something amen that is new this is the spirit that's been working for years amen but here's a prophet on the scene and he says but God's dress wear will not dress you Amen in something of denomination he will dress you by the word I love how the prophet of God says each office amen backs up the other amen so it's not the prophet competing against the Evangelist and the Evangelist competing against the pastor amen but they're all working together and they're backing each other up amen now I believe that the true gifts of God of Ephesians for amen they are sent into the body Amen to achieve something for the body of Christ amen the prophet of God said no matter how great a teacher is how powerful he is how intellectual he is or how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something amen for the benefit of the body of Christ amen your own spiritual discernment would tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ amen to achieve something maybe he's got a great gift he could draw people together with a great intellectual spiritual power that he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so he'll have a big name or so other men Brethren will look up to him as a big person amen that's wrong see or maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him in his group be the picture that's still wrong see if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ amen then I don't care what he belongs to you're not Discerning the man you're Discerning the spirit amen the life that's in the man and that's what God told us to do not one was told one time was we ever commissioned to discern the man's group but we was constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit in the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him to now let me say this if it's a true God calleded gift amen they're only going to preach the absolute truth they're not just going to preach what they think is truth they're going to preach the absolute truth because it's the only thing that will bring the body of Christ to Perfection amen continuing in Ephesians 4:12 Paul goes on to say amen for the perfecting of the Saints amen for the work of the ministry amen for the edifying of the body of Christ amen that's a powerful word they're edifying that word edifying means to build up amen it is the act of one who promotes another's growth Amen in Christian wisdom happiness and Holiness amen so when you see one of these five-fold offices operating amen they're not operating to tear down the body but they're operating to build up the body to promote growth in the Church of the Living God in the message and ins sign brother said for what purpose amen for the man to glorify himself amen for the edification of the church amen to bring the church to a living faith in Christ amen so the preaching of the Gospel amen the teaching of the Gospel the establishing of the missionary amen the prophetic utterance of the Prophet amen the the amen the ox of the team the pastor amen that is not there Amen to kill the church amen to divide the church but that is there to bring the church to a living faith amen that Jesus Christ is the Son of God Amen and they're not contending for a church they're not contending for a group amen but they are contending that Jesus the son of God is alive and his power is real and his anointing is manifesting amen there's victory in the word there's overcoming power in the word I say oh God let us get back to preaching amen the pure unadulterated absolute truth of the word of God in the age we're living in he said see till we all come verse 13 till we all come Amen in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God watch this unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now I love verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine amen by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive now the Propet of God there is speaking of more amen than just than just uh than just uh adolescence amen but he's speaking of adoption that there will come an adoption upon the church that there'll be no more children tossed to and fro listen what a prophet says he says now every great achievement is tied to an absolute you cannot run this life without having an absolute you cannot make an achievement without it being an absolute for it is the final TI poost it is the hitch rack at the end of The Journey it's a place where you are tied to something and in the day that we're living in now everything is so breaken up it's so fragile and carried away he said I think that this message would be a very appropriate thing especially to Christians when they are going through their deep Waters now amen the Christian church is passing through the deepest Waters it's had amen for the last 2,000 years because we are coming to a spot where there is something presented to Christianity something they have to make a decision on and I think that the Christian Church ought to have something that they know they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf upon the Water the wind as the Bible said carried about with every wind of Doctrine see the winds come and blow this Leaf this way and then another wind Comes The North Wind South Wind East Wind West Wind you'll never get anywhere you're not stabled amen now listen to a prophet the Christian Life should be a stable life amen the Christian Life should be a stable life in other words you're not in one day and out the next you're not in one service and out the next amen but if you're ever in you're always in amen cuz you didn't put yourself in amen but the ele and favor of almighty God Amen put you in by the blood of Jesus Christ and there's nothing can take you out listen I'll tell you this the devil don't want me to say it but I'm going to say it amen some days we're going to be up and some days we're going to be down but can I say this if you got the holy ghost in your soul and you are sealed until the day of your Redemption amen you may get up and you may get down but you never go in and out amen because if a man ever comes in Christ he is sealed until the day of his Redemption and there's no trouble there's no trial there's no situation amen there's no disappointments there's no bad days hard days Victory come on church amen Victory will reain in the life of believer amen because they're not pulling from a man they're not pulling from Shawn Martin they're not pulling from Andrew Clover they're not pulling from Wayne Lawson or Josh B amen or any other preacher amen are pulling from the gift amen that God has deposited into this generation to preach a message and that message is the absolute and if that message of absolute power ever finds a place in the soul of a Believer the devil is finished amen sin is over the devil's lost the battle because it brings them to a place of stability my goodness we're not up one day amen in alha X we may get up and we may get down but a Christian don't go in and out can I get a witness here a Christian don't go in and out when a Christian comes in Christ he's sealed in until the day of his Redemption the Christian Life should be a stable life it should be something that's a principle that you're tied to now look at verse 15 now if you're going to come to a stable life sometimes people has got to speak the truth to you in love but speaking the truth and love that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now watch this that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ now come on parents what do you tell kids amen I wish you'd grow up you know why you say that is because you're ready for a level of maturity to be manifested in their life now listen they can't just hear those words and do it you can stand there and beat them down grow up grow up amen but somebody's got to set an example of something that's higher than where they are and then they purpose in their heart Amen to obtain the higher calling and this message was more than just another sermon it was more than just a better idea about the godhead this message was the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus that he could set a standard before the church and say listen there's more to this thing than just going to church and paying your TI and being a member of a church but Jesus Christ the son of God God has returned to the church in the power of Revelation and he said grow up in all things amen which is the head even Christ For Whom the whole body is fitly joined together amen and in compacted by that which every joint suppli amen according to the effectual working in the measure of every part look at those words amen and maketh increase amen listen church amen if the prophet and the pastor and the Evangelist and the teacher and the apostle amen will all preach the absolute truth then the body will not decrease but the body will increase unto the edifying of itself in love let me say this to you and don't you ever forget this amen concerning the gifts of Ephesians 4 amen God sent those gifts to help the body not to hurt the body God sent those gifts to help the body not to hurt the body can I give you another one God sent those gifts to unite the body not divide the body can I give you another one God sent those gifts Amen to separate the body from sin and unbelief can I give you another one he didn't send those gifts on accident he sent him on purpose can I give you another one and what he SS he testifies of in other words the man don't have to promote himself he don't have to blow his horn and tell what he's done and what he's preached and how powerful amen but if God is with that gift amen if it is a god- sent gift amen then the god of Heaven Come on church amen I I'm just going take the gloves off and preach for a second amen cuz we got a lot of people amen that get in their mind amen if they were born in a certain family or they were friends with the right preacher or they was connected to the right group amen maybe they could get ahead life amen do you mean to tell me that God is big enough to put a gift in your life and then a bunch of preachers are big enough Amen to stop that gift from coming to manifestation brother if God placed that gift he will testify that gift and if he wants to use it in the jungle he'll use it if he wants to use it in the he'll use it come on I know a lot of y'all think amen that I just started preaching amen traveling around everywhere amen but I spent F first few years of my Ministry Amen in a homeless shelter amen preaching to homeless people amen the message of the hour in a Methodist Church they didn't like it but I preach it amen and I say this and I thank God for those days because it taught me how to preach the message against opposition I'll tell you this just quickly I remember one of the first times ever preached on her brother Kevin what it was was a homeless shelter and they'd bring all the homeless in on Tuesday night and they'd feed him a they'd feed him a meal and then they open the pantry and give him some some food and things to take with them and I remember preaching there amen actually got in there by my family members amen they took me in there and I got up and I didn't know no better I mean that's just a 13-year-old kid you know I got up started preaching John 4 the woman at the well there was a seat in her and God sent a prophet with a message Amen to Quicken that seat Amen brother Kevin I never will forget it as just a kid preacher I seen the power of God drop in a basement and I watched homeless people amen weep their eyes out at the message of the hour and a bunch of dignified denominations wind up on the wall and they folded their arms and blowed up and got mad amen one brother told me he said you'll never be back here again so about 6 months later I got a phone call and when I got the phone call I said I didn't think I was ever coming back they said well none of the elders want you but the homeless people do I thought well that must be a good thing amen amen we got something to say amen and if God called you amen if you got to stand stand in a nursing home if you got to stand on a street corner if you preach a convention or you preach a special meeting what difference does it make amen it's not about the preacher it's about the body amen coming to the headship of Christ that they may grow up into a stable life to manifest Christ in every situation amen I believe if God calls a man God Will Make A Way for the man come on and I believe God will put somebody Amen to hear what he says now amen I'm this close to it I might as well say it amen God God called gifts to not promote other things outside of the message now I know that might choke some but we're not interested in what the latest Dr Dobson ideas we want to know what's been Vindicated to be the truth now the prophet said Lord send your spirit and give people Faith amen oh God get in trouble sure as the world you know me you preach the message is that okay amen and I don't think we ought to be preaching things amen the denominations are talking about we're not chickens we're Eagles so if come on now amen some of Y Amen brother will sister hope amen y'all didn't sit down there and traffic all morning and then fight your way to get to church amen to hear some little Baptist idea or some little story amen come on y'all didn't come here tonight amen over weary bodies and tied Spirits Amen to hear somebody get up and talk about some conspiracy theory or some something that has nothing to do with the bride amen you can't here because you're Eagles and the word of God said where the carcass is amen there where the Eagles be gathered together and I think if we're going to stand before Eagles we ought to preach Eagle food I think if we're going to gather some Eagles together and have a meeting we ought to put some Eagle food on the table and let the Eagles get some Elbow Room and go to feeding on the revelation of the bread of Jesus Christ in the eggs that God has sent it down in it's the only thing that will edify the church now some times he said it startles them Father they cannot realize the presence this great thing the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the new the Holy Spirit of this day standing here tonight to make good any promise he made then send your gifts he said now watch that it might work to bring the people to edify the church to bring us to a realization of your presence so the gifts the the the the officers of those gifts is to preach a word that will bring a spirit in the building that will cause people to recognize what others can't see now God sends the gifts to glorify God and not the man and here you H 1957 he said now this little gift has the that the Lord by his grace has given to me is not anything to glorify me if I'd ever do that it might leave me I might leave the world it's not for me it's for you that's the reason I can't operate it you're the only one who does do it now if we would really take those words to heart we would quit making the preacher come in and work for 30 minutes to finally get one amen now don't get mad at me I'm just going to preach a little bit here amen I've literally heard people say a oh god I've Lally heard people say well we've never heard a preacher preach like that amen well let me say this amen sometimes you got to open the gift come on you got to open the gift are you hearing me amen and if you don't open the gift amen and you go to another meeting and hear the same preacher amen don't get mad at them people and say well he was oh come on well he just preaching like that cuz there was more people no a man preaches by the operation of the gift by the people listen we don't practice these sir one time Daniel and I was out somewhere and somebody asked me they said how long do it take you to practice a sermon I I kind of looked at the woman I said sorry sis she said practice a sermon you know get all your moves down there I thought practice a sermon amen but that's the mindset of people amen they think the pullit is a performance they think it's a place a man gets up and shows off his knowledge and shows off what he's memorized listen yes God has given some men with the ability to remember things and to quote things amen but at the end of the day when it's all said and done if you want an answer from God you got to get off your Ash Heap and you got to start pulling on the gift of God if you want the power of God Amen to break out in the church come on job I know you're on the ash Heap amen but even if you're on the ash Heap God is still God and His word is still true and power is still real and if you'll just start pulling God will go to moving if you'll start crying God will go to answering if you'll start pushing back God will go to tearing down walls and he'll bring an anointing in the church oh God hallelujah I'm talking about somebody learning to put some force on the preacher and pull now I know I know people say well that's Pentecostal no ACC spiritual scriptural let me move on now if I come here with every such a great gift and you people come and say I don't believe nothing to it nothing to it at all there'd be nothing happen so therefore it doesn't take me it takes you and I both it takes both of us to operate the gift of God are you ready for this the gift comes on me and you operate it by your faith Now watch how many understands that see so no man can say oh it's me it is and it's God neither is it you now I've seen some people that they're pretty proud in the way they pull now don't get mad at me they're pretty proud in the way they pull but let me say this amen if a preacher got up and was proud the way he preached he wouldn't want to preach hear him preach to you come on now and amen if a man's so arrogant that he thinks he's the greatest puller ever was come on now I got to I got a problem listen it's not a show it's about getting in the spirit and letting God come in the the building and do things that none of us could do it isn't me it isn't you you couldn't operate it unless it was somewhere to be operated amen I couldn't operate unless there was something to operate through see I am the vine and ye are the branches amen Jesus gives the energy and we collect it Jesus gives the energy and we collect it amen listen as the word is going forth that's more than scriptures brother Branson that's more than quotes amen but that is energy amen come on we're in an hour when everybody needs some energy right amen 5our energies Red Bulls monsters all kinds of crazy things amen just to get some energy well listen that's in the natural amen but what about in the spiritual we got a Finish Line to Cross Church we got a battle to win we got a war to win and it ain't time to get lazy and it ain't time to back off of the way we have church I think if there's ever been a time we ought to blow the windows out of the building and Shout the cwes out the sound system I think Now's the Time to do it and let the Holy Ghost come in the church and the power of His manifestation and reveal the answers and reveal the secrets and move as he desires to move I think it's time to get back to having Church come on I think if we're going to clean up and show up we ought to have church oh brother Andrew you don't know what I'm going through well I don't need to know what you're going through and let me just reverse that you don't know what I'm going through and you don't need to know what I'm going through but there is one person that knows about us all and his name name is Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God it's in the building so I might as well preach time to grow up I said it's time to grow up there are going to be things happen that you don't like but you got to grow up come on now amen there's going to be song sung that you don't like but you got to grow up I said you got to grow up you know why because this ain't about you this ain't about me it's about Jesus Christ coming in the midst of his people and performing his word according to the Vindicated promise he y'all know what I'm talking about am mean if we ain't careful we going to have the atmosphere so locked down amen we can't even get enough moisture to spit before long amen cuz somebody didn't sing the right song or they sung to new of a song or the drums were too fast or the preacher was too loud or the speakers were too hot amen what in the name of God has happened to us that we can't even just have church no more I think we ought to blow them Devils Back To Hell and release the atmosphere and let the Holy Ghost have a rattle let him save our babies let him fill our young people let him revive our church let him send a healing let him send a manifestation take the breaks off and just have church again until you didn't care what time it was I know what I'm talking about I'm sorry I wasn't hashed out of some intellectual preaching style amen sister hope I was hashed out y'all remember them days when we used to preach and and shout and you'd hear some stomping going on and you'd look back and hope was Shou all over the building you know what it was it was because somebody had taken the restrictions off of the atmosphere and recognized there's a God who is a holy God and he's come in the midst of his church as the mighty conqueror and he's not here as an onlooker he's here as a deliverer he's here as a way maker he's here as a miracle worker I say oh God open up the windows of heaven and fill Faith Tabernacle with the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost again that church you want to have church we might as well have church let's get back to where we didn't care how long service was let's just have church y'all remember them Sunday night meetings come on y'all remember y'all remember we didn't wait for them to get over we couldn't believe they were over I tell you what happens is people get a little opinionated they don't think we ought to sing certain songs and so they get this idea that well if we're going to have a move of God we got to sing some old songs that don't get mad at me okay but I've been in meetings where we have sung songs that Luther didn't even sing and it didn't change the atmosphere one [Music] bit well glory to God I feel like preaching it didn't change now come on you know why it didn't change atmosphere is because it wasn't done out of humility it was done out of arrogance well we're not going to sing way maker and we're not going to sing Our God is awesome amen cuz we're too spiritual for that come and people holler oh going to get in trouble Sister Kim they holler about not singing Hill song Amen in Maverick City oh I'm getting trouble and all these other songs amen because the lifestyle they're living but they'll sing Luther songs who smoked the pipe come on church are you hearing me it's time to grow up it's time to get out of being baby fi come on listen amen there ain't a bunch of Bob tered women up here singing those songs there's Holy Ghost filled message believers that have taken the words of those songs and they have found an atmosphere come on I say sing them church I say sing them until the glory Falls I say sing them until the Holy Ghost comes in the church and somebody gets a revelation my God is a way maker my God is a miracle worker my God is going to bring the victory I'm going to see the victory are you saying brother Andre we shouldn't sing old songs no we ought to sing them and new songs but let me just say this oh I'm here I might as well preach amen and when something don't goes our way amen let's just go ahead and be mature sons and can I give you a little secret it ain't about you brother Bill can I give you a little secret it ain't about me then who's it about it's about him it's about him coming in the church I was talking to some people one time and they got they got talk about some songs that they sung and I said you know I really don't like that song they said really I said no I I really don't care for it they said well we would have never know that had you not said something about it I said exactly right because I'm not a baby so when you sing it and I don't like it I don't hold a spiritual protest and put a kink in the atmosphere and block the holy ghost from moving I've grown up enough to know that we're going to get through this song and we're going to sing another song well it's Sunday night we might as well preach amen we're going to get through this one and we're going to sing another now let me just say this amen what difference does it make amen you might like How Great Thou Art and I might like I would not be tonight you might like old Rock of Ages and I might like our god is awesome but what difference does it make amen the reason we're singing those songs it's not to bring a music anointing in the building we're singing those songs to bring the holy ghost in the building so if he comes on how great thou art or he comes on I would not be denied or he comes on Rock of Ages when he shows up let's let's just be thankful that he's come in the midst of the church once again to manifest himself in the power of His Dynamic Resurrection Hallelujah just let it all go and get back to heav church again oh glory to God we got to open the atmosphere up God sends and Gifts Behind These pull pits we got to open the atmosphere up for well I had a bad day so did the preacher but the preacher didn't lay down and stay home he come on and preach now I know I'm getting a little Evangelistic but is that okay let's get back to having church or brother Ander I remember when we used to have a bunch of people man holy ghost would come in the when in the name of the Lord did it start mattering about how many people was here my Bible says we're two or three and some take that L we're two or three amen was gathered in my name there I'll be in their midst if we got two or three what difference does it make if he comes in the service Oh Glory to God you said brother why do you want him because on Earth he had the spirit without measure in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead Bley brother said Jesus Christ was the greatest gift that God ever had don't you believe that when he was here on the earth he said now watch he had the spirit without measure all the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Christ now he was like the whole oceans all the Seas all the water which is about four fists of the Earth is covered with water and all that water was in him that's comparison with a blessing and the measure of the spirit of God gave him now in his servants and ministers and we are you hearing me in his servants in his ministers and we is just a spoonful of water in comparison of an ocean or the sea oh God but the same chemicals brother Shmi that's in the whole ocean is in the Spoonful too see so it's got to produce the same thing if it comes from the same place listen friends if you go to the Sea and there's salt in the sea and you get a cup of water there's salt in that water if you go to the Sea and you get a cup of water and there's minerals in that water in the sea there's minerals in that c are you hearing me and the prophet of God is saying amen then whatever is in him is in the church in measure but it's the same thing amen and sometimes amen God is going to use his gifts sometimes amen God is going to put a man in the pull head and he's going to let the atmosphere get so tight and people get so bored and look at the walls and ignore him and he's going to drop on that man and use that man amen to blow Devils out of the building by the things he's preaching he's going to use that man to bring correction he's going to use that man to bring a direction amen and sometimes that man is going to get up in the pull pit and he's going to feel like he don't have nothing to say he don't have nothing to preach but he's going to get up there by faith and begin to preach the word and in a few minutes an anointing is going to drop on him and things are going to begin to happen you know what that is that's the people using God's gift but either way it comes let's just get the full value out of the gift that God sends by exerting some force on it now the Bible says in Mark 5 there was a woman with the issue of blood and you know what the prophet of God said he said maybe she slipped under the man's arm and he pushed her back she come around the other side and slipped in the other side went between that one's knees and on down there she got over to a place till she touched him and she walked back away and walked out in the audience and Jesus stopped and said who touched me and she and the rest of them said not me they all denied it but he said I perceive amen I've gotten weak see if that translation isn't right virtue strength has gone from me see what did she do he looked around until his power of discernment caught the woman who she was and he said thy faith has made thee whole and then she came and fell down at his feet and confessed it all now thy faith is healed thee or save thee rather thy faith has saved thee now watch he said she used God's Gift amen that's what made him weak y'all heard people say we're going to send the preacher home War out tonight amen do you know what does that amen that's when you begin to exert some force and you begin to pull I remember somebody told me one time they saider if I really pulled like I felt I'd have to bring a change of shirt I said well come on and join the club I do are you hearing me come on but whatever we do let's just take the restrictions off of the atmosphere so we can get the full benefit of what God has enabled somebody to preach now in John chap 11 the Bible speaks of the resurrection of Lazarus and he said did you notice when he stood there he said I thank thee father thou has already heard me our friend Lazarus is asleep they said oh he rest us said he's dead but for your sakes I'm glad I wasn't here cuz it might upset your faith if you want me to go pray for him amen beg me to do it and I wouldn't have done it but that might lose Faith this way I'm glad I wasn't there but I go wake him see Oh Glory I'm going to preach it devil amen I go wake him said now watch he said when he went to wake him he said now watch he knew it see I do nothing till the father shows me but notice when he stood there how much greater was the miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus than the woman touching His Garment but there was nothing said about him getting weak amen she had a issue of blood and he pull and she pulled and she got her healing and strength left his body he goes to the Lazarus grave and raised Lazarus and he didn't get weak he said God had used his gift in Christ amen the for showing the resurrection of Lazarus and the woman used God's gift to get what she wanted listen friends amen when God uses his gift it's to do something for a foreshadow of what his word said he would do but when you use that gift it's to get something that you want it's to get something that you need and the brother says so in this new thing the Lord told me about it'll be God using his gift and when you're standing here in the public before people it's just a constant draw it's just a miracle of God if him the Virgin born son of God one time was such a strain till it pulled him down he got so weak what about me a corruptible sinner look at times it's happened see but it's God using his gift or you using his gift it isn't me that stands here it's you that stands here and does it it's you out in the audience and you here on the platform you are drawing from God's gift what does that word pull mean brother will it means to exert some force on and means to draw towards oneself it's drawing on the gift of God he said I'm not his gift the spirit is his gift this is not my voice it just picks up my voice it's a dumb mute until something behind it speaks and so I would be a dumb mute to anything Supernatural unless the Supernatural is using the instrument to speak through glory to God friends do you see oh God I know it may become common to you but when you see Shawn Martin walk up them steps and stand behind this pull pit that's not just your pastor that's not just a preacher Amen brother SE don't get mad at me okay amen that's a dumb mute behind the pull pits I'm a dumb mute behind the pull pit every preacher is a dumb mute behind the pull pit until the supernatural amen comes in the building and somebody recognizes it and the man of God yields himself Amen to the gift of God and then Supernatural answers and Supernatural Miracles and Supernatural deliverances take place church of living God when you see the man of God take the pull pit you ought to say speak Holy Ghost you ought to say use him Holy Ghost come on I'm preaching to you now are you hearing me are you hearing me you ought to put on that gift I know what I'm talking about amen you're talking to somebody that's seen amen God take a dumb youut from the hills of East Tennessee over to the country India and stand in a pull pit with about a 100 pastors on my left side and just preaching the word preaching the word preaching the word and all of a sudden sister Jane something come over me and I looked over at them pastors and I said Brothers I don't know where God has caught you I'll never forget it I said I don't know where God has got you I don't know what village you're in I don't know what Hut you're in you may feel like you're wasting your time but God has put every one of you in those Villages as a witness to this end time word and wherever God has but you don't you close your doors don't you sit down don't you get too discouraged you just keep on holding this message up and brother Daniel while I was preaching I seen the Holy Ghost hit a pastor I didn't know who he was at the time it hit him right there and brother Willie just broke down y'all forgive me I'm just the country okay brother Mark he broke down like a Tennessee shotgun he just broke down and he began to cry he come to me after service he threw an interpreter he said brother Andrew you don't know me he said but this morning I got up and I said I'm in a a village I'm in the middle of nowhere I hardly have any people I'm wasting my time amen God's through with me here I'm just going to shut the church down he said exactly what I told God was exactly what you spoke to my heart listen friends that wasn't for a show that wasn't to say I had some Supernatural gift I was a dumb mute but the Holy Ghost found the lightway he found the Liberty in the church and he was able to answer the situation let me say the same holy ghost in India it's the same holy ghost in blackburg he's here on Wednesday nights he's here on Sunday morning he's here on Sunday night it's time to break out of the ritualistic formalistic devilish ideas and come back to the power of pulling on the gift of God until the Holy Ghost breaks out in the building and things begin to [Music] change come on I remember brother Kevin when we didn't give up till things changed I remember when we sang till things changed I remember when we preach till things change I remember when we used to pray until things changed I say oh God bring back for this spiration of the Holy Ghost on the church until we begin to believe God again in the power of the word of God somebody give him some praise in here hallelujah hallelujah open up the atmosphere open up the atmosphere that's the holy ghost in the church again Hallelujah pull on God get an answer well somebody don't like me getting the full value out of a service well people don't like me getting the full value out of golden crowd but I paid for it so I'm goingon to get it hello come on you know people sit there and laugh at you when you go for that dessert bar you know they make fun of you but you pay 20 bucks so you or whatever it is now you're going to get the full value out of it well Church of the Living God this message is free of charge the word of God the Holy Ghost The unsearchable Riches of Christ are in this service every time that we Gather in the house of God oh church can we get back to where we don't care what time it is we don't care what people think about us we just care about having a conference with god sister rayanna when we have a conference with God you know what happens the pro of God said a conference is telling the devil you've gone as far as you're going to go and I think it's high time that some of you all amen draw a line in the sand and tell that Old Devil say you've gone as far as you're going to go you've lied and robbed and criticized as far as you're going to go we may be few in number but we are Mighty in power we may be laughed at made fun of laughing stock amen but greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world I feel like shouting on that one God is with this church God is with this message change the situation by pulling on the word of God don't get mad at me but there's some things the only thing can change is just let go and let God have his way now I'm going to try to close on this the woman at the wi you blood pulled on the gift of God God raised Lazarus God pulled on the gift of God in Mark chapter 10 there was a man named blind bardus he sat by the highways side begging so what that tell me brother will he was a beggar David says in Psalms 34 this poor man Cried unto the Lord and he heard him and delivered him and saved him brother Joe out of all his troubles my Bible says when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal they said listen thank things have gone too far the Situation's too bad it's too hopeless barus just be quiet in church just sit there as a beggar but listen he cried the more a great deal and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they called the blind man said to him be of good Comfort rise he cth thee and he casted away His Garment he rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what will thou should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately immediately he received his sight amen and followed Jesus in the way in other words brother Shmi amen for years he had been a beggar in other words amen he didn't have enough money just enough to barely get by and brother B said he was sitting there thinking on some things and brother when you begin to think on the things that are true and are honest a good report amen if there be any praise Wonder said wonder if I call a prayer line wonder if God will speak don't think that kind of negative thought don't let that fault go through your mind make every word positive and every thought positive see you oh God you know the disciples after the resurrection of Jesus copius and his friend was on his road down to EMAs and as he went around his friend was was talking about Jesus thinking about Jesus now watch he stepped right out in the bushes and walked with him and while they were thinking they were meditating are you ready for this he said that's the same way Jesus does today the same way that copius and his friend met him on the road to emus is the same way brother shiah he's right here in Faith Tabernacle in my heart on my mind all day long let me walk with the Lord in the light of his word with a Heavenly Dove let me have Fellowship all day long now what can I can I give you a little bit of History here from the prophet said barus promised God his two turtle doves for the healing of his daughter he promised God his lamb for the healing of his wife why while he was sitting there he remembered his mother telling the story of Israel leaving Egypt under the power of Jehovah but he remembered the priest at the temple amen taught that Jesus wasn't the same today as he was then every time that they would lead him to the temple for service here's what he heard Jehovah don't perform Miracles anymore now do you realize people can lie on somebody so long until you lose any confidence in him because of a stinking dirty rotten lie are you hearing me amen and nine oh God come on and nine times out of 10 people don't even ask about it they just take the LIE and move on with it amen and if barus would have receive that lie he would have sat there and Jesus would have walked right in the country and he not receive his healing because he believed the LIE of some backsliding FY and said Jesus don't perform Miracles anymore oh but one day when barus heard some noise he asked what was causing the noise and they said Jesus of Nazareth amen listen brother said all of a sudden something struck him amen that if that's Jesus that means Jehovah of the old is the Jesus of the new he said all of a sudden he heard a lot of noise and he said whenever Jehovah comes around there's a lot of noise amen can I can I preach a second brother SM brother B said they actually formed a committee Amen to stop the noise and called it nonsense said they stopped they said we're going to form a committee and we're going to stop this noise it's a bunch of nonsense but bmus asked him can someone tell me amen who this is passing by there's too much noise in the house of God on a Sunday night for this just to be another service on Super Bowl Sunday amen there's somebody in the building or somebody in the atmosphere or something moving or something happening beyond the Realms of theology beyond the ideas of religion or somebody in the building or somebody troubling the waters or somebody walking in the power of the Resurrection they looked at barus they said bmus I know you can't see him but it's that Jesus of Nazareth oh I love heram says brother Bill he said all of a sudden reality set in on him woo glory to God he said reality set in on him and he said these words he's passing by oh I love this you know what brother Bram said he said begin to think a new thought you know what that new thought was if he could feel the touch I'm giving you prophet's words on the hymn of His Garment he can surely Hear My Cry H GL hallelujah hallelujah if he can feel the touch with aund thousand touching him brother will if he can feel the touch if he can feel the touch and the woman walk away and go try to hide and he say listen I know virtues left my body if he could feel that touch brother Joey can hear your cry I don't care if it's in the midnight I don't care if it's in the we hours of the morning I don't care if it's in a service where it is if you begin to cry out to God he'll come on the scene and change the situation listen friends the pull of a blind Beggar's Faith stopped Jesus in his tracks if that blind Beggar's face stopped him on the road to Calvary y'all hearing me brother Daniel there was actually a war going on but how did I say this nicely there was a struggle going on between prophetic word and a blind Beggar's Faith the prophetic word is he's got to go to Calvary and he's walking on his way to Calvary and the pool of Calvary is on him the pool of redemption's on him the pool of salvation's on him the weight of the Cross is on him the weight of redemption is on him brother Matthew amen but yet there was a blind bar there was a blind bardus there and he had a need and so God was able to stop and say blind bmus you're healed are y'all hearing me listen you say preacher what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that just as much as it was a part of God's will for Jesus to go to Calvary and to manifest the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ it was his will to heal barus because thousands of years later there was going to be some people sitting in the service on the 11th day of the second month of the 24th year of 2000 and they were going to have a need in their life and they was going to wonder is God too busy is God too occupied has he got too much going on to help me but they're going to break beyond all the negative thoughts they're going to break beyond all the negative doubts and brother Daniel they're going to get a hold of this reality he's passing by he's passing by he's in the church he's in the building I've got a need if I can just get a hold of him if I can just stop him in his tracks my baby will be saved my body will be healed my joy will be restored my vision will be restored oh church of living God break beyond the barrier of negativity tonight and break out in that realm with God where you can believe again and pull on God are you hearing me there's something it's getting a little cool up here there's something happening beyond what you can see now here's your options and I'm done you can either give up bow your knee and accept the situation or you can rise and say I'll believe God in the face of whatever is happening now listen I'm way out of time he's in this building tonight and you said brother Andrew why did you spend so much time breaking out the atmosphere why did you spend so much time because Daniel is this okay if I share a little something here I I sat the other night and heard brother Daniel's sermon here in the pull pit and I text him I said I don't know maybe you didn't feel it but there was a vein in the building when you got on you're going to see a victory am I I literally felt it in the hotel room when he began to preach on that you're going to see a victory you're going to see a victory and Josiah when he said that my mind went back to that thought you preached on the atmosphere of Revival I said oh God there's something there's something you're trying to get your people to see you're going to see a victory but if you're going to see the victory you got to look beyond what you're seeing right now if you're going to see a victory you got to look beyond all the faults and all the bad words and all the hurt come I'm talking to you if you're going to see the victory sometime oh God I'm preaching now a't sometimes people going to hurt your feelings and they're going to say things they should have never said they're going to do things they should have never done but if it's only the

church and if you don't get weary and wello and you're going to reap the benefits of that Victory I'm GNA tell you this and I'm G I'm done a few years ago I mentioned him this morning I pray he'll forgive me he's a dear friend of mine I received the Holy Ghost under his preaching a few years ago brother Danny steeman was battling a real oppression just a real a real heaviness in his Spirit I'm telling you what happens in the Supernatural realm just a real a real burden and problems in the church as a pastor and situations and he got so low he said it went on I think it was about two years he got so low he said God I can't go another day I can't face another day I can't I can't preach another sermon he said there were times I was walking to the pull pit and I was standing there literally preaching without feeling any anointing we just stand there and just preaching the word preaching the word he said I didn't even feel like being there but I was there he said right in the middle of all this he said I was at the lowest breaking point of the situation he said and something come over me he said I had a meeting I believe it was over in Europe somewhere he said to go preach he said when I went over there he said I didn't even want to go brother Shi he said what have I got to offer these people in the condition I'm in he said it come down the last service and he said he would gotten the pull pit and he said I believe it I I maybe I can get the recording of it for you when he told it they say as I'm walking down there he said Devil's just bombarding my mind you're wasting your time you're going to fail you ain't got nothing to say you're a failure he said I walked in the pull pit he said I got there in that pull pit and he said I begin to preach and I begin to preach he said all of a sudden he said an anointing come in that build like I hadn't felt in a long time he said if ever he said after the service he said I felt the thing totally gone he said I felt the thing totally gone he said I tell you what happened he said I was walking out Brother Sam and he said somebody met me and they said I don't know if this will mean anything to you or not he said but while you were preaching tonight he said when the anointing come in the atmosphere he said I was looking at you he said but while you were in the pull pit he said I literally seen a physical Angel standing there amen holding you in the pull pit while you were preaching the word while you were just standing there preaching the word there was an angel holding you and he said that's oh brother Danny said that thing broke right then and there he said it was over he said when I couldn't even hold myself amen God would allow somebody to see that there was an angel hold me amen I remember when he told that up at Brother Ray Ericson's Church a few years ago and there was a man sitting there amen that had lost all the ability to believe for his healing he said but while he began to tell that testimony he said Faith returned to believe God was a Healer church we got to start talking about the supernatural again I know there's been a lot of fanaticism I know there's been a lot of this that and the other questions and this happened that happened amen but if we put all the supernatural out we're going to become a bunch of cold carnal amen folks that there's nothing Supernatural happening listen I refuse to open up the door and put the Supernatural on the outside because of carnal impersonations and carnal comparisons we've got a message that we check the supernatural by and if it is
